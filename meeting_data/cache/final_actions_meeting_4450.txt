Cambridge, MA 02139

The Health and Environment Committee will hold a public hearing on Tuesday, November 21,
2023 from 3:00-5:00p.m. to get an update on plans and timeline for the distribution of electric
power by Eversource in the city including the substation in East Cambridge to all accounts and

8.3 miles, in portions of Cambridge, Somerville and the Allston/Brighton area of Boston
These upgrades will bolster system reliability, meet growing energy needs and access to clean
energy resources for customers.

The Energy Facilities Siting Board (EFSB)
•
•

Independent state board that reviews proposed large energy facilities including transmission lines.
EFSB evaluates projects for reliability, minimum impact on the environment, lowest possible cost.

A hybrid alternative for the
Somerville preferred route was
recently introduced by Eversource
along Grand Junction Railway

Start of construction 2025 (Pending EFSB approval)
Estimated in-service date 2030 (5yr. duration)

Refresher:
Transmission - Enabling Clean Energy
• As a key enabler of a clean energy future, transmission is needed to:
• Connect a growing number of clean energy resources to the grid
• Supply enough power to meet the demands of electrification
• Meet our customers’ expectations for reliable and affordable clean
power
• Meet policymakers’ expectations to achieve state and regional
decarbonization goals
• Eversource is actively building infrastructure to support clean
energy and reliability
• Transmission is an essential part of the solution to New England’s
winter reliability challenges. Upgrading and expanding the
transmission system can increase the amount of available clean energy
to help bridge the winter energy supply gap.
• Eversource incorporates equity principles in all areas of our work
and is committed to working transparently and collaboratively
with all stakeholders in the communities we serve. We prioritize
meaningful, proactive engagement from the early planning stages of a
transmission project through its completion and beyond.

Transmission Needs (cont.)
Additionally, N-1 thermal overloads are expected to
result from 2024 loads, worsening each year thereafter

– By 2030, over 200 MVA of load shed would be necessary to
resolve due to the severity of the overloads



Per updated load forecasts, these N-1 thermal overloads
also now occur on all four transmission lines within the
project area



The transmission lines supplying the Cambridge area are
exposed to high risk of N-1 and N-1-1 transmission line
overloads over Drastic Action Limit (DAL) ratings, which
require full mitigation within 5 minutes

The City of Cambridge load is experiencing rapid economic development and
sustained load growth beyond the capacity of existing substations
N-1 loss of one East Cambridge transformer will result in equipment overload
and the need to drop load.
Nearby substation capacity has been exhausted.

and sustain future economic growth

Distribution Needs Based on Long-Term Demand Assessment




The new station is designed with 3 transformers expandable to 4 banks
The Company expects that station expansion (4th bank) will be triggered
when the demand in the wider load pocket reaches ~595 MW
Demand in load pocket is projected to reach 512 MW in 2030, leaving
about 83 MW of headroom for the region
Utilization of the 83 MW headroom will depend on continued business
growth past the known step loads and the actual impact of BEUDO

Transmission Routes
Update





Transmission routing analysis began once the
substation site was selected (February 2020)
and concluded prior to filing with MEPA
(November 2021)
Eversource held over 150 meetings with
stakeholders to identify, analyze, and select
the routes
Transmission routes balance reliability,
environmental and community concerns and
cost
MIT’s routing proposals increased cost and
would delay installation of three of the five
transmission duct banks

~ 2024* – City anticipates
purchasing 135 Fulkerson Street from
Eversource with the $12,929,000
Alexandria placed in escrow. No
appropriation of city funds will be
required.

using the 135 Fulkerson St parcel to
support construction of the
substation and the transmission
lines.
~ 2029* - City staff will begin a
community process to determine the
specific public use of the parcel.

Proposed Vassar St Realignment (Main St to Mass Ave Segment)

Considerations:
– Challenges for crossing both the Red Line tunnel and the Grand Junction Railroad tracks due to Main St utility
congestion on both sides of tunnel which will require a trenchless crossing of both the tunnel and the tracks, significant
impact of adjacent area to excavate pits would be required (including Grand Junction Park)
– Additional manholes required due to sharp turn from Albany onto Mass Ave, congestion on Mass Ave and GJ North
