The chair explained that Councillor Simmons withdrew her amendments proposed on July 30, 2019 and the
committee would be considering Councillor Simmons' amendments proposed on September 9, 2019.
The chair opened the floor for councillors to make comments.
Councillor Simmons made remarks to the committee about the process.
Mayor McGovern thanked Councillor Simmons for her comments. He shared her disappointment with the
comments that have been made by certain members of the public.

In response to a question from Councillor Simmons, City Solicitor Glowa stated that municipal taxes generated
by cannabis retailers in Cambridge must be placed in to general fund and that money must be used for public
purposes. She stated that moneys, in the form of impact fees, generated by the execution of Host Community
Agreements are meant to reimburse the City for its expenses in operating these programs. Therefore, it is the
opinion of the law department that such money must only be used for public purposes. Solicitor Glowa further

explained that there is no prohibition against RMDs or other Cannabis Retail Establishments from voluntarily
contributing money to a fund or non-profit to assist with EE applicants, so long as that money does not come to
the City or managed by City or influenced by the City in any way.
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Solicitor Glowa confirmed that it is her opinion that
section 5.50.045 in Councillor Simmons' amendments proposed on September 9, 2019 is not permissible and
should not be enacted.
Councillor Simmons stated that the documents she submitted with her September 5, 2019 proposed
amendments is more of a communication about what certain RMDs and EE applicants have voluntarily agreed
to amongst themselves.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the communication, as described by Councillor Zondervan, has no bearing on
the discussion before the committee.
Councillor Zondervan move to strike the communication.
No action was taken on the motion.
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Solicitor Glowa stated that many of the permitting
requirements in the proposed ordinance are unique to cannabis and other appear in some other ordinances.
Councillor Simmons proposed amendment to the definitions.
Councillor Simmons proposed amendment to Group B.
In response to a question from Vice-Mayor Devereux, Solicitor Glowa stated that the license or registration in
the definition of "Group B Priority Applicant" is referring to a state certification and that she would need to do
more research to determine which businesses would fall in that category.
In response to a question from Mayor McGovern, Solicitor Glowa stated that she believed that it would be
unnecessary to amend the proposed ordinance by dividing the paragraph in section 5.50.040 into two
subsections because section 5.50.110 makes the ordinance severable should a court strike down any portion.
Councillor Carlone stated that he would like to have applicants submit goals about how they will help maximize
long-term opportunities for the public to obtain medicinal cannabis.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that she believed that the manager may be able to incorporate Councillor Carlone's
goals in regulations that will be promulgated later.
In response to a question from Vice-Mayor Devereux, Solicitor Glowa stated that it is not appropriate to include
goals into the ordinance.
Councillor Zondervan suggested that Councillor Carlone work with the solicitor on incorporating his thoughts
into future regulations.
Councillor Mallon Amendment
Councillor Simmons moved to suspend the rules to extend the time of the meeting. The motion passed by a
voice vote of nine councillors.
Meeting adjourned by Councillor Kelley at 1:33pm.
