To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby recommending that in accordance with the requirements of the Massachusetts
School Building Authority (MSBA), the Cambridge City Council adopt the attached order for the
Statement of Interest Form to be submitted to the MSBA no later than June 1, 2021 for the
replacement of boilers at the Morse Elementary School, located at 40 Granite Street.
The funds are sought to be used for the replacement of the building's boilers. The Granite Street
building's boilers are more than twenty-eight years old, have antiquated controls and have had
multiple leaks repaired. Given the age and condition of these boilers, they will soon be beyond
further repair. Final cost estimates will be determined through a feasibility study if the project is
accepted into the MSBA program. The study will include a detailed analysis of the feasibility of
the boiler replacements adhering to the City's greenhouse gas emissions reductions strategy.
The School Committee of Cambridge, Massachusetts voted to authorize the Superintendent to
submit the Statement of Interest Form to the MSBA at an open meeting held on May 18, 2021.
The MSBA submission of the Statement of Interest Form, in no way guarantees the acceptance
or the approval of an application, the awarding of a grant or any other funding commitment from
the MSBA or commits the City/ School District to filing an application for funding with the
MSBA.

May 25, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council:

Based upon a review of the City of Cambridge’s (“City”) personal property accounts, in April of
2020, I recommended adoption by the City Council of a statutory small business exemption for
personal property accounts equal to or less than $10,000.00 in assessed value, which the City
Council approved. The $10,000.00 personal property tax exemption has been effective for Fiscal
Year 2021, which exempted 1,194 small businesses from receiving a personal property tax bill.
At the same time, I also recommended that the City seek authorization for an exemption for
personal property accounts equal to or less than $20,000.00 in assessed value, by requesting a
special act from the Legislature and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
These recommendations were one part of a plan to help small businesses through a combination
of programs including small business initiatives, grants, workshops and tax relief, particularly
with respect to our effort to assist small businesses that have dealt with, and are continuing to
deal with, the ramifications of COVID-19.
On April 6, 2020, the City Council accepted my recommendation and ordered that I work with
the City Solicitor to draft a home rule petition to authorize the City to provide a personal
property tax exemption of up to $20,000.00 of value, which we completed and submitted to the
General Court. The General Court approved the proposed home rule petition, and on January 7,
2021, Chapter 282 of the Acts of 2020 (“Act”) passed (attached), which allows the City of
Cambridge to permit a $20,000 personal property tax exemption upon acceptance of the Act by
the City Council by majority vote.
For fiscal year 2020, the City had 2,576 personal property accounts. Of those, 62% had an
assessed value of $20,000.00 or less, which represented just 0.54 percent of the overall personal
property valuation in the City of $1.679 billion dollars. For the coming fiscal year, we anticipate
that over 1,500 small businesses would be exempted from receiving a personal property tax bill
if the City adopts the $20,000.00 exemption. Not only will this tax exemption assist small
businesses financially and administratively, but it will also relieve the burden upon the City for
the collection and accounting of small accounts. I therefore respectfully request that the City
Council accept the provisions of this Act so that the City can start the process of permitting the
$20,000 personal property tax exemption for the coming fiscal year.

Attached is a proposed order that would provide for the City Council to adopt Chapter 282 of the

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to request that you approve the acquisition of land in Lincoln, Massachusetts
for the purpose of adding to the City’s watershed lands for water supply protection and
conservation purposes. The City of Cambridge has the opportunity to purchase from the Lincoln
Rural Land Foundation two parcels of land numbered 4 Twin Pond Lane, Assessor’s parcels
#180-13-0 and #180-11-0, in the Town of Lincoln (“the Property”) consisting of 7.79 + acres of
undeveloped land for the purposes of protecting the City’s drinking water supply and for land
conservation. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation is in the process of purchasing the property at
a discount this month from private owners. The Property is appraised at $1,000,000. The private
owners are selling it to the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation for $800,000. The Lincoln Rural
Land Foundation would then convey the Property in fee to the City. The $800,000 cost of
conveyance from the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation to the City would be broken down as
follows. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation would contribute $200,000, effectively reducing
its sale price to $600,000. The Town of Lincoln will contribute $200,000 toward the sale price.
The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation will further contribute $200,000 of funds that were privately
fundraised for this purpose. The City will pay only $200,000 plus costs and will obtain the fee
interest in the Property. However, the City has applied to the State for a grant to cover the cost
of the City's full share of this acquisition, being the $200,000 purchase price plus costs. If the
City does not receive the grant, I will request an appropriation from the Water Fund. As a
condition of the contributions by the private owners, the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation, the
Town of Lincoln, and the State grant, the Property must be permanently protected by a
conservation restriction as provided by G.L.c.184, §§31-33.
The Cambridge Water Board voted unanimously on May 11, 2021 to recommend that the City
purchase the Property for purposes of water supply protection and conservation. A copy of the
Water Board’s vote is attached.
I recommend that the City Council authorize the City Manager to purchase the Property on
behalf of the City of Cambridge for water supply protection and conservation purposes from
previously appropriated funds, and to execute any and all necessary documents on behalf of the
City to effectuate this purchase in such form and substance as the City Manager determines is
necessary or advisable.

I further recommend that the City Council vote to diminish the full disposition process pursuant
to Cambridge City Code §2.110.010(g) for the disposition of the property interest to be granted
by the City through the conservation restriction to the Lincoln Conservation Commission. I
recommend that the City Council vote to grant the permanent conservation restriction for the
purpose of protecting the Property from development and from other uses that might be
detrimental to the City’s water supply and conservation purposes, and vote to authorize the City
Manager to execute any and all necessary documents on behalf of the City related to the
conservation restriction in such form and substance as the City Manager determines is necessary
or advisable.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-13, regarding next steps on implementation of
Universal Pre-K, received from Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff reports the
following:
The Birth to 3rd Grade (B3) Partnership is an organized system of support with the vision to ensure that
high quality, early learning experiences are affordable and accessible to all children and families creating
a seamless experience beginning with prenatal care through the early elementary years. Through these
experiences, children will maximize their full potential academically, socially, emotionally, and
physically.
In the five years since its inception, the cornerstones of Birth to 3rd Third Grade Partnership’s work has
included (1) funding scholarships for preschoolers from low-income families so that they may attend high
quality preschool at one of over a dozen community-based early learning centers; (2) the quality
improvement program that supports early learning centers and home-based child care providers in
achieving higher levels of quality through coaching, mentoring, and funding for upgraded materials; (3)
professional development for the early childhood workforce that includes access to college coursework,
professional learning communities, communities of practice, and (4) workshops on a variety of content
areas; and strengthening the connection between the early childhood community and health, mental
health, and home visiting programs across the city.
The work to begin development of a Universal Pre-K (UPK) plan was intended to follow the December
2019 Roundtable with the City Council and School Committee where the City Manager and
Superintendent of Schools and their teams presented the report of the Universal Pre-Kindergarten Study
commissioned by the City and Schools. That report analyzed and evaluated two different models of UPK
programs for four-year olds and recommended a preferred model and a framework of essential elements
required to build a high quality UPK system. The preferred model, which was endorsed by the City
Manager and Superintendent of Schools, was a mixed-delivery system in which UPK would be offered
through a network of providers, including the Cambridge Public Schools, Human Services and
community-based programs. This was the most common model nationally and is the model being
proposed by the Biden Administration in its proposed plan.

Packet Pg. 72

2.3

The report identified the critical elements of high quality UPK programs including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Meets the needs of families in term of location, hours, and weeks of care
Equity of access
Diverse, competent and consistent staff
Research-based curriculum
Developmentally appropriate indoor and outdoor learning spaces
Systems for establishing quality criteria and on-going evaluation
Robust family engagement and services

Right now, programs that serve 4 year-olds include the CPS JK, Special Start, Scholars College and
Montessori Programs, DHSP preschool programs, community-based programs, for-profit programs and
family childcare. One of the biggest challenges today is that Cambridge does not have enough capacity in
high quality programs to serve all 4 year-olds. Addressing this capacity issue requires addressing a
number of issues including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increasing the number of existing programs that meet the state quality rating standards
Expanding the number of Cambridge children served by Cambridge-based providers that also
serve children from outside Cambridge
Exploring changes in JK-K school programs to create 4 year-old classrooms
Increasing slots for 4 year-olds without displacing slots for 3 year-olds
Developing a pipeline of qualified teachers and career pathways with a focus on a diverse
workforce
Increasing workforce compensation
Implementing evidence-based curriculum

The City Manager committed at the December meeting that the City would begin the process to create a
Universal Pre-Kindergarten Program for Cambridge’s 4 year-olds. He acknowledged then that there
were multiple issues and decisions that would need to be addressed over the coming years and that the
annual operating costs for such a program could ultimately exceed 20 million dollars, not including
capital costs for any additional city or school classrooms.
The initial steps identified that evening to begin the process included:
•
•
•

•
•

Convening community-based providers for feedback and input
Convening Principals and JK/K teachers for feedback and input
Gathering additional data from Cambridge programs to understand how many program slots are
filled by Cambridge children and how many slots which are not dedicated to Cambridge children
could become dedicated
Gathering more data about the Cambridge pre-school workforce including credentials and
compensation
Gathering information and feedback from families about their needs and interests

Packet Pg. 73

2.3

Before the pandemic upended services and planning, there was a convening with the City Manager and
the Superintendent of Schools and their teams with over 80 leaders and staff of community-based
providers. In that session, there was lots of excitement and numerous concerns about how the creation of
UPK, even as a mixed delivery system, would impact existing programs. For example, most programs
serve 3 and 4 year-olds in mixed age classrooms and concerns were expressed about whether a new
system would require serving 4 year olds separately. We made the commitment then to continue to work
with programs as we moved forward.
None of the additional steps that would have begun in 2020 or been continued in 2021 were able to move
forward because of the impact of the pandemic. Teachers and Principals were focused appropriately on
serving students virtually and then in person. Community-Based programs were struggling to figure out
how and whether to re-open. Those programs that re-opened were serving smaller groups of children and
so gathering data about slots, who was in them and how that might be able to be changed did not make
sense during the pandemic.
While it is still a challenging moment for schools and preschool programs, we expect to be able to begin
the planning work as we had hoped to do in 2020. The list of tasks to begin the work remains the same.
And many critical efforts did move forward despite the pandemic that support the city’s effort to expand
high quality preschool opportunities for 4 year-olds.
First, the City has continued to explore opportunities to expand capacity for pre-school programs serving
3 and 4 year-olds. As the City Council knows, Just a Start has been working on expanding its housing
development at 402 Rindge Avenue together with additional space for employment and training and other
community needs. The City has been working with Just A Start to support creation of 4 additional
preschool classrooms that would serve some of the unmet need for preschools, especially in North
Cambridge. Just A Start is also engaged in planning around another housing development on New Street
and the City has been working with Just A Start to explore whether two additional preschool classrooms
could be built as part of that development. These classrooms are in addition to the 4 new classrooms
being designed as part of the Tobin/Vassal Lane project.
Second, the City committed to funding the expansion of Head Start’s four Cambridge classrooms to fullday, full-year programs to better meet the needs of low-income families. Head Start was not able to open
in person over the last year but has continued to support children and families virtually. Head Start is
working with the Birth to 3rd Partnership now to reopen sites for the fall. In addition, the City has been
working with the Cambridge Housing Authority to renovate or replace the Head Start classrooms as part
of the Jefferson Park housing development so that the spaces for Head Start will be exemplary early
childhood classrooms.
Third, the City has through its own preschool programs shifted both the cost structure and the economic
mix of the families represented in the programs. As a result of the preschool lottery, 50% of the children
served through the City programs are now low income. The tuition each family pays is based on their
income so that depending on family income, tuition is between 1% and 8% of family income.

Packet Pg. 74

2.3

Fourth, the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has also created a new School Readiness Manager position that
is in the process of being filled. The School Readiness Manager will lead the effort to ensure a seamless
transition from the wide variety of early childhood settings in the community to the public school system.
A key role of this individual will be to support the Executive Director in the UPK planning work. The
Executive Director will work closely with the Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education, the
School Department’s Chief Financial Officer and the Assistant City Manager for Human Services in
moving forward the planning process. We look forward to reporting back to the City Council and to the
School Committee on the progress of that work.
Although the planning work has not moved forward, it is important not to lose sight of how critically
important the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has been this year in helping to prevent an even greater loss
of programming for young children. Although the expansion of programming and the launching of the
UPK planning process was impacted by the pandemic, the Birth to 3rd team was able to provide deep
support to its program quality and scholarship sites without having any of those sites permanently close as
happened with other early childhood providers within the city, state, and nationally. Community-based
early childhood programs and home-based providers alike credit the guidance and support of The Birth to
3rd Grade Partnership for their ability to adjust to the changing state child care requirements, continue to
serve children and families, and to survive and thrive during the very tumultuous public health and
economic crisis this year has brought; a time in which equity and access across our society became
glaringly more evident. This qualitative information demonstrates the positive impact the work of the
Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has on the early childhood workforce, children, families, and the broader
community.

RE:

The Tree Protection Ordinance and supporting regulations.

Please find attached further proposed amendments to the Tree Protection Ordinance and draft
regulations that are expected to be issued by the Commissioner for Public Works in connection
with the Ordinance, as discussed at the City Council meeting of March 21st, 2021 and the
Ordinance Committee meeting of April 28th, 2021. Further to the discussions at the Ordinance
Committee meeting of April 28th, 2021, the draft regulations have been updated to reflect the
outcome of that meeting with special consideration being provided to the Mitigation Section as
it applies to Significant Tree removals. The draft regulations are what is currently proposed but
there may be further changes before they are promulgated. If there are further changes, we
will submit a final version for your information.
The Tree Protection Ordinance provides the Commissioner for Public Works with the authority
to promulgate regulations to further the provisions of the Ordinance. It is the intention of the
attached draft regulations to accomplish that task. It is also recognized that moving forward
the regulations will be subject to further change as the implementation of the Ordinance
evolves and as the application of the provisions are field tested in the community.
The 2019 Amendment to the 2004 Tree Protection Ordinance addressed the removal of
Significant Trees in other areas of the community outside those associated with large projects,
which were the subject of the original Ordinance. In doing so the 2019 Amendment required
those who wanted to remove Significant Trees in those other areas to obtain a permit from the
Department of Public Works, but restricted the granting of any such permits to rare
circumstances associated with dead or dangerous trees, emergencies and other exceptional
situations. At this time, given that the Urban Forestry Master Plan has been completed, the
proposed amendments before the City Council will allow for permits to be issued more broadly,
but in doing so will identify more trees as being Significant Trees (6 inches and above), attach
more value to very large trees (30” and above) and incentivize replanting as the most
advantageous form of mitigation.

Table 1: Mitigation payments for each of the four Options reviewed at the Ordinance Committee hearing 4/28/21.

At this time, after consideration at the recent Ordinance Committee meeting, Mitigation Payment
Option 4 of the four options reviewed has been recommended for adoption by the City Council as the
best mitigation procedure proposed for “ Other Significant Tree Removals” under proposed Section
8.66.070 of the Ordinance. This procedure will not apply to “Large Projects”. As is illustrated in Table
1, for most of the scenarios presented, Option 4 provides the greatest incentive to plant an equal
number of Replacement Trees to substitute for the Significant Trees removed. By replanting, the cost
to the property owner is most reduced. It should be noted that Option 2 in Table 1 is the same
mitigation payment as that which will apply to Large Projects and that the cost figures shown are for
instances where a residential exemption has not been applied.
Finally, in response to the motion forwarded to the City Council by the Ordinance Committee that the
amended Ordinance use appropriate gender-neutral pronouns, the proposed amendments for the
Ordinance submitted herewith reflect these changes. Additionally, some concern was also expressed by
members of the Ordinance Committee whether the initial language proposed for Option 4 accurately
reflects the procedure associated with this option. Given that concern, staff have further reviewed that
language and propose for City Council the following substitute language:
“A Mitigation Payment will be required for all Significant Trees removed where an insufficient quantity
of Replacement Trees is provided. Where no Replacement Trees are proposed the Mitigation Payment
of equivalent value shall be based on the total DBH of the Significant Trees to be removed and 1.5 times
the total DBH of Exceptional Trees to be removed from the Lot. When Replacement Trees are planted
on a lot, the Mitigation Payment will be based on one-half of the DBH difference between each
Significant Tree removed and each Replacement Tree planted to replace it on a one-for-one basis. This
calculation will start with the smallest Significant Tree to be removed and then proceed in ascending
order based on the sizes of the additional Significant Trees to be removed. This calculation will also
value Exceptional Trees at 1.5 times their total DBH. When the number of Replacement Trees planted

The City of Cambridge Commissioner for Public Works (“the Commissioner”) hereby adopts the
following Tree Protection Ordinance Regulations pursuant to the Tree Protection Ordinance, Title 8,
Chapter 8.66 of the Cambridge Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”).
1.

Identifying a Significant Tree.

If the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the stem of a tree at four point five (4.5’) feet above the
ground is equal to or greater than six (6”) inches, then the tree is a Significant Tree.
2.

Measuring DBH (Diameter at Breast Height).

At a distance four point five (4.5’) feet above the ground, DBH can be measured with a specially
calibrated diameter tape, often referred to as a d-tape, that displays the diameter measurement when
wrapped around the circumference of a tree.
Alternatively, the following process can be used:
a.

DBH for a Single Stem Tree:

At a distance four point five (4.5’) feet along the trunk, wrap a string around the tree trunk making sure
that the string is perpendicular to the trunk and tight around the trunk and mark the circumference on
the string. Measure the length of string to get the circumference of the tree. Convert the circumference
measurement to diameter by dividing the circumference by pi (3.14).

Mitigation Payments.
a.

For Large Projects:

The Mitigation Payment shall be calculated based on the total DBH of removed Significant Trees less the
total DBH of Replacement Trees. Exceptional Trees will be assessed at 1.5 times the total measured
value of their DBH.
b.

For Other Significant Tree Removals:

The Mitigation Payment shall be calculated as follows:
For each Replacement Tree planted to replace a Significant Tree the DBH difference between the
Significant Tree and the Replacement Tree shall be halved. This calculation shall start with the smallest
Significant Tree and then proceed in ascending order based on the sizes of the Significant Trees
removed. Exceptional Trees will be assessed at 1.5 times the total measured value of their DBH.
When the number of Replacement Trees exceeds the number of Significant Trees removed, each
additional Replacement Tree will be credited based on its DBH.
The following table provides examples of how Mitigation Payments are calculated for a variety of
different scenarios.
Example:
Scenario 5:

2 Significant Trees are removed; one is 8 inches DBH and one is 16 inches DBH.
3 Replacement Trees are to be replanted; each are 2 inches DBH.
Cost per DBH inch = $850 (subject to change based on City planting contract pricing).

this Special District 10 now heavily nonresidential in character, from those least in harmony with
the adjacent residential neighborhood and the residential uses ultimately desired in the district,
to those nonresidential uses most compatible with residential uses and ultimately to residential
uses exclusively. Therefore, in the Special District 10 the following additional uses not otherwise
permitted in the Residence C District shall be permitted as of right, provided the conditions set
forth below are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.31, no variance for use shall
be permitted in the Special District 10. For the purposes of Article 8.000 the Special District

proposed new use, or that first legally established use immediately preceding the
application for a proposed new use should the premises be vacant (provided that the
previous use was in operation within the two years immediately preceding the
application for a Certificate of Occupancy), is any Retail or Consumer Service
Establishment, Section 4.35; or any light Industry, wholesale business and storage
use, Section 4.37; or any heavy industry use, Section 4.38; and
b. The use shall occupy only that gross floor area meeting the use limitations of Paragraph
a above.
(3) All uses in Section 4.37, light industry, wholesale business, and storage, Paragraphs a and
b shall be permitted, but only if the following conditions are met:
a. The use existing at the time of application for a Certificate of Occupancy for the
proposed use, or that first legally established use immediately preceding the
application for a Certificate of Occupancy for a proposed new use should the
premises be vacant (provided that the previous use was in operation within the two

residential use which is less than fifty (50) percent of the total gross floor area of the building
within which it is located, that residential use may be replaced by any one of the permitted uses
in Paragraphs (A) (1) - (3) above, which use shall thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of
this Section 17.107.
(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs (A) (1) - (3) above, in any structure containing a
use which is less than fifty (50) percent of the total gross floor area of the building within which it
is located, that use may be replaced by any one of the permitted uses in Paragraphs (A) (1) (3) above, which use shall thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of this Section 17.107.
(D) For structures satisfying the requirements of (B) above and in existence as of January 1, 1991,
the maximum gross floor area on a lot may be increased by an amount equal to twenty-five (25)
percent of the gross floor area present on the lot on January 1, 1991.

To the Honorable City Council:
The undersigned registered Cambridge voters respectfully request that the City Council ordain the
ordinance language set forth below relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation
Districts in the city.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access
21st Century Values for Neighborhood Conservation Districts
We invite you to join us in asking the City to improve the way that we create and operate Neighborhood
Conservation Districts in Cambridge. Intended to serve the worthy goals of helping communities to
preserve historic structures and maintain neighborhoods as they are, Neighborhood Conservation Districts
have too often been exploited unfairly as a means by which tiny, unrepresentative groups of residents can
exploit our city ordinances to control their neighbors’ choices and housing options. Recently in
Cambridge, we have seen small groups of homeowners initiate the process of establishing new
Neighborhood Conservation Districts in order to raise their property values, settle interpersonal disputes,
and restrict development potential below even that allowed by zoning. None of those purposes matches
Cambridge’s values, and yet that behavior is currently enabled by our City ordinances.
The current ordinance language was drafted 40 years ago and needs to be updated to reflect modern
community values related to diversity, access, equity, representation, and inclusion. The ordinance
governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts currently allows just ten
unrepresentative residents to launch a lengthy study of a Conservation District in an area that might be
home to thousands of residents and burden their homes with binding rules. A study can be initiated by the
appointed members Cambridge Historical Commission without any input or say so from our
democratically elected City Council. A study places binding rules on a neighborhood from the Historical
Commission that no one in the neighborhood outside of the Historical Commission’s Study Commission
has approved of or consented to, and, according to an opinion issued by City Solicitor Nancy Glowa,
those rules can remain in place for as many years as the Historical Commission wants to study them. The
membership appointed to the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions in no way reflects the
diversity of their neighborhoods with age, race, ethnicity, renter status, or a host of other factors, tending
to confer additional power and privilege to the already powerful and privileged.
This petition proposes changes to the ordinance governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood
Conservation Districts with a view to increasing the democratic legitimacy of our Conservation Districts
by empowering the members of the neighborhoods they govern and by introducing essential democratic
checks and balances to the process. The main goals of this petition are:

•
•

•

Increasing the democratic threshold required to begin a Conservation District Study
Ensuring that the goals of Neighborhood Conservation District are balanced with other City goals
of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all City neighborhoods and the need to address the housing
supply and cost crisis
Ensuring that the democratically elected City Council has a voice in starting a new study

Packet Pg. 141

3.1
•
•

Ensuring that the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and the rules governing
Neighborhood Conservation Districts are reflective of the diversity of our neighborhoods
Ensuring that no binding rules are imposed on neighborhoods without the consent of the governed

We find no fault with the intent behind the original ordinance language, and we believe that it likely
represented the best thinking of the times to solve a social problem of importance to the community.
However, the world has learned a lot in the past forty years. Everyone in this city has learned a lot. And
we believe that the ordinance changes proposed below will help to better accomplish the ordinance’s
original goals by modernizing our Neighborhood Conservation Districts in accordance with our modern
values and increased understanding of the moral requirement for diversity, access, affordability, equity,
representation, and inclusion throughout community life.
We respectfully request ordination of the below changes to the language of Chapter 2.78 Article III.
Underlined sections represent the petitioners’ proposed new wording and struck through sections
represent proposed deletions.

To the Honorable City Council:
The undersigned registered Cambridge voters respectfully request that the City Council ordain the
ordinance language set forth below relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood
Conservation Districts in the city.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access
21st Century Values for Neighborhood Conservation Districts
We invite you to join us in asking the City to improve the way that we create and operate Neighborhood
Conservation Districts in Cambridge. Intended to serve the worthy goals of helping communities to
preserve historic structures and maintain neighborhoods as they are, Neighborhood Conservation
Districts have too often been exploited unfairly as a means by which tiny, unrepresentative groups of
residents can exploit our city ordinances to control their neighbors’ choices and housing options.
Recently in Cambridge, we have seen small groups of homeowners initiate the process of establishing
new Neighborhood Conservation Districts in order to raise their property values, settle interpersonal
disputes, and restrict development potential below even that allowed by zoning. None of those
purposes matches Cambridge’s values, and yet that behavior is currently enabled by our City ordinances.
The current ordinance language was drafted 40 years ago and needs to be updated to reflect modern
community values related to diversity, access, equity, representation, and inclusion. The ordinance
governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts currently allows just ten
unrepresentative residents to launch a lengthy study of a Conservation District in an area that might be
home to thousands of residents and burden their homes with binding rules. A study can be initiated by
the appointed members Cambridge Historical Commission without any input or say so from our
democratically elected City Council. A study places binding rules on a neighborhood from the Historical
Commission that no one in the neighborhood outside of the Historical Commission’s Study Commission
has approved of or consented to, and, according to an opinion issued by City Solicitor Nancy Glowa,
those rules can remain in place for as many years as the Historical Commission wants to study them. The
membership appointed to the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions in no way reflects the
diversity of their neighborhoods with age, race, ethnicity, renter status, or a host of other factors,
tending to confer additional power and privilege to the already powerful and privileged.
This petition proposes changes to the ordinance governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood
Conservation Districts with a view to increasing the democratic legitimacy of our Conservation Districts
by empowering the members of the neighborhoods they govern and by introducing essential
democratic checks and balances to the process. The main goals of this petition are:







Increasing the democratic threshold required to begin a Conservation District Study
Ensuring that the goals of Neighborhood Conservation District are balanced with other City goals
of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all City neighborhoods and the need to address the housing
supply and cost crisis
Ensuring that the democratically elected City Council has a voice in starting a new study
Ensuring that the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and the rules governing
Neighborhood Conservation Districts are reflective of the diversity of our neighborhoods

Ensuring that no binding rules are imposed on neighborhoods without the consent of the
governed

We find no fault with the intent behind the original ordinance language, and we believe that it likely
represented the best thinking of the times to solve a social problem of importance to the community.
However, the world has learned a lot in the past forty years. Everyone in this city has learned a lot. And
we believe that the ordinance changes proposed below will help to better accomplish the ordinance’s
original goals by modernizing our Neighborhood Conservation Districts in accordance with our modern
values and increased understanding of the moral requirement for diversity, access, affordability, equity,
representation, and inclusion throughout community life.
We respectfully request ordination of the below changes to the language of Chapter 2.78 Article III.
Underlined sections represent the petitioners’ proposed new wording and struck through sections
represent proposed deletions.

Awning(s)
Description of Proposed Work

Retractable awning to go across the front because due to covid we have pastry cases in windows, and even though it is refrigerated
the sun shines in and melts product. We would keep awning open from approx 8am-2pm on days we are open, as this is when sun
hits our front window. And shut when it is cold and other times. That's why we want a retractable one.
Estimated Cost of Awning(s) in dollars

2500
Describe any existing signs or awnings that will remain (including the size of the remaining signs/awnings).

We have one sign that is 4' across. We have approx 12 feet of window space. The 4' sign is from an old location, we never bought a
new larger profile one for this location.

Cambridge City Council approval may be required.
Will one or more of the proposed signs extend six (6) inches
into the public sidewalk?

Yes

You must submit a Projected Sign Application and Abutter's

BDS

Israel has a right to exist and protect itself from harm. Israel gives so much to the Arab world in terms of jobs, excellent
health care, and peace. Israel is NEVER the first to attack. Iron Dome is an excellent way to protect what is theirs. Why
is it okay for the Palestinians to attack Israel? Israel is supportive of so many different religions and is such a small
country. Israel should be commended and not have BDS. Israel has done nothing wrong. Perhaps the Palestinians and
other Arab nations should take responsibility for their actions and turn a new leaf. Israel has managed to make an oasis
amongst the sand and is constantly reinventing ways for use of waterways and water conservancy. What has the Arab
nations given to the world? Stand up for Israel otherwise we could have nowhere safe to live as Jews. Remember the
old adage of “I turned my back when neighbors disappeared, I turned my back when books were burned”. I hope since
WWII we have learned of the importance of a viable Jewish Homeland. Where would the Ethiopian Jews have gone if
not Israel? Where would Russian Jews have emigrated to if not Israel? Israel is a dynamic country filled with wonderful
health care, advanced science that benefits everyone. So, please do no harm to our Jewish homeland and resist the
BDS.
Thank you for your time,

City of Cambridge resolution to support BDS

Dear Cambridge City Councillors and Clerk,
It is very distressing to me that our city is choosing to speak through the platform of BDS (Boycott, Divestment,
Sanctions), on a matter of humanitarian crisis and international concern: the violence between Palestinians and Israelis.
This discord strikes at our hearts and impels us to take action. However, how the City Council has chosen to act, through
an alliance with the organization BDS, is flawed. It is one thing to demand that the United States government stop
economic support to all violent factions, but it is another for us, our city, to be drawn into association with BDS and into
its sphere of influence.
It must not be ignored that BDS denies the right of the State of Israel to exist. It is unconscionable that our city would
accept this precept.
I view this desire to become aligned with BDS as offensive to the stated desire of Cambridge to respect all humanity and
foster non-discrimination in all aspects of life. I feel truly let down by the City Council for advancing this proposal.
Sincerely,
Barbara Appignani
Cambridge, MA

Written comments for city council meeting agenda-OPPOSE BDS

To whom it may concern:
I am a member of the Temple Beth Shalom community and local resident, writing in opposition to the
Cambridge BDS resolution targeting Hewlett Packard and the resolution supporting US House Resolution
2590.
As a Jew of Egyptian origin, I have many strong ties to people living in Israel. My uncle, who was born and
raised in Egypt, was held in an Egyptian concentration camp for 3 years. Like the other Egyptian Jewish
prisoners who had committed no crime, my uncle was tortured and humiliated. After surviving the trauma
he experienced from the Egyptian government, my uncle arrived as a refugee in Israel and, like millions of
other Jewish refugees from across the Middle East and the world, has built a new life there. Boycotting
Israel or companies doing business with Israel means collectively punishing millions of Jewish and Palestinian
citizens of Israel.
As a strong supporter of Palestinian human rights, I am concerned that the BDS movement, which opposes a
two state solution, will only strengthen radical, anti-peace elements in Israeli and Palestinian societies.
I urge the city council to oppose these BDS resolutions, which will only further division and violence, and
instead support a peaceful resolution to this conflict.

I am writing in support of municipal broadband for the City of Cambridge. I feel this is an essential strategy for
digital equity and is a hugely important investment to make sure Cambridge stays on the cutting edge of technology.
Frankly, after 6 years of discussing this for Cambridge, I cannot believe that we have NOT done a feasibility study. We
should not be handing this money to Comcast. Fiber should be a public utility like electricity or phone lines.

City Clerk; City Council
proposed resolutions pertaining to the Middle East

To the City Council,
As a voter in Cambridge, I am writing in staunch opposition to the Council's plan a) to secure alternative vendors to
Hewlett Packard because of its purported role in the Middle East and b) to support House Resolution 2590. When I vote
for members of the Council, I expect them to address matters pertaining to the betterment of life in Cambridge and NOT
to advocate a foreign policy position on the Middle East.
While I strongly disagree with both propositions, I firmly believe that the issues are too complex to be decided by the
City Council of Cambridge. Minutes of the meeting that took place on May 17 show that there are many more items to
occupy the Council's attention toward improving conditions in our city.
If the Council is so interested in taking positions on foreign affairs and standing against oppression, by the way, why are
you not also seeking to boycott Chinese-related companies to protest China's oppression of the Uyghars or the Chinese
occupation of Tibet? What about protesting Saudi Arabian-connected concerns because of the Saudi maltreatment of
women?
When city councilors run for office, they usually publicize their positions on such local matters as housing, environment,
education, jobs, transportation, traffic, and resident population groups, to name but a few. The longstanding IsraeliPalestinian conflict should not be a matter for Cambridge councilors to decide in City Council meetings. If you make it
one, you will not be representing my interests as a Cambridge voter or those of my family and friends who live here.
Sincerely,
Ellen Birnbaum

Against discrimination of Israeli people and Jewish people

Dear Cambridge city council,
I was horrified to learn about the false accusations that you undertake against the Israeli people.
Israeli children are being shooted and attacked by the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.
I am Israeli and I saw the faces of the frightened children in South cities and from the central cities and from the north,
are being attacked at night and at day, forced to hide, or to lay on the floors and asking their mothers "why?". " What
did we do that Palestinians want to shoot us?" . It seems to me that the democratic and humanitarian city council should
come forward and speak in favor of these children, too.
It seems to me that the City council was led by fake news and haven't learnt the facts. Did you know that the Hamas is
shooting their artillery from the multi story citizens buildings? Did you know that the Palestinian rockets are being shot
from their Palestinian people homes, from the schools and kindergartens? Building armed tunnels beneath
kindergartens? Did you know that the Israeli army is warning the Palestinians and loudly announcing three times before
the attack that the citizens should flee? No, haven't the Palestinian media informed about that? Of course not. They are
sending their teenagers to become jihaddists, to kill themselves. They are shooting rockets from houses and
kindergartens.
It is praiseworthy that the Cambridge city is protecting Palestinian children while their own parents and government are
placing them in the front lines of wars.
However, it looks not competent for the City council holding the Harvard university to not learn the facts.

Hello Everybody, I wrote and submitted the following Written Comment to be added to the May 16th Cambridge School
Committee(CSC), I'm uncertain if the Written Comment got on it or not. So I Have decided to share it on this blog with CCTV's
viewers and readers base. This Written Comment concerns my attempts to have the CSC to create a New pilot Curriculum that
links Homelessness with Poverty. The Written Comment is as follows:
Peace Be Unto To You,
I’m Hasson Rashid, I reside in Cambridge, MA. In this Written Comment, I’m reaching out to you and your office, with an idea to
create a New Pilot Curriculum on Homelessness and how it links to Poverty. I would like the City and School Committee of
Cambridge, MA to address the idea of piloting a New Curriculum that links Homelessness to Poverty. Education is crucial for
getting ahead in life, making good, and being respected. The enactment of a pilot curriculum that will help bring awareness of
the links between Homelessness and Poverty, and help in ensuring that homeless educational rights are observed and
respected, in Cambridge, MA.

PROPOSAL MODEL TO CREATE A NEW PILOT CURRICULUM PROGRAM IN THE CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS
SCHOOL DISTRICT, THAT LINKS HOMELESSNESS TO POVERTY, AND A RELATING ADVISORY TASK FORCE:
Historically, the experiences of homelessness in the United States (US) of America (USA), has been excluded from the
environment of formal educational learning. Mainly, because an appropriate curriculum, depicting the history and domestic life
experiences of homelessness, has been non-existent in the formal educational arena and learning environments. This new
proposed pilot curriculum must have components that deconstruct those concepts that are destructive to one’s effective
academic development and empowerment. This means that students must know how homelessness in the United States of
America came to be, and how those experiencing homelessness spend their time. Telling the story in this manner will probably
offend the sensibilities of some,who feel that such a story is not appropriate for the young and some of the old. To understand
this story the story of the US’s historic relationship to peoples of homelessness, is necessary to create a context for what
constitutes unique educational needs.Such stories of homelessness are not unique to the US’s experiences, but this is an
important part of education, locally,statewide, and nationally. For US students to begin to learn about homelessness experiences
in such a way, sets a context for appropriate education.
There should be no hesitation in adoption by our educational and municipal policy makers, and in teaching, and describing early
and thoroughly, the outcome of what the homelessness experience has been locally, statewide, and nationally. There is no
reason why students shouldn’t be formally taught to know about the history and knowledge of the homelessness experience in
the US, etc., in order to be effectively educated, and this is the major focus of this newly proposed model pilot curriculum.
PROPOSED BENEFITS OF A PILOT CURRICULUM THAT LINKS HOMELSSNESS TO POVERTY:
• To serve as an educational vehicle by which conscious knowledge is transmitted.
• Real education and what it is supposed to do.
• Correction of the flaws and fallacies, in the educational system that pertains to homelessness.
• Reveal the hidden fact, and develop a compelling argument that begins to include those crucial pieces, which have been
excluded from the educational system in regards to homelessness.
• Add the history and experience, on homelessness that have been excluded from the educational and learning environment in
the US, etc.
• Build respect for the autonomy of the homelessness sector and mosaic through formal education.
• Building of a functional and correct, formal education on homelessness in the US (locally, statewide, nationally).
• Promoting the welfare of all peoples, and advancing the critical growth of education and knowledge about homelessness.
• Education to advance the well being of the peoples involved in the process.
• Offering new information and innovative information about homelessness that has been excluded or distorted in the existing
educational arenas ( local, statewide, nationally).
• Counter earlier errors, remain true to the particular interest of a special group of learners and offer a balanced perspective that
permits education and knowledge to grow.
• Homelessness centric education, critical through the educational ideas of holistic contributions, ultimately brought into balance
through the studies, with a more universal perspective.
• Development of an appropriate pilot curriculum on homelessness, with links to poverty for the academic and educational
arena.
• Inclusion of studies on homelessness into the current local educational system.
• Fair and equitable information on homelessness that the arena of ideas in the current educational system doesn’t have.
• The proposed new pilot curriculum to represent a kind of synthesis that ultimately advances education and knowledge,as a
more accurate portrayal of what is truth.
• The proposed new pilot curriculum as the introduction of information that permits students, and the school district to see the
presence of homelessness in our midst, that expands awareness of what is obviously true.
• The proposed new pilot curriculum on homelessness, linking to poverty, a unique contribution to the development of education
and knowledge, for all humanity.
There is room for this kind of pilot curriculum in our local school district’s educational system. This kind of academic and
educational achievement can only come from the kind of educational system that is able to see broadly from more than one
perspective. This new approach to education about homelessness, should not only enhance the education of our local school
district here in Cambridge Massachusetts, but it should offer some new and more effective models for the education of peoples
in general. The new pilot curriculum will hold concepts from a holistic paradigm that could benefit all students in the local school
district. It will be an example of how a contribution to overall growth of human knowledge and education, is made from this
approach. The new proposed pilot curriculum will have components, that deconstruct the concepts, that are destructive to one’s
effective development and empowerment.

Packet Pg. 243

Finally, the expansion of the story about homelessness in the United States of America, into the universal story of all humanity,
is the ultimate responsibility that our local school district’s educational system must afford, and this becomes the role of our local
school and municipal policy makers, to help in the integration of the unique experiences of those affected by homelessness, into
the universal human experiences. Therefore, the proposed New Pilot Curriculum on Homelessness,linked to poverty, will
become part of the search for universal truth, that is a part of the task for our local school district and municipal policy makers,
and members of our right thinking public humanity at large.

Against Agenda Item P.O. #6, (POR 2021 #109)

Hello,
I'm writing to voice my concern at the proposition of a boycott of goods from companies based in Israel. As a
new Cambridge resident, I was excited to move to such a welcoming community, even during the middle of a
pandemic. However, support of this bill would push past that welcome with a grim message that people like me
are not.
The bill in question calls for a boycott of HP, on the basis of its provision of computers to the Israeli military, part of a
larger BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement. BDS is, in their own words, dedicated to “the end of the
Jewish state.” and so advocate a wide range of proposals that are designed to isolate, delegitimize and gradually
undermine Israel. BDS initiatives have been rejected by national and Massachusetts leaders, including Barack Obama,
Bernie Sanders, Keith Ellison, Cory Booker, John Kerry, Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren, Michael Capuano, Joe Kennedy,
Deval Patrick and scores more prominent national leaders, including governors of all 50 states.
Mass Against HP seeks to boycott Israel under the guise of supporting Palestinian human rights. We all agree that the
Palestinian people deserve a full range of human rights, and their current situation is of profound concern; requiring our
attention and our proactive efforts. However, describing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as “apartheid” and describing a
need for solidarity with Palestinians “killed by airstrikes”, to the exclusion of Israelis killed by terror attacks, hides the
reality that the current violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories is a security response to riots and rocket strikes
organized by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed terror group. These organizations initiated rocket
attacks on Israeli civilians and have encouraged civilians to buy knives to cut off Jewish heads. The City Council
resolution expresses a one-sided version of this violent reality and ignores Israel’s right to self-defense when under
attack--a right that it’s impossible to imagine the US foregoing if attacked by thousands of rockets.
If the Cambridge City Council elects to adopt a foreign policy that it applied without prejudice to nations and companies
around the world, the issue of an ethical double standard would not be raised. Singling out Israel and HP, amongst all the
nations, companies and conflicts in the world, and holding them to a unique ethical standard raises troubling issues about
the Cambridge City Council. More importantly, by aligning itself with a movement that oversteps the bounds of legitimate
criticism of Israel (for which there surely is a place) into the territory of antisemitism, the Cambridge City Council sends a
strong message that I, and people like me, are unwelcome here. As I walked by a pro-BDS protest a few days ago, I was
struck by signs emblazoned with "Jews into the sea". Not Zionists, not Israelis. Jews. Aligning with the BDS movement
would be a statement on behalf of the City of Cambridge, and each member of the city council, that they support this kind
of messaging.
This resolution has failed in the past and its passage this session would be understood as a condemnation of Israel’s current
campaign to defend itself. Such a move would be tone deaf in the face of ongoing terror against Israelis and the fear that
many Cantabrigians have facing rising antisemitism at home.
Thank you for listening,
Julia

Opposition to BDS Resolutions

I am writing to oppose the two resolutions on the City Council agenda for May 24, 2021 that relate to boycott,
divestment, and sanctions (BDS) against the State of Israel.
While these resolutions may be well-founded in a desire to oppose the ill-treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli
Government and to support their right to dignity and self-determination, the BDS movement in the United States has
been wielded as a weapon against Jews over the past decade. It promotes Holocaust denial. It has driven Jew-hatred,
antisemitic vandalism, and discrimination on campuses and in communities. I have witnessed BDS and debate over BDS
used to marginalize Jews in Berkeley, CA before, and even as someone who opposes the occupation and right-wing
ethnonationalism in Israel, it made me feel unsafe and less welcome when I lived there.
Were these resolutions at all likely to change the situation on the ground, these indignities for American Jews might be
worth it, but nothing the Cambridge City Council does can make anything better for the Palestinians. The Council's
responsibility is to the people of Cambridge, and insofar as it cannot impact the day-to-day reality of life in Israel, the
West Bank, or Gaza, its only role should be to make its constituents feel supported and welcome, be they of Israeli or
Palestinian decent, Jewish, or Muslim.
I hope the Council rejects these resolutions. If it must comment on at all on a two-sided racial and religious conflict - one
where some of its constituents will blame all of the atrocities on "oppressors" and some on "terrorists" (and both would
be wrong), I hope it is in a way that makes all Cantabrigians feel valued, not vilified.
Sincerely,
Joe Zissman

Policy Order 6

Dear City Council members,
I am a Cambridge resident. I want to urge the city council of Cambridge to vote yes on this policy to end business ties
with HP Enterprise and HP Incorporated until the companies stop supporting oppression and the violation of human and
civil rights.
As someone who strongly supports Cambridge's sanctuary city status, I believe Cambridge should honor that status by
not contracting with HP Enterprises, given the role these companies have played in creating technology ICE uses to
track, detain, and deport immigrants. Immigrants’ rights matter to me personally, because of my own family came to
America in the 1980s from China, and I know that some of their hardships here are many immigrants hardships.
Particularly lower income immigrants or those fleeing violent states are the most vulnerable groups we have
responsibility to protect.
Additionally I support this order because HP Enterprise and HP Inc. support the Israeli government's institutionalized
violence against and oppression of Palestinians.
I urge the city council to vote YES on this order. Thank you so much for your time,
Katherine Wu

Support Israel and Local Jewish Community

The BDS resolution is total nonsense. It could actually hurt Palestinians more than Israelis (as did the BDS campaign
against SodaStream, which cost 500 Palestinians their jobs).
House Resolution 2590 is very poignant and persuasive. However, it completely ignores the role that Hamas plays in
teaching Palestinian children to hate, the way that Hamas employs children and other civilians as human shields, and the
way that Hamas recruits teen-agers as "soldiers".
I am very concerned particularly about the BDS resolution that it can result in tensions within our communities between
Jews and Moslems, and to cause Jewish people to feel uncomfortable. Further, it impedes the cooperation and co
existence that is so essential to any western society.
Israel has a population that is approximately 20% moslem, and so any action against Israel, impacts all of its citizens.
Further, the recent violence from Gaza has been targeting the Palestinan Authority in the West Bank, in a phased
attempt to seize control due to Abbas's age. This is really an intra-Palestinian struggle, and Jews should not be punished
by any western countries for it.
Thank you for your consideration.

"People of Jerusalem, we want you to cut o! the heads of the Jews with knives. With

These evil trials did not come from a video of ISIS. It was Fathi Hammad, a senior Hamas

As a murderous terrorist organization, Hamas has killed hundreds of Israelis and is
recognized by the American and European governments as a terrorist organization.
Unlike this, Israel, a small country in the Middle East, is the only Jewish state in the world,
and it is also the only democracy in the Middle East. Israel protects its citizens from
radical Islamic terrorism as any nation (including the United States) would do. While
Hamas launches thousands of rockets at Israeli civilians from within a civilian population
in Gaza in an e"ort to kill as many innocent civilians as possible, Israel attempts to
prevent this from happening.
IDF o!cers call houses where shootings are taking place or where Hamas terrorists are
operating to inform civilians that the house is about to be destroyed. A small bomb is
then dropped by an IDF plane on the rooftop to warn again, and only after making sure
there are no civilians within the building, the building is bombed by the IDF. As a result of
these strategies, Israel has not been able to harm a large number of terrorists who are
wanted for harming and killing Israelis (and Americans) citizens. No other army in the

Hamas and Palestinian organizations spread false information about what is happening
in Gaza. Many of the videos on social media originate from the Syrian civil war or are the
work of screenwriters who can work in Hollywood. Hamas exploits the empathy and lack
of knowledge of people in the conflict and distributes fake videos.
It is ridiculous that Cambridge is holding a hearing against the only Jewish state in the
world that fights against radical Islamic terrorism that the US and most European
countries have su"ered from it. Did Cambridge hold hearings against Syria when dictator
Bashar Assad was committing massacres of his own people? Has a hearing been held
against Iran, which murdered hundreds of activists protesting against the murderous
government? Or has a lawsuit been filed against China, which holds over a million
Muslims in prison to "re-educate" them?
What happened to the same activists when all of these actions occurred or are occurring
in the world? How come your voice is only heard when Israel responds to missiles which
are fired at its citizens? Aren't all human lives equal?
Hamas and Gaza received millions from American taxpayers. The money was intended to
build houses and pave roads. Instead, the money was "invested" in terrorist tunnels that
Hamas dug into the ground. The "metro" that Hamas built was not built for trains as in a
normal country, it was built for terrorists to move from one location to another, to kidnap
Israeli soldiers, and to break into Israeli communities adjacent to the fence and murder
civilians. Gaza receives electricity, water, and goods from Israel (even during the war,
Israel continued to send trucks with goods to Gaza and Hamas chose to shoot them).
Even though Gaza has a border with Egypt, Israel allows Palestinians to enter Israeli
territory for medical treatment in Israeli hospitals, and to work in Israel. In addition to the
tens of thousands of Palestinian Authority workers who entered Israel every day before
the war, more than 7,000 people from Gaza entered Israel daily to work. These are facts
that Palestinian representatives are trying to hide.
The poster distributed in advance of today's debate shows the dangerous and unbridled
hatred on which we are marching. On the poster, they paint the borders of Israel in the
colors of the Palestinian flag.
Is this your plea for peace, or is it for eradicating Israel altogether? To see this and hear in

Written Comments for City Council BDS Meeting

Dear City Clerk,
I would like to submit the comments below, in opposition to the BDS resolution, to be included in the agenda for the
upcoming city council meeting (on Monday May 24th at 5:30pm):
To the honorable members of the Cambridge city council:
As a longtime member of the Cambridge Jewish community, and a recent Harvard alum, I would like to express
my firm opposition to the proposed BDS resolution.
My family members are refugees from Iran who fled after the Iranian revolution out of fear that they would be
oppressed as a religious minority. My husband's family fled Egypt in 1970 after the Egyptian government
incarcerated all Egyptian Jewish men from ages 16 to 65 simply for being Jewish. Many members from both our families
eventually found refuge in Israel.
The BDS movement paints Jewish Israelis exclusively as colonizers and aggressors. In fact, most Jewish Israelis are or are
descended from refugees who have suffered government sponsored despotism, antisemitism, ethnic cleansing, and
genocide in Europe, the Arab world, and the broader Middle East.
I believe that a peaceful resolution to the conflict can only happen when both sides are fairly represented.
Sincerely,
Shana Attar

A Big Thank You!

Hello,
My name is Laboni Hoque, and I am a Harvard Medical School student working at the Cambridge Health Alliance. As a
physician-in-training, I have observed the importance of having stable housing on health outcomes. I wanted to
personally thank the council, particularly the leadership of Councillor Simmons as a co-sponsor, for passing the recent
bond policy order to support affordable home ownership in Cambridge. This policy order represents an amazing
commitment to improve the housing landscape and support currently unhoused populations.
At the same time, I was disappointed to hear that Cambridge increased the policing budget. This money could be better
spent supporting unhoused populations rather than the forces that actively harm many members of our community and
contribute to institutionally racist policies.
I hope that Cambridge can display a renewed commitment support unhoused populations in every action and policy
order passed.

Strong opposition to City of Cambridge resolution to support BDS

Dear Members of the Cambridge City Council and City Clerk,
I would like to register my strong opposition to the proposed City resolution advocating support for the BDS
movement. Our city must recognize that BDS is aligned with Hamas, a terrorist organization that denies Israel’s right to
exist, and that launches weapons deliberately intended to target civilians. There is no question that the Israeli response
to Hamas’s actions in this instance are disproportionately forceful, and must be stopped. It is also completely
appropriate to condemn the Israeli government for its actions in the current crisis. On the other hand, it is is completely
inappropriate for the City of Cambridge to single out Israel with an economic boycott, and to align itself with the BDS
movement. Other nations responsible for more egregious and sustained oppression and violent suppression are not
boycotted by the City of Cambridge. We should not let our desire to sanction the Netanyahu government devolve into
anti-semitism, and we should not drive a wedge between Jews and other ethnic groups in Cambridge, a City known for
its progressiveness in creating an inclusive and welcoming community.

Dear City Clerk,

To the honorable members of the Cambridge city council:
As a longtime member of the Cambridge Jewish community, and a recent MIT alum, I would like to express
my firm opposition to the proposed BDS resolution.
The history of the Israeli-Arab conflict is complex and both sides have tragically suffered violence at the hands
of the other. However, BDS seeks to exclusively blame Israel for the present conflict and paint it and its
supporters as aggressors. At the same time, BDS explicitly or implicity approves of violence against Israelis
and their supporters worldwide. For example, prominent BDS members include Rasmea Odeh (who bombed
an Israeli supermarket) and Leila Khaled (who hijacked a plane). I firmly believe that supporting the BDS
movement is not conducive to a lasting peace. Such a peace will necessarily require both sides to take
responsibility for the history of violence.

Thank you

Dear Cambridge City Council,
My name is Lynn Hur, and I am a Harvard Medical School student working at the Cambridge Health Alliance.
Several of my colleagues have already emailed, but I wanted to reach out to reiterate our gratitude to the
council, particularly the leadership of Councilor Simmons as a co-sponsor, for passing the recent bond policy
order to support affordable home ownership in Cambridge. In class and on the wards, we have heard firsthand
about the importance of having stable housing on the wellbeing of Cambridge residents. We are really excited
about this policy order and truly look forward to seeing the positive changes that will come from it.
Also similarly to my colleagues, I was disappointed to hear that Cambridge increased the CPD budget despite
our pleas to defund and divest this money toward initiatives that would strengthen our Cambridge community
- not further divide us. I would be very interested to hear about how the Council thinks that raising the police
budget will address issues such as chronic homelessness and racialized violence toward unhoused people, and
what else was considered when creating this budget. Even though there have not been police murders in
Cambridge recently, the trauma inflicted by police to POC in Cambridge is ever-present. The CPD's actions
continue to enforce who is deemed worthy of protection and safety in Cambridge, while sending the message
to our unhoused neighbors of color that they are not.
To conclude, thank you for taking an important first step toward addressing housing disparities. I am really
encouraged by this proposal and hope that Cambridge can commit to supporting unhoused populations in
every action and policy order passed, including through actions to defund the police.
Best,

Fwd: Peace in Israel

Hello,
I am a Cambridge resident and wanted to share my comments and opposition to the two anti-Israel motions in front of
the city council. Please include the following with this week's agenda/meeting content:
My issues with these motions are both the content and importantly, the timing, both of which implicitly support Hamas
in their war to murder Jews and destroy Israel.
I support Palestinians, their safety and wellbeing, and their rights. I am pained to see scenes of death and destruction in
Gaza, as we all are. I also unequivocally support the state of Israel and its right to exist. I am pained to see death and
destruction in Israel.
The current military conflict is one between Hamas - a terrorist group sworn to destroy Israel and kill the Jews who live
there, and Israel - trying to defend themselves. Hamas does not want peace and has made that very clear in their charter
and in their actions, and has made no claims otherwise. They fire missiles indiscriminately into civilian areas not as a
strategic military activity; rather, they do it to kill Jews. Killing Jews is their priority above all else, including the lives of
their own citizens (many of their missiles land in Gaza. Many are fired from schools, hospitals, apartments - areas where
Israeli retaliation will cause Palestinian deaths and further Hamas' cause).
When you time a BDS vote with a war between Hamas and Israel, you are putting your support behind Hamas. You are
supporting the terrorists. You deny Israel a right to exist. Hamas can fire missiles at Israeli civilians, but Israel has no right
to respond. Have any of the Cambridge councilors behind this BDS vote offered any opinion of what Israel could do to
respond to unrelenting rocket fire from Hamas? Certainly I hope and wish that Israel could have responded with a
strongly worded letter or threat and avoided bloodshed, leading to a ceasefire and eventual peace. More practically, I
wish and hope that Israel is using the absolute minimum response required to end Hamas missiles, but no less than what
is needed to do so. We have no military expertise nor inside knowledge of Hamas terrorist activities, and must rely on
the IDF to make this judgement call.
To reiterate- boycotting Israel in the middle of a conflict with Hamas is supporting Hamas.
While each of these two anti-Israel related motions include language about broadly supporting human rights, their
content and the timing of these motions belies their anti-Israel intent. I ask the city of Cambridge to clarify now that we
stand against terrorism and we support Israel's right to exist and defend itself against Hamas. To send this message, the
city should not support these motions as they are written at this time.

Thank you for emailing about the BDS related policy order on the agenda for the City Council tomorrow. I first heard of
the agenda items related to Israel/Palestine on Thursday night when we get the agenda. I was immediately concerned
especially since there was no widespread community notice beforehand. And with Shavuot about to start, it is
especially important that we do not discuss this policy order tomorrow. I will charter right the item, which will ensure
that discussion will be put off until the next meeting, which will be Monday May 24. If it makes sense to delay
discussion further, I am happy to work on it.

In addition to timing, I have concerns about the policy order as written due to singling out Israel.
Below is what I sent to people in my newsletter list. I am married to a Jewish man and our children identify as
Jewish. This matter is important to me personally. I criticize the government of Israel and find the recent violence
horrifying. And, I oppose BDS as a movement that is not in line with my vision of peace in the Middle East with a twostate solution.

There is another resolution on the agenda related to Israel Palestine, which asks the council to go on record supporting
a congressional bill titled The Palestinian Children and Families Act (H.R. 2590). I am not sure how to vote on that
resolution – it seems problematic and one-sided. I am interested in your thoughts not only on the BDS policy order,
but also the resolution supporting H.R. 2590. Please let me know.

From Councilor Nolan’s May 14 council updates:

RES #7 and PO #6: There are also two policy orders related to concerns in Israel-Palestine. I am
saddened and angry about the violence in the Middle East. And I do not support the actions of the
government of Israel or its current leader. I support the rights of Palestinians and a two-state
solution. And there are human rights violations and violence on both sides of that conflict. I also
believe it is important to note there are human rights abuses by many countries supported with some
of our taxpayer dollars - we need to be fair in our condemnations, and not single out just one
country.

Vote NO on the Anti-Israel Resolutions (POR 2021 #109 and RES 2021 #129).

To WhomThis May Concern,
I have been living in Cambridge for almost six years and am very disappointed that the Cambridge City Council is on the
cusp of being swayed by dishonest smears to attack Israel. I am also disgusted that the council held a session when
many Jews could not even attend a meeting and defend Israel against these vile attacks. This past Monday and Tuesday
were the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and religious Jews were prohibited from using their computers (and other electrical
appliances).
My grandmother immigrated to Palestine in 1925. Her family moved there as peaceful Hasidim to practice their faith
and live in peace. Moving to Israel saved her from the Holocaust! Her home would later become part of the Warsaw
Ghetto. But Palestine would not be a safe haven for her family. In 1929, her family had to hide in a bakery behind iron
doors to save themselves from Hebron Massacre. In this massacre, Jews were butchered to death by Palestinian rioters
who would not accept them. One of her childhood friends had to hide while the rest of her immediate family was
butchered to death by these rioters.
There is this fiction that the founding of the state of Israel created these frictions between Jews and Palestinians. The
fiction exclaims that "if only we can go back to the time before Israel, we will have peace and justice." This is a complete
lie!!!! Israel was founded, not only to serve as a haven for Jews suffering from persecution around the world, but also to
allow Jews to protect themselves from violent and ruthless neighbors who would not accept them.
This boycott will only embolden a cruel and craven hamas who claim that "Palestinian women and children make the
best human shields" (Hamas operator Fathi Hamad). Israel is fighting an enemy committing was crimes (firing rockets at
cities)that embeds itself in humanitarian locations like a hospital, childrens' schools, and news headquarters. Supporting
them by attacking Israel is the opposite of justice and hope the council reconsiders.

Public Comment, 24May21 POR 2021 #109, RES 2021 #129

For inclusion with the public comment of 24May21.
To City Council:
I have lived and worked in the wonderful city of Cambridge for the last eight years, and have found it to be a city of
intellectual discourse and acceptance. We have shared our Shabbat table with Jewish and non-Jewish friends, including
our neighbors, new friends from the Hoyt Field dog park, and colleagues. I live down the street from Mark McGovern
and probably even own a chair from his family house that was free for the taking.
I have been moved to reach out to the City Council for one of the few times in my Cantabrigian residence. Given that an
agenda including both BDS specifically for HP, and a one-sided declaration decrying Israeli violence that was held, of all
days, on a Jewish holiday, I feel unfortunately 'othered' by the members of the City Council. You have been complicit in
fracturing the community in our great city. I am expressly disturbed by Councilor Zondervan stating that "I appreciate
that it is the Shavuout holiday, but last week it was Eid. That didn't seem to prevent the Israeli government from
bombing and evicting and terrorizing Palestinian people". Councilor Zondervan, you have formally equated Jews and
Israel, and it is not hard to see how antisemitism evolves.
Re. POR 2021 #109. I am profoundly disappointed to see the City Council to even give credence to the harmful BDS
movement. BDS is a divisive movement that only seeks to single out Israel and cancel any attempt at discourse,
communication, and peace. BDS has been determined as antisemitic by many goverments and cities, and as a Jew, I get
to decide whether it feels that way to me. You want to boycott HP? Let's boycott all of the technology companies in the
Cambridge area that work with governments with questionable human rights, not just Israel.
Re. RES 2021 #129. Peace for a people should not come at the expense of others. Both Israelis and Palestinians are
suffering from the ongoing conflict, and this statement does not further the pursuit of peace.
Cambridge City Council, show me your resolutions asking for peace, community, and dialogue. Please do not continue to
promote and give credence to these resolutions.
Thank you,

End Cambridge's Business with Hewlett Packard!

Hi City Clerk of Cambridge,
My name is Veronica Bettio and I'm a fourth year student at Northeastern University. I'm of Palestinian-Lebanese
descent, my Sido (grandfather) fled Palestine during the Nakba in 1948 and eventually immigrated to Canada.
To the members of Cambridge's city council: thank you for this opportunity, and thank you for hearing the voices of the
public on the matter of Policy Order 109, which addresses the city's contract with Hewlett Packard and other companies
that profit from the apartheid and colonial occupation of Palestine. I, like many others, am asking you to vote yes on this
policy to end business ties with HP Enterprise and HP Incorporated. This is a direct result of their violations of human
rights and support of an apartheid state.
Cambridge must divest from these companies, which profit off of and support Israeli violence against Palestinians, and
systemic oppression and occupation of Palestinians. Again, my grandfather fled his home and left everything behind
because of Israeli violence and occupation. Justice requires that we boycott Israel and companies that support it.
The City of Cambridge and all members of this country have the obligation to contact only with companies that are
ethical, and respect human life and self-determination. Israel, and the companies that support it, are in violation of
International human right laws, and common morality.
Thank you for reading this.
Sincerely,
Veronica Bettio

Written comments for city council meeting agenda

Dear City Clerk,
I would like to submit the following comments, in opposition to the BDS resolution, to be included in the agenda for the
upcoming city council meeting:
To the honorable members of the Cambridge city council:
As a longtime member of the Cambridge Jewish community, and a recent MIT alum, I would like to express
my firm opposition to the BDS resolutions being debated in the Cambridge city council.
The BDS movement is a racist movement which actively opposes the two-state solution and seeks to boycott all of
Israel's citizens--Jews as well as Arabs--on both sides of the Green Line. Its only goal is to demonize and delegitimize the
state of Israel, and the right of Jewish people to live in Israel.
with great concern,
Oren Mangoubi

Comment on BDS Resolution

Dear Council members,
Please, include the following comment into the agenda for the City Council meeting on Monday
As a long time member of the Cambridge Jewish community, I want to speak out against the deeply offensive and
divisive campaign by the BDS movement to single out one group and one side in a very complex conflict. The BDS
movement has been trying to demonize and blame Israel while turning a blind eye to any violence directed against
Israel, and indeed against Jews in general. Concentrating on attacking one side leads to division and will only lead to
tension in the Cambridge community.
Sincerely,
Ursula Mangoubi

H.R. 2590/ BDS Resolution

To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my objection to the proposed bill. I have been a Cambridge resident for six years, and as far as I
am aware, the city of Cambridge places no divestments on products from any other countries, including those with
known human rights violations. While I support the rights of Palestinians and Palestinian children, this bill is likely to
harm the Israeli economy, while not addressing the real issue. While Hamas is in power and has access to weapons,
neither Israelis nor Palestinians are safe. International efforts should be aimed at eliminating Hamas, a recognized
terrorist group, so that Israelis and Palestinians can create lasting peace. The proposed bill will not bring us any closer to
peace.
Respectfully,
Shira Krimsky

Robust action on broadband in 2021

Dear Council members,
I'm an East Cambridge resident and have suffered a total of 15 years of weak competition in broadband service in
Cambridge. For me that's meant paying high prices to Comcast and receiving poor connection performance
(outages, most recently affecting East Cambridge and MIT in May 2021 for most of a day, low upload speeds due to
Comcast's legacy last-mile infrastructure) while spending time searching for alternative providers (recently NetBlazr &
Starry, who do not cover my location).
We just set up a new service (Verizon) at our vacation home in Marion, MA where optical fiber runs into the house and
service with very high upload and download speeds is available at lower cost than Comcast in Cambridge. I cannot
understand a rational basis why - in a large urban dense city full of students and information professionals - competition
is weak, data performance is poor, and costs are high, while in an outlying area of a small Massachusetts town there is
more competition, performance is great (including upload), and costs are low.
As we emerge from the pandemic, 2021 is a unique moment to take advantage of opportunities like making bold
progress on digital equity and data infrastructure in our city. This should include robust analysis of a
municipal broadband program and other options to give residents more choice in data services. Please do what you can
to ensure a whole-of-city-government push to generate options for Cambridge residents to most effectively share what
we have to offer with the rest of the world.

Homeownership Policy Order and Policing

Hello City Council,
My name is Reena Goswami and I’m a Harvard Medical School student, part of Harvard Students for Housing Justice and
working at the Cambridge Health Alliance. I am writing to thank the council and Councilor Simmons for their leadership
in passing the recent bond policy order to increase homeownership. Homeownership is an important determinant of
health, and this future policy order will ensure that more families in Cambridge can build wealth, and live stable,
healthier lives. Please read this recent op-ed our team wrote about the importance of this policy order!
With this achievement, I am disappointed that Cambridge voted to increase the policing budget rather than take
meaningful steps to defund it. Regardless of whether there have been police shootings in Cambridge, the reality is that
years of public health research shows the most effective way to prevent violence and crime is through social service
programs that ensure the basic needs of community members are met –healthcare, housing, food assistance,
employment opportunities, etc. Policing does not effectively address the root causes of crime – any dollar that goes to
policing is a waste that does not make our community a better place, but rather, harms its marginalized members.
Cambridge must urgently defund the police and transfer those funds to social programs. Until then, many of my
patients’ families will continue to be unable to meet their basic needs, while Cambridge spends an exorbitant amount of
funds on a system that harms them.
Respectfully,
Reena Goswami

Vote Against the racist anti-Semitic BDS resolution

Dear Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui,

Ms. Patricia M. Nolan
Ms. Denise Simmons

Mr. Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.

Vote Against the racist, anti-Semitic BDS resolution
As a long time former resident of Cambridge, and member of Temple Beth Shalom on
Tremont Street, and as a Jewish refugee from an Arab country, I would like to like to let
you know that BDS is no different than the Nazi Boycott of Jewish owned businesses prior
to the Second World War. This is not a Zionist Jew who says that. This is German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her party, a woman who knows what Nazism is, who is
known for her compassion towards refugees, and who opened Germany’s door to one
million Muslims fleeing Syria.
Specifically, from Chancellor Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party platform
“Who today under the flag of the BDS movement calls to boycott Israeli goods and
services speaks the same language in which people were called to not buy from
Jews. That [BDS] is nothing other than coarse anti-Semitism.”
This view is supported by professional intelligence agencies. For instance, a German
intelligence report from May 2018, states that boycotts of products from the Jewish state
are a “new variation of anti-Semitism.”
This is but one instance of a domestic intelligence agency labeling boycotts targeting
Israeli products as anti-Semitic and a security threat.
In this hateful proposal, we are seeing a collusion between left wing anti-Semitc hate
with neo-Nazis like David Duke, a former member of the American Nazi party and

founder of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a man who praised BDS on his website in
2013, writing, “Boycott of Zionist State Gathers Steam.”,
But the proposal is all the more injurious in that it is submitted during the Jewish Holiday of
Shavuot, a timing that makes it impossible for observant members of the Jewish faith to
appear in front of the Cambridge City Council and present their view.
Those who select such timing are not interested in a fair debate; they are the allies of,
simultaneously, the anti-Semitic left and the David Dukes of this world, and they simply
want to cancel not only the only Jewish state in this planet, but all Jews.
It is unfortunate that at a time Muslim countries such as Morocco, Bahrain, the
Emirates, and Sudan have self reflected on their rejection of the Jewish state of Israel
and elected to embark on a warm peace with her, and more Muslim countries such
as Pakistan have initiated behind the scene but significant steps in that direction, we in
the United States are witnessing the spread of multiple forms of anti-Semitism, including
anti-Zionism.
Just as Muslim countries are realizing that rejecting and figthting the Jewish state only
damages the well being of their people, we too should realize that BDS anti-Semitism will
in the long run have a deleterious effect on our own anti-racist endeavours, such as the
Black Lives Matter movement, and will do enormous harm to the diverse fabric of
American society.
It therefore behooves all those who oppose racism to outright reject such a hateful
proposal!
Hate and those who hate do not belong to the City of Cambridge.
Thanking you in advance,

HR2509 public comment

As a proud resident of Cambridge, I was disappointed to learn of this resolution and read its details. The residents of
Cambridge are, I assume, smarter than average, and thus, I would hope, able to appreciate complexity and nuance when
other oversimplify. I am intensely critical of many Israeli policies and actions, including events that led to the current
situation and things that are currently occurring. However, the text of these proposals are entirely oversimplifying a
complex situation, and I do not believe a BDS resolution is not the answer. This BDS resolution in particular
demonstrates an incomplete understanding of a complicated political situation in a tense and volatile region, where
residents in both lands are faced with threats to existence that no one in Cambridge could imagine.
I am in favor of censure of Israel when it crosses lines, and believe it has crossed lines recently, but that must also come
with censure of Hamas, the current governing body in Gaza, which is a terrorist organization that harms both
Palestinians and Israelis. Has Cambridge investigated how its finances contribute to Hamas attacks on Palestinians and
Israelis? Or are certain individuals trying to appear progressive and “woke”, and frankly, keeping up with the latest fad,
and jumping on the BDS bandwagon without proper thought?
Sincerely,
Rebecca Spirgel

BDS RESOLUTIONS

As a citizen of Massachusetts and resident of Israel I am absolutely appalled at the careless and misinformed
statements brought in the resolution. Such terms as apartheid in regards to the Israel Palestinian conflict are the
invention of terrorist organizations the likes of which brought down the world trade center.
As a live witness to the goings on here in the State of Israel an not a slave to the agendas of the media It is clear that
Israel is quite the opposite of an apartheid state.
The majority of construction workers and about half of the bus drivers and pharmacists in Israel are Palestinians, all of
whom enjoy all the social benefits that every citizen receives. These workers roam freely the streets of israeli
neighborhoods without question.
To contrast a jew, whether or not he is an israeli citizen, who wanders accidentally into a palestinian village any time of
the year is liable to be lynched, beaten, stoned or shot. Not long ago some fellow students from my school who are
american citizens and not at all israeli, accidentally drove into a palestinian village. There they were attacked without
reason. Their car was surrounded and stoned and they were beaten. Only thanks to the mercy of one person who took
them into his house were their lives spared.
These people not only disrespect jewish lives but also the lives of their own people. If we talk about violations of human
rights what about the hundreds of palestinian women who over the past few years were murdered in honor killings by
their husbands, fathers and brothers.
And if we talk about hindrance to peace know that it is an established rule among palestinians that one who sells his
property to a jew is put to death. I personally know people who bought property from Palestinians and subsequently
aided them in escaping from the country to save their lives.
To contrast, Arabs and jews live side by side in such cities as Haifa and Lod with no such restrictions on housing. It is
some of these residents that are now beating their jewish neighbors for no crime other than race.
Regarding the actions of the Israeli military to say that they are unrightfully harming citizens and children etc. is nothing
more than plainly false. The Israeli military targets only terrorist strongholds. The sad fact that the terrorists bring their
children to missile launching sites is just another horrific display of their disrespect for human lives.
The palestinian terrorists on the other hand have targeted civilian targets almost exclusively. All you have to do to verify
that is ask anyone who works in Tel Aviv. Or for that matter all the airlines that canceled flights due to attempted missile
strikes to the airport.
I strongly urge the City of Cambridge as a warrior for justice and center of honesty to reconsider the facts or lack thereof
upon which this resolution is based.
Respectfully,
Moshe

About 6.8 million Jewish Israelis and 6.8 million Palestinians live today between the
Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River, an area encompassing Israel and the Occupied
Palestinian Territory (OPT), the latter made up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,
and the Gaza Strip. Throughout most of this area, Israel is the sole governing power; in the
remainder, it exercises primary authority alongside limited Palestinian self-rule. Across
these areas and in most aspects of life, Israeli authorities methodically privilege Jewish
Israelis and discriminate against Palestinians. Laws, policies, and statements by leading
Israeli officials make plain that the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control over
demographics, political power, and land has long guided government policy. In pursuit of
this goal, authorities have dispossessed, confined, forcibly separated, and subjugated
Palestinians by virtue of their identity to varying degrees of intensity. In certain areas, as
described in this report, these deprivations are so severe that they amount to the crimes
against humanity of apartheid and persecution.
Several widely held assumptions, including that the occupation is temporary, that the
“peace process” will soon bring an end to Israeli abuses, that Palestinians have
meaningful control over their lives in the West Bank and Gaza, and that Israel is an
egalitarian democracy inside its borders, have obscured the reality of Israel’s entrenched
discriminatory rule over Palestinians. Israel has maintained military rule over some portion
of the Palestinian population for all but six months of its 73-year history. It did so over the
vast majority of Palestinians inside Israel from 1948 and until 1966. From 1967 until the
present, it has militarily ruled over Palestinians in the OPT, excluding East Jerusalem. By
contrast, it has since its founding governed all Jewish Israelis, including settlers in the OPT
since the beginning of the occupation in 1967, under its more rights-respecting civil law.
For the past 54 years, Israeli authorities have facilitated the transfer of Jewish Israelis to
the OPT and granted them a superior status under the law as compared to Palestinians
living in the same territory when it comes to civil rights, access to land, and freedom to
move, build, and confer residency rights to close relatives. While Palestinians have a
limited degree of self-rule in parts of the OPT, Israel retains primary control over borders,
airspace, the movement of people and goods, security, and the registry of the entire

population, which in turn dictates such matters as legal status and eligibility to receive

A number of Israeli officials have stated clearly their intent to maintain this control in
perpetuity and backed it up through their actions, including continued settlement
expansion over the course of the decades-long “peace process.” Unilateral annexation of
additional parts of the West Bank, which the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has vowed to carry out, would formalize the reality of systematic Israeli
domination and oppression that has long prevailed without changing the reality that the
entire West Bank is occupied territory under the international law of occupation, including
East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967.
International criminal law has developed two crimes against humanity for situations of
systematic discrimination and repression: apartheid and persecution. Crimes against
humanity stand among the most odious crimes in international law.
The international community has over the years detached the term apartheid from its original
South African context, developed a universal legal prohibition against its practice, and
recognized it as a crime against humanity with definitions provided in the 1973 International
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (“Apartheid
Convention”) and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The crime against humanity of persecution, also set out in the Rome Statute, the
intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights on racial, ethnic, and other
grounds, grew out of the post-World War II trials and constitutes one of the most serious
international crimes, of the same gravity as apartheid.
The State of Palestine is a state party to both the Rome Statute and the Apartheid
Convention. In February 2021, the ICC ruled that it has jurisdiction over serious
international crimes committed in the entirety of the OPT, including East Jerusalem, which
would include the crimes against humanity of apartheid or persecution committed in that
territory. In March 2021, the ICC Office of Prosecutor announced the opening of a formal
investigation into the situation in Palestine.

The term apartheid has increasingly been used in relation to Israel and the OPT, but
usually in a descriptive or comparative, non-legal sense, and often to warn that the
European officials, prominent media commentators, and others have asserted that, if
Israel’s policies and practices towards Palestinians continued along the same trajectory,
the situation, at least in the West Bank, would become tantamount to apartheid. 1 Some
have claimed that the current reality amounts to apartheid. 2 Few, however, have

conducted a detailed legal analysis based on the international crimes of apartheid

In this report, Human Rights Watch examines the extent to which that threshold has
already been crossed in certain of the areas where Israeli authorities exercise control.

Definitions of Apartheid and Persecution
The prohibition of institutionalized discrimination, especially on grounds of race or
ethnicity, constitutes one of the fundamental elements of international law. Most states
have agreed to treat the worst forms of such discrimination, that is, persecution and
apartheid, as crimes against humanity, and have given the ICC the power to prosecute
these crimes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to pursue them. Crimes
against humanity consist of specific criminal acts committed as part of a widespread or
systematic attack, or acts committed pursuant to a state or organizational policy, directed
against a civilian population.
The Apartheid Convention defines the crime against humanity of apartheid as “inhuman
acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial
group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing
them.” The Rome Statute of the ICC adopts a similar definition: “inhumane acts…
committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and
domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with
the intention of maintaining that regime.” The Rome Statute does not further define what
constitutes an “institutionalized regime.”
The crime of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute consists of three
primary elements: an intent to maintain a system of domination by one racial group over

another; systematic oppression by one racial group over another; and one or more

inhumane acts, as defined, carried out on a widespread or systematic basis pursuant to

Among the inhumane acts identified in either the Convention or the Rome Statute are
“forcible transfer,” “expropriation of landed property,” “creation of separate reserves and
ghettos,” and denial of the “the right to leave and to return to their country, [and] the right
to a nationality.”
The Rome Statute identifies the crime against humanity of persecution as “the intentional
and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the
identity of the group or collectivity,” including on racial, national, or ethnic grounds.
Customary international law identifies the crime of persecution as consisting of two
primary elements: (1) severe abuses of fundamental rights committed on a widespread or
systematic basis, and (2) with discriminatory intent.
Few courts have heard cases involving the crime of persecution and none the crime of
apartheid, resulting in a lack of case law around the meanings of key terms in their
definitions. As described in the report, international criminal courts have over the last
two decades evaluated group identity based on the context and construction by local
actors, as opposed to earlier approaches focused on hereditary physical traits. In
international human rights law, including the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), race and racial discrimination
have been broadly interpreted to include distinctions based on descent, and national or
ethnic origin, among other categories.

Application to Israel’s Policies towards Palestinians
Two primary groups live today in Israel and the OPT: Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. One
primary sovereign, the Israeli government, rules over them.

Intent to Maintain Domination
A stated aim of the Israeli government is to ensure that Jewish Israelis maintain
domination across Israel and the OPT. The Knesset in 2018 passed a law with

that within that territory, the right to self-determination “is unique to the Jewish people,”
and establishing “Jewish settlement” as a national value. To sustain Jewish Israeli control,
described as a demographic “threat” that Palestinians pose. Those policies include
limiting the population and political power of Palestinians, granting the right to vote only
to Palestinians who live within the borders of Israel as they existed from 1948 to June 1967,
and limiting the ability of Palestinians to move to Israel from the OPT and from anywhere
else to Israel or the OPT. Other steps are taken to ensure Jewish domination, including a
state policy of “separation” of Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza, which
prevents the movement of people and goods within the OPT, and “Judaization” of areas
with significant Palestinian populations, including Jerusalem as well as the Galilee and the
Negev in Israel. This policy, which aims to maximize Jewish Israeli control over land,
concentrates the majority of Palestinians who live outside Israel’s major, predominantly
Jewish cities into dense, under-served enclaves and restricts their access to land and
housing, while nurturing the growth of nearby Jewish communities.

Systematic Oppression and Institutional Discrimination
To implement the goal of domination, the Israeli government institutionally discriminates
against Palestinians. The intensity of that discrimination varies according to different rules
established by the Israeli government in Israel, on the one hand, and different parts of the
OPT, on the other, where the most severe form takes place.
In the OPT, which Israel has recognized as a single territory encompassing the West Bank
and Gaza, Israeli authorities treat Palestinians separately and unequally as compared to
Jewish Israeli settlers. In the occupied West Bank, Israel subjects Palestinians to draconian
military law and enforces segregation, largely prohibiting Palestinians from entering
settlements. In the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel imposes a generalized closure, sharply
restricting the movement of people and goods—policies that Gaza’s other neighbor, Egypt,
often does little to alleviate. In annexed East Jerusalem, which Israel considers part of its
sovereign territory but remains occupied territory under international law, Israel provides
the vast majority of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living there with a legal
status that weakens their residency rights by conditioning them on the individual’s
connections to the city, among other factors. This level of discrimination amounts to

systematic oppression.

4.33.a

In Israel, which the vast majority of nations consider being the area defined by its pre-1967
borders, the two tiered-citizenship structure and bifurcation of nationality and citizenship
Palestinians in Israel, unlike those in the OPT, have the right to vote and stand for Israeli
elections, these rights do not empower them to overcome the institutional discrimination
they face from the same Israeli government, including widespread restrictions on
accessing land confiscated from them, home demolitions, and effective prohibitions on
family reunification.
The fragmentation of the Palestinian population, in part deliberately engineered through
Israeli restrictions on movement and residency, furthers the goal of domination and helps
obscure the reality of the same Israeli government repressing the same Palestinian
population group, to varying degrees in different areas, for the benefit of the same Jewish
Israeli dominant group.

Inhumane Acts and Other Abuses of Fundamental Rights
Pursuant to these policies, Israeli authorities have carried out a range of inhumane acts in
the OPT. Those include sweeping restrictions on the movement of 4.7 million Palestinians
there; the confiscation of much of their land; the imposition of harsh conditions, including
categorical denial of building permits in large parts of the West Bank, which has led
thousands of Palestinians to leave their homes under conditions that amount to forcible
transfer; the denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their
relatives, largely for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods
during the first few decades of the occupation, or as a result of the effective freeze on
family reunification over the last two decades; and the suspension of basic civil rights,
such as freedom of assembly and association, depriving Palestinians of the opportunity to
have a voice in a wide range of affairs that most affect their daily lives and futures. Many of
these abuses, including categorical denials of building permits, mass residency
revocations or restrictions, and large-scale land confiscations, have no legitimate security
justifications; others, such as the extent of restrictions on movement and civil rights, fail
any reasonable balancing test between security concerns and the severity of the
underlying rights abuse.

Since the founding of the state of Israel, the government also has systematically

land (1000 dunams equals 100 hectares, about 250 acres or 1 square kilometer) that were
confiscated from them. In one region—the Negev—these policies make it virtually
impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinians to live lawfully in the communities they
have lived in for decades. In addition, Israeli authorities refuse to permit the more than
700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948, and their descendants, to return
to Israel or the OPT, and impose blanket restrictions on legal residency, which block many
Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel.

Report Findings
This report examines Israeli policies and practices towards Palestinians in the OPT and
Israel and compares them to the treatment of Jewish Israelis living in the same territories.
It is not an exhaustive evaluation of all types of international human rights and
humanitarian law violations. Rather, it surveys consequential Israeli government practices
and policies that violate the basic rights of Palestinians and whose purpose is to ensure
the domination of Jewish Israelis, and assesses them against the definitions of the crimes
against humanity of apartheid and persecution.
The report draws on years of research and documentation by Human Rights Watch and
other rights organizations, including fieldwork conducted for this report. Human Rights
Watch also reviewed Israeli laws, government planning documents, statements by
officials, and land records. This evidentiary record was then analyzed under the legal
standards for the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Human Rights Watch also wrote in
July 2020 to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, soliciting the government’s
perspectives on the issues covered, but, as of publication, had not received a response.
The report does not set out to compare Israel with South Africa under apartheid or to
determine whether Israel is an “apartheid state”—a concept that is not defined in
international law. Rather, the report assesses whether specific acts and policies carried
out by Israeli authorities today amount in particular areas to the crimes of apartheid and
persecution as defined under international law.

4.33.a

Each of the report’s three main substantive chapters explores Israel’s rule over
Palestinians: the dynamics of its rule and discrimination, looking in turn at Israel and the
motivate these policies. It does so in terms of the primary elements of the crimes of
apartheid and persecution, as outlined above. Human Rights Watch evaluates the
dynamics of Israeli rule in each of these areas, keeping in mind the different legal
frameworks that apply in the OPT and Israel, which are the two legally recognized territorial
entities, each with a different status under international law. While noting significant
factual differences among subregions in each of these two territories, the report does not
make separate subregional determinations.
On the basis of its research, Human Rights Watch concludes that the Israeli government has
demonstrated an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians
across Israel and the OPT. In the OPT, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled
with systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them.
When these three elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.
Israeli officials have also committed the crime against humanity of persecution. This
finding is based on the discriminatory intent behind Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and
the grave abuses carried out in the OPT that include the widespread confiscation of
privately owned land, the effective prohibition on building or living in many areas, the
mass denial of residency rights, and sweeping, decades-long restrictions on the freedom
of movement and basic civil rights. Such policies and practices intentionally and severely
deprive millions of Palestinians of key fundamental rights, including to residency, private
property, and access to land, services, and resources, on a widespread and systematic
basis by virtue of their identity as Palestinians.

Seeking Maximal Land with Minimal Palestinians
Israeli policy has sought to engineer and maximize the number of Jews, as well as the land
available to them, in Israel and the portions of the OPT coveted by the Israeli government
for Jewish settlement. At the same time, by restricting the residency rights of Palestinians,
Israeli policy seeks to minimize the number of Palestinians and the land available to them
in those areas. The level of repression is most severe in the OPT, although often less

In the West Bank, authorities have confiscated more than 2 million dunams of land from
Palestinians, making up more than one-third of the West Bank, including tens of
thousands of dunams that they acknowledge are privately owned by Palestinians. One
common tactic they have used is to declare territory, including privately-owned
Palestinian land, as “state land.” The Israeli group Peace Now estimates that the Israeli
government has designated about 1.4 million dunams of land, or about a quarter of the
West Bank, as state land. The group has also found that more than 30 percent of the land
used for settlements is acknowledged by the Israeli government as having been privately
owned by Palestinians. Of the more than 675,000 dunams of state land that Israeli
authorities have allocated for use by third parties in the West Bank, they have earmarked
more than 99 percent for use by Israeli civilians, according to government data. Land
grabs for settlements and the infrastructure that primarily serves settlers effectively
concentrate Palestinians in the West Bank, according to B’Tselem, into “165 non-

Israeli authorities have also made it virtually impossible in practice for Palestinians in Area
C, the roughly 60 percent of the West Bank that the Oslo Accords placed under full Israeli
example, authorities approved less than 1.5 percent of applications by Palestinians to
build between 2016 and 2018—21 in total—a figure 100 times smaller than the number of
demolition orders it issued in the same period, according to official data. Israeli
authorities have razed thousands of Palestinian properties in these areas for lacking a
permit, leaving thousands of families displaced. By contrast, according to Peace Now,
Israeli authorities began construction on more than 23,696 housing units between 2009
and 2020 in Israeli settlements in Area C. Transfer of an occupying power’s civilian
population to an occupied territory violates the Fourth Geneva Convention.
These policies grow out of longstanding Israeli government plans. For example, the 1980
Drobles Plan, which guided the government’s settlement policy in the West Bank at the
time and built on prior plans, called for authorities to “settle the land between the [Arab]
minority population centers and their surroundings,” noting that doing so would make it
“hard for Palestinians to create territorial contiguity and political unity” and “remove any
trace of doubt about our intention to control Judea and Samaria forever.”
In Jerusalem, the government’s plan for the municipality, including both the west and
occupied east of the city, sets the goal of “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city”
and a target demographic “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arabs”—later adjusted to a 60:40
ratio after authorities acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the
demographic trend.”
The Israeli government has also carried out discriminatory seizures of land inside Israel.
Authorities have seized through different mechanisms at least 4.5 million dunams of land
from Palestinians, according to historians, constituting 65 to 75 percent of all land owned
by Palestinians before 1948 and 40 to 60 percent of the land that belonged to Palestinians
who remained after 1948 and became citizens of Israel. Authorities in the early years of the
state declared land belonging to displaced Palestinians as “absentee property” or “closed
military zones,” then took it over, converted it to state land, and built Jewish communities
there. Authorities continue to block Palestinian citizen landowners from accessing land
that was confiscated from them. A 2003 government-commissioned report found that “the

majority” and that state lands, which constitute 93 percent of all land in Israel, effectively
serve the objective of “Jewish settlement.” Since 1948, the government has authorized the
government-planned townships and villages for Palestinians, created largely to
concentrate previously displaced Bedouin communities living in the Negev.
Land confiscations and other discriminatory land policies in Israel hem in Palestinian
municipalities inside Israel, denying them opportunities for natural expansion enjoyed by
Jewish municipalities. The vast majority of Palestinian citizens, who make up around 19
percent of the Israeli population, live in these municipalities, which have an estimated
jurisdiction over less than 3 percent of all land in Israel. While Palestinians in Israel can
move freely, and some live in “mixed cities,” such as Haifa, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and Acre, Israeli
law permits small towns to exclude prospective residents based on their asserted
incompatibility with the town’s “social-cultural fabric.” According to a study by a professor
at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, there are more than 900 small Jewish
towns, including kibbutzim, across Israel that can restrict who lives there. None of them
have any Palestinians living among them.
In the Negev in Israel, Israeli authorities have refused to legally recognize 35 Palestinian
Bedouin communities, making it impossible for their 90,000 or so residents to live
lawfully in the communities they have lived in for decades. Instead, authorities have
sought to concentrate Bedouin communities in larger recognized townships in order, as
expressed in governmental plans and statements by officials, to maximize the land
available for Jewish communities. Israeli law considers all buildings in these unrecognized
villages to be illegal, and authorities have refused to connect most to the national
electricity or water grids or to provide even basic infrastructure such as paved roads or
sewage systems. The communities do not appear on official maps, most have no
educational facilities, and residents live under constant threat of having their homes
demolished. Israeli authorities demolished more than 10,000 Bedouin homes in the Negev
between 2013 and 2019, according to government data. They razed one unrecognized
village that challenged the expropriation of its lands, al-Araqib, 185 times.
Authorities have implemented these policies pursuant to government plans since the early
years of the state that called for restricting Bedouin communities in order to secure land

2000, Ariel Sharon declared that Bedouins in the Negev “are gnawing at the country’s land
reserves,” which he described as “a demographic phenomenon.” As prime minister,
Jewish population in the Negev and Galilee regions of Israel, areas that have significant
Palestinian populations. His deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres, later described the plan
as a “battle for the future for the Jewish people.”
Sharon’s push to Judaize the Negev, as well as the Galilee, developed against the
backdrop of the government’s decision to withdraw Jewish settlers from Gaza. After ending
Jewish settlement there, Israel began to treat Gaza effectively as a territorial jurisdiction
whose population it could consider as outside the demographic calculus of Jews and
Palestinians who live in Israel and in the vast majority of the OPT—the West Bank including
East Jerusalem—that Israel intends to retain. Israeli officials at the time acknowledged the
demographic objectives behind the move. Amid the push to withdraw settlers from Gaza,
Sharon said in an August 2005 address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot be held onto forever. Over
one million Palestinians live there and they double their numbers with every generation.”
Peres said the same month, “We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography.”
Despite withdrawing its settlers and ground troops, Israel has remained in critical ways the
supreme power in Gaza, dominating through other means and hence maintaining its legal
obligations as an occupying power, as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
and the United Nations (UN), among others, have determined. Most significantly, Israel
bans Palestinians living there (with only narrow exceptions) from leaving through the Erez
Passenger Crossing it controls and instituted a formal “policy of separation” between Gaza
and the West Bank, despite Israel having recognized within the framework of the Oslo
Accords these two parts of the OPT as collectively forming a “single territorial unit.” The
generalized travel ban, which has remained in place since 2007 and reduced travel out of
Gaza to a fraction of what it was two decades ago, is not based on an individualized
security assessment and fails any reasonable test of balancing security concerns against
the right to freedom of movement for over two million people.
Authorities have also sharply restricted the entry and exit of goods to and from Gaza,
which, alongside Egypt often shutting its border, effectively seals it off from the outside
world. These restrictions have contributed to limiting access to basic services, devastating

Families in Gaza in recent years have had to make do without centrally provided electricity
for between 12 and 20 hours per day, depending on the period. Water is also critically
human consumption.”
Within the West Bank as well, Israeli authorities prohibit Palestinian ID holders from
entering areas such as East Jerusalem, lands beyond the separation barrier, and areas
controlled by settlements and the army, unless they secure difficult-to-obtain permits.
They have also erected nearly 600 permanent obstacles, many between Palestinian
communities, that disrupt daily life for Palestinians. In sharp contrast, Israeli authorities
allow Jewish settlers in the West Bank to move freely within the majority of the West Bank
under its exclusive control, as well as to and from Israel, on roads built to facilitate their
commutes and integrate them into every facet of Israeli life.
Demographic considerations factor centrally in Israel’s separation policy between Gaza
and the West Bank. In particular, in the rare cases when they allow movement between the
two parts of the OPT, Israeli authorities permit it predominantly in the direction of Gaza,
thereby facilitating population flow away from the area where Israel actively promotes
Jewish settlement. The Israeli army’s official policy states that while a West Bank resident
can apply “for permanent resettlement in the Gaza Strip for any purpose that is considered
humanitarian (usually family reunification),” Gaza residents can settle in the West Bank
only “in the rarest cases,” usually related to family reunification. In these cases,
authorities are mandated to aim to resettle the couple in Gaza. Official data shows that
Israel did not approve a single Gaza resident to resettle in the West Bank, outside of a
handful who filed Supreme Court petitions between 2009 and March 2017, while
permitting several dozen West Bank residents to relocate to Gaza on the condition that
they sign a pledge not to return to the West Bank.
Beyond the closure policy, Israeli authorities have often used oppressive and
indiscriminate means during hostilities and protests in Gaza. Since 2008, the Israeli army
has launched three large-scale military offensives in Gaza in the context of hostilities with
armed Palestinian groups. As described in the report, those offensives have included
apparently deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and killed well over
2,000 civilians. In addition, Israeli forces have regularly fired on Palestinian demonstrators

when they did not pose an imminent threat to life, killing 214 demonstrators in 2018 and
2019 alone and maiming thousands. These practices stem from a decades-long pattern of
great cost to civilians. Despite the frequency of such incidents over the years, Israeli
authorities have failed to develop law enforcement tactics that comport with international
human rights norms.

Discriminatory Restrictions on Residency and Nationality
Palestinians face discriminatory restrictions on their rights to residency and nationality to
varying degrees in the OPT and Israel. Israeli authorities have used their control over the
population registry in the West Bank and Gaza—the list of Palestinians they consider
lawful residents for purposes of issuing legal status and identity cards—to deny residency
to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Israeli authorities refused to register at least
270,000 Palestinians who were outside the West Bank and Gaza when the occupation
began in 1967 and revoked the residency of nearly 250,000, mostly for being abroad for
too long between 1967 and 1994. Since 2000, Israeli authorities have largely refused to
process family reunification applications or requests for address changes by Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza. The freeze effectively bars Palestinians from acquiring legal
status for spouses or relatives not already registered and makes illegal, according to the
Israeli army, the presence in the West Bank of thousands of Gaza residents who arrived on
temporary permits and now live there, since they effectively cannot change their address
to one in the West Bank. These restrictions have the effect of limiting the Palestinian
population in the West Bank.
Authorities regularly deny entry into the West Bank to non-registered Palestinians who had
lived in the West Bank but left temporarily (to study, work, marry, or for other reasons) and
to their non-registered spouses and other family members.
When Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, it applied its 1952 Law of Entry to
Palestinians who lived there and designated them as “permanent residents,” the same
status afforded to a non-Jewish foreigner who moves to Israel. The Interior Ministry has
revoked this status from at least 14,701 Palestinians since 1967, mostly for failing to prove
a “center of life” in the city. A path to Israeli citizenship exists, but few apply and most who

4.33.a

including settlers in East Jerusalem, are citizens who do not have to prove connections to

Inside Israel, Israel’s Proclamation of Independence affirms the “complete equality” of all
residents, but a two-track citizenship structure contradicts that vow and effectively regards
Jews and Palestinians separately and unequally. Israel’s 1952 Citizenship Law contains a
separate track exclusively for Jews to obtain automatic citizenship. That law grows out of
the 1950 Law of Return which guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to
settle in Israel. By contrast, the track for Palestinians conditions citizenship on proving
residency before 1948 in the territory that became Israel, inclusion in the population
registry as of 1952, and a continuous presence in Israel or legal entry in the period between
1948 and 1952. Authorities have used this language to deny residency rights to the more
than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948 and their descendants, who
today number more than 5.7 million. This law creates a reality where a Jewish citizen of any
other country who has never been to Israel can move there and automatically gain
citizenship, while a Palestinian expelled from his home and languishing for more than 70
years in a refugee camp in a nearby country, cannot.
The 1952 Citizenship Law also authorizes granting citizenship based on naturalization.
However, in 2003, the Knesset passed the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary
Order), which bars granting Israeli citizenship or long-term legal status to Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents. With few exceptions,
this law, renewed every year since and upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, denies both
Jewish and Palestinian citizens and residents of Israel who choose to marry Palestinians
the right to live with their partner in Israel. This restriction, based solely on the spouse’s
identity as a Palestinian from the West Bank or Gaza, notably does not apply when Israelis
marry non-Jewish spouses of most other foreign nationalities. They can receive immediate
status and, after several years, apply for citizenship.
Commenting on a 2005 renewal of the law, the prime minister at the time, Ariel Sharon,
said: “There’s no need to hide behind security arguments. There’s a need for the existence
of a Jewish state.” Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then the finance minister, said during
discussions at the time: “Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want to get
citizenship, we should make the process much more difficult, in order to guarantee Israel’s

Netanyahu declared, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens,” but rather “the nation-state of

International human rights law gives broad latitude to governments in setting their
immigration policies. There is nothing in international law to bar Israel from promoting
Jewish immigration. Jewish Israelis, many of whom historically migrated to Mandatory
Palestine or later to Israel to escape anti-Semitic persecution in different parts of the
world, are entitled to protection of their safety and fundamental rights. However, that
latitude does not give a state the prerogative to discriminate against people who already
live in that country, including with respect to rights concerning family reunification, and
against people who have a right to return to the country. Palestinians are also entitled to
protection of their safety and fundamental rights.

Israeli Justifications of Policies and Practices
Israeli authorities justify many of the policies documented in this report as responses to
Palestinian anti-Israeli violence. Many policies, though, like the denial of building permits
in Area C, East Jerusalem, and the Negev in Israel, residency revocations for Jerusalemites,
or expropriation of privately owned land and discriminatory allocation of state lands, have
no legitimate security justification. Others, including the Citizenship and Entry into Israel
Law and freeze of the OPT population registry, use security as a pretext to advance
demographic objectives.
Israeli authorities do face legitimate security challenges in Israel and the OPT. However,
restrictions that do not seek to balance human rights such as freedom of movement
against legitimate security concerns by, for example, conducting individualized security
assessments rather than barring the entire population of Gaza from leaving with only rare
exceptions, go far beyond what international law permits. Even where security forms part
of the motivation behind a particular policy, that does not give Israel a carte blanche to
violate human rights en masse. Legitimate security concerns can be present among
policies that amount to apartheid, just as they can be present in a policy that sanctions the
use of excessive force or torture.
Officials sometimes claim that measures taken in the OPT are temporary and would be

the Labor Party, declaring in July 1967 that “I see only a quasi-independent region [for
Palestinians], because the security and land are in Israeli hands,” to Netanyahu of the
entire territory, up to the Jordan [River],” a range of officials have made clear their intent to
maintain overriding control over the West Bank in perpetuity, regardless of what
arrangements are in place to govern Palestinians. Their actions and policies further dispel
the notion that Israeli authorities consider the occupation temporary, including the
continuing of land confiscation, the building of the separation barrier in a way that
accommodated anticipated growth of settlements, the seamless integration of the
settlements’ sewage system, communication networks, electrical grids, water
infrastructure and a matrix of roads with Israel proper, as well as a growing body of laws
applicable to West Bank Israeli settlers but not Palestinians. The possibility that a future
Israeli leader might forge a deal with Palestinians that dismantles the discriminatory
system and ends systematic repression does not negate the intent of current officials to
maintain the current system, nor the current reality of apartheid and persecution.

Recommendations
The Israeli government should dismantle all forms of systematic domination and
oppression that privilege Jewish Israelis and systematically repress Palestinians, and end
the persecution of Palestinians. In particular, authorities should end discriminatory
policies and practices with regards to citizenship and residency rights, civil rights, freedom
of movement, allocation of land and resources, access to water, electricity, and other
services, and granting of building permits.
The findings that the crimes of apartheid and persecution are being committed do not deny
the reality of Israeli occupation or erase Israel’s obligations under the law of occupation,
any more than would a finding that other crimes against humanity or war crimes have been
carried out. As such, Israeli authorities should cease building settlements and dismantle
existing ones and otherwise provide Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza with full
respect of their human rights, using as a benchmark the rights that it grants Israeli
citizens, as well as the protections that international humanitarian law grants them.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) should end forms of security coordination with the Israeli army

The finding of crimes against humanity should prompt the international community to
reevaluate its approach to Israel and Palestine. The US, which for decades has largely
in some instances in recent years signaled its support for serious abuses such as the
building of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Many European and other states have
built close ties with Israel, while supporting the “peace process,” building the capacity of
the PA, and distancing themselves from and sometimes criticizing specific abusive Israeli
practices in the OPT. This approach, which overlooks the deeply entrenched nature of
Israeli discrimination and repression of Palestinians there, minimizes serious human
rights abuses by treating them as temporary symptoms of the occupation that the “peace
process” will soon cure. It has enabled states to resist the sort of accountability that a
situation of this gravity warrants, allowing apartheid to metastasize and consolidate. After
54 years, states should stop assessing the situation through the prism of what might
happen should the languishing peace process one day be revived and focus instead on the
longstanding reality on the ground that shows no signs of abating.
Crimes against humanity can serve as the basis for individual criminal liability in
international fora, as well as in domestic courts outside of Israel and the OPT under the
principle of universal jurisdiction.
In light of the decades-long failure by Israeli authorities to rein in serious abuses, the
International Criminal Court’s Office of the Prosecutor should investigate and prosecute
individuals credibly implicated in the crimes against humanity of apartheid or
persecution. The ICC has jurisdiction over, and the prosecutor has opened an investigation
into, serious crimes committed in the OPT. In addition, all governments should investigate
and prosecute those credibly implicated in these crimes, under the principle of universal
jurisdiction and in accordance with national laws.
Beyond criminality, Human Rights Watch calls on states to establish through the UN an
international commission of inquiry to investigate systematic discrimination and
repression based on group identity in the OPT and Israel. The inquiry should be mandated
to establish and analyze the facts; identify those responsible for serious crimes, including
apartheid and persecution, with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators are held

States should also establish through the UN a position of UN global envoy for the crimes of
persecution and apartheid with a mandate to mobilize international action to end
persecution and apartheid worldwide.
States should issue statements expressing concern about Israel’s practice of apartheid
and persecution. They should vet agreements, cooperation schemes, and all forms of trade
and dealing with Israel to screen for those directly contributing to the commission of the
crimes of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians, mitigate the human rights
impacts, and, where not possible, end the activities and funding found to facilitate these
serious crimes.
The implications of the findings of this report for businesses are complex and beyond the
scope of this report. At a minimum, businesses should cease activities that directly
contribute to the commission of the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Companies should
assess whether their goods or services contribute to the commission of the crimes of
apartheid and persecution, such as equipment used in the unlawful demolition of
Palestinian homes, and cease providing goods and services that will likely be used for such
purposes, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
States should impose individual sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes,
against officials and individuals responsible for the continued commission of these
serious crimes and condition arms sales and military and security assistance to Israel on
Israeli authorities taking concrete and verifiable steps towards ending their commission of
the crimes of apartheid and persecution.
The international community has for too long explained away and turned a blind eye to the
increasingly transparent reality on the ground. Every day a person is born in Gaza into an
open-air prison, in the West Bank without civil rights, in Israel with an inferior status by law,
and in neighboring countries effectively condemned to lifelong refugee status, like their
parents and grandparents before them, solely because they are Palestinian and not Jewish. A

This report focuses on Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory (OPT) and in Israel. It is not a comprehensive examination of all repressive
policies, practices, and other facets of institutional discrimination. It also does not
account for all human rights abuses in these areas, including rights abuses committed by
Palestinian authorities or armed groups, which Human Rights Watch has covered
extensively elsewhere. 4 Rather, it examines discriminatory policies, laws, and regulations
that privilege Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians.
While the report evaluates whether specific Israeli policies and practices amount to the
crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution, it does not delve into the potential
criminal liability of particular Israeli officials.
This report is based primarily on years of documentation carried out by Human Rights
Watch, as well as by Israeli, Palestinian, and international human rights groups. Human
Rights Watch also reviewed Israeli laws, government planning documents, statements by
officials, land records, and legal standards governing the crimes of apartheid and
persecution. The report includes several case studies, based on 40 interviews with
affected persons, current and former officials, lawyers, and NGO representatives, as well
as on-site visits, all conducted by Human Rights Watch in 2019 and 2020. Some interviews
took place at locations in the OPT and Israel, but, in part due to movement restrictions
imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, many were conducted by phone.
Human Rights Watch conducted most of the interviews that are included in this report
individually, in Arabic or English. We conducted them with the consent of those being
interviewed and told each of the interviewees how Human Rights Watch would use the

More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes and more than 400
Palestinian villages were destroyed in events around the establishment of the Israeli state
in 1948. 5 Between 1949 and 1966, Israeli authorities placed most of the Palestinians who
remained within the borders of the new state under military rule, confining them to dozens
of enclaves, requiring them to obtain permits to leave their enclaves, and severely
restricting their rights. 6
In June 1967, Israel seized control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan
and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, which make up the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), as
well as the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, following an
armed conflict known as the Six-Day War.
Israeli authorities have since retained control over the OPT. In the occupied West Bank, the
Israeli army has militarily ruled over Palestinians living there, except in East Jerusalem,
which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967. Annexation does not change East Jerusalem’s
status as occupied territory under international law. Throughout the West Bank, Israel has
facilitated the building of Israeli-only settlements. The Fourth Geneva Convention, which

Israel also unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, though it also remains an
occupied territory under international law. Israel ended its occupation of the Sinai
Peninsula as a result of the 1978 Camp David Accords with Egypt.
In 1993 and 1995, the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
signed the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian Authority (PA) to manage some
Palestinian affairs in parts of the OPT for a transitional period, not exceeding five years,
until the parties forged a permanent status agreement. 8 The Oslo Accords, supplemented
by later agreements, divided the West Bank largely into three distinct regions: Area A,
where the PA would manage full security and civil affairs, Area B, where the PA would
manage civil affairs and Israel would have security control, and Area C, under the exclusive
control of Israel. Area A largely incorporates the major Palestinian city centers, Area B the
majority of towns and many villages, and Area C the remaining 60 percent of the West
Bank. 9 The Oslo Accords, though, did not end the occupation in any part of the OPT.
The parties did not reach a final status agreement by 2000 and have not in the two
decades since, despite off and on negotiations primarily mediated by the US. The West
Bank remains primarily divided between Areas A, B, and C, with Israel retaining overall
principal control and the PA managing some affairs in Areas A and B. In Gaza, Hamas has
effectively governed since seizing control in June 2007 following months of clashes
between the Palestinian political parties Fatah and Hamas and more than a year of
political uncertainty after Hamas won a plurality of seats in PA elections. 10 In January

2020, the Trump Administration presented its “Peace to Prosperity” plan, which envisions
permanent Israeli domination over the entire territory and formal annexation of
state, but sets conditions that make its realization nearly impossible.
The decades-long “peace process” has neither significantly improved the human rights
situation on the ground nor altered the reality of overall Israeli control across Israel and the
OPT. Instead, the peace process is regularly cited to oppose efforts for rights-based
international action or accountability, 12 and as cover for Israel’s entrenched discriminatory
rule over Palestinians in the OPT. 13
In recent years, Israeli officials have vowed to unilaterally annex additional parts of the
West Bank, 14 and the coalition agreement that led to the formation of an Israeli
government in May 2020 established a process to bring annexation for governmental
approval. 15 In August, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel would delay the move
following an agreement with the United Arab Emirates, but noted that “there is no change
to my plan to extend sovereignty” over the West Bank. 16 Annexation would not change the
reality of Israeli occupation or the protections due to Palestinians as an occupied
population under international humanitarian law.

Although the mechanics and intensity of the abuses differ between the OPT and Israel, the
same power, the government of the state of Israel, has primary control across both. That
(Israeli civil law) and, to ensure their domination, structurally discriminates against
Palestinians and represses them to varying degrees across different areas on issues such
as security of legal status and access to land and resources, as the report documents.
Across Israel and the OPT, Israel grants Jewish Israelis privileges denied to Palestinians
and deprives Palestinians of fundamental rights on account of their being Palestinian.
While the role of different Israeli state entities varies in different parts of the OPT—with the
army, for example, primarily administering the West Bank and exerting control from
outside the territory in Gaza, whereas the same civil authorities that govern in Israel also
rule over East Jerusalem—they all operate under the direction of the Israeli government
headed by the prime minister. Every Israeli government since 1967 has pursued or
maintained abusive policies in the OPT. In the West Bank, at least ten government
ministries directly fund projects to serve settlements, and a Settlement Affairs Ministry
was formed in May 2020. 17 The Knesset has also passed laws and formed committees that
apply exclusively there. 18 The Israeli Supreme Court serves as the court of last resort for
Israeli actions in both Israel and the OPT and has ruled on major cases that have

II. The Crimes Against Humanity of Apartheid
and Persecution
The prohibition of crimes against humanity is among the most fundamental in
international criminal law. The concept, which dates back more than one hundred years
and became clearly part of international criminal law in the 1945 Charter of the
International Military Tribunal that created the court that prosecuted members of the
leadership of Nazi Germany in Nuremberg, refers to a small number of the most serious
crimes under international law. 21
The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which came into force in 2002,
sets out 11 crimes that can amount to a crime against humanity when “committed as part
of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with
knowledge of the attack.” 22 The statute defines “attack” as a “course of action involving
the multiple commission of acts… pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational
policy.” “Widespread” refers to the scale of the acts or number of victims, 23 whereas
“systematic” indicates a “pattern or methodological plan.” 24 Crimes against humanity can
be committed during peace or armed conflict.
The Explanatory Memorandum of the Rome Statute explains that crimes against humanity
“are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity

21 Antonio Cassese and Paola Gaeta, Cassese's International Criminal Law (2nd edition, Oxford University Press; 2008), pp.

22 Rome Statute, art. 7(1).
23 The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) defined “widespread” as “massive, frequent, large scale action,

carried out collectively with considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of victims,” see Prosecutor v.

condoned by a government or a de facto authority.” 25
Among the 11 distinct crimes against humanity are the crimes of apartheid and
persecution. There is no hierarchy among crimes against humanity; they are of the same
gravity and lead to the same consequences under the Rome Statute.
The State of Palestine acceded to the Rome Statute in 2015. 26 It filed a declaration that
gives the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over crimes in the Rome Statute,
including the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution that are alleged to
have been committed in the OPT since June 13, 2014. 27

According to the International Law Commission (ILC), the prohibition against apartheid
represents a peremptory norm of international law. 30 The ILC describes apartheid as “a
serious breach on a widespread scale of an international obligation of essential
importance for safeguarding the human being,” noting its prohibition in a range of legal
instruments within states and “general agreement among Governments as to the
peremptory character” of the prohibition. 31 The International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which has 182 states parties, 32
including Israel and Palestine, declares that “States Parties particularly condemn racial
segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of

Statutory Limitations to War Crimes declared that crimes against humanity included

In 1973, the UN General Assembly adopted a specific convention on apartheid, the
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (“Apartheid
Convention”), declaring it to constitute a crime against humanity. 35 The Apartheid
Convention, which came into force in 1976 and has 109 states parties, including the state
of Palestine but not Israel, states:
The term “the crime of apartheid”, which shall include similar policies and
practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practiced in southern
Africa, shall apply to the following inhuman acts committed for the
purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group
of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically
oppressing them…

36

The Apartheid Convention then identifies a number of “inhuman acts” that, when
committed for the purpose of domination and systematic oppression, make up the crime of
apartheid, including:
(b) Deliberate imposition on a racial group or groups of living conditions
calculated to cause its or their physical destruction in whole or in part;
(c) Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a
racial group or groups from participation in the political, social,
economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of
conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in
particular by denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human

oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group
or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime. 39

Definition of Key Terms
No court has to date heard a case involving the crime of apartheid and therefore
Rome Statute definitions of the crime of apartheid:
Racial Group: Both the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute use the term “racial
group,” but neither defines it. 43 The development of the Apartheid Convention against the
backdrop of events in southern Africa in the 1970s, as referenced in the text of the
Convention, as well as the non-inclusion of other categories beyond race, and the rejection
of proposals by some states to expand the treaty’s scope, could lead to a narrower
interpretation focused on divisions based on skin color. 44 While discussion of the
meaning of “racial group” during the drafting of the Rome Statute appears to have been
minimal, 45 its inclusion in the definition of apartheid, after the end of apartheid in South
Africa and when international human rights law had clearly defined racial discrimination to
include differences of ethnicity, descent, and national origin, indicates that “racial group”
within the Rome Statute reflects, and would likely be interpreted by courts to reflect, a
broader conception of race.
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
(ICERD), which was adopted in 1965 and came into legal force in 1969, defines “racial
discrimination” as “any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race,
colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or
impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of
public life.” 46 The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination

No international criminal case has ruled on the definition of “racial group” in the context of
the crime against humanity of apartheid. But international criminal courts, in the context of
more recent genocide cases, have addressed the meaning of “national, ethnical, racial or
religious group” in the definition of that crime in part by evaluating group identity based
on context and the construction of local actors, in particular the perpetrators, as opposed
to earlier approaches that focused on hereditary physical traits. The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) held that the assessment of whether a particular group may be
considered as protected from the crime of genocide “will proceed on a case-by-case basis,
taking into account both the evidence proffered and the political, social and cultural
context.” 48 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also found
that determinations should be “made on a case-by-case basis, consulting both objective
and subjective criteria.” The court, in particular, held that national, ethnic, racial or
religious groups should be identified “by using as a criterion the stigmatisation of the
group, notably by the perpetrators of the crime, on the basis of its perceived national,
ethnical, racial or religious characteristics.” 49 The ICTY held in a 1999 case that “to attempt
to define a national, ethnical or racial group today using objective and scientifically
irreproachable criteria would be a perilous exercise.” 50

racial and other groups mirrors the evolution in how the social sciences understand race

Israeli law has also interpreted race broadly, not limiting it to skin color. The Israeli Penal
Code defines racism, in the context of the crime of “incitement to racism,” as
“persecution, humiliation, degradation, a display of enmity, hostility or violence, or
causing violence against a public or parts of the population, all because of their color,
racial affiliation or national ethnic origin.” 52 Under Article 7A of Israel’s Basic Law: The
Knesset—1958, which bars candidates from running for office if they engage in
“incitement,” 53 Israel’s Supreme Court has barred candidates, such as from the Jewish
Power (Otzma Yehudit) party, from running for office based on vitriolic comments made
about Palestinians. 54
While it is beyond the scope of this report to analyze the group identities of Jewish Israelis
or Palestinians, it is clear that in the local context, Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are
regarded as separate identity groups that fall within the broad understanding of “racial
group” under international human rights law. The 1950 Law of Return, which guarantees
Jews the right to immigrate to Israel and gain citizenship, defines “Jew” to include “a
person who was born of a Jewish mother,” embracing a descent-based, as opposed to a
purely religious, classification. 55 Many in Israel characterize the virulently anti-Palestinian

Meanwhile, on account of their identity, Palestinians face discrimination and repression,
as this report makes clear. Palestinians have deep cultural, political, economic, social, and
family ties across Israel, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. For
much of the modern era, Palestinians moved freely across these areas, which constituted
mandatory Palestine, under British administration, in the post-World War I era. The
Palestine Liberation Organization Charter defines Palestinians as “those Arab nationals
who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine,” emphasizing that the identity is
“transmitted from parents to children.” 58 Even within Israel where both Jews and
Palestinians are citizens, authorities classify Jews and Palestinians as belonging to
different “nationalities.” 59

Institutionalized Regime: This term, incorporated into the Rome Statute but not the
Apartheid Convention, appears to have originated in a proposal from the US delegation
during the drafting to limit the application of the crime of apartheid to states and exclude
non-state groups. 61 Alongside the term “systematic,” which appears in both the Apartheid
Convention and Rome Statute, the term “regime” underscores the existence of formal
organization and structure, and more than isolated discriminatory policies or acts. 62 The
system can cover entire states or more limited geographic areas, depending on the
allocation of power, unity of authority, or differing oppressive laws, policies, and
institutions, among other factors.
Domination: This term, which lacks a clear definition in law, appears in context to refer to
an intent by one group to maintain heightened control over another, which can involve
control over key levers of political power, land, and resources. The reference is found in
both the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.
The focus on domination, as opposed to formal sovereignty, also indicates that the crime
of apartheid can be carried out by authorities outside its own territory and with respect to
non-citizens. 63 A finding that authorities of one state have committed the crime of
apartheid in an external territory would no more undermine the formal sovereignty the

Systematic Oppression: This term, also without a clear definition in law, appears to refer to
the methods used to carry out an intent to maintain domination. The reference in the
Apartheid Convention to “policies and practices of racial discrimination as practiced in
southern Africa” indicates that oppression must reach a high degree of intensity to meet
the requisite threshold for the crime . 65

Persecution
The crime of persecution traces back to the 1945 International Military Tribunal in
Nuremberg. The tribunal’s charter recognizes “persecutions on political, racial or religious
grounds” as crimes against humanity. 66
The Rome Statute also identifies persecution as a crime against humanity, defining it as “the
intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by
reason of the identity of the group or collectivity.” 67 The statute broadened the scope of the
crime to encompass “any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national,
ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are
universally recognized as impressible under international law.” 68 The statute limits the

crime to applying only “in connection with” other crimes identified under it. 69 The customary

International criminal lawyer Antonio Cassese, who served as a judge in the leading ICTY
case that examined persecution within international criminal law (Prosecutor v. Kupreskic),
identified the crime against humanity of persecution as a crime under customary
international law. 71 He defined persecution under customary international law as referring to
acts that a) result in egregious or grave violations of fundamental human rights, b) are part
of a widespread or systematic practice, and c) are committed with discriminatory intent. 72
Neither the Rome Statute nor customary international law clearly set the threshold of what
constitutes a violation that is sufficiently “severe” or “egregious.” Human Rights Watch
recognizes that many human rights violations cause serious harm. However, for the
determination of whether the crime against humanity of persecution has been committed,
Human Rights Watch requires the most serious forms of violations before the requirements
of “severe” or “egregious” can be met.

Legal Consequences of Finding Crimes Against Humanity
The commission of crimes against humanity can serve as the basis for individual criminal
liability not only in the domestic courts of the perpetrator country but also in international
courts and tribunals, as well as in domestic courts outside the country in question under
the principle of universal jurisdiction. Individual criminal liability extends beyond those
who carry out the acts to those who order, assist, facilitate, aid, and abet the offense.
Under the principle of command responsibility, military, and civilian officials up to the top
of the chain of command can be held criminally responsible for crimes committed by their
subordinates when they knew or should have known that such crimes were being
committed but failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the crimes or punish
those responsible.

In December 2019, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda concluded a nearly five-year
preliminary inquiry into the Palestine situation and determined that “all the statutory
Palestinians had been met. The prosecutor found a “reasonable basis” to believe that war
crimes had been committed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities but did not reference any
crimes against humanity. 73 Although the prosecutor did not require formal judicial
authorization to move forward with a formal investigation, she nonetheless sought a ruling
from the court’s judges on the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction before proceeding. 74
In February 2021, the court ruled that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed in the OPT,
including East Jerusalem, confirming Palestine’s status as a state party to the Rome
Statute able to confer that jurisdiction.

Israeli government policy has long sought to engineer and maintain a Jewish majority in
Israel and maximize Jewish Israeli control over land in Israel and the OPT. Laws, planning
documents, and statements by officials demonstrate that the pursuit of domination by
Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, in particular over demographics and land, guides
government policy, and actions to this day.
This chapter will show that this objective amounts to an intent to maintain domination by
one group over another. When inhumane acts are carried out in the context of systematic
oppression pursuant to that intent to maintain domination, the crime against humanity of
apartheid is committed.
Discriminatory intent, when it gives rise to severe abuses of fundamental rights, also
makes up the crime against humanity of persecution.
To analyze the motivations behind Israeli policies towards Palestinians today, which
developed over many years with much of the architecture established in the early years of
the state and the occupation, this chapter considers materials that in some cases date
back decades. This does not implicate every official cited in seeking to dominate
Palestinians. In fact, some Israeli officials and parties advocated positions that, if
implemented, could have avoided such policies.
Israeli authorities justify some of these policies in the name of security, but, as this
chapter shows, they often use security as a justification to advance demographic
objectives. In other cases, officials advocate for policies to safeguard Israel’s identity as a
Jewish state. Israel can, like any other state, seek to promote a particular identity, but that
does not include a license to violate fundamental rights. Not all policies designed to
promote Judaization constitute rights abuses. Particular policies can, though, provide
evidence of a discriminatory intent or purpose to maintain domination by Jewish Israelis.
Even policies designed to fulfill legitimate security objectives must comply with
international law. As this chapter will show, Israeli authorities have pursued many policies

in ways that manifest a discriminatory intent to systematically dominate Palestinians. The

Demographics
Demographic considerations, in particular the quest for a strong Jewish majority, have long
underlined Israeli government policy. The key declarative line of Israel’s Proclamation of
Independence proclaims the “establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel.” 80 The
proclamation largely narrates the history of the Jewish people and twice in the short
document underscores the centrality of Jewish immigration. While the proclamation does
commit itself to “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants,” it
presents the newly established state as belonging to the Jewish people, describing Israel
as “their state.”
Israel’s Basic Laws, which have constitutional status in the absence of a full constitution,
re-enforce that the state is Jewish, rather than belonging to all its citizens. The Basic Law:
The Knesset—1958, for example, declares that no candidate can run for the Knesset if they
expressly or implicitly endorse “negation of the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish
and democratic state.” 81 The Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty sets out its purpose as
to “establish… the values of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”
The Basic Law: Israel—The Nation-State of the Jewish People (‘Nation-State Law’) passed in
2018, in effect affirms the supremacy of the “Jewish” over the “democratic” character of
the state. The Nation-State Law sets out amid its “basic principles” that Israel is “the
nation state of the Jewish people” and that the “exercise of the right to national selfdetermination in the state of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” Article 7 further states
that “the State views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and shall
act to encourage and promote its establishment and strengthening.” 82 Unlike Israel’s
Proclamation of Independence, the Nation-State Law contains no language about equality.

A Knesset legal advisor said he sought to include “mention of the issue of equality and the
issue of the state belonging to all citizens, [but] the committee chose not to make this into
as a state of all its citizens, but the Knesset presidium disqualified it before it could be
discussed since it “seeks to deny Israel’s existence as the state of the Jewish people,” the
Knesset legal advisor said. 84
Israel’s occupation of the OPT in 1967 amplified Israeli concerns about demographics.
Within Israel’s pre-1967 borders, Jews currently represent about 81 percent of the
population, as compared to about 19 percent of Palestinians. 85 But, when combining all of
the OPT with Israel, Jews and Palestinians are in rough parity. And even when restricting
the calculus to Israel and the West Bank, the part of the OPT that Israeli authorities covet
for Jewish settlement, and excluding Gaza’s significant Palestinian population, the Jewish
majority stands at 59 percent compared to 41 percent Palestinians. Many of the practices
outlined in this report can be traced to the Israeli government’s desire to maintain Jewish
control while retaining the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which adds 3.1 million
Palestinians to the land it controls, in addition to the 1.6 million who reside in Israel. 86
Statements by Israeli prime ministers and other senior officials highlight the extent to
which the intent to maintain demographic control has guided policymaking. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, in a March 10, 2019, post on the social media platform Instagram,
stated, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens,” but rather “the nation-state of the Jewish

people and only them.” 87 In December 2003, in between terms as prime minister,
Netanyahu said at a conference that "if there is a demographic problem, and there is, it is
that strive to integrate “Israel’s Arabs” with ensuring they do not reach 35-40 percent of
the population. 88 He warned that “if their numbers will reach 35-40 percent of the country,
then the Jewish state will be annulled.” 89 He also stated that the separation barrier,
ostensibly erected to enhance Israel’s security, would also help to prevent a “demographic
spillover” of Palestinians from the West Bank. 90
Demographic-driven policymaking extends beyond Prime Minister Netanyahu. Even Israeli
leaders who supported Israel’s withdrawal from a greater portion of the West Bank than
others did often make demographics—the need for Israel to preserve a Jewish majority—
one of their central arguments. Netanyahu’s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, said in 2003, three
years before he became prime minister, that “the demographic issue” would “dictate the
solution we must adopt” and that the “formula for the parameters of a unilateral solution
are: to maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians.” 91 His
predecessor, Ariel Sharon, as prime minister, said in a 2002 Knesset debate that while
Palestinian citizens had “rights in the land,” “all rights over the land of Israel are Jewish
rights.” 92 His predecessor Ehud Barak, when he was prime minister, equated a “Muslim
majority” with “destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.” 93 His predecessor as prime
minister, Shimon Peres, while serving as president in 2012 said that “Israeli settlements in

demographic change” and “places a Jewish majority in the state of Israel at risk.” 94 His
predecessor as prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said that “the red line for Arabs is 20% of
character of the state of Israel.” 95
While states are sometimes associated with a religious or ethnic identity, a states’
prerogative to define its own identity and promote it is not unlimited; it is not a license to
violate the fundamental rights of others. Laws and policies adopted by the Israeli
government to preserve a Jewish majority have afforded benefits to Jews at the expense of
the fundamental rights of Palestinians. Most significantly in demonstrating Israel’s
demographic goals is the 1950 Law of Return. It guarantees Jewish citizens of other
countries the right to settle in Israel, and its 1952 Citizenship Law entitles them to
citizenship. 96 The same Citizenship Law, by contrast, denies Palestinian refugees and
their descendants, 5.7 million of whom were registered as of February 2021 with the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), 97 the ability to enter and live in areas where
they or their families once lived and have maintained links to. The right to live in Israel or
the OPT is guaranteed to them under international human rights law, alongside the options
of integration in place or resettlement elsewhere. 98 These policies create a reality where a
Jewish citizen of any other country who has never been to Israel can move there or to a
West Bank settlement and automatically gain citizenship, while a Palestinian refugee
expelled from his home and languishing for more than 70 years in a refugee camp in a
nearby country cannot move to either Israel or the OPT.

The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003, which prohibits
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza with few exceptions from obtaining citizenship
demographic control. 99 Ariel Sharon, commenting in 2005 when he was prime minister on
the renewal of the temporary law, said, “There’s no need to hide behind security
arguments. There’s a need for the existence of a Jewish state.” 100 He later added that
authorities had “a correct and important intention of Israel being a Jewish state with a
massive Jewish majority” and that “we must do everything so that this state remains a
Jewish state in the future.” 101 Giora Eiland, national security advisor at the time, who
served on a committee in 2005 examining immigration policies, conceded that “the
Citizenship Law is the way to overcome the demographic demon.” 102 Then-finance minister
Benjamin Netanyahu put it more directly during discussions over renewing the law:
“Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want to get citizenship, we should make
the process much more difficult, in order to guarantee Israel’s security and a Jewish
majority in Israel.” 103 Eli Yishai, while serving as minister of interior affairs, said in 2012
that approving a larger number of family unification applications from the West Bank
would constitute “national suicide.” 104
In practice, the Interior Ministry’s policies and practices have long aimed at ensuring
Jewish Israeli demographic control. In 2004, The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI)
released a report finding that the Israeli Interior Ministry’s population registry
systematically denies applications by Palestinians and other non-Jews for residency,
family reunification, or granting status to children “only because they are non-Jews.” The

registry, which ACRI charges “views itself as defender of the Jewish character of the state,”
subjects applicants to “organized and methodical bureaucratic harassment” in order to
policy that particularly harms Palestinians. 105 The Interior Ministry continues to erect
bureaucratic hurdles, in particular for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. 106 At the same time,
authorities and quasi-state institutions have for years actively sought to boost Jewish
immigration to Israel. 107
Israeli authorities have also since 1967 effectively controlled the population registry in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, recording every Palestinian birth, marriage, divorce, address
change, and death. Between 1967 and 1994, they struck from it hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch has documented. 108 The Israeli army has used
residency status to control the ability of Palestinians to reside in, move within, and travel
abroad from the West Bank, as well as to travel from Gaza to Israel and the West Bank. 109
These restrictions are implemented in so sweeping a fashion that it is difficult to see them
as motivated primarily by security – rather than demographic – considerations. 110
Some Israeli laws provide benefits on the basis of criteria other than nationality, but the
purpose remains privileging Jews over Palestinians. These laws often are not
discriminatory on their face, using proxies to mask discriminatory intent, even as in some
cases officials extoll the demographic logic. For example, in 2002, the Israeli Knesset cut

by four percent the child allowance for all Israeli families, but 24 percent for children
whose parents had not served in the army. 111 The overwhelming majority of Palestinians do
the army, they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not
available to Palestinians. 112
Statements by Israeli officials at the time make clear the discriminatory intent behind this
move. Reporting on 2003 and 2004 statistics that showed a drop in the Israeli birthrate,
primarily driven by a decline among Palestinian citizens of Israel, Haaretz in January 2005
attributed to the Finance Ministry the view that “the drop of birthrate is a clear result of the
cutbacks in child support allocations over the past two years.” Haaretz quotes a senior
Finance Ministry official, who asked to be unnamed, citing the “internal demographic
threat” and expressing concern over “the high birthrate of the Arabs, and especially the
Negev Bedouin.” The official said that “we are reversing the graph, to defend the Jewish
majority in the country,” and warned, according to Haaretz, that reinstating the allowance
would lead to the state having to support large families in places like the Negev, which
would have the effect of undermining the Jewish majority. 113
While at times striking down discriminatory state policies, the Israeli Supreme Court has
endorsed demographics-driven decision-making. For example, in a prominent 2000 case
declaring that the state could not discriminate directly on the basis of religion and
nationality in allocating state land, Supreme Court President Aharon Barak highlighted the
favored legal status of Jewish Israelis when it came to acquiring residency. He wrote that
“it is true, members of the Jewish nation were granted a special key to enter (see the Law
of Return-5710-1950), but once a person has lawfully entered the home, he enjoys equal
rights with all other household members.” 114 Israel has long used its control over the
“house” to maintain a solid Jewish majority, at the expense of Palestinians. Citing another
well-known opinion by Barak, Asher Grunis, then deputy president of the Supreme Court

Control Over Land
Alongside demographic control, Israeli authorities have sought to ensure Jewish control
over the land and natural resources in Israel and the OPT. Israeli authorities have largely
pursued the goals of demographic and land domination in parallel, seeking to maximize
the land available for Jewish communities and largely confine Palestinians to dense
population centers.
In February 1948, Ben Gurion, then chairperson of the Jewish Agency before becoming
prime minister, reported the night after visiting Lifta, 116 a Palestinian village in the suburbs
of Jerusalem whose residents fled or were expelled from their homes:
When you enter the city through Lifta and Romema, through Mahaneh
Yehuda, King George Street and Me’ah She’arim –there are no Arabs. One
hundred percent Jews… What happened in Jerusalem and in Haifa—can
happen in large parts of the country. If we persist it is quite possible that in
the next six or eight months there will be considerable changes in the
country, very considerable and to our advantage. There will certainly be
considerable changes in the demographic composition of the country. 117
Israel’s seizure of thousands of dunams of land from Palestinians in 1948 and in
subsequent decades in Israel and the OPT have aimed to serve the exclusive interest of
Jewish Israelis. Reflecting just on the situation inside Israel, a 2003 Israeli governmentcommissioned report found that “the expropriation activities were clearly and explicitly

harnessed to the interests of the Jewish majority, and the land was transferred to entities
such as the Jewish National Fund (JNF), which according to its own definition serves Jewish
patterns, served a similar objective.” 118 The Israel Land Administration manages and
allocates 93 percent of the land in Israel, 119 meaning this government-commission report
found that the state uses the overwhelming majority of land in Israel to serve only one
community, Jewish Israelis.
Semi-governmental bodies like the JNF, Jewish Agency, and WZO that serve the Jewish
community and no other constituency, play central roles in this effort. A 1953 Knesset law
endows JNF, or Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael in Hebrew, with governmental authorities, 120 and
Israel’s Basic Law: Israel Lands (1960) notes that ownership over its land “shall not be
transferred either by sale or in any other manner.” 121 JNF owns 13 percent of Israeli land,
which the Israel Land Authority (ILA) manages. JNF makes up nearly half the governing
board of the ILA, which controls 93 percent of the land in Israel. 122
The explicit mandate of the JNF is to develop and lease land for Jews and not any other
segment of the population. Under the terms of its Memorandum and Articles of
Association, the JNF acquires property “for the purpose of settling Jews on such lands and
properties.” 123 In a 2004 court filing, the JNF made clear that it “is not a public body that
works for the benefit of all citizens of the state. The loyalty of JNF is given to the Jewish
people and only to them is the JNF obligated.” 124 The JNF long interpreted its mandate as

Following a lawsuit brought by rights groups though, Israeli authorities have allowed nonland of equal value elsewhere. 126 Haaretz, though, has reported that Palestinians have
faced “red tape” far exceeding what Jews face when purchasing JNF land, delaying
registration by years or more. 127
JNF leaders have also said they have pursued similar policies in the West Bank since
1967. 128 The Israeli group Peace Now has documented at least 65,000 dunams of land in
the West Bank that the JNF has purchased since 1967 for settlements. 129 In February 2021,
JNF’s leadership and board approved changing its policies to allow it to expand its
purchase of land in the West Bank for settlements. 130
Israeli law also affords semi-governmental status to the World Zionist Organization
(WZO) and the Jewish Agency. A 1952 law establishes the organizations, then a single
entity, as “the authorised agent” of the state “for the development and settlement of the
country” and “absorption of immigrants from the Diaspora.” 131 The Jewish Agency,

The WZO’s Settlement Division, operating under the direct control of the Israeli

and the Galilee; the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has described them as “the government’s
the Galilee.” 139
Israeli authorities have pursued an explicit policy of ensuring Jewish control over
geographic areas with strategic importance where there are concentrations of Palestinians
across Israel and the OPT. Judaization of these areas contributed to facilitating Israeli
government control over Palestinian population centers, dividing communities, and
blocking the establishment of larger, contiguous Palestinian municipal areas in locations
that Israeli authorities covet or consider particularly strategic. This strategy also
contributes to generally diluting the Palestinian population in some areas and pushing
them into crowded population centers.

Israel (Galilee and Negev)
In Israel, authorities maintain a policy to Judaize the Galilee and Negev regions, one
pursued in coordination with the JNF, the Jewish Agency, and the WZO. These areas
account for nearly two-thirds of the land in Israel, 140 and encompass much of the
Palestinian population. 141 The Israeli government has a ministry focused on the
“development” of the Galilee and the Negev, has invested significantly in these areas, and
has considered it a major government priority for much of the past two decades. 142 In
2004, the Sharon government unveiled a cross-sectional plan estimated to cost 16.8 NIS
billion ($5 billion) that aimed to “increase the number of residents in the Negev to 1.5

While Israeli authorities use non-discriminatory language of seeking to “develop” or
“populate” these regions, the Israeli rights group Sikkuy wrote in 2005 that “it is clear to
everyone that the plan is intended for Jewish residents.” 145 The Negev plan, for example,
defined the ideal new residents as a “strong population,” including “families with high
income” who work in central Israel, an area that has a much higher proportion of Jews to
Palestinians and who will continue to commute to their old jobs. 146 Authorities also
offered a 90 percent discount on the leasing fees for Negev properties to soldiers who
had served for at least one year, an offer that would attract mainly Jews since Bedouins
are exempt from military service and only a small percentage volunteer to serve in the
army. 147 Shimon Peres, then deputy prime minister, described the development of the
Negev and the Galilee as a “battle for the future of the Jewish people.” 148 The Jewish
Agency has said that it sought to guarantee a “Zionist majority” in the Negev and the
Galilee, launching its own programs in these areas “to get around the problem that the
government must act on behalf of all citizens of the state of Israel while the WZO is
entitled to act for the sake of the Jewish people.” 149 The government approved the WZO
establishing settlements in these areas. 150

In December 2007, Minister for the Development of the Negev and Galilee Jacob Edery,
reflecting on new demographic data, said, “We have to do everything we can to boost
towns in the Negev and Galilee with up to 400 households to maintain admissions
committees that can reject applicants from living there for being “not suitable for the
social life of the community” or for incompatibility with the “social-cultural fabric.” 152 The
law’s sponsors openly spoke about how the law would facilitate the creation and
maintenance of Jewish-only communities. 153 In June 2019, then Transportation Minister
Bezalel Smotrich said that “I intend to Judaize the Galilee” and “lay down a network of
roads, to complete a revolution, so that hundreds of thousands of Jews will come to live in
the Galilee.” 154 The month before, the JNF announced its aim to bring 1.5 million residents
to the Negev and Galilee by 2040. 155

2009 that such a law would allow towns to be “established by people who want to live with other Jews.” In a radio interview
that month, Rotem said the law would codify screening procedures so that Jewish Israelis could “establish a place where
everybody is an army veteran, a Yeshiva alumni, or something of that sort.” Another sponsor, Yisrael Hasson of the Kadima
party, said in December 2010 that "the bill reflects the Knesset's commitment to work to preserve the ability to realize the
Zionist dream in practice in the state of Israel" through "population dispersal” which the government had begun "thirty years
ago ... [with] a string of small communities in the Galilee and Negev." He added, "realization of these goals obliged us as
legislators to ensure the existence of a screening mechanism for applicants to these communities.” See “Israel: New Laws

The government’s historic policies towards these areas provide further context for
determining the intent behind its current policies. The plan to Judaize the Galilee, a
region largely slated to fall within the “Arab State” in the 1947 UN Partition Plan, dates
back to the 1950s when it emerged as part of a strategy to consolidate Israeli control of
the area. 156 A senior Israeli official at the time wrote that the Palestinian presence in
these areas threatened Israeli control, worrying that Palestinians would “invade all
areas we neglect, strike footholds and establish new roots.” 157 Ben Gurion told the
Knesset that Israel’s imposition of military rule over most Palestinians in Israel at the

time aimed “to protect the right to Jewish settlement in all parts of the state.” 158 The
plan to Judaize the Galilee focused initially on creating and sustaining Jewish
the growth of nearby Palestinian communities. 159
The Israeli newspaper Al HaMishmar in 1976 published a leaked government document
drafted by Yisrael Koenig, then northern district commissioner of the Interior Ministry. 160
The memo, entitled “Top Secret: Memorandum-Proposal Handling the Arabs of Israel,” lays
out the demographic situation in the area, showing that Jews maintain a slight
demographic majority but will be overtaken in a few years if birthrates continue at current
rates. It then recommends that authorities “expand and deepen Jewish settlement in areas
where the contiguity of the Arab population is prominent, and where they number
considerably more than the Jewish population; [and] examine the possibility of diluting
existing Arab population concentrations.” While officials condemned the plan and said it
had not been acted on, 161 Koenig remained in his role for more than a decade after the
memo’s publication, a leaked 1995 map by a regional planning committee echoed similar
objectives, and elements of the strategy bear resemblance to policies that have been
carried out since. 162

remove them from key Negev routes and secure the land for settling Jews and building
army bases. 164 Concentrating Palestinian Bedouin communities on limited pieces of
territory remains at the heart of Israeli government plans for the Negev.
The strategy of maximizing Jewish settlement alongside suppression of the Palestinian
population continues. In the Negev, for example, Sharon in December 2000, just before
becoming prime minister and pursuing the development of the Negev as a principal
goal, wrote:
In the Negev, we face a serious problem: About 900,000 dunams of
government land are not in our hands, but in the hands of the Bedouin
population. I, as a resident of the Negev, see this problem every day. It is,
essentially, a demographic phenomenon… Out of weakness, perhaps also
lack of awareness about the issue, we, as a country, are doing nothing to
confront this situation… The Bedouin are grabbing new territory. They are
gnawing away at the country’s land reserves, and no one is doing anything
significant about it. 165

Jerusalem
The Israeli government’s formal policy for Jerusalem, including both west and the occupied
east, is to pursue “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city,” as stated in the
government’s plan for the municipality (“Jerusalem Outline Plan 2000”), and limiting the
number of Palestinian residents. Concern with demographics in Jerusalem dates back to the
early days of the state but accelerated with Israel’s unilateral annexation of occupied East
Jerusalem and parts of surrounding villages in 1967. Annexation expanded the boundaries of
the city that Israeli authorities consider the country’s capital, but also brought more
Palestinians into an area that authorities treat as part of its sovereign territory. To mitigate
the demographic effect of this move, authorities granted Palestinians from East Jerusalem
permanent residency rather than an easy path to citizenship and instituted other policies
aimed to foster and maintain a Jewish demographic majority in the city.
Following annexation, Israeli officials set a target “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arab,”
although planners later acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the
demographic trend” and adjusted it to a 60-40 percent target. 168 Within Palestinian
communities, the plan, by its own terms, “enables a densification of the rural villages and
densification and thickening of the existing urban neighborhoods.” 169
When delineating Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries in 1967, authorities primarily focused
on, as the Israeli rights group B’Tselem puts it, “demographic concerns, chief among them
to leave out densely populated Palestinian areas in order to ensure a Jewish majority in
Jerusalem.” 170 Israel, in total, added 72 square kilometers, including land that belonged to

Israeli officials, soon after taking control of East Jerusalem in 1967, confiscated land and
established several settlements, including Ramat Eshkol, Ma’alot Dafna, Givat HaMivtar,
and French Hill, to establish a “bolt,” in the parlance of the Israeli government, connecting
West Jerusalem and Mount Scopus, which was effectively a Jewish island encircled by East
Jerusalem before 1967. 172 Israeli authorities also confiscated land to establish other
settlements, including Ramot Alon and Gilo, to create a “ring,” as they described it, around
the center of Jerusalem and, as one academic writes, “thus preventing any prospect for a
continuity of Arab neighborhoods.” 173 The establishment of a “bolt” and “ring” around
Jerusalem, which authorities continued to fortify through the expansion of settlements in
subsequent years, aimed at bolstering Israeli Jewish control over the city. 174
The newly-annexed area included 66,000 Palestinian residents, 24 percent of the new
municipality’s population. A government commission set up in late 1972 to evaluate Israeli
policy in Jerusalem recommended the government strive to maintain the “ratio of Jews to
Arabs that existed at the end of 1972,” or 73.5 percent Jewish Israeli and 26.5
Palestinian. 175 The government adopted this recommendation and subsequent
governments have reaffirmed it. 176 When formulating Israel’s first municipal plan for
Jerusalem in 1975, Israel Kimhi, then director of planning policy at the Interior Ministry,

For Jewish Jerusalem, I did something in the past twenty-five years. For East
Jerusalem? Nothing! What did I do? Nothing. Sidewalks? Nothing. Cultural
institutions? Not one. Yes, we installed a sewerage system for them and
improved the water supply. Do you know why? Do you think it was for their
good, for their welfare? Forget it! There were some cases of cholera there,
and the Jews were afraid that they would catch it, so we installed sewerage
and a water system against cholera.

The Israeli government’s decision to apply the 1952 Law of Entry to Palestinians from East
Jerusalem, the law applicable to foreigners who enter Israel and want to reside there, and
offer them permanent residency, instead of automatic citizenship, further demonstrates
the extent to which demography dictates Israeli policy in Jerusalem. 180 The Jerusalem 2000
Outline Plan makes clear that “the continued proportional growth of the Arab population in
Jerusalem is bound to reduce the ratio of the Jewish population in the future” and that, in
order to prevent “the continued proportional growth of the Palestinian population in
Jerusalem in comparison with the Jewish population [or] even worse, from taking place, we
will need far-reaching changes in our approach to the key variables influencing the

West Bank
The Israeli government has pursued the same formulation in the West Bank as in Israel and
East Jerusalem: maximum control over the land, largely for the benefit of Jews. While
governments have at times differed on what arrangements should govern Palestinians
living in the West Bank, the objectives and reality on the ground have remained largely
consistent over successive governments. On July 7, 1967, exactly one month after the
Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel’s then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of the Labor
Party said, “The security and the land are in Israeli hands.” 182 In a party meeting that year,
Eshkol clarified that authorities “covet the dowry, not the bride,” 183 an apparent reference
to wanting the West Bank without the Palestinians who live there. Fifty-two years later, on
July 10, 2019, Prime Minister Netanyahu of the Likud said, “Israeli military and security
forces will continue to rule the entire territory, up to the Jordan [River].” 184 He added on
May 28, 2020, that “we are the ones dictating security rules over the entire territory,”
describing West Bank Palestinians as “subjects.” 185
The current map of the West Bank reflects decades of shifting Israeli governmental plans
for the territory. Israel’s earliest plans for the West Bank, including an unofficial plan
initially drafted in July 1967 by then-Labor Minister Yigal Allon, envisioned Israeli control
over the Jordan Valley and other parts of the West Bank. In an essay he published in 1976
in Foreign Affairs explaining the plan, Allon insisted on the necessity of “absolute Israeli
control over the strategic zone to the east of the dense Arab population, concentrated as it

186

The plan, retaining Israel’s control over the

Jordan Valley and of the corridor around Jerusalem, effectively divided Palestinians in the
including Hebron and Bethlehem, and one in the east around Jericho. 187
Allon’s logic focused on the strategic and security importance of Israeli control of the West
Bank, but in justifying the need for control without formally annexing territory with large
Palestinian populations, references the aim “to preserve [Israel’s] Jewish character.” 188
Allon certainly appeared motivated by a desire to safeguard the security of Israel and its
citizens, as have subsequent officials. Some regard the settlement enterprise as vital for
security. 189 Whatever the motive, it is unacceptable to pursue this aim through a strategy
of seeking to dominate Palestinians, maintaining a discriminatory system, and engaging in
tactics that either have an insufficient security justification or otherwise violate
international law. An intent to ensure security neither negates an intent to dominate, nor
grants a carte blanche to undertake policies that go beyond what international law
permits. While security grounds can justify a range of restrictive measures under
international humanitarian and human rights law, a strategy that seeks to promote security
by ensuring the demographic advantage of one group of people through discrimination or
oppression has no basis under international law.
Subsequent Israeli policies built on the Allon plan. In October 1977, the Israeli government
formally adopted a plan produced by Ariel Sharon, then both the chairperson of the
Ministerial Committee for Settlement Affairs and agriculture minister, that expanded on the
Allon Plan by strengthening Israeli control in the western West Bank, to the east of the
Green Line. 190 The plan called for creating rings of “security zones” in order to, as former
Israeli official and analyst Shaul Arieli put it, “prevent the Palestinian population from

1980 plan formulated by the World Zionist Organization’s Settlement Division, the body
charged with establishing settlements and fully funded by the government and operating
directly under its control, built on the prior schemes. The “Drobles Plan” as it was known,
named after its author and head of the Settlement Division, Matityahu Drobles, called for
Israeli authorities “to settle the land between the [Arab] minority population centers and
their surroundings,” noting that doing so would make it “hard for Palestinians to create
territorial contiguity and political unity.” The plan further noted that any autonomy granted
to Palestinians, as set out in the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel of the late
1970s, did “not apply to the territories but rather to the Arab population alone” and that
“there cannot be any shadow of a doubt about our intention to maintain perpetual control
over the territory of Judea and Samaria.” 193 It adds that “the best and most effective way to
remove any trace of doubt about our intention to control Judea and Samaria forever is
through accelerated surge of settlements in these areas,” in particular to “create the
widest possible spread” of settlements and “establish additional settlements next to every
existing settlement.”

A 1997 strategic plan by the WZO Settlement Division specified a series of additional
measures to further cement Israeli rule over the West Bank. It called for expanding
“settlement zones” to include military sites, nature reserves, archaeological sites, and
adjacent state land, joining them with “topographically high points overlooking
settlements, traffic arteries, and infrastructure corridors” to establish “contiguous
stretches of land” under Israel’s control. It highlighted several areas of strategic
importance, including around Jerusalem, in the northwest West Bank, in the Jordan Valley,
in the South Hebron Hills, and the northern edge of the West Bank, for which Israel should
remain in control to “serve as buffer zones” and provide settlers “with a completely normal
Israeli life in all ways.” It further designates “three strategic lateral corridors,” or strategic
roads to run east-west across the West Bank, to serve as the “backbone” connecting the
various settlements, “prevent uncontrolled Arab building,” and preserve “balance
between the size of the Israeli and Arab populations.” 198

In 2001, shortly after his election as prime minister, Sharon said, “It’s not by accident that
the settlements are located where they are,” so that “come what may, we have to hold the

hill aquifer.” 199
In 2014, Member of Knesset (MK) Yariv Levin, appointed the following year as Israel’s
minister of aliyah (Jewish Immigration) and integration, said, “The correct policy, from the
point of view of Israeli interests regarding our political ability at the moment, is to combine
the attempt to hold the maximum amount of territory and apply sovereignty over the
maximum amount of territory while keeping the Arab population within it to a minimum.
The situation already exists in Area C, which is under our control – there are little more
than fifty thousand Arabs.” 200 In February 2021, Avi Naim, who served as director-general
for Israel’s Ministry for Settlement Affairs between July and October 2020, underscored the
government’s objective to “prevent Palestinian territorial continuity” and “keep control of
land reserves in Judea and Samaria”. 201
Israeli authorities have taken a variety of steps to limit the numbers of Palestinians in the
West Bank, including denying residency rights to Palestinians for being abroad when the
occupation began in 1967, or for long periods during the first few decades of the
occupation; imposing an effective freeze on family reunification over the past two
decades; and largely restricting movement from Gaza to the West Bank, as described in a
subsequent chapter of this report. 202 Palestinian residents of Area C face an additional

While officials have sometimes maintained that measures taken in the occupied West
Bank are temporary, the government’s actions and policies over more than a half-century
example, while the Israeli government formally declared that it built the separation barrier
in the early 2000s “to reduce the entry of terrorists from Judea and Samaria to carry out
terror attacks in Israel,” 204 senior Israeli officials have openly spoken about the barrier
facilitating the takeover of land. 205 B’Tselem and Bimkom– Planners for Planning Rights
documented how the route largely aimed to incorporate settlement blocs, while
minimizing the number of Palestinians included. 206 The Israeli government itself conceded
in court proceedings that the expansion plans of settlements factored into its
considerations around the route of the barrier, which does not follow the Green Line but
rather incorporates on the “Israeli side” thousands of dunams of land. 207
Beyond the land grabs, authorities have entirely integrated the settlements’ sewage
system, communication and road networks, and electrical grids and water infrastructure
with Israel proper. In December 2017, the attorney general issued guidelines requiring that
all government-sponsored bills specify their application to settlers or otherwise justify why
they do not. 208 In recent years, the Knesset has passed a growing number of laws that
apply specifically to the West Bank, including a law allowing authorities to retroactively
expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements have been built, a law that
transfers petitions brought against state policy to an administrative court instead of the
Supreme Court and a law that brings universities in settlements under Israel’s Council for

Gaza Strip
From 1967 until the early 2000s, Israeli policy towards the occupied Gaza Strip mirrored its
approach to the West Bank, maximizing control over the land, privileging the more than
7,500 settlers who lived there, 211 and subjugating the Palestinians of Gaza. 212 The Israeli
government’s withdrawal of its settler population from Gaza in 2005 reflected not a
departure from the objective of demographic and land control in the OPT, but rather a
recalibration in light of the large Palestinian population inhabiting a small strip of land and
the burden of securing a tiny Jewish settler community there. It marked a shift to focus on
ensuring Jewish demographic control over the areas it hopes to retain permanently—
namely, Israel and much, if not all, of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Withdrawal
effectively took the large Palestinian population there off Israel’s demographic balance
sheet and allowed Israeli authorities to consolidate a solid Jewish majority in their books
across Israel and the remainder of the OPT that they intended to retain, while maintaining
control of Gaza via other means.
Israeli officials at the time acknowledged the demographic objectives behind the move. On
August 15, 2005, the day the Israeli government set as a deadline for settlers to voluntarily
leave Gaza, Prime Minister Sharon said in an evening address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot be
held onto forever. Over one million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers

Authorities, in fact, explicitly said that they wanted to redirect the resources that went into
the settler community in Gaza to strengthening Jewish Israeli control over parts of Israel
and the West Bank. The early 2000s push, for example, to Judaize the Galilee and the
Negev came as Israeli authorities were putting in motion their plans to withdraw from
Gaza. Haaretz quoted an advisor to Prime Minister Sharon at the time as saying that
Sharon “reached the conclusion that following the enormous investment in settling the
territories, it is now necessary to settle the Galilee and the Negev.” 215
Following Hamas’s wresting control of the Gaza Strip from the PA in 2007, the Israeli
government, which had a practice of security cooperation with the PA but hostile relations
with Hamas, announced restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of
Gaza. It declared Gaza “hostile territory” and took a range of measures aimed at, among
other things, weakening the economy. 216 As a central part of their policy, Israeli authorities
have enforced what they call “a policy of separation” between Gaza and the West Bank,
which they say serves “both security and political goals.” 217 In March 2019, the Jerusalem

army’s “Procedure for Settlement in the Gaza Strip by Residents of Judea and Samaria,”
published in 2018, states that “[i]n 2006, a decision was made to introduce a policy of
separation between the Judea and Samaria Area and the Gaza Strip in light of Hamas’ rise
to power in the Gaza Strip. The policy currently in effect is aimed at reducing travel
between the areas.” The document, though, notes that “a resident of Judea and Samaria
may file an application for permanent settlement in the Gaza Strip for any purpose that is
considered humanitarian (usually family unification).” It then clarifies that “as settlement
of Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area is possible only in the rarest cases… the
need to allow the family to be maintained in the Gaza Strip arises.” 220
Its guidelines for Gaza residents seeking to settle in the West Bank, published in a
separate Israeli army document, re-enforce the same policy. It sets out that “for all
practical purposes entry of residents of Gaza into the Judea and Samaria Area shall only be
allowed in the most exceptional humanitarian cases.” It notes that the deputy defense
minister “established that in every case involving the settlement of Gaza residents in the
Judea and Samaria Area one should adopt the most restrictive policy” and “clarified that a

would fundamentally undermine the policy of separation and of reducing movement between the areas, as outlined by the
government;” and “The policy on travel between the State of Israel and the Gaza Strip, including the separation policy
pertaining to travel between the Gaza Strip and the Judea and Samaria Area, has been developed according to various
security and state policy considerations,” Tzafia Raduan and Others v Minister of Defense, HCJ 5911/17 Preliminary Response

Gisha found, based on information obtained from the Israeli army via Freedom of
Information requests, that between 2009 and March 2017, the Israeli army had approved
only six applications for Gaza residents to reside in the West Bank, in each case following
the filing of a petition to Israel’s Supreme Court. Four of the six cases involved children
who had no one to care for them in Gaza. 222 By contrast, between January 2011 and August
2014, the army approved 58 applications for West Bank residents to relocate to Gaza on
the condition they sign a pledge never to return to the West Bank. 223 In addition, between
2004 and 2017, the Israeli army removed back to Gaza more than 130 Palestinians from
Gaza living in the West Bank without a valid Israeli-issued permit, but apparently none in
the other direction. 224
These policies pressure Palestinians to leave the part of the OPT that authorities covet for
Jewish settlement—the West Bank—for the Gaza Strip, and join the more than 2 million
Palestinians who are effectively off the demographic balance sheet in the lands where
Jews reside. Without Gaza, the demographic ratio of Jews to Palestinians between the river
and the sea shifts from about 50-50 to a 59-41 Jewish majority.

In addition, Israeli officials have at times encouraged the emigration of Palestinians from
Gaza out of the OPT altogether. 225 In August 2019, a senior official apparently close to
of Palestinians from Gaza and would cover the emigration costs and even allow
Palestinians to use an Israeli airfield to leave for their new host countries. 226

Fragmentation
The fragmentation of Palestinian populations, in part deliberately created through the
separation policy between the West Bank and Gaza, the restrictions on movement between
East Jerusalem and the rest of the OPT, and the range of restrictions on residency rights,
serves as another tool of ensuring domination. In particular, fragmentation divides
populations and facilitates the demographic engineering that is key to preserving political
control by Jewish Israelis, and further frays political and social ties among Palestinians,
thereby weakening resistance to Israeli rule. 227

Conclusion
The pursuit by Israeli authorities of the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control vis-avis Palestinians over demographics and land in Israel and the OPT amounts to a “purpose”
or purposes “of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons
225 For example, the Israeli military government obtained lists from local Palestinian leaders (mukhtars) in Gaza of families

that had been separated and offered to pay the remaining family members to leave Gaza. According to US diplomatic records
from 1968, a teenage boy whose father had already left Gaza reported to the International Committee of the Red Cross that
Israeli military agents offered to pay 500 liras if he left with his mother and siblings. In addition, the Israeli military
encouraged emigration from Gaza by deciding that the standard of living in Gaza should be “reasonable” but only “close to
that which existed before the occupation;” according to one document, this meant that Israel would not create new sources
of income for refugees living in camps. Tom Segev, “The June 1967 War and the Refugee Problem,” Journal of Palestine

As just outlined, the Israeli government pursues policies and practices in the OPT and

Palestinians. However, the severity and means used vary according to location.
In the OPT, Israel methodically subjugates the more than 5 million Palestinians living

amount to “systematic oppression” for the purpose of the crime of apartheid.

By contrast to the differences in the treatment of Palestinians, Israeli authorities grant all
Jewish Israelis the same rights and privileges regardless of which side of the Green Line
they live on. The effect, to varying degrees, is to privilege them over Palestinians in most
aspects of life, including with legal status, access to land and freedom to build, and
allocation of resources and services.

Systematic Oppression in the OPT
West Bank
Since they seized the West Bank on June 7, 1967, Israeli authorities have ruled over the
entire territory. That day, the army issued a proclamation establishing that its West Bank
area commander has “all legislative, executive and judicial powers” over the occupied
territory. 230 Since then, the army has issued hundreds of military orders governing many
aspects of everyday life, including regulating freedom of movement and access to land and
natural resources, except for in East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967
and has governed under its civil law. 231 Israeli authorities have exclusive control over Area
C, comprising about 60 percent of the West Bank. Following its establishment in 1994, the
PA has managed some affairs in Areas A and B, which comprise the remaining 40 percent,
namely, education, health care, and other civil affairs. Israeli authorities, however, greatly
restrict its powers even in Areas A and B and retain primary control across the West Bank
over many aspects of the lives of Palestinians, including over borders, control of natural
resources, airspace, movement of people and goods, security, and the population registry.

Since 1967, Israeli authorities have established more than 280 settlements in the West
Bank, including 138 they formally recognize, and 150 “outposts”—settlements without
security—in the West Bank, as well as 12 settlements in East Jerusalem and several
settlement enclaves inside Palestinian neighborhoods in parts of East Jerusalem and
Hebron. 232 Authorities have done so in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention’s
prohibition against the transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population to occupied
territory. 233 Israeli authorities bar Palestinians in the West Bank from entering settlements,
except as laborers bearing special permits, 234 and nearly all settlers are Jewish Israelis.
Israeli authorities treat the more than 441,000 Israeli settlers and 2.7 million Palestinians
who reside in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, under distinct bodies of law. 235
They also treat the two population groups unequally on a range of issues, including
protection of civil and political rights; methods of law enforcement; freedom of movement;
freedom to build; and access to water, electricity, infrastructure, and other resources

West Bank but that do not convey citizenship or nationality. 236 Only Palestinians
registered in the Israeli-controlled population registry are eligible to receive an identity
card or passport. Israeli authorities have refused to register, or denied residency to,
hundreds of thousands of West Bank Palestinians on the grounds that they were either
outside the territory when the occupation began in 1967 or spent time abroad between
1967 and 1994. 237 By contrast, Jewish Israelis living in the West Bank are Israeli citizens
who cannot lose that status no matter how many years they spend abroad.
Palestinians and settlers enjoy vastly different levels of freedom of movement. Israeli
authorities bar West Bank Palestinians from entering large sections of the West Bank itself
unless they have a difficult-to-obtain, time-limited permit. These sections include East
Jerusalem and nearby villages that Israel annexed in 1967, the “seam zone” between the
separation barrier and the Green Line, settlements, and areas authorities deem “closed
military zones.” 238 The separation barrier, slicing in some places through populated
Palestinian areas, restricts movement and cuts off many Palestinians from their
agricultural lands, while forcing 11,000 Palestinians living in the seam zone, who are
barred from entering Israel, to cross the separation barrier to access their own property
and some basic services. 239 Palestinians also face nearly 600 permanent obstacles to
movement, such as checkpoints and roadblocks, located inside the West Bank rather than

detention for longer periods and have a much wider latitude to keep Palestinians in
civilians, including settlers. 259 Authorities can also deny Palestinians access to counsel for
twice as long as to settlers—up to 96 hours for regular offenses and 60 days for “security
offenses,” as compared to 48 hours and 21 days for settlers. 260
The laws governing children in detention also discriminate between Israelis and West Bank
Palestinians. Israeli civil law protects children against nighttime arrests, provides the right
to have a parent present during interrogations, and limits the amount of time children may
be detained before being able to consult a lawyer and to be presented before a justice. 261
In law and in practice, Palestinian children in the West Bank enjoy far fewer protections—
Israeli forces regularly arrest children during nighttime raids, interrogate them without a
guardian present, and hold those as young as 12 in lengthy pretrial detention. 262 ACRI
found in 2017, based on government data from 2015, that authorities kept 72 percent of
Palestinian children from the West Bank in custody until the end of proceedings, but only
17.9 percent of children in Israel. 263

Israeli authorities have incarcerated hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for what it
deems “security offenses” since 1967, 264 including hundreds at virtually any given time
renewable periods that can extend for multiple years. 265 As of April 2021, according to the
Israeli Prison Services, authorities held 4,323 Palestinians from the West Bank, not
including East Jerusalem, in custody for “security offenses,” including 426 in
administrative detention. 266 Israel jails most Palestinian prisoners from the OPT inside
Israel, even though transferring residents from occupied territory violates international
humanitarian law, and complicates the process of family visits to them. 267 By contrast,
Israeli authorities, as of March 1, 2021, held no Jewish Israelis for “security offenses” and,
over nearly 54 years of occupation, have held not more than a handful of Jewish Israelis in
total in administrative detention. 268

tactics rarely utilized against Jewish detainees. 269 A September 1999 Israeli Supreme

torture against Israeli authorities have been filed with Israel’s Justice Ministry between
prosecutions. 271 The Israeli rights group Public Committee Against Torture (PCATI)
reported in June 2019 that, of the more than 100 complaints of alleged torture it filed
over the last five years at the hands of Israel’s internal security service, Shin Bet, 31
percent involved physical violence, 40 percent painful and prolonged shackling or use of
stress positions, 66 percent sleep deprivation, 61 percent threats, and 27 percent sexual
harassment and humiliation. 272 Security forces also routinely use unnecessary force
against children during arrests, which often take place in the middle of the night, and
physically abuse them in custody. 273
Security forces also frequently raid populated Palestinian areas in the West Bank, even
Area A, where Israeli authorities ostensibly charged the PA with fully managing civil and
security affairs. Israeli forces routinely use excessive force, including live
ammunition, against Palestinian demonstrators, rock-throwers, suspected assailants,
and others in policing situations when lesser means could have been deployed. 274
Between January 19, 2009, and January 31, 2021, Israeli security forces killed 449
Palestinians in the West Bank, according to B’Tselem. 275 Many thousands more have

Settlers, meanwhile, enjoy virtual impunity for criminal acts against Palestinians. Between
2005 and 2019, police closed 91 percent of the complaints tracked by the Israeli human
without indicting anyone. 277 The army not only systematically fails to intervene, but,
B’Tselem found, “they often provide the perpetrators escort and back-up. In some cases,
they even join in on the attack.” 278
Land and Housing
Since 1967 Israeli authorities have confiscated more than two million dunams of
Palestinian land in the West Bank, often to establish settlements and serve the needs of
Jewish Israeli settlers. Israeli authorities have used several different legal instruments to
confiscate land—as detailed in a later chapter of this report—among them designating
land, including land privately owned by Palestinians, as “state land.” 279
Israeli authorities have allocated 674,459 dunams of state land in the West Bank for Israeli
civilian use, primarily settlements, according to figures from the Israeli Civil Administration
obtained by Peace Now in June 2018. 280 This figure comprises 99.76 percent of the total
state land that Israeli authorities have officially allocated for use by third parties. The
remaining 0.24 percent, or about 1,600 dunams, went to Palestinians. Of this tiny fraction,
80 percent constituted “compensation” for lands taken for settlements and alternative
land allocated after the forcible transfer of Palestinian Bedouins from the land on which
they had lived. Authorities allocated the majority of this state land, 400,000 dunams in
total, to the World Zionist Organization (WZO), according to data provided to the groups
ACRI and Bimkom in March 2013. 281 The WZO’s Settlement Division defines its mission as

Israeli authorities have made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building
permits in Area C, the 60 percent of the West Bank under exclusive Israeli control. 283 For
the 20-year period between 2000 and 2019, Israeli authorities approved only 245 building
permits for Palestinians in Area C, less than 4 percent of the number of applications
submitted. They issued 21 permits between 2016 and 2018, less than 1.5 percent of the
applications submitted. 284 Between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 5,817
Palestinian-owned structures, including homes, in the West Bank, mostly for lacking a
permit, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA). 285 B’Tselem documented 1,533 Palestinian homes demolished by authorities in
this period for lacking a permit, leaving 6,492 Palestinians displaced. 286 By contrast,
Israeli authorities offer a range of incentives, including housing benefits, business
subsidies (particularly in agriculture and industrial zones), budgetary perks, and tax
breaks to encourage Jewish Israelis to move to settlements. 287 In doing so, they have
steadily and unlawfully expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank for decades.
According to Peace Now, between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities began construction
on more than 23,696 units in West Bank settlements, excluding East Jerusalem. 288

Resources and Services
Israeli authorities retain primary control over resources and infrastructure and
systematically privilege Jewish Israeli settlers over Palestinians in the provision of roads,
water, electricity, health care, and other services. Even where Palestinians maintain a
degree of autonomy within their enclaves, they rely on infrastructure projects, including
roads, electricity towers, and water and sewage pipes that require Israeli-issued permits or
that cross through Israeli-controlled Area C.
Israeli authorities built the main network of roads in the West Bank, often at considerable
expense and on land expropriated from Palestinians, to bypass Palestinian populated
areas and connect settlements to the Israeli road network, to other settlements, and to
major metropolitan areas inside Israel. 290 According to B’Tselem, there are more than 40
kilometers of West Bank roads that authorities prohibit Palestinians from traveling on and
another 19 kilometers of West Bank roads, not including in Hebron, on which Palestinian
travel is restricted. 291 Israeli forces in Hebron prohibit Palestinians from walking on large
sections of what used to be the central thoroughfare of the city as part of a policy of
making those areas “sterile” of Palestinians, as per the parlance of the Israeli army. 292

To facilitate Palestinian travel between enclaves without using the bypass roads favored
by settlers, Israeli authorities established a rudimentary secondary road network for
alongside and underneath the “bypass roads” used by Israelis. 293 With gates at the
entrances and exits to Palestinian enclaves, authorities can, at will, shut down the network
and cut off traffic between different parts of the West Bank, creating what OCHA calls “an
adaptable system of control.” 294
Israeli authorities, for example, built in the 1980s a significant segment of Road 443 in the
West Bank, in part on expropriated Palestinian land, to offer an alternative route for
Israelis to commute between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. 295 Some landowners challenged the
confiscation, but the Supreme Court dismissed their petition, accepting the government’s
position that it built the road, which also historically connected Ramallah to villages to its
west, partly to serve the local Palestinian population. 296 In 2002, following attacks by
Palestinians on Israeli vehicles during the second Intifada, Israeli authorities banned
Palestinian vehicles from using the road for any purpose, with the then local Israeli army
commander declaring, “I made Route 443 an Israelis-only road.” 297 In 2007 and 2008, they
built “fabric of life” roads to make it easier for Palestinians to access Ramallah without
using Road 443. After years of litigation by Israeli rights groups, the Israeli army in 2010
reopened the road to Palestinian traffic.
However, the army kept in place checkpoints at each of the junctions that provide access
to Palestinian villages. They also maintained a checkpoint near Ofer prison, where soldiers

So while Palestinian drivers from the West Bank can formally use a large

section of Road 443, the checkpoints, by blocking access to Ramallah, render the road
useless for most Palestinians. Palestinians from the villages near Road 443 instead rely on
the “fabric of life” roads on which it takes them much longer to reach Ramallah or any
destination beyond the several other small villages located alongside the road.
Israeli authorities also maintain primary control over water resources in the West Bank and
allocate water in a discriminatory fashion to Palestinians. Two of Israel’s three major water
resources run largely through the West Bank: the Jordan River and the Mountain Aquifer,
which consists of three basins. The third, the Coastal Aquifer, runs along the coast of Israel
and Gaza. 299 Military orders established in the first 18 months of the occupation in 1967
and 1968 granted the army full authority over water-related issues in the West Bank, 300
declared water resources state property, 301 and barred Palestinians from establishing or
using water installations without a permit. 302 In 1982, Israeli authorities transferred
ownership of water resources and supply from the Civil Administration to the national
Israeli water company, Mekorot, while continuing to vest the Civil Administration with
regulatory control. 303
Israel has used its control over parts of the Mountain Aquifer in the West Bank to serve its
own citizens and settlers, in contravention of international humanitarian law which
prohibits occupiers from exploiting natural resources for its own economic benefit. While

80 percent of the Mountain Aquifer’s water recharge area lies beneath the West Bank, 304
Israel directly extracts about 90 percent of the water that is withdrawn from the aquifer
monopolizing this shared resource, Israeli authorities sharply restrict the ability of
Palestinians to directly exploit their own natural resources and render them dependent on
Israel for their water supply. For decades, authorities have denied Palestinians permits to
drill new wells, in particular in the most productive Western Aquifer basins, or to
rehabilitate existing ones. While the Oslo Accords of 1995 included provisions that
promised to increase Palestinian access to water, 306 Palestinian extraction levels have
largely remained at pre-Oslo levels while the population has increased. 307
Despite the establishment of a “Joint Water Commission” (JWC) as part of the Oslo
Accords, the World Bank in 2009 noted that Israel has retained “virtually all the power,”
including veto power, over the West Bank’s water resources. 308 While approving virtually
all requests for Israeli-proposed projects to serve settlers, the JWC has rejected many
Palestinian-initiated projects, including all requests to drill in the Western Aquifer
Basin. 309 Israelis are often permitted to drill deeper into the Aquifer, regularly develop
internal settlement water networks without seeking JWC approval, 310 and can extract water
without limit when it flows downstream into Israel without need for JWC approval, while

Palestinians face strict extraction quotas. 311 The JWC did not meet between 2010 and 2016;
during this period, according to government data received by ACRI, Israeli authorities

In addition, Israeli authorities have almost entirely deprived Palestinians access to water
from the Jordan River, the only major surface water resource in the West Bank, by diverting
its flow upstream of the West Bank. 313
Israeli policies in Area C further restrict Palestinian water access. The separation barrier,
for example, separates Palestinians from more than 20 wells in the “seam zone,” between
the barrier and the Green Line, limiting their ability to use these water sources, as well as
cutting them off from about 70 percent of the Western Aquifer Basin. 314 Authorities have
also denied permits for Palestinians to build water pipelines and demolished water
infrastructure built without permits. 315 Between 2009 and July 2019, Israeli authorities
demolished or seized 547 structures providing water and related sanitation services,
including cisterns, water pipes, and mobile latrines, according to OCHA. 316
These restrictions have made Palestinians dependent on purchasing water, in large part
extracted from under their land, from Mekorot. A 2013 UN Fact-Finding report found that
Mekorot supplies “almost half the water consumed by Palestinian communities” in the
West Bank. 317 Palestinians in many cases pay more for water than Israelis, at times
deriving from mark-ups in the price of the water sold to them, and in particular more than

Israel’s discriminatory water policies in the West Bank enable settlers to enjoy bountiful
water, while some Palestinian communities lack sufficient water to provide for their basic
needs. In 2017, Amnesty International documented how Israel’s drilling in the Jordan
Valley and prevention of local Palestinians from accessing some of their traditional water
sources had reduced the supply of water available to them. These restrictions, among
other factors, led some farmers to switch to crops that “are less water-intensive and also
less profitable” or even to abandon growing crops themselves, with some going to work in
nearby settlement farms with more plentiful water supply. 320 The World Bank in 2009
found that Israelis as a whole consume four times more water than Palestinians in the
West Bank. 321 Estimates indicate that settlers in the West Bank on average use at least
four times per capita the amount used by Palestinians living in the same territory. 322

Case Study: Salfit Governorate

The following case study details how Israeli authorities use oppressive means for the
purpose of establishing domination over the Palestinian governorate of Salfit in the West
Bank, abusing the rights of its residents to benefit Jewish Israeli settlers living nearby.
Salfit is one of eleven Palestinian governorates in the West Bank. It has a population of
81,162 and encompasses a cluster of hilltops and valleys in the northwest West Bank. 323
Salfit’s fertile lands, location atop the West Bank basin with the greatest water reserves,
high elevation, and proximity to Tel Aviv, a 30-minute drive away, has made the

governorate a strategic target for settlement activity. 324 Israeli authorities have seized
significant parts of the land, building a cluster of settlements centered around the urban
the center of the governorate, dividing Salfit’s Palestinians into three disconnected
pockets of villages, and separating the town of Salfit, the governorate’s administrative and
commercial center, from other villages to the north. 325 Residents of these communities
face regular land confiscations, restricted access to agricultural land, movement
restrictions, settler violence, and sewage run-offs from the nearby settlements.
The cluster of settlements grew out of a 1977 Israeli government plan formulated by Ariel
Sharon, then agriculture minister and chairperson of the Ministerial Committee for
Settlement Affairs, to fortify Israeli control in the western West Bank. As former Israeli
official and analyst Shaul Arieli put it, the plan, in particular, sought to, “create a Jewish
barrier” between Palestinian population centers and “control key hilltops overlooking the
coastal plain [inside Israel].” 326
A 1997 plan by the WZO’s Settlement Division highlights the “attractiveness” of this area,
which it refers to as “western Samaria,” “as a residential area for people who are
employed in the center of the country.” 327 Noting its “close proximity to centers of
employment, services, and the existing culture of the coastal plain,” it describes how it
offers a “valve” to “release the urban pressures of the coastal plain.” 328
The plan also describes the strategic value of the road network it calls the “Trans-Samaria
corridor.” The corridor consists primarily of Highway 5, which starts in northern Tel Aviv
and runs east across the Green Line to Ariel, where it meets Road 505, which continues

which runs north-south through the Jordan Valley. The plan justifies the need for ‘lateral
cause the coastal plain to be cut off from the Jordan Valley and the fragmenting of Israeli
settlement zones in Judea and Samaria.” 329 While Israeli settlers commute daily from Ariel
to inside Israel without facing any major checkpoints, authorities have rendered a fourkilometer segment of the highway off-limits to Palestinian vehicles, according
to B’Tselem. 330
The cluster of settlements also lies above the most productive section of the Mountain
Aquifer, the Western Aquifer Basin. 331 Israeli authorities though have effectively blocked
Palestinians in Salfit from extracting water from the Aquifer, creating a water deficit in the
governorate. With few other options, the Salfit governate purchases the vast majority of its
water from Mekorot. 332
Twenty-four largely contiguous Israeli settlements and settlement zones, more than the
number of Palestinian communities there, sprawl across the hilltops of the governorate. 333
Ariel, one of the more populous settlements in the West Bank with a population of
20,500, 334 lies at the eastern edge of the cluster of settlements. The settlement,

Israeli authorities have built three fences around Ariel since its establishment, in each
case expanding the areas enclosed: the first in the 1980s, a second in 1993, and most
recently the separation barrier in 2004. Israel confiscated some private land to build the
barriers and, in other cases, effectively fenced off thousands more dunams from their
Palestinian owners, who are now subject to a complex set of administrative restrictions on
accessing their land. In 2004, the separation barrier around Ariel separated Palestinians in
Salfit from 9,000 dunams (900 hectares) of their land – 3,500 dunams (350 hectares)
belong to more than 200 farmers from Salfit, with the remainder belonging to residents
from the nearby villages of Haris, Kifl Haris, Iskaka, Marda, and Qira. 339
Human Rights Watch in 2014 and 2015 interviewed fourteen farmers from Salfit and the
village of Marda, just north of Ariel, who own land that Israeli authorities either confiscated
or restricted their access to in order to build settlements or fences or as a result of their
construction. The farmers who maintained ownership of their land can access it only with
prior permission of the Israeli army, which often only permits them to do so two or three
times a year for a limited number of days. In each case, the farmers described how Israeli
restrictions, including how often they could cultivate the land and what equipment they
could use, drastically reduced the productivity of their harvest and even limited what crops
they could grow. Two farmers stopped cultivating all or part of their land altogether,
despite their fears that Israel may designate it as state land on the basis that Palestinians
have not continuously cultivated it.” 340

A farmer from the village of Marda told Human Rights Watch in 2015 that his father owned
more than 1,000 dunams, but he lost almost all of it over the years to Ariel. “They took it
little by little,” he said. “In the beginning [in 1978 and 1979], they took 100 dunams and
put caravans there. In the 1980s, they put a barbed wire fence around more land; they
didn’t confiscate the land but declared it a closed military zone. Then they started building
on it. Each time they would move the fence [to encompass more land], they would say it’s
for security reasons.” The farmer said he filed a complaint each time to an Israeli military
court, producing all the required evidence of ownership, yet he lost each of the cases. At
the time, he said, only 60 dunams remained, 30 of which are behind the separation barrier
built in 2004, and which the Israeli army only allows him access to twice a year. 341
Northwest of the cluster of settlements around Ariel, the Palestinian village of Mas-ha has
faced regular land confiscations since the 1970s. In 1978, the Israeli army seized land in
Mas-ha for “military purposes.” 342 In subsequent years, they declared lands around Masha “state land” and allocated it to establish the settlement of Elkana in large part on

agricultural lands belonging to Mas-ha residents. 343 In 2002, authorities expropriated
more land to build the separation barrier, cutting residents from some of their land. In
400-500 dunams of land about two kilometers from their house, but now located beyond
the barrier and inside Elkana. A family member said that authorities confiscated some of
their land and that they now need permits to access the remainder of it. The permits only
allow them to enter through a designated gate that only opens twice a day, for 15-30
minutes each time. Reaching their land via the gate involves a two hour and 20 kilometer
detour. 344
Settlements wreak havoc on the daily life of residents in other ways. Two landowners from
Bruqin, a village in an isolated pocket south of the cluster of settlements, told Human
Rights Watch that soldiers have for the past 20 years blocked residents from accessing 100
dunams of land they own next to the settlement of Bruchin, southwest of Ariel. 345 Settlers
have also placed mobile caravans on the land. One of the landowners, 60-year-old farmer
Jamal Salameh, said he has since 2017 regularly sought, in vain, the Civil Administration’s
assistance to access this plot of land, where he has a well and used to grow wheat
and barley. 346
Salameh owns another small plot of land on the other side of Bruchin that he said settlers
have attacked on multiple occasions, including in 2011 when they torched hundreds of
olive trees that he planted in 1986, and at least four times in March and April 2020 amid
the significant movement restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. “The army
has handed the reins to the settlers. I haven’t seen the army in this area for the past two
years,” he said, noting that other landowners from Bruqin have stopped even trying to
access their land in this area due to the frequent settler attacks. He also recounted a 2016

land, which includes the archaeological site of Deir Samaan, that the settlements of
Leshem and Alei Zahav gradually came to surround on three sides. In 2011, Israeli
authorities closed the agricultural road that led to his plot of land without notice or
explanation, he said. He told Human Rights Watch that the army permitted him to build
another one at his own expense, but a year after he had done so at significant expense,
they sealed off the new road with a gate. 348 This forces him to park his car on the main
road and walk uphill 700 meters to reach his plot of land. Settlers also regularly trespass
onto his land to swim in natural pools located there, during which time he said his family
must “stay away” to avoid confrontation. In one incident in 2019, he said settlers uprooted
13 of their fig and olive trees.
Ad-Dik owns a second plot of land in the village that before 2010 took him five minutes by
car to reach. In 2010, however, authorities began construction of the settlement of Leshem
under the guise of expanding the nearby settlement of Alei Zahav, 349 which blocked the
road to his land. Now he said reaching his land involves driving through two nearby
villages and walking through a valley where sewage from nearby settlements flow, a
journey that takes more than an hour. Due to the difficulty and length of the journey, he
said his 70-year-old mother has not visited the property in seven years and he himself only
goes once or twice a year. He added that, without being able to transport equipment, he
has not been able to plant anything new there. The sewage, he said, leaves his property

Across the governorate, raw sewage and untreated industrial chemical waste from
settlements and industrial zones flows into residential areas and around water sources,
B’Tselem documented how Ariel’s wastewater had since the mid-1990s flowed south
towards the city of Salfit where it merged with Salfit’s sewage and flows westward into
Bruqin and Kufr ad-Dik. 352 The group documented how Ariel’s wastewater plant ceased
functioning altogether in 2008, after more than a decade of unheeded warnings by Israeli
environmental authorities about the plant’s condition. 353 It has remained dysfunctional
since; 354 a 2016 Israeli government publication noted that its efficiency is “low” with
“effluent channeled into irrigation and the Shilo river.” 355 Salfit has sought for more than
two decades to build a wastewater treatment plant, even securing funding for the project,
but Israeli authorities continually frustrated their efforts, once claiming the location would
be too close to Ariel, 356 and another time conditioning approval on agreeing to treat Ariel’s
wastewater, 357 a condition Palestinians often refuse since it would imply effective
recognition of settlements. In 2019, though, the Salfit municipality obtained approval to

A report published by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) and the Palestinian Hydrology Group in 2011 said that the Barkan Industrial Area
settlement, near Ariel, “is notorious for flushing its leftover chemical waste onto Salfit
villages.”

359

The report further states that “this chemical waste is thought to include

petrochemicals, metals and plastic” and notes that “heavy toxic metals are linked to an
endless list of conditions, from diarrhoea to diabetes, hyperkeratosis, organ failure and
cancer.” 360 During the rainy season, according to B’Tselem, the sewage flows from Ariel
downstream into springs and valleys, overflowing Salfit’s central pumping station. 361 A
Bruqin municipality employee, Murad Samara, told Human Rights Watch that in al-Matwi
valley, between Salfit and Bruqin, sewage from Ariel and Salfit flows through a valley
where at least 50 families live. 362 People in the community worried that exposure to
sewage and chemical waste was making people sick. May Barakat, a mother of four who
lives in the valley, told Human Rights Watch that “the smell in the valley is deadly” and
that her three-year-old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago. She said that
she stopped allowing her children to play outside after one of them fell into the sewage
several years prior. 363
Another cluster of settlements runs through northern Salfit and juts deep into the
neighboring governorate of Qalqilya. The separation barrier entirely encircles the city of
Qalqilya, home to more than 55,000 people, 364 with only one access road in and out of the
city, in order to, according to B’Tselem “create contiguity between Israel” and the

East Jerusalem
After seizing the West Bank in 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed 72 square kilometers,
including the eastern part of Jerusalem and land that belonged to 28 surrounding West
Bank villages, to the Jerusalem municipality. Human Rights Watch is not aware of any
other country, with the recent exception of the United States under President Donald
Trump, that recognizes Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem, which remains occupied
territory under international law. 367
As of September 2020, the Jerusalem municipality includes, according to Israel’s Central
Bureau of Statistics, 371,800 Palestinians and 563,200 Jewish Israelis. 368 The Jewish
Israeli population includes more than 220,000 settlers living in occupied East
Jerusalem. 369 In the city, Israel effectively maintains one set of rules for Jewish Israelis and
another for Palestinians on virtually all aspects of everyday life.
Legal Status
Israeli authorities designate Palestinians from East Jerusalem as “permanent residents,”
the same status afforded to a foreigner who moves to Israel. 370 This precarious status
derives from their physical presence in Jerusalem; the Interior Ministry has withdrawn it

A path to citizenship exists for Palestinian Jerusalemite residents, but the vast majority
have chosen not to pursue it, as it recognizes Israel, the occupying power, as the
legitimate sovereign. Moreover, the vast majority of those who applied did not receive
citizenship. 372 As permanent residents, Palestinian Jerusalemites who are not citizens can
vote in municipal elections, but not in national Israeli elections. 373
In contrast, Jewish Israelis from Jerusalem, including settlers in East Jerusalem, are Israeli
citizens and do not have to prove that they maintain connections to the city in order to
safeguard their legal status. Israeli authorities have not revoked the legal status of a single
Jewish Israeli for failing to prove a “center of life” in Jerusalem. Jewish Israelis living in all
parts of Jerusalem also vote in both municipal and national elections.

While Palestinians and Jewish Jerusalemites are subject to the same criminal law,
discrimination underlies policing in the city. Across Jerusalem, 77 percent of children
Jerusalem’s population. 374 B’Tselem observed that police violence “is part of Israel’s
policy…to ensure Jewish supremacy in the city.” 375 For example, Israeli authorities
arrested, according to B’Tselem, more than 850 Palestinians, mostly children, many of
whom were beaten, from the neighborhood of Issawiya in East Jerusalem between April
2019 and April 2020. 376 B’Tselem described these arrests in Issawiya as part of “an
ongoing campaign of abuse and collective punishment against its residents,” 377
documenting how police forces regularly entered the neighborhood to “initiate ‘friction’…
block the narrow streets, fire stun grenades, tear gas and sponge rounds and arrest and
beat residents.” 378 The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which has reported on near-daily raids,
patrols, checkpoints, and ambushes in Issawiya, and described the policy as one of
“collective punishment,” 379 found that only a “tiny fraction” of those arrested have been
charged with stone-throwing or other offenses. 380
In addition, the separation barrier cuts through East Jerusalem, separating Palestinian
communities in at least three ways. First, it places tens of thousands of Palestinian
Jerusalemites living in areas such as Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp on the West
Bank side of the barrier, separating them from the rest of East Jerusalem. 381 Second, the

barrier traps some West Bank Palestinians on the Jerusalem side, for example in Nabi
Samuel. West Bank Palestinian residents of these areas are effectively forbidden from
and must cross a checkpoint to attend school or work or go to the grocery store or
hospital. 382 Third, the barrier creates various fully encircled enclaves in the West Bank, for
example in Bir Nabala, that are connected to other Palestinian communities only by “fabric
of life” roads. 383
Land and Housing
Since 1967 Israeli authorities have expropriated from Palestinians nearly one-third of the
land in East Jerusalem, comprising at least 23,378 dunams, largely for settlements. 384 As
with the rest of the West Bank, Israeli authorities have since 1967 frozen the land
registration process for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, while registering land in East
Jerusalem settlements throughout the entire period. 385 The freeze puts the land of
Palestinians who had not registered it by 1967 at risk of confiscation and also makes it
difficult for them to obtain building permits. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim estimated in a
2015 report that half the land in East Jerusalem is not registered. 386
Beyond formal state confiscation, discriminatory laws and policies enable settler and
settler organizations to take possession of Palestinian homes, evict the Palestinian
landowners, and transfer their property to Jewish owners in East Jerusalem
neighborhoods. 387 They have done so based on a 1970 law that requires authorities to
return to Jewish owners or their heirs property they owned in East Jerusalem prior to 1948

and that was held by Jordanian authorities between 1948 and 1967. 388 By contrast,
authorities have largely allowed the takeover of the land and homes of Palestinians in
Palestinians who were expelled or fled as a result of the onset of the Israeli occupation in
1967, by declaring it as “absentee property.” 389
The Ateret Cohanim settler organization, for example, has filed dozens of eviction lawsuits
against around 100 Palestinian families living in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan in East
Jerusalem, claiming that their homes belonged to a Jewish property trust that had housed
Yemeni Jews in the late 19th century. 390 Ateret Cohanim aims to create a Jewish
neighborhood in the heart of Silwan, putting 700 Palestinians at risk of eviction. 391
Jerusalem magistrate courts ruled in favor of Ateret Cohanim in several of these suits in
2020, ordering the eviction of families who had lived there for decades. 392 In June 2020, a
Jerusalem court ruled in favor of the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in an eviction proceeding

That, combined with the Law and Administration Procedures Act passed in 1970 by the Knesset, have empowered the
Custodian of Absentee Property to determine whether East Jerusalem properties qualified as “absentee properties.” The

Israeli authorities have made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building
permits in East Jerusalem, in particular outside built-up neighborhoods that make up less
than 15 percent of East Jerusalem and 8.5 percent of the Jerusalem municipality. 395
According to Peace Now, “while the government has initiated planning, appropriation of land
for construction, tenders for the construction of more than 55,000 housing units for Israelis
in East Jerusalem since 1967, the Palestinians have seen government-initiated construction
of only 600 housing units (in the 1970s).” 396 As a result, most Palestinian construction in
East Jerusalem is based on private rather than state initiatives. Municipal planners between
1991 and 2018 approved only 9,536 building permits for Palestinians, while approving
48,201 in Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem, including 21,834 in settlements. 397

Resources and Services
Israeli authorities sharply discriminate in the provision of resources and services between
Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem. While most Palestinian neighborhoods have
poor infrastructure and inadequate health, recreation, and educational services and
facilities, most predominantly Jewish neighborhoods have well-paved roads, numerous
parks and playgrounds, adequate refuse collection, and sufficient places for children in
schools. 401 In January 2016, the Jerusalem district court ordered the municipality to build
more playgrounds in the Palestinian neighborhoods of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, after
residents of those neighborhoods alleged that they only had two playgrounds to serve a
combined population of 60,000, while nearby Jewish neighborhoods had a playground for
every 1,000 residents. 402
The Jerusalem municipality in 2013 allocated only 10.1 percent of its municipal budget for
projects and spending in Palestinian neighborhoods, according to the Israeli rights group Ir
Amim, despite Palestinians making up about 37 percent of the city’s population at the time
and paying taxes. 403 Ir Amim estimated in 2020 that Palestinians in East Jerusalem faced a
shortage of 3,794 classrooms; while some shortages also existed in Jewish communities, in

The discriminatory allocation of resources contributes to the starkly different realities
faced by Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem. Seventy-two percent of Palestinian
families live below the poverty line, as compared to 26 percent of Jewish families. 406
Despite this, the Israeli government maintains six welfare offices, or offices that provide
information to residents looking to receive government aid or other services, in Palestinian
neighborhoods, but 19 in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods. 407 Thirty-two percent of
Palestinian students in East Jerusalem do not complete 12 years of education, as
compared to 1.5 percent of Jewish students in Jerusalem. 408
Case Study: Kufr Aqab

The following case study details how Israeli authorities have discriminated against
Palestinians living in Kufr Aqab on the outskirts of East Jerusalem mainly through building
the separation barrier between it and the rest of the city in 2002 and then largely
neglecting the needs of residents. The situation in Kufr Aqab differs from the more
common policies and practices that institutionally discriminate against Palestinians of
Jerusalem but represents a different method by which an oppressively discriminatory
system results in rights abuses for Palestinians living in East Jerusalem.
The separation barrier cuts off Kufr Aqab, a Palestinian town that largely falls at the
northernmost edge of the boundaries of the Israeli-demarcated Jerusalem municipality,

After the 1967 war, Israel annexed most of Kufr Aqab, including the then Jerusalem airport
and the neighborhoods of Samiramis and Zghayyar that have historically been a part of
into the Jerusalem municipality, apparently to bring the airport under its control. 410
Annexation, though, split the town into two parts, with about 40 percent remaining outside
the territory that Israel incorporated and today falling within Area C of the West Bank,
where Israel maintains full civil and security control. 411 Kufr Aqab’s municipal council
formally serves the part of the town outside Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries, but, in
practice, also engages residents in the Jerusalem part. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian
authorities maintain precise population figures for Kufr Aqab; estimates range between
70,000 and 100,000, 412 while Kufr Aqab’s municipal council maintains that the actual
figure is around 120,000. 413
In the 1980s, Israeli authorities confiscated 1,415 dunams from Kufr Aqab as state land and
allocated it to establish the settlement of Kochav Ya’akov, according to B’Tselem. 414 An
official from the municipal council estimates that Kufr Aqab lost in total about a third of its

thereby their challenge to the state land designation. 417 In February 2020, Israel’s Housing
Ministry advanced a plan to build a settlement in the area where the Jerusalem airport
once stood. 418
In 2002, Israeli authorities, citing security reasons, built in the Jerusalem area a segment
of the separation barrier more than 200 kilometers long. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim
noted that its route “adds to Jerusalem the Jewish population that lives in the settlement
blocs outside of the city’s municipal area[,] in addition to a very large area of land outside
them,” while it “subtracts the Palestinian population that lives in those areas from
Jerusalem.” 419 Running between Kufr Aqab and the strip where the airport once was, in
part on Kufr Aqab’s land, the barrier separates residents from Jerusalem and over 500
dunams of the town’s own agricultural lands, according to Kufr Aqab municipal council
officials. 420 The barrier runs south to the Qalandiya checkpoint, the main crossing between
Ramallah and Jerusalem, which Kufr Aqab residents, the majority of whom hold Jerusalem

Beyond physically separating Palestinians from one another, the building of the barrier
coincided with the Israeli government’s effective abandonment of governance and law
Aqab, 422 and, as acknowledged in a 2008 State Comptroller report, maintain “no police
operations to enforce or maintain order” there. 423 Munir Zghayyar, chair of the Kufr Aqab
Residents Committee, told Human Rights Watch that he is not aware of a single incident of
Israeli police entering Kufr Aqab since 2001 and that, even when residents cross the
checkpoint and go in-person to a police station, authorities often do not intervene. 424 The
army, charged since 2006 with responsibility for security in Kufr Aqab, at times enters Kufr
Aqab to carry out security operations and arrests, even though it defines the area as falling
within Israel’s sovereign territory and thus not under military rule. 425
With the PA barred under the Oslo Accords from operating in Kufr Aqab, these policies create
what OCHA has called “a security vacuum manifested in an increase in lawlessness, crime
and drug trafficking,” 426 and offer fertile ground for fugitives from the PA police. 427 Three
Kufr Aqab residents told Human Rights Watch that they regularly hear gunfire, so much so
that one resident’s family grew “afraid to go on the balcony.” 428 Another said, “I am always
afraid—anything can happen and who am I supposed to turn to when it does?” 429 In the
absence of law enforcement, Zghayyar, the Residents Committee chair, said some of the
larger families living there have taken it upon themselves to adjudicate disputes. 430

Israeli authorities have also since the building of the barrier effectively stopped regulating
construction. Municipal authorities approved a plan for Kufr Aqab in 2005, but Ir Amim
municipal council both told Human Rights Watch that authorities have not issued a
building permit for the area since 2001. 432 Moien Odeh, a lawyer who has brought cases
on behalf of Kufr Aqab and a former resident, said that residents used to have to get a
difficult-to-obtain permit to “build anything,” but, following the outbreak of the second

Intifada and the building of the barrier, authorities suggested off-hand to some contractors
and residents that they did not need a permit and residents eventually stopped
applying. 433 Ir Amim quoted the director of the municipality’s building inspection division
in a June 2015 report as acknowledging that the municipality is not monitoring or enforcing
construction there. 434 Ir Amim also determined that the division had not entered Kufr Aqab
in a decade. 435
The lack of regulation in Kufr Aqab stands in sharp contrast to the government’s policy of
sharply restricting building in other Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and
carrying out thousands of home demolitions since 1967. 436 Amid the housing crunch and
difficulty of building in Palestinian neighborhoods inside the separation barrier, many
Palestinian Jerusalemites have moved to Kufr Aqab, where, according to Zghayyar,
property costs one-third less. 437

Kufr Aqab has since the building of the barrier attracted Jerusalemites married to
Palestinians from other parts of the West Bank, who under Israel’s Citizenship and Entry into
Jerusalem resident. 438 Since Kufr Aqab falls within the Jerusalem municipality, Jerusalemites
living there can claim that they live in the city and not lose their residency on that basis.
Scores of Palestinians have since 1967 moved to other parts of the West Bank. 439 At the
same time, its location beyond the barrier and lack of law enforcement means that West
Bank residents can live there without crossing an Israeli checkpoint.
Because of Israel’s discriminatory system, Palestinian “mixed” couples from Jerusalem
and the West Bank can with few exceptions live together legally on a long-term, secure
basis only in neighborhoods like Kufr Aqab. By contrast, Jewish “mixed” couples, including
Jerusalemites married to West Bank settlers, can freely live anywhere in Israel, East
Jerusalem, and the West Bank settlements.
A Palestinian woman said she lived for four years in a Jerusalem neighborhood inside the
separation barrier apart from her husband, who is from Hebron and has been unable to get
permits to enter Jerusalem. During this time, she had to raise their three children alone, in
order to maintain a “center of life” in the city and thereby her residency. 440 When she
learned that she could both do that and live with her husband in Kufr Aqab, she said they
moved there in 2006 and they have remained since. Her daughter, though, continued to
attend school across the barrier, crossing the Qalandiya checkpoint daily. She said her
family did not wish to remain in Kufr Aqab, citing the difficulty of life there, but had no
other options.
High demand and lack of regulation in Kufr Aqab have driven a “rapid and informal
increase in residential construction, particularly high-rise buildings.” 441 Built without
properly vetted plans or oversight, and often within meters of each other, many buildings
rise 10-12 stories high, lack adequate infrastructure for “water, drainage, sewage,

adds that this sort of construction creates a reality where no one knows the boundaries
built without a permit, according to a municipal council employee involved in
inspections, 444 have been constructed on land reaching up the barrier, taking up virtually
all the area available for public spaces, and contributing to population density. 445 An
official from the municipal council observed that the only place left to build is “towards
the sky.” 446
Although Jerusalemites living in Kufr Aqab pay the same municipal taxes as those living
in other Jerusalem neighborhoods, “public infrastructure, resources and services are
significantly degraded or lacking entirely.” 447 In February 2015, the municipality’s deputy
legal advisor acknowledged to Ir Amim that “the Municipality encounters difficulties”
servicing Kufr Aqab. 448 Kufr Aqab has no government buildings beyond an Interior
Ministry office at the Qalandiya checkpoint, and no emergency health or fire, banking, or
welfare services. 449 As a result, residents generally have to cross Qalandiya checkpoint,
where waits often take an hour or more to access most municipal services. According to
Zghayyar, the Residents Committee Chair, about 3,800 children also cross the
checkpoint on schooldays to attend class on the other side of the wall, given the
relatively few schools built inside Kufr Aqab. 450 Israel’s national emergency service,
Magen David Adom, generally does not service areas beyond the barrier like Kufr

oversee communities within the Jerusalem municipality but beyond the separation barrier,
mainly Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp, in addition to several smaller
communities. 453 UN OCHA estimated in 2016 that about 160,000 Palestinians live in these
areas. 454 According to Ir Amim, these areas receive only a fraction of the budget allocated
to other Jerusalem neighborhoods. 455 The group said that the JEA has “effectively served to
distance residents from the Municipality,” which often refers residents to the JEA. The JEA,
in turn, often informs them that they do not have the funding to implement necessary
projects. 456 The former head of the JEA acknowledged to Ir Amim the government’s
“neglect,” as he put it, of these areas and has spoken of the “lawlessness” there, noting
that “there is no government presence in [Kufr Aqab] for the purposes of public order.” 457
Ir Amim noted one exception to the neglect of the area: private investigators hired by the
government to verify that residents actually live there for the purposes of probing their
residency status. 458
Even when the municipality provides services, it largely fails to meet the needs of
residents. The municipality, for example, contracts the task of garbage collection to a
private company but based on an underestimate of the number of residents the company

is to serve. 459 A lawsuit filed by Kufr Aqab residents against the municipality alleged that,
in 2012, Jerusalem spent about 328 million NIS on garbage collection, but only around 2
the city’s boundaries housing a percentage of the city’s population likely at least six times
higher. 460 The municipality increased the budget following the suit, 461 but Odeh, the
lawyer who filed it, said that the collection schedule still does not meet the needs of
residents, who often resort to burning their trash. 462
Ir Amim further estimated in 2015 that 10 out of 25 kilometers of roads in Kufr Aqab are
unpaved, eight are in “dilapidated condition,” and only four are paved and “in reasonable
condition.” Even paved ones, they noted, “lack sidewalks, signage, and pedestrian
crossings,” and the “only traffic light in Kufr Aqab is permanently broken.” 463 Documents
from the municipality cited by Odeh in a petition he filed show that, in 2015, less than 0.02
percent of the municipal budget for roads went to Kufr Aqab and other communities
outside the barrier. 464 Some roads have been renovated since 2015, but the overall
condition of roads remains poor. 465
The poor condition of the roads compounds the already heavy traffic in Kufr Aqab, which is
bisected by the main road connecting Ramallah with the south West Bank, including cities
of Bethlehem, Hebron, and Jerusalem, via the Qalandiya checkpoint. According to a
statement by Israeli authorities quoted by Reuters in April 2017, about 26,000 people
cross the Qalandiya checkpoint daily. 466 Due to consistently heavy traffic, it can take up to

national water company, supplies water to most neighborhoods in Jerusalem, including
settlements, the Palestinian-run Jerusalem Water Undertaking, which operates in
Ramallah and nearby areas, services Kufr Aqab, as it did before 1967, and struggles to
meet the demands of residents. 469
Jerusalem’s mayor, Moshe Lion, visited Kufr Aqab, reportedly for the first time, in
February 2021 and said the municipality will “increase its activity and take confidencebuilding steps.”

Lawmakers in 2017 introduced legislation at the Knesset that would separate communities
beyond the separation barrier from the Jerusalem municipality and establish a separate
local authority to govern them. 471 The legislation has not advanced, but residents
expressed concern that the law represents the government’s long-term designs for these
areas. Authorities have long pursued a policy to box in, separate, and exert pressure on
Palestinian Jerusalemites to live beyond the barrier. The draft law threatens to take things
one step further, opening the door to removing residents of Kufr Aqab and other areas
beyond the barrier from Jerusalem’s demographic calculus altogether to preserve a Jewish
majority there.

Gaza Strip
Israeli authorities have exerted primary control over the Gaza Strip since occupying it in
1995 Oslo Accords. 472 Israel’s withdrawal of its ground troops and settler population in
2005 reduced its day-to-day control and allowed Palestinian authorities to exercise more
autonomy within Gaza than they had before. In 2007, Hamas authorities seized power from
the Fatah-led PA in Gaza.
Israeli authorities, however, have remained in critical ways the supreme power,
dominating the coastal strip through other means. 473 Israel controls Gaza’s territorial
waters and airspace and has blocked the building of an airport and seaport, significantly
complicating efforts to travel abroad. 474 Israel also controls the movement of people and
goods into and out of Gaza, except for at Gaza’s border with Egypt, which the Egyptian
government also significantly restricts. Israel controls all transit between Gaza and the
West Bank and maintains a “policy of separation” between the two parts of the OPT. 475 It
controls the Palestinian population registry, which determines eligibility for establishing
legal residency and obtaining an ID card. 476 It sets the rates for the customs and valueadded taxes that it collects on behalf of the PA on goods entering the common market. 477
It enforces a so-called “no-go” zone inside Gaza, near Israeli territory. 478 It controls the
infrastructure upon which Gaza relies, including electricity lines, the underwater cable that
phone calls are placed on, the network that provides internet, and the frequencies
assigned to Palestinian cell phone companies. 479

In light of these controls that Israel exercises over the lives and welfare of Palestinians in
Gaza, Israel remains bound to provide them with the rights and protections afforded to
them by the law of occupation, as the ICRC and UN have both determined. 480 Israeli
authorities have consistently failed to meet their obligations as an occupying power.

480 Both the ICRC and the UN continue to refer to Gaza as occupied territory. Email from Yves Sorokobi, Office of the UN

Secretary General Spokesperson, to Gisha, February 7, 2007, on file with Human Rights Watch. “The UN welcomed the Israeli
disengagement from Gaza in August 2005. However, there has been no change in our characterization of the Gaza Strip as

The Egyptian government often imposes restrictions along its border with Gaza, which
exacerbate the impact of Israel’s policies on residents of Gaza, but Egypt’s obligations
to allow to enter its territory. 481
Given international consensus around and Israeli recognition of Gaza and the West Bank
comprising a single territorial unit, the OPT, Human Rights Watch assesses dynamics in
Gaza as part of the OPT, despite Israel’s “separation policy.” Viewed in that light, the
severe repression of Palestinians in Gaza stands in marked contrast to the treatment of
Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israeli authorities deny Palestinians in
the OPT, including in Gaza, basic rights and services that they provide Israeli settlers living
in the same legal territory, including freedom of movement, the right to live with or visit
loved ones living in that territory, and access to 24-hour electricity and clean water.
Legal Status
Palestinians in Gaza, like those in the West Bank, hold Israeli-issued identity cards and
passports that grant them residency in Gaza, but they do not have citizenship or
nationality. About 70 percent of Gaza’s nearly 2.1 million residents are refugees forced to
flee their homes in what became Israel, or their descendants, who have been denied their
right to return to the areas where they or their families once lived. 482 Israeli authorities
struck from the registry thousands of Palestinians from Gaza who were not present in the
territory in 1967 when the occupation began, either because they had fled during the
fighting or were already abroad, as well as more than 100,000 between 1967 and 1994 who
had been abroad for long periods. 483 Palestinians not in the population registry cannot

Until 2005, the Israeli army ruled directly over Gaza, while applying Israeli civil law to the
more than 7,500 Jewish settlers who lived there. 485 Following the withdrawal of those
settlers in 2005 and the takeover by Hamas in 2007, Israel declared Gaza “hostile
territory” 486 and tightened movement restrictions, imposing a generalized ban on travel to
the rest of the OPT or abroad, irrespective of any individualized risk assessment for a
particular person. That ban applies to all Palestinians except those whom Israeli
authorities deem as presenting “exceptional humanitarian circumstances.” 487 This
closure, alongside Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza, has remained in place
since 2007 and has separated families and restricted residents from accessing medical
care and educational and economic opportunities. 488 By contrast, Israeli settlers in the
OPT enjoy freedom of movement across much of the OPT, including to East Jerusalem and
West Bank settlements, as well as to Israel and abroad.
The shifts that took place between 2005 and 2007 altered the mechanisms but not the fact of
Israeli control of the Gaza Strip, nor the systematic oppression of its population. The
withdrawal of settlers and regular ground forces from Gaza shifted Israel’s practice from one
focused on raids and arrests as in the West Bank to one built on the periodic use of
overwhelming military force, often with devastating consequences for the civilian population.
In the period since 2007, the Israeli army conducted several large-scale military offensives
in Gaza, including in 2008-09, 2012, and 2014, and clashed scores of times with
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza. During these confrontations, Israeli forces regularly

or damage fences between Gaza and Israel regardless of whether they posed an imminent
threat to life. These practices stem from a decades-long pattern that has changed little
protests and disturbances, at great cost to civilians. Despite the frequency of such
incidents over the years, Israeli authorities have failed to develop law enforcement tactics
that comport with international human rights norms, which prohibit the use of lethal force
except in situations when it is necessary to prevent an imminent threat of death or serious
injury. 501 Israeli authorities have often justified these tactics in the name of protecting
Israeli communities on the other side of the Gaza fence from the possibility of harm, 502 but
without justifying the force used under the imminent-threat test.

Further confining the Palestinians of Gaza, Israeli authorities have established a “buffer
zone” inside Gaza, as opposed to on its side of the fences that they have built separating
Gaza from Israel. The Israeli army told the Israeli rights group Gisha in August 2015 that it
forbids Gaza residents from approaching within 300 meters of the fence, except for those
farmers whom it permits to approach within 100 meters of the fence. 504 Israeli forces
routinely fire on those who enter or approach the “buffer zone.” Between 2010 and 2017,
before the wave of protests that began in March 2018, Gisha reported 1,300 incidents of
live fire on Gaza residents, which killed 161 Palestinians and injured more than 3,000. 505
Since 2014, Israeli authorities have also regularly sprayed herbicides along the eastern
fences to remove vegetation, it says in order to “enable optimal and continuous security
operations.” 506 Authorities have also said that the spraying takes place “exclusively” over

documented how the westward wind causes herbicide sprayed on the Israeli side of the
pesticides has caused extensive damage to crops in an area that includes the most arable
land in all of Gaza, causing financial loss for farmers, 509 and can impair the health of
people living in the area. 510
Citing concerns about weapons smuggling, Israeli authorities also restrict how much of the
sea, including Gaza’s territorial waters, residents can access. For years, they generally
permitted Palestinians to venture up to six nautical miles off the coast, though subject to
frequent fluctuations; for a short period in 2019, they extended the limit to 15 nautical
miles, though at other times barred access entirely. 511 Israel has not justified these
fluctuations in the fishing zone on security grounds, but rather as punitive measures in
response to rocket fire or the launching of incendiary balloons by armed Palestinian
groups, acts with which fishermen had no involvement. 512 Between 2010 and 2017, the
Palestinian rights group Al-Mezan documented 976 incidents of live fire at sea, resulting in
five deaths and 250 incidents in which Israeli authorities seized boats or other equipment,
allegedly for traveling beyond the permissible fishing zone. 513 B’Tselem in 2017 found that

Resources and Services
Discriminatory restrictions and burdens imposed by Israeli authorities restrict the entry
and exit of goods in and out of Gaza and limit the access of Gazans to basic services, such
as electricity and water.
The 13-year-old closure sharply restricts the movement of goods. Following Hamas’s
takeover in 2007 and Israel’s declaration of Gaza as “hostile territory,” 515 Israeli
authorities between September 2007 and May 2010 banned most civilian goods from
entering Gaza, including coriander, paper, and chocolate. 516 Israeli authorities in January
2008 calculated the minimum number of calories per person that Gaza residents needed
to avoid malnutrition, although they insist they never implemented a policy based on the
calculation. 517 Israeli officials said at the time that they wanted to keep Gaza’s economy
“on the brink of collapse” while avoiding a humanitarian crisis. 518
Since 2010, Israeli authorities have allowed most everyday goods to enter, but sharply
restrict and often prohibit altogether what they deem “dual-use” items or those that could
be used for military purposes, such as for building or fortifying tunnels into Israel. 519 The
government’s “dual-use” list, though, includes both overly broad categories and items
that are vital to meet the needs of Gaza’s population, including “communications
equipment,” “steel elements and construction products,” “drilling equipment,” “fertilizers
and chemicals,” gas tanks, castor oil, and “vehicles except for personal vehicles (not

equipment, including x-ray equipment, as “dual use,” according to the WHO. 521 Gisha has
has said that these “restrictions impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance, basic
services and reconstruction programs, and undermine the response capacity for
emergencies.” 523 However, Israeli authorities have maintained them in lieu of alternatives,
such as international monitoring of the use of dual-use items. Egypt only began formally
allowing goods into Gaza in February 2018, but subject to unclear procedures, including
denials of some goods also barred by Israeli authorities and at a volume significantly less
than through the Israeli-administered crossing. 524
As part of the closure policy, Israeli authorities also sharply restrict the export of goods out
of Gaza to the West Bank, Israel, and abroad. Between June 2007 and October 2014, Israeli
authorities on average permitted only 14 truckloads of goods to exit per month, according
to Gisha. 525 The situation has improved somewhat since, with an average of 219
truckloads per month exiting for the four-year period between 2016 and 2019, but that still
is just roughly 20 percent of the 1,064 truckloads per month exiting prior to the June 2007
tightening of the closure. 526 Egypt does not allow goods from Gaza to be shipped out via
the crossing it administers. 527

Israeli authorities have acknowledged that their determinations do not turn solely on
security. They have, for example, restricted or shut down exports as a punitive measure,
authorities have acknowledged taking into account “considerations relating to
manufacturing capabilities, as well as supply and demand in the relevant markets.” 529
Israeli authorities, for example, forbid the marketing of many fruits and vegetables from
Gaza in the West Bank and Israel. 530 While there is a wider variety of produce that can be
sold from Gaza in the West Bank, Israeli authorities only in practice permitted, as of March
2021, the sale of eggplants and tomatoes to the Israeli market. 531 It also until November
2020 banned processed goods from Gaza entering markets in the West Bank and Israel. 532
Not only do no such restrictions exist on Israeli producers in the OPT, but Israel has
through its restrictions created in Gaza a “captive market,” as Gisha has put it, for Israeli
businesses. 533 More than 80 percent of the goods entering Gaza are purchased from
Israeli companies and suppliers, the value of which in 2015 alone amounted to almost 2
billion NIS (over $600 million), according to Gisha. 534 The Israeli cement company Nesher
also produces nearly all the cement used in Gaza. 535

These restrictions have devastated Gaza’s economy. 536 Gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita in Gaza dropped 23 percent between 1994 and 2016 in real dollars. 537 Eighty
more than half the population lives below the poverty line. 539 Unemployment rates in Gaza
have for some time hovered around 50 percent and are higher for young people and
women. 540
Israeli policies also sharply limit access to basic services, such as electricity and water.
Between 1967 and 2002, Gaza depended on electricity it received from the Israeli Electric
Corporation (IEC). 541 Although Gaza’s power plant became operational in 2002, it has
operated at only partial capacity, in part as a result of several Israeli aerial attacks, and
Gaza remains “almost completely dependent,” as the Israeli Supreme Court put it in 2008,
on Israel for its supply of electricity, either directly or indirectly. 542 The IEC, though, sells
only a set quantity of electricity to Gaza, which is insufficient to meet the demand of the
population, even if the power plant operated at full capacity, and periodically reduces
supply. 543 In 2017, for example, it cut by 30 percent the amount it supplied Gaza, following
a request from the PA, which sought to pressure Hamas authorities to relinquish their

other times over disputes in payments, the amount of industrial fuel it allows to be
purchased for the plant, which the plant needs to operate. 548 Israel has also restricted the
entry of solar panels and batteries, hampering efforts to develop alternative energy
sources that would give Gaza a degree of energy autonomy. 549 Gaza has at times
purchased a small quantity of electricity from Egypt, but an amount insufficient to meet the
needs of its residents. 550 In 2017 and 2018, Gaza averaged 6.2 hours per day of electricity;
that figure increased to 12 in 2019, largely due to Israel permitting Qatar to purchase fuel
for use in Gaza through Israeli vendors. 551 Meanwhile, Israeli settlers in the OPT enjoy
uninterrupted electricity, mostly from the same IEC. Regular power outages affect many

water pollution accounts for 26 percent of illnesses in Gaza and is the leading cause of
child mortality. 555 Gaza also purchases water from the Israeli water utility Mekorot, but
Israel controls the supply. Water from Mekorot goes through the same pipeline system as
the groundwater and mixes with it, reducing its quality. 556 Gaza’s old water pipeline
system also causes about a 30 percent loss of supply through leaks, 557 but Israel
complicates its maintenance by restricting the import of about 70 percent of the materials
and equipment needed to repair the water and sewage systems on the grounds that they
are “dual-use” items. 558 Gaza desalinates some water, but desalination requires
significant electricity, fuel, and funding. 559 These limitations force most Gaza households
to rely on purchasing purified water from private companies for drinking when they can
afford it. 560 In 2019, Gaza residents used 79 liters per day of water, an increase from 2017

“Yazan”: Yazan, 26, felt his dream had come true; the University of Nottingham in the
United Kingdom offered him admission for undergraduate studies. Yazan missed the start
of the semester in October 2018, as he awaited a reply to his application for an Israeliissued permit and a letter allowing him to travel via Jordan to the UK. He received the
permit in December and, on December 18, 2018, arrived at the Erez Checkpoint to begin his
journey. Upon his arrival, though, an Israeli soldier escorted him to a room for questioning.
He told Human Rights Watch that soldiers asked him about the situation in Gaza, one of
his neighbors and a payment his father made. 562 After waiting three hours, a soldier
returned and said, “You’ll be able to travel and everything will go well. How about
providing us with some simple things in exchange for money and travel?” Yazan took this
statement to be a request to provide intelligence about people in his community, and he
refused. The soldier turned him away, warning that “you are ruining your future,” and
urged him “to think about it.” Yazan said he considered leaving via Rafah, the crossing
with Egypt, but the Hamas-administered waiting list was long, he could not afford to pay
the several thousand dollars to advance his place on the waitlist, and the opportunity
passed. Israel’s separation policy effectively makes it impossible for Yazan to pursue
educational or professional opportunities in the West Bank, even though his mother is
from Nablus. 563 He ended up studying in Gaza and now does temporary contract jobs, but
“still has the same dream to study abroad” and continues to pursue scholarships. He told
Human Rights Watch, “I flew away with this dream, but suddenly fell down and found
myself in the real world. I feel like a bird inside a cage—I can fly in the cage, but always
remain inside it. This is Gaza—you’re inside a big prison, wondering what the world
outside has.”
“Leen”: Leen, a 23-year-old actress, received a permit to leave Gaza for a visa interview in
Jerusalem in July 2016, but decided not to return and went to live with her uncle in Jenin.
She told Human Rights Watch that her prior travels abroad made her feel that she
“wouldn’t be able to achieve anything in Gaza” and could not come to terms with

presence in the West Bank became illegal, and she said she began to fear getting stopped
and removed back to Gaza. She said, “I dream of getting a Palestinian ID that would allow
me to move freely and travel, then go back home to Gaza to see my family.” She now finds
herself stuck, unable to visit her family, but unwilling to give up her dream of pursuing a
better life in the West Bank. She added, “Gaza is a small prison. Ramallah is a big one…. If
I had the chance to go back in time, I would have remained in Gaza and just learned to
cope with life there.”
“Samia”: Samia, a 27-year-old English teacher, traveled to Jordan in 2016 for her studies.
She told Human Rights Watch that she soon decided to return to Gaza, but that her
relatives whom she visited in the West Bank convinced her to stay with them. 566 She said
she applied to change her address to the West Bank through the Palestinian Civil Affairs
Office, which forwards applications to Israeli authorities, but she received no response.
Samia began working as an English teacher in Ramallah and got engaged, but felt
constantly restricted, unable to move freely with friends and family. On July 3, 2019, she
set off in a taxi to visit her relatives in Nablus. On the way, Israeli soldiers stopped her at a
checkpoint they had set-up. Upon seeing her address listed as Gaza, they accused her of
“staying here illegally” and took her into custody at a military facility, where she spent the
night. Early the next morning, she said, officers cuffed her around her feet and hands, put
her in a vehicle without windows and drove her to the Erez Checkpoint, where they
removed her back to Gaza without her belongings or even her ID card. “It was a
nightmare,” Samia said. She had planned to get married in 2020 and had already rented a
place and began furnishing it, then “everything was gone within seconds.” She could not
believe, she said, that she “was deported from the second part of my country,” a place just
an hour away. She applied for a permit to return to the West Bank, but the Palestinian Civil
Affairs office in Gaza told her that Israelis had placed a 6-month security bloc on her,
barring her from travel. She said her fiancé twice applied for permits to visit Gaza, but

Israeli authorities denied him both times; once due to Jewish holidays and the other
without reason. She “lost hope” and even “told [her] fiancé to break up with me, if we are
live together.
“Hadil”: In 2011, Hadil, a 37-year-old who works as a social media coordinator in Gaza, fell
in love with a man from Nablus whom she met at a conference in Amman. She began
applying for permits to visit him, but Israeli authorities routinely denied them, 11 times in
total, she told Human Rights Watch. 567 In 2012, the man managed to enter Gaza through
Egypt for a visit and the two got engaged. Shortly thereafter, following a July 2013 military
coup, Egyptian authorities largely sealed their border with Gaza. Hadil applied in 2014 for a
family reunification request to live with her fiancé in the West Bank, but that was rejected
without a reason given. In late 2015, she managed to get a permit to attend a conference
abroad. On her way back, during transit via the West Bank from Jordan, she contemplated
staying. But she worried about getting caught and being sent “for life imprisonment in
Gaza,” a reference to her fear that she would not be able to secure another travel permit,
so she returned to Gaza, and the couple broke up in May 2015. In 2019, though, she
managed to obtain permits through work to travel to the West Bank and met and got
engaged to a man from Ramallah. She regularly worries, she said, about facing the same
fate with this engagement. She has spoken to lawyers to file a request to change her
address, she said, but they have told her that the odds are quite low that Israel will allow
her to establish legal residence in the West Bank, and that the process will take significant
time. Her fiancé’s family has encouraged her to stay without status in the West Bank, but
she is unwilling to take that risk. The couple does not consider Gaza an option, she said,
because they have already purchased a home in the West Bank and did not want to
separate her fiancé from his family. With the path to living together in the OPT effectively
closed, they are now, she said, focused on finding a way to live together abroad.
“Kiran”: 33-year-old Kiran and her husband decided in 2016 to move from Gaza to the West
Bank in search of a better life. Kiran told Human Rights Watch that her husband obtained a
permit to travel as a businessperson and decided to remain in the West Bank. 568 Without
meeting the stringent criteria for which Israel permits Gazan residents to travel, Kiran
obtained a falsified medical referral indicating that her then 3-year-old son needed to

permit and her a permit to accompany him, and they traveled in 2017 alongside her 8husband requested to change his address to one in the West Bank in 2016, but, as of
writing, had not received a reply. Kiran said her family of five, including a third child they
had in the West Bank, lives in “constant fear” of getting caught and being sent back to
Gaza, and stays home whenever “there is any tension.” They “feel like strangers inside
[their own] home,” as if they “are illegally residing in another country.” She said she has
missed many family occasions in Gaza, including weddings for both of her brothers, and
that her husband hasn’t seen his five children from a prior marriage since he left Gaza. She
said she has considered returning to Gaza, but she worries about how life in Gaza would
affect her three young boys. She told Human Rights Watch that “my boys get so happy
when they see planes in the sky…I can’t imagine their reaction when they see the planes
they love firing missiles and bombs. I don’t want them to experience war and death.”

Institutional Discrimination in Israel
Authorities inside Israel institutionally discriminate between the country’s Jewish and
Palestinian inhabitants, though in ways less severe than the oppression and persecution
of the OPT. There are roughly 6.2 million Jews and about 1.6 million Palestinians within
Green Line Israel, according to data from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. 569 Israel’s
Proclamation of Independence affirms the “complete equality” of all residents.
Palestinians in Israel are citizens who have the right to vote in national elections, unlike
Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem (except for the small minority of
Palestinian Jerusalemites who have applied for and been granted Israeli citizenship). For
the first 17 years of Israel’s existence as a nation, however, Israeli authorities placed most
Palestinians under military rule, confining them to dozens of enclaves, requiring them to
obtain permits to leave their enclaves, and severely restricting their rights. 570 When

military rule ended in 1966, authorities granted Palestinians in Israel freedom of
movement, but they continue to treat Jewish Israelis and Palestinians in starkly unequal
services. This discriminatory treatment is undertaken to further Jewish Israeli control over
demographics and land as officials have directly acknowledged. 571

Legal Status
Israel maintains a two-track citizenship structure that treats Palestinians unequally as
compared to Jews. While both Jews and Palestinians living in Israel are citizens, Israel’s
citizenship process privileges Jews and sharply restricts which Palestinians, beyond most
existing residents and their descendants, can become citizens.
Israel’s 1952 Citizenship Law at its outset notes that the state grants citizenship via four
routes: (1) “return,” (2) “residence in Israel,” (3) birth, and (4) naturalization. 572 Israel
reserves the first path, “return,” exclusively for Jews. This path grows out of the 1950 “Law
of Return,” which guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to settle in
Israel. 573 The Citizenship Law states that Jews already living in Israel at the time gain
citizenship via this path, as opposed to the “residence in Israel” one.
Palestinians, by contrast, obtained citizenship in 1952 via the second path, “residence in
Israel.” The law, though, conditions citizenship on proving residency before 1948,
inclusion in the population registry, and continuous presence or legal entry in the period
between 1948 and 1952. None of these restrictions apply to Jewish Israelis. The language
not only excludes the more than 700,000 Palestinians that fled or were expelled from their
homes in 1948, along with their descendants, 574 but also those not counted in the
population registry due to a perfunctory registration process and those not present or not

out. See Shira Robinson, Citizen Strangers: Palestinians and the Birth of Israel's Liberal Settler State (Stanford: Stanford

Haaretz reported in 2017 that Israeli authorities had revoked the citizenship of “hundreds
if not thousands” of Palestinian Bedouins in the Negev region in recent years over alleged
“erroneous registration” by them or their families between 1948 and 1952. 576 In an August
2020 Knesset hearing, government officials acknowledged investigating the circumstances
around the granting of citizenship to about 2,600 people and said that they had concluded
that about 500 of them had been granted citizenship by mistake, although they claimed to
have reestablished the citizenship of 362 of them via an expedited process. 577
While the third path, birth, covers both Jews and Palestinians, the fourth, naturalization,
applies only to non-Jews. The Citizenship Law permits the Interior Ministry to grant
citizenship to those who meet a number of conditions, including several years of residency
in Israel, intention to settle, knowledge of Hebrew, renunciation of foreign citizenship, and
oath of loyalty.
In July 2003, the Israeli government issued Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law
(Temporary Order), which effectively suspended the naturalization process, as well as the
granting of long-term status, for Palestinian spouses of Israeli citizens or residents from
the West Bank and Gaza. 578 The Supreme Court has upheld the law and the Knesset has
renewed it every year since, most recently in June 2020. In 2005, the Knesset permitted

Israeli authorities also distinguish between citizenship and nationality, and structurally
discriminate between citizens based on their nationality. The Israeli government registers
the nationality of all citizens and, until 2005, included nationality on each citizen’s identity
card. 580 Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are deemed to belong to different nationalities:
“Jew” and “Arab”. While recognizing more than 140 nationalities, the government does not
recognize an “Israeli nationality” and has denied requests of citizens to identify their
nationality as such. 581 Citizens have appealed this denial to the Supreme Court, which
upheld it. In 2013, the Court reaffirmed a 1972 ruling denying that “an Israeli nationality
had come into being, separate and differentiated from a Jewish nationality.” 582 In a
concurring opinion, Justice Hanan Melcer wrote that “the ‘constitutional Jewishness’ of the
state negates the legal possibility of recognizing an ‘Israeli nationality’ which is distinct,
as it were, from the ‘Jewish nationality’.” 583
The bifurcation between citizenship and nationality means that Israeli law relegates
Palestinians at birth to an inferior status by law. Israel has long defined itself as the
“nation-state of the Jewish people,” as enshrined in its 2018 Basic Law: Israel—The NationState of the Jewish People. That law, which has constitutional status, articulates for Jews
alone the right of self-determination and makes it a national priority to build homes for
Jews but not others. 584 Excluding Palestinians from the state’s definition of the nation
provides a legal basis to pursue policies that favor Jewish Israelis to the detriment of

Palestinians, in the name of advancing the “national interest” or “national security.” For
example, in November 2020, an Israeli magistrate court cited the 2018 Nation-State law to
incurred commuting to a nearby Palestinian school, since there are no such schools in the
city of Karmiel in northern Israel where they live. The ruling stated that “Karmiel is a Jewish
city intended to solidify Jewish settlement in the Galilee. The establishment of an Arabiclanguage school or even the funding of school transportation for Arab students is liable to
alter the demographic balance and damage the city’s character.” It added that “the
development and establishment of Jewish settlement is a national value enshrined in the
Basic Law and is a worthy and dominant consideration in municipal decision-making.” 585
Legal measures aimed at protecting the Jewish character of the state that discriminate
against Palestinians undermine the pledge in Israel’s Proclamation of Independence to
“ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of
religion, race or sex.” Palestinian citizens vote in elections and have served in the Knesset,
but Israel’s Basic Law: The Knesset—1958, which has constitutional status, declares that
no candidate can run for the Knesset if they expressly or implicitly endorse “negation of
the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.” 586 Israel’s Law of
Political Parties (1992) further bars registration of any party whose goals directly or
indirectly deny “the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.” 587 While the
Supreme Court often opts against disqualifying candidates for violating these
provisions, 588 the provisions formally block Palestinians from challenging the laws that
codify their subjugation and, in so doing, diminish the value of the right of Palestinian
citizens to vote. The fact that no government in Israel’s history has ever included

Land and Housing
As a result of decades of land confiscations and discriminatory land policies, Israeli
authorities have hemmed in Palestinian towns and villages, while nurturing the growth and
expansion of Jewish communities, many of which in practice exclude Palestinians. The
majority of Palestinians in Israel live in these communities, while some live in “mixed
cities” like Tel Aviv-Jaffa and Haifa. 591
Ninety-three percent of all land in Israel constitutes state land, directly controlled by the
Israeli government. 592 Israeli authorities confiscated much of this land, several million
dunams, from Palestinians through several different legal instruments, as documented in a
later chapter of this report. 593 A government agency, the Israel Land Authority (ILA),
manages and allocates state lands. Almost half the members of its governing body belong

Israeli authorities have almost exclusively allocated state lands for the development and

creation of more than 900 “Jewish localities” in Israel, 598 but none for Palestinians except
for a handful of government-planned townships and villages in the Negev and Galilee,

restrict the land available for residential growth. The authorities have zoned large sections
of Palestinian towns and villages for “agricultural” use or as “green” areas, prohibited
residential building in them, and built roads and other infrastructure projects that impede
expansion. A 2003 Israeli government-commissioned report found that “many Arab towns
and villages were surrounded by land designated for purposes such as security zones,

years on these issues has resulted in more state-approved residential development, 602
villages. By contrast, in case studies documented by Human Rights Watch in each of
Israel’s six districts, planning authorities provided sufficient land and zoning permissions
to predominantly Jewish communities to facilitate their growth. 603
These restrictions create density problems and a housing crunch in Palestinian
communities. The Arab Center for Alternative Planning, based in Israel, told Human Rights
Watch in December 2018 that it estimates that 15 to 20 percent of homes in Palestinian
towns and villages lack permits, some because owners’ applications were rejected and
others because they did not apply knowing that authorities would reject their requests on
the grounds that they were contrary to the existing zoning. The group estimated that
60,000 to 70,000 homes in Israel, excluding Jerusalem, were at risk as of 2018 of full
demolition. 604 As of July 2015, 97 percent of Israel’s pending judicial demolition orders
were for structures located in Palestinian towns. 605
These dynamics most dramatically manifest themselves in the Negev, where
discriminatory Israeli policies and practices leave about 90,000 Palestinian Bedouins
living in “unrecognized” informal communities, where their homes face the constant threat
of demolition. 606 At the same time, Israeli authorities and quasi-governmental bodies have

Resources and Services
Israeli authorities discriminate in the provision of resources and services between
principally from two sources: those generated locally by taxes and those received from the
central government. The rights groups Sikkuy and Injaz found in a 2014 report that while
local taxes make up 66 percent of the revenue for localities across Israel, they constitute
only 31 percent of the overall budget for Palestinian localities. 612 While the gap in part
reflects the significantly lower tax base in Palestinian localities, the groups found a larger
disparity in income from non-residential or business taxes. They, in particular, highlighted
the dearth of “revenue-generating properties” in Palestinian municipalities, including in
the residential, industrial, commercial, tourism, banking, and infrastructure sectors. 613 In
May 2020, Sikkuy found, based on 2018 data, that while Jewish localities collected 2.5
times more in residential taxes than Palestinian ones, they collected 6.5 times more in
non-residential taxes. 614
The significantly higher levels of non-residential local taxes that Jewish localities collect
are the result of discriminatory state policies. The Knesset Research and Information
Center found in July 2018 that only 2 percent of industrial zones managed by the
government, which generate significant tax income, are located in Palestinian
municipalities. 615 Government buildings also generate significant tax revenues, but,
according to a July 2020 study by Knesset Research and Information Center, only 0.4
percent of government properties that generate tax revenues are located within Palestinian
municipalities. 616 In addition, according to Sikkuy, not a single Palestinian municipality

reside, 618 received in 2018 only 2.2 percent of the total amount of non-residential taxes
across the country. 619
Localities which collect less revenue from local taxes rely more on funding from the central
government. Here too, Israeli authorities allocate budgets in a discriminatory fashion. For
example, of the 2.82 billion NIS ($804 million) of economic recovery funds handed out by
the Israeli government to local authorities in April 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, only
1.7 percent went to Palestinian municipalities, according to Adalah. 620 In education, the
Israeli government operates two separate school systems, one for Jewish children and one
for Palestinian children in Israel. 621 Discrimination colors every aspect of the two systems;
often overcrowded and understaffed, poorly built or maintained, state schools for
Palestinian children offer fewer facilities and educational opportunities than what are
offered to Jewish Israeli children. 622 The Haifa-based rights group Mossawa Center found
based on government data that, in 2013, the annual expenditure per student in Palestinian
localities was 734 NIS ($220), as compared to 3,344 NIS ($1,004) in poor Jewish localities

While authorities in recent years have reduced budgeting inequities, significant gaps
remain. In particular, a five-year, more than 10 billion NIS ($3 billion) “economic
development plan for the Arab sector” 625 approved in December 2015 has increased
allocation to sectors like transportation. However, it did not address other areas of
disparity, including welfare services and high school education. 626 Palestinian localities
have also received funding from “equalization grants” provided by the central government
and from a governmental fund aimed at “closing the [economic] gaps” between differently
situated localities, but, according to Sikkuy, not to levels proportional to the gaps that
exist in comparison to Jewish localities.

627

The Mossawa Center found in a study of Israel’s

2019 budget that funding allocated to Palestinian areas remains “meager,” with significant
needs in education and other areas still present, and that “systematic discrimination”
remains endemic in government spending. 628
These disparities contribute to the starkly different socio-economic situations for
Palestinians and Jewish citizens. According to May 2020 figures from Israel’s Ministry for
Social Equality, 45.3 percent of Palestinian families live below the poverty line, as
compared to 13.4 percent of Jewish families. 629 Sikkuy in 2015 found that the wage gap

Case Study: Nazareth
The following case study details how Israeli authorities discriminate against the residents
of the Palestinian city of Nazareth in Israel in ways that stifle the community’s growth and
undermine its well-being while promoting the development of a Jewish-majority city next
to it.
Nazareth, the largest Palestinian locality in Israel with a population of 77,400, 631 lies in the
Galilee region within Israel’s Northern District. It is the only Palestinian city that survived
the events of 1948 intact. 632 Discriminatory Israeli land policies have restricted it to largely
the same geographical area it had then, while its population has increased more than fivefold. 633 Meanwhile, Israeli authorities established Nazareth Illit (Upper Nazareth, renamed
in 2019 Nof HaGalil; referenced henceforward by its original name) in the 1950s as a
“Jewish town,” 634 according to Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, in order to, as
a then-senior official put it, “swallow up” Nazareth. 635 A road, Highway 75 or Zionism
Road, largely demarcates the boundary today between Nazareth and Nazareth Illit. Israeli
authorities have over the years nurtured the growth and development of Nazareth Illit,
often at Nazareth’s expense. Today, Nazareth Illit has developed into a “mixed city” with

Nazarenes amid the squeeze they face, as described below. 636
Slated to belong to the Arab State under the 1947 UN partition plan, Nazareth came under
Israeli control in July 1948. Unlike the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced to
leave their communities during the establishment of the Israeli state, the residents of
Nazareth largely remained in their homes. According to historian Benny Morris, Israeli
officials gave the order to “uproot all the residents of Nazareth,” but the commander of the
nascent Israeli army’s brigade given the order, Ben Dunkelman, refused to carry it out, and

authorities eventually allowed the city to surrender. 637 Nazareth’s population increased in
the aftermath of the events of 1948, as it absorbed more than 5,000 Palestinians who had
displaced Palestinians have since remained in Nazareth, unable to return to
their villages. 639
One displaced Palestinian, 85-year-old souvenir-shop-owner Ameen Muhammad Ali,
known as Abu Arab, told Human Rights Watch that he ended up in Nazareth in 1949
months after he and his family fled his home village of Safuriyya, which then stood six
kilometers north of Nazareth, amid Israeli fire. 640 He was 13 at the time. After several
months in Lebanon, he said his family managed to cross back into Israel before Israeli
forces tightened border controls and blocked refugees from returning. 641 Some other
Safuriyya residents also managed to return, which prompted Israeli authorities in January
1949, as historian Benny Morris documented, to forcibly expel residents who remained in
the village or had returned there. 642 Later that year, Israeli authorities established the
Jewish moshav, or cooperative village, of Tzipori on Safuriyya’s lands. 643 Abu Arab said his
family lost their home and about 200 dunams of land they owned in the village.
Later in 1949, Abu Arab’s family moved to a neighborhood in Nazareth that came to be
known as Safafra because of the many displaced Safuriyya residents who ended up

their descendants constitute about half of Nazareth’s population. 645 Most of Abu Arab’s
returned to the country, and they and their descendants remain refugees today, largely
barred from even visiting. Abu Arab said he sometimes visits Tzipori, which today restricts
who can live or enter there, in part to take care of five cemeteries in the moshav where
Safuriyya’s ancestors, including two of his cousins, are buried. He said he used to be able
to see the lands of Safuriyya from his home in Nazareth and longs to return. 646
Shortly after the establishment of the Israeli state, Israeli authorities placed Nazareth
under military rule and began in the 1950s implementing a policy to “Judaize the
Galilee.” 647 The establishment of Nazareth Illit became a key part of that strategy, as the
army’s then-Planning Department Director Yuval Ne’eman put it, to “emphasize and
safeguard the Jewish character of the Galilee as a whole.” 648 The northern military
governor at the time, Colonel Mikhael Mikhael, wrote that the establishment of Nazareth
Illit would result in the “transfer of the center of gravity of life from Nazareth to the Jewish
neighborhood.” 649
Israeli authorities established Nazareth Illit in the 1950s on lands belonging to residents of
Nazareth and other nearby villages. The first confiscation, of about 1,200 dunams of land
from Nazareth, took place in June 1954 under a 1943 law (Acquisition for Public Purpose
Ordinance), a relic of British mandate law that permits the taking of land for a public
purpose. 650 Nazarenes brought a legal challenge against the decision, but the Israeli
Supreme Court upheld it, based on a state declaration that it confiscated the land solely to
build government facilities. 651 Authorities used only a fraction of the land for government

the [state] institutions there. It is a colonizing act with difficulties, but without it we will not
be able to Judaize Nazareth.” 653
Keen to avoid relegating the Jewish community to a minority status in Nazareth, Israeli
officials opted in the late 1950s to make Nazareth Illit a separate locality, with the aim of
later merging the municipalities once the Jewish community surpassed the Palestinian
population. 654 Authorities continued to confiscate Palestinian land to develop Nazareth
Illit into the 1960s and 1970s, including a 160 dunam plot of land in the center of Nazareth
known as the Sprinzak Enclave. A military base for years and home to a hotel, the site falls
within the municipality of Nazareth Illit, despite its location in the center of Nazareth,
meaning Nazareth Illit receives the taxes based on the facilities there. 655 Through these
confiscations, Nazareth Illit deepened its footprint in the Galilee, weaving between
Nazareth and six other Palestinian villages and impeding the establishment of a larger,
contiguous Palestinian municipal area. Nazareth-based journalist Jonathan Cook has
written that Nazareth Illit’s development blocked Nazareth from “transform[ing] into the
true capital of Israel’s Palestinian minority,” a nearly 200,000 person “conurbation” in the
center of Israel, and instead effectively turned Nazareth into, as one Nazarene put it to
him, “the largest Arab village in Israel.” 656
Nazareth had a population of about 15,000 and a land mass, according to one historian, of
12,599 dunams before 1948. 657 Today, its population is 77,400 and its size is 14,172
dunams. 658 Israeli authorities only approved their first master plan for Nazareth in 2009;

expansion of Nazareth over more than 70 years, totaling more than 6,000 dunams, has

estimated that it needed between 10,403 and 12,378 more dunams to meet the needs of
residents, including for new residential neighborhoods, land for industrial and commercial
development, and more public spaces. 661 In a survey of Nazareth residents conducted in
2013 by Professor Yosef Jabareen of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa,
71.8 percent of those surveyed said that the local regulations barred them from any
construction to expand their current properties. 662
The restricted access to land for housing to accommodate natural population growth has
created density problems and a housing crunch in Nazareth. In the same survey, 86.6 of
residents identified traffic and 83.7 population density as “very serious” problems. 663
Musab Dukhan, a member of Nazareth’s municipal council, told Human Rights Watch that
“narrow streets and a lack of space for parking creates heavy traffic” and that “there is no
space for the new generation to build a future here and remain in the city.” 664 One resident
described Nazareth as a “city that can’t breathe and always feels tense.” 665
While restricting Nazareth, Israeli authorities have allowed Nazareth Illit to grow rapidly.
Built in part on state land and designated as a city to receive new Jewish immigrants,
Israeli authorities invested heavily in Nazareth Illit, including by establishing in 1992 the

slated to be a regional industrial zone encompassing 3,560 dunams, 666 none of the
revenues it generates go to Nazareth, located just to the south, or Palestinian villages
consisting of carpentry workshops in the Old City and the other of car repair shops. 668
Nazareth long served as a regional administrative hub. Beginning in the late 1950s, Israeli
authorities gradually relocated many government offices servicing the region from
Nazareth to Nazareth Illit. The offices moved include those belonging to the agriculture
ministry, the education ministry, the health ministry, the interior ministry, the prime
minister’s office, the census bureau, the customs, and value-added tax division, the
taxation authority, the land registration department, and the Magistrate’s, District and
District Labor Courts. 669 Some buildings are located to the west of Highway 75, on the
Nazareth side of the road, but fall within the municipal boundaries Nazareth Illit.
Moving these offices meant that Nazareth lost access to the significant tax revenues that
government offices generate and that could have spurred development. 670 In a 2017
report, the Arab Center for Alternative Planning calculated that Nazareth received less than
30 percent of the per capita non-residential taxes, which largely stem from taxes on
businesses and government properties, of Nazareth Illit. 671
The Israeli government policy of funneling resources from Nazareth to Nazareth Illit has
also underlined its approach to tourism. Although widely known as Jesus’ hometown and
home to a key church in the Christian tradition, authorities historically invested little in
Nazareth’s tourism infrastructure and, as a result, the city benefited little from the flocks of

The first commercial chain hotel in Nazareth did not open until the late 1990s. 674
Subsequent governments revoked Nazareth’s tourism priority status, while retaining it for
Nazareth Illit, which had received it in the 1970s. 675
Three business owners in or near Nazareth’s Old City—one runs a restaurant, one a café,
and one a souvenir shop—told Human Rights Watch that tourists and in particular
organized tour groups often spend only an hour or two visiting Nazareth’s churches,
without entering the Old City or spending money or the night in the city. 676 Some stay in
hotels in Nazareth Illit, while others continue on to eat and sleep in the nearby
predominantly Jewish city of Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee. 677
The lack of revenue-generating properties, as well as discriminatory allocation of budgets
from the central government, means Nazareth residents often receive inferior services

difference in the number of students per classroom between Nazareth and Nazareth Illit

The housing crunch, density, and high rents push many Nazarenes to quit the city.
Nazarenes often head to nearby predominantly Jewish localities to spend time in parks,
given the paucity of those or other public spaces in their hometown. When one Nazareth
resident sought to enter a public park in the nearby predominantly Jewish city of Afula in
June 2019, security guards barred her entry upon learning that she was from Nazareth, just
months after Afula’s mayor promised to act against the “conquest of the park,” calling for
residents to “hoist Israeli flags throughout the park and play music in Hebrew,” and
campaigned on a platform of “preserving the Jewish character of Afula.” 681 The city
reversed course and agreed to open its park to all visitors following a lawsuit by Adalah. 682
Ironically, thousands of Nazarenes have moved to Nazareth Illit in recent years, many of
them purchasing property from Jewish Israelis who were resettled there as immigrants and
then earned enough to “head for a better life in the center of the country,” according to
Cook. 683 Nazarene restaurant owner Khalil Haddad, 43, told Human Rights Watch that,
although born and raised in Nazareth Illit, he and his wife decided when they got married
in 2006 to live in Nazareth, considering it their “national duty” as Palestinians. However,
the population density, housing crunch, and lack of playgrounds, parks, and other public
spaces gradually eroded his opposition to living in Nazareth Illit, and they finally decided
to move there in 2014. 684
Some of the factors that motivated Haddad to leave the city he loved with his young family
bear some similarities to pressures that lead urban dwellers in other contexts to move out
of cities, including high housing costs, congestion, and a shortage of green space. In the

Hava Bachar, Nazareth Illit’s general manager, told Human Rights Watch in 2020 that 26
percent of the city’s residents today are Palestinian, many from Nazareth, which she
attributes to the fact that “Nazareth and other nearby [Palestinian] towns do not have
space to grow.” 685 Bachar noted that the municipality was not about to “give away land”
to these communities, given “our ambition to reach 100,000 citizens” and suggested
instead that Israel build “a new city for Arab citizens.” 686 Bachar noted that the city is
“bringing in Jewish families to settle” in order to “ensure it stays Jewish.” 687
Despite moving, many Nazarenes who live in Nazareth Illit maintain a center of life in
Nazareth. Haddad said he continues to do his shopping, including for groceries, in
Nazareth, referring to Nazareth Illit as a “bedroom community.” 688 It does not have a state
school to serve the roughly 3,000 school-age Palestinian children, forcing most, including
Haddad’s son, to commute to Nazareth, since Palestinian and Jewish Israelis attend
separate schools. 689 Former Nazareth Illit mayor Shimon Gafsou, who once described
Nazareth as a “nest of terror,” 690 told the Washington Post in 2013 that “I would rather cut
off my right arm than build an Arab school.” 691

V. Inhumane Acts and Other Abuses of
Fundamental Rights
Grave abuses, or “inhuman[e] acts” as set out in the Apartheid Convention and Rome
Statute, amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid when carried out in the context
of systematic oppression with an intent to maintain a system of domination. Severe
abuses of fundamental rights make up the crime against humanity of persecution when
carried out with discriminatory intent.
To maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, Israeli authorities have
carried out over many years a range of serious abuses.
In the OPT, many of these abuses amount to inhumane acts, one of the three elements of
the crime of apartheid, including:
•

sweeping restrictions on movement;

•

the confiscation of hundreds of thousands of dunams of land in the West Bank
from Palestinians, depriving them of their property, means of livelihood and way of
life, and consequent hemming in of the densely populated enclaves where most
live;

•

the imposition of harsh conditions, including near-categorical denial of building
permits, in large parts of the West Bank that coerce thousands to abandon their
homes in conditions that amount to forcible transfer;

•

the denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their
relatives for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods
during the first few decades of the occupation, or as a result of the effective freeze
on family reunification over the past two decades; and

•

the suspension of basic civil rights, such as freedom of assembly and association,
depriving millions of the opportunity to have a voice in the wide range of affairs
that most affect their daily lives and futures.

Separately from the inhumane acts carried out in the OPT, the Israeli government has
carried out abuses against Palestinians within Israel, including:

•

refusing to allow Palestinians access to the millions of dunams of land that were
confiscated from them;
implementing policies that make it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of
Palestinians in the Negev region to live lawfully in the communities they have lived
in for decades;

•

not permitting the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in
1948 and their descendants to return to Israel; and

•

restricting legal residency in ways that block many Palestinian spouses and
families from living together in Israel.

Carried out pursuant to long-standing policies and practices of the Israeli government,
these acts dispossess many Palestinians, bar some from entering their places of origin,
block others from leaving it, forcibly separate families, and wreak havoc on the lives of
many more.

Inhumane Acts in the OPT

Movement Restrictions
For over two decades, Israeli authorities have imposed sweeping restrictions on the ability
of the more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza to leave that territory and sharply
restricted the movement of 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank, both within that
territory and beyond.
Closure of Gaza
For the last 25 years, Israel has increasingly restricted the movement of Gaza residents.
Since 2007, the year that Hamas seized effective political control over the Gaza Strip from
the Fatah-led PA, Israel has imposed a generalized travel ban on movement in and out of
the small territory with few exceptions. The Israeli army since 2007 has limited travel
through the Erez Crossing, the passenger crossing from Gaza to the other part of the OPT,
the West Bank, and abroad, as well as to Israel. Israel has limited passage to cases
presenting what it deems “exceptional humanitarian circumstances,” meaning mainly
those needing vital medical treatment outside Gaza and their companions, although
authorities also grant permits each year to hundreds of Gaza residents eligible on other
grounds, such as high-level businesspeople and merchants. 693 Israel has restricted
movement even for those seeking to travel under these narrow exceptions to Israel’s
closure policy. 694 Most Gaza residents do not fit within these exemptions. For the five-year
period between January 2015 and December 2019, an average of about 373 Palestinians
exited Gaza via Erez each day, less than 1.5 percent of the daily average of 26,000 in
September 2000, before the closure, according to the Israeli rights group Gisha. 695 Most
Palestinians who grew up under this closure have never exited Gaza.
Israeli authorities have also for more than two decades sharply restricted the use of Gaza’s
airspace and territorial waters by Palestinians. They blocked both reopening an airport that

Palestinians once operated there, and building a seaport, leaving them dependent on
leaving Gaza by land in order to travel abroad. 696 Egypt has for much of the last 15 years
world, contributing to the closure.
Israel restricts all travel between Gaza and the West Bank, despite its having recognized
the two to be part of a single territorial unit, 697 even when the travel takes place via the
circuitous route through Egypt and Jordan rather than through Israeli territory. The closure
adversely affects many aspects of everyday life and contributes to other violations of
Palestinians’ rights, including the right to family reunification, the right to access
healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. 698
Israeli authorities often justify the closure on security grounds. Authorities have said in
particular that they want to minimize travel between Gaza and the West Bank to prevent
transferring “a human terrorist infrastructure” from Gaza to the West Bank, the latter of which
has a porous border with Israel and is home to hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. 699
As an occupying power that maintains significant control over aspects of life in Gaza
despite the formal withdrawal of its troops, 700 Israel has obligations under international
humanitarian law to ensure the welfare of the population there. Palestinians also have the
right under international human rights law to freedom of movement, in particular, within

policy of presumptively denying free movement, with narrow exceptions, based on
generalized security threats and irrespective of any individualized assessment of the
concerns against the human right to freedom of movement. While Israel has legitimate
security concerns in regulating entry to its territory, those concerns cannot justify the
massive violation of rights that the near-total travel ban inflicts on the over two million
Palestinians living in a sliver of territory.
Permit Regime in the West Bank
Israeli authorities have also imposed onerous restrictions on freedom of movement in the
West Bank that they justify based on “substantive security reasons” given that
“Palestinian residents from the region carried out… hundreds of deadly terrorist
attacks.” 701 Israeli policies, however, restrict the movement of all Palestinians, not just
those whom authorities deem to present a security threat. The army requires Palestinian ID
holders, with narrow exemptions, to apply to the Israeli army for time-limited permits to
enter significant parts of the West Bank,

including East Jerusalem, the “seam zone”

between the separation barrier and the Green Line which covers more than 184,000
dunams, 703 and areas controlled by settlements and the army, while allowing Israelis and
foreigners to move freely among these areas, as well as to Israel, without permits. To
obtain permits, Palestinians “face an arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic
system,” with “no way of assessing the chances that their applications will be approved or
how soon,” according to the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. 704 “Many applications are
denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal,” and “permits already granted
are easily revoked, also without explanation,” B’Tselem adds. Those denied permits

When it comes to travel abroad, Palestinians in the West Bank must travel via Jordan
through the Israeli-controlled Allenby Crossing, unless they receive a difficult-to-secure
permit to leave from Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. But Israeli authorities sometimes
ban them from using that crossing on unspecified security grounds. 706 Between 2015 and
2019, the Israeli rights group HaMoked filed administrative appeals against 797 Israeliissued travel bans on Palestinians. 707
While countries have wide latitude to restrict entry at their own borders, Israel largely
restricts movement of the occupied population not only to travel between the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, even when it does not take place through Israel, but also within the
West Bank itself. Israeli authorities, for example, have erected nearly 600 permanent
obstacles, such as checkpoints and roadblocks, within the West Bank, according to
OCHA. 708 Palestinians also regularly face ad-hoc “flying” checkpoints across the West
Bank—OCHA estimated that Israeli forces set up nearly 1,500 such checkpoints between
April 2019 and March 2020 alone. 709 Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and
delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation, obstructing commutes to school,
work, or appointments of all kinds. 710 The separation barrier, 85 percent of which falls
within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line, further encumbers movement in the
West Bank. 711

Land Expropriation and Creation of Separate Enclaves (West Bank, East Jerusalem)
Using a range of official justifications, Israel has since 1967 taken over much of the land in
the West Bank from Palestinians in large part to serve the needs of Jewish Israeli settlers.
B’Tselem and Kerem Navot have found that Israeli authorities have confiscated more than
2 million dunams of land, making up more than one-third of the West Bank. 716 Israeli
settlement authorities effectively control these lands, including about 540,000 that fall
within their formal jurisdiction.
Most commonly, Israeli authorities take land, including land privately owned by
Palestinians, by declaring it to be “state land.” 717 The Israeli group Peace Now estimates
that the Israeli government holds about 1.4 million dunams of land, or about a quarter of
the West Bank, as state land. 718

Under Israeli judicial and military practice and policy, land not formally registered as
privately owned by authorities who controlled the West Bank before 1967 can be declared
registration process that had been underway under Jordanian auspices and has not
conducted one since. Landowners who did not register their land before 1967 have the
onus of proving ownership through a lengthy and expensive process that typically involves
producing tax documents, gathering testimonies from neighbors and local officials, and
paying for a court-approved survey of the land. 719 In some cases, the authorities declared
as state land parcels on which Palestinian landowners had paid taxes to the Jordanian
authorities, a hallmark of ownership at the time. Israeli courts have upheld as legal the
state’s mechanism for declaring state land. 720
Even if ownership can be proved, Israeli authorities interpret Ottoman land law in such a
way as to take land without paying compensation to the owners when it can claim that at
least 50 percent of the parcel has not been cultivated within the prior three years. 721 This
interpretation facilitated the takeover of “absentee” property belonging to Palestinians
who fled during or following the 1967 War, as well as from Palestinians who remained in
the West Bank but lost access to their land.

722

Beginning in 1979, following an Israeli

Supreme Court ruling that restricted the army’s authority to transfer to settlements lands
confiscated on purported security grounds that it recognized as privately owned by
Palestinians, 723 the Israeli military Custodian of Government Property conducted a hasty
and error-riddled land survey that aimed to identify uncultivated lands that Israeli
authorities could claim as state land. 724 Based on the survey, Israeli authorities declared
as state land parcels that had been cultivated but not intensely, that consisted of rocky

Through this process, Israeli authorities have designated as state land about 788,000
dunams, excluding East Jerusalem but including about 100,000 dunams currently in Areas
A and B. 726 The remaining roughly 600,000 dunams of state land it holds, including about
70,00 dunams currently in Areas A and B, consists of land that Jordanian or British
authorities registered as state land during their respective reigns over the West Bank and
which Israel took control of in 1967. 727
Israeli authorities have issued hundreds of eviction orders against Palestinians they claim
are “illegally holding” state land. 728 The Israeli rights groups Kerem Navot and Haqel
found, based on a review of more than 600 eviction orders issued against Palestinians
between 2005 and 2018, that 41.5 percent of the territory encompassed by the orders had
not formally been declared by authorities as state land. 729
Of the more than 675,000 dunams of state land that Israeli authorities have officially
allocated for third parties in the West Bank, they have earmarked more than 99 percent to

Beyond what they deem state land, Israeli authorities have confiscated tens of thousands
of dunams of land they acknowledge to be privately owned by Palestinians. Peace Now,

estimates that more than 40 percent of the roughly 55,000 dunams of land outside the
acknowledged to be private Palestinian land. 732
Israeli authorities have relied on two primary legal tools to carry out confiscations of
acknowledged private Palestinian property. First, authorities have expropriated land for
public use, permanently stripping Palestinian landowners of their rights to it in return for
some compensation. 733 Second, the Israeli army, particularly during the first 12 years of its
occupation, seized privately owned land in the West Bank for security purposes. These
seizure orders did not change the title to the land, premised as they were on the
assumption that the occupation is temporary. But while continuing to list the confiscated
land as belonging to its Palestinian owners, Israeli authorities gave it to Israeli civilians
while sharply restricting its Palestinian owners and their heirs from accessing it. Kerem
Navot determined based on a review of more than 1,000 seizure orders that, between 1967
and 2014, Israeli authorities seized on security grounds more than 100,000 dunams of
land, most of it privately owned by Palestinians, for settlements or infrastructure intended
in significant part to serve the needs of settlers. 734 Most of the confiscations took place
before 1979 when the Israeli Supreme Court restricted the authority of the army to give to
settlements privately owned land that it had seized on security grounds. 735 Since that
decision, though, authorities with few exceptions have not returned to their Palestinian
owners lands they seized and allocated to settlements prior to the court decision.

In addition, settlers have established settlements without any formal process or
authorization from the Israeli military authorities, largely on the private property of
without permits, however, the authorities have, with a few notable exceptions, facilitated
the land takeover by providing infrastructure, water, electricity, and other services. 736 One
hundred and fifty of such so-called outposts have been established across the West Bank
since 1991, according to B’Tselem and Kerem Navot. 737 Peace Now has documented 60
outposts established since 2012 alone. 738 Israeli authorities retroactively granted legal

he intends to annex and incorporate outposts into Israel. 740
In February 2017, the Knesset passed a law allowing authorities to retroactively
expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements have been built. In June 2020,
however, the Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional, 741 finding that “less
harmful tools” could achieve similar ends. These include a military order cited by the

Israeli military records show other parcels of land as sold by Palestinians to Israeli
settlement entities. In many cases, though, settlers’ claims to the land they bought rely on
dubious documents or sellers not legally entitled to sell the land in question, creating
fraudulent sales. 745 Even in cases in which Palestinian landowners genuinely sell land they
owned to a settlement, such a transaction might involve duress because Israeli authorities
fully or partially prevented the Palestinian owners from making use of the land before they
sold it.
Israeli authorities have also expropriated from Palestinians nearly one-third of the land in
East Jerusalem, comprising at least 23,378 dunams according to B’Tselem, largely to build

Land grabs and restrictions confine the nearly 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank to
densely populated enclaves. Israel maintains full control over the majority of the West
Bank, including East Jerusalem and Area C. In Areas A and B, where Palestinians have a
limited degree of self-rule and which comprises the remaining roughly 40 percent of the
West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, it concentrates Palestinians, according to B’Tselem,
into “165 non-contiguous ‘territorial islands.’” 751
The mass confiscation of Palestinian land and restrictions that block Palestinians from
recovering what authorities seized from them or using their lands amount to the inhumane
act of “expropriation of landed property” under the Apartheid Convention. 752 The boxing of
Palestinians into densely populated enclaves constitutes measures “designed to divide
the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos.” 753

control (Area C), effectively forcing Palestinians in need of housing or space to establish a
business to leave these areas or to build at the risk of seeing their “unauthorized”
structures bulldozed. 754 More than 371,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem, 755 while an
estimated 300,000 Palestinians reside in Area C. 756 Israel exercises complete control over
planning procedures and construction in these areas and effectively prevents building
outside built-up areas, constituting less than one percent of Area C and 15 percent of East
Jerusalem (8.5 percent of the Jerusalem municipality), which are in many cases already
densely populated, 757 in order to maximize Jewish Israeli control over the land as

Israeli authorities refuse the vast majority of requests by Palestinians to upgrade or build

for Palestinians to build in Area C, 21 applications in total, while issuing 2,147 demolition

Largely for lacking a permit, Israeli authorities have razed thousands of Palestinian
properties. They have also demolished Palestinian homes as punishment imposed on
those accused of attacking Israelis and as collective punishment of their families. 763 From
2009 through 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 7,118 structures in East Jerusalem and
Area C, displacing 10,493 people, according to OCHA. 764 B’Tselem documented that Israeli
authorities fully demolished in this same period 2,319 homes throughout the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, for lacking a building permit, leaving 9,053 people displaced. 765
Israel has not offered resettlement options or compensation to families whose homes it
demolished. Israeli authorities also carried out 84 punitive home demolitions during this
period, acts that left 345 people without a home, according to B’Tselem. 766 International
humanitarian law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless
“absolutely necessary” for “military operations” and prohibits all acts that constitute
collective punishment. 767
These coercive policies affect many more Palestinians living in these areas, who face

These policies create a coercive environment that pressures Palestinians to leave East
Jerusalem and Area C. By making it exceedingly difficult to remain, Israeli policies induce
Palestinians in these communities to abandon their homes and livelihoods and relocate,
usually to towns or cities under the administrative and civil control of the PA. Peace Now

Valley, Israel effectively restricts them from building on about 94 percent of the territory. 770

2,601 Palestinian structures in the Jordan Valley for lacking a permit, displacing 3,716
people and affecting 23,464 others. 771 More than 250,000 Palestinians lived in the Jordan

Coercive policies have particularly affected Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley,
around Jerusalem, and in the South Hebron Hills. 775 In many of these areas, Israeli
accessing roads and agricultural lands, failed to provide electricity, sewage, water, and
other utilities, and rejected their applications for such services. Many of these
communities also have no reliable access to water sources and have to spend up to onesixth of their income to purchase water from small, portable water tankers. These
restrictions often result in children walking long distances for school and leaving residents
with limited access to health care. 776
In addition, Israel has directly deported more than 1,500 Palestinians out of the OPT,
largely before 1993, only some of whom they have permitted to return. 777
Israel’s coercive policies in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank amount to
intentional forcible transfer of civilians within an occupied territory, defined as “the
movement of individuals under duress from where they reside to a place that is not of their
choosing,” 778 a grave breach of the laws of war. The Rome Statute states that forcible
transfer can occur “directly or indirectly,” through coercive circumstances as well as direct
force, 779 and defines it, when carried out in a widespread or systematic manner, as a state
policy, as a crime against humanity and one of the kinds of inhumane acts that make up
the crime of apartheid. 780 The Israeli policies in these areas, which have coerced
thousands to leave their homes and put tens of thousands more at risk, amount to forcible
transfer under the terms of the Rome Statute. By denying building permits for houses,
schools, clinics, and infrastructure and demolishing homes and entire areas, these

Denial of Residency and Nationality
Israeli authorities have denied millions of Palestinians the right to residency and
nationality through its control over population registries, the granting of legal status and
residency rights, and entry and exit to Israel and the OPT.
West Bank and Gaza
Israeli policies on Palestinian residency have arbitrarily denied hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians the ability to live in, and travel to and from, the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli
restrictions on residency separate families, bar thousands from returning to their homes in
the OPT, trap others inside their homes or parts of the OPT, and block others from pursuing
educational or economic opportunities. 782
Israeli authorities have primarily done so through their ongoing control of the population
registry—the list of Palestinians whom authorities consider lawful residents of the OPT.
Israel requires Palestinians to be included in the population registry to obtain Israelisanctioned identification cards and passports, which allow Palestinians to reside, work,
and inherit property, but do not convey citizenship or nationality. Israeli security forces
manning checkpoints require Palestinians to present an identification card before allowing
passage for travel within the OPT, including to schools, jobs, hospitals or to visit family. 783
Egyptian authorities also require Palestinians to present an identification card or passport
to enter or exit via the Rafah crossing. 784
Israeli authorities base the population registry on a census it conducted in the West Bank
and Gaza in September 1967, several months after it took control of these areas. The

census counted 954,898 Palestinians as physically present, 785 but excluded at least
270,000 Palestinians who had been living there before 1967, but were absent during the
or other reasons. 786 Israeli authorities did not include these Palestinians in the population
registry, requiring them to obtain visitor permits to return to their homes and denying entry
to many, including all men aged 16 to 60, during the early years of the occupation. 787
Israeli authorities set up a restrictive family reunification process that operated until 2000
based on low annual quotas and subject to arbitrary and evolving criteria that failed to
take into account genuine familial or historical ties. 788
Between 1967 and 1994, Israeli authorities struck from the registry thousands of
Palestinians who traveled and stayed abroad for long periods. During this period, it
permanently canceled the registry of 140,000 registered Palestinians, solely because they
left the West Bank for a period of more than three years, according to data from the Office
of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli army
body in charge of administering the occupied West Bank. Authorities also during this same
period revoked the residency of 108,878 Palestinians from Gaza either for staying abroad
for more than seven years or for not being present during censuses conducted in 1981 and

16 who were born in the West Bank and Gaza, or who were born abroad if one parent was a registered resident. In 1987, with
the outbreak of the first Palestinian intifada, the military ordered that children under 16 who were born in the occupied
territory could only be registered if their mother was a resident, and that children born abroad could not be registered after
the age of five, regardless of either parent’s residency status. In 2000, authorities stopped granting entry to all unregistered
Palestinians more than five years old. Authorities in 2006 began to grant entry permits to Palestinian children for the
purpose allowing them to apply for registration, but it has refused to register children who turned 16 during the period from
2000 to 2006, when Israeli policies had made their entry and registration impossible.

Soon after its establishment, the PA in 1995 took on the task of handling requests to
update the population registry or apply for residency, but its role consists of transferring
those requests to the Israeli side for approval. 791 Since 2000, Israeli authorities have for
the most part refused to update the population registry or process applications for
residency by unregistered Palestinians, their spouses, and close relatives, even if they had
lived in the West Bank or Gaza for years and had families, homes, jobs, or other ties
there. 792 Israel entirely froze the “family reunification” process by which Palestinians
apply to grant legal status to join immediate relatives or spouses not registered in the
population registry. 793 Israeli authorities have cited the security situation following the
outbreak of the second Intifada as the rationale for the freeze, 794 but they have not
explained why their blanket refusal to process new applications is necessary for security

The freeze has remained in place since 2000, outside of processing about 35,000 family

Civil Affairs Ministry estimated that, between September 2000 and August 2005 alone, it
relayed more than 120,000 applications for family reunification that Israeli authorities did
not process. 796 The Israeli Supreme Court opted in 2019 not to force the army to end its
freeze, following a challenge by the Israeli rights group HaMoked. 797 The two-decade-old
freeze has meant that Israeli authorities have stopped registering most categories of
people, with the exception of children who had at least one registered Palestinian parent.
Israeli authorities have also systematically barred entry to Israel and the West Bank over

35,000 Palestinians from Gaza were living in the West Bank with expired permits. 800 Israeli
law considers Palestinians with expired permits as unlawful “infiltrators,” 801 and

face difficulties registering at schools or universities, doing business, or owning property.
Israel’s policies that deny Palestinians in the OPT the ability to live in or travel to the areas

inhumane acts set out in the Apartheid Convention.
East Jerusalem
Israeli policies have also denied residency rights to thousands of Palestinians in East
Jerusalem and left many without nationality. Since its annexation of East Jerusalem in
1967, it has applied its 1952 Law of Entry to Palestinians from there and designated them
as “permanent residents,” the same status afforded to a foreigner who wants to live in
Israel. Permanent residents may live, work, and receive benefits, but that status derives
from their presence, can be revoked at the Interior Ministry’s discretion, and does not
automatically pass to one’s children or non-resident spouse even if they have lived in
Jerusalem for years. 803 A path to citizenship exists for Palestinian Jerusalemite permanent
residents, but the vast majority have chosen not to pursue it, as it involves recognizing
Israel, the occupying power, as the legitimate sovereign. The vast majority of those who
applied did not receive citizenship. Authorities rejected many applicants for failing to
demonstrate that Israel, and not the West Bank, was their “center of life,” or for their

Between the start of Israel’s occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967 and the end of 2020,
Israel revoked the permanent resident status of at least 14,701 Palestinians from East
Jerusalem. 805 Authorities have justified most revocations based on a failure to prove a
“center of life” in Jerusalem, targeting those it said had been living in other parts of the
OPT outside Jerusalem’s municipal borders or who had studied or lived abroad for
extended periods of time. Others lost their residency after obtaining permanent residency
or citizenship in another country. The number of revocations has dropped since 2015 when
the Interior Ministry said it would adopt “a more lenient approach” that would maintain
the residency of Palestinian Jerusalemites who “maintain a connection” to the city.” 806
Authorities have, though, in recent years revoked status to punish Palestinians accused of
attacking Israelis and as an act of collective punishment against their relatives. 807
Each revocation often has a much wider impact, as the families of persons who lose their
status often accompany them as they leave the city, and other Palestinians have to adjust
their lives to safeguard their precarious status. Palestinians from East Jerusalem have told
Human Rights Watch that the fear of losing this status weighs on their daily life,
determining where families live and deterring them from pursuing educational and

professional opportunities abroad. 808 By pushing Palestinians to leave their home city,

Israeli law authorizes arrest and deportation for those found without legal status. Without
that status, Palestinians cannot formally work, move freely, renew driver’s licenses, or
obtain birth certificates for children, which are needed to register them in school. They
could also lose benefits under Israel’s national insurance program, which provides social
welfare benefits, such as healthcare, unemployment benefits, and support payments for
children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Those who lose their residency can
petition the Interior Ministry to recover their status, during which time they can obtain a
temporary status to remain in Jerusalem. Some Palestinians have succeeded in reinstating
their status, but only after protracted legal and administrative processes that many
cannot afford. 810
In a March 2017 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Palestinians from East Jerusalem
enjoy “special status” as “native residents” that authorities should account for in
determining their status. 811 But Israeli policy continues to fail to do that in practice.

Mass Suspension of Civil Rights (West Bank, Gaza)
Israeli authorities have deprived generations of Palestinians in the OPT of their basic civil
rights, including the rights to free assembly, association, and expression. In particular,
authorities have targeted Palestinians for their anti-occupation speech, activism, and
affiliations, jailing thousands, outlawing hundreds of political and non-government
organizations, and shutting down dozens of media outlets. 812
In the West Bank, the army continues to rely on draconian military orders issued in the
early days of the occupation to criminalize non-violent political activity. Authorities, for
example, continue to apply British Mandate-era regulations that allow them to declare

disaffection against” local authorities and to arrest Palestinians for affiliation with such
430 organizations, including the Palestine Liberation Organization that Israel signed a
peace accord with, its ruling Fatah party, and all the other major Palestinian political
parties. 814 The army prosecuted 1,704 Palestinians in the West Bank for “membership and
activity in an unlawful association” between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, according to
data it provided Human Rights Watch. 815
In addition, the army regularly uses military orders permitting it to shut down unlicensed
protests or to create closed military zones to suppress peaceful Palestinian
demonstrations in the West Bank and detain participants. 816 One military order, for
example, imposes a prison term of up to 10 years on civilians convicted by military courts
for participating in a gathering of more than 10 people without a military permit on any
issue “that could be construed as political” or for displaying “flags or political symbols”
without army approval. 817 The Israeli army said that, in the five-year period between July 1,
2014, and June 30, 2019, it prosecuted 4,590 West Bank Palestinians for entering a “closed
military zone,” 818 a designation often used for protest sites.

include “praise, sympathy or support for a hostile organization” and “attempts, orally or

While the law of occupation permits occupiers to restrict some civil and political rights
based on limited security justifications, the decades-long mass suspension of basic civil
rights for Palestinians in the OPT with no end in sight amounts to measures “calculated to
prevent” their “participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life” and create
“conditions preventing the[ir] full development” by denying them the rights to freedom of
expression, peaceful assembly, and association, specifically identified in the Apartheid
Convention. 821 When the sweeping restrictions result in unlawful arrests, they also
constitute a denial of the right of liberty by virtue of “arbitrary arrest and illegal
imprisonment” under the Apartheid Convention.

Other Abuses in Israel
Separately from the inhumane acts committed in the OPT, the Israeli government has
carried out other abuses against Palestinians within its pre-1967 borders.

Land Expropriation and Restrictions
Beginning in 1948 and in subsequent decades, Israeli authorities seized several million
dunams of land from Palestinians inside Israel. Many of the most serious abuses
described in this subsection, involving the massive confiscation of land from Palestinian
citizens of Israel, occurred between 1948 and 1966. While the plight of Palestinians in
Israel has generally improved since the lifting in 1966 of the martial law that Israeli
authorities imposed on them for the first 17 years of the country’s history, these violations
are continuing insofar as many of the victims remain unable to recover what authorities
seized from them, return to live in the villages they came from, or obtain compensation for
the losses they experienced.

A precise figure of the amount of land confiscated from Palestinians in Israel is not
available, in part as a result of the different forms of land ownership under Ottoman law
The pre-eminent historians of the era, though, largely estimate that Israeli authorities
confiscated at least 4.5 million dunams of land from Palestinians, constituting an
estimated 65 to 75 percent of all land owned by Palestinians before 1948, including 40 to
60 percent of the land belonging to Palestinians who remained and became Israeli
citizens. 823 Some historians also estimate that of the 370 Jewish towns and villages
established by the Israeli government between 1948 and 1953, 350 were built on land
confiscated from Palestinians. 824 Much of the confiscation took place between 1949 and
1966. During these years Israel subjected most Palestinians in Israel to military rule,
confined them to dozens of enclaves, and severely restricted their movement. Haaretz
reported, based on declassified government documents, that Israeli officials lifted military
rule in 1966 only after they had ensured that internally displaced Palestinians “could not
return to the villages they had fled or been expelled from.” 825
Israeli authorities used principally two mechanisms to seize land belonging to Palestinians
in Israel. First, in 1950, the Knesset, building on emergency regulations issued in
December 1948 to authorize land confiscations, passed the Absentees’ Property Law that
allowed the state to confiscate the land and homes of Palestinians not present on their
property in 1947 and 1948 amid the fighting in the events surrounding the establishment

of Israel and who had fled or were expelled to one of several neighboring or nearby Arab
countries or to “any part of Palestine outside the area of Israel,” including those places “in
of Israel or which fought against it after its establishment.” 826 Israeli authorities applied
the law to take hold of most of the land belonging to the hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees who came to reside outside of Israel, as well as land belonging to
Palestinians internally displaced as a result of the events of 1947 and 1948. Israeli
authorities placed the land under the control of the Custodian for Absentees’ Property and
eventually converted it to state land, almost exclusively used to build new Jewish
communities. 827 Israeli authorities have also used the Absentees’ Property Law to take
control of land belonging to Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem. 828
Second, the Israeli government declared many Palestinian towns and villages, particularly
those outside the enclaves that Palestinians lived in during the period of military rule, as
“closed areas.” It then passed in 1953 the Land Acquisition Law, which, building on a prior
emergency regulation, permitted the state to take ownership of land uncultivated since
1948. It also allowed the state to take over land in those cases where it did not recognize
claims of ownership filed by Palestinians, even if the land was under cultivation. The rights
group Adalah estimates that the Israeli government seized 1.2-1.3 million dunams of land
under the Land Acquisition Law. 829 The law offered compensation, but largely in the form
of “alternative plots that were either uncultivable or belonged to refugees in exile,” as one
historian wrote, or compensation based on rates so low that Israel’s then-Foreign Minister
and later Prime Minister Moshe Sharett referred to them as a “scandalous robbery.” 830

In a 2005 report, the Global IDP Project of the Norwegian Refugee Council estimated based
on a review of a range of sources that there were at the time between 150,000 and 300,000
Israel. 831 The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) found in 1998
that most of what they estimated to be around 200,000 internally displaced Palestinians,
who they refer to as “present absentees,” continue to be displaced and dispossessed within
the State because their lands were confiscated and not returned to them.” 832
Israeli authorities continue to block Palestinian citizen landowners from accessing or using
land that they confiscated from them. 833 For example, in November 1948, Israeli forces
expelled residents from the village of Iqrit, near the Lebanon border, after fighting in the
area had largely ended and soon after declaring Iqrit a closed military area. 834 Residents,
most of whom remained internally displaced inside Israel, filed a legal challenge against
their displacement and, in 1951, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that residents should be
allowed to return to their homes. 835 However, before the order could be carried out and
two months before another Supreme Court hearing on the case, the army blew up all the
houses still standing in the village. 836 Residents have continued to seek to return, but the
government has continued to block them, claiming in the 1960s, for example, that return
would constitute a security risk. 837 In 2003, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a new
petition by residents to return, determining the issue to be “political” and therefore
deferring to the government, which had determined that permitting Iqrit residents to return

Coercive Practices in the Negev Region
Israeli authorities have also in some instances used coercive practices to restrict the rights
of Palestinian citizens of Israel. They have, for example, made it virtually impossible for
tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins residing in the Negev to live lawfully in the
communities they have lived in for decades. 842 Dating back to the formulation of the
state’s first formal plans in the 1960s, authorities have refused to legally recognize 35
Bedouin communities in the Negev, forcing their 90,000 or so residents, constituting more
than 28 percent of the Bedouin population in the Negev, to live under constant threat of
demolition. 843 Israeli law considers all buildings in these unrecognized villages illegal and
authorities have refused to connect most to the national electricity or water grids or
provide basic infrastructure, such as paved roads or sewage systems. 844 The communities

Israeli authorities have razed one unrecognized village that has been embroiled in a yearslong legal battle with the state, al-Araqib, 185 times. 847 In a 2007 letter to Human Rights

Negev at that time. 848
For years, authorities have sought to concentrate Bedouins living in the Negev in
government-planned townships in order to maximize the land available for Jewish
communities. 849 Many Bedouins, though, see the development of these townships as an
effort to extinguish their land claims elsewhere in the Negev and do not view them as
acceptable residential options, given their lack of involvement in their development and
concerns about overcrowding and government neglect. 850 Those efforts continue;

Denial of Residency and Nationality
Effective Ban on Granting Status to Palestinian Spouses from the OPT
Israel’s Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003 bars Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza from residing with their spouse in Israel or East
Jerusalem. 852 The temporary order, enacted by the Knesset in July 2003, renewed every
year since and upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, prohibits with few exceptions the
granting of residency or citizenship to Palestinian ID holders, even if married to an Israeli
citizen or permanent resident. 853 While Israeli authorities already restricted family
reunification before 2003, this law has brought the process to a near halt. 854
The law denies Israeli citizens and residents, both Jewish and Palestinian, who marry
Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza the right enjoyed by other Israelis to live
with their loved ones in the place of their choosing. This denial is based on the spouse’s
ethnicity rather than on an individualized assessment of security risk. If an Israeli marries
a foreign spouse who is Jewish, the spouse can obtain citizenship automatically. Other
foreigners can receive immediate status and normally become eligible for citizenship after
living in Israel for several years. 855 Palestinian men over 35 and women over 25 from the

enter the territory they are from, even where sovereignty is contested or has changed
links to. 861 Like refugees in other contexts, Palestinian refugees should be given the
opportunity to freely decide between returning to their country of origin, local integration,
or third-country resettlement. 862 The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has registered 5.7 million Palestinian refugees. 863

Conclusion
Israeli authorities have deprived millions of people of their basic rights by virtue of their
identity as Palestinians. These longstanding policies and systematic practices box in,
dispossess, forcibly separate, marginalize, and otherwise inflict suffering on Palestinians.
In the OPT, movement restrictions, land expropriation, forcible transfer, denial of residency
and nationality, and the mass suspension of civil rights constitute “inhuman[e] acts” set
out under the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. Under both legal standards,
inhumane acts when carried out amid systematic oppression and with the intent to
maintain domination make up the crime against humanity of apartheid. 865

Collectively, these policies and practices in the OPT severely deprive Palestinians of
fundamental human rights, including to residency, private property, and access to land,
discriminatory intent, on the basis of the victims’ identity as part of a group or collectivity,
they amount to the crime against humanity of persecution under the Rome Statute and
customary international law.
Separately from the inhumane acts carried out in the OPT, the Israeli government violates
the rights of Palestinians inside Israel on account of their identity, including measures that
have made it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins living in
the Negev to live lawfully in the communities; the denial to hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians of the ability to access or use land confiscated from them historically; the
effective bar on citizens and residents obtaining long-term legal status to and thereby
living permanently together in Israel with spouses from the West Bank and Gaza, which
deprives them of the ability to live together permanently in Israel; and the denial of
residency rights to Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the events
around the establishment of the state.
These abuses continue and there is no indication that authorities have investigated, much
less held accountable, anyone involved in their commission.

These recommendations stem from Human Rights Watch’s finding that Israeli authorities
are committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.
Human Rights Watch found that the Israeli government has pursued an intent to maintain
the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians throughout the territory it controls. In
the OPT, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled with systematic
oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them. When these three
elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.
Israeli authorities are also committing the crime against humanity of persecution based on
the discriminatory intent behind Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and the grave abuses it
has carried out in the OPT.

To the State of Israel
•

Dismantle all forms of systematic oppression and discrimination that privilege
Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians and otherwise systematically violate
Palestinian rights in order to ensure the dominance of Jewish Israelis, and end the
persecution of Palestinians, including by ending discriminatory policies and
practices in such realms as citizenship and nationality processes, protection of
civil rights, freedom of movement, allocation of land and resources, access to
water, electricity, and other services, and granting of building permits.

•

Fully respect the human rights of Palestinians, including those in the OPT, as well
as the protections owed to Palestinians in the OPT under international
humanitarian law.

•

Cease construction and expansion of settlements, dismantle existing settlements,
and bring Israeli citizens inhabiting settlements in the West Bank, including East
Jerusalem, back within Israel’s internationally-recognized borders.

•

End the generalized ban on travel to and from Gaza and permit the free movement
of people to and from Gaza, and in particular between Gaza and the West Bank,

The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003, which
allows Israeli citizens and residents to obtain legal status for their non-Israeli
spouses, but not if the spouses are Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza,
who are explicitly ineligible under this law with few exceptions;

o

Provisions in the 2011 Admission Commissions Law that effectively allow
discrimination by residents of small towns inside Israel against prospective
residents on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or national origin;

o

Provisions in the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People that
discriminate between Jews and non-Jews with regard to the right to selfdetermination and to housing.

•

Remove arbitrary restrictions on residency rights for Palestinian residents of East
Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip and their families, including by
stopping the practice of revoking the residency of Palestinians in East Jerusalem,
ending the effective freeze on family reunification applications in the West Bank
and Gaza since 2000, and allowing Palestinians to resettle in other parts of the OPT
and register their new addresses.

they or their families once lived, as Human Rights Watch has outlined in a separate

Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu
Prime Minister of the State of Israel
Office of the Prime Minister
Dear Mr. Prime Minister,
I write to request your assistance in obtaining information pertaining to Israel’s treatment
of Palestinians inside Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. We would greatly appreciate the opportunity
to understand your perspectives on these issues, so they can be reflected in a forthcoming
Human Rights Watch report on them. For this to happen, we would need to receive your
responses by Monday, August 10.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) is an international human rights organization, whose head
office is located in New York City. The organization publishes reports on the state of human
rights in nearly 100 countries worldwide, with the objective of defending human rights and
promoting respect for international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch has covered
human rights issues in Israel and Palestine for nearly three decades and, in that time, has
regularly met and corresponded with Israeli officials.
Human Rights Watch’s forthcoming report examines Israeli laws, policies and practices
affecting Palestinians in Israel, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
compares them to the treatment of Jewish Israelis living in the same or nearby areas. The
report draws on years of research by Human Rights Watch and other rights organizations, a
review of laws, government planning documents, statements by officials, land records and
field work conducted for this report.
Our research has been examining whether Israeli authorities have carried out grave abuses
on a systematic basis against Palestinians, and whether these occurred in a context of a
discriminatory system or systems designed to ensure the dominance of Jewish Israelis over
Palestinians. We are examining the extent to which Israeli officials have carried out any

To better understand and reflect the perspective of the Israeli government on these issues,
we would appreciate answers to the following questions:
1. Do Israeli laws, policies and practices treat Palestinians living in Israel and in areas
under Israeli control in a manner equal to the way they treat Jewish Israelis living in
these same areas?
a. If so, what is the Israeli government’s response to claims of discrimination
against Palestinians?
b. If not, please describe all measures being taken by the Israeli government
to ensure equality.
2. Why do Israeli authorities significantly restrict travel for Palestinians between the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip? Does the government maintain a policy of
separating Gaza and the West Bank? If this policy is motivated by security
considerations, please explain how the government balances this consideration
against the right of Palestinians to freedom of movement.
3. Data from the Civil Administration obtained by Bimkom indicates that, between
2016 and 2018, Israeli authorities approved less than 1.5 percent of applications by
Palestinians to build in Area C, 21 applications in total, while issuing 2,147
demolition orders. Why does the Israeli Civil Administration reject such a high
percentage of permits for Palestinians to build in Area C of the West Bank and
demolish structures built without a permit at a rate higher than for such structures
built by Israeli settlers?
4. Data from the Civil Administration obtained by the Israeli group Peace Now in 2018
indicates that Israeli authorities have allocated 99.76% of all “state land”
allocated to third parties in the West Bank to serve the needs of Israeli settlers.
Why has so little state land been allocated for use by Palestinians in the West Bank
as compared to settlers?
5. Why do Israeli authorities continue to wield significant influence over the
Population Registry in the OPT, including in the Gaza Strip nearly 15 years after its
disengagement from Gaza? Why have authorities since September 2000 refused to

abuses pursuant to long-standing policies and practices and whether they form part of the
implementation of aims to sustain a Jewish demographic majority and maximize Jewish
Israeli control over land in Israel and the West Bank.

process applications, outside of those processed as a “gesture” to the PA between
November 2007 and March 2009, for Palestinians in the OPT to grant legal status to
those not already in the Population Registry, or even change their addresses? If the
policy is motivated by security considerations, why is it that an effectively blanket
refusal to process new applicants, as opposed to a policy of making individualized
assessments, is necessary to ensure security?
6. Why do authorities continue to revoke the residency status of Palestinian
Jerusalemites who they have determined no longer “maintain a connection” to the
city?
7. Is there a government policy to seek to maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem? If
so, why?
8. Colin Hames, the former head of Israeli government body in charge of supplying
services to neighborhoods in Jerusalem beyond the separation barrier, the
Jerusalem Envelope Administration, described the government’s “neglect” of these
areas, including Kufr Aqab. Why have authorities effectively failed to police,
regulate construction or in large part provide basic services to residents?
9. Why does the Israeli government bar with few exceptions the granting of Israeli
citizenship or long-term legal status to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
who marry Israeli citizens and residents, a restriction that does not apply to Jewish
spouses of Israeli citizens and residents? What role, if any, does demographics and
in particular any objective to foster a Jewish majority factor into the annual renewal
and the enforcement of this law and, more generally, in the formulation of Israeli
governmental policy on issues related to citizenship, nationality and residency
rights and access to and allocation of land and resources?
10. Why do Israeli authorities deny residency rights to Palestinian refugees who fled or
were expelled from their homes inside today’s Israel between 1947 and 1949, while
guaranteeing it to Jewish citizens of other countries, including those who have
never been to Israel?
11. Why have authorities refused to grant legal status to several dozen Palestinian
Bedouin communities in the Negev, making it impossible for more than 70,000
Bedouins to reside lawfully in the communities that they have lived in for decades?

The widely held assumption that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is a temporary situation and
that the “peace process” will soon bring an end to Israeli abuses has obscured the reality on the ground today
of Israel’s entrenched discriminatory rule over Palestinians. A single authority, the Israeli government, rules
primarily over the area between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea, populated by two groups of roughly
equal size, methodologically privileging Jewish Israelis while repressing Palestinians, most severely in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), made-up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.

Drawing on years of human rights documentation, case studies and a review of government planning
documents, statements by officials and other sources, A Threshold Crossed: Israeli Authorities and the Crimes
of Apartheid and Persecution examines Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and evaluates whether particular
Israeli policies and practices in certain areas amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and
persecution.

The crime of apartheid refers to inhumane acts committed in the context of systematic oppression by one racial
group over another and with the intent to dominate the marginalized group. Persecution consists of severe
abuses of fundamental rights committed with discriminatory intent.
Across Israel and the OPT, Israeli authorities have pursued an intent to maintain domination over Palestinians
by exercising control over land and demographics for the benefit of Jewish Israelis. In the OPT, the intent has
been coupled with inhumane acts, including sweeping movement restrictions, mass land confiscation and the
suspension of civil rights for millions of Palestinians, carried out amid systematic oppression.
On this basis, the report concludes that Israeli officials have committed the crimes against humanity of
apartheid and persecution.
Human Rights Watch calls on Israel to end apartheid and persecution. It also enumerates actions the
international community should take in order to achieve this end.

comment on Policy Order 109
israel_palestine0421_web_0.pdf; 202101_this_is_apartheid_eng.pdf

Dear City Clerk and members of the Cambridge City Council,
I would like to supplement my public comment at the Monday, May 24 2021 City Council Regular
Meeting in support of Policy Orders 109 and 114 with comments and documents below for the record.
Below is a statement signed by 75 Harvard faculty condemning Israeli apartheid. Attached are the
two referenced reports, one by Human Rights Watch titled "A Threshold Crossed: Israeli Authorities and the

Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution" and the other by the primary human rights organization in Israel, B'tselem, whose
report is titled "A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; this is Apartheid." These
are meticulously documented and researched reports which reach the same legal conclusion under international law.
When I traveled to Gaza in the summer of 2009, I witnessed the aftermath of indescribable destruction from Israel's
Operation Cast Lead. 1400 people massacred, $3 billion in damage to civilian targets including residential buildings and
hospitals loaded with people. Civilians were targeted, white phosphorus used on families and children. These war crimes
and crimes against humanity symptomatic of a 73 year campaign of ethnic cleansing of Palestine.
We have a moral and political duty to end all ties with governments actively engaged in the gravest crimes and human
rights violations, and all those companies which are complicit in supporting them. Palestinian civil society has urged us
to support them in standing against the crimes of persecution and apartheid.
In solidarity,
Tom Arabia

____________________
Statement by Harvard Faculty in Support of Palestinian Liberation
As US-based scholars who oppose racism and colonial violence in all its forms, we write to express
solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle for freedom and self-determination. Israeli
state violence has devastated Palestinian life through a combination of warfare, territorial theft, and
violent displacement. Unwavering US financial, military, and political support has fueled an apartheid
system that institutionalizes the domination and repression of Palestinians. The recent reports
by Human Rights Watch and the Israeli human rights organization B’tselem are only the latest to
document this reality. The current effort to expel Palestinians from Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah
neighborhood; the violence in Israeli cities like Lydda and Haifa, in which Israeli police stand by and
facilitate right-wing extremist attacks on Palestinians; and the military attack on the Gaza Strip are
only the most recent events in a decades-long process of dispossession.
Palestinians are not only denied freedom and self-determination, they are even denied the right to
resist. Palestinian resistance in all its forms is criminalized by Israel and the US. Every measure of
self-defense by a people without a state or an army against a nuclear power backed by the US is
subject to immediate censure while Israel continues its violent aggressions with impunity.

Suppression of support for Palestinian liberation extends into the US academy where even scholarly
criticism of Israeli human rights violations is increasingly equated with antisemitism and forbidden
by law. The situation in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank is far worse. Academic freedom and basic
educational rights are unavailable for students and faculty at Palestinian universities, and the rights of
Palestinians at Israeli universities are severely curtailed. The Israeli government and academic
institutions routinely punish scholars – both Jews and Palestinians – who criticize the state’s policies.
In this moment when Israeli ethnonationalist violence is at an all-time high, US military support
remains steadfast, and solidarity with Palestine is criminalized, US-based scholars cannot be silent.
We demand an end to US support for Israel’s apartheid regime, condemn Israeli state aggression, and
affirm our support for the Palestinian liberation struggle.

About 6.8 million Jewish Israelis and 6.8 million Palestinians live today between the
Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River, an area encompassing Israel and the Occupied
Palestinian Territory (OPT), the latter made up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,
and the Gaza Strip. Throughout most of this area, Israel is the sole governing power; in the
remainder, it exercises primary authority alongside limited Palestinian self-rule. Across
these areas and in most aspects of life, Israeli authorities methodically privilege Jewish
Israelis and discriminate against Palestinians. Laws, policies, and statements by leading
Israeli officials make plain that the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control over
demographics, political power, and land has long guided government policy. In pursuit of
this goal, authorities have dispossessed, confined, forcibly separated, and subjugated
Palestinians by virtue of their identity to varying degrees of intensity. In certain areas, as
described in this report, these deprivations are so severe that they amount to the crimes
against humanity of apartheid and persecution.
Several widely held assumptions, including that the occupation is temporary, that the
“peace process” will soon bring an end to Israeli abuses, that Palestinians have
meaningful control over their lives in the West Bank and Gaza, and that Israel is an
egalitarian democracy inside its borders, have obscured the reality of Israel’s entrenched
discriminatory rule over Palestinians. Israel has maintained military rule over some portion
of the Palestinian population for all but six months of its 73-year history. It did so over the
vast majority of Palestinians inside Israel from 1948 and until 1966. From 1967 until the
present, it has militarily ruled over Palestinians in the OPT, excluding East Jerusalem. By
contrast, it has since its founding governed all Jewish Israelis, including settlers in the OPT
since the beginning of the occupation in 1967, under its more rights-respecting civil law.
For the past 54 years, Israeli authorities have facilitated the transfer of Jewish Israelis to
the OPT and granted them a superior status under the law as compared to Palestinians
living in the same territory when it comes to civil rights, access to land, and freedom to
move, build, and confer residency rights to close relatives. While Palestinians have a
limited degree of self-rule in parts of the OPT, Israel retains primary control over borders,

population, which in turn dictates such matters as legal status and eligibility to receive

A number of Israeli officials have stated clearly their intent to maintain this control in
perpetuity and backed it up through their actions, including continued settlement
expansion over the course of the decades-long “peace process.” Unilateral annexation of
additional parts of the West Bank, which the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has vowed to carry out, would formalize the reality of systematic Israeli
domination and oppression that has long prevailed without changing the reality that the
entire West Bank is occupied territory under the international law of occupation, including
East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967.
International criminal law has developed two crimes against humanity for situations of
systematic discrimination and repression: apartheid and persecution. Crimes against
humanity stand among the most odious crimes in international law.
The international community has over the years detached the term apartheid from its original
South African context, developed a universal legal prohibition against its practice, and
recognized it as a crime against humanity with definitions provided in the 1973 International
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (“Apartheid
Convention”) and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The crime against humanity of persecution, also set out in the Rome Statute, the
intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights on racial, ethnic, and other
grounds, grew out of the post-World War II trials and constitutes one of the most serious
international crimes, of the same gravity as apartheid.
The State of Palestine is a state party to both the Rome Statute and the Apartheid
Convention. In February 2021, the ICC ruled that it has jurisdiction over serious
international crimes committed in the entirety of the OPT, including East Jerusalem, which
would include the crimes against humanity of apartheid or persecution committed in that
territory. In March 2021, the ICC Office of Prosecutor announced the opening of a formal
investigation into the situation in Palestine.

The term apartheid has increasingly been used in relation to Israel and the OPT, but
usually in a descriptive or comparative, non-legal sense, and often to warn that the
European officials, prominent media commentators, and others have asserted that, if
Israel’s policies and practices towards Palestinians continued along the same trajectory,
the situation, at least in the West Bank, would become tantamount to apartheid. 1 Some
have claimed that the current reality amounts to apartheid. 2 Few, however, have

conducted a detailed legal analysis based on the international crimes of apartheid

In this report, Human Rights Watch examines the extent to which that threshold has
already been crossed in certain of the areas where Israeli authorities exercise control.

Definitions of Apartheid and Persecution
The prohibition of institutionalized discrimination, especially on grounds of race or
ethnicity, constitutes one of the fundamental elements of international law. Most states
have agreed to treat the worst forms of such discrimination, that is, persecution and
apartheid, as crimes against humanity, and have given the ICC the power to prosecute
these crimes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to pursue them. Crimes
against humanity consist of specific criminal acts committed as part of a widespread or
systematic attack, or acts committed pursuant to a state or organizational policy, directed
against a civilian population.
The Apartheid Convention defines the crime against humanity of apartheid as “inhuman
acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial
group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing
them.” The Rome Statute of the ICC adopts a similar definition: “inhumane acts…
committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and
domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with
the intention of maintaining that regime.” The Rome Statute does not further define what
constitutes an “institutionalized regime.”
The crime of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute consists of three
primary elements: an intent to maintain a system of domination by one racial group over

another; systematic oppression by one racial group over another; and one or more

inhumane acts, as defined, carried out on a widespread or systematic basis pursuant to

Among the inhumane acts identified in either the Convention or the Rome Statute are
“forcible transfer,” “expropriation of landed property,” “creation of separate reserves and
ghettos,” and denial of the “the right to leave and to return to their country, [and] the right
to a nationality.”
The Rome Statute identifies the crime against humanity of persecution as “the intentional
and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the
identity of the group or collectivity,” including on racial, national, or ethnic grounds.
Customary international law identifies the crime of persecution as consisting of two
primary elements: (1) severe abuses of fundamental rights committed on a widespread or
systematic basis, and (2) with discriminatory intent.
Few courts have heard cases involving the crime of persecution and none the crime of
apartheid, resulting in a lack of case law around the meanings of key terms in their
definitions. As described in the report, international criminal courts have over the last
two decades evaluated group identity based on the context and construction by local
actors, as opposed to earlier approaches focused on hereditary physical traits. In
international human rights law, including the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), race and racial discrimination
have been broadly interpreted to include distinctions based on descent, and national or
ethnic origin, among other categories.

Application to Israel’s Policies towards Palestinians
Two primary groups live today in Israel and the OPT: Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. One
primary sovereign, the Israeli government, rules over them.

Intent to Maintain Domination
A stated aim of the Israeli government is to ensure that Jewish Israelis maintain

those policies.

domination across Israel and the OPT. The Knesset in 2018 passed a law with
constitutional status affirming Israel as the “nation-state of the Jewish people,” declaring

that within that territory, the right to self-determination “is unique to the Jewish people,”
and establishing “Jewish settlement” as a national value. To sustain Jewish Israeli control,
described as a demographic “threat” that Palestinians pose. Those policies include
limiting the population and political power of Palestinians, granting the right to vote only
to Palestinians who live within the borders of Israel as they existed from 1948 to June 1967,
and limiting the ability of Palestinians to move to Israel from the OPT and from anywhere
else to Israel or the OPT. Other steps are taken to ensure Jewish domination, including a
state policy of “separation” of Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza, which
prevents the movement of people and goods within the OPT, and “Judaization” of areas
with significant Palestinian populations, including Jerusalem as well as the Galilee and the
Negev in Israel. This policy, which aims to maximize Jewish Israeli control over land,
concentrates the majority of Palestinians who live outside Israel’s major, predominantly
Jewish cities into dense, under-served enclaves and restricts their access to land and
housing, while nurturing the growth of nearby Jewish communities.

Systematic Oppression and Institutional Discrimination
To implement the goal of domination, the Israeli government institutionally discriminates
against Palestinians. The intensity of that discrimination varies according to different rules
established by the Israeli government in Israel, on the one hand, and different parts of the
OPT, on the other, where the most severe form takes place.
In the OPT, which Israel has recognized as a single territory encompassing the West Bank
and Gaza, Israeli authorities treat Palestinians separately and unequally as compared to
Jewish Israeli settlers. In the occupied West Bank, Israel subjects Palestinians to draconian
military law and enforces segregation, largely prohibiting Palestinians from entering
settlements. In the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel imposes a generalized closure, sharply
restricting the movement of people and goods—policies that Gaza’s other neighbor, Egypt,
often does little to alleviate. In annexed East Jerusalem, which Israel considers part of its
sovereign territory but remains occupied territory under international law, Israel provides
the vast majority of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living there with a legal
status that weakens their residency rights by conditioning them on the individual’s
connections to the city, among other factors. This level of discrimination amounts to

systematic oppression.

4.33.c

In Israel, which the vast majority of nations consider being the area defined by its pre-1967
borders, the two tiered-citizenship structure and bifurcation of nationality and citizenship
Palestinians in Israel, unlike those in the OPT, have the right to vote and stand for Israeli
elections, these rights do not empower them to overcome the institutional discrimination
they face from the same Israeli government, including widespread restrictions on
accessing land confiscated from them, home demolitions, and effective prohibitions on
family reunification.
The fragmentation of the Palestinian population, in part deliberately engineered through
Israeli restrictions on movement and residency, furthers the goal of domination and helps
obscure the reality of the same Israeli government repressing the same Palestinian
population group, to varying degrees in different areas, for the benefit of the same Jewish
Israeli dominant group.

Inhumane Acts and Other Abuses of Fundamental Rights
Pursuant to these policies, Israeli authorities have carried out a range of inhumane acts in
the OPT. Those include sweeping restrictions on the movement of 4.7 million Palestinians
there; the confiscation of much of their land; the imposition of harsh conditions, including
categorical denial of building permits in large parts of the West Bank, which has led
thousands of Palestinians to leave their homes under conditions that amount to forcible
transfer; the denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their
relatives, largely for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods
during the first few decades of the occupation, or as a result of the effective freeze on
family reunification over the last two decades; and the suspension of basic civil rights,
such as freedom of assembly and association, depriving Palestinians of the opportunity to
have a voice in a wide range of affairs that most affect their daily lives and futures. Many of
these abuses, including categorical denials of building permits, mass residency
revocations or restrictions, and large-scale land confiscations, have no legitimate security
justifications; others, such as the extent of restrictions on movement and civil rights, fail
any reasonable balancing test between security concerns and the severity of the
underlying rights abuse.

Since the founding of the state of Israel, the government also has systematically
discriminated against and violated the rights of Palestinians inside the state’s pre-1967
borders, including by refusing to allow Palestinians access to the millions of dunams of

land (1000 dunams equals 100 hectares, about 250 acres or 1 square kilometer) that were
confiscated from them. In one region—the Negev—these policies make it virtually
impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinians to live lawfully in the communities they
have lived in for decades. In addition, Israeli authorities refuse to permit the more than
700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948, and their descendants, to return
to Israel or the OPT, and impose blanket restrictions on legal residency, which block many
Palestinian spouses and families from living together in Israel.

Report Findings
This report examines Israeli policies and practices towards Palestinians in the OPT and
Israel and compares them to the treatment of Jewish Israelis living in the same territories.
It is not an exhaustive evaluation of all types of international human rights and
humanitarian law violations. Rather, it surveys consequential Israeli government practices
and policies that violate the basic rights of Palestinians and whose purpose is to ensure
the domination of Jewish Israelis, and assesses them against the definitions of the crimes
against humanity of apartheid and persecution.
The report draws on years of research and documentation by Human Rights Watch and
other rights organizations, including fieldwork conducted for this report. Human Rights
Watch also reviewed Israeli laws, government planning documents, statements by
officials, and land records. This evidentiary record was then analyzed under the legal
standards for the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Human Rights Watch also wrote in
July 2020 to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, soliciting the government’s
perspectives on the issues covered, but, as of publication, had not received a response.
The report does not set out to compare Israel with South Africa under apartheid or to
determine whether Israel is an “apartheid state”—a concept that is not defined in
international law. Rather, the report assesses whether specific acts and policies carried
out by Israeli authorities today amount in particular areas to the crimes of apartheid and
persecution as defined under international law.

Each of the report’s three main substantive chapters explores Israel’s rule over
Palestinians: the dynamics of its rule and discrimination, looking in turn at Israel and the
motivate these policies. It does so in terms of the primary elements of the crimes of
apartheid and persecution, as outlined above. Human Rights Watch evaluates the
dynamics of Israeli rule in each of these areas, keeping in mind the different legal
frameworks that apply in the OPT and Israel, which are the two legally recognized territorial
entities, each with a different status under international law. While noting significant
factual differences among subregions in each of these two territories, the report does not
make separate subregional determinations.
On the basis of its research, Human Rights Watch concludes that the Israeli government has
demonstrated an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians
across Israel and the OPT. In the OPT, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled
with systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them.
When these three elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.
Israeli officials have also committed the crime against humanity of persecution. This
finding is based on the discriminatory intent behind Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and
the grave abuses carried out in the OPT that include the widespread confiscation of
privately owned land, the effective prohibition on building or living in many areas, the
mass denial of residency rights, and sweeping, decades-long restrictions on the freedom
of movement and basic civil rights. Such policies and practices intentionally and severely
deprive millions of Palestinians of key fundamental rights, including to residency, private
property, and access to land, services, and resources, on a widespread and systematic
basis by virtue of their identity as Palestinians.

Seeking Maximal Land with Minimal Palestinians
Israeli policy has sought to engineer and maximize the number of Jews, as well as the land
available to them, in Israel and the portions of the OPT coveted by the Israeli government
for Jewish settlement. At the same time, by restricting the residency rights of Palestinians,
Israeli policy seeks to minimize the number of Palestinians and the land available to them
in those areas. The level of repression is most severe in the OPT, although often less

In the West Bank, authorities have confiscated more than 2 million dunams of land from
Palestinians, making up more than one-third of the West Bank, including tens of
thousands of dunams that they acknowledge are privately owned by Palestinians. One
common tactic they have used is to declare territory, including privately-owned
Palestinian land, as “state land.” The Israeli group Peace Now estimates that the Israeli
government has designated about 1.4 million dunams of land, or about a quarter of the
West Bank, as state land. The group has also found that more than 30 percent of the land
used for settlements is acknowledged by the Israeli government as having been privately
owned by Palestinians. Of the more than 675,000 dunams of state land that Israeli
authorities have allocated for use by third parties in the West Bank, they have earmarked
more than 99 percent for use by Israeli civilians, according to government data. Land
grabs for settlements and the infrastructure that primarily serves settlers effectively
concentrate Palestinians in the West Bank, according to B’Tselem, into “165 non-

Israeli authorities have also made it virtually impossible in practice for Palestinians in Area
C, the roughly 60 percent of the West Bank that the Oslo Accords placed under full Israeli
example, authorities approved less than 1.5 percent of applications by Palestinians to
build between 2016 and 2018—21 in total—a figure 100 times smaller than the number of
demolition orders it issued in the same period, according to official data. Israeli
authorities have razed thousands of Palestinian properties in these areas for lacking a
permit, leaving thousands of families displaced. By contrast, according to Peace Now,
Israeli authorities began construction on more than 23,696 housing units between 2009
and 2020 in Israeli settlements in Area C. Transfer of an occupying power’s civilian
population to an occupied territory violates the Fourth Geneva Convention.
These policies grow out of longstanding Israeli government plans. For example, the 1980
Drobles Plan, which guided the government’s settlement policy in the West Bank at the
time and built on prior plans, called for authorities to “settle the land between the [Arab]
minority population centers and their surroundings,” noting that doing so would make it
“hard for Palestinians to create territorial contiguity and political unity” and “remove any
trace of doubt about our intention to control Judea and Samaria forever.”
In Jerusalem, the government’s plan for the municipality, including both the west and
occupied east of the city, sets the goal of “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city”
and a target demographic “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arabs”—later adjusted to a 60:40
ratio after authorities acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the
demographic trend.”
The Israeli government has also carried out discriminatory seizures of land inside Israel.
Authorities have seized through different mechanisms at least 4.5 million dunams of land
from Palestinians, according to historians, constituting 65 to 75 percent of all land owned
by Palestinians before 1948 and 40 to 60 percent of the land that belonged to Palestinians
who remained after 1948 and became citizens of Israel. Authorities in the early years of the
state declared land belonging to displaced Palestinians as “absentee property” or “closed
military zones,” then took it over, converted it to state land, and built Jewish communities
there. Authorities continue to block Palestinian citizen landowners from accessing land

majority” and that state lands, which constitute 93 percent of all land in Israel, effectively
serve the objective of “Jewish settlement.” Since 1948, the government has authorized the
government-planned townships and villages for Palestinians, created largely to
concentrate previously displaced Bedouin communities living in the Negev.
Land confiscations and other discriminatory land policies in Israel hem in Palestinian
municipalities inside Israel, denying them opportunities for natural expansion enjoyed by
Jewish municipalities. The vast majority of Palestinian citizens, who make up around 19
percent of the Israeli population, live in these municipalities, which have an estimated
jurisdiction over less than 3 percent of all land in Israel. While Palestinians in Israel can
move freely, and some live in “mixed cities,” such as Haifa, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and Acre, Israeli
law permits small towns to exclude prospective residents based on their asserted
incompatibility with the town’s “social-cultural fabric.” According to a study by a professor
at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, there are more than 900 small Jewish
towns, including kibbutzim, across Israel that can restrict who lives there. None of them
have any Palestinians living among them.
In the Negev in Israel, Israeli authorities have refused to legally recognize 35 Palestinian
Bedouin communities, making it impossible for their 90,000 or so residents to live
lawfully in the communities they have lived in for decades. Instead, authorities have
sought to concentrate Bedouin communities in larger recognized townships in order, as
expressed in governmental plans and statements by officials, to maximize the land
available for Jewish communities. Israeli law considers all buildings in these unrecognized
villages to be illegal, and authorities have refused to connect most to the national
electricity or water grids or to provide even basic infrastructure such as paved roads or
sewage systems. The communities do not appear on official maps, most have no
educational facilities, and residents live under constant threat of having their homes
demolished. Israeli authorities demolished more than 10,000 Bedouin homes in the Negev
between 2013 and 2019, according to government data. They razed one unrecognized
village that challenged the expropriation of its lands, al-Araqib, 185 times.
Authorities have implemented these policies pursuant to government plans since the early

years of the state that called for restricting Bedouin communities in order to secure land
suitable for settling Jews. Several months before becoming prime minister in December

2000, Ariel Sharon declared that Bedouins in the Negev “are gnawing at the country’s land
reserves,” which he described as “a demographic phenomenon.” As prime minister,
Jewish population in the Negev and Galilee regions of Israel, areas that have significant
Palestinian populations. His deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres, later described the plan
as a “battle for the future for the Jewish people.”
Sharon’s push to Judaize the Negev, as well as the Galilee, developed against the
backdrop of the government’s decision to withdraw Jewish settlers from Gaza. After ending
Jewish settlement there, Israel began to treat Gaza effectively as a territorial jurisdiction
whose population it could consider as outside the demographic calculus of Jews and
Palestinians who live in Israel and in the vast majority of the OPT—the West Bank including
East Jerusalem—that Israel intends to retain. Israeli officials at the time acknowledged the
demographic objectives behind the move. Amid the push to withdraw settlers from Gaza,
Sharon said in an August 2005 address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot be held onto forever. Over
one million Palestinians live there and they double their numbers with every generation.”
Peres said the same month, “We are disengaging from Gaza because of demography.”
Despite withdrawing its settlers and ground troops, Israel has remained in critical ways the
supreme power in Gaza, dominating through other means and hence maintaining its legal
obligations as an occupying power, as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
and the United Nations (UN), among others, have determined. Most significantly, Israel
bans Palestinians living there (with only narrow exceptions) from leaving through the Erez
Passenger Crossing it controls and instituted a formal “policy of separation” between Gaza
and the West Bank, despite Israel having recognized within the framework of the Oslo
Accords these two parts of the OPT as collectively forming a “single territorial unit.” The
generalized travel ban, which has remained in place since 2007 and reduced travel out of
Gaza to a fraction of what it was two decades ago, is not based on an individualized
security assessment and fails any reasonable test of balancing security concerns against
the right to freedom of movement for over two million people.
Authorities have also sharply restricted the entry and exit of goods to and from Gaza,
which, alongside Egypt often shutting its border, effectively seals it off from the outside

Attachment: israel_palestine0421_web_0 (COM 298 #2021 : A communication was received from Tom Arabia)

Sharon went on to pursue a multi-billion-dollar plan that transparently sought to boost the

world. These restrictions have contributed to limiting access to basic services, devastating
the economy, and making 80 percent of the population reliant on humanitarian aid.

Families in Gaza in recent years have had to make do without centrally provided electricity
for between 12 and 20 hours per day, depending on the period. Water is also critically
human consumption.”
Within the West Bank as well, Israeli authorities prohibit Palestinian ID holders from
entering areas such as East Jerusalem, lands beyond the separation barrier, and areas
controlled by settlements and the army, unless they secure difficult-to-obtain permits.
They have also erected nearly 600 permanent obstacles, many between Palestinian
communities, that disrupt daily life for Palestinians. In sharp contrast, Israeli authorities
allow Jewish settlers in the West Bank to move freely within the majority of the West Bank
under its exclusive control, as well as to and from Israel, on roads built to facilitate their
commutes and integrate them into every facet of Israeli life.
Demographic considerations factor centrally in Israel’s separation policy between Gaza
and the West Bank. In particular, in the rare cases when they allow movement between the
two parts of the OPT, Israeli authorities permit it predominantly in the direction of Gaza,
thereby facilitating population flow away from the area where Israel actively promotes
Jewish settlement. The Israeli army’s official policy states that while a West Bank resident
can apply “for permanent resettlement in the Gaza Strip for any purpose that is considered
humanitarian (usually family reunification),” Gaza residents can settle in the West Bank
only “in the rarest cases,” usually related to family reunification. In these cases,
authorities are mandated to aim to resettle the couple in Gaza. Official data shows that
Israel did not approve a single Gaza resident to resettle in the West Bank, outside of a
handful who filed Supreme Court petitions between 2009 and March 2017, while
permitting several dozen West Bank residents to relocate to Gaza on the condition that
they sign a pledge not to return to the West Bank.
Beyond the closure policy, Israeli authorities have often used oppressive and
indiscriminate means during hostilities and protests in Gaza. Since 2008, the Israeli army
has launched three large-scale military offensives in Gaza in the context of hostilities with
armed Palestinian groups. As described in the report, those offensives have included
apparently deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and killed well over

scarce; the UN considers more than 96 percent of the water supply in Gaza “unfit for

2,000 civilians. In addition, Israeli forces have regularly fired on Palestinian demonstrators
and others who have approached fences separating Gaza and Israel in circumstances

when they did not pose an imminent threat to life, killing 214 demonstrators in 2018 and
2019 alone and maiming thousands. These practices stem from a decades-long pattern of
great cost to civilians. Despite the frequency of such incidents over the years, Israeli
authorities have failed to develop law enforcement tactics that comport with international
human rights norms.

Discriminatory Restrictions on Residency and Nationality
Palestinians face discriminatory restrictions on their rights to residency and nationality to
varying degrees in the OPT and Israel. Israeli authorities have used their control over the
population registry in the West Bank and Gaza—the list of Palestinians they consider
lawful residents for purposes of issuing legal status and identity cards—to deny residency
to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Israeli authorities refused to register at least
270,000 Palestinians who were outside the West Bank and Gaza when the occupation
began in 1967 and revoked the residency of nearly 250,000, mostly for being abroad for
too long between 1967 and 1994. Since 2000, Israeli authorities have largely refused to
process family reunification applications or requests for address changes by Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza. The freeze effectively bars Palestinians from acquiring legal
status for spouses or relatives not already registered and makes illegal, according to the
Israeli army, the presence in the West Bank of thousands of Gaza residents who arrived on
temporary permits and now live there, since they effectively cannot change their address
to one in the West Bank. These restrictions have the effect of limiting the Palestinian
population in the West Bank.
Authorities regularly deny entry into the West Bank to non-registered Palestinians who had
lived in the West Bank but left temporarily (to study, work, marry, or for other reasons) and
to their non-registered spouses and other family members.
When Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, it applied its 1952 Law of Entry to
Palestinians who lived there and designated them as “permanent residents,” the same
status afforded to a non-Jewish foreigner who moves to Israel. The Interior Ministry has
revoked this status from at least 14,701 Palestinians since 1967, mostly for failing to prove
a “center of life” in the city. A path to Israeli citizenship exists, but few apply and most who

including settlers in East Jerusalem, are citizens who do not have to prove connections to

Inside Israel, Israel’s Proclamation of Independence affirms the “complete equality” of all
residents, but a two-track citizenship structure contradicts that vow and effectively regards
Jews and Palestinians separately and unequally. Israel’s 1952 Citizenship Law contains a
separate track exclusively for Jews to obtain automatic citizenship. That law grows out of
the 1950 Law of Return which guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to
settle in Israel. By contrast, the track for Palestinians conditions citizenship on proving
residency before 1948 in the territory that became Israel, inclusion in the population
registry as of 1952, and a continuous presence in Israel or legal entry in the period between
1948 and 1952. Authorities have used this language to deny residency rights to the more
than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948 and their descendants, who
today number more than 5.7 million. This law creates a reality where a Jewish citizen of any
other country who has never been to Israel can move there and automatically gain
citizenship, while a Palestinian expelled from his home and languishing for more than 70
years in a refugee camp in a nearby country, cannot.
The 1952 Citizenship Law also authorizes granting citizenship based on naturalization.
However, in 2003, the Knesset passed the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary
Order), which bars granting Israeli citizenship or long-term legal status to Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents. With few exceptions,
this law, renewed every year since and upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, denies both
Jewish and Palestinian citizens and residents of Israel who choose to marry Palestinians
the right to live with their partner in Israel. This restriction, based solely on the spouse’s
identity as a Palestinian from the West Bank or Gaza, notably does not apply when Israelis
marry non-Jewish spouses of most other foreign nationalities. They can receive immediate
status and, after several years, apply for citizenship.
Commenting on a 2005 renewal of the law, the prime minister at the time, Ariel Sharon,
said: “There’s no need to hide behind security arguments. There’s a need for the existence
of a Jewish state.” Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then the finance minister, said during
discussions at the time: “Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want to get

International human rights law gives broad latitude to governments in setting their
immigration policies. There is nothing in international law to bar Israel from promoting
Jewish immigration. Jewish Israelis, many of whom historically migrated to Mandatory
Palestine or later to Israel to escape anti-Semitic persecution in different parts of the
world, are entitled to protection of their safety and fundamental rights. However, that
latitude does not give a state the prerogative to discriminate against people who already
live in that country, including with respect to rights concerning family reunification, and
against people who have a right to return to the country. Palestinians are also entitled to
protection of their safety and fundamental rights.

Israeli Justifications of Policies and Practices
Israeli authorities justify many of the policies documented in this report as responses to
Palestinian anti-Israeli violence. Many policies, though, like the denial of building permits
in Area C, East Jerusalem, and the Negev in Israel, residency revocations for Jerusalemites,
or expropriation of privately owned land and discriminatory allocation of state lands, have
no legitimate security justification. Others, including the Citizenship and Entry into Israel
Law and freeze of the OPT population registry, use security as a pretext to advance
demographic objectives.
Israeli authorities do face legitimate security challenges in Israel and the OPT. However,
restrictions that do not seek to balance human rights such as freedom of movement
against legitimate security concerns by, for example, conducting individualized security
assessments rather than barring the entire population of Gaza from leaving with only rare
exceptions, go far beyond what international law permits. Even where security forms part
of the motivation behind a particular policy, that does not give Israel a carte blanche to
violate human rights en masse. Legitimate security concerns can be present among
policies that amount to apartheid, just as they can be present in a policy that sanctions the
use of excessive force or torture.
Officials sometimes claim that measures taken in the OPT are temporary and would be

the Labor Party, declaring in July 1967 that “I see only a quasi-independent region [for
Palestinians], because the security and land are in Israeli hands,” to Netanyahu of the
entire territory, up to the Jordan [River],” a range of officials have made clear their intent to
maintain overriding control over the West Bank in perpetuity, regardless of what
arrangements are in place to govern Palestinians. Their actions and policies further dispel
the notion that Israeli authorities consider the occupation temporary, including the
continuing of land confiscation, the building of the separation barrier in a way that
accommodated anticipated growth of settlements, the seamless integration of the
settlements’ sewage system, communication networks, electrical grids, water
infrastructure and a matrix of roads with Israel proper, as well as a growing body of laws
applicable to West Bank Israeli settlers but not Palestinians. The possibility that a future
Israeli leader might forge a deal with Palestinians that dismantles the discriminatory
system and ends systematic repression does not negate the intent of current officials to
maintain the current system, nor the current reality of apartheid and persecution.

Recommendations
The Israeli government should dismantle all forms of systematic domination and
oppression that privilege Jewish Israelis and systematically repress Palestinians, and end
the persecution of Palestinians. In particular, authorities should end discriminatory
policies and practices with regards to citizenship and residency rights, civil rights, freedom
of movement, allocation of land and resources, access to water, electricity, and other
services, and granting of building permits.
The findings that the crimes of apartheid and persecution are being committed do not deny
the reality of Israeli occupation or erase Israel’s obligations under the law of occupation,
any more than would a finding that other crimes against humanity or war crimes have been
carried out. As such, Israeli authorities should cease building settlements and dismantle
existing ones and otherwise provide Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza with full
respect of their human rights, using as a benchmark the rights that it grants Israeli
citizens, as well as the protections that international humanitarian law grants them.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) should end forms of security coordination with the Israeli army

The finding of crimes against humanity should prompt the international community to
reevaluate its approach to Israel and Palestine. The US, which for decades has largely
in some instances in recent years signaled its support for serious abuses such as the
building of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Many European and other states have
built close ties with Israel, while supporting the “peace process,” building the capacity of
the PA, and distancing themselves from and sometimes criticizing specific abusive Israeli
practices in the OPT. This approach, which overlooks the deeply entrenched nature of
Israeli discrimination and repression of Palestinians there, minimizes serious human
rights abuses by treating them as temporary symptoms of the occupation that the “peace
process” will soon cure. It has enabled states to resist the sort of accountability that a
situation of this gravity warrants, allowing apartheid to metastasize and consolidate. After
54 years, states should stop assessing the situation through the prism of what might
happen should the languishing peace process one day be revived and focus instead on the
longstanding reality on the ground that shows no signs of abating.
Crimes against humanity can serve as the basis for individual criminal liability in
international fora, as well as in domestic courts outside of Israel and the OPT under the
principle of universal jurisdiction.
In light of the decades-long failure by Israeli authorities to rein in serious abuses, the
International Criminal Court’s Office of the Prosecutor should investigate and prosecute
individuals credibly implicated in the crimes against humanity of apartheid or
persecution. The ICC has jurisdiction over, and the prosecutor has opened an investigation
into, serious crimes committed in the OPT. In addition, all governments should investigate
and prosecute those credibly implicated in these crimes, under the principle of universal
jurisdiction and in accordance with national laws.
Beyond criminality, Human Rights Watch calls on states to establish through the UN an
international commission of inquiry to investigate systematic discrimination and
repression based on group identity in the OPT and Israel. The inquiry should be mandated
to establish and analyze the facts; identify those responsible for serious crimes, including
apartheid and persecution, with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators are held

States should also establish through the UN a position of UN global envoy for the crimes of
persecution and apartheid with a mandate to mobilize international action to end
persecution and apartheid worldwide.
States should issue statements expressing concern about Israel’s practice of apartheid
and persecution. They should vet agreements, cooperation schemes, and all forms of trade
and dealing with Israel to screen for those directly contributing to the commission of the
crimes of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians, mitigate the human rights
impacts, and, where not possible, end the activities and funding found to facilitate these
serious crimes.
The implications of the findings of this report for businesses are complex and beyond the
scope of this report. At a minimum, businesses should cease activities that directly
contribute to the commission of the crimes of apartheid and persecution. Companies should
assess whether their goods or services contribute to the commission of the crimes of
apartheid and persecution, such as equipment used in the unlawful demolition of
Palestinian homes, and cease providing goods and services that will likely be used for such
purposes, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
States should impose individual sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes,
against officials and individuals responsible for the continued commission of these
serious crimes and condition arms sales and military and security assistance to Israel on
Israeli authorities taking concrete and verifiable steps towards ending their commission of
the crimes of apartheid and persecution.
The international community has for too long explained away and turned a blind eye to the
increasingly transparent reality on the ground. Every day a person is born in Gaza into an
open-air prison, in the West Bank without civil rights, in Israel with an inferior status by law,
and in neighboring countries effectively condemned to lifelong refugee status, like their
parents and grandparents before them, solely because they are Palestinian and not Jewish. A

This report focuses on Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory (OPT) and in Israel. It is not a comprehensive examination of all repressive
policies, practices, and other facets of institutional discrimination. It also does not
account for all human rights abuses in these areas, including rights abuses committed by
Palestinian authorities or armed groups, which Human Rights Watch has covered
extensively elsewhere. 4 Rather, it examines discriminatory policies, laws, and regulations
that privilege Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians.
While the report evaluates whether specific Israeli policies and practices amount to the
crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution, it does not delve into the potential
criminal liability of particular Israeli officials.
This report is based primarily on years of documentation carried out by Human Rights
Watch, as well as by Israeli, Palestinian, and international human rights groups. Human
Rights Watch also reviewed Israeli laws, government planning documents, statements by
officials, land records, and legal standards governing the crimes of apartheid and
persecution. The report includes several case studies, based on 40 interviews with
affected persons, current and former officials, lawyers, and NGO representatives, as well
as on-site visits, all conducted by Human Rights Watch in 2019 and 2020. Some interviews
took place at locations in the OPT and Israel, but, in part due to movement restrictions
imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, many were conducted by phone.
Human Rights Watch conducted most of the interviews that are included in this report
individually, in Arabic or English. We conducted them with the consent of those being
interviewed and told each of the interviewees how Human Rights Watch would use the
information provided.

More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes and more than 400
Palestinian villages were destroyed in events around the establishment of the Israeli state
in 1948. 5 Between 1949 and 1966, Israeli authorities placed most of the Palestinians who
remained within the borders of the new state under military rule, confining them to dozens
of enclaves, requiring them to obtain permits to leave their enclaves, and severely
restricting their rights. 6
In June 1967, Israel seized control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan
and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, which make up the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), as
well as the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, following an
armed conflict known as the Six-Day War.
Israeli authorities have since retained control over the OPT. In the occupied West Bank, the
Israeli army has militarily ruled over Palestinians living there, except in East Jerusalem,
which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967. Annexation does not change East Jerusalem’s
status as occupied territory under international law. Throughout the West Bank, Israel has
facilitated the building of Israeli-only settlements. The Fourth Geneva Convention, which
applies to military occupations, prohibits the transfer of an occupying power’s civilian

Israel also unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, though it also remains an
occupied territory under international law. Israel ended its occupation of the Sinai
Peninsula as a result of the 1978 Camp David Accords with Egypt.
In 1993 and 1995, the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
signed the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian Authority (PA) to manage some
Palestinian affairs in parts of the OPT for a transitional period, not exceeding five years,
until the parties forged a permanent status agreement. 8 The Oslo Accords, supplemented
by later agreements, divided the West Bank largely into three distinct regions: Area A,
where the PA would manage full security and civil affairs, Area B, where the PA would
manage civil affairs and Israel would have security control, and Area C, under the exclusive
control of Israel. Area A largely incorporates the major Palestinian city centers, Area B the
majority of towns and many villages, and Area C the remaining 60 percent of the West
Bank. 9 The Oslo Accords, though, did not end the occupation in any part of the OPT.
The parties did not reach a final status agreement by 2000 and have not in the two
decades since, despite off and on negotiations primarily mediated by the US. The West
Bank remains primarily divided between Areas A, B, and C, with Israel retaining overall
principal control and the PA managing some affairs in Areas A and B. In Gaza, Hamas has
effectively governed since seizing control in June 2007 following months of clashes
between the Palestinian political parties Fatah and Hamas and more than a year of
political uncertainty after Hamas won a plurality of seats in PA elections. 10 In January

2020, the Trump Administration presented its “Peace to Prosperity” plan, which envisions
permanent Israeli domination over the entire territory and formal annexation of
state, but sets conditions that make its realization nearly impossible.
The decades-long “peace process” has neither significantly improved the human rights
situation on the ground nor altered the reality of overall Israeli control across Israel and the
OPT. Instead, the peace process is regularly cited to oppose efforts for rights-based
international action or accountability, 12 and as cover for Israel’s entrenched discriminatory
rule over Palestinians in the OPT. 13
In recent years, Israeli officials have vowed to unilaterally annex additional parts of the
West Bank, 14 and the coalition agreement that led to the formation of an Israeli
government in May 2020 established a process to bring annexation for governmental
approval. 15 In August, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel would delay the move
following an agreement with the United Arab Emirates, but noted that “there is no change
to my plan to extend sovereignty” over the West Bank. 16 Annexation would not change the
reality of Israeli occupation or the protections due to Palestinians as an occupied
population under international humanitarian law.

Although the mechanics and intensity of the abuses differ between the OPT and Israel, the
same power, the government of the state of Israel, has primary control across both. That
(Israeli civil law) and, to ensure their domination, structurally discriminates against
Palestinians and represses them to varying degrees across different areas on issues such
as security of legal status and access to land and resources, as the report documents.
Across Israel and the OPT, Israel grants Jewish Israelis privileges denied to Palestinians
and deprives Palestinians of fundamental rights on account of their being Palestinian.
While the role of different Israeli state entities varies in different parts of the OPT—with the
army, for example, primarily administering the West Bank and exerting control from
outside the territory in Gaza, whereas the same civil authorities that govern in Israel also
rule over East Jerusalem—they all operate under the direction of the Israeli government
headed by the prime minister. Every Israeli government since 1967 has pursued or
maintained abusive policies in the OPT. In the West Bank, at least ten government
ministries directly fund projects to serve settlements, and a Settlement Affairs Ministry
was formed in May 2020. 17 The Knesset has also passed laws and formed committees that
apply exclusively there. 18 The Israeli Supreme Court serves as the court of last resort for
Israeli actions in both Israel and the OPT and has ruled on major cases that have
determined policies in both territories. 19 Quasi-state bodies, such as the World Zionist

The prohibition of crimes against humanity is among the most fundamental in
international criminal law. The concept, which dates back more than one hundred years
and became clearly part of international criminal law in the 1945 Charter of the
International Military Tribunal that created the court that prosecuted members of the
leadership of Nazi Germany in Nuremberg, refers to a small number of the most serious
crimes under international law. 21
The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which came into force in 2002,
sets out 11 crimes that can amount to a crime against humanity when “committed as part
of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with
knowledge of the attack.” 22 The statute defines “attack” as a “course of action involving
the multiple commission of acts… pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational
policy.” “Widespread” refers to the scale of the acts or number of victims, 23 whereas
“systematic” indicates a “pattern or methodological plan.” 24 Crimes against humanity can
be committed during peace or armed conflict.
The Explanatory Memorandum of the Rome Statute explains that crimes against humanity
“are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity

According to the International Law Commission (ILC), the prohibition against apartheid
represents a peremptory norm of international law. 30 The ILC describes apartheid as “a
serious breach on a widespread scale of an international obligation of essential
importance for safeguarding the human being,” noting its prohibition in a range of legal
instruments within states and “general agreement among Governments as to the
peremptory character” of the prohibition. 31 The International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which has 182 states parties, 32

segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of

Statutory Limitations to War Crimes declared that crimes against humanity included

In 1973, the UN General Assembly adopted a specific convention on apartheid, the
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (“Apartheid
Convention”), declaring it to constitute a crime against humanity. 35 The Apartheid
Convention, which came into force in 1976 and has 109 states parties, including the state
of Palestine but not Israel, states:
The term “the crime of apartheid”, which shall include similar policies and
practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practiced in southern
Africa, shall apply to the following inhuman acts committed for the
purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group
of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically
oppressing them…

36

The Apartheid Convention then identifies a number of “inhuman acts” that, when
committed for the purpose of domination and systematic oppression, make up the crime of
apartheid, including:
(b) Deliberate imposition on a racial group or groups of living conditions
calculated to cause its or their physical destruction in whole or in part;
(c) Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a
racial group or groups from participation in the political, social,
economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of
conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in
particular by denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human

Definition of Key Terms
No court has to date heard a case involving the crime of apartheid and therefore
Rome Statute definitions of the crime of apartheid:
Racial Group: Both the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute use the term “racial
group,” but neither defines it. 43 The development of the Apartheid Convention against the
backdrop of events in southern Africa in the 1970s, as referenced in the text of the
Convention, as well as the non-inclusion of other categories beyond race, and the rejection
of proposals by some states to expand the treaty’s scope, could lead to a narrower
interpretation focused on divisions based on skin color. 44 While discussion of the
meaning of “racial group” during the drafting of the Rome Statute appears to have been
minimal, 45 its inclusion in the definition of apartheid, after the end of apartheid in South
Africa and when international human rights law had clearly defined racial discrimination to
include differences of ethnicity, descent, and national origin, indicates that “racial group”
within the Rome Statute reflects, and would likely be interpreted by courts to reflect, a
broader conception of race.
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
(ICERD), which was adopted in 1965 and came into legal force in 1969, defines “racial
discrimination” as “any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race,
colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or
impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of
public life.” 46 The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination

consistently found that members of racial and ethnic groups, as well as groups defined
based on descent or their national origin, face racial discrimination. 47 Rather than treat

No international criminal case has ruled on the definition of “racial group” in the context of
the crime against humanity of apartheid. But international criminal courts, in the context of
more recent genocide cases, have addressed the meaning of “national, ethnical, racial or
religious group” in the definition of that crime in part by evaluating group identity based
on context and the construction of local actors, in particular the perpetrators, as opposed
to earlier approaches that focused on hereditary physical traits. The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) held that the assessment of whether a particular group may be
considered as protected from the crime of genocide “will proceed on a case-by-case basis,
taking into account both the evidence proffered and the political, social and cultural
context.” 48 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) also found
that determinations should be “made on a case-by-case basis, consulting both objective
and subjective criteria.” The court, in particular, held that national, ethnic, racial or
religious groups should be identified “by using as a criterion the stigmatisation of the
group, notably by the perpetrators of the crime, on the basis of its perceived national,
ethnical, racial or religious characteristics.” 49 The ICTY held in a 1999 case that “to attempt
to define a national, ethnical or racial group today using objective and scientifically
irreproachable criteria would be a perilous exercise.” 50

discrimination” and international criminal courts’ “subjective approach” to determining

definition of “racial discrimination” broadly reflective of CERD’s approach, a CERD member notes that ICERD “is, essentially,
about groups of people discriminated against on the ground of a social stratification, of an inherited status.”

racial and other groups mirrors the evolution in how the social sciences understand race

Israeli law has also interpreted race broadly, not limiting it to skin color. The Israeli Penal
Code defines racism, in the context of the crime of “incitement to racism,” as
“persecution, humiliation, degradation, a display of enmity, hostility or violence, or
causing violence against a public or parts of the population, all because of their color,
racial affiliation or national ethnic origin.” 52 Under Article 7A of Israel’s Basic Law: The
Knesset—1958, which bars candidates from running for office if they engage in
“incitement,” 53 Israel’s Supreme Court has barred candidates, such as from the Jewish
Power (Otzma Yehudit) party, from running for office based on vitriolic comments made
about Palestinians. 54
While it is beyond the scope of this report to analyze the group identities of Jewish Israelis
or Palestinians, it is clear that in the local context, Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are
regarded as separate identity groups that fall within the broad understanding of “racial
group” under international human rights law. The 1950 Law of Return, which guarantees
Jews the right to immigrate to Israel and gain citizenship, defines “Jew” to include “a
person who was born of a Jewish mother,” embracing a descent-based, as opposed to a
purely religious, classification. 55 Many in Israel characterize the virulently anti-Palestinian

Meanwhile, on account of their identity, Palestinians face discrimination and repression,
as this report makes clear. Palestinians have deep cultural, political, economic, social, and
family ties across Israel, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. For
much of the modern era, Palestinians moved freely across these areas, which constituted
mandatory Palestine, under British administration, in the post-World War I era. The
Palestine Liberation Organization Charter defines Palestinians as “those Arab nationals
who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine,” emphasizing that the identity is
“transmitted from parents to children.” 58 Even within Israel where both Jews and
Palestinians are citizens, authorities classify Jews and Palestinians as belonging to
different “nationalities.” 59

system can cover entire states or more limited geographic areas, depending on the
allocation of power, unity of authority, or differing oppressive laws, policies, and
institutions, among other factors.
Domination: This term, which lacks a clear definition in law, appears in context to refer to
an intent by one group to maintain heightened control over another, which can involve
control over key levers of political power, land, and resources. The reference is found in
both the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.
The focus on domination, as opposed to formal sovereignty, also indicates that the crime
of apartheid can be carried out by authorities outside its own territory and with respect to
non-citizens. 63 A finding that authorities of one state have committed the crime of
apartheid in an external territory would no more undermine the formal sovereignty the

Systematic Oppression: This term, also without a clear definition in law, appears to refer to
the methods used to carry out an intent to maintain domination. The reference in the
Apartheid Convention to “policies and practices of racial discrimination as practiced in
southern Africa” indicates that oppression must reach a high degree of intensity to meet
the requisite threshold for the crime . 65

Persecution
The crime of persecution traces back to the 1945 International Military Tribunal in
Nuremberg. The tribunal’s charter recognizes “persecutions on political, racial or religious
grounds” as crimes against humanity. 66
The Rome Statute also identifies persecution as a crime against humanity, defining it as “the
intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by
reason of the identity of the group or collectivity.” 67 The statute broadened the scope of the
crime to encompass “any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national,
ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are
universally recognized as impressible under international law.” 68 The statute limits the

crime to applying only “in connection with” other crimes identified under it. 69 The customary

International criminal lawyer Antonio Cassese, who served as a judge in the leading ICTY
case that examined persecution within international criminal law (Prosecutor v. Kupreskic),
identified the crime against humanity of persecution as a crime under customary
international law. 71 He defined persecution under customary international law as referring to
acts that a) result in egregious or grave violations of fundamental human rights, b) are part
of a widespread or systematic practice, and c) are committed with discriminatory intent. 72
Neither the Rome Statute nor customary international law clearly set the threshold of what
constitutes a violation that is sufficiently “severe” or “egregious.” Human Rights Watch
recognizes that many human rights violations cause serious harm. However, for the
determination of whether the crime against humanity of persecution has been committed,
Human Rights Watch requires the most serious forms of violations before the requirements
of “severe” or “egregious” can be met.

Legal Consequences of Finding Crimes Against Humanity
The commission of crimes against humanity can serve as the basis for individual criminal
liability not only in the domestic courts of the perpetrator country but also in international
courts and tribunals, as well as in domestic courts outside the country in question under
the principle of universal jurisdiction. Individual criminal liability extends beyond those
who carry out the acts to those who order, assist, facilitate, aid, and abet the offense.
Under the principle of command responsibility, military, and civilian officials up to the top
of the chain of command can be held criminally responsible for crimes committed by their
subordinates when they knew or should have known that such crimes were being
committed but failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the crimes or punish
those responsible.

In December 2019, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda concluded a nearly five-year
preliminary inquiry into the Palestine situation and determined that “all the statutory
Palestinians had been met. The prosecutor found a “reasonable basis” to believe that war
crimes had been committed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities but did not reference any
crimes against humanity. 73 Although the prosecutor did not require formal judicial
authorization to move forward with a formal investigation, she nonetheless sought a ruling
from the court’s judges on the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction before proceeding. 74
In February 2021, the court ruled that it had jurisdiction over crimes committed in the OPT,
including East Jerusalem, confirming Palestine’s status as a state party to the Rome
Statute able to confer that jurisdiction.

Israel signed the Rome Statute in 2000, but did not ratify it and said in August 2002 that it
did not intend to do so. 77 However, the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute

III. Intent to Maintain Domination
Attachment: israel_palestine0421_web_0 (COM 298 #2021 : A communication was received from Tom Arabia)

Israeli government policy has long sought to engineer and maintain a Jewish majority in
Israel and maximize Jewish Israeli control over land in Israel and the OPT. Laws, planning
documents, and statements by officials demonstrate that the pursuit of domination by
Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, in particular over demographics and land, guides
government policy, and actions to this day.
This chapter will show that this objective amounts to an intent to maintain domination by
one group over another. When inhumane acts are carried out in the context of systematic
oppression pursuant to that intent to maintain domination, the crime against humanity of
apartheid is committed.
Discriminatory intent, when it gives rise to severe abuses of fundamental rights, also
makes up the crime against humanity of persecution.
To analyze the motivations behind Israeli policies towards Palestinians today, which
developed over many years with much of the architecture established in the early years of
the state and the occupation, this chapter considers materials that in some cases date
back decades. This does not implicate every official cited in seeking to dominate
Palestinians. In fact, some Israeli officials and parties advocated positions that, if
implemented, could have avoided such policies.
Israeli authorities justify some of these policies in the name of security, but, as this
chapter shows, they often use security as a justification to advance demographic
objectives. In other cases, officials advocate for policies to safeguard Israel’s identity as a
Jewish state. Israel can, like any other state, seek to promote a particular identity, but that
does not include a license to violate fundamental rights. Not all policies designed to
promote Judaization constitute rights abuses. Particular policies can, though, provide
evidence of a discriminatory intent or purpose to maintain domination by Jewish Israelis.
Even policies designed to fulfill legitimate security objectives must comply with
international law. As this chapter will show, Israeli authorities have pursued many policies

in ways that manifest a discriminatory intent to systematically dominate Palestinians. The
legitimate objective of ensuring security does not negate an illegitimate intent to dominate

Demographics
Demographic considerations, in particular the quest for a strong Jewish majority, have long
underlined Israeli government policy. The key declarative line of Israel’s Proclamation of
Independence proclaims the “establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel.” 80 The
proclamation largely narrates the history of the Jewish people and twice in the short
document underscores the centrality of Jewish immigration. While the proclamation does
commit itself to “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants,” it
presents the newly established state as belonging to the Jewish people, describing Israel
as “their state.”
Israel’s Basic Laws, which have constitutional status in the absence of a full constitution,
re-enforce that the state is Jewish, rather than belonging to all its citizens. The Basic Law:
The Knesset—1958, for example, declares that no candidate can run for the Knesset if they
expressly or implicitly endorse “negation of the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish
and democratic state.” 81 The Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty sets out its purpose as
to “establish… the values of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”
The Basic Law: Israel—The Nation-State of the Jewish People (‘Nation-State Law’) passed in
2018, in effect affirms the supremacy of the “Jewish” over the “democratic” character of
the state. The Nation-State Law sets out amid its “basic principles” that Israel is “the
nation state of the Jewish people” and that the “exercise of the right to national selfdetermination in the state of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” Article 7 further states
that “the State views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and shall
act to encourage and promote its establishment and strengthening.” 82 Unlike Israel’s
Proclamation of Independence, the Nation-State Law contains no language about equality.

A Knesset legal advisor said he sought to include “mention of the issue of equality and the
issue of the state belonging to all citizens, [but] the committee chose not to make this into
as a state of all its citizens, but the Knesset presidium disqualified it before it could be
discussed since it “seeks to deny Israel’s existence as the state of the Jewish people,” the
Knesset legal advisor said. 84
Israel’s occupation of the OPT in 1967 amplified Israeli concerns about demographics.
Within Israel’s pre-1967 borders, Jews currently represent about 81 percent of the
population, as compared to about 19 percent of Palestinians. 85 But, when combining all of
the OPT with Israel, Jews and Palestinians are in rough parity. And even when restricting
the calculus to Israel and the West Bank, the part of the OPT that Israeli authorities covet
for Jewish settlement, and excluding Gaza’s significant Palestinian population, the Jewish
majority stands at 59 percent compared to 41 percent Palestinians. Many of the practices
outlined in this report can be traced to the Israeli government’s desire to maintain Jewish
control while retaining the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which adds 3.1 million
Palestinians to the land it controls, in addition to the 1.6 million who reside in Israel. 86
Statements by Israeli prime ministers and other senior officials highlight the extent to
which the intent to maintain demographic control has guided policymaking. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, in a March 10, 2019, post on the social media platform Instagram,
stated, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens,” but rather “the nation-state of the Jewish

people and only them.” 87 In December 2003, in between terms as prime minister,
Netanyahu said at a conference that "if there is a demographic problem, and there is, it is
that strive to integrate “Israel’s Arabs” with ensuring they do not reach 35-40 percent of
the population. 88 He warned that “if their numbers will reach 35-40 percent of the country,
then the Jewish state will be annulled.” 89 He also stated that the separation barrier,
ostensibly erected to enhance Israel’s security, would also help to prevent a “demographic
spillover” of Palestinians from the West Bank. 90
Demographic-driven policymaking extends beyond Prime Minister Netanyahu. Even Israeli
leaders who supported Israel’s withdrawal from a greater portion of the West Bank than
others did often make demographics—the need for Israel to preserve a Jewish majority—
one of their central arguments. Netanyahu’s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, said in 2003, three
years before he became prime minister, that “the demographic issue” would “dictate the
solution we must adopt” and that the “formula for the parameters of a unilateral solution
are: to maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians.” 91 His
predecessor, Ariel Sharon, as prime minister, said in a 2002 Knesset debate that while
Palestinian citizens had “rights in the land,” “all rights over the land of Israel are Jewish
rights.” 92 His predecessor Ehud Barak, when he was prime minister, equated a “Muslim
majority” with “destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.” 93 His predecessor as prime
minister, Shimon Peres, while serving as president in 2012 said that “Israeli settlements in

demographic change” and “places a Jewish majority in the state of Israel at risk.” 94 His
predecessor as prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said that “the red line for Arabs is 20% of
character of the state of Israel.” 95
While states are sometimes associated with a religious or ethnic identity, a states’
prerogative to define its own identity and promote it is not unlimited; it is not a license to
violate the fundamental rights of others. Laws and policies adopted by the Israeli
government to preserve a Jewish majority have afforded benefits to Jews at the expense of
the fundamental rights of Palestinians. Most significantly in demonstrating Israel’s
demographic goals is the 1950 Law of Return. It guarantees Jewish citizens of other
countries the right to settle in Israel, and its 1952 Citizenship Law entitles them to
citizenship. 96 The same Citizenship Law, by contrast, denies Palestinian refugees and
their descendants, 5.7 million of whom were registered as of February 2021 with the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), 97 the ability to enter and live in areas where
they or their families once lived and have maintained links to. The right to live in Israel or
the OPT is guaranteed to them under international human rights law, alongside the options
of integration in place or resettlement elsewhere. 98 These policies create a reality where a
Jewish citizen of any other country who has never been to Israel can move there or to a
West Bank settlement and automatically gain citizenship, while a Palestinian refugee
expelled from his home and languishing for more than 70 years in a refugee camp in a
nearby country cannot move to either Israel or the OPT.

The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003, which prohibits
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza with few exceptions from obtaining citizenship
demographic control. 99 Ariel Sharon, commenting in 2005 when he was prime minister on
the renewal of the temporary law, said, “There’s no need to hide behind security
arguments. There’s a need for the existence of a Jewish state.” 100 He later added that
authorities had “a correct and important intention of Israel being a Jewish state with a
massive Jewish majority” and that “we must do everything so that this state remains a
Jewish state in the future.” 101 Giora Eiland, national security advisor at the time, who
served on a committee in 2005 examining immigration policies, conceded that “the
Citizenship Law is the way to overcome the demographic demon.” 102 Then-finance minister
Benjamin Netanyahu put it more directly during discussions over renewing the law:
“Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want to get citizenship, we should make
the process much more difficult, in order to guarantee Israel’s security and a Jewish
majority in Israel.” 103 Eli Yishai, while serving as minister of interior affairs, said in 2012
that approving a larger number of family unification applications from the West Bank
would constitute “national suicide.” 104
In practice, the Interior Ministry’s policies and practices have long aimed at ensuring
Jewish Israeli demographic control. In 2004, The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI)

registry, which ACRI charges “views itself as defender of the Jewish character of the state,”
subjects applicants to “organized and methodical bureaucratic harassment” in order to
policy that particularly harms Palestinians. 105 The Interior Ministry continues to erect
bureaucratic hurdles, in particular for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. 106 At the same time,
authorities and quasi-state institutions have for years actively sought to boost Jewish
immigration to Israel. 107
Israeli authorities have also since 1967 effectively controlled the population registry in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, recording every Palestinian birth, marriage, divorce, address
change, and death. Between 1967 and 1994, they struck from it hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch has documented. 108 The Israeli army has used
residency status to control the ability of Palestinians to reside in, move within, and travel
abroad from the West Bank, as well as to travel from Gaza to Israel and the West Bank. 109
These restrictions are implemented in so sweeping a fashion that it is difficult to see them
as motivated primarily by security – rather than demographic – considerations. 110
Some Israeli laws provide benefits on the basis of criteria other than nationality, but the
purpose remains privileging Jews over Palestinians. These laws often are not
discriminatory on their face, using proxies to mask discriminatory intent, even as in some
cases officials extoll the demographic logic. For example, in 2002, the Israeli Knesset cut

whose parents had not served in the army. 111 The overwhelming majority of Palestinians do
the army, they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not
available to Palestinians. 112
Statements by Israeli officials at the time make clear the discriminatory intent behind this
move. Reporting on 2003 and 2004 statistics that showed a drop in the Israeli birthrate,
primarily driven by a decline among Palestinian citizens of Israel, Haaretz in January 2005
attributed to the Finance Ministry the view that “the drop of birthrate is a clear result of the
cutbacks in child support allocations over the past two years.” Haaretz quotes a senior
Finance Ministry official, who asked to be unnamed, citing the “internal demographic
threat” and expressing concern over “the high birthrate of the Arabs, and especially the
Negev Bedouin.” The official said that “we are reversing the graph, to defend the Jewish
majority in the country,” and warned, according to Haaretz, that reinstating the allowance
would lead to the state having to support large families in places like the Negev, which
would have the effect of undermining the Jewish majority. 113
While at times striking down discriminatory state policies, the Israeli Supreme Court has
endorsed demographics-driven decision-making. For example, in a prominent 2000 case
declaring that the state could not discriminate directly on the basis of religion and
nationality in allocating state land, Supreme Court President Aharon Barak highlighted the
favored legal status of Jewish Israelis when it came to acquiring residency. He wrote that
“it is true, members of the Jewish nation were granted a special key to enter (see the Law
of Return-5710-1950), but once a person has lawfully entered the home, he enjoys equal
rights with all other household members.” 114 Israel has long used its control over the
“house” to maintain a solid Jewish majority, at the expense of Palestinians. Citing another
well-known opinion by Barak, Asher Grunis, then deputy president of the Supreme Court

Control Over Land
Alongside demographic control, Israeli authorities have sought to ensure Jewish control
over the land and natural resources in Israel and the OPT. Israeli authorities have largely
pursued the goals of demographic and land domination in parallel, seeking to maximize
the land available for Jewish communities and largely confine Palestinians to dense
population centers.
In February 1948, Ben Gurion, then chairperson of the Jewish Agency before becoming
prime minister, reported the night after visiting Lifta, 116 a Palestinian village in the suburbs
of Jerusalem whose residents fled or were expelled from their homes:
When you enter the city through Lifta and Romema, through Mahaneh
Yehuda, King George Street and Me’ah She’arim –there are no Arabs. One
hundred percent Jews… What happened in Jerusalem and in Haifa—can
happen in large parts of the country. If we persist it is quite possible that in
the next six or eight months there will be considerable changes in the
country, very considerable and to our advantage. There will certainly be
considerable changes in the demographic composition of the country. 117
Israel’s seizure of thousands of dunams of land from Palestinians in 1948 and in
subsequent decades in Israel and the OPT have aimed to serve the exclusive interest of
Jewish Israelis. Reflecting just on the situation inside Israel, a 2003 Israeli governmentcommissioned report found that “the expropriation activities were clearly and explicitly

harnessed to the interests of the Jewish majority, and the land was transferred to entities
such as the Jewish National Fund (JNF), which according to its own definition serves Jewish
patterns, served a similar objective.” 118 The Israel Land Administration manages and
allocates 93 percent of the land in Israel, 119 meaning this government-commission report
found that the state uses the overwhelming majority of land in Israel to serve only one
community, Jewish Israelis.
Semi-governmental bodies like the JNF, Jewish Agency, and WZO that serve the Jewish
community and no other constituency, play central roles in this effort. A 1953 Knesset law
endows JNF, or Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael in Hebrew, with governmental authorities, 120 and
Israel’s Basic Law: Israel Lands (1960) notes that ownership over its land “shall not be
transferred either by sale or in any other manner.” 121 JNF owns 13 percent of Israeli land,
which the Israel Land Authority (ILA) manages. JNF makes up nearly half the governing
board of the ILA, which controls 93 percent of the land in Israel. 122
The explicit mandate of the JNF is to develop and lease land for Jews and not any other
segment of the population. Under the terms of its Memorandum and Articles of
Association, the JNF acquires property “for the purpose of settling Jews on such lands and
properties.” 123 In a 2004 court filing, the JNF made clear that it “is not a public body that
works for the benefit of all citizens of the state. The loyalty of JNF is given to the Jewish
people and only to them is the JNF obligated.” 124 The JNF long interpreted its mandate as

Following a lawsuit brought by rights groups though, Israeli authorities have allowed nonland of equal value elsewhere. 126 Haaretz, though, has reported that Palestinians have
faced “red tape” far exceeding what Jews face when purchasing JNF land, delaying
registration by years or more. 127
JNF leaders have also said they have pursued similar policies in the West Bank since
1967. 128 The Israeli group Peace Now has documented at least 65,000 dunams of land in
the West Bank that the JNF has purchased since 1967 for settlements. 129 In February 2021,
JNF’s leadership and board approved changing its policies to allow it to expand its
purchase of land in the West Bank for settlements. 130
Israeli law also affords semi-governmental status to the World Zionist Organization
(WZO) and the Jewish Agency. A 1952 law establishes the organizations, then a single
entity, as “the authorised agent” of the state “for the development and settlement of the
country” and “absorption of immigrants from the Diaspora.” 131 The Jewish Agency,

18. 138 Since the early 2000s, the WZO has played a more active role as well in the Negev
and the Galilee; the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has described them as “the government’s
the Galilee.” 139
Israeli authorities have pursued an explicit policy of ensuring Jewish control over
geographic areas with strategic importance where there are concentrations of Palestinians
across Israel and the OPT. Judaization of these areas contributed to facilitating Israeli
government control over Palestinian population centers, dividing communities, and
blocking the establishment of larger, contiguous Palestinian municipal areas in locations
that Israeli authorities covet or consider particularly strategic. This strategy also
contributes to generally diluting the Palestinian population in some areas and pushing
them into crowded population centers.

Israel (Galilee and Negev)
In Israel, authorities maintain a policy to Judaize the Galilee and Negev regions, one
pursued in coordination with the JNF, the Jewish Agency, and the WZO. These areas
account for nearly two-thirds of the land in Israel, 140 and encompass much of the
Palestinian population. 141 The Israeli government has a ministry focused on the
“development” of the Galilee and the Negev, has invested significantly in these areas, and
has considered it a major government priority for much of the past two decades. 142 In
2004, the Sharon government unveiled a cross-sectional plan estimated to cost 16.8 NIS

While Israeli authorities use non-discriminatory language of seeking to “develop” or
“populate” these regions, the Israeli rights group Sikkuy wrote in 2005 that “it is clear to
everyone that the plan is intended for Jewish residents.” 145 The Negev plan, for example,
defined the ideal new residents as a “strong population,” including “families with high
income” who work in central Israel, an area that has a much higher proportion of Jews to
Palestinians and who will continue to commute to their old jobs. 146 Authorities also
offered a 90 percent discount on the leasing fees for Negev properties to soldiers who
had served for at least one year, an offer that would attract mainly Jews since Bedouins
are exempt from military service and only a small percentage volunteer to serve in the
army. 147 Shimon Peres, then deputy prime minister, described the development of the
Negev and the Galilee as a “battle for the future of the Jewish people.” 148 The Jewish
Agency has said that it sought to guarantee a “Zionist majority” in the Negev and the
Galilee, launching its own programs in these areas “to get around the problem that the
government must act on behalf of all citizens of the state of Israel while the WZO is
entitled to act for the sake of the Jewish people.” 149 The government approved the WZO
establishing settlements in these areas. 150

In December 2007, Minister for the Development of the Negev and Galilee Jacob Edery,
reflecting on new demographic data, said, “We have to do everything we can to boost
towns in the Negev and Galilee with up to 400 households to maintain admissions
committees that can reject applicants from living there for being “not suitable for the
social life of the community” or for incompatibility with the “social-cultural fabric.” 152 The
law’s sponsors openly spoke about how the law would facilitate the creation and
maintenance of Jewish-only communities. 153 In June 2019, then Transportation Minister
Bezalel Smotrich said that “I intend to Judaize the Galilee” and “lay down a network of
roads, to complete a revolution, so that hundreds of thousands of Jews will come to live in
the Galilee.” 154 The month before, the JNF announced its aim to bring 1.5 million residents
to the Negev and Galilee by 2040. 155

that month, Rotem said the law would codify screening procedures so that Jewish Israelis could “establish a place where
everybody is an army veteran, a Yeshiva alumni, or something of that sort.” Another sponsor, Yisrael Hasson of the Kadima
party, said in December 2010 that "the bill reflects the Knesset's commitment to work to preserve the ability to realize the
Zionist dream in practice in the state of Israel" through "population dispersal” which the government had begun "thirty years
ago ... [with] a string of small communities in the Galilee and Negev." He added, "realization of these goals obliged us as

The government’s historic policies towards these areas provide further context for
determining the intent behind its current policies. The plan to Judaize the Galilee, a
region largely slated to fall within the “Arab State” in the 1947 UN Partition Plan, dates
back to the 1950s when it emerged as part of a strategy to consolidate Israeli control of
the area. 156 A senior Israeli official at the time wrote that the Palestinian presence in
these areas threatened Israeli control, worrying that Palestinians would “invade all
areas we neglect, strike footholds and establish new roots.” 157 Ben Gurion told the
Knesset that Israel’s imposition of military rule over most Palestinians in Israel at the

time aimed “to protect the right to Jewish settlement in all parts of the state.” 158 The
plan to Judaize the Galilee focused initially on creating and sustaining Jewish
the growth of nearby Palestinian communities. 159
The Israeli newspaper Al HaMishmar in 1976 published a leaked government document
drafted by Yisrael Koenig, then northern district commissioner of the Interior Ministry. 160
The memo, entitled “Top Secret: Memorandum-Proposal Handling the Arabs of Israel,” lays
out the demographic situation in the area, showing that Jews maintain a slight
demographic majority but will be overtaken in a few years if birthrates continue at current
rates. It then recommends that authorities “expand and deepen Jewish settlement in areas
where the contiguity of the Arab population is prominent, and where they number
considerably more than the Jewish population; [and] examine the possibility of diluting
existing Arab population concentrations.” While officials condemned the plan and said it
had not been acted on, 161 Koenig remained in his role for more than a decade after the
memo’s publication, a leaked 1995 map by a regional planning committee echoed similar
objectives, and elements of the strategy bear resemblance to policies that have been
carried out since. 162

remove them from key Negev routes and secure the land for settling Jews and building
army bases. 164 Concentrating Palestinian Bedouin communities on limited pieces of
territory remains at the heart of Israeli government plans for the Negev.
The strategy of maximizing Jewish settlement alongside suppression of the Palestinian
population continues. In the Negev, for example, Sharon in December 2000, just before
becoming prime minister and pursuing the development of the Negev as a principal
goal, wrote:
In the Negev, we face a serious problem: About 900,000 dunams of
government land are not in our hands, but in the hands of the Bedouin
population. I, as a resident of the Negev, see this problem every day. It is,
essentially, a demographic phenomenon… Out of weakness, perhaps also
lack of awareness about the issue, we, as a country, are doing nothing to
confront this situation… The Bedouin are grabbing new territory. They are
gnawing away at the country’s land reserves, and no one is doing anything
significant about it. 165

Palestinian communities, warning that, “if we go on like we have until now, we will lose the

Jerusalem
The Israeli government’s formal policy for Jerusalem, including both west and the occupied
east, is to pursue “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city,” as stated in the
government’s plan for the municipality (“Jerusalem Outline Plan 2000”), and limiting the
number of Palestinian residents. Concern with demographics in Jerusalem dates back to the
early days of the state but accelerated with Israel’s unilateral annexation of occupied East
Jerusalem and parts of surrounding villages in 1967. Annexation expanded the boundaries of
the city that Israeli authorities consider the country’s capital, but also brought more
Palestinians into an area that authorities treat as part of its sovereign territory. To mitigate
the demographic effect of this move, authorities granted Palestinians from East Jerusalem
permanent residency rather than an easy path to citizenship and instituted other policies
aimed to foster and maintain a Jewish demographic majority in the city.
Following annexation, Israeli officials set a target “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arab,”
although planners later acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the
demographic trend” and adjusted it to a 60-40 percent target. 168 Within Palestinian
communities, the plan, by its own terms, “enables a densification of the rural villages and
densification and thickening of the existing urban neighborhoods.” 169
When delineating Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries in 1967, authorities primarily focused
on, as the Israeli rights group B’Tselem puts it, “demographic concerns, chief among them
to leave out densely populated Palestinian areas in order to ensure a Jewish majority in
Jerusalem.” 170 Israel, in total, added 72 square kilometers, including land that belonged to

Jerusalem Meron Benvenisti wrote that Jerusalem’s “absurd” borders “derived from the

Israeli officials, soon after taking control of East Jerusalem in 1967, confiscated land and
established several settlements, including Ramat Eshkol, Ma’alot Dafna, Givat HaMivtar,
and French Hill, to establish a “bolt,” in the parlance of the Israeli government, connecting
West Jerusalem and Mount Scopus, which was effectively a Jewish island encircled by East
Jerusalem before 1967. 172 Israeli authorities also confiscated land to establish other
settlements, including Ramot Alon and Gilo, to create a “ring,” as they described it, around
the center of Jerusalem and, as one academic writes, “thus preventing any prospect for a
continuity of Arab neighborhoods.” 173 The establishment of a “bolt” and “ring” around
Jerusalem, which authorities continued to fortify through the expansion of settlements in
subsequent years, aimed at bolstering Israeli Jewish control over the city. 174
The newly-annexed area included 66,000 Palestinian residents, 24 percent of the new
municipality’s population. A government commission set up in late 1972 to evaluate Israeli
policy in Jerusalem recommended the government strive to maintain the “ratio of Jews to
Arabs that existed at the end of 1972,” or 73.5 percent Jewish Israeli and 26.5
Palestinian. 175 The government adopted this recommendation and subsequent
governments have reaffirmed it. 176 When formulating Israel’s first municipal plan for
Jerusalem in 1975, Israel Kimhi, then director of planning policy at the Interior Ministry,
said, “One of the cornerstones in the planning of Jerusalem is the demographic question,”

me, I am worried about the balance of power and Arab growth within and around
Jerusalem,” according to minutes of the meetings reviewed by B’Tselem. 178 In a 1990
interview with an Israeli newspaper, Kollek said:
For Jewish Jerusalem, I did something in the past twenty-five years. For East
Jerusalem? Nothing! What did I do? Nothing. Sidewalks? Nothing. Cultural
institutions? Not one. Yes, we installed a sewerage system for them and
improved the water supply. Do you know why? Do you think it was for their
good, for their welfare? Forget it! There were some cases of cholera there,

The Israeli government’s decision to apply the 1952 Law of Entry to Palestinians from East
Jerusalem, the law applicable to foreigners who enter Israel and want to reside there, and
offer them permanent residency, instead of automatic citizenship, further demonstrates
the extent to which demography dictates Israeli policy in Jerusalem. 180 The Jerusalem 2000
Outline Plan makes clear that “the continued proportional growth of the Arab population in
Jerusalem is bound to reduce the ratio of the Jewish population in the future” and that, in

balance of immigration and gaps in birthrate, variables that ultimately determine the

West Bank
The Israeli government has pursued the same formulation in the West Bank as in Israel and
East Jerusalem: maximum control over the land, largely for the benefit of Jews. While
governments have at times differed on what arrangements should govern Palestinians
living in the West Bank, the objectives and reality on the ground have remained largely
consistent over successive governments. On July 7, 1967, exactly one month after the
Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Israel’s then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of the Labor
Party said, “The security and the land are in Israeli hands.” 182 In a party meeting that year,
Eshkol clarified that authorities “covet the dowry, not the bride,” 183 an apparent reference
to wanting the West Bank without the Palestinians who live there. Fifty-two years later, on
July 10, 2019, Prime Minister Netanyahu of the Likud said, “Israeli military and security
forces will continue to rule the entire territory, up to the Jordan [River].” 184 He added on
May 28, 2020, that “we are the ones dictating security rules over the entire territory,”
describing West Bank Palestinians as “subjects.” 185
The current map of the West Bank reflects decades of shifting Israeli governmental plans
for the territory. Israel’s earliest plans for the West Bank, including an unofficial plan
initially drafted in July 1967 by then-Labor Minister Yigal Allon, envisioned Israeli control
over the Jordan Valley and other parts of the West Bank. In an essay he published in 1976
in Foreign Affairs explaining the plan, Allon insisted on the necessity of “absolute Israeli
control over the strategic zone to the east of the dense Arab population, concentrated as it

186

The plan, retaining Israel’s control over the

Jordan Valley and of the corridor around Jerusalem, effectively divided Palestinians in the
including Hebron and Bethlehem, and one in the east around Jericho. 187
Allon’s logic focused on the strategic and security importance of Israeli control of the West
Bank, but in justifying the need for control without formally annexing territory with large
Palestinian populations, references the aim “to preserve [Israel’s] Jewish character.” 188
Allon certainly appeared motivated by a desire to safeguard the security of Israel and its
citizens, as have subsequent officials. Some regard the settlement enterprise as vital for
security. 189 Whatever the motive, it is unacceptable to pursue this aim through a strategy
of seeking to dominate Palestinians, maintaining a discriminatory system, and engaging in
tactics that either have an insufficient security justification or otherwise violate
international law. An intent to ensure security neither negates an intent to dominate, nor
grants a carte blanche to undertake policies that go beyond what international law
permits. While security grounds can justify a range of restrictive measures under
international humanitarian and human rights law, a strategy that seeks to promote security
by ensuring the demographic advantage of one group of people through discrimination or
oppression has no basis under international law.
Subsequent Israeli policies built on the Allon plan. In October 1977, the Israeli government
formally adopted a plan produced by Ariel Sharon, then both the chairperson of the
Ministerial Committee for Settlement Affairs and agriculture minister, that expanded on the
Allon Plan by strengthening Israeli control in the western West Bank, to the east of the
Green Line. 190 The plan called for creating rings of “security zones” in order to, as former
Israeli official and analyst Shaul Arieli put it, “prevent the Palestinian population from

seeping into Israel; to create a Jewish barrier between Israeli Arabs in the Wadi Ara and the
‘Small Triangle’ area [areas in central Israel near the Green Line]; and to control key
Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Avraham Orly, said in a statement to the
Supreme Court that settlements “are used mostly [in times of calm] for a show of presence
and control over essential areas, for observation and the like.” 192
The “Master Plan for the Development of Settlements in Judea and Samaria 1979-1983,” a
1980 plan formulated by the World Zionist Organization’s Settlement Division, the body
charged with establishing settlements and fully funded by the government and operating
directly under its control, built on the prior schemes. The “Drobles Plan” as it was known,
named after its author and head of the Settlement Division, Matityahu Drobles, called for
Israeli authorities “to settle the land between the [Arab] minority population centers and
their surroundings,” noting that doing so would make it “hard for Palestinians to create
territorial contiguity and political unity.” The plan further noted that any autonomy granted
to Palestinians, as set out in the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel of the late
1970s, did “not apply to the territories but rather to the Arab population alone” and that
“there cannot be any shadow of a doubt about our intention to maintain perpetual control
over the territory of Judea and Samaria.” 193 It adds that “the best and most effective way to
remove any trace of doubt about our intention to control Judea and Samaria forever is
through accelerated surge of settlements in these areas,” in particular to “create the
widest possible spread” of settlements and “establish additional settlements next to every
existing settlement.”

In 1985, defense minister at the time Yitzhak Rabin said that “there will be no
development [for Palestinians in the OPT] initiated by the Israeli Government, and no

A 1997 strategic plan by the WZO Settlement Division specified a series of additional
measures to further cement Israeli rule over the West Bank. It called for expanding
“settlement zones” to include military sites, nature reserves, archaeological sites, and
adjacent state land, joining them with “topographically high points overlooking
settlements, traffic arteries, and infrastructure corridors” to establish “contiguous
stretches of land” under Israel’s control. It highlighted several areas of strategic
importance, including around Jerusalem, in the northwest West Bank, in the Jordan Valley,
in the South Hebron Hills, and the northern edge of the West Bank, for which Israel should
remain in control to “serve as buffer zones” and provide settlers “with a completely normal
Israeli life in all ways.” It further designates “three strategic lateral corridors,” or strategic
roads to run east-west across the West Bank, to serve as the “backbone” connecting the
various settlements, “prevent uncontrolled Arab building,” and preserve “balance
between the size of the Israeli and Arab populations.” 198

In 2001, shortly after his election as prime minister, Sharon said, “It’s not by accident that
the settlements are located where they are,” so that “come what may, we have to hold the
along the Jordan River and the roads linking the two. And Jerusalem, of course. And the
hill aquifer.” 199
In 2014, Member of Knesset (MK) Yariv Levin, appointed the following year as Israel’s
minister of aliyah (Jewish Immigration) and integration, said, “The correct policy, from the
point of view of Israeli interests regarding our political ability at the moment, is to combine
the attempt to hold the maximum amount of territory and apply sovereignty over the
maximum amount of territory while keeping the Arab population within it to a minimum.
The situation already exists in Area C, which is under our control – there are little more
than fifty thousand Arabs.” 200 In February 2021, Avi Naim, who served as director-general
for Israel’s Ministry for Settlement Affairs between July and October 2020, underscored the
government’s objective to “prevent Palestinian territorial continuity” and “keep control of
land reserves in Judea and Samaria”. 201
Israeli authorities have taken a variety of steps to limit the numbers of Palestinians in the
West Bank, including denying residency rights to Palestinians for being abroad when the
occupation began in 1967, or for long periods during the first few decades of the
occupation; imposing an effective freeze on family reunification over the past two
decades; and largely restricting movement from Gaza to the West Bank, as described in a
subsequent chapter of this report. 202 Palestinian residents of Area C face an additional

While officials have sometimes maintained that measures taken in the occupied West
Bank are temporary, the government’s actions and policies over more than a half-century
example, while the Israeli government formally declared that it built the separation barrier
in the early 2000s “to reduce the entry of terrorists from Judea and Samaria to carry out
terror attacks in Israel,” 204 senior Israeli officials have openly spoken about the barrier
facilitating the takeover of land. 205 B’Tselem and Bimkom– Planners for Planning Rights
documented how the route largely aimed to incorporate settlement blocs, while
minimizing the number of Palestinians included. 206 The Israeli government itself conceded
in court proceedings that the expansion plans of settlements factored into its
considerations around the route of the barrier, which does not follow the Green Line but
rather incorporates on the “Israeli side” thousands of dunams of land. 207
Beyond the land grabs, authorities have entirely integrated the settlements’ sewage
system, communication and road networks, and electrical grids and water infrastructure
with Israel proper. In December 2017, the attorney general issued guidelines requiring that
all government-sponsored bills specify their application to settlers or otherwise justify why
they do not. 208 In recent years, the Knesset has passed a growing number of laws that
apply specifically to the West Bank, including a law allowing authorities to retroactively
expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements have been built, a law that
transfers petitions brought against state policy to an administrative court instead of the
Supreme Court and a law that brings universities in settlements under Israel’s Council for

April 2019 and March 2020, 210 it has long dominated these areas.

Gaza Strip
From 1967 until the early 2000s, Israeli policy towards the occupied Gaza Strip mirrored its
approach to the West Bank, maximizing control over the land, privileging the more than
7,500 settlers who lived there, 211 and subjugating the Palestinians of Gaza. 212 The Israeli
government’s withdrawal of its settler population from Gaza in 2005 reflected not a
departure from the objective of demographic and land control in the OPT, but rather a
recalibration in light of the large Palestinian population inhabiting a small strip of land and
the burden of securing a tiny Jewish settler community there. It marked a shift to focus on
ensuring Jewish demographic control over the areas it hopes to retain permanently—
namely, Israel and much, if not all, of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Withdrawal
effectively took the large Palestinian population there off Israel’s demographic balance
sheet and allowed Israeli authorities to consolidate a solid Jewish majority in their books
across Israel and the remainder of the OPT that they intended to retain, while maintaining
control of Gaza via other means.
Israeli officials at the time acknowledged the demographic objectives behind the move. On
August 15, 2005, the day the Israeli government set as a deadline for settlers to voluntarily
leave Gaza, Prime Minister Sharon said in an evening address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot be
held onto forever. Over one million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers

Authorities, in fact, explicitly said that they wanted to redirect the resources that went into
the settler community in Gaza to strengthening Jewish Israeli control over parts of Israel
and the West Bank. The early 2000s push, for example, to Judaize the Galilee and the
Negev came as Israeli authorities were putting in motion their plans to withdraw from
Gaza. Haaretz quoted an advisor to Prime Minister Sharon at the time as saying that
Sharon “reached the conclusion that following the enormous investment in settling the
territories, it is now necessary to settle the Galilee and the Negev.” 215
Following Hamas’s wresting control of the Gaza Strip from the PA in 2007, the Israeli
government, which had a practice of security cooperation with the PA but hostile relations
with Hamas, announced restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of
Gaza. It declared Gaza “hostile territory” and took a range of measures aimed at, among
other things, weakening the economy. 216 As a central part of their policy, Israeli authorities
have enforced what they call “a policy of separation” between Gaza and the West Bank,
which they say serves “both security and political goals.” 217 In March 2019, the Jerusalem

Demographics factor centrally in Israel’s separation policy. Israeli policy since 2000 has
created what Israeli rights groups have called a “one-way permit” from the West Bank to
Gaza, whereby, in the rare cases where authorities permit Palestinians to transit between
Gaza and the West Bank, they permit it only exclusively in the direction of Gaza. 219 The
army’s “Procedure for Settlement in the Gaza Strip by Residents of Judea and Samaria,”
published in 2018, states that “[i]n 2006, a decision was made to introduce a policy of
separation between the Judea and Samaria Area and the Gaza Strip in light of Hamas’ rise
to power in the Gaza Strip. The policy currently in effect is aimed at reducing travel
between the areas.” The document, though, notes that “a resident of Judea and Samaria
may file an application for permanent settlement in the Gaza Strip for any purpose that is
considered humanitarian (usually family unification).” It then clarifies that “as settlement
of Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area is possible only in the rarest cases… the
need to allow the family to be maintained in the Gaza Strip arises.” 220
Its guidelines for Gaza residents seeking to settle in the West Bank, published in a
separate Israeli army document, re-enforce the same policy. It sets out that “for all
practical purposes entry of residents of Gaza into the Judea and Samaria Area shall only be
allowed in the most exceptional humanitarian cases.” It notes that the deputy defense
minister “established that in every case involving the settlement of Gaza residents in the
Judea and Samaria Area one should adopt the most restrictive policy” and “clarified that a

would fundamentally undermine the policy of separation and of reducing movement between the areas, as outlined by the
government;” and “The policy on travel between the State of Israel and the Gaza Strip, including the separation policy

Gisha found, based on information obtained from the Israeli army via Freedom of
Information requests, that between 2009 and March 2017, the Israeli army had approved
only six applications for Gaza residents to reside in the West Bank, in each case following
the filing of a petition to Israel’s Supreme Court. Four of the six cases involved children
who had no one to care for them in Gaza. 222 By contrast, between January 2011 and August
2014, the army approved 58 applications for West Bank residents to relocate to Gaza on
the condition they sign a pledge never to return to the West Bank. 223 In addition, between
2004 and 2017, the Israeli army removed back to Gaza more than 130 Palestinians from
Gaza living in the West Bank without a valid Israeli-issued permit, but apparently none in
the other direction. 224
These policies pressure Palestinians to leave the part of the OPT that authorities covet for
Jewish settlement—the West Bank—for the Gaza Strip, and join the more than 2 million
Palestinians who are effectively off the demographic balance sheet in the lands where
Jews reside. Without Gaza, the demographic ratio of Jews to Palestinians between the river
and the sea shifts from about 50-50 to a 59-41 Jewish majority.

In addition, Israeli officials have at times encouraged the emigration of Palestinians from
Gaza out of the OPT altogether. 225 In August 2019, a senior official apparently close to
of Palestinians from Gaza and would cover the emigration costs and even allow
Palestinians to use an Israeli airfield to leave for their new host countries. 226

Fragmentation
The fragmentation of Palestinian populations, in part deliberately created through the
separation policy between the West Bank and Gaza, the restrictions on movement between
East Jerusalem and the rest of the OPT, and the range of restrictions on residency rights,
serves as another tool of ensuring domination. In particular, fragmentation divides
populations and facilitates the demographic engineering that is key to preserving political
control by Jewish Israelis, and further frays political and social ties among Palestinians,
thereby weakening resistance to Israeli rule. 227

Conclusion
The pursuit by Israeli authorities of the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control vis-avis Palestinians over demographics and land in Israel and the OPT amounts to a “purpose”
or purposes “of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons
225 For example, the Israeli military government obtained lists from local Palestinian leaders (mukhtars) in Gaza of families

that had been separated and offered to pay the remaining family members to leave Gaza. According to US diplomatic records
from 1968, a teenage boy whose father had already left Gaza reported to the International Committee of the Red Cross that
Israeli military agents offered to pay 500 liras if he left with his mother and siblings. In addition, the Israeli military
encouraged emigration from Gaza by deciding that the standard of living in Gaza should be “reasonable” but only “close to
that which existed before the occupation;” according to one document, this meant that Israel would not create new sources
of income for refugees living in camps. Tom Segev, “The June 1967 War and the Refugee Problem,” Journal of Palestine

IV. Systematic Oppression and
Institutional Discrimination
The definition of the crime of apartheid under both the Apartheid Convention and Rome
Statute requires, in addition to the intent to dominate, systematic oppression, along with
the commission of inhumane acts.
As just outlined, the Israeli government pursues policies and practices in the OPT and
Israel that demonstrate its intent to maintain domination of Jewish Israelis over
Palestinians. However, the severity and means used vary according to location.
In the OPT, Israel methodically subjugates the more than 5 million Palestinians living
there. This chapter will show that these abusive policies are of such intensity that they
amount to “systematic oppression” for the purpose of the crime of apartheid.

movement, and encounter less severe policies and practices, but still face institutional

By contrast to the differences in the treatment of Palestinians, Israeli authorities grant all
Jewish Israelis the same rights and privileges regardless of which side of the Green Line
they live on. The effect, to varying degrees, is to privilege them over Palestinians in most
aspects of life, including with legal status, access to land and freedom to build, and
allocation of resources and services.

Systematic Oppression in the OPT
West Bank
Since they seized the West Bank on June 7, 1967, Israeli authorities have ruled over the
entire territory. That day, the army issued a proclamation establishing that its West Bank
area commander has “all legislative, executive and judicial powers” over the occupied
territory. 230 Since then, the army has issued hundreds of military orders governing many
aspects of everyday life, including regulating freedom of movement and access to land and
natural resources, except for in East Jerusalem, which Israel unilaterally annexed in 1967
and has governed under its civil law. 231 Israeli authorities have exclusive control over Area
C, comprising about 60 percent of the West Bank. Following its establishment in 1994, the
PA has managed some affairs in Areas A and B, which comprise the remaining 40 percent,
namely, education, health care, and other civil affairs. Israeli authorities, however, greatly
restrict its powers even in Areas A and B and retain primary control across the West Bank
over many aspects of the lives of Palestinians, including over borders, control of natural
resources, airspace, movement of people and goods, security, and the population registry.

Since 1967, Israeli authorities have established more than 280 settlements in the West
Bank, including 138 they formally recognize, and 150 “outposts”—settlements without
security—in the West Bank, as well as 12 settlements in East Jerusalem and several
settlement enclaves inside Palestinian neighborhoods in parts of East Jerusalem and
Hebron. 232 Authorities have done so in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention’s
prohibition against the transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population to occupied
territory. 233 Israeli authorities bar Palestinians in the West Bank from entering settlements,
except as laborers bearing special permits, 234 and nearly all settlers are Jewish Israelis.
Israeli authorities treat the more than 441,000 Israeli settlers and 2.7 million Palestinians
who reside in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, under distinct bodies of law. 235
They also treat the two population groups unequally on a range of issues, including
protection of civil and political rights; methods of law enforcement; freedom of movement;
freedom to build; and access to water, electricity, infrastructure, and other resources
and services.

Legal Status
Palestinians and Jewish Israelis living in the West Bank hold different legal statuses.
West Bank but that do not convey citizenship or nationality. 236 Only Palestinians
registered in the Israeli-controlled population registry are eligible to receive an identity
card or passport. Israeli authorities have refused to register, or denied residency to,
hundreds of thousands of West Bank Palestinians on the grounds that they were either
outside the territory when the occupation began in 1967 or spent time abroad between
1967 and 1994. 237 By contrast, Jewish Israelis living in the West Bank are Israeli citizens
who cannot lose that status no matter how many years they spend abroad.
Palestinians and settlers enjoy vastly different levels of freedom of movement. Israeli
authorities bar West Bank Palestinians from entering large sections of the West Bank itself
unless they have a difficult-to-obtain, time-limited permit. These sections include East
Jerusalem and nearby villages that Israel annexed in 1967, the “seam zone” between the
separation barrier and the Green Line, settlements, and areas authorities deem “closed
military zones.” 238 The separation barrier, slicing in some places through populated
Palestinian areas, restricts movement and cuts off many Palestinians from their
agricultural lands, while forcing 11,000 Palestinians living in the seam zone, who are
barred from entering Israel, to cross the separation barrier to access their own property
and some basic services. 239 Palestinians also face nearly 600 permanent obstacles to
movement, such as checkpoints and roadblocks, located inside the West Bank rather than

because they had fled during the 1967 war or were abroad for study, work or other reasons. In addition, authorities canceled
the residency of 130,000 West Bank Palestinians between 1967 and 1994, generally for being outside the West Bank for more
than three years. See Inhumane Acts and Other Abuses of Fundamental Rights section.

authorities to “exercise powers in the settlements without annexing them de jure.” 246 In
requiring that all government-sponsored bills specify that they apply to settlers in the West
Bank or otherwise justify why not, several pieces of Knesset legislation directly state that
they apply to settlers in the West Bank. 247
Israeli authorities also maintain parallel criminal justice systems for settlers and
Palestinians in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem. Israeli authorities try Palestinians
charged with crimes in military courts, where they face a conviction rate of nearly 100
percent. 248 By contrast, authorities have passed regulations that extend Israeli criminal
law on a personal basis to settlers, and grant Israeli courts jurisdiction over them, while
authorities have followed a longstanding policy not to prosecute Jewish settlers in military
courts. 249 The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) found in a 2014 report that “since
the 1980s, all Israeli citizens brought to trial before the military courts were Arab citizens
and residents of Israel.”

up to ten years in prison for attempting to influence public opinion in a manner that “may”

gathering of more than ten people without a permit on an issue “that could be construed
as political,” 254 while settlers can demonstrate without a permit unless it involves more

detention for longer periods and have a much wider latitude to keep Palestinians in

The laws governing children in detention also discriminate between Israelis and West Bank
Palestinians. Israeli civil law protects children against nighttime arrests, provides the right
to have a parent present during interrogations, and limits the amount of time children may
be detained before being able to consult a lawyer and to be presented before a justice. 261
In law and in practice, Palestinian children in the West Bank enjoy far fewer protections—
Israeli forces regularly arrest children during nighttime raids, interrogate them without a
guardian present, and hold those as young as 12 in lengthy pretrial detention. 262 ACRI

renewable periods that can extend for multiple years. 265 As of April 2021, according to the

prosecutions. 271 The Israeli rights group Public Committee Against Torture (PCATI)
reported in June 2019 that, of the more than 100 complaints of alleged torture it filed
over the last five years at the hands of Israel’s internal security service, Shin Bet, 31
percent involved physical violence, 40 percent painful and prolonged shackling or use of
stress positions, 66 percent sleep deprivation, 61 percent threats, and 27 percent sexual
harassment and humiliation. 272 Security forces also routinely use unnecessary force
against children during arrests, which often take place in the middle of the night, and
physically abuse them in custody. 273
Security forces also frequently raid populated Palestinian areas in the West Bank, even
Area A, where Israeli authorities ostensibly charged the PA with fully managing civil and
security affairs. Israeli forces routinely use excessive force, including live
ammunition, against Palestinian demonstrators, rock-throwers, suspected assailants,
and others in policing situations when lesser means could have been deployed. 274

Settlers, meanwhile, enjoy virtual impunity for criminal acts against Palestinians. Between
2005 and 2019, police closed 91 percent of the complaints tracked by the Israeli human
without indicting anyone. 277 The army not only systematically fails to intervene, but,
B’Tselem found, “they often provide the perpetrators escort and back-up. In some cases,
they even join in on the attack.” 278
Land and Housing
Since 1967 Israeli authorities have confiscated more than two million dunams of
Palestinian land in the West Bank, often to establish settlements and serve the needs of
Jewish Israeli settlers. Israeli authorities have used several different legal instruments to
confiscate land—as detailed in a later chapter of this report—among them designating
land, including land privately owned by Palestinians, as “state land.” 279
Israeli authorities have allocated 674,459 dunams of state land in the West Bank for Israeli
civilian use, primarily settlements, according to figures from the Israeli Civil Administration
obtained by Peace Now in June 2018. 280 This figure comprises 99.76 percent of the total
state land that Israeli authorities have officially allocated for use by third parties. The
remaining 0.24 percent, or about 1,600 dunams, went to Palestinians. Of this tiny fraction,
80 percent constituted “compensation” for lands taken for settlements and alternative
land allocated after the forcible transfer of Palestinian Bedouins from the land on which
they had lived. Authorities allocated the majority of this state land, 400,000 dunams in
total, to the World Zionist Organization (WZO), according to data provided to the groups
ACRI and Bimkom in March 2013. 281 The WZO’s Settlement Division defines its mission as

the 20-year period between 2000 and 2019, Israeli authorities approved only 245 building
permits for Palestinians in Area C, less than 4 percent of the number of applications
submitted. They issued 21 permits between 2016 and 2018, less than 1.5 percent of the
applications submitted. 284 Between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 5,817
Palestinian-owned structures, including homes, in the West Bank, mostly for lacking a
permit, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA). 285 B’Tselem documented 1,533 Palestinian homes demolished by authorities in
this period for lacking a permit, leaving 6,492 Palestinians displaced. 286 By contrast,
Israeli authorities offer a range of incentives, including housing benefits, business
subsidies (particularly in agriculture and industrial zones), budgetary perks, and tax
breaks to encourage Jewish Israelis to move to settlements. 287 In doing so, they have
steadily and unlawfully expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank for decades.
According to Peace Now, between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities began construction
on more than 23,696 units in West Bank settlements, excluding East Jerusalem. 288

Resources and Services
Israeli authorities retain primary control over resources and infrastructure and
systematically privilege Jewish Israeli settlers over Palestinians in the provision of roads,
water, electricity, health care, and other services. Even where Palestinians maintain a
degree of autonomy within their enclaves, they rely on infrastructure projects, including
roads, electricity towers, and water and sewage pipes that require Israeli-issued permits or
that cross through Israeli-controlled Area C.
Israeli authorities built the main network of roads in the West Bank, often at considerable
expense and on land expropriated from Palestinians, to bypass Palestinian populated
areas and connect settlements to the Israeli road network, to other settlements, and to
major metropolitan areas inside Israel. 290 According to B’Tselem, there are more than 40
kilometers of West Bank roads that authorities prohibit Palestinians from traveling on and
another 19 kilometers of West Bank roads, not including in Hebron, on which Palestinian
travel is restricted. 291 Israeli forces in Hebron prohibit Palestinians from walking on large
sections of what used to be the central thoroughfare of the city as part of a policy of
making those areas “sterile” of Palestinians, as per the parlance of the Israeli army. 292

To facilitate Palestinian travel between enclaves without using the bypass roads favored
by settlers, Israeli authorities established a rudimentary secondary road network for
alongside and underneath the “bypass roads” used by Israelis. 293 With gates at the
entrances and exits to Palestinian enclaves, authorities can, at will, shut down the network
and cut off traffic between different parts of the West Bank, creating what OCHA calls “an
adaptable system of control.” 294
Israeli authorities, for example, built in the 1980s a significant segment of Road 443 in the
West Bank, in part on expropriated Palestinian land, to offer an alternative route for
Israelis to commute between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. 295 Some landowners challenged the
confiscation, but the Supreme Court dismissed their petition, accepting the government’s
position that it built the road, which also historically connected Ramallah to villages to its
west, partly to serve the local Palestinian population. 296 In 2002, following attacks by
Palestinians on Israeli vehicles during the second Intifada, Israeli authorities banned
Palestinian vehicles from using the road for any purpose, with the then local Israeli army
commander declaring, “I made Route 443 an Israelis-only road.” 297 In 2007 and 2008, they
built “fabric of life” roads to make it easier for Palestinians to access Ramallah without
using Road 443. After years of litigation by Israeli rights groups, the Israeli army in 2010
reopened the road to Palestinian traffic.
However, the army kept in place checkpoints at each of the junctions that provide access
to Palestinian villages. They also maintained a checkpoint near Ofer prison, where soldiers

So while Palestinian drivers from the West Bank can formally use a large

section of Road 443, the checkpoints, by blocking access to Ramallah, render the road
useless for most Palestinians. Palestinians from the villages near Road 443 instead rely on
the “fabric of life” roads on which it takes them much longer to reach Ramallah or any
destination beyond the several other small villages located alongside the road.
Israeli authorities also maintain primary control over water resources in the West Bank and
allocate water in a discriminatory fashion to Palestinians. Two of Israel’s three major water
resources run largely through the West Bank: the Jordan River and the Mountain Aquifer,
which consists of three basins. The third, the Coastal Aquifer, runs along the coast of Israel
and Gaza. 299 Military orders established in the first 18 months of the occupation in 1967
and 1968 granted the army full authority over water-related issues in the West Bank, 300
declared water resources state property, 301 and barred Palestinians from establishing or
using water installations without a permit. 302 In 1982, Israeli authorities transferred
ownership of water resources and supply from the Civil Administration to the national
Israeli water company, Mekorot, while continuing to vest the Civil Administration with
regulatory control. 303
Israel has used its control over parts of the Mountain Aquifer in the West Bank to serve its
own citizens and settlers, in contravention of international humanitarian law which
prohibits occupiers from exploiting natural resources for its own economic benefit. While

80 percent of the Mountain Aquifer’s water recharge area lies beneath the West Bank, 304
Israel directly extracts about 90 percent of the water that is withdrawn from the aquifer
monopolizing this shared resource, Israeli authorities sharply restrict the ability of
Palestinians to directly exploit their own natural resources and render them dependent on
Israel for their water supply. For decades, authorities have denied Palestinians permits to
drill new wells, in particular in the most productive Western Aquifer basins, or to
rehabilitate existing ones. While the Oslo Accords of 1995 included provisions that
promised to increase Palestinian access to water, 306 Palestinian extraction levels have
largely remained at pre-Oslo levels while the population has increased. 307
Despite the establishment of a “Joint Water Commission” (JWC) as part of the Oslo
Accords, the World Bank in 2009 noted that Israel has retained “virtually all the power,”
including veto power, over the West Bank’s water resources. 308 While approving virtually
all requests for Israeli-proposed projects to serve settlers, the JWC has rejected many
Palestinian-initiated projects, including all requests to drill in the Western Aquifer
Basin. 309 Israelis are often permitted to drill deeper into the Aquifer, regularly develop
internal settlement water networks without seeking JWC approval, 310 and can extract water
without limit when it flows downstream into Israel without need for JWC approval, while

In addition, Israeli authorities have almost entirely deprived Palestinians access to water
from the Jordan River, the only major surface water resource in the West Bank, by diverting
its flow upstream of the West Bank. 313
Israeli policies in Area C further restrict Palestinian water access. The separation barrier,
for example, separates Palestinians from more than 20 wells in the “seam zone,” between
the barrier and the Green Line, limiting their ability to use these water sources, as well as
cutting them off from about 70 percent of the Western Aquifer Basin. 314 Authorities have
also denied permits for Palestinians to build water pipelines and demolished water
infrastructure built without permits. 315 Between 2009 and July 2019, Israeli authorities
demolished or seized 547 structures providing water and related sanitation services,
including cisterns, water pipes, and mobile latrines, according to OCHA. 316
These restrictions have made Palestinians dependent on purchasing water, in large part
extracted from under their land, from Mekorot. A 2013 UN Fact-Finding report found that
Mekorot supplies “almost half the water consumed by Palestinian communities” in the
West Bank. 317 Palestinians in many cases pay more for water than Israelis, at times
deriving from mark-ups in the price of the water sold to them, and in particular more than

Israel’s discriminatory water policies in the West Bank enable settlers to enjoy bountiful
water, while some Palestinian communities lack sufficient water to provide for their basic
needs. In 2017, Amnesty International documented how Israel’s drilling in the Jordan
Valley and prevention of local Palestinians from accessing some of their traditional water
sources had reduced the supply of water available to them. These restrictions, among
other factors, led some farmers to switch to crops that “are less water-intensive and also
less profitable” or even to abandon growing crops themselves, with some going to work in
nearby settlement farms with more plentiful water supply. 320 The World Bank in 2009
found that Israelis as a whole consume four times more water than Palestinians in the
West Bank. 321 Estimates indicate that settlers in the West Bank on average use at least
four times per capita the amount used by Palestinians living in the same territory. 322

Case Study: Salfit Governorate

The following case study details how Israeli authorities use oppressive means for the
purpose of establishing domination over the Palestinian governorate of Salfit in the West
Bank, abusing the rights of its residents to benefit Jewish Israeli settlers living nearby.
Salfit is one of eleven Palestinian governorates in the West Bank. It has a population of
81,162 and encompasses a cluster of hilltops and valleys in the northwest West Bank. 323
Salfit’s fertile lands, location atop the West Bank basin with the greatest water reserves,
high elevation, and proximity to Tel Aviv, a 30-minute drive away, has made the

governorate a strategic target for settlement activity. 324 Israeli authorities have seized
significant parts of the land, building a cluster of settlements centered around the urban
the center of the governorate, dividing Salfit’s Palestinians into three disconnected
pockets of villages, and separating the town of Salfit, the governorate’s administrative and
commercial center, from other villages to the north. 325 Residents of these communities
face regular land confiscations, restricted access to agricultural land, movement
restrictions, settler violence, and sewage run-offs from the nearby settlements.
The cluster of settlements grew out of a 1977 Israeli government plan formulated by Ariel
Sharon, then agriculture minister and chairperson of the Ministerial Committee for
Settlement Affairs, to fortify Israeli control in the western West Bank. As former Israeli
official and analyst Shaul Arieli put it, the plan, in particular, sought to, “create a Jewish
barrier” between Palestinian population centers and “control key hilltops overlooking the
coastal plain [inside Israel].” 326
A 1997 plan by the WZO’s Settlement Division highlights the “attractiveness” of this area,
which it refers to as “western Samaria,” “as a residential area for people who are
employed in the center of the country.” 327 Noting its “close proximity to centers of
employment, services, and the existing culture of the coastal plain,” it describes how it
offers a “valve” to “release the urban pressures of the coastal plain.” 328
The plan also describes the strategic value of the road network it calls the “Trans-Samaria
corridor.” The corridor consists primarily of Highway 5, which starts in northern Tel Aviv
and runs east across the Green Line to Ariel, where it meets Road 505, which continues

which runs north-south through the Jordan Valley. The plan justifies the need for ‘lateral
cause the coastal plain to be cut off from the Jordan Valley and the fragmenting of Israeli
settlement zones in Judea and Samaria.” 329 While Israeli settlers commute daily from Ariel
to inside Israel without facing any major checkpoints, authorities have rendered a fourkilometer segment of the highway off-limits to Palestinian vehicles, according
to B’Tselem. 330
The cluster of settlements also lies above the most productive section of the Mountain
Aquifer, the Western Aquifer Basin. 331 Israeli authorities though have effectively blocked
Palestinians in Salfit from extracting water from the Aquifer, creating a water deficit in the
governorate. With few other options, the Salfit governate purchases the vast majority of its
water from Mekorot. 332
Twenty-four largely contiguous Israeli settlements and settlement zones, more than the
number of Palestinian communities there, sprawl across the hilltops of the governorate. 333
Ariel, one of the more populous settlements in the West Bank with a population of
20,500, 334 lies at the eastern edge of the cluster of settlements. The settlement,

3,000 of whom reside there, 337 with a difficult-to-obtain permit from the army. 338
Israeli authorities have built three fences around Ariel since its establishment, in each
case expanding the areas enclosed: the first in the 1980s, a second in 1993, and most
recently the separation barrier in 2004. Israel confiscated some private land to build the
barriers and, in other cases, effectively fenced off thousands more dunams from their
Palestinian owners, who are now subject to a complex set of administrative restrictions on
accessing their land. In 2004, the separation barrier around Ariel separated Palestinians in
Salfit from 9,000 dunams (900 hectares) of their land – 3,500 dunams (350 hectares)
belong to more than 200 farmers from Salfit, with the remainder belonging to residents
from the nearby villages of Haris, Kifl Haris, Iskaka, Marda, and Qira. 339
Human Rights Watch in 2014 and 2015 interviewed fourteen farmers from Salfit and the
village of Marda, just north of Ariel, who own land that Israeli authorities either confiscated
or restricted their access to in order to build settlements or fences or as a result of their
construction. The farmers who maintained ownership of their land can access it only with
prior permission of the Israeli army, which often only permits them to do so two or three
times a year for a limited number of days. In each case, the farmers described how Israeli
restrictions, including how often they could cultivate the land and what equipment they
could use, drastically reduced the productivity of their harvest and even limited what crops
they could grow. Two farmers stopped cultivating all or part of their land altogether,
despite their fears that Israel may designate it as state land on the basis that Palestinians
have not continuously cultivated it.” 340

A farmer from the village of Marda told Human Rights Watch in 2015 that his father owned
more than 1,000 dunams, but he lost almost all of it over the years to Ariel. “They took it
little by little,” he said. “In the beginning [in 1978 and 1979], they took 100 dunams and
put caravans there. In the 1980s, they put a barbed wire fence around more land; they
didn’t confiscate the land but declared it a closed military zone. Then they started building
on it. Each time they would move the fence [to encompass more land], they would say it’s
for security reasons.” The farmer said he filed a complaint each time to an Israeli military
court, producing all the required evidence of ownership, yet he lost each of the cases. At
the time, he said, only 60 dunams remained, 30 of which are behind the separation barrier
built in 2004, and which the Israeli army only allows him access to twice a year. 341
Northwest of the cluster of settlements around Ariel, the Palestinian village of Mas-ha has
faced regular land confiscations since the 1970s. In 1978, the Israeli army seized land in
Mas-ha for “military purposes.” 342 In subsequent years, they declared lands around Masha “state land” and allocated it to establish the settlement of Elkana in large part on

agricultural lands belonging to Mas-ha residents. 343 In 2002, authorities expropriated
more land to build the separation barrier, cutting residents from some of their land. In
400-500 dunams of land about two kilometers from their house, but now located beyond
the barrier and inside Elkana. A family member said that authorities confiscated some of
their land and that they now need permits to access the remainder of it. The permits only
allow them to enter through a designated gate that only opens twice a day, for 15-30
minutes each time. Reaching their land via the gate involves a two hour and 20 kilometer
detour. 344
Settlements wreak havoc on the daily life of residents in other ways. Two landowners from
Bruqin, a village in an isolated pocket south of the cluster of settlements, told Human
Rights Watch that soldiers have for the past 20 years blocked residents from accessing 100
dunams of land they own next to the settlement of Bruchin, southwest of Ariel. 345 Settlers
have also placed mobile caravans on the land. One of the landowners, 60-year-old farmer
Jamal Salameh, said he has since 2017 regularly sought, in vain, the Civil Administration’s
assistance to access this plot of land, where he has a well and used to grow wheat
and barley. 346
Salameh owns another small plot of land on the other side of Bruchin that he said settlers
have attacked on multiple occasions, including in 2011 when they torched hundreds of
olive trees that he planted in 1986, and at least four times in March and April 2020 amid
the significant movement restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. “The army
has handed the reins to the settlers. I haven’t seen the army in this area for the past two
years,” he said, noting that other landowners from Bruqin have stopped even trying to
access their land in this area due to the frequent settler attacks. He also recounted a 2016

land, which includes the archaeological site of Deir Samaan, that the settlements of
Leshem and Alei Zahav gradually came to surround on three sides. In 2011, Israeli
authorities closed the agricultural road that led to his plot of land without notice or
explanation, he said. He told Human Rights Watch that the army permitted him to build
another one at his own expense, but a year after he had done so at significant expense,
they sealed off the new road with a gate. 348 This forces him to park his car on the main
road and walk uphill 700 meters to reach his plot of land. Settlers also regularly trespass
onto his land to swim in natural pools located there, during which time he said his family
must “stay away” to avoid confrontation. In one incident in 2019, he said settlers uprooted
13 of their fig and olive trees.
Ad-Dik owns a second plot of land in the village that before 2010 took him five minutes by
car to reach. In 2010, however, authorities began construction of the settlement of Leshem
under the guise of expanding the nearby settlement of Alei Zahav, 349 which blocked the
road to his land. Now he said reaching his land involves driving through two nearby
villages and walking through a valley where sewage from nearby settlements flow, a
journey that takes more than an hour. Due to the difficulty and length of the journey, he
said his 70-year-old mother has not visited the property in seven years and he himself only
goes once or twice a year. He added that, without being able to transport equipment, he
has not been able to plant anything new there. The sewage, he said, leaves his property
“surrounded by sewage” from three directions. 350

Across the governorate, raw sewage and untreated industrial chemical waste from
settlements and industrial zones flows into residential areas and around water sources,
B’Tselem documented how Ariel’s wastewater had since the mid-1990s flowed south
towards the city of Salfit where it merged with Salfit’s sewage and flows westward into
Bruqin and Kufr ad-Dik. 352 The group documented how Ariel’s wastewater plant ceased
functioning altogether in 2008, after more than a decade of unheeded warnings by Israeli
environmental authorities about the plant’s condition. 353 It has remained dysfunctional
since; 354 a 2016 Israeli government publication noted that its efficiency is “low” with
“effluent channeled into irrigation and the Shilo river.” 355 Salfit has sought for more than
two decades to build a wastewater treatment plant, even securing funding for the project,
but Israeli authorities continually frustrated their efforts, once claiming the location would
be too close to Ariel, 356 and another time conditioning approval on agreeing to treat Ariel’s
wastewater, 357 a condition Palestinians often refuse since it would imply effective
recognition of settlements. In 2019, though, the Salfit municipality obtained approval to

A report published by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) and the Palestinian Hydrology Group in 2011 said that the Barkan Industrial Area
settlement, near Ariel, “is notorious for flushing its leftover chemical waste onto Salfit
villages.”

359

The report further states that “this chemical waste is thought to include

petrochemicals, metals and plastic” and notes that “heavy toxic metals are linked to an
endless list of conditions, from diarrhoea to diabetes, hyperkeratosis, organ failure and
cancer.” 360 During the rainy season, according to B’Tselem, the sewage flows from Ariel
downstream into springs and valleys, overflowing Salfit’s central pumping station. 361 A
Bruqin municipality employee, Murad Samara, told Human Rights Watch that in al-Matwi
valley, between Salfit and Bruqin, sewage from Ariel and Salfit flows through a valley
where at least 50 families live. 362 People in the community worried that exposure to
sewage and chemical waste was making people sick. May Barakat, a mother of four who
lives in the valley, told Human Rights Watch that “the smell in the valley is deadly” and
that her three-year-old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago. She said that
she stopped allowing her children to play outside after one of them fell into the sewage
several years prior. 363

including the eastern part of Jerusalem and land that belonged to 28 surrounding West
Bank villages, to the Jerusalem municipality. Human Rights Watch is not aware of any

another for Palestinians on virtually all aspects of everyday life.

Israeli authorities designate Palestinians from East Jerusalem as “permanent residents,”

derives from their physical presence in Jerusalem; the Interior Ministry has withdrawn it

from at least 14,701 Palestinians since 1967, largely for failing to prove a “center of life”

A path to citizenship exists for Palestinian Jerusalemite residents, but the vast majority
have chosen not to pursue it, as it recognizes Israel, the occupying power, as the
legitimate sovereign. Moreover, the vast majority of those who applied did not receive
citizenship. 372 As permanent residents, Palestinian Jerusalemites who are not citizens can
vote in municipal elections, but not in national Israeli elections. 373
In contrast, Jewish Israelis from Jerusalem, including settlers in East Jerusalem, are Israeli
citizens and do not have to prove that they maintain connections to the city in order to
safeguard their legal status. Israeli authorities have not revoked the legal status of a single
Jewish Israeli for failing to prove a “center of life” in Jerusalem. Jewish Israelis living in all
parts of Jerusalem also vote in both municipal and national elections.

may petition the Interior Ministry to recover their status, during which time they can obtain a temporary status to remain in

While Palestinians and Jewish Jerusalemites are subject to the same criminal law,
discrimination underlies policing in the city. Across Jerusalem, 77 percent of children
Jerusalem’s population. 374 B’Tselem observed that police violence “is part of Israel’s
policy…to ensure Jewish supremacy in the city.” 375 For example, Israeli authorities
arrested, according to B’Tselem, more than 850 Palestinians, mostly children, many of
whom were beaten, from the neighborhood of Issawiya in East Jerusalem between April
2019 and April 2020. 376 B’Tselem described these arrests in Issawiya as part of “an
ongoing campaign of abuse and collective punishment against its residents,” 377
documenting how police forces regularly entered the neighborhood to “initiate ‘friction’…
block the narrow streets, fire stun grenades, tear gas and sponge rounds and arrest and
beat residents.” 378 The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which has reported on near-daily raids,
patrols, checkpoints, and ambushes in Issawiya, and described the policy as one of
“collective punishment,” 379 found that only a “tiny fraction” of those arrested have been
charged with stone-throwing or other offenses. 380
In addition, the separation barrier cuts through East Jerusalem, separating Palestinian
communities in at least three ways. First, it places tens of thousands of Palestinian
Jerusalemites living in areas such as Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp on the West
Bank side of the barrier, separating them from the rest of East Jerusalem. 381 Second, the

barrier traps some West Bank Palestinians on the Jerusalem side, for example in Nabi
Samuel. West Bank Palestinian residents of these areas are effectively forbidden from
and must cross a checkpoint to attend school or work or go to the grocery store or
hospital. 382 Third, the barrier creates various fully encircled enclaves in the West Bank, for
example in Bir Nabala, that are connected to other Palestinian communities only by “fabric
of life” roads. 383
Land and Housing
Since 1967 Israeli authorities have expropriated from Palestinians nearly one-third of the
land in East Jerusalem, comprising at least 23,378 dunams, largely for settlements. 384 As
with the rest of the West Bank, Israeli authorities have since 1967 frozen the land
registration process for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, while registering land in East
Jerusalem settlements throughout the entire period. 385 The freeze puts the land of
Palestinians who had not registered it by 1967 at risk of confiscation and also makes it
difficult for them to obtain building permits. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim estimated in a
2015 report that half the land in East Jerusalem is not registered. 386
Beyond formal state confiscation, discriminatory laws and policies enable settler and
settler organizations to take possession of Palestinian homes, evict the Palestinian
landowners, and transfer their property to Jewish owners in East Jerusalem
neighborhoods. 387 They have done so based on a 1970 law that requires authorities to
return to Jewish owners or their heirs property they owned in East Jerusalem prior to 1948

and that was held by Jordanian authorities between 1948 and 1967. 388 By contrast,
authorities have largely allowed the takeover of the land and homes of Palestinians in
Palestinians who were expelled or fled as a result of the onset of the Israeli occupation in
1967, by declaring it as “absentee property.” 389
The Ateret Cohanim settler organization, for example, has filed dozens of eviction lawsuits
against around 100 Palestinian families living in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan in East
Jerusalem, claiming that their homes belonged to a Jewish property trust that had housed
Yemeni Jews in the late 19th century. 390 Ateret Cohanim aims to create a Jewish
neighborhood in the heart of Silwan, putting 700 Palestinians at risk of eviction. 391
Jerusalem magistrate courts ruled in favor of Ateret Cohanim in several of these suits in
2020, ordering the eviction of families who had lived there for decades. 392 In June 2020, a
Jerusalem court ruled in favor of the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in an eviction proceeding

That, combined with the Law and Administration Procedures Act passed in 1970 by the Knesset, have empowered the
Custodian of Absentee Property to determine whether East Jerusalem properties qualified as “absentee properties.” The

Israeli authorities have made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building
permits in East Jerusalem, in particular outside built-up neighborhoods that make up less
than 15 percent of East Jerusalem and 8.5 percent of the Jerusalem municipality. 395
According to Peace Now, “while the government has initiated planning, appropriation of land
for construction, tenders for the construction of more than 55,000 housing units for Israelis
in East Jerusalem since 1967, the Palestinians have seen government-initiated construction
of only 600 housing units (in the 1970s).” 396 As a result, most Palestinian construction in
East Jerusalem is based on private rather than state initiatives. Municipal planners between
1991 and 2018 approved only 9,536 building permits for Palestinians, while approving
48,201 in Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem, including 21,834 in settlements. 397
Between 2009 and 2020, Israeli authorities demolished 1,434 structures in East

Resources and Services
Israeli authorities sharply discriminate in the provision of resources and services between
Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in Jerusalem. While most Palestinian neighborhoods have
poor infrastructure and inadequate health, recreation, and educational services and
facilities, most predominantly Jewish neighborhoods have well-paved roads, numerous
parks and playgrounds, adequate refuse collection, and sufficient places for children in
schools. 401 In January 2016, the Jerusalem district court ordered the municipality to build
more playgrounds in the Palestinian neighborhoods of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, after
residents of those neighborhoods alleged that they only had two playgrounds to serve a
combined population of 60,000, while nearby Jewish neighborhoods had a playground for
every 1,000 residents. 402
The Jerusalem municipality in 2013 allocated only 10.1 percent of its municipal budget for
projects and spending in Palestinian neighborhoods, according to the Israeli rights group Ir
Amim, despite Palestinians making up about 37 percent of the city’s population at the time
and paying taxes. 403 Ir Amim estimated in 2020 that Palestinians in East Jerusalem faced a
shortage of 3,794 classrooms; while some shortages also existed in Jewish communities, in

The discriminatory allocation of resources contributes to the starkly different realities

families live below the poverty line, as compared to 26 percent of Jewish families. 406
Despite this, the Israeli government maintains six welfare offices, or offices that provide
information to residents looking to receive government aid or other services, in Palestinian
neighborhoods, but 19 in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods. 407 Thirty-two percent of

Case Study: Kufr Aqab

The following case study details how Israeli authorities have discriminated against
Palestinians living in Kufr Aqab on the outskirts of East Jerusalem mainly through building
the separation barrier between it and the rest of the city in 2002 and then largely
neglecting the needs of residents. The situation in Kufr Aqab differs from the more
common policies and practices that institutionally discriminate against Palestinians of
Jerusalem but represents a different method by which an oppressively discriminatory
system results in rights abuses for Palestinians living in East Jerusalem.
The separation barrier cuts off Kufr Aqab, a Palestinian town that largely falls at the
northernmost edge of the boundaries of the Israeli-demarcated Jerusalem municipality,

After the 1967 war, Israel annexed most of Kufr Aqab, including the then Jerusalem airport
and the neighborhoods of Samiramis and Zghayyar that have historically been a part of
into the Jerusalem municipality, apparently to bring the airport under its control. 410
Annexation, though, split the town into two parts, with about 40 percent remaining outside
the territory that Israel incorporated and today falling within Area C of the West Bank,
where Israel maintains full civil and security control. 411 Kufr Aqab’s municipal council
formally serves the part of the town outside Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries, but, in
practice, also engages residents in the Jerusalem part. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian
authorities maintain precise population figures for Kufr Aqab; estimates range between
70,000 and 100,000, 412 while Kufr Aqab’s municipal council maintains that the actual
figure is around 120,000. 413
In the 1980s, Israeli authorities confiscated 1,415 dunams from Kufr Aqab as state land and

In 2002, Israeli authorities, citing security reasons, built in the Jerusalem area a segment
of the separation barrier more than 200 kilometers long. The Israeli rights group Ir Amim
noted that its route “adds to Jerusalem the Jewish population that lives in the settlement
blocs outside of the city’s municipal area[,] in addition to a very large area of land outside
them,” while it “subtracts the Palestinian population that lives in those areas from
Jerusalem.” 419 Running between Kufr Aqab and the strip where the airport once was, in
part on Kufr Aqab’s land, the barrier separates residents from Jerusalem and over 500
dunams of the town’s own agricultural lands, according to Kufr Aqab municipal council
officials. 420 The barrier runs south to the Qalandiya checkpoint, the main crossing between
Ramallah and Jerusalem, which Kufr Aqab residents, the majority of whom hold Jerusalem
IDs, must cross to reach the rest of Jerusalem. With Ramallah to the north, the Qalandiya

Beyond physically separating Palestinians from one another, the building of the barrier
coincided with the Israeli government’s effective abandonment of governance and law
Aqab, 422 and, as acknowledged in a 2008 State Comptroller report, maintain “no police
operations to enforce or maintain order” there. 423 Munir Zghayyar, chair of the Kufr Aqab
Residents Committee, told Human Rights Watch that he is not aware of a single incident of
Israeli police entering Kufr Aqab since 2001 and that, even when residents cross the
checkpoint and go in-person to a police station, authorities often do not intervene. 424 The
army, charged since 2006 with responsibility for security in Kufr Aqab, at times enters Kufr
Aqab to carry out security operations and arrests, even though it defines the area as falling
within Israel’s sovereign territory and thus not under military rule. 425
With the PA barred under the Oslo Accords from operating in Kufr Aqab, these policies create
what OCHA has called “a security vacuum manifested in an increase in lawlessness, crime
and drug trafficking,” 426 and offer fertile ground for fugitives from the PA police. 427 Three
Kufr Aqab residents told Human Rights Watch that they regularly hear gunfire, so much so
that one resident’s family grew “afraid to go on the balcony.” 428 Another said, “I am always
afraid—anything can happen and who am I supposed to turn to when it does?” 429 In the
absence of law enforcement, Zghayyar, the Residents Committee chair, said some of the
larger families living there have taken it upon themselves to adjudicate disputes. 430

Israeli authorities have also since the building of the barrier effectively stopped regulating
construction. Municipal authorities approved a plan for Kufr Aqab in 2005, but Ir Amim
municipal council both told Human Rights Watch that authorities have not issued a
building permit for the area since 2001. 432 Moien Odeh, a lawyer who has brought cases
on behalf of Kufr Aqab and a former resident, said that residents used to have to get a
difficult-to-obtain permit to “build anything,” but, following the outbreak of the second

Intifada and the building of the barrier, authorities suggested off-hand to some contractors
and residents that they did not need a permit and residents eventually stopped
applying. 433 Ir Amim quoted the director of the municipality’s building inspection division
in a June 2015 report as acknowledging that the municipality is not monitoring or enforcing
construction there. 434 Ir Amim also determined that the division had not entered Kufr Aqab
in a decade. 435
The lack of regulation in Kufr Aqab stands in sharp contrast to the government’s policy of
sharply restricting building in other Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and
carrying out thousands of home demolitions since 1967. 436 Amid the housing crunch and
difficulty of building in Palestinian neighborhoods inside the separation barrier, many
Palestinian Jerusalemites have moved to Kufr Aqab, where, according to Zghayyar,
property costs one-third less. 437

Kufr Aqab has since the building of the barrier attracted Jerusalemites married to
Palestinians from other parts of the West Bank, who under Israel’s Citizenship and Entry into
Jerusalem resident. 438 Since Kufr Aqab falls within the Jerusalem municipality, Jerusalemites
living there can claim that they live in the city and not lose their residency on that basis.
Scores of Palestinians have since 1967 moved to other parts of the West Bank. 439 At the
same time, its location beyond the barrier and lack of law enforcement means that West
Bank residents can live there without crossing an Israeli checkpoint.
Because of Israel’s discriminatory system, Palestinian “mixed” couples from Jerusalem
and the West Bank can with few exceptions live together legally on a long-term, secure
basis only in neighborhoods like Kufr Aqab. By contrast, Jewish “mixed” couples, including
Jerusalemites married to West Bank settlers, can freely live anywhere in Israel, East
Jerusalem, and the West Bank settlements.
A Palestinian woman said she lived for four years in a Jerusalem neighborhood inside the
separation barrier apart from her husband, who is from Hebron and has been unable to get
permits to enter Jerusalem. During this time, she had to raise their three children alone, in
order to maintain a “center of life” in the city and thereby her residency. 440 When she
learned that she could both do that and live with her husband in Kufr Aqab, she said they
moved there in 2006 and they have remained since. Her daughter, though, continued to
attend school across the barrier, crossing the Qalandiya checkpoint daily. She said her
family did not wish to remain in Kufr Aqab, citing the difficulty of life there, but had no
other options.
High demand and lack of regulation in Kufr Aqab have driven a “rapid and informal
increase in residential construction, particularly high-rise buildings.” 441 Built without
properly vetted plans or oversight, and often within meters of each other, many buildings
rise 10-12 stories high, lack adequate infrastructure for “water, drainage, sewage,

adds that this sort of construction creates a reality where no one knows the boundaries
built without a permit, according to a municipal council employee involved in
inspections, 444 have been constructed on land reaching up the barrier, taking up virtually
all the area available for public spaces, and contributing to population density. 445 An
official from the municipal council observed that the only place left to build is “towards
the sky.” 446
Although Jerusalemites living in Kufr Aqab pay the same municipal taxes as those living
in other Jerusalem neighborhoods, “public infrastructure, resources and services are
significantly degraded or lacking entirely.” 447 In February 2015, the municipality’s deputy
legal advisor acknowledged to Ir Amim that “the Municipality encounters difficulties”
servicing Kufr Aqab. 448 Kufr Aqab has no government buildings beyond an Interior
Ministry office at the Qalandiya checkpoint, and no emergency health or fire, banking, or
welfare services. 449 As a result, residents generally have to cross Qalandiya checkpoint,
where waits often take an hour or more to access most municipal services. According to
Zghayyar, the Residents Committee Chair, about 3,800 children also cross the
checkpoint on schooldays to attend class on the other side of the wall, given the
relatively few schools built inside Kufr Aqab. 450 Israel’s national emergency service,
Magen David Adom, generally does not service areas beyond the barrier like Kufr

In 2006 the Israeli government established the Jerusalem Envelope Administration (JEA) to
oversee communities within the Jerusalem municipality but beyond the separation barrier,
mainly Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp, in addition to several smaller
communities. 453 UN OCHA estimated in 2016 that about 160,000 Palestinians live in these
areas. 454 According to Ir Amim, these areas receive only a fraction of the budget allocated
to other Jerusalem neighborhoods. 455 The group said that the JEA has “effectively served to
distance residents from the Municipality,” which often refers residents to the JEA. The JEA,
in turn, often informs them that they do not have the funding to implement necessary
projects. 456 The former head of the JEA acknowledged to Ir Amim the government’s
“neglect,” as he put it, of these areas and has spoken of the “lawlessness” there, noting
that “there is no government presence in [Kufr Aqab] for the purposes of public order.” 457
Ir Amim noted one exception to the neglect of the area: private investigators hired by the
government to verify that residents actually live there for the purposes of probing their
residency status. 458
Even when the municipality provides services, it largely fails to meet the needs of
residents. The municipality, for example, contracts the task of garbage collection to a

is to serve. 459 A lawsuit filed by Kufr Aqab residents against the municipality alleged that,
in 2012, Jerusalem spent about 328 million NIS on garbage collection, but only around 2
the city’s boundaries housing a percentage of the city’s population likely at least six times
higher. 460 The municipality increased the budget following the suit, 461 but Odeh, the
lawyer who filed it, said that the collection schedule still does not meet the needs of
residents, who often resort to burning their trash. 462
Ir Amim further estimated in 2015 that 10 out of 25 kilometers of roads in Kufr Aqab are
unpaved, eight are in “dilapidated condition,” and only four are paved and “in reasonable
condition.” Even paved ones, they noted, “lack sidewalks, signage, and pedestrian
crossings,” and the “only traffic light in Kufr Aqab is permanently broken.” 463 Documents
from the municipality cited by Odeh in a petition he filed show that, in 2015, less than 0.02
percent of the municipal budget for roads went to Kufr Aqab and other communities
outside the barrier. 464 Some roads have been renovated since 2015, but the overall
condition of roads remains poor. 465
The poor condition of the roads compounds the already heavy traffic in Kufr Aqab, which is
bisected by the main road connecting Ramallah with the south West Bank, including cities
of Bethlehem, Hebron, and Jerusalem, via the Qalandiya checkpoint. According to a
statement by Israeli authorities quoted by Reuters in April 2017, about 26,000 people
cross the Qalandiya checkpoint daily. 466 Due to consistently heavy traffic, it can take up to

Poor infrastructure, in particular, a run-down water pipeline system, also causes

national water company, supplies water to most neighborhoods in Jerusalem, including
settlements, the Palestinian-run Jerusalem Water Undertaking, which operates in
Ramallah and nearby areas, services Kufr Aqab, as it did before 1967, and struggles to

Lawmakers in 2017 introduced legislation at the Knesset that would separate communities
beyond the separation barrier from the Jerusalem municipality and establish a separate
local authority to govern them. 471 The legislation has not advanced, but residents
expressed concern that the law represents the government’s long-term designs for these
areas. Authorities have long pursued a policy to box in, separate, and exert pressure on
Palestinian Jerusalemites to live beyond the barrier. The draft law threatens to take things
one step further, opening the door to removing residents of Kufr Aqab and other areas
beyond the barrier from Jerusalem’s demographic calculus altogether to preserve a Jewish
majority there.

1995 Oslo Accords. 472 Israel’s withdrawal of its ground troops and settler population in
2005 reduced its day-to-day control and allowed Palestinian authorities to exercise more
autonomy within Gaza than they had before. In 2007, Hamas authorities seized power from
the Fatah-led PA in Gaza.
Israeli authorities, however, have remained in critical ways the supreme power,
dominating the coastal strip through other means. 473 Israel controls Gaza’s territorial
waters and airspace and has blocked the building of an airport and seaport, significantly
complicating efforts to travel abroad. 474 Israel also controls the movement of people and
goods into and out of Gaza, except for at Gaza’s border with Egypt, which the Egyptian
government also significantly restricts. Israel controls all transit between Gaza and the
West Bank and maintains a “policy of separation” between the two parts of the OPT. 475 It
controls the Palestinian population registry, which determines eligibility for establishing
legal residency and obtaining an ID card. 476 It sets the rates for the customs and valueadded taxes that it collects on behalf of the PA on goods entering the common market. 477
It enforces a so-called “no-go” zone inside Gaza, near Israeli territory. 478 It controls the
infrastructure upon which Gaza relies, including electricity lines, the underwater cable that
phone calls are placed on, the network that provides internet, and the frequencies
assigned to Palestinian cell phone companies. 479

In light of these controls that Israel exercises over the lives and welfare of Palestinians in
Gaza, Israel remains bound to provide them with the rights and protections afforded to
them by the law of occupation, as the ICRC and UN have both determined. 480 Israeli
authorities have consistently failed to meet their obligations as an occupying power.

480 Both the ICRC and the UN continue to refer to Gaza as occupied territory. Email from Yves Sorokobi, Office of the UN

Secretary General Spokesperson, to Gisha, February 7, 2007, on file with Human Rights Watch. “The UN welcomed the Israeli
disengagement from Gaza in August 2005. However, there has been no change in our characterization of the Gaza Strip as
occupied territory.” See ICRC, “Gaza Closure Not Another Year!”, June 14,

The Egyptian government often imposes restrictions along its border with Gaza, which
exacerbate the impact of Israel’s policies on residents of Gaza, but Egypt’s obligations
differ since it is not the occupying power and can, with some key limitations, decide whom

Given international consensus around and Israeli recognition of Gaza and the West Bank
comprising a single territorial unit, the OPT, Human Rights Watch assesses dynamics in
Gaza as part of the OPT, despite Israel’s “separation policy.” Viewed in that light, the
severe repression of Palestinians in Gaza stands in marked contrast to the treatment of
Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israeli authorities deny Palestinians in
the OPT, including in Gaza, basic rights and services that they provide Israeli settlers living
in the same legal territory, including freedom of movement, the right to live with or visit
loved ones living in that territory, and access to 24-hour electricity and clean water.
Legal Status
Palestinians in Gaza, like those in the West Bank, hold Israeli-issued identity cards and
passports that grant them residency in Gaza, but they do not have citizenship or
nationality. About 70 percent of Gaza’s nearly 2.1 million residents are refugees forced to
flee their homes in what became Israel, or their descendants, who have been denied their
right to return to the areas where they or their families once lived. 482 Israeli authorities
struck from the registry thousands of Palestinians from Gaza who were not present in the
territory in 1967 when the occupation began, either because they had fled during the
fighting or were already abroad, as well as more than 100,000 between 1967 and 1994 who
had been abroad for long periods. 483 Palestinians not in the population registry cannot

Until 2005, the Israeli army ruled directly over Gaza, while applying Israeli civil law to the
more than 7,500 Jewish settlers who lived there. 485 Following the withdrawal of those
settlers in 2005 and the takeover by Hamas in 2007, Israel declared Gaza “hostile
territory” 486 and tightened movement restrictions, imposing a generalized ban on travel to
the rest of the OPT or abroad, irrespective of any individualized risk assessment for a
particular person. That ban applies to all Palestinians except those whom Israeli
authorities deem as presenting “exceptional humanitarian circumstances.” 487 This
closure, alongside Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza, has remained in place
since 2007 and has separated families and restricted residents from accessing medical
care and educational and economic opportunities. 488 By contrast, Israeli settlers in the
OPT enjoy freedom of movement across much of the OPT, including to East Jerusalem and
West Bank settlements, as well as to Israel and abroad.
The shifts that took place between 2005 and 2007 altered the mechanisms but not the fact of
Israeli control of the Gaza Strip, nor the systematic oppression of its population. The
withdrawal of settlers and regular ground forces from Gaza shifted Israel’s practice from one
focused on raids and arrests as in the West Bank to one built on the periodic use of
overwhelming military force, often with devastating consequences for the civilian population.
In the period since 2007, the Israeli army conducted several large-scale military offensives
in Gaza, including in 2008-09, 2012, and 2014, and clashed scores of times with
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza. During these confrontations, Israeli forces regularly

threat to life. These practices stem from a decades-long pattern that has changed little
since the outbreak of the first Palestinian Intifada in 1987 of using excessive force to quell
incidents over the years, Israeli authorities have failed to develop law enforcement tactics
that comport with international human rights norms, which prohibit the use of lethal force
except in situations when it is necessary to prevent an imminent threat of death or serious
injury. 501 Israeli authorities have often justified these tactics in the name of protecting
Israeli communities on the other side of the Gaza fence from the possibility of harm, 502 but

Further confining the Palestinians of Gaza, Israeli authorities have established a “buffer
zone” inside Gaza, as opposed to on its side of the fences that they have built separating
Gaza from Israel. The Israeli army told the Israeli rights group Gisha in August 2015 that it
forbids Gaza residents from approaching within 300 meters of the fence, except for those
farmers whom it permits to approach within 100 meters of the fence. 504 Israeli forces
routinely fire on those who enter or approach the “buffer zone.” Between 2010 and 2017,

Citing concerns about weapons smuggling, Israeli authorities also restrict how much of the
sea, including Gaza’s territorial waters, residents can access. For years, they generally
permitted Palestinians to venture up to six nautical miles off the coast, though subject to
frequent fluctuations; for a short period in 2019, they extended the limit to 15 nautical
miles, though at other times barred access entirely. 511 Israel has not justified these
fluctuations in the fishing zone on security grounds, but rather as punitive measures in
response to rocket fire or the launching of incendiary balloons by armed Palestinian
groups, acts with which fishermen had no involvement. 512 Between 2010 and 2017, the

Resources and Services
Discriminatory restrictions and burdens imposed by Israeli authorities restrict the entry
and exit of goods in and out of Gaza and limit the access of Gazans to basic services, such
as electricity and water.
The 13-year-old closure sharply restricts the movement of goods. Following Hamas’s
takeover in 2007 and Israel’s declaration of Gaza as “hostile territory,” 515 Israeli
authorities between September 2007 and May 2010 banned most civilian goods from
entering Gaza, including coriander, paper, and chocolate. 516 Israeli authorities in January
2008 calculated the minimum number of calories per person that Gaza residents needed
to avoid malnutrition, although they insist they never implemented a policy based on the
calculation. 517 Israeli officials said at the time that they wanted to keep Gaza’s economy
“on the brink of collapse” while avoiding a humanitarian crisis. 518
Since 2010, Israeli authorities have allowed most everyday goods to enter, but sharply
restrict and often prohibit altogether what they deem “dual-use” items or those that could
be used for military purposes, such as for building or fortifying tunnels into Israel. 519 The
government’s “dual-use” list, though, includes both overly broad categories and items
that are vital to meet the needs of Gaza’s population, including “communications
equipment,” “steel elements and construction products,” “drilling equipment,” “fertilizers
and chemicals,” gas tanks, castor oil, and “vehicles except for personal vehicles (not

such as international monitoring of the use of dual-use items. Egypt only began formally
allowing goods into Gaza in February 2018, but subject to unclear procedures, including
denials of some goods also barred by Israeli authorities and at a volume significantly less
than through the Israeli-administered crossing. 524
As part of the closure policy, Israeli authorities also sharply restrict the export of goods out
of Gaza to the West Bank, Israel, and abroad. Between June 2007 and October 2014, Israeli
authorities on average permitted only 14 truckloads of goods to exit per month, according
to Gisha. 525 The situation has improved somewhat since, with an average of 219
truckloads per month exiting for the four-year period between 2016 and 2019, but that still
is just roughly 20 percent of the 1,064 truckloads per month exiting prior to the June 2007
tightening of the closure. 526 Egypt does not allow goods from Gaza to be shipped out via
the crossing it administers. 527

Israeli authorities have acknowledged that their determinations do not turn solely on
security. They have, for example, restricted or shut down exports as a punitive measure,
which they did for a total of 50 days in 2018 and 2019, according to Gisha. 528 In addition,

Israeli authorities, for example, forbid the marketing of many fruits and vegetables from
Gaza in the West Bank and Israel. 530 While there is a wider variety of produce that can be
sold from Gaza in the West Bank, Israeli authorities only in practice permitted, as of March
2021, the sale of eggplants and tomatoes to the Israeli market. 531 It also until November
2020 banned processed goods from Gaza entering markets in the West Bank and Israel. 532
Not only do no such restrictions exist on Israeli producers in the OPT, but Israel has
through its restrictions created in Gaza a “captive market,” as Gisha has put it, for Israeli
businesses. 533 More than 80 percent of the goods entering Gaza are purchased from
Israeli companies and suppliers, the value of which in 2015 alone amounted to almost 2
billion NIS (over $600 million), according to Gisha. 534 The Israeli cement company Nesher
also produces nearly all the cement used in Gaza. 535

These restrictions have devastated Gaza’s economy. 536 Gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita in Gaza dropped 23 percent between 1994 and 2016 in real dollars. 537 Eighty
percent of Gaza’s population relies on humanitarian aid, according to UNRWA, 538 and
have for some time hovered around 50 percent and are higher for young people and
women. 540
Israeli policies also sharply limit access to basic services, such as electricity and water.
Between 1967 and 2002, Gaza depended on electricity it received from the Israeli Electric
Corporation (IEC). 541 Although Gaza’s power plant became operational in 2002, it has
operated at only partial capacity, in part as a result of several Israeli aerial attacks, and
Gaza remains “almost completely dependent,” as the Israeli Supreme Court put it in 2008,
on Israel for its supply of electricity, either directly or indirectly. 542 The IEC, though, sells
only a set quantity of electricity to Gaza, which is insufficient to meet the demand of the
population, even if the power plant operated at full capacity, and periodically reduces
supply. 543 In 2017, for example, it cut by 30 percent the amount it supplied Gaza, following
a request from the PA, which sought to pressure Hamas authorities to relinquish their

control over Gaza. 544 Israeli forces have bombed Gaza’s sole power plant on multiple
occasions, 545 significantly reducing its capacity. 546 Israel’s restriction on the entry of
goods, including spare parts and equipment deemed dual-use, has hampered efforts to
other times over disputes in payments, the amount of industrial fuel it allows to be
purchased for the plant, which the plant needs to operate. 548 Israel has also restricted the
entry of solar panels and batteries, hampering efforts to develop alternative energy
sources that would give Gaza a degree of energy autonomy. 549 Gaza has at times
purchased a small quantity of electricity from Egypt, but an amount insufficient to meet the
needs of its residents. 550 In 2017 and 2018, Gaza averaged 6.2 hours per day of electricity;
that figure increased to 12 in 2019, largely due to Israel permitting Qatar to purchase fuel
for use in Gaza through Israeli vendors. 551 Meanwhile, Israeli settlers in the OPT enjoy
uninterrupted electricity, mostly from the same IEC. Regular power outages affect many
aspects of everyday life in Gaza, from heating and cooling and sewage treatment to health
care and business. 552
Gaza residents also do not have regular access to clean water. Gaza relies principally on

Israelis and downstream by Palestinians in Gaza, as well as the intrusion of seawater,
sewage, and nitrates, has left more than 96 percent of the groundwater “unfit for human
water pollution accounts for 26 percent of illnesses in Gaza and is the leading cause of
child mortality. 555 Gaza also purchases water from the Israeli water utility Mekorot, but
Israel controls the supply. Water from Mekorot goes through the same pipeline system as
the groundwater and mixes with it, reducing its quality. 556 Gaza’s old water pipeline
system also causes about a 30 percent loss of supply through leaks, 557 but Israel
complicates its maintenance by restricting the import of about 70 percent of the materials
and equipment needed to repair the water and sewage systems on the grounds that they
are “dual-use” items. 558 Gaza desalinates some water, but desalination requires
significant electricity, fuel, and funding. 559 These limitations force most Gaza households
to rely on purchasing purified water from private companies for drinking when they can
afford it. 560 In 2019, Gaza residents used 79 liters per day of water, an increase from 2017
and 2018 levels, but below the WHO minimum recommended level of 100. 561

“Yazan”: Yazan, 26, felt his dream had come true; the University of Nottingham in the
United Kingdom offered him admission for undergraduate studies. Yazan missed the start
of the semester in October 2018, as he awaited a reply to his application for an Israeliissued permit and a letter allowing him to travel via Jordan to the UK. He received the
permit in December and, on December 18, 2018, arrived at the Erez Checkpoint to begin his
journey. Upon his arrival, though, an Israeli soldier escorted him to a room for questioning.
He told Human Rights Watch that soldiers asked him about the situation in Gaza, one of
his neighbors and a payment his father made. 562 After waiting three hours, a soldier
returned and said, “You’ll be able to travel and everything will go well. How about
providing us with some simple things in exchange for money and travel?” Yazan took this
statement to be a request to provide intelligence about people in his community, and he
refused. The soldier turned him away, warning that “you are ruining your future,” and
urged him “to think about it.” Yazan said he considered leaving via Rafah, the crossing
with Egypt, but the Hamas-administered waiting list was long, he could not afford to pay
the several thousand dollars to advance his place on the waitlist, and the opportunity
passed. Israel’s separation policy effectively makes it impossible for Yazan to pursue
educational or professional opportunities in the West Bank, even though his mother is
from Nablus. 563 He ended up studying in Gaza and now does temporary contract jobs, but
“still has the same dream to study abroad” and continues to pursue scholarships. He told
Human Rights Watch, “I flew away with this dream, but suddenly fell down and found
myself in the real world. I feel like a bird inside a cage—I can fly in the cage, but always
remain inside it. This is Gaza—you’re inside a big prison, wondering what the world
outside has.”
“Leen”: Leen, a 23-year-old actress, received a permit to leave Gaza for a visa interview in
Jerusalem in July 2016, but decided not to return and went to live with her uncle in Jenin.
She told Human Rights Watch that her prior travels abroad made her feel that she
“wouldn’t be able to achieve anything in Gaza” and could not come to terms with

applied to change her address so she could legally remain in the West Bank. But she never
heard back about her application. Israeli authorities have effectively frozen the population
presence in the West Bank became illegal, and she said she began to fear getting stopped
and removed back to Gaza. She said, “I dream of getting a Palestinian ID that would allow
me to move freely and travel, then go back home to Gaza to see my family.” She now finds
herself stuck, unable to visit her family, but unwilling to give up her dream of pursuing a
better life in the West Bank. She added, “Gaza is a small prison. Ramallah is a big one…. If
I had the chance to go back in time, I would have remained in Gaza and just learned to
cope with life there.”
“Samia”: Samia, a 27-year-old English teacher, traveled to Jordan in 2016 for her studies.
She told Human Rights Watch that she soon decided to return to Gaza, but that her
relatives whom she visited in the West Bank convinced her to stay with them. 566 She said
she applied to change her address to the West Bank through the Palestinian Civil Affairs
Office, which forwards applications to Israeli authorities, but she received no response.
Samia began working as an English teacher in Ramallah and got engaged, but felt
constantly restricted, unable to move freely with friends and family. On July 3, 2019, she
set off in a taxi to visit her relatives in Nablus. On the way, Israeli soldiers stopped her at a
checkpoint they had set-up. Upon seeing her address listed as Gaza, they accused her of
“staying here illegally” and took her into custody at a military facility, where she spent the
night. Early the next morning, she said, officers cuffed her around her feet and hands, put
her in a vehicle without windows and drove her to the Erez Checkpoint, where they
removed her back to Gaza without her belongings or even her ID card. “It was a
nightmare,” Samia said. She had planned to get married in 2020 and had already rented a
place and began furnishing it, then “everything was gone within seconds.” She could not
believe, she said, that she “was deported from the second part of my country,” a place just
an hour away. She applied for a permit to return to the West Bank, but the Palestinian Civil
Affairs office in Gaza told her that Israelis had placed a 6-month security bloc on her,
barring her from travel. She said her fiancé twice applied for permits to visit Gaza, but

Israeli authorities denied him both times; once due to Jewish holidays and the other
without reason. She “lost hope” and even “told [her] fiancé to break up with me, if we are
not able to get together.” He refused, she said, and they continue to look for a way to
“Hadil”: In 2011, Hadil, a 37-year-old who works as a social media coordinator in Gaza, fell
in love with a man from Nablus whom she met at a conference in Amman. She began
applying for permits to visit him, but Israeli authorities routinely denied them, 11 times in
total, she told Human Rights Watch. 567 In 2012, the man managed to enter Gaza through
Egypt for a visit and the two got engaged. Shortly thereafter, following a July 2013 military
coup, Egyptian authorities largely sealed their border with Gaza. Hadil applied in 2014 for a
family reunification request to live with her fiancé in the West Bank, but that was rejected
without a reason given. In late 2015, she managed to get a permit to attend a conference
abroad. On her way back, during transit via the West Bank from Jordan, she contemplated
staying. But she worried about getting caught and being sent “for life imprisonment in
Gaza,” a reference to her fear that she would not be able to secure another travel permit,
so she returned to Gaza, and the couple broke up in May 2015. In 2019, though, she
managed to obtain permits through work to travel to the West Bank and met and got
engaged to a man from Ramallah. She regularly worries, she said, about facing the same
fate with this engagement. She has spoken to lawyers to file a request to change her
address, she said, but they have told her that the odds are quite low that Israel will allow
her to establish legal residence in the West Bank, and that the process will take significant
time. Her fiancé’s family has encouraged her to stay without status in the West Bank, but
she is unwilling to take that risk. The couple does not consider Gaza an option, she said,
because they have already purchased a home in the West Bank and did not want to
separate her fiancé from his family. With the path to living together in the OPT effectively
closed, they are now, she said, focused on finding a way to live together abroad.
“Kiran”: 33-year-old Kiran and her husband decided in 2016 to move from Gaza to the West
Bank in search of a better life. Kiran told Human Rights Watch that her husband obtained a

had in the West Bank, lives in “constant fear” of getting caught and being sent back to
Gaza, and stays home whenever “there is any tension.” They “feel like strangers inside
[their own] home,” as if they “are illegally residing in another country.” She said she has
missed many family occasions in Gaza, including weddings for both of her brothers, and
that her husband hasn’t seen his five children from a prior marriage since he left Gaza. She
said she has considered returning to Gaza, but she worries about how life in Gaza would
affect her three young boys. She told Human Rights Watch that “my boys get so happy
when they see planes in the sky…I can’t imagine their reaction when they see the planes
they love firing missiles and bombs. I don’t want them to experience war and death.”

Institutional Discrimination in Israel
Authorities inside Israel institutionally discriminate between the country’s Jewish and
Palestinian inhabitants, though in ways less severe than the oppression and persecution
of the OPT. There are roughly 6.2 million Jews and about 1.6 million Palestinians within
Green Line Israel, according to data from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. 569 Israel’s
Proclamation of Independence affirms the “complete equality” of all residents.
Palestinians in Israel are citizens who have the right to vote in national elections, unlike
Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem (except for the small minority of
Palestinian Jerusalemites who have applied for and been granted Israeli citizenship). For
the first 17 years of Israel’s existence as a nation, however, Israeli authorities placed most
Palestinians under military rule, confining them to dozens of enclaves, requiring them to
obtain permits to leave their enclaves, and severely restricting their rights. 570 When

military rule ended in 1966, authorities granted Palestinians in Israel freedom of
movement, but they continue to treat Jewish Israelis and Palestinians in starkly unequal
services. This discriminatory treatment is undertaken to further Jewish Israeli control over
demographics and land as officials have directly acknowledged. 571

Legal Status
Israel maintains a two-track citizenship structure that treats Palestinians unequally as
compared to Jews. While both Jews and Palestinians living in Israel are citizens, Israel’s
citizenship process privileges Jews and sharply restricts which Palestinians, beyond most
existing residents and their descendants, can become citizens.
Israel’s 1952 Citizenship Law at its outset notes that the state grants citizenship via four
routes: (1) “return,” (2) “residence in Israel,” (3) birth, and (4) naturalization. 572 Israel
reserves the first path, “return,” exclusively for Jews. This path grows out of the 1950 “Law
of Return,” which guarantees Jewish citizens of other countries the right to settle in
Israel. 573 The Citizenship Law states that Jews already living in Israel at the time gain
citizenship via this path, as opposed to the “residence in Israel” one.
Palestinians, by contrast, obtained citizenship in 1952 via the second path, “residence in
Israel.” The law, though, conditions citizenship on proving residency before 1948,
inclusion in the population registry, and continuous presence or legal entry in the period
between 1948 and 1952. None of these restrictions apply to Jewish Israelis. The language
not only excludes the more than 700,000 Palestinians that fled or were expelled from their
homes in 1948, along with their descendants, 574 but also those not counted in the
population registry due to a perfunctory registration process and those not present or not

Haaretz reported in 2017 that Israeli authorities had revoked the citizenship of “hundreds
if not thousands” of Palestinian Bedouins in the Negev region in recent years over alleged
“erroneous registration” by them or their families between 1948 and 1952. 576 In an August
2020 Knesset hearing, government officials acknowledged investigating the circumstances
around the granting of citizenship to about 2,600 people and said that they had concluded
that about 500 of them had been granted citizenship by mistake, although they claimed to
have reestablished the citizenship of 362 of them via an expedited process. 577
While the third path, birth, covers both Jews and Palestinians, the fourth, naturalization,
applies only to non-Jews. The Citizenship Law permits the Interior Ministry to grant
citizenship to those who meet a number of conditions, including several years of residency
in Israel, intention to settle, knowledge of Hebrew, renunciation of foreign citizenship, and
oath of loyalty.
In July 2003, the Israeli government issued Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law
(Temporary Order), which effectively suspended the naturalization process, as well as the
granting of long-term status, for Palestinian spouses of Israeli citizens or residents from
the West Bank and Gaza. 578 The Supreme Court has upheld the law and the Knesset has
renewed it every year since, most recently in June 2020. In 2005, the Knesset permitted

discriminate between citizens based on their nationality. The Israeli government registers
the nationality of all citizens and, until 2005, included nationality on each citizen’s identity
card. 580 Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are deemed to belong to different nationalities:
“Jew” and “Arab”. While recognizing more than 140 nationalities, the government does not
recognize an “Israeli nationality” and has denied requests of citizens to identify their
nationality as such. 581 Citizens have appealed this denial to the Supreme Court, which
upheld it. In 2013, the Court reaffirmed a 1972 ruling denying that “an Israeli nationality
had come into being, separate and differentiated from a Jewish nationality.” 582 In a
concurring opinion, Justice Hanan Melcer wrote that “the ‘constitutional Jewishness’ of the
state negates the legal possibility of recognizing an ‘Israeli nationality’ which is distinct,
as it were, from the ‘Jewish nationality’.” 583
The bifurcation between citizenship and nationality means that Israeli law relegates
Palestinians at birth to an inferior status by law. Israel has long defined itself as the
“nation-state of the Jewish people,” as enshrined in its 2018 Basic Law: Israel—The NationState of the Jewish People. That law, which has constitutional status, articulates for Jews
alone the right of self-determination and makes it a national priority to build homes for
Jews but not others. 584 Excluding Palestinians from the state’s definition of the nation
provides a legal basis to pursue policies that favor Jewish Israelis to the detriment of

Palestinians, in the name of advancing the “national interest” or “national security.” For
example, in November 2020, an Israeli magistrate court cited the 2018 Nation-State law to
dismiss a lawsuit by two Palestinian schoolchildren seeking reimbursement for expenses
city of Karmiel in northern Israel where they live. The ruling stated that “Karmiel is a Jewish
city intended to solidify Jewish settlement in the Galilee. The establishment of an Arabiclanguage school or even the funding of school transportation for Arab students is liable to
alter the demographic balance and damage the city’s character.” It added that “the
development and establishment of Jewish settlement is a national value enshrined in the
Basic Law and is a worthy and dominant consideration in municipal decision-making.” 585
Legal measures aimed at protecting the Jewish character of the state that discriminate
against Palestinians undermine the pledge in Israel’s Proclamation of Independence to
“ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of
religion, race or sex.” Palestinian citizens vote in elections and have served in the Knesset,
but Israel’s Basic Law: The Knesset—1958, which has constitutional status, declares that
no candidate can run for the Knesset if they expressly or implicitly endorse “negation of
the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.” 586 Israel’s Law of
Political Parties (1992) further bars registration of any party whose goals directly or
indirectly deny “the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.” 587 While the
Supreme Court often opts against disqualifying candidates for violating these
provisions, 588 the provisions formally block Palestinians from challenging the laws that
codify their subjugation and, in so doing, diminish the value of the right of Palestinian
citizens to vote. The fact that no government in Israel’s history has ever included

Land and Housing
As a result of decades of land confiscations and discriminatory land policies, Israeli
authorities have hemmed in Palestinian towns and villages, while nurturing the growth and
expansion of Jewish communities, many of which in practice exclude Palestinians. The
majority of Palestinians in Israel live in these communities, while some live in “mixed
cities” like Tel Aviv-Jaffa and Haifa. 591
Ninety-three percent of all land in Israel constitutes state land, directly controlled by the
Israeli government. 592 Israeli authorities confiscated much of this land, several million
dunams, from Palestinians through several different legal instruments, as documented in a
later chapter of this report. 593 A government agency, the Israel Land Authority (ILA),

expansion of Jewish communities. 597 Since 1948, the government has authorized the
creation of more than 900 “Jewish localities” in Israel, 598 but none for Palestinians except
for a handful of government-planned townships and villages in the Negev and Galilee,

Palestinian groups. 600
Even inside Palestinian towns and villages within Israel, Israeli authorities discriminatorily
restrict the land available for residential growth. The authorities have zoned large sections
of Palestinian towns and villages for “agricultural” use or as “green” areas, prohibited
residential building in them, and built roads and other infrastructure projects that impede
expansion. A 2003 Israeli government-commissioned report found that “many Arab towns

impede the possibility of their expansion in the future.” 601 While increasing focus in recent
years on these issues has resulted in more state-approved residential development, 602
they have done little to date to change the reality of hemmed-in Palestinian towns and
Israel’s six districts, planning authorities provided sufficient land and zoning permissions
to predominantly Jewish communities to facilitate their growth. 603
These restrictions create density problems and a housing crunch in Palestinian
communities. The Arab Center for Alternative Planning, based in Israel, told Human Rights
Watch in December 2018 that it estimates that 15 to 20 percent of homes in Palestinian
towns and villages lack permits, some because owners’ applications were rejected and
others because they did not apply knowing that authorities would reject their requests on
the grounds that they were contrary to the existing zoning. The group estimated that
60,000 to 70,000 homes in Israel, excluding Jerusalem, were at risk as of 2018 of full
demolition. 604 As of July 2015, 97 percent of Israel’s pending judicial demolition orders
were for structures located in Palestinian towns. 605
These dynamics most dramatically manifest themselves in the Negev, where
discriminatory Israeli policies and practices leave about 90,000 Palestinian Bedouins
living in “unrecognized” informal communities, where their homes face the constant threat
of demolition. 606 At the same time, Israeli authorities and quasi-governmental bodies have

Israeli authorities discriminate in the provision of resources and services between
principally from two sources: those generated locally by taxes and those received from the
central government. The rights groups Sikkuy and Injaz found in a 2014 report that while
local taxes make up 66 percent of the revenue for localities across Israel, they constitute
only 31 percent of the overall budget for Palestinian localities. 612 While the gap in part
reflects the significantly lower tax base in Palestinian localities, the groups found a larger
disparity in income from non-residential or business taxes. They, in particular, highlighted
the dearth of “revenue-generating properties” in Palestinian municipalities, including in
the residential, industrial, commercial, tourism, banking, and infrastructure sectors. 613 In
May 2020, Sikkuy found, based on 2018 data, that while Jewish localities collected 2.5
times more in residential taxes than Palestinian ones, they collected 6.5 times more in
non-residential taxes. 614
The significantly higher levels of non-residential local taxes that Jewish localities collect
are the result of discriminatory state policies. The Knesset Research and Information
Center found in July 2018 that only 2 percent of industrial zones managed by the
government, which generate significant tax income, are located in Palestinian
municipalities. 615 Government buildings also generate significant tax revenues, but,
according to a July 2020 study by Knesset Research and Information Center, only 0.4
percent of government properties that generate tax revenues are located within Palestinian
municipalities. 616 In addition, according to Sikkuy, not a single Palestinian municipality

found that Palestinian localities, where about 90 percent of Palestinian citizens of Israel

Localities which collect less revenue from local taxes rely more on funding from the central
government. Here too, Israeli authorities allocate budgets in a discriminatory fashion. For
example, of the 2.82 billion NIS ($804 million) of economic recovery funds handed out by
the Israeli government to local authorities in April 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, only
1.7 percent went to Palestinian municipalities, according to Adalah. 620 In education, the
Israeli government operates two separate school systems, one for Jewish children and one
for Palestinian children in Israel. 621 Discrimination colors every aspect of the two systems;
often overcrowded and understaffed, poorly built or maintained, state schools for
Palestinian children offer fewer facilities and educational opportunities than what are
offered to Jewish Israeli children. 622 The Haifa-based rights group Mossawa Center found
based on government data that, in 2013, the annual expenditure per student in Palestinian
localities was 734 NIS ($220), as compared to 3,344 NIS ($1,004) in poor Jewish localities

While authorities in recent years have reduced budgeting inequities, significant gaps
remain. In particular, a five-year, more than 10 billion NIS ($3 billion) “economic
development plan for the Arab sector” 625 approved in December 2015 has increased
allocation to sectors like transportation. However, it did not address other areas of
disparity, including welfare services and high school education. 626 Palestinian localities
have also received funding from “equalization grants” provided by the central government
and from a governmental fund aimed at “closing the [economic] gaps” between differently
situated localities, but, according to Sikkuy, not to levels proportional to the gaps that
exist in comparison to Jewish localities.

627

The Mossawa Center found in a study of Israel’s

2019 budget that funding allocated to Palestinian areas remains “meager,” with significant
needs in education and other areas still present, and that “systematic discrimination”
remains endemic in government spending. 628
These disparities contribute to the starkly different socio-economic situations for
Palestinians and Jewish citizens. According to May 2020 figures from Israel’s Ministry for
Social Equality, 45.3 percent of Palestinian families live below the poverty line, as
compared to 13.4 percent of Jewish families. 629 Sikkuy in 2015 found that the wage gap
between Palestinian and Jewish men stood at 44.6 percent and at 31 percent for women,

Case Study: Nazareth
The following case study details how Israeli authorities discriminate against the residents
of the Palestinian city of Nazareth in Israel in ways that stifle the community’s growth and
undermine its well-being while promoting the development of a Jewish-majority city next
to it.
Nazareth, the largest Palestinian locality in Israel with a population of 77,400, 631 lies in the
Galilee region within Israel’s Northern District. It is the only Palestinian city that survived
the events of 1948 intact. 632 Discriminatory Israeli land policies have restricted it to largely
the same geographical area it had then, while its population has increased more than fivefold. 633 Meanwhile, Israeli authorities established Nazareth Illit (Upper Nazareth, renamed
in 2019 Nof HaGalil; referenced henceforward by its original name) in the 1950s as a
“Jewish town,” 634 according to Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, in order to, as
a then-senior official put it, “swallow up” Nazareth. 635 A road, Highway 75 or Zionism
Road, largely demarcates the boundary today between Nazareth and Nazareth Illit. Israeli
authorities have over the years nurtured the growth and development of Nazareth Illit,
often at Nazareth’s expense. Today, Nazareth Illit has developed into a “mixed city” with

Nazarenes amid the squeeze they face, as described below. 636
Slated to belong to the Arab State under the 1947 UN partition plan, Nazareth came under
Israeli control in July 1948. Unlike the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced to
leave their communities during the establishment of the Israeli state, the residents of
Nazareth largely remained in their homes. According to historian Benny Morris, Israeli
officials gave the order to “uproot all the residents of Nazareth,” but the commander of the
nascent Israeli army’s brigade given the order, Ben Dunkelman, refused to carry it out, and

authorities eventually allowed the city to surrender. 637 Nazareth’s population increased in
the aftermath of the events of 1948, as it absorbed more than 5,000 Palestinians who had
been displaced from nearby villages and prevented from returning to them. 638 Many
their villages. 639
One displaced Palestinian, 85-year-old souvenir-shop-owner Ameen Muhammad Ali,
known as Abu Arab, told Human Rights Watch that he ended up in Nazareth in 1949
months after he and his family fled his home village of Safuriyya, which then stood six
kilometers north of Nazareth, amid Israeli fire. 640 He was 13 at the time. After several
months in Lebanon, he said his family managed to cross back into Israel before Israeli
forces tightened border controls and blocked refugees from returning. 641 Some other
Safuriyya residents also managed to return, which prompted Israeli authorities in January
1949, as historian Benny Morris documented, to forcibly expel residents who remained in
the village or had returned there. 642 Later that year, Israeli authorities established the
Jewish moshav, or cooperative village, of Tzipori on Safuriyya’s lands. 643 Abu Arab said his
family lost their home and about 200 dunams of land they owned in the village.
Later in 1949, Abu Arab’s family moved to a neighborhood in Nazareth that came to be
known as Safafra because of the many displaced Safuriyya residents who ended up

there. 644 In January 2001, Haaretz estimated that internally displaced Palestinians and
their descendants constitute about half of Nazareth’s population. 645 Most of Abu Arab’s
family who lived in Safuriyya, including several dozen aunts, uncles, and cousins, never
barred from even visiting. Abu Arab said he sometimes visits Tzipori, which today restricts
who can live or enter there, in part to take care of five cemeteries in the moshav where
Safuriyya’s ancestors, including two of his cousins, are buried. He said he used to be able
to see the lands of Safuriyya from his home in Nazareth and longs to return. 646
Shortly after the establishment of the Israeli state, Israeli authorities placed Nazareth
under military rule and began in the 1950s implementing a policy to “Judaize the
Galilee.” 647 The establishment of Nazareth Illit became a key part of that strategy, as the
army’s then-Planning Department Director Yuval Ne’eman put it, to “emphasize and
safeguard the Jewish character of the Galilee as a whole.” 648 The northern military
governor at the time, Colonel Mikhael Mikhael, wrote that the establishment of Nazareth
Illit would result in the “transfer of the center of gravity of life from Nazareth to the Jewish
neighborhood.” 649
Israeli authorities established Nazareth Illit in the 1950s on lands belonging to residents of
Nazareth and other nearby villages. The first confiscation, of about 1,200 dunams of land
from Nazareth, took place in June 1954 under a 1943 law (Acquisition for Public Purpose
Ordinance), a relic of British mandate law that permits the taking of land for a public
purpose. 650 Nazarenes brought a legal challenge against the decision, but the Israeli
Supreme Court upheld it, based on a state declaration that it confiscated the land solely to
build government facilities. 651 Authorities used only a fraction of the land for government

facilities—109 dunams, according to one historian—with most of it going to develop a
“Jewish neighborhood” inside Nazareth. 652 In August 1952, Government Secretary Ze’ev
Sherf said, “the only chance of making Nazareth a partially Jewish city is by consolidating
be able to Judaize Nazareth.” 653
Keen to avoid relegating the Jewish community to a minority status in Nazareth, Israeli
officials opted in the late 1950s to make Nazareth Illit a separate locality, with the aim of
later merging the municipalities once the Jewish community surpassed the Palestinian
population. 654 Authorities continued to confiscate Palestinian land to develop Nazareth
Illit into the 1960s and 1970s, including a 160 dunam plot of land in the center of Nazareth
known as the Sprinzak Enclave. A military base for years and home to a hotel, the site falls
within the municipality of Nazareth Illit, despite its location in the center of Nazareth,
meaning Nazareth Illit receives the taxes based on the facilities there. 655 Through these
confiscations, Nazareth Illit deepened its footprint in the Galilee, weaving between
Nazareth and six other Palestinian villages and impeding the establishment of a larger,
contiguous Palestinian municipal area. Nazareth-based journalist Jonathan Cook has
written that Nazareth Illit’s development blocked Nazareth from “transform[ing] into the
true capital of Israel’s Palestinian minority,” a nearly 200,000 person “conurbation” in the
center of Israel, and instead effectively turned Nazareth into, as one Nazarene put it to
him, “the largest Arab village in Israel.” 656
Nazareth had a population of about 15,000 and a land mass, according to one historian, of
12,599 dunams before 1948. 657 Today, its population is 77,400 and its size is 14,172
dunams. 658 Israeli authorities only approved their first master plan for Nazareth in 2009;

the prior plan had been established in 1942 under the British Mandate. 659 The total
expansion of Nazareth over more than 70 years, totaling more than 6,000 dunams, has
only slightly outpaced the land lost during the events around the establishment of Israel in
estimated that it needed between 10,403 and 12,378 more dunams to meet the needs of
residents, including for new residential neighborhoods, land for industrial and commercial
development, and more public spaces. 661 In a survey of Nazareth residents conducted in
2013 by Professor Yosef Jabareen of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa,
71.8 percent of those surveyed said that the local regulations barred them from any
construction to expand their current properties. 662
The restricted access to land for housing to accommodate natural population growth has
created density problems and a housing crunch in Nazareth. In the same survey, 86.6 of
residents identified traffic and 83.7 population density as “very serious” problems. 663
Musab Dukhan, a member of Nazareth’s municipal council, told Human Rights Watch that
“narrow streets and a lack of space for parking creates heavy traffic” and that “there is no
space for the new generation to build a future here and remain in the city.” 664 One resident
described Nazareth as a “city that can’t breathe and always feels tense.” 665
While restricting Nazareth, Israeli authorities have allowed Nazareth Illit to grow rapidly.
Built in part on state land and designated as a city to receive new Jewish immigrants,
Israeli authorities invested heavily in Nazareth Illit, including by establishing in 1992 the
Ziporit Industrial Area, which includes factories and a park for high-tech companies. While

Nazareth long served as a regional administrative hub. Beginning in the late 1950s, Israeli
authorities gradually relocated many government offices servicing the region from
Nazareth to Nazareth Illit. The offices moved include those belonging to the agriculture
ministry, the education ministry, the health ministry, the interior ministry, the prime
minister’s office, the census bureau, the customs, and value-added tax division, the
taxation authority, the land registration department, and the Magistrate’s, District and
District Labor Courts. 669 Some buildings are located to the west of Highway 75, on the

government offices generate and that could have spurred development. 670 In a 2017

30 percent of the per capita non-residential taxes, which largely stem from taxes on

The Israeli government policy of funneling resources from Nazareth to Nazareth Illit has

“National Priority A” in tourism—a status that qualifies the city to receive grants and tax
breaks—in preparation for the millennium and planned visit by the Pope at the time. 673
Subsequent governments revoked Nazareth’s tourism priority status, while retaining it for
Nazareth Illit, which had received it in the 1970s. 675
Three business owners in or near Nazareth’s Old City—one runs a restaurant, one a café,
and one a souvenir shop—told Human Rights Watch that tourists and in particular
organized tour groups often spend only an hour or two visiting Nazareth’s churches,
without entering the Old City or spending money or the night in the city. 676 Some stay in
hotels in Nazareth Illit, while others continue on to eat and sleep in the nearby
predominantly Jewish city of Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee. 677
The lack of revenue-generating properties, as well as discriminatory allocation of budgets
from the central government, means Nazareth residents often receive inferior services

Nazarenes often head to nearby predominantly Jewish localities to spend time in parks,
given the paucity of those or other public spaces in their hometown. When one Nazareth
resident sought to enter a public park in the nearby predominantly Jewish city of Afula in
June 2019, security guards barred her entry upon learning that she was from Nazareth, just
months after Afula’s mayor promised to act against the “conquest of the park,” calling for
residents to “hoist Israeli flags throughout the park and play music in Hebrew,” and
campaigned on a platform of “preserving the Jewish character of Afula.” 681 The city
reversed course and agreed to open its park to all visitors following a lawsuit by Adalah. 682
Ironically, thousands of Nazarenes have moved to Nazareth Illit in recent years, many of
them purchasing property from Jewish Israelis who were resettled there as immigrants and
then earned enough to “head for a better life in the center of the country,” according to
Cook. 683 Nazarene restaurant owner Khalil Haddad, 43, told Human Rights Watch that,
although born and raised in Nazareth Illit, he and his wife decided when they got married
in 2006 to live in Nazareth, considering it their “national duty” as Palestinians. However,
the population density, housing crunch, and lack of playgrounds, parks, and other public
spaces gradually eroded his opposition to living in Nazareth Illit, and they finally decided
to move there in 2014. 684
Some of the factors that motivated Haddad to leave the city he loved with his young family
bear some similarities to pressures that lead urban dwellers in other contexts to move out
of cities, including high housing costs, congestion, and a shortage of green space. In the

attributes to the fact that “Nazareth and other nearby [Palestinian] towns do not have
space to grow.” 685 Bachar noted that the municipality was not about to “give away land”
to these communities, given “our ambition to reach 100,000 citizens” and suggested
instead that Israel build “a new city for Arab citizens.” 686 Bachar noted that the city is
“bringing in Jewish families to settle” in order to “ensure it stays Jewish.” 687
Despite moving, many Nazarenes who live in Nazareth Illit maintain a center of life in
Nazareth. Haddad said he continues to do his shopping, including for groceries, in
Nazareth, referring to Nazareth Illit as a “bedroom community.” 688 It does not have a state
school to serve the roughly 3,000 school-age Palestinian children, forcing most, including
Haddad’s son, to commute to Nazareth, since Palestinian and Jewish Israelis attend
separate schools. 689 Former Nazareth Illit mayor Shimon Gafsou, who once described

Grave abuses, or “inhuman[e] acts” as set out in the Apartheid Convention and Rome
Statute, amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid when carried out in the context
of systematic oppression with an intent to maintain a system of domination. Severe
abuses of fundamental rights make up the crime against humanity of persecution when
carried out with discriminatory intent.
To maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, Israeli authorities have
carried out over many years a range of serious abuses.
In the OPT, many of these abuses amount to inhumane acts, one of the three elements of
the crime of apartheid, including:
•

sweeping restrictions on movement;

•

the confiscation of hundreds of thousands of dunams of land in the West Bank
from Palestinians, depriving them of their property, means of livelihood and way of
life, and consequent hemming in of the densely populated enclaves where most
live;

•

the imposition of harsh conditions, including near-categorical denial of building
permits, in large parts of the West Bank that coerce thousands to abandon their
homes in conditions that amount to forcible transfer;

•

the denial of residency rights to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their
relatives for being abroad when the occupation began in 1967, or for long periods
during the first few decades of the occupation, or as a result of the effective freeze
on family reunification over the past two decades; and

•

the suspension of basic civil rights, such as freedom of assembly and association,
depriving millions of the opportunity to have a voice in the wide range of affairs
that most affect their daily lives and futures.

Separately from the inhumane acts carried out in the OPT, the Israeli government has
carried out abuses against Palestinians within Israel, including:

Inhumane Acts in the OPT

Movement Restrictions
For over two decades, Israeli authorities have imposed sweeping restrictions on the ability
of the more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza to leave that territory and sharply
restricted the movement of 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank, both within that
territory and beyond.
Closure of Gaza
For the last 25 years, Israel has increasingly restricted the movement of Gaza residents.
Since 2007, the year that Hamas seized effective political control over the Gaza Strip from
the Fatah-led PA, Israel has imposed a generalized travel ban on movement in and out of
the small territory with few exceptions. The Israeli army since 2007 has limited travel
through the Erez Crossing, the passenger crossing from Gaza to the other part of the OPT,
the West Bank, and abroad, as well as to Israel. Israel has limited passage to cases
presenting what it deems “exceptional humanitarian circumstances,” meaning mainly
those needing vital medical treatment outside Gaza and their companions, although
authorities also grant permits each year to hundreds of Gaza residents eligible on other
grounds, such as high-level businesspeople and merchants. 693 Israel has restricted
movement even for those seeking to travel under these narrow exceptions to Israel’s
closure policy. 694 Most Gaza residents do not fit within these exemptions. For the five-year
period between January 2015 and December 2019, an average of about 373 Palestinians
exited Gaza via Erez each day, less than 1.5 percent of the daily average of 26,000 in
September 2000, before the closure, according to the Israeli rights group Gisha. 695 Most
Palestinians who grew up under this closure have never exited Gaza.
Israeli authorities have also for more than two decades sharply restricted the use of Gaza’s
airspace and territorial waters by Palestinians. They blocked both reopening an airport that

Palestinians once operated there, and building a seaport, leaving them dependent on
leaving Gaza by land in order to travel abroad. 696 Egypt has for much of the last 15 years
world, contributing to the closure.
Israel restricts all travel between Gaza and the West Bank, despite its having recognized
the two to be part of a single territorial unit, 697 even when the travel takes place via the
circuitous route through Egypt and Jordan rather than through Israeli territory. The closure
adversely affects many aspects of everyday life and contributes to other violations of
Palestinians’ rights, including the right to family reunification, the right to access
healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. 698
Israeli authorities often justify the closure on security grounds. Authorities have said in
particular that they want to minimize travel between Gaza and the West Bank to prevent
transferring “a human terrorist infrastructure” from Gaza to the West Bank, the latter of which
has a porous border with Israel and is home to hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. 699
As an occupying power that maintains significant control over aspects of life in Gaza
despite the formal withdrawal of its troops, 700 Israel has obligations under international
humanitarian law to ensure the welfare of the population there. Palestinians also have the
right under international human rights law to freedom of movement, in particular, within
the OPT, that Israel can restrict only in response to concrete, specific security threats. Its

policy of presumptively denying free movement, with narrow exceptions, based on
generalized security threats and irrespective of any individualized assessment of the
concerns against the human right to freedom of movement. While Israel has legitimate
security concerns in regulating entry to its territory, those concerns cannot justify the
massive violation of rights that the near-total travel ban inflicts on the over two million
Palestinians living in a sliver of territory.
Permit Regime in the West Bank
Israeli authorities have also imposed onerous restrictions on freedom of movement in the
West Bank that they justify based on “substantive security reasons” given that
“Palestinian residents from the region carried out… hundreds of deadly terrorist
attacks.” 701 Israeli policies, however, restrict the movement of all Palestinians, not just
those whom authorities deem to present a security threat. The army requires Palestinian ID
holders, with narrow exemptions, to apply to the Israeli army for time-limited permits to
enter significant parts of the West Bank,

702

including East Jerusalem, the “seam zone”

between the separation barrier and the Green Line which covers more than 184,000
dunams, 703 and areas controlled by settlements and the army, while allowing Israelis and
foreigners to move freely among these areas, as well as to Israel, without permits. To
obtain permits, Palestinians “face an arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic
system,” with “no way of assessing the chances that their applications will be approved or
how soon,” according to the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. 704 “Many applications are
denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal,” and “permits already granted
are easily revoked, also without explanation,” B’Tselem adds. Those denied permits

When it comes to travel abroad, Palestinians in the West Bank must travel via Jordan
through the Israeli-controlled Allenby Crossing, unless they receive a difficult-to-secure
permit to leave from Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. But Israeli authorities sometimes
ban them from using that crossing on unspecified security grounds. 706 Between 2015 and
2019, the Israeli rights group HaMoked filed administrative appeals against 797 Israeliissued travel bans on Palestinians. 707
While countries have wide latitude to restrict entry at their own borders, Israel largely
restricts movement of the occupied population not only to travel between the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, even when it does not take place through Israel, but also within the
West Bank itself. Israeli authorities, for example, have erected nearly 600 permanent
obstacles, such as checkpoints and roadblocks, within the West Bank, according to
OCHA. 708 Palestinians also regularly face ad-hoc “flying” checkpoints across the West
Bank—OCHA estimated that Israeli forces set up nearly 1,500 such checkpoints between
April 2019 and March 2020 alone. 709 Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and
delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation, obstructing commutes to school,
work, or appointments of all kinds. 710 The separation barrier, 85 percent of which falls
within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line, further encumbers movement in the
West Bank. 711

closure, the severe movement restrictions in the West Bank, and the restrictions on
movement between the West Bank and Gaza, two parts of the OPT, also violate
Palestinians’ “right to freedom of movement,” as also outlined in the Apartheid

Land Expropriation and Creation of Separate Enclaves (West Bank, East Jerusalem)
Using a range of official justifications, Israel has since 1967 taken over much of the land in
the West Bank from Palestinians in large part to serve the needs of Jewish Israeli settlers.
B’Tselem and Kerem Navot have found that Israeli authorities have confiscated more than
2 million dunams of land, making up more than one-third of the West Bank. 716 Israeli
settlement authorities effectively control these lands, including about 540,000 that fall
within their formal jurisdiction.
Most commonly, Israeli authorities take land, including land privately owned by
Palestinians, by declaring it to be “state land.” 717 The Israeli group Peace Now estimates
that the Israeli government holds about 1.4 million dunams of land, or about a quarter of
the West Bank, as state land. 718

Under Israeli judicial and military practice and policy, land not formally registered as
privately owned by authorities who controlled the West Bank before 1967 can be declared
registration process that had been underway under Jordanian auspices and has not
conducted one since. Landowners who did not register their land before 1967 have the
onus of proving ownership through a lengthy and expensive process that typically involves
producing tax documents, gathering testimonies from neighbors and local officials, and
paying for a court-approved survey of the land. 719 In some cases, the authorities declared
as state land parcels on which Palestinian landowners had paid taxes to the Jordanian
authorities, a hallmark of ownership at the time. Israeli courts have upheld as legal the
state’s mechanism for declaring state land. 720
Even if ownership can be proved, Israeli authorities interpret Ottoman land law in such a
way as to take land without paying compensation to the owners when it can claim that at
least 50 percent of the parcel has not been cultivated within the prior three years. 721 This
interpretation facilitated the takeover of “absentee” property belonging to Palestinians
who fled during or following the 1967 War, as well as from Palestinians who remained in
the West Bank but lost access to their land.

722

Beginning in 1979, following an Israeli

Supreme Court ruling that restricted the army’s authority to transfer to settlements lands
confiscated on purported security grounds that it recognized as privately owned by
Palestinians, 723 the Israeli military Custodian of Government Property conducted a hasty
and error-riddled land survey that aimed to identify uncultivated lands that Israeli
authorities could claim as state land. 724 Based on the survey, Israeli authorities declared
as state land parcels that had been cultivated but not intensely, that consisted of rocky

Through this process, Israeli authorities have designated as state land about 788,000
dunams, excluding East Jerusalem but including about 100,000 dunams currently in Areas
A and B. 726 The remaining roughly 600,000 dunams of state land it holds, including about
70,00 dunams currently in Areas A and B, consists of land that Jordanian or British
authorities registered as state land during their respective reigns over the West Bank and
which Israel took control of in 1967. 727
Israeli authorities have issued hundreds of eviction orders against Palestinians they claim
are “illegally holding” state land. 728 The Israeli rights groups Kerem Navot and Haqel
found, based on a review of more than 600 eviction orders issued against Palestinians
between 2005 and 2018, that 41.5 percent of the territory encompassed by the orders had
not formally been declared by authorities as state land. 729
Of the more than 675,000 dunams of state land that Israeli authorities have officially
allocated for third parties in the West Bank, they have earmarked more than 99 percent to
serve the needs of Israeli civilians. 730
Beyond what they deem state land, Israeli authorities have confiscated tens of thousands
of dunams of land they acknowledge to be privately owned by Palestinians. Peace Now,
based on data provided by the Israeli government, found in 2007 that more than 30
percent of the land located within settlements is privately-owned Palestinian land, by the

estimates that more than 40 percent of the roughly 55,000 dunams of land outside the
acknowledged to be private Palestinian land. 732
Israeli authorities have relied on two primary legal tools to carry out confiscations of
acknowledged private Palestinian property. First, authorities have expropriated land for
public use, permanently stripping Palestinian landowners of their rights to it in return for
some compensation. 733 Second, the Israeli army, particularly during the first 12 years of its
occupation, seized privately owned land in the West Bank for security purposes. These
seizure orders did not change the title to the land, premised as they were on the
assumption that the occupation is temporary. But while continuing to list the confiscated
land as belonging to its Palestinian owners, Israeli authorities gave it to Israeli civilians
while sharply restricting its Palestinian owners and their heirs from accessing it. Kerem
Navot determined based on a review of more than 1,000 seizure orders that, between 1967
and 2014, Israeli authorities seized on security grounds more than 100,000 dunams of
land, most of it privately owned by Palestinians, for settlements or infrastructure intended
in significant part to serve the needs of settlers. 734 Most of the confiscations took place
before 1979 when the Israeli Supreme Court restricted the authority of the army to give to
settlements privately owned land that it had seized on security grounds. 735 Since that
decision, though, authorities with few exceptions have not returned to their Palestinian
owners lands they seized and allocated to settlements prior to the court decision.

In addition, settlers have established settlements without any formal process or
authorization from the Israeli military authorities, largely on the private property of
without permits, however, the authorities have, with a few notable exceptions, facilitated
the land takeover by providing infrastructure, water, electricity, and other services. 736 One
hundred and fifty of such so-called outposts have been established across the West Bank
since 1991, according to B’Tselem and Kerem Navot. 737 Peace Now has documented 60
outposts established since 2012 alone. 738 Israeli authorities retroactively granted legal

and Netanyahu has indicated that

he intends to annex and incorporate outposts into Israel. 740
In February 2017, the Knesset passed a law allowing authorities to retroactively
expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements have been built. In June 2020,
however, the Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional, 741 finding that “less
harmful tools” could achieve similar ends. These include a military order cited by the
attorney-general in a submission to the court that recognizes as valid deals made in “good
faith,” where authorities reasonably believed at the time of sale that the land was not
privately owned by Palestinians. 742 Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit began to cite this

Israeli military records show other parcels of land as sold by Palestinians to Israeli
settlement entities. In many cases, though, settlers’ claims to the land they bought rely on
dubious documents or sellers not legally entitled to sell the land in question, creating
fraudulent sales. 745 Even in cases in which Palestinian landowners genuinely sell land they
owned to a settlement, such a transaction might involve duress because Israeli authorities
fully or partially prevented the Palestinian owners from making use of the land before they
sold it.
Israeli authorities have also expropriated from Palestinians nearly one-third of the land in
East Jerusalem, comprising at least 23,378 dunams according to B’Tselem, largely to build
settlements. 746 Owners of expropriated land in East Jerusalem, as in the West Bank, can
officially claim compensation, but many Palestinian owners do not seek it so as not to
legitimize the expropriation. 747
Beyond reclassifying land status, Israeli authorities have used other mechanisms to take
control of land. First, they have declared close to 1.765 million dunams of land, almost
one-third of the entire West Bank, as “closed military areas” as of March 2015, according

ostensibly to be used for military training 78 percent is not actually used for training. 749
Second, the Israeli army has issued formal no-construction orders, primarily along roads
and parts of the separation barrier, on more than 488,600 dunams of Palestinian land in
the West Bank, as documented by Kerem Navot. 750
Land grabs and restrictions confine the nearly 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank to
densely populated enclaves. Israel maintains full control over the majority of the West
Bank, including East Jerusalem and Area C. In Areas A and B, where Palestinians have a
limited degree of self-rule and which comprises the remaining roughly 40 percent of the
West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, it concentrates Palestinians, according to B’Tselem,
into “165 non-contiguous ‘territorial islands.’” 751
The mass confiscation of Palestinian land and restrictions that block Palestinians from
recovering what authorities seized from them or using their lands amount to the inhumane
act of “expropriation of landed property” under the Apartheid Convention. 752 The boxing of
Palestinians into densely populated enclaves constitutes measures “designed to divide
the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos.” 753

Largely for lacking a permit, Israeli authorities have razed thousands of Palestinian
properties. They have also demolished Palestinian homes as punishment imposed on
those accused of attacking Israelis and as collective punishment of their families. 763 From

Area C, displacing 10,493 people, according to OCHA. 764 B’Tselem documented that Israeli
authorities fully demolished in this same period 2,319 homes throughout the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, for lacking a building permit, leaving 9,053 people displaced. 765
Israel has not offered resettlement options or compensation to families whose homes it
demolished. Israeli authorities also carried out 84 punitive home demolitions during this

humanitarian law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless
“absolutely necessary” for “military operations” and prohibits all acts that constitute
collective punishment. 767
These coercive policies affect many more Palestinians living in these areas, who face

Coercive policies have particularly affected Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley,
around Jerusalem, and in the South Hebron Hills. 775 In many of these areas, Israeli
accessing roads and agricultural lands, failed to provide electricity, sewage, water, and
other utilities, and rejected their applications for such services. Many of these
communities also have no reliable access to water sources and have to spend up to onesixth of their income to purchase water from small, portable water tankers. These
restrictions often result in children walking long distances for school and leaving residents
with limited access to health care. 776
In addition, Israel has directly deported more than 1,500 Palestinians out of the OPT,
largely before 1993, only some of whom they have permitted to return. 777
Israel’s coercive policies in East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank amount to
intentional forcible transfer of civilians within an occupied territory, defined as “the
movement of individuals under duress from where they reside to a place that is not of their
choosing,” 778 a grave breach of the laws of war. The Rome Statute states that forcible
transfer can occur “directly or indirectly,” through coercive circumstances as well as direct
force, 779 and defines it, when carried out in a widespread or systematic manner, as a state
policy, as a crime against humanity and one of the kinds of inhumane acts that make up
the crime of apartheid. 780 The Israeli policies in these areas, which have coerced
thousands to leave their homes and put tens of thousands more at risk, amount to forcible
transfer under the terms of the Rome Statute. By denying building permits for houses,
schools, clinics, and infrastructure and demolishing homes and entire areas, these

Denial of Residency and Nationality
Israeli authorities have denied millions of Palestinians the right to residency and
nationality through its control over population registries, the granting of legal status and
residency rights, and entry and exit to Israel and the OPT.
West Bank and Gaza
Israeli policies on Palestinian residency have arbitrarily denied hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians the ability to live in, and travel to and from, the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli
restrictions on residency separate families, bar thousands from returning to their homes in
the OPT, trap others inside their homes or parts of the OPT, and block others from pursuing
educational or economic opportunities. 782
Israeli authorities have primarily done so through their ongoing control of the population
registry—the list of Palestinians whom authorities consider lawful residents of the OPT.
Israel requires Palestinians to be included in the population registry to obtain Israelisanctioned identification cards and passports, which allow Palestinians to reside, work,
and inherit property, but do not convey citizenship or nationality. Israeli security forces
manning checkpoints require Palestinians to present an identification card before allowing
passage for travel within the OPT, including to schools, jobs, hospitals or to visit family. 783
Egyptian authorities also require Palestinians to present an identification card or passport
to enter or exit via the Rafah crossing. 784
Israeli authorities base the population registry on a census it conducted in the West Bank
and Gaza in September 1967, several months after it took control of these areas. The

census counted 954,898 Palestinians as physically present, 785 but excluded at least
270,000 Palestinians who had been living there before 1967, but were absent during the
or other reasons. 786 Israeli authorities did not include these Palestinians in the population
registry, requiring them to obtain visitor permits to return to their homes and denying entry
to many, including all men aged 16 to 60, during the early years of the occupation. 787
Israeli authorities set up a restrictive family reunification process that operated until 2000
based on low annual quotas and subject to arbitrary and evolving criteria that failed to
take into account genuine familial or historical ties. 788
Between 1967 and 1994, Israeli authorities struck from the registry thousands of
Palestinians who traveled and stayed abroad for long periods. During this period, it
permanently canceled the registry of 140,000 registered Palestinians, solely because they
left the West Bank for a period of more than three years, according to data from the Office
of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli army
body in charge of administering the occupied West Bank. Authorities also during this same
period revoked the residency of 108,878 Palestinians from Gaza either for staying abroad
for more than seven years or for not being present during censuses conducted in 1981 and

16 who were born in the West Bank and Gaza, or who were born abroad if one parent was a registered resident. In 1987, with
the outbreak of the first Palestinian intifada, the military ordered that children under 16 who were born in the occupied
territory could only be registered if their mother was a resident, and that children born abroad could not be registered after
the age of five, regardless of either parent’s residency status. In 2000, authorities stopped granting entry to all unregistered
Palestinians more than five years old. Authorities in 2006 began to grant entry permits to Palestinian children for the
purpose allowing them to apply for registration, but it has refused to register children who turned 16 during the period from
2000 to 2006, when Israeli policies had made their entry and registration impossible.

Soon after its establishment, the PA in 1995 took on the task of handling requests to
update the population registry or apply for residency, but its role consists of transferring
those requests to the Israeli side for approval. 791 Since 2000, Israeli authorities have for
the most part refused to update the population registry or process applications for
residency by unregistered Palestinians, their spouses, and close relatives, even if they had
lived in the West Bank or Gaza for years and had families, homes, jobs, or other ties
there. 792 Israel entirely froze the “family reunification” process by which Palestinians
apply to grant legal status to join immediate relatives or spouses not registered in the
population registry. 793 Israeli authorities have cited the security situation following the
outbreak of the second Intifada as the rationale for the freeze, 794 but they have not
explained why their blanket refusal to process new applications is necessary for security

Civil Affairs Ministry estimated that, between September 2000 and August 2005 alone, it
relayed more than 120,000 applications for family reunification that Israeli authorities did
not process. 796 The Israeli Supreme Court opted in 2019 not to force the army to end its
freeze, following a challenge by the Israeli rights group HaMoked. 797 The two-decade-old
freeze has meant that Israeli authorities have stopped registering most categories of
people, with the exception of children who had at least one registered Palestinian parent.
Israeli authorities have also systematically barred entry to Israel and the West Bank over

35,000 Palestinians from Gaza were living in the West Bank with expired permits. 800 Israeli
law considers Palestinians with expired permits as unlawful “infiltrators,” 801 and
within the West Bank, fearing arrest at checkpoints and forcible return to Gaza, and often
face difficulties registering at schools or universities, doing business, or owning property.
Israel’s policies that deny Palestinians in the OPT the ability to live in or travel to the areas
they are from deny them “the right to freedom of movement and residency,” one of the
inhumane acts set out in the Apartheid Convention.
East Jerusalem
Israeli policies have also denied residency rights to thousands of Palestinians in East
Jerusalem and left many without nationality. Since its annexation of East Jerusalem in
1967, it has applied its 1952 Law of Entry to Palestinians from there and designated them
as “permanent residents,” the same status afforded to a foreigner who wants to live in
Israel. Permanent residents may live, work, and receive benefits, but that status derives
from their presence, can be revoked at the Interior Ministry’s discretion, and does not
automatically pass to one’s children or non-resident spouse even if they have lived in
Jerusalem for years. 803 A path to citizenship exists for Palestinian Jerusalemite permanent
residents, but the vast majority have chosen not to pursue it, as it involves recognizing
Israel, the occupying power, as the legitimate sovereign. The vast majority of those who
applied did not receive citizenship. Authorities rejected many applicants for failing to
demonstrate that Israel, and not the West Bank, was their “center of life,” or for their

Between the start of Israel’s occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967 and the end of 2020,
Israel revoked the permanent resident status of at least 14,701 Palestinians from East
Jerusalem. 805 Authorities have justified most revocations based on a failure to prove a
“center of life” in Jerusalem, targeting those it said had been living in other parts of the
OPT outside Jerusalem’s municipal borders or who had studied or lived abroad for
extended periods of time. Others lost their residency after obtaining permanent residency
or citizenship in another country. The number of revocations has dropped since 2015 when
the Interior Ministry said it would adopt “a more lenient approach” that would maintain
the residency of Palestinian Jerusalemites who “maintain a connection” to the city.” 806
Authorities have, though, in recent years revoked status to punish Palestinians accused of
attacking Israelis and as an act of collective punishment against their relatives. 807
Each revocation often has a much wider impact, as the families of persons who lose their
status often accompany them as they leave the city, and other Palestinians have to adjust
their lives to safeguard their precarious status. Palestinians from East Jerusalem have told
Human Rights Watch that the fear of losing this status weighs on their daily life,
determining where families live and deterring them from pursuing educational and

professional opportunities abroad. 808 By pushing Palestinians to leave their home city,

Israeli law authorizes arrest and deportation for those found without legal status. Without
that status, Palestinians cannot formally work, move freely, renew driver’s licenses, or
obtain birth certificates for children, which are needed to register them in school. They
could also lose benefits under Israel’s national insurance program, which provides social
welfare benefits, such as healthcare, unemployment benefits, and support payments for
children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Those who lose their residency can
petition the Interior Ministry to recover their status, during which time they can obtain a
temporary status to remain in Jerusalem. Some Palestinians have succeeded in reinstating
their status, but only after protracted legal and administrative processes that many
cannot afford. 810
In a March 2017 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Palestinians from East Jerusalem
enjoy “special status” as “native residents” that authorities should account for in
determining their status. 811 But Israeli policy continues to fail to do that in practice.

Mass Suspension of Civil Rights (West Bank, Gaza)
Israeli authorities have deprived generations of Palestinians in the OPT of their basic civil
rights, including the rights to free assembly, association, and expression. In particular,
authorities have targeted Palestinians for their anti-occupation speech, activism, and
affiliations, jailing thousands, outlawing hundreds of political and non-government
organizations, and shutting down dozens of media outlets. 812
In the West Bank, the army continues to rely on draconian military orders issued in the
early days of the occupation to criminalize non-violent political activity. Authorities, for
example, continue to apply British Mandate-era regulations that allow them to declare

430 organizations, including the Palestine Liberation Organization that Israel signed a

activity in an unlawful association” between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, according to
data it provided Human Rights Watch. 815
In addition, the army regularly uses military orders permitting it to shut down unlicensed
protests or to create closed military zones to suppress peaceful Palestinian
demonstrations in the West Bank and detain participants. 816 One military order, for
example, imposes a prison term of up to 10 years on civilians convicted by military courts
for participating in a gathering of more than 10 people without a military permit on any
issue “that could be construed as political” or for displaying “flags or political symbols”

While the law of occupation permits occupiers to restrict some civil and political rights
based on limited security justifications, the decades-long mass suspension of basic civil
rights for Palestinians in the OPT with no end in sight amounts to measures “calculated to
prevent” their “participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life” and create
“conditions preventing the[ir] full development” by denying them the rights to freedom of
expression, peaceful assembly, and association, specifically identified in the Apartheid
Convention. 821 When the sweeping restrictions result in unlawful arrests, they also
constitute a denial of the right of liberty by virtue of “arbitrary arrest and illegal
imprisonment” under the Apartheid Convention.

Other Abuses in Israel
Separately from the inhumane acts committed in the OPT, the Israeli government has
carried out other abuses against Palestinians within its pre-1967 borders.

Land Expropriation and Restrictions
Beginning in 1948 and in subsequent decades, Israeli authorities seized several million
dunams of land from Palestinians inside Israel. Many of the most serious abuses
described in this subsection, involving the massive confiscation of land from Palestinian
citizens of Israel, occurred between 1948 and 1966. While the plight of Palestinians in
Israel has generally improved since the lifting in 1966 of the martial law that Israeli
authorities imposed on them for the first 17 years of the country’s history, these violations
are continuing insofar as many of the victims remain unable to recover what authorities
seized from them, return to live in the villages they came from, or obtain compensation for
the losses they experienced.

A precise figure of the amount of land confiscated from Palestinians in Israel is not
available, in part as a result of the different forms of land ownership under Ottoman law
The pre-eminent historians of the era, though, largely estimate that Israeli authorities
confiscated at least 4.5 million dunams of land from Palestinians, constituting an
estimated 65 to 75 percent of all land owned by Palestinians before 1948, including 40 to
60 percent of the land belonging to Palestinians who remained and became Israeli
citizens. 823 Some historians also estimate that of the 370 Jewish towns and villages
established by the Israeli government between 1948 and 1953, 350 were built on land
confiscated from Palestinians. 824 Much of the confiscation took place between 1949 and
1966. During these years Israel subjected most Palestinians in Israel to military rule,
confined them to dozens of enclaves, and severely restricted their movement. Haaretz
reported, based on declassified government documents, that Israeli officials lifted military
rule in 1966 only after they had ensured that internally displaced Palestinians “could not
return to the villages they had fled or been expelled from.” 825
Israeli authorities used principally two mechanisms to seize land belonging to Palestinians
in Israel. First, in 1950, the Knesset, building on emergency regulations issued in
December 1948 to authorize land confiscations, passed the Absentees’ Property Law that
allowed the state to confiscate the land and homes of Palestinians not present on their
property in 1947 and 1948 amid the fighting in the events surrounding the establishment

of Israel and who had fled or were expelled to one of several neighboring or nearby Arab
countries or to “any part of Palestine outside the area of Israel,” including those places “in
of Israel or which fought against it after its establishment.” 826 Israeli authorities applied
the law to take hold of most of the land belonging to the hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees who came to reside outside of Israel, as well as land belonging to
Palestinians internally displaced as a result of the events of 1947 and 1948. Israeli
authorities placed the land under the control of the Custodian for Absentees’ Property and
eventually converted it to state land, almost exclusively used to build new Jewish
communities. 827 Israeli authorities have also used the Absentees’ Property Law to take
control of land belonging to Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem. 828
Second, the Israeli government declared many Palestinian towns and villages, particularly
those outside the enclaves that Palestinians lived in during the period of military rule, as
“closed areas.” It then passed in 1953 the Land Acquisition Law, which, building on a prior
emergency regulation, permitted the state to take ownership of land uncultivated since
1948. It also allowed the state to take over land in those cases where it did not recognize
claims of ownership filed by Palestinians, even if the land was under cultivation. The rights
group Adalah estimates that the Israeli government seized 1.2-1.3 million dunams of land
under the Land Acquisition Law. 829 The law offered compensation, but largely in the form
of “alternative plots that were either uncultivable or belonged to refugees in exile,” as one
historian wrote, or compensation based on rates so low that Israel’s then-Foreign Minister
and later Prime Minister Moshe Sharett referred to them as a “scandalous robbery.” 830

In a 2005 report, the Global IDP Project of the Norwegian Refugee Council estimated based
on a review of a range of sources that there were at the time between 150,000 and 300,000
Israel. 831 The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) found in 1998
that most of what they estimated to be around 200,000 internally displaced Palestinians,
who they refer to as “present absentees,” continue to be displaced and dispossessed within
the State because their lands were confiscated and not returned to them.” 832
Israeli authorities continue to block Palestinian citizen landowners from accessing or using
land that they confiscated from them. 833 For example, in November 1948, Israeli forces
expelled residents from the village of Iqrit, near the Lebanon border, after fighting in the
area had largely ended and soon after declaring Iqrit a closed military area. 834 Residents,
most of whom remained internally displaced inside Israel, filed a legal challenge against
their displacement and, in 1951, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that residents should be
allowed to return to their homes. 835 However, before the order could be carried out and
two months before another Supreme Court hearing on the case, the army blew up all the
houses still standing in the village. 836 Residents have continued to seek to return, but the
government has continued to block them, claiming in the 1960s, for example, that return
would constitute a security risk. 837 In 2003, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a new
petition by residents to return, determining the issue to be “political” and therefore
deferring to the government, which had determined that permitting Iqrit residents to return

Land confiscations and discriminatory land and housing policies have created a situation
where the majority of Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up around 19 percent of
Israel’s population, 840 live in crowded Palestinian municipalities, which have jurisdiction
over less than three percent of all land in Israel. 841

Coercive Practices in the Negev Region
Israeli authorities have also in some instances used coercive practices to restrict the rights
of Palestinian citizens of Israel. They have, for example, made it virtually impossible for
tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins residing in the Negev to live lawfully in the
communities they have lived in for decades. 842 Dating back to the formulation of the
state’s first formal plans in the 1960s, authorities have refused to legally recognize 35
Bedouin communities in the Negev, forcing their 90,000 or so residents, constituting more
than 28 percent of the Bedouin population in the Negev, to live under constant threat of
demolition. 843 Israeli law considers all buildings in these unrecognized villages illegal and
authorities have refused to connect most to the national electricity or water grids or
provide basic infrastructure, such as paved roads or sewage systems. 844 The communities

Israeli authorities have demolished thousands of Bedouin homes, many consisting of no
more than tents or shacks, over the course of decades. According to government data,
between 2013 and 2019, 10,697 structures belonging to Palestinian Bedouins were
demolished in the Negev, including 2,241 in 2019 alone, the majority by owners
themselves in the face of demolition orders and under threat of significant penalty. 846

For years, authorities have sought to concentrate Bedouins living in the Negev in
government-planned townships in order to maximize the land available for Jewish
communities. 849 Many Bedouins, though, see the development of these townships as an
effort to extinguish their land claims elsewhere in the Negev and do not view them as
acceptable residential options, given their lack of involvement in their development and
concerns about overcrowding and government neglect. 850 Those efforts continue;

Denial of Residency and Nationality
Effective Ban on Granting Status to Palestinian Spouses from the OPT
Israel’s Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003 bars Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza from residing with their spouse in Israel or East
Jerusalem. 852 The temporary order, enacted by the Knesset in July 2003, renewed every
year since and upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, prohibits with few exceptions the
granting of residency or citizenship to Palestinian ID holders, even if married to an Israeli
citizen or permanent resident. 853 While Israeli authorities already restricted family
reunification before 2003, this law has brought the process to a near halt. 854
The law denies Israeli citizens and residents, both Jewish and Palestinian, who marry
Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza the right enjoyed by other Israelis to live
with their loved ones in the place of their choosing. This denial is based on the spouse’s
ethnicity rather than on an individualized assessment of security risk. If an Israeli marries
a foreign spouse who is Jewish, the spouse can obtain citizenship automatically. Other
foreigners can receive immediate status and normally become eligible for citizenship after
living in Israel for several years. 855 Palestinian men over 35 and women over 25 from the

restrictions. They must either live separately or have the Israeli citizen or resident spouse
move to the West Bank, despite Israeli military orders prohibiting Israelis from living in

the OPT. 860 International human rights law guarantees to refugees and exiles the right to
enter the territory they are from, even where sovereignty is contested or has changed
links to. 861 Like refugees in other contexts, Palestinian refugees should be given the
opportunity to freely decide between returning to their country of origin, local integration,
or third-country resettlement. 862 The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has registered 5.7 million Palestinian refugees. 863
Many remain stateless and have lived for generations in crowded refugee camps in poor
conditions in the OPT, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. 864

Conclusion
Israeli authorities have deprived millions of people of their basic rights by virtue of their
identity as Palestinians. These longstanding policies and systematic practices box in,
dispossess, forcibly separate, marginalize, and otherwise inflict suffering on Palestinians.
In the OPT, movement restrictions, land expropriation, forcible transfer, denial of residency
and nationality, and the mass suspension of civil rights constitute “inhuman[e] acts” set
out under the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. Under both legal standards,
inhumane acts when carried out amid systematic oppression and with the intent to
maintain domination make up the crime against humanity of apartheid. 865

Collectively, these policies and practices in the OPT severely deprive Palestinians of
fundamental human rights, including to residency, private property, and access to land,
discriminatory intent, on the basis of the victims’ identity as part of a group or collectivity,
they amount to the crime against humanity of persecution under the Rome Statute and
customary international law.
Separately from the inhumane acts carried out in the OPT, the Israeli government violates
the rights of Palestinians inside Israel on account of their identity, including measures that
have made it virtually impossible for tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins living in
the Negev to live lawfully in the communities; the denial to hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians of the ability to access or use land confiscated from them historically; the
effective bar on citizens and residents obtaining long-term legal status to and thereby
living permanently together in Israel with spouses from the West Bank and Gaza, which
deprives them of the ability to live together permanently in Israel; and the denial of
residency rights to Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the events
around the establishment of the state.
These abuses continue and there is no indication that authorities have investigated, much
less held accountable, anyone involved in their commission.

These recommendations stem from Human Rights Watch’s finding that Israeli authorities
are committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.
Human Rights Watch found that the Israeli government has pursued an intent to maintain
the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians throughout the territory it controls. In
the OPT, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled with systematic
oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them. When these three
elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.
Israeli authorities are also committing the crime against humanity of persecution based on
the discriminatory intent behind Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and the grave abuses it
has carried out in the OPT.

To the State of Israel
•

Dismantle all forms of systematic oppression and discrimination that privilege
Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians and otherwise systematically violate
Palestinian rights in order to ensure the dominance of Jewish Israelis, and end the
persecution of Palestinians, including by ending discriminatory policies and
practices in such realms as citizenship and nationality processes, protection of
civil rights, freedom of movement, allocation of land and resources, access to
water, electricity, and other services, and granting of building permits.

•

Fully respect the human rights of Palestinians, including those in the OPT, as well
as the protections owed to Palestinians in the OPT under international
humanitarian law.

•

Cease construction and expansion of settlements, dismantle existing settlements,
and bring Israeli citizens inhabiting settlements in the West Bank, including East
Jerusalem, back within Israel’s internationally-recognized borders.

•

End the generalized ban on travel to and from Gaza and permit the free movement
of people to and from Gaza, and in particular between Gaza and the West Bank,

•

Repeal discriminatory laws and legal provisions in favor of legislation that is rooted

The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)—2003, which
allows Israeli citizens and residents to obtain legal status for their non-Israeli
spouses, but not if the spouses are Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza,
who are explicitly ineligible under this law with few exceptions;

o

Provisions in the 2011 Admission Commissions Law that effectively allow
discrimination by residents of small towns inside Israel against prospective
residents on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or national origin;

o

Provisions in the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People that
discriminate between Jews and non-Jews with regard to the right to selfdetermination and to housing.

•

Remove arbitrary restrictions on residency rights for Palestinian residents of East
Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip and their families, including by
stopping the practice of revoking the residency of Palestinians in East Jerusalem,
ending the effective freeze on family reunification applications in the West Bank
and Gaza since 2000, and allowing Palestinians to resettle in other parts of the OPT
and register their new addresses.

Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu
Prime Minister of the State of Israel
Office of the Prime Minister
Dear Mr. Prime Minister,
I write to request your assistance in obtaining information pertaining to Israel’s treatment
of Palestinians inside Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. We would greatly appreciate the opportunity
to understand your perspectives on these issues, so they can be reflected in a forthcoming
Human Rights Watch report on them. For this to happen, we would need to receive your
responses by Monday, August 10.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) is an international human rights organization, whose head
office is located in New York City. The organization publishes reports on the state of human
rights in nearly 100 countries worldwide, with the objective of defending human rights and
promoting respect for international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch has covered
human rights issues in Israel and Palestine for nearly three decades and, in that time, has
regularly met and corresponded with Israeli officials.
Human Rights Watch’s forthcoming report examines Israeli laws, policies and practices
affecting Palestinians in Israel, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
compares them to the treatment of Jewish Israelis living in the same or nearby areas. The
report draws on years of research by Human Rights Watch and other rights organizations, a
review of laws, government planning documents, statements by officials, land records and
field work conducted for this report.
Our research has been examining whether Israeli authorities have carried out grave abuses
on a systematic basis against Palestinians, and whether these occurred in a context of a
discriminatory system or systems designed to ensure the dominance of Jewish Israelis over
Palestinians. We are examining the extent to which Israeli officials have carried out any

4.33.c

To better understand and reflect the perspective of the Israeli government on these issues,
we would appreciate answers to the following questions:
1. Do Israeli laws, policies and practices treat Palestinians living in Israel and in areas
under Israeli control in a manner equal to the way they treat Jewish Israelis living in
these same areas?
a. If so, what is the Israeli government’s response to claims of discrimination
against Palestinians?
b. If not, please describe all measures being taken by the Israeli government
to ensure equality.
2. Why do Israeli authorities significantly restrict travel for Palestinians between the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip? Does the government maintain a policy of
separating Gaza and the West Bank? If this policy is motivated by security
considerations, please explain how the government balances this consideration
against the right of Palestinians to freedom of movement.
3. Data from the Civil Administration obtained by Bimkom indicates that, between
2016 and 2018, Israeli authorities approved less than 1.5 percent of applications by
Palestinians to build in Area C, 21 applications in total, while issuing 2,147
demolition orders. Why does the Israeli Civil Administration reject such a high
percentage of permits for Palestinians to build in Area C of the West Bank and
demolish structures built without a permit at a rate higher than for such structures
built by Israeli settlers?
4. Data from the Civil Administration obtained by the Israeli group Peace Now in 2018
indicates that Israeli authorities have allocated 99.76% of all “state land”
allocated to third parties in the West Bank to serve the needs of Israeli settlers.
Why has so little state land been allocated for use by Palestinians in the West Bank
as compared to settlers?
5. Why do Israeli authorities continue to wield significant influence over the
Population Registry in the OPT, including in the Gaza Strip nearly 15 years after its
disengagement from Gaza? Why have authorities since September 2000 refused to

abuses pursuant to long-standing policies and practices and whether they form part of the

Israeli control over land in Israel and the West Bank.

process applications, outside of those processed as a “gesture” to the PA between
November 2007 and March 2009, for Palestinians in the OPT to grant legal status to
those not already in the Population Registry, or even change their addresses? If the
policy is motivated by security considerations, why is it that an effectively blanket
refusal to process new applicants, as opposed to a policy of making individualized
assessments, is necessary to ensure security?
6. Why do authorities continue to revoke the residency status of Palestinian
Jerusalemites who they have determined no longer “maintain a connection” to the
city?
7. Is there a government policy to seek to maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem? If
so, why?
8. Colin Hames, the former head of Israeli government body in charge of supplying
services to neighborhoods in Jerusalem beyond the separation barrier, the
Jerusalem Envelope Administration, described the government’s “neglect” of these
areas, including Kufr Aqab. Why have authorities effectively failed to police,
regulate construction or in large part provide basic services to residents?
9. Why does the Israeli government bar with few exceptions the granting of Israeli
citizenship or long-term legal status to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
who marry Israeli citizens and residents, a restriction that does not apply to Jewish
spouses of Israeli citizens and residents? What role, if any, does demographics and
in particular any objective to foster a Jewish majority factor into the annual renewal
and the enforcement of this law and, more generally, in the formulation of Israeli
governmental policy on issues related to citizenship, nationality and residency
rights and access to and allocation of land and resources?
10. Why do Israeli authorities deny residency rights to Palestinian refugees who fled or
were expelled from their homes inside today’s Israel between 1947 and 1949, while
guaranteeing it to Jewish citizens of other countries, including those who have
never been to Israel?
11. Why have authorities refused to grant legal status to several dozen Palestinian
Bedouin communities in the Negev, making it impossible for more than 70,000
Bedouins to reside lawfully in the communities that they have lived in for decades?

The widely held assumption that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is a temporary situation and
that the “peace process” will soon bring an end to Israeli abuses has obscured the reality on the ground today
of Israel’s entrenched discriminatory rule over Palestinians. A single authority, the Israeli government, rules
primarily over the area between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea, populated by two groups of roughly
equal size, methodologically privileging Jewish Israelis while repressing Palestinians, most severely in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), made-up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.

Drawing on years of human rights documentation, case studies and a review of government planning
documents, statements by officials and other sources, A Threshold Crossed: Israeli Authorities and the Crimes
of Apartheid and Persecution examines Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and evaluates whether particular
Israeli policies and practices in certain areas amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and
persecution.

The crime of apartheid refers to inhumane acts committed in the context of systematic oppression by one racial
group over another and with the intent to dominate the marginalized group. Persecution consists of severe
abuses of fundamental rights committed with discriminatory intent.
Across Israel and the OPT, Israeli authorities have pursued an intent to maintain domination over Palestinians
by exercising control over land and demographics for the benefit of Jewish Israelis. In the OPT, the intent has
been coupled with inhumane acts, including sweeping movement restrictions, mass land confiscation and the
suspension of civil rights for millions of Palestinians, carried out amid systematic oppression.
On this basis, the report concludes that Israeli officials have committed the crimes against humanity of
apartheid and persecution.

WHEREAS:

The climate crisis continues to worsen and disproportionately impacts the most
vulnerable members of our community; and

WHEREAS:

To effectively respond to this crisis, we need to completely decarbonize the US economy
in the next ten years by enacting a Green New Deal at every level of government; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s extraordinary financial position and status as a global center of innovation
represent a mandate for the city to truly lead the way on the most pressing issue of our
time; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge is a true leader on constructing all electric net zero ready and net zero
emissions municipal buildings, including the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School
Complex, but the vast majority of the city’s emissions come from commercial buildings,
including especially laboratory buildings, which means total emissions have only
continued to increase over time as we’ve added many millions of new square feet of
commercial development; and

WHEREAS:

All the technological and economic feasibility now exists to build all-electric net zero
emissions buildings in Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

While almost all of our building emissions come from the existing building stock,
decarbonizing existing buildings is expensive and difficult, so we need to mandate net
zero new construction as soon as possible; and

WHEREAS:

On December 11, 2019, the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council voted
to refer a proposed ordinance banning natural gas combustion in new buildings to the full
City Council with a favorable recommendation; and

WHEREAS:

Attorney General Maura Healey struck down Brookline’s proposed bylaw to ban natural
gas hookups in new construction via the building code, making it legally challenging for
Cambridge to adopt the proposed ordinance without a home rule petition; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition (attached) would provide a framework
for accepting local emissions offsets to strengthen green jobs programs and energy
efficiency upgrades to the existing building stock, creating economic opportunity for our
most vulnerable residents who are too often left behind; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition would exempt all new housing
construction, which is not a significant driver of emissions, while creating opportunities
to improve energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in the existing housing
stock; and
Packet Pg. 932

6.2

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council is committed to rapid decarbonization in a way that creates
economic opportunity and climate justice for our most vulnerable residents; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council amend the Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Cambridge entitled “SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT” to insert a new
section 22.24.4 to read as follows:
22.24.4 Emissions Accounting.
The provisions in this section shall not apply to any residential buildings
that include affordable units.
a. Embodied Emissions: As a condition of receiving an occupancy
permit, the developer shall provide to CDD an accounting of the
emissions generated by the construction of any Green Building
Project. The Embodied Emissions shall be documented by a licensed
engineer, using Passive House or other acceptable energy and
emissions modeling software, and include:
1. Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used,
including associated raw materials extraction, production
and transportation.
2. Estimates for transportation emissions caused by delivering
the materials to the construction site.
3. Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such as
cranes.
b. The Embodied Emissions shall not include:
1. Emissions associated with installing renewable energy
facilities on site, including but not limited to solar PV and
solar hot water, air source and ground source heat pumps,
and any other systems that substantially reduce the future
emissions of the building.
2. Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual
transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.).
3. Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and plants
to the site.
4. Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle
charging infrastructure (EVSE).

c. Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an
accounting of the expected emissions to be generated by routine
operation of the building over the course of one calendar year.
Emissions will be calculated as metric tons of CO2 equivalent using
a formula approved by CDD, taking into account the local emissions
profile for the grid at the time the building is first occupied to
Packet Pg. 933

6.2

convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into emissions. The
Expected Annual Emissions shall include:
1. Emissions from any permanently installed onsite combustion
such as a natural gas boiler to heat the building.
2. Emissions from grid electricity delivered to the building for
operating any permanently installed equipment and lights in
the building, including but not limited to HVAC systems,
elevators, and light fixtures.
d. The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include:
1. Renewable energy systems such as solar PV systems
installed prior to occupancy that net meter to the building
itself.
2. Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel
combustion (e.g. a natural gas appliance).
3. Backup generators.
4. Transportation emissions associated with the building
operation.
5. Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the
building.
e. Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions
from the building will be calculated based on a formula approved by
CDD, and will include the following:
1. The expected decline of grid emissions, reaching zero no
later than 2050.
2. Expected emissions reductions under the BEUDO regime.
3. Any long term contracts to directly purchase 100%
renewable energy sourced from the FERC New England
region (such as solar or wind generated energy, or biogas)
entered into between the building operator and certified (by
CDD) providers of 100% renewable energy shall be
subtracted from the total. For example, if the developer has
signed a contract for 10 years for the total expected grid
electrical consumption to come from renewable sources, the
first 10 years of grid electrical consumption shall be
considered emissions free and would not contribute to the
lifetime expected total emissions.
4. The formula will assume that no grid emissions will be
generated by the building past 2050, and that any onsite
fossil fuel equipment will also have been replaced by 2050,
so that the building emissions will be modeled as a declining
schedule reaching zero no later than 2050.

Packet Pg. 934

6.2

f.

Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated by
the building will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and the
Lifetime Expected Emissions.

g. The developer will present a payment schedule for how to zero out
the Total Emissions of the building, using a social cost of carbon
formula approved by CDD. The payment schedule may be
annualized over a period not to exceed 10 years. The outstanding
balance shall act as a lien on the property in case it is sold. Any
offset must demonstrate direct benefits to low-income and minority
communities in Cambridge, including economic opportunity through
job creation and or financial savings through e.g. utility bill
reductions. Acceptable offsets must be approved by CDD, and will
include:
1. No less than 25% of the mitigation funds shall be spent on
green jobs development programs, including education and
training, to help build capacity for energy efficiency and
renewable energy projects in Cambridge. Any such program
must be free of cost to participants, and successful
completion of the program must lead to a certification in a
specific skill such as, for example: Solar Installer,
Weatherization Installer and Technician, Building Energy
Analyst, Urban Forestry or Urban Agriculture. Specific
criteria and certifications will be set by CDD via regulation.
2. Payment for energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings
located in the City of Cambridge.
3. Payment into the City of Cambridge Renewable Energy and
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Revolving Fund for reducing
emission in public projects, including affordable housing
developments.
4. Payment for the installation of new solar PV systems to be
located in the City of Cambridge.
5. Payment for the creation of community solar PV
installations that benefit Cambridge residents by making
discounted solar generated electricity available to them.
Such systems need not be located in Cambridge but must be
located in the Northeast Massachusetts and Boston (NEMA)
load zone.
6. Payment for direct supply contracts of 100% renewable
electricity from sources within the FERC ISO New England
assigned to another building(s) in the City of Cambridge,
including via participation in Cambridge’s Community
Choice Electricity (CCE) program.

May 20, 2021
Mr. Anthony Wilson
Clerk of Cambridge
Cambridge City Hall
Dear Mr. Clerk:
Please include this correspondence on the agenda as part of Communications and Reports from
Other City Officers for the City Council meeting scheduled for May 24, 2021.
On June 29, 2020, the City Council passed a policy order stating that “the City of Cambridge should
consider and evaluate an effective, unarmed, Public Health and Human service response mechanism…to
redefine what Public Safety looks like, and develop an alternative public health response with the ultimate
goal of decreasing arrests, increasing connections to critical housing, addiction and other services, and
ensuring that Public Safety feels safe for all residents.” To initiate this process, the City Manager convened
a Task Force – comprised of Cambridge residents coming from a variety of differing backgrounds,
experiences, and viewpoints – that was charged with developing a set of recommendations that would speak
to the policy order’s stated goals.
These recommendations, and the work that went into arriving at them, are being now being
presented to the City Council and the Cambridge community, in the form of the attached City Manager’s
Public Safety Task Force Report. As the Co-Chairs appointed to this task force, we shall now turn our
attention to working with the City Manager to commence a robust process of soliciting public feedback on
these recommendations, and ultimately the City Manager shall be charged with actualizing the
recommendations in the coming months. We look forward to embarking upon the next phase of this process,
and to gaining the community’s feedback on the attached report.
We would also like to thank all of the Task Force members who volunteered virtually every
Tuesday evening over the past several months, not to mention time outside of scheduled meetings, to
address this crucial conversation.
Sincerely,

City Councilor E. Denise Simmons

City Councilor Marc C. McGovern

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL
REPORT FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY TASK FORCE
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
On May 25, 2020, 46-year-old George Floyd, an African-American individual, was murdered
during the process of his being arrested (for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill) in Minneapolis, MN.
This horrific, senseless act of racially-based police brutality ignited a firestorm across the country, as
protesters took to the streets in cities across America and demanded that the country begin to face up to its
systemic racism, and particularly to the tragic, far-too-numerous incidents of people of color being harassed,
brutalized, and murdered by police officers.
To be certain, cities like Minneapolis1, of Kenosha2, or Louisville3– each of which had a high profile
incident of police-initiated, racially-based violence and/or murder that made it to national headlines in 2020
– represent the most extreme examples of police departments that are anathema to the very concept of
“public safety;” rather than serving as a department designed to keep the peace and protect people, these
police departments have demonstrably failed in their core mission of keeping all residents safe, and have
even targeted some of the members of their community for harassment, violence, and murder.
Not all police departments engage in the kinds of shameful, unconscionable actions that the abovecited police departments have done – yet the national condemnation that came about following the murders
of Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and far too many other people of color at the hands of
police officers has forced conversations in communities of all experiences. Even cities like Cambridge,
where the Police Department is looked to as a national leader in proactive, progressive, community-based
policing, have seen a groundswell of support for re-examining the concept of how we keep the members of
our community safe, and what the best practices in public safety truly ought to be.
In the weeks following Mr. Floyd’s murder, members of the community, of the City Council, and
of organizations providing various social services throughout Cambridge began to consider that one way to
decrease the footprint of the Cambridge Police Department in our community would be to re-examine how
the City responds to emergency calls from members of the public, in recognition of the fact that 911 calls
tend to be one of the predominant gateways between members of the public and the criminal justice system.
The notion that perhaps redirecting certain categories of these 911 calls away from the CPD and instead
having a different systemic response – particularly by first responders who do not carry weapons – began
to gain currency.

CURRENT WORK OF THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE
Before discussing reducing the footprint of the Cambridge Police Department in our community, it
is important to have a greater understanding of what that footprint currently consists of. There is, of course,
the work that falls under what we traditionally think of as “police work,” i.e., the investigation of major
crimes4 such as thefts, burglaries, sexual assaults, murders, as well as engaging in regular patrols5 of various
neighborhoods as part of a community policing6 effort. Yet, in recent decades, the Cambridge Police have
also increasingly engaged in work that might be classified under “connecting individuals with

Attachment: Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force SIGNED - FINAL (COF 2021 #51 : Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force)

7.1.a

Packet Pg. 942

social services.” This work includes continual outreach to the local unhoused community7 and connecting
unhoused individuals to the appropriate short-term and long-term support services, responding to 911 calls
concerning those experiencing mental health crises8, responding to 911 calls from those in the midst of
domestic disturbances and/or domestic violence situations,9 and working with young people10 in danger of
getting swept up in the criminal justice system, offering them a more positive path.
In this work, the Cambridge Police have fostered important strategic alliances with a number of
community partners, including the ROCA11 organization (for helping to divert young people from the
criminal justice system, and helping those exiting prison with their reentry into society), First Step12
(assisting with homelessness), Transition House13 (for working with survivors of domestic violence), and
the BID outreach workers14 who work to connect people in Central Square with critical support services.
As in other communities, the Cambridge Police have gradually assumed more and more15 of this
work in connecting community members with social services and similar obligations over time16 as funding
for federal, state, and private departments and programs17 has gradually disappeared or been redirected.

ASSESSING CITY’S CURRENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE DATA
In an effort to better understand the types of emergency calls that typically come in to the City, and
the volume \ by neighborhood, the Department of Emergency Communications and 911 compiled a
summary of all psych/pink slip18 incidents by neighborhood, and included the corresponding Reporting
Areas (RA) for total incidents by year. In the initial review, the highest area of these types of calls for the
past 5 years are as follows:
Five (5) year avg:

●
Mid Cambridge
●
Riverside
●
The Port
●

●

Wellington/West Cambridge (tied)

This summary also includes the map of reporting areas within the neighborhoods defined.
“Neighborhoods” is the macro lens we use to capture call data and the Reporting Areas are the micro lens
within the neighborhood. The Reporting Areas are the shortest segment within the neighborhood that we
use for response plans and to ensure anonymity [See Appendix A].

The Department of Emergency Communications and 911 also prepared a map of all 911 calls
pertaining to mental health emergencies placed to the Cambridge 911 system in 2020, broken down by
neighborhood. The darker the neighborhood on the map indicates a greater number of calls in that area.
[See Appendix B]
The above referenced information provides a general overview of the kinds of calls that have been
coming into the City’s 911 system in recent years, and this information provided a reasonable starting point
for the City to begin deliberating on where, and how, we might be able to re-imagine a different kind of
emergency response, and how we might reduce the footprint of the Cambridge Police in our community.

INITIATING CITY REVIEW OF PUBLIC SAFETY MODEL
In response to the public’s strong desire for the municipal government to begin taking firm steps
reviewing how the City handles its public safety responsibilities, and to the demands that the City be willing
to consider new models of public safety and emergency response, the City Council took up and passed the
following policy order on June 29, 2020:19
WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council recently declared racism as a Public Health crisis; and

WHEREAS:

The recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have elevated the
conversation around where traditional Public Safety and policing intersects with
social services, and there has been a national call for alternative emergency responses
for non-emergency related situations; and

WHEREAS:

Currently the definition of Public Safety only includes Police, Fire and EMTs, and
said definition must be redefined to include Public Health and Human Services; and

Attachment: Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force SIGNED - FINAL (COF 2021 #51 : Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force)

7.1.a

Packet Pg. 944

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Police Department is the only response option when non-violent calls
are received by Emergency Communications Department, calls that involve mental
health, housing and homelessness issues, grief and trauma response, suicide
prevention assessment and intervention and others that could be better served by an
unarmed Public Health and Human Services response; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Police Department has made tremendous efforts in the last decade to
intentionally reconceptualize public safety, which currently includes programs
performed by non-sworn employees such as; social workers who specialize in mental
health and addiction recovery, domestic violence advocates, an on-staff Child
Psychologist, and more, and this model would not be intended to replace those
program, but to enhance and create a co-response alternative model that includes the
Public Health and Human Services departments; and

WHEREAS:

Unarmed alternative emergency response programs exist across the country that can
serve as a model for Cambridge to develop a program that works for our community;
and

WHEREAS:

Programs like CAHOOTS20 (Crisis Assisting Help on the Streets), in Oregon work in
tandem with Emergency Communications to triage whether traditional Public Safety
is dispatched, or an unarmed team that is better prepared to perform Health and
Human Service functions; and

WHEREAS:

The CAHOOTS model consists of a medic (either a nurse or an EMT), and a crisis
worker (who has at least several years experience in the mental health field).
CAHOOTS provides immediate stabilization in case of urgent medical need or
psychological crisis, assessment, information, referral, advocacy, and (in some cases)
transportation to the next step in treatment; and

WHEREAS:

CAHOOTS offers a broad range of services, including but not limited to:
·
Crisis Counseling
·
Suicide Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention
·
Conflict Resolution and Mediation
·
Grief and loss
·
Substance Abuse
·
Housing Crisis
·
First Aid and Non-Emergency Medical Care
·
Resource Connection and Referrals
·
Transportation to Services; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge should consider and evaluate an effective, unarmed, Public
Health and Human service response mechanism, like in Oregon, Miami, Dallas,
Nashville and others to redefine what Public Safety looks like, and develop an
alternative public health response with the ultimate goal of decreasing arrests,
increasing connections to critical housing, addiction and other services, and ensuring
that Public Safety feels safe for all residents; therefore now be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Police Department, Emergency
Communications Department, Department of Public Health, Department of Human
Services and other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of an alternative
Public Safety Crisis Response System, which department would be responsible for it,
and how it would be funded and implemented in FY2022, and report back to the
Council by September 14th; and be it further

7.1.a

Packet Pg. 947

sub-groups of two or three to commence formulating recommendations around each of the following areas:
Mental Health, Domestic Violence, Restorative Justice, Homelessness, Other Community Safety Options,
and Community Outreach. The subgroups met over a period of weeks and then reconvened to present their
thoughts and ideas to the larger group on May 4, 2021. Please see Appendix C for the recommendations
from the sub-groups as presented at that meeting.

TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS IN THIS
PROCESS
The Task Force Co-Chairs have taken the ideas, recommendations, and concepts provided by each
of the subgroups and have distilled them into the recommendations outlined below, which represent the
Task Force’s response to the charge it was provided with by the City Manager upon its formation. It should
be noted that, as public input is solicited and received, these recommendations may evolve.
PRIMARY TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The City of Cambridge should create a new Department, called the Cambridge Department of
Community Safety (CDCS), which has primary responsibility over city services and all 911 calls
related to the following categories:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mental health emergencies, including some suicide-related calls and wellness checks
Unhoused residents
Non-emergency medical services
Substance abuse incidents
Public nuisance complaints
Crisis counseling
Grief and loss counseling
Resource connections and community referrals
Emergency transportation services to community resources

2. The new Cambridge Department of Community Safety should be a City Department organized
outside of, and entirely independent from, the Cambridge Police Department and any other
emergency services department, though we recognize, that like the CAHOOTS model, there may
be instances when a police response is required. At such a time, we recommend that members of
the CDCS should remain on scene, if safety allows, to provide additional support.
3. The Cambridge Department of Community Safety should consist of a Director, as well as enough
staff to allow for a Peer/Professional model of response, and of support staff. The “response staff”
will be large enough to allow for no less than 2 staff to respond to any calls that fall into the above
categories on a 24/7 basis. “Peer” will be defined as a non-professional, non-licensed, community
member. “Professional” will be defined as a licensed social worker or licensed mental health
professional.
4. The Cambridge Department of Community Safety should be fully integrated into the city’s 911
system, and should have at least one staff member, trained in mental health/social work, serving as
a CDCS liaison staffed within the City’s 911 Emergency Response Unit on a 24/7 basis to handle
and triage calls and to help determine if the call is appropriate for the CDCS or another emergency
response. The DCS liaison should be fully informed of what services the CDCS can provide.
5. In addition to being reachable via 911, the Cambridge Department of Community Safety should
have its own three-digit number other than 911. We recognize that many people, at least for the
foreseeable future, will call 911 as that is the number they are most familiar with, which is one
reason why we recommend a CDCS liaison be placed within the 911 unit.

Attachment: Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force SIGNED - FINAL (COF 2021 #51 : Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force)

7.1.a

Packet Pg. 948

7.1.a

7. The new CDCS should be a uniformed service, but those uniforms should be impossible to confuse
with police uniforms. CDCS responders will be unarmed.
8. CDCS responders will require significant training in de-escalation strategies and should not be
required to engage if they feel the situation is a danger to themselves or others. CDCS responders
should be equipped with radios to allow them to call for CPD support if needed.
9. The Department of Community Safety should have an auxiliary response capability, as opposed to
a primary response capability, to assist other emergency responders with incidents of domestic
violence or other similar incidents of interpersonal violence or disturbances. The CDCS should
have trauma-informed staff or community partners who can be dispatched 24/7 to a domestic
violence incident with the police, and to assist survivors of a domestic violence incident after the
scene is clear, as the individual situation warrants. These CDCS staff or community partners should
be able to provide assistance directly and also be able to connect survivors and others at risk with
existing community resources.
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The City should allocate sufficient funds to engage in a comprehensive community process that
reaches out to all members of the community, with an emphasis on those who have been most
negatively impacted by structural and institutional racism, to solicit feedback and refinement
from the public on these initial recommendations of this task force. We recognize that there are
community conversations already taking place on this issue and any community process should
reach out to and take into account the work being done by these organizations for consideration.
2. The City should allocate sufficient funds to hire a facilitator or facilitators with experience in this
area to organize and lead the aforementioned broad community process.
3. After soliciting and incorporating comprehensive public feedback on these recommendations, the
City should consider funding a pilot program (or programs) to begin the process of creating an
alternative response to specified public safety calls that could grow into the Department of
Community Safety if successful.
4. The City and the Department of Community Safety should consider enhancing partnerships with
organizations already addressing these issues in the community, potentially through increased
funding to these organizations. For example, the City should fund a new position at Transition
House - The Director of Equity and Justice. The position will work strategically to advance our
mission to end domestic violence and strengthen our work through an anti-racist lens. This role is
focused on internally examining and transforming our work to best meet the needs of survivors
from all walks of life and externally on fostering community relationships to learn, apply, and share
transformative practices.
5. The City should establish a citywide respite center for unhoused individuals that can provide a
safe space as well as services, including (but not limited to): counseling, showers, meals, haircuts,
clothes, laundry, etc.
6. While the new CDCS should have primary jurisdiction over calls and services that have long
defaulted to CPD, the City should continue to invest in CPD training and resources that have helped
the department better work with the city’s vulnerable populations over the years. CPD should
maintain its co-response model, innovative training modalities, and Family and Social

Attachment: Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force SIGNED - FINAL (COF 2021 #51 : Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force)

6. CDCS responders should be equipped to contact CPD or other city emergency services for safety
on calls using existing emergency service communications networks.

Packet Pg. 949

7.1.a

7. The City should further explore and invest in restorative justice practices, including the possibility
of creating an Office of Restorative Justice, possibly within the Department of Community Safety.
8. A new position, the Manager of Community Engagement, should be established within the City
Manager’s Office, to ensure a more uniform level and model of community outreach and
engagement exists throughout all City departments.

ADDITIONAL AREAS TO CONSIDER:
1. Because of its proven track record of success, the City should look to the CAHOOTS program as a
model for the scope and breadth of services the Cambridge Department of Community Safety might
eventually provide, as well as for lessons learned and best practices. At the same time, the City
should recognize that the CAHOOTS program as it exists today evolved over decades in response
to specific needs and aspirations in its local community, which may not be the same as those that
exist in Cambridge today. Gathering comprehensive community input to shape, refine, and edit
these recommendations now and over time is crucial to the long term impact, success, and viability
of the CDCS, both as the department is being formed and as part of its operations into the future.
The program of the CDCS must be the program set by the community.
2. Mandated Reporting: We understand that like all systems, mandated reporting and mental health
services have deep roots in racism and white supremacy culture. We also understand that at times
mandating reporting is necessary when one or more people are at risk to themselves or others. How
mandating reporting fits in to the Department of Community Safety needs further review, keeping
in mind state law and liability issues.
3. The City should conduct a full needs assessment of programs and non-profit agencies working with
domestic violence, homelessness, and mental health, in the City of Cambridge to create a
comprehensive mapping of what services are available outside of the City and how those services
can better work together to create a stronger safety net for those who need support.
4. Following the full implementation of these recommendations and the transfer of primary
responsibility for the above listed categories of 911 calls, the City should continue to look at ways
to transfer responsibility for emergency calls for non-violent incidents away from the Cambridge
Police Department to the Department of Community Safety or to other city departments.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS AND AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT
As the recommendations of this committee are taken to the members of the public for consideration
and feedback, and as the City Manager seeks ways to actualize the final recommendations that are
ultimately brought forward to him, it is critical that these recommendations be viewed through the language
of the policy order that initiated this process:29 “The City of Cambridge should consider and evaluate an
effective, unarmed, Public Health and Human service response mechanism, like in Oregon, Miami, Dallas,
Nashville and others to redefine what Public Safety looks like, and develop an alternative public health
response with the ultimate goal of decreasing arrests, increasing connections to critical housing, addiction
and other services, and ensuring that Public Safety feels safe for all residents.” It is equally critical that
people be mindful that this same policy order directs that “...the City Manager [should] confer with the
Cambridge Police Department, Emergency Communications Department,

Attachment: Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force SIGNED - FINAL (COF 2021 #51 : Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force)

Justice Section. There will always be a need for increased social justice training and diversion
opportunities within CPD.

Packet Pg. 950

Department of Public Health, Department of Human Services and other relevant departments to determine
the feasibility of an alternative Public Safety Crisis Response System, which department would be
responsible for it, and how it would be funded and implemented.” While the members of this task force
engaged in thoughtful discussions and deliberations in coming up with recommendations, there are some
instances where these recommendations are being offered more as general guideposts and governing
principles that, it is hoped and expected, the City Manager and other appropriate City personnel will flesh
out and incorporate into a viable final product.
It is also important to note that not every decision and recommendation contained in this report
represents a 100 percent consensus among the task force members. Indeed, the biggest area of disagreement
among some of the members was the very structure of this task force and of this process. Some task force
members suggested that this process should begin with a series of public meetings in which the members
of the public would be presented with “a blank slate” upon which they could voice their opinions, concerns,
and criticisms of the City’s current public safety policies and procedures, before moving on toward
providing ideas for re-imagining those policies and procedures. Other task force members urged that every
meeting of the task force should be open and viewable to all the members of the public. Still other task
force members urged that additional members of the public, from different backgrounds and with differing
experiences and viewpoints, should be invited to either present to the task force or be made members of the
task force. And, lastly, some task force members argued that the scope of this task force was too limited.
Again, the contents of this report represent the broad consensus of the majority of the task force
members, and the task force Chairs took pains to respectfully address any concerns that were raised
throughout this process. The members of the task force were advised that, as this was a working group
convened by the City Manager, it was his discretion as to whom would be invited to participate and how
the process would be structured (and, it should be noted, this is similar in structure and operation to a
number of other City Manager-convened working groups that have been convened in recent years). As to
the scope of work, this was dictated by the initial policy order that called for the task force’s creation, and
neither the City Manager nor the task force chairs have ruled out the possibility of re-convening this task
force, or convening a similar task force, to examine other related public safety issues in the future.

NEXT STEPS AND FINAL THOUGHTS
The items listed in the sections above represent the initial phase of recommendations to the City
Manager. As noted earlier, it is important to note that not every element of this report was fully agreed upon
by every member of the task force. We have tried to make clear those areas where there were some elements
of disagreement, or where the task force felt it necessary to leave some room for the City Manager, the
Police Commissioner, and other appropriate City staff to exercise their discretion and best judgment. This
report, however, represents the best attempts of the Co-Chairs to synthesize the work of this task force into
a cohesive document that can be presented to the public, and that can ultimately be acted upon by the City
Manager.
The next step in this process includes reporting these recommendations – as well as discussion of
how these recommendations were arrived at – to the Cambridge community, and actively soliciting the
feedback of the public. This is a critical and necessary part of this process, and it must be understood that,
based upon the feedback from the Cambridge community, the recommendations contained in this report
may evolve. It is also important to note that, concurrent with (and parallel to) the work of the City Manager’s
appointed task force over these past several months, various members of the Cambridge community have
been engaged in similar discussions and re-imaginings of how the City should approach matters pertaining
to policing and public safety. Should recommendations from those independent efforts be presented to the
City Council, the task force Co-Chairs will work to ensure that these be given their

This report is now being formally submitted for the record to the City Council. Following this
submission, the next phase of work – presenting these recommendations to the public at large, and soliciting
the public’s feedback – must and shall commence, followed by the City Manager’s review and

Reports from the Task Force Sub-Groups
In April, after collaborating as a full Task Force since February, the Task Force split up into sub-groups of
two or three to commence formulating recommendations around each of the following areas: Mental Health,
Domestic Violence, Restorative Justice, Homelessness, Other Community Safety Options, and Community
Outreach. The subgroups met over a period of weeks and then reconvened to present their thoughts and
ideas to the larger group on May 4, 2021. The recommendations found in these reports represent the
recommendations of the members of the sub-groups only, not the full Task Force. The reports were
discussed and synthesized by the full Task Force and that process was a major component of the Task
Force’s work that led to the final recommendations and next steps presented in the main report.
The reports from the sub-groups are presented here in full:

MENTAL HEALTH
The goal of the subcommittee focused upon Mental Health issues was to deliver recommendations
that could begin to identify key areas to consider when setting up a program for non- police response to
mental health calls. The subcommittee did not reach consensus on what the new structure should look like,
with some members feeling that there needed to be more work to flush out details of such a service.
All members agreed that creating a new, non-police response is complex, as it involves other
systems, such as mental health support in the community, mental health infrastructure, community supports,
religious organizations, non-profits and fitting in the numerous services already being offered by the
Cambridge Police Department.
All members agreed that the information obtained during this Task Force from February to April
2021 was valuable and should be used to inform and shape next best steps to move from discussion to
design to action and implementation.
There were subcommittee members who were comfortable laying out a framework, based on the
information obtained during the Task Force process, their own research, and their own experience, to offer
the following outline of a service that should be considered:
•

Peer/professional model. Two people per call. One a “Peer Counselor” and one a social
worker/mental health professional

•

Calls would come into a new three-digit number, with the understanding that many calls will
continue to go through 911

•

Staff 911 with a social worker/licensed mental health professional to triage calls (Response to call
will depend on specifics of the situation)

•

This new “unit” will be housed outside of the police department, but work in conjunction with the
CPD Clinical Support Services Unit and other City Departments

•

Will not provide case management services

Attachment: Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force SIGNED - FINAL (COF 2021 #51 : Report for Future of Public Safety Task Force)

APPENDIX C

Packet Pg. 960

•

We understand that there will be times when police involvement may be necessary, but during
those times, all efforts should be made to have the non-police responders take the lead and for the
police only to be involved if the situation becomes unsafe

•

Will respond to the following types of calls:
o Suicide related calls
o Mental health related calls
o Welfare/wellness checks
o Conflicts with encampments
o Calls for unhoused members of the community
o Public Nuisance calls
o Transportation to services that don’t require an ambulance
o Death notifications

Policy recommendations would be: That the City Manager establish a new public safety unit that sits
outside of the Cambridge Police Department to address calls related to: Suicide, mental health crisis,
welfare/wellness checks, conflicts with encampments, emergency services for unhoused community
members, public nuisance calls and transportation to services that don’t require an ambulance. This unit
will work in conjunction with other city departments and services, as well as with non-profits in the
community. This unit will be staffed in a “peer/professional” model with enough staffing to allow no less
than 2 staff to go out on every call, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. In addition, social work/mental
health staff will be added to the 911 Emergency Response Unit to triage mental health calls to determine
the appropriate response.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
The subgroup looking at issues pertaining to domestic violence presented the following report to
the larger task force:

WHAT DOES THE NEW STRUCTURE LOOK LIKE?
In order to fully propose a new structure for responding to domestic violence calls outside of the
criminal justice system, a needs assessment should be conducted along with additional response policy
review, training, explore other follow up models, improve court process and additional awareness
campaigns on resources in the community. Additionally, after several meetings with key stakeholders in
the community, it has been determined that many of the current structures responding to DV are working
very well. Stakeholders requested that the DV Advocates at CPD be noted as key assets to the successful
responses to DV survivors across Cambridge. The many discussions included key areas of strength as well
as needs for change. All agreed that any changes should only be made after a comprehensive need
assessment is completed. As such, the subcommittee is recommending the following:
Assess DV Needs in Cambridge
The Domestic and Gender-Based Violence Prevention Initiative (DGBVPI) is currently working to
engage and mobilize Cambridge's communities, agencies, and City departments to change attitudes,
behaviors, policies, and practices to prevent and bring attention to domestic and gender-based violence. To
do this work, technical assistance is required to assist, develop and market a DV need assessment survey
and complete a report on recommendations to deliver enhanced services and unmet needs. This work would
also allow for the continued efforts of the Coordinator of the DGBVPI who has worked on creating a shared
understanding of Racial Justice in the context of Gender-Based Violence through public events, small group
discussions and day long workshops. As a next step in this work, the Coordinator seeks to work with groups
of providers and a consultant in launching a need assessment on the pathways

•

Create and implement widespread prevention education across the community.

WHAT SHOULD THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS BE, HOW WOULD THIS
NEW POLICY WORK?
•
•

•

Upon completion of a needs assessment, evaluate program needs, roles and positions to enhance
services for DV services outside of the criminal justice system and to improve processes within
criminal justice system.

work strategically to advance our mission to end domestic violence and strengthen our work
through an anti-racist lens. This role is focused on internally examining and transforming our
work to best meet the needs of survivors from all walks of life and externally on fostering
community relationships to learn, apply, and share transformative practices.
Review racial differences in DV arrest.
Review all police and dispatch policies.

Worker could discuss options/resources in real time to callers.
Enhanced resources to support 7X24 hotline at partner agencies.
Traditional partner agencies contact through existing or enhanced services.

RESTORATIVE JUSTICE
The subgroup focusing on Restorative Justice recommended the establishment of an Office of
Restorative Practices.
The Office of Restorative Practices of Cambridge, MA would exist in alliance with grassroots and
government sanctioned national, state, and regional entities for Restorative Justice. Its services would be
aligned with state expectations for access to services for residents of Massachusetts. It would employ a
Leader with a background in Restorative Justice Practice and training, as well as a variety of other means
of preventing violence and managing conflict. The Leader would have experience in large scale program
implementation and evaluation, and a background in mental health and universal Public Health strategies.

The Clerical staff would manage communications between the office and the city. The Clerical
staff would maintain a social media presence for the Department and manage referrals to the Office of
Restorative Practices, as well as other clerical and managerial duties.
The Assistant Department Leader (ADL) would be a practitioner of Transformative Justice and
would lead this work for the City on issues that call for this kind of response. The ADL would provide
direct supervision to the Practitioners. The ADL would coordinate and implements training for the
Practitioners and community outreach initiatives. The ADL would oversee the processing of referrals, and
follow up on Transformative and Restorative processes taking place in the community.
The 10 Practitioners would have experience in conflict mediation, Transformative Justice practices,
as well as Restorative Circle Practice. They would have specialties in the areas most needed by the office:
(2) mental health support, (2) housing services, (2) employment, (2) education, and (2) healthy food access
& nutrition education, as a way to foster lasting physical safety and generate community wellbeing. The
Practitioners would offer training in conflict management, community building, intervention and
workshops to residents. They would recruit and train volunteers to support Community Building Circles in
all of the neighborhoods.
The staff would be diverse. Residency in the City of Cambridge would be essential.

HOMELESSNESS
The subgroup focusing upon issues of how the City should respond to emergency calls and
situations pertaining to homelessness recommended the following items be taken up for further
consideration:
1. Create a non-police crisis response team as an alternative response when police are truly not
needed (i.e. non-life threatening and non-violent/criminal activities)
2. Establish a three digit non-911 number (i.e. the federal government’s forthcoming 988 mental
health crisis number) and train existing Emergency Communications Center staffers on triaging
calls
3. Substantially increase city grants and contracts to existing homelessness providers (i.e.
FirstStep, Bay Cove, Eliot PATH Program)
4. Encourage the formation of a 1+ year working group on public safety reform with an
emphasis on proactive citywide community engagement, including engaging those on the
frontlines of public health, public safety, and community organizing
5. Establish a citywide respite center and strongly advocate for alternative and innovative
policies at the state/federal levels, such as a safe injection facility

7.1.a

The Task Force on the Future of Public Safety working group assigned to explore “other
community safety options” that did not fit neatly into the other Task force working groups’ purviews has
met and prepared the following recommendations for the full Task Force’s consideration. Our
recommendations are broken into two sections, recommended categories of service that the new Department
of Community Safety should provide and have primary jurisdiction over in the city and key principles that
the city should follow when designing the new department, all based on examples and best practices we
have had the opportunity to study from across the country.

I. Recommended Services to be Provided by the new Cambridge Department of Community Safety:
We recommend that the new Cambridge Department of Community Safety have primary responsibility
over city services and all 911 calls related to the following:
Non-emergency medical services
Substance abuse incidents
Public nuisance complaints
Crisis counseling
Grief and loss counseling
Resource connections and community referrals
Transportation services to community resources
Death notices

●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

All of the above categories represent services currently provided by CAHOOTS in Salem, OR, and
the city should conduct further study into how the CAHOOTS staffs and operates those programs when
designing a pilot program for Cambridge.
II. Key Operating Principles to Incorporate into a new Department of Community Safety [DCS]:
Based on our research into other non-police community response programs across North
America, the Task Force recommends that the following best practices and lessons learned be
incorporated into the design of the new Department of Community Safety:
•

The new Cambridge Department of Community Safety should be a City department organized
outside of and entirely independent from the Cambridge Police Department, though the two
departments should have a close working relationship similar to the relationship that CPD shares
with the Cambridge Fire Department.

•

DCS should be fully integrated into Cambridge’s emergency response plans and be considered a
peer first-responder agency to CPD and CFD.

•

When fully operational, the new Department of Community Safety should have primary
jurisdiction over all categories of response calls that are currently handled by CPD which do not
involve violence or serious criminality.

•

While the new DCS should have primary jurisdiction over calls and services that have long
defaulted to CPD, the city should continue to invest in CPD training and resources that have
helped the department better work with the city’s vulnerable populations over the years. CPD
should maintain its co-response model, innovative training modalities, and Family and Social
Justice Section. There will always be a need for increased social justice training and diversion
opportunities within CPD.

OTHER COMMUNITY SAFETY OPTIONS

Packet Pg. 965

•

The new DCS should offer a 24/7 response for all categories of response calls. DCS should be
fully integrated into Cambridge’s 911 system alongside CPD, CFP, and EMS, and 911 operators
should be able to route calls to DCS for immediate response at all hours. DCS may offer
additional non-emergency response community Safety services during business hours.

•

DCS responders should be equipped to contact CPD or other city emergency services for Safety
on calls using existing emergency service communications networks.

•

The City Manager should commission a comprehensive community engagement process to solicit
community feedback on this Task Force’s proposal for a new DCS. This process should prioritize
voices from communities most impacted by inequities in the United States’ criminal justice
system and who will be most impacted by the creation of a new DCS. The City Manager should
use feedback from this process to refine this. proposal and to prioritize which services the new
DCS should offer to the public first.

•

In addition to community feedback, the City Manager should use the current volume of
emergency response requests and the current risk of poor outcomes as criteria when prioritizing
which categories of services to shift from CDP to the new DCS.

•

When possible, the new DCS should partner with local community organizations currently
providing services that could conceivably be of a type provided by DCS, support their work via
grants, and refer clients to them as appropriate in order to leverage and amplify work and
expertise that already exists in the community.

•

When possible, on calls where DCS might appropriately dispatch a trained responder who is also
a mandatory reporter to an incident in the community, the caller requesting the service should be
made aware that the responder will be a mandatory reporter and be offered an alternative
responder who is not a mandatory reporter. The new DCS should have the ability to dispatch
those other than mandatory reporters or to make referrals to community organizations who fall
outside mandatory reporting requirements but who have training to respond appropriately to the
callers’ needs.

•

The new DCS should be a uniformed service but those uniforms should be impossible to confuse
with police uniforms.

•

We recognize that police-based traffic enforcement in America has been historically unjust
towards marginalized communities and represents a danger to the public. We recommend that
Cambridge set a goal to move away from police-based traffic enforcement towards a non-police
model as soon as practicable, and that Cambridge consider the new DCS as a potential candidate
to conduct some or all traffic enforcement activities in the future. We recommend that the City
Manager watch closely efforts to build non-police traffic enforcement in Berkeley, CA and other
communities undertaking similar efforts for lessons that can be deployed in Cambridge, but that
the city prioritize shifting the service responsibilities outlined in this memo to DCS while
solutions to the traffic problem become clearer.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH
The subgroup focused upon developing recommendations for establishing a more effective, more
robust means of Community Outreach and Engagement brought forward the following governing principles
that must form the basis of any outreach efforts going forward - with the understanding that there will need
to be further discussions as to how to ensure that these principles will be implemented going forward.

7.1.a

Packet Pg. 966

7.1.a

Internally defining what is meant by “engagement”

The City/CPD must be clear, internally, with how it intends to connect with the community: who
is the target audience, what type of engagement is most likely to resonate with/reach that particular
audience, and how do we ensure that this is a sustained effort and not a “one and done” event?

•

Identify and Cultivate Community Ambassadors

The City needs to find trusted people within the different neighborhoods/communities it wishes to
reach and utilize them as ambassadors into the community. These ambassadors should ideally be given a
stipend for their work, and a full briefing of what the City is trying to achieve in their outreach so that they
will have a full understanding and feel invested in the outcome. These ambassadors can be members of the
Interfaith community, longtime neighborhood residents, those who have extensive relationships throughout
the community – it is a matter of finding the people already there and then establishing a working
relationship with them to distribute information into their spheres of influence. These ambassadors will also
be asked to continually ask their friends and neighbors: “Who else can we bring into this process, who else
should be here?”

•

Enticements to Attend Meetings

We need to recognize the barriers that prevent people from attending meetings and then work to
ease those. Enticements can come in the form of holding raffles for those who attend, or providing tickets
for fresh, free produce for attendees, or providing other tangible benefits to attendees. The hope and
expectation is that many may initially come to meetings for these incentives, but they will eventually build
relationships with their neighbors and City representatives and buy into the process.

•

Relationship Building/Showing the Community They Are Valued

Community members attending meetings can pick up on the social cues when the City is just going
through the motions to check off that a meeting has been held, or if a process is being rushed along due to
a deadline. The City must take pains to show attendees that their presence in community meetings is valued,
their feedback is valued, and that we are intent on building a sustained relationship with them. If the City
only reaches out when it wants information from people and then the City is not heard from again, that will
make it much harder to build any kind of long and trusting relationship between the City and the community
members.

•

Build in “Progressive Stacking” To Your Meetings

In community meetings, pains should be taken to call on the historically marginalized voices first,
to elevate them and demonstrate that their concerns are valued and being heard – only once they have
spoken should we then give the floor over to those that we more typically hear from.

•

Closing the Digital Divide

Especially in the age of Covid-19, we must be mindful of the digital divide that can make it more
difficult for those with older technology, poor Wifi, or tech literacy issues to fully join in. In some cases,
this may mean working with families to provide them with Wifi hotspots, in other cases it may mean helping
to pay for the Internet services, or helping them obtain loaned out laptops for meetings.

•

Emphasize Cultural Competency and Transparency

It is critical that any community engagement be conducted with cultural awareness and sensitivity.
We must be mindful of whom we send in as the messenger to the various neighborhoods, and

This process is now ready to be taken to the next step: soliciting feedback from the community,
followed by the formal presentation of the Task Force’s recommendations to the City Manager. Once
received, it will be up to the City Manager and the Police Commissioner, along with other appropriate City
staff, to determine how to actualize and operationalize these recommendations, how to budget for them,
and how to translate these ideas into reality.

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
At 4:00 PM on Friday, May 21st, I am speaking at the 2021 Science Research Mentoring Program
(SRMP) Annual Symposium, hosted by the MIT Museum and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics, where CRLS students will lead talks about their research projects and chat about their
experiences this year. Their talks range from climate modeling through meteoric analysis, all the way to
exoplanet characterization. Learn more about the SRMP program here.
On Saturday, May 22nd, we are hosting a special Mental Health Awareness Month event in partnership
with Down with Design from 12:00-2:00 PM at St. Peter’s Field, Danehy Park. This is an event for
current 8-12th graders with physical and creative ways to address mental health like yoga, sports, and
dance.
At the last Regular Meeting of the School Committee on Tuesday, May 18th, the Superintendent and his
team gave this presentation in response to item C21-139 on the agenda, a joint motion by Member
Weinstein, Member Rachel, and myself, in collaboration with student members Anaïs Killian and Nuriel
Vera-DeGraff, requesting that the Superintendent update the School Committee on the history and current
status of the implementation of the recommendations of the Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention
Action Plan Recommendations from April 2016, as well as any other district initiatives or plans currently
in place related to fighting misogyny, gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault
within CPSD.. We found that there is still a lot of work to be done.
In response to the Eversource’s commercial materials being circulating to CPS schools, I submitted
motion #21-148 with Member Weinstein and Member Fantini requesting that the Superintendent report
the current relevant procedures and supports for CPSD educators that address the CPSD policy that states,
in part, “No advertising of commercial products or services will be permitted in school buildings or on

school grounds or properties” as well as a report on current CPSD curriculum and school-based activities
around climate justice. In response to the second request, Dr. Salim provided us with this document in his
Weekly Update to the School Committee, outlining climate change-related content embedded in the
CPSD curriculum. The School Committee also received this letter from Eversource, communicating that
they will not be distributing any additional gas safety information this school year and will be reviewing
and adjusting materials going forward.
I’m excited to announce that I am working with the Superintendent and Cambridge Public Health
Department to hold CPS vaccine clinics at the CRLS Field House to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine for CPS and charter school students 12 years and older, on May 26th (first dose) and
June 16th (second dose). The vaccine is free and no identification is required. Students ages 12-17 will
need a consent form (also in Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish) to be signed but a parent/guardian does
not need to be present. For students ages 18 and older do not need a consent form. Registration is
available here.
Two other vaccine opportunities for CPS students:
• Saturday, May 22nd: 10:00 AM- 2:00 PM (first dose) and Sunday, June 13th: 10:00 AM-2:00
PM (second dose) at the Buckingham Browne& Nichols School at 50 Gerry’s Landing Rd. Some
parking will be available. Students younger than 18 must be accompanied by a parent/guardian to
give consent. Registration is here.

1. Since herd immunity is important to stop the spread and new variants are continuing to
arise, it is important that we continue the successful drive to get everyone possible
vaccinated. We are fortunate that due to concerted efforts our vaccination rates across
different ethnic and racial groups outpace the state. Essential workers and other works
who live elsewhere also deserve protection - once the vaccines are formally approved are
there any plans to encourage everyone to get vaccinated - not only people who live in
Cambridge but also those who work in Cambridge?
2. Once the emergency is lifted, what are the ways the city is constrained or not constrained
in being able to respond to the situation of signs that public health may be compromised?
