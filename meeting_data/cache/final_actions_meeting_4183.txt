WHEREAS:

In recent years, the City has worked to address a number of different, critical
issues that impact the wellbeing of our community and our planet via a number of
different policies and initiatives that are tied to the development of new
commercial and residential buildings; and

WHEREAS:

From increasing the linkage fees that developers must pay into the Affordable
Housing Trust Fund, to increasing the mandatory amount of inclusionary units in
new residential buildings of ten units or more, to our Net Zero policies, to the
proposed BEUDO amendments, to the Affordable Housing Overlay, to the
possibility of eliminating parking minimums, there have been a number of new or
refreshed initiatives enacted by the City over the past half decade; and

WHEREAS:

While each of these policies addresses a very real need, it would be prudent for
the City to take a moment to request that an analysis be conducted to determine
what impact, if any, all of these combined policies have had upon local
commercial and residential development, and what impact may yet be felt by
these combined policies in the near term, before the City looks to enact further
policies or initiatives related to development; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Community
Development Department to conduct an assessment and analysis of the impacts
of the combined, above-referenced policies upon local commercial and
residential development over the past half decade, and the anticipated impact of
these policies over the next half decade, and to report back to the City Council on
this matter in a timely manner.

Parking minimums

I'm writing today in support of removing mandatory parking minimums. For the last 10 years, I've rented an apartment
in Cambridge without a car and without a need to buy one. All of my jobs have been in Boston or Cambridge and served
well by our public transportation system. Lately I've been telecommuting.
Please don't ask my landlord to claim a parking spot for me, that's not what I want. I'd rather have more neighbors or a
larger apartment or pay less in rent.

ORDINANCE NO. 2022-5 - FINAL PUBLICATION
In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty-two
AN ORDINANCE

That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge be amended by substitution as follows:
Amend Article 6.000 to read as follows
ARTICLE 6.000 OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS AND NIGHTTIME CURFEW ON
LARGE COMMERCIAL THROUGH TRUCKS
6.10 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY OF PARKING, BICYCLE PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
6.11 Intent. It is the intent of this Article 6.000 to reduce traffic congestion, noise, vibrations, fumes and safety
hazards caused by large commercial trucks, thereby promoting the safety, health and welfare of the
public, by establishing requirements for off street parking, bicycle parking and loading and restrictions on
the use of City street during the night-time by large commercial trucks with points of origin and
destinations outside the City of Cambridge in order to implement the purposed of the The Zoning Act,
Section 2A of Chapter 808, and Article 1.000. Section 1.30 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance,
including:
•

to lessen congestion in the streets;

•

to conserve health;

•

to conserve the value of land and buildings;

•

to prevent pollution of the environment;

•

to protect residential neighborhoods from incompatible activities; and

•

to preserve and increase the amenities of the city.
The regulations for parking, bicycle parking and loading spaces herein vary according to type, location
and intensity of development in the different zoning districts, and to proximity of public transit facilities.
This Article 6.000 allows development to provide adequate parking facilities to meet the reasonable
needs of all building and land users without establishing regulations which unnecessarily encourage
automobile usage. The parking and bicycle parking standards contained herein are intended to
encourage public transit, bicycle usage and walking in lieu of automobiles where a choice of travel mode

Packet Pg. 53

1

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

exists. It is also the purpose of this Article to allow flexibility in providing parking through shared or off site
arrangements in order to accommodate the automobile in the urban environment in a less disruptive
way. Development regulations and design standards have been established to reduce hazard to
pedestrians on public sidewalks, to ensure the usefulness of parking, bicycle parking and loading
facilities, and where appropriate, to avoid potential adverse impacts on adjacent land uses, and to
enhance the visual quality of the city.
6.12 Applicability. The off street parking and loading provisions of this Article 6.000 shall apply as follows:
(a) For new structures erected and new uses of land established or authorized after the effective date of
this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto, as well as for external additions of Gross Floor Area to
existing structures for any use, accessory off street parking and loading facilities shall comply with the
regulations for the districts in which such structures or uses are located.
In the case of an addition of Gross Floor Area to an existing structure (lawfully erected prior to the
effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto), which addition contains nonresidential
uses, loading facilities shall only be required when the total of such additions occurring from the
effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto increases the Gross Floor Area of the
existing structure by fifteen (15) percent or more and shall be provided for the total increase in
intensity subsequent to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto.
(b) When the intensity of an existing use within any existing structure (or lot in the case of 6.36.7 l and m
and 6.36.8 f and g) is increased through addition of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity or
other units of measurement specified in Section 6.30 or Section 6.60 (but not including any uses in a
new external addition to that structure, which shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (a)
above), loading facilities shall be provided as required for such increase in intensity of use and
accessory off-street parking may be provided if it conforms to the regulations for the use and district.
However, a nonresidential use lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or
any amendment thereto shall not be required to provide loading facilities for such increase unless and
until the aggregate increase in units of measure shall equal fifteen (15) percent or more of the units of
measurement existing upon said effective date. If such an increase occurs, additional loading facilities
as required herein shall be provided for the total increase in intensity subsequent to the effective date
of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto.
(c) When the use of an existing structure (but not including the use of a new external addition to that
structure, which shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (a) above) is changed to a new
nonresidential use, compliance with the schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36 and the
schedule of loading requirements in Subsection 6.60 shall be required. Any maximum requirements
specified in Subsection 6.36, as well as minimum requirements, shall be applicable to such changes
in use.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

However, if said structure was lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any
amendment thereto, additional loading facilities shall be required only to the extent that the required
amount for the new nonresidential use would exceed the amount required for the previous use if said
previous use were subject to the schedule of parking and loading requirements.
(d) When the nonresidential use of an existing structure is changed to a residential use, off street parking
facilities shall conform to the schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36. Any maximum
requirements specified in Subsection 6.36, as well as minimum requirements, shall be applicable to
such changes in use.
(e) Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided according to the requirements set forth in Section
6.100. Wherever the term "parking" is used in this Zoning Ordinance without specific reference to
bicycles, such term shall refer to parking for motor vehicles and not bicycles.
However, if said structure was lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any
amendment thereto and the nonresidential use of the structure is proposed to be changed to an
Affordable Housing Project as herein defined, additional off street parking facilities shall be required
as provided above, except that for that portion of the Project consisting of Affordable Units additional
off street parking shall be provided at the rate of 60% of the parking otherwise required in Section
6.36.
For purposes of this Section 6.12 (d) an Affordable Housing Project shall be a residential
development in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling units are considered Affordable Units
for occupancy by Eligible Households as defined in Section 11.200 of the Zoning Ordinance.
6.13 Scope of Off Street Parking Regulations. All accessory parking facilities shall conform to all regulations set
forth in this Article governing the use, design and operation of such facilities. However, the provisions of
this Article 6.000, notwithstanding, any special parking requirements for townhouse developments
specified in Section 11.10, for planned unit developments specified in Article 13.000, for projects in the
Mixed Use Development District specified in Article 14.000 or for special permits specified elsewhere in
this Ordinance shall be applicable for those projects, except that the minimum accessory off-street
parking required for all uses in those instances shall be zero (0) parking spaces.
6.14 Restoration. When an existing structure or use is restored and resumes operation after being destroyed or
damaged by fire, explosion, or other catastrophe, bicycle parking and loading facilities shall be provided
at least equivalent to that in existence at the time of such destruction or damage. If the extent of such
damage is such that the cost of restoration is fifty (50) percent or more of the replacement value of the
structure or use, bicycle parking and loading facilities meeting the requirements of this Article 6.000 shall
be provided. However, in no case shall it be necessary to replace or continue any bicycle parking or
loading facilities which were in excess of those required by the requirements for equivalent amounts of
new uses or construction.

hereafter be reduced below - of if already less than, shall not be further reduced below - the minimum
requirements under the provisions of this Article 6.000. Accessory off street parking facilities in existence
as of March 15, 1961 shall only be required if such facilities have been used to satisfy parking
requirements after March 15, 1961.
6.16 Dedicated Off Street Parking Facilities. Off street parking facilities, provided in accordance with these
regulations, which after development are later dedicated to and accepted by the City and maintained by
the City for off street parking purposes, shall be deemed to continue to serve the structures or uses for
which they were originally provided.
6.17 Compatibility with the E.P.A. Clean Air Regulations. In addition to the regulations contained in this Article, all
off street parking facilities must comply with restrictions contained in the Transportation Control Plan for

by users without any assistance or supervision by company personnel.
(e) All owners of that portion of a lot accommodating the operation or parking of a Carsharing Vehicle, or

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

(f) Parking spaces devoted to Carsharing Vehicles shall be registered with the Traffic, Parking and
Transportation Department (TPTD), which shall keep a recorded of the address, location, number of
spaces, property ownership, and Carsharing Organization if applicable, and certify that such spaces
may accommodate the operation of Carsharing Vehicles in accordance with all applicable laws, rules,
or regulations. If any such spaces are relocated within a facility, or if the property ownership or
Carsharing Organization is changed, then the registration with TPTD shall be updated accordingly
within one month. TPTD may promulgate more detailed regulations pertaining to the safe operation
as to which parking spaces on a lot are best suited to Carsharing Vehicles operations.
(g) Prior to assigning parking spaces for use by Carsharing Vehicles, the Carsharing Organization shall
send a written notification to all residential dwellings within one hundred (100) feet of the facility in
which the spaces are located, including any access and egress drives. Notifications shall be sent to
individual dwelling units or to a residential building manager if applicable, to distributed to residents.
The notification shall, at a minimum, provide contact information for the Carsharing Organization so
that residents may ask questions or report concerns related to the operation of the Carsharing
Vehicles. A copy of notification and a list of the addresses to which it was sent shall be provided to
TPTD upon register the parking spaces.
6.25.4 Principal Use Parking Provisions:
(a) Within principal use parking facilities established under the provisions of Section 4.32(b) (Automobile
Parking Lot for Private Passenger Car) or Commercial Parking Facilities registered with the
Department of Traffic, Parking and Transportation per the provisions of Chapter 10.16 of the
Cambridge Municipal Code, there shall be no limitations on the number of Carsharing Vehicles that
may be maintained for active use at the facility.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the maintenance of Carsharing Vehicles
for active use within a principal use or commercial parking facility in accordance with this Section 6.24
shall not cause any change in the use designation of that facility or affect any other regulation that
may be applicable to that facility.
6.24.4 Accessory Parking Provisions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the maintenance of Carsharing Vehicles
within an accessory parking facility in accordance with this Section 6.24 shall not cause any change
in the use of that facility nor any violation of the accessory parking requirements applicable to the
principal uses served by that facility, provided that such Carsharing Vehicles are available for use by
any occupant of the principal use that is otherwise qualified to operate a motor vehicle. Where a
Carsharing Vehicle is owned or operated by a Carsharing Organization, ordinary fees and other terms
of service may apply.
6.24.5 Allowed Modifications.
(a) Grandfathering. Parking spaces that were lawfully used by Carsharing Vehicles as of the date of the

6.31.1 The schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36 specifies the unit of measure regulating the
provision of parking spaces. Square footage requirements are geared to gross floor area. Each unit of
measure, however, shall specifically not apply to any Gross Floor Area devoted to parking facilities, which
shall not require the provision of any accessory parking.
6.31.2 In general the schedule in Subsection 6.36 specifies a maximum amount of parking [Example: for a general
office use (6.36.4 d) in a Business C district, the maximum is one space per 400 square feet of gross floor
area.] Where there are two such listings the first is the minimum requirement and the second is the
maximum limitation. Relief from the parking requirements may be obtained only after the grant of a special
permit as provided in Section 6.35 below. With the grant of a special permit the maximum parking limitation
may be exceeded provided, however, that the provisions with regard to gross floor area as set forth in
Section 6.31.3 are met.
6.31.3 Any parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum requirements specified in Section 6.36 shall be
counted in determining Gross Floor Area. In such cases a proportional share of the entire parking facility
(not only the area of the spaces) shall be credited toward Gross Floor Area. The area counted as Gross
Floor Area shall be determined by multiplying the total area of the parking facility by the percentage that
the proposed number of spaces exceeds the maximum allowed number of spaces.
6.31.4 For uses not listed in Subsection 6.36, the Board of Zoning Appeal shall determine the required amount of
parking if it issues a use variance for such use.
6.31.5 All commercial uses shall also be required to provide a parking space for each commercial vehicle
customarily used in conjunction with the operation of such use at such location.
6.32Parking Exemptions.
6.32.1 Small Business. The minimum amount of parking required by Subsection 6.36 Schedule of Parking and
Loading Requirements shall be waived for any nonresidential use in an office, business, or industrial district
if such use would require four (4) or fewer spaces, and such nonresidential use is located in a building or
row of attached buildings which contains a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less of gross floor
area devoted to nonresidential use. Furthermore, for a new nonresidential use within a building in existence
on or before October 19, 2020, no new accessory parking shall be required.
6.32.2 Institutions. Where an institution provides dormitory, fraternity, faculty, employee or other residence
accommodations, the number of parking spaces provided as a result thereof may be deducted from the
requirements established to satisfy the needs of classrooms, libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, similar
educational areas or dining facilities normally used by such residential occupants. In order to qualify for
such deduction, the institutional applicant shall submit to the Building Department the institution's current
residential parking plan clearly indicating the location of all existing and proposed residential parking
facilities available at the institution.
6.33 Computation. Where a building or lot is used by two or more activities that fall into different classes of use in
Subsection 6.36, the off street parking requirements shall be the sum of the requirements for each individual

Packet Pg. 61

1

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

use. Parking spaces for accessory uses shall be determined in the same manner as for principal use. Where
the computation results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one.
Where the computation of parking requirements for a building with more than one class of use results in
multiple fractional numbers, such fractions shall be carried to the final sum.
6.34 Parking Space Size Allocation. In all parking facilities containing five or more spaces, a combination of regular
and compact spaces may be provided; however, no more than fifty (50) percent of the provided spaces
shall be designed for compact cars (as specified in Subsection 6.42). All off street parking facilities shall
contain spaces designed for handicapped access. The number of such spaces shall be determined by the
requirements of the currently applicable "Rules and Regulations of the Architectural Barriers Board of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts."
6.35 Relief from Parking Requirements. Any required amount of parking may be reduced by issuance of a special
permit from Board of Zoning Appeals, as provided below. However, handicapped parking required by
Subsection 6.34, and commercial vehicle parking required by Subsection 6.31.5 shall not be reduced from
the original requirement. Bicycle parking requirements may not be modified pursuant to this Section 6.35,
and may be modified only as allowed in Section 6.100. The parking maximum limitation may be exceeded
only with the grant of a special permit from the Planning Board, as provided below, subject to the provisions
with regard to Gross Floor Area as provided in Section 6.31.3.
6.35.1 Reduction of Required Parking. Any minimum required amount of parking may be reduced only upon
issuance of a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals. A special permit shall be granted only if
the Board determines and cites evidence in its decision that the lesser amount of parking will not cause
excessive congestion, endanger public safety, substantially reduce parking availability for other uses or
otherwise adversely impact the neighborhood, or that such lesser amount of parking will provide positive
environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot and the neighborhood, including specifically, among
other benefits, assisting in the provision of affordable housing units. In making such a determination the
Board shall also consider whether or not less off street parking is reasonable in light of the following:
(1) The availability of surplus off street parking in the vicinity of the use being served and/or the proximity
of an MBTA transit station.
(2) The availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of the use being served
provided the requirements of Section 6.23 are satisfied.
(3) Shared use of off street parking spaces serving other uses having peak user demands at different
times, provided that no more than seventy-five (75) percent of the lesser minimum parking
requirements for each use shall be satisfied with such shared spaces and that the requirements of
Subsection 6.23 are satisfied.
(4) Age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level of auto usage; and

Packet Pg. 62

1

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

(5) Impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the affected lot or the adjacent lots
including reduction in green space, destruction of significant existing trees and other vegetation,
destruction of existing dwelling units, significant negative impact on the historic resources on the lot,
impairment of the urban design objectives of the city as set forth in Section 19.30 of the Zoning
Ordinance, or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways.
(6) The provision of required parking for developments containing affordable housing units, and
especially for developments employing the increased FAR and Dwelling unit density provisions of
Section 11.200, will increase the cost of the development, will require variance relief from other
zoning requirements applicable to the development because of limitations of space on the lot, or will
significantly diminish the environmental quality for all residents of the development.
For a project seeking a reduction in required off-street parking for residential uses, a Parking Analysis
shall be required as part of the Special Permit Application as set forth in Section 6.35.3.
6.35.2 Exceeding Maximum Allowed Parking. Any maximum allowed amount of parking may be exceeded only
upon issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board. Any parking area in excess of the maximum
limitation will have an impact on calculation of gross floor area as provided at Section 6.31.3. The Planning
Board shall grant a special permit to allow exceedance of a maximum limitation only upon making the
following determinations:
(1) Reasonable parking and transportation demand management measures are being implemented to
reduce the need for the additional off street parking;
(2) The additional spaces reflect parking demand that exceeds that which is common for this use as
categorized in Section 6.36, owing to unique characteristics of the users or the activity that result in a
high level of automobile parking demand;
(3) The additional parking demand cannot reasonably be accommodated through contract or other
arrangement making use of available off-site parking;
(4) The additional parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot, to
the neighborhood and the City which outweigh adverse effects, after consideration of the following:
congestion, traffic increases on residential streets, danger to public safety or deterioration of travel
conditions for pedestrians, cyclists or users of public transit.
In its decision the Planning Board shall cite evidence supporting its determinations, and may impose
such conditions as are necessary to mitigate all negative impacts on the neighborhood and the
environment which would otherwise result from the greater allowed amount of parking.
6.35.3 Parking Analysis.
6.35.31 The purpose of a Parking Analysis is to provide quantitative data to assist a special permit granting authority
in considering certain projects. A Parking Analysis shall be submitted where it is specifically required by

Packet Pg. 63

1

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

any provision of this Zoning Ordinance. A special permit granting authority may also request that elements
of a Parking Analysis be provided when considering a project that proposes a deviation from parking
requirements specified in the Zoning Ordinance or an increase in development density above the maximum
allowed as-of-right under base zoning regulations.
6.35.32 Where a Parking Analysis is specifically required by any provision of this Zoning Ordinance, the proponent
shall first consult with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department to determine the scope and
methodology of such an analysis. The results of the Parking Analysis shall be included in any Special Permit
Application for the project.
6.35.33 For residential projects, a Parking Analysis shall include some or all of the following, with the specific type
and level of analysis to be determined by the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department based on the
relevant characteristics of the proposal:
(a) Estimates of the project's parking demand, as evidenced by vehicle ownership rates and peak
parking occupancy data for comparable nearby residential projects, resident parking permit and motor
vehicle registration data for the area, and/or other indicators of parking demand. These estimates
should account for daytime and nighttime parking. Estimates may account for differences in parking
demand given the occupancy of units, such as owner-occupied vs. rental units, market-rate vs.
below-market-rate units, or elderly-oriented vs. conventional units. Estimates may also account for
anticipated vacancy rates.
(b) Maps showing the distance to alternate transportation options in the area, including MBTA rapid
transit stations and bus routes, bike facilities, and car-sharing services.
(c) Studies of on-street parking capacity and utilization in the vicinity of the project. Such studies should
be conducted at night, and should account for the normal activity hours of other land uses in the area.
(d) Where applicable, inventories and peak occupancy data for nearby off-site parking that will be
available to the project's residents or visitors, either on a round-the-clock basis or by way of a shared
use arrangement. Private, off-site parking shall only be applicable to the analysis if a long-term
leasing arrangement is proposed to be made. Shared parking arrangements should be studied
thoroughly to determine the minimum amount of parking required to satisfy the demand from all
proposed land uses during any given time period.
(e) A description of measures that will be implemented to reduce demand for private automobile use,
such as the availability of car-sharing programs and/or incentives for residents or employees to walk,
bicycle, or use public transportation, and estimates of the anticipated impact of those measures on
parking demand.
6.36 Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements. Off street parking shall be provided as shown in the
following table. Where one entry is given in the table, it is the maximum requirement. All square foot
measurements refer to gross floor area unless specified otherwise. The abbreviation "d.u." means
dwelling unit. The abbreviation n/a means not applicable. In cases where a requirement is expressed in

Packet Pg. 64

number of seats, twenty (20) square feet of public floor area shall equal one seat if there are no fixed
seats. One column of the table contains the loading requirement standard applicable under Section 6.80
for each use and two columns refer to the Long-Term Bicycle Parking and Short-Term Bicycle Parking
requirements applicable under Section 6.107 for each use.

ORDINANCE NO. 2022-17 (AS AMENDED)
In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty-two
AN ORDINANCE

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE That the
Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is hereby amended by adding a
chapter, to be numbered Chapter 6.24, which said Chapter reads as follows:
Chapter 6.24 Sale of Fur Apparel Products.
6.24.010 – Council Findings
(a) The City Council finds that animals that are slaughtered for their fur endure
tremendous suffering. Animals raised on fur farms typically spend their entire lives in
cramped and filthy cages. Fur farmers typically use the cheapest killing methods available,
including suffocation, electrocution, gas and poison.
(b) The City Council finds that fur farms are reservoirs and transmission vectors for
dangerous zoonotic diseases, including SARS coronaviruses, that threaten public health,
including in the City of Cambridge. COVID-19 infections have been confirmed at fur farms
in Europe and the United States, and scientific studies have linked mink, raccoon dogs, and
foxes – the animals most commonly farmed for their fur – to a variety of coronaviruses.
(c) The City Council finds that the fur production process is energy intensive and has a
significant environmental impact, including air and water pollution. Runoff from the fur
production process contains high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen, which are the
most common forms of water pollution in the United States. In addition, the tanning and
dying processes used in fur production use toxic chemicals and heavy metals like chromium
and formaldehyde.
(d) Considering the wide array of alternatives for fashion and apparel, the City Council
finds that the demand for fur products does not justify the unnecessary killing and cruel
treatment of animals, harm to the environment, and the public health risks to the people of
the City of Cambridge caused by these practices.
(e) The City Council believes that eliminating the sale of fur products in the City of
Cambridge will decrease demand for these cruel and environmentally harmful products and
promote community awareness of animal welfare and, in turn, will foster a more humane
environment in the City of Cambridge and enhance the reputation of the City.
6.24.020 - Definitions
The following definitions shall apply in this section:

Packet Pg. 78

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

1

(a) Fur shall mean any animal skin or part thereof with hair, fleece, or fur fibers
attached thereto, either in its raw or processed state.
(b) Fur product shall mean any article of clothing or covering for any part of the body, or
any fashion accessory, including but not limited to handbags, shoes, slippers, hats,
earmuffs, scarves, shawls, gloves, jewelry, keychains, toys or trinkets, and home accessories
and décor, that is made in whole or part of fur. “Fur product” does not include any of the
following:

(2) Cowhide with the hair attached thereto;
(3) Deerskin with the hair attached thereto;
(4) Lambskin or sheepskin with the fleece attached thereto; or
(5) The pelt or skin of any animal that is preserved through taxidermy or for the

(c) Non-profit organization shall mean any corporation that is organized under 26 U.S.C.
Section 501(c)(3) that is created for charitable, religious, philanthropic, educational or
similar purposes.
(d) Taxidermy shall mean the practice of preparing and preserving the skin of an animal
that is deceased and stuffing and mounting it in lifelike form.
(e) Ultimate consumer shall mean an individual who buys a fur product for their own use,
or for the use of another, but not for resale or trade.
(f) Used fur product shall mean a fur product that has been worn or used by an ultimate
consumer.
6.24.030 – Prohibition
No person shall sell, offer for sale, display for sale, trade, or otherwise distribute for
monetary or nonmonetary consideration a fur product within the City of Cambridge. For
purposes of this section, the sale of a fur product shall be deemed to occur in the City of
Cambridge if:
(1) The buyer takes physical possession of the fur product in the city; or
(2) The seller is located in the city.
6.24.040 - Exemptions
This Chapter shall not apply to the sale, offer for sale, displaying for sale, trade, or
distribution of:

Packet Pg. 79

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 24, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

(1) An animal skin or part thereof that is to be converted into leather, or which in
processing will have the hair, fleece, or fur fiber completely removed;

1

(1) A used fur product by an individual (excluding a retail transaction), non-profit
organization, or second-hand store, including a pawn shop;
(2) A fur product required for use in the practice of a religion;
(3) A fur product used for traditional tribal, cultural, or spiritual purposes by a
member of a federally recognized Native American tribe; or

6.24.050 – Penalty
Any person who violates this Chapter shall be subject to a fine not exceeding three hundred
dollars. As an alternative penalty, any person who violates this Chapter may be penalized
by a noncriminal disposition as provided in General Laws Chapter 40, Section 21D. Each
act of violation and every day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a
separate offense. Each fur product involved in a violation of this Chapter shall constitute a
separate act of violation. The Director of the Animal Commission, Animal Control Officers,
Police Officers and Sanitation Inspectors and Code Enforcement Inspectors detailed with
the Public Health and Inspectional Services Departments shall have the authority of
enforcing all sections of this chapter. All fines and penalties assessed and collected under
this chapter may be enforced by issuance of non-criminal tickets pursuant to G.L. c. 40, §
21D, or as otherwise authorized by law.
6.24.060 – Severability of Sections
It is declared to be the intention of the City Council that the sections, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses and words of this Chapter are severable and if any word, clause,
sentence, paragraph or section of this Chapter shall be declared unconstitutional or invalid
by the judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality
or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs
and sections of this Chapter since the same would have been enacted by the city council
without the incorporation in this code of any such unconstitutional or invalid word, clause,
sentence, paragraph or section.
6.24.070 – Effective Date
This ordinance shall take effect on January 1, 2023.
Passed to a second reading as amended at the
City Council meeting held on October 3, 2022 and
on or after October 24, 2022 the question comes on
passage to be ordained.

To: City Council <CityCouncil@CambridgeMA.GOV>; Clerk <clerk@cambridgema.gov>
Subject: Lee Farris: comments supporting lab regulation zoning petition
[Please include these comments in the public record.]
Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am one of the many signers of the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning petition.
This petition comes from over 250 people who are very concerned about lab expansion into the squares, and who don’t
think the conversation about what to do should be put off for another 6 months. The law gives residents the right to
submit a zoning petition at any time, and we are thoughtfully exercising this right. Over 250 signers is one of the largest
zoning efforts in recent memory. Signers include residents of below‐market housing, market tenants, homeowners,
local businesses owners, and people from many different neighborhoods and groups.
The petition would prohibit new biotech lab construction in Cambridge's neighborhoods and squares, including Central,
Harvard, Porter, Inman, Cambridge Street, River Street, Concord Ave., Broadway, and more. Labs would continue to be
allowed in the Kendall Sq. area, the eastern part of Cambridgeport, and some parts of Alewife. The Alewife Overlay
Development Moratorium prohibits new lab development in Alewife Overlay Districts 1‐5 until December 31,
2023. Future zoning in that area will be decided by a separate process that is already underway.
The petition proposes three zoning changes. It:
1. Defines the lab use, finally distinguishing it from other commercial uses. Similar but non‐threatening uses like
dentist offices and academic research buildings are explicitly carved out.
2. Restricts new instances of lab use in vulnerable squares and zoned business districts.
3. Completely grandfathers all existing instances of the lab use within newly restricted areas.

I have seen estimates that lab development is around 3 times as profitable as market housing. Retail is also much less
profitable than labs.
I live near Central Sq. and am very concerned that lab development projects would crowd out housing and small retail. I
remember during the hearings on re‐zoning Central Sq. for the Mass and Main project, the developer said the only
alternative to the proposed housing would be a lab building. I supported re‐zoning Central Sq. to try to encourage more
housing. If labs are allowed, it will be harder to get housing.

When I asked residents to sign the petition, I found many residents were upset to learn that biotech labs were allowed
in some of these places.
I look forward to talking with councilors and city staff about where labs should and should not be allowed in our city.
Thanks for your consideration,

Subject: Re: Cambridge Traffic/Bike Lanes/Garden St Re‐Alignment
Dear City Council:
I am a resident of Linnaean St and agree with Larry Cetrulo about the congestion on all of the residential streets now
that Garden St has been made one way. Here are my concerns:
1—While walking today on Holly Street I agree that it is no longer safe to even step off the sidewalk. It used to be a
street for walkers, residents and a few bikes. Now only cars
2—While crossing garden street on my walk, I have been nearly hit by bicyclists. I have not felt unsafe from cars because
they stop at crosswalks for the most part. On the other hand bicycles rarely stop for pedestrians and it is all the more
dangerous because they ride right next to the curb. Cars do not!
3‐‐I do not mean to privilege cars, but drivers tend to be more careful than scooters or bicyclists.
I choose to privilege people who walk to get around Cambridge, and you have not in any way taken us into account in
your decision making.
Please think of the large part of the population you serve and rescind this poorly taken decision.
Respectfully,

Hello,
Thanks to all of the great work the city has been doing recently on bike lane installation, and I'm excited for the new
work being planned on Hampshire St, which I commute through daily.
I've recently learned that the Brattle St. project is expected to be delayed due to issues delivering materials. While this
delay is unfortunate, I encourage the city to move ahead with street marking and installing temporary safety barriers in
the meantime. Especially with the days getting shorter, even these temporary measures could make a huge difference
for the safety of residents.
Best,

I am writing to recommend two Cambridge residents, Keisha Greaves and Robert Goss, for appointment
to the advisory board of the Cambridge Commission for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), each for a
three year term.
A summary of the process used to fill these two appointments is described below. While this recruitment
process pre-dates the guidelines outlined in City Manager’s Agenda Item #207 of October 24, 2022, the
CCPD staff implemented a comprehensive recruitment process that has resulted in two strong candidates.
Because the board has canceled two of its monthly meetings since the beginning of the year due to lack of
quorum, it is important that we fill these vacancies as soon as possible. There is one additional vacancy
on the board, and it is our intention to fill that position using the guidelines outlined in CMA 2022 #207.
About the Cambridge Commission for Persons with Disabilities
The Cambridge Commission for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) was established under Ch. 2.96 of the
Cambridge Municipal Code. The eleven (11) member board consists of: one representative from the
Department of Public Works, one representative from the Department of Human Service Programs, at
least five people with disabilities, and up to four individuals who are family members, friends, or
otherwise connected to people with disabilities.
The two positions being filled on the board were previously held by people with disabilities. The two
candidates recommended to these positions self-identify as people with disabilities.

Description of Outreach
The City Manager’s office posted a request for applications for the CCPD board on the city web site and
via a news release on February 24, 2022, with a closing date of March 28, 2022. During that time CCPD
sent the notice out to its electronic newsletter recipients (about 1,000 e-mail addresses), contacted the
Council on Aging and the DHSP Inclusion Services Program for possible candidates and reached out to
anyone who had inquired about board openings since the last application period in 2019. They also
utilized the city’s social media to recruit applicants.
Summary of Applications, Screening and Interview Process
Six individuals applied for these positions. One applicant provided no supporting materials and did not
respond to attempts to contact them. An interview team consisting of CCPD staff and three members of
the board conducted virtual interviews with each of the remaining five candidates. All applicants
identified as people with disabilities. The team agreed on two candidates to recommend for appointment.
As noted above, a third vacancy has opened on the board. A process will begin shortly to recruit
candidates to fill that vacancy.

I am herby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $600,000 from Free Cash to the Public
Investment Fund Human Service Programs Extraordinary Expenditures account, to support softball field
improvements at Danehy Park.
The funds are required to improve the field conditions in time for the 2023 spring softball season. The
improvements will include, but are not necessarily limited to: painted fence posts and new fence fabric,
backstop and team area windscreens, replacing the Field 1 infield, regrading infield lips and depressions,
new team benches, new bleachers and trash receptacles.
In June of 2022, Cambridge Recreation met with representation from Girls Youth Softball to walk though
Danehy Park, the primary home of Girls Youth Softball, to review facilities and playing conditions. This
inspired a series of additional conversations to collect recommendations to improve softball fields in
Cambridge. On September 7th the recommendations were reviewed by a focus group that will continue to
support the needs and interests of Girls Youth Softball moving forward. The group consists of current and
former players, coaches, Girls Youth Sports leadership and City Staff.
Cambridge Recreation and Department of Public Works (DPW) staff categorized the recommendations
into short-term and longer-term projects. This appropriation will address improvements that can be made
in time for the 2023 spring softball season. Cambridge Recreation staff will continue to work with the
Board of Girls Youth Softball to review the recommendations that would require more structural fixes
and take longer to implement. That work will include continued conversations with Girls Youth Softball
about the use of softball fields in other neighborhoods.

Brattle St. Bike Lanes - Overcoming the Delay & Temporary Protected Lanes

Hello!
I first want to say thank you for implementing the Garden St. lanes, and for the upcoming protected bike lanes on River
St. and Hampshire St.. They will be invaluable for the safety of our Boston and Cambridge bikers.
However, I am disappointed to hear of the delays on the Brattle St. bike lanes. Having a multiple-month delay to people
riding bikes on this stretch will be hugely damaging and dangerous to those who regularly commute on Brattle St.
Myself and many other bikes ask that the city proceed with the project as immediately as possible, using temporary
barriers until the permanent concrete barriers can be installed. In fact, the use of temporary traffic control devices is
acceptable within the historic district with no further approval needed. So there is no reason to delay this safety
measure further.
Thank you,
Adriana Messina

Garden St one way

I share the views of my neighbors who are extremely disappointed in your decision to allow Garden St to
be converted to one-way despite our petition appealing the Traffic Director’s decision. According to
the law, all work should be suspended until the Traffic Board hears our appeal and reaches a
decision. It is unclear how the city could reach the decision to proceed in clear violation of its own
laws.
As someone who drives west on Garden Street on a daily basis, I will find the one-way plan to be
disruptive; it will also mean that to take alternative routes I will spend an extra ten minutes a day with
my car idling in traffic on Mass Ave or Concord/Huron Aves. If we are trying to reduce vehicle
emissions, that doesn’t sound like a great plan.

Dear City Manager,
We can only regard your your decision to allow Garden St. to be converted to one-way despite our petition appealing the
Traffic Director’s decision as a serious problem on two fronts.
According to the law, all work should be suspended until the Traffic Board hears our appeal and reaches a decision, so it is
unclear how the city could reach the decision to proceed in clear violation of its own laws.
So not only do we now see a real change for the worse in the traffic in our street, but our faith in the integrity of a system
that is meant to allow for the input of residents and taxpayers has suffered a serious blow.
We write this not only as local residents, but as keen cyclists who see absolutely no benefit to the change.
All those who have previously walked, cycled and accompanied young children and elderly relatives up and down the side
streets of Garden will now lose out on doing those activities with any sense of safety.

Hi there,
I wanted to say thanks for the new protected bike lanes on Garden Street, and for the upcoming lanes on River St. and Hampshire St. I use
my bike to get around Cambridge and I appreciate the Council's support for these lanes and the hard work of everyone on staff to make
them happen.
I have heard that the Brattle St. protected lanes will be delayed until the spring. A delay of 6 months significantly increases the risk of
preventable injuries, especially with the impending winter and shorter daytime hours. I ask that the city proceed with the project
immediately using temporary barriers until the concrete barriers can be installed. I know that temporary traffic control devices are
acceptable within the historic district with no further approval needed.
Thank so much,

Great letter, Marie!
Let's hope common sense prevails and that particular Councilor be prevented from participating in any discussions
based on her prior behavior and obvious bias on this matter. As is obvious to anyone living in this City, East Cambridge
has been subjected to the intrusion of more developers in our neighborhood than has any other area in the City, and
preservation of its character is essential.

Dear Council Members and City Manager:

As many of you know, I am fourth generation Cambridge resident. My family has paid

say this to emphasize my breath of interest in preservation of our history, whether it be our

Kendall, I rallied some neighbors to study the possibility of establishing a Conservation District
in East Cambridge. We were not a group of old white privileged wealthy people. We were a
group of serious-minded residents who were truly motivated by an appreciation of the value in
our history and architecture. We met almost weekly for about 9 months in the St. Francis of
Assisi Church Hall, a notable Landmark itself. We spent much time establishing boundaries,
looking at other guidelines employed around the country and within Cambridge, taking walking
tours of the boundaries; and researching the history of this great neighborhood.

Once the petition for establishing a Conservation District was filed we were pilloried all
over social media. Audrey Vetrano Cunningham and I were mocked incessantly with video clips
posted to twitter even ridiculing our "Italian accents." Bill Dines was portrayed as an out of
control privileged old white man. John Whisnant was mercilessly described as an old greedy
white man. Truly the basis was absurd since the positions we were taking were absolutely
supported in law. Our MGL c. 40(C) provides standing to owners. It is the law. There is no
value judgement we were making. It is the law.
Recently I note that Conservation Districts in Brookline have been struck down as
unlawful. Why?? Because they did not mirror the process or requirements set forth in MGL. C.
40(C). Our Conservation District ordinance and process up to now is absolutely faithful to
40(C). The Citizen Petition now presented as a Proposed Ordinance, masquerading as Policy
Order 35, is devoid of any foundation in law to be presented as a variation of any Conservation
District composition or process. The Policy Order creates some kind of land use system, not
zoning and not preservation, premised on equity and diversity and business interests. It
completely alters the rigors of standing which are as old as property law itself and
violates 40C. It rejects any notion of professional or academic qualifications likewise in
violation of 40C. And in doing so, this proposal insults the lawyers, architects, real estate
professionals, urban planners and historians who have always comprised the Commission and
the Neighborhood Conservation Districts and most have been uncompensated volunteers.
I am attaching here two cases for your review and suggest that the City Solicitor be
contacted before the Council descends further down this road. The Brookline case clearly
provides that even with a Neighborhood Conservation District, the strictures of MGL c. 40C
apply. You simply cannot ignore state law. And, I am attaching here a Cambridge case
involving our Avon Hill Neighborhood Conservation District in which the Superior Court found
that :

“The Commission incorrectly argues for a "supported by substantial evidence" standard.
Cambridge Municipal Code, 2.78.240 ("The superior court may reverse a determination if
it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record"). To the extent such section of the
Municipal Code seeks to alter the statutory standard of review as set out in G.L.c. 40C,
§12A, such section violates state supremacy, and is therefore void.”

I also note that in violation of Plan E, one City Councilor intervened with the Cambridge
Historic Commission, personally attempting to stop the process and promote her constituents’
position. I have a letter she authored attesting to this and there is also a recorded meeting of the
Conservation District in which she demanded that the entire process be stopped. As this is a

I am also extremely disappointed with the lack of City Council support for neighborhood considerations regarding traffic
and parking. In addition to Garden Street, the treatment of Massachusetts Avenue by the Porter Square area and the
loss of parking that is the life-blood of the small stores is another example. The focus on bikes alone, fails to look at the
reality of people who can’t ride a bike, the icy/snowy winters, the ongoing failure to the MBTA to provide viable
alternative service to cars, the problems for first responders’ close access to properties (Cambridge Hospital is one
example), and the continuation of bike riders on sidewalks, even with the bike lanes.
In next year’s election, I will only support and vote for City Council candidates that represent neighborhood and small
business owner concerns.

Stop the changes to bus routes in west Cambridge (routes 74, 75, 78, & 72)

Dear MBTA,
I am a senior, have no car, and use public transportation. Your proposed cuts to the MBTA bus service in west
Cambridge (routes 74, 75, 78) and the loss of route 72 mean that transit is difficult, or even unavailable (especially on
nights and weekends). The nearest MBTA subway stations are a mile or more away. In winter, the long wait, or even
lack of service makes it difficult to reach necessary destinations. In addition to the weather, for many people, bikes are
not an option.
Currently, the City of Cambridge is building a large elementary school on Vassal Lane, which is a block away from these
routes. Also, the City is removing parking spaces from nearby Garden Street. The result of the City’s actions is that
public transportation is needed even more. And even a minor change makes a major change for the worse for those of
us that don’t have a car.
The letter by Charles Bahne in Cambridge Day, “Proposed bus cuts will make transit unusable”, points out many of the
issues https://www.cambridgeday.com/2022/07/27/proposed-bus-cuts-will-make-transit-unusable/. As the article
states:
“This is the only transit available for a neighborhood that has many medical offices as well as a regional Social Security
office. In addition, much new development has been built and proposed here. Instead of transit-oriented development,
we’ll build the development, then remove the transit!”
A former City councilor, Jan Devereux, made this comment to the Cambridge Day letter:
“The proposed reductions in service will, as you say, make the bus impractical as an alternative to driving. Some people
may say that our area isn’t high need or dense enough to be prioritized for transit service, but they ignore the many
destinations along Concord Ave the bus serves: affordable and senior housing, two nursing homes, medical buildings,
shopping, the existing (and planned future) dense housing and workplaces in the Quad, Danehy Park and Fresh Pond.
This is shortsighted, to say the least, and feels punitive and pointless.”
Please stop the proposed changes to the west Cambridge routes. Instead, given the City of Cambridge’s current actions,
bus service should be increased on these routes.

Biker unhappy with garden changes

Hi,
I'm a regular cyclist, driver and MBTA user, and I vote!
I've appreciated some of the bike lanes changes on Mass Ave, but have to say the garden changes see absolutely insanetraffic today on Concord was crazy, and I cant imagine how many schoolbuses are going to be belching diesel and noise
out onto side streets, all for bike lanes on a street that I already find very safe to ride on.
Meanwhile, parking at the church on garden, where I drop my kids for preschool and have friends who attend AA
meetings, will be severely impacted, in addition to other church services, more people will be circling around looking for
parking ,adding more fumes, noise, frustration and traffic!
Meanwhile, my wife, who drops the kids at preschool and then jumps on the t, will now drive to and from preschool,
(doubling car and emissions time) to get on the bus that is cutting service on Concord to be in traffic again, to then take
the MBTA (and not drive) to get to work.
All of this before Vassal Lane school construction is completed!
Again, we all want well designed bike lanes, espcially as a regular cyclist. But I dont have space to store a cargo bike in
my apartment to take my kids to school, espeically in January!
Thanks for your consideration.

Asunto: TAKE ACTION: Stop the delay of Brattle St. protected bike lanes
Responder-Para: info@cambridgebikesafety.org

Hello bike friends,
While the Garden St. protected bike lanes are currently in the process of being installed, the
City of Cambridge wants to delay the initial Brattle St. protected bike lanes until the
spring, since they can’t get the necessary concrete barriers delivered in time.
This is not acceptable:
1. The delay was preventable. The last public meeting about the new project was
August 8th, but the supplies were only put out for bid on Sep 29th, almost two months
later, with bids due by Oct. 13th. The high-level design was already clear by that
point, so the City could have requested bids much earlier.
2. A delay of 6 months significantly increases the risk of preventable injuries.
Delays of even a few days can lead to more crashes: in both the Garden St. and
Porter Square projects, drivers hit cyclists just a handful of days before the new bike

What we want:
1. In the long term, the City should plan better and order supplies earlier.
2. For now, the City should install the bike lanes anyway, and put in temporary
barriers until it’s possible to install the final concrete barriers. While the City
can’t fully implement the final design, they do have the ability to put down the final
street markings for the bike lanes, and then use temporary cones, barrels, or other
barriers until the concrete barriers are available.

How you can help:
Write to yhuang@cambridgema.gov, council@cambridgema.gov,
ooriordan@cambridgema.gov, bmckenna@cambridgema.gov, and CC
info@cambridgebikesafety.org so we can keep track.
(You can additionally CC clerk@cambridgema.gov to make sure your email appears in the
public record for next week’s council meeting.)
Just a quick two sentence email is perfect!

Talking points:
•

Thank City staff for implementing the Garden St. lanes, and for the upcoming
protected bike lanes on River St. and Hampshire St..

•

Point out the risks of a multiple-month delay to people riding bikes on this stretch;
share your personal experience if relevant.

•

Ask that the city proceed with the project immediately, using temporary barriers until
the concrete barriers can be installed.

•

Note that use of temporary traffic control devices is acceptable within the historic
district with no further approval needed.

Brattle Street Protected Cycle Lane Delays - temporary measures

Dear Councillors,
As a resident of Cambridge, I would like to thank you for the work done to protect vulnerable users of Garden Street. I
was, however, very disappointed to hear about the 6 month delay on the Brattle Street project. This delay will endanger
many lives of vulnerable road users, especially as we move into the winter months. I ask that the city proceed
immediately with temporary measures to protect vulnerable road users on Brattle Street - put down the final street
markings for the bike lanes, and then use temporary cones, barrels, or other barriers until the concrete barriers are
available.
I remind councillors that the use of temporary traffic control devices is acceptable within the historic district with no
further approval needed. The city has a responsibility here to ensure that all measures are taken to protect lives. I
further remind you that just a few weeks before the Garden Street improvements, an 8 month pregnant woman was hit
by a left turning driver at the junction with Linnaean Street. Any delays to cycle lane projects are extremely dangerous
and all efforts must be made to put stop-gap measures in place until a more permanent protection can be offered.
Yours Sincerely,
Graeme Peel

Dear City Manager,
I am extremely disappointed by the decision to proceed with the one way conversion of Garden St.
According to city regulations, the project should have been suspended once the petition was filed and
citizens given the right to a timely appeal.
Converting this major thoroughfare to one way is not a trivial decision.The decision for one way traffic
flow was not part of the CSO (which did mandate the installation of separated bike lanes on Garden
St.) The CSO left the implementation and decision on street design up to the Traffic Director. I think
this important detail, on which the citizen's petition was based, should have been sufficient for the city
solicitor to recommend suspending the project.

Proceeding with Garden St conversion

Dear City Manager + Council:
I am extremely disappointed with your decision to move ahead with the garden street modifications despite the fact
that two petitions to have the traffic board review the plans have been acknowledged. It is not clear to me, from either
a political or financial perspective, why you would blatantly decide to ignore appropriate (by law) process here.
I would strongly urge you to reconsider these modifications and to return them to their original state until the traffic
board has had the opportunity to review and provide input/feedback. I am concerned that your actions will lead to
escalation of a tenuous situation. In a charged election cycle, I should think that hearing all voices/perspectives - and
not just a minority interest group - would be best advised.

Bike safety

Dear Councilmembers,
I am writing to voice my objection to the protected bike lanes on Brattle Street being delayed until the spring. As
someone who bikes on a regular basis and who was recently injured in a car-related bike accident that resulted in a
broken arm, I take bike safety very seriously. There needs to be more physical separation between bikes and motor
vehicles, and we cannot wait months until the concrete barriers are delivered. Even temporary measures such as cones
or barrels are better than nothing - there need to be clear markings to denote bike-specific lanes, and this will be
exceedingly important as we get into the winter months with the potential for restricted bike mobility on the street due
to snow. I ask that you please proceed with the project immediately using temporary barriers, especially as no further
approval would be needed.
There are enough people injured because of a lack of protected bike lanes (myself included) - the last thing we need is
another ghost bike planted at an intersection.
Sincerely,
Kathryn Nassberg

How is this democratic? Does the City administration not exist to serve the needs and interests of
ALL City residents or merely a few specific pressure groups? I and many others like me are disgusted
by this undemocratic decision – and the decisions that were made about Mass Ave regarding bike
lanes – all of which are worsening the quality of life for LONG-TERM residents and families in this
City. It will be reflected in my voting choices for Council going forward.

Cambridge Traffic/Bike Lanes

City Council:
1. Your bike lane policies have destroyed the neighborhoods and rendered unsafe Harvard Square, Inman Square, and
now Garden Street, with no end to your ill-advised assault on common sense in sight.
2. You have been cowed by a small minority of residents in a headlong rush to appease a loud lobby at the expense of
the safety, and neighborhood integrity.
3. The unsightly, disorganized, congested, dysfunctional and hazardous conditions of our roads, sidewalks, parking
spaces and access to neighborhood businesses would be laughable were it not so patently offensive to the rights of a
majority of Cambridge residents.
4. I stand with those citizens who have been unheard and foreclosed from voicing unequivocal objection to the City’s
bike lane policies.

Dear Councillors, City Manager, and City Staff,
I'm writing to ask that the city proceed with the Brattle Street bike lane installation immediately. I bike this stretch of
Brattle Street to and from work multiple times a day, and I have felt much less safe since the sharrows were
removed in preparation for the new bike lanes. I've actually been counting down the days until the new bike
lanes will be installed and ready for use!
So when I heard that there is a potential multiple-month delay due to concrete material delays, I was upset. I feel
very nervous about the dangerous current state of affairs continuing through the winter. Please put down the final
street markings for the bike lanes now, and use temporary cones, barrels, or other barriers until the concrete
barriers are available.
Thank you for approving these designs and for executing them as soon as possible!

Re: Garden Street Conversion to One-Way
Distress for elderly drivers on Walker Street!; RE: Garden Street Changes Hardly an
Improvement for Walker Street Access

Dear Sam and Frank Reese,
Many thanks and much appreciation for your plea to the City of Cambridge.
We often meet when you’re out walking with your adorable dogs and I now with my rollator. I too have enjoyed my
home on Walker Street, and am distressed by the traffic and circulation problems caused by this unfortunate
development.
I write now to thank you for your ‘legalistic’ appeal to the City of Cambridge, about the disruption of transport to and
from our homes, and the additional traffic on Walker Street caused by the unfortunate conversion of Garden Street to
one-way into the Common and Harvard Square. I add to those addressed in the City Gov the name of Stephen Meuse,
the Cambridge Project Manager. And I add copies of my earlier please to him, and his initial reply.
Thanks again for your reaction, and do please keep my name on the list, and especially if there are any possibilities of
reversal of this unfortunate development in our neighborhood.
Kind regards,
Pat Grimsted

Subject: Garden Street Conversion to One-Way

Dear City Manager,
I find it ironic that in a city as exceptionally well-managed as Cambridge, that the Garden Street
conversion to one-way has been such a botched project. Not only has it created a traffic flow
nightmare, the entire process is in violation of established law. In a city where citizens’ opinions have
historically been actively sought, our appeal has been ignored.
Over and above this compelling reason to reverse course is the adverse impact on the neighborhood.
Due to the ill-conceived one-way on Garden, the traffic department has converted a sleepy residential
street into a high speed thoroughfare. My wife and I are elderly, but active walkers of two small dogs.
Walker Street supports considerable pedestrian traffic, bicycles, small children heading to the nearby
elementary school, and Harvard students on scooters. Those with driveways must back out into the
street. For the 50 years we have lived here, it has always been a safe, quiet, and vehicle friendly
street. Suddenly it has become a perceived short-cut for irritated drivers trying to get through to
Massachusetts Avenue. Walker Street is no longer a safe place to travel.
To restate the obvious: My wife and I are surprised and discouraged by your decision to flaunt the law
and to allow Garden Street to be converted to one-way without due process. The Traffic Director’s
decision is unlawful and has created unanticipated consequences that must be remedied.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns,
Sam and Frank Reece

Distress for elderly drivers on Walker Street!

I remain MOST DISTRTESSED to hear that the one-way Garden Street project is going through.
Several others on Walker Street are also confused and distressed.
I hope you’ll come up with advice for Walker ST residents who regularly drive to Fresh Pond and Belmont, and
For those who need to access Walker Street from the Common and Sheraton Commander!
And what about the Harvard /shuttle service?? And all our deliveries??
Most distressing,

RE: Garden Street Changes Hardly an Improvement for Walker Street Access

Hi Pat,
Options 2 and 3, that involve one way conversions of Garden Street, would impact some travel times to access Walker
Street depending on where you’re coming from, but our analysis is showing that it should be relatively minor. Of course
any increase in travel time can be considered a negative for many people and we understand that. We do have the 3
options under consideration still and we are asking for feedback about which would work best for the community. One
of those options does not impact access to Walker Street, though it does involve other tradeoffs.
The one-way conversion is not about one-way vs two-way bike lanes. Both can fit with two-way vehicle traffic (and no
parking). We looked at one-way options as a response to feedback from neighbors asking us to maintain as much
parking on Garden Street as possible, and in both one-way options, parking is increased along Garden Street in the
vicinity of Walker St.
When we have separated bike lanes, we also no longer need to post for street cleaning, as cars would no longer be
parked along the curb. Our sweepers would sweep the bike lane along the curb where the debris naturally accumulates
and people wouldn’t need to move their cars.
Hope this helps. Feel free to reach out again if you have any other questions or if you would like me to provide more
detail.
Regards.

As a now elderly longtime resident of Walker Street, who is still at the wheel, making Garden Street one way towards
the Square would be a SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE for access to Walker Street, as many would be coming most frequently
from Harvard Square.
Those who live on this street REALLY need easy access from both directions!
I can appreciate that cyclists may like a bike lanes on both sides of the street, but certainly I for one would strongly VETO
the one-way street suggestion for cars. I don’t know how other neighbors react to such a suggestion.
I’ll try to join the Community Meeting, if possible, but I hope that more of my Walker Street neighbors will speak up
about this plan. They will all be left with a good bit more extra driving and more frustration to reach their homes!
On street cleaning days, some Walker Street residents without off-street parking need to seek parking on Garden Street,
and what will happen to those possibilities?!?
Kind regards

North Mass Zoning Petition

Honorable Mayor and City Council,

A zoning petition for a small section of the North Mass Ave Overlay was submitted through me on behalf of
North Cambridge Partners. We hope that you will give it due consideration as it goes through the process of Planning
Board and Ordinance Committee review. The Mass Ave overlay was created in 1986 and has been amended five times
with the most recent amendments brought in 2012 which were designed to protect historical buildings, promote
outdoor seating, and to promote retail uses on the ground floor. Since those changes, the city has embarked on several
planning studies to try to spur housing development but very little has changed along this transit adjacent corridor. The
Envision study identified the main corridors of the city as areas where mixed use development, specifically with housing,
could and should be developed. The Cambridge St. study released, in part, last week showed heights and densities very
similar to the ones we are proposing, and we would argue that Mass Ave is an area where CDD’s proposed development
scheme is more likely to be realized. Since Monday night falls on Halloween and there is another likely to be much more
contentious petition before the Council, we will not be appearing to give public comment and offer this brief statement
in hope that staff may be able to get out of session earlier to be with their families and to enjoy the holiday. We look
forward to discussing this with the Council and are eager to hear your input.

Sincere Regards,

Patrick W. Barrett
Tim Rowe (North Cambridge Partners, LLC.)
Dan Sibor (North Cambridge Partners, LLC.)

We in our neighborhood are greatly disturbed by the traffic director's decision regarding the
conversion of Garden St to a one way street. Not only does it pose significant difficulties of
getting in and out of neighborhoods around the square, but it is impossible to understand how
this conversion will increase the safety or flow of traffic. I predict problems ahead, accidents,
increased speeding and a number of unanticipated issues that negatively impact this wide
neighborhood (and city elections in the future).

Garden St. petition

Dear Mr. Wang:
My husband and I have lived on Garden Street, at the corner of Walker St. for 46 years. We’ve
planted trees in our garden, raised kids and dogs and watched traffic and students go by. Now we
try to keep the Walker St. neighborhood a safe place to raise grandchildren. Thus, we are
extremely disappointed in your decision to allow Garden St. to be converted to one-way between
Huron Ave and Arsenal Square, despite our petition appealing the Traffic Director’s
decision. According to the law, all work should be suspended until the Traffic Board hears the
neighborhood's appeal and reaches a decision. It is unclear to us how the City could reach a
decision to proceed, in clear violation of its own laws. No work has been suspended at all.
Then there is the issue of why does the bicycle lobby get to choose what happens to traffic
circulation in our residential neighborhood? Bicyclists on Garden Street consist almost 100% of
Harvard students throughout the day. They can choose to get from their dorms, into the Square
on foot, by bicycle/electric scooter or bus. (By the way, electric scooters go about as fast as
cars!) Students have a place to park their “vehicles” safely and off the street, and they don’t pay
property taxes for these necessities! Oh, and by the way they don’t vote either!
Frustrated motorists trying to head North out of the Square, find they can’t access Mass Ave
from Concord Ave., then Bond St., then Garden St., so are bombing down Walker thinking it runs
thru to Mass. Ave. It doesn’t! They slam on the brakes, maneuver around the 90º turn at the
corner of Walker, and are faced with another stop sign at Shepard, but still no way to head North
on Garden.
And how about parking cars in the “middle” of Garden St. Is this a necessary
"improvement"? Why has parking been moved to the odd side of the street, after at least 46
years of being on the even side? And how’s parking in the middle of the street going to work
when it snows? I’ve learned that at least 34 parking spaces have been removed from Garden
St.. Those residents (and many are also taxpayers) will be vying for parking on the Garden side
streets. Good luck to us all!

regarding Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment

I am proud to have been one of the signees of the citizens petition for the Cambridge Lab Regulation
Zoning Amendment (APP 2022 #53 on tonight’s City Council agenda) because it is time that the City
of Cambridge begin protecting our neighborhoods from both residential and small business
displacement. The scientific and pharmacological biotech industry has surrounded neighborhoods
that once were economically accessible to residents of limited and moderate means. Protecting the
areas identified in the amendment is one step policymakers can take to interrupt the affordability
crisis that has already severely affected the city.

Cambridge Streets for All

Dear city managers,
It is beyond my belief, having lived in this city for four decades, how certain decisions that should be public matters are
being made without taking the well-being of all its residents into consideration.
This type of behaviors on the city part has become now a pattern, and frankly sickening.
The Garden street being converted to a ONE WAY street is absolutely absurd and unwarranted. The inconvenience that
it will create, the traffic congestion, the confusion, and the list can go on.
These overnight, inconsiderate, ABRUPT decisions only indicate that the city is trying to please a certain minority
population, and scare away the rest; I would not be surprised if the city authorities succeed. We are at the verge of
having mental, emotional exhaustion by these type of decision markings.
This and some of the most recent city resolutions, which are not reflecting ALL the Cambridge residents’ wishes, will
be impacting my VOTES in a significant way, in the coming year!
Please do reconsider!
Best Regards,
Sima Kainejad, MA, LMHC

Dear City Manager,
We are extremely disappointed in your decision to allow Garden St. to be converted to one-way despite our petition
appealing the Traffic Director’s decision. According to the law, all work should be suspended until the Traffic Board hears
our appeal and reaches a decision. It is unclear how the city could reach the decision to proceed in clear violation of its own

Garden Street converstion

Dear City Manager Huang,
I am looking forward to the opportunity to meet you in person, unfortunately I cannot wait. I must
speak up now about the ongoing disaster that is inappropriately named the Cycling Safety Ordinance,
which neither promotes safer cycling nor produces safer streets as the proliferation of traffic accidents
on North Mass Ave has shown in the one year since the QB lanes were installed. The
CSO masquerades as a forward thinking, green initiative that is instead producing greater pollution
from traffic congestion and idling cars. Rather than increasing safety the CSO is producing more
traffic accidents while also marginalizing small businesses and hurting the majority of Cambridge’s
citizenry to advantage a tiny minority of cyclists, many of whom are merely commuters traveling
through our city.
Today, I write to join the many others who have written to express how profoundly disappointed we
are in your decision to allow Garden Street to be converted to one-way despite the petition appealing
the Traffic Director’s decision. According to the law, all work should be suspended until the Traffic
Board hears the appeal and reaches a decision. How can the city proceed in clear violation of its own
laws? The changed traffic pattern on Garden will only increase congestion and pollution throughout
North and West Cambridge and further harm local residents.

We all realize that you are new to this job and clearly inherited this and other
problems. However, by your own statements in recent City Council Meetings you have both
acknowledged the existence of the Traffic Board and simultaneously ignored its mandate to promptly
(within 2 weeks) hold a hearing on the petitions from Brattle and Garden Streets that are before that
board.
We hope this problem can yet be resolved.
Sincerely,
Vickey Bestor

Brattle Street projected bike lanes

Hello,
I am writing to thank the city of Cambridge for adding projected bike lanes. These are very important
infrastructure projects to implement. The bike lane projects like the Garden St. lanes, and for the upcoming
protected bike lanes on River St. and Hampshire St make a difference in people's lives. Protected bike lanes are
essential in the Cambridge area. Why? In the past month, I had the following happen to me:
•
•

a car swerved into an unprotected bike lane almost hitting me for no reason
a car honked at me continuously while I was biking on the side of the road. There was no space for the car
to pass me so the driver honked at me non-stop.

As an avid biker, I know firsthand that it is unsafe to bike beside automobiles on the Cambridge streets. Protected
bike lanes should be seen as crucial by the Cambridge council. Please proceed with temporary barriers on Brattle
Street. There are too many risks to delay implementing a protected bike path on Brattle Street. The use of
temporary traffic control devices is acceptable within the historic district with no further approval needed.

-Tricia Carney,
resident of Cambridge

Re: Garden Street Conversion to One-Way

I join my fellow residents in writing to all city officials to express my concerns both for safety, legality, and due process
for the changes recently rushed through for Garden Street
I would expect that a city like Cambridge could do a much better job on all three
And it feels to me like those most affected were most disregarded while an ill conceived plan was quickly pushed
through to satisfy a poorly identified constituency along with some misguided notions of advancing bicycle use and
perhaps some vaguely articulated modest environmental benefit at the expense of the residents’ safety .
I urge you to re open the process of deliberation on this issue immediately to restore our faith in city government and
at a time when we worry about the efficacy of the workings of our democracy that you each demonstrate your
commitment to open deliberative process so that we can prudently consider restoring Garden Street to its former safer
plan
Respectfully submitted

Dear City Manager,
I find it ironic that in a city as exceptionally well-managed as Cambridge, that the Garden Street
conversion to one-way has been such a botched project. Not only has it created a traffic flow
nightmare, the entire process is in violation of established law. In a city where citizens’ opinions have
historically been actively sought, our appeal has been ignored.
Over and above this compelling reason to reverse course is the adverse impact on the neighborhood.
Due to the ill-conceived one-way on Garden, the traffic department has converted a sleepy residential
street into a high speed thoroughfare. My wife and I are elderly, but active walkers of two small dogs.
Walker Street supports considerable pedestrian traffic, bicycles, small children heading to the nearby
elementary school, and Harvard students on scooters. Those with driveways must back out into the
street. For the 50 years we have lived here, it has always been a safe, quiet, and vehicle friendly
street. Suddenly it has become a perceived short-cut for irritated drivers trying to get through to
Massachusetts Avenue. Walker Street is no longer a safe place to travel.
To restate the obvious: My wife and I are surprised and discouraged by your decision to flaunt the law
and to allow Garden Street to be converted to one-way without due process. The Traffic Director’s
decision is unlawful and has created unanticipated consequences that must be remedied.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns,
Sam and Frank Reece

Install Brattle St. Bike Lanes Now

City Manager Huang, Commissioner O'Riordan, Assistant Director McKenna, and the Cambridge City Council:
First, thank you for implementing the Garden St. bike lanes, and for the upcoming protected bike lanes on
River St. and Hampshire St. I do not own a car so I bike everywhere - to and from work, to get groceries, and
just around Cambridge. Bike lanes, especially protected bike lanes, make my rides safer and more enjoyable.
The proposed 6 month delay in constructing protected bike lanes along Brattle street will, without a doubt,
allow for more crashes and cyclists getting hurt. This is something that must be mitigated.
I am asking you to proceed with the project immediately, using temporary barriers until the concrete barriers
can be installed. It should be noted that use of temporary traffic control devices is acceptable within the historic
district with no further approval needed, until the concrete barriers are delivered and installed.
Thank you,
Ruby A.

In support of this view, I am conducting my own traffic survey documenting the increase in volume. As it happens, an
elderly woman with a walker was making her way around the corner about 30 mins ago and almost got hit by a
truck! See the attached photo. You are correct, it’s just a matter of time. The tradeoff of cyclist safety for pedestrian
and child safety is unimaginable, really. Oh, by the way the majority of this traffic increase now drives right past
Graham & Parks elementary school!
The street was a route that was walked by many (Elizabeth Warren included), where our children played. No
longer. We will continue to seek recourse with the city. This was not only completely predictable but also avoidable.

Dear Yi-An Huang:
We appreciate your letter even though it does not address our concerns.
The fact that you consulted with the City Solicitor [Nancy Glowa] on the legality of moving forward with the
Garden Street changes would indicate that you were aware of the legal requirement for the Traffic Board to
hear our petition before implementing traffic changes. The appropriate and legal steps to have taken were
to 1) appoint three new members to the Board, 2) hear our petition, and then 3) determine how best to
move forward with the substantial changes to our neighborhood’s traffic patterns. There is little doubt that
your process has been backwards: 1) redirect traffic, 2) look at our petition, 3) recruit a new Board. Really?
Cambridge is perhaps the best run city in the Commonwealth, and you’ve approached this project
backwards.
Further, our letter to you of October 30th referred specifically to the increased traffic volume of both cars
and trucks, as well as the unacceptable vehicle speeds on Walker Street. Our safety has been compromised.
Someone is going to get hurt: A child, a dog walker, a bicyclist or scooterist, a pedestrian, it is just a matter
of time, and soon daylight savings will make conditions worse. Perhaps additional signage would help, or a
couple of speed bumps along Walker between Garden and Shepard? You’re the expert, and we need your
help on these issues.
Yes, the residents of Walker Street feel “unheard and frustrated”. Perhaps your next letter can remedy these
feelings as well as the issues that caused them.
Thank you,

RE: Lab Ban Petition Issue
lab regulation signature collection.xlsx

Honorable Mayor, City Manager, Cambridge City Council, Planning Board, and Ordinance Committee,
I refrained from coming in on Monday night to speak about the second coming of the lab ban primarily due to
the holiday but also in deference to people I'm working with to try to keep some semblance of "church and
state" in my work. I'm glad most people refrained and let staff be with family. I have a lot of questions and
hopefully the petitioners will be able to answer them, but in the committee where the first
attempt currently rests; not under the gun of a zoning petition. However, my biggest concern is centered on
one of the Ordinance Committee Chairs, Quinton Zondervan, who not only foreshadowed/threatened this
petition in open discussion during his first attempt to pass this exact language, but also included a link in his
newsletter dated October 7th, 2022 to contact Lee Farris encouraging people to sign it. Here is the link to
the Zondervan Newsletter and here is the concerning language:
"Unfortunately, the council decided to send this petition to a six-month study instead of sending
it to the Planning Board and Ordinance Committee for hearings immediately. I am deeply
concerned about the impact any delay in this conversation will have on our city. I recently
learned that a group of residents from across the city are taking up the torch and filing a citizens'
petition, which is automatically sent to the Planning Board and Ordinance Committee.
Please contact Lee Farris if you would like to sign the zoning petition."
While there is nothing "illegal" about what is being done here I think there is a compelling interest given
Zondervan's endorsement, and that his aide, omitted from this newsletter link, was also collecting signatures
with Farris (Spreadsheet of Signatures), significantly compromises Councilor Zondervan's ability to adjudicate
and possibly even vote on this petition language as it appears he is using his aide and Lee Farris as proxies for
his own agenda item currently in committee. At the bare minimum this raises some significant ethical
questions. I also think this might be a good time, since we are currently reviewing the charter, to include some
limiting language on what Council aides are allowed to do or more importantly; not do. I ask that
Zondervan recuse himself from voting on this petition and that he not be allowed to chair the
ordinance committee meetings on this either willingly or by order of the Mayor or City Manager in order
to preserve the integrity of the Ordinance Committee, Council, and to eliminate the perception that Zondervan
is using both his aide and a willing private citizen, who also claims leadership of her own political organization,
to put his thumb on the scales of process in this city.
Lastly, it shouldn't go unnoticed that once again Central Square is being put in the spotlight of further zoning
restrictions. We are about to come up on the nine year anniversary of the C2 planning study final
report. How incredibly sad is it that in the wake of all of these discussions on housing, labs, and development
we have wasted not only favorable market conditions but invaluable time, and in absence of that plan seen
very little growth or development in Central Square. Market Central and 907 Main are really the only examples
of C2-like development. With the expense of BEUDO, an excessive increase to linkage, and an inclusionary
zoning scheme that is absolutely broken I would be very interested to hear from the Council and Planning
Department how they imagine the future of Central Square. We learned in the 2019 Nexus Study that lab use

is really the only use that can "afford" to pay linkage. For those concerned about linkage amendments and
their impact ought to be even more concerned about what happens when you remove the source of those
payments. This conversation deserves time and consideration and attention to past work yet unfinished. If labs
are to be removed from a development plan for any square, what does the Council imagine will be built?
Housing? Central Square is largely built out and under private ownership and given how broken the current
inclusionary system is, that is highly doubtful. I would point out that the DHCD has not only recommended not
going above 10% for inclusionary zoning requirements, but they have made it legally impossible for
municipalities to go above 20%; as Cambridge did in 2015. (DHCD Guidelines) In the absence of any coherent
reasoning, the only other possibility is maybe this is yet another plan to stop development in Central Square
entirely? They have tried before. And again. Labs, or "Biotech" as Zondervan puts it in his letter, play a very
important role in our society, local economy, and shouldn't be removed from any plan to develop the city nor
our business districts; nuance is what is called for. Do we ban R&D from business districts? It will get
complicated. This conversation deserves time and consideration and attention to past work yet unfinished.
Please send this petition to ordinance quickly, vote it down, and let's make an honest
commitment to finishing what we started nine years ago.

Dear City Manager,
We are extremely disappointed in your decision to allow Garden St to be converted to one-way despite our
petition appealing the Traffic Director’s decision. According to the law, all work should be suspended until the
Traffic Board hears our appeal and reaches a decision. It is unclear how the city could reach the decision to
proceed in clear violation of its own laws.

Dear City Staff,
Thank you for implementing bike lanes on Garden St. and the upcoming River St. and Hampshire Street projects.
However I heard there may be a delay in ordering supplies. A months long delay to can risk lives of cyclist and
increase traffic as it forces people into cars. I request we use temporary barriers while this is being resolved.

Re: Garden Street Conversion to One-Way - a traffic disaster

Dear City Manager and all council members
You have ignored the voices of Cambridge residents. Without solid evidence of the
need for the change of traffic on Garden Street. This worsens the lives of many citizens
who walk and need to drive around town so essential to the vibrancy of Cambridge.

Not only has it created a traffic flow nightmare, the entire process is in violation of
established law. In a city where citizens’ opinions have historically been actively sought,
our appeal has been ignored.
Over and above this compelling reason to reverse course is the adverse impact on the
neighborhood. Due to the ill-conceived one-way on Garden, the traffic department has
converted a sleepy residential street into a high speed Those with driveways must back
out into the the street. Suddenly it has become a perceived short-cut for irritated drivers
trying to get through to Massachusetts Avenue. Walker Street is no longer a safe place
to travel. Garden street where my driveway is has become harder to back out of and

drive into. Of this change were for the better I would not complain. However the
disadvantages of these traffic changes far outweigh any benefits.
To restate the obvious: We are surprised and discouraged by your decision to flaunt the
law and to allow Garden Street to be converted to one-way without due process. The
Traffic Director’s decision is unlawful and has created unanticipated consequences that
must be remedied.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns,

Lee Farris: comments supporting lab regulation zoning petition

[Please include these comments in the public record.]
Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am one of the many signers of the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning petition.
This petition comes from over 250 people who are very concerned about lab expansion into the squares, and who don’t
think the conversation about what to do should be put off for another 6 months. The law gives residents the right to
submit a zoning petition at any time, and we are thoughtfully exercising this right. Over 250 signers is one of the largest
zoning efforts in recent memory. Signers include residents of below-market housing, market tenants, homeowners,
local businesses owners, and people from many different neighborhoods and groups.
The petition would prohibit new biotech lab construction in Cambridge's neighborhoods and squares, including Central,
Harvard, Porter, Inman, Cambridge Street, River Street, Concord Ave., Broadway, and more. Labs would continue to be
allowed in the Kendall Sq. area, the eastern part of Cambridgeport, and some parts of Alewife. The Alewife Overlay
Development Moratorium prohibits new lab development in Alewife Overlay Districts 1-5 until December 31,
2023. Future zoning in that area will be decided by a separate process that is already underway.
The petition proposes three zoning changes. It:
1. Defines the lab use, finally distinguishing it from other commercial uses. Similar but non-threatening uses like
dentist offices and academic research buildings are explicitly carved out.
2. Restricts new instances of lab use in vulnerable squares and zoned business districts.
3. Completely grandfathers all existing instances of the lab use within newly restricted areas.
I have seen estimates that lab development is around 3 times as profitable as market housing. Retail is also much less
profitable than labs.
I live near Central Sq. and am very concerned that lab development projects would crowd out housing and small retail. I
remember during the hearings on re-zoning Central Sq. for the Mass and Main project, the developer said the only
alternative to the proposed housing would be a lab building. I supported re-zoning Central Sq. to try to encourage more
housing. If labs are allowed, it will be harder to get housing.
When I asked residents to sign the petition, I found many residents were upset to learn that biotech labs were allowed
in some of these places.
I look forward to talking with councilors and city staff about where labs should and should not be allowed in our city.
Thanks for your consideration,

Re: Ignoring citizen’s rights

Dear Yi-An,
1. While we appreciate your reply to Mrs. Cetrulo’s email, it misses the salient point: The City has not implemented
improvements.
2. The City has replaced one problem which is correctable by strict enforcement of traffic laws (bicyclists who ignore
rules-of-the-road) with another harder-to-solve problem (creation of congested, unsafe, and unsightly side-street
issues).
3. In the short space of one week, the City has transformed Holly Ave. from a quiet, one lane, one block-long, residential
street, used primarily by residents, to a high speed cut-through for motorists seeking to avoid the congestion caused by
making Garden St. one-way.
4. In appeasing a vocal minority (bicyclists who generally do not own property on their routes of travel) you have
accomplished the dubious distinction of trammeling the rights of real estate tax-paying residents to the quiet enjoyment
of their property.
5. You have an impending crisis on Holly Ave. and elsewhere.
6. What are your plans to address the foreseeable consequences of your Garden St. decision?
Respectfully Submitted

We recognize that implementing roadway improvements, including the installation of bike lanes pursuant to the Cycling
Safety Ordinance, has been difficult for our community. The City has undertaken significant efforts to develop options
that balance the imperative need to improve bicycle safety while mitigating disruptions to parking, traffic patterns, and
neighborhoods. This is not easy given the density of our streets. We have also put tremendous effort into community
engagement and acknowledge that many people still feel unheard and frustrated.
We will continue to strive for improvement on all fronts while navigating the challenges that face our community. Please
continue writing and engaging with the city!

To All,
Once again the actual citizens who have some knowledge about issues in their neighborhoods have been ignored. I have
followed the lack of responsiveness to citizen’s concerns for years now. How a bike lobby and misguided information
and a lack of expertise on traffic patterns and safety could not be stopped from completely ruining Cambridge is beyond
me. I speak not just for my neigborhood but to name another the complete boggle that is Inman Square.
It is frightening to drive lest you hit a biker or pedestrian or other car at numerous intersections. Harvard Square is all
but ruined…yet we citizens are all but muzzled and ignored. Outrageous for people who think themselves representing a
future Cambridge…

Surely if this was done without due process, it should be stopped in its tracks.
Maybe for the moment the best would be a sign saying “Residents Only”.

In support of this view, I am conducting my own traffic survey documenting the
increase in volume. As it happens, an elderly woman with a walker was making her
way around the corner about 30 mins ago and almost got hit by a truck! See the
attached photo. You are correct, it’s just a matter of time. The tradeoff of cyclist
safety for pedestrian and child safety is unimaginable, really. Oh, by the way the
majority of this traffic increase now drives right past Graham & Parks elementary
school!
The street was a route that was walked by many (Elizabeth Warren included), where
our children played. No longer. We will continue to seek recourse with the city. This
was not only completely predictable but also avoidable.

Dear Yi-An Huang:
We appreciate your letter even though it does not address our concerns.
The fact that you consulted with the City Solicitor [Nancy Glowa] on the
legality of moving forward with the Garden Street changes would indicate that
you were aware of the legal requirement for the Traffic Board to hear our
petition before implementing traffic changes. The appropriate and legal steps
to have taken were to 1) appoint three new members to the Board, 2) hear our
petition, and then 3) determine how best to move forward with the substantial
changes to our neighborhood’s traffic patterns. There is little doubt that your
process has been backwards: 1) redirect traffic, 2) look at our petition, 3)
recruit a new Board. Really? Cambridge is perhaps the best run city in the
Commonwealth, and you’ve approached this project backwards.
Further, our letter to you of October 30th referred specifically to the increased
traffic volume of both cars and trucks, as well as the unacceptable vehicle
speeds on Walker Street. Our safety has been compromised. Someone is going
to get hurt: A child, a dog walker, a bicyclist or scooterist, a pedestrian, it is just
a matter of time, and soon daylight savings will make conditions worse.
Perhaps additional signage would help, or a couple of speed bumps along
Walker between Garden and Shepard? You’re the expert, and we need your
help on these issues.
Yes, the residents of Walker Street feel “unheard and frustrated”. Perhaps
your next letter can remedy these feelings as well as the issues that caused
them.
Thank you,

Delay of protected bike lanes on Brattle Street

To whom it may concern,
I was disappointed when I recently found out that the implementation of the protected cycle track on Brattle Street
would be delayed until next spring.
The Garden Street project has been an unmitigated success so far, and as someone who cycles from the west via Brattle
on a daily basis, I would love to have a more direct route that feels just as safe and comfortable.
As the creator of https://twitter.com/CambridgeCrash, I am acutely aware of the risks posed by delays to critical cycling
infrastructure. In fact, two crashes involving a cyclist and a pedestrian occurred in the week leading up to the Garden
Street implementation. I fear what injuries may occur if Brattle Street remains unfinished for 6 months.
Therefore, I am requesting that the department take whatever steps necessary to complete the project as soon as
possible. Even temporary separators would be a vast improvement while we await the precast concrete. I would also
like to point out that temporary traffic control devices do not require approval from the historical commission.
I look forward to hearing how the city will address these concerns soon.

Additional Comments on Garden Street Conversion

Dear Yi-An Huang,
We write to add to the voices of our Walker Street neighbors. We concur with the letters already sent and must express
our deep concern over the traffic changes made without proper process or consideration of its impact on those of us
living adjacent to Garden Street.
We live precisely on Walker Street sharp curve to the left (at 60 Walker) and can testify to the difficulties this change has
caused. The added danger to our children and elderly from increased traffic on our small street is marked and
frightening. (It will be worse when snow narrows the street further in the winter months to come.) More cars than ever
are also illegally parked at the “dog leg” to the left on Walker Street and block the increased traffic now diverting to
Walker Street to avoid Garden. Trucks cannot make the Walker Street curve, and further endanger everyone by
stopping traffic and having to back up all the way to Garden since they can no longer get through. The noise of horns
honking and back up beeping signals has awoken us three mornings this week before 6am. It has added an extra level of
exhaustion to these traffic changes.
As a pedestrian who walks from Garden to the Square and campus daily, I can also testify that I have already had close
calls and have had to dodge cyclists when even attempting to cross Garden Street at any point now. The cyclists do not
stop at street corners and do not consider the welfare of pedestrians. More cyclists are also now on the sidewalks on
Garden Street and they ignore the regulations to stop for pedestrians in the cross walks. You are courting disaster with

Re: Follow-Up on Garden Street Conversion

Dear Yi-An Huang,
We write to add to the voices of our Walker Street neighbors. We concur with the letters already sent and must express
our deep concern over the traffic changes made without proper process or consideration of its impact on those of us
living adjacent to Garden Street.
We live precisely on Walker Street sharp curve to the left (at 60 Walker) and can testify to the difficulties this change has
caused. The added danger to our children and elderly from increased traffic on our small street is marked and
frightening. (It will be worse when snow narrows the street further in the winter months to come.) More cars than ever
are also illegally parked at the “dog leg” to the left on Walker Street and block the increased traffic now diverting to
Walker Street to avoid Garden. Trucks cannot make the Walker Street curve, and further endanger everyone by
stopping traffic and having to back up all the way to Garden since they can no longer get through. The noise of horns
honking and back up beeping signals has awoken us three mornings this week before 6am. It has added an extra level of
exhaustion to these traffic changes.
As a pedestrian who walks from Garden to the Square and campus daily, I can also testify that I have already had close
calls and have had to dodge cyclists when even attempting to cross Garden Street at any point now. The cyclists do not
stop at street corners and do not consider the welfare of pedestrians. More cyclists are also now on the sidewalks on
Garden Street and they ignore the regulations to stop for pedestrians in the cross walks. You are courting disaster with
this new traffic pattern and with the practice by cyclists of simply pressing on through intersections, ignoring pedestrians
in the process of crossing.
Please reconsider the changes you have made to Garden Street. You have reduced our quality of life in the
neighborhood and are actively endangering many who seek to walk safely in the neighborhood in which they live.
With deep concern,

Subject: Follow-Up on Garden Street Conversion
Dear Yi-An Huang:
We appreciate your letter even though it does not address our concerns.
The fact that you consulted with the City Solicitor [Nancy Glowa] on the legality of moving forward with the
Garden Street changes would indicate that you were aware of the legal requirement for the Traffic Board to
hear our petition before implementing traffic changes. The appropriate and legal steps to have taken were to
1) appoint three new members to the Board, 2) hear our petition, and then 3) determine how best to move
forward with the substantial changes to our neighborhood’s traffic patterns. There is little doubt that your
process has been backwards: 1) redirect traffic, 2) look at our petition, 3) recruit a new Board. Really?
Cambridge is perhaps the best run city in the Commonwealth, and you’ve approached this project backwards.
Further, our letter to you of October 30th referred specifically to the increased traffic volume of both cars and
trucks, as well as the unacceptable vehicle speeds on Walker Street. Our safety has been compromised.
Someone is going to get hurt: A child, a dog walker, a bicyclist or scooterist, a pedestrian, it is just a matter of
time, and soon daylight savings will make conditions worse. Perhaps additional signage would help, or a
couple of speed bumps along Walker between Garden and Shepard? You’re the expert, and we need your help
on these issues.
Yes, the residents of Walker Street feel “unheard and frustrated”. Perhaps your next letter can remedy these
feelings as well as the issues that caused them.
Thank you,
Frank & Sam Reece

Re: Follow-Up on Garden Street Conversion

All,
Informal traffic study day 1:
Date: Wednesday 11/2/2022
Time: 4:57pm - 5:27pm
Vehicles: 44
Hourly Rate: 88/hr
For analytical context, when the city conducted a traffic study on Tuesday June 14, 2022, there were 290 Westbound
vehicles on Garden Street per hour in the 4:30-5:30 time block. Walker street has taken a full 30% of the pre-change
traffic burden!
We have seen the street go from a place where kids were occasionally interrupted when throwing a football in the
street to 1.5 cars/minute - a rate at which if they're not careful crossing, there could be a tragedy!
I will keep logging data at different days and times to generate a convincing case to the city. And, hopefully no one will
get hurt.
Joe

Brattle St Bike Lanes

Hi all,
I write with concern for the health and wellbeing of fellow residents. I want to convey the following points for
your consideration:

•
•
•
•

Thank City staff for implementing the Garden St. lanes, and for the upcoming protected bike lanes on River St.
and Hampshire St..
Point out the risks of a multiple-month delay to people riding bikes on this stretch; share your personal
experience if relevant.
Ask that the city proceed with the project immediately, using temporary barriers until the concrete barriers
can be installed.
Note that use of temporary traffic control devices is acceptable within the historic district with no further
approval needed.

In addition to endangering residents who are trying to move safely and securely through our streets, delaying this work
continues to discourage more of our residents to take the necessary and highly beneficial step of choosing active
transportation over private vehicles.
Kindest regards,
Guillaume Bouchard
Riverside resident

Lisa - Sorry for my tardy response. My email is flooded, which is a good thing, I guess. Lots of neighborhood interest in

My current thinking is the more voices heard by the City Manager and Council, the better.
Steve’s letter was perfect. This piling on, as it were, may have some positive attention-getting effect…Time will tell.

From our vantage point (2 Walker) we can see cars & trucks entering Walker Street, but
lose sight of them pretty quickly.
It is good to have a record of what goes on at the corner, particularly when they are
traveling so fast.

Frank & Sam,
In support of this view, I am conducting my own traffic survey documenting the increase in volume. As it happens, an
elderly woman with a walker was making her way around the corner about 30 mins ago and almost got hit by a
truck! See the attached photo. You are correct, it’s just a matter of time. The tradeoff of cyclist safety for pedestrian
and child safety is unimaginable, really. Oh, by the way the majority of this traffic increase now drives right past Graham
& Parks elementary school!
The street was a route that was walked by many (Elizabeth Warren included), where our children played. No
longer. We will continue to seek recourse with the city. This was not only completely predictable but also avoidable.

Re: Follow-Up on Garden Street Conversion

Thank you, Joe.
From our vantage point (2 Walker) we can see cars & trucks entering Walker Street, but lose sight of them pretty
quickly.
It is good to have a record of what goes on at the corner, particularly when they are traveling so fast.

Re: Cambridge Traffic/Bike Lanes/Garden St Re-Alignment

Dear City Council:
I am a resident of Linnaean St and agree with Larry Cetrulo about the congestion on all of the residential streets now
that Garden St has been made one way. Here are my concerns:
1—While walking today on Holly Street I agree that it is no longer safe to even step off the sidewalk. It used to be a
street for walkers, residents and a few bikes. Now only cars
2—While crossing garden street on my walk, I have been nearly hit by bicyclists. I have not felt unsafe from cars because
they stop at crosswalks for the most part. On the other hand bicycles rarely stop for pedestrians and it is all the more
dangerous because they ride right next to the curb. Cars do not!
3--I do not mean to privilege cars, but drivers tend to be more careful than scooters or bicyclists.
I choose to privilege people who walk to get around Cambridge, and you have not in any way taken us into account in
your decision making.
Please think of the large part of the population you serve and rescind this poorly taken decision.
Respectfully,
Ellen Blumenthal

3. Did any one consider what were the likely consequences of rerouting traffic in a residential

Brattle St. protected bike lanes

Dear all,
Thank you for implementing the Garden St. lanes and the upcoming protected bike lanes on River St. and
Hampshire St.
I'm concerned about the delay in the Brattle St. protected bike lane project due to supply issues. I suggest that the
city proceeds with temporary barriers like cones, etc. This makes a significant difference when commuting by bike,
especially as it gets darker and colder this time of year. For example, the temporary cones marking the bike lane on
the Mass Ave bridge ahead of permanent installation make me feel much safer when biking across. This has
dramatically slowed vehicle speeds, so they usually go the speed limit.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Petit

proposed delay in bike lane implementation

City Council,
It has come to my attention that the City proposes to delay initial generation of bike lanes on Brattle Street until
Spring 2023, and this delay, at least in part, was caused by a failure to put out for bid supplies for 7 weeks after the
Aug 8 public meeting. This is disappointing and unacceptable. In the future, the City must demonstrate better
planning. Temporary cones, barrels, or other barriers should be erected on the relevant portions of Brattle St. and
done right away. Doing so, especially before Winter when slippery conditions make commuting less safe for drivers
and cyclists, will almost certainly prevent more traffic injuries and deaths.
Thanks for your consideration,
Ben Fox

Garden St

Dear City Councilors and City Manager,
I am extremely disappointed in your decision to allow Garden St to be converted to one-way despite the CSA petition
appealing the Traffic Director’s decision. According to the law, all work should be suspended until the Traffic Board hears
the appeal and reaches a decision. The statement from the City Manager that the TAB would take up the petitions after
the work of conversion has been done defies common sense and flouts the clear intent of that regulation.
It is unclear how the city could reach the decision to proceed in clear violation of its own laws. That said, your actions
are consistent with previous actions that ignore the needs and will of ordinary Cambridge citizens and small businesses.
I experienced first hand the results of your actions when I became embroiled in a traffic jam from Concord to Huron and
beyond because of the closure of Garden westbound. This jam lasted for two hours at least as I encountered it on my
return eastbound and saw the continuous crawling of traffic westbound in the dark. You might want to know that your
largesse to cyclists with respect to Garden St was not appreciated by all as I saw several cyclists weaving in and out of
stalled traffic westbound on Huron. (Guess they didn’t get the memo. )
One other issue that I would like to address is that I have heard from some of you that residents wanted the one way
Garden configuration. Such statements are truly disingenuous . There was NO real choice. It was one way and no
parking or two ways and no parking. That’s not a choice. That is autocratic decision making.
I am very disaffected by your actions and disappointed by a number of you personally. There are some of you who I
regard as friends. I have supported you and voted for you in the past. That will no longer be the case going forward.
You ignored petitions from almost 200 voters to inflict your ideological purity on ordinary folks who are not in the tank
with your cyclists’ lobby. And that is just untenable. Cambridge is not your fiefdom.
I do plan to actively work against you come next election. We may not succeed right away but I think that
notwithstanding our voting system, you can be voted out. Between your bike lane mania and the BEUDO 2035 - so you
can be first in the nation - ordinance - you would destroy Cambridge for the great middle class which every city needs to
survive.
And I am so disappointed in the new manager. Not off to good start. I would think someone with a sophisticated
background in healthcare policy would be smart enough to see through a rigged decision making apparatus .

Brattle St project delay

Hello,
Thanks to all of the great work the city has been doing recently on bike lane installation, and I'm excited for the new
work being planned on Hampshire St, which I commute through daily.
I've recently learned that the Brattle St. project is expected to be delayed due to issues delivering materials. While this
delay is unfortunate, I encourage the city to move ahead with street marking and installing temporary safety barriers in
the meantime. Especially with the days getting shorter, even these temporary measures could make a huge difference
for the safety of residents.
Best,
Adam S

Please support the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I write as a longtime (27-year) Cambridge resident and member of the medical-scientific community, in strong support
of the Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment.
Cambridge is blessed to have so many institutions where science is explored and used for the public benefit. In addition
to their direct contribution, commercial laboratories are a source of revenue for the city, and help fund critical
amenities.
But allowing unchecked expansion of laboratory space in order to support the municipal tax base risks destroying our
community in order to save it. In an unregulated real estate market, highly-profitable biotech labs crowd out other civic
economies; neighborhoods dominated by them are transformed from living communities to generic office parks as
residents and small businesses flee to more affordable locations.
The proposed ordinance is carefully crafted to exempt laboratories used mainly for health and educational services, and
to limit disruption of this city's important laboratory sector while preserving our local spaces.
After the financial crisis of 2008, the old joke that Harvard is a hedge fund moonlighting as a university got a lot of play.
We must not let Cambridge become a laboratory services company moonlighting as a city. The social fabric of our
community has to be protected, or we will lose it. Please support the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
Respectfully,
Aaron Shakow

Brattle Street Bike Lanes

Hello,
Thank you for your work installing protected bike lanes on Garden Street and the upcoming protected lane projects on
River and Hampshire Streets. I am writing today because I heard that due to supplies constraints the implementation of
the Brattle St. protected lane project may be delayed to the spring. This is a dangerous decision and one that can be
easily rectified.
I use my bike for transpiration year-round. I find winter to be the most dangerous time to bike. When it snows, snow
piles up next to the curb, pushing out parked vehicles and narrowing the roadway. This leaves little to no space for a
driver to pass me when I am riding my bike on a busy street such as Brattle and leads to close passes that have a high
potential for crashes. With protected bike lanes, however, I have a clear and safe path (when plowed, which generally
Cambridge is quite good at!).
I understand that supplies constraints mean you are unable to install the project as designed this fall. However, if you
are able to stripe the road and separate the bike facilities with cones, it will be a large improvement and provide a safe
facility through the winter. The bike lanes on the Mass Ave bridge have been protected using cones for a year and have
worked great.
I look forward to seeing this project implemented with cones this fall, and then fully to the design next spring.
Best,
Aaron

Unsafe pedestrian conditions on Walker Street due to City's changes to Garden Street

Dear City Manager and City Council members,
As a 20-year resident of Walker Street, I am writing to state agreement with the numerous concerns you have heard
from other Walker Street residents, regarding the unsafe pedestrian conditions caused by the City’s recent changes to
Garden Street.
The evidence shows how the City’s traffic changes have caused a significant increase in cut-through traffic on Walker
Street:
• A dramatic and observed increase in traffic volumes to approximately 1.5 vehicles / minute.
• Much faster and unsafe speeds of travel by cut-through vehicles.
• Travel by school buses and trucks that cannot safely make the 90 degree turn in the street.
• Unsafe conditions at the turn from Garden Street into Walker Street.
Before the City made these changes, Walker Street was a safe pedestrian environment, where walkers and bicyclists
coexisted with a limited number of local-access cars and trucks, moving at safe speeds.
It is unfortunate that the City’s well-intentioned but flawed attempt to improve bicycle travel on Garden Street have
caused these negative impacts to walking – an equally important and environmentally sustainable way to get around the
city. Not everyone can ride a bicycle – but everyone can walk, including children, the elderly, and the disabled. By
creating an unsafe pedestrian environment on Walker Street, the City has violated its own policies of providing safe,
healthy, sustainable, and equitable movement for all citizens throughout the city
To remedy these problems, the City must quickly develop and implement, through a process of public review and
comment, a detailed and effective set of changes that will ensure pedestrian safety on and around Walker Street, and
restore the street to the safe and sustainable environment that it once was.

WHEREAS:

It has come to the City Council’s attention that the Harvard Union of Clerical and
Technical Workers, whose contract with Harvard University expired on September 30,
has been engaged in contract negotiations with the university since that time, and
concerns have been raised that the salary ranges being offered by Harvard do not meet
the current cost of living demands; and

WHEREAS:

Representatives for the HUCTW, which represents approximately 5,000 Harvard
employees, have reported that these negotiations have been productive on a number of
fronts, but the two sides have yet to reach an agreement around appropriate wage
increases, with the union correctly noting that their members are feeling financially
squeezed in a time of rising rents, rising costs of food and fuel, increased inflation, and
the threat of a recession looming; and

WHEREAS:

Representatives of the HUCTW have noted that Harvard University has not given any
clear rationale as to why an institution with an endowment worth $53,200,000,000 is
unwilling or unable to provide the adequate cost-of-living adjustments to the salary
ranges being asked for by the union; and

WHEREAS:

The clerical and technical workers give their all to Harvard University on a daily basis,
they are part of the institution’s very backbone, and during these especially challenging
times, it is incumbent upon Harvard University to meet the moment and find a way to
bring some badly needed financial piece of mind to the HUCTW union members going
forward; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council formally go on record in urging Harvard University to meet the
salary demands being made by the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers
in their ongoing contract negotiations; and be it further

fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable mobility for all.
The Vision Zero approach consists first and foremost of an acknowledgment that
crashes are preventable. By examining the factors that cause crashes, from
infrastructure to behavior and societal factors, we can make the changes necessary to
eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Vision Zero also acknowledges that
human beings will always make mistakes, so we must have systems in place to ensure

The City of Cambridge has recently moved to implement a remote work schedule, and
the need for a monthly subsidized pass may have shifted to a less regular model for

WHEREAS:

A robust, affordable, and effective public transportation system provides essential
services to residents and directly helps the city achieve goals of reducing emission
pollution and increasing equity and economic prosperity; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) proposed the second
iteration of their plans for a bus network redesign on account of shifting demographics,
emerging employment districts, increasing traffic congestion, and changing travel
patterns within the Greater Boston Area in recent years; and

WHEREAS:

These changes will impact routes that operate within the City of Cambridge, as was
discussed during a recent Transportation and Public Utilities Committee hearing and
the City Council has gone on record in support of more bus service in the Alewife
region as well as in East Cambridge not included in the first bus network redesign; and

WHEREAS:

The MBTA revised their original proposal based on over 20,000 comments in order to
improve access to hospitals, senior centers, and other destinations; reduce walk
distances for riders; preserve existing one-seat rides; and balance resources and stays
within the limit of buses available during peak times; and

WHEREAS:

The October redesign has made several improvements to bus access in Cambridge,
including extending Route T47 to Union Square from its original terminus in Central
Square and reinstating Route 87 near Lechmere, extending service to 1:00am; and
working to address high frequency routes across the system; and

WHEREAS:

While the October redesign has addressed many of the issues brought forward by the
community, many notable concerns still exist, namely:
• Routes 68 and 78 should extend rush hour schedules from 3:00pm - 8:00pm to
better serve students in afterschool activities;
• Route 78 provides access to Neighborhood Nine, Cambridge Highlands,
Concord Ave between Huron and Blanchard Rd, including the assisted care
and medical facilities; it is also the only connector between West Cambridge
and Arlington: reduced midday service is a concern, though, we believe that
weekend service is improved;
• The MBTA is proposing very little change to the schedules of;
• Routes 69 and 83; the MBTA should improve the frequencies of both routes
to account for rush hour needs of the population including vulnerable
populations;
These routes should be reconsidered to better account for the needs of Cambridge; and

Packet Pg. 265

5.7

WHEREAS:

Changes in routes west of Harvard Square, including #74 and #75 need to be assessed
carefully in light of new housing units including affordable housing for many residents
without cars who rely on public transportation more than others
•

As of right now, the MBTA has restored service on Route 74 from Belmont
Center to Harvard via Concord Ave and is also proposing Sunday service on
Route 74;

•

There have been no changes to Route 75 in the newest proposal which is
essential for many CRLS students; and

WHEREAS:

The dedicated CRLS bus on Routes 72 and 75 on school mornings provides essential
transportation services for high school students to get to school on time and should be
reinstated and additional dedicated CRLS routes considered for other areas of the city;
and

WHEREAS:

The City Council expects the MBTA to respond to items from the joint letter from the
Mayor and City Manager including:
•

Route 68 to continue to have all-day service

•

Extend Route 68 to Lechmere or connect the 68 to a new Kendall-Chelsea
service

•

Extend the T109 into Allston to connect with the Harvard development; and

WHEREAS:

Without further changes to address these concerns, the plan could have an adverse
impact on the city’s goals of increasing public transit overall to reduced emission
pollution, and on residents who rely on public transit and who cannot afford vehicles,
including senior citizens and other residents of limited mobility, students who rely on
public transportation for school and afterschool activities, and many public housing
residents who will be further isolated if public transit options are reduced, instead of
increased; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record in support of the changes that improved access and
in support of further changes to address the concerns of residents as summarized
above; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Council hereby requests that the City Manager reach out to the MBTA to
discuss the need for further amendments to the proposed plan for bus routes and to
strategize on how the MBTA can keep their promised 25% increase in service and
double the number of high frequency corridors considering the challenges they face
hiring new drivers; and be it further

Attachment: #7 Original Order #2022_288 (POR 2022 #288 : Revised MBTA Bus Redesign)

City of Cambridge

Packet Pg. 268

WHEREAS:

While the October redesign has addressed many of the issues brought forward by the
community, many notable concerns still exist, namely:
• Routes 68 and 78 should extend rush hour schedules from 3:00pm - 8:00pm to
better serve students in afterschool activities;
• The cuts to Route 78 also reduce access to Neighborhood Nine, Cambridge
Highlands, Concord Ave between Huron and Blanchard Rd, including the
assisted care and medical facilities; it is also the only connector between West
Cambridge and Arlington;
• The frequency of Routes 69 and 83 are being cut drastically; the frequencies of
both Routes should be increased to account for rush hour needs of the
population including vulnerable populations;
• Changes in routes west of Harvard Square, including #74 and #75 need to be
assessed carefully in light of new housing units including affordable housing
for many residents without cars who rely on public transportation more than
others
o As of right now, the MBTA has restored service on Route 74 from
Belmont Center to Harvard via Concord Ave;
o There have been no changes to Route 75 in the newest proposal which
is essential for many CRLS students;
These routes should be reconsidered to better account for the needs of Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

The dedicated CRLS Route 75 bus on school mornings provides essential
transportation services for high school students to get to school on time and should be
reinstated and additional dedicated CRLS routes considered for other areas of the city;
and

WHEREAS:

Without further changes to address these concerns, the plan could have an adverse
impact on the city’s goals of increasing public transit overall to reduced emission
pollution, and on residents who rely on public transit and who cannot afford vehicles,
including senior citizens and other residents of limited mobility, students who rely on
public transportation for school and afterschool activities, and many public housing
residents who will be further isolated if public transit options are reduced, instead of
increased; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record in support of the changes that improved access and
in support of further changes to address the concerns of residents as summarized
above; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Council hereby requests that the City Manager reach out to the MBTA to
discuss the need for further amendments to the proposed plan for bus routes and to
strategize on how the MBTA can keep their promised 25% increase in service and
double the number of high frequency corridors considering the challenges they face
hiring new drivers; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of
this resolution to representatives at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
(MBTA) and to the Cambridge state delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.

Dear Colleagues,
As many of you are already aware, Cambridge Community Electricity (CCE) is the City’s electricity
supply program that offers renewable electricity at stable prices. This year, many homes who are not
already enrolled in the CCE will see an increase in their electricity bills, and those who are struggling to
make ends meet already will have to make the difficult decision between heating and eating all winter
long.
By switching to Cambridge Community Electricity, Cambridge homes and businesses have the
opportunity to save not only this winter, but through January 2024, as rates are locked in for the next year.
Cambridge recently announced that our CCE offers the lowest electricity prices in Massachusetts. These
low rates apply to both the basic green and 100% renewable options. Since the program began in 2017,
the more than 41,000 residents and businesses who have switched have collectively saved over $22
million dollars on their electricity bills. This September, new solar panels were installed on the roof of the
Graham & Parks School with some of the funds from CCE.
Residents can confirm their enrollment in the City’s program by checking the first page of their
Eversource electric bill for “Your electric supplier is CAMBRIDGE COMM ELEC DIRECT ENERGY.”
Residents who are not currently enrolled in CCE and are interested in switching, they can enroll online
using the City’s online form on masspowerchoice.com or they can call 844-379-9934. I urge my
colleagues to communicate through your various channels to residents about this lower cost electricity
program before the cold weather hits. Please also advise residents to beware of scams pretending to be
Eversource or other providers offering lower rates by circulating the attached poster from Megan Shaw of
the Cambridge Energy Alliance. These people/groups are not affiliated with Eversource or the City of
Cambridge. In your communications, please remind residents that an Eversource employee will never
call them or knock on their door to discuss their electric bill. Residents can also use the resources
through All In Energy, a third-party company that has partnered with the City, to check their energy bills
and search for lower cost options. They can also call 617-430-6230.
Colleagues, I encourage you to share these links, graphics, and resources with your networks. Keeping
energy costs low for all of our residents this winter, as well as ensuring they are aware of energy scams, is
going to be critical and will require all of our help in spreading the word.

Cambridge Community Electricity (CCE) is a City-run program that provides a Cambridge residents and business with an alternative to
Eversource’s Basic Service for electricity supply. CCE rates are fixed through January 2024, Eversource rates change every six months.
Through December 2022 CCE rates for 100% renewable electricity are lower than Eversource Basic Service. Updated energy mix
information is now available for the Cambridge Community Electricity program. This document shows how the electricity was generated and
provides detail on how much of that energy comes from renewable vs non-renewable sources.
Over 33,000 households and 4,950 businesses participate in the CCE program. CCE customers have saved over $15M since the start of the
program in 2017. Most participants receive the default product, Standard Green, which meets minimum Massachusetts renewable energy
requirements and includes a small fee which funds new local solar projects. Currently 1,200 customers have opted up to the even greener
product, 100% Green Plus, which provides electricity from 100% renewable sources in New England with Class I Renewable Energy
Certificates and contributes to new local solar projects in Cambridge.
All new electricity accounts are automatically enrolled in CCE. Eversource continues to deliver electricity, manage accounts and billing, and
provide customer service.
It takes just a few minutes to opt up to 100% Green Plus on the program website: masspowerchoice.com/cambridge. There, you can also learn
more about where the program gets its renewable energy, pricing, and receive customer support. Customers can change between the two
levels of the program at any time without penalty. Customers who have opted out of the program may also opt back into the program at any
time. Please note that future savings cannot be guaranteed.
There are many companies offering renewable electricity. CCE is the only official City of Cambridge electricity program directly supporting
new renewable energy in New England. There are no fees or contracts associated with the program and customers may opt out at any time.
While you may receive other electricity offers in the mail or even from door-to-door vendors, the City recommends consumers be very careful
in evaluating electricity offers from other companies. Many companies offer low introductory rates that then reset to much higher prices or
have long multi-year contracts that are difficult to cancel. Protect your utility account number like a credit card and do not sign up for any
electricity offers without thoroughly reading the contract.
For more information or questions about your energy bill, visit masspowerchoice.com/Cambridge or Cambridge Energy Helpline at 617- 4306230.

Communicating Information from the School Committee

On Tuesday, October 27th, 2022, the School Committee held a retreat to discuss target settings
within the district plan. On Tuesday, November 1st, 2022, the School Committee held a regular
meeting with two presentations. The first presentation was about the superintendent evaluation
goals and another from the human resources team regarding strategies for retention and
recruitment for educators and the educator pathway programs.
Following the regular meeting, there was a special meeting on Tuesday, November 1st, 2022, to
approve the contract for Dr. Victoria Greer as superintendent of schools.
This week, I visited the third graders at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. School to talk about the
significance of World Children’s Day with several fun activities about civic engagement.
Students came up with ideas about how to make Cambridge a better community and left a
handprint on a banner that will be on display at City Hall lawn from November 14th - November
20th. We will share a press release regarding the student ideas next week.
i-Ready Personalized Instruction launches on Monday, November 14 for all 3rd through 8th
grade students. This is an online program for students to practice and build their reading and
math skills beyond the school day. Customized lessons are provided to improve and accelerate
reading and math skills, whether students are performing below, on, or above grade level.
The JK/K Lottery for the 2023-2024 school year will open on January 3, 2023, and close on
January 31, 2023. All registrations must be fully completed, including all language testing to
determine eligibility for Program Language Bonus points. Please consider attending an

information session to learn more about the process. Register for the session on Wednesday,
November 9 from 6:00-7:00PM and Wednesday, November 16 from 6:00-7:00PM.
Since 1967, the National Career Development Association (NCDA) has highlighted and
promoted National Career Development Month in an effort to improve and elevate the value of
career development at all stages. For the first time, CPS, led by Cambridge Rindge and Latin
School, is celebrating the month with a series of events dedicated to career development. Check
out the programs here!
Haggerty’s 4th graders recently took an engaging field trip to the Harvard Museum of Natural
History and participated in the Changing Earth program. They learned how rocks, fossils, and
landforms provide clues about the geologic history of our changing earth. They explored
exhibits, such as ocean specimens and animals from around the world!
The Morse School held its annual school-wide fun run/walk earlier this month at beautiful
Magazine Beach Park. It was an amazing turnout of families stopping by to cheer on runners.
The event is aimed at promoting fitness and community. It also helps to raise funds for the
Friends of Morse, a parent-led organization that supports enriching learning experiences for our
students, along with other important volunteer contributions to our school.
The next regular School Committee meeting is on Tuesday, November 15th, 2022, at 6:00pm.
Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui
In City Council November 7, 2022.
