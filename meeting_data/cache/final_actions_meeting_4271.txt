Please find attached the final report of the Cambridge Climate Resilience Zoning
Task Force. The Task Force was formed in 2019 to bring together diverse
stakeholders to identify development standards that would increase the capacity of
development in Cambridge to withstand and adapt to impacts from climate
change. Task Force members included residents from neighborhoods throughout
the city, a union/trades representative, representatives from academic institutions,
affordable housing builders, small business representatives, property owners,
subject matter experts, and City staff.
Over the course of 19 meetings, the Task Force learned about the climate change
vulnerabilities identified in the Cambridge Climate Vulnerability Assessment
(CCVA), and reviewed recommendations from the Resilient Cambridge Plan and
the Urban Forest Master Plan (UFMP). The Task Force then identified a set of
principles and objectives, which guided the development of their
recommendations.

The final recommendations of the Task Force are included in this report and were
developed based on a consensus approach. Overall, these recommendations aim to
do the following:
• Codify flood risk standards in zoning based on future projections, not past
experience.
• Create new zoning standards for heat resilience that have flexibility and
choice built in.
• Remove zoning obstacles that would allow property owners to make their
property more resilient.
• Promote a holistic approach to reviewing the sustainability and resilience
of major new development.
• Ensure that buildings being built today are resilient throughout their
lifetime.

City staff have begun working to develop zoning text based on these
recommendations. Through this process, staff will have to evaluate how to
incorporate those recommendations within the parameters of what can be legally
regulated through zoning. In instances where the final zoning standards look
different from the initial recommendations, they will still meet the Principles and
Objectives identified by the Task Force. Since amending the Zoning Ordinance
requires the Planning Board and the City Council’s Ordinance Committee to hold
public hearings, there will be many opportunities for continued public comment
and involvement. City staff also intends to provide opportunities for the Task
Force to provide input when the zoning text is drafted.

Executive Summary
The Task Force’s robust learning and deliberation
process was guided by a set of principles and
objectives that identified shared values across
the diverse perspectives among the group. Task
Force members recognized that some of the most
effective strategies to promote climate adaptation
and mitigation would not be implemented through
zoning. Zoning is but one of many tools in the City’s
climate resilience toolkit.

Over the course of approximately 19 meetings,
the members of the Climate Resilience Zoning
Task Force (“Task Force”) discussed how to
revise Cambridge’s development standards
to strengthen the climate resilience of the
City’s built environment. The Task Force brought
together stakeholders from across the Cambridge
community to reach consensus on an effective
approach to regulating urban development in a
way that mitigates the identified impacts and
risks of on-going climate change. Specifically, the
Task Force was charged with discussing climate
change vulnerabilities identified in the Cambridge
Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA), reviewing
recommendations from the ongoing Climate
Change Preparedness and Resilience (CCPR)
planning effort and other related initiatives,
and recommending development standards to
incorporate into Cambridge’s Zoning Ordinance.

Role of the Task Force
The City Manager appointed 20 members to the
Task Force to ensure that a diversity of perspectives
would be included in the discussions. The Task
Force included residents from neighborhoods
throughout the city, a union/trades representative,
representatives from academic institutions,
affordable housing builders, small business
representatives, property owners, subject matter
experts, and City staff. By bringing together
stakeholders from across the Cambridge
community, the vision was that the Task Force
would reach consensus around an effective
approach to regulating urban development in a way
that would mitigate the identified impacts and risks
of on-going climate change.

The Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force (CRZTF)
was created to bring together diverse stakeholders
to identify development standards that would
increase the capacity of development in Cambridge
to withstand and adapt to impacts from climate
change. The Climate Change Vulnerability
Assessment (CCVA) and ongoing Climate Change
Preparedness and Resilience (CCPR) planning
has been underway since 2012, and the Envision
Cambridge comprehensive planning process (2019)
began combining the City’s multidisciplinary work
on climate change with a vision for the future
growth and development of Cambridge. The
Douglas Brown, et al. Zoning Petition (2017) also
demonstrated citizens’ interest in this important
issue. The City Council issued a Policy Order
requesting the formation of an advisory committee
to work through resiliency elements raised during
the Envision process and through the Brown
petition.

Introduction

b

The goal of the Task Force was to recommend
zoning amendments that could be translated
into a formal zoning petition by City staff and be
presented to the City Council for consideration
and adoption. The Task Force considered all types
of development and all parts of the city. The final
zoning recommendations are citywide in scope and
would create standards for all new development,
large and small, and specific types of additions
and alterations to existing buildings and uses. The
Task Force also considered both prescriptive- and
performance-based approaches to creating new
zoning standards, ultimately gravitating toward
performance-based standards. The Task Force also
provided recommendations for actions that the
City could pursue separately in the future.

Task Force members were supported by staff in the
Community Development Department (specializing
in Zoning and Development and Environmental
Planning) and Department of Public Works, and by
consultants who were also involved in the CCVA,
CCPR, and Urban Forest Master Plan.
The purpose of the Task Force was to discuss the
specific climate change vulnerabilities identified
in the CCVA, review recommendations from the
ongoing CCPR planning effort and other related
initiatives including the Urban Forest Master
Plan, and recommend development standards to
incorporate into Cambridge’s Zoning Ordinance.
The Task Force focused on two specific impacts of
climate change: flooding from sea level rise, storm
surge, and precipitation, and rising temperatures
exacerbated by the urban heat island effect.

Introduction

Process &
Work Plan
The Task Force met 19 times between
January 2019 and March 2021. All meetings
were open to the public and a website with
information about the Task Force was actively
maintained to ensure transparency. The City
Council, through its Health and Environment
Committee, had an active and ongoing role in
shaping the work of the Task Force. Throughout
the course of its discussions, the Task Force
held two joint meetings with the Committee
to provide updates on its progress and solicit
feedback.
Note that meetings were suspended between
March and October 2020, due to City policy
on non-essential public meetings during the
COVID-19 State of Emergency.

Background
Information
& Resources
After establishing its work plan and
ground rules, the Task Force spent the
first phase of its process reviewing and
discussing information relevant to its
work. These included City-led climate
change initiatives, other planning studies,
and community-based initiatives.
Members also learned about what
can and can’t be effectively regulated
through zoning and the types of zoning
strategies used in Cambridge. This phase
included a tour of the Alewife area to see
in-person examples of older and more
recent development and to identify and
discuss resilience issues in the context of
buildings and sites.

City’s Climate Planning Initiatives
Since it joined ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability in 1999, Cambridge has taken an active role in
both preparing for climate change and reducing its causes. The following recent planning efforts were the
most relevant to the Task Force’s work:
• Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA):
Completed in 2017, this technical study explored
Cambridge’s physical and social vulnerabilities to
increasing temperatures, more intense storms,
and storm surge flooding associated with sea
level rise. Part 1 of the CCVA Report focused on
risks posed by ever-increasing temperatures and
precipitation while Part 2 focused on risks from
rising sea levels and coastal storm surges.
The CCVA serves as the technical foundation
for the City’s other climate-related work, and
its findings will be updated over time as climate
change models evolve.

City’s Climate Planning Initiatives

• Resilient Cambridge Plan (formerly Climate
Change Preparedness and Resilience
Plan [CCPR]): This ongoing initiative is
a roadmap for the City government, its
residents, businesses, institutions, and key
stakeholders to implement strategies in
response to climate change threats. The
City completed two area-specific CCPR
plans, one with a focus on the Alewife area
and the other on The Port neighborhood.
These area-specific studies informed
the citywide Resilient Cambridge Plan,
which was released in June 2021. The
plan consists of the main document, a
handbook of strategies, and six technical
memos to support the plan in addition
to a summary report titled Resilient City
Resilient People. The Task Force shared the
same team of consultants and City staff
with the Resilient Cambridge Plan, which
ensured that both initiatives worked in
tandem.

• Net Zero Action Plan: Completed in 2015, this
plan sets a road map for neutralizing greenhouse
gas emissions from Cambridge. While the CCVA
and CCPR focus on how to prepare the city for
impacts from climate change, the Net Zero Action
Plan focuses on reducing the city’s contribution
to the climate crisis. Some recommendations
from this initiative have already been adopted
into the Zoning Ordinance. The City is currently
conducting a comprehensive 5-Year Review of the
Plan in order to evaluate the program’s impact
to date, consider options to adjust the Net Zero
Action Plan framework, and adopt an updated
framework that reflects current climate science,
policy, technology, and equity considerations.

Other City-Led Planning Initiatives
In addition to its climate-specific planning efforts, other recent studies have addressed the need to
understand and respond to a changing climate:
• Envision Cambridge: Completed in 2019,
the City’s most recent citywide, long-range
comprehensive planning study sets broad goals
and recommendations on the topics of climate
and the environment, community wellbeing, the
economy, mobility, housing, and urban form.
In addition to the citywide plan, the Envision
planning process also produced the Alewife
District Plan in 2019, which focused on an area
that is especially vulnerable to flooding and heat
and suggested some ways to incorporate climate
resilience into urban design.

Packet Pg. 18

b

• Urban Forest Master Plan: From 2018 to 2020, the
Department of Public Works led a task force that
focused on creating a strategic plan to evaluate,
maintain and expand the urban forest canopy in
Cambridge. The work is particularly relevant to the Task
Force because trees contribute to climate resilience by
reducing the urban heat island effect and mitigating
stormwater runoff. The Cambridge Urban Forest Master
Plan Technical Report was released in November
2019 and the City of Cambridge Urban Forest
Report: Healthy Forest, Healthy City was published in
September 2020. The lead consultant for the Urban
Forest Master Plan also advised the Climate Resilience
Zoning Task Force and one representative serves on
the task forces for both initiatives. The Healthy Forest,
Healthy City initiative has been formally launched.

• Ten Year Sewer and Drain Infrastructure Plan: The
City has developed a strategic plan to manage the
infrastructure improvements of the sewer and storm
water mains, manholes, catch basins, pumping stations
and Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) outfalls that
carry waste and storm water to treatment plants
and discharge locations. This 10-year plan, published
in 2019, serves as a guidance document to prioritize
construction and rehabilitation of these complex
systems. The goals of the Plan include addressing highrisk infrastructure conditions, managing stormwater
quality and quantity, reducing flooding, and protecting
neighborhoods. These various planning initiatives work
together to maximize co-benefits to Cantabrigians.

Background Information and Resources

Douglas Brown, et al., Zoning Petition
In 2017, a group of residents (including Task Force members Doug Brown and Mike
Nakagawa) proposed a zoning amendment informed in part by the CCVA work. The
amendment would have expanded the current Flood Plain Overlay District to include
areas projected to be vulnerable to future flooding. All development or site work
in that district would be subject to new requirements outlined in the petition, in
addition to the existing requirements. The petition also proposed a “Green Factor”
scoring system for all development subject to the Project Review Special Permit
requirements.
There was broad agreement on the goals of this petition, which sought to use
development standards in the Zoning Ordinance to build a more resilient Cambridge.
While there were concerns raised about how to ensure effective implementation of
some of the proposed standards, the performance-based approach of the proposed
Green Factor was positively received by City staff, the Planning Board, and the City
Council, with suggestions for further study and testing.
This petition catalyzed support for the creation of a multi-stakeholder task force to
study potential zoning standards that would complement the City’s suite of climate
resilience initiatives. As a result, the City Manager created the Climate Resilience
Zoning Task Force.

Overall Climate Impacts and Climate Planning
The CCVA used global climate model simulations to
generate temperature, humidity, precipitation, and
sea level rise projections specifically for the city. The
scenarios were developed between 2013-2017 using
the best available science with the understanding
that assumptions, methodologies, and resultant
projections will need to be revised over time in
light of new data or technologies, or changes in
the environment itself. The CCVA projections are
not intended to be a precise prediction of future
conditions but are more of a “climate stress test” to
understand how people and the built environment
would be impacted by these changes.

Drawing on the findings of the CCVA, the Resilient
Cambridge Plan focuses on both reducing risks
and preparing for unavoidable risks. It takes a
multipronged but coordinated approach that
focuses on performance. As a result, the Resilient
Cambridge Plan project team identified four
key categories of resilience strategies: closer
neighborhoods, better buildings, stronger
infrastructure, and a greener city.

The CCVA developed projections for two planning
horizons, 2030 and 2070, and two categories of
impacts, heat and flooding. City staff recommended
that the Task Force focus on 2070 projections since
buildings constructed today are expected to have at
least a 50-year lifespan.

The Task Force focused exclusively on zoning mechanisms to complement other actions recommended in the
Resilient Cambridge Plan. Task Force members recognized that zoning could help the City achieve its goals
but cannot resolve every issue identified in the Resilient Cambridge Plan.

Overall Climate Impacts and Climate Planning

Flooding | Climate Projections, Risks, and Outcomes
The Task Force reviewed key impacts associated with the two main kinds of flooding that Cambridge faces:
precipitation-driven flooding and flooding from a combination of sea level rise and storm surge (SLR/SS).
Overall, the CCVA found that, due to climate change, Cambridge will face increasing rates of precipitation and
a greater frequency of larger storms.
Precipitation

type of flooding is mostly short-term in nature, and
generally does not last for more than a day.

Currently, flooding in Cambridge is
driven by precipitation, which causes
streets to fill with water when
drainage infrastructure is unable to
immediately discharge floodwaters.
According to CCVA projections,
precipitation-driven flooding in
Cambridge will become more
frequent, cover broader areas of the
city (including areas where it has not
frequently occurred in the past), and
have a greater depth. However, this

Projected Increases in Precipitation Volume and Frequency
Not only will the rates of precipitation increase, but the frequency of
storms will as well. (Source: Resilient Cambridge Plan, July 2021)

year flood”), and the timeframe of the projection
(2030 or 2070). While these probabilities appear low,
the risk over time is significant. For instance, a 10%
annual probability event has a 96% probability of
occurring within a 30-year period, and a 1% annual
probability event has a 26% probability of occurring
within a 30-year period, meaning that there is
approximately a one in four chance. This type of
saltwater flooding could last for more than a day and
could impact buildings differently than freshwater
flooding from precipitation.

Flooding caused by rising ocean levels, both longterm sea level rise and water surges during storm
events, does not currently impact Cambridge
because it is protected by the Amelia Earhart Dam
and the Charles River Dam. CCVA projections show
that this regional infrastructure will likely protect
Cambridge through 2030; however, projected 2070
SLR/SS levels have the potential to overtop the
Amelia Earhart Dam if it is not adapted to meet
future conditions, which would result in storm surges
affecting the Alewife-Fresh Pond area. This type of
saltwater flooding could last for more than a day and
could impact buildings differently than freshwater
flooding from precipitation.

To communicate the CCVA flooding projections in a useful way, the City created an online, interactive
tool called the FloodViewer where users can select land parcels on a map and view all projected flooding
elevations.

The Cambridge FloodViewer 2.1 identifies the flood
elevations for 10-year and 100-year storms for every
parcel in Cambridge. The elevations include flooding
from both precipitation and sea level rise/storm surge.

Selecting individual parcels shows detailed

Flooding | Climate Projections, Risks, and Outcomes

Flooding | Flooding Impacts
Based on the findings of the CCVA, increased flooding will impact buildings and sites (such as houses, office
buildings, and parks); infrastructure (such as roads, electricity, and water and stormwater systems); and
critical services facilities (such as hospitals, fire stations, and community centers). The Task Force focused
most of its discussion on how zoning standards can mitigate these risks, including the following:
• Structural damage to buildings, property, transit
systems, and utilities requiring remediation or
replacement.

• Economic disruption due to business closures
and property needing to be replaced. These
disruptions could disproportionately impact small
businesses without the financial resources to
withstand sudden losses.

• Disruption to the habitability of the housing
stock, since flooding can result in public health
and safety concerns due to mold, contamination,
and other consequences. These impacts can
be more severe in basement-level living spaces,
which can be more difficult to keep dry after a
flooding event. The risks can also be more severe
for lower-income households with fewer housing
options and less ability to repair or replace
damaged property.

• Social disruption caused by damage to
community resources such as public schools,
daycare and youth centers, pharmacies, food
pantries, social service centers, and municipal
resources that are relied upon by vulnerable
populations. These disruptions would significantly
impact personal health and safety.

Flooding | Adaptation Strategies
While Cambridge cannot reduce its flood risk through City-led actions alone, changing how the City regulates
development will improve citywide resilience. The Resilient Cambridge Plan promotes a set of adaptation
strategies along these lines, including the following:
• Design new buildings using 2070 flood
projections, given that buildings are likely to last
for 50+ years.

• Design usable spaces in a building that are below
the 1% probability flood elevation to experience
flooding but recover from any impacts (i.e. “wet
floodproof”).

• Design usable spaces in a building that are below
the 10% probability flood elevation to prevent
flooding (i.e. “dry floodproof”).

• Elevate critical utilities, such as electrical boxes
and shut-offs, above the 1% probability flood
elevation where possible or protect them if below
that elevation.

• Design auxiliary uses in a building that are below
the 10% probability flood elevation to experience
flooding but recover from any impacts (i.e. “wet
floodproof”).

City staff have already begun to incorporate CCVA projections and some of the above-mentioned Resilient
Cambridge Plan strategies into its review of development proposals. For example, applicants for special
permits from the Planning Board are asked to study and mitigate future flood risks based on CCVA
projections identified in the FloodViewer. Outside of zoning, the Department of Public Works (DPW), which
is responsible for applying stormwater management standards and other regulations that control impacts
of development on public infrastructure and resources, now relies on 2070 projections to inform its review.
While this guidance has improved the resiliency of new development to flood risks, these standards are not
codified in the Zoning Ordinance.

Flooding | Key Points in Task Force Discussions
Over the course of several months, the Task Force discussed the benefits, costs, and challenges of different
development strategies as framed by the City’s current climate planning efforts. Some key considerations
that helped focus which strategies to prioritize relative to flooding included:
• Basements and low-level first floors are the most
vulnerable parts of buildings to flooding; flooding
in these living spaces can lead to damaged
utilities, mold, poor indoor air quality, and
contaminated water.

infrastructure systems, which limits the nature of
the interventions.
• Since flood projections are subject to change
and the impacts from precipitation and SLR/
SS flooding varies throughout Cambridge, it is
important to match the zoning requirements to
the level of risk and give property owners some
flexibility to choose how to protect against or
recover from flooding.

• Certain types of habitable uses should not be
allowed below a certain flood elevation.
• It is easier to regulate new construction than it is
to regulate renovations to existing buildings.

• Incremental solutions, such as solar-ready roofs,
and strategies that provide co-benefits, including
a pathway to net zero renewable energy, improve
future resiliency while acknowledging current
standards.

• Regulations could pose a financial burden that
would make renovations cost-prohibitive for
some residents; as a result, property owners
need some flexibility to be able to make their
own choices about how to weigh the costs and
benefits of different adaptation options.

• Standards adopted into the Zoning Ordinance
will need to balance other City priorities such as
urban design guidelines, housing affordability, and
the city’s historic character.

• Development standards can have an impact
on stormwater management, but zoning
regulates land use and development, not larger

Heat | Climate Projections, Risks, and Outcomes
The Task Force also reviewed
key impacts associated
with heat and humidity.
According to CCVA projections,
the average ambient air
temperature will be warmer,
but will also fluctuate between
greater extremes of heat
and cold. Heat waves will be
more frequent and longer in
duration, which means that
building energy use will shift
from predominantly heating to
predominantly cooling by midcentury. Each year, Cambridge
currently experiences less than
two weeks’ worth of days over
90°F, known as high heat days.
The CCVA found that by 2070,
there may be over two months’
worth of high heat days.

Projected Change in High Heat Days
By the 2030s, the average summer heat index in the City could be around 95°F and by
the 2070s, the average summer heat index could be as high as 110°F. (Source: CCVA 2015

In addition, the heat index, which is a function
of temperature and relative humidity, is
projected to increase significantly. This will
make hot temperatures feel even hotter
and could exacerbate the likelihood of heat
exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat waves and
poor indoor air quality will become increasingly

While heat is an issue citywide, its impacts
vary throughout the city due to the urban
heat island effect, which magnifies ambient
air temperature, making the air hotter than it
would be otherwise. Areas in Cambridge with
minimal tree canopy and large amounts of
impervious surfaces, such as pavement and
dark roofs, tend to capture and retain heat.
This is especially prevalent in the Alewife
Quadrangle and East Cambridge, but heat
islands exist throughout the city. Climate
projections show that the urban heat island
effect will expand in area and become more
intense over time.

Heat | Climate Projections, Risks, and Outcomes

Heat | Adaptation Strategies
Through the CCPR planning process, the City has identified three significant strategies to mitigate the
impacts of rising temperatures by reducing heat island effects: increasing vegetation while decreasing
impervious surfaces, promoting shade by expanding the urban forest canopy and using non-vegetative shade
structures, and using high solar reflective index (SRI) building envelopes and roofs.
• Vegetation and impervious surfaces: Converting
impervious surfaces to vegetation using green
infrastructure techniques also reduces ambient
air temperature since reducing impervious
area decreases air temperature and green
infrastructure effectively reduces impervious
area. Testing the maximum extent practicable of
this conversion in the same area near Alewife and
North Cambridge demonstrates that there could
be an average temperature decrease of 1.7°F with
a temperature reduction in the range of 0.1-6°F;

above 60% coverage. The UFMP acknowledges
that while trees are more effective than shade
structures, shade structures can provide shade
immediately while new tree plantings require
many years to achieve significant shade. As a
result, shade structures act as a complementary
heat reduction strategy to trees;
• High-SRI building envelopes and roofs: One
study done in the area near Alewife and North
Cambridge shows that if 50% of roofs were
painted white to have a high SRI, the average
ambient air temperature could decrease by 2.4°F
with a maximum temperature reduction of 4.5°F.

• Shade: The CCPR plans found that a 1% increase
in the tree canopy relates to 0.12°F of cooling. It
also found that increasing canopy cover to 30%
citywide would lead to significant cooling of
38% of the city land area and that tree canopy
provides the most significant cooling effects

Heat | Key Points in Task Force Discussion
The Task Force discussed how Cambridge’s urban form influences temperatures and how it could be modified
to promote cooling. Some key considerations that helped focus which strategies to prioritize for heat
adaptation included:
• All areas of the city will experience an increase in
the ambient air temperature, so cooling strategies
should provide citywide benefits in addition to
targeting priority areas;

• The City should promote tree maintenance
and encourage contiguous canopy coverage,
especially for public corridors and areas of high
public use;

• A performance-based requirement for heat
resilience that gives a property owner a menu of
options from which to choose allows for the most
flexibility and choice because it acknowledges
that conditions vary across sites;

• Standards adopted into the Zoning Ordinance
should strive to meet the goal of the UFMP to
increase tree canopy coverage citywide, though
they will need to balance other City priorities such
as urban design guidelines, housing needs and
affordability, and the city’s historic character.

• Vegetation is not always a feasible way to provide
shade, so structures such as overhangs and
canopies should be considered as a complement;

Task Force Study and Findings

Other Aspects
of Resilience

The Task Force focused primarily on urban development strategies to
mitigate flooding and heat, as they are the source of the most significant
impacts from climate change that Cambridge will face, and they can be
addressed directly through development standards in zoning. However,
the Task Force also discussed other planning strategies that could be
addressed more indirectly in zoning.

Emergency Planning
community room that is elevated above potential
flooding and has a backup energy supply, food and
water, and a communication system. They could
also have emergency egress and programming that
enhances social resilience. Task Force members
also discussed how emergency planning requires
thinking about sharing resources and shelter among
buildings.

Emergency planning involves better preparing
residents for emergency scenarios by providing
resources that educate them and connect them
with their community in the instance of an
emergency event. It is distinct from emergency
response, which provides immediate services to
those impacted by disaster or trauma to limit the
negative impacts they experience. The goal of
emergency planning is to improve human comfort
and safety during an emergency with stand-alone
or passive life support systems.

While emergency planning falls outside the scope
of development standards that can be mandated
through zoning, it could be included as a topic
to be discussed when development proposals
are required to undergo a holistic design review
process, such as a Planning Board special permit or
an advisory development consultation.

Task Force members agreed that new construction
or substantial investments in renovations should
incorporate emergency planning to help residents —
particularly vulnerable residents — shelter in place.
For instance, these projects could include a resilient

b

Passive Resilience
The concept of “passive design” encourages
buildings to be designed to maximize interior
comfort while requiring minimal energy use. This is
effective as a climate change mitigation strategy
because it reduces greenhouse gas emissions,
but also promotes climate resilience because it
increases a building’s ability to withstand heat
and to keep occupants safe in the event of power
outages or extreme weather events.

However, there are ways that such approaches can
be encouraged. As with emergency preparedness
measures, passive design strategies could be a
consideration for developments that undergo a
holistic design review process. For example, the
“Passive House” rating system is incorporated
into the city’s Green Building Requirements as an
alternative to the LEED rating system.

Passive design strategies involve careful attention
to building envelope assemblies, building systems,
and materials, which are regulated by the building
code and therefore generally outside the scope of
zoning.

Other Aspects of Resilience

Zoning
Approaches
Zoning is a form of land use regulation that controls
the type and intensity of land use, including the size
and scale of buildings, as well as site and building
characteristics such as setbacks and open space.
Along with other regulations such as building codes,
stormwater regulations, and historic preservation
reviews, zoning is a key aspect of how Cambridge
shapes its built environment.

with new zoning standards if they are modified or
expanded, with a presumption that development
will transition from being less-conforming to moreconforming over time.
While zoning may influence the choices that a
property owner makes, it only regulates and does
not dictate change. As mentioned above, there are
many other regulations and factors that influence
development.

Far from being a rigid, one-size-fits-all tool, zoning
offers municipalities different approaches to land
use regulation. How zoning is crafted depends on
the outcomes that Cambridge wants to achieve,
including the types of projects that it wants to
encourage or discourage.

In addition, zoning is more effective when it sets
specific, quantifiable standards that are easy
to measure and do not change. Zoning is less
effective at regulating more qualitative standards
and criteria that involve changes over time.

Zoning mainly controls new development and
alterations to existing development. Existing
uses and buildings may be maintained even if the
zoning is changed but, depending on the type of
modification or expansion, may have to conform

How Zoning Works
In addition to base zoning, there are citywide
development standards that apply to all (or
most) base zoning districts as well as areaspecific overlay districts that overlap with all
or parts of base zoning districts. Citywide rules
serve particular policy objectives, and include
Green Building Requirements (Section 22.20),
Inclusionary Housing and Incentive Zoning (Section
11.203), and Project Review (Article 19.000). Areaspecific overlay districts modify the base zoning
in locations that are subject to particular planning
concerns, and include Planned Unit Development
(PUD) districts, mixed-use overlay districts (e.g.,
Central Square and Harvard Square), and the Flood
Plain Overlay District.

Cambridge is divided into base zoning districts that
regulate basic aspects of development, such as use,
building height, floor area, number of housing units,
open space, setbacks, and parking. Each district has
a set of uniform rules that correspond to its unique
development characteristics. Some districts are
more permissive – allowing a wider range of uses, or
larger buildings – while others are more restrictive.
Any new development standards would need to
interact with existing standards in a logical way.

After reviewing and discussing the aforementioned
background information, but before developing
zoning recommendations, the Task Force discussed
and reached consensus around a set of principles
and factors to guide its discussions.
With this framework in mind, it then identified
more specific land use and development objectives
that the final recommendations would aim to
achieve. While not all of these objectives are best
accomplished through zoning, they can guide the
development of climate-resilient zoning standards,
as well as the City’s other climate resilience

• Consider human needs in
relation to the physical
environment;

• Differentiation: Apply
different strategies

while elevating existing
buildings or systems
is more difficult; open
space and tree plantings
will have different effects
in areas with different
prevailing patterns of
development);

• For residential
development, focus
on health, safety, and
livability of people’s
homes;
• For commercial
development, focus on
economic impacts that
broadly affect people’s
lives;
• Acknowledge the
differing capacities for
risk, or willingness to
accept risk, of people
across the income
spectrum;
• Foster greater social
connectiveness and
mutual support.

• Choice: Provide options
to allow for economic
choices (e.g., cost
of floodproofing to
withstand damage vs.
cost of replacement;
installation of structural
sun-shading devices vs.
green infrastructure).

• Target policies to
new construction or
existing development
depending on how much

5. Allow flexibility
in changing
circumstances
• Incrementalism: Promote
present actions that can
lead to future improvements,
mindful of the balance of
risks and costs;
• Ratcheting: Modify
standards to become more
or less strenuous as climate
projections and associated
risks change over time;
• Learning: Periodically review
what strategies have worked,
if desired outcomes are being
achieved, and if changes are
needed to achieve outcomes
or adjust to new data;

built environment changes
slowly so evaluating the
effectiveness of zoning
interventions requires time
to see impacts and benefits
unfold.

with co-benefits

7. Seek effectiveness

• Implement strategies that
mitigate both flooding
and heat;

• Choose strategies that are
the best suited to address
the issue or impact;

• Prioritize strategies
that have other benefits
such as reduced energy
demand (e.g., passive
livability), improved water
quality (e.g. increased
pervious surface), air
quality, open space,
habitat, or recreation
when possible;

• Use zoning to complement
non-zoning tools and
other actions the City is
undertaking (e.g. CCPR);
• Affect enough sustainable
development to have a
meaningful impact on
residents and the built
environment;
• Aim for benefits at the
individual property, abutter,
neighborhood, and city
scale that will exceed costs
over the life of a structure.

• Balance strategies that
improve flooding and heat
resilience with other city
priorities.

based on best
available data and
science
• Build a base of knowledge
for future decision-making
by continuing to collect
and evaluate information
about climate change and
its impacts;
• Plan for climate science
to evolve and our
understanding of impacts
to become clearer with
time;
• Use forward-looking
data, acknowledging
uncertainties while
anticipating that future
climate conditions will be
warmer and wetter.

Recommendations
The final phase of the Task Force’s process involved working to develop recommended changes to the
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance that are informed by the Principles and Factors described above and would
achieve the Land Use and Development Objectives described above. The recommendations are grouped in
the following categories:
• Category 1: Flood Resilience – Codification of
standards based on 2070 projected flooding
elevations that are consistent and/or achievable with
current City practices and goals.

• Category 4: Planning Board Review – Addition of
new standards that are applicable to major new
development regulated by Article 19.000 (including
Green Building Requirements in Section 22.20),
generally developments of 25,000+ square feet.

• Category 2: Heat Resilience – Creation of the
performance-based Cool Factor and establishment of
new standards based on City plans.

• Category 5: Future Study – Other initiatives that could
directly or indirectly advance resilience planning, and
efforts to undertake as new zoning is implemented.

• Category 3: Adjust Current Zoning Standards –
Removing obstacles in current base zoning standards
that prevent or discourage resilience measures that
are recommended in the City’s Climate Change
Preparedness and Resilience planning.

The consensus of the Task Force was to set new flood resilience and heat resilience standards in the case
of larger-scale development (25,000 square feet or more) and newly-constructed buildings of all sizes,
but not to impose requirements that could be overly burdensome to owners of smaller sites making
alterations or additions to existing buildings. Task Force members recognized the importance of promoting
climate resilience citywide through zoning; however, they believed that the City needs to further study how
requirements could be tailored to existing buildings on smaller parcels to ensure that they do not place undue
burdens on small property owners.

Category 1: Flood Resilience

Overview

Standards and Application

To address the impacts of flooding in Cambridge,
the Task Force identified development standards
based on the Long-Term Flood Elevations (LTFE)
identified in the Cambridge FloodViewer. By using
future projections rather than flood risk maps
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), the City will be able to protect
buildings and sites that experience riverine flooding,
localized flooding, and flooding due to sea level
rise and storm surge (SLR/SS). The Task Force
decided to use the LTFE projections because most
buildings built today are designed to last for 50
years, which is in alignment with the timeframe of
the projections. The Task Force recommends that
these standards be updated at regular intervals
as the science evolves and projections change, as
long as there is advance notice before they become
effective.

The Task Force recommends requiring flood
protection for all new construction occurring on
sites below the projected flood elevations as
identified in the Cambridge FloodViewer. Flood
protection is defined differently for different uses
and is based around the build/protect/recover
standards identified in the Resilient Cambridge
Plan. Alterations to non-conforming buildings (as
regulated by Article 8.000 of the Zoning Ordinance)
would not be subject to the requirements if
expressly exempted.

For portions of buildings that are below the

would apply:

• Protect vulnerable residential living space and
critical building systems with barriers to prevent
flooding (i.e., dry floodproofing), if they cannot be
elevated above the 1%-probability LTFE;

• Protect all occupiable spaces intended for regular
active use with barriers to prevent flooding (i.e.,
dry floodproofing), if they cannot be elevated
above the 10%-probability LTFE;

• Design other occupiable spaces to recover from
flooding without irreparable damage (i.e., wet
floodproofing).

• Design all other parts of the building to
recover without irreparable damage (i.e., wet
floodproofing).

The Task Force is recommending these
standards because they will codify existing
City-recommended practices and because they
give property owners greater flexibility while
still protecting buildings and people. Task Force
members also noted that the details of the
recommended standards and application will need
to be refined as City staff translate them into final
zoning language, particularly when identifying the
precise uses within a building that are subject to
“protect” or “recover” standards.

suggested that historic structures may need
special considerations and that it would be useful
to allow modifications through a Planning Board
special permit process. Some Task Force members
asked that language be included that encourages
developers of large projects to protect to the 1%LTFE where possible, since the higher standard
increases a building’s flood resilience.
The Task Force discussed how the Affordable
Housing Overlay (AHO) could be affected by
proposed new standards. Some Task Force members
expressed that they do not want to interfere with
the goals of the AHO. AHO Projects are currently
subject to the City’s sustainable development
standards (including Green Building Requirements),
though many other zoning requirements are waived.
Since the AHO purposefully allows development
to proceed as-of-right, if an AHO Project requires
a variance or special permit due to additional
requirements, then it could undermine its intent.
Task Force members recognized that this issue
would be an important consideration for the City
Council when adopting any new zoning.

Task Force Comments
The Task Force was supportive of these standards
because they are targeted to areas that are
projected to experience flooding and because they
offer a certain amount of flexibility and choice. Task
Force members noted that the FloodViewer should
be updated at regular, pre-determined intervals to
ensure predictability. Some Task Force members
also suggested that the City establish a mechanism
for property owners to contest the FloodViewer’s
assessment of flood risk for their parcel based on
ground elevation data. Other Task Force members

Category 2: Heat Resilience
Overview

The Cool Factor calculates a weighted score based
on site features including mature tree preservation,
new tree planting, ground-level vegetation coverage,
green roofs, shade structures, and the use of highsolar-reflectivity paving materials. Aside from one
prerequisite – the use of high-solar-reflectivity
roof coverings – property owners are given the
flexibility to choose which Cool Factor strategies are
most appropriate for their project, as long as they
meet the minimum weighted score requirement
or “Cool Score” applicable to that site. The Task
Force is recommending this strategy because
traditional zoning does not adequately encourage
overall cooling performance of buildings and sites.
In addition, members acknowledged that this
approach would work in tandem with Cambridge’s
other regulations, including existing zoning
requirements for open space and permeable area as
well as DPW’s stormwater management regulations
that combine green and grey infrastructure.

A key component of the Task Force’s
recommendations is the use of the performancebased Cool Factor to measure the heat resilience
of a development proposal. The Cool Factor is
a variation on other performance-based “green
area ratios,” such as Seattle’s Green Factor and
Somerville’s Green Score, as well as the Green Factor
that was proposed by the Brown, et al., zoning
petition. The Task Force favored this approach
as an innovative and meaningful way to create
development standards to address urban heat
island mitigation directly. The proposed standards
were developed collaboratively by the lead
consultants working on the Resilient Cambridge
Plan and the Urban Forest Master Plan, drawing
from the research and findings of both studies.

In developing the Cool Factor, the City’s staff and consultants looked at other cities’ performance-based
“green area ratio” standards, including Somerville and Seattle, as well as the Green Factor proposed by the
Brown, et al. zoning petition. The below table compares which strategies are included in these precedents
as well as the proposed Cool Factor. Some differences are based on Cambridge-specific research into what
interventions have the most significant effects on cooling. The Cool Factor does not give points to water
features or pervious paving because they do not have a substantial cooling benefit. However, it does give
points to high-SRI paving and shade structures because research shows that they lower the ambient air
temperature, though they are weighted lower than “green” interventions.

Category 2: Heat Resilience | Overview

b

Many cities with a green area ratio-type requirement also use it to address other issues, such as landscape
aesthetics, stormwater management, and greenhouse gas reduction. Because Cambridge already regulates
these through other requirements, the Task Force recommended a Cool Factor approach that focuses on
elements that are not already required. One reason is that because the system relies on earning credits, it
did not seem worthwhile to grant credit for non-cooling interventions that are already required. However,
interventions that have co-benefits would be encouraged. For example, vegetation strategies could
count toward the proposed Cool Factor as well as existing Green Building Requirements and stormwater
management regulations, among others.

Cool Factor Complements Traditional Zoning: The structure of the Cool Factor complements
traditional zoning by emphasizing the use of cooling strategies to meet existing zoning requirements.

Standards and Applications

Task Force Comments

The Task Force recommends adopting the Cool
Factor as the City’s primary standard for measuring
the heat resilience of development projects. The
Cool Factor would be applied in the following ways:

There was interest among some Task Force
members to apply the Cool Factor to alterations
and renovations that are under 25,000 square feet;
however, the Task Force decided that more analysis
was needed to understand the impacts of doing so.
Similarly, Task Force members were not comfortable
recommending changing the existing open space
requirements in the Zoning Ordinance due to the
possibility for unintended consequences. Overall,
Task Force members supported having all properties
in Cambridge contribute to cooling but thought
that the City needed to conduct additional research
to identify an appropriate citywide standard that
acknowledges different zoning scales and contexts.
Task Force members also noted that the details of
the recommended standards and application will
need to be refined as City staff translate them into
final zoning language.

• For new construction of 25,000+ square feet, the
Cool Factor would apply with a minimum “Cool
Target” equal to the open space requirement in the
zoning district, or a minimum of 20%.
• For alterations to buildings of 25,000+ square feet
or to their sites, the Cool Factor (with the minimum
targets above) would need to be met. If the site
does not currently meet the applicable target, then
it cannot be further reduced (i.e., if the proposed
alterations would further reduce the Cool Factor
below the applicable target, then additional features
must be included on the site to compensate for that
reduction).
• For development that is less than 25,000 square feet,
the Cool Factor (with the minimum targets above)
would apply only when a new building is being built
on a site, but not when alterations are proposed.

Task Force members suggested establishing a
process to revisit the Cool Factor scoring a few
years after its adoption, once the City and property
owners have had experience implementing the

• Modifications to the above standards may be
approved by special permit.

standard. Some Task Force members preferred
setting a minimum cooling multiplier of 25%
but were able to agree to a 20% minimum; they
suggested that it might be appropriate to increase
the cooling multiplier in the future. Some Task Force
members advocated for a separate Green Factor
score that would account for resiliency measures
outside of cooling and would complement the
Cool Factor. Task Force members noted that the
City needed to work out the specifics for how
property owners of non-conforming buildings
could compensate for a reduction in their existing
Cool Factor score. They also mentioned the need
for flexibility for historic structures. Some Task
Force members suggested setting minimum and
maximum requirements for the percentage by
which any given strategy contributes to the overall
Cool Factor score.

Category 3: Adjust Current Zoning Standards
Overview

Standards and Application

New zoning requirements should work in tandem
with development standards that are already in
place. Therefore, in addition to creating additional
requirements that development must meet, it is
important to ensure that other zoning requirements
do not constrain or discourage the outcomes that
are desired.

The Task Force recommends the following changes
to the Zoning Ordinance:

There are certain standards in the current Zoning
Ordinance that could be revised or removed
because they create impediments to achieving the
Task Force’s Principles and Objectives. Removing
these requirements would provide incentives for
property owners to change buildings and sites to
be more resilient without imposing new regulatory
burdens.

• Exempt exterior flood-resilience measures (e.g.,
stairs, ramps) from GFA, setback, and open space
limitations. This would apply to new construction
or alterations where site flood protection
measures are proposed.

• Exempt outdoor shade canopies from GFA, height,
setback, and open space limitations. This would
apply to new construction or alterations where
shade canopies are proposed.

• Exempt usable green roof areas and rooftop
access headhouses from GFA and height
limitations as-of-right. This would apply to new
construction or alterations where green roofs are
proposed.

Task Force Comments

• Allow a compensating increase in height limit
(up to 4’) if the ground story is elevated up to
the 2070 1%-LTFE. This would apply to new
construction or alterations where site flood
protection measures are proposed.

The Task Force was very supportive of these
five recommendations. One Task Force member
expressed concern with exempting shade
structures from height and setback requirements,
but ultimately all Task Force members agreed to
these recommendations.

• Exempt basement area from GFA limitations asof-right, if protected from flooding below 2070
1%-LTFE. This would apply to new construction or
alterations where site flood protection measures
are proposed and would modify an existing
standard.

Similarly, some Task Force members expressed
concern with completely exempting rooftop access
headhouses from GFA and height requirements
because of the possibility that the exemption could
be exploited; they suggested placing a limit on
these exemptions.

Task Force members also noted that the details of
the recommended standards and application will
need to be refined as City staff translate them into
final zoning language.

Other Task Force members noted that a
compensation of 4’ in height may be inadequate
to offset elevating the ground floor of buildings to
the 2070 1%-LTFE; they suggested that allowing a
slightly larger height standard would ensure that
raising a building does not diminish a site’s full
development potential.

Category 4: Planning Board Review
Overview

Standards and Application

Section 19.20 of the Zoning Ordinance establishes a
process by which the Planning Board reviews major
development for consistency with the urban design
objectives of the City and to mitigate adverse impacts
on city traffic. Typically, the special permit only applies
to buildings equal to or greater than 50,000 gross square
feet, though in some districts review is required for
projects equal to or greater than 20,000 gross square
feet. Applicants are required to submit a variety of
studies, plans, and narratives, and the Planning Board
makes specific findings based on criteria in the Zoning
Ordinance.

The Task Force recommends adding two standards
to Article 19.000 that would apply to projects
applying for a special permit from the Planning
Board:

These special permits only apply to a limited number of
developments, but most new development in Cambridge
falls into this large project category. The holistic review
process, with public input and approval based on a set of
established criteria, provides an opportunity to conduct
a site-specific review of how a development is planned
and designed for resilience.

• Require applicants for a Project Review Special
Permit to submit a Resilience Narrative with their
application that includes projections for flood risk
and heat risk as well as a description of adaptation
strategies, including flood protection, heat island
mitigation, passive resilience measures, and
operational preparedness.
• Add a Resilience Objective to the Citywide Urban
Design Objectives in Section 19.30 that notes that
development should be planned to respond to
anticipated effects of climate change, with indicators
related to flood protection, heat island mitigation,
passive resilience measures, and emergency planning.

to consider resilience measures early in the
development of their projects. It also ties into the
Task Force’s recommendations for flood resilience
and heat resilience. Similarly, the Resilience
Objective gives City staff and Planning Board
members guidance for evaluating applications for a
special permit.

The Task Force supported these recommendations
because they prioritize resilience and create
consistency in how it is reviewed by the Planning
Board. Some Task Force members noted that the
indicators will need to be specific and fact-based
in order to improve the resilience of projects.
They suggested including drawing sheets in the
submission package and requiring applicants to
identify a full range of resiliency measures for all of
the key aspects identified in both the Resilience
Narrative and the Resilience Objective.
Some Task Force members suggested that
templates and a menu of strategies could be made
available to applicants to promote best practices
and encourage consistency. Some Task Force
members also suggested that applicants reference
how their projects conform with specific City plans
and goals outlined in policies such as the UFMP and
the Resilient Cambridge Plan.

Category 5: Future Study

The Task Force acknowledged that climate
science is dynamic, so members suggested that
these amendments to the zoning ordinance be
evaluated for their performance at a future date.
In particular, they recommended studying the
success of these amendments in meeting the Task
Force’s Principles and Objectives, with a focus on
climate resilience effects as well as impacts on
housing costs and production, historic preservation,
and small business viability. Task Force members
also suggested revisiting climate projections and
recommendations from the Resilient Cambridge
Plan to determine if additional approaches should
be considered, such as expanding the Cool Factor as
mentioned above.

importance of preserving Cambridge’s built cultural
heritage through standards that balance historic
preservation with resiliency. Members also noted
the role that urban design guidelines could play to
guide climate-resilient development in the city.
In addition, the Task Force discussed how revising
the City’s parking requirements in Article 6.000
of the Zoning Ordinance would also make
Cambridge more resilient to climate change.
By taking such steps as eliminating minimum
parking requirements, lowering maximum parking
requirements, and reducing parking ratios, the City
would decrease the amount of land used for the
storage of vehicles. This would likely reduce the
amount of impervious surface and create more
opportunities for green infrastructure, which would
improve the City’s ability to withstand the impacts
of increased flooding and increased heat. However,
the Task Force decided not to include these
strategies in its final recommendations because
members chose to focus more specifically on
buildings and sites.

As the Task Force discussed possible
recommendations to the Zoning Ordinance,
members also acknowledged that there were
related issues that needed to be addressed
but were outside of the scope of zoning. For
example, Task Force members discussed the

Implementation
and Next Steps
The Charge and Operating Procedures that guided
the Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force set an
expectation that City staff would translate these
recommendations into a zoning petition, with
input from the City’s Law Department and other
departments. As City staff work to implement the Task
Force’s recommendations, staff will have to evaluate
how to incorporate those recommendations within the
parameters of what can be legally regulated through
zoning. In instances where the final zoning standards
look different from the initial recommendations, they
will still meet the Principles and Objectives identified
by the Task Force.
Since amending the Zoning Ordinance requires the
Planning Board and the City Council or the City’s
Ordinance Committee to hold public hearings, there
will be many opportunities for continued public
comment and involvement. City staff also intends to
provide opportunities for the Task Force to provide
input when the zoning language is drafted.

Vision: To bring together stakeholders from across
the Cambridge community and reach consensus
around an effective approach to regulating urban
development in a way that will mitigate the
identified impacts and risks of on-going climate
change.

consideration and adoption. Should the Task Force
reach consensus on recommendations that can be
reasonably advanced during rather than at the end
of the process, without constraining the group’s
ability to reach consensus on the work product as a
whole, they can and will do so.

Purpose: To discuss climate change vulnerabilities
identified in the Cambridge Climate Vulnerability
Assessment, review recommendations from
the ongoing Climate Change Preparedness and
Resilience (CCPR) planning effort and other related
initiatives and recommend development standards
to incorporate into Cambridge’s Zoning Ordinance.

Note: All meetings are open to the public. Meetings
will be posted on the City web page and meeting
notes and other materials will be prepared and
posted on the web. All formulation and prioritization
of recommendations will take place at Task Force
meetings, though members may informally and
individually engage one another for relationship
building, sharing of interests, and idea generation.
Group email discussions are discouraged, and
any information meant to be shared with the
group should be sent to the project manager for
moderation.

Product: Report to the City Manager detailing a set
of recommendations for climate-resilient zoning
that can be translated into a formal zoning petition
by City staff and presented to the City Council for

Developing Recommendations to the City Manager
by a Consensus Process:
• Once discussions have proceeded in creating
options and identifying preferences, the project
team will present a draft recommendation or a
narrow set of options.
• The participants will then work to refine, adjust
and improve the draft recommendation.
• The facilitator will then test for consensus
upon group refinement. determine if consensus
has been reached, and declare whether the
group has or has not reached consensus. Such
determinations will be recorded clearly in meeting
summaries. Remaining objections will be recorded
in the meeting summary.
• Consensus in this context is defined as
concurrence of all or almost all of the
participating members (see next page for
members) that they can at least “accept” or “live
with” the group’s recommendation, even if it is
not their preferred outcome.

Expectations of the Co-Chairs and Facilitators:
• Ensure groundrules for participation are met
• Develop meeting agendas, prepare and distribute
draft and final meeting summaries, generate draft
written products
• Help participants resolve their differences on the
issues raised
• The co-chairs and/or facilitator have no decisionmaking authority and cannot impose any solution,
settlement, or agreement among any or all of the
parties
• The facilitators are accountable to the Task Force
as a whole and will work in a non-partisan and
impartial manner

Developing Recommendations to the City Manager
by a Consensus Process, continued:
• Participants may also “abstain” or “stand aside”
and not offer their consent to avoid blocking
an agreement while also not lending their
endorsement. Absence is the equivalent of
abstaining.
• Participants should not block or withhold
consensus unless they have serious reservations
with the approach or solution that is proposed
for consensus. If participants disagree with the
approach or solution proposed, they should
make every effort to offer an alternative for
consideration that will be satisfactory to all
participants.

• On decisions in which the Task Force does not
reach consensus, participants will explore the
reasons for disagreement. The participants will
identify points upon which they agreed and
disagreed, the reasons behind each, a description
of the interests that must be satisfied to reach an
agreement, and if possible, ways to address the
differences in the future.
• In such cases of disagreement, if there are
remaining disagreements at the end of the
process, the facilitators and co-chairs would try
to characterize the nature of that disagreement in
the final report.

Cambridge Cool Factor
Guidance Document
How to use this document

How to fill out the Score Sheet

This document guides applicants in completing
the Cool Factor Score Sheet. Below, each strategy
that contributes to the score is defined, and
any requirements for utilizing and counting the
strategies are explained.

First, fill out the fields at the top of the Score Sheet,
including the total lot area of the site in square feet
and the Cool Target. The Cool Target is either the
open space requirement per the Zoning Ordinance
or 20%, whichever is higher. Then, for all strategies
except those in category A, enter the number of
square feet dedicated to the strategy (such as B3:
Planting Area or C3: Green Roof). For strategies in
category A, simply enter the number of trees; the
corresponding square footage of tree canopy is
automatically calculated by the Score Sheet. The
Score Sheet distinguishes between strategies that
are within 20 feet of the public right-of-way and
those that are not. Note that a strategy can only be
counted once.

b

Cambridge Cool Factor
Strategy Definitions & Prerequisites
How the Score Sheet is calculated
For all strategies, the area of each strategy is
automatically multiplied by a weighting factor, so
strategies that provide a greater cooling benefit
have a higher relative value. For example, preserving
large canopy trees, which provide large areas of
shade and significant cooling, has the highest
value due to its high multiplication factor. Similarly,
strategies that are within 20 feet of the public rightof-way have a higher multiplication factor than
strategies that are outside of that area because
they provide an additional public benefit.

The Score Sheet automatically calculates the value
of all strategies, then divides that sum by the total
cooling area goal, which is simply the total lot area
multiplied by the open space requirement. If the
resulting figure is 1 or above and the building design
includes a high-Solar Reflectance Index roof, then
the requirements of the Cool Factor have been
met. If the score is below 1, revisit the initial site
strategies and try to identify any opportunities to
increase the use of strategies with higher multipliers
and strategies within 20’ of the public right of way.
Also consider increasing the area of individual
strategies.

b

A TREES
Strategies A1 through A5 are for existing trees while strategies A6 and A7 are for new and transplanted trees. Existing trees
are preserved and protected onsite throughout the construction process. Because of their maturity, existing trees often
provide more shade than young trees, which is why they have a relatively high multiplier. In order to receive credit, existing
trees must be in good health. Existing tree size is defined by the canopy width at the time of score sheet submittal.
New trees may take several years before they form a mature canopy and contribute to the shading of the site; therefore,
they have a smaller multiplier than preserved existing trees. Since transplanted trees are not guaranteed to survive, they
also have a smaller multiplier.
For all trees, the score sheet approximates the canopy width of understory trees at 150 square feet and the canopy width of
canopy trees at 700 square feet.
Definitions
Understory Trees are defined as trees reaching a canopy spread of 8’ to 15’ at maturity. Examples include Serviceberry
(Amelanchier Canadensis), Eastern Redbud (Cercis Canadensis), and Cornelian-cherry dogwood (Cornus mas).
Canopy Trees are defined as trees reaching a spread of 25’ to 30’ at maturity. Examples include Pin oak (Quercus
palustris), Kentucky Coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), and American Linden (Tilia Americana).
Strategies
A1: Understory Tree, currently <10’ canopy spread
A2: Understory Tree, currently >10’ canopy spread
A3: Canopy Tree, currently <15’ canopy spread
A4: Canopy Tree, currently between 15’ and 25’ canopy spread
A5: Canopy Tree, currently >25’ canopy spread
A6: New and Transplanted Understory Trees (at least 400 cubic feet of soil per tree required)
A7: New and Transplanted Canopy Trees (at least 700 cubic feet of soil per tree required)

B PLANTING AREAS
Planting areas may include lawn, perennials and groundcovers, or woody plants, such as shrubs. Planting areas are divided
into categories based on the plants’ mature height. Taller plants contribute more to temperature reduction, which is why
plants taller at maturity receive a higher multiplier. Permanent above-grade planters may be counted for credit; movable
planters may not be counted for credit.
Definitions
Herbaceous plants (i.e. plants without persistent woody stems) include Little Blue Stem (Schizachyrium scoparium),
New England Aster (Aster novae-angliae), and Foamflower (Tiarella cordifolia).
Woody plants (i.e. plants with hard stems) include Winterberry (Ilex verticillata), Summersweet (Clethra anifolia), and
Oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia).
Strategies
B1: Lawn Area, sod or seeded tall grasses (minimum 8” soil depth is required)
B2: Low Planting Area, herbaceous or woody plants less than 2’ tall at maturity (minimum 12” soil depth is required)
B3: Planting Area, herbaceous or woody plants more than 2’ tall at maturity (minimum 18” soil depth is required)

b

C 1-2 GREEN FACADE + LIVING WALL
Green facades and living walls are living vertical systems that contain plant species and/or a planting medium.
Definitions
Green Façades are vertical surfaces covered with vines or climbing species that are planted in the ground and attach
themselves to a lattice, cable, mesh, or wall surface. Some species need vertical support structures while others do
not.
Living Walls are vertical surfaces comprised of plants that are planted directly in a suspended growing medium.
These systems are usually more intensive to construct and maintain because they require special structures to hold
the soil volume.
Strategies
C1: Green Façade, requirements include:
• Provide a minimum 15’ wide and 10’ tall structure for vines that need a support system;
• Plant species based on their recommended spacing to cover at least a 15’ wide portion of wall for vines that do
not need support;
• Green facades can receive a maximum credit equivalent to the expected extent of coverage within 10 years or
the total area of the support structure, whichever is smaller;
• Soil requirements: minimum 6 cubic feet per plant.
C2: Living Wall (an irrigation system is required to receive the credit)

C 3-5 GREEN ROOFS
Definitions
Green Roof is defined as a planted area over a built structure with a “lightweight with a shallow layer of growing
substrate of less than 8” deep, requiring minimal maintenance. They generally have lower water requirements and use
small, low-growing plant species, particularly succulents.” (Growing Green Guide)
Intensive Green Roof is defined as a planted area over built structure that is “generally heavier, with a deeper layer
of growing substrate, that supports a wider variety of plant types. Intensive green roofs need more irrigation and
maintenance than extensive roofs, and are highly engineered landscapes, often built directly on structures with
considerable weight load capacity.” (Growing Green Guide)
Strategies
C3: Green Roof, low soil volume planting such as succulents and grasses (minimum 4” soil depth)
C4: Short Intensive Green Roof, herbaceous and woody plants less than 2’ tall at maturity (minimum 18” soil depth)
C5: Tall Intensive Green Roof, herbaceous and woody plants greater than 2’ tall at maturity (minimum 24” soil depth,
trees counted separately)

D PAVING AND SHADE STRUCTURES
“Solar reflective cool pavements stay cooler in the sun than traditional pavements. Pavement reflectance can be enhanced
by using reflective aggregate, a reflective or clear binder, or a reflective surface coating” (Berkeley Lab, Heat Island Group).
Note that all projects are required to have a high SRI roof, per the definition and strategies below.
Definitions
Solar Reflective Index (SRI): “The SRI is a composite score of solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Solar
reflectance, or albedo, is the percentage of solar energy reflected by a surface.” (Hui Li Ph.D., P.E., in Pavement
Materials for Heat Island Mitigation, 2016). Thermal emittance characterizes the surface capability to reemit the
previously absorbed heat away from itself (A.L. Pisello, in Eco-Efficient Materials for Mitigating Building Cooling Needs,
2015).
Strategies
D1: High SRI Roof, low slope roofs (i.e. ≤ 2:12) must have a minimum SRI of 82 and steep slope roofs (i.e. > 2:12) must
have a minimum SRI of 39
D2: High-SRI Paving must have an SRI of 39 or higher (LEED, V4)
D3: High-SRI Shade structures may include fabric or tensile shade structures as well as hard-material structures, the
shade structure material must have an SRI of 39 or higher (LEED, V4)

Petition:

To consider adoption of the attached Climate Resilience Zoning,
after referral to the Planning Board and Ordinance Committee for
public hearing and report.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
We are pleased to transmit the attached Climate Resilience Zoning Petition for the Council’s
consideration.
On November 15, 2022, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a discussion of a Draft Climate
Resilience Zoning Text with members of the Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force and City
staff who were involved in its drafting. The text is based on the recommendations in the Final
Report of the Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force.
Board members found the proposal to be well thought-out, reflecting years of effort by many
parties representing different perspectives. It is forward-thinking, groundbreaking, and addresses
complicated matters that are of great importance. Board members acknowledge that adjustments
could be considered, but that it would be appropriate to begin the hearing process to involve the
City Council in considering any substantive amendments. The attached text includes some
suggested corrections and clarifying edits that were raised during discussion and in written
comments submitted to the Board.
All eight Board members voted in favor of transmitting the attached petition.

Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

Introduction
This proposed Climate Resilience Zoning is part of the Resilient Cambridge Plan, an effort to make the city more prepared for and resilient to the
impacts of climate change while improving the quality of life and enhancing the city. The Climate Resilience Zoning proposal, which deals with
regulations for urban development like residential and commercial buildings, is just one part of this effort. You can read more about the Resilient
Cambridge Plan here:

The attached zoning text comes from the recommendations of the Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force (CRZTF), a group of stakeholders
representing residents, homeowners, institutions, residential and commercial developers, and subject matter experts from the Cambridge
community. This group met over about two years to discuss shared principles, consider options, and recommend zoning changes that would
promote resilient urban development over time.
As described in the Final Report of the Task Force, this zoning proposal has four components:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

New standards for flood-resilient design
New standards for heat-resilient design
Relaxed zoning standards to remove impediments to resilient development
Additional resilience considerations as part of development review

The recommendations of the Task Force balanced many different points of view to arrive at this set of recommendations. You can read more in

Create a new Section 22.80 to read as follows:
22.80 FLOOD RESILIENCE STANDARDS
22.81 Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to promote building designs that are resilient to the
impacts of flood events that are likely to become more frequent and intense due to the effects of climate
change. These standards are informed by future projections, based on up-to-date scientific research,
rather than historical occurrences of flooding. These standards are intended to account for the differing
needs of buildings and sites and provide flexibility to use different measures to promote resilience. They
are also intended to work in tandem with environmental standards promulgated by the Department of
Public Works (DPW).
22.82 Applicability. This Section shall apply to development subject to Section 22.20 Green Building
Requirements, and to other development as set forth elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance.
22.83 Flood Elevation Standards.
22.83.1 Promulgation.

New Flood Resilience standards
reflect the Task Force’s
recommendation to codify
current DPW advisory practices
based on the City’s Climate
Change Vulnerability Assessment
and the Resilient Cambridge Plan.
Task Force recommended
requiring all new development
meet the Flood Resilience
standards.

(a) The City Engineer shall promulgate, and shall revise from time to time, the projected elevations of
future flood risk due to certain types and probabilities of flood events for every lot in the City of
Cambridge. The resulting projected elevations are referred to herein as Long-Term Flood Elevations
(“LTFEs”).
(b) LTFEs shall be determined for flood risk due to precipitation based on piped infrastructure using the
City’s hydraulic model, and for flood risk due to sea level rise and storm surge based on climate
modeling performed by or endorsed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s agencies and
determined by the City Engineer to represent the most reliable and up-to-date scientific analysis of
future climate conditions. Whenever promulgating new LTFEs, the City Engineer shall document the
source data used to determine the LTFEs and shall provide an explanation of why such data was
selected.

Long-term flood elevations are
established based on scientific
projections and made available
through the Cambridge
FloodViewer.

(c) LTFEs shall be based on an approximately 50-year projection from the time of promulgation. For
example, LTFEs promulgated in or around the year 2020 shall anticipate flood risks in or around the
year 2070. The City Engineer shall identify the projected timeframe when promulgating LTFEs.
(d) LTFEs shall be represented in vertical feet relative to the Cambridge City Base (CCB) datum.
(e) LTFEs shall be presented in the form of data tables that provide the numerical LTFEs for each parcel
identified on the Cambridge Assessing Map and may also be presented in the form of a physical or
digital map (for example, the Cambridge “FloodViewer” or any successor map) illustrating the LTFEs
for different probabilities of flood risk for different types of flooding (i.e., precipitation, sea level rise,
and storm surge) across the City. Such a map may be presented and/or illustrated in relation to
ground elevation data collected by the City of Cambridge through light detection and ranging (LIDAR)

or other technology; however, if a property owner provides a property survey performed by a licensed
surveyor, such survey shall be considered more accurate than ground elevation data collected by the
City of Cambridge. Property surveys shall not alter the LTFEs but may affect the relative difference
between the LTFE and the Grade on a given parcel.
(f) New or revised LTFEs shall be made available to the public for comment no less than 90 days prior to
final promulgation.
22.83.2 Application in Zoning.
(a) For the purpose of this Section, the following LTFE standards promulgated by the City Engineer as
set forth above shall be applicable to development on a lot or development parcel:
(1)The 1%-Probability Long-Term Flood Elevation standard, or “1%-LTFE standard,” shall refer to the
projected elevation of floodwater that has a one percent annual chance of occurrence due to
either sea level rise and storm surge or due to precipitation, whichever is higher.

Long-term flood elevations are
defined based on accepted
scientific standards.

(2) The 10%-Probability Long-Term Flood Elevation standard, or “10%-LTFE standard,” shall refer to
the projected elevation of floodwater that has a ten percent annual chance of occurrence due to
either sea level rise and storm surge or due to precipitation, whichever is higher.
(b) For the purpose of this Section, then current LTFE standards shall be applicable to a lot or
development parcel beginning on the date of final promulgation. However, a development proposal
that has already submitted a LTFE plan that has been approved in writing by DPW, in accordance
with Section 22.85 below, shall not be subject to LTFE standards promulgated after the date of such
written approval, provided that the proposal receives all necessary permits including but not limited to
a building or special permit and proceeds thereafter continuously and expeditiously to completion.
22.84 Development Standards.
22.84.1 Protection. A Story Above Grade or portion thereof shall be considered protected from flooding to a
specified LTFE standard if its finished floor is higher in elevation than the LTFE standard, or if its finished
floor is lower than the LTFE standard, there are permanent or passively deployable barriers in place at
the height of the LTFE standard adequate to fully prevent the entry of floodwater into the building’s
interior. A Story Below Grade or any portion thereof shall be considered a finished floor protected from
flooding to a specified LTFE standard if the LTFE standard is below the Grade adjoining the building, or if
the LTFE standard is above the Grade adjoining the building, there are permanent or passively
deployable barriers in place at the height of the LTFE standard adequate to fully prevent the entry of
floodwater into the interior of the Story Below Grade. The following standards shall apply:

“Protection” is the higher flood
resilience standard and therefore
applies to less severe flood
elevations and more vulnerable
building uses.

(a) All occupiable spaces within the building, as defined in the State Building Code, shall be protected to
the 10%-LTFE standard, except that small entryways, vestibules, or lobbies with a finished floor
below the 10%-LTFE standard are allowed to not be protected if they contain stairs, ramps, or lifts
that allow occupants to travel to portions of the building that are protected, and if they meet the
standards for “Recovery” set forth in Section 22.84.2 below.

Proposed deletions are in strikeout.

(b) Habitable spaces for residential use, as defined in the State Building Code, shall be protected to the
1%-LTFE standard.
(c) The following critical building equipment within the building or on the site shall be protected to the 1%LTFE standard: mechanical heating and cooling systems including fuel storage tanks, supply meters,
shut-off switches and building management system controls; electrical power supply, transformers,
panels, switchgear, and safety equipment including electrical shut-off equipment, backup generators
and their fuel sources; water heaters and water supply related equipment; telecommunications
equipment; elevator and lift equipment.
22.84.2 Flood Recovery. A portion of a building shall be considered recoverable from the impact of flooding if
floodwater is able to enter and leave the space without causing damage that cannot be readily repaired.
This can be achieved through various strategies, including using permanent or contingent measures that
prevent or provide resistance to flood damage, or that can be easily repaired or replaced if damaged.
Portions of a building located at or below the 10%-LTFE standard that are not required to be protected in
Section 22.84.1 above shall be designed to be recoverable.

“Recovery” is the lower flood
resilience standard and therefore
applies to more severe flood
elevations and less vulnerable
building uses.

22.84.3 Modifications. Upon granting a special permit, the Planning Board may approve modifications to the
development standards set forth in Section 22.84.1 and 22.84.2 above after finding that a proposed
development is designed to meet the intent of the standards in a manner that is more suitable to the
unique conditions of the development or the site. No such modification may be approved under this
section unless it has been reviewed and approved in writing by the City Engineer.

Task Force recommended
allowing modifications by
Planning Board special permit.

22.85 Administrative Review Procedures. Before applying for any special permit from the Planning Board, any
development review procedure under Article 19.000 of the Zoning Ordinance, or a Building Permit,
whichever occurs sooner, the documentation listed below shall be submitted to the Department of Public
Works (DPW) for review. Within forty-five (45) days after receiving a complete set of documentation, DPW
shall provide written notice that the documentation sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the
requirements of this Section or shall provide a written explanation of deficiencies to be corrected in a
revised submission. To verify continued compliance, revised documentation incorporating any design
modifications shall be reviewed and approved by DPW in accordance with the aforementioned
procedures before application for any Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy sought after the initial
submission is accepted.

Flood resilience standards will be
administratively reviewed by
DPW.

(a) Identification of the LTFE standards employed in the development proposal and their date of
promulgation. The applicant’s initial submission shall employ the LTFE standards that have been
promulgated most recently prior to the applicant’s submission of the required documentation. If new
LTFE standards have been made available to the public for possible promulgation, such LTFE
standards shall be identified in the applicant’s submission and shall be applicable to the application if
new LTFE standards are promulgated before DPW completes its review of the application. For a
specific lot or Development Parcel for which the owner has provided a topographical survey, the City
Engineer may approve LTFEs that are adjusted for the unique topography of the lot or Development
Parcel.

include a graphic scale symbol on each drawing sheet.
(c) A written summary of the technical approaches to meeting the “Protection” and “Recovery”
development standards set forth in this Section for any portions of the building located at or below the
1%-LTFE standard or 10%-LTFE standard, including but not limited to the types of flood barriers to be
employed and the types of construction materials to be used within such portions of the building.
(d) A narrative describing any proposed alternative approaches to meeting the intent of the development
standards set forth in this Section, if the proposal is seeking approval of any modifications to such
standards.
22.86 Implementation.
(a) The DPW Commissioner shall have the authority to promulgate regulations for the implementation of
the provisions of this Section. There shall be a ninety (90) day review period to receive public
comments on draft regulations before final promulgation.

Flood resilience standards will be
administered by DPW.

(b) The Department of Public Works may develop standards and procedures appropriate to and
consistent with the provisions of this Section.

Create a new Section 22.90 to read as follows:
22.90 GREEN FACTOR STANDARD
22.91 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to promote the inclusion of features that have a
demonstrable cooling effect on buildings and sites to mitigate urban heat island effect. The performancebased “Green Factor,” as defined in Article 2.000, approach is intended to be flexible and provide options
that can be tailored to different building and site conditions. It is also intended to work in tandem with
other regulations, including existing zoning requirements for open space and permeable area, Green
Building Requirements (Section 22.20 of this Zoning Ordinance), stormwater control regulations
promulgated by the Department of Public Works (DPW), and other standards.
22.92 Applicability. This Section shall apply to development subject to Section 22.20 Green Building
Requirements, and as set forth elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance.
22.93 Prerequisites. The following requirements shall be met for any development that is required to achieve a
minimum Cool Score, as defined in Article 2.000:
22.93.1 High Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) Roof. Where the development involves the construction of a
new building roof or replacement of more than 50% of an existing roof, the surface of such roof shall have
a minimum initial SRI of 82, with the following exceptions:
(a) Roofs with a slope of 2:12 or steeper shall not be subject to a minimum SRI requirement.
(b) Components of a Solar Energy System or Green Roof Area, as defined in this Zoning Ordinance,
shall not be subject to a minimum SRI requirement.

Proposed deletions are in strikeout.

New Green Factor standard
reflects the Task Force’s
recommendation to create a
performance-based zoning
standard for heat resilience based
on the City’s Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment and the
Resilient Cambridge Plan.

Task Force recommended
requiring all new development
meet the Green Factor standard.

Task Force recommended that all
development subject to the
Green Factor standard have a
high-SRI roof, with noted
exceptions.

(c) In the case of a locally-designated historic structure, the minimum SRI may be reduced or waived
to the extent necessary to comply with the conditions of any Certificate of Appropriateness issued by
the Cambridge Historical Commission or by a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission. In
the case of a state-designated or federally-designated historic structure, the minimum SRI may be
reduced or waived to the extent necessary to comply with a determination of adverse effect by the
Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission.
22.94 Calculation.
22.94.1 Cool Target. The Cool Target shall be determined by multiplying the total lot area of the lot or
Development Parcel by the total Open Space requirement applicable in the zoning district, or by 20%,
whichever is greater (see formula below). The Cool Target shall be expressed in square feet.
Total Lot Area x Open Space Requirement (min. 20%) = Cool Target

Task Force recommended a
minimum multiplier of 20%,
regardless of open space
requirements.

22.94.2 Cool Area. The Cool Area shall be determined by multiplying the building and site design
features listed in the table below (as defined in Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance) by the
corresponding weighted values in the table. Features that are located within 20 feet of a street shall use

bulk control plane shall rise from its beginning over the non-residential zoning district. (See illustrative
figure 5.23)
(b) The limitations in Paragraph 1 above may be waived by special permit from the Planning Board upon a
finding by the Board that the additional height is necessary. In making that determination the Planning
Board shall consider the special and unique requirements of the use that the elements are serving, any
special constraints imposed by the site upon which the building is located, the nature and character of
development in the adjacent residential district, and the extent to which successful efforts are made to
minimize the visual and acoustical impact of the elements on neighbors.
5.23.2 If the Ground Story of a building is elevated to meet the Flood Resilience Standards in Section 22.80
of this Zoning Ordinance, then the allowed height of buildings and structures as set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance may be increased as-of-right to compensate for the difference between the Ground Story
finished floor elevation and the Grade elevation. However, the allowed increase in height shall be no
greater than the difference in elevation between the 1%-Probability Long-Term Flood Elevation as
described in Section 22.80 and the Grade, or four (4) feet, whichever is less. The City Engineer shall
certify that the Flood Resilience Standards in Section 22.80 are met prior to issuance of a building
permit for a building or structure utilizing the provisions of this Section 5.23.2.

been established, except where otherwise indicated herein. For buildings of forty (40’) feet or less
in height the denominator in the yard formulas in the Tables in Section 5.30 may be increased by
two subject to the minimum yard requirements set forth in footnotes a, b and c of Tables 5-1 and
5-2.

(2) Where a building consists of various roof levels an average height, or "H", may be used in the
required yard formula. Average height is determined by adding the products of the height of each
roof level facing the given lot line, (H1, H2, etc.) times the length of each roof level (L1, L2, etc.)
and dividing the sum by the sum of the length of the levels (L1, L2, etc.) (see formula below)

(3) Where a building presents a variety of vertical planes to any given lot or street line, no plane shall
be closer to the street or building line or lot line than permitted by the application to such plane of
the appropriate formula in the tables of dimensional requirements in Section 5.30. For all planes
set forward of the setback line required by said tables for the building if it were constructed in a
single vertical plane, other planes must be set behind the setback line so calculated. The result
shall be that the sum of the products of the setback required for each plane times the facing area
of each plane respectively shall be at least as great as the product of the setback required by the
appropriate table for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane times the facing
area of the building if viewed as a single plane. (See illustration below):
The product of (setback1 x facing area1) + (setback2 x facing area2) MUST EQUAL OR EXCEED
the product of (single plane setback) x (single plane facing area).

structural support. No more than two access drives, which in combination total no more than 30
feet in width, shall be permitted to be above the finished grade and still be considered to be
located underground.
(2)The location of a portion of the facility above finished grade to the following extent: (1) the mean
height of that portion of the parking facility above finished grade around the entire perimeter of the
facility does not exceed four (4) feet, which grade is maintained naturally without any structural
support (in no case, however, shall the height above mean grade for that portion of the facility
facing a public street exceed four feet), and (2) the roof or top of the facility shall be either set
beneath other, non-parking facility portions of the structure, landscaped or otherwise finished to
serve as a pedestrian plaza, open space amenity, recreation area or pedestrian circulation. The
height above mean grade shall be measured to the roof of the facility, or to the ceiling should the
facility be set entirely below other non-parking elements of a building.

5.25.3.42 Where an above ground parking facility in a structure is proposed to be constructed (a) in the 100year flood plain, identified as the Zone A flood hazard area (See Section 11.70), or as determined by
credible evidence and calculations from a registered professional engineer or (b) on a contaminated
site that is listed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection under the
Massachusetts Contingency Plan (310 CMR 40.00) with a Release Tracking Number and has been tier
classified, the Planning Board may grant a special permit to waive the limitations of this Section 5.25.3
so that the parking facility is not subject to the requirements in this Ordinance as to Floor Area Ratio
provided only the minimum number of parking spaces required for the uses on the site are provided. In
granting such a special permit, the Planning Board shall find the following:
(1)

Where in a flood hazard area, the construction of a parking facility underground is (a) not
technically feasible due to the requirements of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act
(M.G.L. ch. 131, s.40, (b) would require construction that would violate requirements or limitations
of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, (c) would, in the view of the Cambridge
Conservation Commission, seriously compromise the wetlands protection objectives of the
Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act), and (d) would result in costs of construction that are
significantly greater than would otherwise be typical for the location were it not in a flood hazard
area; or

(2)

Where the site is contaminated, the construction of a parking facility underground (a) would, in the
opinion of a Licensed Site Professional, pose significant risks to public health or the environment
through disturbance of hazardous materials and could not be reasonably mitigated in accordance
with state and federal regulations, (b) require construction that is prohibited by state or federal
regulations related to hazardous wastes, and (c) would result in costs of construction that would
render the project financially unfeasible; and

(3)

The above ground facility is designed so as to reduce its actual or perceived bulk through, among
other possible techniques, limiting the number of parking spaces it contains, placement of
portions of the facility below grade where feasible, or its location relative to actively occupied
portions of the construction. Construction above grade is discouraged that would increase the
amount of impervious area on the lot.

Amend Section 19.30 to read as follows:
19.30 CITYWIDE URBAN DESIGN OBJECTIVES
The following urban design objectives are intended to provide guidance to property owners and the general public
as to the city's policies with regard to the form and character desirable for new development in the city. It is
understood that application of these principles can vary with the context of specific building proposals in ways that,
nevertheless, fully respect the policies' intent. It is intended that proponents of projects, city staff, the Planning
Board, and the general public, where public review or approval is required, should be open to creative variations
from the detailed provisions presented in this Section as long as the core values expressed are being served. A
project need not meet all the objectives of this Section 19.30 where this Section serves as the basis for issuance of
a special permit. Rather, the permit granting authority shall find that, on balance, the objectives of the city are being
served. Nor shall a project subject to special permit review be required to conform to the Required Building and Site
Plan Requirements set forth in Section 19.50.
Further indicators of conformance with these policy objectives shall be found in planning documents and plans
developed for specific areas of the City or the City as a whole, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the
objectives set forth in this Section 19.30. These documents include the Harvard Square Development Guidelines,
the Central Square Action Plan, the Central Square Development Guidelines, the North Massachusetts Avenue
Urban Design Guidelines Handbook, the University Park at MIT Urban Design Guidelines, the North Point Policy
Plan and Design Guidelines, the Cambridge Institutional Growth Management Plan, the East Cambridge Riverfront
Plan, the Eastern Cambridge Plan, the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines, the Alewife Revitalization, Alewife
Urban Design Study Phase II and its Draft update of 1991, and Toward a Sustainable Future: Cambridge Growth
Policy Document.
19.31 New projects should be responsive to the existing or anticipated pattern of development. Indicators include:
(1) Heights and setbacks provide suitable transition to abutting or nearby residential zoning districts that are
generally developed to low scale residential uses.
(2) New buildings are designed and oriented on the lot so as to be consistent with the established
streetscape on those streets on which the project lot abuts. Streetscape is meant to refer to the pattern of
building setbacks and heights in relationship to public streets.
(3) In mixed-use projects, uses are to be located carefully to respect the context, e.g. retail should front onto
a street, new housing should relate to any adjacent existing residential use, etc.
(4) Where relevant, historical context is respected, e.g. special consideration should be given to buildings
on the site or neighboring buildings that are preferably preserved.
19.32 Development should be pedestrian and bicycle-friendly, with a positive relationship to its surroundings.
Indicators include:

(1) Ground floors, particularly where they face public streets, public parks, and publicly accessible
pathways, consist of spaces that are actively inhabited by people, such as retail stores, consumer service
businesses and restaurants where they are allowed, or general office, educational or residential uses and
building lobbies. Windows and doors that normally serve such inhabited spaces are encouraged to be a
prominent aspect of the relevant building facades. Where a mix of activities are accommodated in a
building, the more active uses are encouraged facing public streets, parks, and pathways.
In commercial districts, such active space consists of retail and consumer service stores and building
lobbies that are oriented toward the street and encourage pedestrian activity on the sidewalk. However, in
all cases such ground floor spaces should be occupied by uses (a) permitted in the zoning district within
which the building is located, (b) consistent with the general character of the environment within which the
structure is located, and (c) compatible with the principal use for which the building is designed.
(2) Covered parking on the lower floors of a building and on-grade open parking, particularly where located
in front of a building, is discouraged where a building faces a public street or public park, and publicly
accessible pathways.
(3) Ground floors should be generally 25-50% transparent. The greatest amounts of glass would be
expected for retail uses with lesser amounts for office, institutional or residential use.
(4) Entries to buildings are located so as to ensure safe pedestrian movement across streets, encourage
walking as a preferred mode of travel within the city and to encourage the use of public transit for
employment and other trips. Relating building entries as directly as possible to crosswalks and to pathways
that lead to bus stops and transit stations is encouraged; siting buildings on a lot and developing site plans
that reinforce expected pedestrian pathways over the lot and through the district is also encouraged.
(5) Pedestrians and bicyclists are able to access the site safely and conveniently; bicyclists should have,
secure weatherproof storage facilities conveniently located on-site. If bicycle parking is provided in a
garage, special attention must be paid to providing safe access to the facilities from the outside.
(6) Alternate means of serving policy objective 19.32 through special building design, siting, or site design
can be anticipated where the building form or use is distinctive such as freestanding parking structures,
large institutional buildings such as churches and auditoriums, freestanding service buildings, power plants,
athletic facilities, manufacturing plants, etc.
19.33 The building and site design should mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a development upon its
neighbors. Indicators include:
(1) Mechanical equipment that is carefully designed, well organized or visually screened from its
surroundings and is acoustically buffered from neighbors. Consideration is given to the size, complexity and
appearance of the equipment, its proximity to residential areas, and its impact on the existing streetscape
and skyline. The extent to which screening can bring order, lessen negative visual impacts, and enhance
the overall appearance of the equipment should be taken into account. More specifically:

(a) Reasonable attempts have been made to avoid exposing rooftop mechanical equipment to
public view from city streets. Among the techniques that might be considered are the inclusion of
screens or a parapet around the roof of the building to shield low ducts and other equipment on the
roof from view.
(b) Treatment of the mechanical equipment (including design and massing of screening devices as
well as exposed mechanical elements) that relates well to the overall design, massing, scale and
character of the building.
(c) Placement of mechanical equipment at locations on the site other than on the rooftop (such as
in the basement) in enclosed locations within the building (if it does not violate the Flood Resilience
Standards in Section 22.80), which reduces the bulk of elements located on the roof; however, atgrade locations external to the building should not be viewed as desirable alternatives and should
be visually and acoustically screened with fencing and/or landscape features wherever they are
necessary.

Existing indicator revised to
reflect Flood Resilience
Standards.

(d) Tall elements, such as chimneys and air exhaust stacks, which are typically carried above

development; however, activities heavily dependent on trucking for supply and distribution are not
encouraged.
19.36 Expansion of the inventory of housing in the city is encouraged. Indicators include:
(1) Housing is a component of any large, multiple building commercial development. Where such
development abuts residential zoning districts substantially developed to low-scale residential uses,
placement of housing within the development such that it acts as a transition/buffer between uses within
and without the development.
(2) Where housing is constructed, providing affordable units exceeding that mandated by the Ordinance.
Targeting larger family-sized middle-income units is encouraged.
19.37 Enhancement and expansion of open space amenities in the city should be incorporated into new
development in the city. Indicators include:
(1) On large-parcel commercial developments, publicly beneficial open space is provided.
(2) Open space facilities are designed to enhance or expand existing facilities or to expand networks of
pedestrian and bicycle movement within the vicinity of the development.
(3) A wider range of open space activities than presently found in the abutting area is provided.
19.38 Development should be resilient to the effects of climate change as anticipated in the Resilient Cambridge
plan published by the City. Indicators include:

project’s anticipated lifespan, including increases in temperature and precipitation and risk of future
flooding.
(2) The project is designed to meet or exceed the Flood Resilience Standard in Section 22.80 of this Zoning
Ordinance and the Green Factor Standard in Section 22.90 of this Zoning Ordinance. Design strategies
may be supplemented by mitigation strategies to manage the effects of flooding and heat where
appropriate.

Task Force recommended adding
a Resilience Objective that notes
that development should be
planned to respond to anticipated
effects of climate change, with
indicators related to flood
protection, heat island mitigation,
passive resilience measures, and
emergency planning.

(3) The design uses resilience strategies that have environmental co-benefits. An example is passive
building envelope design, which promotes occupant comfort during extreme heat and resilience from power
outages due to storms while also reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Another example is
intensive vegetation at grade and on roofs, which provides cooling benefits while improving stormwater
management.
(4) The design takes an integrative approach to climate change resilience that accounts for the existing
context and promotes the other design objectives of the area and the City.

2. A shared facility is established that aids in implementation of effective Transportation Demand
Management measures to reduce dependence on the single occupancy automobile.
3. The facility is well designed, does not diminish the pedestrian-friendly quality the area around it,
and is otherwise consistent with the urban design objective of the Concord-Alewife Plan.
4. The additional bulk of building above grade is well designed and does not have an unreasonably
negative impact on its abutters or the public realm.
5. The extent to which the construction of an above grade parking structure facilitates the creation
of at grade soil permeability.

PLANNING BOARD
CITY HALL ANNEX, 344 BROADWAY, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139

Date:

January 18, 2023

Subject:

Climate Resilience Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board recommends ADOPTION.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On January 10, 2023
Petition
i

a public hearing on a Zoning
by the Planning Board to create

to amend Articles 2.000, 5.000,
19.000, and 22.000 to adjust development standards and urban design objectives with the goal of
promoting resilience to the projected impacts of climate change.
Board members heard a presentation from Community Development Department (CDD) staff,
heard comments from the public, and asked questions of CDD and Department of Public Works
staff. After deliberation, the Board voted in strong support of adoption.
Board members commented on the importance of climate resilience and expressed a sense of
pride that Cambridge is leading the region and the nation in thinking about this topic. The
process of developing this proposal was cited by Board members as exemplary. It brought
together stakeholders to discuss what can be achieved through zoning today, and involved
compromises among different points of view to arrive at a consensus. This Petition represents a
starting point for resilience standards that can be evaluated and considered over time. Board
members also discussed complementary efforts being taken by the City to address climate
resilience, and noted that most existing buildings are not required to meet new zoning standards.
Board members also found the Petition text to be clear and well-crafted given the complexity of
the topic. The Petition takes a thoughtful and systematic approach to codifying resilience
concepts through specific measures such as recoverable building design and tree planting. Many
were incorporated into the Petition. Therefore, the Board does not have suggested revisions.
The Board voted 7-0 to transmit the above recommendation. One member was absent.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.
