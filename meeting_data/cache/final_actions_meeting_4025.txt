To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 22-6, which requested a report on expediting the
demolition and rebuilding permit process in the event of a natural disaster, please be advised of
the following:
Immediately following a natural disaster, the City works closely with affected residents to secure
housing and resources for those impacted. The Cambridge Fire Department Office of Emergency
Planning and Coordination (EPAC) responds to fires and other emergencies which result in the
displacement, either short or long term, of residents and/or businesses. EPAC personnel working
in tandem with Inspectional Services Department, the American Red Cross, the Multi-Service
Center and the City Manager’s Housing Liaison Office, work with the occupants and property
owners to ensure people are provided with assistance in the retrieval of personal property (if safe
to do so), relocation and communications needs.
When initial building permit applications are submitted, the City is in the process of finalizing a
“flagging” process for properties that have been affected by a natural disaster that will initiate an
early notification to staff that a building permit application has been received. Properties that
have been significantly impacted by fire or other natural disasters will be flagged in the City of
Cambridge Permitting and Licensing system <https://cambridgema.viewpointcloud.com/>.
Location flags will enable staff to identify and, if possible, prioritize inspections and approvals.
This will allow staff in multiple departments to track the progress of relevant permits associated
with flagged properties.
In addition to the flagging system, I will be recommending the creation of a new position in the
Inspectional Services Department FY23 budget. This position will include permit coordination
duties, and the new staff member will work both internally with all relevant departments and also
directly with individual applicants throughout the permitting process.
Until the position is filled, individuals can continue to work with my office for assistance with
permit coordination and with staff from the Inspectional Services, Public Works, Historical
Commission and Fire Departments to keep the process moving forward as efficiently as possible.

Packet Pg. 22

1.1

Building permit applications for properties in need of significant work are, in most cases,
submitted long after the actual fire or disaster happens. This is due to the time it takes for
property owners to work with their insurance companies, hire contractors and architects, and any
other related planning needs prior to applying for a building permit. A number of these steps that
must take place prior to the process of acquiring a building permit are not within the City’s
jurisdiction and unfortunately cannot be expedited. Our goal is that with the addition of the new
coordinator position and the “flagging” process, we will be able to minimize delays where we
have the ability to.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am writing to provide you with an update on the MassAve4 project and am asking for your
approval for the approach and timeline for implementing separated bike lanes on these critical
segments of Massachusetts Avenue, as outlined in the attached report and summarized below.
The Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) identified four segments of Massachusetts Avenue where
installing separated bike lanes is challenging due to unique complicating factors, which include
the MBTA’s overhead bus wires, the median and major bus stops. The four segments are
collectively referred to as the MassAve4. The CSO requires that the City Manager and City
Council approve a recommended approach and timeline by May 1, 2022 or separated bike lanes
are required to be installed via quick-build methods.
Recommendation – The recommendation is to
implement separated bike lanes through partial
construction for the segments of Massachusetts
Avenue with the overhead MBTA bus wires and
median (Segments A and B) and full construction
for the Harvard Square bus stops (Segments C and
D). These recommendations were developed through
an extensive community engagement process including
two well-attended virtual meetings, five in person popup events, an on-line survey and review meetings with
the City’s Bike, Pedestrian and Transit Advisory
Committees. City staff, including the Economic
Development Division of the Community Development Department, have also been meeting
with local businesses, business groups, the Commission for Persons with Disabilities and
neighborhood associations to review the Cycling Safety Ordinance. A full summary of the
community engagement process is included in the attached report.
Through the community engagement process, City staff heard strong support for the small
businesses that are a key piece of what makes this corridor so special. The recommended
construction approach removes the median and allows the separated bike lanes to be
implemented and one side of parking to be maintained (if the MBTA overhead bus wires are also
removed). This ability to maintain 40 to 50% of curb uses such as accessible parking, customer
parking, loading, and outdoor dining is one of the key drivers behind the recommendation to
move forward with construction and was strongly supported by the community.

The timeline for completion of the improvements is based on the best available information. As
we work with the community to develop the detailed designs, we will have more information on
the full scope of the projects and also develop a strategy for how best to phase the improvements
to mitigate the impacts of construction. The estimated budget for these projects ($40M for
Segments A & B and $15M for Segments C & D) is being included in the recommended budget
that will be forwarded to the City Council in May.
Status of MBTA Overhead Bus Wires – The MBTA has discontinued the electric trolley
buses, de-energized the overhead bus wires, and appropriated $25,000,000 for the renovations of
the bus facility at Trolley Square to support the Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) that will be
replacing the electric trolley buses. As part of these renovations, the MBTA has committed to
removing the entirety of the overhead system (wires, poles and electrical conduit), but is
currently scoping the work to determine what portions will be completed with in-house crews
and what portions will need to be contracted out. City staff is meeting regularly with the MBTA
to coordinate on our various projects; however, the timeline for the removal of the system is not
yet finalized.
Annual Updates – Beginning in 2023, City staff will provide an annual update on the status of
the MassAve4 projects as part of the annual report to City Council on the implementation of the
Cycling Safety Ordinance.

OVERVIEW

1.2.b

Overview
Mass Ave Segments

The Cycling Safety Ordinance identifies four
segments of Massachusetts Avenue where installing
separated bike lanes is challenging due to unique
complicating factors, which include significant
underground utilities, major bus stops, a center
median, and the MBTA’s overhead bus wires.

Segments A & B include overhead wires that power
trolley buses and provide access to the MBTA’s bus
facility at the north end of the study area. These
overhead wires cause access issues for the Fire
Department, as separated bike lanes with parking
would no longer allow fire trucks to set up under
the wires as they do today. The existence of a center
median in these segments also presents challenges
for emergency response vehicles traveling down the
corridor and limits the ability for travel lanes to be
removed in order to provide parking regardless of
whether the overhead wires are removed.

The four segments, collectively referred to as the
MassAve4 project, are defined as follows:
• Dudley Street to Beech Street (A);
• Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street (B);
• Church Street to Garden Street (C); and
• Plympton Street to Dunster Street (D).

Segments C & D include busy bus stop areas in
Harvard Square where several MBTA bus routes,
as well as Harvard and MASCO shuttles, pick up
and drop off passengers. Several buses also need
to layover or wait between their last stop and first
stop at these locations. As a result, the typical quick
build solutions used at less busy bus stops are not
appropriate.

The City published an impact analysis on the
MassAve4 project in April 2021. This City Council
report summarizes the continued analysis and
community engagement completed since the initial
MassAve4 impact analysis. It evaluates potential
street layouts, and the resulting recommendations,
estimated costs, and proposed timelines for
implementation. The Cycling Safety Ordinance
(CSO) requires the City Council to approve the
recommended approach and timeline by May 1, 2022.

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS A & B

Mass Ave: Segments A & B
Dudley Street to Beech Street (A) & Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street (B)
In Segments A and B, Mass Ave generally features
two travel lanes in each direction, painted bike lanes,
parking, and a concrete median. These segments
also include overhead bus wires that provide power
to trolley buses that travel Mass Ave to access the
MBTA bus facility at Dudley Street. In order to allow
for construction activity for projects in Cambridge
and Watertown, the MBTA has de-energized the
overhead wires along Mass Ave and other streets
for five years. Strategies are currently under
development to ultimately remove the wires and
replace the trolley buses with battery electric buses,
however, the timeline for the removal of the wires is
not yet finalized.
Mass Ave is an important multimodal street for
regional, commercial, and local trips. Approximately
1,100 bicyclists use the Mass Ave corridor during
peak periods. Currently, these segments of Mass Ave
serve three bus routes, providing service to up to
5,700 weekday passengers. These routes experience
significant delay during peak hours, as well as during
other hours of the day. Several intersections along

these segments of Mass Ave feature traffic signals to
help facilitate pedestrian crossings and movements
from side streets. Many of these traffic signals are
located on the median. There are also crosswalks
that are controlled by pedestrian activated flashing
beacons, where the median serves as a crossing
island, providing a safe place for pedestrians
to wait after crossing two lanes of traffic. Some
intersections also provide dedicated vehicle turn
lanes where additional vehicular capacity may be
required.
The curb lane serves different purposes along the
corridor, including parking, commercial loading, bus
stops, and outdoor dining. These existing curbside
uses support the small businesses along Mass Ave
as well as the surrounding neighborhood. Mass Ave
is also a critical utility corridor, providing services
for residents and businesses along Mass Ave and the
broader neighborhood and community. Construction
impacts associated with different design alternatives
and opportunities for utility improvements were
explored at a high level to help evaluate options.

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS A & B

Mass Ave: Segments A & B
Dudley Street to Beech Street (A) & Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street (B)
Three levels of construction were evaluated for
Segments A & B of Mass Ave. Quick build maintains
all existing sidewalks and medians, and implements
separated bike lanes with paint and flex post
barriers. Partial construction would remove the
center median – except at key pedestrian crossing
locations – and sidewalks would remain as they are
today. Full construction involves reconstructing all
of the street infrastructure, including sidewalks and
underground utilities, and provides the opportunity to
construct sidewalk level separated bike lanes, where
feasible.

on both sides while maintaining two travel lanes in
each direction. Parking could change sides along the
corridor where needed. The exact location of parking,
commercial loading, and outdoor dining will be
determined in later stages of design. Opportunities to
provide additional parking on side streets will also be
explored during future project stages.
Potential impacts related to utilities, signals, and
curbside uses were examined at a high level for each
construction scenario to help compare and evaluate
options. A summary of the three construction
scenarios and their impacts is provided below.

If the median and overhead wires are removed,
parking could be provided on one side of the corridor,
but there is not enough space to provide parking

QUICK BUILD (NOT RECOMMENDED)

• Flex-post bike lane separation

• Lowest impact on utilities

• 0-5% parking maintained (accessible spaces
only)

• Shorter implementation timeline (1-2 years)
• Lower overall cost (< $2 million)

• Can accommodate dedicated bus lanes

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS A & B

PARTIAL CONSTRUCTION (RECOMMENDED)

• Flex post or curbed bike lane separation

• No sidewalk upgrades or reconstruction, except
for accessible curb ramps

• Median removed, but upgraded at pedestrian
crossings

• 40-50% parking possible to maintain on one side
of the street if overhead wires are removed

• Can accommodate dedicated bus lanes and
improvements at bus stops

• Medium implementation timeline (4-6 years)

• Upgrades to affected utilities

• Medium cost (approximately $40 million)

FULL CONSTRUCTION (NOT RECOMMENDED)

• Opportunity to provide raised separated bike
lanes

• Major utility upgrades
• 40-50% parking possible to maintain on one side
of the street if overhead wires are removed

• Median removed but upgraded at pedestrian
crossings

• Longer design and implementation timeline (up to
10 years)

• Sidewalk reconstruction and new plantings/
amenities

• Higher cost ($100s of millions)

• Can accommodate dedicated bus lanes and other
transit improvements

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS C & D

Mass Ave: Segments C & D
Church Street to Garden Street (C) & Plympton Street to Dunster Street (D)
Several MBTA bus routes and shuttles servicing
Harvard and the Longwood Medical Area use the
existing stops at Johnston Gate and Holyoke Street.
Over 2,800 MBTA bus riders use the Holyoke stop
on weekdays. The majority of riders exit the bus
here, while bus operators wait to start return trips
to Kendall, Lechmere, or Nubian Square in Boston.
Approximately 800 passengers use the Johnston
Gate stop daily, most of whom are using this stop to
board the bus. The existing bike lanes in this area
are located between the travel lanes and the areas
where buses pull over to service stops.

however, buses share space with bikes at bus
stops. Options to utilize temporary bus islands
to expand bus stop areas past the curb present
accessibility and maintenance challenges and would
not accommodate the high number of bus riders and
bicyclists in these areas. They may also conflict with
existing utilities and are therefore not preferred.
Full construction will allow for bike lanes to be
raised to sidewalk level and for bus stop islands
to be placed next to the curb to reduce conflicts
between bicyclists and boarding or alighting
passengers at each stop.

Two levels of construction were evaluated for
Segments C & D of Mass Ave. Quick build bike lanes
use paint and flex posts to provide separation,

Partial Construction

Partial Construction is recommended for Segments A
& B, as it best meets the needs of the community while
also offering a shorter implementation timeline than
full construction.

Full Construction

Some small segments in constrained areas may
require full construction such as the Walden Street
intersection, which has been considered in the
proposed cost and timeline estimates.

Segments C & D
Full Construction is recommended between Plympton
Street and Garden Street to provide safe and
comfortable facilities for all users through these high

design specifics for each segment. The community will
have multiple ways to provide feedback on the segment
designs through engagement opportunities such as popup events and community meetings. Implementation will
be phased along with other major construction projects
in the city to reduce disruptions during construction.

The schedule and cost estimates provided in this report
are based on the information available at this time.
Detailed construction phasing will be further developed
as the design progresses and we understand more about
the scope of the improvements and impacts on utilities.

Cambridge Growth Policy, Complete Streets Policy, Vision Zero Policy,
Climate Protection Plan and others

We design for people of ALL ages and abilities. This
means including:
• People who many not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible bike lanes that can be used by a wide range of people
• Streets that are safe and accessible for all abilities

Focus is on moving people and goods, not their vehicles
• Buses run less frequently than cars and carry more people
• Cannot ignore access for trucks and local deliveries

How we think about vehicle congestion and delay
• Moving people slowly is moving people safely
• We do not prioritize eliminating delay for people driving alone

3

Project Background
• Cambridge Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires
separated bike lanes along Mass Ave
• For MassAve4 - by April 30, 2022 the City must:
• Present analysis on which sections can be quick-build or
construction
• Obtain approval from the City Council on a construction
timeline for separated bike lane sections not recommended
for quick-build

• Any sections recommended for quick-build must
be installed by April 30, 2023
• If a timeline is not approved by the City Council for
sections recommended for construction, those
sections must be quick-build and installed by
April 30, 2024

Existing Roadway Configuration
• Includes two travel lanes, painted bike lanes, and parking on each
side as well as a concrete median
• Overhead bus wires run along the outside (right) travel lanes to
allow trolley buses to access the MBTA garage. These 600-volt
overhead wires constrain the ability to do construction, and create
challenges for fire access

9

Fire Access
• Ladder truck's position in relation to the overhead bus wires
• Ladder truck is set up in bike lane as close to the curb as possible
• Allows the ladder to be safely positioned under the overhead bus
wires and reach all levels of multi-story buildings
• Under certain fire conditions, the ladder truck is also used to
provide aerial roof access to lower story buildings

Quick-Build
• Quick-build projects use pavement markings, flexposts, signs, and signal changes
• Allow reallocating the roadway space between the
existing curbs
• Can be implemented quickly due to no
construction

17

Quick-Build Considerations
• Consider retaining parking and removing a travel lane
• The overhead bus wires create significant challenges
• Typical floating parking would place a fire truck in what is
now the inside (left) lane. This does not allow the ladder to
reach all levels of multi-story buildings.

Quick-Build Considerations
• Consider retaining parking and removing a travel lane
• Due to the existing median, a single travel lane
would not provide adequate road width for vehicles to move
to allow emergency vehicles to pass
• Significant additional delay for transit

19

Reconstruction
• Construction projects involve more extensive changes
such as moving curbs, relocating or upgrading
utilities, and incorporating landscaping/green
infrastructure
• Would require significant changes to the overhead
bus wires
• Allows reconfiguring the right of way space available
between buildings

• Full reconstruction projects
offer many benefits, but take
years to design and implement
• Consider partial reconstruction
options that limit impacts to
reduce project timeline
• Removal of center median while
maintaining outside curbs
• Relocation or removal of
conflicting utilities (signal
equipment, etc.)

• Would require changes to
the overhead bus wires
21

Reconstruction Considerations
• Full and partial reconstruction
projects must consider the
condition of existing utilities
and the impact of construction
on those utilities
• Responsibility not to
compromise existing utilities
• Opportunity to
address deteriorated
infrastructure
• Complexity of existing utilities
can make "small changes"
more complicated than
anticipated

MassAve4 Engagement – Phase 1 (November 2021)
Overview
To provide information and obtain feedback on the MassAve4 Cycling Safety Ordinance Project (MassAve4), the City of
Cambridge used a multi-pronged strategy involving both digital and in-person outreach. The project website –
https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/publicworks/cityprojects/2021/massave4cyclingsafetyordinanceprojectdu
dleytobeach,roselandtowaterhouse - includes:
•
•
•
•

Links to public engagement materials
An online survey used to obtain feedback
A 12-minute video providing a comprehensive overview of MassAve4
Contact information for a City representative

Some of this information was also available on a flyer that was distributed in the project area and which advertised the
engagement events that took place in November 2021. These engagement events took place at two locations –St. John’s
Church at 2252 Mass Ave, and on the Cambridge Common at Waterhouse Street and Mass Ave – on Saturday,
November 13th (both locations), Monday, November 15th (St. John’s only) and Tuesday, November 16th (Cambridge
Common only). Visitors to the events had several opportunities to learn about MassAve4 and provide feedback. They
could:
•
•
•

Speak with City officials and project team members
View project opportunities, displayed on a tabletop map and poster boards, and provide feedback by indicating
interest with a sticker or a written comment
Fill out and return paper copies of the project survey (these responses were later uploaded to be included along
with the digital responses)

The posters grouped opportunities into the following categories:
•
•
•

Quick-build (no construction or changes to the curb)
Partial-build (some construction, such as removal of the median or interventions regarding the overhead wires)
Full reconstruction (construction/changes to the curb involved)

After the first day of engagement, it was determined an additional board relating specifically to parking would be
beneficial, and this board was available at the final two
sessions on Monday and Tuesday.

Key Findings

THE TWO MOST PROMINENT THEMES FROM

The majority of recorded feedback received, by volume,
was via the dot stickers placed on poster boards. While
the color of these dot stickers was not intended to have
meaning, some participants indicated that they used red
dots to indicate they opposed something and green dots
if they supported something. As such, the number of dots
placed next to each opportunity is not necessarily a good
measure of support, but rather of interest, whether
positive or negative.

THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT RESULTS ARE
IMPROVING INTERMODAL SAFETY AND
PRESERVING ACCESS TO LOCAL BUSINESSES,
SEEN AS THE HEART OF MASS AVE. A DESIGN
MUST INCORPORATE THESE THEMES,
BALANCING THE NEEDS ACROSS DIFFERENT
MODES, AS DRIVING, WALKING, BIKING AND

Takeaways from Boards
• Bike lanes generated the most interest

TAKING TRANSIT ARE ALL COMMON.

•
•

Customer and short-term parking received the most dots of any parking categories
Transit- and utility-focused opportunities received relatively less interest

Takeaways from Map Comments
• Numerous crosswalks and areas of the existing bike lane were identified as dangerous
• The most noted specific location is the area of westbound Mass Ave near Walden where the bike lane
disappears
• General comments indicated:
o Support for keeping parking for businesses;
o Support for separated bike lanes; and
o Concern for the ability of the street to serve the elderly and disabled
Takeaways from Surveys
Multiple choice survey questions asked respondents how they traveled on and otherwise used Mass Ave, while openended questions asked about favorite aspects of Mass Ave, challenging locations, and locations that work well. There
was also a fully open-ended question where respondents could leave additional comments. Multiple choice questions
were sorted by answer, while open-ended responses were analyzed and placed into categories based on the general
concern of the comment (and not necessarily whether the comment was in support or opposition).
•
•

•

•

Driving and walking were the most popular modes, at 78% and 76% respectively, with biking third at 50% of
respondents
The most popular other uses of Mass Ave were overwhelmingly shopping and dining, at 86% and 84%
respectively
o This sentiment was echoed in the open-ended responses to “favorite thing on Mass Ave,” where 81%
mentioned something related to shopping or business
Biking was the most common topic referenced for both what is challenging on Mass Ave and what works well
on Mass Ave. In general, respondents found areas without separated bike lanes challenging and found areas
with separated bike lanes to work well.
In the remaining survey questions, the most common responses discussed aspects of biking, specific
intersections, or walking/pedestrian infrastructure

Common Themes
Across the multiple engagement formats, the following topics emerged as key themes:
•
•
•

Bike lanes
Parking for businesses
Improving pedestrian infrastructure, specifically at crosswalks

between cars and cyclists

Transit Facilities
These include transit-only lanes,
queue jump lanes, or transitspecific signals

Bus Stop
Improvements
Bus stop improvements, such as
installing transit shelters or seating

Off-peak Loading

Crossing Islands

Regulations can dedicate space for
loading for businesses on Mass Ave
during the off-peak hours

Enhanced crossing islands can
provide more comfortable and
accessible places of refuge for
pedestrians crossing Mass Ave

Pick-up/Drop-off
Zones
Providing spaces for taxis and
rideshares to pick up and drop off
passengers can keep these uses
from encroaching on parking or
bike lanes

Outdoor Dining
Parking spaces can be re-purposed

What drives our street design?
We design for people of ALL ages and abilities. This
means including:
• People who many not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible facilities, including bike lanes, that can be used by a
wide range of people

How we think about vehicle congestion and delay
• Moving people slowly is moving people safely
• We do not prioritize eliminating delay for people driving alone

Many policies and plans are foundational to our work
• 1) 1992 Cambridge Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance, 2) 1993/2007
Cambridge Growth Policy, 3) 2016 Complete Streets Policy, 4) 2016 Vision
Zero Policy

Focus is on moving people and goods, not their vehicles
• Buses run less frequently than cars and carry more people
• Cannot ignore access for trucks and local deliveries

3

Why Separated Bike Lanes?
• Fewer crashes
• Eliminates threat of “dooring” from
parked vehicles
• Buffer space reduces conflicts between
turning vehicles and people biking
• Shorter crossing distances for people
walking
• Increased comfort for people biking of
all ages and abilities
• Increased comfort for people driving as
they know where to expect people
biking
• Enables more people to choose cycling
as a transportation option
• Supports City’s climate goals

MBTA Overhead Wires
• Overhead wires power trackless
trolley buses along Mass Ave
• Overhead wires present design
challenges for access to
buildings by the fire department
• Design options must ensure no
conflicts between ladder trucks
and overhead wires

7

MBTA Overhead Wire Status
• Beginning March 2022, MBTA will de-energize the
overhead wires on Mass Ave for five years to accommodate
construction projects in Cambridge and Watertown
• MBTA is proposing to convert the trolley buses to Battery
Electric Buses (BEBs) and remove the overhead wires. The
timeline for removal is currently unknown
• Removing the overhead wires provides significantly more
flexibility for design options

Design Opportunities
• Recall the three levels of
construction that could be
considered:
1. Quick Build – paint and flex
posts, maintain median and
sidewalks
2. Partial Construction –
removal of center median,
paving and upgrades to
affected utilities
3. Full Construction – median
removal, street/sidewalk
reconstruction and full utility
upgrades

Feasibility Considerations
• There are many possible configurations for Mass
Ave based on the available space
• For these segments of Mass Ave, special
consideration for emergency and fire access is
required due to the median and overhead wires
• Other considerations include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Safety for people walking
Safety for people biking
Transit efficiency
Parking/curbside access for businesses
Utility impacts
Implementation timeline

15

Infeasible Options
• Several options were reviewed but deemed
infeasible and therefore not advanced:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Parking along the median
Bike or bus lanes along the median
Two-way bike lane on one side
Wider landscaped median
One lane and parking on each side with median
Two lanes and parking on each side without median

• These options do not:
• Allow for safe and intuitive use of the street by all users;
• Allow emergency services to travel down the corridor
and access buildings unimpeded; and/or
• Fit within the available space.

What drives our street design?
Many policies and plans are foundational to our work
• Cycling Safety Ordinance, Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance,
Cambridge Growth Policy, Complete Streets Policy, Vision Zero Policy,
Climate Protection Plan and others

We design for people of ALL ages and abilities. This
means including:
• People who many not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible bike lanes that can be used by a wide range of people
• Streets that are safe and accessible for all abilities

Focus is on moving people and goods, not their vehicles
• Buses run less frequently than cars and carry more people
• Cannot ignore access for trucks and local deliveries

How we think about vehicle congestion and delay
• Moving people slowly is moving people safely
• We do not prioritize eliminating delay for people driving alone

15

Why Separated Bike Lanes?
• Fewer crashes
• Eliminates threat of “dooring” from
parked vehicles
• Buffer space reduces conflicts between
turning vehicles and people biking
• Shorter crossing distances for people
walking
• Increased comfort for people of all
ages and abilities who are biking
• Increased comfort for people driving as
they know where to expect people
biking
• Enables more people to choose cycling
as a transportation option
• Supports City’s climate goals
• Supports Public Health goals

Project Background
• Cambridge Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires
separated bike lanes along Mass Ave
• For MassAve4 - by April 30, 2022 the City must:
• Present analysis on which sections can be quick-build, and
which sections require construction
• Obtain approval from the City Council on a construction
timeline for separated bike lane sections not recommended
for quick-build

• Any sections recommended for quick-build must
be installed by April 30, 2023
• If a timeline is not approved by the City Council for
sections recommended for construction, those
sections must be quick-build and installed by
April 30, 2024

Existing Bus Layovers
• Buses often need to wait,
or ‘layover’, between the
last stop of a trip and first
stop of the next one.
• This time is needed as a
buffer so that the next trip
starts on schedule.

• Three MBTA routes end
and begin at the Holyoke
Gate stop.
• Space for at least two and
up to four buses to wait in
this area is needed for the
routes here.

Quick Build vs Construction
• Quick build bike lanes use
paint and flex posts to
provide separation
• Buses share space with bikes
at bus stops

• Temporary bus islands
expand bus stop area past
the curb
• May conflict with utilities
• Present accessibility and
maintenance issues
• Would not accommodate the
high number of bus riders and
cyclists in this area

27

Quick Build vs Construction
• Construction allows for bike
lanes to be raised and for
bus stop islands to be placed
next to the curb
• Due to heavy bus activity and
need for layovers, quick
build bike lanes are not
recommended
• Construction is
recommended between
Plympton Street and Garden
Street

MassAve4 Engagement – Phase 2 (February-March 2022)
Overview
The City of Cambridge conducted Phase 2 of public engagement for the MassAve4 Cycling Safety Ordinance Project
(MassAve4) in February and March 2022, as a follow up to Phase 1 (November 2021). In Phase 1, public feedback was
obtained through both virtual and in-person public outreach and was used to develop an evaluation framework for the
possible design options – including Quick-Build, Partial Construction, and Full Construction scenarios. The project team
evaluated the feasibility of the design options to develop design recommendations based on community feedback from
Phase 1.
For Phase 2 of public engagement, the City continued its multi-pronged approach to obtain feedback on the draft
recommendations and to understand if the project team missed any important considerations in the evaluation process.
Over 19,000 postcards (attached) were distributed to residents and businesses to notify the community of the public
meeting schedule. Phase 2 focused on all four segments of the MassAve4 project and the respective design
recommendations:
•
•

Partial Construction for Segments A&B (Dudley to Beech and Roseland to Waterhouse)
Full Construction for Segments C&D (Church to Garden and Plympton to Dunster)

Phase 2 consisted of both virtual and in-person opportunities to provide input on the proposed recommendations,
including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

MassAve4 (A&B) Presentation to the City of Cambridge’s Joint Bike/Pedestrian/Transit Advisory Committee
(Tri Committee) – February 16, 2022 (Virtual)

An online survey
Direct emails to DPW with comments and questions prior to the virtual meetings

To ensure community-informed recommendations to the Cambridge City Council, the project team asked for feedback
through two questions:
1. Did we miss anything?
2. What are your thoughts about our recommendations to proceed with Partial Construction for Segments A&B,
and Full Construction for Segments C&D?

Key Findings
Through the Phase 2 engagement process, the City continued to work with community stakeholders to confirm the
technical viability of the design recommendations, while obtaining overall public support for Partial Construction for
A&B and Full Construction for C&D through public outreach. These design recommendations meet the goals of the
Cambridge Cycling Ordinance (CSO) while recognizing the community’s desires to improve intermodal safety and
preserve access to local businesses – themes that have been expressed throughout both phases of the public
engagement process. The public had questions and concerns regarding specific locations and design elements, however,
the City reminded the community that the project is still in the feasibility phase. The City will assess these specific
concerns in the design phase should the recommendation for Partial Construction gain approval from Cambridge City
Council.

The Tri Committee provided the project team with feedback on the proposed design approach for Segments A&B, while
the community meetings, pop-up event, and online surveys
provided opportunities for community members to voice their
Key Themes
opinions and ask questions. Key takeaways from each
➢ Community support for recommendations:
component of Phase 2 are included below:

o A&B: Partial Construction

Tri Committee Takeaways
o C&D: Full Construction
• While some stakeholders would like to see the changes
➢ Specific design concerns will be addressed in
made as fast as possible through Quick-Build,
the design phase
stakeholders expressed support for Partial Construction ➢ Stakeholders stress the need to prioritize
for A&B, as it meets the goals of the CSO, maintains
multimodal safety and access to parking for
more of the existing on-street parking than a Quick
local businesses
Build allows; and, improves pedestrian, bike, and transit
infrastructure.
• It was noted by some participants that Full Construction would meet more multimodal objectives, but
acknowledged it would take over 10 years to implement. Participants also expressed an understanding that
some roadway changes could have more significant impacts on sub-surface utilities so the Partial Construction
scenario allows for utilities to be accounted for as needed.
Community Meeting Takeaways
•

•

•

•

A key theme from the community meetings were questions and comments related to specific locations and
design elements. However, the project is in the feasibility phase and will not move forward until the Cambridge
City Council weighs in on the recommendation to proceed with a Partial Construction design option. City staff
reminded the public that specific design questions will be addressed in the subsequent design phase, and these
types of questions do not affect the overall feasibility of the build recommendations. Examples of questions
include:
o “How will loss of parking be identified?”
o “How will the City handle snow plowing on bike lanes?”
o “Will bike parking be expanded?”
Comment cards and poster comments demonstrate overall support for the build recommendations (Partial
Construction for A&B, Full Construction for C&D) over other build options.
o Both recommended options help increase safety for all users, while the Partial Construction
recommendation for A&B helps maintain sufficient parking for local businesses.
There were questions and comments regarding the prioritization of one mode of travel over another. The City
reiterated the goal is to move people as safely (not as quickly) as possible, balancing the needs of all roadway
users.
Questions related to transit, specifically MBTA buses and the overhead catenary wires, are part of the design
considerations for the project, as the project team is looking at all roadway users within the design
considerations – driving, transit, walking, biking.

Survey Takeaways
• Broad support for the Partial Construction recommendation for A&B – very few responses preferred the Quick
Build scenario. While some would prefer Full Construction, they view Partial Construction as a good
compromise.
• Continued concern was expressed from Phase 1 engagement regarding impacts to local businesses, especially
relating to availability of on-street parking

Project Background
Our Street
Design Principles
Mass Ave safety improvements are based
on two key principles:
Designing for people of ALL ages and
abilities, including:
• People who may not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible facilities, including bike lanes,
that can be used by a wide range of people

Rethinking vehicle congestion and delay

Backed by Policy
Many other multimodal safety policies
and plans—including the Cycling Safety
Ordinance—led to this project:
1. Cambridge Vehicle Trip Reduction
Ordinance (1992)
2. Cambridge Growth Policy (1993/2007)
3. Complete Streets Policy (2016)
4. Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance

• Slow movement is safe movement

5. Parking & Transportation Demand Ordinance

• Eliminating delay for people driving alone is not
the top priority

6. Climate Protection Plan

• Move people and goods, not their vehicles

8. School Wellness Policy

7. Growth Policy Document Update

Cycling Safety Ordinance (2020)
• Requires the installation of separated bike lanes in certain
parts of the city
• Set deadline of April 30 for quick-build projects on
Mass Ave – Porter Square is the only remaining
quick-build project on Mass Ave

Porter Square versus Mass4
Porter Square and the Mass4 are separate projects. The
Mass4 are four sections of Mass Ave that will get separated
bike lanes but on a slightly longer timeframe. Porter Square
from Roseland St to Beech St is not part of the Mass4.

Design Opportunities

Project Background
Cambridge Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires separated bike lanes along Mass Ave
There are four segments of Mass Ave where implementing quick build bike lanes would be more
challenging due to complicating factors, such as overhead wires and busy bus stops. These segments are
referred to as the MassAve4.

Recall the three levels of construction
that could be considered:
1. Quick Build – paint and flex posts,
maintain median and sidewalks

Re:

Awaiting Report #22-10, Policy Order 5, dated February 28, 2022, on conducting
a study to collect relevant economic data relating to business impacts from bike
lane installations

In response to this order, the Community Development Department’s Economic
Development Division, in collaboration with other City departments, has begun working
on a scope of services to hire a consultant to help gather data and conduct this analysis.
We expect that the consultant will develop a methodology on conducting its research
and consider a variety of data used in bike lane installation economic analyses. The
metrics should include data that is easy to acquire, updated quarterly or annually,
objective, and quantitative. The consultant could consider data such as sales and meal
tax, pedestrian/bike counts, and sidewalk and in-store customer intercept surveys.
Because the small business economy is multifaceted, it’s important to note that changes
in sales for individual businesses can be the result of many different factors, and street
design is just one of them. Therefore, we will want the consultant to approach the study
accordingly, and include the following evaluations in their analysis:
1. capture data from commercial corridors where separated bike lanes have yet to
be installed to enable ‘before and after’ comparisons, as appropriate, and
2. evaluate comparable previous separated bike lane installations.
We also know that it is important to look at data sets over time, rather than just single
’pre-installation’ and immediate 'post-installation' points. By capturing data that is
accurate, easy to gather over time, and objective, the study can best evaluate impacts.

the Community Development and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation departments, in
collaboration with other City departments including Assessing, Law, Public Works, and

the hiring of a consultant to conduct it. It is anticipated that some data collection will
begin this spring, with an initial economic analysis report done by fall 2022. In addition
to the economic data study, Economic Development will continue to work with all
business associations and individual businesses to discuss possible mitigation efforts as
the Cycling Safety Ordinance implementation continues.

Awaiting Report #21-70, Policy Order #4 dated October 18, 2021
regarding the feasibility of purchasing property from Lesley University
to address City goals.

In response to the above referenced Policy Order, we submit the following.
When Lesley University announced its new Campus Plan last fall, and then offered
several buildings for sale, Community Development Department (CDD) staff worked
with local affordable housing builders to determine if it would be feasible to create
new affordable housing at any of the properties. This achievement is the direct
result of the collective efforts of numerous City staff, the Mayor and City Council,
Homeowner’s Rehabilitation, Inc., the Affordable Housing Trust, and Lesley
University.
We are pleased to report that Lesley University has agreed to sell its property at
1627 Massachusetts Avenue to Homeowners Rehab, Inc. (HRI) so that HRI can
create new affordable housing there. The Affordable Housing Trust will finance this
acquisition, which we expect to be completed in the coming months.
CDD Housing staff and the affordable housing builders looked at several of the
available properties and determined that the property at 1627 Massachusetts
Avenue presented a unique opportunity to add new affordable housing in the
Baldwin neighborhood. The site consists of a historic building on a 14,400 s.f. lot and
presents an opportunity for residential development (market or affordable) given
the zoning potential of the site. The development potential of the site makes it quite
valuable on the market. We discussed this at great length with HRI, the Affordable
Housing Trust, and Lesley University. We are pleased that HRI was able to offer an
amount that the University accepted from among other offers, and that the
Affordable Housing Trust approved funding for the full amount of HRI’s pending
purchase.

Housing staff are now working with HRI to prepare for their purchase of the
property. Once the purchase is complete, HRI will begin planning for development
of the property as affordable housing. The plan will be to renovate the existing
structure for residential use and to build additional homes on the rear portion of the
lot. HRI will hold community meetings and work with City staff as it begins to
develop its plans to ensure the best possible outcome for the community.

Date:

Subject:

Alewife Overlay Development Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board RECOMMENDS adoption, with additional
considerations.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On March 8, 2022, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss a Zoning
Petition by the City Council to amend Section 20.90 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to
temporarily prohibit office and laboratory uses listed in Table 4.34 in Alewife Overlay Districts
1-6 until December 31st, 2023, or “…until such time as new Alewife District zoning is ordained
by the Cambridge City Council, whichever shall be sooner” (the “Petition”). The Board heard a
presentation from Councillor Carlone and Councillor Nolan, representing the petitioners, and
received written materials from staff in the City’s Community Development Department (CDD).
Following the presentation, public comment, and discussion among Board members, the
Planning Board voted to transmit a favorable recommendation on this Petition to the City
Council, with some additional comments. The Board was generally supportive of the concept of
a pause in development in the Alewife districts for the purpose of developing appropriate zoning.
Many Board members expressed that it should be done urgently and with speed, and that a
shorter one-year prohibition may be more appropriate given the recent completion of the
Envision Alewife Planning study in 2019 and the general availability of existing urban design
and zoning analysis. The Petition should additionally clarify that the prohibition is intended for
all “new” office and laboratory development, as it might be read to also impact existing buildings
and uses.
Some Board members questioned whether the pause should be a true moratorium applicable to
all new development, and not limited to specific use categories. That approach might be more
fair and might help lend a sense of urgency to implementing final zoning. However, other Board
members noted that such a change could require readvertising the Petition and holding additional
hearings, which would take more time.
Board members encouraged additional input from the Law Department on the issue described
above as well as the following questions:
•

Because it is written to temporarily prohibit all office and laboratory uses, how would the
Petition impact existing office or laboratory uses that might propose modifications, as

1.5.a

well as buildings or uses that have received a special permit or building permit but not a
certificate of occupancy?
•

Are there limitations on the length of a temporary use prohibition, and can it later be
extended? Some Board members expressed concerns that the prohibition might be
extended beyond the specified timeframe if there is no resolution on final zoning.

•

The Petition only affects one group of uses, and additional “carve-outs” were suggested
during the public hearing that might make exceptions for development meeting certain
criteria. How could such “carve-outs” affect the enforceability of the Petition?

•

If this Petition impacts property values, potentially benefitting some property owners
over others, does this raise specific concerns over the legal defensibility of the Petition?

The Planning Board voted with 6 members in favor of transmitting the above recommendation.
One member voted “present,” and two members were absent.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

In addition to the above criteria set forth in the statute, the Draft Compliance
Guidelines provide additional detail on how to apply the “reasonable size”
standard. One standard is that for communities served by rapid transit, a district of
“reasonable size” would need to allow a number of multifamily housing units
equal to 25% of the community’s existing housing stock.

DHCD led a Stakeholder Engagement Process, which ended on March 31, 2022,
to discuss the Draft Guidelines. Final Guidelines are expected to be issued in the
summer of 2022.
Pending the release of the Final Guidelines, communities are required to complete
three tasks no later than May 2, 2022: Present the Draft Guidelines to the City
Council, ensure submission of the most up-to-date GIS parcel maps to MassGIS,
and submit a basic MBTA Community Information Form to DHCD.
After the release of the Final Guidelines, communities will be required to submit
either an “Action Plan” or a “Request for Compliance Determination” to DHCD
no later than December 31, 2022. At that time, City staff will perform an
evaluation of our compliance according to the Final Guidelines, continue working
with DHCD staff to respond to questions, and provide additional updates to the
City Council.

DRAFT Compliance Guidelines for Multi-family Districts
Under Section 3A of the Zoning Act

1.

Overview of Section 3A of the Zoning Act

Section 18 of chapter 358 of the Acts of 2020 added a new section 3A to chapter 40A of the
General Laws (the Zoning Act) applicable to MBTA communities (referred to herein as “Section 3A”).
Subsection (a) of Section 3A provides:
An MBTA community shall have a zoning ordinance or by-law that provides for at least 1
district of reasonable size in which multi-family housing is permitted as of right; provided,
however, that such multi-family housing shall be without age restrictions and shall be
suitable for families with children. For the purposes of this section, a district of reasonable
size shall: (i) have a minimum gross density of 15 units per acre, subject to any further
limitations imposed by section 40 of chapter 131 and title 5 of the state environmental code
established pursuant to section 13 of chapter 21A; and (ii) be located not more than 0.5
miles from a commuter rail station, subway station, ferry terminal or bus station, if
applicable.
The purpose of Section 3A is to encourage MBTA communities to adopt zoning districts where
multi-family zoning is permitted as of right, and that meet other requirements set forth in the statute.
The Department of Housing and Community Development, in consultation with the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, is required to
promulgate guidelines to determine if an MBTA community is in compliance with Section 3A. DHCD
promulgated preliminary guidance on January 29, 2021. DHCD updated that preliminary guidance on
December 15, 2021. These guidelines provide further information on how MBTA communities may
achieve compliance with Section 3A.

3.

General Principles of Compliance

a.
These compliance guidelines describe how an MBTA community can comply with the
requirements of Section 3A. The guidelines specifically address:


What it means to permit multi-family housing “as of right”;



The metrics that determine if a multi-family district is “of reasonable size”;



How to determine if a multi-family district has a minimum gross density of 15 units per acre,
subject to any further limitations imposed by section 40 of chapter 131 and title 5 of the state
environmental code;



The meaning of Section 3A’s mandate that “such multi-family housing shall be without age
restrictions and shall be suitable for families with children”; and



The extent to which MBTA communities have flexibility to choose the location of a multifamily district.

b.

The following general principles have informed the more specific compliance criteria that

follow:


All MBTA communities should contribute to the production of new housing stock.



MBTA communities with subway stations, commuter rail stations and other transit stations
benefit from having these assets located within their boundaries and should provide
opportunity for multi-family housing development around these assets. MBTA communities
with no transit stations within their boundaries nonetheless benefit from being close to transit
stations in nearby communities.



MBTA communities should adopt multi-family districts that will lead to development of multifamily housing projects of a scale, density and character that are consistent with a community’s
long-term planning goals.

Attachment: Draft Guidelines for MBTA Communities 4-11-22 (CMA 2022 #78 : MBTA Communities Draft Guidelines)

“Rapid transit community” means an MBTA community with a subway station within its borders,
or within 0.5 mile of its border. An MBTA community with a subway station within its borders, or within
0.5 mile of its border, shall be deemed to be a rapid transit community even if there is one or more
commuter rail stations or MBTA bus lines located in that community.

3
Packet Pg. 121

4.



“Reasonable size” is a relative rather than an absolute determination. Because of the diversity
of MBTA communities, a multi-family district that is “reasonable” in one city or town may not
be reasonable in another city or town. Objective differences in community characteristics must
be considered in determining what is “reasonable” for each community.



To the maximum extent possible, multi-family districts should be in areas that have safe and
convenient access to transit stations for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Allowing Multi-Family Housing “As of Right”

To comply with Section 3A, a multi-family district must allow multi-family housing “as of right,”
meaning that the construction and occupancy of multi-family housing is allowed in that district without
the need to obtain any discretionary permit or approval. Site plan review and approval may be required
for multi-family uses allowed as of right. Site plan review is a process by which a local board reviews a
project’s site layout to ensure public safety and convenience. Site plan approval may regulate matters
such as vehicular access and circulation on a site, architectural design of a building, and screening of
adjacent properties. Site plan review may not be used to deny a project that is allowed as of right, nor may
it impose conditions that make it infeasible or impractical to proceed with a multi-family use that is
allowed as of right.
5.

Determining “Reasonable Size”

In making determinations of “reasonable size,” DHCD will take into consideration both the area of
the district and the district’s multi-family unit capacity (that is, the number of units of multi-family
housing that can be developed as of right within the district).
a.

Minimum land area

Section 3A’s requirement that a multi-family district be a “reasonable size” indicates that the
purpose of the statute is to encourage zoning that allows for the development of a reasonable amount of
multi-family housing in each MBTA community. A zoning district is a specifically delineated land area
with uniform regulations and requirements governing the use of land and the placement, spacing, and size
of buildings. A district should not be a single development site on which the municipality is willing to
permit a particular multi-family project. To comply with Section 3A’s “reasonable size” requirement,
multi-family districts must comprise at least 50 acres of land—or approximately one-tenth of the land area
within 0.5 mile of a transit station.
An overlay district is an acceptable way to achieve compliance with Section 3A, provided that
such an overlay district should not consist of a collection of small, non-contiguous parcels. At least one
portion of the overlay district land areas must include at least 25 contiguous acres of land. No portion of
the district that is less than 5 contiguous acres land will count toward the minimum size requirement.
b.

Minimum multi-family unit capacity

A reasonably sized multi-family district must also be able to accommodate a reasonable number of
multi-family housing units as of right. MBTA communities seeking a determination of compliance with
Section 3A must provide to DHCD an accurate assessment of the number of multi-family housing units
that can be developed as of right within the multi-family district, referred to as the district’s unit capacity.

Minimum multi-family units as a

The minimum unit capacity applicable to each MBTA community is determined by multiplying
the number of housing units in that community by 0.25, 0.20, 0.15 or 0.10, depending on the type of
service in that community. For example, a rapid transit community with 7,500 housing units is required to
have a multi-family district with a multi-family unit capacity of 7,500 x 0.25 = 1,875 multi-family units.
When calculating the minimum unit capacity, each MBTA community should use 2020 census data to
determine the number of total housing units, unless another data source has been approved by DHCD.
When determining the unit capacity for a specific multi-family district, each MBTA community
must estimate how many units of multi-family housing could be constructed on each parcel of developable
land within the district. The estimate should take into account the amount of developable land in the
district, as well as the height limitations, lot coverage limitations, maximum floor area ratio, set back
requirements and parking space requirements applicable in that district under the zoning ordinance or
bylaw. The estimate must also take into account the restrictions and limitations set forth in any other
municipal bylaws or ordinances; limitations on development resulting from inadequate water or
wastewater infrastructure, and, in areas not served by public sewer, any applicable limitations under Title
5 of the state environmental code or local septic regulations; known title restrictions on use of the land
within the district; and known limitations, if any, on the development of new multi-family housing within
the district based on physical conditions such the presence of waterbodies, and wetlands.
If the estimate of the number of multi-family units that can be constructed in the multi-family
district is less than the minimum unit capacity, then the MBTA community must change the boundaries of
the multi-family district or make changes to dimensional regulations applicable to that district (or to other
local ordinances or bylaws) to allow for the development of a greater number of multi-family units as of
right.
It is important to understand that a multi-family district’s unit capacity is not a mandate to
construct a specified number of housing units, nor is it a housing production target. Section 3A requires
only that each MBTA community has a multi-family zoning district of reasonable size. The law does not
require the production of new multi-family housing units within that district. There is no requirement nor
expectation that a multi-family district will be built out to its full unit capacity.
In some communities, there may be a significant number of multi-family units already existing in
the multi-family district; those communities should generally expect fewer new units to be produced in the
district, because it is more fully built out. Conversely, there may be some communities with relatively
little multi-family housing in its multi-family district; there generally will be more opportunity for new

Attachment: Draft Guidelines for MBTA Communities 4-11-22 (CMA 2022 #78 : MBTA Communities Draft Guidelines)

A compliant district’s multi-family unit capacity must be equal to or greater than a specified percentage of
the total number of housing units within the community. The required percentage will depend on the type
of transit service in the community, as follows:

Packet Pg. 123

1.6.b

housing production in those districts in which there is a large gap between unit capacity and the number of
existing multi-family units.
Minimum Gross Density

Section 3A states that a compliant multi-family district must have a minimum gross density of 15
units per acre, subject to any further limitations imposed by section 40 of chapter 131 and title 5 of the
state environmental code established pursuant to section 13 of chapter 21A. DHCD will deem a zoning
district to be compliant with Section 3A’s minimum gross density requirement if the following criteria are
met.
a. District-wide gross density
Section 3A expressly requires that a multi-family district—not just the individual parcels of land
within the district—must have a minimum gross density of 15 units per acre, subject to any further
limitations imposed by section 40 of chapter 131 and title 5 of the state environmental code established
pursuant to section 13 of chapter 21A. To comply with this requirement, the zoning must legally and
practically allow for a district-wide gross density of 15 units per acre. The Zoning Act defines “gross
density” as “a units-per-acre density measurement that includes land occupied by public rights-of-way and
any recreational, civic, commercial and other nonresidential uses.”
To meet the district-wide gross density the municipality must demonstrate that the zoning for the
district permits a gross density of 15 units per acre of land within the district, “include[ing] land occupied
by public rights-of-way and any recreational, civic, commercial and other nonresidential uses.” By way of
example, to meet that requirement for a 50-acre multi-family district, the municipality must show at least
15 existing or potential new multi-family units per acre, or a total of at least 750 existing or potential new
multi-family units.
b. Achieving district-wide gross density by sub-districts
Zoning ordinances and bylaws typically limit the unit density on individual parcels of land. To
comply with the statute’s density requirement, an MBTA community may establish sub-districts within a
multi-family district, with different density requirements and limitations for each sub-district, provided
that the gross density for the district as a whole meets the statutory requirement of not less than 15 multifamily units per acre.
7.

Determining Suitability for Families with Children

Section 3A states that a compliant multi-family district must be without age restrictions and must
be suitable for families with children. DHCD will deem a multi-family district to comply with these
requirements as long as the zoning does not require multi-family uses to include units with age restrictions
and does not place any limits or restrictions on the size of the units, the number of bedrooms, the size of
bedrooms, or the number of occupants.

1.6.b

8.

Location of Districts

a. General rule for measuring distance from a transit station.
To maximize flexibility for all MBTA communities, the distance from a transit station may be
measured from the boundary of any parcel of land owned by a public entity and used for purposes related
to the transit station, such as an access roadway or parking lot.
b. MBTA communities with some land area within 0.5 miles of a transit station
An MBTA community that has a transit station within its boundaries, or some land area within 0.5
mile of a transit station located in another MBTA community, shall comply with the statutory location
requirement if a substantial portion of the multi-family district is located within the prescribed distance.
Absent compelling circumstances, at least [one half] of the land area of the multi-family district should be
located within 0.5 mile of the transit station. The multi-family district may include land areas that are
further than 0.5 mile from the transit station, provided that such areas are easily accessible to the transit
station based on existing street patterns and pedestrian connections.
In unusual cases, the most appropriate location for a multi-family district may be in a land area that
is further than 0.5 miles of a transit station. Where none of the land area within 0.5 mile of transit station
is appropriate for development of multi-family housing—for example, because it comprises wetlands or
land publicly owned for recreation or conservation purposes—the MBTA community may propose a
multi-family use district that has less than one-half of its land area within 0.5 miles of a transit station. To
the maximum extent feasible, the land areas within such a district should be easily accessible to the transit
station based on existing street patterns, pedestrian connections, and bicycle lanes.
c. MBTA communities with no land area within 0.5 miles of a transit station
When an MBTA community has no land area within 0.5 mile of a transit station, the multi-family
district should, if feasible, be located in an area with reasonable access to a transit station based on
existing street patterns, pedestrian connections, and bicycle lanes, or in an area that otherwise is consistent
with the Commonwealth’s sustainable development principles—for example, near an existing downtown
or village center, near an RTA bus stop or line, or in a location with existing under-utilized facilities that
can be redeveloped into new multi-family housing.
9.

Determinations of Compliance

DHCD will make determinations of compliance with Section 3A upon request from an MBTA
community, in accordance with the following criteria and schedule. An MBTA community may receive a
determination of full compliance when it has a multi-family district that meets all of the requirements of
Section 3A. An MBTA community may receive a determination of interim compliance for a limited
duration to allow time to enact a new multi-family district or amend an existing zoning district in order to
achieve full compliance with Section 3A.

Attachment: Draft Guidelines for MBTA Communities 4-11-22 (CMA 2022 #78 : MBTA Communities Draft Guidelines)

Section 3A states that a compliant multi-family district shall “be located not more than 0.5 miles
from a commuter rail station, subway station, ferry terminal or bus station, if applicable.” DHCD will
interpret that requirement consistent with the following guidelines.

Packet Pg. 125

1.6.b

When an MBTA community believes it has a multi-family district that complies with the
requirements for Section 3A, as set forth in these guidelines, it may request a determination of compliance
from DHCD. Such a request may be made for a multi-family district that was in existence on the date that
Section 3A became law, or for a multi-family district that was created or amended after the enactment of
Section 3A. In either case, such request shall be made on a form required by DHCD and shall include, at
a minimum, the following information, which shall be provided in a format or on a template prescribed by
DHCD:
General district information

An attestation that the application is accurate and complete, signed by the MBTA
community’s chief executive officer.

As soon as practical after receipt of a request for determination of compliance, DHCD will either
send the requesting MBTA community a notice that it has provided all of the required information, or
identify the additional information that is required to process the request. Upon reviewing a complete
application, DHCD will provide the MBTA community a written determination either stating that the
existing multi-family use district complies with Section 3A, or identifying the reasons why the multifamily use district fails to comply with Section 3A and the steps that must be taken to achieve compliance.
An MBTA community shall be deemed to be in compliance with Section 3A for the period of time
during which a request for determination of compliance, with all required information, is pending at
DHCD.
b. Action plans and interim compliance—New or amended district
Many MBTA communities do not currently have a multi-family district of reasonable size that
complies with all of the requirements set out in Section 3A and these guidelines. These MBTA
communities must take affirmative steps towards the creation of a compliant multi-family district within a
reasonable time. To achieve interim compliance, the MBTA community must, by no later than the dates
specified in section 9.c, send to DHCD written notice that a new multi-family district, or amendment of an
existing multi-family district, must be adopted to come into compliance with Section 3A. The MBTA
community must then take the following actions to maintain interim compliance:
i.

Creation of an action plan. Each MBTA community must provide DHCD with a proposed
action plan and timeline for any planning studies or community outreach activities it
intends to undertake in order to adopt a multi-family district that complies with Section 3A.
DHCD may approve or require changes to the proposed action plan and timeline by
sending the MBTA community written notice of such approval or changes. Rapid transit
communities and bus service communities must obtain DHCD approval of an action plan
by no later than March 31, 2023. Commuter rail communities and adjacent communities
must obtain DHCD approval of a timeline and action plan by no later than July 1, 2023.

ii.

Implementation of the action plan. The MBTA community must timely achieve each of the
milestones set forth in the DHCD-approved action plan, including but not limited to the
drafting of the proposed zoning amendment and the commencement of public hearings on
the proposed zoning amendment.

iii.

Adoption of zoning amendment. An MBTA community must adopt the zoning amendment
by the date specified in the action plan and timeline approved by DHCD. For rapid transit
communities and bus service communities, DHCD will not approve an action plan with an
adoption date later than December 31, 2023. For commuter rail communities and adjacent
communities, DHCD will not approve an action plan with an adoption date later than
December 31, 2024.

iv.

Determination of full compliance. Within [90] days after adoption of the zoning
amendment, the MBTA community must submit to DHCD a complete application
requesting a determination of full compliance. The application must include data and
analysis demonstrating that a district complies with all of the compliance criteria set forth
in these guidelines, including without limitation the district’s land area, unit capacity, gross
density and location.

During the period that an MBTA community is creating and implementing its action plan, DHCD
will endeavor to respond to inquiries about whether a proposed zoning amendment will create a multifamily district that complies with Section 3A. However, DHCD will issue a determination of full
compliance only after final adoption of the proposed zoning amendment and receipt of a complete
application demonstrating the unit capacity.
c. Timeframes for submissions by MBTA communities
To remain in interim compliance with Section 3A, an MBTA community must take one of the
following actions by no later than December 31, 2022:
i.
ii.

10.

Submit a complete request for a determination of compliance as set forth in section 9.a
above; or
Notify DHCD that there is no existing multi-family district that fully complies with these
guidelines, and submit a proposed action plan as described in section 9.b above.

Renewals and Rescission of a Determination of Compliance
a. Term and renewal of a determination of compliance

A determination of compliance shall have a term of 10 years. Each MBTA community shall apply
to renew its certificate of compliance at least 6 months prior to its expiration. DHCD may require, as a
condition of renewal, that the MBTA community report on the production of new housing within MBTA
community, and in the multi-family district that was the basis for compliance. Applications for renewal
shall be made on a form proscribed by DHCD.
b. Rescission of a determination of compliance
DHCD reserves the right to rescind a determination of compliance if DHCD determines that (i) the
MBTA community submitted inaccurate information in its application for a determination of compliance,
(ii) the MBTA community amended its zoning or enacted a general bylaw or other rule or regulation that
materially alters the Unit capacity in the applicable multi-family use district.

Reasonable Size: Land Area & Unit Capacity
The draft guidelines outline a two part test to determine reasonable size:
1. Minimum Land Area: multi family districts must comprise at least 50 acres of land or approximately 1/10
of the land area within 0.5 mile of a transit station with a minimum gross density of 15 units per acre, subject
to any further limitations imposed by relevant aspects of the state environmental code.
2. Minimum Multi Family Unit Capacity: The multi family unit capacity is a number of units based on a
percentage of total housing units within the community. This represents the number of multi family housing
units that can be developed as of right within the multi family district. That percentage varies by access to
transit:

• Many districts permit more than 15 units/acre
• No single district likely meets minimum size threshold based on
13,477-unit capacity – have to consider multiple districts
• Location to transit – more than one station?
• How to consider requirements related to affordable housing –

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you. a quorum of the ordinance committee being present in this meeting in
order to conduct a public hearing on proposed amendments to the building energy use disclosure ordinance
2021-26. pursuant to chapter 20 of the act 2021.by the Massachusetts gen. assembly and approved by the
governor. the city has the right to use electronic participation in meetings of the Cambridge city council. to
watch the meeting please tune to channel 22 or visit the open meeting for portal on the city's website. today's
meeting will be conducted in a remote format. if you like to provide public comment please go to [listing
names] to sign up for public comment. we will not allow any additional public comments sign-ups after 6 pm.
all those today will be taken by roll call. Mr. clerk, please call the roll.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you Mr. clerk obviously there is a lot to cover.
on the agenda we are going to hear first from CDD. then we can have some clarifying questions from the
committee. we will then hear from Councillor Nolan with a presentation on the amendments that she wishes to
bring forward. we can have clarifying questions following that presentation. we will then hear from Councillor
Zondervan will present the green new deal amendments. we can ask questions after that. we will go to public
comment. and then if time will go into, we can have more discussion we sort of anticipate this is going to take
certainly more than one meeting to get through. so, this is going to be a process. we certainly will get everything
tonight. so, with that I think we should probably just jump right in and go to CDD. assistant manager.
>> Iram Farooq, assistant city manager of community development: thank you Councillor McGovern good
evening to the ordinance committee. it was a pleasure to be here. and we're actually really excited to be here to
be talking to you today about amendments to the building energy use disclosure ordinance these are long time in
the making. we've been working on this along with members of the community with the regulated community
as well. starting pre-pandemic and with some hold up over time. so, it's really nice to finally have the
recommendations before the ordinance committee. we firmly believe that adding emissions reductions
requirements to the building energy use disclosure ordinance is one of the most impactful ways to get us to net
zero greenhouse gas emissions as a community. and that is something that has been very much in the forefront
of the team as they worked on framing the recommendations. I note that there are multiple different opinions on
this. we welcome discussion on the various ideas.

but I’m really happy to have the opportunity to talk you about the genesis of the specifics that are in the
proposal that has come out of the work following the net zero action plan. I will say that our presentation which

will be given by the spec is largely the same as the presentation as the health and environment committee in
December.

>> Seth Federspiel, sustainability planner: thank you very much. I will pull up the presentation. those full
screen side coming through for everyone? great. thanks very much for having me this evening. as the assistant
city manager said apologize to those of you from this will be familiar presentation print but I think again it's
helpful way to get everybody on the same page. in terms of where we are with this process. I’m going to move
through this pretty quickly so that we can get to the other presentations and discussion I’m certainly happy to
answer questions as we go. alright so I’m going to briefly discuss the context in the background for the building
energy disclosure ordinance pursuant to current amendments talk about the process and getting to those
amendments.
I will focus most of the presentation on reviewing the content of the amendments themselves as proposed by
CDD and the city manager back in November. so, as we were said the reason we are focused on building and
reducing billing greenhouse gas emissions because buildings play such a large role in our venous gas inventory.
so, in order to be successful in meeting our climate change goals is imperative to reduce emissions from
buildings in Cambridge and when we look at BEUDO building specifically BEUDO applies to commercial
buildings that a larger than 25,000 ft. in residential buildings larger than 50 units. these buildings have quite a
few. never.
sorry about that. but they count for about 60% of the square footage of the city. and the energy use and almost
70% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the building sector. so, 70% of that 80%. they come from buildings. the
reason greenhouse gas emissions are somewhat higher than energy is because of the amount of electricity used
by these buildings which has a slightly higher emissions factor then natural gas.
we mentioned the action plan I went to briefly place this proposal in context of the action plan the update which
was submitted to council a little bit earlier this year. the action plan is a comprehensive plan for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. and while BEUDO plays a very important piece of that. it is not the
only piece.
so, across the action plan which has actions for existing buildings the new buildings and the energy supply. we
have combination proposed requirements such as the country amendments but also a range of incentives and
support in enabling actions. so BEUDO again plays one piece of that. but in order for the net zero action plan to
be successful and to successfully meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals we need to activate all of these
actions together to address the full set of greenhouse gas emissions buildings in Cambridge.

mostly because the petition the text of the ordinance of the proposal is the same. however, I just want to make
sure that we do this since we are now in the formal ordinance process, and it would make sure that everybody's
interested is attending this hearing as an opportunity to hear the full scope of what is on the table. so, with that I
will just introduce. [listing names] we hear from me more department and had the law department was deftly
partner in framing for specifics of this to make sure that they pass muster, and it was turned over to. [listing
names] who is leads the net zero work at CDD. Seth over to you.

on the BEUDO process, BEUDO was adopted in 2014. included a provision that in 20 team we reviewed the
impact of BEUDO. that review process showed that the energy use of BEUDO buildings remained relatively
stable over the time of the ordinance. this again energy use which is distinct from greenhouse gas emissions or
have gone down slightly for BEUDO buildings. largely due to improvements in electricity degrades but
certainly this trend is not satisfying the significant improvement in energy performance called for by the
ordinance. so, this trigger then our process to consider what amendments the ordinance would look like.
so, to briefly review that process a process again in 2017 so we been working on it for number of years. in that
process centered largely around consultation with the actual BEUDO property owners to really understand with
them what the considerations are for improving energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions from those
buildings and to work towards developing a proposed approach that can work for the buildings and achieve
greenhouse gas emissions that we need to achieve.

and so, coming out of this process we had general support from the regulated community. about the
performance standards and assigned space targets that were established therein. there is a goal to establish
regulatory certainties so tried to get the policy figured out sooner rather than later. and a desire to balance
flexibility in the policy with simplicity and predictability again knowing what to expect going forward.

I advised reducing greenhouse gas emissions being able to have a lot of flexibility for how those reductions are
achieved so they can come from both on-site and off-site measures. the actual complaints and targets are on the
left-hand side, and it will go through those on the next slide. But based on those targets we base it on what the
sizes: four from the IPCC in terms of our 2050 net zero commitment.
in the interim targets between now and then. and then the other important aspect to understand here is that the
Cambridge proposal this is different than for example the Boston ordinance is setting targets relative to each
individuals buildings baseline. this really simplifies the approach.
by avoiding the need to calculate the universal target. by building type print it also gives us more certainty about
the outcome because we know that all of the buildings are reducing a certain percentage then the outcome is
that percentage reduction. in each building is then contributing a proportional amount of that percentage
reduction depending on where they are starting. so higher emitting building has two make a larger absolute
reduction. to make the same percentage as a more efficient building is a lower absolute reduction again at the
same percentage. so, this graph is visualizing what those thresholds look like overtime. and so again the oldworld trajectory put this on that science-based targeted net 0 by 2050 and we chose increments in five years. to
match up with the retrofit cycles that buildings will undertake. so, acknowledging that it takes time for buildings
to plan and implement retrofits. so that way we have these steps so the buildings have five years then they can
meet the steps for another five years as anticipated the next five years.
and because the baseline is consistent throughout any early action that is taken during any of the steps is given
credit for in the following steps prince of the building goes below 20% in the first . for example, the net
automatically credited towards the next complaints we met. the way we regulate complaints is like regulating
greenhouse gas emissions for each energy use in the building. multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor for
that energy use. we'll talk about that a little more at the next light. then there's also a provision that buildings can
take credit for alternative compliance credits. which are purchased and go to reinvest in greenhouse gas
emission reductions elsewhere in the city.
then renewable electricity which I’ll talk about in a second. it is also a part of the calculation and it subtracted
from the electricity use portion of the energy formula. so, the emission factors are important because emission
factors translate the amount of energy that the buildings are using to the emissions. for example, electricity
emissions change over time as the state and national electric grid for cleaner. so, we are in the process of
planning the stakeholder-based process to determine the emission factors in particular for the electrical grid
coming in looking backwards to the baseline and projecting forward so that buildings know what they can
expect to receive credit from the grid over the period of each compliance period.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

I’m going to jump into the actual proposal the proposed amendments were submitted to council back in
November of last year. this line summarizes them I’m going to go through these one by one. but it's you for
your reference. so of course, the center of the policy proposal is the actual performance requirements. and so,
point to note here is that the performance requirements are in greenhouse gas emissions breaks as opposed to
energy or another unit. and the reason for that do not have conversation with the property owners that are
preference for that unit of what we are regulating to match what we are trying to achieve.

we want to project forward five years of the time to give building that certainty. so, as the building went to
comply with the performance standard, they can take on-site emission reductions. by increasing their energy
efficiency by electrifying there and uses of energy in getting off fossil fuels. and by producing electricity
through on-site renewable sources. they can also purchase off-site renewable electricity. this applies to the
electrical use of the building. or they can purchase alternate complaints credits. basically, talk about each of
these. so, for the off-site renewable electricity we went through a stakeholder process to establish the criteria
what counts as off-site renewable print want to make sure that these nobles are high quality and are adding to
the room nobles on the grid as opposed to kind of counting the same or nobles that are already out there.

so, another aspect of the proposal from CDD has been buildings the option to choose an earlier baseline. this is
in response from trunk the back of the building owners that they wanted to have a way to take credit for action
before that default baseline of 2018 /2019. so, what we've done is we've allowed a baseline back as far as 2010.
but then we scaled the reductions so that buildings remain on that science-based trajectory of 50% by 2030
relative to that 2010 baseline and 100% by 2050. so, we can see that in these next couple of graphs and charts.so
on average BEUDO buildings have been reducing their emissions largely again due to the grid by 2.53% a year.
so, when we look at that trajectory if you take a building back beyond the default baseline, we assume that their
missions would have been higher in 2010 and they were in 2018 and 2019. so, the amount of reductions that
they need to make by 2030 target are then proportionally higher. if buildings choose the 2010 baseline, they
have to make a 50% reduction by 2030 as opposed to the 40% reduction for buildings taking the default
baseline. but what this allows is for buildings that to take early action say that building reduces the greenhouse
gas emissions by 35% in 2050 before the default baseline at 35% reduction would have them in compliance
through the other 2029. so, they would get credit for having made the effort for the early action.
and it would prorate those reductions over time. so, this slide shows that if you take an early baseline in between
the default baseline in the 2010 year then the amount of reduction requirement is prorated accordingly. the other
flexibility mechanism shall be included is specific optional pathways for both laboratories and affordable
housing. I will show how you want to be very clear that while this is more flexibly to these building types it
achieves the exact same amount of a role greenhouse gas emissions reductions over time.
so, you see that these buildings have a longer time period to comply to give them more time to plan and
implement these budgets. but they have higher production professionals to rather than the 20% threshold in
2035. that was proposed these buildings would have to hit a 33% reduction threshold starting in 2027. and so,
when we look at that in comparison to the default pathway over time the affordable housing pathway is an
orange. the default pathway is in blue. and you see the kind of flop if you do the math on hypothetical building
the lifetime emissions from those two buildings over the policy period are exactly the same.
so again, it is not a less stringent pathway for those buildings. it's just flexibility mechanism to give them more
time to plan for and implement those projects. we've also proposed flexibility for campuses. this being true
campuses like the university for that city buildings it does not apply to portfolio owners of rented properties. but
the goal is to let those summers aggregate their missions across all of their buildings and so that they can then
make investments at that campus level.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

so, these requirements are fairly stringent. in order to add to that were nobles out there. and were hoping to help
building owners access these were nobles potentially through pathways such as our community aggregation
program. the alternative compliance credits again are an alternative compliance mechanism that buildings can
choose, and we propose a price for these credits of $234 a ton which is consistent with the Boston ordinance.
and that price is based on the average cost of producing emissions from buildings such as these. so, it takes the
average cost over time and deposit forward to understand without marginal cost would be connect the goal is to
incentivize buildings to take action but then give a reasonable alternative payment mechanism which would
then be reinvested in city programs and projects to reduce carbon throughout the community.

there are handful of exemptions in the proposal. the primary exemption being buildings that have already
limited their missions were achieved net zero and we expect most new buildings will achieve that standard in
the near future so for new buildings built in the in between years. there's a grace period for those buildings to be
able to get up to speed and plan their admission trajectory emissions reduction with net 0 by 2050.
again, looking at the bigger picture net zero action plan other avenues that require buildings to achieve net zero.
as many of you probably know the state is just released the first draft of their net zero threshold proposal so will
follow in participating in development of that proposal very closely. over the next year so that we have a clear
mechanism to require buildings to achieve net zero emissions and therefore have achieved the goals of the
building energy use disclosure ordinance. performance requirements. we also propose exemptions for buildings
that are not operating that are vacant. being demolished. every buildings under financial distress.

in the event of noncompliance, we got the existing penalty structure for BEUDO. the other elements of
compliance with performance requirements. so separate penalties can be assessed for not reporting the current
penalty structure. for reporting false data since we can't delete the performance requirement finds based on data.
we require buildings and proposed buildings are required to have a third-party audit of their baseline. a
compliance date of so we can check the veracity of that data and of course not complying with the actual
performance reductions. so, the form of the penalty is a violation of up to $300 per violation per day. and
finally, we propose that once we get the first year of reporting in the first complaint that the policy be reviewed
and make it is the time to check in on the effectiveness of the policy. to consider adjustments that are needed
and to move forward with those adjustments.

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair thanks to Seth for that excellent presentation. I’m excited
as well to be discussing these amendments print, I had a quick question about the exemptions for buildings. if
we can say a little bit more about that. if the building is truly net zero, would we want them to nonetheless
report their energy emissions so we can verify that if they are net zero and they would know with any money.
then it would be de facto exempt anyway.
>> Seth Federspiel: I think that's a fair question. the assumption is that zero buildings will continue to comply
with the reporting elements of BEUDO. but they would not be expected to follow the mission reduction
trajectory if they already done so. I think may be a bit of a technicality. and so is something we're happy to
discuss and figure out the most efficient way to address.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: awesome thank you.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you Mr. chair. that they might have been the second presentation as you indicated
it was a good thing because I actually think I got more out of it this time. and I think I thank you for that. it was
an excellent presentation. my question is on the penalties he wouldn't just be assuming somebody doesn't listen
at all which hopefully will happen. it's more than the three zones that you called for the three areas which were
that up to 350,000 rated it would be plus the tonnage penalty would it not?
>> Seth Federspiel: again, I would defer to the law department for guidance on this. I don't know if Megan is
here.
>> Megan Bayer, associate city solicitor: through you Mr. chair. so, we are limited in the way that we can issue
a penalty. under the noncommittal disposition statute and/or ordinance so it's $300 a day for a violation. and that
is the maximum that we can depose.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: trying to get clarification how do you charge per ton assuming they didn't reduce
anything? that's why they didn't report. we think that would be an add-on may be that cold a penalty. I don't
know what to call the $234 per ton. cost but it seems to me that it would be both. I mean it's a serious it's more
serious and more of an encouragement to follow up. $350,000 quite frankly for some people would not be a big
issue. if the tonnage is also paid for. the exhaust. that's a serious combination . I don't think … I assume both
would be in effect, what about the exhaust? the greenhouse gases in the air? I’m not trying to be tricky.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: this is an opportunity to ask clarifying questions about the presentation we just
celebrated I seem Councillor Zondervan cochair of the ordinance committee and Councillor Carlone if others
have questions, please use the raise your hand feature.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I think councilor there were two numbers that were put up there as penalties there
was the $234 then there was the $300 a day. so, I think what Councillor Carlone is asking does that mean they
could be fined $524 per day.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: I’m sorry I thought I said that but maybe not.
>> Seth Federspiel: through you my chair I just want to add the $234 is not a penalty. it is not a fine. the $234 is
an alternate compliance option. the buildings may choose to satisfy all or part of their greenhouse gas emission
reduction requirement. so, they can make that payment to the fund to satisfy the requirements of the ordinance.

but it's not a penalty. and if they … therefore if they don't report or don't do anything at all the $234 would not
be part of that equation.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: I will let it ride thank you very much.

>> Seth Federspiel: just to clarify Mr. chair you are speaking to the $234? we arrived at that number by building
off the analysis that Boston had done on the actual cost of reducing emissions in buildings such as those
covered by BEUDO. so, the analysis showed that the average cost of all of the measures that might be taken
between now and 2050 to get the net zero would be that $234. so, the idea is by setting that as the alternative
compliance credit level buildings would be incentivized to take the many measures that cost significantly less
than that and some that have a negative cost or savings buildings in overtime as is written in the proposal that
alternative amount could also be adjusted to reflect the changes in technology and changes in cost. so, the idea
is to incentivize the buildings to take as much action directly as they can.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you councillor toner.
>> Paul F. Toner: like you Mr. chair set around my question is do you based on what you presented and being
in the process it seems like you did a pretty thorough job of engaging all the stakeholders, the universities,
business groups and others that might be impacted by that . it sounds like you also reached some degree of
consensus about the achievability by 2050 of meeting these goals, is that correct?
>> Seth Federspiel: so, we had 40 meetings with the stakeholders over the four years that we've been working
on this. I will let them speak for themselves. but I think the sense is we did reach a good level of agreement on
both the form and astringency in the timeline of the policy. again, noting that really the timeline that we pursued
is one that is in line with the science.
>> Paul F. Toner: my only follow-up you mentioned IPCC I’m not familiar with that organization. I know you
said that this plan meets IPCC standards the note we did at least one letter and public comments from someone
suggesting may be IPCC has a different take on things. can you clarify for me whether this meets IPCC
standards or not?
>> Seth Federspiel: sure, through you Mr. chair the IPCC is inter intergovernmental panel on climate change. it
is the intergovernmental panel of scientists to study climate change and assess what greenhouse gas emissions
reductions must be achieved to avoid the worst effects of climate change. and so, the science that we are basing
it on was based on the 2018 and 2020 report which cited a 50% reduction by 2010. I’m sorry a 50% reduction
relative to 2010 by 2030 and 100% reduction for net zero by 2050. it is that pace we need to achieve. so that
again is a trajectory that we designed the policy to achieve.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: quick follow-up. then I will go to councillor toner. I had a question on that was
well how did that figure, did you arrive at that figure is that enough of a deterrent for someone ultimately want
people to comply and not buy their way out of it. how did you get that number? is he going to be easier for
somebody to buy their way out of doing this?

>> Paul F. Toner: one less follow-up, has anything changed in the past year. Have they come out with different
metrics or anything or are they still in agreement with that last statement you made that?
>> Seth Federspiel: to my knowledge it's still the same.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: any other clarifying questions from the committee? not seeing any other hands.
okay. thank you thank you for the presentation don't go away. we will now go to Councillor Nolan.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I’m in city hall but not. all good?
this is a visual presentation laying out amendments that Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Carlone and I have
discussed over the last few months actually as the BEUDO conversation happened. so, you all the city council
as a matter of public record received a memo that was part of the public record for our Monday meeting with a
little bit more text around this.
this will not… this presentation doesn't talk about the actual language changes, but it does present a summary of
what it is we are proposing and why.

BEUDERO is critical to our success as a city to reach our climate goals. what BEUDERO does is mandate
emissions reductions from existing large building. Seth has ably talked about this and CDD has put forth a
proposal for how that would be put in place. it puts a price of emissions from buildings and eventually requires
emissions reductions to net zero. the picture on this page is the new MIT building on main street. the city
council has for many years worked on climate emissions reductions. and it was actually in 2011 a couple of
you were on the council. this council voted on zoning at the time… the reason this really critically important is
even in 2011 every single building owner Cambridge was on notice that net zero was something the council and
the city was incredibly interested in. at that time MIT was not ready to build these buildings net zero.
unfortunately, the amendments didn't pass. but with BEUDERO these buildings like every other existing
building have to become a net zero overtime. There is a really important context that we all have to be aware of
and I know that several councilors and some in the public are not as aware of the timeline here. Seth mentioned
it with net zero action plan that helped create BEUDO in the first place. that first action plan laid out a timeline
for BEUDO encoded in the actual language of BEUDO was initiated the patient that this is meant to spur
reductions in emissions. if it doesn't by the end of 2018 new requirements were going to be put in place. they
were supposed to be put in place and tested from 2018 – 2022. the first version of performance requirements
which would have mandated performance requirements to reduce emissions.
the first period never happened we are now starting the first period just in 2022. We are supposed to be at the
end of the first period which is about to be reviewed in 2023 and a second version of requirements started in
2024. it is critically important to understand why it is that for all of the work that is been done the BEUDO…
the net zero action plan timeline, we are three years behind. in anticipated also possible for adding requirements
which again means every single building owner has known since 2014 since BEUDO pass. that this was
coming. so, what we are proposing is to build on the fantastic work of CDD who has put forth a lot of effort into
the BEUDERO standards and do a couple things. one simplify it by taking out some fairly complex alternative
compliance timelines. taking out some different… remove some of this additional work that was done and in
our view over complicates it. there are a few key things. number one faster reductions to net zero by 2050. to
reduce emissions faster on the highest emitters mainly lab building. charge new nonresidential buildings for all
their emission that will be someone's discussed in line with the new green deal amendments the Councillor
Zondervan will be talking about.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

let me go back. this building just so people know this image shows the construction of a new Alexandria bio-lab
building which includes a geothermal field to reduce energy requirements and emission . This buildings being
built right now as we speak in Cambridge. far better than the existing buildings. as CDD noted in the original
BEUDO with methods for reductions and it did not succeed.

The image on this page is the new biomed realty building proposed for Third Street. this will be an all-electric
bio-lab buildings which means they can quickly get to net zero through purchasing renewable energy almost
from day one. it is critical to note given particularly… I appreciate councillor toner's question about the IPCC
target, we hear a lot about science -based targets. here is the deal. the IPCC target of 2050 is for the earth as a
whole. the earth as a whole.
if that is going to be reached it absolutely requires that environmental leaders have to be much faster than what
the IPCC ultimate end goal is. there is no way that the entire earth by following… will follow the emissions that
we are talking about which means all of us with yours as is environmental leaders absolutely have an obligation
to do everything we can to accelerate because otherwise there is no help for the planet. I am not exaggerating

that. not only that the world has changed a lot. remember BEUDO was passed in 2014. we discussed in 20122013, was finally passed by the council in 2014 we are six years beyond that, and the world is only more urgent.
we cannot meet our own goals without an accelerated timeline which is why we're saying it should not be 2050.

they already are being built fossil fuel free. Frankly they are the highest emitters and also the most profitable.
They are exactly the sweet spot that we should be moving to say all of them should be net zero as soon as
possible. establish more stringent baseline. so, what we are proposing is a kind of hybrid. what Boston did with
set a baseline for all buildings to match. What we are saying is wherever you are you start, and you lower from
there. what we're saying is yes that is absolutely true. if you're lower than average or if you're even average to
start where you are just reduced on a timescale. but if you're one of the highest emitters. why would he allow
you to start out really, really high, and only reduce the same percentage as somebody else. so, it will be kind of
a hybrid approach. just for that first period on the same timeline as everyone else and all new BEUDO
buildings, the baseline has to be zero emissions.
as Seth said that is true for all existing net zero buildings, all new the buildings will be built in the city next few
years have to be zero baseline for greenhouse gas emissions. that element will be presented a little more indepth with part of the green new deal amendment. so why do we say 2035? just remind the council. before I
was on it. maybe before Councillor Zondervan, certainly not before Councillor Carlone. April 24, 2017, policy
order passed that the council supports the goal of using 100% clean and renewable energy in Cambridge
including in building energy and transportation by 2035. That goal was reaffirmed December 13 of 2021. so,
I’m reminding all of us we cannot possibly achieve that goal if BEUDO buildings are still burning fossil fuels
after 2035. We likely can’t even achieve it with a long-term goal of 2040 or 2050 if we don't take accelerated
action now and at this point, we still causing emissions indirectly. how many of us have gotten an amazon or
some kind of delivery in the last few weeks?
those are all shipping of goods into Cambridge which the emissions are not captured in this. so, this is a
reminder that a net zero BEUDERO building does not really mean zero omissions because you can have
residual missions and you can also basically buy your way out. as Seth noted many of these places have just met
there reduction targets by the greening of the grid. They buy 100% renewable energy and electricity. They have
not stopped burning fossil fuels. they just used 100% renewable energy as a way to meet… lower their
emissions. that is still allowed and under the current BEUDERO proposal building can still pay to pollute while
meeting the definition of net zero. That may be changed later. The idea is if you really say, I cannot possibly
stop burning fossil fuels my basement then you pay that alternative compliance payment. so, another reason
we're passionate about this is that we know it's been really, really, really hard. the city has been working on
climate actions for more than 20 years. more than 20 years. The climate action plan was in 2002 literally 20
years ago. and there's a whole slew of work done even before that plan. we been trying to reduce emissions
since 2003 if not before and it's been unsuccessful. these are some quotes from various. I think mostly the first
couple in the CPAC annual report for greenhouse gas emission continue to increase in 2003 it should be noted
that emissions will remain in 1990. the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 had not been met
even by 20% rate reduction and overall, the citywide building emissions from 2012 – 2019 grew 11.3% this is
the most recent data we have this is based on the outside consultant report looking at the net zero action plan
and this is for the building sector. they found overall it grew from 2012 – 2019, 11%. it was supposed to be
going down 20 or 30% and it hasn't. The five-year review which was published in 2021… I believe that is
actually 2020, I think is 2021 found that the first five years of that plan which was an action plan was to lead to
reduction in fact essentially led to no progress. they had calculated a 1% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions
which of course 1% is almost nothing.

and again, it should not be a surprise to any building owner. since BEUDO was passed many years ago. so, the
proposed amendments to… the amendments to the amendments which you have seen in writing. Net zero by
2035, not 2050. that is completely in line with the science-based targets of the IPCC 's as we know and as all of
the people who discussed this have said there needs to be some action by many players up front it is why…
90% of new homes in the Netherlands built in last year 90% in the last year were fossil fuel free. Ithaca will be
fossil fuel free by 2030. we cannot wait until 2050 and cannot be satisfied with just being with the crowd would
be… I think a huge lost opportunity for a climate leader like Cambridge. Let’s simplify the reductions to a
percent a year, not every five years. strike some of the exemptions. allow an alternative schedule for 100%
affordable housing, yes, but not for laboratories, laboratories should not be exempt.

That was not anything that we expected or what we hope for, is far behind what we expected or desired
outcomes. That review called for a drastically different approach which is what led us here today to
BEUDERO. so, let's look at what would happen. this is a visual to say we are all talking about the same thing.
getting to net zero. we are proposing let's do a faster decline. that is, it. this shows you an overall the
BEUDERO buildings started 100%, the proposal we are saying is you are already going to make this rapid
steep decline and get to net zero by 2035 and the other way the amendments are proposing to amend it still has
the decline without actually changing that methodology, we are saying it has to be faster. both schedules require
20% reduction starting at 2025 and not a lot before them other than for high emitters. as we mentioned, as we
know, rapid near-term emissions are critical. just like anything else if you are paying off your interest is in your
pay it the better. for here the sooner we reduce emissions the better because if you don't reduce them this year
then they go on for 10 years. if you reduce them in 10 years there was a lot less than reducing them now.
Cambridge is a leader on climate change action or wants to be. Right now, we really should step it up and show
others that can be done. the other reminder for us is what actual building will do. if I own a building just like my
house, I have been looking ay ground source heat exchange. while we see this nice step function, for individual
buildings it will be I am either going to buy all me renewable energy and reduce immediately or I am going to
electrify immediately. it would be more like I am going to drop pretty soon and then using renewable energy
purchases. it won’t be all clean and a step function for everybody or 8% per year more like 50% one year, 40%
the next year and then they will be done.
again, we can talk more about what this means. Neither of these steps completely eliminates emissions. it's
really only the actual energy consumption that we are talking about right here in this chart. it's really important
to create economic pressure in favor of eliminating wasteful energy consumption that we don't need. so, here's
an example. let's use an example of how our proposal varies from the amendments on the table. so, you know
what this data shows you have a nice redline and a pink line. redline is for according to the 2019 BEUDO data
from every year you can look it up on the web you have about 800 buildings per year out of 1000 who report
their use. Biogen according to this data that was accessed on the Cambridge open data portal was at a really
high level of greenhouse gas emissions intensity which is measured in kilograms of carbon per square foot.
what we're saying is the really high emitters instead of being able to start high and just reduce like everybody
else, which is what the redline is, they have to immediately reduce.
again, they can buy alternative compliance payments, but they have to reduce it down to the industry average by
2025. from there just like everyone else. so, these are two specific properties in Cambridge from the BEUDO
database one is Biogen, which is super high, above average, then the other is 2 oxford street which is a Harvard
lab, and it basically is at the average of labs, and for them the CDD proposal would be yes over time they don't
reduce that much because they are pretty good in terms of greenhouse gas emission intensity. our proposal has
them reduce a little faster. it's worth noting that both of these buildings are on the list of the top 25 largest
buildings emitters in Cambridge.
of the thousands that we found in the BEUDO list the top 25, both of these are on it which means even to oxford
street which is far far less than biogenic is the one of the top 25 largest buildings of greenhouse gas emitters by
intensity which means settings industry-standard would not in effect in the vast majority of buildings. only
require 15 or 20 buildings to dramatically move that standard by 2025 because they are not already meeting it.
The industry standard the use of 25 is calculated from Boston’s BEUDO proposal. Their number for science and
technology was 19.2 kg per square foot. and for manufacturing with 23.9. so, we chose 24 as an industry
standard as the highest of both of those. all the data comes from the Cambridge open data portal and it's from
the year 2019 as a baseline. so, the summary here is that an underperforming building, meaning way more than
average, it is going to reduce sooner because it… if you visualize that lie between the pink and redline all of that
is additional emissions that will be paid for under the proposal.

final slide. so, let's also remember even if BEUDERO buildings which is 1000 buildings that Seth noted is only
7% but is 60%-70% of emissions. even if they all collectively cut their emissions in half. that only gets us to
half our goal. the city needs other major cuts in order to get to even half because BEUDO buildings are little bit
over half the energy… the total greenhouse gas emissions in the city. so, if they go down, we only solve … the
pie chart is going to get net zero citywide… 50% reduction for BEUDO is only 28% of the whole city. so even
if we achieve that goal on the nose it doesn't mean we achieve it for Cambridge overall. Which means we have

to overshoot for the BEUDO sector to leave room for the challenges everybody else going to face the rest of the
city is not going to reduce their emissions by 50%.
so that is what we hope our colleagues will agree. it's an urgent area we know that people have worked with a
range of stakeholders. what I can say is this is feasible. You saw examples of buildings in Cambridge right now
being built this way. and that reduction can happen and eventually… There is very the report out that shows
when you do this you actually save money that the state… the proposal for net zero energy stretch code as I’ve
mentioned and frankly the response from the community and folks that follow this is not going to get us where
we need to go that is not going to save us. we cannot rely on that because it's going to allow continued use of
fossil fuels which we should not sustain in Cambridge.
that is, its Councillor McGovern. I will stop sharing.

>> Paul F. Toner: thank you Mr. chair. Councillor Nolan have you done any outreach to the various
stakeholders who were involved in 40 meetings over the past four years to discuss these potential amendments
because I’m just concerned about making these changes and yanking the rug out from… what seems like
consensus documents at this point. have you had an opportunity to reach out to them?
>> Patricia M. Nolan: we haven’t talked to the entire climate protection action committee. the climate crisis
working group and several members of the net-zero action plan task force who were involved in that. they have
all sent letters to the council agreeing that we need to accelerate, and we need to do this. that is certainly
something that is next step as we go forward in this process. and I will say outreach to those actors includes a
number of people were on the net zero action plan that was discussed again at the climate crisis working group
and at the CPAC which is the central body of the city to give advice to the city as a whole on climate issues.
does that answer your question?
>> Paul F. Toner: one follow-up I don't know the members of the CPAC does that include people represented
from MIT, Harvard, the bio-labs. are they in agreement that this is something that they support?
>> Patricia M. Nolan: I can't speak for all of the members. we can hear from them later. my response to that is
there is going to be some pushback from those players. my response is of course because they are the highest
emitters. when you look at those highest emitters, it is the people you're talking about. so, it's like saying yes,
I’m not dismissing that whole process. what I am saying… we tried to say in the presentation this is a different
world from even five years ago. and every single building in Cambridge has been on noticed since long before
BUEDO came forward but that was promulgated and actually in the law in 2014 that this was coming.
>> Paul F. Toner: again Mr. chair, through you Mr. chair my only concern is as a city and as a council we invite
people to the table to have these discussions to come up with a consensus document and then we throw a
complete curveball and suggest reducing things by 15 years. I think even in your comments you said we are
several years behind, and we also now go to truncate it by 15 years. I understand the urgency. I get the
comments we are getting. I do hope that we go to engage the other stakeholders especially the one that going to
implement this to get their response.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you. council questions?

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: Mr. chair can give a direct response to … thank you Mr. chair through you
Mr. chair to councillor toner. I appreciate the question I think it is a fair question. but I will add that we are
stakeholders also. as residents of the city and inhabitants of this planet. the decision about how much pollution
we are supposed to accept is not purely up to the building owners. that being said personally I’ve been in
conversations with these developers and building operators in Cambridge for over a decade on this issue. so,
this is not new it is not being sprung out of nowhere. as Councillor Nolan mentioned back in 2011 there was a
vote in this council on MIT’s proposed buildings on main street being net zero so to the extent possible, we
can’t… unfortunately we can't afford lobbyists and consultants but to the extent possible we made our voices
heard as residents and stakeholders in the city and we have been very clear for over 10 years that we need these
buildings to be net zero now. particularly the new ones but also the existing ones and the BEUDO process goes

back before 2014. it was adopted by the council in 2014 but was worked on for several years before that. there
shouldn't be any surprises here that we are saying this timeline is too little, too late and thank you Mr. chair.

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: Mr. chair through you these amendments were first put forth by Councillor
Nolan, Councillor Carlone and myself last year at the health and environment meeting. Again, we are having an
ordinance committee meeting now. we were planning to have another ordinance committee at least one more.
so, there's plenty more opportunity for the building owners to let us know how they feel and read the letter from
the chamber of commerce today.
>> Alanna M. Mallon, Vice Mayor: thank you Mr. chair. through you. following along what councillor toner
was saying. I think we are in a different time right now. we have received some really bad news even recently
that new England is in a dire situation and Massachusetts in particular. the land is shifting underneath our feet,
and we do need these to respond to make sure we are being responsive and shift that timeline. the one thing I’m
wondering is if there is some time… The ordinance committee is not a great place to have that conversation
with building owners.
we got a couple building or developers like Alexandria, Biomed, they are building buildings currently that are
going to be fossil free. we also have developers who have not been brought to the table around some of these
amendments and I am wondering if there is a way to do that outside of the ordinance committee process. that
would be helpful to bring people to the table to talk about why this is so important to talk about some of these
amendments and changes and timelines. I’m not saying change them, necessarily, but I am… it is important for
people to work together. we got an email from MIT that they were not contacted. They are one of the biggest
developers in the city and I would hope that we would go to them as a partner and as somebody who I know has
really aggressive climate goals.
what are those climate goals and how can we be partners and work together? so in between now and the
planning board meeting and subsequent ordinance meetings I would encourage us to have a conversation or the
motion makers to have that conversation with some of those bigger developers, the ones that are doing the fossil
free-work, Alexandria, Biomed and the folks that are not necessarily building right now to net zero but had we
have that conversation and bring everybody to the table because we do know that there was those 40
conversations. we know that there was some consensus and I understand… we all understand we are in an
emergency.
the land is shifting underneath our feet. how we work together and partner. it's not a question necessarily. I
guess it's more of a comment of let's try to figure out how to bring the players to the table and really talk about
what we are trying to do together and partner. so, I will yield back at the time sorry Mr. chair that was not a
question more of a comment.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Paul F. Toner: I don't want to engage in a big debate. I just feel that if they were going to shave 15 years off
a timeline that was agreed to by 40 meetings and four years with all stakeholders. I understand we are all
stakeholders, and I don’t want anyone to get the sense that I don’t want to solve the climate crisis as quick as
everybody else, but I also don't have to meet these requirements. I just want to make sure that we engage those
folks and have conversation about how we do things as quickly as possible and as fairly as possible and not just
surprise them with a 15-year change in the timeline. thank you.

>> Dennis J. Carlone: I do have a question for Seth on the 40 meetings he mentioned . Seth was that really
BEUDO or was that net zero meetings?
>> Seth Federspiel: that was BEUDO through you Mr. chair. beginning in 2018 we had a series of meetings that
were open to all BEUDO building owners. first to design… to go through a process to understand what the
framework for building performance standards in Cambridge could be. we also had a series of meetings about
the technical support and resources that these buildings would need to achieve the emissions reductions we are
talking about, and we already launched the Cambridge building energy retrofit program in the fall of 2019. to
provide easy access to the state incentives and technical support for buildings to meet the standards. there were
number working group meetings as well as follow-up meetings because this process did stretch out in part due

to the pandemic and other delays and so we had continual meetings in 2020 and 2021 so that all of the property
owners could be aware of the proposal leading up to its submission to council.

my own feeling is, as I tried to say a few weeks ago, if our goal is 2050 and we overshoot it's 2060. If our goal
is 2035 and we overshoot it's 2042 or something like that. there is no doubt in my mind the world is going to
overshoot, and we are the leaders. we are the smartest people and as far as developers go of course we have to
talk to them. of course, institutions. believe me they know. but we have to talk to them. but we represent more
than developers. we represent the residents. I’ve told you all that I have bad asthma. you can hear it. and some
of the longer-term councilors might remember that were a few years in the winter when I couldn't talk without
coughing every sentence which I’m sure excited everybody and that was because of the air quality. thank God I
have medication that helps. my point is this a serious stuff. I think the city has done great work. and we are
revving it up. and maybe it won’t be met but it will be a lot closer and a lot sooner if our goal is sooner. thank
you.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you councillor. anybody else before asking my question.
a couple of things. I will make a quick comment. I think we're sort of… I don't know if splitting hairs is rights
term or missing each other. I think the comment that people have known that this is coming is true. this has
been talked about for a long time but what they sort of thought was coming was 2050. 2035 and all these other
amendments that are now being proposed tonight was not something that people necessarily saw coming until
they were presented in December. I think both things are actually true. people knew something was coming and
there was this committee to work on it. and they thought what was coming was 2050 and now all of a sudden,
we have all of these new things are saying 2035. I am not saying which is better or worse. so, the feeling for
some of those folks saying we have not never really discussed this enough? I think it's also understandable
because these are pretty significant changes, that may be necessary changes, but is not quite fair to say they
knew this is coming. they knew the overall goal was coming, they did not know these amendments were
coming.
that aside Councillor Nolan I don't know if you can answer this or maybe Seth. in the examples you gave… We
are not just talking about new buildings. We are also talk about retrofitting buildings so an example that you
gave were all new buildings. I’m not an expert…You used Alexandria, Biomed. these are buildings are being
built now again I am not the expert; it would seem to me that that might be an easier thing… to build something
from scratch and do something a certain way than retrofitting. I guess my question is… I would love 2035. I
sort of agree with… I’d rather set ambitious goals. if you don't make them as Councillor Carlone just said you
have a little more wiggle room. I don't want to set goals that make us just feel good because they're like we are
just doing something we said 2035 we are better than everybody else. I want to make sure that they can be done.
That the science is there. that they are achievable. what's the difference between retrofitting a building versus
building a new building and what happens if all these buildings go electric? We have talked a lot about our
power grid being maxed out and then what does that mean that that mean. do we need more substations and
then where are those going to go? This all layers together. I guess my question to Councillor Nolan what do you
understand as the difference between new buildings versus retrofitting buildings and are these goals applicable
to both of those kinds of things? is it easier to build a new building and meet these goals versus retrofit and meet
his goals.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you. I work with developers almost my whole career. it certainly in urban design
for 45 years and I found that there were few enlightened once we get it, like Joe Maguire at Alexandria but there
are others who were so, and I get why, short-term thinking. they liked putting expenses… like we all do… if
you own a home or a condominium out as much as possible. I believe Councillor Nolan mentioned this but
when MIT got its up-zoning for main street the original condition was net zero buildings. that was voted on by
the council. and approved and then MIT spoke to one or two of the councilors and the votes were changed. so,
this isn't new. this has been around.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I totally agree. we should get all the players to the table. I agree with that. it's something
that we need to be doing. I will also note that if building owners are at the table that is like the tobacco
companies being the ones to say how do you reduce smoking. there are literally the people emitting these
emissions.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I don't want to put MIT in the same category as tobacco companies.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: some of the question was… in other discussions about this I’ve heard people say
that the science isn’t quite there yet. it's not quite ready. so, part of the goals of 2050 were to sort of hoping that
things would kind of catch up and I guess is that…
>> Patricia M. Nolan: I talked two developers in the last couple weeks and they said if you asked us to do this
five years ago, I would've said you are crazy. right now, it really has changed. can it happen? I would argue
especially given MIT and Harvard’s commitment, they have the people, the best people placed on earth to do
this. they can do it and remember if you can't get there within a few years you can have alternative compliance
payments which then go into a fund to help solve this.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you I know other folks… to answer my question. I would say this before I
turn it over, I’m going to go to. Iram because… before I go there… this does bring up and I mentioned this
Monday night, about is the ordinance committee and this is following up on what the vice mayor said, the
ordinance committee is a more clunky committee. we get the language. we get an amendment. we discussed the
amendment. it just us at the table. we decide what we like the amendment, or we don't, we vote on it. whereas
it's not like a human services committee where you invite DHSP, and you invite that nonprofit afterschool
people, and you invite all these other people to the table, and we sit around and say how we come to solve the
problem. I guess that sort of a question in terms of yes MIT will… I don't know if they're on the phone now.
they will say their three minutes or two minutes and that is it. that is different than being at the table saying
okay how do we all get to the goal of 2035 and here's what our problems are and hear what our concerns are
how can we get those mini substations around the city? that doesn't happen in the ordinance committee. so, it is
something for us to think about. If we just pass these amendments, then it's codified its law. that other
discussions happening after the fact. it's something to think about this isn’t the best place to have those more in
the weed’s kind of conversations.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: just a correction, the IPCC save the recent report was code red for humanity literally is
what it was called. it has changed.
>> Iram Farooq: thank you chair McGovern I really wanted to bump it to Seth because he and the team have
done a lot of work on existing buildings and bringing their energy efficiency so he can speak to your question,
and I just also wanted to mention that BEUDO applies to a pretty wide spectrum of buildings. I know we have
sort of been focusing a lot on the very large, very capitalized players but there are number of smaller buildings
that are subject to the BEUDO amendments that do BEUDO and therefore the amendments… They will have
different levels of capacity in order to comply. I will just turn it over to Seth.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I think they can do it right I think they could totally do it. to directly answer your
question, I think you raise all those important things we've discussed which is the electrification, the
substations, the capacity of the grid. which is probably why what we really want to do is we want geothermal
microgrids across the entire city. we want grounds for heat exchange to be used to dramatically lower the load
on the existing electric structure because you are tapping into the earth's natural heat. There are several places
where that is already in place for large building, and they do not have to rely on… they can do it with the
existing electrical structure but that's exactly what… your specific question about retrofit versus new. It is easier
with newer but remember the existing BEUDERO amendments assume every existing building has to come
down to zero. it’s only a matter of by when.

>> Seth Federspiel: thank you I just want to remind you Mr. chair and rest of the councilors of the table that I
showed early in the presentation about the structure of the net zero action plan. so BEUDO amendments and
BEUDO as it currently stands is specifically designed to address existing buildings and all the existing
buildings. Obviously new buildings become existing buildings but there other parts of the net zero action plan
where we seek to move new buildings to achieving net zero emissions from the start. so BEUDO is specifically
focused on existing buildings and as others have said has a very different process for an existing building to
retrofit, to change its existing systems and take them out and replace them to achieve net zero emissions than it
is for new building to be designed to be net zero emissions from the start. I just want to make that distinction.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I do see Councillor Carlone, Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Simmons. I
saw Councillor Carlone and Councillor Zondervan hands pop up in relation to my question potentially. I am
going to ask you guys to hold on that because we are not going to get to this resolved tonight. I’m just worried
about the time. we got 30 people. That is potentially an hour and then we still have to hear Councillor
Zondervan's presentation and go to clarifying questions about that. we’re going to be well past at 7:30 pm if we
do those public comments and do all that right now. I don't think we need to talk. you can answer those if you
have something additional to add but don't feel… I don't waste time answering my questions. if that's okay?

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair I will be brief. my presentation is not very long.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: can you speak up it's very hard to hear you.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: I am coming to you right now from my living room in an all-electric, zero
building. it took me 15 years to retrofit but we are using 60% less energy overall to run our house. and we are
using less electricity overall to run our house from the grid because we have solar panels. so, the answer to your
question is complex. but the brief answer is it absolutely can be done. we absolutely have to do it and it does not
require bringing tons of electricity into the city. It can't require that. that's not a good solution. we have to do it
locally by using our local energy sources, geothermal, we have to use solar and then of course we bring in some
renewable energy from wind. and the BEUDERO structure is quite good. if you look at the amendments that
we are proposing it's like 5% of the text we are trying to amend. it includes 30 specific ways that these buildings
can offset their energy use by building or buying more renewable energy off-site that doesn't have to be piped
into Cambridge because the grid itself is going to become more renewable. it's a complicated answer but the
answer to your question is yes you can do this work and we have to do it.
>> E. Denise Simmons: thank you Mr. chair this has been a very good conversation. I did want to say two
things… or several things. quickly I wanted to get to public comments because I do want to hear people from
the community have to say. I want to thank my colleagues for the time and the talent they brought to this
process. Councillor Nolan exuberance is palpable. I do have concerns. i believe some these amendments are
fairly new. in Cambridge we as a city, we talk about being a leader. we have been a leader in transparency and
predictability. so, if you say to someone were going to do this and were going to do this in 2050 and then turn
around and just change it without having discourse, meaningful discourse, we are not doing what we say we do.
I think the vice mayor said that the ordinance committee is not the place to do it. I would respectfully ask that
some of these amendments… I’ve not heard from Councillor Zondervan… go back to committee to be properly
vetted. I don't know what the contraindications or the unintended consequences may be, and I’m just as
concerned about climate change as a person of color and know that some of the downsides of the climate
change impact my community more than any others. thank you for using the pictures of black people Ms.
Nolan. so, for me if we’re going to be about transparency, predictability that we need to be transparent and
predictable. and to do that we really need to take this back to the table and invite people to have a conversation.
I don't think it is sufficient enough to say well I talk to these people, and they knew it was coming. so, I want to
say with all sincerity I certainly respect the work that son I look forward to my colleague’s presentation that's
about tempering I would hope that we get rather soon to public comment I think you said chairperson there are
30 people and 7:00. I recommend we continue this conversation because it really is going to take more time. my
stronger recommendation would be to take it back to the environmental committee and really tease this out a lot
more. I yield the floor.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Dennis J. Carlone: just quickly, absolutely existing buildings are different, leases get finished at certain
times. I’m sure Seth and Iram are thinking about this. there would be a plan for existing buildings. so, one or
two floors would be vacant in two years. that's when work gets done and it can all be done until most of the
building is done. but nevertheless, it would speed it up quite a bit. I’m done. I won’t say anymore.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: Councillor Zondervan let me ask you this how long do you think your
presentation is.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: maybe 10 minutes.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: why don’t we do that. and maybe we can be a little bit maybe we can hold some
of our clarifying questions since we're going to come back, we can certainly revisit Councillor Zondervan's
presentation. and then get the public comment. the difference between if we get the public comments and we
recess that would be no public comment at the next meeting. if we adjourn would mean we would have public
comment at the next meeting. some we would have to decide that when we get there.

what I’m about to present here is a smaller set of amendments that are part of the green new deal and I’ve
worked on with Councillor Nolan and Councillor Carlone some of these ideas were presented last year as part
of the green new deal zoning petition and based on feedback from the planning board we pulled it out of zoning
and this part is being put into BEUDERO which wasn't available to us at that time. so, we are proposing three
amendments. one is to allow the alternative compliance payments called credits in the language to be used for
green jobs training programs. number two is to require all large new commercial buildings to pay for all
emissions and number three to include embodied emissions.
this is just showing some of the investments happening where across the street from Newtown court you can see
on this map all of these technology buildings that are creating tremendous economic opportunity but not for the
people living across the street. and we are dealing with a double injustice hear as councillor Simmons
mentioned, climate change disproportionately impacts people of color and low-income communities, and they
are excluded from the economic opportunities and their being displaced by the rising cost of housing that is
created by all of this high-end economic development. there is a lot of injustice happening and when we are
counteracting climate change, we have to keep that in mind and try to design policy that counteract both
economic injustices and climate injustice.
that's what we are trying to accomplish with the green new deal. as you know on Monday, we introduced a
proposal for a green jobs ordinance. thanks again to councillor Simmons and the mayor and Councillor Carlone
for their support on that. and the idea in this amendment here is simply to allow the alternative compliance
payments that are being made by the developers if their building isn't net zero to go towards those green jobs
training programs. this shows the actual text, and you can see it literally is just a few words at the end that say it
can be used for green jobs training program. that is amendment number one. then amendment number two is to
require all new commercial buildings to pay for all of their emissions. one question might be why? so this is
from a report of the department of energy resources, which is a state department, it shows, in the black line, the
projected emissions from buildings, this is throughout the state, through 2050 if we don't require them to stop
fossil fuels. the green triangle which I added is showing approximately the amount of emissions that they can be
avoided if we adopt a net zero standard next year 2023 for the new building. so, you can see how much
potential emissions we can avoid if we put in place requirements, they start consuming fossil fuels or stop
consuming fossil fuels. this is totally feasible, in fact yesterday morning department of energy resources
introduced net zero energy stretch code that we can potentially enact by next year. this is another quick example
of the impact of new buildings. new buildings projected up to 2050 by square footage are green at the top and
existing buildings are blue at the bottom. clearly the existing buildings will still dominate. by 2050 a significant
amount of construction that's going to happen between now and then. and all that green area could be zero
missions if we adopt the right policies now.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair .can everybody see my screen? I do want to preface by
saying the original net zero task force which I was a part of with Councillor Carlone, we did have conversations
with the business community at that time as well. I’m always happy and open to doing that again and more. but
I do have to say that the fact that 40 meetings were had without us, and we are also stakeholders doesn't mean
that somehow, we have to abide by this agreement because we were excluded from that conversation. it's never
too late so let's communicate and certainly reach out to some of these building owners and have this
conversation. I’m not in favor of sending this back to committee. we already had this last week. thank you,
Councillor Nolan, for presenting those amendments.

why the commercial buildings, and Seth really cover this well already, commercial buildings simply count for
the vast majority of our emissions and if we don't put in place stringent requirements for new buildings, we’re
going to see exactly the same result again as we did with MIT on main street. Seth also mentioned this earlier
6% of the buildings in the city are responsible for two thirds of the emissions. it's pretty straightforward. we

so, this is from another report showing that the building materials and construction are 11% of our global
emissions. that's a pretty significant number. that is currently completely unaccounted for. and most of that is in
the concrete, steel, and materials. it's relatively straightforward for us to calculate at least roughly what the
emissions contribution for a new building. the whole idea behind charging for those emissions is to create
economic pressures on those developers to minimize those emissions. this set of slides specified again the exact
language that creates the emissions requirements, and it basically says for new commercial buildings they
would have to pay for the embodies emissions over a ten-year period to gain alternative compliance credits. it
goes into more detail about what is to be included in the calculation as well is what we left out of the embodied
emissions calculation. this quickly just wrap up is a summary of the effect of the amendment. The BEUDERO
amendments as currently proposed would charge a new building, for the area that represents the excess
emissions, and according to BEUDERO they have to get those operating emissions to 0 by 2050. but if they
don't manage to do that which is simulated here in red than they can pay $234 per ton for those excess
emissions. what is important to note is that they would not pay for embodied emissions, and they would not pay
for the operational emissions that are allowed under the reduction schedule proposed by BEUDERO. what we
are proposing in these amendments is that the new commercial buildings would pay for all of their emissions
under these amendments and so as has been said earlier these emissions are all avoidable to a large extent it is
reasonable to say if you can’t avoid them then you have to pay for them, we would use those funds to do
emission reductions elsewhere and to create economic opportunity for low-income individuals. that is the
conclusion of my presentation.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: great thank you. councillor Simmons I assume that hand was from before.
>> E. Denise Simmons: yes, it was thanked you.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: any quick questions on that issue.
>> E. Denise Simmons: it wasn't. the question was I don't… I did not want to be thought of that I was trying to
cut off public participation. in terms of… you were right when you said if we recess this meeting, we won’t be
able to have public comment because we would've already had it. but if there is no appetite to bring this into a
forum where there can be more engagement because public comment doesn't give us the kind of engagement
that we needed to hear from people 's perspectives. then I would not recommend that we recess. just stay in
ordinance committee.

new buildings would avoid the problem in the first place to be net zero. so, the amendment for this is simply to
add a sentence which says all nonresidential commercial properties receive a special permit for 2022 and
beyond based on net zero. basically, they're not reducing from zero there expected to be at zero and if they have
any emission above zero, they will pay into the alternative compliance payment for those emissions which then
the city can use to install solar panels to help make affordable housing more energy efficient and to fund green
jobs training programs. then the last piece is the embodied emissions. this is just quickly showing what we mean
by that. so embodied emission are the emissions from reducing manufacturing, mining and materials that go
into the buildings. all the emissions that result from that as well as transporting those materials to the building
site in some cases these materials come from far away. and then of course the emissions produced by the actual
construction and heavy equipment to do that and here's why.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I have a thought on how we may want to do… we can possibly do all this, but I
will save that, keep you all in suspense until the end. and let's get to public comment. please state your name
and address for the record. obviously, we know what you're here to talk about. Mr. clerk can you call with first.
>> Kristine Jelstrup: 120 pleasant street. good evening and thank you so much for this opportunity to speak to. I
enjoyed the presentation. I will keep this short as I can hear you all well aware that the coming crisis is upon us.
and getting worse with every passing year. 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in Cambridge come from
buildings emissions. Emissions from all Cambridge buildings have gone up over 11% from 2012 – 2019. it is
imperative that we reverse this disturbing trend and move towards greenhouse gas reductions quickly. it's hard
to imagine reductions in the future when the trend has been to increase emissions. in order to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions, we need to hold super emitter buildings to account for all of their emissions. it's crucial to
Cambridge to pass the strongest BEUDO amendments possible. BEUDO is by far our best opportunity to

reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Cambridge. lastly Cambridge should aim to reach net zero emissions by
2035 not 2050 we need to act boldly, and we need to act now. thank you.

>> Margery Davies: I’m speaking as a member of the net zero action plan fund review task force. I appreciated
the opportunity to participate in the task force and have learned a lot from it. I’m also a member of the
Cambridge chapter of mother's out front. I have spoken to you a number of times about BEUDO. one thing I
want to make clear is in terms of BEUDO amendments as proposed by the community development
department, the net zero action plan task force was given the opportunity to comment on those proposed
BEUDO amendments once they've been submitted. the task force wasn't involved in crafting those BEUDO
amendments. I’ll be as brief as I can with several points. number one Cambridge needs to move more quickly.
it's been my main concern since the beginning of the task force work in Cambridge really needs to speed up in
my opinion. second point is that less than two months ago on December 13 the city council reaffirmed its
commitment originally made in 2017 for the goal of using 100% clean and renewable energy by 2035 not 2050.
point number three the situation is urgent. greenhouse gas emissions by buildings in Cambridge have gone up
over 11% not down in recent years. this is going in the wrong direction. point number four accountability. I’m
concerned that Cambridge does not hold itself accountable for the goals it has set. deadlines are often missed, or
we fail to enforce requirements. one troubling example is the rate of compliance with reporting requirements for
buildings covered by BEUDO. remember buildings have been required to report their emissions for the past six
years. in 2015 95% of BEUDO buildings reported their energy use. the percentage of buildings reporting has
gone steadily down every year since. by 2020 only 73% of BEUDO buildings reported. point number five. the
BEUDO amendments proposed by the community development department need to be strengthened. the
BEUDO amendments proposed by Councillor Nolan and Councillor Zondervan do just that and I hope that you
will support them. in conclusion this is not a competition. we are all in this together. city councilors, city staff
and Cambridge residents creating the strongest BEUDO amendments that we can… should be a group effort.
when we succeed, we will all be able to be proud of our roles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in
Cambridge. thank you very much.
>> Greg Carey Medlock: I live in 253 river street. today I’d like to express my support for the BEUDO
amendments as proposed by councilors Nolan and Zondervan. I moved to Cambridge recently with my wife and
son. One of the most appealing features of Cambridge is that it is a leader in progressive action, including
climate change mitigation. we feel strongly that it is our duty to leave the world a bit better for the next
generation. thank you, councilors, for your service and doing your part for the next generation. Cambridge is a
walkable, livable city with excellent public transit which strongly enables our ability to reduce emissions.
however, greenhouse gas emissions from buildings are increasing despite infrastructure for an emissions
monitoring put in place by BEUDO. building emissions have gone up by 11% and commercial institutional
buildings specifically we have seen at 29% increase in carbon emissions. as a scientist myself that has worked
in laboratory settings, I can tell you that this is not necessary. we need a coordinated and proactive response to
reduce building emissions to improve local air quality and mitigate our influence on the climate crisis. the
proposed BEUDO amendments do just that. climate change is an urgent and unparalleled problem. It impacts
our health, job security and homes especially from those vulnerable members of our community. we must move
quickly. I’m in support of reaching net zero by 2035 as committed to previously by the council. I urge the
ordinance committee and council to approve the amendments and to prioritize climate change action. thank you.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you.

>> David Rabkin: chair of the coming protection action committee. Tonight, I represent myself. I’m going to
respond to what I heard tonight and change my remarks a little bit. first to something Councillor McGovern put
on the table. mark we are going all electrics or pretty close. it's going to take a lot of work. it just a matter of
how fast it's going to be. so, we really have to focus on that. secondly BEUDO is about existing buildings. but
we also need to do something about new buildings. right now, when it comes to new buildings, we are waiting
for the state to update the stretch energy code. unfortunately, that's almost a year away. best case. how much in
construction are we committed to between now and then. it is a big, missed opportunity. we need to take action
in the short run. we need an approach probably based on special permits. that seems like a likely good partial
solution. I recommend keeping it simple so it can be designed and implemented quickly.

>> Robert Michael Pittsley: hello I’m calling from 56 Norfolk Street. the many effects of climate change have
begun to take place and finally become blatantly unignorable. We are now living a scientifically predicted time
period faced with emerging diseases, food insecurity and sea level rise. one with so many undesirable realities
faced by environmental justice communities. we need to do everything we can to transition to a system more
conducive to public and environmental health. we must protect the viability of this new decision along with our
health by protecting our air quality. urban vegetation has several important functions beyond aesthetics. our
trees and shrubs have multiple impacts on air quality like for instance schools that are surrounded by green
space have lower levels of pollution in their classroom. in the past three years the focus around respiratory
health that we do our best to protect our air. the indirect effect of natural gas leakage on urban vegetation is
obvious since the soil gas phase composition near a leak is unfavorable for plant growth. within the gas zone the
oxygen concentration is very low to zero while carbon dioxide is high. consequently, root growth is stopped,
and respiration is inhibited so uptake of water and nutrients are reduced and eventually the plants die. after the
effects of gas leakage may persist for a considerable period of time. toxic components can be left in the soil as
reduced and nonorganic substances. effective restrictions and prevention of leakage of natural gas as well as
ensuing injury to street trees can only be realized if there's good cooperation between the city council, parks
department and municipal gas companies. I’m here tonight asking the Cambridge move faster, reach higher and
set the example. we can and must reach net zero emissions by 2035 not 2050. vast amounts of scientific
research clearly explain and can confirm the danger and failure of our recurring energy systems as well as the
viability of a more sustainable alternatives that are modeled in cities around the world. city council please adopt
the higher standards please provide jobs for people to build a healthier future held the buildings that we need.
and please ban gas hookups for buildings and reflect the 2035 that's your goal upon old BEUDO targets and
senders.

third my major point. please remember CPAC’s letters of December about BEUDERO . they're very supportive
of what came out of those 40 conversations. as was talked about earlier. and yet we wrote in a letter that
BEUDERO as proposed still falls short of the city's needs. so, we recommended that the city accelerate the
timelines in BEUDERO. considers including smaller buildings within the framework. explore additional
measures to reduce emissions from the highest emitting buildings more quickly than planned. create a schedule
to phase out the ACP that will require the elimination of on-site fossil fuel burning systems. evaluate the ACP
more frequently than planned to start at the end of the first compliance period. adopts the commonwealth new
stretch code as quickly as we possibly can. and finally invest in programs that provide the access to the
technical and financial resources that property owners are going to need in order to be able to actually make
improvements to the buildings that we need to meet our emissions goals. given official recommendations
coming from a player that is very supportive and should have bought in completely. I don't think it's appropriate
to label BEUDERO thus far as a result of a consensus process. as challenging it was to get where we are we
still have a way to go. thank you.

>> Sarah gallop: thank you can you hear me. good evening, everyone. MIT has been working closely with city
staff and Cambridge stakeholders since before BEUDO's inception in 2014. we been engaged in all phases of

unfortunately, we’re not able to support BEUDO tonight because of the new amendments that were introduced
two days ago. these late edits have not been discussed with stakeholders. and are not endorsed by city staff. this
last-minute flurry of activity runs counter to the nature of the entire BEUDO effort . while we've only briefly
scanned proposed edits, we that laboratories have been deleted from a section that has been extensively
researched. has anybody asked the BEUDO laboratory working group for its input? we noticed the time frames
have been drastically condensed leaving open questions regarding feasibility and available technology. has
anybody reached out to Eversource to get its view? MIT is committed to a comprehensive action plan of
achieving net zero emissions by 2026 and eliminating all direct emissions by 2050. it's no coincidence our
climate goals are aligned with the city's net zero action plan and the BEUDO amendments.
it's because we work together day in and day out on these matters. we share data, best practices, expertise, and
philosophies. we argue, offer counterproposals, rewrite, and regroup. and we make significant advancements as
a result of our commitment to the planet and as to the most reliable way of bringing about progress.
collaboration. we urge you to advance the November 2020 BEUDO amendments with continuing dialogue in
the areas we noted and reject the amendments that were introduced on Monday. thank you.
>> Thomas Lucey: sorry about that. good evening. I’m tom lucy speaking on behalf of Harvard university.
Harvard is committed to working with the city regarding reducing emissions to climate change and
sustainability for decades. we've advanced to our own second-generation climate goals and on our campus
through leading-edge goals. we were pleased to have participated and contributed for many years to the city
staff’s run stakeholder process that resulted in the BEUDO recommendations released in November. now given
the time limit in public comment we are going to address those recommendations, but we will react to the new
amendments were unveiled Monday night. Those new amendments demand the same full and thorough vetting
of public dialogue as the BEUDO process. We implore the council to take the time to reengage all stakeholders
to ensure it remains a civil and respectful dialogue. Everyone on the call shares the same goals of addressing
emissions and saving the planet. no one has a monopoly on those sentiments nor the knowledge of the best
approach to achieve them. as for the newly crafted amendments we have some initial comments and questions.
given the state of current technologies these proposed regulations will push building owners to explore
electrification at the same time. We have not seen a plan showing that the regional or local grid is capable of
handling these changes so rapidly. so, we asked is the city working with the state and Eversource to understand
the impact of this regulation and what the impact would be on the regional electric grid and specifically
Cambridge. is Cambridge planning to do a feasibility study to understand the scope of changes left to meet the
2030 proposed deadlines and to understand the risks and costs involved? what is the anticipated increase
electrical demand? and how will this electrical supply be generated? and if the city actively engage with
Eversource to provide this increased demand to the city? this removes our ability to utilize our subject matter
expertise as well as our rigorous approach to research and science to achieve net zero emissions. we want to do
this in partnership with the city and to identify the best path to achieve our shared goal of science-based net zero
solutions. I hope we get the opportunity to do so and that these amendments are not fast tracked but would
benefit from true scientific analysis and appropriate public dialogue.

related to performance requirements. we applaud the city's commitment to an open and transparent process.
with plentiful opportunities to engage, review, comment and co-develop solutions to constantly improve
BEUDO. our plan for this hearing was to express support for the November 2021 amendments with a request
for continued collaboration on a few remaining issues. those topics include clarity around the emissions
baseline. the role of carbon offset credit products and further development of the alternative compliance credit.
we have every confidence that we can address these matters together to our mutual satisfaction just as we have
for a multitude of details over the past several years.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you. okay. I’m going to go to Councillor Zondervan then I have a thought.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair and to my colleagues on the committee. my suggestion
was and remains that we keep this matter in committee. we will schedule another hearing and will have time in
between to talk with anyone who would like to discuss these matters in more detail. and I do take some issue
with the scolding that we are receiving on not reaching out because people know our phone numbers and they
can reach out to us as well. I’m happy to proceed in that way and I think we will have plenty of opportunity for
dialogue before we bring this forward.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: thank you and thank every single public speaker. I do want to respond. I totally
understand and endorsed, and I know the frustration. I will remind people that agenda was public last week. it is
true though that this specifics of this were not known until that agenda was public last week. I think if we keep
this in committee… I also want to do as chair of the health environment committee have it be more of a
roundtable to any player including from both Harvard and MIT. have those discussions. I do want to remind all
of us that if we do want an open and transparent process my understanding is that those 40 meetings were
closed-door meetings that were not in the public domain. there were only with building owners. CPAC was not
involved. Net zero action task force was not involved. The climate crisis working group was not involved. The
city council was not involved. That was not an open and transparent process with all the stakeholders of the
table. that's where we need to go next. that process led to particular amendments. which some of us are now
saying we need to be changed in the face of again the IPCC latest report issued last year which literally says,
"code red for humanity”. so, I understand all of us want to get there. and the question is how to get there. I want
to have those discussions. I want us to get there. I want Harvard, MIT, all the building owners in the city to be
with us at the table. I know many of my colleagues committed to that. let's not throw this out as an idea that we
shouldn't endorse something that the rest of the city didn't even vet before it was just put on the table. once it
was put on the table some of us came together working with a range of people across the city. I was not just out
of our heads. it was working with a range of experts across the city. I agree there are lots of questions to ask
about electric capacity. about how we are doing it. I would love to keep this in committee but also letting my
colleagues know if you think that makes sense that that is the appropriate venue to have very quickly as soon as
we can schedule it a health and environment committee meeting and run it like a roundtable and specifically
invite any of the folks were in those 40 meetings if they would come and talk about and Eversource and the city.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you Co-Chair. I think the issues raised primarily by the institutions are fair. I think
my colleagues have responded in part but as Councillor Nolan was referring to, I think the people we talk to
need to show up at this roundtable. it might be that I have some background in green architecture but not in all
of these fields. that is for sure. and we do need the experts to talk about this. we are not saying just accept it
because it is submitted by us. we have to have these discussions but at the end it's only about our world and our
city and nothing is more important than this and trying to push the effort forward to me if we can make this
work, why not? that's really what it comes down to. if we can clean up the air sooner, why not? that is what this
is about. yes, there's been negotiation as my fellow councilors have said we've not been a part of that. and we
are the ones that make those decisions. final decisions. we have to influence each other in the right way. thank
you.
>> Burhan Azeem: thank you Mr. chair. apologies for not using the hand thing my zoom isn't working. I had
two questions for the city or mainly for the city but also if the amendment makers want to answer that is fine as
well. I’m curious why these amendments, why the original proposal focuses only on large buildings rather than
small buildings considering they also are a large producer of emissions. on top of that why transportation
emissions are not included. my sense is if you have an empty parking lots would be easier for to qualify for
these than the equivalent house just because the empty parking lot uses less construction materials but obviously
is used for transmitting relating more gas-powered vehicles. so, its fine if it doesn't fit into this particular
version. I was just curious why those were left out of the original proposal.

>> Seth Federspiel: again, net zero action… I will take those two-question reversed. the net zero action plans
are exclusively focused on building emissions. which again are about 83% of the cities emissions we are in the
process of developing a net zero transportation plan that will address the transportation sector but that's a
separate process. not that it's not being considered, just not part of this policy. in terms of the building size
threshold the building energy use disclosure ordinance that is in effect and was adopted in 2014 applies to
specifically to the largest buildings in Cambridge. the commercial buildings 25,000 square ft. or greater. and
residential buildings larger than 50 units. those buildings account for about 70% of the building sector
emissions. even though they're only about 6% of the number of buildings. so, the proposal the original proposal
from CDD does not propose any changes to those thresholds.
>> Burhan Azeem: through you my chair the reason I ask… I forget the exact number but 8% of our buildings
are responsible for 60% of the emissions but in the original slide you showed it was really about square footage.
To me the square footage of the buildings roughly corresponds with the percent of emissions to the large

>> Seth Federspiel: again, this was considered at some length when the BEUDO ordinance was originally
adopted. consideration of the balancing point between what is asked of building owners and how many building
owners would be required to take those actions. and so, the 25,000 square-foot and 50 units thresholds were
established to capture again that bulk of the square footage that you mention while requiring a relatively small
number of building owners to go through the administrative process to do that reporting. and in terms of
addressing emissions from all the buildings in the city that's where the full net zero action plan is really
important to consider all of the different actions. For buildings of that are smaller than the BEUDO threshold,
the updated next zero action plan proposes that we consider transaction point-based requirements. for those
smaller buildings when they're being sold or renovated or leased could use those natural turnover points as
opportunities for upgrades lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I’m going to go to mayor Siddiqui it looks like you're coming to us from a
bunker.
>> mayor Siddiqui: I’m fine with keeping this in committee. I will say on this topic. we've… the council and
past councils have talked about various issues, everything from the linkage fee and increasing it to. to this issue
where fundamentally sometimes there is disagreement and partnership may not be able to happen. with that said
I think it is important to have our partners at the table and help us think through a lot of different decision points
but ultimately from what I’ve seen is that on this topic there have been a ton of meetings and there is a sense
from a number of individuals, activists who feel like they haven't been heard. They are invited to the table but
there is fundamental disagreement. we should definitely keep having a conversation about these amendments
and at the end of the day… I think ultimately, we have to vote these up and down. and I think there may not be
consensus here. I think this is just the reality of the situation. if were looking for consensus on this based on
everything, I’ve heard in all the meetings that have happened. I am not sure that exists. and it is important to
hear from and have further conversations. I will stop there but I’m happy to keep this in committee as we
planned. not to vote in anything tonight.
>> Paul F. Toner: thank you Mr. cochair. I’m going to throw my I’m the new guy card in the table. I’m hearing
that there were 40 meetings over four years but for some reason city councilors were not invited and other folks
were not invited to the meetings. I’m not clear on that of why that is the case. but I do want to encourage
Councillor Nolan that if we are not going to take it out of the ordinance committee that you have that hearing.
At least from this my experience and my first ordinance meeting this doesn't seem like the appropriate venue to
actually get to the real core issues about what can and can't be done, what's realistic? what's practical? I’m not
suggesting that everybody's going to agree but it sounds like according to the mayor, that even activists felt like
they weren't heard. if there's an opportunity to have a different venue to talk about these issues and get
everybody's input before we finally vote on it, I would appreciate that going forward.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: what it was going to suggest…we said from the beginning it was going to be
another ordinance committee meeting nothing was advancing today. that was clear from the beginning. so, we
can keep this in committee and send the subject matter to health and environment chaired by Councillor Nolan
so that she can bring it up at that meeting or is that unnecessary, can we just keep it in committee, then she just
calls her own meeting? obviously the goal being… I would think Councillor Nolan that you call that meeting
soon. before the next ordinance committee meeting so we have whatever comes out of that meeting if other
things need to be amended or adjusted, we have that for the next ordinance committee meeting. so, Mr. clerk is
there any procedural thing, or can Councillor Nolan just call that meeting… now that it is in ordinance do, we
have to do anything to send back or can it just happen.

commercial large buildings in general exceed 2% of us were footage in the city they were like 70% of the
emissions. I don't see a great disparity between the surface area of these sizes. I’m wondering… I’m worried a
little bit that triple-deckers for example don't get included but once you get the four or five stories… whatever
the threshold is it seems a little bit arbitrary is there a reason to not include smaller buildings?

>> Anthony Ivan Wilson, clerk: through you my chair there is no procedural motion that needs to happen. i
would caution that may be talk to, I don't know if there's anybody from the law department on the call. this is a
process predicated under the general laws. I don't know if it precludes something like that. my one point of
caution for the council.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: anyone from the solicitor's office.
>> Megan Bayerle corrects me if I’m wrong, but I don't believe this is not a zoning petition.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: just to comment. i know this is radical in the political landscape that we are in
these days. maybe we should try to assume good intentions and everybody's part instead of bad intentions on
everybody's part. what makes Cambridge great this we heard this from a new commissioner of public health
came here from Texas it's great to be in a city where you don't have to convince people that science is real. I
don't think that anybody even those councilors will raise questions about the process and who spoke to… is
saying we don't believe the science and want to delay this as long as possible. we can try not to… just because
somebody asked the question or raises a concern doesn't mean that they don't agree with what the ultimate goals
are. and if so, let's not do that to each other as this goes forward. and I think that was ultimately going to make
the leader in this. by asking a question like okay we’re going for 2035 is that possible? that is not my saying that
I think climate change doesn't exist and it's a hoax. It is my asking are we setting a goal they can actually be
achieved and help me understand it. let's not do that to each other in this conversation. it is too important.
Councillor Zondervan I will go to you. So, it sounds like I guess one of the questions with answers we want to
recess or adjourn? again the implication of that is if we recess the next meeting will be a direct continuation of
this meeting which means no public comments, or we adjourn and we come back and we can pick it up where
we left off and have public comment those are the only… I believe the only two significant differences with
either of those decisions.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair I’m happy to make a motion to adjourn once we are ready
for that. I don't think we should recess as we have been talking about there's a lot of further public conversation
that needs to happen. I certainly don't want to avoid the public comment in our next meeting. I want to agree
with you wholeheartedly. I don't question any of my colleagues’ intentions. I don't doubt that we understand the
challenges that we face with climate crisis. I do think that there are commercial interests that are protecting
themselves. that is their job. we need to have that conversation but as the mayor said at the end of the day, we
have to decide which way we want to go on this, that is our job… our responsibility. I’m perfectly happy to
have a hearing on this in Councillor Nolan's committee. I think it would be great. I do want also to point out that
in the ordinance committee routinely developers make presentations to us about their projects. there is nothing
preventing us from inviting building owners and developers to come to the next hearing and make a
presentation about their concerns and questions and again we can have conversations off-line as well about any
concerns that they have about it. I look forward to those conversations. regardless of the outcome we are all
learning and growing on this issue by having those conversations.
>> vice mayor Mallon: thank you Mr. chair was also going to throw my support behind adjourning rather than
recessing that seems like that is a motion on the table. I will yield back.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I would say Councillor Zondervan I think you're right. I think we could have
another ordinance committee meeting and have Harvard, MIT or whoever come. I would prefer to do it in
another committee just so that we can… what comes back ordinance might be the same amendments, it might
be different. To have a presentation in ordinance and then there's not a lot of time to discuss it and do the work
so I think do that work in the subcommittee bring it to ordinance ready to go and there may be nothing that
changes, I don't know. we're sort of… correct me if I’m wrong Councillor Zondervan we are scheduling
ordinance committee meetings out until the end of march at this point. so, there is not a ton of time for… a little
bit of time you can even have more than one meeting.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Anthony Ivan Wilson, clerk: I apologize. sorry about that.

>> Burhan Azeem: sorry I have a problem with a hand feature on zoom. I would put it up as I could. through
you Mr. Chair I would be interested, if possible, to hear that city's response to the amendments. The
presentation covered by the city was mostly for the original version that the amendments. and I’d be curious to
hear what the city is thinking about those amendments I’m not sure if that's possible, but I’d be interested if it is.

Ordered:

That section 6.04.020 of the Municipal Ordinances of the City of Cambridge
entitled “Dogs-License required-Fee” be amended to read as follows:
6.04.020 Dogs-License required-Fee.
Every dog six months old or over shall be licensed
pursuant to G.L. c. 140, § 137. As proof that the dog has been
spayed or neutered, the owner or keeper shall present to the
Director of the Animal Commission ("Director") or his or her
designee a certificate of the registered veterinarian who
performed the operation. Effective June 1, 2015, the fee for
such license shall, except as otherwise provided, be ten dollars
for a spayed or neutered dog and thirty dollars for a dog that is
not spayed or neutered. If the Director or his or her designee is
satisfied that the certificate of the veterinarian who performed
the operation cannot be obtained, he or she may accept in lieu
thereof a sworn statement of a veterinarian registered and
practicing in the Commonwealth, describing the dog, and
stating that he or she has examined the dog and that, in his or
her opinion, it has been spayed or neutered. Pursuant to G.L. c.
140, § 139, no fee shall be charged for a license issued under
this section for a service animal as defined by the Americans
with Disabilities Act or regulations promulgated thereunder or
for dog owners aged 70 years or older. No part of the fee shall
be refunded because of the subsequent death, loss, spaying,
castration, removal from the Commonwealth or other disposal

refunded.

Porter Square - please hit the pause button on roadway alterations

I’ve written before expressing my dissatisfaction with the planned changes to traffic, parking and bike lane
configurations on Mass Ave north of Harvard Square and especially in Porter Square.
I’m writing to express myself again as I’ve heard or seen nothing in the current planning and implementation that
seriously addresses the likely short and longer term negative impacts on quality of life for the vast majority of residents
and visitors to Cambridge and on the business community in the Mass Ave corridor.
I enjoy having a diverse set of services, retailers, and restaurants within walking distance of my residence. Because the
residential density of Cambridge isn’t really that great (and no one is arguing that they want it to be even denser, are
they?) these businesses rely on convenient parking for very large percentages of their customers. Take the parking
away, businesses will fail, the quality of residing in Cambridge will become a lot worse, and visitors won’t come to spend
money.
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Taking parking away to accommodate wider or separate bike lanes won’t
make biking safer. It won’t cause bikers to observe signals at intersections or to yield right of way to
pedestrians. Violations of both sorts are so common that I never walk anywhere for very long in Porter Square or along
Mass Ave without observing both.
Taking parking away will reduce the efficiency of motor vehicle travel and parking on both Mass Ave and intersecting
streets, thereby increasing vehicle idling and associated emissions. Travelled on north Mass Ave or through Inman
Square lately? Why are you adding that burden to life in Cambridge?
It seems like all would be a lot better served by your sentiment and efforts if (a) bicyclists are encouraged to travel on
streets other than Mass Ave unless their destination is a business or residence on Mass Ave, and (b) that concerted
effort be given to create off-street parking before you move to replace parking spaces removed from Mass Ave (as you
seem hell bent on that course anyway), and to locate such parking where it will support a diverse and thriving set of
retailers, restaurants, and services that will enhance the quality of life for the majority of residents of and visitors to
Cambridge.
We all want what we want, but the majority of residents and users of the Mass Ave corridor do not favor separate bike
lanes if this results in removal of parking or creating more congestion and inefficient travel.
Tell me this hasn’t fallen on deaf ears?
Thank you for your attention.

This is crazy

Dear City Council, City Manager and others,
I was just crossing at a crosswalk on Mass Ave when a female biker (mid 20s), on a Blue Bike, without a helmet AND
talking on her phone, stopped next to where i was crossing. She lit a joint, and then wobbled out into the car lane
without looking (thankfully no cars coming!!) as she took off, smoking her joint, talking on the phone and barely being
able to ride down Mass Ave. What are your plans for this kind of disaster waiting to happen? You MUST start addressing
bike safety issues directly (rather than claiming its a bike lane issue), otherwise, you are simply faking concerns about
deaths, since ALL three of the deaths in last ten were caused by biker error. And this young woman was just extremely
lucky, at least this time and in this moment.
Best,
Lee Jenkins

Residents Alliance supports Emissions Accounting Zoning Petition

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in strong support of the Emissions Accounting Zoning Petition, which is
one part of the “Green New Deal” proposal.
This zoning petition amends the Green Building Requirements (Article 22.2 of the zoning code) to standardize what must
be provided through the existing emissions accounting requirement, and adds an embodied emissions calculation for
new non-residential buildings. It defines “total greenhouse gas emissions.”
The amendments would require emissions and energy use estimates for each year the building is operating until
2050. This will provide multiple opportunities for future modifications to the building to achieve net zero.
We are very happy that the Planning Board supports this petition. We hope the Ordinance Committee will give it a
favorable recommendation and the Council will pass it as soon as possible.
Thanks,

4.4.b

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to express my strong support for POR 2022 #63 in
support of the Fair Share Amendment. Our state has the resources to make transformative
investments in education and transportation, but we cannot deploy them effectively because of
our outmoded and inequitable flat income tax.
Our K-12 education system is in dire need of new funding. When I was a student in Cambridge
Public Schools, I had access to an excellent public education thanks to committed educators and
unrivaled per-pupil funding, but the promise of such an education doesn’t extend to every
Cambridge student, let alone to students in structurally underfunded districts. Funding enabled
by Fair Share can expand access to pre-school, arts and athletic programs that have been cut in
many districts, building and grounds maintenance, and other essential expenditures in districts
across Massachusetts.
This revenue would similarly transform our transportation system. The MBTA faces a state-ofgood-repair backlog of more than $10 billion, and needs $1.25 billion in new, dedicated revenues
annually to maintain service and make planned upgrades. Transportation investment is vital for
climate change mitigation and adaptation—public transit access reduces carbon emissions, and
our transportation infrastructure is at grave risk from rising sea levels. Fair Share is the clearest
path we have for generating the revenue we need for these investments.
Fundamentally, prosperity in Massachusetts relies on our education and transportation systems—
the high-income households who will be taxed under Fair Share owe a substantial measure of
their success to past state investments in education and transportation. These households
currently pay lower effective state tax rates than most Massachusetts residents, and passing Fair
Share creates a mechanism for them to pay for the systems responsible for their prosperity.
Thank you for your time, and thank you to Councillors Zondervan, Nolan, McGovern, and
Azeem for sponsoring this order.
Best wishes,

Will MacArthur

No more quick build

Dear City Council and City Manager,
As we get older, driving becomes more complicated. Roads equipped
with quickbuild bike lanes are confusing for older people -- especially
those who don't live in Cambridge and are not used to them. My mom,
for example, is 85. She has macular degeneration, lattice, macular edema
and a host of other eye problems. During daylight hours, she can still
drive from Lexington to Porter Square to visit me. But she - like many
people who have difficulty driving - gets confused and nervous when
driving through construction - and that's basically what quickbuild is.
Visually, it's as confusing and stressful as driving through a construction
project. And it's ugly, too.
As a resident of Cambridge I do not support a quickbuild plan between
Beech Street and Roseland on Mass Ave. Porter Square has already been
redesigned within the last few years to increase bicycle safety. We have
the time to do this right. A design needs to be found that allows for safe
streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly and disabled.
Sincerely,
Susan Labandibar

Support of RISE Policy Order

Dear City Councilors,
I would like to briefly voice my support for the Cambridge RISE program. Given how economically well endowed our city
is (though we actively thwart that endowment and impact potential with perpetual annual property tax reductions
mostly going towards the wealthy and could craft a much more targeted policy!), it would be wonderful to pass along
some of this boon to our city’s least fortunate, especially single caretakers. Cambridge has an opportunity to be a leader,
and a “laboratory of democracy”, showing our state and federal governments the impact potential of such policies.
Thank you for your time and hangin in there today - sounds like one of those long meetings!
Best,
Raffi Mardirosian

Written Testimony In Support of Policy Order #61:

Thank you for the opportunity for Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC) to submit testimony
in support of Policy Order #61 putting the Cambridge City Council on record in support of the Fair Share
Amendment. As many of you know, CEOC is Cambridge’s anti-poverty community action agency. Our
mission is to empower people and mobilize resources to fight poverty’s causes and impacts through education
and organizing.

The Fair Share Amendment is a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts constitution that will be on the
November 2022 ballot. The amendment would secure much needed capital investments in both transportation
and education by creating an additional 4% tax on personal income above $1,000,000. Although 4% may seem
small, this increase would generate an additional $2 billion per year in revenue for Massachusetts. That
revenue will be constitutionally required to be spent on transportation and public education, specifically
“quality public education and affordable public colleges and universities, and for the repair and maintenance of
roads, bridges and public transportation.”

The City of Cambridge has an unprecedented level of income inequality; of “innovation cities” nationwide,
Cambridge ranks a startling seventh in income inequality, with the highest earning quintile earning over 26
times that of the lowest earning income quartile. And as we have seen especially during the COVID-19
pandemic, Cambridge’s low-income residents, the primary population that CEOC serves, has been
disproportionately negatively impacted, compared to Cambridge’s wealthy. In education, we’ve seen it in

remote education for children. Think of who had the ability to afford tutors, the parents who were able to work
from home or afford in-home childcare. Now more than ever, we need investments in our public schools to
help students recover from the effects of the pandemic, and to ensure that all students have access to a
complete and well-rounded education.

Even with the pandemic starting to ease, we are still seeing our clients, low-wage earners, individuals whose
primary language is not English, those with disabilities, those living in subsidized housing, and seniors
struggling to get by. Many of our clients are behind on rent, unable to pay utility bills, having trouble buying
food or securing a job, while multi-millionaires have seen their net worth skyrocket. These vastly different
experiences of the pandemic highlight why, now more than ever, we need investment in public pre K-12
education to help students and families rebound from the pandemic. We need investment in public universities
to increase accessibility to quality, affordable higher education for our low- and middle-income families.

It’s time for the wealthy to pay their fair share. For years, the highest-income households in Massachusetts
have paid a smaller share of their income in state and local taxes than any other group. The proposed
amendment would only affect taxes for the very highest income earners in the state, and the $1 million
threshold would be adjusted each year with inflation. I urge the Cambridge City Council to show their support
the Fair Share Amendment by passing Policy Order #61 to show the state that our city prioritizes equity and
quality education for all.

Thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony.

Sincerely,

Pass PO #10, endorse Fair Share Amendment

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance to ask you to pass PO #10 supporting the Fair Share Amendment. The
Cambridge Residents Alliance enthusiastically endorses the Fair Share Amendment.
There are so many reasons to endorse the Fair Share Amendment. For years Massachusetts has disinvested in
infrastructure and education, which disproportionately hurts low income families and people of color. This tax will
provide $1 - 2 billion per year for the investments we need. Even with federal money coming in for education and
infrastructure, the Commonwealth still needs a long-term sustainable solution.
State income tax, state sales tax, and local property tax are all regressive forms of taxation that disproportionately fall
on the poor, the elderly, and communities of color. In contrast, the Fair Share Amendment is sometimes called the
Millionaires Tax, because it will only fall on the very very rich, people with incomes over $19,000 per week. It's time for
everyone to pay their fair share, so we can all succeed.
Thanks,
Lee

Public comment re: CMA 2 and CMA 3 City Council meeting 4/11/2022
Cover Memo for CBI Report12.pdf; Cambridge CBI Assessment.pdf

Dear Mayor and City Councillors:

The City's transportation planning process for the CSO is broken.
The City engaged a consultant, Carri Hulet of the Consensus Building Institute to evaluate
community engagement efforts for the 2017 Quick-Build Cambridge Street cycle lane 'pilot' and
make recommendations for public involvement on future projects. The report and
recommendations were transmitted to City Councillors in February 2020. Key recommendations
have yet to be implemented and were completely ignored on the North Mass. Ave. project. There
still is no structure in place to engage key stakeholders in advance or at any stage. And no attempt
has yet been made to assess impacts of loss of parking and access on local businesses and
residents.
Also, public meetings are still being facilitated by City subject experts rather than someone skilled
at communication and running meetings on contentious issues. As a result, more and more
residents bring their concerns to this mike, because they see themselves as citizens with rights
and not as subjects, they've learned that Quick-Build projects have permanent impacts. Don't they
deserve good information on project impacts and a forum for public discussion before projects
like the $40-million plus Mass Ave 4 are approved?
Speaking of good information, the economic impact study outlined in CMA #3 also ignores the
2020 consultant's recommendation for a city-and-business joint fact finding process to attempt to
qualify and quantify the impacts of pilot projects that are already in place. Stakeholders as well as
City officials should have this important information as a basis for evaluating all future CSO
projects, shouldn't they?
Thank you for your consideration,
--John Pitkin

MEMORANDUM
To: The Honorable, The City Council
From: Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager
Date: February 6, 2020
Re: Consensus Building Institute Report
Cambridge Quick-Bulld Projects Community Assessment

I am pleased to share the report produced by the Consensus Building Institute (CBI), Cambridge
Quick-Build Projects Community Assessment. This report was commissioned by my office
based on Input and suggestions from the City Council and members of the Cambridge
community. As noted in the Executive Summary, the purpose of this assessment was to

understand what residents, businesses, and civic organizations, as well as City staff and
leadership think about the effectiveness of the community engagement efforts on quick-build
projects to date, and to solicit their recommendations for communications and public
involvement on future projects. For reference, these projects are transportation improvements

that are intended to improve safety and mobility for everyone who uses our transportation
system, and particularly for users ofsustainable transportation modes such as people who walk,
bike, and use public transportation. They are referred to as quick-build because they typically use
pavement markings, signs, vertical delineators (often referred to as flex posts), and other simple
traffic control devices to implement these safety and mobility improvements in a relatively short
time frame (e.g., less than a year from initial planning to project implementation). This is
compared to the longer period of time required to fully plan, design, and construct major capital
projects, which typically take several years (although it is important to note that Cambridge
generally moves capital projects significantly more quickly than most municipalities).
Starting with a couple ofone-block "pop-up separated bicycle lanes implemented in late 2016,
the City of Cambridge has implemented a number ofquick-build projects over the past three
years, which represents a change in approach from the typical capital projects the City had
pursued before. These include pedestrian and bicycle safety projects implemented on the western
segment of Cambridge Street, and on Massachusetts Avenue and Brattle Street near Harvard
Square, and bicycle safety and public transit priority projects on Mount Auburn Street and South
Massachusetts Avenue. While all of these projects included some elements of community
engagement, they generated significant concerns about the level and type of outreach that was
performed, particularly for the projects on Cambridge Street and Brattle Street. Based on these

concerns, the members of the City Council (particularly former Mayor Marc McGovern and
Councillor Alanna Mallon) suggested that the City undertake an assessment of the outreach done
for these projects and determine potential improvements to the community engagement process.
After reviewing this suggestion and other feedback from the community, we determined that
such an assessment would be helpful to guide future engagement efforts, and engaged the
Consensus Building Institute to produce the attached report, which assesses the community
engagement done to date and make recommendations about possible ways to improve our
outreach as we move forward with additional projects. It is very important to note that this effort
and the associated recommendations does not imply any reduction in the City's support for
improving cyclist safety and quickly building out the network of safe bicycle facilities, but rather
a desire to improve our outreach process in a way that allows us to make inclusive and equitable
decisions.

This assessment and evaluation is based on an extensive set of stakeholder interviews conducted
by Cam Hulet from CB1, leading to three key recommendations which are described briefly in
the Executive Summary and detailed in the final section of the report:
1. Support a small group of representative stakeholders and City staff in a collaborative
effort to design a standard, adaptable community engagement process for quick-build
projects.

2. Evaluate the potential for a "medium-builcT or hybrid model.
3. Evaluate the quick-build projects' impacts on small businesses.
In reviewing the report, it is important to recognize that because the assessment is based on
stakeholder interviews (including with City staff), the descriptions in the report represent the
opinions and perspectives of those stakeholders, based on their experience interacting with the
City on these projects. As a result, the perspectives expressed in the report show a range of
opinions and experiences that are not always consistent with each other, and that may not fully
agree with the perspectives of City staff involved in these projects. As an example, the report
mentions suggestions from the community about more fully involving planning staff in these
projects, as opposed to simply engineering staff, when the reality is that the projects fully
engaged both planning and engineering staff from the three key departments involved in
transportation (Community Development; Traffic, Parking, + Transportation; and Public Works).
Nonetheless, these perspectives are an important lived reality In terms of the outcomes from
these projects and need to be given full consideration as we continue to move forward with the
implementation of safety and mobility improvements for people who bike, walk, and use transit.
This is particularly important given the City Council's clearly stated policy goal of quickly
buiiding out the city's network of separated bicycle lanes, as represented by the passage of the
Cycling Safety Ordinance during the previous City Council term. We have also continued to
move forward with additional quick-build projects even as this assessment was underway,
acknowledging that there continues to be strong support for these projects, even as there is a
recognition of the need to continue to improve our outreach process.

In presenting this report to the City Council, I am seeking feedback on both the overall contents
of the report and the first recommendation to engage a representative group of stakeholders and

process for quick-bulld projects. Based on that feedback from the Council, along with other
community members, I will then work with key City staff to determine the appropriate next steps
to continue to enhance our community engagement efforts while moving forward with critical
safety and mobility improvements.

4.9.c

From September 2018 through January 2019, the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts
commissioned an assessment of the community engagement processes that were undertaken
on quick-build projects to install separated bike lanes in various locations around the city. The
purpose of the assessment was to understand what residents, businesses, and civic
organizations, as well as City staff and leadership think about the effectiveness of the
community engagement efforts on these projects to date, and solicit their recommendations for
communications and public involvement on future projects. This assessment was conducted by
Carri Hulet, Senior Mediator with the Consensus Building Institute, through confidential
interviews with these stakeholders. A list of the interviewees is included in the appendix.
Starting in 2017, the City of Cambridge began installing separated bike lanes on various streets
in the City through a process that has come to be known as “quick-build.” These projects
primarily involve restriping and painting the roadway, adding signage, and often installing
flexible vertical separators ("flex posts") to indicate where street space is dedicated to travel by
bicycle. These quick-build projects can be implemented rapidly and with far less expense than
full roadway reconstruction projects. Installing quick-build projects is one of many strategies the
City is pursuing to meet its commitment to Vision Zero and its Complete Streets Policy, and to
accelerate the buildout of the separated bicycle lane network.
Key findings
Interviews with 38 individuals representing a cross-section of the community revealed a wide
range of experiences and opinions on the engagement efforts for the quick-build projects. This
variation cannot be explained by assuming (as many interviewees did) that the stakeholders
who are pleased with the final outcomes of these projects will say positive things about the
engagement, while the people who are disappointed or upset about the outcomes will criticize
the process. The reality was much more nuanced. Most stakeholders, whether they felt
generally positive or generally negative about the project outcomes, offered both constructive
and critical feedback on the quick-build projects’ communication and participation
opportunities. Also, project proponents, opponents, and people who felt ambivalent about the
quick-build projects all provided suggestions for improvement going forward.
The more significant driver behind the stakeholders’ views was their own expectations for
engagement. These projects, in spite of being less complicated than full reconstruction projects,
are still considered by most stakeholders to be high-impact on the community, and therefore
deserving of a meaningful level of engagement. This was true for a range of interests, from
businesses and other institutions struggling with lost parking spots, to city staff who are
accustomed to working closely with stakeholders, to bicyclists who use the bike lanes, and City
Council members who field calls from constituents. The chief finding of this assessment is that
stakeholders in Cambridge, in general, have high expectations for engagement and that the
efforts to inform and involve the public on the City’s quick-build projects to date have mostly
fallen short of those expectations.
The assessment provides insight into the nature of those expectations. For example, the
community places a high value on consistent communication, transparency in public processes,
and clear connections between overarching goals and specific projects. Stakeholders want to be

heard and respected by the City and their neighbors. They expect their opinions to have some
influence over projects, or at a minimum to be told why they cannot when it is not appropriate.
In summary, the community appears to have many of the same expectations for engagement on
quick-build projects that they do for traditional, full-reconstruction projects.
Most people recognize that these projects have been a “learning process” (albeit a difficult one
for many). They noted ways the project delivery improved between the first quick-build projects
and those that came later, and they provided extensive suggestions for continued improvement,
which are captured in the report.
Another major concern for the community is the caustic spirit that has animated the public
dialogue around these projects. They are worried about the way these projects have “torn us
apart,” and are anxious to see future efforts address these dynamics in order to bring healing to
the community.
In addition to the feedback received on the community engagement aspects of these projects,
stakeholders encouraged the City to investigate the potential of a “hybrid” or “medium-build”
approach for separated bike lanes that would involve slightly more investment and capture a
few more co-benefits for other interests without losing the benefits of a quicker, less expensive
build option for bicycle infrastructure.
Recommendations
In response to the feedback, CBI made three recommendations. More details on these
recommendations are included in the final section of the assessment.
1) Support a small group of representative stakeholders and City staff in a collaborative effort
to design a standard, adaptable community engagement process for quick-build projects. The
Cambridge community, including staff, City officials, residents, businesses, and institutions, have
already learned a great deal about how to engage better on the quick-build projects, but
everyone would benefit from knowing what to expect, in terms of communication and
coordination, on projects going forward. To this end, we recommend the City and stakeholders
work together in this collaborative group to develop an engagement process that is specifically
designed for the unique characteristics of the quick-build projects.
2. Evaluate the potential for a “medium-build” or hybrid model. Many interviewees
hypothesize that there are ways to improve the quality and impact of the quick-build projects by
making moderate increases to the capital investment in the projects and by broadening the set
of interests the projects are trying to meet beyond bicycle travel. We recommend the City
explore these ideas in a transparent process and decide whether incremental changes along
these lines could, in fact, improve the projects without compromising their key benefits of lower
costs and speedy implementation.
3. Evaluate the quick-build projects’ impacts on small businesses. There are a lot of questions
about the impact these projects have on small businesses in Cambridge. We suggest the City
partner with some small businesses to undertake a joint fact finding process aimed at answering
those questions.

The purpose of this assessment was to gain understanding of the way Cambridge residents,
institutions, and small businesses perceive the effectiveness of the community engagement on
the City of Cambridge’s quick-build projects to date. The Consensus Building Institute (CBI), at
the request of the City, conducted this assessment to identify, in an impartial and independent
fashion, the range of experiences, interests, and concerns that exist in the community on this
issue, and to draw out community members’ suggestions for how to improve the engagement
on quick-build projects going forward.
The assessment process consisted of reviewing relevant background materials and conducting
38 confidential interviews with key stakeholders, including residents, business owners and
managers, leaders of civic organizations, elected and appointed officials, and City staff. All
interviews took place face-to-face or by telephone between September 2018 and January 2019.
A list of the stakeholders who were interviewed is provided in Appendix A.
Interviewees were asked to share their experiences with the engagement efforts on the quickbuild projects, including the ways in which they received information or were asked for their
feedback. They were also asked to share their ideas for improving the public process. This report
summarizes findings based on the views and opinions expressed by interviewees in these
conversations, and seeks to both capture their range of views and identify areas of commonality
and divergence. The report does not weigh or evaluate the frequency or popularity of views, nor
does it attempt to “fact-check” opinions. All views are presented without attribution to offer
confidentiality to those interviewed and to encourage readers to focus on the substantive
issues.
The assessment is presented in two parts – first the findings, an impartial summary of
stakeholder views as represented during the interviews, with some analysis and commentary by
the assessor, where appropriate. The final section includes CBI’s recommendations based on
what we heard in the interviews and our expertise in public engagement. This report is not a
legal document, technical report, or an exhaustive study of all the concerns of individuals and
organizations within the City of Cambridge. The report is limited by the information gathered in
the interviews, and CBI’s interpretation of that information. Any errors or omissions are the sole
responsibility of CBI.
The assessment was paid for by the City of Cambridge through Traffic, Parking + Transportation,
with the support of the Office of the City Manager and the City Council. This assessment was
managed, carried out, and written by Carri Hulet, Senior Mediator with CBI, a non-profit
organization based in Cambridge that helps communities and organizations collaborate to make
better decisions, achieve agreement, and manage multi-party conflicts and planning efforts. For
more information on CBI and Ms. Hulet, see cbi.org.
CBI wishes to thank all those who contributed to this report.

4.9.c

Note from the assessor: This section (Findings & Analysis, pages 7-19) includes the aggregate
feedback provided in the interviews, as true to the voice of the interviewees as possible without
betraying confidentiality. I have exercised professional judgment in compiling these findings and
have, in a few places, provided some context to increase clarity. I have also offered some analysis
of the feedback where it appeared beneficial. Because these findings represent the opinions and
lived experiences of those who were interviewed, they have not been “fact-checked.” The value
of these findings is not a function of the accuracy of the perspectives, but in understanding how
people think and feel about the quick-build projects and the processes that led to their
implementation. This understanding should provide the City and the community at large with
guidance on how to improve the community engagement on quick-build projects in the future.

Purpose and Goals of the Quick-Build Projects
One of the first questions community members ask, or want to answer regarding quick-build
projects is, “Why?” Why are these projects happening when and where they are, and why
through a quick-build approach rather than the traditional capital projects approach? Sharing
the answers to these questions, as expressed by the interviewees, is an important starting point
for this assessment because the stakeholders’ perspectives on the purpose and origins of these
projects had an impact on the way they viewed the projects in general.
The most common, and simplest answer given by the interviewees was, in the wake of two
bicyclist fatalities on Cambridge streets in 2016, the City pursued projects to improve safety for
bicyclists that could be done quickly and without significant cost. Many people referred to a
“mandate” from the City Council to improve bicycle safety (and quickly) as the driving force
behind the projects.
Some see the narrative above as accurate, but only one piece of the story. Another piece is that
the quick-build projects are one of many tools the City is using to carry out decades of policies 1
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to broaden access to the streets to various modes.
Some said Cambridge streets and the infrastructure in and around them were built primarily to
serve automobile-based transportation and are now undergoing a transition to accommodate
current and future ways people get around. One person made reference to the history of
transformations the thruways in Cambridge have gone through, from cow paths to wagon trails
to planned networks and paved streets. For some, the quick-build projects are simply expediting
the current transformation.

Some examples named by interviewees: Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance; Climate Protection Plan; pedestrian,
bicycle, and transit plans; Complete Streets policies; Vision Zero policies; City-wide long-range plans (Toward a
Sustainable Future, the City’s growth policy); long-range plan (pending); and various ordinances/documents on
ratcheting down parking on new developments and better transportation demand management (TDM).

FINDINGS & ANALYSIS

Packet Pg. 274

Another piece for many is that the quick-build projects are a response to political pressure
generated by the bicycle advocacy community. For those who feel it is high time to accelerate
the pace to improve the network of bike infrastructure, this is a good thing. Some interviewees
expressed a great deal of excitement about the quick-build projects. They say it is rewarding to
be in a community that has embraced such a progressive effort, and they appreciate the city
leaders’ willingness to hold their ground and continue the work, in spite of controversy. For
others who are worried about the trade-offs that come with new or updated bike lanes, the
political pressure is at least troubling, if not deeply upsetting. They said other interests
(primarily those of people in cars, but also pedestrians) are being overlooked in favor of “bikes
at all costs.” In any case, most people agree that the 2016 fatalities pushed bike infrastructure
to the top of the political agenda, and that the advocacy by the bicycle community has been a
powerful force behind the City’s increased focus on bicycle infrastructure.
Safety
Many said the bottom-line reason for doing the quick-build projects is to increase safety,
particularly for bicyclists. Almost all interviewees expressed support for that goal, in principle,
even if they disagreed with the quick-build approach as a way to accomplish it. Some who spoke
from their own experience using the new bike facilities said they do feel safer (albeit with some
minor complaints). Others pointed to data 2 the City has collected as evidence that the new lanes
have done their job with regard to safety.
On the other hand, some stakeholders take issue with the assertion that safety is the main goal
of these projects. They say the locations for these quick-build projects are not the least safe in
the city, so there must be other criteria at play. Several people pointed to Cambridge Street as
an example, as their understanding is that Cambridge Street had lower crash rates than some of
its sister streets. Another perception among a few of the interviewees is that the safety of
bicyclists is taking precedent over the safety of other modes, particularly pedestrians. One
example several people mentioned is the two-way bike lane on Brattle Street, where
pedestrians and cars expect traffic to come from just one direction, but that is no longer the
case. Others mentioned the need to assess and repair curb cuts and sidewalk ramps, “but no
one is advocating [as fiercely] for that,” so it does not rise to the top of the list. A separate issue
raised by some is their doubt about whether the separated bike lanes are actually safer for the
bicyclists. They say the “zig-zaggy” design on Cambridge Street, for example, is not safe because
the bicyclists do not have clear sightlines.
Some supporters of the projects (and even some critics) say that these projects have been
difficult learning experiences, but express hope that future projects will benefit from that
experience and knowledge. They hope that safety for bikes and safety for pedestrians will both
be top priorities, and that people, as they get used to the configurations, will make behavioral
changes, such as motorists checking for bikes when opening and closing car doors, and bicyclists
slowing down as they approach crosswalks.

Commitment to Bicycling
To provide context for their comments on the quick-build projects, many interviewees talked
about Cambridge’s attention to complete streets, greenhouse gas reductions, and multi-modal
transportation. Most interviewees said, either with pride or dismay, that Cambridge’s
commitment to creating and maintaining a strong and safe bicycle network is second to none in
the nation and one of the City’s highest priorities. For some, this serves as sufficient justification
for the quick-build projects. For others, it raises questions about whether the City’s commitment
to bicycles overshadows other priorities, such as supporting small businesses and ensuring
convenience for those who may need to get around in cars, including the elderly, disabled, and
people traveling with children.
The City’s bike plan 3 was raised repeatedly as a relevant reference point for the quick-build
projects. Some say the plan serves as an important piece of policy and that the community must
work faster and with fewer resources than those required for traditional projects or it will not
get done. Others say the bike plan is not even a “plan,” let alone policy. They characterize it as a
vision without sufficient analysis behind it to merit the weight it carries with the bike
community. They think the fact that people use the bike plan to support these projects is
evidence that the projects are not being done thoughtfully. Some expressed ambivalence about
the bike plan, saying it has merit, but it needs to be integrated with the other plans in the city so
the needs of others, such as pedestrians, are taken into account. 4
In the absence of a common narrative on the “why” behind the projects, many stakeholders,
both supportive and otherwise, wonder what criteria are used to choose quick-build projects,
and how and whether the public has vetted those criteria.

The Quick-Build Approach
To understand the feedback surrounding these projects, it is useful to note the various ways the
quick-build projects are perceived as being different from other projects and the implications of
those differences.
Pace
The speed of delivery and implementation is, as the name suggests, the defining feature of the
quick-build projects. Interviewees often said that doing things quickly means less time to
coordinate and communicate, less time to evaluate every eventuality, less time dealing with
construction, and less time for the public to anticipate the changes. These factors all mean
different things to different people.
Some individuals appreciate the benefits of the limited construction time required to install a
quick-build project. Unlike full road reconstruction projects, which are almost universally
criticized for being highly disruptive to abutters, the quick-build construction period is very short
and low impact. This, they say, offers a huge, overlooked plus.

Somewhat ironically, noted some individuals, the fact that the projects go in quickly is part of
the reason they become so controversial. When a roadway is under construction for a long time,
they said, it gives people plenty of time to get used to the idea of change. Often, by the time the
project concludes, everyone is so relieved it is over that there is wide appreciation for the
finished product. Quick-builds, on the other hand, can come as a shock – altering a familiar
space, sometimes significantly, from one day to the next. Even strong proponents of the quickbuild method say it is hard to prepare people for the change because no matter how well it is
understood in theory, the implications are hard to appreciate until the project becomes a
reality. Some people also said the suddenness presents a safety concern in itself, as motorists
are not prepared for the changes to their lanes or parking, bicyclists are not sure what to expect
from one block to the next, and pedestrians crossing the street suddenly find themselves in the
way of bicycle traffic where it did not exist the day before. Many people feel a lot of anxiety
about the possibility that, because the change happens with less warning, these projects
actually decrease safety at first.
Also, the Cambridge community is accustomed to long project development timeframes that
allow for multiple opportunities to engage, starting with visioning and continuing through
concept development and design. The fact that these projects move so quickly, reducing the
time for engagement, has been an uncomfortable and often frustrating transition for nearly
everyone, from residents to the City staff and City Council.
Some stakeholders, however, said the reduction in development time is positive. For those who
have grown impatient with the expense, time, and energy it takes to get projects completed, the
quick-build approach is a refreshing and welcome change. They tout the savings in time and
money and the immediacy of the benefits. Others feel the jobs are being rushed, leading to poor
design and missed opportunities.
Project Management
Another way the quick-build projects are different from full construction projects is the way
they are managed among City departments. Nearly all city projects that affect roads require
coordination among Community Development (CDD), the Department of Public Works (DPW)
and Traffic, Parking + Transportation (TP+P). Over time these departments have established
norms and standard expectations for their respective roles and responsibilities on full-build or
major reconstruction projects. The quick-build projects have shuffled some of those roles and
responsibilities, a dynamic that some interviewees believe has contributed to the challenges
described below in the community engagement section.
Beneficiaries, Trade-offs, and Quality
One perspective is that the biggest challenge with these projects is they do not offer a lot of
opportunities for trading benefits. A common perspective is that people traveling by bicycle
receive the advantages, while abutters and pedestrians experience the impacts. That is not the
impression for full reconstruction projects, where there are clear opportunities to improve
separated bike lanes while fixing drainage, improving sidewalks, repairing curbs and ramps, and
so on.

Also, some argue that the gains in time and money come at the cost of quality. “They get done
quick, but they ain’t pretty,” said one stakeholder. While not everyone agrees with this
perspective, many made similar comments about the difference in the finished product
between quick-build and traditional projects.
Communication/Engagement
The main objective of this assessment was to learn about what worked and did not work in
terms of community engagement on the quick-build projects to date so the City can improve its
engagement on future quick-build projects.
Before reviewing the feedback that spoke directly to the question of community engagement, it
may be helpful to think about engagement as seeking to accomplish two goals – information
and influence. Information refers simply to what there is to know about the project and, for
purposes of this framework, should be assumed to travel in one direction – from the project
team to the community. The questions to answer are: Was the information available and easy to
access? Were stakeholders made aware the information exists? Is it understandable to the
average person?
Influence refers to the opportunity to be heard and the extent to which stakeholders trust that
their feedback will be considered, at least, or make a difference where appropriate. Influence
refers to a two-way exchange between the project team and the public. The questions to
answer are: Were members of the community given a chance to express their views? Were
those perspectives heard and appreciated? Were appropriate changes made to the projects
because of the feedback, and, when not, was it communicated why?
The following paragraphs present the feedback provided on both information and influence, at
times distinguishing between the distinct projects when there were differences worth noting.
Information
In terms of information, stakeholders uniformly reported knowing nothing or very little about
the Massachusetts Avenue project near Harvard Law School and the Harvard-Epworth United
Methodist Church before the new facilities were installed. One view, expressed by more than
one person, was that the project went in “under the cover of night,” suggesting not only a lack
of information, but also an intentional effort to keep the public disengaged. On Brattle Street, a
few people said they knew the City had been considering bike lanes on Brattle Street for a long
time, but again, nearly all interviewees reported feeling “shocked” when the lanes were
installed because they did not know the timing, and because the final product was so different
and so much more impactful than what they had expected. On the other hand, stakeholders’
experiences with information on Cambridge Street were varied, with several people saying the
information was readily available and “anyone who wanted to know what was going on could
have known.” Others said the information on Cambridge Street was there, but often incomplete
or inconsistent from one meeting or announcement to the next. A minority, but fervent view
was that the information about the Cambridge Street project was intentionally inaccurate and
misleading.

On the Cambridge Street project, interviewees cited several methods of communication they
received, including flyers on doorknobs; the City website, social media accounts, email blasts
and newsletters; and messages from their own advocacy or neighborhood group. Several people
also said the stakeholder group the City convened, which was originally composed of individuals
representing a range of perspectives in the city, was an indication of a strong effort to engage
the community. City staff described at length the various efforts they had made to reach out to
the public, which echo those referenced by the stakeholders.
Notwithstanding the generally positive feedback many reported regarding the information that
was available on the Cambridge Street project, there were some interviewees who said they
received little or no information on it.
When asked about the quality of the information the received on any of the projects, most
community members had very little to say. A few people said the information was good or
sufficient. A couple of people said the information was misleading or incomplete.
Influence
With regard to influence, there was less variation among the projects. Nearly everyone, whether
supportive of the projects or not, and regardless of which quick-build project (or projects) they
were most familiar with, characterized the degree of public influence on the projects as minimal
or non-existent. Even the people who participated directly in the Cambridge stakeholder group
felt their impact on the project was limited. They said they felt like their input was being asked
for infrequently and often disingenuously, as it appeared from the beginning that the projects
were “fully baked.” For some stakeholders, less public influence on the quick-build projects is
not a negative because they are comfortable with the trade-off for faster implementation, but
most people expressed disappointment or anger about having less influence than they expect
on public projects. From City Council members to staff to residents and advocates, it appears
that most people think the City should seek feedback from the community and make
adjustments to the projects, based on that feedback, where appropriate. It is important to note
here that the staff working on the projects indicate that feedback from the public and key
stakeholders did, in fact, alter the Brattle Street, Cambridge Street, and South Massachusetts
Avenue projects, and that they have documented these changes and shared them in public
meetings. These differences of views indicate an important mismatch in expectations and/or
communications.
Some people complained that advocates on all sides who were better organized than others
“worked the politics” by going straight to the City Council rather than participating in good faith
in the standard public processes. These claims were made about both the bike advocacy
community and the abutters.
The most common and passionate complaints about community engagement boil down to the
perception that a small number of voices were heard over many others. Almost every
interviewee said the public dialogue on these projects has been dominated by just a few voices,
both pro and con, and that the tone of those voices has been incredibly adversarial, a dynamic
that many people think is bad for the project and unhealthy for the community.

Public and Stakeholder Meetings
It appears from the feedback that some coordination on these projects between the City and
members of the community took place in one-on-one or small-group conversations. Most of the
coordination and communication, however, particularly with the Cambridge Street project,
happened through large public meetings or with the Cambridge Stakeholder Working Group.
Interviewees provided substantial feedback on the quality of these interactions.
Some interviewees expressed satisfaction with the public meetings on the Cambridge Street
project. They said the meetings were well advertised and well attended and that the City
provided all the necessary information. One person said, in fact, that “the City has been victim
to its own success,” because the meetings were so crowded there was limited opportunity to
provide feedback.
Others felt the meetings were not adequate. They assumed many of the people at the meetings
were bike commuters from other towns and were upset that the meetings provided too much
opportunity for influence from non-Cambridge participants. An alternate view on this point was
that there was no way to know who attended the meetings and that, even if street users from
outside of Cambridge were there, they had a valid point of view as contributors to the local
economy and users of the regional transportation network.
Some interviewees said the large meetings were not structured in such a way to facilitate a safe
space for all perspectives to be heard and valued. There were complaints about disrespectful
behavior (from members of the public) being tolerated; highly technical responses to questions
that, while well meaning, did not result in greater understanding or greater trust in the project;
and inconsistent messaging. Also, several people complained of insufficient information
between meetings.
Another criticism was that the stakeholder working group on the Cambridge Street project did
not incentivize people to participate consistently throughout the duration of the process so, by
the end, “only the naysayers showed up.” On a related note, several interviewees said people in
Cambridge have “engagement fatigue,” and cannot handle more meetings. They said, “We need
an engagement process that doesn’t feel like a second job.”
The public process for Cambridge Street may also have suffered from stakeholders trying to
keep too many distinct projects straight in their heads. During the interviews there were times
when it suddenly became clear the person was providing feedback on the Inman Square
reconstruction, not the Cambridge Street quick-build project, or that their issues with Envision
Cambridge or the First Street Garage were impacting their views on the quick-builds.
Even people on the Cambridge Street stakeholder committee said they did not feel sufficiently
informed and rarely felt consulted. This was a shame, one person said, because “they had a
bunch of good people in there, but then did not use their knowledge or skills.” Nearly every
interviewee who commented on these stakeholder meetings said the City staff were always
extremely professional and prepared for the meetings, which they appreciated. Still, a common
sentiment was that, in the future, the person interfacing with the public should be skilled at

communication and running meetings, not necessarily the person who is most knowledgeable
about the projects. 5
Engagement with Key Partners
In addition to the public meetings, much of the communication about the projects appears to
have happened directly with key partners, such as the universities, hospitals, and business and
neighborhood associations. The key finding from interviews with these partners is that the
quick-build projects have put a significant strain on those relationships, even those that have
been (and remain) very strong.
Key partners were generous with their praise of the City staff outside of the quick-build projects.
Several people said the staff (TP+T, DPW, and CDD) understand complexity, tend to think longterm, and are attentive to details. They said they appreciate that when disagreements have
come up in the past, there has always been mutual respect and a strong track record of finding a
mutually agreeable solution. In general, they said the City staff is good at communicating clearly
and promptly.
Given these expectations, these long-standing partners were disappointed by the more limited
engagement that happened, for the most part, on the quick-build projects. The impact on the
relationships has been significant, in some cases, even if the public protest from key partners
has been circumscribed. These partners are worried about future quick-build projects and how
and whether their strong working relationships will be further affected. Some said they are
concerned about the absence of a coordinated plan between themselves and the City to
evaluate the impact of these projects over time.
Messaging
Nearly everyone referred to these projects at some point as a “learning process,” and nowhere
is that more apparent than in the messaging. These projects have been called many things –
from “pilot” to “demonstration” to “pop-ups” to “quick-builds.” Each of these labels appears to
have contributed to the public frustration, as they are words that mean different things to
different people. As many people said, the terms “pilot” and “demonstration” imply a trial
period, not a commitment. The words themselves led people to believe the projects were
supposed to be temporary. When it became clear that the City did not intend them to be
temporary, people felt misled. Also, the project staff said all of these terms suggest a kind of
“slap-dash” effort to get the projects designed, which they adamantly insist is not the case. They
said the only reason they can be built fast is that a lot of work goes into the design and other
preparations.
Some people said the verbal messaging in meetings sometimes adjusted to the level of hostility
in the room – if everyone was “behaving themselves,” the City would communicate greater
firmness on its decisions; however, if a dominant voice was oppositional and aggressive, the City
might appear to backpedal and suggest more room for adjustment than really existed.
Finally, some stakeholders noted some missed opportunities in the messaging to date. One
person said “radical honesty” would have helped, capturing what several people tried to express

in other ways. Tell us, some said, as if talking directly to city staff, that you’re struggling with this
too because it’s new and different, and let us help figure it out. And don’t tell us something we
want to hear if it isn’t true (e.g. “don’t say you’re going to relocate twenty parking spots if what
you mean is eliminate.”). Another missed opportunity may have been to explain how quick-build
projects meet a need that the City’s capital planning process cannot address – a way to make
roadway improvements now that no one anticipated needing years ago when the timing would
have been right to enter them into the plan.
Very few people see these errors as nefarious; in fact, even some of the most dissatisfied
stakeholders said they think the City staff is doing their best with the mandate they have been
given, but the fact remains that poor messaging has contributed to these projects’ challenges.
Personal Attacks and Demonization
An important finding from the interviews is that people across the full spectrum of opinions on
the quick-build projects talked about how “ugly” or “mean” the controversy has become. Nearly
every interviewee shared a story about an individual or group being mistreated, intimidated,
called names, or even physically assaulted for their views on bicycle infrastructure, parking, or
cars.
A lot of people talked about “bikelash,” a term that has emerged to describe intense anger
toward people who ride bicycles, including being yelled or honked at without provocation;
physically pushed while biking; or having their property vandalized. At a community meeting in
Cambridge it was reportedly said that the problem with these projects is they are being done for
bikers – a “group of people everyone hates.”
On the other hand, people who think it is important to accommodate driving and parking shared
stories of being booed by bike advocates for sharing their opinion in public meetings, or being
stereotyped as “anti-bike” or “anti-climate.” One person said, “apparently these projects are
about safety so no one can have an opinion.”
Almost everyone who shared concerns about the bike lanes in these confidential interviews felt
compelled to start their remarks with, “I am not anti-bike…,” or “I am a biker myself so this is
not about hating bicyclists.” This indicates an environment in which people feel their views on a
discrete issue may be interpreted as bellwethers of a broader characterization with which they
do not identify. Words and phrases such as “bigoted,” “demonized,” “us versus them,”
“villainized,” and “intimidated,” were used frequently in the interviews as people described the
dynamic surrounding the public and private discourse on this issue. Some said they hope the
City can do something to improve the way the community talks and deals with these projects so
they are not “pitting community members against each other” in such vitriolic ways.
Going Forward
This section summarizes the suggestions shared by interviewees about how interactions with
key stakeholders and the public can improve going forward.
Direct coordination with representative stakeholders

4.9.c

15
Packet Pg. 282

The most common suggestions for improvement boil down to knowing the key stakeholders –
identifying and reaching out to people who can adequately represent the full spectrum of
perspectives in the community – and then working with them as partners, consistently and
predictably. Interviewees suggested coordinating better with the economic development staff in
the city; emergency services; the business and neighborhood associations, and the universities,
hospitals, and churches. One person said the City should anticipate who might care about the
project after it is built and make sure they get involved in advance. Interviewees were anxious to
name the multiple benefits of careful stakeholder engagement, including learning what the
stakeholders know (then improving the project based on that knowledge), building support and
buy-in from community representatives, and widening the net for communication by reaching
through them to their supporters. Some also said that involving key stakeholders demonstrates
simply that you care about the community and that you are not insensitive to the impacts that
are inherent in these projects.
Communicate the “Why” Behind Each Project Much Better
Interviewees said it would be very helpful to connect the dots between these projects and a
broader strategy. One person described this request as “an overall plan with a logic anyone can
follow, even if they disagree.” They said the public should know which projects are coming up
next and why. Interviewees who are supportive of the projects in principle, but upset by the way
they have been implemented said it would make a significant difference to them if they could
understand and appreciate the various criteria that drive the selection of each project.
Pay Special Attention to the Issues that Arise on Every Project
There are some concerns that seem to surface predictably on every quick-build project,
regardless of size, scope, or location. Interviewees suggested implementing systemic changes to
address these recurring problems directly and proactively. These include:
• Pedestrian safety. Given that so many people’s perception is that these projects
decrease pedestrian safety, some recommendations from the interviews included
planning for that perception and mitigating it with either physical changes to the design
that demonstrate a concern for pedestrian safety (e.g. pedestrian islands in the middle
of the road were mentioned many times), or at a minimum more proactive and
respectful communication with those who represent pedestrians so they know
pedestrian safety is not being overlooked and that efforts are being made to address it.
• Business operations, particularly loading and unloading. Stakeholders representing
business and institutional interests want desperately to see that the City understands
(and cares!) that they cannot survive if their ability to move product in and out of their
location is overly hindered. They said the best way to understand their needs would be
to physically observe their loading and unloading process so the project staff can see the
size of the trucks and understand how they need to maneuver.
• Illegal parking (Uber and Lyft). Interviewees said everyone needs to accept the reality
that ride-sharing services are now ubiquitous and that they will park anywhere they can
at any time, either to pick up and drop off passengers, or to sit and wait for their next
customer. Several people said the City needs to provide “taxi stands” or a similar
solution for a problem that can no longer be ignored, particularly if they are going to
continue building bike lanes and reducing parking.

Equity: A few people said the quick-build projects might be particularly susceptible to
influence from the most privileged voices, as people with privilege are the most able to
mobilize quickly and repeatedly. The suggestion is to design the engagement with a
primary goal of enabling the participation of the least privileged voices. This, they
suggest, will make it more likely that everyone has a chance to be heard.
Design for the fire truck: A surprising number of people said if the project designers
work to ensure that a fire truck can navigate the corridors safely then it should be
adequate for everyone else. 6 It was also suggested that early coordination with
emergency services has secondary benefits, given that many people ask emergency
services staff whether or not the quick-build project staff coordinates with them. It was
suggested that “it would build a lot of good will” for the project if they could say, “Yes.
Always.”
Maintenance: Stakeholders said the Cambridge community has high expectations of the
City when it comes to maintaining infrastructure, including snow removal. They said the
maintenance plan should be emphasized in communications with the public to
demonstrate sensitivity to this issue.
Do a better job promoting the benefits of quick-build projects: Some stakeholders
bemoan the fact that quick-builds’ key benefit – the bang for the buck aspect of building
a high-benefit project fast and cheap – has been lost or simply underappreciated. They
said the project teams’ communications efforts should adjust to remind the public of
the quick-build approach’s inherent benefits by juxtaposing them with the most painful
aspects of a traditional full-build.
Emphasize the careful attention that goes into the design: On a note related to the
bullet above, stakeholders with intimate knowledge of the design process on these
projects said the City could do a better job showing people that the “background work”
to prepare for a quick-build is quite thorough, even if the project itself can be
implemented quickly.

Study the Impacts on Businesses
A big question on the minds of many stakeholders involves whether the quick-build projects
have hurt or helped the businesses. Almost everyone has an opinion on this, but as one person
said, “We have no data so we can’t know whether the impacts people worry about have
materialized or not.” Given this, several stakeholders suggested that the City undertake an
effort to answer this important question.
Adjust Some Internal Processes
Cambridge is not a large city, said some stakeholders, but these projects have enough moving
pieces and cross enough departmental lines to merit increased internal coordination. One
specific suggestion was to engage the City’s planners more extensively in the design phase so
the projects are informed by the training a planner has (versus an engineer). Another suggestion
was to share the preliminary designs with the City Council so they can be better informed at an
early stage, and to minimize the potential for surprises when they are constructed.

Cambridge officials, after reviewing this report, requested the addition of this note: “We wish to reassure the public
that all quick-build projects are designed to accommodate all public safety vehicles, based on consultations with
emergency services personnel.”

Consider a Hybrid Build Model
This assessment focused on community engagement and communications and was not designed
to be a referendum on quick-build projects. Interviewees were not generally asked, unless they
introduced the topic themselves, about the quality of the bike facilities or whether the City
should continue building them, Still, in addition to the extensive feedback on the question at
hand, several stakeholders independently suggested the City evaluate the potential of a
“hybrid” approach – a kind of “quicker build” that could still be completed faster and with less
expense than a full-build project, but would involve slightly more investment. These suggestions
are synthesized here.
Stakeholders in favor of this idea recognize the need for quick, inexpensive projects that
significantly improve multi-modal transportation. They say it is hard to argue with the value of a
$200,000 project that provides a separated bike lane when the alternative is waiting for a $10
million full street reconstruction. Still, a few people said the projects look sloppy and wonder if a
few more dollars would at least improve the appearance of the final product. Some said
something seemingly simple, like removing curb bumpouts so the bike lane can proceed along a
straighter path, would be worth the extra investment. Also, interviewees wondered whether a
small increase in investment would make it possible to offer some of the trade-off benefits the
business and pedestrian communities are seeking. Some potential benefit areas they mentioned
include drainage, ramp connections and other sidewalk improvements, increasing or improving
tree canopy, and utilities. Others said the extra investment could be spent solely on better
public engagement.
One caution interviewees raised was not knowing when to stop. They said, once you start
adding benefits to these projects, how do you decide what goes in and what stays out? An effort
to enhance a quick-build project using an additional $50,000 worth of improvements can easily
become a $500,000 effort as the project becomes more complex and needs to address issues
such as utilities and resiliency.

The following recommendations are grounded in CBI’s assessment of the feedback from the
interviews, combined with our extensive experience designing and leading collaborative public
processes.

1. Support a small group of representative stakeholders and City staff in a
collaborative effort to design a standard, adaptable community engagement process
for quick-build projects.

It is clear from the interviews that there is a demand for “better,” not more engagement on
quick-build projects. It is also apparent that if the City can commit to follow a standard, but
customizable engagement process for quick-build projects, the community will know what to
expect and it should reduce frustration and lead to more productive public input. In order to
determine what would constitute better, more consistent engagement, we suggest convening a
group of individuals who would be perceived by the community as legitimate voices for the
types of people who are affected by these projects (e.g. bicyclists, motorists, pedestrians,
business interests, emergency services, other public services) and include people who can
represent unique needs among these stakeholders (e.g. disabled, elderly, small businesses,
institutions) to design the engagement template. We suggest a process that roughly follows
these steps:
• Refine the scope of the work and confirm support from the City. This includes clarifying
the group’s mandate and determining who, from the City, will support and participate in
the group.
• Establish the stakeholder group. The purpose and scope of the group’s task should be
made known to key stakeholders in the community, along with a call to nominate
representatives who might participate. A simple review process should be established
and a set of expectations for participation should be included with the call, as well as
clarity on their role vis-à-vis the interests they are expected to represent.
• Once convened, the group should start by reviewing the feedback provided in this
assessment and helpful information about the projects. A practical starting point for the
process will be the input that has already been provided by interviewees. These
suggestions, paired with technical information from the City (and possibly other
stakeholders) about the project impacts and benefits, will form an important foundation
for the group’s collaborative decision making.
• As the community engagement process develops, update other interested stakeholders
on progress and provide opportunities for broader public input. The design process need
not be exhaustive, but it should be done carefully and transparently. We would expect
the group to meet multiple times over the course of 3-6 months. And, as the group
designs a simple, adaptable, predictable community engagement process for quick-build
projects, they should communicate their progress and reach out at least twice for public
input.
• Engage the City Manager’s office early and often. The group should plan ahead for the
City Manager’s role in reviewing their recommendations by keeping him informed along
the way. This will make it more likely that the review process goes as quickly and
smoothly as possible.

RECOMMENDATIONS

19
Packet Pg. 286

2. Evaluate the potential for a “medium-build” or hybrid model.

The stakeholders expressed significant interest in a “hybrid approach” or the possibility that
moderate increases in capital investment in quick-build projects might make them more
attractive, potentially safer, and more accommodating of interests beyond those of bicyclists.
We recommend that City staff and officials undertake a serious effort to consider these ideas.
We do not think a full-scale public process is necessary for this exploration, but we do
recommend that the public be made aware that the City is investigating these ideas and be
offered a simple way to share their specific suggestions for the exploration to consider. Also, if
both the first recommendation and this second recommendation are accepted, we believe there
are efficiencies and benefits to running these processes in parallel, with significant
communication between the stakeholder group working on the first recommendation, and the
internal City team working on this second recommendation.

3. Evaluate the quick-build projects’ impacts on small businesses.

The process suggested in the first recommendation should help address potential impacts on
small businesses going forward, but given the high level of concern and the lack of detailed
information about local impacts beyond what any individual organization might provide,
disagreement on the nature and degree of impacts abounds. We recommend a “joint fact
finding” process, undertaken in partnership with small businesses and the City, to attempt to
qualify and quantify these impacts. We wish to recognize that this investigation would be a
sensitive matter, as it would require businesses to share private information about their internal
operations and accounting with the researchers, but we believe some businesses would be
willing to participate if they were full partners in designing and participating in the research
approach and could be confident that their privacy would be protected.

City of San Diego says controversial bike lanes will be repainted after CBS 8 digs into the issue

Dear City Council and City Manager,
Another community is learning how important community engagement is before significant changes to
streets are implemented. The Council should learn a lesson from San Diego's experience and stop
the implementation of lanes until the Advisory group is meeting and the economic analysis is
completed. Then we can have true stakeholder engagement with hard facts and figures.
It is unfortunate the council cares more about hitting deadlines rather than listening to the growing
number of residents and small businesses being negatively impacted by the CSO. Yes change is
necessary but the Council is setting a poor example of how to manage change as it isolates itself
from the voters and small business owners that just want to be heard and have input into the process.
Cambridge deserves better from its elected officials.

Cambridge HEART

Dear City Councilors,
My name is Jeanne Koopman. I have lived at 248 River Street for 30 years.
Having followed the development of the HEART program for the past year, I am highly impressed with the importance of
its mission for our neighborhoods and the care and deep commitment evident in its collaborative development. HEART
is a program based in the real needs and voices of members of our community who rarely participate in development of
our public services.
The City of Cambridge spends $630 per resident per year on the Police Department. By contrast, Cambridge HEART is
requesting an amount that is $23 per resident per year. HEART is the kind of community-based alternative public safety
program that can supplement and in a few instances replace police based services in a way that all Cantabrigians,
including our police department, will welcome.
Please consider the HEART proposal for ARPA funding, linked here.
Thank you,
Jeanne Koopman

CMA 2022 #74 & 75

Dear City Clerk,
As a small business in Cambridge, we do NOT SUPPORT a plan that will remove 50 - 60% of parking from Mass
Ave. We do NOT SUPPORT removing all metered parking from Porter Square. A design needs to be found that
allows for safe streets that also supports our residents, businesses, elderly and disabled.
If the requirements and deadlines of the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a design that meets these
goals, the ordinance needs to be changed. Also, the timeline for changes to Mass Ave should include an
automatic deadline extension so no construction starts until after the MBTA wires are removed.
The unintended consequences to residents and small businesses need to be considered. Bike lanes are a good
idea but should not come at a cost to the entire community for the benefit of a few. Please conduct and get
the results from the economic analysis survey related to impacts on businesses related to bike lane
implementation. It is imperative that these results be discovered and discussed PRIOR TO further design and
timeline commitments.
Our dental office is located adjacent to the already completed North Mass Ave QuickBuild (Alewife to
Dudley). Increasingly, patients call our Front Desk from their car. They ask where they can park and
eventually arrive frustrated and late to the appointment. Currently the situation varies day to day – but there
has been a noticeable uptick in concern from patients. A further reduction in metered Mass Ave parking will
have negative repercussions on our business.
Please take the necessary time needed to complete the bike lane project successfully so it is an upgrade to our
community, not a failure of putting the interests of some in front of many residents, medical/dental providers,
restaurants, small shops, seniors and the disabled.
This is not a case of “you need to break a few eggs to make an omelet”. This is a case of a don’t set the house
on fire while making an omelet.
Please vote to prioritize the economic impact survey and then make plans for construction and
implementation of the bike lanes.
Sincerely,
Betsy Whittemore
Practice Manager

WHEREAS:

Jane Smiley Hirschi was recently awarded the Elizabeth Abernathy Hull award from

WHEREAS:

Because of Jane’s dedication to the program, CitySprouts has become a staple in many

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge shares a critical concern for survivors and victims of sexual
violence and a desire to support their needs for justice and healing; and

WHEREAS:

In the most recent annual crime report (2020), the Cambridge Police Department
received a total of 27 reports of rape, and the members of the Sexual Assault Response
Team served the needs of victims through crisis interventions, counseling sessions,
forensic exams, law enforcement interviews, or other proceedings; and

WHEREAS:

Current estimates suggest as few as 1 in 5 sexual assaults will be reported to law
enforcement and less than 3 percent will result in the conviction and incarceration of
the perpetrator; and

WHEREAS:

Research documents show that survivors are far more likely to disclose their sexual
assault to a friend or family member, and when these loved ones respond with doubt,
shame, or blame, victims suffer additional negative effects on their physical and
psychological well-being; and

WHEREAS:

The Start by Believing public awareness campaign (a program of End Violence
Against Women International) is designed to improve the responses of friends, family
members, and community professionals, so they can help survivors access supportive
resources and engage the criminal justice system; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record declaring Cambridge a Start by Believing
community and supporting Cambridge’s Start by Believing pledge, which will take
place on Wednesday, April 13, 2022 on City Hall Lawn.

WHEREAS:

Picking up after your pet can have a profound effect on the environment; and

WHEREAS:

Pet waste that is not picked up can runoff into drinking water supply, carrying harmful
diseases with it, among other negative impacts; and

WHEREAS:

In Cambridge, it is illegal to leave pet waste on both public and private property for
these reasons; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge provides free pet waste bags at City parks and dog parks to
encourage owners to properly dispose of their pet waste, but these bags are not at any
other known locations around the City; and

WHEREAS:

Increasing the number of sites that carry free pet waste bags would help owners
conveniently and properly pick up after their pets, no matter where they are in the City;
now therefore be it

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the Department of
Public Works and the Animal Commission to look into placing free pet waste bags at

WHEREAS:

Idling of vehicles is known to be harmful to public health and contributes to the
climate crisis; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts Anti-Idling Law is in place to reduce air pollution by limiting
unnecessary idling of vehicles to five minutes; and

WHEREAS:

There are three exemptions to this law: when an engine is being repaired and operating
the engine is necessary for the repair; when a vehicle is making deliveries and
associated power is necessary; and when the engine is used to provide power to
another device; and

WHEREAS:

Around Cambridge, on any given day there are many idling vehicles, and residents
have written to the City Council asking that the Anti-Idling Law be better enforced;
and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has discussed the issue of enforcement in the past, yet it is a problem
and residents and others have noted that idling happens regularly, with a negative
impact on air quality; and

WHEREAS:

New York City has recently developed a citizen-outsourcing program, which invites
citizens to report trucks that are idling for more than three minutes, and pays the citizen
25% of the fine collected for a video of the idling vehicle; and

WHEREAS:

This program has been successful; complaints against trucks increased from only a few
to over 12,000 last year, incentivizing drivers to turn their car off instead of idling;
now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with relative City
departments, including the Community Development Department and the Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department to consider the feasibility of implementing a
similar program and any other ways to enforce the anti-idling law; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council by
no later than June 1, 2022, whereupon the matter will be referred to the appropriate

WHEREAS:

The COVID-19 pandemic had an outsized impact on families in poverty, both in

Cambridge RISE (Recurring Income for Success and Empowerment), one of the first
guaranteed income pilots in the country, has already shown success in addressing the
immediate financial and health needs of participants, while also providing
opportunities for economic stability, the first step towards long-term economic
empowerment and growth; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge RISE pilot included 130 single-caretaker households, but there is a
widespread need in Cambridge for all families in poverty to receive assistance; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge has a high cost of living, and research indicates that our lowest income
households, households of color, and immigrant families are concentrated in the
bottom two income quintiles, with households below 200% of the federal poverty
level, which is not enough to cover rent and basic expenses; and

WHEREAS:

These are the families most affected by COVID – having borne the brunt of service job
losses; high food and utility costs as kids were home due to school closures; the
inability to work from home due to childcare reasons, as well as the lack of technology
skills and access; and

WHEREAS:

On June 28, 2021, the City Council approved an initial appropriation of $65,019,211,
received from the U.S. Department of Treasury through the new Coronavirus Local
Fiscal Recovery Fund established by the American Rescue Plan Act, to the Grant Fund
Finance Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account; and

WHEREAS:

These funds can be used to address the economic impacts of the public health
emergency, including efforts to mitigate economic harm to workers, households, small
businesses, affected industries, and the public sector; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge has a unique opportunity to further address family poverty in Cambridge by
providing direct cash assistance building on the work done with Cambridge RISE; and

WHEREAS:

A February 2022 Policy Order proposed ending the practice of requiring City Council
approval of all curb cuts; and

WHEREAS:

As the City Council considers amending the curb cut approval process, it would be

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that the Fair Share Amendment will be
on the November 2022 statewide ballot; and

WHEREAS:

The Fair Share Amendment would amend the Massachusetts Constitution to create an
additional tax of four percentage points on annual income above one million dollars
and dedicate the funds raised by this tax to quality public education, affordable public
colleges and universities, and for the repair and maintenance of roads, bridges, and
public transportation; and

WHEREAS:

Major investments in public transportation are needed to improve the safety, reliability,
affordability, accessibility, and expansiveness of the network, and to shift many more
people from driving to public transit, thereby reducing greenhouse gas and other
harmful emissions; and

WHEREAS:

Major investments in public education are needed to help students recover
academically, socially, and emotionally from the COVID-19 pandemic; and

WHEREAS:

Massachusetts needed new investments in our transportation and public education
systems even before the COVID-19 pandemic, and now those investments are needed
more than ever to lift our economy into an equitable and long-lasting recovery; and

WHEREAS:

The Fair Share Amendment would only impact the state’s highest income earning
residents, who have seen their collective net worth skyrocket in recent years; now
therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the Cambridge City Council go on record in support of the proposed Fair Share
Amendment and in urging the voters of Cambridge to support it at the ballot box in

Communicating Information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, April 5th, 2022 the School Committee held a regular meeting and voted on the FY23
budget. The budget is a testament to the hard work the administration and the Committee have done by
listening to our students, staff, and families. The key investments in this budget will prioritize academic
success, career and college readiness, youth leadership, professional development, and provide an equity
audit to understand our equity practices. In the FY23 budget we are able to provide an additional social
worker at CRLS, allocate funding for the Early College program, create a position to mitigate the spread
of COVID-19, and address several academic priorities through advancements in RSTA and summer
learning. These changes will foster a better school district as we work toward creating a strategic plan.
During the meeting, Superintendent Greer, Dr. Lyndsay Brown, Dr. Nicole Gittens, Executive Director of
RSTA Michael Ananis, and Principal Smith provided a presentation on the RSTA program and ways to
integrate work-based learning throughout the K-12 schools and integrate RSTA with CRLS.
Unfortunately, RSTA has been delayed since last year. The presentation provided the next steps, which
includes gathering data through student surveys and focus groups in order to understand internship
participation, credential attainment, and postsecondary outcomes. Data will also be collected from
stakeholders including families, RSTA graduates, RSTA staff, City officials, and current internship and
co-op partners. After the data is collected, there will be a DESE CTE review, a synthesis of the findings,
and a design for future structure.
The School Committee also voted on a motion to make M7 Charlie cards free for students who qualify for
free/reduced lunch. Additionally, the School committee voted on a motion to create e-transcript services
for CRLS alumni.

Today, I attended the 8th grade ELA Symposium at Putnam Avenue Upper School. The incredible 8th
graders are learning to create arguments, supporting those arguments with logic and evidence, and
defending them against anticipated counterarguments. At the symposium, the students’ presented their
arguments to School Committee members and me, explaining the need for Critical Race Theory, creating
a national holiday to honor Malcolm X on May 19th, and getting a Martin Luther King Jr. quote written
on a mural. I also visited Tobin Montessori School with Vice Mayor Mallon and learned from our
students about the many ideas they have for Cambridge.
This past weekend, I had an engaging time at the National School Boards Conference in San Diego. My
colleagues from the School Committee, including our student school committee members, and I heard
from School Boards around the country about ways to further support our students. We visited schools
and learned new ideas to implement in our district. I am excited to share what we learned with the district
as we begin to create our strategic plan for next year.
Ms. Rasheeda Abdul-Musawwir will be joining the Cambridge Public Schools as the new Dynamic
Diversity Recruiter effective Monday, March 28th. Ms. Abdul Musawwir will be leading the district’s
talent strategies to attract exceptional candidates while diversifying our workforce. Ms. Abdul-Musawwir
is currently a Recruitment and Retention Specialist in Chelsea Public Schools, where she manages
internal pipeline programs, such as Paraprofessional to Teacher and Parent to Paraprofessional, offers
support to school based administration for their hiring needs and oversees all of the district’s recruitment
events.
Ramadan Mubarak! Ramadan is a time when Muslims fast, abstaining from food and water from sunrise
to sunset during the Holy month of Ramadan. I hope to share a meal with many of you at our community
Iftar on Wednesday, April 13th at the Cambridge Street Upper School located at 850 Cambridge Street. It
will be a wonderful opportunity for an interfaith event and hear from Muslim students and residents.
The Eid al-Fitr holiday will now move from May 3rd to May 2nd based on the District Calendar after
information shared by a community member was brought to our attention.
April is also School Library Month, a time to celebrate the essential role that school librarians and strong
school library programs, including our wonderful Cambridge Public Schools Library Team, play in
transforming learning. Visit American Association of School Librarians to learn more about School
Library Month.
Thirty-eight students from Putnam Avenue and Vassal Lane Upper Schools became Peer Mediators.
Students took an Oath of Confidentiality with the Cambridge Police Department and will now assist in
peer mediation at their schools.
The next regular School Committee meeting is on Tuesday, April 12th. Please do not hesitate to reach out
with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.
Respectfully,

Mayor Siddiqui
