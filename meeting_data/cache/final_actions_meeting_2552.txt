GREEN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS

22.21

Statement of Purpose. This Section 22.20 is adopted to ensure that major new projects and
substantially rehabilitated buildings in the City of Cambridge are planned, designed and
constructed in a sustainable way so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts as they are
initially constructed and as they are occupied and operated over the course of their useful lives. It
is the purpose of this Section 22.20 to encourage the reuse of existing buildings and materials; to
encourage the conservation of natural resources and reduction of toxins in new construction and
substantial rehabilitation of existing buildings through selection of recycled and otherwise
environmentally appropriate building materials and methods; to ensure a reduction in the use of
energy in both the initial construction of the project and in its daily operation; and to encourage an
arrangement of buildings and mix of uses, on individual lots and within the city as a whole, that
will foster renewable energy generation and pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit use in the
city. While the provisions of this section apply to projects of 25,000 square feet or larger,
developments of all sizes are encouraged to incorporate sustainable design principles.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 22.00, the requirements of all local, state and/or
federal regulations applicable to a project must be met, particularly the State Building Code,
including its energy components.

3. Amend “Applicability” section as follows:

Green Building Ordinance Proposal (2019-11-12 Ordinance Committee meeting)
Screen Shot 2019-11-12 at 6.48.09 AM.png

Members of the Council, Mr. Clerk,
I wish to comment on the "proposed amendment to Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance – Green Building Requirements".
This proposed amendment is clearly well-intended, but I am wary of a proposal that is so relatively timid in its
implementation.
- 50% of buildings built since the rules were introduced in 2010 are *already* meeting the "Gold" standard, despite
(largely) not being required to do so.
- nearly all new large construction meets the "Silver" standard.
While these projects in the presentation to the planning board were not divided by size, it seems likely that larger
projects are more likely to meet the "Gold" standard, especially as that has been the *required* standard for several
PUD districts (e.g. the MIT redevelopment PUD) for several years.
No estimates of impacts to construction are established -- neither the costs for compliance, expected slowing in rate of
construction, nor any other serious evaluation of the impacts of this change in ordinance.
Given how the LEED system works, buildings built in Cambridge have a high baseline of LEED points. While in some
communities, achieving LEED Platinum compliance is almost impossible, with the built environment in Cambridge, my
understanding is that this compliance is much more straightforward.
Before passing this ordinance as is, I would like to see the Council consider the following:
- Rather than going to Gold (for buildings >50k) and Silver (25k-50k), I would like to have the council consider requiring
Platinum (for buildings > 50k) and Gold (25k-50k).
- To understand the cost of this proposal, I would like CDD to prepare some kind of cost estimate increase to achieve
LEED Platinum relative to LEED gold on a large development; and LEED Silver to LEED Gold on a medium sized
development.
- Using recent examples of LEED Platinum buildings (e.g. the King Open School) as a way to estimate this might be one
way to get this information
- Contracting a designer to examine the difference on some recent build project would be another way.
- To understand the existing status of buildings, I would like CDD to break down the LEED levels of recent construction
projects by size (e.g. what portion of large buildings are gold vs. silver, what portion of medium sized buildings are gold
vs. silver.)
- I would like to understand what the relative reduction in energy usage is for an increase between these levels: ie, on
average, what type of energy use reductions are typical for an increase from Silver to Gold, or Gold to Platinum?
- I would like to understand if any consideration was made to make a distinction between residential and commercial
properties, and whether those property type distinctions have any impact on the costs for compliance.
In short: I think that CDD has suggested a zoning change which is largely meant to match the standards which are
already being met or exceeded. I believe that we should at least have a good understanding of what the impacts of

being more aggressive would be, and while I know that the City has suggested that these costs would be prohibitive, I
believe that they have not presented the information to back that claim up. I would ask the Council to request of the
petitioner that they provide a better analysis of the costs of compliance to reach higher LEED levels, especially in larger
projects.
I hope that you will consider these questions when speaking to CDD staff in the ordinance committee meeting today.
All the best,

Exterior Insulation Benefits
Energy Star estimates that approximately 20% reductions in energy
used for heating and cooling needs could be realized if existing
structures were to perform continuous insulation retrofits

As approximately 60% of Cambridge’s building energy consumption is
attributed to heating and cooling, these potential savings could make
significant reductions in the City’s carbon emissions across the
building sector
For existing buildings, exterior insulation is often the least
disruptive way to improve the energy performance without
requiring extensive renovations which interrupt use of the interior space

Considerations
• Many existing buildings do not conform to setback standards
in zoning
• Alterations often require variances, which can be costly and
time-consuming for small property owners
• Greater zoning flexibility is one way the City can help
encourage positive change
• Limitations should be set to provide case-by-case review
where necessary, but not so limiting that it discourages
improvements
