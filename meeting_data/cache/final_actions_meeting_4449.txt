The Cambridge City Council hereby finds that the reduction of noise pollution; air pollution; harm to
wildlife, soil, and plants; and general negative public health outcomes from the combustion of petroleumbased fuels provide the basis for the public purposes of this Leaf Blowers Chapter. Whereas the use of
gas-powered leaf blowers contributes to the aforementioned pollutions, harms, and negative public health
outcomes, it is declared to be the policy of the City of Cambridge (“City”) to prohibit unnecessary,
excessive, and damaging noise, airborne dust, and harmful fumes caused by the use of gas-powered leaf
blowers to protect human health and reduce emissions, pursuant to the City's stated goals and objectives
to protect health and reduce emissions pollution. Further it is expected that the City shall send out
information notifying the public and commercial landscapers about the health and safety effects of gaspowered leaf blowers and inform them about this Chapter.
8.16.081.2 - Definitions.
1. Definition of “leaf blower.” A leaf blower is defined as a portable handheld or backpack style
power tool that is powered by petroleum-based fuel or electricity and used in any landscape
maintenance, construction, property repair, or property maintenance for the purpose of blowing,
moving, removing, dispersing, or redistributing leaves, dust, dirt, grass clippings, cuttings, and
trimmings from trees and shrubs or any other type of litter or debris. Excluded from this
definition are wheeled walk-behind four-stroke leaf blowers, as defined at subsection
8.16.81.2(3), and any leaf blowing devices attached to a tractor and/or mower.

‭municipalities, cities and towns have taken different approaches to phased-out limitations for residential,‬
‭commercial, and municipal use, but each of the below municipalities have committed to 2025 or 2026 for‬
‭commercial use. Maintaining the same timeline for commercial use and municipal use allows the City to‬
‭work toward its goal of phasing out the use of gas-powered leaf blowing equipment in a manner that‬
‭treats all commercial operators the same, regardless of whether or not they contract for the City.‬
‭Environmental and worker justice demand we take more urgent action to reduce the use of gas-powered‬
‭leaf blowers as soon as possible. In addition to these communities, other municipalities are considering‬
‭similar action on aggressive timelines across the state and across the country. The‬‭recent report from‬
‭MASSPIRG‬‭documents many of the adverse public impacts and highlights the drawbacks of gas-powered‬
‭lawn equipment and the benefits of transitioning to electric-powered equipment.‬

State of the
industry
(Leaf Blowers)

➢

Like the bans that Cambridge has had in
place since 2008, Leaf Blower bans of
various types have been enacted in Cities
and Towns across the United States over
the last several years.

➢

Similar to what we are seeing in the
Electric Vehicle industry pressure at the
Federal and State level has led to a boom
in the number of manufacturers bringing
electric vehicles to market.

➢

With the number of bans against leaf
blowers rising nationwide we are seeing
manufactures of this equipment more
aggressively pursuing battery-operated
alternatives to their gas counterparts.

Conclusions:
Cambridge
Department of
Public Works

LEAF BLOWERS
➢ The City could consider a Leaf Blower
ban similar to our neighboring towns
provided there are exemptions in place
for larger properties, specific operations,
or emergency situations.
➢

Would need to consider a long enough
lead time to allow Municipal,
Commercial and Residential operations
to adjust to the change.

➢

Financial assistance should be
considered where possible.

Why ban gas leaf blowers?
Public Health:
-

Gas-powered leaf blowers create localized emissions including many compounds and particulate matter that are toxic, carcinogenic,
and/or ozone-forming.
Most machines are louder than legal limits, which add to noise pollution.
Both electric and gas-powered leaf blowers use energy and disrupt the soil, but electric blowers are quieter and pollute less.

Worker Health:
-

Electric lawn equipment is far quieter than gasoline powered versions and produces reduced vibration – which can cause health
issues, including back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Sustained exposure to noise can lead to adverse health outcomes, including increased risks of mental illness and ischemic heart
disease.
The particulates users breathe can increase the risk of getting cancer and heart disease, especially for workers who use the
equipment for long periods of time.

Environmental Protection:
-

Operating a commercial leaf blower for just one hour produces as much smog-forming pollution as driving 1,100 miles in a car.
The ineﬃcient two-stroke engines are notoriously polluting which lack the advanced emission controls that have reduced pollution
from cars and trucks.

Local Action is Required

a

❖

To accelerate the transition to cleaner lawn equipment, governments must encourage the adoption of electric equipment
and consider restrictions on the most polluting fossil fuel equipment.

❖

EPA standards for leaf blowers and other small landscape equipment haven’t been updated since 2010 and there is no
statewide law in Massachusetts, so it’s up to cities and towns to regulate them

❖

In 2020 “lawn and garden equipment spewed an estimated 614,932 tons of carbon dioxide in Massachusetts – an amount
equivalent to the pollution from 135,371 typical cars”.

❖

According to the EPA, emissions from leaf blowers contribute to ozone air pollution and emit ﬁne particles leading to
respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues and premature death. Their fumes and exhaust give off known carcinogens
such as benzene and butadiene. The people most at risk have the motors with plastic fuel tanks strapped to their back

Why ban gas leaf blowers? (Continued)
From MassPIRG Report, Oct. 30, 2023:

MassPIRG Recommendations:

“Electric lawn equipment is cleaner, quieter and, over a lifetime of
use, often cheaper than fossil fuel-powered options. Recent
advances in battery technology allow cordless electric lawn
equipment to achieve comparable performance with
gasoline-powered equipment for many jobs.”

To improve the quality of the air we breathe and protect the climate,
states and cities should take concrete steps to encourage a transition
from gasoline powered lawn equipment to cleaner electric options.

“In the United States, lawn and garden equipment powered by
gasoline and other fossil fuels released more than 30 million tons
of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in 2020 – more than all the
greenhouse gas emissions from the city of Los Angeles. That same
equipment emitted air pollution linked to serious health problems in
amounts comparable to those from tens of millions of cars.”
“Electric lawn equipment sometimes has a higher initial price tag
but saves money over time due to lower operating costs.”

Source: https://pirg.org/massachusetts/resources/lawn-care-goes-electric/

Local and state governments, along with major institutions, should lead
by example by adopting electric lawn equipment for their own facilities.
Local and state governments should create ﬁnancial incentives to
encourage the purchase of electric lawn equipment.
To meet the particular needs of commercial landscapers, opportunities
for education, training and technical support should be provided.
Local and state governments should consider policies that phase out
sales of gasoline-powered lawn equipment over time, and/or restrict
the use of the noisiest and most polluting equipment in certain
circumstances..”

allowed until March 15, 2027 2026.
Packet Pg. 2212

Rationale for
Further
Amendments:

➢

Timeline is in line with other Massachusetts municipalities

➢

Maintaining the same timeline for commercial use and municipal use
allows the City to work toward its goal of phasing out the use of
gas-powered leaf blowing equipment in a manner that treats all
commercial operators the same, regardless of whether or not they
contract for the City.

➢

Environmental and worker justice demand we take more urgent action
to reduce the use of gas-powered leaf blowers as soon as possible.

➢

In addition to the communities outlined in the chart, other
municipalities are considering similar action on aggressive timelines
across the state and across the country. The recent report from
MASSPIRG documents many of the adverse public impacts and
highlights the drawbacks of gas-powered lawn equipment and the
benefits of transitioning to electric-powered equipment.

Regarding CMA 2023 #268

Regarding CMA 2023 #268 Please adopt Councilor Nolan's Amendment for March 2026 Gas Powered Leaf
Blower Ban; or an as soon as possible ban by March 2025. And promote ecological alternatives for better
outcomes. Dear Cambridge City Councilors, Please phase out Gas Powered Leaf Blowers as soon as
possible! We have an environmental and public health responsibility to immediately phase out gas powered leaf
blower use. I support Councilor Patty Nolan's amendment to move a complete phase-out date to March 2026 but that is not soon enough to protect our workers or the environment. Exhaust from leaf blowers surrounds
workers who often do not wear masks or protection from deafening noise. Many of these workers likely have
language barriers to fully understanding the health risks they face and often rely on their jobs to support
dependents. - The negative environmental effects of gas powered leaf blowers are astounding! - Pollution
collects and is trapped in nearby buildings. - The effects of noise pollution from these devices is also unusually
disturbing over a wide area. https://pirg.org/massachusetts/edfund/resources/lawn-care-goes-electric/ We need
to immediately use non-polluting alternatives. A ban on gas leaf blowers should be accompanied by a public
education campaign promoting ecological yard care practices - rather than simply substituting battery powered
leaf blowers which are not ideal. I support Patty Nolan's amendment to the gas powered leaf blower ban which
requires transitioning by March 2026, and is more in line with surrounding towns. However, this does not go far
enough in our responsibilities to workers, the environment, and the community - we need to transition now. A
ban by March of 2025 should give ample time for all users to decide on an alternative for this problematic gas
tool. Thank you for your tremendous work on behalf of our community! Kelly Roberts

Support for an Amendment to CMA 2023 #268

Dear City Councillors,
Mothers Out Front Cambridge strongly supports measures to ban gas‐powered leaf blowers in Cambridge, including
Councillor Nolan's amendment to CMA 2023 #268. The amendment would move a complete phase‐out of gas‐powered
leaf blowers to March 2026. That is still more than two years away. In our opinion, even that is not soon enough to
address the environmental and public health dangers posed by gas‐powered landscaping equipment.
Gas‐powered leaf blowers contribute to both air pollution and noise pollution. The air pollution from exhaust collects
and is trapped in nearby buildings. The noise pollution disturbs over a wide area.
Even more concerning are the environmental justice issues raised by the use of this equipment. Exhaust from gas‐
powered blowers surrounds workers, who may or may not be wearing masks. A large percentage of these workers may
have language barriers to fully understanding the health risks they are facing. In addition, they often rely on their jobs to
support dependents. Seeking more healthful working conditions is often not an option.
For these reasons we urge you to pass CMA 2023 #268 after including Councillor Nolan's amendment to change the
enforcement date to March 2026. We also urge the city of Cambridge to immediately institute a public education
campaign promoting ecological yard‐care practices, rather than simply substituting battery‐powered leaf blowers, which
are far from ideal.
Thank you for your attention to this important public health and environmental justice issue.
Sincerely,
Lois Markham, Elena Fagotto, Margery Davies, Lowry Hemphill
for the Cambridge Mothers Out Front Leadership Team
