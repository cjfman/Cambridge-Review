PUBLIC COMMENTS.
Christopher Cassa, address not provided, spoke on
Agenda Items #276 and #277. He acknowledged the challenges
faced by some businesses and residents due to changes in the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

area. He suggested providing preloaded bus memberships or
blue bikes memberships to those affected and implementing
dynamic meter pricing. He also mentioned a proposed balanced
solution by the Porter Square Neighborhood Association that
involves collaboration between business owners, cyclists,
and transit communities. He encouraged everyone to support
this solution and visit the massaveforall.com website for
more information.
Vivek Sikri, Cambridgeport, Spoke on Agenda Items #276
and #277. He shared his experience of stopping biking to
work after a fatal accident and choosing to drive and park
in resident parking instead. He emphasized the urgency of
taking action to address climate change and reallocating
publicly-owned street space to meet future needs.
He suggested solutions such as changing delivery to
bicycle-based, offering curbside pickup, or providing tax
breaks to help balance added costs for affected businesses.
He urged the city to act and not delay, emphasizing that the

Packet Pg. 40

1

current road system is part of the environmental problem and
needs to change for the sake of future generations. He
encouraged not letting perfection be the enemy of good.
Amanda Sindel-Keswick, Wellington Harrington, spoke on
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Bike Safety Ordinance. She expressed gratitude towards the
City and TPT for the newly installed protected bike lanes on
North Mass Ave. She emphasized the importance of making the
city navigable for non-car owners and those who prefer
climate-friendly transportation. While acknowledging that
change can be difficult, she pointed out that safety should
be prioritized over car storage.
In response to complaints about empty bus lanes, she
argued that this could be an indication of their
effectiveness. He suggested that traffic congestion may be
caused by factors other than the bike lanes, such as a lack
of bus or bike usage due to an ineffective network. She also
noted that existing committees are well-equipped to provide
input on bike safety matters and that a new committee may
not be necessary.
Aaron Greiner, address not provided, spoke on Policy
Orders that would limit the safe cycling ordinance. Despite
facing dangerous situations on the road while cycling,
1
Packet Pg. 41

1

Greiner expressed appreciation for the positive changes
brought about by the safe cycling ordinance and similar City
measures. The resident shared that biking in Cambridge is
now safer, more secure, and convenient, which has encouraged
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

both him and their friends to use cycling as a preferred
mode of transportation. He voiced opposition to the proposed
policy orders that would curtail the ordinance and suggested
that prioritizing the safety and mobility of people would
create a healthier, happier, and sustainable Cambridge.
Randy Stern, Cambridgeport, spoke on Agenda Item POR
2021 #276, POR 2021 #277. He expressed that these orders
should not hinder the City's progress towards safe cycling
infrastructure and urged for the city staff to be allowed to
continue their work efficiently. He emphasized the need for
safe protected bike lanes and bus priority lanes in order to
support individuals who choose to walk, bike, or take mass
transit for their daily needs.
He believes that studies have shown that creating such
infrastructure will drive more people to use these modes of
transportation. He acknowledged that some businesses on Mass
Ave may feel that reduced parking will lead to a reduction
in business, but pointed out that the City bike plan
2
Packet Pg. 42

1

includes statistics showing that more people would choose to
bike if there were safe bike lanes available. Stern urged
City Councillors to stay the course and continue their
efforts towards safe cycling infrastructure.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Dylan Callahan, address not provided, spoke on Charterrighted Policy Orders. He spoke on the importance of having
separated bike lanes for cyclist safety. He shared a
personal experience where he encountered difficulties when
he exited the protected bike lanes on Mass Ave due to people
double parking in the lane, opening doors into the lane, or
pulling up ahead to park.
He explained that placing bike lanes directly between
parking and a lane of traffic is simply bad design, and it
is unsafe for cyclists. Dylan urged that the design should
be changed to separate bike lanes from traffic and parking
without any delay. He spoke against policy orders 276 and
277 that would hinder this process.
Gloria Korsman, North Cambridge, spoke on Bike Safety.
She shared that she uses a bike for transportation, for
reasons such as health, well-being, a cleaner environment,
and budget. Despite being a careful rule-following rider,
she has had several close calls on the streets without
3
Packet Pg. 43

1

protected bike lanes. She recounted an incident where a bus
passed her too closely and almost hit her, as well as an
incident where someone leaked out of a parked car and threw
her off her bike. Protected bike lanes would have prevented
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

both incidents. She agrees that stakeholders should be able
to provide feedback to improve bike lane designs, but
opposes the policy orders that would delay the
implementation of the Cycling Safety Ordinance.
Ryan Houlette, North Cambridge, spoke on Bike Safety.
He talked about the challenges of biking in the city,
especially on the Mass Ave corridor. He and his family rely
on public transit and walking to get around and would like
to add biking as a practical option. However, safety
concerns and lack of protected bike lanes are deterrents. He
has seen positive changes in North Cambridge with the
addition of new bike lanes and believes solving these
challenges now is essential for progress.
Mark Boswell, Walden Street in Cambridge, spoke on POR
276, 277. He supports the creation of a Citywide network of
separated bike lanes, as they are important for climate
action, public health, and sustainable transportation.
However, he urges the Council to vote on POR 276 and 277, as
4
Packet Pg. 44

1

they would create redundant committees that could impede the
implementation of Cycling Safety Ordinances. Boswell
encourages Councillors to use existing advisory committees
and the economic development department to ensure proper
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

communication among residents and stakeholders. If the
orders are not voted down, he suggests amending them to
ensure input does not cause delays in implementation.
Sasha Albert, address not provided, spoke on Bike
Safety. She spoke on the need for improved bicycle
infrastructure in Cambridge. Specifically, she highlighted
the dangerous stretch of JFK Street between Anderson
Memorial Bridge and Harvard Square, where cyclists are
frequently "doored" by cars and rideshares stopping in the
traffic lane. Sasha has been injured multiple times in this
area and emphasized the importance of separate protected
bike lanes for safety and accessibility. She commended
Cambridge's efforts in this area but urged the city to
continue prioritizing it.
David Halperin, 115 Auburn Street, spoke on Charter
Right #2. He commended the City's traffic and parking
improvements, specifically the new protected bike lanes,
which he believes have made biking on Mass Ave safer. He
5
Packet Pg. 45

1

stressed the importance of continuing to build these lanes
without delays to prevent cyclist accidents, which happen on
a weekly basis. He suggested that parking is a luxury that
encourages driving and should be reallocated to greener
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

forms of transportation, such as bikes and buses. He also
mentioned that studies have shown that removing parking to
add bike lanes can benefit local businesses by providing
easier access for customers. Finally, he acknowledged that
COVID-19 is the main obstacle facing local businesses, not
the bike lanes.
Ted Lester, address not provided, spoke on Bike Safety.
He spoke in support of the new protected bike lanes along
Northern Mass Ave. He commutes on an e-bike daily from
Porter Square to Burlington and shops at local businesses
along the way. He believes that the Cambridge protected bike
lane ordinance is an excellent model for other cities to
follow.
The new bike lanes make Mass Ave safer and more
efficient for cyclists, reducing the chance of being hit by
car doors or turning cars and thereby reducing injuries and
fatalities. He suggests better education about how private
and commercial vehicles can use the shared bus lane as a
6
Packet Pg. 46

1

loading zone during the day.
Ben Pearre, address not provided, spoke on Bike Safety.
He started biking everywhere in Boulder, Colorado and
continued to do so when he moved to Cambridge. However, in
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Cambridge, he often felt afraid and angry due to the
behavior of some drivers. He believes that improving cycling
infrastructure can benefit not just cyclists but also
pedestrians, drivers, and public health outcomes such as
blood pressure, obesity, and pollution. He also emphasized
the importance of addressing climate change by promoting
biking as an alternative mode of transportation.
Laura McMurry, Harvard Street, spoke on bike lanes
issue. She expressed her thoughts on the bike lane issue in
Cambridge. After years of biking and experiencing traffic,
she was skeptical about the safety of biking until she saw a
vision of a cycle track beside Western Avenue. She believes
that the new protected bike lanes will invite more people,
especially parents with children and seniors who feel
uncertain about biking.
Additionally, she thinks that these new lanes will save
lives and reduce injuries and permanent impairments. McMurry
acknowledges the loss of parking and loading spots due to
7
Packet Pg. 47

1

the new lanes but believes that there are adequate ways of
communicating and discussing these issues with the existing
systems. She supports the protected bike lanes and hopes
that the Cycling Safety Ordinance will continue to move
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

forward in a timely manner.
Brandon Marder, address not provided, spoke on CMA 2022
#1. He expressed his opinion on the recent mask mandate
which has been made even more restrictive. He believes that
COVID-19 is not the same problem as it was a year ago, as
highly effective vaccines are now easily available in the
country. Marder believes that if the vaccines are as
effective as everyone believes they are, there is no need to
require people to wear masks. However, if the vaccines are
not effective, then much more needs to be done than an
unenforced mask mandate that also allows people to eat
inside restaurants. He thinks that it's time to get rid of
the mask mandate.
Jonathan Freidin, address not provided, spoke on Policy
Orders #276 and #277. He spoke in favor of prioritizing
bicycle safety and infrastructure improvements to combat
climate change. He shared his experience of using a bicycle
as his primary transportation for over a decade and
8
Packet Pg. 48

1

discussed the benefits of the new separated sections on
North Mass Avenue. He urged the Council not to adopt policy
orders that hinder progress in improving bicycle safety.
Michael Rome, North Cambridge, spoke on Bike Safety. He
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

expressed his support for the City's efforts to prioritize
moving people over cars. He commended the new bike lanes on
Massachusetts Avenue but expressed concerns about their
maintenance during winter, leading to safety hazards for
cyclists. Rome also mentioned that his neighbors have raised
concerns about the impact of the bike lanes on local
businesses and traffic. Despite this, he believes that there
is still enough space on Mass Avenue to accommodate
pedestrians, bicycles, parking, and traffic if planned
properly. Rome urged the city to continue setting up bike
lanes and learn from their experiences as they go.
McNamara Buck, Gold Star Road, spoke on Bike Safety.
She has been living in the area for 35 years and cycling for
that entire time, along with their family members. She
appreciates the efforts the city has made to increase
cycling safety and provide safe infrastructure for cyclists.
They believe cycling keeps them active and allows them to
shop locally. She opposes the two policy orders and
9
Packet Pg. 49

1

encourages the City to continue developing a safe cycling
system for everyone in line with the Cycling Safety
Ordinance.
Alex Epstein, Porter Square, spoke on Bike Safety. He
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

mentioned the importance of protected bike lanes on
dangerous streets like Mass Ave and Hampshire. As a parent
who walks and bikes with his kids to school, he is concerned
about the safety of children crossing busy streets with
parked cars that obstruct the crosswalks. He urges the City
Council to prioritize the safety of families and the
community over preserving the status quo.
Despite concerns about potential business impact, he
believes that the implementation of protected bike lanes
should continue at a consistent pace. He suggests that dire
predictions about business impact should be supported by
data, citing a Bloomberg report that shows even corner deli
owners in Midtown Manhattan opposed changes that would make
it harder to drive to their businesses, despite the fact
that no one would drive to a Corner Deli in Manhattan to buy
a sandwich.
Cynthia Hughes, Fast Phil's of North Cambridge, spoke
on Policy Orders #276 and #277. She mentioned that Fast
10
Packet Pg. 50

1

Phil's has never been against bike lanes and would like to
see their implementation continue in a timely manner.
However, she requested fair parking for everyone and hoped
that the City Council would work with everyone and not just
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

one particular group.
She added that Fast Phil's has been in business for 18
years and serves various customers, including bikers,
walkers, and drivers, and they do not want to go out of
business. Finally, she thanked the City Council and
congratulated Paul Toner, hoping for a happy new year.
Steven Miller, 92 Henry Street, spoke on Bike safety
for elders. He spoke in support of the two replacement
orders and language related to bike safety, instead of
Policy Orders #276 and #277. Having lived in Cambridge for
almost 45 years and now in his mid-70s, he and many of his
friends rely on bicycles to get around the city, especially
as they age and driving at night becomes more challenging.
He emphasized that public streets are owned by everyone and
should be used for the benefit of the entire population,
rather than just for cars and storage of cars. He sees
promoting life, environmental health, and business success
as important reasons to continue building the extended
11
Packet Pg. 51

1

separated bike network that the city has already started.
Justin Saif, 259 Harley Street, spoke on Bike Safety
Infrastructure. He expressed his views on the bike safety
infrastructure. He stated that he rides his bike every day
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and has two young children who are learning to ride bikes as
well. He feels that many of the busy streets in Cambridge
are not safe for families to ride on, but he supports the
new protected bike lane infrastructure and would use it to
take his family on longer rides to reach further
destinations. He believes that the Council should continue
to move forward expeditiously to expand the network of
protected bike lanes, as further proposals for process may
delay progress.
Ekavali Mishra, address not provided, spoke on Bike
Safety. Having lived in Cambridge 15 years ago and avoided
biking due to safety concerns, she is now a frequent user of
bike lanes throughout the city for commuting, shopping, and
visiting local businesses. She is a supporter of the current
test bike safety lane on Mass Ave and uses both Blue Bikes
and a personal bike, feeling incentivized to bike and walk
instead of drive. She urges the Council to prioritize safe
bike infrastructure solutions.
12

Lee Jenkins, address not provided, spoke on Policy
Order #1 and #2. As a resident of Cambridge and a business
owner on Mass Ave, Lee urged the Council to vote in favor of
policy orders 276 and 277 as written. Lee highlighted the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

challenges faced by small businesses in the city due to the
impact of Omicron, as reported by The Boston Globe. Lee
expressed concern that taking away parking would further
harm small businesses, and argued that bike lanes do have an
impact on businesses, contrary to what some bike advocates
claim.
She provided business data to support this argument and
expressed frustration with the influence of special interest
bike groups on City Council and the Cambridge DOT. Lee
argued that the influence of these groups creates an unfair
imbalance between their coordinated efforts and the general
public. She also noted that prioritizing the wishes of
special interest groups can be unpopular with the public, as
shown by the results of the last City poll which indicated
that Cambridge residents were not in favor of the bike
groups' agenda.
Frank Kramer, address not provided, spoke on Policy
Orders $276 and #277. He argued that the current process has
13
Packet Pg. 53

1

excluded these stakeholders and that including them would
benefit the community. He expressed confusion about why
those in favor of bike lanes would not want to include
important stakeholders and urged the Council to vote in
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

favor of the policy orders, suggesting a potential
modification to increase the number of people on the
advisory committee.
Michael Bane, 2179 Mass Ave, spoke on Policy Orders
#276 and #277, arguing that harm is being done to small
businesses as a result of the current bike lane plan.
Michael urged the Council to consider alternative solutions,
such as those proposed by the Mass Ave for All group, which
would allow for a protected bike lane, a bus lane, and a
parking lane. He called for a collaborative approach and for
the Council to take leadership in creating a project that is
fair and good for all stakeholders. Michael urged the
Council to vote in favor of the policy orders to begin this
process.
Anne Bane, 2179 Massachusetts Ave, spoke on Policy
Orders #276 and 3277. She expressed concern about the impact
of the quick-build plan on the disabled, the elderly, and
small businesses in the community. She voiced support for
14
Packet Pg. 54

1

policy order #276 to ensure that all parties have a voice in
the planning process and urged the Council to consider the
design proposed by the Mass Ave for All group, which
includes protected bike lanes, a bus lane, and a parking
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

lane on each side of the road.
She also endorsed Policy Order #277 to ensure that the
implementation of the ordinance does not disadvantage some
parts of the community, particularly small businesses and
vulnerable populations. She suggested that a mitigation plan
be created to assist businesses that have already been
impacted by the quick-build plan. Bane appealed to the
Council to support the livelihoods of all those in the
community and ensure that equal consideration is given to
the needs of bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.
Janie Katz-Christy, 166 Elm Street in North Cambridge,
spoke on Policy Orders #1 and #2. She shared how her
children's concern about the climate crisis led her to get
rid of her car and rely on local businesses instead. KatzChristy emphasized the importance of safe bike lanes, which
would enable people like her late mother-in-law, who was
legally blind, to travel safely by tricycle to important
destinations like Dr. Frank Bane's dental office on Mass
15
Packet Pg. 55

1

Ave. She noted that she and her family patronize many of the
businesses along North Mass Ave and that relying less on
cars would actually benefit local businesses in the long
run. Finally, she urged City Council members to consider the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

impact of their decisions on future generations and take
real action to address climate change, which she sees as one
of the most pressing issues of our time.
Timothy Keefe, address not provide, spoke on POR 2021
#276 and POR 2021 #277, agreeing with previous speakers and
emphasizing the need for infrastructure that benefits
bicyclists, motorists, pedestrians, seniors, those with
mobility issues, and local businesses. He also supports the
removal of median strips to improve accessibility.
Young Kim, 17 North Street, spoke on Calendar Items 1,
2 Charter Righted POR 2021 #276, #277. Kim urged the Council
to pass policy orders 276 and 277 after amending them to
merge with previously approved orders. Kim requested that
the city conduct a review of measures already implemented on
Mass Avenue and convene a task force to mitigate the
negative impacts of the implementation.
David Kalan, Porter Square area Richdale Avenue, spoke
on Bike Safety. He spoke about his experience as a bicycle
16
Packet Pg. 56

1

commuter in Cambridge for the past 30 years. He expressed
his support for the City's efforts to create safer bicycling
methods, especially with the separated bike lanes. He
believes that protected bike lanes are not only a safety
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

issue but a quality-of-life issue that will benefit the
entire community. Despite the minor inconvenience of losing
a few parking spots, he thinks the overall benefit is huge
and deserves a steady implementation.
Gleb Bahmutov, 19 Winslow Street, Cambridge, spoke on
POR 2021 #276, POR 2021 #277. He expressed gratitude towards
the City Council for implementing street safety changes that
made his recent bike trips enjoyable and safe. He explained
how he rode his bike to various places, including Boston and
Somerville, and felt protected and safe for most of the
trip. He even stated that his bike ride was faster than a
car ride, as he could bypass cars in traffic and never
looked for parking. He praised the cities for their
improvement towards a more bike-friendly environment and
reducing pollution.
Robin Chase, Cottage Street, spoke on 2021 POR #276 and
#277. She highlighted that 40% of households in Cambridge do
not own a car, and most of the rights of way have been
17
Packet Pg. 57

1

dedicated to cars for the past 30 years. She commended the
efforts being made to share the rights of way among

convenient walking, biking, and public transportation for

children and adults alike.
She also mentioned that bus lanes around the world have
been found to improve retail businesses because pedestrians
and cyclists have greater knowledge of and access to local
stores. She believes that increasing the number of
households that don't have cars will lead to more support
for local businesses.
Sonia Kowal, 59 Market Street, spoke on Bike Safety.
She spoke about the importance of reducing car use to combat
climate change and how continuing to prioritize car
infrastructure is short-sighted. She expressed support for
the protected bike lanes on Mass Ave and commended the
City's leadership on climate and safety.
Lynn McGregor, Karen Ave in West Cambridge, spoke on
Bike Safety. She expressed support for the City's plan to
install protected bike lanes and concerns that policy orders
276 and 277 may delay the improvement of street safety. As a
bicycle commuter, she appreciates the City's implementation
18

of a protected counterflow bike lane on Quincy Street and
looks forward to more interconnected bike lanes to encourage
biking for transportation. McGregor also notes that biking
reduces the demand for parking at destinations and urges the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Council to vote against the policy orders.
Jason Alves, 544 Cambridge Street, spoke on Charter 1
and 2. He expressed gratitude to the Council for considering
the policy orders related to creating working groups for the
bike plan. He stated that most people and businesses are not
against bike safety, but are concerned about the
implementation process. These policy orders aim to bring
people together to avoid the current state of tension
between different groups.
He views these orders as an opportunity to include
small businesses in conversations and address their concerns
to move forward together. He acknowledged that there are
amendments to the orders but believes that the spirit is
right to bring people together to solve these problems. He
hopes that the Council will support the two charter right
items.
Jennifer Dever Wood, 5 Dexter Road, spoke in support of
Policy Orders 276 and 277, which aim to ensure that all
19
Packet Pg. 59

1

stakeholders have a voice and that the implementation of the
quick-build plan does not disadvantage some parts of the
community. She expressed concern that the current plan for
the quick-build may have a profound impact on the disabled,
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the elderly, and the business communities, as evidenced by
its impact on completed sections of Mass Ave. She emphasized
the need for equitable consideration for bicyclists,
pedestrians, and cars, and the creation of a mitigation plan
to assist affected businesses. She urged the Council to
ensure that all voices in the community are heard and
appreciated the hard work of everyone involved in this
contentious issue.
Eric Garnick, Chester Street in North Cambridge, spoke
on POR 2021 #277. He expressed his concern regarding the
removal of parking and lanes on Mass Ave. He uses his bike
for almost all local trips but is worried that the public
transportation system is not good enough to support the
changes. He doubts the economic and social projections of
advocates for the current arrangement and suggests a better
compromise and balance. He has cycled in Central London
where bikes and buses share dedicated lanes and proposes a
similar solution for Mass Ave. Lastly, he's worried about
20
Packet Pg. 60

1

the increased hostility generated by the current
arrangement.
Jeanne Oster, address not provided, spoke on Charter
Right #1 and #2. She emphasized her support for safe cycling
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

infrastructure but expressed concern that it would require a
complete redesign of the city. She pointed out that the
policy orders proposed a process for stakeholder input,
evaluation, and negative consequence reduction. She also
suggested creating a diversified advisory committee to
ensure the needs of residents, pedestrians, and businesses
were met.
She highlighted the importance of businesses on Mass
Ave, such as doctors, lawyers, beauty salons, tattoo
artists, and specialty shops, stating that they had built a
diverse customer base over the years and would not survive
on Cambridge residents alone. Lastly, she recommended
evaluating the current implementation of separated bike
lanes to ensure they achieved their goal of providing safety
while allowing businesses to continue operating.
Denise Jillson, address not provided, spoke on Policy
Order #1 and #2. She emphasized the importance of a
coalition of businesses and residents who have come together
21
Packet Pg. 61

1

to ensure their voice is heard in the design of the Mass Ave
bike infrastructure. She expressed her support for the
proposed 26 miles of bike infrastructure and stated that
their goal is not to change the timeframe for
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

implementation. Rather, they want an equal voice in the
decision-making process to ensure that the design works for
all stakeholders. She thanked the Council and emphasized
that their goals are the same, and they simply want to be
included in the conversation.
John Pitkin, 18 Bay Street, spoke on Charter Right #1
and #2. He believes that the proposed bike lanes are the
most impactful transportation project in Cambridge since the
extension of the red line from Harvard Square to Alewife. He
presented a report from a Transportation Planning Study
conducted by the City's Planning and Traffic Departments,
which recommended a representative process that considers
the interests of all citizens involved and affected. He
believes that the charter righted items are in the spirit of
the 1972 Council decision that supports a well-informed and
involved public decision-making process.
Mike Nakagawa, 51 Madison Avenue, spoke on Policy Order
#2. He expressed concerns about the creation of more
22
Packet Pg. 62

1

Advisory Committees, which tend to delay progress and
produce weak recommendations. He cited the example of the
2016 Cambridge Flooding Preparedness Planning Alewife
Working Group, which failed to produce concrete results.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

He also highlighted the slow progress of the Climate
Resiliency Zoning Task Force and Envision Cambridge
processes, both of which started in 2016 but still have no
zoning. This has allowed developers to pick and choose what
suits them best, driving up housing costs in Cambridge.
Nakagawa urged for a focus on aligning planning documents
and zoning to prepare for the future.
Joan Pickett, 59 Ellery Street, spoke Policy Order #276
and #277, calling for an inclusive Safety Ordinance Advisory
Committee to address the needs of all stakeholders in the
bike lane implementation process. She cited the experiences
of mid-Cambridge businesses, who have documented losses in
revenue and customers, contradicting claims that businesses
will see an increase in revenue from bike traffic. Pickett
emphasized the importance of an inclusive process to ensure
the survival of businesses in the area. She urged the
Council to approve Policy Order #276 and #277 as amended.
Angela Hofmann, North Cambridge, spoke on Policy Order
23
Packet Pg. 63

1

#276 and #277. She mentioned that other Porter Square
business owners, including Susanna's, Guitar Stop, and
Simon's Coffee Shop, also support the policy orders. They
all want bike lanes to be implemented in a timely manner
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

while considering the concerns of all stakeholders, as shown
by the Mass Ave for All group's plans.
Leslie Oliver, North Cambridge, spoke on Agenda Items
#1 and #2. He expressed his disappointment that the focus
has solely been on bike safety and emphasized the importance
of considering the concerns of all stakeholders. He and his
wife, who has mobility problems, rely solely on their
automobile and are concerned about the separate bus lanes
that are empty and lead to increased carbon monoxide
emissions from idling cars.
He supports Policy Orders #276 and #277 as they will
bring out more information regarding these concerns. He also
believes that there needs to be a way to ensure the safety
of bicyclists who sometimes disregard traffic rules. Leslie
hopes that by working together, these issues can be
resolved.
Eva Connelly, West Cambridge, spoke on Agenda Items 21104. She spoke about her love for the City's diversity and
24
Packet Pg. 64

1

acceptance of all individuals, regardless of factors such as
age, race, gender, or disability. She expressed concern
about potential discrimination against unvaccinated
individuals and stated that she has personal experience
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

living under a totalitarian system that required individuals
to show identification papers.
She mentioned that some people have chosen not to
receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to unknown long-term
safety risks and that the vaccines were developed at a much
faster pace than usual. She also cited statistics from
Stanford University professor John Ioannidis indicating a
high survival rate for COVID-19 and mentioned the potential
side effects of the vaccine, including myocarditis,
pericarditis, and blood clots.
Albert Duarte, 2130 Mass Ave, spoke on Policy Order #1
POR 2021 #276, and Policy Order #2 POR 2021 #277. He
expressed concern about the impact of Policy Order #276 and
#277 on seniors and individuals with disabilities who rely
on cars to access essential medical and dental care. He
argued that the loss of parking spaces would create a burden
for local businesses and attract less people to the area. He
also criticized the dedicated bus lane on Mass Ave, citing
25
Packet Pg. 65

1

increased traffic and carbon emissions. He urged the City
Council to plan better before taking action.
Benjamin Mazzotta, address not provided, spoke on
Calendar Item #2/ That the City Manager is requested to
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

convene meetings. He urged the Council to reject proposals
that would delay or weaken safe bicycle infrastructure for
the city. He shared his personal experience of being in a
bike crash due to parked cars obstructing the view of a
pedestrian. He emphasized the need to protect bicycle
infrastructure for the safety of his children and future
generations, and called for changes in how the city uses
public land, roads, and sidewalks to build safe bike lanes
now.
Stephen Helfer, Crawford Street, spoke on Policy Orders
# 276 and #277. He expressed concern about the impact of
bicycle lanes on the elderly and disabled who rely on
parking to visit their doctors or run errands. He supported
Policy Orders #276 and #277, which would address the
problems associated with the implementation of bicycle
lanes. Helfer also mentioned the need to carefully evaluate
the data on the impact of bicycle lanes on local businesses,
which he believed was biased.
26
Packet Pg. 66

Lisa Bernazani, 2285 Mass Ave in North Cambridge, spoke
on the effects of parking removal. She urged the City
Council to consider the needs of all stakeholders in
creating a balanced plan for bike infrastructure. She owns a
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

car and a bike and believes that the current policy on bike
lanes hurts businesses by removing parking. She argued that
the removal of parking would put her and other businesses
out of business and that the city should prioritize the
needs of all residents, including those who rely on motor
vehicles to patronize local businesses.
Kristiana Lachiusa, address not provided, spoke on
Charter Right #1 and #2, stating that they may not produce
the desired outcome. She raised three specific points,
including the exclusion of transit riders as key
stakeholders in Policy Order #277, the need to prioritize
equity in community engagement, and the potential shift
towards a motor vehicle-centered focus if the policies are
passed. She emphasized the importance of advancing policies
that focus on transit, walking, and biking to achieve the
City's ambitious climate goals.
James Williamson, North Cambridge, spoke on More
Responsible Planning of Bile Lanes. He spoke about the need
27
Packet Pg. 67

1

for responsible planning of bike lanes. He expressed concern
about the reduction in bus services and the need to focus on
that issue. He also criticized the lack of enforcement of
rules for cyclists and called for rules to be put in place
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and enforced. He criticized the City's focus on
infrastructure rather than enforcement, and suggested that
good ideas for planning should have been considered earlier.
Marni Clippinger, 9 Avon Street, spoke in support of
Policy Orders #276 and #277. She believes that the anger and
animosity surrounding discussions about the Bicycle Safety
Ordinance have become a dividing line in the community. She
encourages the City Council to make informed decisions based
on the concerns of a representative group of citizens,
including the elderly, mobility-impaired, and non-cyclist
residents who may have been overlooked in the initial
passage of the ordinance. She sees these policy orders as an
opportunity to reassess and course-correct, rather than
overruling bicycle safety.
Steedman Bass, 6 Shephard Street, spoke on Bike Safety.
He highlighted the convenience of walking and cycling in the
dense City and the benefits of making it safe for cyclists
to access local businesses. He also pointed out that
28
Packet Pg. 68

1

improving cycling safety can attract customers who cannot
own cars, such as the large student population in the town.
Overall, he called for a dedicated effort to enhance cycling
safety in Cambridge.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Ollie Donaldson, address not provided. I just wanna
spoke against the implementation of Policy Orders 276 and
277. She argued that the proposals will only add more
bureaucracy to an already thorough process. The creation of
more committees will delay the installation of bike and bus
lanes and exclude the input of low-income bike and bus
commuters. As a bike and car commuter, she noted that bike
lanes have made the streets safer for cyclists and increased
foot traffic to local businesses. Canceling bike or bus lane
implementation would harm local businesses and people who
rely on walking or taking the bus due to disabilities or
financial constraints. She urged the City Council to vote
against the policy orders.
Robert MacLean, address not provided, spoke on Agenda
Items 21-240. He spoke against the possible COVID vaccine
mandate for restaurants. As a restaurant owner in Inman
Square, he argued that implementing such a mandate, as done
in Somerville and Boston, would force him to fire his staff.
29
Packet Pg. 69

1

He expressed concern about the demographics of those who
would be affected, citing that it would disproportionately
impact women with children in low tax brackets. He also
noted the economic impact of losing unvaccinated customers
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and the already struggling restaurant industry. He requested
that the city conduct studies before implementing such a
mandate.
Francis Bane, 2179 Mass Ave, spoke in support of Policy
Orders #276, #277. He believes that the Bicycle Safety
Ordinance should include protections for buses, as they are
not a fragile form of transportation. He argued that
businesses and elderly and disabled individuals need more
protection under the current quick-build plan, as patients
with disabilities cannot park or access their businesses. He
criticized the lack of parking in the plan and suggests that
the new Council should serve the most vulnerable and
voiceless, including the elderly and disabled.
Alexandra Whisnant, address not provided, spoke on
proposed vaccine mandate in Cambridge, in restaurants, and
other indoor spaces. She questioned the potential impact on
employees who might be fired due to this mandate and urged
the Council to study the impact on workers in restaurants,
30
Packet Pg. 70

1

gyms, theaters, and other venues before implementing such a
mandate. She emphasized that the restaurant industry has
already suffered losses, and many employees are leaving for
other jobs. She urged the Council to get more data before
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

laying off a significant part of the workforce and crippling
the industry further.
Carri Goldstein, 2285 Mass Ave, spoke in support Policy
Orders #276 and #277 in regards to the bike lanes on Mass
Ave. She clarified that she is not against bike safety or
the environment. She supports protected bike lanes and
public transportation but only if they result in a better,
safer, and more inclusive plan.
She suggested that businesses should be asked about
their needs and the easiest way to know what they need is to
ask. She also emphasized the importance of parking for the
disabled, elderly, and families with special needs,
especially for businesses that rely on customers from
neighboring towns and states who don't have access to the
same public transportation as Cambridge residents.
Amy A. Flax, address not provided, spoke against the
Policy Orders #276 and #277. She stated that as a senior
citizen who has lived and biked in Cambridge for 45 years,
31
Packet Pg. 71

1

she designed her routes on her bike based on protected
lanes. She praised the recent improvements in bike safety
and urged the city to continue supporting bike safety and
the Vision Zero initiative. She emphasized the importance of
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

safety and connected bike routes for senior citizens, and
encouraged the city to keep making progress in this area.
Elizabeth Gombosi, 42 Irving Street, spoke on Calendar
Items #1 and #2. She expressed concerns about the quickbuilds implemented for bike safety, stating that they have
not solved the problem for bicyclists and are causing harm
to other citizens and small businesses. She called for a
real discussion on how to achieve safety that also considers
the needs of all members of the community, including
stakeholders who should have their concerns taken into
account before major changes are made.
She shared her experience as a member of a stakeholder
committee formed by the city and expressed disappointment
that none of their concerns were addressed, despite promises
to review after the lanes were put in. She hopes that a
commission of all stakeholders will be appointed and their
suggestions will be heard.
Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street, spoke on Calendar
32
Packet Pg. 72

1

Items #1 and #2 - Cycling Safety. He urged the City Manager
to take action and consider the concerns of all Cambridge
residents, including physically challenged individuals and
local businesses. He emphasized the need for planning and
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

making room for everyone, rather than focusing solely on
bicycles. By listening to the full range of residents and
voters, Donovan believes the city can create a safer and
more equitable system.
Linda Moussouris, Mass Ave, spoke on POR #1 276 and POR
#2 277. As the wife of a dedicated 75-year-old cyclist, she
supports the proposals but has questions about their
retroactive impact on North Mass Ave and their use of the
experience gained from North Mass Ave to inform the bike
lanes across Cambridge. She suggests using what is happening
on North Mass Ave as a natural experiment and conducting a
comprehensive community assessment and planning process to
evaluate the situation. She and her husband have noticed
very few cyclists on North Mass Ave and have heard concerns
from restaurant owners. They urge the Council to evaluate
what is happening there.
Marc Pelletier, Boston, spoke on Bike Safety. He
addressed some comments made earlier, pointing out that most
33
Packet Pg. 73

1

of the road acreage is already dedicated to cars and parked
cars, and the plan aims to make space for all, including
cyclists. He noted the increase in aggressive driving and
the need to prioritize public safety, especially for
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

vulnerable road users like cyclists.
He shared a personal experience of being intentionally
hit by a driver on Mass Ave before the infrastructure was in
place and believes protected bike lanes could prevent such
incidents. He emphasized the need to decrease CO2 emissions
and take into account the impact on businesses while
transforming transportation to avoid climate disaster.
Arah Schuur, Walker Street in Somerville, spoke on POR
2021 #277. She is a cyclist and she stated that she has been
hit twice by motor vehicles while riding her bike. She
believes that protected bike lanes are necessary to make
cycling safer and more accessible for everyone. She
highlighted the unfair and unacceptable price that people
pay for using an inexpensive and climate-friendly way to get
around. She urged the City Councillors to reject Policy
Orders 276 and 277 and uphold Cambridge's commitment to
provide safe and equitable access by prioritizing moving
people through the City.

Richard Harding, address not provided, spoke on Bike
Ordinance. He believes that the current proposal was hurting
small businesses, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and urged the City Council to consider the needs of all
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

residents, including elderly and disabled individuals who
rely on cars for transportation. He also questioned the
notion of pitting cars against bikes and argued that there
should be a way for everyone to be satisfied.
He suggested that the city could look at the Western
Air Project as an example of how to create safer roads for
both cars and bikes. Additionally, he asked the City Council
to consider the opinions of people of color and those who
represent communities who care for others. He finished by
requesting that the Council observe the slowdown in bike and
bus traffic after 8:00 PM and offered to help bring more
diverse voices to the table.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, spoke on Robert's
Rules training. She spoke about two issues. Firstly, she
pointed out the importance of respecting and including all
members of the community, as incivility and disrespect can
silence people. Secondly, she urged the City Council to pay
attention to Mike Nakagawa's perspective on the Alewife Quad
35
Packet Pg. 75

1

Moratorium, and to correct the information provided on the
LS Alewife IV, LLC in the policy order. She expressed her
frustration with the construction and noise in her area, and
hoped that the Council would consider a moratorium on
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

further construction.
George Schneeloch, 81 School Street, spoke on Calendar
Items #1 and #2. He opposes the policy orders on Calendar
Items #1 and #2 as they are mean-spirited and criticize City
staff for implementing the Cycling Safety Ordinance to
eliminate serious injuries and deaths on Cambridge's streets
and to fight climate change. He believes that no
implementation is ever perfect and that City staff have made
every effort to address business parking needs. He suggested
that policy orders should offer constructive solutions and
urges the Council to vote against them.
Marissa Ventre, address not provided, spoke on the
proposed vaccine mandate. She argued that individuals should
have the right to make their own choices, even if they go
against the majority. She suggested encouraging indoor maskwearing as a more effective and equitable strategy to stop
the spread of COVID-19. She believes that the mandate is
unethical, un-American, and discriminatory towards the
36
Packet Pg. 76

1

13,000 Cambridge residents who are not vaccinated. She asked
the Council to consider the consequences of the mandate on
the mental health and wellbeing of these individuals and
halt the proposed mandate.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Joseph Sultan, address not provided, spoke on POR 2022
#2. He expressed support for the policy order on the Alewife
area moratorium, but asked that existing projects in the
pipeline be allowed to proceed. He stated that he and other
longtime Cambridge residents have small projects they would
like to pursue, and that it's hard to run a business when
existing laws are changing frequently. He also criticized
the policy order for sounding like it was written by a
specific company and asked for a delay of several months
before the moratorium begins.

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE: Good evening,
everyone, through you, Madam Mayor. Tonight, Derrick Neal
and I will provide you with an update on the City's ongoing
pandemic response. Before I move into my update, I want to
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

thank the Department of Public Works for the great job they
did responding to the most recent snow event. And I want to
thank the community for their efforts to keep our sidewalks
safe for all users.
With the expected extreme cold coming tonight, we are
providing extra resources and attention to support our
roundhouse community. For example, the Cambridge Warming
Center will stay open all day Tuesday, January 11th to allow
its overnights guests to stay inside. In Bay Coast Shelter
at too far at the Albany Street will expand its overnight
shelter to allow for additional guests.
Additionally, all Cambridge police officers have been
instructed to conduct continuous checks within their
assigned locations to be on the lookout for those who appear
to be without any need for shelter. Additionally, members of
the Cambridge Police, family and Social Services section
will be spending a majority of the day connecting and making
arraignments for individuals who are concerned in order to
41
Packet Pg. 81

1

get them situated prior to the dangerous cold temperatures.
Cambridge Police will continue to provide safe and
secure support to local shelters and coordinate
transportation if needed. As always, the community is asked
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to contact the First Step Streets Outreach Team at
6175926895, or the Cambridge Police Department at 6173493300
if someone is seen in the street and there's a concern about
them. Also, please call 911 if there's a medical emergency.
I will now move into my update. Cambridge to continues
to merit a state's national trends has experienced
significant increases in COVID-19 cases. Our daily case
count remains the largest we have seen at any point during
the pandemic and we are closely monitoring the situation.
Cambridge seven-day moving average for confirmed cases per
100,000 residents is 277 cases per day, and our percent of
positivity is 6.37, as reported on January 6th.
However, this is the lowest positivity rate among the
top 20 largest communities in the Commonwealth in the 32nd
lowest amongst the 351 cities and towns in one of the lowest
of all other than the very small towns. For example, Boston
is at 16.5% and Somerville is at 9.99%. And as of today, the
seven-day average positivity for the Commonwealth is 22.39%.

As I mentioned during my last update, it is critical
for us to recognize the impact on vaccinations are having in
protecting people with serious illness and death. I am
pleased that our vaccination rate continues to increase and
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

now 89% of Cambridge residents have received at least one
dose of vaccine. 74% of residents are fully vaccinated and
38% have received a booster shot according to the state's
most recent reporting system.
It is great to see these percentages continuing to
grow. Our pandemic collaborative continues to conduct
vaccine and booster clinics. The city began COVID-19 booster
shots at the CambridgeSide on December 6th. The team has
administered more than 2,900 doses and hundreds have been
administered in clinics held at CRLS Fieldhouse. When the
people struggled to find appointments to get booster shots,
our vacs teams, which included Fire, Pro EMS, and Public
Health, responded quickly by establishing booster in vac
clinics.
Just as demand for vaccines have been high, our
residents have been taking advantage of our seven day a week
free PCR testing. We have seen significant increases
involvement and our crews have been responding, including
43
Packet Pg. 83

expanding hours when possible. I can't thank enough the
Cambridge Fire Department, Pro EMS for the incredible work
they have been doing running these City's test sites.
CambridgeSide has let us know, however, that
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

construction for the build out on the third floor of the
mall will be starting in the next few months. We currently
use this space for our testing and clinic. CambridgeSide is
working with the Fire Department team to find another space
at this location. We'll be reporting back to the Council as
soon as we finalize where this new testing location will be.
Our testing sites with the CIC Health has appointmentbased testing seven days a week and we'll be expanding hours
even further to allow our residents to get tested until
11:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 10:00 on Saturdays.
This site has provided another convenient option for
residents to get tested. I firmly believe no community is
doing more, providing fast free testing to its residents
than Cambridge.
Prior to Christmas holiday, distributed--the city
distributed over 21,000 at-home rapid antigen test kits or
43,000 tests to organizations servings, families living
below the poverty level, other vulnerable populations. I
44
Packet Pg. 84

1

want to thank the Affordable Housing providers, various
community partners, shelters serving our unhoused, and nonprofit service providers who assisted with these kits into
people's hands, especially during the holidays.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

The city provided multilingual instructions, as well as
best practices and tips, when and how to use the kits, and
set up webpage for people receiving the kits to get more
information. We continue to explore additional for targeted
distribution of rapid antigen test kits. Knowing that the
supply chain issues was going to have some concerns, the
City, prior to the end of the year, placed an ordering for
an additional 25,000 rapid antigen tests, which means 50,000
tests.
We'll provide the Council with an update on how these
kits will be allocated once the plan is finalized. The city
is also in the process of ordering high quality mask
distribution as needed. As you know, last week, the city
amended its mask ordinance, to include additional locations.
Now covered under the mask’s ordinance are common areas of
residential buildings with at least four units, such as any
lobby, hallway, elevator, stairway, laundry room, garage and
fitness center, gym spaces and common areas, and indoor
45
Packet Pg. 85

office and lab buildings in any lobby, hallway, elevator,
stairway, garage fitness center, or gym space.
This amended order will remain in place until February
27 or until such a time it is amended, extended, or
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

rescinded. Over the weekend, our sanitary and housing
inspectors went out to over 90 residential complex offices
and businesses with information sheets and signs to remind
them of the new mask ordinance.
As part of the rollout, the update mask mandate, we
have incorporated additional language in our siting
regarding vaccines provided info in both state and City
vaccine and booster clinics. These signs have been sent up
to our business community. We'll continue to distribute more
this week, and I want to thank the Inspectional Service
Department for the work they did over the weekend.
Last week, my staff were part of a discussion with the
Chamber of Commerce Business Associations and restaurants
and hotel representatives to discuss concerns and
opportunities that a vaccine requirement for indoor
restaurants, fitness centers, and event spaces could have on
Cambridge's businesses. I am proud of our collaborative
relationship, and we continue to have with our Small
46
Packet Pg. 86

1

Business Community throughout the pandemic.
From day one, our businesses have stepped up as Public
Health partners and they continue to do so now as they abide
by and help implement the City's expanded mandatory mask
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

system by participating in discussions residing the
importance of vaccines. As I stated during my last update,
and as we have seen in our metrics, Cambridge is different
than cities such as New York and Boston that are enacting
vaccine mandates.
Throughout this pandemic, we have prioritized education
and outreach over punitive enforcement. As such, I am not
committing Cambridge at this time to a vaccine mandate. My
time will continue--will continue to explore the potential
benefits and impact that such a plan would have on
Cambridge. We'll continue to prioritize outreach, education,
and the importance of vaccines and easy access to vaccine
and booster clinics.
As we all know, our restaurants and Small Business
Community are now in the middle of the second winter of
COVID. And with the timing of most of this recent surge,
restaurants have been specifically impacted financially. My
team continues to brainstorm with our Small Business
47
Packet Pg. 87

1

Community. Earlier today, we met specifically on
implementing a restaurant relief grant program using AIPA
funds.
I expect to have more information in the coming weeks,
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

including a plan for the implementation that we'll be
submitting to the Council. Our public safety, public health,
and community’s teams are participating regular conversation
with healthcare agencies, universities, to share information
with each other and ensure the best coordinated COVID-19
response effort.
In addition to temporary remote work during COVID-19
pandemic policy, this is available to City employees who
fall into one of the four categories specified in the
policy. I have authorized department heads to allow remote
work for employees who are able to complete tax offsite. The
purpose of this directive is to reduce daily staffing
density administrative offices to a minimum of 50% onsite
from today, Monday, January 9th, through February--through
January--Friday, January 28th.
Hours of operation for administrative buildings will,
uh, be unchanged and staffing will be maintained to meet
customer’s needs essential service programs in the demands
48
Packet Pg. 88

1

and requirements that we need. However, we know there may be
temporary periods when programs or services are impacted by
staff outages about COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 reasons.
Over the past week, the Central Square Library and the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

College Branch Library had had service impact. In some of
the Department, swimmer’s programs and classrooms have been
impacted by staff outages. Working with the Public Health
Department, we are conducting a vaccine status survey of
employees shortly, and we will be holding onsite employee
vaccination and booster clinics on January 12th and 13th.
As I said, I am not ready to put a vaccine mandate in
place for employees, and I am not going to fire employees
who may not have received a COVID vaccine. I am also not
going to put a mandate in place that does not have the deed
it needs to succeed. I believe we'll be more effective and
achieve better outcomes through more education and outreach,
and providing as many opportunities as possible for
employees to receive a vaccine or booster shot.
While City buildings remain open to the public for inperson services, I have asked departments to temporary halt
in-person City-sponsored events, planning events and
elective works halt through February 27th. Over the past 20
49
Packet Pg. 89

1

months, we have built our capacity for dealing with this
ever-evolving situation related to COVID-19 pandemic
response.
We continue to recommend that those eligible to receive
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COVID-19 vaccinations or booster shots do so. We encourage
people to adhere to the prevention practices that we have
learned over the past 20 months, including physical
distancing, hand-washing, mask-wearing when around people,
or [inaudible 2:40:23] household, to get tested if symptoms
or believe you're exposed to the virus, follow isolation and
quarantine guidance by the Cambridge Public Health
Department. And if you do not feel well, please stay home.
To help ensure our residents have the information they
need, on the Citywide COVID-19 mailer will be arriving in
the mailbox this week. Additionally, we have encouraged
everybody to activate MassNotify, a tool that works through
smartphones. MassNotify can alert users who may have been
exposed to COVID-19. You can enable MassNotify directly in
settings on your iPhone phone or Android phone.
We have the tools to help stop the spread of the virus
that cause COVID-19, and each of us have personal
responsibilities to do its part. We know that mandates in
50

small geographic areas like our community where people
coming and going from the city dearly can only do so much to
do the most impactful thing in broader region or statewide
approach to our interventions.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And as in my team have come throughout this pandemic,
we'll continue to take opportunities to look at larger scale
product. As a reminder, we put our timely information on our
website, provide access to data on the Data Center, and
share information daily with the community. This is in
addition to sharing information on social media and with the
Council on the Weekly Digest.
I strongly encourage residents to subscribe to the
daily email updates and keep current with the city vaccine
for updates. We continue to monitor data coming from the
Commonwealth, and we work with departments and the Public
Health professionals, business associations, and community
partners to ensure that we support and protect the health
and safety of our city. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over
to Derrick. Derrick?
DERRICK NEAL:

Thank you, Louis. If we can go to the,

uh, slide presentation. I'll move through this as, uh,
quickly as possible with, uh, providing the, uh, most
51
Packet Pg. 91

1

important, uh, points. Thank you. This is the Public Health
response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambridge. So, while
it's, uh, germane to the, uh, Cambridge residence, we are
looking at this also from a regional perspective.
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

First slide, please. You look at Middlesex County and,
uh, cases by risk category. As you can see, we've moved well
beyond having, uh, a curve. Uh, a year and a half ago, we
were talking about bending the curve. Our growth, uh, at
this point is, uh, exponential to the point where, uh,
we're--we're really looking at just, uh, significant growth.
Uh, we are at a point now, uh, that we haven't been in, in
Cambridge since the start of the pandemic, uh, back in the
beginning of 2020.
For the week ending Saturday, January 8th, there were
2,354 new confirmed Cambridge cases, which essentially
translates to a seven-day average of about 283.3 confirmed
cases per 100,000 residents. The Cambridge infection rates
have increased a staggering 1600% since Thanksgiving, and
weekly cases counts remain at record levels.
As you can see from the graph, Cambridge case rates
exceed those of Middlesex County, but we believe this is
largely due to better access to testing in Cambridge
52
Packet Pg. 92

1

compared to many other Middlesex County communities.
Essentially, what that means is that, uh, we have, uh,
significant resources with regards to the amount of testing,
uh, that we can provide in Cambridge because of the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

resources that we have.
Given the state's high positivity rate currently at
about 23% of PCR tests administered are positive, it is fair
to say that many infections in Massachusetts are going
undetected due to unmet demand for testing. In addition,
many residents are relying on home rapid antigen tests.
Positive results from these tests are not included in the
reported case numbers.
The bottom line is that we're currently seeing
uncontrolled spread of the virus in Cambridge and the state.
Whenever the Omicron surge peaks next week or next month,
from now, we will still need to be cautious until infection
rates go down to a safer level. Next slide. It's important
that we look at Cambridge cases, uh, by age as well.
We know the first population that we were aggressive
in--in--in inoculating, if you will, are providing supports
to, uh, where our older population because obviously they're
vulnerable. Here, you can see--here, here you can see how
53
Packet Pg. 93

1

infection rates skyrocketed in January among all age groups
in Cambridge, except for residents 65 and older. And I'll
explain, um, why we see that.
We see a real jump among children, especially young
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

teens, aged 12 to 15 years old. Cambridge is also
experiencing widespread transmission in childcare programs,
schools, workplaces, hospital workers, homeless shelters,
and long-term care facilities, simply because this is a more
communicable, uh, level of virus with regards to COVID-19.
Next slide, please. So, generally, our, uh, uh, Omicron
update is that the, the Mississippi, um, Mississippi, uh,
that's brought in--the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health/Broad Institute estimate that, uh, the Omicron
accounts for over 95% of, uh, Massachusetts cases. We didn't
have this information, um, last month, but we do know the
data is telling us that, uh, our, our level of
transmissibility is, uh, directly related to, uh, the new
variant that's here.
This January surge is being driven most exclusively by,
uh, the new variant, the Omicron variant. Based on analysis
from the Broad Institute, the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health estimates that as, as, as of January 1st,
54
Packet Pg. 94

1

Omicron accounted for over 95% of new infections in the
state. Last week, the state notified our department of 96
confirmed Omicron variant cases among Cambridge residents.
The test dates for these individuals were between
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

December 1st and December 22nd. Based on the state
estimates, we assume that Omicron accounts for nearly 100%
of the new Cambridge infections. A growing body of evidence
also suggests that Omicron is more transmissible, but causes
less severe illness than the Delta variant. This is gonna be
extremely important as we keep a close eye on the hospital,
uh, rate.
What we do know is that we don't have as many health
workers, uh, hospital staff to support those needs, uh, when
the hospital rate begins to, to go up. And we do know that
the hospital rate, as well as the, the death rate are
lagging indicators. So, they'll be coming, uh, along, uh, in
a few weeks with regards to the current surges that we see
right now, but we won't be absent of those, uh, numbers, um,
uh, from a NPI standpoint.
Vaccinations, especially with booster dose, is helping
prevent severe illness and deaths. While the proportion of
people infected with COVID-19 who require hospitalization is
55
Packet Pg. 95

1

lower with the Omicron than Delta, the sheer volume of
infections is challenging hospitals in Cambridge, the state,
and across the nation. Next slide, please. Let's talk a
little bit about the Massachusetts COVID-19
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

hospitalizations.
And as you can see, on January 6th, which just was a
few days ago, there were 2,637 patients hospitalized in
Massachusetts, uh, with COVID-19. Uh, as of last-- uh, I'm
sorry, we are hardened that COVID-19 death statewide remain
low compared to last winter. Uh, again, this is not, uh, the
current variant. We're not seeing the level of, uh, deaths
associated with that, as we saw with the, uh, previous, um,
uh, variant, which was the Delta variant.
A lot of that has to do with, uh, breakthrough
infections within individuals who've already been
vaccinated. Uh, they're just not, um, having the same level,
uh, in a lot of cases or in most cases of, uh, illness as,
uh, the first wave did who were unvaccinated. However, we
are concerned about the number of children in the hospital,
including youngsters, not old enough to be vaccinated.
During the last two weeks in December, there were 102
Massachusetts children under the age of 12, admitted to the
56
Packet Pg. 96

1

hospital for COVID-19. The hospitalization rate for this age
group is about five times what it was just a month ago. Next
slide, please. Community impacts. When we look at this, uh,
Cambridge's, uh, about six and a half square miles. So, from
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

a Public Health perspective, we always look at things from a
population health perspective.
So, while our policies may differ from those of our
neighbors, uh, we really have to look at this response from
a regional perspective. We have a lot of individuals
commuting in and out of our community every day, uh, as we
had, uh, uh, one individual said was, uh, speaking of during
the, uh, public comments. So, we have to be cognizant of
that as well from a population health perspective.
We are seeing the societal impact of Omicron on our
community, and here are just a few examples. Hospitals in
Cambridge and throughout the region are under enormous
strain right now. In addition to the rise in number of
COVID-19 patients, there have also been admissions of other
critically ill patients on top of existing staffing
shortages, which I mentioned earlier, as well as the
healthcare workers out sick with COVID.
We've had that issue even within the, uh, Public Health
57
Packet Pg. 97

1

Department, which has impacted our ability to deliver
services. In the Metro West region, which includes
Cambridge, 94% of nine ICU beds were occupied, and 80% of
ICU beds were occupied as of Thursday, January 6th. Now,
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

childcare programs, which are incredibly important, many
daycares and preschools in the Commonwealth are struggling
to stay open as large numbers of staff and children become
infected.
As the media has Wily reported, many, many school
districts are--many school districts are also faced with
unprecedented staff and students out with--out with COVID-19
and airline travel. We, we hear about this every day. Air
travel continues to be hampered by staff shortages related
to the Omicron variant. The New York Times reported that
about 5,000 flights nationwide were canceled this weekend
from Friday through Sunday, and we're talking about just
yesterday.
Next slide, please. Louis did a tremendous job of, uh,
really speaking on Cambridge's response to the, uh--to the
pandemic. Uh, we can't--we can't achieve and we can't
accomplish what we need to without our partners. I can tell
you that we've experienced significant turnover with our
58
Packet Pg. 98

1

staff. Without the help and support of our local partners,
inclusive of the City of Cambridge, uh, the Fire Department,
the Police Department, we can't--we aren't able to pull off
a lot of these, uh, mass clinics that we've been sustaining
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

for such a long period of time, as well as doing our regular
job.
So, again, I can't, uh, uh, convey my appreciation
enough, uh, for Louis, his, his, his leadership, and, uh,
that of the, uh, Fire, the Police Department, Public Works,
and I don't want to leave anybody out. So, I'll just say the
entire City of Cambridge for supporting this Public Health
response, which is extremely critical.
Uh, the government response. The government at all
levels are starting to take action to prevent widespread
worker shortages due to rapid spread of the, uh, Omicron
variant. The CDC has decided to shorten isolation and
quarantine periods in part to prevent disruption of the
workforce and keep essential sectors in operation. At the
state level, the Governor's office has activated the
National Guard to support hospitals and transport systems,
as these systems face workers--as these sectors face worker
shortages.

Here in Cambridge, we've been holding numerous vaccine
clinics, expanding PCR testing opportunities to seven days a
week at multiple locations, canceled in-person City public

recommendations, which I'll talk to you more about, uh, on
the next slide. The next slide, please.
The Cambridge Public Health Department recommendation
encourages employees--employers encourage, uh, remote work
where possible to protect your workforce. One of the things
that we did last week, uh, within the Public Health
Department is that, uh, we gave a directive, uh, to all of
our Public Health employees, uh, who are able to accomplish
their work-related duties from home to stay at home.
We want to make sure that we're not, uh, creating an
unsafe work environment for our own employees and really,
uh, modeling the, uh, appropriate behaviors that Health
Department should be modeling. But more importantly than
that, uh, we would like you guys, if at all possible, to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

events, as Louis mentioned, and issued public health

emulate some of the things that we're doing in such as
working from home, uh, whenever possible.
That's not always possible for every discipline, uh,
such as our nurses who have to interact with clients on a
60
Packet Pg. 100

1

day-to-day basis. But for those, uh, work--those work
disciplines or those positions that don't require, uh,
coming into the office every day, we highly recommend that

uh, keep us as safe as, uh, humanly possible.
Um, for workplaces where it is essential to come in, we
highly recommend high quality mask and for our staff and for
not--and for staff not to eat together, because we do know
that all masks aren't, uh, 100% effective. But we do know
mask combined with social distancing and, and, uh, employing
those other mitigation practices, uh, does keep you
relatively safe if you have to come into work to accomplish
your day-to-day job duties.
We're asking that residents, you know, and as a
resident, you need to think about yourself and your family,
but also you need to consider how your actions can impact
other people. We ask residents to consider curtailing
certain activities until we're in a better place to take

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

those individuals be able to work from home in order to, uh,

more precautions than you might have even a few months ago.
Again, we are in a phase where we have uncontrolled
spread. So as really the--this pandemic, as it's been
probably for the last year, is in the hands of our citizens.
61
Packet Pg. 101

1

At this point, Public Health, we can hand out
recommendations, we can make suggestions, uh, just like the
City of Cambridge is doing, just like those things that, uh,

But make no mistake about it, the response to this pandemic
is in the hands of our citizens who make informed decisions,
educated decisions are even the ones who make irresponsible
decisions.
Uh, and that's where we're at in this pandemic, and
that's what the numbers are reflecting, uh, really just, uh,
conscious, uh, decision-making amongst our residents. So,
the Cambridge Public Health Department, uh, recommends, uh,
you get vaccinated and subsequently you get boosted.
Omicron's rapid spread is to believe to be a combination of
increased transmissibility and the variance ability to evade
immunity from vaccination or prior infection.
Booster vaccines are expected to restore much of the
vaccine's protection against infection, as well as serious

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

our City Manager went over with earlier, uh, this evening.

illness. We're asking that you wear a high-quality mask.
Cloth masks do not provide an adequate level of protection.
High quality masks are especially important for individuals
who work directly with the public. If you invite guests into
62
Packet Pg. 102

1

your home, everyone should mask up. Reconsider indoor social
gatherings, it is best to avoid indoor settings where others
are on mask, as well as large gatherings.

if you have a known exposure to someone with COVID-19.
Follow isolation and quarantine guidance. The Cambridge
Public Health Department strongly recommends a negative
rapid test before ending isolation after five days. The next
slide, please. I wanna talk a little bit about the COVID-19
Vaccine clinic. Uh, Louis touched on this as well.
Um, Cambridge has significant resources with regards to
providing those supports that you need in order to, to
remain safe as an individual, but keep your family safe as
well. So, since December, the, the city has administered
2,906 doses of Moderna Vaccines and Boosters at the
Cambridge testing site. At last week's Pfizer clinic at
CRLS, Cambridge Public Health Department and Cambridge Fire
administered 292 COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Seek testing if, if you have symptoms of COVID-19, or

The City of Cambridge is hosting additional January
booster clinics at CambridgeSide Mall for individuals 18 and
older who live or work in Cambridge. These clinics will
offer Moderna vaccines. The Cambridge Public Health
63
Packet Pg. 103

1

Department will host vaccine clinics for City employees at
the Department of Public Works, City Hall, and the Water
Department. The Health Department is also holding shelter

later this week.
In addition to the city-run clinics, appointments can
be made for vaccines and boosters at several nearby
locations, including Finway Park in Boston, just across the
bridge, Cambridge Health Alliance, Somerville Vaccine
Center, CVS, Walgreens, um, and walk-ins are available at
Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Tufts is offering walk-in
appointments Monday through Friday from 8:00 to 5:00 PM. And
that concludes my presentation. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, we will start with

questions. Uh, I'll start in here, and then we'll go for
those on the Zoom. So, go ahead, Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

vaccination clinics at the Warming Center and at the YMCA

for the presentation. Um, I just wanna talk for a second
about, uh, testing. Um, you know, I know that we are doing
testing seven days a week, which is great. I know that we
are testing at higher rates, um, than many other
64
Packet Pg. 104

1

communities, also great.
Uh, I also know from personal experience, um, that some
of the waiting time in line to get tested can be over two

we may be better than other communities, but that doesn't
mean that it's great here either, right? It just means that
they may be worse off than us.
And I think, you know--and, and we have a policy order
on later about creating some priority times for seniors.
But, um, I really want to hear, and I've been asking about
this for a couple weeks now, um, you know, it's one thing,
the, the, the vaccination clinics, the booster clinics where
you're actually giving someone an injection. I, I, you know,
you have to be specially trained for that. That's a
different ballgame to some extent.
The testing sites, you don't need an EMT at a testing
site or a firefighter at a testing site. You walk in, we've
all done it. You walk in, someone puts your name into a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

hours, um, in the cold with kids, um, which is really not--

computer, they print out a little sticky, it goes on a vial,
you go stand in another line, someone hands you a Q-tip, you
swab your nose and you leave. You know, we've been hearing
that, well, part of the reason we don't have more testing
65
Packet Pg. 105

1

available is staffing issues.
If you offered $20 an hour to the general public to
start asking to hire people to do the testing that does not

more places and reduce the weight for people to get tested.
And I just--I have yet to see, despite weeks of asking for
this, a plan to be more creative in offering more testing to
get those lines down to something that is more manageable so
that people aren't waiting for hours.
Um, so I'm just gonna put it out there again, there may
be a--maybe I have to put it in a policy order to ask more
officially, but, you know, I've been talking about tents
outside on the street. Um, that's, that's not my idea. Other
cities are doing it. It's, it's not recreating the wheel.
Um, talking about, you know, we should--we should have
testing in all of our schools or at our libraries, or, you
know, we gotta get these lines down.
So, I just--I'm just making a plea to you again to come

require a specialty, we would be able to open more sites and

up with something more creative around testing so that
people aren't waiting for hours, especially now in the
bitter cold. Um, so I guess that's not really a question,
Madam Mayor. It's just a statement, but, uh, uh, I'm gonna
66
Packet Pg. 106

1

keep asking it until I see it. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
DERRICK NEAL:

Duly noted. Thank you.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor Nolan,

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, everyone, for

this presentation. Um, I will say in the future, it might be
helpful to understand and perhaps, uh, through you, Mayor
Siddiqui, to work to understand what would be the most
appropriate use of the time so that the presentation
presents us with, uh, all the information that, that we need
and, and, and fulfills the purpose, because sometimes I feel
like we are sitting through some information that, um, we
might have already, uh, seen.
I do have a question about masks, one of our favorite
topics. Uh, understanding that it is one of the ways in
which--one of the most effective ways to prevent, uh,
transmission, which is why we're all sitting here in this
room with these masks. What thought has been given to ensure

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and then Councillor Azeem.

that all the masks are available, that the new learning
about the fact that cloth masks are not as effective, that
even the surgical masks that are not, uh, tightly, uh,
controlled and provide a fit on your face are not as
67
Packet Pg. 107

1

effective?
How are we messaging that and how--is there a plan in
place to ensure that all, at least, City employees who are

I'm wearing? I got it through cambridgemasks.org. It's an
organization of parents who would just put out to allow
anybody to pay for it a highly discounted rate for the K94,
which have been tested and approved, um, and are, are of
higher quality than some of the, I believe, the KN95, which
come from, uh, countries that may not have the quality, uh,
um, manufacturer that we absolutely, desperately need to
ensure that the masks we wearing are, um, appropriate.
So, through you, Mayor Siddiqui, I think the, the
question is whether we can provide this kind of, of, uh,
KF94 or 95, the, the recommended masks to our city staff,
and to get the word out about that, not just that, that
people have to mask up, but to all the employees--employers
across the city, that if they're providing masks for their

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

in our, uh, working for the city have the kind of mask that

employees, that they really should not be cloth masks and
they should be of higher quality.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Mr. Manager?

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Yes, I can start,

68
Packet Pg. 108

1

and we can, uh, turn it over to anyone else. But, uh, David
Kale and Dan Rivero, a leading, uh, charge right now to
audit a high-quality mask for both City employees and for

have worked this weekend, especially to get the information
out that the Health Department's saying on what type of mask
people should try to be wearing.
So, we are hoping to get as many masks out as soon as
we can that in the test kits have open audit. But here's a
timetable on when they'll begin. I don't know if David or
Dan have an update on when we expect to be receiving some
additional masks and some additional tests. I know it
shortly. David, Dan, I'll leave.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
LEE GIANETTI:

Lee.

Uh, through you, Madam Mayor. Thank you.

So, we have placed an order for 75,000 KF94s. They are on
order, as you can imagine. Um, we're not immune to supply
chain issues, so we are working as quickly as possible, uh,

in relation to the, uh, rapid home test kits.

in. It's at this point out of our control, and as soon as
our supplier can have them, um, we'll have them here, and
then we'll come back to the Council with our distribution

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah. Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Glad to hear that. It's, it's obviously on all our
minds, and again, the more that we can role model that kind
of mask distribution, even if we're not necessarily paying
for it, but to make sure that everyone in the city knows
that that's the kind of mask they should be wearing, that'd
be great. For now, I'll, I'll yield, Mayor Siddiqui.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Azeem.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, thank you for the

update, Mr. Manager. Um, so I believe that Councillor
McGovern referenced this a little bit, uh, but in other
cities similar to New York, uh, they have set up tents in
corners where you can kind of walk by and get tested. Um, I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

plan for those

was wondering if there was any interest in setting up
testing tents in any of our squares.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

So, I'm gonna turn

that over to Lee. We've done some research in that.
70
Packet Pg. 110

1

Councillor Mallon had an order in, and, uh, Lee can give you
an update on the status of what we've found out so far. Lee.
LEE GIANETTI:

Sorry, Councillor, could you just repeat

your question,
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

I was, uh, wondering if we

were interested, um, to follow the steps of other cities in
setting up tents outside, possibly in our squares for
testing.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Lee, I mentioned

that Councillor --Vice Mayor Mallon had also put an order
in. We were looking into information working with the Health
Department, but you had an update.
LEE GIANETTI:

Yeah, we had, um, one company that we,

uh, reached out to that we received from Councillor Mallon,
um, that's doing rapid testing. Um, and I need to look up
the name, but they were not FDA approved at the moment, um,
so that they would not be a qualified one. And we have

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the question? My computer crackled, as you were, um, stating

talked with, um, Cambridge Fire, um, about outdoor testing.
It does present significant challenges. Um, we don't
have a solution yet. You can imagine on a day, like, uh,
tomorrow, outdoor testing is really, really challenging. And
71
Packet Pg. 111

1

even if you think of communities that have drive-through
testing, we don't have the space that a lot of other
communities do in terms of large parking lots and the

So, the Cambridge Fire team is, you know, looking at
all different options and, um, we're happy to report back at
a further one. But the, the outdoor testing is a very
challenging, um, sort of perspective right now. But we are
looking at, uh, what other options may be available in terms
of additional, uh, testing sites.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Azeem.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Got it. Thank you. Um, so I

had a second question. Um, I know that, uh, the testing
around the schools was a little bit hectic and parents were
waiting in long lines. I was wondering, um, we got in, uh,
one of the communications a message around possibly having,
uh, rapid testing or other sorts of testing, particularly
around the February vacation period for the students to make

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

logistics that go through it.

sure that people weren't waiting in long lines then. I was
wondering if you guys had any updates or any thoughts.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I guess I'll turn

that one over to the Mayor, if that's okay. Mayor Siddiqui.
72
Packet Pg. 112

1

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, thank you. And we have

Dr. Dobberteen and, uh, and others here as well. And yes, as
I allude to in my, I can get to the communication later, a

ordered, um, rapid tests. They just didn't come in time as
well, but we do--um, we're planning for February and, and
definitely, uh, I think even with the--there's a
conversation I've had with the Manager around even the ones
we're getting, um, getting--whoever's getting first, making
sure the schools, uh, will get them as soon as possible. But
definitely planning ahead for February break. Any follow
ups?
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I'm good. Thank you.
Councillor Toner, are you all

set?
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. The

only question I uh, had was, uh, for folks who have, uh, had
COVID, um, my understanding or like, I don’t know if this is

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

lot of lessons, you know, from last week, and we had

true, I'd love to get, uh, accurate information on this is
once you've had COVID, you may test positive for quite a
long time after that. Um, and what is that gonna do for
employees of the city? Or, uh, how, how can we identify
73
Packet Pg. 113

1

whether this is a oh, a false test, uh, going forward?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor. So, I guess I can start. Uh, we--Sheila Keady has

pretty closely on what we're asking for our employees. So,
uh, I'm probably gonna misquote this, but I don't know if
Sheila's on the line, but if you have tested positive, uh,
obviously you have to be off for five days.
If you have no symptoms and you feel you can't come
back, we are asking to do the house test kit, uh, because
the--from what we've heard from the Health, and Derrick, if
I'm wrong, please jump in, they have the best results for
someone who has been positive and now is going through the
test period, where if they have no symptoms, they may be
coming back--they could come back to work.
So, we have got a 10-day, uh, COVID time for all
employees who have any COVID experiences. They can be off
and it doesn't affect their sick time. One of the things we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

followed the guidelines working with the Health Department

wanted to make sure for our employees was when in doubt,
they're not gonna lose time for being out. So, we've put
that incentive in, but I think there's been guidelines that
we're following quickly through Sheila Keady in our
74
Packet Pg. 114

1

Personnel Department.
I don't know if Sheila's on the call, but we've worked
closely with Derrick and his team on those guidelines, and

know where you go after you get tested positive and what the
guidelines you should follow. Derrick, I don't know if you
want to jump in on that. Anything else?
DERRICK NEAL:

I'll jump in. And, uh, through you.

Madam Mayor, I'd like to, uh, bring, uh, Dr. Dobberteen on
so she can, uh, chime in on this, uh, issue. We were talking
about that this morning. Dr. Dobberteen, are you available?
LISA DOBBERTEEN, MD:

Yes, indeed. Uh, through you,

Madam Mayor, thank you, City Manager. Thank you, our Chief
Public Health Officer. Um, once a person has tested
positive, uh, they will continue to--they often continue to
test positive on a PCR test for up to 90 days. The rapid-the benefit of a rapid antigen test is that it's most likely
to identify someone who is infectious, whether that's newly

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we recently sent them out to all City employees on how to

infectious or still infectious from an active infection.
So, we're very much in support of the recommendation to
have employees test at day five before returning from an
isolation period from--for COVID. And we're asked--we're
75
Packet Pg. 115

1

recommending that if people have access to a rapid test to
test on day five before they resume their normal activities,
providing that they're symptom free. But, uh, that's an

going on, and, uh, we would be very much in support of that
plan.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I'm trying anyways.

Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Toner. We'll now

move to Councillor Simmons, followed by Vice Mayor Mallon.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you. Uh,

through the Chair, uh, to the Chief Public Health officer,
uh, just recently, uh, the seniors--Senior Advisory met and
there were a number of questions that came up, and I just
wanna sort of go through them very quickly. Uh, it's, it's
about lines. And we did talk about this just a little bit.
Uh, I think I heard a number of my--a colleague or two to
mention it from the floor.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

excellent, uh, description, City Manager, of what, what's

But what seemed to be, um, an issue or concern from the
Senior's perspective or where they're following, they wanted
to know, um, did we have an idea of how many rapid test kits
Cambridge was going to have? Were--does--do seniors have
76
Packet Pg. 116

1

access to those kits?
And, uh, I do have a policy order or maybe a cosponsored order that speaks to this about the location for

will there be kids that will be readily available for
distributions, but not to school-aged kids, which I know are
important, but to the senior population who are very
concerned about accessibility because it's not always easy
for our senior population to get out. So, I would just like
to offer those, uh, through the Chair to our Chief Public
Health Officers for his comment.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
DERRICK NEAL:

Mr. Neal.

Yes, sir. Through you, Madam Mayor, um,

we're working closely with the City of Cambridge in
developing a prioritized system for distributing the, uh,
test kits. Um, it's a --as, uh, Louis mentioned earlier, uh,
it's 25,000 tests, which, uh, roughly equate to, uh, I think
two per unit, which is around 50,000 tests. But we are

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

seniors, separate dates and locations for seniors, and, um,

prioritizing those, uh, based on a matrix that we've been
following in terms of the prioritized population that we
provided vaccines to as well. So, we don't have an
unlimited, unlimited number of tests, and we are
77
Packet Pg. 117

1

prioritizing those amongst our most marginalized populations
in Cambridge,
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, through the Chair,

of their issues around mobility, transportation, access. So,
I know in the first leg of the COVID, we worked with the CHA
to go and test, and then to inoculate. That does--that's
very helpful because it does reach a, a group of seniors,
but there are seniors that are living gratefully, so
independently, and--but they do have those access issues.
They may just not--they may not have access to a car or
there's just so many impediments. Some, some of the testing,
not all, but some of the testing requires sign up in
advance. And so, we're just trying to-- they're concerned
and I'm trying to ask on their behalf, uh, how do we make it
easy for them? And so, for me, uh, I, I do appreciate the
fact that you're saying we're, we're, we're, um, looking at
marginalized groups, which brings-- will go to my next

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

um, so seniors particularly are feeling marginalized because

question, but I--but specifically to the senior population,
I'm just looking at how we can make it easier for that
population to have access to testing. Now these are folks
that have been-78

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons?

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

--isolated for a very

long time, so.
Councillor Simmons, would you

like to suspend the rules to bring that policy order forward
so we can talk specifically about it?
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Absolutely. I would move

suspension to bring--I don't have the number of the policy
order from me.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, it's policy order one. And

we can do a roll call to have it before us, because it's-we're talking about it and it's not before us, so we
procedurally, let's just have it before us. So, let's do a
roll call.

Councillor Paul F. Toner - Yes
Councillor Quinton Y. Zondervan – Yes
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui - Yes

And the policy order is before the full Council.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And this is the policy order

from Councillor Simmons that she's alluding to, its sponsor
by Councillor Toner. And it's specifically, uh, asked
request, uh, the City Manager to work with the Chief Public
health Officer, Cambridge Health Alliance, and other
relevance to the staff to create a priority line and/or
establish senior hours at the City's COVID-19 testing
locations. Councillor Simmons,
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you. Through

the Chair to the Chief, part of the reason for that
particular Council order was because of the Senior Advisory
saying, and as you probably know, particularly at the
CambridgeSide Galleria, today being the exception, the lines

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Yes - 9, No - 0. Motion Passed.

were very, very, very long.
DERRICK NEAL:

Yeah.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

There's no priority

line, there's no disability. Uh, you know, I have a family
80
Packet Pg. 120

1

member that could not stand in the line for more than 15
minutes. That means if there's no access to a rapid test,
she's just not gonna go. And, and that's problematic. And

easier, particularly for seniors and for those with mobility
issues, to be able to--if they show up at the CambridgeSide
Galleria, in particular, that they won't have to be in a
really long line and end up moving.
DERRICK NEAL:

I totally understand and I'm in

agreement. And I also think we need to also strategize with
those individuals who may be homebound but yet exposed, and
address their needs as well. So, we're gonna have to drill
down in a more specific manner in order to provide the
necessary outreach to those populations, but something I'm
certainly looking forward to working with, um, City
management staff on.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor, if I could also jump in, it's-MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

so, what this order's trying to say is we want to make it

Yes, I was gonna ask

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Because, uh, today,

uh, as, as Derrick stated, the 50,000 tests we gave out and
we distributed them, and obviously, the Housing Authority
81
Packet Pg. 121

1

was one, and the Senior Center was one. But I was with Mr.
Gianetti, and we were discussing what are we gonna do with
our next 50,000 tests. And we're getting ready to have that

But one of the things that Lee and Dan Rivero both
mentioned were seniors who are not in housing buildings, or
seniors who are homebound, how can we make sure that we have
a system that when this next batch comes in, we can reach to
them? So, we're gonna have a discussion soon, probably this
week with Derrick to talk about what is the population that
probably we missed with this 50,000 that we, you know, we
had a real targeted population, and how do we get that group
to, especially now with this next bit get it.
So, it's a great question. We don't have all the
answers yet, but we're on the same page. It's something that
we gotta make sure we can do. And I also think we need to
have a city site as well, a direct City site for seniors,
and for some Cambridge residents that could come in. So,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

discussion with the Health Department.

we're gonna kinda--again, I think the places we gave them to
were the right places and they've done a great job
distributing, but we also now have to think out of the box
well to figure out what other places we should distribute
82
Packet Pg. 122

1

them.
The problem here is 50,000 tests sound like a lot,
another 50 sound like a lot, but it goes pretty quickly. So,

them. So, we're on the same page. We don't have all the
answers yet, but it was about an hour discussion we had
today on exactly what you're talking about, Councillor. So,
thank you.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:
DERRICK NEAL:

Thank you, City Manager.

Yeah, and I also--I also appreciate my

staff holding me accountable. Uh, out of those 40,000 tests
that we received from the state, uh, between 5,000 and 8,000
indeed were--went to, uh, senior, uh, folks that, that
reside in Senior Housing in Cambridge. So, I just wanted to
point that out.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you. And, and,

um, through you to the Chief, and to the City Manager,
that's important. And we were very good for our relationship

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we just wanna make sure that everyone who needs to can get

with the CHA to get out to those seniors, but that is one
set of seniors. We have seniors, thousands of seniors that
still live independently or with a family member that we're
not gonna naturally pick up.
83
Packet Pg. 123

1

So, what I'm looking for, particularly as we head into
February vacation, because when there's a vacation or
holiday, the test numbers go up, so the lines are longer. So

groups or groups that are not as able to get access, it's
important for me to see as soon as possible so I can go back
to my advisors and, and that we can put out some sort of
notice to, uh, our, our senior population that hears this
availability, whether it be the Senior Centers, uh, as a
dropping place that is someplace that is identified as a
senior spot, or when they go to the CambridgeSide Galleria,
there's another line for seniors and those with impediments,
so they're not waiting in lines. Uh, it's very worse that
are two and three hours long.
So, I, I will--I'll leave that. I hope this, this
policy order will be adopted. The only other thing, uh,
through you--through the Chair to the Chief that you
mentioned about marginalized communities, we see our numbers

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

for me, it just--and if we're speaking about marginalized

going up. We see that the community of color still, still
exist and remains the hardest impacted. We had a site
specifically focusing on those populations.
I'm not looking at the list right now, so I don't know,
84
Packet Pg. 124

1

uh, may be a better question for the City Manager, because,
Chief, you may not know all the sites that well yet, but the
St. Paul's Christian Life Center was in the Port. I had

but that was there because we wanted to make it easy for
members of the community that was hard--was hit by this
virus. And I just wanna know that site's back online or
soon--how soon will it be back online given the increase in
the numbers? And again, that might be an easier question for
the City Manager because he knows the locations.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I wouldn't say it's

an easier question, but I'll, I'll give it a try.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

But you know the

location.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Uh, we--our

intention was to open up that site, uh, and we, we were
gonna have CIC, uh, take over and run a site out of that
location. Uh, it was determined in working with CIC that for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

preferred the Pasado Center. That's still my, my preference,

now, they wanted to keep their site at their location in
Kendall Square. So, we wanted to get the seven-day a week
testing with them. Uh, so that did not give us a group to go
to St. Paul's.
85
Packet Pg. 125

1

The problem right now is between the Health Department,
the Fire Department, and Pro EMS. We really don't have the
staff to address St. Paul's and we're trying to figure out

uh, but we're also hoping that maybe we can get CIC to see
if they could expand into another site rather than just the
headquarters.
It was my intent to have that up and running, I'll be
honest with you, probably two, three weeks ago. But we've
had, uh, some issues with, you know, who was gonna go there,
to be very honest. So, we are still in discussion and
hopefully we can get there. But I do wanna thank CIC though,
even though they haven't been able to go to that site, the
hours in the work they have allowed us to expand testing at
their own site has been exceptional.
And, uh, we're also thinking about what you said,
Councillor, about seniors. We may be able to do where it's
appointment only a senior day or a senior appointment day

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

how we can make that happen. So, we've had that discussion,

with which might be helpful where there would be no line.
But we haven't ruled St. Paul's out, but we haven't found
the solution yet. So, we will continue to try, though.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons.
86
Packet Pg. 126

1

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you. I was

strongly encouraged to, to get that senior site up and
running quicker--quickly, please, because I--we get a number

seniors mostly. To specifically to the CIC, if it moves to
St. Paul's, the one problem with the CIC is by appointment
only. You have to register and you have to do that by
computer. That's a huge impediment for seniors, a huge
impediment. So, CIC is the one that's going and they're
gonna require testing that may not solve our problem.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I, I, I would agree.

And that's why if we get them to go to, it would not be by
appointment.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Okay.

Mallon, and then Councillor Zondervan, and then Councillor
Carlone.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Councillor Azeem said and hope that we're prioritizing
whatever rapid tests next come into the city or the schools
for February vacation. I think what we saw last week, um,
necessitates a different plan and, um, a proactive one that
we're thinking about right now.
Uh, my question, I have two questions. One is around
the increased testing hour sites, testing site hours, that,
um, I only see online that they are extending the hours
through January 13th. And I had thought that we were doing
it through the end of January. I got to CambridgeSide
Galleria today at 1:30 for their extended site, um, hours, a
half hour before it was open, and I waited an hour in line.
So, there's still really a demand for testing. Are we
extending the testing hours through the end of this month?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Through you, um, I would like to, uh, piggyback on what

Uh, Lee has the

hours. I'm not sure what the new schedule is. I know we have
expanded at CIC. I thought we were doing some additional--I
do notice there's issues with staffing, but I thought we had
88
Packet Pg. 128

1

done put some additional hours. But, Lee, do you have the
exact times on where we're going with this?
LEE GIANETTI:

Uh, the times are available, um, through

with the teams to extend them on a week-by-week basis,
mainly because they're trying to figure out the staffing,
uh, to make sure that we have enough staffing to do it. So
as demand still warrants, uh, the teams are looking at how
they can continue to, um, keep their hours expanded.
So, they've been sort of doing it on a week-to-week
basis with the goal as long as the demand is staying up and
we have the staffing capacity that they will work to, um,
extend the hours. And the crews really have been fantastic
of, you know, even on the back end, staying as long anyone
that's in line to make sure that they're, um, getting
tested.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Uh, thank you. And I will

just go back to what Councillor McGovern said is that, you

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

you, Madam Mayor, to the Vice Mayor. Um, we've been working

know, however we can staff these, these testing sites, it
doesn't need to be an EMT, it doesn't need to be a
firefighter. Um, we do know that the next month, the next
month and a half are going to be very challenging around
89
Packet Pg. 129

1

testing and needing testing.
So, whatever we can do to provide that additional
staffing to ensure that we have that extended testing hours,

Manager, uh, through you Madam Mayor, we talked about a, a
couple of different solutions, uh, last week, late last week
that the Cambridge Public Health Department was considering.
And one of them was something that I brought up, um, a
couple of weeks ago in December, a grab-and-go PCR option
like Washington DC is doing, like Harvard and MIT have been
doing right on campus DC. You just go in, you grab a bag and
it has all the PCR, you know, the swab, everything. You do
it yourself, you put it back in the bag, you drop it off by
the library at eight o'clock, it goes out to the Broad, and
it comes back the next day.
Just going back to this idea of, you know, increasing
and expanding testing without increasing our staffing
levels. I think we talked about last week that the Cambridge

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I think is critical. And then the second thing is, um, Mr.

Public Health Department was looking into this with Harvard
and MIT and how they were doing it and how we could, uh,
possibly do it here in Cambridge. Do you have an update on
that?

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I think we hit some

roadblocks, to be very honest, in talking to Mr. Gianetti. I
don't know if Lee wants to jump in, or if Derrick wants to

VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

And just to be clear, Mr.

Manager, these aren't rapid tests. These are PCR tests.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Yeah, I thought we

had some concerns about locations, but again, I will leave
it up to them. I know they brought something to my attention
recently, but I've been in and out this week. So, Lee.
LEE GIANETTI:

Through you, Madam Mayor, um, to the

Manager. I, I think Anna's been really, and Public Health
has been the lead on this, so I'll, I'll let them, um, grab
this one.
DERRICK NEAL:

Right. I was gonna throw it over to, uh,

Anna, Anna Kaplan.
ANNA KAPLAN:

Um, good evening, everyone. Through you,

Madam Mayor, uh, yes, we are in progress, um, working on

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

jump in, but I thought--

scheduling a meeting with the vendor who could provide this,
who provides it for Harvard. Um, you know, like all, uh,
industry related to COVID, there are staffing and, uh,
challenges in getting things moving with supply chain. But,
91
Packet Pg. 131

1

um, that process is, uh, beginning and we'll be working
closely with the City Manager's Office to explore that.
Um, and I would add, uh, I know that this is in place

community testing through their drop-off program. So, it's
certainly been implemented elsewhere in the state. And, um,
it's just a service that's in high demand. So, we'll, we'll
continue to update as we work on that.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, if I can ask Ms. Kaplan a follow up question.
Does UMass provide the service through UMass, so Harvard or
MIT could potentially provide an expanded service to--for
Cambridge residents?
ANNA KAPLAN:

Um, that would--they do a UMass for the

surrounding area. Um, I know that the vendor we're speaking
to works with Harvard as well. I'm not sure if that's--I
haven't spoken to the universities about this, just as an
example of, of how the process works in other cities. Um,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

at, at UMass Amherst. They do provide for their surrounding

but we would work with the same vendor who provides for
Harvard.

VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you very much. And

We have City Manager agenda

Funding Program through the US Department of Justice, Bureau
of Justice Assistance to the Grant Fund Police Department,
other ordinary maintenance account, which will support the
purchase of protective equipment and supplies, such as mask,
gloves, protective overall, sanitizer, and face shields.
Councillor Zondervan, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. I just have a quick question on this
appropriation. Are these materials, uh, specifically for use
by the Cambridge Police Department, uh, personnel itself? Or
is this a pass through where they would be distributing some
of these materials, uh, to other, um, providers in the city?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

have supplied it throughout the community in our, our, uh,
Senior Housing, uh, when we--when we did food distribution,

so to our students. So, this was for everybody. And we are
doing another appropriation that we will have in by the end
of the month. But this is for--it's for everybody. And it

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

And, and, and

Councillor, one of the things, through you, Madam Mayor,
that we've talked about with additional masks, especially to
take a look at the institutions that are working with our
unhoused community, uh, they clearly need more masks and
we're trying to figure out how we can get them more masks
sooner than later, to be very honest. But we talked about
that today. So, I think if we can do something quickly with
that, we'll be doing something with that as well.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Great. Thank you.

Through you, Madam Mayor to the Manager, you anticipated my
question because it's exactly where I was going. Um, we had-we had a shortage and acute shortage of the YMCA just, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

has been.

last week. So, so thank you for looking into that. Um, my,
my second question is, is really about, uh, vaccine mandates
and, and rapid testing.
And, you know, I'm glad to see that the city is, uh,
96
Packet Pg. 136

1

ordering more rapid tests and, and that we're incorporating
that into our Public Health response because that's really
important. It's, particularly as Dr. Dobberteen explained,

infectious in the--in the moment, which can really help us
disrupt the pandemic. And the Governor just, uh, today
announced the new Vaccine Passport system. I just quickly
wanted to show people. I don't know if you can see that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We can. It's okay.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

I downloaded it today

and, and was able to bring up my vaccination passport with,
with a few clicks. So--and there's an app that's, um,
available for restaurants and other vendors so that they can
quickly verify the vaccine, uh, passport through a--through
a scanner.
So, um, this technology's becoming quickly available
and I understand some of the concerns about mandating it,
but even if we don't mandate it, it, it might be helpful for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that really allows us to team whether an individual is, is

us to provide some guidance to the local businesses for how
they can implement their own vaccine requirements, as well
as, um, onsite rapid testing. Because ultimately,
unfortunately, again, as was explained earlier, just being
97
Packet Pg. 137

1

vaccinated doesn't fully, uh, disrupt transmission. So, it's
important to, to add some rapid testing to that. Um, but
again, thank you for, uh, for all your work.
Thank you. And,

Councillor, we are talking to some of the restaurants that
are looking into that and how we can help them get the
information on how they can put something in place that
would work. So, I--we're in agreement with that. Absolutely.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Great. Thank you so

much. And, and also, you know, with the rapid test, again,
like the masks, we can make sure those get out to the
congregate facilities and shelters.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Yes.
That'll be great.

Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Uh, I'll be relatively quick. Uh, it's more of--as

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

opposed to a question, it's more of an observation and a
recommendation. In the past on the City's websites, that had
key numbers, deaths, infections, but also had percentage of
infections. And I noticed in the last few weeks, uh, that
98
Packet Pg. 138

1

the last statistic is not on the website. You have to go
into the website.
And quite frankly, it took me a little bit of time to

really important number and, you know, maybe you have next
to it statewide or greater boss than the show that we're
constantly at near the bottom. But I almost felt--and I, I
don't think we're doing this, but I almost felt like, oh,
we're hiding that now. I know that's not the case, but I
just think we should show it on, on the first indication of
what the present numbers are.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor. Lee, is that us? I wanna know it gotta to show it, to
be honest.
LEE GIANETTI:

Through you, Madam Mayor, to the--to

Councillor Carlone. I'm not sure I completely understand. We
haven't made any changes to what we're showing on the front
face of the website. The vaccine card--I mean, our status

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

find where it was. And it, it just seems to me that that's a

cards is remaining the same. The only thing that has
changed, and Anna may be able to talk about this, is active
cases, recoveries. There is a change at the state in terms
of how we're getting data. So, I don't know if those are the
99
Packet Pg. 139

1

numbers that you're, uh, talking about, but Anna would be
able to give you a description on that.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

I'm happy to follow up,

ago and I didn't notice it, but, uh, the percentage was
front and center. It's not anymore. And you really have to
explore to come across it. And all I'm saying is, to me,
that's probably the most important statistic, um, and we
want people to know that indeed it's even increasing in
Cambridge. So that's all I'm saying on that.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor, can I have Lee take a look, Councillor? And if we-COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Yeah. Yeah.

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

-- call them off, we

can-- if it makes sense what you're saying, then we can try
to figure out what happened.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Yeah, and that's why I

brought it up, because I know it's something that we want to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

but it has changed. And now it might have changed a month

do.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Exactly.

And the other question,

comment is, if we're not, not having meetings at City Hall
100
Packet Pg. 140

1

or not having public gatherings, however you worded it, Mr.
Manager, um, is--are we going to primarily have our meetings
over Zoom? I'm thinking of, you know, where all have been

committee meetings, and um, and I think it's fine if it's
over Zoom, but I'm assuming that's part of your comment that
we shouldn't have public gatherings. I think you said to the
middle of February, but I'm not sure.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

We are trying to

hold as many meetings, through you, Madam Mayor, through
Zoom as possible again, certainly through the end of
January. Uh, you know, uh, the City Council is exempt this
meeting exactly, but it would be our recommendation if we
can hold meetings back in Zoom. It's a better way to go at
this point in time.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Okay. Thank you for

clarifying that.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you.

assigned committees now, so each of us are planning

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I'm done. And Mr. Neal, I hope the winter is treating you
well and you're not thinking of warmer climes. Take care.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, Councillor Nolan had a-101
Packet Pg. 141

1

DERRICK NEAL:

Thank you.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

--had only asked one question,

so go ahead Councillor Nolan with your second question.
Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Yes, I--my second question is, uh, back to
something else. We've talked a lot about testing, which of
course is critical, but we haven't talked as much about the
other incredibly important way to prevent transmission and
to prevent serious disease, which is vaccination and
boosters.
And I know we have a very high level of, um,
vaccination, uh, full dose and, uh, primary dose, um, around
the--what the state is like 85% first dose, about 70 some
percent second. However, our booster rates are pretty low.
And there's certainly what I've read is the evidence is that
having a booster shot dramatically increases your, uh,
antibodies and dramatically increases the likelihood that if
you do--that you won't get the omicron. And if you do get

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

it, it will be mild.
So, I'm curious as to what are we doing to encourage
through the city folks who have not been boosted or those,
uh, that small minority who, uh, who haven't even gotten,
102
Packet Pg. 142

1

uh, the vaccination shot. And I'm particularly, uh, aware of
the fact that at the high school, there's a significant
percentage from the numbers that we've seen, which may not

shockingly low percentage of our high school students who
are not fully vaccinated, and certainly, the boosters are
ones that if we only have about 30 some percent of the city
boosted, and that means that, uh, those skyrocketing number
of cases are just gonna continue if we don't do that. So,
I'm curious as to what we're doing to encourage it very
strongly to get the word out to continue with the multilanguage, uh, outreach to ensure that people understand the
importance of getting those shots in arms.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor, it's a great question. I think, Lee, I think we work-I know we're working with Public Health. One of the things
that we have really stressed is we've gotta get the message
out. And I know we've got some literature going out, and Lee

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

be complete due to, uh, different data sources, but a

can talk about that. But you're right, we've gotta--we're
happy if we're at 89%, but we gotta get higher, and we need
to get more people boosted.
So, we're not satisfied at the numbers we're at, and
103
Packet Pg. 143

1

we're constantly working with Public Health, and Lee to
figure out how we can do more outreach. And it's really been
a successful team effort, I believe, on both sides. But Lee,

Public Health on this.
LEE GIANETTI:

Through you, Madam Mayor, we have a

mailer that's hitting all households, um, this week, which
is talking about what people can do to, um, stay safe, but
also, you know, about getting their vaccine, getting their
booster, uh, about wearing their mask as much as possible,
also talking about wearing high quality masks and that not
all mass are created the same, um, really reemphasizing that
people want to carefully consider the social gatherings that
they're going through, and you know, what folks should be
doing to, um, get tested if they have, um, symptoms. And
also following the guidance of Public Health, if there's
isolation and quarantine.
Uh, we work closely with the Public Health's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I know we just, I think, sent out a mailing working with

communications team to put information out in the daily
email. Um, the mailer that we have has also been turned into
a multilingual flyer. Uh, and there's multilingual resources
that went out that we're distributing from the library.

Packet Pg. 144

1

We're getting it over to the CET, we have it up on the
website, and we'll be, um, getting it over to community
partners.

information, um, out to folks. You know, I'm sure, as you
know, throughout the pandemic, one of our biggest
challenges, the moment you get something made, the
information is either outdated or rapidly changing. So, um,
we've sort of got a system down that we're trying to move
faster and then as things change, we'll update it.
But we are looking at every avenue that we can to, um,
try to get the information out to people to emphasize
getting a vaccine, getting your booster is really important.
And that goes, um, hand in glove with the clinics that
Public Health and Fire are doing to make sure that we not
only tell people to go and receive them, that people have
access to actually get appointments, uh, and for them to be
able to go and easily get one of the, um, vaccines or

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So, we're looking for new ways of getting the

boosters.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan?

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes. Thank you. Because

it is critically important only--according to our data, 38%

have been boosted and it dramatically changes the likelihood
of new cases and as I said at the high school and other
levels. So, thanks so much for your work. Let's continue it.

in arms, whether it's a booster shot or other shot, doesn't
change. Thanks so much. Let's keep it up, or do better.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, I think we've gone around

the Council, I have two quick, uh, follow ups. City Manager,
could you--do you know, uh, the basis of the, the status of
the survey to employees, um, around? I know we've asked
about how many staff are vaccinated. Do you have that
information?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Uh, we have not done

the survey yet. We're working with Public Health. I know
we're getting close. Uh, it's gonna come from Public Health.
I don't know if Lee can give a quick update of that. I've
not had a discussion, to be honest, in about a week. Lee.
LEE GIANETTI:

Sure. Through you, Madam Mayor,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Things change, but you know what, the message of get shots

Personnel Department has been working closely with, um, Anna
and the Public Health team. They have a HIPAA compliant, um,
uh, survey tool that we will be using. And, um, the
Personnel Director earlier today, um, thought we'd have it
106
Packet Pg. 146

1

out by, um, the end of this week. So that, that has been an
active development.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. I look forward to that

uh, booster clinics at--in North Cambridge, specifically at
the, uh, Ridge Tower, so I appreciate that. Um, the second
question was around, I, I know we had talked, uh, also in
December around some follow up, uh, conversations with the
COVID-19 Advisory Panel around, you know, variants.
I think this is not gonna be the only variant we have,
and I think as just things, you know, even after the surge
get better, um, just thinking through with them some of the-these big overarching questions that the Council is getting
of, you know, what's life look like, uh, you know, with no
mask? You know, when do things get back to normal? Just I do
think it'd be important to get, um, some, some of that group
together if you haven't done so already.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I don't disagree,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

update. Uh, and I know that, uh, Public Health is planning,

through you, Madam Mayor, and I will talk to Derrick, uh,
this week again, but I gotta be honest, that has--that was
not a priority, uh, I just felt to the crack, so--but I'll
talk with Derrick and get that thing rolling. Sorry.
107
Packet Pg. 147

1

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

No, I understand. I think

there's a lot of some pressing matters. Um, I just wanted to
also acknowledge the, the Cambridge Public Health team, uh,

others, our school nurses. It's been difficult and hard, and
there's been a lot of, um, work that's been done around the
clock, uh, through New Year's Eves, through New Year's,
through, through probably every hour the last, um, the last
few weeks.
So, I just did really wanna acknowledge that, that
work. I've seen it, and, um, I know it's been really
difficult too. So just really wanna appreciate you all. And
lastly, I'll say I am--I think given the booster rate and
given what I'm seeing with the high schoolers, something
that I--we did, uh, hear about and did some research on, was
that there are these incentive programs that cities and
states across the country and, you know, Massachusetts did a
little bit of it, but, you know, I have an example of City

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Anna and Dr. Dobberteen and Shamshera, and Tracy, and many

of Chicago offering $100 gift cards for high school students
to get shots, right?
There's all these in incentives that I think, you know,
is there any way we can get some of these rates up I think
108
Packet Pg. 148

1

we should consider? Uh, you know, New York has done, you
know, a prepaid debit card and tickets to City attractions,

these things that are coming up, um, because they're seeing-you know, they're seeing these kind of--these rates that
they're in. And I think with our booster shots, I do think
we have some kind of potential.
So, something to consider, I will pass on that research
and the models that these different cities across the
country really have utilized. And, uh, I think it's
something that, especially at the high school, um, could,
could work. Uh, and so I'll stop there, but, uh, again, I
appreciate the, the many hours folks have been working
around the clock and look forward to some updates in the
next few weeks from your end on rapid tests and other
issues.
Any other questions before we move on? So, we have a

few things to do. We will go ahead and place this
communication on file. We'll also do a roll call on the
appropriation, uh, from City Manager agenda item number two,
and then third, we'll pass and adopt Councillor Simmons' and

Councillor Toner's Policy Order #1 that we also discussed.

The Calendar, we have two charter written items, Number 1

City Clerk Anthony Wilson called the roll:

Zondervan. We'll go to Councillor Zondervan. I will say that
as a Council, there are amendments that were submitted
earlier to the Clerk that the Clerk will pull up. There are
also then amendments to the amendments. So, uh, we'll have

the Clerk, um, pull all that up. But because Councillor
Zondervan exercised the charter right, we'll go to Charter
Right Number 1 right now. Go ahead, Councillor Zondervan.
Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Can we suspend the rules to do them together?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

On suspension, we'll do a roll

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

1 and 2 are before us.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

111
Packet Pg. 151

1

Mayor. Through you, I did, uh, have an opportunity to speak
with the City Manager with, uh, Joe Barr, the Head of
Traffic with bicycle safety advocates, transit advocates,

particular, the City Manager and Joe Barr had significant
concerns about the original policy orders and potential
delays that they might cause, uh, to the implementation of
the Bike Safety Ordinance.
Um, so, they're of course, um, proposing and
considering different tweaks to the implementation to
address some of the concerns they've heard, as well as
working on outreach. And we did, the Council did already
unanimously pass an order in December asking for the
standardized process for outreach.
So, it's a little bit, uh, premature, I think, for us
to be micromanaging that process when we haven't heard back
from the Manager yet. Um, I am aware that we have some
amendments to consider, so I'll, um, wait here and stop here

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and representatives of the business community. And in

and, and we can go through those. But if they come too close
to the original orders, then I would not be supportive.
Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, we have--there are some
112
Packet Pg. 152

1

amendments that the Council did submit, and the first pair
of the amendments are submitted by Vice Mayor Mallon,
Councillor McGovern, and myself, uh, after conversations

Safety Advocates, and as well as, uh, business owners and
Denise Jillson, who, uh, organized a group who I think has
separately met with many members of the Council. So, I'll go
to Vice Mayor Mallon to introduce the amendments.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

So, Councillor McGovern, the Mayor, and myself, offer these
amendments to Calendar item Number 1. We believe to
strengthen the order, as well as to acknowledge that, that
we recently passed an order that Councillor Toomey offered
on December 6th that Councillor Zondervan just mentioned.
To address those future bike claim implementations,
both asking for standardized process for community
engagement and a robust follow up with stakeholders to
ensure an iterative and responsive post-implementation

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

with, uh, various advocates, the, the Cambridge Biker School

strategy, we agree, um, that there should be an advisory
board, but we also acknowledge that there are many, many
boards and commissions in the City already made up of expert
stakeholders that have already opted to give up their time
113
Packet Pg. 153

1

to in service to this City.
And we would expect that this PO--sorry, that could be
called in to serve in this advisory way and provide valuable

to plan and implement future segments of the bike lanes. The
City Manager was already planning to deliver a report back
to the City Council on that policy order on January 31st.
And we would expect that this PO should it be, uh, accepted
tonight by our colleagues as an amendment, um, and the
Advisory Board would be included in that larger report.
And so, we think it makes sense to think about pre and
post-implementation strategies with such an Advisory Board.
And I hope that our colleagues can join us tonight and in
voting on these amendments forward and making sure that we
continue to build out these lanes, uh, in a timely fashion
as set out by the ordinance, but really making sure that
we're getting that robust pre and post-implementation, uh,
strategy and follow up. So, I hope that our colleagues can

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

feedback and input to the traffic and parking as we continue

join us tonight in voting these amendments forward. Thank
you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

114
Packet Pg. 154

1

through you. Um, as you stated, and as the Vice Mayor
stated, um, these amendments, uh, come after having
discussion with, uh, not only, um, folks from Cambridge Bike

residents, um, that have raised, uh, you know, concerns
about the implementation of the, the North Mass Ave, Alewife
to Dudley implementation, and, and are concerned about, um,
uh, the ongoing, uh, implementation for parts of Mass Ave in
the City that haven't been--you know, that haven't been, uh-that haven't--that haven't happened yet.
Um, and so, I, I think there's, you know, if you listen
to the comments, um, of folks-- and first of all, I want to
thank everybody who-- it was a long--it was a long public
comment section and people waited around a long time for
their two minutes, and I, I, I thank them for that interest
and doing that. But I think that there's agreement that, um,
you know, we have to think of a way of, uh, doing a better
job around process. It's, it's something we talk about an

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Safety, but, um, really with the business community and

awful lot, uh, in various, uh, various issues in, in the
City.
Um, you know, I think one thing that--I don't wanna
speak for the Mayor and the Vice Mayor, but I, I, I think
115
Packet Pg. 155

1

that one thing that, um, was important to us when we were
talking with the business community and some of the
residents was that whatever changes we made were, it was not

through with the process. And I think that's important.
Just for clarity for people on both sides of this issue
who have different opinions about this issue, what we're
talking about is how best to move forward with the
implementation and minimize unintended consequences, not
whether we should or should not move forward with the
implementation. You even heard it today from folks who, um,
have concerns about what happened on Mass Ave saying, we're
not opposing the bike lanes. We know they're coming and
we're not, um--we're not asking to extend the deadline.
So, what we're talking about here is, is really
thinking more about the--you know, getting the feedback from
people and how do we do what it is we've decided to do, not
about moving backwards in our goal of, uh, implementing the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

about delaying the process and it was not about not going

25 miles of bike infrastructure called for in the ordinance.
So, um, I hope folks can support these. We, we, we, we feel
that this, uh, is, is, is a balanced--these are balanced
amendments. They come from conversations we've had with
116
Packet Pg. 156

1

people on both sides of this issue. Um, and we think it
makes for a stronger, uh, ordinance without changing the
intent, or policy order without changing the intent. Thank

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you, through

the Chair. First of all, I want to just acknowledge the, the
neighbors, the residents, the store owners that came out
once again just to express their, their concerns about how
we go forward on this bike infrastructure. I understand how
hard it is for, for them to come away from their stores or
from their time with their family to do this.
So, I do want to acknowledge the fact that they came,
and I'm just hoping that, uh, the Council will pull together
in the same direction to hear and acknowledge their concerns
and move an order forward that seeks to include them in a
more authentic, uh, way that is more collaborative so that
we can make sure that we are making always representing the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

you, Madam Mayor.

interest of as many people as possible, knowing that we're
not gonna always be able to please everyone.
I do wanna acknowledge my initial co-sponsor Councillor
to Toomey, who's, of course, no longer with the City
117
Packet Pg. 157

1

Council, was a key ally in initially putting these two
orders together. Uh, I brought these two policy orders
forward in December with the hopes that they were

spirit in which it was being introduced.
I don't believe that anyone on the Council is not in
favor of establishing bicycle lanes. And I know it's come up
a few times for people saying, don't stop the bicycle lanes.
And I think I wanna say every order that has come up in the
last several weeks have ended in not to delay the bike
infrastructure. So, I hope that's clear to folks. It is
beyond question that riding in Cambridge should not make a
person feel as though they're taking their life in their
hands with every trip.
And the City Council made the right call-in voting in
favor of the Cycling Ordinance in 2019. What the difference
is right now is 2019, we were not in a pandemic, and now we
are. And this pandemic has brought many, many, many of our

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

straightforward and be taken in good faith as a good faith

businesses to their needs. And so, this is an opportunity to
hear from, uh, the business community in particular who are
still struggling to get off their knees and onto their feet,
uh, during this, what seems to be never ending pandemic,
118
Packet Pg. 158

1

which is bringing a lot of stress and strain to everyone.
Uh, where I think we eared--where I think we eared was
in what came next, the city dove in head first, placing such

yesterday, that we forgot about our obligation to ensure
that we did this in a thoughtful, holistic way. And that
would be designed to minimize unintended consequences.
And we are learning more and more that there have been
unintended consequences, seniors feeling trapped in their
homes, uh, cut off from their home care and healthcare
workers, people with mobility impediments, feeling cut from
their businesses and medical officers, business feeling new
barriers to patronage, and residents feeling the sting of
even less parking and already crowded neighborhoods. So,
what is the answer?
The answer is not to imply, to simply imply that the
concerns of those who raised them, nor is it to say, let's
move backwards to restore all the parking and leave the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

an emphasis on, we need the separated lanes and we need them

cycles to their own devices, rather the answer begins by
bringing the various stakeholders to the table, by giving
them meaningful opportunities to engage with City planners,
to figure out why we can--how we can arrive at what I like
119
Packet Pg. 159

1

to call the unhappy medium.
The answer begins with me visiting the work that has
already been done and, and asking whether there may be a

be. I don't know, uh, what that approach is. I hope that in
this collaborative effort, we will find out what it is. I
know it has to begin with bringing the community to the
table and working with the community.
When we voted to move forward with the Cycling Safety
Ordinance, we ideally should have ensured that there would
be more robust balance and holistic compensations from the
very start. The good news is that it's not too late to move
forward with that idea now. Again, I see we have suggested
amending language on the floor. The only addition I would
like is in Charter Right Number 1 is in the third whereas
section, I'd like to include the Interfaith Community among
those being asked to participate.
And I'm hopeful that this new language gets us where we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

better, more balanced approach and what that approach might

need to be. And I hope that all my colleagues can be
supportive of the two orders. I wanna thank, uh, my newly
minted colleague, Councillor Toner, for his input. Uh, this
order, again, was not written haphazardly. Um, I went to a
120
Packet Pg. 160

1

meeting that was organized by Councillor Toner. I wanna say
it was close to 100 people there.
Uh, and it really was to get at the sentiment, the

mostly impacted on North Mass Ave. And as we move forward, I
hope we'll be cognizant that we are in the midst of this,
and that we still have square, there is the Mass Ave
infrastructure, and we really need to take a more holistic
approach to how we roll this out for everyone's best
interest. With that, I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We go to Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

And, uh, thank you to the Councillors who put the amendments
together. Um, I don't believe analyzing what can be done to
mitigate problems in the Northern Mass Avenue area for
businesses is included in this, that the city will indeed
meet with the people affected and try to find a better
solution. I'm not saying remove anything per se, but, um, I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

feeling, the intentionality, and the concern of those, uh,

don't believe that's in this.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone, yeah, just

to clarify the--so this is the first one, and then there's a
second one that we'll go to. After that, we'll discuss some
121
Packet Pg. 161

1

of the kind of more immediate changes that have been
requested by business owners. So that's a whole other set of
amendments. So, this is just to charter right Number 1. And

media changes. So, Councillor-COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Let me--let me then say,

uh, it seems to me that even putting this committee together
is going to take a lot of time if it--red crossed out area
said such a committee could be comprised of two members from
each of the relevant committees. Um, I don't know why that's
taken out. That is a good recommendation.
And I'm just bringing this up and later on, I think
it's in this one, I read both of them. Community Development
isn't mentioned at all, and they're the planning agency that
we have. Um, so those are comments that I would make. Um,
you gotta include the actors who have the skills to bring
people together, or trained to bring people together. Thank
you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

then the number two talks more about the, the, the more

So, we'll say, we'll go back to

-- Councillor Toner, do you want a comment?
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Sure. Um, through you to

the Clerk, is it appropriate to bring up my additional
122
Packet Pg. 162

1

amendment? I know, uh, Councillor Simmons mentioned hers. Is
it appropriate to bring it up right now? Uh, the only other
amendment that I would like to add to this, uh, uh, policy

is a need add to improve the process for notifying residents
and businesses in a more timely manner of forthcoming
changes to Cambridge's transit and road infrastructure and,"
And, uh, just insert that before "for a mechanism."
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Can we pull those up?

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

I think that's there.

Yeah.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons, can you

unmute? Thanks.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

And is it appropriate to

speak to it at this point, or?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, the amendments are before

us. I do have one suggestion and the Council can do what it-what it--what it wants. I think it'd be more

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

order is in the first whereas is, uh, after the word, "there

straightforward to vote on the original amendments, and then
do these amendments, um, because I think it's easier to do
amendments to the amendments versus going to the amendments
to the amendments and then back.
123
Packet Pg. 163

1

So that's just my suggestion. I think it seems that
what, I think, I'm hearing there's support for the
amendments that were just heard. And if that's the case, we

amendments. It seems what you've done here is you've made
amendments to the--to those--to those amendments.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Correct.

So, I think I would suggest

before we talk about that, Clerk, if there's no one else on
the amendments that were just introduced, to just vote those
up or down and then go to your changes.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Yeah, go ahead Councillor

McGovern.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Just I wanted to just

take a second to answer Councillor Carlone's question
because it may have an influence. You know, he asked this
question about why, um, that first part of that whereas was

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

should vote those up and down, and then you can make your

taken out that talked about the 2, 2, 2, 2 people. Um, we
had discussions with, with the city, and they actually felt
that having to form a whole new committee and find two
people from this group and two people from this group and
124
Packet Pg. 164

1

two people from this group, would actually be a much longer
delay.
And that if we use the committees that are already in

they took the screen down so I can't read them. Um, the
Pedestrian Committee, the, um--what are some of the other
ones that were there? Those committees are already in place
and getting feedback from them would mean less to no delay
in getting feedback.
And it would be much--it would be much more problematic
to, um, set up a whole new committee and find all kinds of
new people. So that's why we, we, uh, eliminated that first
part, uh, and included what was in blue. So, we think that
this is a way that we all have said that we don't want to
delay the process any, and this is what we have told as the
best way to do it.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

place, like the Pedestrian Committee, the -- um, you know,

So, what we're saying is we'll get information back from 10
committees and assume that'll be quicker than forming a
committee like the city normally does, which is taking
people from key committees and combining them for a specific
125

overview. And this will continue this overview. I actually
don't think it'll save time, but I'm not gonna fight that.
That's fine. I appreciate the explanation. Thank you.
So, if there's no new hand --

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Go ahead, Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. This is not a terribly substantive and hopefully not
controversial, um, amendment, but I, I believe the last
order that's appearing on our screen right now should be a
resolve.

the appointment by numbers, if you will, and it says, we
have expertise to review plans and offers of improvements,
and names that Pedestrian Council on Aging, the Transit
Advisory Vision Zero Advisory Commission for Persons with
Disabilities Bicycle Committee, the Small Business Advisory.
Um, I guess my concern is the initial order said was
really trying to get more people that had direct--that are
directly impacted. So, I'm thinking about store owners, and
I don't know if there's a store owner that sits on the
Pedestrian Committee on the Council on Aging, the Transit
Advisory Committee, the Vision Zero Advice Committee, the
Commission on Persons with Disabilities. It's not clear.
And so, we'll have experts that don't run businesses,
perhaps, being a part of the Advisory Committee. The

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Speaking to the amendment of in the third whereas, takes out

Advisory Committee was not just to--it was to look at the
impact that if you're not a member of the impacted group, I
don't know how you can speak for. So, I'm troubled that I
don't mind in addition to these folks that are experts, I do
127
Packet Pg. 167

1

object to not having a place for the store owners or people
that are in North--we're talking about upper North Mass Ave.
I don't see where people from North Mass Ave save the

Harvard Square, Business Association having any more voice
than they had before this order hits the floor. So, I'm
troubled by that because it, it excludes, in my opinion, the
people that the order was meant to include.
So, if, if I understand you, Madam Mayor, you're
saying, let's take your set of--these set of, uh, amendments
that you placed there, I would then I'm hoping that there's
another one that Councillor Toner and I worked on that says
such a committee could be comprised of members, but not
limited to, which leaves the ability for the folks--some of
the 80 people that spoke tonight to have a shot at being
represented.
The City I know works at being very good at community
engagement, but they don't do community engagement very

Business Association, which in this case would be the

well. They may be experts in their subject area, but
community--when it comes to community engagement, I feel
very strongly that we miss the mark. So, um, I'm gonna vote
present because I'm not sure that this is going to allow for
128
Packet Pg. 168

1

more citizen--authentic citizen participation as it's
written.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I saw Councillor Toner's hand

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Through you, Madam Mayor,

to, uh, my colleague, Councillor Simmons. I, I hear her
concern. Um, I do think in the next, uh, uh, item that we're
gonna take up, it does specifically talk about meeting
directly with those impacted on North Mass Avenue. Um, I
will also just say that I'm gonna be supportive of, uh, this
hopefully with all the amendments that are being presented.
Uh, many of you know, I actually live in the impacted
area, so this has been a living, uh, uh, wonderful past
seven months, uh, as this has rolled out. Um, many of the
people who spoke tonight are, are friends, lifelong friends
and neighbors, high school friends who have small
businesses, and, uh, a lot of people are frightened and
scared, uh, about how they see the future of their

businesses.
Um, I've been working hand to hand trying to find
alternative solutions to their parking, and I hope to work
closely with, uh, uh, Joe Barr and the Department going
129
Packet Pg. 169

1

forward and with all of you to address the immediate needs
of the folks on North Mass Avenue. I do think that this, uh,
uh, policy order 276, the one that we're dealing with right

Um, as many of you know, I ran unsuccessfully in 2017
for City Council, and this was the number one issue on my
campaign beat. And here we are in 2021, and the issue about
how the implementation is rolled out was, again, the number
one issue on my--I'm hoping that when I run for reelection
two years from now, this is not still the number one issue,
uh, when we go out.
I would like us to have a process where everybody feels
heard and is notified. And when we get to it, the reason I'm
asking for the insertion of my other amendment about
improving the process of notification is I don't ever want
to hear anybody say that they were surprised by these bike
lanes, uh, quick-build or otherwise going forward.
And people need to make decisions. I'm already getting

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

now, I'm looking to it as moving forward with the future.

phone calls from people on Mass Avenue asking whether they
should renew their lease or not. So, we need to be better
about informing them about what's happening on Mass Ave and
what's the rollout gonna be so they can make informed
130
Packet Pg. 170

1

decisions about whether they wanna renew their lease, uh, in
their retail space or restaurants or whatever.
So, going forward, um, I'm gonna be supportive of this.

will also deal with mitigating--working with folks to
mitigate the issues on North Mass Avenue.

Through you, Mayor

Siddiqui, I just wanna make a quick clarification so
everybody knows what's going on. As I understand it, the
discussion's been that the Council's gonna vote up or down
on the--just everybody knows where we are procedurally, vote
up or down on the amendments proposed by, uh, the Mayor, the
Vice Mayor, and Councillor McGovern. And then there are some

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, I believe that the, uh, second, uh, item we'll take up

additional amendments that was proposed by Councillor Toner
and Councillor Simmons that will be taken up after the
Council has voted on the, the first set of amendments.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes. Well, Councillor Simmons,
131
Packet Pg. 171

I have Councillor Azeem up. We haven't heard from him. So,
then we'll come to you. Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Thank you. Uh, first, uh,

Um, I just wanted to read into the record. Um, the Small
Business Advisory Committee, uh, Councillor Simmons had a
question about whether, uh, small business owners are
represented on any of the committees listed here. Um,
including on the committee that already exist are Jason
Alves, uh, Denise Jillson, and Michael Monestime, and C. A.
Webb of the East Cambridge, uh, Harvard Square, um, uh,
Central Square bid, and the Kendall Square Business
Association, um, as well as direct business orders in Erinn
Pearson of, uh, unisex Salon, um, and, uh, Theodora Skeadas
of Cambridge Local First, uh, among other members. That's my
whole comment. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, through you

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

thank you, Councillor Toner, I appreciated those comments.

to Councillor Azeem. Uh, I did know that Councillor Azeem as
one person who advocated for the implementation and the
organizing of that committee. I knew exactly who sat on it.
I thank you for reminding all of us about who sits there.
132
Packet Pg. 172

This is a little bit different, but again, I do appreciate
your stewardess on this.
Um, it really speaks to a larger issue, which, uh,

as Mr. Toner, Councillor Toner has said, um, if we're going
to, because that's such a big piece, I would respectfully
ask if we could then just take up his, his, um, change,
which is such a committee could be comprised of members of,
but not be limited to, and then we can be assure it. And I'd
be very much easier or be able to accept, um, what's
written, if that's the pleasure of the committee, the
Council.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, I think we--I would again

recommend as Chair, we wrote these up or down. And then I
wanna go to Councillor Toner to hear from his and yours,
Councillor Simmons, other added suggestions and amendments.
So, Mr. Clerk, will you do the roll?
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

I know it's late. I'm just

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

through you, Madam Mayor, with, um, my only concern is that

gonna--for clarity of the record, I'm just gonna summarize
what the Council would be doing. So, this is one vote on
amendments to the second whereas paragraph, the third
whereas paragraph, the insertion of a fourth whereas
133

paragraph, the amendment of the first and only ordered
paragraph, and the insertion of a second ordered paragraph.
On that motion;

Councillor Burhan Azeem – Yes

Vice Mayor Allana M. Mallon – Yes
Councillor Marc C. McGovern – Yes
Councillor Patricia M. Nolan – Yes
Councillor E. Denise Simmons – Yes

City Clerk Anthony Wilson called the roll:

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So again, just to clarify

where we are procedurally, the amendments from the Vice
Mayor, the Mayor, and Councillor McGovern have been adopted.
134
Packet Pg. 174

1

Um, and before the body right now are proposed amendments
from Councillors Toner and Simmons that are amending that
amended language.
Councillor Toner, you have the

floor.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Sure. I've already spoken

to it, but in the first whereas, I just want to make sure
that we, uh, beef up our notification process and, uh, as we
go forward. I mean, we, we now have an ordinance that was
voted on over two years ago. Um, I think you heard, uh,
through this process that despite all of the best intentions
of the prior Council who voted on the ordinance, and, uh,
folks who worked on the ordinance, not everybody in the City
of Cambridge actually watched City Council meetings or
ordinance meetings.
And, uh, there are many people who were surprised by
the, um, the, the magnitude of, uh, the Cycling Safety
Ordinance. And they're just learning about it now. So, as we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

go forward, I hope that we will make sure that everybody on
Cambridge Street, Broadway, Hampshire, uh, the rest of Mass
Ave, know about the plans going forward and have the
opportunity to, uh, get involved in the discussion and also
135
Packet Pg. 175

1

hopefully are able to be proactive in mitigating any
negative impacts, uh, that are foreseen. So that's why I'm
offering this first Amendment. And, uh, Councillor Simmons

the Interfaith Community. And I'll let her speak to that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you. Through the

Chair to the Council. First of all, I want just to thank and
acknowledge Councillor Toner. He has, as he says, been
working on this for a very long time. Um, and, uh, so I
commend him for being new and jumping in and working very
vigorously, uh, for something that he not only knows and
feels is right, but represents the interest of a good many
people that are very, very concerned. So, I want to, uh,
acknowledge that.
I also wanna acknowledge my other colleagues for
putting the time meeting, uh, together and coming up with,
uh, language to broaden and make a--make it, uh, opportunity

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

also asked that we include in the third whereas, including

for people to have authentic participation in governance, in
how--in the outcome of policies and practices that we vote
and impact their lives. One of the things when we were, uh,
discussing in the third, whereas, somehow the Interfaith
136
Packet Pg. 176

1

Community, it says committee, it should say community
because they're not a committee.
They have raised issues relative to how some of this

informed. And there is no standing committee of the City
Council that speaks specifically, or standing commission
that speaks to the interest or represents the Interfaith
Community. So, I very much wanted to see them named, um,
specifically as well as, and I, I don't know if before us,
as well as the first part of the whereas, and the third
whereas, which such a committee could be comprised of
members of, but not limited to.
So, I just think it's just important. I know we're all,
uh, thinking very, um, acutely about how to make sure that
we have bicycle infrastructure in the city because we don't
want anyone hurt or harmed, but we also don't wanna hurt and
harm other folks by trying to particular, particular
interest groups. So, I think this, this order as amended

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

infrastructure has rolled out, and then they had not been

goes a very long way of saying to the residents of our city,
whatever, uh, their particular interest is, is that we care
about how the work we do affects them overall. I yield the

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Before we go to Councillor

Zondervan, Vice Mayor, one question I had, um, about the
Interfaith Community, Councillor Simmons, just--and I'm

to some of your, um, Zooms in the past two years with
members of the Interfaith Community through your group. Is
this what you're referring to?

Okay. So, you advisory?

unraises our hands when we're done. So, I think tonight,
since she is remote, we probably have to unraise our hands
when we're done. Uh, I just wanted to say thank you to

forward. I considered them to be friendly amendments and
I'll be supporting them. So, thank you. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Madam Mayor, through you,

I also, um, want to thank Councillor Simmons and Councillor
Toner, uh, in bringing this forward. I think, uh, everybody
has shown, uh, a really good faith effort here, uh, to try
and come up with something that, um, you know, that, that
people on either side of this discussion can feel good
about.
We, we are gonna--we will create this Advisory
Committee. It will be representative--it will change the way
we move forward with these plans while making sure that we
are still moving forward with these plans. So, I really want

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Simmons and Councillor Toner for bringing this

to thank Councillor Toner and Councillor Simmons for their
flexibility, and I will be supporting these amendments.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, I don't see any other hands

up on these, uh, amendments to the amendments. So, we'll go

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

I think these amendments, uh, look good, so I'll support

1

them.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. So, on this, uh, I'll

speak to very briefly before I go to the Vice Mayor. Um,

for this order. The substitute came from conversations,
which I alluded to, and which other my colleagues have
alluded to that I think all of us have had with business
owners, uh, and which have, you know, shown us the need and
to, to immediately offer solutions, uh, that we're hearing.
And so those were summarized. And so, I'll go to the
Vice Mayor for more, but the intent, that was the intent.
And so that would--this would substitute what is originally
there. So, we can have discussions from, from that end. Go
ahead, Vice Mayor Mallon.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you Madam Mayor.

And through you, Councillor McGovern, the Mayor, and myself
offer this amendment by substitution to Calendar Item Number
2. Given that we did pass a policy order last month to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

these--we had the Clerk, we sent the clerk, um, a substitute

specifically address the community engagement and future
processes, and just, just now past the creation of an
Advisory Committee, we felt that this substitution better
responded to meetings we all had last week with members of
142
Packet Pg. 182

1

the Small Business Community and residents and stakeholders
of North Cambridge who have had concerns about the bus and
bike lanes, as well as bike advocates who have all proposed

the change less impactful to businesses and residents, like
adding more signage to indicate metered parking, exits on
side streets, exploring a longer stopping time, uh, in the
bus lane on non-peak hours and others.
I really wanna thank the, um, the Small Business
Community, the residents of North Cambridge that came
forward and requested meetings with us. And we really had a,
a really good brainstorming session and a good conversation
on how to move forward. On, on North Mass Ave, in
particular, I think everybody around the table agreed that,
you know, better bike infrastructure is critical along that
line on Mass Ave, as well as creating better bus
infrastructure, um, to make sure that people are, are taking
public transportation.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

some immediate solutions that could be implemented to make

I think it was really around trying to find creative
solutions as the, the road users and the users of the area
to try to figure out how to mitigate some of the impacts,
uh, that could be done pretty easily. So, this amendment by
143
Packet Pg. 183

1

substitution really responds to those meetings that we had
last week, and the public comments, uh, tonight in December,
and the emails, and the calls and the meetings that we've

So, um, I really hope that our colleagues can, um,
accept this amendment by substitution tonight, and that we
can move forward with some of those, uh, small but in fact
changes that that could happen on North Mass Ave. So, uh,
thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield back
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern, and then

Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, um, you know, I couldn't--could not have said
it better than, than the Vice Mayor. Um, I do also
appreciate, uh, the folks who, who met with us and, and, you
know, the willingness to, um, to talk about possible
solutions that are not about removing the bike lanes, but
are about thinking of other ways in which to, um, mitigate

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

all had.

some of the unintended consequences that they're
experiencing, um, and I think this, this substitute gets to
that. So, I will, uh, I will stop there, but, um, uh,
hopefully we can pass this and move forward and start
144

getting some help for these businesses in place as soon as
possible.
Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddique. Through you, I appreciate all of the work that's
gone into this. Like, uh, everyone here, I've gone out on
different parts of the city, particularly Northern Mass Ave
recently, both on my bike, in my car, and walking. Talked to
residents, talked to small business owners.
I really appreciate the work that went in by Councillor
Simmons and then Councillor Toomey, and then now some of the
amendments from you, Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor, Councillor
McGovern, and the comments from my colleagues. It is--we all
have to remember my comments on this, just like the one that
we just passed, which I was very happy to support, is that
we can all be really excited about this vision. We are doing
bike lanes across the city, and yet change and transition is
really difficult.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And we can all be proud that we are working to
reimagine the streets, which we absolutely should do,
particularly to incentivize people to take public transit
and to leave their cars at home. I've been involved in that
145
Packet Pg. 185

1

in various ways for, you know, the last, uh, two decades,
and I'm happy to support them. However, I think it would be
a, a, a lost opportunity if we don't recognize and reiterate

The ordinance is in place, almost no one, I don't
actually think anyone who is in favor of the policy orders
and in favor of looking at this and doing it better, said,
stop the bike lanes, that is huge, even as we're saying,
let's do them better. And yet, we spent tonight many hours
over whether to have a group convened in a better process.
What I am very happy to support, I would've supported
the original policy order. I'm happy to support this
substitute. Residents and small businesses are pleading for
help. They're not pleading to stop this. They're pleading
for creative solutions, for collaboration, for innovative
thinking. Things we should want them to do, no one is saying
delay, no one is saying Stop. They are saying, hear us,
include us, believe us.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

what we have heard and know is a huge victory.

I don't wanna hear from people who are dismissing the
concerns that we have heard brought to so poignantly by
small businesses here. We had a doctor who sent us a letter
signed by more than 50 mobility impaired people saying, we
146
Packet Pg. 186

1

really are in trouble here. So, let's not dismiss that. We
heard from BIPOC small business owners. We heard that
diversity and inclusion, equity issues that we say we care

I know there's lots of other places in the world. I've
lived in New York, I lived in-- I lived in Amsterdam, I went
to Copenhagen, Toronto, all these other places. What we're
saying is, let's find out if what is true in some of those
places is true for stretches like upper Mass Ave, let's get
the data. And I would just have to say all of those who
asked us to vote these down would have meant accepting
acquiescing and condoning a terrible, sadly, incredibly
divisive process.
We have a lot of other issues that we should be
spending our time on. We need all hands on-deck, not more
divisions. These policy orders simply ask for an inclusive
process with all stakeholders and a response to the missteps
of the implementation. So, I, obviously, love bike lanes, I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

about, were not really included in people at the table.

bike around myself a lot, and I'm totally psyched about
this, and yet, we have so much other work to do.
I really wanna reiterate that plea to say let's come
together, that coming together for this policy order is
147
Packet Pg. 187

1

exactly an example of what we should be doing, but this is a
plea to the whole community. We did not see that in other
areas leading up to this meeting tonight. And we have so

community-wide to really come together and understand this
is not an us or them, this is everybody working together for
a better implementation, then we're gonna be in deep trouble
when the other issues come before us.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Councillor Azeem.
Um, this is not directly--

this is addressed in the text of these, uh, policy orders,
both the one that we just ordained and this one. Um, but I
just wanted to say explicitly because we've used, uh,
bicycle infrastructure as a shorthand. Um, uh, I just wanted
to say that I think that both for myself, but others, as
we're looking for a better process, we wanted explicit--I
wanted to explicitly say that I do support both the bicycle
infrastructure and the bus priority lane that was added on

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

many other big challenges. If we can't get this one in the

North Mass Ave. And that that is something that, um, I
personally do support. And as we're hoping for better
process, hopefully that is something that, uh, the city also
keeps and, uh, really prioritizes bus access through that
148
Packet Pg. 188

1

route.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Toner.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Uh, just like to say that

hope, Minor Amendments and whereas's had to bring forward
after. You know, this one is all about working hand in hand
with the folks to try to mitigate their issues. And as
Councillor Nolan said, I think it's gonna take, uh, creative
alternatives, and I'm happy to talk to all of you about some
of the ones that I've been talking to the businesses about.
But I do think there are opportunities to help the
businesses who need help with parking the most.
Um, my big concern, and the reason I'm happy we passed
the earlier policy order is once we get, get past Dudley
Street, there's more businesses and less parking. So, as we
go forward that process, we really need to think about how
we're going to address those needs. And I too support
priority bus lanes. However, I do think we need to take a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I'll be supportive of this substitution. I do have two, I

look at, do they really need to be priority bus lanes all
day long? And how, how can we use that space, um, to provide
some relief for folks going forward.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I fear we haven't done anything for Northern Mass Avenue. I
know we say some things, but let's see what happens. I don't

and Brittle did a little bit. Um, not having Community
Development on that first order seems like a slap in the
face to that department.
I know it says in other relevant departments, but, um,
you list the other ones and you don't list the only planning
office we have. I think the planning on Northern Mass Avenue
was very sad and very--the vision was set before much
discussion even started. And I understand Porter Square is
pretty much the same way now. Um, we just have to do much
more.
I don't see much about mitigation it's mentioned, we
should flatly say we want the city to mitigate the negative
impacts on local small business and small business.
Otherwise, I mean, this is a recommendation, and if we're

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

expect much will change, just like Cambridge Street didn't

lukewarm in a recommendation, guess what? We're gonna get
what we ask for. So, I'll certainly vote for this. I think
it could be a much stronger and pointing in the right
direction and a stronger direction than it's stating now.

Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, we'll go back-- you know, I

have Councillor Simmons's hand up, but procedurally, I would

favor, you know, vote yes. If you don't want the substitute,
vote no. There will be amendments to this substitute if it
does pass. And if it doesn't, we have the original before
us. Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

you. That was the question. I wanted to ask, what was the

subsequent amendments after?

is vote this one up or down before we-COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

and other stakeholders have raised significant concerns

bicycle infrastructure and priority bus lanes. And whereas
the concerns have focused on the loss of available parking
spaces near their homes, local businesses, and medical
offices and, and then what was already there.
However, uh, in the ordered part, which I thought was,
uh--I got my greens and black ink mixed up here. Uh, if it's
not already there, what I wanted to add was the Fire
Department and any other relevant department to meet with
the impacted residents and businesses on Northern
Massachusetts Avenue to discuss their ideas and suggestions
for addressing their concerns and others that have been put
forward.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you. I do appreciate the intent of these
amendments, but, but again, my concern here is that this is
taking it back in the direction of the original, um, policy
order, which did raise concerns with the staff and, in
particular, the amendments to the order to meet with the
impacted residents and businesses.
It's not clear what--who that is, who, who is impacted,
who's not, how do the staff determine that they have met
with everybody or not? So, it feels too vague to me to send
that to the Manager. I think the, the staff know how to
understand what the impacts are and, and what possible

explain that the reference to the impacted businesses on

can probably count the 10 business owners who have concerns
that many of the Councils have already met with that I'm
simply asking that they be part of the discussions with
Traffic--the Traffic Department as they come up with
solutions.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you. I wasn't

going to speak earlier, but I do want to just stand in
support of my colleague, Councillor Toner, uh, for just two
reasons. I'll be very brief. First of all, Councillor Toner
has really been boots on the ground. He knows who he's
talking about. He knows some of these individuals, these
store owners.
Uh, what this basically says, uh, reiterates and he
minds this community, is that the City Council is paying
attention, is, is looking toward them to say, we're trying
to work with you. As my, uh, newer colleague, uh, my
freshman colleague, Councillor Azeem said, nowhere does it

adopt the amended order, let's go proceed to, uh, do a roll

Board of Trustees of the Library, um, after this appeared,
uh, talking about her stellar role in leading the library
forward. So, I just thought it was a time for us. I know we

just wanted to highlight just a couple words for someone who
was remarkable in her accomplishments and yet so
understated. She never wanted it to be about herself. It was
always about social justice and racial equity.
She held numerous fundraisers for force multiplier,
Young People's Project. There are just so many ways in which
she contributed to our community, and yet was, again, a
quiet guiding force for all of us. I know, I myself just in
conversations and better for having known her. So, I, um,
deeply mourn, um, the passing of this--of this Cambridge
person far, far too young.

sometimes Janet and I didn't always agree, you know, on, on

was always pleasant and was always respectful.
And we could debate things, but it never became, uh,

she's done in this--that she did in this community. And so,

all, thank you to my colleagues for unanimous consent to go

say thank you to Peter Daly after 33 years of service to the
City of Cambridge, as most of you have gotten an email to
let us all know that he's leaving.
There has been no stronger advocate that, uh, uh, I can
speak to that Peter Daly in Homeowners Rehab and the work
that he's done to preserve affordable housing, to identify
places for affordable housing, and just to advocate
struggling for those that would sit on waiting lists for
years to be housed in Cambridge. And so, I certainly wish
him his--the very best. I'm very sad to see him go.
I hope that he'll continue, or he said in his email,
"I'm gonna continue to stay active," and I hope he does. But
this is, I'm sure, the move that's right for him, even
though it's sad for us. And I just want say for the record,

many fine professionals, but there is a first ray quality to
Peter, um, that you don't see in the development field
often. And he's comfortable, he says what he believes, it's
not always what you think.
He's open to other ways of looking at things. And if
you start asking him a question about a particular
development, um, I mean, he's just full of information to
share. And that generosity is, is greatly appreciated. I

I can defer to Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

So, it's a question of timing. Um, if the special permit or
the construction permit, I, I don't know what's Mr. Sultan
is achieving, um, although I know he is moving forward with

as an ordinance, uh, he should be fine. But, you know, that
could happen--theoretically, we could do this in six weeks.
We have never done that in six weeks, but we could go
through the process that quickly. It normally takes about
three months to go through the process. So, it's a matter of
timing. But if we do pass it and he hasn't gotten his
permit, then yes, he would be affected.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you. Vice Mayor, and

then Councillor Zondervan.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. I

have asked this specific question in the past when this was
originally brought forward by Councillor Nolan in the last
term, and was told by the Clerk and the Solicitor that the
moratorium is in place at the time of the noticing of the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the building. If he gets that before the Council votes this

meeting, um, of the Planning Board or the Ordinance
Committee. And I have it in writing, so I'm, I'm just a
little bit confused as to what Councillor Carlone, uh, said.
So, I see he has his hand up, maybe he can clarify.
171
Packet Pg. 211

1

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Vice Mayor

and Mayor.
Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Mayor. If the

ordinance is eventually passed three months down the line,
it's the first meeting--the Clerk can clarify this--I
believe it's the first Ordinance Committee meeting date that
it becomes valid, but only if it passes three months later.
So, if it doesn't pass, that first date doesn't mean
anything.
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

So, Madam Mayor, is the

Clerk, would he like to clarify or comment, I should say?
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So, as we've just sort of

discussed in the past, it's really a question more of in-something more in the realm of the Law Department for the
Solicitor to really answer. Um, but I'm aware there's, um-from her response that there was some law out there, uh,
opining on the effect of the publication of a pending

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

ordinance change on, uh, existing projects. Again, I, I
don't wanna get into it because it's--it is really more of a
detailed legal discussion.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, I see that Dr--I'm sorry,
172
Packet Pg. 212

1

Councillor Zondervan has his hand up. So, Vice Mayor, do you
wanna finish up, and then I can go to Councillor?
VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Yeah. Thank you, Madam

asked it in, in the last term because it, it was a question
that came from the community, so we should get some clarity
around it. Maybe the Chairs of the Ordinance Committee
could, um, maybe put something forward, uh, to the community
so that everybody knows.
I think everyone hears moratorium and feels like it's
today, today is the day, um, but there is some kind of legal
issues with timing that I think could be really helpful to
put forward to the community. So, thank you. I'll yield back
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. And I did not receive my Doctorate yet. Thank you for
this honor. My understanding is that Mr. Sultan has, has
their permit at ISD. And so, I believe there should be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. I think this has been a question, like I said, I

enough time for them to get approved, but we will--I'll
certainly follow up with ISD and, and make sure on that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, Councillor Toner,

ultimately, you know, we, we can--we'll get back to you. Go
173
Packet Pg. 213

1

ahead, Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes. Thank you. Just to

remind us all, this has to be referred to Ordinance and to

as you know, would take a few months. I think if there's
something existing in the pipeline, there might be a way in
that discussion with Ordinance and Planning.
We can ask at the time those meetings are happening,
what the procedure would be for something that's part in the
process and could deal with it then if it was determined
that the will of the Council is that the moratorium only
applies to certain kinds of projects going forward. And I
also wanna address that we had gotten a communication about,
there is yet another acquisition of one of the entities set
up. It wasn't just the $400 million, it was an additional.
As far as we know, that was not an acquisition of land.
It was a lease for something else so that the actual cost of
acquisition is still accurate in terms of, um, what this

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 10, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the Planning Board, and there's a process. So, it generally,

chart is, and it doesn't affect the, the actual substance of
the moratorium if it turns out that there have been money
spent. We know that this particular one, just one
acquisition expects to spend another $100 million in the
174
Packet Pg. 214

1

next few months. So, that doesn't actually affect the
Ordinance.
But I just to the point of the timing, when this comes

certainly determine whether there are ways that--or projects
that should be going forward. Thank you. At least that-that's my intent as one of the motion makers here.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

forward to working with as we move forward on the City
Council search for new City Manager, but this is an--this is
an update on the City Manager search process.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor Simmons.

And then the follow-up to that is a communication report
from other City officers, uh, which is--summarizes
essentially through the Chair. Last term, there was an RFP
Evaluation Committee that was appointed, and this was Vice
Mayor Mallon, Councillors Nolan and Zondervan and Toomey, as
well as other staff members.
It was formed to contract with a--with an executive
search firm for the purpose of hiring the, the next City
Manager. So, this communication lays out what those

experience with Cambridge specifically, nor do they have
experience with doing the extensive committee outreach and
engagement that the search requires. So, we have a late
policy order that's also associated with this communication
and saying that we're confirming that the RFP Evaluation
Committee completed its work.
And thank you to everyone involved. And thank you to
Councillor Simmons for getting us to this point. And now
moving forward, we know that we have this next step in the
process, which will be a community engagement piece. And
we'd like the Council to do a few things, designate the
Chair of Gov Ops, who's the Vice Mayor, to serve as the City
Council's designee, to coordinate with Randi Frank

the City Council designates the Chair of Government
Operations, that is to coordinate logistics.
This will--the process by which we all decide how it is
that we will be moving forward, uh, will still be something
185

to be determined in that committee, as well as eventually
the entire Council will be involved in it. So, this is--this
is not saying the search will just go and Vice Mayor Mallon

passes, will be the coordinating force, and will, of course,
be communicating back and forth with all of us as we proceed
to move forward.
This will be happening pretty quickly, which is why we
want this to be passed tonight. We are, um, expecting the
firm has already been selected, as, as noted in the
communication. And in that contract, it's specifically said
they would be working with some local groups on community
engagement. So that was, was a whole month ago, and so now
this is just saying, okay, and we're ready to go with these

I would just like to make

a plea. We do not have a meeting next week. The following
meeting is the 24th. We are already behind in coordinating
and hiring these two community engagement pieces that we
decided--you know, we really talked about during the, the
Executive search process and the RFP Search Committee.
If there was any way for Councillor Simmons to, um,
remove the charter right, and let us move forward with this
tonight, I'd be happy to meet with her, and any members of
the City Council to go over next steps and how these
community engagement processes will work. We are very behind

tight.

You are keeping your Charter

Right?

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes, I am.

And I will say that I'm, Vice

Mayor, anticipating this. Unfortunately, I will--I will work
with the Clerk, and I think I can probably call a special
meeting and figure out--I know we need to have those
conversations. I think some of the community engagement
firms who we've--you and others have talked to for the last
few weeks, uh, are, are waiting.
And so, we need to figure out a way to move forward.
And you are the Chair, and so we'll work together on that.
Are there any announcements? We have one more PO before we
go to announcements.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So, there is another late

policy order from Councillor McGovern. The order paragraph
reads that the City Manager being hereby is requested to

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

plan to increase access to testing with the goal of reducing
wait times for residents, including but not limited to,
expanding test sites, hiring staff to operate additional

sites, offering testing tents set up in City squares,
developing a grab-and-go model, as used in local
universities, Harvard, and MIT, and more. And to report back

communications, and there's this late policy order to be
resolved.

achieve its goals. He emphasized the importance of inclusion

whether changes to a neighborhood align with the City's
goals. He believes that to ensure proper representation, a

committees, as is necessary for all committees in Cambridge.
However, he expressed disappointment with the current
reappointments to these boards, which fail to reflect the
values of representation and inclusion. He highlighted
issues such as an average appointee age of 75 with no one
under the age of 60, and a lack of renters and people of
color. He urged the City Manager to develop a plan to
increase diversity on these boards and to hold off on
reappointments until then. He also called for the reform of
NCD creation rules to give residents a more participatory
voice in the process.
Itamar Turner-Trauring, Oxford Street, supported the
reform of Neighborhood Conservation Districts and
eliminating parking minimums to make building housing easier

diverse range of voices should be included in these

and less expensive due to the need for more affordable
housing. He addressed the impact of COVID-19 on businesses,
specifically restaurants, citing data from the Open Table
restaurant reservation platform, which showed a significant
3
Packet Pg. 240

2

decline in restaurant seating at the beginning of 2021.
He pointed out that this impact was felt across the
whole City, affecting businesses involving close personal

general. He urged that to help small businesses, one should
focus on the entire City and account for the massive impact
of COVID-19 when gathering data on the impact of bike lanes
on businesses.
Loren Crowe, 8 Museum Way, spoke on Policy Order 11 and
proposed the deployment of Cambridge's core values of
diversity and inclusion in the NCD process, which has been
largely dominated by older white homeowners. Including all
types of stakeholders in the proposing, studying and
operating stages of NCD will help to make it more legitimate
and better serve the community. He argued that the three NCD
Slates nominated were far and away older, wider, and more
homeowner-oriented than the communities they will serve.
He suggested that the City Manager provide information

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

contact like hairdressers, tattoos, massage, and retail in

about Board composition reflecting community diversity and
put a process in place to ensure this happens routinely with
all nominations. Finally, he urged people to fact-check
their sources before commenting on the ordinance as some
4
Packet Pg. 241

2

emails with bad information have been circulated.
Zach Durant-Emmons, Ellery Street, spoke on Policy
Order 11. He expressed several concerns about the economic

the businesses on Mass Ave and Broadway that have or will
lose parking, causing a decrease in business. The loss of
parking is hurting local businesses and may force the
speaker to use a ride share or forgo going to certain places
altogether. He believes that the plan not only hurts the
liveliness of businesses but also poses safety risks to
residential areas. He urges the City Councillors to pause
and redesign the plan before more taxpayer money is wasted,
and businesses are closed.
Justin Saif, Hurley Street East Cambridge, spoke on
Common-sense NCD Reform. These revisions ensure that NCDs
cannot be used by a few people to encumber entire
neighborhoods without democratic accountability. The
revisions also require proper representation of communities

reauthorization from time to time to ensure they still serve
an appropriate role. He believes that the straightforward

David Halperin, 115 Auburn Street, spoke on Calendar 2,
citing low rate of property development and wastage of urban
land with one third of off-street spaces mandated by the

eliminate the minimums and monitor the number of permits
issued, and if necessary, find alternative solutions such as
making permits less attractive or allowing off-street spaces
to be used by permit holders. He argued that parking
minimums make housing more expensive, encourage car
ownership, and increase CO2 emissions and traffic, which is
inconsistent with addressing the housing crisis and climate
change.

Suzanne Blier, 5 Fuller Place, spoke on Parking
Minimums and the Neighborhood Conservation Districts. She
mentioned that the Envision report does not promote ending

more about ideology than practicality. She also opposed the
Policy Order eviscerating neighborhood conservation
districts, stating that it does not promote diversity and

there is a growing movement of opposition to the removal of
parking, and that it is not limited to a few people.
He mentioned that loss of parking increases demand for
parking in the neighborhood, and many homes rely exclusively
on on-street parking. Traffic restrictions on Mass Ave have
diverted traffic onto side streets, where parked vehicles
are frequently hit. He also emphasized the importance of

He expressed concerns that the impact of the loss of parking

neighborhoods, and that it would be better to obtain data
from affected Cambridge businesses themselves. He suggested
that the City has not yet obtained this local information,
and that transparent data collection would be helpful for
informed planning for implementation of the Bicycle Safety
Ordinance.

Sharon Cerny, 1780 to 1798 Mass Ave and Porter Square,
spoke about Agenda Item #5 (POR2022#9). She believes that a
comprehensive traffic and parking study is necessary to

that businesses support pedestrian safety but cannot be
sacrificed for it. Cerny suggests that all parties must come
together to develop a plan that works for everyone. Finally,
she argues that businesses cannot be put out of business
after surviving COVID-19.
Robert Camacho, Corporal Burns Road, spoke on Policy

Broadway in front of the main library after Jen Varo. She
described Varo as a tireless volunteer and advocate for the

Catherine Zusy, 202 Hamilton Street, spoke on rejecting
Policy Order 11, Loren Crowe Petition, as it eliminates
experts from the Conservation District Commissions and
reduces the executive director's role to that of a

of the Neighborhood Conservation District to affect
affordable housing projects or projects developed under the
affordable housing overlay. The City Council lacks expertise
in preservation architectural history or urban planning, and
most members receive money from developers or development
groups, which is a conflict of interest. The real goal of
the Crowe Petition is to remove all obstacles to development

argues that preserving Cambridge's history and heritage is

property owners. She also praises the important work of NCDs

The City announced last week that due to the sustained
improvement in our COVID-19 metrics, that the City will lift
its mask requirement for indoor public places effective

in reported cases, test positivity, and COVID-19 virus
detection in the City's municipal wastewater monitoring
program.
Effective Monday, March 14th, the City of Cambridge
will follow the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's
mask advisory for vaccinated and unvaccinated residents,
consistent with the Center for Disease Control and
Preventions mask guidance, and will not require the use of
face masks in indoor public places in Cambridge.
Many people will still choose to wear masks in certain
places and situations after the mask requirements ends. And
we encourage people who feel more comfortable wearing a mask
based on their individual risk to do so. The Cambridge
Public Health Department has created some great tips on

uh, for two years, uh, when we, uh, had our first case in my

I want to go ahead and, uh, dive into, uh, the
presentation. We can, uh, go to the first slide, please. We
really want to focus on the, uh, new CDC metrics. As you are
38

likely aware, on Friday, the CDC introduced new metrics for
classifying community risk for COVID-19. This system takes
into consideration new hospitalizations for COVID-19 and the

CDC and the new COVID cases in the community.
The metrics take into account disease severity and
healthcare capacity, and are focused on preventing stress in
the healthcare system. The new metrics also put more
decision-making responsibility around protective measures--I
apologize, I lost the presentation. Give me one moment. The
metrics take into account disease severity and healthcare
capacity and are focused on preventing stress on the
healthcare system. The new metrics also put more decisionmaking responsibility around protective measures,
particularly those at higher risk for severe disease.
The Cambridge Public Health Department realizes this
has left people with a lot of questions about what their
individual behavior should look like. We will be developing

viral levels in wastewater in Eastern Massachusetts have
plummeted since early January, as we are all aware. Under
this old model, both Cambridge and the County, still fall in
the high risk category, so please keep that in mind.
You'll also see that Cambridge experienced an uptick in
cases over the past two weeks. Next slide, please. When I
look at Middlesex and Cambridge metrics, this is the same
data but presented using the new CDC metrics that we've all
heard about, uh, beginning on Friday and throughout the
weekend. While the number of cases haven't changed from one
chart to the other, these new category has taken into
account hospital capacity in the region.
Under the new model, the County is considered to be in
the low-risk category. Although the CDC doesn't release

mandate into March. That gives us some time to see what
happens as the kids return to school today, today after
February vacation, and time to develop more tailored
guidance for residents as related to the CDC's new metrics.
We're hopeful that community transmission will decrease
further over the next few weeks. We also continue to monitor
the Omicron sub variant called BA.2, which the CDC estimates
now accounts for 6.9 of new COVID-19 infections in New
England. As I mentioned, cases at higher education
institution have resulted in a slight increase in our City's
cases.
This chart shows reported cases by splitting out higher
education from the rest of the community. You'll see that

while cases in the community have decreased, have declined
since early February, higher education cases shown in red
have increased over the past two weeks. It is--it is--it is
also worth noting that statewide people age 16 to 19, and 20

In the past two weeks, COVID related hospitalizations

been significant declines across all age groups, including
those over 50. Our state now has the third lowest COVID
hospitalizations in the country according to the New York
Times. With fewer people seriously ill with COVID, the
pressure on our healthcare system is finally easing up.
In the metro west region, which includes Cambridge, ICU
beds were occupied--sorry, that's blocking out on me. I'll
come back and give you that information. It is important to
remember that the disproportionate impact of COVID on
communities of color, 10 residents identified as black,
Latino, or other. Our hearts go out to their families and
remain--and we remain committed to addressing root causes of
health inequities, including systemic racism.

outstanding on their booster shot, please seek out that
resource to, to have that done, and we'll talk about that at
the end of the presentation. Our eligible teens and younger
adults under 30 have lower booster rates than other age
groups. We like for those percentages to be higher. The good
news, over 70% of the City residents over the age of 50 and
older are boosted, and it's this population that is more
likely to become seriously ill with COVID.
This table shows vaccine status of Cambridge residents
by race, ethnicity. We are seeing slow but steady progress
in the booster column. Since early February, booster doses
for each group has gone up two to three percentage points.
But while they're still below what we like to them to be, we

Thank you for the presentation.

Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, thank you, uh, for the presentation. Um, just
one--really, just one question. Um, you know, this has
obviously been a very chaotic and crazy and unpredictable
couple years, you know, for everybody. And I think, um,
talking about the, the, the, the mask mandates and some of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Cambridge.

the other things that we've--uh, that we've done over the
last couple years, um, and, you know, people have different-we are--we're getting emails from people who want us to
keep the mandate. We're getting emails from people who would
46
Packet Pg. 283

2

like it to be gone today.
Um, but I think some of it is that is also just the,
the unpredictability of everything. And I know the Council,

tell me, um, we passed a Policy Order some time ago about
getting some kind of thresholds or some kind of what, what,
what the proper term is, to say that if numbers fall below
this, we're gonna do X, if numbers are above this.
And I think that we haven't done that yet. And I think
that is so incredibly important for us to do, just so people
can--we may see another--we may see another surge, we're
probably likely to see another surge, and people don't know
what is gonna trigger what response, and that just adds to
people's anxiety and, and the unpredictability.
So I really hope we get that. You know, again, I can't
remember exactly when we passed that, but we did ask for it.
Um, and I think it will go regardless of how people feel
about those. And I don't know what the right thresholds are.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I, I want to say the Vice mayor did this, but if I'm wrong,

I'm not gonna tell you. You guys--you know, the Public
Health Department, uh, are the experts. Um, and people will
probably quibble over whether it's the right threshold or
not, but at least we've got something where people can say,
47
Packet Pg. 284

2

okay, now I understand why this decision is being made.
Um, you know, we're extending two weeks past the end of
February, and then a couple other weeks after that for

that, right? What--and so, we've got to provide people with
information as to why we're making the decisions we're
making, whether they agree with it or not. So I really
encourage us to get that in place, like we--like the Council
asked for as soon as we can. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
DERRICK NEAL:

Any response, Chief?

Yeah, we, we had that conversation, uh,

this morning with, uh, Dr. Dobberteen. And, uh, what, what
we want to do is make sure that we're given, uh, adequate
information. Um, part of the challenge with Public Health is
that, uh, the CDC did lure the threshold, but we still feel
like it's sufficient virus in the community where those
individuals are still at risk.
But you're absolutely correct in that health promotion

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

municipal buildings. People don't understand why we're doing

is our best advocate, and we don't use it enough. And health
promotion simply is information. And when you give, uh,
citizens accurate information, they're empowered to make
informed choices. So--but you're absolutely correct. We need
48
Packet Pg. 285

2

to do a better job of educating our citizens, and, uh, why
do we use the metrics that we do and make the decisions that
we make.

within, uh, not only Massachusetts, but this country. So a
lot of individuals look to see what we do. And, uh, what we
try to do is stay away from the political influence that the
CDC has been under over the past two years by really
sticking to our guns.
So we want to be sure--we're looking at, uh--and Lee
and I had this conversation earlier, we're looking at, um,
what is it gonna look like 10 days from now? Because we know
a lot about kiddos travel, uh, during spring break, so we
want to be extra cautious, uh, simply because we've seen
this movie before, as you mentioned. Uh, and the likelihood
in us going through another surge is probably likely. So-uh, but again, we'll do a better--be better stewards of, uh,
conveying information to our public. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
LEE GIANETTI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, Cambridge is, I quickly found out, uh, a, a leader

Lee.

To add to--thank you, Madam Mayor. To

add to the Chief Public Health Officer's comments, I think
throughout the pandemic, if you look at what we have, um,
49
Packet Pg. 286

2

sort of done, and it's really a word that our former, uh,
Chief Public Officer had used, was having a glide path. You
know, I wish there was one super metric that you could use,

It's looking at what's on the ground here in the City,
and then we've always sort of extended just a little bit
more. When you think about when the Governor lifted the
state of emergency, we went a few weeks longer with our
public, and then we went a little bit longer with our, um,
City building. So we've sort of been consistent and sort of
the approach we've taken, and that, I think, is also
important.
And even as we look at the decision that was made last
week, we made them on a set of metrics and what was on the
ground, and then a few days later, the CDC changes it. So
it's really looking at what's going on in the, uh,
community, relying on Public Health to sit there and strike
that balance between how do we really find the balance

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

but there really isn't.

between when you can lift, when you need to have it, and
also, this is about behavior.
And as we move into this longer term, how do we make it
so that people can make those choices to continue wearing
50
Packet Pg. 287

2

masks? And, um, I, I think we'll continue probably to do
that more cautious approach as we come out of things to do
it in a phased way, rather than on a single day announcing

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Carlone, and then Councillor Zondervan, then Councillor
Nolan.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Just a brief question. On a number--uh, the two charts that
you showed, um, showed an uptick in recent weeks, or was it
days? I'm not sure now. And yet on the summary statistics,
it's lower, positive tests over the last 14 days, 0.87. And
I realize you might be representing two different things,
but maybe you could just explain how this percentage is
different than the chart that showed the uptick.
DERRICK NEAL:

Yes, sir, Councillor Carlone, and

through Madame Mayor, I'm going to, uh, bring on, uh, our
epidemiologist to break that down. I want to make sure I'm

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that something's getting lifted.

giving you the correct data points, uh, to really--uh, to
answer your question, uh, sufficiently. I think Anna Kaplan
is on.
ANNA KAPLAN:

Thank you. Uh, through you, Madam Mayor,
51
Packet Pg. 288

2

um, to you Councillor Carlone, uh, it's a great question.
Um, we've seen percent positivity and cases per 100,000
used, um, pretty frequently throughout the pandemic to

community transmission. So the first graph, uh, that Mr.
Neal showed was the cases per 100,000 per week.
Um, and that just means how many people are positive
cases each week. Uh, the denominator is the number of people
who live in Cambridge. So you're looking at positive cases
over the number of people in the City. The percent
positivity is a little different. Uh, the numerator, the
number on top is the, uh, number of positive tests, and the
denominator is the number of negative tests.
So, if a person tests positive, um--or excuse me, if a
person tests negative and say they're in a surveillance
testing program through their work or their school and they
get tested three times per week, that's gonna mean that-that's gonna bring the percent positivity down. And it's a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

measure. And there are two different ways of measuring

way of measuring how well are we testing, um, and also how
well are we missing cases or how are we missing cases?
Um, because Cambridge is such a well-tested community
through our institutions of higher ed, through our seven
52
Packet Pg. 289

2

days a week testing program, the case rate per 100,000 can
give you a good sense that's comparable to other cities of
how many cases we have. And that's the metric that's

Um, so we are seeing, you know, I hope that we're not
at the bottom of, of the curve, right? I hope we can go down
further and I think we will. Um, but we have seen our case
rate flatten out. Um, but we are still seeing lots of
people, uh, get tested, which is why that percent positivity
is low, because we're seeing lots of people test negative,
which we like.

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. And, uh, through you, I wanted to go back to, um,
53
Packet Pg. 290

2

question Councillor McGovern asked earlier, because in, in
fact, the City did establish metric for removing the mask
mandate, which was that we would be in low transmission in,

we're, we're like a factor of 20--10 to 20 above that right
now. And, and instead, uh, we're still lifting the mask
mandates.
So I, I understand that, you know, the CDC has since
switched to hospital capacity as the, um, metric that
they're using, but, but we basically just changed our
metric, um, quite arbitrarily. And the hospital capacity, as
you know, better than I, is a--is a trailing metric. So, you
know, looking back on what is clearly the peak of the
Omicron wave, um, we can anticipate that our hospital
capacity is gonna, is gonna ease up, and that's great.
But if there's another, uh, variant or another wave
that, that starts to build up, then presumably, we can't or
shouldn't be using hospital capacity at that point to decide

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

uh, in Middlesex County. And as was shown in the data,

whether or not we're gonna be reimposing the mask mandate.
So, so, I guess that's kind of my question is, is this a, a
permanent shift to using a different metric? Or, or are we
simply saying, you know, Omicron is behind us and so we're
54
Packet Pg. 291

2

gonna change the metric so that we can must mask mandate?
DERRICK NEAL:

Thank you, Councilman. Uh, through Madam

Mayor, I want to go to Dr. Dobberteen to explain that

morning, if you will.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
LISA DOBBERTEEN, MD:

Dr. Dobberteen.
Uh, thank you. Through you, Madam

Mayor, and thank you, Councillor Zondervan, for that
question. Um, you know, as Public Health officials are, uh,
tasked to explaining and, um, sharing with the public the
metrics under which we operate. And so we have operated in
good faith under the CDC metrics, which were then changed on
Friday.
But as, uh, Mr. Neil mentioned, and I may ask, uh, Anna
Kaplan to weigh in as well, those metrics were changed, but
it doesn't--I am gonna go off camera. I am having, uh,
internet issues, so I'm gonna go off camera and hopefully,
you can still hear me. Um, it doesn't change the fact that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

because we, uh, had an expansive conversation on that this

the numbers of cases, the case rate in Cambridge is still
significant.
And so, in consultation with the City Manager, the mask
mandate was discussed and decided upon the City Manager in
55
Packet Pg. 292

2

consultation with us, decided to, and, uh, put into place
the guidelines that you've heard about when to list the
mandate--lift the mask mandate.

although the metrics, the framework for thinking about
COVID-19 in the community has changed, we still given, given
many things in our community, but the density of housing,
many multi-generational households, many young children
under five who are not yet vaccinated, many residents who
still need to be boosted, we still have a ways to go, and we
still need to be mindful and careful.
And there may--even after the 13th, there may be times
when many folks would be much more comfortable wearing masks
indoors. Um, I'm not sure that that answers your question
exactly, because we haven't changed the metrics. We have
just tried our best to interpret the changing guidance from
the CDC as our overarching, uh, agency that directs policy
in the United States. And I'll ask, um, Ms. Kaplan if she

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

We, uh, want all of the residents to understand that

wants to add anything to that, if I may, Madam Mayor.
ANNA KAPLAN:

Thank you, Doctor. And, uh, through you,

Madam Mayor, to you Councillor Zondervan, yeah, I, um, I, I
would share that the, the changing CDC metrics, I think, uh,
56
Packet Pg. 293

2

well, I wouldn't say that there's confirmed consensus in the
community of epidemiologists that everything about the new
guidelines are a plus. Uh, there's--there is general

includes severity of disease is a step in a good direction.
And I, I will be the first to say that, I do think
there are limitations to the new model. Um, I hear you about
the lagging indicator of hospitalization, and I, I would
like to clarify one piece, which is that if you're at over-if your county is at over 200 cases per 100,000 in a week,
you're automatically in the medium category. Once you look
at, are you over or under 200 cases? That's where the
hospitalization and the hospital--the people being
hospitalized and the hospital capacity come into play.
Um, and so, as we showed in that chart, you know,
although the CDC doesn't release, uh, community case
numbers, we do, and we can apply those to see, okay,
Cambridge as a community is actually in medium, because

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

consensus that, uh, a move to consider, um, a model that

although our regional hospital capacity is higher than it-than it was during the peak of the Omicron surge, we are
still over 200 cases per 100,000.
And what that means is that there are certain
57
Packet Pg. 294

2

expectations of when you might want to mask, when you might
not want to. Um, I do acknowledge there's a huge limitation
of the personal responsibility put in the new CDC metrics.

help people understand what makes sense, uh, for their loved
ones and for themselves.
Um, but I think that, um, although it was jarring and,
and I wish that we had all had more of a heads up, that the
model is a step in the right direction, and, uh, they have
published a lot of the underlying modeling and assumptions,
and so the limitations, at least, are more clear than in
previous moments. So, so while I hear you, and while I share
my--share some of your concerns, um, I do think that we can
use this as part--as one of the tools in our toolbox to
assess community risk.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
LEE GIANETTI:

Lee.

Madam Mayor, just one, uh, last point

through you to the Councillors. Something that we also take

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And as Mr. Neal said, we will be trying to fill that gap to

into consideration when we're looking at our masks
requirements is also vaccination. When we think about the
very first mask ordinance that we put into place, we didn't
really have it. Even when we think about when we put this in
58
Packet Pg. 295

2

place, uh, I believe it was in September, our vaccination
rates in the community were much lower.
So that's another factor that comes in, um, to how

residents have responded. We know that it is a big burden
for people, and people take it very seriously, and we take
our work seriously as well. And as we move forward and the
mandate comes off, if and when in the future we need to put
a mandate back into place, we will just as if and when we
need to scale up testing again, we will.
And that is really what we've been trying to do, is
build resiliency in our processes, so as we need to respond
to anything future that comes, uh, through the pandemic,
we'll have the, uh, processes in place to do so.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan, and then

Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN: Thank you, Madam
Mayor. Through you, I, I, I just--I really do remain

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we're doing it. And we do really appreciate how our

concerned, and I, I understand, um, you know, why you, you
want to lift the mask mandate, but I, I think it, it still
would be better to do it in, in a more, uh, phased approach
and, you know, maybe lifted in some situations, but not
59
Packet Pg. 296

2

others in, in terms of, you know, places where, where people
congregate indoors, um, like grocery stores, for example.
I, I think it, it makes a lot of sense to, to keep a

transportation. So, you know, I, I understand the decision,
but I, I don't really feel comfortable with it. And, and the
case counts have, you know, stabilized at a, at a pretty
high level as, as was stated earlier. So, you know,
hopefully, they'll come down and, and we can all breathe
easier, but, um, I remain concerned about that.
And, you know, as you mentioned, the, the vaccination
rates, you know, the, the 92% is, is only four people
received one shot. If you go to fully vaccinated, we're
talking about 76% of eligible, which is closer to 70% of our
overall population because the, the young kids are not
eligible.
And then, you know, we were shown the booster data,
and, and there's still significant, uh, racial disparities

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

mask mandate just as we're keeping it on, on public

in that data as well--um, as well as age disparity. So, you
know, I, I think we're still at, at significant risk. And,
uh, you know, I, I'd like to understand how we're gonna
close the gap on, on the vaccination because it's, it's been
60
Packet Pg. 297

2

pretty stagnant over the last few weeks.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
DERRICK NEAL:

Chief.

Councilman, I, I think that we've been,

closing the gap. Uh, as I mentioned, the C3 corps, uh, we're
focusing on our most marginalized communities, those under
vaccinated communities, um, uh, really providing outreach to
those individuals who are hesitant, uh, at this point is
quite frankly, a slow crawl.
Uh, we're doing everything that we can to engage those
populations other than taking the vaccine to their door and
knocking on it. So, uh, I don't know how, you know--and I
can, you know, honestly speak to what other communities are
doing. I don't know if I've ever seen the community that was
as proactive as the City of Cambridge is in terms of, of
making, uh, vaccines the boosters available to, uh, all
populations. Uh, but again, that's why health promotion is
so important.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

uh, doing the yeoman's job along with the City in terms of

We have to continue to battle a lot of misinformation,
uh, that's out there that's preventing a lot of individuals
from, uh, receiving the vaccine. That's what we're up
against, uh, is misinformation from even two years ago. So,
61
Packet Pg. 298

2

uh, we're doing all that we can. We'll continue to, to beat
the streets, provide, uh, foot, foot soldiers, I call them,
uh, uh, that speak multiple languages that come from

Uh, but, uh, at this point, we don't foresee having,
uh, a huge group come to us for vaccines. We think it's,
it's winning one person over at a time. And that's been the
frustration of this pandemic, but that's also the reality.
But from a Public Health perspective, we look at this as an
opportunity. We'll continue to do what we have to do to
recruit those individuals and get them engaged, but we need
the community on board.
Uh, our Health Department is a team of, uh, 55
employees, but the City's standing with us, the Fire
Department is standing with us. We need the entire community
to, to stand with us and recruit their neighbor. That's what
we're up against, and that's just winning one citizen over,
uh, at a time. So, uh, I don't know how much more we can do,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

different walks of life to engage those populations.

uh, but we are certainly open to suggestions,
recommendations.
We'll go anywhere to see anyone in order to, uh,
protect our community because, uh, I can't say it enough,
62
Packet Pg. 299

2

this is a novel virus. We don't know everything about it,
and we won't know everything about it until it's run its
full course. So we don't even know what the devastation of

So, uh, we'll continue to, uh, provide that, that, that
outreach, uh, in all facets of, uh, our society, but it's a,
uh--it's a--it's a huge--it's a monumental task, as you're
well aware.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
LEE GIANETTI:

Lee.

Um, through you, Madam Mayor, uh, just

this morning, a couple of us were on a call with, uh,
Cambridge Fire. We're trying to envision a proposal for what
the next type of vaccination clinics could look for us. Um,
specifically we're looking at how we can use their mobile,
uh, bus to actually go to where people are.
So rather than having stationary ones that people need
to come to, how can we be partnering with events for us to
have a mobile vacs clinic there? How can we be partnering

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COVID is at this point, uh, other than what we've witnessed.

with the libraries to be in the neighborhoods? We saw what
the test distributions, how successful it was having, uh,
things being distributed in the neighborhoods. And we're
looking at, um, putting together proposals so we can go back
63
Packet Pg. 300

2

to the larger, um, Vacs ops team to say, here's what the
next iteration of, um, our vaccine clinics can be.
And that's really going out proactively into the

harder to reach, um, individuals. So we, we've started those
conversations and, um, hopefully, we'll have a more refined
update to be able to provide you at the next, uh, COVID
update.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Thank you, everyone who's been working on this for
a long time. Two years is a long time. Just a quick note on
that, uh, the metrics. The Council did pass a Policy Order,
Councillor McGovern's right, September 21st of last year,
asking for metrics to be reported back. I don't think we
actually got the specific metrics.
So it would be--I think part of what you're hearing is
we understand you use them to make the decision, make it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

community to be where people are, to start to reach the

explicit. When you read the actual guidance, it doesn't say
explicitly, these are the metrics we used. It does say,
because of community high transmission, we're continuing
this mask mandate for another two weeks. It just is helpful
64
Packet Pg. 301

2

for everybody, partly because then we know when we hit it,
what's going to happen.
So, I think that's really understanding. We asked for

If you can't be clear, then come back to us and say, we
can't always be clear, but here's what we're gonna use. I
think it's really important, we're all on the same team, and
we want to be able to communicate this to people.
And I, and the Mayor, and the Vice Mayor wrote it, and
the whole Council passed it unanimously, but we didn't even
have a clear answer on those metrics. Um, I do have a
question, which is we saw in, in--it's--we're in this really
odd position, right? It's come down 90%, and it's still, the
case rate is still far higher than last summer.
So--and we're lifting the mask mandate, and we're
hoping to get back to normal. I understand it's partly
because of the severity of the disease, there's less
hospitalization, there's certainly--thankfully, there's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

it formally, it wasn't ever clear what those metrics were.

been--there have been a couple more deaths, but it is--it is
in a different stage. The concern is on those numbers, the
recent numbers, as was also noted.
Young people have a case rate that is three times the
65
Packet Pg. 302

2

next highest, the 20 to 29-year-old case rate is more than
three times the case rate of the next highest, which are the
zero to 19-year-olds, many of whom can't even be vaccinated.

message out? Because those people--those are also the ones I
think that have the less boosting, the less, um, exposure
to, to the vaccine.
So I would just like us all to understand how it is
that we can get, that young group can get it, and to get the
word out it. I myself know, we all know people who not only
got COVID, but people with long COVID. And that's not
something you just say, oh, I'll get it and it'll be--the
severity will be not that great. Right, but you could also
be in the 10% of vaccinated people actually have long COVID,
and we don't even know as we've heard what the impact is.
So I think my question partly is, are we targeting and
how are we making sure that we get at that age group?
Because I know my kids are in that age group, and I know

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So are we getting the message out? How are we getting the

some of them are a little bit wary, or for whatever reason,
are not doing what we hope they'll do.
LEE GIANETTI:

Councillor, I'll turn it over to, um, to

the Chief Public Officer. But I do want to just acknowledge
66
Packet Pg. 303

2

that I hear you on the metrics piece, and I'll talk to the
City Manager about that. But I wanted to acknowledge that I
hear what you and Councillor McGovern and Councillor

DERRICK NEAL:

Yes, Councilman Nolan, um, we've worked

closely with--and I'll, I'll let Anna expand on this in a-in a minute. Uh, we've worked closely with the, uh, the
teams at Harvard. Uh, we're working closely with the school
system as well. Dr. Dobberteen is, uh, is hand in sync with
the, uh, Superintendent. So we're, we're--we have a, a
partnership going on with those, uh, entities, uh, in, in
terms of making sure that dialogue is open, that we're
communicating clear guidance to not only the students, but
the parents.
Um, we, we talked, um--we, we talked, talked a lot
about, uh, using social media and leveraging that, um, but
again, uh, we--there's always room for improvement in terms
of, uh, how we convey the message and what messages that we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Zondervan has mentioned tonight regarding the metrics.

are conveying to, to the--to the public in general. I've,
I've always said, in my 30 years of Public Health, the most
powerful tool that we have is health promotion.
And health promotion is just education. And we are able
67
Packet Pg. 304

2

to educate people. They can make empowered decisions. And so
that's what we're focused on. Our challenge is, is that, um,
and, and I hate to bring this in here, uh, that the pandemic

like you said, I was an individual who had long COVID, I
suffered with COVID for six months, and I was telling myself
that I was better and, and I wasn't better until I got
better.
So I understand, uh, what, what you're talking about.
And then I learned later that I had some scarring on my
heart. So that's why I'm such a big proponent about talking
about--and I talked to Dr. Dobberteen about this often--um,
speaking about, I don't, you, we don't know everything about
it. We don't know what it's already cost us. And just
because I feel okay now doesn't mean that I'm okay.
So I certainly understand what you're talking about.
Uh, Public Health understands your hesitancy in going back
to normal, because it doesn't take much for us to get back

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

has just been politicized with a lot of misinformation. And

to where we were just a couple of months ago. And at some
point, it's gonna be a diminishing return where we are not
gonna be able to continue to bounce back. So, um, again, we
need to do a better job of educating.
68
Packet Pg. 305

2

Uh, we're partnering with those high risk groups, those
ages that you're speaking of, working closely with Harvard.
So I do want to turn it over to, um, Anna and Dr.

insights to what we're doing. So through you, Councillor
Nolan and Mayor Siddiqui, I want to go to, uh, uh, Anna and,
uh, Dr. Dobberteen so they can give us more insight on, uh,
what we're doing from a proactive outreach basis.
ANNA KAPLAN: Thank you, Derrick. Through you, Madam
Mayor, um, I will just take this opportunity to plug our
upcoming clinic at the Reservoir Church. It's after school
hours. Um, it's in the backyard of, of the Banneker School,
and we're happy to have anyone there, um, for first shot,
second shot, booster. Um, we had a lovely time there three
weeks ago. We did, uh, I think, seven first doses. Um, and
so, I just, uh, yeah.
As has been shared, we're, we're here, um, for, for one
person, for seven, for, you know--we'll hope for more, but

Dobberteen, because they can give you some, some specific

we really are content, even if we were just to provide one
vaccine, um, that that's how we--how we beat this virus is
person by person. Um, and I will, uh, defer to the, the
amazing expertise of, uh, of Dr. Dobberteen, uh, an amazing

pediatrician, and so in touch with the schools and the
amazing work that's been happening there.
LISA DOBBERTEEN, MD:

Thank you, Anna. And through you,

outreach to the group that is the least boosted and the
least vaccinated. And I think that we see, um, typical young
people risk-taking behavior manifesting itself in lower
rates of vaccine acceptance.
And we are doing everything we can to combat that with
education, um, efforts at the school level with, uh,
vaccines being offered at the Teen Health Center, um,
enlisting the help of the, uh, high school members of the
School Committee, um, robust social media promotion of
vaccines and our vaccine clinics. And the same thing for
also the 20 to 29-year-olds if they're enrolled in schools,
we are counting on our school partners to do that.
And I should say, although we've mentioned the uptake
in cases in our university settings, where we are not at all

Madam Mayor, to you Councillor Nolan, um, we continue to

feeling that they are not doing enough, they are doing their
share and more in, uh, COVID prevention and they have mask
mandates and they have vaccine requirements on the campus.
So they are doing everything they can.
70
Packet Pg. 307

2

Human behavior is a variable, and I think we're seeing
some of that. But we're also trying to reach the age cohort
of 20 to 29 who are not enrolled in our local schools and

to try and encourage them all to come to get boosted. So if
any of the listening public is in those age ranges, you
know, please join us and we'd be happy to give you a
booster.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thanks. I am not so not

in that age range, but I just think if you do a TikTok
challenger and ask every, you know--we went to hair cutters
to combat domestic violence, and it was really successful.
If we go to bartenders across the City and say, get every
single person, we're gonna give them a free shot if they get
a booster, I mean, there's just--there's got to be ways to
get those 20 to 29 year olds there.
And I know we try to be creative. We already did the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

colleges, um, by social media and other ways of outreaching

vaccine. I was in Harvard Square one time. There was someone
there, the one and done, you know, it was a year ago or so,
let's do more of that, but--because then we can go back to
normal. And I'm not--I'm just worried about getting those
71
Packet Pg. 308

2

boosters in those arms because we know that that really,
really does matter.
So I thank you all for your work on that and hope that,

Chief of Staff there in that age group. He could help us
with some social media campaign. Not to call them out too
much, but, uh--or I can ask my kids and see what they say.
Thank you.
DERRICK NEAL:

We're certainly open to, to TikTok. Uh,

and one of the things that I was incredibly impressed with,
and I want to--I want to give, give, uh, them applaud, uh,
uh, during the most recent vaccine clinic that the, the
Mayor had the opportunity to come out to, uh, our
firefighters went around the neighborhood and knocked on
doors. I've never seen that before in, in my, my career.
And the thing that's most impressive about Cambridge is
not good enough to get an A here. You want an A ++. And, and
that's--and that's a great thing, but to see firemen, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

you know, use, use the young people. I, I, I see the Mayor's

that are door-knocking, uh, doing something that's not
traditional to their everyday work is extremely impressive.
So, uh, we, we have the willingness collectively as a
community to do it, uh, but again, we have to continue to

challenge ourself in setting the bar even higher than what
we've normally said it.

Thank you, Madam

and, and, uh, list of programs, but it, it does show that at
the end of the day, you know, there's only so much that we
can ask of our, uh, Police Department to do in this regard,
because ultimately, we need to be creating a lot more
economic opportunities and, and new, new jobs.
And obviously, you know, we we're not asking the Police
Department to solve that problem for us. So I hope that
we'll, you know, continue to dig down on that. And the, um,
City of Boston just made some interesting announcements
around the Green New Deal that they're proposing efforts at
the state level. And, and of course, there's efforts in
Cambridge that the Council's working on to create green
jobs. And that's just one particular area that we can do
more, but we really need to dig down on, on creating more

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Vice Mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, I just wanted to pull these all together because as we
know, we, um, had some charter amendments on the, uh, ballot
77
Packet Pg. 314

2

last November that passed. And one of the--one of the things
we get to do now, and somebody mentioned it in, uh, public
comment as we have this power over approving or not

However, we haven't set up any parameters, uh, around
that process. And I think at this point it would probably be
prudent for us to charter right these items in order to give
us some time to try to develop, um, whether we are gonna put
together those parameters in a committee or some, some
fashion, um, so that we're all on the same page.
It doesn't have anything to do with the folks that are
being nominated here tonight for these Boards and
Commissions. It's just we need to take a pause as a Council
and really review and reflect on what this new, um, power of
the City Council will do and how we want to work with the
Manager to be, ensure that we get, um, candidates, uh, put
forward that are reflective of our diverse community.
So I'm gonna try to write these items tonight in order

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

approving of, um, Boards and Commission members.

to have a conversation with, uh, the City Manager and some
of my colleagues to try to figure out the best path forward.
So, I'm gonna exercise my charter right on all those items
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So the Vice Mayor's exercised
78
Packet Pg. 315

2

charter right. So, we will go to Item Number 9, which is
transmitting a communication with Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the appropriation of $650,000 from free

Service programs, extraordinary expenditures account to
provide necessary repairs to three swimming pool located at
the War Memorial pool facility. Councillor Nolan, you have
the floor.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Through you, hold on, let me look at my notes. Um,
this, uh, is an important item for us to have that wonderful
City asset be available. I was just curious because we last
did a complete renovation and rehabilitation of the building
that was done by 2009, and it seems like a relatively, uh,
short amount of time.
I, I did reach out to a commercial architect on
commercial pools who said, it seems like a, a relatively
short amount of time before this level of change would be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

cash to the Public Investment Fund Department of Human

needed. So I'm curious as to whether there was any discovery
of some work that had been overlooked or was it not work
that was up to the standards that we would expect it for
this to last long enough? Or, or what was the reasons for
79
Packet Pg. 316

2

this, uh, large expenditure, um, of, of something that
presumably should have lasted for more than 12 years?
DAVID KALE:

Through you, Mayor Siddiqui, uh, to

line. I am not certain that the extent to the, uh, tile work
was done when we renovated the high school. So unless Adam
knows the answer to that question, but I do know that based
upon the repairs that were done last summer, uh, the tile
work was identified as a need and that, uh, that's why we're
coming before you.
Um, so I do not know what the, uh, extent to the tile
work was done when the high school was, uh, renovated, but,
uh, Adam's on the line or, or Ellen, do you have an answer
to that question? Because I'm not sure it was done at that
time, but you can correct me if I'm wrong.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah. And just point of-

-just to clarify, the, the high school project, obviously,
as you know, was separate. There was a War Memorial project

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Nolan, Adam Corbeil and Ellen Semonoff are on the

that was done in 2009. So even though it's connected to the
high school, this is separate from the high school, although
there was the, the cogen facility that should have been put
in the War Memorial that ended up being in the high school
80
Packet Pg. 317

2

related to the pool. But if we have an answer, that would be
good.
ADAM CORBEIL: Uh, through you, Madam Mayor, um, I

replaced, um, during that renovation that you're talking
about. I'll certainly look into it. Um, if I had a guess, it
would be that it was not, because, uh, part of the thing
that we're asking to do here is to upgrade some drains so
that they, uh, fit within, uh, Virginia Grand Baker, uh,
Pool Act.
And I would imagine, um, per the law, uh, that we
would've replaced the--um, those drains at the same time,
um, because anytime there's a significant amount of work
that's done, um, on the interior of pool surface, um, that
would've had to have been taken care of at that time. But
I'll certainly look into it.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M.NOLAN: Yeah. If this is timely, I
don't want to hold it up, but I don't want to extend

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

cannot specifically state that the grout and tile was

discussion. If it's not, then I can try to write it and we
can get an answer. I don't know the timeliness of this. But
I also, the other question I had is whether this will be out
of use for the entire summer of 2022, because even though
81
Packet Pg. 318

2

that would preserve it for the school year, that is very
well used during the summer.
DAVID KALE:

So, I'll let Adam answer the second

Councillor Nolan, the reason why we're up tonight is because
our ability to advertise this and bid it out and to make
sure we get a vendor who can actually do the work in the
summer is time dependent. And so if it's delayed and now
won't, if--this is--it will be delayed another week, frankly
it's a week we probably don't have.
So to the extent that we can move forward so we can
start the, uh, requirements to bid this out so that we don't
lose a week or two, uh, is important because, uh, as you
know, uh, getting vendors who are interested in doing work,
uh, who, who are booking their business right now is, uh, at
a premium. So we would say that we'll get you the answer
when the work is done, but we would respectfully ask not to
hold this up.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

question about logistics. But through you, Mayor, to

And then--and part of the reason why we don't want to
hold it up is because we want to have this work done in the
summer so that the pool is not, uh, out of action in the
fall. So, Adam, anything else to add to that?
82
Packet Pg. 319

2

ADAM CORBEIL: Yeah, just that, um, I think that the
usable life of the grout, um, regardless of the last time it
was replaced, is definitely, um, is definitely up. Uh, in

uh, we'd be looking to handle those at the Gold Star pool.
Um, you know, we're able to run camp swims, uh, swim
lessons, uh, and a general swim, as well as, uh, um, uh,
swim recovery program and partnership with Cambridge Public
Schools to, um, recoup some of the swim lessons that were
lost, um, as a product of the pandemic and having to close,
uh, throughout that time. So we expect to be able to handle
the workload, um--or sorry, the, the bather load, um, at the
Gold Star pool this summer.
Uh, and that's part of the strategy here. And I would
agree with, um, uh, Mr. Kale, that, uh, time is of the
essence. Uh, when we are trying to get this scheduled, it
would be down for a duration of, uh, four to six weeks. So
we have planned probably on the, the, um, longer end of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

regard to, uh, services that we provide at the War Memorial,

that, um, estimating for six weeks.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Okay. Thank you. I won't

charter right it. I will move forward, but I do hope to get
the full answer about what it is that, uh, that the timing
83
Packet Pg. 320

2

and the, you know, 12 years ago, because my recollection was
that it was a full-scale rehabilitation. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, I, I have, uh, very similar questions.
I, I don't really understand, um, what's happening here. And
you know, I, I understand the urgency, so I, I'll certainly
both are supported, but I, I think we, we do need some
answers here because, you know, I'm looking at an
appropriation from June, 2021, where we appropriated
$267,000 for to $760,000, um, repair in maintenance at the
War Memorial pool. And now we're asked to appropriate
$650,000. So, what's happening here that we are suddenly
needing to spend so much money on maintaining this facility?
DAVID KALE:

So through you, Mayor Siddiqui, to

Councillor Zondervan, the appropriation that the Council
approved last fiscal year was, frankly, for underneath the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Zondervan, and then Councillor McGovern.

pool for the piping, the guts of the pool underneath what
you see. And so that had deteriorated to the point where we
needed to do repairs and replacement. And this is a totally
different project.
84
Packet Pg. 321

2

And that was again, um, as we were doing renovations,
uh, at the pool last summer, uh, this need was identified at
that time. And, uh, that's why we're before you again. So,

point, it was two different projects and two different
needs.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Adam.

ADAM CORBEIL: Through you, Madam Mayor, uh, that's
absolutely correct. Um, that was foundational work, uh,
where we chipped away a lot of the, um, uh, rotten concrete
and, uh, did some rebar work, um, and fixed the foundation.
And then the circulating systems, uh, that run in and out of
the pool, um, we fixed those in total.
This is more, uh, toward the nature of the tile and
grout that you'd see on the surface as he walked into the
pool, um, which is, you know, typical replacement. I've
heard from, uh, pool companies and people who have varying
numbers about this, it's between 10 to 15 years before you

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Adam can speak to the, um, any other issues, but at that

want to start specking it out replacing it again.
Um, so it does seem like it's within the range of what
we should expect, um, for tile replacement. But, um, it's
definitely something that was noticeable and to the point
85
Packet Pg. 322

2

where we had, uh, a company take a look at it, um, while the
pool work was going on this summer. Um, and they found that
it should be done.
Councillor Zondervan, and then

Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. And

through you, Madam Mayor, I appreciate that answer. I guess
I'm still a little bit surprised that if, if this was
discovered last summer, why we didn't hear that sooner
instead of now being suddenly presented with this $600,000
bill that we have to approve now in order to get the work
done over summer?
I think, you know, speaking for myself and my
colleagues, I think we would appreciate, um, you know, some-a bit of a heads up with what we should be expecting in
terms of maintenance to this facility, and, and, you know,
as much as possible, having that, uh, be part of the budget
rather than, uh, these pre-cash appropriations. Can you

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

think about that?
ELLEN SEMONOFF:

Through you, Madam Mayor, I just want

to say we fully appreciate what you're saying. I think we
believed that we were not necessarily going to do that this
86
Packet Pg. 323

2

summer, that we were gonna include this in the capital
budget process. And then as we developed it, it seemed like
this was the moment that it made the most sense to do it. So

have given you a longer window and then included it as a
part of our regular capital.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

McGovern, and then Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Uh, thank, thank you,

Madam Mayor, through you. Um, I'm happy to vote for this
tonight. Uh, certainly given the, the time constraints that,
um, Mr. Kale, uh, pointed out, I do think it's, um--you
know, I think it's, it's, it's great that we can do this.
Um, you know, we can have upgrade and update and, and, and,
uh, repair our, our facilities.
Um, just a, a question or, or just a comment to, to
Adam, and you may not want my help, but, um, I agree with
Councillor Nolan about the, you know, but we're a little

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we do understand that we would have much better, like to

worried about the summer and the, and the usage of the
pools. And I think Gold Star will probably be used an awful
lot, not just for, for programming, but people from the
neighborhood going and, and, and using the pool.
87
Packet Pg. 324

2

So, um, you know, I, I'd be happy to help and you, you
may not need it, but, um, this could be an opportunity to
reach out to MIT and, and Harvard, whose students won't be

get some community time at there, pools and facilities.
Um, it would certainly be nice of them to cooperate
with us on that, and maybe the American can work her magic.
Um, but, uh, you know, I think making sure that we not only
have room for the programming, but we also have enough room
for people who just want to show up and swim, um, maybe we
can work with them for--to help us out for six weeks.
Thanks.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

It's a good suggestion.

Councillor Carlone,
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, um, what Adam has reported is my
knowledge of pool life as well, especially public pools
where a lot of people use it, and therefore, uh, chemicals

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

around, uh, as, uh, as much in the summer, and see if we can

are in the water, um, that have an effect on the mortar. And
if you don't deal with it and tiles start, start popping
off, then you have a much more severe problem.
So this is maintenance, and yeah, it's expensive, but
88
Packet Pg. 325

2

it is three pools and knowing the City, they're gonna do it
right. They're not gonna just patch here and there. Um, so I
expect this is a major job, um, requiring, um, well, as was

voting for this, and it makes sense to me. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I see no other speakers on

this. So we can go ahead and do a roll call in the
appropriation for the pool.
City Clerk Anthony Wilson called the roll:

Cambridge, retaining its AAA rating, bond rating from the
nation's three major credit rating agencies. Councillor
Toner, you have the floor.
Yes. Thank you. Madam Mayor,

I just wanted to say congratulations to the City Manager
and, uh, uh, uh, David Kale and his team for, uh, once
again, uh, getting an excellent credit rating report from,
uh, external sources. I, I, I think it's a credit to the
City and all the people who have done excellent work to, to
make sure that we have, uh, a great, you know, fiscal, um,
just in great shape fiscally, especially after two years of
a pandemic and all the challenges we've had. So thank you
very much. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Carlone,

and then Councillor McGovern, and then Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

As, uh, budget co-chairs with Councillor Nolan, we've talked
to the, uh, Fiscal staff and the Manager and have an outline

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

of just some--of an overview of this effort that, um, Mr.
Kale will be talking about tonight. Uh, those of you who
have been on the Council a while will know that, um, we've-this has happened many years in a row.
90
Packet Pg. 327

2

We're one of approximately 26 cities in the United
States that have this AAA rating by three different, uh,
agencies. The City has been in that, uh, family of cities

million of obligation bonds have been sent out, and that's
paid for a slew of capital projects. David might want to
highlight it or we can during the budget.
And the goal of this is, of course, is to get the most
favorable interest rate, which saves money in the long run.
And part of the reasons the agency's feel this way is we
have ample excess levy capacity, uh, under proposition two
and a half, and gives us flexibility, uh, in our planning.
Um, and why this comes about is because of the City's
fiscal--sound fiscal policies, which is greatly appreciated
by the agencies.
I will add that, um, before COVID hit, we were gonna
have a discussion on exactly this process, um, how much
money does this, this approach save an interest during the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

since 1999, and during this most recent year, uh, $92.3

year, um, explaining, uh, what other cities, uh, have
succeeded in getting this, how they approach things.
And I think in, in the coming year, we definitely need
to do this to, uh, better understand how important this is
91
Packet Pg. 328

2

and consider, um, options, if any. But I know, uh, Mr. Kale,
uh, representing the entire fiscal staff is here to discuss
it more. And hopefully, I've given enough of, uh, an

highlight. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
DAVID KALE:

Mr. Kale.

Thank you, Councillor Carlone. Through

you, Mayor Siddiqui, as, uh, Co-Chair of the Finance
Committee, Carlone mentioned, we are in the rare company of
26 cities who received triple AAA's, and as he, noted that
is since 1999. Um, and I think one of the things that the
City Council and the City Administration should be proud of,
that we've been able to do that, uh, and over the last two
years has not been easy with COVID and the financial
challenges that have faced the City to maintain the things
that the rating agencies look for.
And again, the things that they look for are, are
financial, uh, uh, flexibility and having adequate reserves

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

introduction, but he will fill in any area that I failed to

and, uh, carefully monitoring our revenues and expenditures.
And again, we've been able to do that over the last two
years and, and we've been able to, uh, hopefully, uh,
weather the storm, hopefully the, uh, dark clouds will be
92
Packet Pg. 329

2

leaving us, and we will go back to, uh, whatever the new
normal may be.
Um, in addition to that, um, um, we've been able to,

allocate resources for affordable housing, uh, school
services, library expansion, uh, small business programs,
traffic initiatives, open space, and, uh, climate
initiatives, despite, uh, the choppiness of the fiscal
climate.
And, uh, we would also, um, note that, uh, we are
selling $92.3 million in geo bonds, uh, tomorrow. And
hopefully, we will receive, uh, a favorable rate. Um, and we
have, uh, funding in this year's bond issue, uh, for the,
uh, fire headquarters construction, additional repairs at
fire stations, street and sidewalk reconstruction, uh, River
Street Project, sewer, and, um, uh, streets.
The Tobin School, which again will begin, uh, a multiyear large investment to, uh, support the construction of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

over the last two years and longer, been able to, uh,

the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Upper School
Construction Project. Uh, other school improvement projects,
um, municipal facilities project as our MFIP Project, sewer
reconstruction repairs, and climate change projects.
93
Packet Pg. 330

2

Um, again, uh, we've been able to have a multi-year
plan that will call for, uh, similar investments in those
areas over the next four years. Um, and again, I think, uh,

the City's strong financial position, uh, a large and stable
diverse tax base, ample excess levy capacity, budgetary
flexibility, and strong and experienced manager team, which
includes the City Council, because again, collectively,
we've been very consistent in terms of what we do.
And, uh, that is a joint effort with the City Council,
and it's very important to be consistent and have
predictability. Um, and again, I don't think any of us take
this for granted because it is something that we should be
proud of, but it's also a reflection of the hard work. And
again, I will take this time, Mayor, just to thank the team,
because this is not done, um, in a vacuum.
It's a multi-departmental effort, uh, to, um, uh, put
together the presentation document for the rating agencies,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

as you read the Rating Agency reports, um, they highlighted

but also, uh, put together the official statement. And, um,
and again, I just want to, uh, uh, thank Michelle Kincaid,
who's our Assistant Finance Director, Tyler Jennings, our
Budget Director, Angela Pierre, our Deputy Budget Director,
94
Packet Pg. 331

2

uh, Gayle Willette, our chief, um--a Chair of the Assessing
Department, Andrew Johnson, the Deputy, Walter Pernell, Lee
Gianetti, our Communications Director, Iram Farooq, our

works in the CD Department as a planner.
In addition to that, the auditing staff, uh, led by Jim
Monigle. Again, this is a, uh, multifaceted approach to
provide the information that we're, um, um, asked to provide
to make sure that we can receive this rating. And as I think
you've said to--heard me say before, um, the things that the
rating agencies look for is stable and consistent
management, strong economy, which includes employment
stability, uh, having a, a, a significant base of principal
employers in the City, low unemployment rate, uh, high
personal income, assess valuations that are growing, as well
as, um, local economic trends and development and, uh,
construction activity.
And again, uh, strong financial, uh, and budgetary

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Community Development Director, and Cliff Cook, um, who

performance with regard to our financial statements and our
balance sheet, free cash, and reserves, as Councillor
Carlone mentioned. And in addition to that, our ability to
manage our debt, to be able to provide funding for major
95
Packet Pg. 332

2

initiatives in the City, um, as well as cover our long term
obligations such as the unfunded pension liability.
So, again, if you put those things together, I think

Council. And I know that the City Manager, um, uh, over his
career, as he says at the rating agencies, that is one of
the most important things that we present, we do a lot of
important things, but I think our ability to demonstrate,
um, our planning and our oversight, I think is one of the
things that he's been most proud of in his tenure as City
Manager and, uh, Finance Director. So, um, I'm probably a
little bit longer than he would've been, so I apologize. But
again, we're very proud of this and so should the Council,
and we hope to be able to continue this in the future. Thank
you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor

McGovern, and then Councillor Zondervan.

Madam Mayor, I don't think you were longer than the manager

and thanks to all the staff and all the--all of you who

Councillor Carlone, I, I agree completely that I think if we
could do some kind of town hall information session as to
why this is important, because I really don't think folks

Um, and it goes beyond the capital projects, right?
That's the most direct link because we can borrow money at a
much, you know, cheaper interest rate and whatnot. And, and
that helps us do things like the schools and the sidewalks,
but it's also the ripple effect of just having that level of
financial stability in the City that is attractive to people
wanting to come here and do business here.
And, you know, on one hand, you know, we often hear,
well, why do we pay so much attention to this? And why does
it matter so much? And we shouldn't pay so much attention to
this, followed by a list of $300 to $400 million worth of
spending that people want us to, to, to spend.
We got to connect those dots for folks, because you
know, it is--um, this is really important because it allows

totally understand it.

us to do so many of the things that we, we want to do and,
and even have the discussions to do things that, um, you
know, maybe we're not doing yet, but even the possibility of
us being able to do because we have this financial
97

stability.
So, um, it's really something we should be proud of.
And, uh, it does take work. It doesn't happen automatically.

and we all--we haven't always been as financially stable.
And then Councillor Toner and I were, were roughly the same
age and we were in elementary school in the '70s and we're
in school buildings that were not exactly, uh, the best
condition.
And we both come from families of teachers and remember
teachers getting pink slipped every year because, uh, we
never knew how much money we were gonna have and how many
teachers we could bring back. I mean, that, that was a
reality in this City, um, before, uh, this happened. And,
and, you know, I can't remember the last time we laid off
teachers in this City or, or, or did something like that.
So, um, this is a good thing and, and it takes work
and, and, um, so thank you for that, and thank you to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, you know, we've had Harvard and MIT here for a long time

everybody and your staff. Uh, thank you to Councillor
Carlone and Councillor Nolan as finance chairs, and I look
forward to that conversation because I think it's a really
important to help the community understand why this is so
98

important and why we should be so proud of it. Thank you
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

congratulations and also call for a town hall or info
session so that we can all learn more about, um, this
achievement. But I will say that, you know, there is a, a
difference between a AAA bond rating and being, uh,
financially stable. And, you know, it's certainly true that
AAA bond rating is like an A plus.
You know, it's a, it's a very, um, high grade that
we're receiving, but that doesn't mean that we couldn't
spend more money and, and do more to help marginalize people
in, in our City. And we also have to grapple with the fact
that the, the commercial development boom, that that really,
uh, powers our financial, um, stability, also fueled
gentrification and displacement, uh, among our residents.
And, you know, I did note in the report that the, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. Through you, certainly, here my colleagues,

environmental risks of the City were, were significantly
downplayed. But, you know, we, we just received a, another
gloom and doom IPCC report today from the United Nations
about the threats of climate change, uh, to, to our, our
99
Packet Pg. 336

2

planet.
So, you know, there's, there's a lot to balance there
between our economic system and, and the adjustments and

to the environment and to the climate in the process. So I,
I look forward to deeper conversations about those straight
offs and to, you know, getting, getting some handle on how
we can do better while continuing to, uh, perform well
fiscally. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. I think we've heard

from anyone who wants to speak, and I completely agree with
all of the speakers, and so I don't have much to add, but

note this comes out of, just to remind people of the history
of a, a zoning petition put forth in 2018, which was, uh,
not put forward by the Council with the idea that there's a
lot of good ideas here. But instead of that, let's put

to, uh, refer this to the Health and Environment Committee

overall, uh, guidance and blessing on the direction, uh, as
we frame the zoning language. Uh, we would like to have a
similar discussion with the Planning Board, uh, but we can

this report being finalized for the last 10 months since the

So it'd be good before that meeting to make sure that,

staff, I'll certainly communicate this with, with the, the
staff to say at that meeting, it would be good to hear from
the Zoning Resiliency Task Force about their sense of, of,
of this petition. But it seems to me, let's--we can move
forward and refer it now, we'll host a meeting.

know, I'll note that this task force, of course, came out of
a zoning petition that was filed almost four years ago. And
at the time when the task force was created, it was mandated
to produce a draft zoning within 90 days.

out talking about the process that we did not use, which is
to have a Charter Commission elected.
We actually used a different--a different method. And
I'm not sure if this, uh, through you to the City Solicitor,
105

what this represents in terms of review of all the towns,
because I know that, that, obviously, there's been many
other towns, uh, who have been engaged in this. But I'm, I'm

then look forward to working together to have some ordinance
language in, in place for us to move forward on this
important issue.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, we can, um--I think, you

know, this provides some examples and it seems from the
research that the Law Department was unable to find any
ordinances in other municipalities establishing a charter
reprocess that could be used, um, by the City's Special
Committee. But because of that, the Law Department can draft
a guidance for our review and consideration. And we will
also follow up and try to give you some further guidance on
that as well. So I don't see any--let me just look one
second. I see Councillor Zondervan, and then no one else in
the chamber. Councillor Zondervan.

already. So I'm a little bit unclear why we're saying we, we
106
Packet Pg. 343

2

don't--you know, we, we need to receive ordinance language
later because it seems like we already have that before us
in Calendar Number 4.
What we can do is suspend the

rules to bring that forward, um, and then we'll also have to
vote too. We can do it in the same vote, Clerk, to take that
off the table? So let's do that now.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

This is the--so vote will

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Calendar Item Number 4 is

So we have Calendar Item Number

4 before us as well. Councillor Zondervan has, uh, stated
that there is some of the language that's before us, um,
that was drafted. I think in conversations, and Councillor
Nolan that you can chime in, I think we had wanted--I think
we really wanted a little bit more guidance around what
other cities were doing to inform said ordinance, and then
to be able to re-look at the ordinance language that had
been drafted.
And Councillor Nolan, I think our conversation had been
to work on additional language based on what the Law
Department had, um, further provided to us in response. So,
Councillor Zondervan, you are right that there is language
before us. I think there's a question on, is this the
language based on what other, uh, cities and towns are

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes. Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. And through you to Councillor Zondervan, and the,
the Council, part of our question about reviewing this

Packet Pg. 345

2

language is, for instance, particularly on establishing the
Charter Review Commission. It doesn't say how many people
would be in it.

discussing and proposing a specific number. Um, most other
ways that Charter Review Commissions are formed also specify
just categories, you know, how many residents, how many
representatives from, from the Council, while our charter
specifies it wouldn't be an elected official. That doesn't
mean there wouldn't be a representative from the Council on
it, for instance.
And, and since that's not specified in this language of
the ordinance, it seems premature to pass this into
ordinance. I, I, I think the one about City Manager's
performance, if we felt that that was brought enough and,
uh, we didn't need anything more specific, then that would
certainly be something we could pass if it was the will of
the body of the Council.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And that seems to be a key factor that we should be

And I think there was also some

further desire--and we'll go to Councillor Toner after we go
back to Councillor Zondervan. There's further desire to also
discuss, you know, this, this process, uh, in ordinance and

so forth. Go ahead, Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you. Yeah, I, I was--I was gonna suggest that

Ordinance Committee and then we can, uh, work out the
language with the Solicitor, and, and, uh, move forward from
there.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We can do that. I have

Councillor Toner next.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. With

all due respect to Councillor Zondervan, I, I keep hearing
that the Ordinance Committee's not always the best place to
hash things out. And I'm just curious if there's an
opportunity to at least come up with some sort of a draft
with more specificity before we bring it to the Ordinance
Committee and are able to have discussions. And I'm not sure
what the proper, uh, committee or platform would be to do
that prior.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

maybe what we should do is, is uh, refer this matter to the

Our Gov Ops Committee is a

little busy, uh, at the moment, um, but that is an option to
discuss it there. Or what we have done in the future is--in

2

um, some additional language changes. And then there's
usually, uh, we, we recess and can have additional ordinance
meeting to further discuss.

a motion to refer, so I think we do have to dispose of that.
And if that fails, then if you have a motion to refer to
Government Ops, we can do that as well. And I know that
Councillor Azeem has his hand up too. So we'll go to
Councillor Azeem, and then go ahead and vote on the motion
Councillor Azeem,
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, I just wanted to say that

in this specific case, I would support, uh, going directly
to ordinance, just because I feel like the narrow broads of
like what is possible based on a ballot initiative is fairly
defined, whereas in other cases, there's a lot of options
around what you would want to pass and how you could be
creative. I think it's more limited here, so it makes sense
to go to ordinance.

said, I would be happy to host it in Government Ops if
that's the will of this body. Thank you.

Zondervan's motion to refer to ordinance, and also place the

Thank you, Madam Mayor. I, I

didn't want to make any assumptions, so I just wanted to ask
the City Solicitor what impact the Attorney General's, uh,

CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor,

um, technically, this opinion of the Attorney General does
not have any binding, u authority over the City of
Cambridge. Um, cities are able to pass ordinances under, um,
their powers, where towns in Massachusetts must submit
bylaws to the Attorney General for review and approval
before they can take effect.
So this is the second time the town of Brookline has
submitted something similar with respect to wanting to
regulate, um, onsite fuel--fossil fuel, um, use and
infrastructure. And this is the second time the Attorney
General has said that this approach exceeds the home rule
powers, um, of the, uh, town of Brookline because, uh, the
authority to regulate such matters rests with the state.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

ruling had on this particular, uh, item.

To the extent that this relates to the advice I have
previously provided to the Council, this opinion is
consistent with what I have previously told the Council that
I too believe that under the existing law, um, such an
116
Packet Pg. 353

2

approach here in Cambridge, uh, would exceed the City's
authority under state law, because it is the authority--the
state has the authority to regulate such things.

the Council right now, but this is consistent with what I
have said previously, and it's consistent with the prior
decision of the Attorney General with respect to a similar
approach that Brookline took previously.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Toner. All set?

Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Yes, we--I

still think this is the right thing to do, and yet, in light
of the decision that came out on Friday, we are just gonna
offer to--we have to place this on file because of the
unfortunate, disturbing, and some people, including some
legal opinion, are saying it's not exactly as the City
Solicitor said, cities are in a different position. However,
there is now a public legal opinion suggesting that this is

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, so that, that doesn't change anything in front of

not right.
So our intention with this was, was to say to the
Council, we need to place this on file. If at some point
anything changes, we could bring it back. But right now, I,
117

I think this is not something that we can move forward with.

worse off than the previous week's understanding on the

be legally done with what somebody wishes could be legally
done. And I don't think it's quite fair to categorize the
Attorney General as somehow being anti-environment, um,
because of this decision, knowing her record.
So, um, let's figure out how to do it legally, if this
isn't the legal way to do it, and then let's--and then let's
do that. Um, but, uh, you know, let's not confuse, you know-sometimes you can't do what you want to do and you need to
change the law. So let's, let's work on that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, I don't think any--in my

opinion, I don't think anyone's confusing anything. It's
just a thought, uh, that it is just still disappointing. So

hopeful for the future. Go ahead, Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

I just want to confirm,

as the City Solicitor said, and others, by tying this to the
State Building Code, that makes it very different. It wasn't

just towns can't do this. It seemed to be--and you're right,
Mayor Siddiqui, I know you've worked on this, the Council's
worked on this. It's, it's sad that we can't move forward.

seems like this is not a path right now we can take, which
is quite distressing to many of us who, who live.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Again, just a, a couple of legal questions. We've heard a
lot of testimony, we've all gotten a number of emails, uh,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And Councillor Toner, excuse

me, I want to just read it.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Oh, sorry.

It's the Policy Order 11 is

amendment to Chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Code of Ordinance
Entitled Historic Buildings and Landmarks. This was filed by
Councillor McGovern and Councillor Simmons. Go ahead,
Councillor Toner.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Sure. And thank you. And

Madam Solicitor, um, uh, through the Mayor to you, just some
questions, and I'm sorry to be asking you on the spot about
some of this stuff, but, um, the difference between
Historical Commission and Neighborhood Conservation
Districts, a little bit about that, and do they fall under

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

in the past few days, but --

40C? And would the changes that are being suggested, uh, be
in violation of 40C?
And my last one is, if they are, are we allowed to keep
what we have, but maybe make some additions to membership
121
Packet Pg. 358

2

on, um, the NCD committees in order to, uh, reach the
purpose that--the stated purpose of having more diversity,
and, uh, you know, uh, more folks representative of the

CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Yes, through you, Madam

Mayor, I think I'd like to see if I could break these down.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Sure.
The first question,

however, I can answer, which is that the City exercised its
home rule powers when it created the NCD Ordinance. It
explicitly did not rely upon Chapter 40C or, um, proceed to
enact the NCD Ordinance pursuant to Chapter 40C. So, it has
long been the position of the City that Chapter 40C does not
govern NCDs. Um, so that's the answer to that question.
Would you please remind me of the other questions?
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Yeah, I mean, a lot of it

was premised on whether it's 40C or not, but, um, at least
my understanding of the intention, I'm sure Councillor

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

community on the NCDs? I can--I can go back and break it up.

McGovern will speak to it, uh, that the goal was--of this,
uh, proposal is to provide, uh, greater diversity and
representation on the NCDs.
My question, thinking that it was governed by 40C, was
122
Packet Pg. 359

2

whether we could, uh, instead of subtracting or changing the
language about who's on there now, instead consider adding
people, uh, that offer some of this diversity and

CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor,

I think I'm not seeing in this drafted language what you
just discussed. So if I'm correct, then that would be
something you're posing as a hypothetical. And assuming that
to be the case, I really would like to understand a little
bit better, um, exactly what's being proposed before I can
really answer the question.
But one thing that is clear is it's not governed by
Chapter 40C, so it, it would only be limited by, um, things
that we could not do under our home rule powers. So I would
want to be able to look into that a little bit more and, and
discuss it further in whatever forum this would, um, be
moved forward to discuss in. Um, but it, it certainly
wouldn't have any prohibition under Chapter 40C.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

representation that people are, uh, asking for.

Just, just one last question

through you, Madam Mayor. So, because it's not governed by
40C and it's under our home rule powers, we can do what we
desired. We don't need to go to the state, to the
123
Packet Pg. 360

2

Legislature to get any further approval. The Council can
make changes on its own.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor,

home rule powers, not something that was submitted to or
passed by the Legislature for, uh, similar reasons to what
we just discussed with respect to the fossil fuel, um, by
law of Brookline being different than an ordinance of the
City, because the City does have home rule powers to enact
ordinances without there being submitted first to the
Attorney General for review and approval.
So this--um, these--this, um, ordinance was adopted
solely pursuant to the City's home rule powers and could be
amended on that same basis without being submitted to the
Attorney General. And as I said before, I would like to know
a little bit better about what it is that we're trying to do
before I can say, yes, you can do that, you know,
definitely.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

this is an ordinance of the City of Cambridge under its own

Thank you. Um, I just wanted

to--I didn't want to keep here all night, uh, for--to get
the answers upfront. So thank you very much.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Madam Mayor.

124
Packet Pg. 361

2

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

McGovern, and then we can go to Councillor Simmons, and then
I know Councillor Zondervan has his hand up.
Thank you, Madam Mayor,

through you. So, um, just to explain, you know, we had some-we heard some comments in, in, uh, in public comment about,
you know, why this is here and it's a second fight at the
apple and, and whatnot, just to make sure we're all on the
same page.
This was a residence petition that was filed, um, on
September-ish, I want to say, um, and we did have, uh, one
or two Ordinance Committee meetings about this, but there
was never--we never took any action on it, and we were gonna
have further conversations, which never happened. And this
was not carried over to the new term.
So when I was asked about where this was in the
ordinance sort of agenda, and I checked with the Clerk, it
was essentially not on the agenda because it was not carried

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

over to the current term. So in order to continue that
conversation that we started and either dispose of it or
send it onto the Council favorably, unfavorably, we needed
to refile it so that it can get back in the queue.
125
Packet Pg. 362

2

So this is not a second bite at the apple, it's the
same apple and it's the same bite. Um, and so that's why it
was filed so that it can get back in the queue of ordinance.

these questions answered, and decide what, if anything, uh,
we want to do with this.
It doesn't--moving this to ordinance tonight does not
mean that any of these--that this--that these amended
changes, uh, uh, are approved. Uh, it just means that it
goes back to the Ordinance Committee to continue the
conversation. And so, um, that's why it's here. Um, when we
get the Policy Order Number 5, same thing. It did not carry
over to the current term. We refiled it tonight so that we
could continue that.
Um, so that's why it's here. Um, you know, I fully
expect that, I think we can all agree that in most--almost
all cases, no ordinance comes out the same way it goes in.
There's always amendments and there are things that you can

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

We can finish this up, we can finish the discussion, get

and can't do. So, um, you know, we will have to see what-you know, where this ends up and, and where this lands.
Um, but that's--that was the intent and that's why I
was put back on the agenda is because the conversation was
126
Packet Pg. 363

2

not finished and inadvertently did not get carried over, uh,
to this Council term, and so that's what we're doing
tonight. Um, and I really--you know, I know, like many

hot.
Um, I hope that whether folks agree with these
potential amendments or don't, um, you know, there was a lot
of comments, you know, tonight about assuming intentions
and, and, and motives of people. I hope we cannot do that.
Um, you know, and, and instead, you know, not, instead of
assuming the worst and what people, people want to do, let's
try to assume, you know, the good in what people want to do,
as we move forward in this conversation.
And I'm sure we will come up with something that, um,
you know, that, that, that we can, you know, hopefully feel
good about one way or the other. So that was why it's--Madam
Mayor, that's why it was on the agenda tonight, um, is so
that that conversation can continue as it was intended.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

conversations in our City right now, they're, they're very

Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Simmons,

and then Councillor Zondervan, and then the Vice Mayor.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

127
Packet Pg. 364

2

I just wanted to concur with my colleague, Councillor
McGovern, who I had, um, I co-sponsored this with him. I
think it's an important time to have a conversation around

before us. But let us have that conversation because I think
it will set the stage and give us a footprint, if you will,
on what we might be wanting to do around other items
associated with this kind of item. So I, I fully support it,
I hope my colleagues will support it, and we'll go forward.
Thank you. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, well, a couple of things. I think, you
know, it, it is a little different from what was proposed
last time and, and in particular, um, we don't have the red
line comparing it to the original text, which in some ways
makes it easier on the eyes, but on the other hand, makes it
harder for us to understand what exactly is being changed.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

this issue, and it may be far broader than, than what we had

So I think it would be helpful to, to get that
comparison as well in addition to, uh, the text as it's
currently structured. Um, and then, you know, I, I, I do
realize that it was in, in ordinance last term, but, um,
128
Packet Pg. 365

2

given that it is a pretty complex set of changes that's
being proposed, and we've been, um, establishing this
practice of, of sending more complex conversations like that

with the Green Jobs Ordinance and the Parking Minimums and
the Amendments.
So I do think it makes sense in this case to, to have a
hearing in, in Neighborhood and Long Term Planning to, you
know, have, have this deeper conversation about these
changes. We also have some newer colleagues on the Council,
um, who weren't part of the conversation last time. And then
bringing back to ordinance, I certainly don't have any, any
problem with, you know, hearing in ordinance. It's just, uh,
that committee, as we all know, gets, gets pretty busy and
we want to make sure that we send things there that are
closer to, um, done than what might be the case here.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, is that a motion,

Councillor Zondervan?
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to topical committees first, and, you know, most recently

Yes. Thank you.

So we can discuss the motion.

So that's before us, and other folks can discuss other items
before we go to the vote. But we have the Vice Mayor, and
129
Packet Pg. 366

2

then we have Councillor Carlone, and then we have Councillor
Azeem.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

McGovern for bringing this forward. I would like to be added
as a co-sponsor. Um, I, I did some work on this last term
and I'm fully supportive of bringing this back, um, before
us.
I do want to say, I know that there was a lot of public
comment tonight about, I think Councillor McGovern
mentioned, a second bite at the apple. Um, this was a
conversation that we had in the Ordinance Committee, and
even Charlie Sullivan from the Historical Commission, I was
looking at my notes today from the meeting, said that this
was long overdue for an update, and really put together a
thoughtful memo on, on what he thought actually might be
some good updates to the NCD Ordinance.
So there's a conversation that got started in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

through you. And thank you to Councillors Simmons and

September, we were not able to finish it. I look forward to
having a continued conversation around this idea that it's,
it's long overdue for an update. Um, and we should be
looking at this NCD Ordinance and making those updates, uh,
130
Packet Pg. 367

2

as we decide, as a group together, um, what those updates
should be.
So whether that's in Neighborhood and Long Term

colleague that, um, we should be making a practice of
sending these more complex conversations to committee, um,
before we get them to ordinance.
So, um, I would be supportive of sending this to
Neighborhood and Long-Term Committee--Neighborhood and Long
Term Planning, and the Arts and Celebrations Committee, um,
for a deeper discussion with the historical commission with,
um, members of the community. So, uh, I would like to be
added as a co-sponsor if the, uh, the sponsors are amenable
to that. Thank you, Madam Mayor, I yield back
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So we can do that.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Madam Mayor, that was an

oversight on my part. I apologize to the Vice Mayor. She
should have been honored from the beginning. Thank you.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Planning or Ordinance Committee, I certainly agree with my

And I would support the

Vice Mayor being added as well, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. So, we can do that

momentarily. We'll just--I want to quickly go to Councillor
131
Packet Pg. 368

2

Carlone, and Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, I just wanted to fully support what Councillor

compared the existing paragraph and the new paragraph, but
with something that I--it must be quite different or they
would've just used the standard cross out in addition, it
would be good -I don't know if the City will do this or, uh, the, the
applicant, but, um, we do need a comparison if we're gonna
move this into, uh, Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, or,
or we're not gonna get anywhere. So I agree with that. And
thank you to the Vice Mayor for mentioning Charlie
Sullivan's memo, which was quite thorough, and he agreed,
uh, as the Vice Mayor was, uh, saying that, sure, there are
things that can be done that should be done to make it
better.
And having participated in the Harvard Square

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Zondervan was, uh, referring to. And in this case, I haven't

Conservation District meetings as an observer, um, they were
very productive. And I mean, I don't think I've ever recall
a committee that in the end said it was a good process with
a good result. So I would imagine the same thing will
132
Packet Pg. 369

2

happen. So, thank you, and I'm done. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Azeem.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, so I am happy as well to

logistical one. Um, I was wondering, considering that--I
could imagine this going to, uh, Neighborhood and Long Term
Planning, but also to the Housing Committee. And considering
that Councillor Simmons is a co-sponsor on this legislation,
I was wondering if there was interest in sending this to the
Housing Committee instead.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We already have a motion on the

floor, Councillor, so we have to deal with that motion.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Sounds good. Okay.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor.

Sure. Let me just, uh, go

through the order of operation. Councillor Zondervan, I know
you had a motion that takes precedence technically, but if
we do that, we can't add Councillor--we can't add Vice Mayor

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

send it to committee. Uh, my thought was, uh, more of a

on it. So I would ask that we do that motion first, if
you're okay with that. And you're nodding, so we'll, we'll
do that. Thank you. Um, and I know that Councillor Nolan had
her hand up, so we'll go back to you, Councillor McGovern,
133
Packet Pg. 370

2

after that.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Do you want to do the

motion first?
Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes. Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. I do think it makes sense to flush this out a
little bit to committee and then move it to ordinance,
because there does seem to be some ongoing questions. I do
remember, uh, the Historical Commission coming forward with
some suggestions, and also not having been included in the
original drafting, feeling like there's some--a lot of
expertise that that should be included.
So I look forward to. I think that is definitely needed
before we do a wholesale change of this. For me, it would
also be helpful to have the underlying home rule that
established this because I wasn't aware that it was
different. And I think that also comes to all of us to
understand where it is that if the state law applies or if

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

it doesn't apply, why it doesn't apply to, to explain that
clearly. Because that wasn't clear to me that this is not a
Historic District in line with the state level definition of
it.
134
Packet Pg. 371

2

Because one question is raised, even if it was
established by home rule, we also know, just as we just
discussed earlier, that even if we want to do something and

contravene state law so that we have to remember. And I want
to make sure that we're not running a fowler or, or at any
new risk if we're not continuing to follow some of the
definitions in, uh, in the chapter, in the state law.
The red line version is something obviously we should
have. I, I do think having a conversation where we can bring
in a range of people into Neighborhood and Long Term
Planning, and then scheduling it for ordinance so that we
can move this forward, makes, makes a lot of sense to me.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you. Um, there is a

red line version. I thought I had sent it to the Clerk
through you, Madam Mayor.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So, through you, Madam

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we have different language, that doesn't mean we can

Mayor. Uh, Councillor McGovern did send me the version to
put on to the agenda for today. It is, correct me if I'm
wrong, Councillor McGovern, basically exactly what was
submitted in the last term. I just massaged a little bit to
135
Packet Pg. 372

2

put it into basically standard legislative format, um, but
what I'll do is I'll attach that, uh, red line version to
the, um, the file, so whenever the Council has another

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

And, and--thank you Mr.

Clerk. And the, the newer--what, what you see in front of
us, there were some amendments made from the original filing
based on some feedback. And so what is in front of us is the
newest version of that, the most up-to-date, so we're not
going all the way back to the beginning. Um, and so we will
get, you know, get that--get that red line.
And, you know, I would, um--you know, if it's the will
the Council to, to send it to Neighborhood and Long Term
Planning, I think that's fine. I just--I don't want it to
get stuck up there, you know, and, and be held up there. I'd
like to get this moving. So as long as we can do that
meeting, if the Chair could get that meeting scheduled
sooner rather than later, I'd appreciate that.

everything Councillor Simmons said. I think we had a great

significant change, and I think it's important that we do
this properly and go through the process. I'm hoping that

a motion to, uh, move this to the Transportation and Public

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So we'd have that motion before

us, we can discuss it. We can go to Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, and just to be clear, we're referring
both items to the Transportation and Public Utilities
Committee?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. Yeah, just

wanted to speak briefly on, um, this question about, uh,
eliminating parking minimums because, you know, we, we still
continue to hear, uh, what I think is some confusion that
somehow ending the parking minimums would, um, be--would
cause there no parking can be provided, uh, for new
residents. And, and that's clearly not the case.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Utilities Committee.

And first of all, it, it's not going to reduce any
existing parking. But, but furthermore, it wouldn't prevent
developers from creating new parking if, if they see a
demand, and we would expect that in most cases, um, they
141
Packet Pg. 378

2

would still add, uh, parking, but we just wouldn't require
them to add it, and therefore, they wouldn't be building
more parking than they--than they anticipate they would

And we also see in many cases, that developers apply
for a special permit or a variance to be able to, to not
provide as much parking as it's required. And that's itself
an, an onerous and, and costly process. Um, so that's really
the, uh, intent here is to--is to reduce that, that burden
on, on the developers so that they can make the, the right
decision for that particular project, but it's certainly
not, um, going to result in, in no parking being provided.
Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We have no other hands on this,

Azeem's motion to refer items--Chart Right and Items 2 and 3

Kitty, as I often, uh, referred to her as. This woman has
run the TTT Mentoring Program for several decades. It
exposes young children, mostly Black and Brown children, to
science and technology. It is an extraordinary program.
She has done things, sleepovers at the Museum of
Science, gotten free computers for, um, the families, for
the young people. They learned--they learned pre-algebra,
coding, java script, I could go on and on. This is an
extraordinary program that is a labor of love to Ms.
Kathleen Jones. And even here with this policy resolution,
it's really about the mentor that come to work with these
young people.
Most of these mentors, and you can see them listed

It's really a privilege, uh, as we close our Black History

program. She does not ask a dime from the City to do this.
I'm always amazed at the work that she does for these

I was very fortunate to have my children in this

wish more of our Cambridge Public Schools students would

children that are willing to come and be with her and give

But more importantly, that these TTT mentors give their
time, their talent, and their treasure to these students.
And it's extraordinary program. I am proud to be able to
offer this, uh, policy resolution, acknowledging the
mentors, acknowledging the students, and most importantly,
acknowledging Kathleen Jones for her Cambridge --longtime

would just take his, uh, Christmas in July, vacations for a

us well, he and his wife, Carmen.
And I can tell you, he will be very, very sorely
missed. It was a place just to hang out, to meet your
friends, to bring your family to eat, to get takeout. He
catered so many different City events, uh, for us, not only
around Latino Heritage Month, but just in general. He and
his wife, Carmen, are just extraordinary, extraordinary
people. His children went to school in Cambridge. He lives
in Cambridge for a number of years before he moved, uh, onto
Medford.
And so I'm hoping he has not left the state yet to go
back to his home, to his native home of Puerto Rico, so that

really brings up this difficult question of how, how do we

really make Cambridge such a diverse and, and special place?
And, you know, I remember talking with Izzy just a year
162

or two ago, and he was mentioning that there really was no
succession option. You know, that if, if, and when he
decided to retire, he would have to close the restaurant

know, if we--if we want to continue to keep these kinds of
institutions in our City, we have to think about how we do
that. Because if we just rely on, on good luck in the

Stayed involved with the Union Baptist Church on a--on

owner and entrepreneur. A member of the Ditton family, as

roots can be traced back to the Caribbean, each and all of
them in their own way, including our, um, newest US Attorney
General, uh, a member of the Ditton family.
They have done extraordinary things to and for our
community, and I think it only fit in that we acknowledge,
uh, this family, but more importantly, this man for what he
has done and the legacy through his children that goes
forward. So, I'm hoping that, again, my, my colleagues will
stand and support this order forwarded on to Dedication

February 28, 2022 to be designated as Ronald “R-Jay” Jones
Day in the City of Cambridge. Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to my colleagues on the Council, many of you may
not know R-Jay. R-Jay grew up in Cambridge. Again, the kid
from Cambridge, and Cambridge is his hometown. He, uh, came
to work to the Cambridge Community Center, and we know the
Cambridge Community Center has been a anchor in the
community of Cambridge, particularly Riverside since the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Quinton Y. Zondervan – Yes

early 1900s when it was purchased, um, by the St. Paul AME
Church. And then at some time later, forward it over to the
Cambridge Community Center as a, I call it a sort of a
meeting station, a, a place where the community comes
170
Packet Pg. 407

together.
Well, R-Jay has worked there, uh, since--ooh, I don't-I can't even remember. Uh, he had a variety of different

chef building manager, rides his bike everywhere. Uh, he
would coordinate the annual Thanksgiving luncheon. I think
he has touched the lives of over 5,000 families, which is in
the Policy Order.
Very unassuming, just a really nice gentleman, never
asked for any acknowledgement, never asked for any--in any
way to be, be--have a spotlight put on him. Just loved his
community. And we, in turn, I hope, through this Policy
Order, can say, and we love you. So his service at the
Cambridge Community Center it has--is coming to an end after
50 years.
And so, uh, again, um, many of you may not know R-Jay,
but I stand here to say, an incredible man who paid it
forward, stayed in his community, gave to his community, and

We're onto Policy Order Number

3, that the City Manager is requested to amend all existing
Community Host Agreements previously issued by the City by
reducing the Impact Fee to 0.05% of Gross Revenue and to
refrain from placing this burden upon any future Host
Community Agreements that may yet be issued. This was filed

Councillor Dennis J. Carlone – Yes

by Councillor Simmons, Councillor McGovern, Councillor
Toner, and Councillor Azeem. Councillor Simmons, you have
the floor.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

172
Packet Pg. 409

2

through you to my colleagues. First of all, I want to thank
my co-makers of this motion for joining me as we sort of
turn our attention in something that I think is very

proactive in trying to remove these impediments from the way
of our SEs and EEs.
I believe the Texas Order speaks for itself, and I
don't have much more to Avian stating that Cambridge, like
most other communities, have traded very cautiously into
allowing recreational dispensaries into their communities.
Now, there was concern about long lines, excessive traffic,
and a general strain on the resources once these
dispensaries were up and running.
But it appears that many of those fears have not come
to pass in other communities. And we now--and we do know
that what we may have anticipated to be issues have not been
issues here, or will not be issues here. At the same time,
the impact fees placed on EE and SEs to mitigate these

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

important that we should all turn our attention to be

concerns are having a real financial impact upon these
applicants.
And these--basing on these fees, and either eliminating
or reducing them, could be a step the City could take to
173
Packet Pg. 410

2

show that we are serious in trying to help these businesses
succeed. We struggled over developing molding, passing
legislation to enfranchise our SEs and EEs. And as we have

their businesses, there--this has been an impediment, a, a,
a stumbling block.
We have said, and we work very hard at trying to even
the, the playing field for SEs and EEs. We know that through
COVID, which was a very difficult time, SEs and EEs were
holding down rents, paying insurance fees, operating costs
far beyond--I could even begin to enumerate--operating just
to get started, just to kind of get moving, and get open,
has cost close to a million dollars for SEs and EEs.
And some of them, as we know, have made it through, or
making it through. But this, I believe this, this--what's in
the Host Community Agreement is, is something that we really
need to look at. And so, again, I want to first thank my,
uh, colleagues for assigning onto this, this order. I think

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

gone through the rollout, these SEs and EEs establishing

Cambridge wants to continue to be in the vanguard of writing
some of the social wrongs that have happened to people,
Black and Brown people, in particular.
Now, in addition to not offering this Policy Order, I
174
Packet Pg. 411

2

did want to make an amendment and I will read it to you. And
I, I hope that, uh, we can put it up on the screen. And, and
it should say, um, in the, um, order that the City Manager

EEs and SEs applicants who have been granted HCAs by the
City Council.
And two, and the idea, the reason why I'm adding that,
and it came through what I was listening to in terms of
public comment, because we want to invite these folks that
have skin in the game to the table to work with the City
Manager around, uh, this, um, impact fee. Because remember,
this is an impact fee that is being levied against these
establishments before they've even opened their doors.
We are asking for this impact fee when we have seen
other cities in town to see a link to what they've done in
Northampton about saying, let's take them away because the
impact fee has not risen to a level where it has impacted
the City or town.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

is hereby requested and the change would be to reach out to

And so I'm respectfully asking, uh, my colleagues to
stand with me and asking the City Manager to look at these
Host Community Agreements with a view toward, and it's in-it's in the order, amend all existing Community Host
175
Packet Pg. 412

2

Agreements previously issued by the City by reducing the
impact fee to 0.05% of gross revenue. Think about that just
for a moment. We're talking about gross revenue.

not made a dollar, and we're trying to attach their gross
revenue. So, uh, I will yield the floor to my co-makers if
any of them want to speak on this, but I think this would be
a step in writing or making the move an obstacle to success,
because my fear is that this remains, we open the door for
them failing, and then someone that is not a minority or a
black around owned business stepping in. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Do any of the co-makers want to

speak? I don't see any. We'll see--we'll go to Councillor
Zondervan, and then Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, I, um, do appreciate the order. I do
need some time to understand them better. I've had some
conversations with some of the impacted stakeholders, and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

These EEs and SEs, who are open or about to open, have

they would like some time to better understand what's being
proposed here.
You know, I, I, I certainly agree with my colleague,
and that we need to look at this, but at this point, we
176

don't know what the impacts will be of, of these stores. If,
if anything at all, then if there is an impact, we, we need
to have a conversation about how we equitably distribute at

this, this week, um, she--I would like to add, uh, the Vice
Mayor to this. Um, and thank you, um, Madam Mayor for, uh,
your work on this as well. We've, we've all been having many
conversations with folks in the community about the, um, the
177
Packet Pg. 414

2

uptick in, in violence, uh, particularly involving our young
people. And, and this, you know, this senseless, uh,
violence that's happening between, um, particularly the, you

projects in Somerville.
Um, you know, I know that there's various things
happening and that cities are talking with, with one
another, and they're trying to get a sense of what this is
all about. Um, but they're--myself and, and, and my cosponsors, and members of the community, really don't know,
um, what's going on and, and, and, and what we're doing.
And, and there was just some recent activity, just a--just a
couple weeks ago again, um, which hopefully, will not lead
to some kind of retaliation.
So, uh, you know, bringing our communities together and
the policy makers, as, as well as those who are on the
ground doing the work, um, not just the police departments,
but, you know, we can expand that list to bring in some of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

know, in one instance, the Port and, and, um, Mystic Valley

the community organizations that are--that are working on
this to really try to get a better handle on what's going
on, uh, and get us see if there's anything more that we can
be doing to, uh, support these young people.
178

And, and, and really, you know, there's, there's longterm issues we have to talk about that we talk about a lot,
housing and jobs and all of that, but we have to--we have to

shot. And, um, so there's an immediate, uh, need, uh, for
this, in addition to all the Long Term Planning that, that,
uh, that we're talking about. Cause we can't lose another,
another young person to this senseless, uh, violence. So,
uh, thank you all, and, and, um, I hope we can pass this and
get this going.

our end. We are going to have to garner, pull together, work

think this is being an important part of it, and I've
started doing this a little bit, is talking to some of the
OGs about this and how we can make a difference.
So I am hoping my colleagues will support us in this
order so that we can move forward to, to make some very
important needed changes, and not just engaging, um, elected
officials, but looking at the property managers, um, and
others as well. So, again, I'm pleased to be a co-sponsor on

Thank you, Madam Vice

Mayor. Um, as I mentioned earlier, this was, uh, a policy
that--a Policy Order that was passed on December 6th, 2021,
and was not, uh, carried over to the current term. Um, this
is the, the same order, uh, with the exception.
Uh, the original order had a report back date of, uh,
for the manager to report back to us by, uh, the end of
January of 2022. Obviously, that has passed, so we, uh,
changed the date to March 31st, 2022. Um, and, you know,
just--you know, I know that there's a lot of strong feelings
of this discussion.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

which will help inform future installations of bike lanes

This was actually an order that, um, was supported by,
not only the business community, but the bike community
also, uh, you know, was, was supportive of this. So as an
example of something that can be done, uh, collaboratively
183
Packet Pg. 420

and cooperatively. So, um, we're just bringing it back
because it did not make the, uh, the transition to the
current term. Thank you.
There are other--are there any

Thank you. Um, I wanted to

give, uh, like kudos to like, the, um, motion makers for
introducing this. I think it's really important for us to
get clear, um, economic data, um, on how businesses are
doing, just so we can squash some of the fear and have real
numbers so that all of us are working off of.
Um, I'm a little bit nervous about getting the
information at this time because, uh, a, like we've had
COVID, which kind of interferes with business in general. I
think hopefully in a generous interpretation, uh, uh, the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

City's able to take that into account and just separate out
the impacts of the bike networks by using the rest of the
City as a comparison.
Um, but other things that I'm concerned about a little
184
Packet Pg. 421

2

bit are that, um, most of the recent developments have been
in the winter, and most people use the bike lanes during the
summer months, so we won't see the full economic impact. And

network was that once it's fully connected, um, many people
will feel safer using it, versus when it's patchy, you still
have dangerous stretches. Um, so as such, I, uh, proposed a,
uh, single line amendment, which is just to add a few words
to the order, hopefully, uh, a non-controversial amendment.
Um, I was hoping that we could read over and just discuss
it.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So Councillor Azeem will--the

Clerk will pull the amendment forward, and that'll be before
us for discussion. As I mentioned, after you, we'll have
Councillor Carlone, Councillor Zondervan, and then
Councillor Nolan speak, and then anyone can speak to your
amendment as well. So the amendment, if you want to speak to
it right now, Councillor Azeem.

also, um, part of the theory behind having a connected bike

Yeah, absolutely. Um,

apologies, the word completed got duplicated there. Um, but
essentially, it just says the impacts of the bike
installations, both now and what the, uh, projected impacts

are year round, once the full network is completed.

said this is an urban design study more than just a
transportation study. And this is an integral part of an
urban design study. You have to know what you're dealing
with before you take action. Um, I wanted to say that, and I
also would like to be a co-sponsor as well.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Co-sponsor. Okay. What we'll do

is, we'll--we have that amendment for us, so we'll do the
amendment and then we can do vote on that motion to add you.
We will go to Councillor Zondervan, and then Councillor
Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Mayor. Certainly, I support the order and, uh, the

amendments to it. Um, it seems overall pretty innocuous. And
as Councillor McGovern said, this was heard last term as
well, but I, I want to say that, you know, at some point, we
have to be honest with our constituents and, and be clear
186

with them that we are supporting the Bicycle Safety
Ordinance as is, and, and it's being implemented according
to the timeline that is specified there. And, you know, we

but, but we're not, um, planning to change the, the schedule
of implementation. Thank you
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. I do remember this from last term. I actually hope
that the City has worked on it anyway. There's nothing to
stop them from having done this economic analysis. We had
passed it before and it should have--and I hope it was
already in planning to be delivered by January. Even if it
wasn't carried over, the work, uh, could have and should
have been done.
Um, I do have a couple questions about where this--when
this happens, what it applies to, because the current
language says that this will help inform future

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

can certainly do these studies and, and assess the impacts,

installations. I presume that means any installation that's
not already done, which includes the ones that are in
planning. And I, I hope that's the case because I think
that's what most of the people who have written to us and
187
Packet Pg. 424

2

talked about it assume.
And, and my concern about, uh, the possible amendment
is that that's in--depending on how you read it, I am

round. But by saying once the bike network is completed, it
won't be completed for five years. So that, that means, if
that is the case that we're waiting to get economic data for
once the bike network is completed, then we're not gonna be
doing it for future installations because it'll all be done.
So as long as the understanding is, of course, we'll
continue to get data, but that we will actually right now
say that it will help inform future installations, including
ones coming up this spring so that we can understand if
there's ways we can do it, I think it's really critically
important we do that. And if we're not gonna do that, that
we communicate that because that's what I would be in favor
of, otherwise, what is the point of doing this?
To allay some of the concerns of--that have been

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

completely in favor of getting, uh, the data now and year-

expressed, I completely agree that there's a concern that
the latest iteration of this was done in November, right
before winter, when there was not going to be, uh, many
usage of, uh, of the bike lanes. And that is not something
188
Packet Pg. 425

2

that, that we should base, um, our understanding on.
But we have let--we have, um, rolled out and
implemented and installed protected bike lanes in many areas

that we should be able to gather the economic data requested
in this from several of the different bike lanes, not just
the most recent one, um, so that, that could help inform a
few translations of bike lane.
A lot of the emphasis has been on just the latest
stretch of Northern Mass, but we have--we did one on Bridle
Street, there was one on Cambridge Street. There's, uh, was
one recently right in front of City Hall, right from Harvard
Square, out to to Cambridge Street. There's, there's been a
number of them in different parts of the City, and it's
really important since at this point have several years of
data, and as was mentioned, even if it's COVID related, then
we just match that up with other, uh, businesses or streets
that are similar that were also during COVID.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

of the cities at this point, including even pre COVID, so

So my question or my--I don't--I don't know if it needs
to be answered, but if, if the future installations means
all future installations and that the amendment does not
preclude us from using and having that relevant economic
189
Packet Pg. 426

2

data immediately for all future installations.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, Councillor Nolan, you have

a--it seems that you have a question to Councillor Azeem

So, Councillor Azeem, can you -COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

I don't think that this has

any impact on Councillor Nolan's points about, uh, using
this for future bike lanes. This was just assets also take
into future projections once the network is completed about
how bike, uh, usage will grow, just because we're in the
middle of construction. And I think it's a little bit, uh,
unfair to judge, uh--to evaluate only using the current
circumstance without taking into account future projections.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan, does that

make sense to you?
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

As long as we're all

interpreting it that way, yes, that, that makes sense. And I
agree, that's, although what Councillor Azeem referred to,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

about the intent around the amendment and the timing of it.

which is bike usage, which I also think is important, what
we're talking about is the economic data related to bicycle
impacts, and we can get them and continue to do it. So as
long as it means that we're, we're continuing this, but
190
Packet Pg. 427

2

we're, we're--whatever data we can gather now, we use
immediately, then I could support it.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So I have some new hands up. I

Mayor.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. I

just want to be clear that, uh, yes, it's about positive
impact of bicycle, bicycle customers, but it's also about
measuring the impact of the changing of the traffic patterns
and parking, etc. So I just want to, uh, be clear on that.
And I could support the amendment because quite
honestly, I would hope that going forward, it's not just
about bicycles and bike lanes. I would love to be getting an
annual report about, uh, how, how small businesses and
businesses retail is doing generally. And it'd be great to
be able to capture.
I'm not suggesting we change this in any way, but maybe
for a future, uh, economic development, uh, subcommittee

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

had seen Councillor Toner, and then I'll go to the Vice

meeting, uh, a conversation about how we measure the health
and growth of our small business and retail going forward,
um, and capture that information so that we have these kinds
of benchmarks in the future. Thank you.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Well, thank you, Madam

Mayor. I had a question for my colleague about the, um,

collection, how, how long, how many years are we, we going
to be collecting this annual data? I just--it says yearround, but it just doesn't have an end time.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Oh, that's a very good

clarification.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Azeem.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Apologies. Uh, apologies for

interrupting. Um, uh, but year-round, I just meant, um, like
taking into count, um, uh, the full season, not just at this
moment where it's like in the beginning of middle of winter,
but like taking into account all four seasons. Uh, so if you
think we can clarify that, happy to change the word.

Vice Mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you. I do think it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

proposed amendment. Um, in terms of a year-round data

needs to be clarified, although I'm not sure how to do that
at this moment. Um, it just does--it seems to me, you mean a
year-round, like an annual, but if other people don't-didn't read it that way, I'm not sure how to clarify it

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Could we say annually?
Annually?

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, I think the goal is to

not make it annual, but just as one time, at least as I
interpreted from the Vice Mayor. And so I'm happy to just
remove year round. And I think I was just interested in
getting projected numbers of like how many more people will
be using the bike lanes and potentially stopping, uh, uh, at
these stores once the network is fully completed.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Point of order, Madam

Sure. Councillor Simmons, state

your point.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

I love the enthusiasm

for my colleague, but, um, um, if it's--it's just good if we
remember that we have to be recognized by the Chair before
we speak, uh, so it's less of a conversation, it's more like
a business meeting. And then when it's my opportunity, I
would like the floor to add something to the conversation.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So we have a revised amendment

before us.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Madam Chair, Madam

Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, the Clerk has stated that

we should make sure Councillor Azeem, who's the amendment
maker, has the amendment correctly. So I'd ask him to come

online, and then I'll go back to the Vice Mayor. I had saw

Councillor Simmons. Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, thank you. And through

that.

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I'm just trying to--my concern--I've heard from my
colleague, Councillor Toner, the Vice Mayor, started sort of
down this line of discussion. My concern is we are writing
195
Packet Pg. 432

2

this Policy Order now with this amendment that may have to
be interpreted when none of us are still here.
And so I want to be very clear that my colleague, I

I'm not clear about. So it's either through the amendment
maker, which is the Vice Mayor, or from the original motion
maker. I want to be clear that what I think you're asking
for is that as we--because I think this is important, that
if we're going to put this quality work in by developing
this policy initiative, that anyone that comes behind us
three or four or five years from now will know what his
intent is. I am not clear what the intent is. So if someone
could clarify that for me, I would appreciate it.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Azeem.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

I think the intent is to, uh,

take an economic snapshot that spans a full year, not to
repeat this annually.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Through you, Madam

Mayor, to my colleague. So you only want a one-year look
back, as opposed to annual reviews or biannual reviews?

The Ad-hoc will have a framework from which to select

previous Gov Ops hearings, and will be discussed again this
coming Wednesday. And the framework, uh, will help to ensure
that, uh, many of Cambridge's diverse constituencies are-constituencies are represented on the Screening Committee.
I know people have been asking how to self-nominate for
the Screening Committee. We can't start that process until
the job is posted, and when we know what dates the Screening
Committee will meet. So, as I said, the Vice Mayor will be
holding the Gov Ops meeting this Wednesday at 2:00, to not
only discuss the draft of the leadership profile, but

it's more accessible to residents in the eastern part of the

Currently, you know, the closures can be quite a
distance away for people who live in the Port or East

And this was--this committee hearing was, uh, spurred
by a petition that we received from 40 people who selfidentified as users of the Carl Barron Plaza, including many
who were unhoused. And they made several suggestions that

they wanted us to consider, but hadn't been considered as
part of the public process until that point.
And that petition, in particular, caught my attention

design was, was hostile to them. So I thought it was
important to have a hearing on it and, uh, worked with
Councillor McGovern on, on getting that scheduled. And the
purpose was really to hear from members of the unhoused
community and what they wanted to see done to address those
concerns.
We included several questions that we heard directly
from one of the petitioners who regularly used the, the
Plaza during a period of time when he was himself unhoused
as well. And I was very pleased with the responsiveness of
the City staff in, in addressing those issues. A couple of
highlights were to, um, provide electrical plugs so that
people could charge devices like wheelchairs. And the City
staff was very willing to consider that option.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

because the petitioner stated that they felt the proposed

Um, obviously the details have to be worked out, but,
um--and I look forward to that, hopefully, a solution being
worked out, uh, potentially with participation from the
Central Square Business Improvement District. The Sprinkler

2

system, which was particularly a problem for members of the
unhoused community, applies during times when the sprinklers
would go off and, and soak people who were in the plaza.

other plazas with landscaping in Cambridge. So, uh, we can
certainly do the same here. And the staff did tell us that
they were planning to put irrigation system underground so
that it wouldn't do that. Narcan access, the staff, um, told
us that they had started conversations with the Central
Square bid about having Narcan access in the lead with any
of the Plaza. So hopefully, that can be, uh, established as
well.
And then finally, on the--on the trees, the staff
promised to look at the possibility of relocating those
trees instead of just cutting them down. Um, we also--after
the hearing, my office also held a meeting at the YMCA with
several residents there to get their thoughts, and we're
hoping to have several more of those kinds of conversations

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that, some of that. But hopefully, we can, uh, resume that
activity and, uh, we'll be happy to update the Council as

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

What we have to respectfully submit to the City Council is
the work of the Cambridge Advisory Committee on City Arts,
Monument, and Markers, which you all are now called the
Committee. And it is--it's embodiment.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor E. Denise Simmons – Yes

It was of a deep commitment to honestly confront our
history to understand how the stories we tell about our
past, shape our present, and our future, and to tell a
fuller story of who we are, who we were, and who we want to
211
Packet Pg. 448

2

become, and to become more inclusive going forward. The work
includes asking the questions about whom we choose to
celebrate, how we understand their lives, and whether there

to be lifted up and celebrated.
As my colleagues know, um, this work was, uh,
commissioned through the City Manager, uh, back in 2019,
2020 through two Policy Orders. One Policy Order was around
street, the name of the streets, and the second was around
our monuments and markers and memorials.
So to place this working historical context, the
Committee, uh, spent six months, where we looked, uh, during
the pandemic and we, we continued our work through what was
raging in our community around police brutality, gun
violence, and increased, uh, awareness of the unfolding
climate, catastrophes of presidential impeachment, a
presidential election, and insurrection of White
supremacists attacking the US Capitol Congress and Congress.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

are less unknown but no less important individuals who ought

We wanted to make sure that this work moved forward.
And so the Committee met for a period of six months, and I
want to just take a moment to name and thank the people that
participated. This Committee was chaired by Brian Corr, or I

should say co-facilitated and chaired by Brian Corr and I,
but we also had a facilitator, Ora Grodsky, who was
extraordinary.

Bazile, who is a senior, who was a senior, at Cambridge
Rindge and Latin. Mr. Melvin Downes, um, member of the
Trailblazers and Black History Project. Ms. Emmanuella Fede,
also a student, a former student but was--and worked at the
Community Art Center in the Port. Dr. Christine HutchinsonJones, Project Manager, an Initiative of Harvard and the
Legacy of Slavery, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at
Harvard University.
Ms. Eryn Johnson, Independent Consultant in Creative
Place Making, and former Executive Director of Community Art
Center. Timothy McCarthy, Adjunct Lecturer on Public Policy.
Dr. Tiya Miles, did an extraordinary work as a Professor of
History at Harvard University. Dr. Janie Ward, another--a
longtime Canter Bridgian--sorry, longtime Canter Bridgian,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

The members of the Advisory Committee was Mr. Greggy

who teaches at Harvard University.
And again, the staff and consultants to this--our
project, this work was Ora Grodsky, Neal Alpert, Suryani
Dewa Siriana Dewa, Valerie Beaudrault, Charles Sullivan,
213
Packet Pg. 450

2

Sarah Burks, and Jason Weeks. And I want to thank each of
them for all the work and the time that they put into it.
Because even though the Committee met for, um, six weeks or

between that time pulling the information together for
presentations and then ultimately putting together the
report.
Our desired outcomes was to develop our procedures for
review and assessment of those monuments, memorials, and
markers, which may be viewed as inconsistent with the values
of Cambridge, by which we made a, just sitting there,
prioritizes anti-racism, equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Um, developed a set of possible actions that could be
employed to remediate problematic monuments, memorials, and
markers. Make recommendations for how to determine which
individuals or events might be newly recognized with the
monument, public art, memorial, or a marker.
And then address how Cambridge--how the committee's

recommendation can live on as an actionable process in the
City. It was, uh, again, very, very hard work. Members came
diligently to all meetings after we did a lot of research,
looked at a lot of materials, reviewed, um, the work that
214
Packet Pg. 451

2

came out of the New York Commission on monuments, markers,
and memorials.
We came back with principles and guidelines that the

markers, memorials, and public art. But also look at
anything that might come up going forward in terms of any
monument, marker, memorial, public art, that a group or
institution wanted to put on public land. What criteria that
they would have to, um, follow. Quite engaging.
We then took--once the report was put together, we took
it to at least 100 people, uh, some young people to
evaluate, were we going in the right direction? Was this
good work? Were we using a very good tool by which the City
could make a determination on whether or not this particular
piece of work was egregious or going forward with someone
individual who wanted to put on public land.
Again, public land that may or may not be fitting or
keeping with our social mores that we put forward, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 28, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

City could then use in looking at our current monuments,

through our policy procedures and, and, and, um, policies
and procedures. So this, this memorandum would be heavy for
you to you this evening. I would hope that you accept placed
on file. It will be forwarded to the City Manager or the
215

2

City Manager to then take action as to how he would
implement the process, because Advisory Committee really
needs to be appointed to carry out the actionable items that

So if a group--individual or group wanted to place a
piece of public art on City land, they would have to come
through this Advisory, and that advisory would measure that
public art, memorial, or marker, to make sure that it was in
keeping with the criteria that we had placed. We also have a
mechanism through which an individual or group could say, we
looked at this particular piece of public art, memorial, or
marker, and we feel as though it does not, uh, keep with the
spirit of diversity, equity, and anti-racism. And then what
to do with that.
It was a hard work. It was enjoyable work. I learned a
lot. We have thousands of more memorials, markers, and
public art in the City. Um, one of the things that we always
end our meetings with is, now that you know about this, go

Siddiqui. I wanted to call the attention of the Council to
this memo that Councillor Carlone and I wrote up. It's a
very brief and concise summary of the two meetings that we

input into next year's budget from the City Council and from
the public, uh, based on the City Council goals.
And it was spurred by, uh, many people on the Council
wanting to have input into the process, uh, before the
budget is laid before us, which will happen--uh, start to
happen department by department in May. And to briefly
summarize the memo, we as Co-chairs had agreed to summarize
what we heard. And this is a chance, if, if we did not
capture what people thought was the sense of that meeting,
now is the time to say something.
This is something that the City has, um, under review
and hopefully will be taken into account of the priorities
of the Council overall with reference to the budget that's
already under development. And those are where six areas

environmental justice investment to match the need and
urgency of that issue. And as a side note, if you haven't
read the all news articles on the IPCC Report this morning,
it's stunning and it's, uh, clear that that particular, um,
item has to be, uh, something the City works on.
Anyway, progress on municipal broadband and digital
equity, and then open space in tree canopy expansion,
especially in areas of the City most vulnerable to heat
island. So again, if, if we didn't capture the sense of the
Council, we are happy to amend this memo and send it onto
the City Council. Or if you just want to send us in for any,
uh, thoughts after this meeting, that's fine. I just wanted
to make sure that we had all had a chance to, uh, reflect on
this. It's an important part of us setting up for next year

people's increasing search for alternatives to driving. And

Gleb Bahmutov, 19 Winslow Street, spoke on City
Manager Agenda Number 12. He mentioned that his wife uses
an electric scooter to commute from Porter Square to
Somerville every day for work. He personally prefers riding
his bike for transportation but finds Porter Square
challenging due to the lack of separation between the cars
and the bike lanes. He does not believe that drivers or
pedestrians are responsible for this issue. He expressed

delay in the implementation of the Porter Square
Improvement Project due to supply and labor shortages.
Itamar Turner-Trauring, Oxford Street, spoke on City
Manager Agenda Number 12. He wanted to discuss compromises
in the cycling safety ordinance. Oxford Street is not
included in the timeline, and only a small percentage of
city streets are getting bike lanes. The Cambridge Bikes
group has been advocating for the completion of this
network since 2018, but it will take an additional five
years to be done. This compromise has already resulted in
numerous injuries, so it is crucial to minimize delays in
future projects.

George Scheeloch, 81 School Street, spoke on City
Manager Agenda Number 12. He expressed disappointment about
the delay in implementing protected bike lanes in Porter
Square. The city manager's statement explained the
obstacles that have prevented meeting the May 1st deadline.
He mentioned that when Darryl Willis was killed while
biking in Harvard Square in 2020, the city took immediate
action to add protected bike lanes there to prevent similar
tragedies in the future. He hopes that the city will
prioritize safety over public relations and complete the
project with urgency, so that residents of Cambridge can
have a safer Porter Square.

Agenda Number 12. He is a 68-year-old Cambridge resident, a
30-year homeowner on Richdale Avenue, and an active
multimodal mover who uses a compact car, hybrid bike, and
sturdy walking shoes to navigate through the city. He
supports the city's plans to upgrade the cycling safety
infrastructure of Mass Ave and Porter Square and expresses
gratitude for the work and thoughtfulness of the council
and professional staff. However, he believes that the
Porter Square area is particularly vulnerable to tragic
outcomes and urges the council to proceed with the existing
plan.

for the infrastructure that has been put in place and hopes
for a safe route as soon as possible.

Safety, she works at Harvard University and uses a bike for
transportation. Her most direct route to work is only about
a mile and a half up and down Mass Ave, but she doesn't
ride on Mass Ave. due to a near miss and crash in Porter
Square between Breach Beach and Rosalyn. Gloria is 56 years
old and has osteoporosis and orthopedic complaints, but
still enjoys riding a bike. She feels forced to choose
between her safety and access to local shops and services.

the design isn't based on studies with input from all

but now the city is threatening to reduce parking to zero
in Porter and 40 to 50%. This means businesses are
drastically off in some cases 40 to 45%. The mitigation is
to put parking meters and loading zones on side streets.
This whole process is backwards and needs to be assessed

He said that it is confusing to understand what one order
is doing for another, and that who are really hurting are
EE applicants. He also questioned why this type of
conversation wasn't had between counselors and shared with
the EE. He added that the purpose of the original order was
to put money back in the pockets of EEs, and that if the
second order is more aggressive and more helpful, that's
great, but why wasn't this communicated to Councillor
Simmons or all the EE? He concluded that this pitting one
black group against another is reprehensible and that it
needs to be addressed.

Agenda Item Number 1, a communication transmitted from
Louis DePasquale, city manager relative to a recommendation
that in accordance with the requirements of the

Council adopt an order for the statement of interest form
for the replacement of the Amigo School Building rep-roof. And this was pulled by Councillor Nolan. And I know
that there was a-- there was a typo and I thought it'd been
fixed, but we'll-- we'll get it taken care of. Councillor
Nolan.
PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. I, um, read through

this and I'm glad that, uh, there's multiple, uh, tasks.
This is, I believe, just about the building roof for this
school. There's, um, that building is one of the oldest in
our public school district. It's also one that is seriously
out of compliance with a number of, uh, school-related, um,
uh, current measures, including how many bathrooms there
are. I mean, it is just a school that needs so much more

than this.
So I'm just curious. I'm-- I know I will support this.
I always wanna support the school committee, but I would be
remiss in not acknowledging that I think there's much more
36

to be done in that school. That is the absolute largest
elementary school we have in our district. It's over 400
students. It is in a-- a kind of landlock place.

and your colleagues that I know that should be on the
agenda at the school committee for understanding how to
ensure that those students have a-- a-- a better and a much
more appropriate place, uh, to learn. But for this
particular one, I'm just was surprised there was only the
roof as opposed to some of the other, um, very serious
needs at that school.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I think the roof was brought

to our attention as just being the-- as-- as stated
category 5, and I think because of the pri-prioritization, the roof-- and given the age of the roof,
um, and, you know, the other things, there's been
situations where things have been able to be taken care of.
But this one, you know, just as-- is much more urgent. So I

Uh, through you to, Madam Mayor, I

think you covered it all. Basically, we've been very
37

successful about applying for these major maintenance
grants to the MSBA. We get reimbursed at about 40%, and
this was, uh, something that the facilities department, uh,

There's no guarantee it will be funded, but again,
this is just one of the vehicles to get funding to support
these infrastructure improvements. Um, and clearly
protecting the asset is probably the first thing we need to
do to make sure that there's no damage to the building. So,
again, this is something that we've done before and we've
been successful with the MSBA to get funding, and this
would allow us to basically take care of one major system.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor, this is really a strategy of when we can address
roofs and get some support. We do it, I think is-everybody knows after the Tobin School is completed before
that process, there needs to be a decision, and it's been
in discussion where there'll be funds for one school. Was--

the Tobin was 250, or should we be looking at three or four
schools and addressing as many needs as possible. That
discussion's ongoing, but that decision's been not made,
and I think that's-- we'll be down the line for the council

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Mm-hmm. Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah. Thank you. I

We've funded a number of our school projects. Uh, again, I- I also encourage the city and the school department. I
know there's an-- an RFP out now.
We heard about it the last building, uh, um, an LTP
meeting here, that there is an extensive process to review
every single building that was done, I know, in 10 years
ago. And I also just hope the city is allocating funds so
that we can continue to maintain all of our buildings so we
don't have to replace them, which we have had to do a nu-a number of times.
So I hope that we get to a better place with that.
Again, I-- I don't wanna hold this up. I know that MSBA is
a good source of funds, but again, this in particular is a
school building that has been inequitable in its, um,

ability to provide to students really the-- the-- the-- the

our largest school with the highest percentage of Hispanic
Latinx students, I think it's really something we need to

It is very much, uh, unlike what is required to be
carried in a police, uh, police officer's vehicle or a

pursuing this type of vehicle. We have purchased nothing
but hybrid vehicles for staff positions. We have a couple
of, uh, vehicles on order, uh, have been for quite some
time. There's issues as-- as everybody is well aware with,

unless there's an emergency in order to do this. And if I
don't try to write it, then I can't vote for it, because,
again, until I know for sure there's not an EV, we just
cannot continue to-- to not, uh, walk the talk of ensuring
that every single vehicle we have is as emissions free as
possible.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to Ms. Semonoff, I just had, um, I know I
emailed you earlier today. I feel like this is a great
initiative that we don't hear enough about here at the city
council. But, um, in terms of the number of students that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

other things and we were a partner in that. So this

this coach sees each and-- each and every year at the
Bunker Hill Community College, do you have any sense of how
many students this serves?
ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER ELLEN SEMONOFF:

Sure. Um,

49
Packet Pg. 516

3

through you, Madam Mayor, um, I can give you a brief update
on that. And we welcome the opportunity at the appropriate
committee hearing to have our wonderful director, Tawan

on the work that we're doing.
Um, so right now we support the three college coaches,
support students primarily at Bunker Hill and at UMass
Boston. And they support students who graduate from
Cambridge Range and Latin or from the Community Learning
Center. Um, and there are other community programs which
also have college coaches. The workforce has, um, and root
support some of their students at, um, different, um,
higher educational institutions.
Um, the work that the college coaches do begins
earlier, but primarily in the spring, um, supporting
students who are going to UMass Boston or Bunker Hill
Community College to ensure a smooth transition from high
school. And the students we support, I wanna be clear, are

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Garrett, um, and the team of coaches come and present, um,

a subset of college going students, and they are first
generation college going students, um, um, low-income first
generation college going students.
So this is not a support to any student who might be
50
Packet Pg. 517

3

going. It really is a subset of students. Um, the students
we support are largely, but not exclusively students of
color. Um, they're a combination of American born students

right now we-- the three college coaches collectively are
supporting close to 300 students, and the intensity of the
support for those students varies for some students-students who had a plan to go somewhere else and that plan
fell through.
Our coaches work intensely with those students in the
summer following graduation to ensure that if Bunker Hill
is what they want, that we can help them get enrolled, help
them choose classes, help, um, support their financial aid
related issues. For students who had a plan to go to Bunker
Hill Community College or UMass Boston, then our coaches
support them, um, in a variety of ways as they do, um, as
they choose their college courses, to connect them to the
academic support that's available to them at the college,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and students who, um, have immigrated to this country. Um,

is that they might be reluctant to access on their own.
They also support them in referrals and support for
those referrals for other student-related issues that
relate to their personal needs. Um, throughout the
51
Packet Pg. 518

3

pandemic, when Bunker Hill was large and-- and UMass Boston
were virtual, the coaches played a really important role in
ensuring that students had both the technology that they

with the universities, and we worked to actually provide
loaner or, um, uh, technology so students would be able to
participate.
I would say that another important-- two other
important pieces to highlight here, and I know we can talk
at another time more. One, is, um, our, um, coaches
supporting students as they transition from completing
their two-year degree to actually moving on to get a fouryear degree where that's what they want to do. That's one
piece.
A second piece is supporting students who, for a
variety of reasons, need to stop out because if they need
to stop out, it's critically important the manner in which
they do that to preserve their ability to return to ensure

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

needed, um, worked with the high school to get that work

that they aren't saddled with debt as a result of leaving.
And so a critically important piece is both supporting them
and then what are they going to do because they're stopping
out.

And there, there's an intense partnership between the
College Success Coaches and our Office of Workforce
Development, because many times what those students really

the issues that are preventing them from staying in school.
We've also enrolled, frankly, a number of those
students who don't really know what comes next for them
that are internship program called Next Up, which we've
talked about here before. Some of the students in Next Up
are the students who've stopped out from college success.
So let me stop for a minute. I've gone on.

explanation about what the coaches do there. Yeah, I think
having a larger conversation to hear about, well, to-- to
meet Tawan, I think none, uh, many of us haven't met her
yet-- them yet. And, um, I know that the housing authority

And so trying to figure out how, um, how we are as a
community supporting our students who are going off to
Bunker Hill or, um, to UMass Boston. So I think your idea

of having a larger conversation at some point is a good
one. So, uh, thank you again for all the, uh, information
on this particular grant. And I'm all set. I'll yield back.

corporate contracts and purchases di-- identify any vendors
or manufacturers whose products are used to perpetuate

Cambridge-- Cambridge's policy on discrimination. This was
pulled by Councillor Carlone. Councillor Carlone?
COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to the manager and the solicitor. Um, thank you
for this very honest, uh, response. Um, when you're looking
at the whole world, it's hard to know what you're going to
focus on.
As you might recall, there was one company that was at
the center of this, and I expect if we brought that up
again, there might be a mixed response, but I could imagine
a more focused request that looks at, let's say all
computer companies or something like that, that we deal
with in the city that we have contracts with that would
limit the amount of companies to explore. And I assume that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

violations of international human rights laws and

would be the only way to respond to your recommendation
that it's too much to do everything. Does that make sense
as a future focus?
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Uh, thank you. Through

55
Packet Pg. 522

3

you Madam Mayor to Councillor Carlone, the purchasing agent
is here as well. And perhaps she might be better able to
answer that question because I think part of the concern

come and go. So sometimes we have a contract, then it ends,
then we're entering into another contract.
So it's-- it's-- as I understand it, it's just not
that easy to do-- to sort of cast this big net. I mean,
obviously it's a smaller sphere if it's just for computer
contracts versus everything else we do. Of course, that
makes it more limited. But I still think there would be
challenges and perhaps Ms. Unger can speak to that as well.
COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:
ELIZABETH UNGER:

Please.

Through you, Madam Mayor, I agree

with the city solicitor that there could still be some
issues, although the narrowing would certainly be helpful,
uh, to begin the process to examine not just corporate
contracts, but my understanding of the order was that it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that she expressed in her response is that our contracts

addressed purchases as well.
So I would see that as purchases that are made without
requiring the full city's articles of agreement, the
contract having been executed in place. So we would still
56
Packet Pg. 523

3

need to review the purchase orders, um, and try to do a
search based on the commodity in that case. And that could
be somewhat difficult and problematic.

department to be able to identify particular purchases or
contracts with any particular corporate entity would be to
have those names identified for us by the council, and then
we could do a review of any contracts that are in place and
any purchase orders that have been issued to those specific
entities. But to take it a step further as well, if I fully
understand the policy order the way it was written, that
would satisfy one element of what the council was seeking.
Another aspect is also products that are being
purchased that are manufactured by some of these
cooperations. And that could be a bit more problematic
because-- I'll use an example. We have a pen. Okay? The pen
may have been manufactured by one of the corporations in
question, but the contract to purchase the pen or the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I think the most efficient way for the purchasing

purchase of the pen might not be in a direct relationship
between the city and the manufacturer.
The pen may have been purchased from yet another
vendor. And at some point, in order to really delve deeply
57
Packet Pg. 524

3

down into every purchase, we would need to review the
actual invoices. Sometimes that would identify the products
that were being purchased. And that's just if we're going

first steps, if the council could provide the names of the
corporate entities in question, we could do a search to
say, do we have a contract with X? Have we issued purchase
orders to X?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you. Thank you

all for the response. Um, this was pretty much what we
expected when that policy order was changed. How could you
do the whole world? And, um, and I agree that we have to
get more specific and many companies, some of which I
suspect we work with their questions.
There's another computer company that, um, has some
issues as well that might be worth looking into. So the
goal of this is strictly to not hurt other people and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to go extremely deep to that level. But certainly, the

support those companies fully. That-- that is the whole
goal. And, um, I appreciate the answer and thank you all
for the- your response. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Uh, thank you. Um,

through you, Madam Mayor, I-- your pen example actually

complication, and correct me if I'm wrong, but not all-sometimes a product can be made with pro-- some with parts
from several different companies, right?
And I would imagine a pen is probably pretty simple,
but if you're talking about a computer or something else,
you might have, you know, the-- the hardware is made by one
company and the screws to put the, you know, thing together
is made by another company. And so I could imagine that
this could even be more complicated than-- than-- than
we're thinking. 'cause you might have one product that has
several companies that are involved in the manufacturing of
that company.
Not just the-- not just the company in which we are
buying from, which our contract is with, but then you could

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

made me just think of how this-- another layer of potential

have several companies beneath that, that are involved in
actually making the-- making the product.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. Thank you.

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

for this response. Um, un-- unfortunately, um, this is
effectively a-- a refusal to comply with the policy order.
And I certainly as understand the complexities that are
being raised, but I don't think that prevents us from doing
anything.
I certainly understand that there might be situations
where we can't prevent the purchase of a certain product
or-- or won't catch it in time, but- but this response
basically says we're-- we're not even gonna try. And that's
not surprising because as Councillor Carlone said, um, when
we removed specific companies from the original order, then
obviously we made it more difficult for the administration
to implement it.
Um, but I still think there is a way to implement--

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. Through you to the city manager and staff, thank you

implement a human rights screen. And I guess, you know, we
may have to do another order that-- that more specifically
directs the administration to do that. But I-- I don't
agree that there's nothing we can do here. So I-- I am
60

disappointed by this, uh, response. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Is there anyone else who would

like to comment? Councillor Carlone.
I appreciate the

response in part because in fact, you didn't have to
respond. Um, we have a long list where we've not got in
detailed responses, so I thank you for doing that. And it
just means that if this is going to be pursued, we come and
talk and figure out how to conceive it. So I thank all
three of you. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, um, just wanted to understand a little
bit better what the city's involvement is with these
parking meters. Are we, uh, doing enforcement or are we
getting any of the revenues or-- or is it per just purely
granting permission for DCR to operate these parking
meters?
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, sure. Through you, Mayor

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Siddiqui, um, it-- it's really the latter. We don't have
any involvement in the operation of them or the enforcement
or the revenue. It's purely just that because of this, um,
state law that was passed, um, they need to seek approval
62
Packet Pg. 529

3

from the appropriating authority, which in this case is the
city council in the city or town in which the meters are
located in order to activate them.
Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, I believe in-- in Revere, they did
agree to some kind of revenue split. So is is that an
option here for us or no,
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Through you, Mayor Siddiqui, um,

we've not discussed that with them. Um, we do have some
representatives from DCR available in the Zoom. Um, so I
don't know if there's anything that, uh, Mike Nelson or,
um, Hazel may want to add. But, um, in any case, we've not
had that conversation.
There-- there's not a tremendous number of meters. I
don't actually know what the revenue was in the past when
they were active for a period of time. Um, but I think we-we didn't, um, like I said, we just didn't have that-- that

Um, she could maybe comment on-- on what the numbers
might be. But, um, yeah, we had not had that conversation
and we've just had kind of ongoing dialogue and, um, I
don't know. And that would certainly not be something I
could-- it would be a decision I could make at my level.
And also don't know if, um, just with the money in
operating and managing the program, if it would still be
in, um, if it would still be something that DCR would be
able to, to support, uh, with the money going into the
program equaling what the revenue would be if it were to be
a split. Um, but beyond that, again, we have not, uh,
discussed it beyond that.

Mayor. I do, uh, through you, I appreciate the answers. Um,
and, you know, I-- I'll-- I'll support this order, but I
think it is, uh, important to-- for the manager to come
back with some more information on how much the revenues
64

are and whether there's any potential, uh, to-- to split
the revenues and, you know, from DCR, whether that's at all
an option for on their end. Uh, just so we can understand

ar this meeting.

can certainly follow up on that, um, you know, subsequent
to this meeting.
HAZEL CLARENCE:

Um, hi, this is Hazel Clarence, the

parking manager for DCR. Um, as Mike Nelson-- Mike Nelson
mentioned, we did not have the conversation regarding
revenue share, but, um, during the short period in which we
did operate in re-- in Cambridge, we-- we received roughly
$30,000 in revenue.

slipping on ice or twisting ankles, nothing serious, or has
there been a serious incident?
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, correct. Through you Mayor

Siddiqui, um, and-- and you can definitely still refer to
me as Mr. Barr if you prefer. Um, the-- yeah, these are
just the sort of typical workplace. Unfortunately, you
know, I don't want to minimize them, but this kind of
typical workplace, um, injuries that occur and-- and in
some cases lead to ongoing medical bills.
And specifically, these are-- these are medical bills
that we're required to pay under the worker's comp program,
but they have to be out paid out of a specific account. So
that's the reason for the transfer. But yes, nothing that I

associated with the implementation of the cycling safety
ordinance. Council Toner, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to the city manager or Director Barr, uh,
depending on who should answer it. So, uh, first of all, I
wanna thank you, uh, both for all the work you've done on
the issue and, uh, on this particular item.
Um, I intend to vote for it, um, uh, particularly
because half of it is for things that, uh, a number of us
have been asking for, which is an impact study and, uh,
more outreach to the community. But I'm wondering or hoping
that, uh, not now, but in very short order, if you could
possibly provide a list, uh, of the cost of the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to the general fund traffic and parking department,

implementation, uh, for all the things that have been done
so far by neighborhood, uh, North Cambridge, Brattle
Street, et cetera. Just, you know, the- the-- the total
cost of those.
69

3

And then I know you don't know what it's gonna cost in
the future, but some projected cost of what you think, uh,
the remainder of the project would be. Just so that one, I

real answer. So if that-- that would be helpful. Um, so
that's the only real question I have on number 1.
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, through Mayor Siddiqui, um, so

yes, we we're working actively to compile that information.
We-- we have most of it, but I just wanna make sure it's
fully up-to-date, but we're certainly happy to share that
with the council, um, separately in terms of what we've
expended to date.
And it's-- as you noted, it's a little challenging to
make truly accurate estimates of what the future will cost,
just because we're still gaining a lot of experience with
these projects and-- and each project's a little bit
different, but we can certainly try to make it an estimate
based on the sort of per mile or per foot cost of what

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

get to ask this question all the time and I-- I have no

we've in installed to date, what we expect to be the cost.
I-- I-- one thing I just wanna make sure to mention,
because I know there's been some discussion about what's
already been expended versus what's to come, is that-- on
70
Packet Pg. 537

3

any specific project is that these projects, unlike typical
construction projects where, you know, engineering and
design and planning might be, you know, 10 or 15% of the

you know, the-- the implementation is relatively
inexpensive as, um, as compared to a large construction
project.
And so we spend, you know, a similar amounts on
planning, design, and outreach as we do on the actual
implementation. So people shouldn't assume that 'cause
we've spent, you know, several hundred thousand dollars on
planning and design that we're then gonna spend several
million dollars on implementation, obviously. But we'll
certainly share all that information in greater detail in
the near future.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

And Madam Mayor, sorry, I--

I take back what I said about the last question. Just it
would also be helpful, I think for us as Councillors and

the community at large, I know there's a lot of passion
about it. Uh, there's an awful lot of-- some accurate
information, some misinformation and some mistaken
information that's-- that's floating around out there. But,

um, and I don't mean to be insensitive, um, but, you know,

you know, a number of people have written to me and-- and I
think all of us about multiple deaths in Porter Square. I
just would like that to be resolved, that there have not
been multiple deaths in Porter Square.
One is tragic enough, but, you know, I I also know
there have not been-- been multiple deaths. Um, and then
the last thing I would ask, and this is a bit-- a bit

Thank you. Just on the, um,

uh, item number 11 first, um, connecting this with the, uh,
study that we asked for at, uh, the last City Council
meeting. Um, I'd be curious to see how much we're spending,
um, on community, um, outreach. Uh, especially I know
there's been concern around economic impact for small
businesses.
I'd be curious to see how those numbers compare. Um,
uh, yeah, so I just wanted to make that point and just to
connect it to the study that was passed last week. Um, I
guess now that we're also connecting this to-- or jointly
considering item number 12, um, I was wondering if we have,
um, an estimate for, uh, when, uh, the bike lanes will, uh,
the protected back lens will now be complete. Uh, there's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

the indication of the delay. I don't know if we have a date
in mind for when they will be complete.
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, through you, Mayor Siddiqui, we--

we don't have a specific date in mind. I-- I think what
74
Packet Pg. 541

3

we've-- where we're headed in-- in my mind at least is, you
know, we want to continue to move this forward as quickly
as possible. Um, and so I don't want to sort of say, oh,

up against that date just because we sort of arbitrarily
stated something.
It's just a, you know, we know that we can't get it
done by April 30th, and so we wanted to give the council
that information and the opportunity to-- to weigh in on
that. Um, but at the same time, I don't want to say, oh,
it'll-- it'll be so far out because I think our-- our-- our
goal is still to do it as quickly as we can.
Certainly, this construction season, you know, which
means would mean at the latest sometime this fall, but I'm
certainly not saying that we intend to wait that long if-unless there's some reason that we have to. And- and I
would certainly say that the additional work that we
anticipate needing to do, you know, in terms of outreach

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

you know, we'll get it done by X date and then get pushed

understand the concern and we-- we discussed that as a
issue at length before we submitted this communication.
But, you know, I think we feel that we don't want this
to become the norm. We don't want this to become the
expectation. And to be fair, that goes both ways. That
means both that, um, you know, we need to make it clear to
the community that, you know, we are-- we are still
proceeding on-- on schedule for everything else as-- as we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

impact you think that this will have on future

stated in there.
And-- and that the deadlines and the-- and the dates
and the ordinance still remain very much in our minds, but
also requires us to make sure that, you know, we are moving
76
Packet Pg. 543

3

forward as quickly as we can to-- to make sure that we're
not in a position where we are up against the clock again
as we move through other projects, but that we have the

have all those conversations, do the implementation in the
right sequence, and not find ourselves, you know, up
against the clock.
So I think for all of us, this is certainly a lesson
learned in terms of what the-- the needs are going forward.
And so I think our hope is that we-- we don't find
ourselves in this situation again as we proceed through the
rest of the-- the deadlines in the ordinance.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Go ahead.

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

I just wanna follow

up. I think it's-- it's real important to note that when we
created this ordinance, we had a concern about this date,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

time, we've started the process early enough, that we can

and we've done everything we can to get to this date.
However, realistically now we know we can't. We don't think
moving forward it's gonna affect other dates.
I don't want to say never, but it's not-- not our
77
Packet Pg. 544

3

intent to keep on coming back to-- to-- to move this back.
It was just this area here, based on everything we're at,
based on where we even thought we were gonna be a year and

make. Uh, but the commitments there to get it done as
quickly as we can.
And Joe said, and, you know, down the road, who knows
what's gonna happen, but it's clearly not the intent. I
want to bring that home that this would be an ongoing issue
of delay, delay, delay. That's not our intent of anybody. I
just wanted to bring that home for sure. And that's why I
think it's important that we get a vote tonight that
recognize is that we're not trying to say no to the
ordinance. We're just trying to say, we just can't make
this deadline.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We're gonna go to councillor--

back to Councillor Azeem, and then Councillor McGovern, and
then the Vice Mayor.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

a half ago, to be very honest, was a real difficult day to

Um, I just wanted to end

with, um, I really do appreciate how difficult it is both
in that, uh, you know, it's a new ordinance, it's a big
change. And also City Council has been passing extra, uh,
78
Packet Pg. 545

3

committees and, um, you know, extra studies, uh, and
requesting those to be done.
And I understand that in this particular case, uh,

that we have a delay, I understand why it's being done. And
I just wanna be careful, uh, and intentional that, you
know, it's okay for this specific instance, but not going
forward. Um, I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you. Excuse me.

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Through you, uh, for, uh, number
11. First, um, when you, Mr. Barr or Director Barr, um,
your Highness Barr, um, when you do this, um, when you come
back with this report of the breakdown of cost, uh, now
this may be a little different because you're-- and I think
this is-- I'm gonna get to this in a second.
I'm-- but sort of adding to the confusion is that
there are sort of three different conversations all going

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that requires a delay. And I think while I'm disappointed

on about Mass Ave at the same time. Um, so if people are,
you know, if we're looking at coming back with a report
people have requested about sort of the total
implementation of all this, I also think the breakdown has
79
Packet Pg. 546

3

to be other benefits that are coming out of this, right?
Because maybe a quick build, there's less, 'cause it's a
quick build and there's less construction.

being spent on River Street, right? That's tied up into a
whole bunch of other things that are happening on River
Street that are gonna make the street so much better. And
so I think people are looking, you know, I will say we
spend lots of money, a lot more than $700,000 on repairing
streets for cars and nobody ever asks us to do an
accounting of that.
Um, so I think this is, you know, a concern that
people have, but it's also a concern because some folks
don't want this to happen, and if it's too expensive, they
can say it's too expensive. So I think it's gonna be really
important to be really clear about what is-- what's being
spent on the bike lane itself versus other things that are
improving the streets for people who don't cycle.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

But with, you know, if you look at the money that's

Um, with regard to number 12, you know, as I
mentioned, there's sort of three different conversations
that are all happening at the same time, right? We-- we did
the North Mass Ave, um, you know, route 16 to-- to Dudley,
80
Packet Pg. 547

3

and now there are discussions about how-- and Councillor
Toner-- I give Councillor Toner a lot of credit on how to
mitigate those negative circumstances. Uh, you know, and do

So there's that conversation about how to make that part
better.
Then there's the second conversation, which is really
about Porter Square 700 feet on each side. I mean, what
we're talking about with this quick build is really 1,400
feet roughly right? Of Mass Ave, which is not a lot, and
it's not a lot that when you look at parking, which seems
to be the hot issue, a lot of that stretch there is no
parking because you're talking about actually the middle of
the Porter Square intersection itself and the bridge and—
and— and whatnot.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

So that's the second

conversation that's happening. And then the third
conversation is the rest of Mass Ave from sort of where the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we rent off other in parking lots? Do we get more meters?

quick build will end down, down to Harvard, you know, down
to Waterhouse and-- and-- and back up. And I think some of
this is getting conflated. Like we-- we-- we heard even in
public comment tonight, we should delay that people
81
Packet Pg. 548

3

supported the delay of this quick build because the city-so the city can look at taking out the median and the
watch. That's not part of the conversation about the quick

So this delay is not to look at taking out the median.
That's a conversation that we're having about the rest of
Mass Ave, which is further down the road, not scheduled to
be done for-- I don't even think it has a date to be done.
And so when we hear folks that are talking about all that
parking that's gonna be removed, um, that hasn't even been
decided yet, or really taught, that conversation is just
happening and there's no deadline. Am I correct?
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, through Mayor Siddiqui, you-- you

did an excellent job councillor of summarizing it, probably
better than any of us might have. Um, but yes, exactly what
you said, I think is-- is true. And the-- just to say for
the segments that aren't quick builds, so not Porter Square
and-- and not the Route 16 to Dudley Street portions,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

build. Correct?

those, there was a public meeting or community meeting last
week online, um, and will be coming to the council with,
you know, representative from DPW obviously, um, in the
near future because you-- there's a construction schedule
82
Packet Pg. 549

3

or-- or an implementation schedule that has to be agreed on
by the end of April or the beginning of May.
Uh, so you'll be hearing a lot more about that

yet. Um, and so, you know, I think the-- the concerns about
the parking in those segments, well, it's-- certainly we
hear them, the-- there's not an imminent plan to remove
that parking. And like you said, we're still figuring out
both the plan and the schedule.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Right. And-- and I

think, um, thank you, Madam Mayor. Just real quickly
through you, you know, I think as Councillor Toner said,
you know, as much as we can do-- we can do to really
communicate all of this, because I do think it's confusing,
I think it gets conflated and you have folks who have
businesses on Mass Ave who are calling me and saying, you
guys are gonna take my parking wing next month.
And it's like, nope, that's your part. You're further

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

schedule, but as you noted, we don't have that schedule set

down and that process is still happening. So it's-- it is
confusing and whatever role we played in that, we should
try to mitigate that and fix that. Um, so, uh, thank you.
And again, like Councillor Azeem said, you know, I-- I wish
83
Packet Pg. 550

3

this was on schedule for, you know, the quick bill, but I
certainly understand why it's not.
And there were contingencies built into the ordinance

you know, you put in your letter that this can-- the intent
is to have this done this construction season. If you had
said 2024, I might feel differently, but I trust that
you'll do everything in your power to get this done, uh,
uh, expeditiously. Uh, thank you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We have the Vice Mayor,

Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Carlone, and then
Councillor Nolan.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Oh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to the city manager and Director Barr.
Um, thank you for bringing this forward tonight. I-- I
think I express that many of us are really disappointed
that there is this delay, but I'm also deeply grateful to
the staff for listening to the concerns in the neighborhood

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to allow for delays if-- if-- if necessary. Um, and so, um,

and being committed to the best outcome.
I know we've put in greater community engagement
procedures, um, to allow for more engagement to ensure that
the design is optimal and the staff has had to build in-84
Packet Pg. 551

3

build in that sufficient time to incorporate that feedback
into the project. I really do appreciate the time and
dedication that traffic and parking and DPW staff and

project.
But I hope also to see this as early and the
construction season as possible, especially since we know
when we heard public comment cycling, um, rises in the
spring and summer, so there's gonna be a lot more cyclists
on our streets and this intersection is very dangerous. I-I hear the concern that Councillor Toner, uh, brought
forward before. I mean, there's a lot of near misses, um,
in that intersection that we don't hear about. Um, so those
cannot be overstated.
Um, the one thing I did wanna ask, I know when we put
in the Mass Ave lanes from Putnam AV to Inman Street, there
was some supply chain issues around the Flex Post and
ordering supplies. Are we thinking about pre-- like

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

engaging the public during this critical infrastructure

ordering those supplies as early as possible so that when
we are ready for that implementation, even if we've ordered
extra supplies and we-- we know we have a bunch more to be?
Like, I know that there are supply chain issues all up and
85
Packet Pg. 552

3

down the road. Um, how are we thinking about pre-ordering
supplies and making sure we have them on hand to put them
in as soon as possible?
Um, sure. Through-- through you Mayor

Siddiqui, so specific to that issue, we have been working
with our suppliers, um, to make sure that like, if-- if we
say we're-- we have a contract to install a thousand flex
posts or whatever it is, that they actually order those all
at the beginning to avoid some of the problems we've had.
So I, you know, we'll continue to keep an eye on it and
make sure that we have the supplies we need, but it's
certainly very much on our mind and we've tried to mitigate
against that.
So it's a very important concern and we are trying to
make sure that we don't, you know, we don't want to sort of
delay this by some amount of time and then-- and then come
to realize, oh, and now we can't get it done because of
that. So we'll definitely make sure we keep an eye on that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

JOSEPH E. BARR:

Vice mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, yeah, I would hate for us to get to, you know,
July or August and then we don't have the Flex post and
86
Packet Pg. 553

3

then we miss the construction season and then we're sort of
a year behind. So keeping an eye on that, I think thank you
for-- for saying that you guys are doing that. I think

gonna be missing this deadline, but I totally understand
where we are and I appreciate the team that is, uh, working
on this.
And I wanna say that I was at last week's community
meeting for the Mass Ave4 and I thought that it was really,
really well done. I wanna-- I wanna say thank you to the
staff that was there for putting together a great community
meeting. The format was great. Um, you know, they switched
it up with the questions and the answers and I think
everyone felt heard and felt responded to.
So I know that there's so much work that goes into
that. But thanks for-- I see your team back here and all
the folks that aren't in this room tonight. I just wanted
to say thank you. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

it'll be critical, but again, I am disappointed that we are

We will go to Councillor

Zondervan and then Councillor Carlone followed by
Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

87
Packet Pg. 554

3

Mayor. Through you, thanks to the city manager and staff
for this update. Um, I'm disappointed as well, but I-- I
wanted to respond quickly to the-- to the question of how

I-- I don't think we were really debating that, but
there have certainly been multiple deaths. There was one
bicyclist and-- and one pedestrian were both killed in
Porter Square in 2016. And some analysis that was done, uh,
by a member of the public indicates that the area in-- on
Mass Ave between Roseland and Beach Street has about 10
times as many car bike crashes at the average, uh, stretch
of similar length in Cambridge.
And as we know from the regular reports from, uh, Mr.
Jeneti, there are many accidents or,--or crashes that
happen in Cambridge that we otherwise wouldn't hear about.
And, you know, those injuries can still be, uh, lifechanging events for, uh, the-- the vulnerable road users.
So I-- I don't think we should be debating how dangerous

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

dangerous Porter Square really is.

this-- this intersection really is.
We-- we need to make sure that everyone is-- is
protected and safe. And so to that point, and-- and, you
know, several folks have mentioned that the ordinance
88
Packet Pg. 555

3

allows for certain delays. And-- and that is true. However,
I-- I've-- I've read it several times over the last few
days to try to find where this particular delay is

solicitor as to which provision of the ordinance allows the
administration to delay implementation on this particular
section.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

City solicitor.

CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Uh, through you Madam

Mayor, uh, I don't believe there is a specific section in
the ordinance that contemplated this particular request.
That's why I believe that the manager phrased it as a, uh,
report and seeking approval of the council.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, we-- we are approving this delay. I-- I
guess I didn't understand that either, because if there's
no provision under the ordinance for us to do that, then

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

justified. So I-- I would, uh, pose this question to the

how-- how can we approve the delay?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Uh, through you,

Madam Mayor, I-- I'll let the city solicitor jump in. We
cannot make this deadline and it's not from a lack of
89
Packet Pg. 556

3

effort. We just can't do it. Uh, we have fried and we will
continue to do it as quickly as we can. So we're asking the
council to support this delay even though it's not part of

council and the residents together. But this is clearly not
a delay for the sake of delay.
This is a delay because no matter what we do, we will
not make this date. And we wanna make the council aware of
that and hope that they would support because of all that's
going on our reasoning. And may I wanna make it clear that
it's clearly not a delay with the intent of delaying any
further projects. Uh, it-- it's a delay that we just can't
make the timeframe through no one's fault. It's just-- it's
unachievable.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank-- thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you, uh, to the city manager, I
certainly understand that there are, um, issues that-- that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the audience, because we are trying to work with the

you can't, you know, do anything about at this point, but
the ordinance does allow for temporary, uh, protected
likely installations, including using traffic cones or
other, uh, traffic control devices. So is-- is that also
90
Packet Pg. 557

3

not possible by May 1st.
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, through May-- excuse me, through

your Mayor Siddiqui, so I-- that-- that potentially could

although it would still be a much better project if we had
pavement markings, even if we did the-- didn't do flex post
initially, but did temporary devices.
But I think it-- it doesn't address the other, you
know, reasons that are in the memo in terms of outreach and
sequencing and things like that. So-- so Councillor
Zondervan is correct that, um, you know, that that is
contemplated in the ordinance. Um, but I don't think it-it solves for all of the issues that are causing us to, uh,
push this out a little bit.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan and then

I have a number of councillors. Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, uh, to the manager. I-- I appreciate

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

resolve some of the concerns around the installation,

that response. I-- I guess I would still like to see us put
in place even temporary, uh, protection because as the vice
mayor mentioned in-- in the spring and summer, we can
expect, uh, a lot more, uh, people to-- to use their bikes
91
Packet Pg. 558

3

to get through there.
And, you know, I-- I understand there's some other
challenges that that doesn't address, but it would still go

intersection. So I would appreciate if- if that would be
possible. And I-- I guess if-- if that's not part of what's
being proposed, then I-- I'm not gonna support, um, this
request for delay. But if-- if that can be included, then
I-- I'm willing to, uh, to support it. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Carlone and then Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor

through you to the manager and the director. Um, I wanna
thank both of you for telling us that even in the beginning
there was a time crunch that you were concerned about and
um, I felt it. But please know that when the council
doesn't hear that, we don't have a time crunch.
So our expectations and-- and we're all-- we work

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

a long way to-- to protecting, uh, people using that

together. So if there's a time crunch, it-- it, you know,
hearing what we're hearing today, we can't do it, I accept
that. And, you know, maybe next time, of course, maybe only
one of you will be here. Uh, we say that in the beginning
92
Packet Pg. 559

3

this is gonna be tough, but we'll do the best we can.
Um, I also want to say to those people listening, we
never talked about design strategy in these meetings in the

there certainly 'cause that's what I'm interested in what
my background is. But please understand community when they
see something implemented, the first phase, they assume
it's gonna be like that the rest of the street, even though
you know that's not gonna be the case.
So I understand the uproar and, um, we know everybody
here wants bike safety in this room. Everybody. Just think
about little kids. I'm not sure I'd want my grandson on
Mass Avenue for many, many years. But we know that. At the
same time, we also know small retail, small offices are the
heartbeat, the center of our neighborhoods, my
neighborhood, Paul's neighborhood, Patty's neighborhood,
but around the city, all our neighborhoods. So that is
almost as important, more important.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

council. We never talked about mitigation. I'm at fault

It depends on your perspective and we have to satisfy
it all in a way. So I always say let's do it right. And I
hear that's the rationale here. We gotta do better,
including mitigation. So my question, remind me, uh, here,
93
Packet Pg. 560

3

Director, the number of parking spaces in Porter is 35? I
can't recall. I'm sorry.
Um, I--

COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:
JOSEPH E. BARR:

On street. I'm sorry.

Through you, Mayor Siddiqui, I-- I

wish I could recall off the top of my head too, but I-- I
unfortunately can't. But it's-- it's roughly in the 30 to
40 range.
COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Yeah, it's under 40. I

remember that. Maybe it is only 30 or so. But nevertheless
that's 30 more than if we continue North Cambridge that
will be there. Although you've looked into options, I know
and you are also upgrading, I assume if there's a
pedestrian crossing that makes sense now you would
incorporate that up and down Mass Avenue.
To some neighborhoods that they're 600 feet apart is
jaywalking all the time. Even little kids, which scare the
heck outta me. So one big issue is are the wires and when

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

JOSEPH E. BARR:

will the MBTA take it down? And that opens up many
possibilities up and down Mass Avenue. I realize we don't
control that. We did get back money from Lechmere Station
and I would hope that we push and be willing to pay for
94
Packet Pg. 561

3

taking down the wires if that opens up a side of parking
after nine 30 up and down Mass Avenue. Are we considering
that? Can we talk about that? Is someone else coming

JOSEPH E. BARR:

Through you Mayor Siddiqui, uh, Kathy

Watkins weigh in on that.
KATHY WATKINS:

Hi, through you, Madam Mayor, um, so

we are working closely with the MBTA. So, you know, the
dates are the middle of March. They are deactivating the
overhead line. So as of middle of March they'll no longer
be activated. They are working through their capital
improvement program to get funding to do the conversion of
the bus, um, the bus depot so they can convert from the
trolley's buses to the electric buses.
And so they would-- they're looking to have that work
completed by the end of 2024. We are meeting with them
weekly to understand the timing of the wires, which is
somewhat of a separate process. They have committed both to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

through the forefront?

us and then also in the public meeting they had about a
month ago that they would be removing those wires, but we
don't have a timeline for that. So we are still actively
working with them on that.
95
Packet Pg. 562

3

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

If I could, Madam Mayor,

through you, um, to the town engineer, they will not be

correct?
KATHY WATKINS:

Correct. Through you, Madam Mayor. So

as of March 15th, they are deactivating so they will no
longer be energized. They will still physically be there.
And so it simplifies some things in the sense of they're
not energized, but they are still physically there as of
middle of March. And then we're working on with them to
figure out the schedule for full removal of the wires.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Go ahead, Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

I'm sorry, Madam Mayor.

Through you. Uh, I can tell you that my neighborhood and a
few other councillors neighborhoods, it is critical that
the city push and if need be paid to take down the wires.
Uh, I've worked with the MBTA on three different projects,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

using the wires once and by after mid-March, is that

one for Cambridge and they are many years behind anything.
They-- they probably won't even give you a date
anymore, uh, on when they're going to be able to do things
and if they're not using it and it's eliminating an option
96
Packet Pg. 563

3

for the road that you all want and we want, um, we have to
pursue that or I can't talk to my neighborhood people nor
can Councillor Toner and Councillor Nolan 'cause they know

Um, so my concern, I hope we're adding pedestrian
crossings up and down Mass Avenue because we are deficient
in them and I would be surprised that people aren't hit.
Um, I think Mass Avenue with these flex posts is gonna be
the ugliest main street around and I think that's a sin. So
here's my second-- my la-- second to last question.
My concern is, and I'm all for safety, we put up the
flex posts and we will not see upgrades beyond that for a
whole generation. I mean, why would you do that? The safety
factor is there, there are other issues in the city. We all
know it should be raised bikeways, we know that, but it
won't happen. And that's my concern, that's my biggest
concern about this right from the beginning. Right in front
of city hall it's ugly.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

this is possible.

Now, maybe that's part of the central square study
you're looking at. Further up Mass Avenue toward Harvard,
it's uglier. Um, and that's-- that's not what the main drag
should be. I propose Madam Mayor to suspend the rules to
97
Packet Pg. 564

3

bring forward communications number one from Steven Kaiser.
And I don't know if the city folks have had a chance to
read this analysis and he makes reference to areas that-So we'll-- we'll suspend the

rules, Councillor. Sorry.
COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go back to you,

Councillor Carlone and then I have Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Yes. I'm almost stunned,

communications, but very few have as much information in
them as this does, uh, because of Mr. Kaiser's background.
And-- and Mr. Barr, I know you know Steven and, uh, there
are some recommendations there about mitigation, uh, about
reducing parking over time.
Um, and I think he's right on the money and I hope the
public reads this and pressures the city to do things, um,
in the right way. And we all want the same thing in the
long run. I just think, um, our focus hasn't ha-- has not
been necessarily on doing it permanently, but doing it as
fast as we can. I get that, but there needs to be some sort
of commitment that our main drag be done in a beautiful
way, a handsome way.
Um, and, uh, last thing I'll say is if we talk about

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Madam Mayor. But this is important. Um, we get many

where housing can be in this city, this is the area and
having flex posts up and down the street is not necessarily
a positive element for investment. So thank you, Madam
Mayor, and thank you for your patience. Please, everyone

reads-- reads Steven's-- Steven Kaiser's, uh,
recommendations. You might not agree with everything, but
there's many things that I know Mr. Barr knows that are in

city before we do these projects. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I
will be voting for both policy orders.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Thank you so many of my colleagues and most
recently Councillor Carlone for pointing out and reminding
us of this very extensive communication. Um, I-- I do
support these. I-- first I'll talk about, uh, City Manager
Item 11.
This is an important step for us forward to actually
use some funds to-- to continue to implement the cycling
safety ordinance in a way that it enhances what has been
done up till now. And I think that's, um, a testament to
the huge deluge of, uh, of response we got. And I'm-- and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that, and that's the kind of document we should have as a

I'm glad that the-- the city manager and the city has-- has
come up with this and-- and also laid out what it is.
I will say I got the cycling safety ordinance in the
mail. It's great. I hope we do more of it. And it would've
100
Packet Pg. 567

3

been nice and in retrospect, again, thinking forward to
have gotten it a year ago for anybody in the affected area
with not just, hey, changes are coming, but here's the

learned that lesson. I look forward to that kind of
communications being done more extensively, more
proactively so that we can all hopefully get to a point.
Right now, I think we've been miscommunicating
misinformation, you know, people who say, oh my gosh, I'm
really concerned about this, are characterized as not
wanting a bike lane. And then people who say, oh my gosh,
we need to do it better, are accused of not caring about
cyclist safety.
So let's hope the more that we as a city can
communicate that. And I'm-- I was glad to see that in this
appropriation. Um, I will say on the comprehensive analysis
of business and economic impacts, it's critically important
to get the data and to actually talk to the people. We also

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

changes we're thinking about as soon as we can. We've

understand, and through you, Mayor Siddiqui, to the city, I
assume this means we will be nuanced in our approach
because the businesses in Harvard Square-- I've run a
couple small businesses, by the way, if you all didn't
101
Packet Pg. 568

3

know.
So I'm pretty aware of the tension of running a small
business when you are literal, whether you can make your

the last to get paid. So I-- a shout out to every single
small business person in the city. But, you know, Harvard
Square businesses have a totally different market and a
totally different people coming to them than upper Mass Ave
and even than Inman Street that the characteristics of
those are different, partly because of the parking, partly
because of the-- the density, partly because of whether the
transit stop is there.
So I assume that this study will take that into
account, um, and some people have said, well, how can you
do it? Because all these businesses are in trouble because
of the pandemic. Totally true. But good analysis can take
into account at least the best we can. So I think through,
Mayor Siddiqui, just like assurance from that, that from

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

mortgage payment is depending on you as the top and you're

the city, those kinds-- that questions are part of how it
is that we're gonna be approaching this.
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, sure. Through Mayor Siddiqui, I

think, um, I guess two thoughts and I'm-- I'm not the
102
Packet Pg. 569

3

expert and we'll certainly be working very closely with the
economic development division and community development to- as well as the assessors and-- and other folks who have

Our hope is that we might also be able to get some
data from the state that would help us kind of be able to
have an objective source of data on performance and-- and
then we can to start to do comparisons, you know, different
locations which might allow us to sort of pull out some of
the COVID impacts. Um, but-- so the first thing is we-part of the reason we are seeking the appropriation, you
know, for a variety of things, but including that study is
we recognize that we need to hire, you know, a really good
consultant to help us with that because I don't think that
we-- we necessarily can pull together all the different
pieces and-- and do it as quickly as, um, people are asking
for.
Um, so we'll certainly be, you know, that-- that--

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

expertise in this area.

that's part of why the-- the appropriation was necessary.
Um, but I also think it's important to note that, you know,
a lot of this is looking back at the impact of projects
that have been implemented. It is challenging to sort of
103
Packet Pg. 570

3

try to make an estimate of what the impact of a new project
is going to be 'cause every situation is unique, but
hopefully from those sort of retrospective studies, we'll

inform, you know, projects as they move forward in the
future.
But again, I think really the key is working closely
with all the expertise that exists within city staff to
make sure that we've done this sort of multidisciplinary
look at this and-- and really try to characterize it and
the level of detail that I know tha-- that folks are
looking for.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Through you. Yes, I appreciate that. I understand
that and we are asking for it quickly. We need it-- we need
it quickly. You know, an example is the intercepts survey.
If you do it in Porter Square, you'll get totally different

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

be able to learn what we need to learn to be able to

answers of how people got there than literally half a mile
north on Mass Ave.
So let's make sure we don't confuse that. And
certainly, some of the studies we've been shown about the
104
Packet Pg. 571

3

impact of bike lanes hasn't had as much of an impact on
business. We're able to find comparable, um, areas of
business to really do it, I think based on like city-- city

germane to-- to who Cambridge is and where we are.
So I-- I look forward to that. On the cost
implementation, I-- I-- we were asked what's what's the
overall project. I-- I think we should move forward no
matter what it costs. I mean, it-- it's not gonna be
something that is-- is not something we can afford and-and we're all committed to doing that. I recognize that
what would be interesting is that sometimes when you do
something temporarily, then you have to take it away.
So it's money that then is only temporary as opposed
to if I'm doing a temporary quick bill that then I can use
that in the future. So I think it might be important as we
get those numbers to understand that 'cause sometimes it
might be better than to wait for the semi-permanent or the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

tax revenues. But again, it's really important that it be

permanent if it is that it's gonna be a very short term.
I'm not interested in just wasting money instead of being
able to use it for a better permanent solution, if that
makes sense, is a comment.
105
Packet Pg. 572

3

JOSEPH E. BARR:

Uh, yes, it does. Through you, Mayor

Siddiqui. I think, you know, we-- and-- and that's part of
the reason why we work very closely, you know, even on-- I

certainly on the quickbid projects with the Department of
Public works, because we wanna make sure that we
understand, you know, what's coming and not just city
projects, but private utility projects, um, and-- and not
put in, you know, a quick build project and then it turns
out that six months later, the gas company is gonna come in
and dig that up.
Obviously, in some cases, those kinds of things
happen, unfortunately. But again, we do try to coordinate
very closely with all of that work to make sure that we're
not as-- as-- as you noted, you know, sort of wasting money
or-- or putting things in and then having them come out
very quickly. Like I said, it doesn't always work out
perfectly, but we do try very hard to coordinate that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

shouldn't say even, but on all of our projects, but

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes, as someone who

lives right on here on Ave that saw the street right in
front of my house, ripped up five different times for five
106

3

different things. Let's put municipal broadband in a
geogrid right down in the middle when we tear down that
median, just saying.

- this particular area is much less safe than others. That
may actually be true, but the particular analysis provided
was, uh, not an analysis that makes any sense whatsoever.
If you have 5% of bikes going through that area, then you'd
expect 5% of the accident. So let-- I'm just putting out
there that the particular analysis suggesting that because
this is 0.25% of the miles in the city, you would only
expect 0.25% of the accidents, is not the way you would do
any kind of rational analysis of bike safety.
What you would do is say how many bikes are going
through there and what percentage of the bikes are going
through there and-- and is the percentage of bike's
accidents, which as relayed to us was, um, 2.5% was 23 out
of 900 accidents. Again, I'm not saying it might not be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, I will say the-- an analysis was raised about the-

more than usual, but we need to be very careful in our
statistics that we are using the right analysis and that
particular analysis is, uh, not one that anyone would
accept from a statistical perspective.
107
Packet Pg. 574

3

Um, a comment on the-- on the-- I guess that was on 11
on 12. Uh, let's do it right, let's do it best we can. I'm
disappointed. It would be great if we were in a position

worse to move forward faster because of a timeline that
doesn't get us to the place where we need to be and make it
the best we can be.
So-- so we-- we cannot say because of a few months,
especially, there are so many other examples, honestly,
where it's years and years delay. This is-- we've been a
few months, let's make sure we do it in a way that is safe
for the whole city. That includes bike safety, pedestrian
safety. For those of you who don't, I mean, we've gotten a
number of emails from people who are very clear, they're
residents, they are, uh, have challenges getting around,
someone whose wife is in a-- a wheelchair in a car.
I mean, this is a serious issue of not just making
sure that we either pay attention to small businesses or

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

where we could move forward faster and yet it would be much

the cyclists. It really is a range. It's a neighborhood.
It's so many different people for whom this is a critically
important part of how they see the city, of how they get
around the city, of how they feel welcome in the city. And108
Packet Pg. 575

3

- and-- and I really think for us to come together and
understand in order to do that, we do need to give the city
the time they need.

acknowledge that state it care-- state it kind of strongly
and say that we fully support doing this right.
Understanding that we are gonna continue to pressure to get
it done as soon as we can. Um, so thank you, uh, Mayor
Siddiqui. Uh, I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any new councillor who wants

to speak before I go back to councillor Toner and
councillor Azeem? I don't see Councillor Simmons. I'll-I'll briefly just say for number 11, I'm supportive of the
preparation. I'm glad to see the comprehensive, um,
analysis of the business and economic impacts included as
part of the funding.
And I think the community and city council have been
very clear that, uh, with more and better outreach, um,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Uh,

through you to the director and the city manager. Just a
couple of last comments is, um, not asking for it now, but

think there needs to be an explanation or real rationale on
why Porter Square is being done separate from the rest of
Mass Ave 'cause I get that question a lot as well, um, just
clearly state, you know, is is it because of data showing
that it's more dangerous than other parts, et cetera?
But a real rationale on why it's being taken out of,
uh, the middle of Mass Ave and being done, uh, separately.
Um, the reason I ask for data and, you know, I-- I don't
want to get into an argument, but you know, I want data
from the city, not from someone who's advocating one
position or another.
So I just want to make sure I'm getting the-- the
clear story on that. And then one last thing is, this has
got nothing to do with you, but uh, again, in some of the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

as we go forward with the discussion on Porter Square, I

advocacy, people keep saying there's plenty of parking in
Porter Square and they seem to think that the Star market,
Porter Square parking lot is open season parking. Um, they
should know that every time they park there, they're
110
Packet Pg. 577

3

risking being towed or getting a ticket. Um, so I-- I just
wanna make state that for the record for the people who've
been, uh, writing that to us. Thank you. I yield, Madam

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Councillor Azeem.
Um, I had one question and

one comment. Uh, one question just because, um, there was
some confusion about this and uh, uh, other parts of Masa
Ave and the median. Um, is there a certainty that we can
remove the median if we so desired, or are there potential
complications if we try to remove the median?
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Through, uh, Madam Mayor and-- and

the DPW may wanna weigh in as well, but I think, you know,
the-- the-- the-- the biggest source of complexity in
Porter Square with the median is the bridge over the
commuter rail tracks, which is owned by Mascot. Uh, we have
reached out to them to try to better understand what the-what it would look like and how complicated it would be to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor.

remove the median there.
Um, but I think because we don't own the-- the
structure and because it's a structure it's-- it's much
more complicated to do that. Um, and then, you know, beyond
111
Packet Pg. 578

3

that, I think there are already segments of the median that
were removed in Porter Square north of the Bayden
intersection prior. And so there are parts that already

Um, I-- I-- I don't wanna speak for DPW, but I think,
you know, it's-- it-- it's-- other than the bridge, it's
sort of the same level of complexity as the rest of-- of
the-- of the-- of Mass Ave. I guess-- sorry, Mayor
Siddiqui, just to go back to the question about data, I
just wanted to say for the councillors who brought it up
that there is a lot of data and analysis of crashes in the
bike plan that was updated in 2020.
So I understand the concerns about other data
analysis, but certainly that is one that I would-- or a set
of data analysis and crash data that I would certainly
point you to with-- with a high level of confidence.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Councillor Azeem.
Um, and-- and, um, I-- I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

spoke first and I wanted to like be supportive because like
I understand how difficult this is. Um, after hearing the
conversation, I did also wanna add like, like it's-- it's
important like, you know, city council is very thermostatic
112
Packet Pg. 579

3

sometimes, you know, uh, we've gone through the winter,
small businesses and COVID have really like amplified how
much businesses have felt the pain as well as residents of

Um, at the same time, I remember very vividly on
September 26th at 1:00 p.m. biking two blocks away from
Porter Square and the person in front of me getting hit
falling to the floor, not being able to get up and then
having an ambulance come and get them and me just stopping
and staring for 15 minutes as this was happening.
Um, I support this delay because I understand like it
needs to be done, but also, like I imagine how difficult
and different this conversation is going to be if we have
an accident this summer in Porter Square and god forbid
someone dies. Uh, we'll look at this moment very
differently. So I think that, you know, I support this
delay, but we should be very cautious and be, uh, as
responsible as we can to get safely improvements to this

section of Porter Square.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Excuse me, Madam

Mayor, I just wanna say I agree a hundred percent that we
take this very seriously. We do not want to break an
113
Packet Pg. 580

3

ordinance. There's all kinds of reasons why we don't.
Safety is certainly the top priority. It's just that we
can't make this, and I-- that's why I really think it's

number 12, uh, because I think this is an unusual uncharted
water breaking an ordinance. I take it very serious.
But I do think hopefully we all understand when-we're trying to do the best we can in-- in a very difficult
situation, but it's in no way, shape or form the intent to
cause a delay that we just can't without having to have the
delay. So I appreciate those comments, but we are on the
same page when it comes to that. Trust me, we have real
concerns and that's why I'd like to see if we can get a
formal quote on the number 12. Hopefully we can do that,
Madam Mayor, if that's the right procedure with you and the
clerk.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, so before we do that, I

think, you know, I'll just echo and say I know the traffic

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

important that we get an approval on a roll call of this

and parking team's working really hard, um, to get this
right, um, and to get stakeholder feedback. And, you know,
I think I view this delay, um, as something that needs to
happen.
114
Packet Pg. 581

3

And I also know that you're committed to safe streets
and will really work hard to make sure this delay delays
not a long one for all the points that have been stated. I

vote as it's presented to us on the city manager agenda is
to place this agenda item on file. City Manager, are you
saying you'd like there to be some kind of late order to
vote-- vote that or for-- this is to the city-- City
Solicitor is voting in favor placing this agenda item on
file suffice?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Uh, our

recommendation was to do what was similar on 15, vote to
accept and approve. Uh, this was a little bit something
we've never done before, so when we put it on the agenda,
it got determined as placed on file. But that was not my
intent. But where-- we've never done anything like this.
Again, I apologize, but it was to get an approval of the
city council 'cause I do think if the city's recommending

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

guess what I want to clarify is two things. Um, I think the

to break an a city council ordinance, it's important that
we ask for council approval.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, um, I-- I didn't want to ask whether
the manager was, um, willing to make a commitment to put in
place, um, temporary protection or not. Because if so, I-I'm willing to-- to vote yes. If not, I-- I'll be voting
no.
JOSEPH E. BARR:

Um, through Mayor Siddiqui, I mean,

at this point, from what I know and,--and the concerns we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes.

have about the outreach, I think if we were to put in even
temporary devices, it would-- it would require making a lot
of the, you know, um, physical changes and potential
parking restrictions, which I don't-- at this point, we
116
Packet Pg. 583

3

don't even fully understand exactly what those consist of
'cause we've not had that engagement with the community.
So I-- I hear the concern and I certainly I would-- I

really think we can at this point given where we are in the
process. And, you know, I think the-- we-- we'd be having a
very similar impact to what we would if we did it with
permanent materials.
And I think, again, the-- the issues around outreach
and around sequencing the improvements and making sure that
we fully, you know, fleshed out and-- and talked to the
community about the, um, mitigation exist, whether we do it
with temporary devices or permanent devices. So I like-- as
I said earlier, I don't think it really solves for this
full set of issues that we're trying to address with the
additional time that we've-- we've-- we were looking at.
So, like I said, I-- I would love to be able to say yes,
but unfortunately, I don't think I can.

where there was some, um, some variety of views on the, um,
120
Packet Pg. 587

during the process between the focus groups and the, uh,
community meetings. Uh, but, uh, upon looking at the site
and its con-- conditions in the financing the size of the

home ownership, we will-- our recommendation is that this
would be, uh, home ownership.
Um, we will have further discussions with the
Affordable Housing Trust on the matter. Uh, but my
understanding is that they are also very much in favor of
home ownership on the site. So we expect that that is the-the direction that this would go. Um, in terms of emergency
access, um, certainly that would, uh, absolutely have to be
maintained. Um, I am not certain on about the tree
question. I believe, um, Melissa Peters is on the Zoom and
she may know more about that. So, um-MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I don't think Melissa's on.

ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER IRAM FAROOQ:

Oh, okay. I

apologize. So I will, um, Councillor, I will get back to

site and the preponderance of, um, um, of views in favor of

you on the question on the trees 'cause that is, uh, not a
level of detail that we have gotten to just yet. We expect
that that will certainly be, uh, something that once, um,
developer is selected, uh, that they will then be getting
121

into that level of detail. But I-- I don't believe that-that we got into that level of detail during the community
process.
Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. Madam

Mayor, through you, thanks for those answers. And-- and
then for the affordable home ownership, is it possible to
have some sort of, uh, preference for first genera-generation home buyers so that we can also, uh, attempt to
do some-- some racial justice and make up for the antiblack housing discrimination that has been going on for
generations in our country?
ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER IRAM FAROOQ:

Um, through you,

Mayor Siddiqui, um, you know, counselor during, um, any
kind of homeowner, um, any kind of housing-- affordable
housing project, we have to be really careful to-- to make
sure that we are following fair housing laws. Uh, but
within those constraints, uh, we absolutely are, um, are

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

happy to work with the council and the trust on thinking
through if there are-- are particular groups that, um,
ought to be prioritized.
Um, so during the process, there was certainly, uh,
122
Packet Pg. 589

3

folks who cited a preference for, uh, allowing a way to
prioritize Cambridge-- existing Cambridge residents. Um,
but we know that council has certainly discussed, um, also

American born blacks of how home-- home ownership ties into
reparations.
And so all of those questions we are happy to have
further discussion on-- on those in terms of how
prioritization might work. These are not, um, items that
are, uh, or preferences that are, um, coded aside from, uh,
Cambridge residents into our current preference system. Um,
but certainly around the project we could have that
discussion.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan and then

Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

CCD.
As you can see in the documents that were provided,
this is-- this-- excuse me, property and this discussion
has-- has been going on for a very long time. Uh, I wanna
acknowledge and just-- just provide a little bit of
historical context. Uh, people that have now-- that have
worked on this several years ago that have now retired,
like Elaine Thorn that actually went into the community and
had community meetings and rendered-- and there was a
rendering, which you could probably still find, and it was
about home ownership and it was, um, I think it was about
six units and it-- we did talk about trying to focus it on,
um, residents of the Port.
Was told then, as we're being told now, that because

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

want to acknowledge the work of Ms. Farooq and her team at

of the way the funding is, how federal and state money can
and cannot be used. But the idea was then and still is now,
is how do we provide affordable stability, uh, in the port
neighborhood in particular. So I'm just really pleased to
124
Packet Pg. 591

3

see this. Uh, it, it does make me think of Renee Gray who
came and testified before the city council on a number of
vacations as to why and when the property would be

pleased to see this.
Um, I know the neighborhood would be very pleased that
this is going to hopefully move forward, uh, that they will
be able to, in not too long a time, see, uh, homes there
and families there, and children there being able to be in
the neighborhood, uh, particularly if those units are
family size units, you know, three-bedroom units at a
minimum.
So, uh, again, I'm just pleased to see this here. I
would, uh, particularly, uh, acknowledge and thank City
Manager for this recommendation today, put on the agenda.
Um, and I look forward to seeing the outcome of this vote,
uh, in real life. I yield the floor.

Uh, thank you, Madam

the community development meeting on this site, the first
meeting, and I was very impressed with the whole nature of
125

3

the way it was presented. Um, the planners understood that
in on this site, you cannot go super tall and they do want
it to fit in.

the councillors have brought up, but also individual
entries. And it was about as positive and open a discussion
as I've heard in the city related to new housing and, um,
that should be mentioned. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Great. Thank you. Um, I'll

just add, I'm really happy to see this on the agenda when
there's been a lot of history here. And I think when, um,
we submitted a policy order in the fall of '22 and
Councillor Simmons lead sponsored that order and I cosponsored.
Um, you know, the request was for a thorough public
process and true cu-- community engagement, um, to, uh,
ensure the best usage. And so I'm really excited vote on
this and to see this move forward. I wanna thank the City

Item Number 15, a communication transmitted from Louis

surveillance technology or surveillance data. This was
pulled by Councillor Azeem. Councillor Azeem?
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, this was wonderful. I

really appreciated it. Um, it's quite a hefty packet, so I
wanted to make a motion to forward this to the Public
Safety Committee for further discussion.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I see co-- before we do that,

we can have discussion. Councillor Zondervan?
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN: Thank you, Madam
Mayor. Through you, uh, to my colleague. I would be happy
to, uh, hold the hearing in public safety. That's, uh, what

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

we usually do when we receive these reports.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any other questions, comments

on this? Councillor Toner?
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Is-- is this just a report
131
Packet Pg. 598

3

at this time? Or is--are there-- is there any action being
asked us to take or is it just a report on these various
surveillances?
It's-- it pertains to our

ordinance. Um, City Solicitor?
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Thank you. Through you,

Madam Mayor. I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Uh, yes. As I read it, it

was-- I-- I knew it was in relation to an ordinance, uh,
uh, three-- sorry. Through you, Madam. But, uh, I knew it
was in relation to ordinance, but this is just a listing of
all the various surveillance software that is used in the
city by the school department and the city. Is that
correct? And-- and is there any action being asked for us
to take?
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor, the ordinance is a fairly lengthy ordinance, which
has a lot of requirements for the city administration to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

adhere to with respect to, um, looking into any technology
that might constitute, uh, surveillance, um, equipment and
to present such, uh, surveillance equipment to the city
council for review and approval.
132
Packet Pg. 599

3

There are certain, um, pieces of equipment under the
ordinance that are exempt and certain other things that I
believe that the ordinance says you can't use in any event.

council to review and approve. In addition, the ordinance
requires an annual report to be submitted by the City
Manager to the city council outlining surveillance, uh,
equipment that is used by the city and various departments.
So this is the annual report and it lists, um,
surveillance, uh, technology reports by each department as
to each item that has either been pre-- previously reviewed
and approved by the city council to be used by those
departments. And I think it's possible that in this annual
report, there may be some new technologies that are being
submitted to the council for review and potential approval
as well. And, uh, this is a fairly new ordinance. This is,
I believe, only the second year that this annual report has
been submitted.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

But there are a number of things that it's up to the

Possibly the third, but I think the second and, um,
the-- the last time or the last two times when such an
annual report was submitted, it was referred by the council
to a committee for more in-depth discussion. And that's
133
Packet Pg. 600

3

obviously the will of the council as to whether to do that
or not. But there is information on each of the
technologies laid out in this fairly detailed comprehensive

they're reporting on.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you. And through you

Madam Mayor, the only reason I asked was we were getting
emails asking us not to approve the purchase of certain
technologies. And I didn't see that request in here
anywhere, so thank you. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So we, um, what's here as, um,

listed is to vote to accept and approve, but past practice
has been to discuss further, um, in public safety and the
motion that Councillor Azeem presented as to do that. So I
think we've-- I've heard from most people on it. Um, go
ahead, Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I just wanted to briefly respond to my colleague

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

report from each of the departments with the technologies

and-- and also confirm with the City Manager. And in the
past, if there were a new technologies that needed to be
approved, those would be submitted separately as, um,
surveillance technology impact reports. Um, these reports
134
Packet Pg. 601

3

that are before, as I believe, are only the annual reports.
So they're not requesting approval for new technology
use under the ordinance. The council can at-- at any time

that are in use. And so the-- the purpose of discussing,
uh, these annual reports and committee is to make sure that
the council still wishes to continue approving, uh, the use
of those technologies as-- as allowed under the ordinance.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan, I think

that's-- that is correct. City Solicitor.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. I

believe that, uh, Councillor Zondervan is correct and I
believe-- I stand corrected. I thought that there were-that there was possibly some reference to some new
technologies that, uh, some departments maybe were
indicating would be the subject of surveillance technology
impact reports. Um, but they may not have been included in
this report, so I may be jumping the gun a little bit and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

withdraw its approval or any, uh, surveillance technologies

I'm-- I'm sure that he's, uh, correct in what he just
stated. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So I don't see any other

is requested to report back to the city council on the
findings of the future of Telework Committee and to explain
the city's current policy regarding a work remote work
policy on the Weekly Digest this Friday, March 11th.
And further be ordered that the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to submit a full report with
recommendations to the full City council at the next
regularly scheduled city council meeting Monday, March
21st. So just to, um, start us off, during the January 24th
city council meeting, I asked a question during that
meeting for an update on recommendations from the future of
Telework Committee.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. Through you, I submitted a late policy order this

The council was told that Judas Stu Staffing
shortages, the results of the survey had been delayed, but
the city manager's office had hoped to have this
information and a permanent remote work policy available by
138
Packet Pg. 605

3

the end of February. The current remote work policy has
been extended to March 11th, 2022 for city employees who
can-- can complete their tasks from home in an effort to

When I asked if the recommendations in the new policy
was expected prior to the March 11th date, Mr. Manager, you
said, that's one of the reasons why we've used March 11th.
And if it isn't ready, then we'll consider moving that
back. Mr. Gianetti then followed up and said, we're working
as quickly as possible to get the recommendations out to
the manager and allow him some sufficient time for whatever
further abetting process there is.
But we will have an update going out to employees
hopefully this week, updating them on the work that's been
done since December and the revised deadline. This Friday
is March 11th and there has no policy that has been
announced. Department heads got an email on Friday that
said full staff capacity will start on Monday, March 14th.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

reduce density in buildings.

And the only employees who are eligible for any remote
work are those who submitted paperworks last summer under
very narrow circumstances. For those of you who don't know,
the narrow circumstances are if you have COVID in our

quarantining, if your school or daycare is closed due to
COVID, if you are caring for a family member who's
quarantining or you are immunocompromised and have a

Other than number 4, those are not flexible work
schedules or work from home policy. But that's the only
thing that's been in place since the full return to work in
June, 2021. And starting Monday it's the only policy that
will be in place. Our employees have been waiting a long
time for this policy and deserve to know the timeline and
that there will be no more delays.
We know that we have lost staff and we have had
difficulty attracting top talent because of our lack of a
formalized work policy. We've done an extensive amount of
employee engagement over the last month around the City
Manager search and the lack of a remote work policy has
come up time and time again amongst our employees as one of
their top issues.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

doctor's note.

So I know that you and I had some email exchanges that
last week around the timeline that I don't think was
necessarily reflected in the email that went out to the
department heads. So I just wanted to bring this forward
140
Packet Pg. 607

3

tonight, um, while you were still here so that you could
provide a status of the recommendations and when they will
be coming forward,
Uh, to you, Madam

Mayor. So again, I think there's a misunderstanding on the
email we sent out, and I'm gonna turn it over to Lee at
some point. But about six weeks ago as COVID uptick, we
agreed to have a 50% capacity in our buildings. That was a
six-week thing that we were gonna move to 75% and then
100%. But as things have changed and we've removed that
six-week window of terms of how many people should be in
the office.
So that was really not a-- a big change. That was
something that we instituted about six weeks ago as I felt
with the numbers going up, we had a little bit of a blip
that it was the time to go. This is really the role of the
City Manager and I appreciate the council's concern. I've
had a team working on this nonstop. They're meeting two

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

days a week, I'm not gonna rush this. And I appreciate the
concern of the council, appreciate the concern of the
employees.
This is uncharted waters for the city and I respect
141
Packet Pg. 608

3

the fact that we wanna let our employees when they can work
from home. But I also respect the fact that the taxpayers
pay our salaries and I'm not gonna put something in place

come up with a compromise here, but there is issues about
accountability, how we're gonna have this monitored, how
we're gonna control it.
We're getting close and I really want to commend the
eight real members who've been working hard on this. I
personally have not seen any area where we have lost a
department head or at a high-level position in a recruiting
matter over the fact of our COVID, uh, flex time schedule.
As a matter of fact, I would say we have one of the most
generous schedules during COVID of any city in the state,
and we continue to have that. And if you look, most cities
do not have the COVID items that we already have in place.
So we wanna do something about Telework.
Mr. Gianetti, I think has done a phenomenal job, but

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that I'm not comfortable with. And we are working hard to

I'm not gonna rush the committee 'cause the council's
saying they want an update. I can give you an update of
where we're at, but it's not gonna be a final proposal. And
I appreciate the employee's concerns about this, but I

would hope that the council will respect my opinion that I
have a job to do here when it comes to accountability of
the city and my-- my employees. And that's the way I look

follow, but I'll let Lee be happy to give you an update of
where we are.
LEE GEANETTI:

Uh, through you Madam Mayor, uh, to

Vice Mayor Mallon, um, I-- I do appreciate and I want to
acknowledge that I hear, uh, your frustration and I also
want to acknowledge that I recognize and the committee
recognizes how our employees are really thinking about
Telework. Before I give an update, I do want to clarify one
thing.
There-- there are two processes here. There's the
remote work policy due to COVID-19, which has been in place
since the beginning of the pandemic. That is one pathway.
We are working on something completely different. The
future of Telework is really looking at how we put a set of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

at this and I think it's an important line that we gotta

recommendations to the City Manager that would create a
hybrid work environment. It-- it's not related to the
current policy, um, that we have. The committee's been
working, um, through a draft policy that we have. Um, we've
143
Packet Pg. 610

3

been doing that since uh, January.
We're meeting a couple times a week. We are having
robust conversations about it. It's not an easy process to

that each of the members bring. They're very different. Um,
and I also want to really acknowledge the City Manager for
allowing us the space to be able to have the conversation.
Do I wish that it could go faster?
Of course, but we're also trying to do this right
because this is a policy that's gonna reimagine the entire
workforce. Um, it's something that impacts people that are
going to want to take advantage of Telework, but it equally
impacts the people that are back in the office. This is,
you know, really reimagining how our teams work. So we want
to get it right. Um, we do hear people's frustrations that
they've been waiting a while, but it's more important for
us to make sure that we get this right.
Um, one point that you brought up in terms of an

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

go through. Um, I appreciate the input, the perspectives

update to employees, um, I-- I do acknowledge that and I
will take full, um, responsibility for that. Part of the
challenge related to it is I'm not quite sure at this point
what we want to be saying because we don't wanna set false
144
Packet Pg. 611

3

expectations with people in terms of what may be in a
policy, what's not in a policy.
Um, the city managers see nothing that we've been

talk to, whether it's IT learning and development. We've
been very, very careful about waiting until we have a
complete policy before we start sharing that. But we have
multiple pathways that are currently, um, underway. So
that's where we are. We met today. Um, we're meeting again
tomorrow and we are working through as, um, quickly as we
can. And we want to be as thorough as we can in putting
forward a set of recommendations.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I'm gonna go to the Vice Mayor

and then I have Councillor Zondervan and then Councillor
McGovern.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, just respectfully I'm looking at my list of
work from home policies from municipalities from across the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

working on yet, um, as we've brought in other people to

state and I stopped pa-- I stopped writing them down. We've
got Brookline, Brockton, Hadley, Lexington, Needham,
Southbridge, Lowell Wakefield, Bedford, everyone has had a
policy. The-- I stopped paying attention in July.
145
Packet Pg. 612

3

I stopped keeping this list in July of 2021. So-- and
I-- I hear that you're saying that department heads haven't
left and you haven't heard that top candidates have not

- I-- I wanna be really sensitive here. I understand that
this is the purview of the City Manager.
However, our employees are our biggest piece of ins-infrastructure in this city and making sure that we are
valuing them, we're hearing them and we are communicating
with them about a policy that we said would be ready in
January. We said it would be ready in February. We said it
would be ready by March 11th, and here it is.
So I wanna be really clear that we are expecting this
policy. The city council is standing behind the employees
who want this policy in place and want to be-- to have a
remote work policy to bring the city of Cambridge up with
all of these other communities that-- that helped them. So
I'm gonna yield to my colleagues right now, but I did not

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

taken the job. That's-- that's not what I'm hearing. And I-

hear in Mr. Ginetti's answer or yours when we might he-when-- what is the timeline for getting this done.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor, I have to say something here. When it comes to
146
Packet Pg. 613

3

respective employees, my reputation I would put against
anybody. I've made the employees in the city a priority of
my whole career. So because we don't have this in place,

comment. We are working on doing something.
This is not traditionally way the government works. We
are committed to doing something, but it's not from lack of
respect on knowing what our employees were. I have stated
more than anybody the effort of our employees, especially
during COVID, how much it's been appreciated. So the
employees don't need the city council to come to their
rescue here. This is my job.
I understand it's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do
it right, and I will come up with a timetable. And when
that timetable is ready, I will announce it. So appreciate
the council's concern. I wanna be respectful to the
council, but I think the council should be respectful for
me. And I think my reputation of trying to be fair to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

it's unfair for the Vice Mayor to make that kind of

employees is something that I've strived my whole career
on. And I don't appreciate it being challenged because
we've not put in this recommendation.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So I'm gonna go to Councillor
147
Packet Pg. 614

3

Zondervan and then I'm gonna go to Councillor McGovern. I
think I wanna jump in before that happens just to say that,
you know, this-- this item, I understand the complexity and

Committee.
I think what I'm hearing and what I've seen, and I
think we have employees who-- who do come to us. So there's
that delicate bonds, right? So we are hearing, you know,
shifting timelines. So there's this desire for more
information and why things, um, you know, are why they're
shifting timelines. And I think I understand that there's a
complexity to it and there's these two different things.
And I think because the timelines have shifted,
understanding why they've shifted.
And I think the-- really, their quest is to get as
much information as possible to date and then what needs
more to happen. I think we wanna-- we wanna get an answer
to this. I know it'll take time, but I think part of it,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I wanna appreciate the work of the future of Telework

what you're hearing and what I think folks are coming to,
the Vice Mayor and others about is the shifting timelines.
And so I think there's this-- there's this balance. And so
I don't-- I'm-- I I think the respect issue, that issue, I
148
Packet Pg. 615

3

think, you know, that's not something I wanna get into
here.
I think it's really about the right information and

shifting timelines because that is, I think when you shift
a timeline and there's not that much information as to why,
you know, people will get bothered by that. So I'll go to
Councillor Zondervan and then I'm gonna go to Councillor
McGovern.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, um, I-- I appreciate the major concern
and I do support, uh, this-- this order. And I-- I'm
wondering if-- I mean, it sounds like there might be a
little bit of a misunderstanding here because I think
what's-- what may be colliding here is the COVID pandemic
and the need for employees to have some, um, certainty
about what's going to happen next as we come out of, uh,
some of the COVID protocols and a desire to establish a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

when we can have it in a-- in a matter that explains its

more longer term policy that presumably would, um, outlive
the-- the COVID pandemic itself.
So I don't know if the managers is willing to speak to
that, but you know, is-- is there a way to give some more
149
Packet Pg. 616

3

clarity, a certainty on what's going to happen in terms of,
uh, flexibility as we transition out of COVID separately
from this more longer term conversation that's-- that's

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DESPAQUALE:

Uh, through you

Madam Mayor, I agree a 100% and that's what we're trying to
figure out. There's a COVID policy here that we've
continued to extend and then there's-- as Lee said, a
telework policy and we're trying to make them both come
together, uh, in determining the timing. It's tricky, but
they are two separate things and I think we're trying to
honor our COVID commitment.
Like I said, I think our commitment around COVID and
flexibility has been second to none. And, uh, we are
working on changing our work from home policy that we have
never had in the history of the city. And I am not rushing
that type of a policy. There has to be accountability. If
people are working from home, I am responsible as city

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

ongoing?

manager to make sure we have something in place that is
accountable.
And when there is an issue that comes up and we find
someone isn't because we rush something, that's not on the
150
Packet Pg. 617

3

city council, that's on me or the next city manager. So as
much as I appreciate the council's concern, as much I
appreciate the employee's concern, City Manager is

for the city, no one else. And I will make sure that I have
in place accountability when I put this in place.
So if-- if-- if we are asked what is going on with
people working from home, we can say it and we're proud of
it and we know why we're doing it. And until that is in
place, I'm not putting it forward. And I-- and we're
getting closer, but I just-- I-- I-- I have to feel that
way. I'm sorry.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, and, uh, through you, to the manager. I-- I-- I
appreciate that. I-- I think the-- the concern is really
about how we come out of the-- the pandemic and I-- I think
it can be, uh, a lot more relief if people have some

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

responsible for the accountability of the people who work

clarity about that, uh, sooner rather than waiting for this
more longer-term policy that is obviously taking longer.
And-- and I-- I don't have anything to say about that, but- but in terms of as we come out of COVID, I think there is
151
Packet Pg. 618

3

a need to provide some clarity in the near term as to how
we're planning to come out of that and, and planning to
give people the flexibility that they-- that they will

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. Um, so I-- I totally get that it's complicated
because we're-- this is about doing something that we
haven't done before. Um, but it is also true that many
other municipalities made that switch.
I'm sure they weren't all doing it and at some point
they made the switch to Telework from doing it all in
person too, right? So we know it's possible and we know we
have a lot of examples out there to follow. Um, regarding
the accountability piece, I-- I-- I-- I,--I appreciate
that. I would assume that our department heads are
monitoring workloads of their employees and making sure
that their assignments or the things that they're supposed

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

need, um, as-- as we adjust. So, uh, thank you Madam Mayor.

to do are getting-- are getting done.
So I-- I would assume that they would continue to do
that and, um, get-- evaluate employees if they're working
from home to make sure things are getting done. So I-- I
152
Packet Pg. 619

3

don't think that's-- I think we're seeing more and more
companies and municipalities moving to some sort of
telework, you know, it-- it-- so we're not-- we're not

And so I would-- I-- I hope that, um, with all the
complexities involved, I-- I-- I hope we get it settled
soon because it-- it does sound like it's causing stress
for people. Um, I appreciate the Vice Mayor for being on
top of this. Um, you know, and-- and clearly the, you know,
in-- in the bigger picture, and-- and I feel like, you
know, we-- we talk about this a lot, um, you know,
sometimes these lines get blurred in the public, right?
And so, certainly speaking for myself, but I-- I think
my colleagues would agree, one of the worst feelings as a
councillor, where you're the person who people have elected
to serve them, who come to you and say, what's going on
with X? And you have to say, oh, well, I don't know. That's
for the City Manager, I have no idea.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

breaking new ground here.

And then people sort of hold us accountable for that,
whether they should or they shouldn't do because we are the
ones who they voted to represent them. So as, you know, you
cannot provide us with too much information about these
153
Packet Pg. 620

3

things so that we have a response to people when they ask.
I-- I can't-- I hate responding.
Well, that's for the City Manager, I have nothing to

please, you know, if this is not gonna get done soon,
please provide us with an information as to why. Um, I'd
like to know, you know, given a, you know, I didn't look up
at the other cities that have this, um, the Vice Mayor did,
given that so many cities do. Are we reaching out to those
cities? What are we doing to move this along, right?
It's-- I don't-- I think sometimes people feel like
things go into a black hole and there are these meetings
and nobody knows what they're meeting and nobody knows what
they're doing and then it takes time and time and time, and
then that void gets filled with rumors and innuendo and
people don't care and they feel badly about it 'cause they
feel like nobody's paying attention to-- to what they're
concerned about. So, um, you know, I am gonna support, you

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

do with it. And then get that look, right? And so, um,

know, the order because I-- again, I think even if what
comes back from the report is here's what we're doing and
here's what we're done.
I think that in and of itself is gonna be extremely
154
Packet Pg. 621

3

helpful. But, um, but this is not, you know, this isn't new
stuff, right? People are doing this all over the place.
And, um, there's ways to hold people accountable, and I

um, sometimes you don't have to dot every I and cross every
T.
There will be things that we'll have to adjust as we
go, because we're doing something new. So let's get it
done, let's get moving and we'll adjust as necessary. But,
um, hopefully we will see this very soon. I think-- I think
folks deserve, uh, to know what's going on. Thank you,
Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Councillor Azeem.
Um, I wanted to say on the--

on this topic, like I-- I very strongly support Telework
and I have been disappointed by the shifting timelines. Um,
at the same time, I think that, you know, ci-- Cambridge
City government has 3,500 employees and, you know, uh, we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

assume that's what we trust the department heads to do. So,

all support changes and recommendations until the trash
doesn't get picked up or paychecks come a little late, or
reports don't come on time. And so I think this is an area
where I'm very strongly willing to defer to the City
155
Packet Pg. 622

3

Manager. And, uh, I don't think I could support this at
this time.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. You know,

this is-- it is challenging. It's a change. And especially
for people who've been in one place, in one city for a
long, long time with no changes, it's very, very
challenging. I mean, we have a, um, a personnel department.
We don't even have a human resources department. The title
is actually somewhat symptomatic.
We have-- we have proceeded with-- with practices in
place, with titles in place, with ways that we go forward
and it's really difficult to move. I-- I also hope that we
do move forward with a-- with a remote work policy. I do
know it's a-- it's probably a little bit scary. I mean,
there's cybersecurity, there's so many different issues
taken into account, and yet, as the Vice Mayor has noted,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Nolan.

you go on mass.gov and there's a telework policy already
developed for the entire executive office for the State of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Worcester appears to have a really well developed
156
Packet Pg. 623

3

telework. So I let-- let's build on that. Like, let's copy
them. Let's-- let's literally take from other entities and
do what we can to replicate them here. It's-- it's-- we're

little bit scary to think of accountability. So through
you, Mayor Siddiqui, to the City Manager, I-- I completely
understand that what we have to do is make sure there is
accountability.
The way you do that is you set goals, you set smart
goals, you do annual reviews. We don't do that very well in
this city either. I mean, there's a way to in-- to include
accountability in any system that we develop. So I-- I
support this if it's a means of pushing forward to get some
kind of report and make sure that we move forward on a
timely manner. I-- I don't wanna lose staff, but-- and I
also understand there may be staff for whom-- I don't want
us to all to go to remote.
I mean, I miss being here with all of you. So I-- I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

not that different. Um, I-- I also agree it-- it is a

don't think we should have everybody teleworking all the
time. And yet I do think for many employees, it's not only
the, um, best thing to do if their work can be done, and we
can include those, um, accountability measures. Um, and
157
Packet Pg. 624

3

also encourage people to be in-- in situ when they can. And
sometimes in order to develop relationships, which are key
to productivity, also in key to loving a city and key to

perspective, for some people, depending on where you're
commuting from, it's actually much better to do it from
home.
So I hope we can understand that this is a push for
us to really try to support workers here, uh, to support
what, um, the city manager's been working on and what the,
um, workforce is-- the taskforce is working and yet to-- to
continue. There's so many times when we're all frustrated
with timelines, so I'm happy to support this and have us
move forward if we can.

Vice Mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

And thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. So in terms of charter right, um, items
three through nine, as we know, in November, the voters
gave the city council the ability to vote up or down on any
City Manager or appointees on two boards and commissions.
Since November, we have not had a formal conversation
amongst this body, alongside the City Manager and his staff
to talk about what that means and any updates or processes
we would like to see.
So I exercised my charter right last week because each
week we seem to see more appointments and we've not yet had
that conversation. So I wanted to have time to speak with
my colleagues and the City Manager and his staff about
moving forward. So I did have the opportunity to do so, uh,
this past week, and we came up with some possible

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

solutions.
So I would be very happy to hold a government
operations committee hearing in the coming month or two, to
discuss the previous efforts, um, by the City Manager and
165
Packet Pg. 632

3

his team to div-- diversify our boards and commissions and
some recruitment efforts that he's made, as well as any
ideas that the council has to enhance those efforts so that

Um, the City Manager has agreed not to send any more
appointments to the council until we've had that meeting
together, um, whether we have one meeting or several
meetings and, you know, develop some new strategies on
recruitment and how the council would like to see
appointments presented in this book, uh, in the future.
So in terms of the appointments that we have in front
of us, my suggestion would be to place these appointments
on the table until we've had those conversations, whether
that's in government operations, I'm happy to hold it, or
if this body has-- thinks of another, uh, good place to
have that conversation. But that means that the new
appointments wouldn't be seated, but the-- the
reappointments would just serve in a holdover capacity. Um,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we see a diverse set of appointees moving forward.

probably many of these appointments have been serving in a
holdover capacity even up to now.
So I'm gonna make a motion to place items three
through nine on the table. And as I said, I'm happy to hold
166
Packet Pg. 633

3

this hearing should my colleagues say that this is the most
appropriate course of action, but I'm open to my colleagues
comments or suggestions on these-- this issue.
Vice Mayor has made a motion.

We can have a discussion. We'll go to Councillor Azeem and
then Councillor Toner.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Um, through you, Madam

Mayor, uh, to the Vice Mayor, I was wondering if you knew
if this would have any implications on the functioning of
the boards and their ability to vote on things
appropriately.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Vice Mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. When I spoke to the City Manager and his staff
this morning, uh, this afternoon, that did not come up.
However, like I said, most of these are reappointments and
those were just sort of in a holdover capacity. There's
only seven new appointments, uh, to boards.

Madam Mayor to the Vice Mayor, I-- I'm completely
supportive of having the-- the meeting to talk about how we
can all work together to recruit, uh, a more diverse, uh,

uh, new folks on these committees.
But I just wanna understand if we table this, the
people who are already on the committee will just continue,
and then the new people that were on the list that aren't
on there yet will go forward. Is that how you're presenting
it?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Vice Mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Um, through you, Madam

Mayor. So your first point is correct, though. Just hold
of-- serve in a holdover capacity. The new folks would not
be seated, and I should have said this at the beginning,
but the city council per the new rules, we get 60 days to
approve or not approve any appointments. So the idea would
be we would have these conversations within that 60 days.

And if we don't do it within 60 days, they will be
considered approved for those, uh, seven appointments and
those reappointments.
But I-- I wanna through you, Mayor Siddiqui, thank the
Vice Mayor for working on this, reaching out to the city
staff and coming up with. I think what's equitable and-and good solution for this-- this new process by which
we'll be appointing, uh, approving boards and commissions.
Thank you, Mayor Siddiqui. I yield.

all of which are curb cuts. What would be the proper way
for us to ensure that neighborhood association? It has to
be a proactive, we actually have to get a response either
yay or no. And-- and I say this because sometimes we hear
that in neighborhood association we get a report.
All three of these are no response has been received
by the neighborhood association. And it may be it got lost
in the email. I don't think there's a actual notice left
out. I know that if-- if there's a-- if my neighbor tries
to do something, I as in a butter will get a hard copy
mail. But in order-- I know that the city may try. But
would it be-- what process would it be by which we would
not be able to approve something unless it was a proactive

Mayor. Um, so in response to your question, Councillor
Nolan, so I-- in our office, prior to the items appearing
on the agenda on the city council agenda, um, the, there's

to, I believe, the community development, uh, website where
they maintain a list of-- of currently active, um,
neighborhood associations.
Those, uh, that account has either email addresses or- or physical addresses. And depending on what's available,
that organization at that location will get either an email
or a physical copy of the application mailed to them. Um, I
was actually just talking to this person, I think a couple
weeks ago, and the trend lately has been that the
organizations that we're sending these notices to are not
responding. So it's not that the city is not reaching out
to them, it's for whatever reason, we're not receiving
response back from the Neighborhood Associations.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

a-- we have a staff member at the clerk's office who goes

Thank you. Uh, through

you, Mayor Siddiqui, I-- I understand again, the city may
be trying to reach out. The question is, how can we put in
place basically that no curb cut even gets to us unless
173

3

there's been a response received? Even if it's just we
acknowledge that we received it and we are either yay or
no. Is that what-- what would it take for us to require

MAYOR SAMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Clerk?

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

I-- I wouldn't be prepared

to answer that tonight. Um, again, my understanding is that
when they're-- when they reach the stage where they're
about to go before the city council, at least like two or
three weeks, again, it may vary by a couple of days or a
couple of weeks. Um, we are sending something out to them
and then it's taking some, like, um, I don't mean to speak
colloquially, but, um, it's, um, if we-- if-- the sooner we
receive a response, the sooner we put it on the city
council agenda. If we-- after a period of time, and I don't
off the top of my head know what it is, if we don't receive
response, it'll go forward to the city council.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that?

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah, thank you. I--

I'm asking-- asking this probably because I know we are
considering not even having the council approve these, and
174
Packet Pg. 641

3

I'd be very hesitant to do it if it turns out this, even
the Neighborhood Association, you know, if we remove
ourselves from it within the Neighborhood Association never

I have definitely talked to some people who've been
concerned and been surprised by curb cuts in their
neighborhood or neighborhood association that again, they
were probably reached out to. I'm not questioning that, but
for whatever reason, it slipped through the cracks. Or the
one person who happened to be checking the Neighborhood
Association emailed that day didn't see it ad so the whole
neighborhood didn't know.
So I'm just trying to make sure that we have processes
in place to ensure that the kind of outreach and
communication and actually inclusive, um, uh, input from
the Neighborhood Associations could be had. So this sounds
like it's a further discussion. I'm happy to prove these
today, but I hope that we improve this process so that we

certainly there are sometimes the curb cuts are for large
buildings that, um, you know, can be delayed a little bit.
And they can-- even though that's costly to them, they can
sort of manage those costs.
But a lot of these curb cuts are the longer we delay
them, it impacts people's-- their plans to renovate. It
impacts things that they potentially, and I just wanna make
sure that we're, you know, not keeping things, dragging
things through the process too much that we're costing
people, um, you know, money, uh, and plans to, you know,

concerned about the big projects, but-- but more concerned
about the individual homes that are-- are planning this.

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Uh, I will-- I'm gonna go forward and vote for them- for these-- the curb cuts. But the two questions that one
has to really look at, whether it stays with the council or
goes to another process, there needs to be a better
process. And the port, there was a curb cut asked for, it
went to a Neighborhood Association that has not functioned
in 10 years.
And-- and so this, we have to be better at it, whether

it's the council that's doing it, and I hope we're gonna

COUNCILOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

most impacted people are the neighbors. And if a neighbor
is upset, I guarantee you the asoc--the Neighborhood

itself to talk to my colleague a little bit more about it,

So if she could through you, uh, explain, if my

Avenue? What's that area? Uh, that would be a first start
for me. I would really like an opportunity to talk with her
more about it and maybe work on this. But I-- I-- first,

order refers to segments of Memorial Drive East of Western
Ave. So that would be all of Memorial Drive, um, until
it's-- it's end in East Cambridge.
Um, and the-- the request is-- is for the manager and
DCR to consider expanding the-- the weekend road closures
to other segments of Memorial Drive further east, so that,
uh, more people can-- can access that, uh, open space

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we'd really like to know where East and Western Avenue--

during the weekends when parts Memorial Drive are closed
due to traffic.
COUNCILLOR DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor. Thank you. That's helpful. Um, I get the concept
184

and-- and generally in favor of it, but I don't know if I
can vote for it without having a little bit more
conversation around it. I don't-- if-- if there's a

it it'll have to go to a vote and I'll vote present on it.
I do-- I-- I do believe I get the idea in general.
Um, I just don't know if I favor blocking off Western
Avenue in its entirety, uh, at this point without having
further conversation about its impacts. So it's your order
and you'll do with it, which you may, but that's my-- my
feeling. But I would like to have a little bit more,
particularly from the Eastern part of, uh, the community
that this is going to affect.
That it's one thing to do it and everyone's happy,
happy, joy, joy. But what if they're not? Uh, so again,
I'm-- I'm just concerned we are doing it on the upper end
of Memorial Drive and one would say, well, you're doing it
this end of Memorial Drive. Won't we do it for all of it?

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

timeline or this has to be done right now, then I would--

And I just want us to be very cautious. So, um, I can't
support it right now the way it is. If you are willing to,
uh, take this back and we can have some conversation around
it, um, I'd be glad to sit and work with you on it, but I'm

go back to you.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDEVAN:

Western Ave, but we're-- we're discussing Memorial Drive,
not Western Drive.

misspoke. I do know. Understands Memorial Drive. Thank you.

people who wanna kind of share their opinion on it. So I'll

Memorial Drive. It specifically says the city manager work
on a pilot along any segments east of Western Ave with the
idea that there may be segments that are easier, that the
community wants-- uh, would be easier for the community,
186
Packet Pg. 653

3

would be, uh, more in sync with what the community wants.
And also, having talked with both DCR and the
Department of Transportation sometime in the last two

challenging because of the number of cross streets and
because of the number of closures that would be required.
And the idea was that wording was very specific in order to
give flexibility to consider what might make sense.
And certainly, I would expect this to be done only in
conjunction with the community as a whole. I do think it's
timely because one thing we're asking for, and we're going
on record for, is asking that the city manager established
the 2022 schedule for River Bend Park. Statutorily, it is
required to be closed on Sundays, but only starting the
last weekend in April. And this asks, let's accelerate that
and let's have-- let's ask the City Manager to work with
DCR to possibly close it as early as possible, including in
just a few weeks. And I think the earlier we get that word

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

years, some of the-- those segments make it more

out, it-- it can take some time.
I hope that we can pass this tonight and then work
with the City Manager if there's any concerns about what
segments East of Western Ave might go forward. But there
187
Packet Pg. 654

3

are different orders in here and I look forward to hearing
back from the City Manager. I hope we can expand this, uh,
to other Sundays and also to think about expanding it to

of course, that any decision to be made be done in
conjunction with the full community discussion.

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, if we've learned nothing from the bike lane in
conversation is involving the neighborhood and the
community at the outset is important. Um, and we also know
that if we don't put something directly into an order, it
does not mean that it's going to happen.
So, um, you know, I hear from a lot of folks in this
neighborhood, cause I live in this neighborhood about the
impact of closing Memorial Drive, which I voted for. Um, so
they ain't-- they're not too thrilled with me about that.
Um, but if we're gonna close off potentially large chunks

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Saturdays. But I think it is important we move forward and

or the rest of Memorial Drive, that is gonna have impact
into the neighborhood.

the two-- first two ordered sections to add after is

impacted neighborhoods. If we don't ask that they be at the

an impact on people and they should be at the table.

with DCR. So it should be comma and impacted neighborhoods
on both those orders, not the third order.
CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So again, tell me if this is

correct. And to reach out to impacted neighborhoods in the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

matter how righteous we think this is, this is gonna have

first order paragraph after the words DCR and in the second
ordered paragraph after words DCR And to reach out to
impacted neighborhood.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

I'm sorry, now that I'm

seeing it, um, obtain feedback from impacted neighborhoods.
We want-- we want to hear from them, not just reach out to
them and tell them that it's happening if it's happening.

CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Would you like to go to the

vote?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

I'm sorry. I'm having

tough-- difficulty with the hand raised option. Through you
to my colleague, uh, Councillor McGovern, uh, thank you for
adding that. It does make the order far more palatable for
me. Uh, it says-- it says, and to obtain feedback from
impacted neighborhoods, uh, that would help me vote for
this, except for. And I don't know how we put this in here.
It's one thing to say would impact. Who are the impacted
neighborhoods? 'cause someone might say that's the students

Thank you.

at MIT.
Um, I'm thinking for East Cambridge, I'm thinking for
the Port and Wellington Harrington as, um, I think you said
this, uh, Councillor McGovern or my co-- one of my
190
Packet Pg. 657

3

colleagues said there-- there are people that'll come out
and participate and have their views heard, and there's
others that will not. And we are not as-- we as a city, and

myself in this, are not as effective as we should be when
it comes to reaching out to people.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

So to-- to my

colleague, how do we strengthen that to--to say diverse
voices? Um, something that says a little bit more, because
if we're just going back to the list that, um, the city
has, we're not going to get those folks. I know very often,
and I'm going to use the, um, those races that we used to
have on Sundays.
And it wasn't until the interfaith community came to a
meeting and said, you are taking-- you close our parking
and you don't let us know about it. And this really impacts
people coming to our interfaith houses of worship. So how
do we strengthen that, reaching out to hear the voices of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I'm not pointing fingers at anyone in particular, I include

folks? Until such time, we are better at doing it through
a, um, a mechanism that we developed that says we will
enrich, um, our-- our outreach. Just recently, the Vice
Mayor, uh, during the city manager search, engaged people
191
Packet Pg. 658

3

through their own language.
And if you don't do that, what we find is that people
don't know, they don't hear, they don't respond. So again,

take it from anyone who could be mindful. I just cannot
come up with the words myself at this point to say, how do
we make sure that this order implies what we want? And that
is that you speak to all those?
People that you hear from typically and the ones that
we do not hear from, typically. How do we strengthen that
to say that so that whoever takes this up and works on it
understands explicitly that we are really asking them to do
some deep down reaching into the community?
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Go ahead, Councillor

Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, uh, to my colleagues, I-- I support

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

not to make this your burden, uh, Councillor, uh, I would

these amendments. I-- I would suggest, maybe to address
Councillor Simmons' suggestion that we say, to obtain
feedback from diverse communities within impacted
neighborhoods. I-- I do wonder whether we need all of that
192
Packet Pg. 659

3

in the first order, because that's asking for what we
normally do, which is to close Riverbed Park on Saturdays
and Sundays, with the only exception being that we start,

But obviously, that's-- that's coming up pretty fast.
So asking to do a large community process around that is-is gonna be very difficult. But, um, certainly on the-- on
the second order, I think it-- it's definitely helpful to-to add that.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

I'll just amend my

amendment. Take it-- take the amendment out of the first
ordered altogether, and then in the second ordered, add
diverse communities impacted. Think your feedback from
diverse communities with-- that's fine. Within impacted-MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

All right. So we'll take that

out. For the first ordered, we'll add what's before us.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

um, no later than April 2nd.

Anything else before we go ahead and vote on the amendment?

CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So the vote is to amend the

second ordered paragraph of the count drive number 15, uh,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We are on to the Charter Right

Item Number 16, that the City Manager is requested to amend
all existing host community agreements previously issued by
the city by reducing the impact fee to 0.05% of gross
revenue. And to refrain from placing this burden upon any
future HCAs that may yet be used to the charter right. Was
exercised by Councillor Zondervan. So I'll go to Councillor
Zondervan first, and then Councillor Simmons, the lead
sponsor.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. And I do have a substitute that I sent

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Paul F. Toner – Yes

to the clerk. And before we discuss or vote on it, I-- I
did wanna say to members in the public that, you know, just
because we have, um, charter rights and-- and substitute
amendments, doesn't mean that there's anything going wrong.
195
Packet Pg. 662

3

So we're-- we're making policy together and sometimes
that means drafting language together and sometimes it-- it
doesn't, but either way, it-- it is how our democracy

Um, so the substitute order attempts and-- and first before
I go into that, I do wanna, uh, say thank you to my
colleague for, uh, bringing this order forward because it-it is addressing an important issue and I'm glad that it
was brought before us.
Um, so what the substitute attempts to do is to
address the issue in-- in a way that ensures equity because
the-- the impact fees that we are discussing here are very,
very challenging. And we have not seen any real
justification in-- in this-- in the Commonwealth so far for
charging any impact fees. Um, we've seen several
communities, um, deciding not to charge impact fees. We've
seen some communities, um, being sued for improperly
charging these impact fees.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

functions and it-- it's not a sign of anything being wrong.

And so I believe the best approach here is to get a
sense from the manager first as to what the, any
anticipated impacts are that we legally could charge for.
And-- and the answer may be that there are none. Um, but if
196
Packet Pg. 663

3

there are any, we should know what they are and then have a
conversation about how to equitably distribute those costs
among the different, um, cannabis retail establishments.

It's also important to note that there is a-- a state
law that-- or-- or bill in the State House that is, uh,
seeking to address this issue. And I did have some
communication with, uh, Representative Rogers who lead
sponsored on that bill, and he indicated to me that it
seems to be moving forward and-- and it may well become the
law.
So I-- I think that's another reason to have a more
cautious approach here and, and not necessarily establish a
particular percentage amount for-- for this impact fee, but
rather to, um, not charge any impact fees and to first get
a study from the manager as to what the, uh, anticipated
impacts would be. So that's an-- an overview of-- of the
substitute that-- that I've put before you. Thank you,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So-- so that's in a nutshell what this order proposes.

Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Discussion. We'll go to

Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

I thank you, Madam

197
Packet Pg. 664

3

Mayor. So is the order before us?
MAYOR SAMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, the order is in front of

us.
Okay. So I-- 'cause I

thought we would have-- we would have to vote to bring it
before us, but I'm-- I'm sorry if I'm mis-- mistaken. So,
um, the order as I see it looks very similar to the order
that was brought forward by my-- myself, Councillor Azee,
McGovern, and Toner. And so what I would be respectfully
aske, because, um, I did not see this until 4:58 and I had
thought when the charter right was offered, it would give
us an opportunity, Councillor Zondervan and I to kind of
tease this out.
So I was a little taken aback when I saw it at 4:58
without having an opportunity to really have an opportunity
to speak to him because the order is 90% similar to the
order that was prior. And we could have probably redlined
that order. So in the spirit of collaboration, I like to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

just put this on the table so that we can have that
conversation, Con-- Councillor Zondervan. And-- and I-'cause I think we're rowing in the same direction. Uh,
that's number 1.
198
Packet Pg. 665

3

Number 2, the one thing that we don't wanna do, we
have spent such important time working on the legalization
of cannabis and how we can enfranchise ES and SEs. So we

what we don't wanna certainly do and may have happened here
is pit, uh, community of color, the black community in
particular, against themselves. Uh, we, you know, I always
talk about doing the right thing the wrong way.
So I, um, want-- I would do wish for some added
clarification, um, to remove any potential ambiguity that's
in this order. Uh, so what I would like to move is that we
lay this policy order, uh, and the the order that proceeded
it, which is the one that I offered with my colleagues at
the last meeting on the table to allow myself to
collegially work with my colleague at teasing out the
nuances, clearing up the ambiguity, and bringing forward to
the council an order that I hope that all nine of us can
unanimously get behind.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

are all in this together. I'm clear about that. Uh, but

So, po-- po-- thing to point

out. So if Councillor Zondervan-- I think I-- you can
correct me if I'm wrong, Councillor, if you-- if you
brought the order and you said, I wanna move to adopt it,
199
Packet Pg. 666

3

then that supersedes Councillor Simmons motion to put it on
the table. So I wanna get clarification on that.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

So, point of-- to you,

on the table because those orders are almost identical. Uh,
I was offering to put them both on the table in the spirit
of collaboration and have one order, not a substitute, but
an order that he and I, um, and I have maybe two other
people without bro-- the open meeting loss.
So my-- what my intention here, Madam Mayor, is to-is place Councillors Zondervan's order, which might be the
first order of business, is to take Councillor Zondervan's
order, uh, and place it on the table to-- to take that
vote. And then if-- take the order that I have submitted
with my colleagues, uh, Councillor Toner, Councillor Azeem,
and Councillor McGovern, if that is a good form to place
that on the table as well.
And then that would give myself and Councillor

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Madam Mayor, I'm trying to put Councillor Zondervan's order

Zondervan that rich opportunity of collaborating to bring
forward to the council which one order that we can all get
behind. And I think that this would be certainly a healing
moment because I-- we don't-- one of the things we
200
Packet Pg. 667

3

certainly don't wanna have is, um, disharmony and-- and the
community that we're trying to certainly help and assist.
So, uh, either through you, Madam Mayor, through the Clerk,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We're gonna go to the clerk

to, um, give a-- we've just talked. So go ahead, Clerk.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor, to the council. So Councillor Zondervan's, um, the
language that you see before you is not a-- an independent,
um, uh, uh, motion. It's-- it's a secondary motion to
Calender Item Number 15. And the motion is to amend that-that, uh, calendar item to replace it by substitution with
the language submitted by Councillor Zondervan.
So it is not the type of motion that you can
independently place on the table or refer or anything of
that nature. It has to be the motion to amend, has to be
voted up or down. And then any other motions on moving the,
um, the, um, the primary item around or-- or to make

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

if--

changes to the primary item. Things can happen after you've
disposed of this, uh, the motion.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Unless it's withdrawn.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

I can--

201
Packet Pg. 668

3

CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Unless it is withdrawn.

Correct.
Unless it's withdrawn.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Well, that's it. If

Councillor Zondervan would like to, uh, withdrawn it,
that's fine. Uh, what I'm-- again, just so I'm clear and
I'm just hel-- asking you to help guide me through this, is
placing this order that is being offered by way of
substitution, uh, on the table. So are you saying we need
to vote it up or down and then place it on the table? This
what are-- so let me--so Mr. Clerk, if you could help me
with that.
CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So this-- this motion does not

exist independently of Calendar Item Number 15. It is-COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Put it together?

Correct. And it is-- it

is-- it is-- it is a motion to amend and therefore, uh, a
motion to amend the underlying, uh, calendar item. And

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

therefore, the only actions that can be taken on the, uh,
motion to amend at this point are to vote it up, to vote it
down. Or the maker can ask the body to withdraw it if-- if
that is-- if that's is, you know, he's amenable to that.
202
Packet Pg. 669

3

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

So, just so I'm clear,

uh, Mr. Clerk, we could bring it forward to vote it up and
down, let's just say for the purpose of the discussion that

the table?
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Correct. So if-- so if--

if Councillor Zondervan's motion to amend passed, then
Calendar Number 15 would be amended and then the council
could move forward with, uh, any number of items placing on
the table, sending it to committee, adopting it, not
adopting it, uh, all the other various. Um-COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

So I would then

respectfully ask my colleague, one-- the other option
sounds like is he could withdraw. I-- we could take the
original order and put it on the table and then we could
come together and work on combining these two-- two orders.
So what I first-- if that is a correct way of, uh,
going forward, I would first ask my colleague if he would

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

it was to sustained, then we could then vote to place it on

be willing to take back his order so that we could do just
what I'm suggesting, which is to place the order that I
have put forward on the table. His order is still at his-in-- in his grasp and ability. And then I would make my
203
Packet Pg. 670

3

commitment to work with him to come forward with one order,
but I would have to.
It's his order and he has jurisdiction over it. So I

that we offered my colleagues and I at the last meeting to
play it on the table and then have-- this opportu-opportunity, he and I to work together on the two.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. Councillor Simmons, I

have to go to the-- I'm gonna go to Councillor Zondervan
and then Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Mm-hmm.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I would love to hear from my colleagues, but just to
express my, uh, intent or-- or preference, I-- I'm
certainly happy to work with Councillor Simmons on
finalizing this order and, you know, placing it on the
table is the way to do that, then I'm-- I'm fine with that.
But I would like us to vote on the substitute first

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

would respectfully ask him to withdraw it, place the order

and then we can put that on the table and-- and work on it,
uh, further. I'm also, of course happy to, uh, have our cosponsor or you can be the lead sponsor on-- on the final
product. Um, however we- we wish to proceed.
204
Packet Pg. 671

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Please repeat that.

Madam Mayor, through you to my colleague. What did he say
was that last sentence? He would be willing to do what? I'm

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan, can you

repeat what you said at the end?
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to my colleague. I-- I-- I would be
happy to have, uh, Councillor Simmons as a co-sponsor or
even lead sponsor on the, uh, final order that we-- that we
work out.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. Um, I would pre-- my preference would-- would
be in-- if this amendment was withdrawn for now and we
table and then bring it back. I think there's good things
in here, but this was dropped at 4:48 p.m. tonight. Um,
I've done a lot of work on cannabis for years.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

sorry.

I was not cons, you know, I didn't what was-- I was
one of the co-sponsors on Councillor Simmon's order. I
didn't-- wasn't involved in any of these amendments or
conversations about these amendments. I don't believe
205
Packet Pg. 672

3

Councillor Simmons was either. I think there's potentially
some good stuff in here. But if you're gonna force a vote,
'cause if we-- we have to either accept or not accept these

something that we haven't even had a chance to really look
at yet, I'm not gonna vote for it.
Even if it's-- even if there's some good stuff in
here. And I think that's a bad position to put people in.
So I think the-- the, uh, it's not time sensitive as we
heard. There-- there are things happening at the state.
This does not have to happen tonight. Um, we heard some
folks that sort of mirrored the convert for those folks,
for councillors who weren't here during those discussions.
This was a very discussions around the cannabis,
recreational cannabis was very hot topic. There were folks
that were, uh, on either side. Friends-- friendships were
lost over it. We heard tonight one side saying, yes, we
should go ahead with the original order. One side saying we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

amendments. And so if you're gonna force a vote on

should do the amendments. Again, I don't think this is the
best way to-- to do this to-- to get a-- a really a
rewritten ordinance at 4:58.
Um, and again, it's not because I don't think there's
206
Packet Pg. 673

3

some good stuff here. There may be, but I haven't had a
chance to evaluate it. I haven't had a chance to talk to
people. Um, and if I'm gonna be forced to vote on it, I'm

where I stand on it without having the opportunity to-- to
address it. So if it's withdrawn, we will table the other
one.
We can get together, we can talk about it and it can
come right back at the next meeting if that is what, um,
people want to do. But to ask us to vote on it tonight, um,
I just-- I-- I'm not ready to do that. And I would hate to
vote against it, um, for a principle purposes, just because
it wants to be-- we somehow need a decision tonight, which
we actually don't. So I-- I-- I hope Councilors Zondervan
will reconsider and withdraw this for now. Um, give us some
time to discuss it and bring it back next time and we can
deal with it then.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Oh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. Um, we wanted to put this on the agenda
tonight. We, um, saw that the City of Somerville has been
using, or just started implementing a Pilot program of
these smart boxes to work on their wrap problem. And we are
no different here in Cambridge.
We, um, we know that we have been doing all that we
can to mitigate the wrap problem here in Cambridge, but we

activity. And, uh, I know that, uh, our inspection services
department is keeping a pretty close tabs on where those
hotspots are.
So, uh, I'm hoping that our colleagues can join us
tonight and-- and moving this forward to the City Manager
and the Department of Public works to see if this is an
option for Cambridge. Um, because as the City Manager has
said before, we are not winning the war, uh, on rats. And,
um, it's just another tool in our toolbox that I hope that
we can use. So, thank you all. Yield back

and-- and asking, uh, for me to co-sponsor. Um, I think
there's, uh, a lot of concern. We've heard a lot of concern
in-- in the community, um, from folks who concerned about
the poison that-- that-- that-- that we use.

Um, not just the impact that that may have on a-- on a
animal that may eat that poison, but the po-- the rat
doesn't die right away. There are times where an animal

animal, um, dies from-- from-- from that second hand. Um, I
think this is a-- I'm not gonna amend, I don't wanna amend
this. I think that this is great. One thing I also, as we
move forward, I think we have to really start thinking
about, there are a lot of cities that are doing things like
rat sterilization.
I don't think we're gonna catch enough rats out of
this. I think we have to cut it off at the source. Um, so
I'm-- I'll be working on-- on some-- some language around
that. Um, but ha-- happy to see this and-- and-- and
support it because we are-- as I saw three rats run across
my front porch last night, we are losing this battle.

the Trash Barrel program that the city is about to, uh,
execute where the city will be distributing trash barrels
that, um, will be standardized and-- and hopefully will
also help to reduce the problem. So we-- we need to be
doing multiple things and I think this particular program
is-- is a good addition, especially given the concerns that
are out there about using poisons.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Um, I

actually-- I thought we had already asked the city to look
into birth control for-- for rats 'cause I know that we had
this discussion a while back and I had asked about it when
we were talking about using the, uh, rodent decides that
were quite harmful to wildlife.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And really explore, um, lots of other ones, including

So I think I was gonna suggest we add to this for a
report back on that because I know that I-- we had raised
it with DPW and it's something that we have to be-- have
all means at our disposal to address this. I think this is
216
Packet Pg. 683

a great idea. I know I saw it in the Globe. So thanks for
bringing it forward.
And I, um, know that we have worked on this pretty

decides that endanger other wildlife and find out from DPW
what the status of the reports on-- on using dry ice, which
is another way that's not harmful to other, um, creatures
as well and very, very effective and required state
legislation in order to allow that to be used for rodent
control and also the, um, the birth control of rats.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Anyone else? Um, thank the-- I

wanna thank the Vice Mayor for bringing this forward.
There's been a lot of ideas, um, coming over the years,
including, um, in Chicago actually a Shelter released, uh,
a thousand feral cats on the Chicago streets. And so
there's-- there's a lot of ideas to consider. So I think we
can start with this one and see where we go. So we can go
ahead and do a roll call on adoption.

We will go to Policy Order

Number 3, that the City Manager being hereby is requested
to consult with the Assistant City Manager for the
Department of Human Service Programs and the head of DHSP
preschools to determine how to better integrate more parent
response into their decision-making process as they make
changes that can have undue impacts upon the families they
serve. This was brought by Councillor Simmons and
Councillor McGovern. We'll go to Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Oh, thank you ma'am.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Denise E. Simmons - Yes

Through you to my colleagues. I brought this forward, uh,
because I had heard from a number of parents who were very
concerned about the DHSP preschool program and its decision
to cut back days and then reinstate them and then cut them
218

off again.
Now, we did all receive a letter from Ms. Semenoff,
Assistant City Manager, uh, Semenoff, and I certainly

efforts. But this goes toward looking forward. We have to,
as a council and as a city organization, make sure that
we've put families and parents first when we are thinking
about how we start, stop and interrupt, uh, childcare
services, uh, preschool services, uh, services to families.
And so this order is basically asking, uh, through,
uh, the City Manager to the Assistant City Management Human
Services, is to have a better way of reaching out to
families to let them know what's going on, give them as
much advanced notice as possible around, uh, program
closures, program interruptions.
We heard directly from a family member saying, I could
not have full-time employment because I lost that day, uh,
of preschool. And we-- we certainly don't wanna do that.

Monday. Um, so this is really about thinking again about
how do we evaluate and self-evaluate so that, uh, we
improve our communication moving forward. Uh, and I know
there are a lot of obstacles to this, but, you know, these
decisions all have significant impacts on families and-and, um, we always need to be striving, uh, to be better.

Sage Carbone, 273rd Street, spoke in support of the CMA
2022 #67, a communication transmitted from the City Manager
relative to awaiting report item #21-63 regarding food
insecurity. Since early 2020, Cambridge City growers have

provided free resources for urban agriculture, producing

communal garden spaces and edible foods in City planning

prioritizing indigenous plants. This work enhances soil,
air, and water health, benefiting future generations.
Residents benefit when they become stakeholders in the food
system, reducing the burden on nonprofits while empowering
individuals. It is essential to address food insecurity and
include these initiatives in City planning.

recommendations on reducing fossil fuel emissions and
identifying messaging as a crucial part of climate change

truthful communication by the Mayor to the public,

proposal to purchase a new vehicle for emergency
preparedness using grant money for the Fire Department. She
suggested that the money be used towards purchasing a new
fire truck or modifying the current one to be able to reach
buildings for both the bike lanes and parking in place. She
mentioned that one obstacle to retaining parking is the
current firefighting equipment, which would not be able to
reach the buildings if the separated bike lane was close to
the parked cars. Osgood proposed that using a design where
the bicycle lane is close to the curb and then there are
parked cars separating the bikes from the moving traffic
could be the answer to restoring and retaining parking while
still having a separated bike lane. She suggested that
appropriate firefighting equipment that could fight fires at

Packet Pg. 699

the proposals on the agenda that aim to assist people in
paying for water and sewer bills, as well as initiatives
that promote gardening and growing food. She highlighted the

sustainability and carbon sequestration. As the owner of a
neighborhood farm, she suggested that there are many yards
around the city that could be utilized for gardening and
proposed a call for yards to grow food in. She also
mentioned that the food grown in her yard goes to a food
pantry, which helps provide for those in need and promotes
community building. Overall, she expressed her hope that
these proposals would be implemented to create a more
supportive and sustainable community.

through you. Um, that, that was a question that had come up
over and over again when we, um, put this forward was with
bunnies were gonna get caught or squirrels. So, I'm glad to
9
Packet Pg. 704

4

hear that it's just rats in Somerville, um, and that our
bunnies and squirrel population will remain intact. Um, so I
think those were the, the questions that I had. I'm just

so quickly. I know that this is such a huge issue in the
community, and I know we've been doing everything that we
can, but I hope that this can be just another tool in our
toolbox to, to fight, uh, the rat problem here. Thank you,
Madam Mayor. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We're going to Councillor

McGovern, and then Councillor Zondervan, and then Councillor
Nolan.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. McGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

through you, uh, thank you also for, for turning us around
so quickly. Um at some point, can we -- will we be able to
get a just an update on other measures that you're using? I,
I think, you know, one of the things that I've heard from
folks and this, I don't want to preempt Councillor Nolan's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

grateful to, um, to your team for coming forward with this

question, but I think she's gonna go here, um, is that, um,
you know, rats breed so quickly that you can't really trap
your way out of this, this problem. And there was talk of
birth control for rats and other things that other cities
10
Packet Pg. 705

4

have done. So, at some point, I would just love to see a
report back on, on other things that we're considering doing
and, and, um, to address this problem.
Um, through you, Madam

Mayor, I think John can add more detail than I can in this
regard. But I would say that, you know, obviously we have
been using a rodenticide as our primary means of killing
rats up to now, and it is effective in terms of killing
rats. But we also recognize that in terms of wildlife, it
has an impact there. And I think that there is an ongoing
discussion among the task force associated with this as to
whether there are other alternatives that would be equally
as effective but perhaps less damaging to other creatures in
the environment. I know that in the Tobin School Project,
where we have a trapping, um, process in place, um, we
haven't seen many rats.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And so, you know, thankfully,

um, contrary to popular opinion, I think once construction

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COMMISSIONER OWEN O'RIORDAN:

starts on a given site, you don't see many rats around, um,
construction sites. But having said that is the one location
where we've used trapping and we haven't seen a significant
number of rats in that location. But John, do you want to
11
Packet Pg. 706

4

speak more broadly about what we're trying to do to address
this issue?
ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNER JOHN BOLDUC:

Yeah, thank you,

it on the head, you know. So, trapping can be effective in a
very small environment, um, where we know that we have a
known population. You know, one of the good things about the
SMART Box is at least what we're hearing is that if nothing
else is gonna give us data that we want. So, a lot of times
we get calls to go out to certain places, we'll put out bait
boxes or we'll do other measures, and we just don't -there's nothing there. The SMART Boxes actually tell you
where rats are. So, I think that that's part of the real
tool in that toolbox. I don't know that that's -- there's no
magic bullet there.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And, you know, beyond that, uh,

we have been using some other methods. We've been trying
carbon monoxide in a couple of spots and that can be only

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and through you, Madam Mayor. So, I think pretty much nailed

done in certain areas. So, in some of our park areas where
it's open, uh, it's in a kind of what we can control. We've
been using that. We feel like it's fairly successful. But I
-- I think the biggest thing that we're gonna be rolling out
12
Packet Pg. 707

4

soon enough in June is, you know, is our trash bottle
program. Uh, we'll have better control over how people keep
their trash. Um, we, we talk a lot about road and control

is about us getting out talking to the community about what
they can do because it is a citywide problem. It's not just
a City problem.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Um, so controlling trash, I

think in Harbridge, we've been meeting with some community
gardeners, um, about cleaning up things like gardens and
stuff. But we've gone to neighborhoods where people have
their own gardens in their backyard and just a lot of
Harbridge is left over. So, it's talking to those
neighborhoods, seeing what we can do as the City, you know,
have a, have a yard, clean up, we'll send a truck around to
do special pickups if we need to. But it's getting the word
out that this is -- this is a community thing where it is
about controlling waste. It's about making sure what you're

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and what the City is doing. I can't stress enough that this

putting out isn't feeding.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

You know, there's a lot of

people that love to feed birds in the City. I would say that
they're most likely feeding rats and not feeding birds,
13
Packet Pg. 708

4

getting people to understand that what they're doing
sometimes is not beneficial to the community. Um, so we're
continuing to try different methods. We have talked to

The birth control stuff, while I'm sure it could be
effective in some ways, it hasn't been successful in those
communities. It's not really a path that we've taken yet,
but something we could try if we think, you know, that
progresses a little bit further.
Council McGovern. All right. Um, before we go to
Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Nolan, we do have
Malcolm Bliss who's back, so I wanna yield to him, and then
we can go from there. Malcolm.

to the City's prior efforts in addressing the climate

Councillor Zondervan, and then Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you to the City Manager and staff. Thank you
for putting this on the agenda so quickly. It's, uh, good to
see us pulling out all the stops as we continue to try to
fight this problem. Um, my main question is where will we be
deploying these boxes? Have we figured that out yet?
COMMUNITY RELATIONS OFFICER DAN RIVIELLO:

Through you,

Madam Mayor. No, that's one of the things that the company

is gonna work with us once we have a contract in place, they
actually come out and meet with City staff. Um, they wanna
have a mix of, um, you know, business districts, more
residential areas, places like that to, to try them in
15
Packet Pg. 710

4

certain locations. That's what Somerville has been doing as
well. They're having a lot of success on a lot in Davis
Square for instance. But some of the other boxes that they

move those around. Um, so once we have the contract in
place, we'll meet and, um, be able to go through different
neighborhoods and see where the best places would be based
on road and activity. We've seen complaints we've had and
things like that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you. That makes sense. And, and I guess this
is still a pilot, so you're gonna figure out where to go
from here, but it seems kind of intuitively obvious that
you'd want to target some of the denser areas of the City.
So hopefully you'll be able to do that in, in East Cambridge
or Wellington-Harrington and in your pilot and then as you
expand to other parts of the City. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

definitely birth control would be very interested to know
how that's advancing using methods like dry ice, ensuring
that everything we do also is as Vice Mayor Mallon noted

want to kill other wildlife. And I know that's been an issue
going on. We've talked about it some in the Tobin
construction to make sure that depending on the rodenticides
we're using. But I, I just look forward to more reports on
this and to understanding how it is that we're ensuring that
we will be brought in the toolbox as -- as my colleagues
have also -- others that endorsed that. Thank you, Mayor
Siddiqui. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any other questions on this

call on the appropriation and placing the Awaiting Report on

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Most recently we had some

Afghani families who came directly looking for help around
fuel assistance and Eversource. And so, I think as far as

adding fuel assistance there, um, is -- would be important
because that's not there. Uh, and then we have some other
ideas on, I think, what else we could add to this list? Um,
it'd be great to get the new resident resources list
translated, you know, in the future. I'm sure that's in
progress. Um, and, and I think, um, yeah, overall, we have
some more ideas about just more, more, I think, programs
that are also used by, I think, new residents and then um
newer residents.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And so we'll share that but

wanted to pull it to, to, to talk a little bit more about it
and just let you know that we do have some -- our office has

additional ways that we could be partnering. So, thank you,

Thank you, Madam

exciting update. And as, as some of you know, I've been
working on this issue a long time, um, even helped plant the
garden in, in Heather's backyard, which she highlights. Um,
and this, this is really exciting that the City is -- is
looking to move forward in this way. So, I guess I, I just
have more questions about the details, you know, what are
some of the next steps? Um, what's the timeline look like?
How much funding are we allocating all of that?
COMMISSIONER OWEN O'RIORDAN:

I think Jennifer Letourneau is also online, together with

think the first thing we want to do at the Department of

Zondervan.

Public Works is begin to look at the existing policy that is
specific to the Community Garden Program. I think that's
something that we've been, um, thinking about doing for the
last period of time. And obviously given the abatement of
21
Packet Pg. 716

4

the COVID situation, I think we expect to move ahead with
that pretty immediately. I also think that we want to work
with those, um, entities that were mentioned in the report.

think more broadly about other opportunities in the City. I
know that Green Cambridge is actually looking at, um, other
spaces in parking garages, and so on. And so, we certainly
want to encourage that and want to participate in that.
Beyond that, I don't know if Jennifer is online and wants to
speak further about any additional details here.
JENNIFER LETOURNEAU:

I am here. Hi. Through you, Madam

Mayor. Um, we are, citywide, very excited about this
response back. Moving ahead definitely, as Owen said, um,
sort of we've hired a new Garden intern, which is up to 30
hours a week for the garden season. That's been a great
addition to the staffing at the DPW. Um, we are working
cross departmentally to go ahead with a public process for,
um, reworking the garden policy. Those will be public

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So as to begin to formulate, um, how best to, um, begin to

meetings, publicly advertised. It will focus mainly on the
garden coordinators to talk through, um, what actually
works, and making sure that that gets written down, but
those will be public meetings and fully transparent for the
22
Packet Pg. 717

public to attend as well.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Um, that will start this month

and will run through the garden season. Um, we're gonna be

season to actually really capture what works, what does not
work, and to get that until a fully flushed out policy by
the end of this garden season. And the public comment will
be again open the entire time. Um, as Owen stated, we are
working with Green Cambridge. Um, we've gone ahead and
created a partnership with IQHQ of pursuing land as part of,
um -- it was originally going to be a community garden and
we thought this is a really great opportunity to look more
towards an urban farm. That is going ahead. Um, and, um, I,
I can turn the balance of the time actually over to Iram if
she wants to speak to the rest of the Council response. But
happy to take any further questions.
IRAM FAROOQ:

I don't have anything to add on this

particular point. Thank you, Owen and Jennifer. You have

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. Through

you, Madam Mayor. Um, a few years back, I remember us
talking about an Urban Agriculture, Urban Farming Ordinance.
It was with the Beekeeping Ordinance, and maybe I'm getting
the name of it wrong. And I know that the Beekeeping
Ordinance came forward and we dealt with that, but I don't
think we ever got the, the urban farming piece done. Does

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Not, not yet, Councillor. I think we want to wait. The

this fit into that somehow? Is this -- is that other
ordinance kind of DOA, and we're doing this differently? Or
how does this all fit together, if at all?
IRAM FAROOQ:

I can speak to that, through you, Mayor.
24
Packet Pg. 719

4

Um, Councillor, yes, we did, at that point, deal with the
beekeeping and there was discussion about the -- about urban
farming. There are two pieces to it. In terms of people

that is permitted right now in the zoning, and no change is,
is needed in order to accomplish that. The issue that we had
been discussing was, uh, whether we needed to put in some
new zoning provisions if somebody wanted to grow food in
order to, uh, to then subsequently sell it, uh, at a
farmer's market. And, and at that point, given all of the
other, um, all of the other initiatives that were underway
in terms of desired zoning changes, that particular one was
moved to the back burner because it was not -- we were not
hearing as strong of a, a voice for people who wanted to
grow and -- in the City and then for the purpose of sale.
The Department of Public Health has in fact created,
um, regulations though for soil, um, soil conditions that
are needed in order to do that if somebody were to, uh, to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

growing food for their own consumption, that is something

purchase for -- to grow food for sale. Um, it is -- there is
a discussion though -- there was at that point a discussion
though about if that were to be deployed in a broader way,
if that were to be enabled, there are sort of capacity
25
Packet Pg. 720

4

constraints in this City about, um, monitoring and ensuring
that people are abiding by those regulations and where that
would sit, because whether it would be at ISD or at DPH. And

forward. If that is a priority, we could certainly bring it
forward, but we have, at the staff level, not heard a lot of
interest in for-sale farming.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. McGOVERN:

Thank you. Just a quick

follow up, through you, Madam Mayor. Is there a difference - I don't know if maybe this is a legal question. I don't
know. Is there a difference between growing something for my
own consumption sale, but maybe donating that food to
something I'm not selling it to someone. So, I'm not a
commercial -- you know, I'm not making money off it, but I'm
donating it to a food pantry or somewhere else. Does that
need a specific designation or does that count as growing it
for myself? I mean, I want -- because there are a lot of
people that, I mean, we heard today in public comment, there

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

so, um, so that particular piece has, uh, has not moved

are people that do that, and I want to make sure they're not
getting caught in some gray area.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor.

There's -- under zoning law, I think you're all familiar
26
Packet Pg. 721

4

with the concept of an accessory use. And for example, there
are certain accessory uses that are common, um, to homes
such as maybe having a private office in your home. Um, so

customary and usual home occupations shared with the home as
the primary use are permissible accessory uses. Where it
gets trickier is where you draw the line between what's an
accessory use to the primary residential use and what
becomes another principal use. And I think that we're
getting into at least a gray area if not over the line if
you're growing enough that you have any, uh, any quantity
that you're gonna be giving away. I think that that probably
crosses the line into becoming a principal use at which
point, if the Council wanted to allow that in certain
districts, that should be the subject of a zoning amendment.

things that have been considered historically to be

Through you to the City Manager and the team. Just to switch
to the Double Up Food Bucks, which was one of the things
that was part of the report back in a recommendation on
perhaps expanding this program. I know currently in
27

4

Cambridge, we are only seeing that program at the Daily
Table in Cambridge, which is, uh, one location. But I did
mention in the report that Pemberton Farms was also

me that they, um, they have this program as sort of the
local Bodegas that are, you know, sort of the neighborhood
stores.
Are we approaching, um, any of our local, you know,
sort of corner markets that participate in our Healthy
Markets Program and also take SNAP to see if they're
interested in, in taking this on? It's, it's just been
coming up as a -- um, this is where people shop, right? This
is where they -- this is where people shop for their, their
items. And, um, you know, getting something in the local
market might be a really good place for us to start
targeting and, and identifying. However, I don't think that
they're watching this meeting or, or watching this Double Up
Food Bucks conversation very closely. So, I'm just curious

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Farms, and it's true that the, uh, the Boston model has, um
-- I think they have about nine stores, including smaller
Bodegas. Uh, it's certainly something that, um, that we at

would certainly be willing to, um, to reach out to
additional, uh, additional markets to, uh, to understand
their willingness and, uh, pursue this further certainly of
interest.

VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Oh, thank you, Madam

that would be great and then maybe even using the business
associations to reach some of those members as well, because
I know that they're out every day talking to their

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

know that they have been approached by, uh, by Pemberton

membership, um, and these local markets certainly are part
of that. So, getting as many local markets as involved into
this Double Up Food Program, Double Up Food Bucks Program. I
think would be a really wise use of our money to try to

address food insecurity and getting that healthy food to as
many residents as we can. So, um, that was just my one
thing. Thank you. I yield back.

Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, just wanted to briefly respond to
Councillor McGovern's question in two parts. One is that I
do think it's important that we address the economic
opportunity aspect of this, um, particularly for, you know,
lower income residents who may want to run a small amount of
business through their garden, you know. And, um, I think
the, the Solicitor has given us a way to do that. And so, I
-- I think we should -- we should look into allowing that as
a necessary use. Um I, I think what I heard, Ms. Farooq says
that there is a concern about the soil conditions, and I do

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

know when, when we were doing the farm in Heather's
backyard, there was a lot of lead contamination that we had
to mitigate. And, you know, we kind of figured that out on
our own. And you know, the EPA website has a lot of
30
Packet Pg. 725

4

information about how to do that. But I can understand that
the City would be concerned if, you know, people were trying
to figure that out on their own.

around that and, and to put in place the infrastructure to
make sure that we could supervise that activity. That being
said, it's not that complicated. You know, the key is to
cover the soil and put raised beds on top of that. And you
know, if we need additional staffing, then that should be,
uh, part of the consideration and, and put forward in the
budget. But I think it is an important opportunity for
economic, um, opportunity to be created in the City. And you
know, we're, we're about to consider a Green Jobs Ordinance
and, you know, urban agriculture is, is one of the things
that I listed in there as a -- as an area for green jobs
that we should be exploring. So, I do think it's -- it's
time to revisit that, that issue. Thank you.

So, it would be important to have some regulation

think one question just to close the loop, I understand that
there's a lot of layers, there's the policy piece that, um,
Commissioner O'Riordan mentioned, and then there's a legal
opinion that our Solicitor provided. Um, I think one
31

question at the -- with the paragraph at the end of that
opinion has said that, you know, we would have to -- the
specifics of reporting requirements would need to be

there's been no formal -- I don't think there's been a
request from -- or I don't know if there has been -- has
there been a request on specifically the garden beds? And if
not, you know, does it need to be formalized to, to be, you
know, vetted?
COMMISSIONER OWEN O'RIORDAN:

Through you, Mayor. Um, I

don't believe there has been, but I could stand to be
corrected. Um, we May have gotten something through the
public request process but um, we'll take this notification
and add to it to our tickle list of items that we're
considering and then, uh, we'll keep track of it that way
for the next round of notifications.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay, great. Yeah, I think it

Extraordinary Expenditures account to fund the procurement
of five pieces of equipment for use in snow and ice
operations. And that's $915,000, not $900,000. Go ahead,
Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui, and thank you through you to the City Manager and
the DPW staff for bringing this forward. One really exciting
part of it is an ability to clear bike lanes. That's
terrific. It really is something that a lot of people ask
about is how is it that we're gonna clear bike lanes? It
definitely cost more, and it is really worth it because we
need to ensure that they're usable throughout all seasons.
Um, I, I am curious, I was very happy to see the last

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Manager, relative to the appropriation of $900,000 from Free

paragraph which at least acknowledges that we have been
looking at hybrids and alternative vehicles, which is not
always in the appropriations that we see of vehicles. I was
just surprised that there was a reference to saying some
34
Packet Pg. 729

4

manufacturers are making strides to offer hybrid, but the
current models don't work because I know John Deere has a
front loader that is hybrid. So, I'm just curious as to what

determine that those really weren't appropriate for this
purchase.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DePASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor. So, Councillor, we actually did look at the John
Deere and it is something that, um, my Superintendent of the
Streets, TJ Shea, is actually very interested in. I think
we're all very interested in it. That particular model that
they make is, is just far too big for us. The bucket of that
vehicle actually would make it difficult just to get down
some of our smaller streets. Uh, and even though we use that
primarily in the winter time, it's also an integral part of
our, you know, our street maintenance and construction
stuff. So John Deere, I think is making strides. They have a
couple of more -- they actually have a more -- we looked at

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

kind of background back up and process you went through to

the, I think it's the 664 or 644, I have it in there. And we
also looked at the bigger one that they have. They have one
that is much more massive than that.
So, they haven't gotten down to the smaller sizes that
35
Packet Pg. 730

4

we could use, but certainly something we're interested in.
There are some mini loaders now that are all electric. I
think I mentioned in our write-up, you know, for these

this point. They just don't -- they, they couldn't keep up
with the -- with what we're doing. But as more and more of
the hybrid models come out, we are certainly looking at
those options.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. You know,

we're all interested in this. We all have a policy. So, this
did acknowledge that you've looked at other models. So, I'm
happy to go forward with this, unlike some of the other
purchases before us, which do not have the backup. Um, but
it really, in the future, it would be really good to have
the backup exactly what, what -- through you, Mayor, that
the staff just said, here's the model we looked at, here's
why it doesn't work, here's the, um, back and forth on, on,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

pieces of equipment, they really can't be all electric at

on why it is that we're picking this one, because that's
what our Green Fleet Policy anticipates and it would be
really good if we were -- if we were able to follow that on
this. But again, I appreciate that you actually went to the
36
Packet Pg. 731

4

trouble and looked at the, the hybrid and the EV and I
expect and hope for them very soon to be replacing our
vehicles. These are ones -- the ones in here are lasting 20

pretty soon if we're going to go to all EVs very soon.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DePASQUALE:

Actually, there was

a mistake on the loader that's actually 30 years old. It's a
1992 front end loader that has given us a good number of
years, but it's time to retire.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI: Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Then I have another

questions. Why would we be buying something when we know if
it lasts another 30 years, we cannot use it because we are
not going to be able to use any fossil fuel driven truck
within a very short period of time? So, why not lease it and
then be in a position to lease an EV or hybrid when it comes
out?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DePASQUALE:

Yeah. So, we're --

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

years, so we know that we're gonna have to replace them

again, I'd say, Councillor, with the snow equipment, well, I
don't -- manufacturers are not there yet to be able to
provide us with the long hours that we need to run these
pieces of equipment, including the front-end loader. That
37
Packet Pg. 732

4

particular piece of equipment is on its last legs. Yes, we
could look at renting some stuff. Um, I, I, I think, you
know, as the stuff that we can rent out there is not always

equipment, especially when you're looking at that
construction equipment, the, the uh manufacturers, although,
you know, some are trying the hybrid, there are other very
small electric ones. I think they are all starting to get,
uh, better when it comes to emissions and things like that.
So we feel that this loader will serve us well. I think we
need to get the other one off the street before it comes
dangerous. Um, and again, I, I, I think I wrote it up and I
know that you came down to see us, we are certainly looking
at how we can electrify our fleet and certainly get hybrids,
more hybrids into our fleet, so.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes. No, I understand,

that's why I suggested -- the point was that if we leased,

then we would have less money in and we -- but I understand
your answer. Thank you. I yield, Mayor Siddiqui.

internal combustion engine doesn't mean we have to burn
fossil fuels. And I know that for the King Open School, for
example, we put a biodiesel backup generator in place. So,
what's the possibility of burning biofuels in some of those
internal combustion engines in the -- in the future?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DePASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

Mayor. So, Councillor, we've been actually burning, uh,
biodiesel since, I think, 2006. It goes back that far. Uh,
we've gone back and forth. We had some pretty cold years
there. We were burning, uh, B20 when it was kind of just in
its infancy. Right now, we are -- we are, um, in the -- in
the warmer months, we run B20. Uh, we, we typically run B5
in the wintertime, but I think with the manufacture, we've
been using and the quality of the fuel that we're getting,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

is still trying to catch up. Um, but just because we have an

regarding the feasibility of waiving dog license fees.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. McGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

through you. And so, this would be waiving, uh, fees for,
uh, folks over the age of 70. Um, this was a policy order I
put in last term. I guess I just have more of a procedural
question. Um, the -- in the book, in our books, the action
is to place on file, but in reading this, we need to accept
if we want to do this, which I hope we do. We need to accept
the provision which is included in our report and then
change the ordinance. So, should we be referring this to the
Ordinance Committee, as opposed to place this on file, it
kind of goes away? So, what should we be doing to make sure
this actually happens?
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor.

I didn't realize it said that, I agree with you. So, there

are two, um, actions to be taken here. Uh, the first would
be to pass the order, um, accepting the statute that would
allow us to amend the ordinance in that way. And, uh, the
second action would be to refer this proposed, um, code

possible if we can pass it to a second reading. And it was
just confusing because in the report, it was -MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

written the right way.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. McGOVERN:

In the report, it was

saying we had to do these other things, but in the book, it
didn't say that, so.

that was -- I think it was an error on how it came to us, so

language which we're doing tonight to a second reason? Is
there somebody in your office who reviews changes to Mass

something like this happening? I just -- I feel bad that,
you know, for 20 years, seniors in our City have not had the
option to waive these permit fees. And I just didn't know if
there was somebody in your office who keeps an eye on that
Mass General Law when there are things like this and brings
them to the Council. Is that something that is a function of
the Solicitor's Office?
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor.

I don't -- I don't see how we could possibly keep track of
every piece of legislation. Um, we did put in this order
that we accept the provisions of the statute that was
changed. So, when the Council refers something to us to
review, to see how we can do something, we definitely review
all of the applicable laws, including amendments that may

other issue that was mentioned in the policy order around

amendments that we just passed wouldn't address that. So, I,

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. I am so

excited about this. And before I say anything, I really want
to thank the City staff who stepped in due to a snafu on the
production of this report and the -- through the City
Manager's Office, Mr. Gianetti and several people stepped in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

communication and Reports from other City Officers Number 3.

to make this report go from just common text to the report
you had before that. So, I really want to thank for that
extra effort in the last couple of very crazy days. And I
want to thank Mayor Siddiqui for convening this and working
49
Packet Pg. 744

4

really closely with us to get to the point where we are
today. And the CCWG members represented representatives from
several groups within the City. And then many people who

justice, around public health, around climate activism who
have not been as involved in City efforts but have been
involved in some cases, state, and national efforts.
And I want to thank them for their time in these
meetings to come together with the report. The IPCC came out
with a report today saying it is now or never. And the world
needs "rapid, deep and immediate cuts in carbon emissions
for us to have any prayer of making good on the
environmental justice, on the national security issues, on
public health issues, on the liability of the planet." So,
this report is really timely, just a couple things I want to
highlight from the report. The report is dedicated to the
hundreds of Cambridge residents who over the years have
worked to push Cambridge to address the climate crisis in a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

have devoted their lives to doing work around climate

meaningful way. That was a very clear message that we want
to build on the work of the City as a whole, including City
staff and all the, um -- and many residents who have pushed
for this.
50
Packet Pg. 745

4

The goal, um, was to provide input and guidance to all
of us here, City Council and the Working Group sought to
identify ways to accelerate progress and develop a list of

beginning, the goal was to make sure the output of the group
was not a report to put on a shelf but a guide for a new
approach to climate work. It was a task that was
challenging, and I think we met most of our goals. The City
has enough reports and lists of actions to take, and we
recognize that we need a culture shift and a financial
investment to match the need. So those of us on the group
see the value added of the CCWG to the stellar climate work
that has already been done over the last two decades in our
willingness to call out and identify lapses in program
implementation, which have inhibited progress, which have
inhibited effectiveness and a general lack of progress on so
many of our climate goals.
So, a key recommendation is to propose a culture shift.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

targeted actions for the City to implement. From the

You can all read the report. There are specific
recommendations, again, building on work, but also bringing
in some new work. And there's three main messages. We need a
mindset change, we need mandates, and we need money. And if
51
Packet Pg. 746

4

we put those in place, I think the City can really live up
to our reputation as a climate leader and move forward in a
way that is so desperately needed in this City. So again, I

read it. Um, included on the Climate Crisis Working Group
was a City staff and also again, this range of, of experts
from around the City and state. I'm very grateful, and I
really hope we are going to prove that Cambridge can really
be a role model for the rest of the country. Thank you very
much, Mayor Siddiqui, for your leadership.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, my thanks to you as well for your

detailed comments that I will transmit to Councillor Nolan,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

want to thank everyone involved. I hope all my colleagues

but I wanted to highlight something that, that Mr. Pitkin
mentioned in public comment as well that back in 2009, when
the Cambridge City Council declared a climate emergency, and
we organized the first Cambridge Climate Congress, one of
52
Packet Pg. 747

4

the key recommendations from the Congress was that the City
should have a Chief Sustainability Officer. And at the time,
that request was denied and, and it has never been

And I -- I agree with, with Mr. Pitkin that, that you
as the Mayor can carry out the function of communicating
about the issue and, and that's tremendously helpful.
Councillor Nolan and I were on a Zoom this morning with the
Chief Sustainability Officer in Ithaca, New York. And after
we got off the Zoom, we both agreed with each other that we
were incredibly jealous because he's able to do amazing
stuff. All the things that we're talking about that we wanna
do in Cambridge, he's actually doing it and he's able to do
it because his office is tasked with thinking big, thinking

implement, and then drawing resources to the to his City to
actually implement some of those programs.
So, one of the things that he was telling us about is

funded by Amazon Corporation. So, I think as we go forward
and we think about how to implement these great
recommendations in, in this report, we really think about
how do we want to organize our, our City infrastructure, our

departments, and should we consider creating an Office of
Sustainability that can really focus on moving us forward in
the right direction? Because, you know, the City of

decade or so, um, but as this report shows, we're still
falling short, we're still behind. And, and I think part of
the reason is that we don't have a, a locus for that
activity in our -- in our City government. Thank you, Mdam
Chair.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Carlone,

and then Vice Mayor Mallon.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

through you. Uh, I concur with my fellow Councillors. Um, I
think we talked about this prior, but I was with Councillor
Zondervan with the Planning Board, and the Planning Board
reaction to the Green New Deal was quite bluntly, push it
faster and further, and everything we're talking about
tonight insists on that. And some people still say, well,

Cambridge certainly has done tremendous work over the last

why should Cambridge be a leader? Well, we're wealthier than
almost any other City. We got Harvard and MIT scientists, we
have their wealth. Um, somebody has to lead beyond Ithaca.
And I give Ithaca enormous credit, and I assume the
54
Packet Pg. 749

university has something to do with that there as well.
Um, if we're gonna even come close to 2050, we have to
be -- have cities that take the lead to be there much

doing now. So, I concur, and I thank you very much for doing
this report and for taking the lead. And I totally agree
with Councillor Zandervan, if you don't have someone
responsible who's at the top, um, it doesn't always happen
as fast as it can happen. So, thank you. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Vice Mayor Mallon.

VICE MAYOR ALLANA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you and to you and to Councillor Nolan, my deep
appreciation for taking this on. I know how, how much work
it takes to do it to put together a task force. And I feel
like, um, over the past several months, every time I spoke
with Councillor Nolan, she was either preparing for a
meeting, she was writing up a meeting, she was doing all of
the work that goes into putting this report together with

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

earlier to show other cities how to do it like Ithaca is

the Task Force members. And I, I just want to say thank you
to you, um, to the Mayor for putting this together and for
everybody that was involved, and especially our City staff,
um, for, for really putting the time in and putting these
55
Packet Pg. 750

recommendations forward. I know it's been a lot of work and
I, I hope that, um, you are happy with where we are and
where we can go with these recommendations. So again, just

together. Thank you. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Just a very quick question. I know how much hard work went
into this process. I'm just curious, one of the things that
we know, and in fact, my colleague and I, when I first came
to the Council, worked on a program that looked at the
effects of climate change on the community of color. And so
specifically to that question, I'm just interested -- I have
not read the report so it may be there and if it is there,
then I'll stand corrected. I'm just curious in terms of the
planning and the possible execution of this planning, how
many people of color actually participated?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Sure. Well, Councillor Nolan,

an appreciation for me to both of you, uh, for putting this

you can put it together, but we had a number of -- that was
a very intentional thing that we wanted to do to make sure
that we had that representation because as we know, climate
change, um, we know who that impact falls on. So Councillor
56

4

Nolan, do you want to speak to the specific individuals?
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

I won't bother the

Council taking that time. Councillor Nolan can send it to me

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Great. And, you know, I think

just to close out my remarks, I think what I've heard
tonight and many nights, uh, this issue is something that,
you know, we all have to -- it's a collective effort. Uh,
and, you know, it's definitely one of my priorities and
which is why I put together this, this Working Group. And
you'll also hear from our office, we have a range of events
as part of the Climate Month, which is this month, April.
So, I would encourage everyone to participate. And then,
we'll be -- it's not just one month, right? It's every day.
So, we will have more events, um, to, you know, really,
really develop, um, a better culture and a cultural shift,
um, across the City around, uh, issues addressing climate
change.

So, this is just -- this is -- this work is incomplete,
there's so much more to do, and, you know, we'll all be
working. It's a huge priority for me. Um, and you know, I
will be working -- we're working closely with Councillors

you to the cast members who spent time, um, you know,
working on this and my Chief of Staff who, um, did, you

ahead and refer.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah, the motion will be

Mike Rowland, North Cambridge resident. Encouraged

support for Charter Right #2, and Policy Orders #3 and
#6. Requested the City Council to intervene in this
process, slow it down, obtain input from, and give due
consideration to the concerns of all impacted
stakeholders. And work with all to formulate a plan that

does every day, and that he would like to continue to be
able to do.
Rebecca Neuman, Concord Avenue, Cambridge. Called in
to ask the City Council not to support Policy Orders #3
and #6. She further pointed out, this is an especially
dangerous section of Cambridge, with 10 times as many
bike crashes as comparable stretches. In addition to
improving safety, she sought the need to consider the
city's ambitious climate goals. In order to hit those
climate goals, we need to make a dramatic mode shift.
Spoke of how she doesn't feel comfortable biking around
the city with kids.

infrastructure that is currently in place. She spoke of
Porter Davis and North Cambridge, and terrifying
experiences she had biking in unprotected lanes. She

called for a sooner implementing of the infrastructure
since it would encourage more folks to bike rather than
drive, save carbon costs associated with alternative,

reduce the number of bike accidents likely to occur.
Catherine Santrock, 17 Bellis Circle. She thanked
the councillors and the city staff for their ongoing
commitment to safe biking infrastructure. She urged the
council to vote no on Policy Orders #3 and #6. Spoke on
how studies have shown that protected bike lanes, even
quick-build, reduce the frequency of fatal accidents. She

the city, to ensure that the roads in Cambridge are safe
for non-car drivers as well.
Beth Gamse, 14 Walker Street. A long-time resident,
homeowner, taxpayer, and an avid pedestrian. She urged

She told the council that they have incomplete
evidence and evaluation of what the impacts will be. That
they have evidence of very limited public participation
in the decision making that led to the Cycling Safety

Ordinance. That they have no clear budget for what this
will cost. That they don't know what the unintended
consequences will be for small businesses, pedestrians,

for bicyclists who ignore traffic signals and endanger
pedestrians.
Makayla Comas, address not provided. Community
Engagement Manager at LivableStreets Alliance, located at
70 Sidney Street. Shared one takeaway from interviewing
business and users of MassAve4; 6,900 bus riders who use
the 77 bus, do not show up to meetings like this in a
large organized fashion. Bus riders are feeling the
impacts of traffic along Mass Ave, yet they have seen
positive changes in their bus experience because of the
bus lanes that were implemented in North Cambridge. In
her capacity in LivableStreets, she asked the council

Commonwealth, the CDC, and the Cambridge COVID-19

Thanks, Louis. Uh, good evening

everyone. I'm gonna provide, uh, as expeditious as I can
be, uh, an update on, uh, COVID, and where we are
currently with this pandemic. First slide, please.

As of two weeks ago, Middlesex County has moved into
the CDC'S medium community level. Cambridge remains in
the medium category. After a steady upward trend in COVID

the past five days.
Regional wastewater level has also appeared to have
plateaued. While these trends are encouraging, there's
still a relatively high level of disease in the
community.
With respect to the CDC community levels, I want to
remind people that a big component of this measurement is
hospital capacity.
So being in the low or medium category level,
essentially, tells you that if you need a hospital bed,
there likely is one available to you.
It does not necessarily mean that there is a low
risk for contracting COVID-19. I think that's an
important distinction to make, and it underscores the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

cases for several weeks, we've seen a slight reduction in

importance of accessing personal risk and taking
precautions accordingly.
Further, given that many people are using rapid
tests at home, and those positive--positive results are
58

not reflected in the available local data, we believe
that the data are likely and under count of the actual
COVID cases in the community.

higher ed versus non-higher ed cases. You'll see that
university cases in Cambridge are, again, making up the
majority of our reported cases.
However, as a--as more people test at home, the
reported numbers are becoming less reliable as an
indicator of true--of the true COVID picture. We may be
seeing more higher ed cases simply because there has been
mandatory testing on campuses, and these results are
reported to the state.
MIT has made testing optional. Harvard will also be
phasing out required testing in the next few weeks. We'll
be watching to see how this impacts the reported case
numbers.
Next slide, please. This chart shows the COVID-19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Next slide, please. This chart shows our hires, our

uh, essentially reflect that. This is another example of
how as few results are reported, the data are becoming
more sensitive to contextual shifts.
Next slide. As we continue to beat--beat the same
prevention drum that we've been beating all along, as I
said the last time I was here, this pandemic is largely
in the hands of our residents.
Our recommendations continue to be the following,
get vaccinated and boosted, consider masking indoors when
not in your own home.
Masking is especially important for people who are
at high risk for serious illness or live--live with
someone who's at high risk. We will contin--we will
continue to recommend masking on public transportation

Believe me when I say that the pandemic, believe me
when I say that we in public health are every bit as

every member of the community to continue to do their
part while this virus is still with us.
And let's not forget, we're still in the global
pandemic. That hasn't changed.
Next slide. For individuals who do contract-contract COVID-19, I like to put out a reminder that
there are several free and effective treatment options.
These treatments can prevent serious illness and
hospitalization, but they need to be administered early
to be effective.
Treatment is available to people who are at
increased risk of severe disease, test positive for
COVID-19 and have any symptoms, even mild ones.

As a reminder, the health department is not the only
game in town when it comes to vaccines. Vaccines and

5

this group is doing, or what we call C3.
C3 members continue to distribute test kits, mask,
and isolation and quarantine information to residents and

numbers of COVID cases.
They're also responding to individual requests from
residents who have been contacted by the case
investigation team. All we remember in the beginning as
contact tracers. They're still doing that work.
This ability to deliver supply--supplies to
community members who need them is something that we're
extremely proud of, and we intend to use this model to be
responsive to the residents beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
C3 is branching out into other activities as well,
including promotion of the Port Energy Walking Tour that
took place yesterday, participating in the city's doorto-door resident outreach campaign, and promoting the

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Thanks for

the report. Just a quick, I think future question, which
I've asked many times. It would be helpful to understand
whether any decisions we've made based on the waste water
data was actually changed as a result of us having it.
Because since we only get it weekly, it's hard for
me to understand if we've ever been able to use it as
opposed to using the daily from the MAWI.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So in the future, I would think that we would need
it on a daily basis in order for it to actually affect
decisions. 'Cause I don't think it has actually changed
any decisions we've made because of this--this issue of-64
Packet Pg. 820

5

of timeliness.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
DERRICK NEAL:

Any comments?

Yeah. Before I, um, uh, send this

uh, uh, Conciliator Nolan is that, uh, our C3 group, the
community outreach group, we use that data, the
wastewater data along with a combination of other, um,
data sets in order to target outreach to communities
where we see, uh, arising cases.
So that's part of that goes into our decision making
process--process with regards to choosing where we target
to, uh, provide outreach. Uh, but through you, Madam
Mayor, I want to, um, go to Anna and let her, uh, provide
further clarity and insight to that. Um, question,
ANNA KAPLAN:

Uh, through you, Madame Mayor, to you

Councillor Nolan, um, yes, that's correct. The--the
neighborhood data does allow us, uh, we use it in concert
with our other indicators.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

over to --to, uh, Anna. What I, what I will offer, uh,

Um, you know, we take a layered approach to most of
this stuff because the switch to home testing means we
can't just run case data.
Uh, the wastewater is a great, um, way of comparing
65
Packet Pg. 821

5

what we do know about through reportable disease, uh, to
what we may not be capturing.
And you're correct, there are certainly limitations

other indicators together, we do think we get a pretty,
again, not perfect but decent picture.
Um, but, you know, it's sort of a question of cost
versus benefit to switch to daily sampling would be, um,
a significant cost.
So when we have the daily sampling at the regional
level, plus the local sampling weekly plus, uh, case data
that's available continuously from the state, um, we get,
plus feedback we hear from the community, we get a decent
picture. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

to weekly, uh, collection. However, uh, with all of our

know, let's see, 8,000 supposedly. It probably wasn't
because we saw no correlation to the case.
And again, we don't have to believe this now, but it
would be good to have a specific example of how that data

5

has actually changed decisions that we've made, just so
that in the future we know whether we should even do the

sure that we understand how it is that, because we have
other, uh, other data available too. And I understand it

been very confusing to epidemiologists,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, ma'am.

May it through you. Uh, thanks for the update. In terms
of the hospitalization rates, again, I understand why
we're using that as a metric, but I have real concerns
with that being a trailing indicator.
So by the time we realize that hospitalizations are
going up, it's already too late to prevent that.
So how are we making those kind of decisions in the
future? I understand right now we're saying, okay, we

I recognize it. It's very costly. So I want to make

don't need to wear masks, or at least we don't need to
mandate mask wearing because hospitalization rates are
low.
But if we wait until they start getting high again
67
Packet Pg. 823

5

before we take action, it'll be too late. So can you help
me understand how we're making those decisions going
forward?
Derek, do you want

to jump in? I can make some comments, but I don't know if
you want to jump in first.
DERRICK NEAL:

Yeah, I'll start off and then I'll

defer to Dobberteen. But what I can say is that it was
never the decision of, uh, the local health department in
Cambridge, uh, to, uh, use hospitalization, uh, as, uh, a
barometer for community health.
The CDC changed the metrics that, uh, they use and
they were, uh, consequently, uh, adopted by the--the
Massachusetts Department of Health.
Uh, so while--while we don't have, what we don't
want to see is that we don't want to see anybody--anyone
contract COVID-19, because what some of the empirical
data is telling us now is that it is potential, it can

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

potentially cause long-term, um, health consequences, uh,
for, for even those of us who've experienced COVID and
we've, um, uh, recovered from it.
So that wasn't an, uh, an indicator that we used,
68
Packet Pg. 824

5

but, uh, that was something that the CDC, uh, implemented
and was subsequently, uh, subsequently, um, adopted by
state health departments.

that we shouldn't wait until people, uh, reach that
state, uh, before we, uh, sound the alarm bell.
And that's why we always talk about practicing those
mitigation factors, um, so to prevent the
hospitalization.
So I hope I'm answering your question, but through
you, Madam Mayor and councilman, I'll, uh, let our
physician, uh, provide a more, um, medically, uh, uh,
based, uh, response.
LISA DOBBERTEEN:

Thank you, Derrick, and through

you, Madam Mayor, to you, Councillor Zondervan. Um, I
think that one of the things we've learned through this
most recent, uh, surge of the BA.2 variant of Omicron is
that while widely transmissible and highly contagious, it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And I do agree with you, uh, uh, uh, councilman, uh,

tends to cause less disease--less severe disease.
So we can feel a little bit more at ease that our
hospital system is not strained and overwhelmed as it was
in January, or as it was during the Delta phase of the
69
Packet Pg. 825

5

pandemic. So it's just another way of looking at how
this, uh, virus affects our healthcare system.
So the CDC metric includes both hospitalizations,

numbers. And so we continue to look at all of those
things simultaneously.
But I would agree with everything Derek has said,
um, previous to me, and, um, think that we--we are
watching it all carefully, as always,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

outdoor dining. We are aware that the one restaurant in
Central Square is going before the licensing commission
and,--and is having some, uh, opposition to continuing
outdoor dining there.

go before the license commission and--and how we can make

is on the line, has any update on that specific issue.

Um, yeah, I can't get too in the weeds on specific, um,

because their license expired on April 1st. So they need

just en encourage the city to make it as easy as possible
and streamline the process as much as possible.

license commission, but if there's no other choice, just,
you know, please make it as easy as possible for--for
these businesses to continue. Thank you.

Thank you, Ma'am

Mayor, through you. Um, first, my thanks for this
response. This was really, uh, encouraging to see. And,
uh, I want to say that, you know, obviously removing some
of these barriers is not a solution to--to the problem.
Uh, obviously we need more housing, and we would
love to eliminate homelessness, but if people are in a
situation where they have to sleep on a bench, we want to
make sure that there's no unnecessary barriers there.
And I also want to point out that there's no

who are homeless.
Sometimes people who are homeless have disabilities,
but also there are ways to structure these, um, benches

and people who are disabled can--can use them fully.
So again, I really appreciate the response. My--my

CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Um, through you,

Madam Mayor. Um, Councillor, we have removed a number of
those barriers in--in number of our parks thus far.
I think as we move into the summer months, I think
what we're going to begin to concentrate on is in the
squares, Harvard Square and Central Square.
Um, again, we have over 600, um, of these benches in
the city. And given the survey that we've completed thus
far, we--we see about 30% of them have these barriers in
place.
And so there's--there are concentrations of them in
certain locations. And so it's just trying to get a
reasonable balance between those that have, uh, these

sufficient accommodation for people who want to rest and
lie down on these benches is important.
And so, as we move through the squares, at this

Um, I think we've given some very brief examples as
to how you can modify some of the more basic benches, but
we've also got benches that are des--that are designed
specifically for certain areas.
And so that may be more challenging. We may have-have to return to City Council looking for some
additional funds to address those areas.

comprehensively, Councillor, at, um, all of the, um, the

just to be totally candid, we have not actually framed
what the public process around that looks like, but we

78

Um, as members of the council, uh, may remember, uh, last
term in November, the City Council passed, um, a request
asking CDD and the planning board to come up with options

pretty ugly history, both in the United States, but also
within Cambridge.
Um, the planning board has hosted three meetings as
shown in this memo. Um, and I tuned into all of them,
and, uh, it really seems that they were struggling to
grapple with, uh, what we were hoping to achieve and, uh,
aim through this.
Um, and so reading through this, I think that it
makes sense that we forward this to the Housing
Committee.
I've talked to Councillor Simmons who chairs the
committee, and I think that, um, that would be a great
place to get more detail from the council, and we can
forward it back to CDD, uh, to get some, uh, options in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Carlone, and then Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Uh, to begin?

Sorry. No, I'm gonna go to

then Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you, to my colleagues, um, and to the city
manager, thank you for this, uh, update. It was very
helpful information.
I think considering this rezoning provides us with
an opportunity to get more affordable housing,
particularly inside of our neighborhoods.
I think the overlay has been helpful in generating
and supporting some larger projects and--and bigger
apartment buildings, but has not produced a lot of new
affordable housing in the neighborhoods.
And, you know, that was expected. I think we, we
didn't think it was going to be able to do that,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Zondervan, and then Councillor Carlone, and

particularly in smaller projects.
So if we do rezone, I think it's really important
that we keep in mind how do we promote more affordable
housing inside the neighborhoods. And I have some
80
Packet Pg. 836

5

thoughts about how we might be able to do that, that I'll
be introducing soon.
Um, we also want to be careful that we're not

don't get larger single family homes as a result of
rezoning.
Because I think both of those are--are real dangers
if we--if we're not careful about how to rezone, um,
these--these districts.
And then lastly, as part of affordable housing, we
really need to think about how to promote home ownership,
which affordable home ownership, which really interacts
well with these smaller projects.
And--and that's an important aspect of--of doing
racial justice and, and, um, undoing some of the harms
that--that have been done over the last century or so, as
Councillor Azeem mentioned.
So I look forward to the discussion and moving this

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

boosting gentrification as we rezone, um, and that we

forward in a--in a thoughtful and effective manner. Thank

Mayor. I, I participated in, I think it was one or not
two of these meetings.
And yes, the planning board and staff had some

were, but it's a complex issue.
That is why it's not that they didn't make up their
mind, they didn't all agree on things. And that says that
it really has to be thought out very well.
Um, I do think the issue of maintaining as much of
our in these neighborhoods is much of our tree, um, uh,
uh, coverage and open space is critical given that we
have half the public open space of the average city.
And we've talked about that in our environmental
discussions. I still, I think there is a way to do this.
I think areas that are closer to mass transit, um, make
more sense in areas that are not. Um, now we can add mass
transit through a shuttle system, of course.
I also truly believe that Mass Avenue, my

neighborhood, Mass Avenue, Cambridge Street, the main
avenues are the most logical place for future housing
development, and much more potential in number wise than
what we're looking at here. Um, and I think that has to
82
Packet Pg. 838

5

be in consideration.
This discussion by the planning board basically said
it all has to be in balance. And you have to, we each

are.
Um, I, for one, believe housing is our number one
goal, not just, uh, low income housing, but housing. And,
uh, zoning does not mix zoning.
What I mean by that is zoning that allows office,
labs, and housing. There won't be housing. It's not
happening. Uh, it's always commercial development. And,
um, I think that issue more than anything is going to
really dictate where housing gets built and not get
built. Thank you, Madam Mayor,

Siddiqui, through you to the city staff and city manager,

meetings on this to really wrestle with some of the
issues that have come up.
If, uh, folks haven't read the memo, it really
summarizes very long discussions, and points out the
issues that this council has also wondered about is, as
one of the authors of a Policy Order, that was one of the
first on the table to say, let's examine and consider
having eliminating single family only zones throughout
the city.
This is exactly the kind of discussion we need to
have to move forward. Even though I'm not on the Housing

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Committee, I think very much it makes sense to forward
this to the housing committee to have a robust
discussion.
And as I believe Councillor Simmons and others have
84
Packet Pg. 840

5

pointed out, this memo asks the council for more
direction saying, "We've discussed this and we need a
little more, uh, specificity around what it is that your

together can consider what kind of zoning changes we
might want to bring forward."
But I'm excited to be moving it forward. Glad that
this has now summarized some of the questions before us,
and I hope that we can relatively soon turn this into
zoning language so that we can, uh, have a zoning that
reflects more of our goals and aspirations for city that
is less exclusive than our history has shown in--up until
this day and even now. Thank you. Uh, I yield, Mayor
Siddiqui.

Um, people have said tonight that, uh, a number of
us, if not all of us, sign the pledge, but when you get
more information and you learn more about the
circumstances, um, all of us do what we feel is right.

Councillor Quinton Y. Zondervan - Yes

full build, or whatever the term is, full construction.
Central Square has Western Avenue and River Street with
full construction coming into Central Square, which,
correct me if I'm wrong, is understudy, and I can't
89
Packet Pg. 845

5

believe it will get anything but full construction.
Kendall Square piece by piece, and Volpe will be
part of this, will have more and more full construction.

construction.
Granted it doesn't go all the way to Lechmere, but
the developer at Lechmere Square sites on both sides
Monsignor or O'Brien and Cambridge Street, um, will
certainly have full construction just because of the
necessity of being on a highway. Inman Square, the heart
of it is full construction.
So the only area that isn't is the poor stepchild of
Porter Square. And if you've been through Porter Square
lately, you will notice that approximately half the
buildings are closed.
Um, Porter Square, like everywhere else, has Amazon
to fight, has COVID. And now if this plan goes forward,
we're gonna move on street parking on both sides of the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Lechmere has 1st Street with the shopping center, full

we're gonna do it, we should do it right about the whole
system. And I know we can't afford all that, or we want

could die. We have to do your heart work first." To me,
that's the catenary. And then you do your hip. That's the
bicycle system.
And that's why I felt this is not holistic planning.
It's planning that's done as quickly as we can. And I get
that we forced that on the city, but it was an un--it was
an unknowing move on our part.
We had no idea what the plans would be. We had no
idea about the catenary restrictions with the fire

department. This is a different issue, and I realize that
most of the people that spoke tonight were for the
bicycle system going ahead.
But if you look at the emails, you will see that

it's a different story. It's at worse, 50:50 if not more,
in favor of doing this in the right way, in a more
thoughtful way. And that is pausing until the catenary

And then at least you have parking on one side of
the street for part of Porter Square, which is all
occupied except for one shop. And it won't be if we
decide to give it Amazon COVID and taking the parking
away.
Now, as an urban designer, I truly believe the
future is less cars. I truly believe that. Every urban
design plan I do has a bicycle system incorporated into
it, and removes parking lots wherever possible. But if
you do it this way, for sure, Porter Square is gonna be
in trouble even more.
We say one of our priorities is small business.
We're forgetting about it. I'm asking for a compromise.
We're asking for a compromise. I'll stop there. Oh, well,

um, policies.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, well, first of all, I just want to, uh, thank, uh,
uh, Councillor Carlone, and Councillor Simmons for, uh,

with me. Um, I know there are a lot of people watching,
and I want to make it clear, uh, a couple of things.
First of all, many residents may not, uh, understand
that, uh, as councillors, we can't talk to more than
four, uh, people, or we'll be violating the public
meeting laws.
So I was unable to talk with all my fellow
councillors about the rationale behind these Policy
Orders. But I do want to make it clear that, um, I don't
think I or anybody else, uh, that participated in these
Policy Orders is trying to delay or stop, uh, bicycle
lanes.
Uh, the reality is, is I got elected, uh, not
signing the pledge. And the reason I didn't sign the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

co-sponsoring, uh, these policy, two Policy Orders, uh,

pledge was not because I'm opposed to bike lanes.
I just felt that the constraints, uh, that are in
the ordinance, like these timelines and, uh, you know,
uh, the methods by which we can use to install bike
93
Packet Pg. 849

5

lanes, uh, really, uh, you know, ties us up in knots and
makes it more difficult to, uh, come up with a better
plan, uh, in each of the neighborhoods as we go forward.

My intention, since getting on the council, has been
trying to fix things, uh, as they go through, as I've
been working in North Cambridge to try to restore some
parking there. Uh, and here I was trying to get ahead of
the game.
And mainly, uh, from the presentation, uh, at our
last City Council meeting, we heard that, you know, if we
don't remove the catenary wires, um, first, uh, we are
gonna see significant, if not 90% of the parking removed
as a result, because we won't be able to meet, uh, the
requirements, uh, on Mass Ave, uh, meter parking on Mass
Ave.
Uh, and I just feel that the cabinetry wires, um,
you know, we should have them removed and that we should

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So my intention is certainly not to delay anything.

put every effort behind forcing the--the MBTA.
And if they won't do it, we should do it. Everybody
talks about all the resources we have here in Cambridge.
Well, I'd like to submit some of those resources,
94
Packet Pg. 850

5

removing the catenary wires as soon as possible, and then
getting the MBTA to, uh, reimburse us forward.
I actually see this somewhat, uh, similar to the

quad, uh, by-- by placing the moratorium, it forces all
parties to work quickly and, uh, fast to, uh, try to
address the zoning issues in the quad before we move
forward.
So, uh, similar, uh, tactic, uh, and I just want to
read, uh, a brief statement, uh, about, uh, my intentions
on both Policy Orders and then, uh, revert back to you,
Madam Mayor.
Um, so the intention of these Policy Orders is to
ensure the catenary wires come down before we begin
constructions and implementation of the Mass Av4, both
sections of Mass Av on either side of, um, Porter Square.
Uh, something that everyone on this council has said
that they want, uh, to do, and even, uh, bicycle

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

moratorium that folks, uh, advocated for on the Alloy

advocates have said that they want to see this happen.
If the wires are not removed, it was stated at the
last meeting that we will lose all on street metered
parking. Even if the category wires are removed, we will
95
Packet Pg. 851

5

lose 50% of, uh, the parking. At least, uh, that's the
estimate.
I have not asked for an extension of the timeline.

-the original plan. Uh, I've not asked it to be moved
beyond 2026.
I'm simply asking that we have the catenary wires
removed so that the people in, uh, in the neighborhood
can be assured that they're gonna hold onto some of their
parking.
Uh, this should not be an issue. Uh, I filed it
because many businesses and residents have absolutely no
faith in this council, the city manager or staff, to
complete this partial construction project and protect
the--the 50% of parking that they're gonna need to rely
on for their businesses, uh, to survive and residents to
be able to, uh, you know, uh, live in the area.
Uh, they want a commitment from us. At the very

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

It is still currently set for 2026. That's what's in the-

least, the city will remove the catenary wires and
pressure, uh, the MBTA, uh, to remove them quickly so
that we can hold on to, uh, some of the--the parking.
As for Policy Order #6, I certainly do understand
96
Packet Pg. 852

5

why, uh, some folks would not be supportive of it.
Um, I am asking, uh, for us, uh, in Porter Square
rather than to do the quick build, to actually, again,

has pointed out, it will allow us to save some parking.
And I think we, the goal is to do it once and do it
right.
Um, I realize it will not be done as quickly as a
quick build. Um, but I'm hoping that we can get those
catenary wires down as quick as possible. I'd like to do
it tomorrow.
Um, and then immediately we could start Porter
Square and do them first in terms of a partial
construction build.
So, I just wanted people to understand, uh, where
I'm coming from. I don't see why we would want to disrupt
the Porter Square neighborhood twice in a short period of
time, doing a quick build, and then as soon as the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

get rid of the catenary wires as, uh, Councillor Carlone

catenary wires come down, tearing--tearing up the quick
build and doing it again.
Um, I think we all want to see people safe and, you
know, I certainly want, um, do not want to see any, uh,
97
Packet Pg. 853

further injuries, uh, in Porter Square.
Um, and you know, I think we all have the best
intentions, uh, in doing this work. Um, so I will yield

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Fabulous. Thank you.

Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to thank my
colleague, Councillor Toner and Councillor Carlone, for
coming together on this particular Policy Order.
I do not have much to say beyond what has already
been said by my colleagues, Toner and Carlone. So I'm
gonna keep my remarks brief and to the point.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

there, uh, Mayor Siddiqui, and, uh, turn it back to you.

I do not believe that there's anyone in this
council, in this government, or in this community you can
honestly state that they feel that the process of
creating an interconnected network of separated by a
98
Packet Pg. 854

5

claim throughout our city, uh, is the wrong thing to do.
Uh, there has been some discussion and some very
strong feelings about hasn't been planned wisely or

And this is really not about, um, pointing fingers
or stating blame, it's about here we are a very important
juncture in this process where we have the needs of
different parties that we have to try to balance.
And I often say, how do we get to that unhappy
medium where everyone's not gonna get all over they want,
but we're going to try to find some balance so that
riders can ride safely, business owners that have been
knocked on their knees by COVID can get back on their
feet.
And of course, pedestrians are very much important
to the pedestrian, uh, group are our senior citizens and
people that are physically challenged.
I'm not gonna get into some of the things that I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

adequately, or explained properly, or executed properly.

heard this evening, 'cause I know we all feel very
passionate about this issue.
But we also have to just take a moment, pause and
think about how do we get to a happy medium or unhappy
99
Packet Pg. 855

5

medium, and understand that it's not that everyone's
gonna get everything that they want, but we have to try
to do the best we can for all, not just bicycle, but for

business owners, not pedestrian business owners, for
people that are physically challenge. And I could go on.
And I also feel strongly that I, you know, and I do,
I hold two different views at once. I know Cambridge need
to continue moving forward in establishing the city-wide
bicycle safety network.
And two, that we need to allow more time to make
sure that we do it the right way. And I think what
Councillor Toner has really done is really taken the time
to talk to people and walk those street and engage
people. I just listened to Councillor Carlone, who gave a
thoughtful treaty about why we one is just that let's do
this right.
You have heard me say this often, we can do the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

pedestrians, not just for pedestrians, but also for

right thing the wrong way. You also know that haste makes
way.
So it--it means that anything that is done in a rush
is likely to lead to mistakes, misstep, headaches, and
100
Packet Pg. 856

5

having to go back and do it again.
Tonight, Cambridge has the opportunity to pause in
course creating, to get this done, and to do it right. To

So thank you, Councillor Toner, thank you,
Councillor Carlone, for signing on to the Policy Orders
to giving us. Um, I'm certainly pleased to have joined
you in an opportunity to do the right thing.
I've said many times over the two decades of serving
the council that I did not run for the district to take
easy votes or win popularity content.
I'm here to vote my conscience, and I do what I
think is in the best interest for the community. And I
believe voting in favor of these two Policy Orders is
ultimately the right thing for this community, our
community. I urge my colleagues to support these orders.
Madam Mayor, I thank you, and I yield the floor.

Thank you. Pleasure of the

City Council discussion on the Policy Orders, Councillor
Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, and through you. I do have a couple of questions
101
Packet Pg. 857

5

for the staff.
Um, so I guess one question I have is why do we have
to do the partial build? In other words, could we do a

partial build?
Because, you know, we had this conversation a couple
of weeks ago and the council decided we're gonna go with
the partial build. I didn't agree. I still don't agree.
But you know, that's what the council's doing.
But now if we're opening this up, I would like to
understand why we're doing it that way and could we do it
as a quick build and then partial build.
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Um, through you Madam Mayor. Um,

I will start and then maybe Joe would like to fill in as
well. Um, so we certainly could, and that's what we
talked about last time is continuing forward with the
quick build now and then as part of MassAve4, look at
those other sections of Mass Ave, including Porter Square

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

quick build now and then in a couple of years do a

and the outer section that aren't technically part of
Mass Ave, but the MassAve4.
But if we're coming back and doing, you know, the
partial build, we could look at these sections. Um, so
102
Packet Pg. 858

5

that's one piece of the answer.
The other piece of the answer that I just want to
um, sort of talk through a little bit is that, you know,

understanding what sort of trigger's more complicated
median removal versus what's more straightforward, we've
also taken a closer look at Porter Square.
And what you'll find is that many sections of the
median were reconstructed, you know, 15, 20 years ago
when we did construction in Porter Square.
So from Beach really to Upland was reconstructed at
that point. And many sections of the median were not
reconstructed.
And so those areas in the--in between Beach and
Upland where you have the median, those are really there
because they're at crosswalks, they're at where traffic
signal equipment is located.
Those sections of the median are really there for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

since we've been looking at the MassAve4 and

very specific reasons. And so those aren't sort of quick
to sort of undo.
Having said that, we also took a closer look at the
median between Upland and Roseland, which was not part of
103
Packet Pg. 859

5

that earlier project, um, to try to understand is there
something we can do as sort of, uh, even a mini partial
build, right? Like something we could do pretty

And again, these are all very fluid conversations,
and so I know it can be really challenging 'cause you
know, as we look at it, we're coming up with sort of
different answers based on what we've learned.
And so when we looked at the medium between Upland
and Roseland, the two ends that are right at the
intersections are at the crosswalks. And so they provide
pedestrian benefits and they also have traffic signal
equipment on it.
But the median in between is about a little over 400
feet long. And so what we, and we have--there's a meeting
tomorrow night to really talk through the Porter Square
details on the project.
And so we're gonna put out there one option, it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

immediately to support implementation of the quick build.

would be to remove that section of median now, um, even
on the quick build timeframe for this summer. And so that
would give us more flexibility in terms of what we do
there.
104
Packet Pg. 860

5

And so, 'cause I think, you know, one of the things
about the parking is, you know, the catenary wires affect
the type of parking and we can talk more about sort of

as we've been implementing these sections.
And so we've also been working with, and the mayor
mentioned the letter that was sent from the mayor and the
city manager to the MBTA to really continue to really
highlight the importance of removing the Catenary.
'Cause again, it gives us more flexibility in terms
of the types of parking we can do. Um, and so we're
working closely with the MBTA, they have their survey
data and are really looking at the design of removing the
wires, and then at a subsequent point, also the poles and
certainly understand the criticality of this Porter
Square section.
So I don't have a definitive answer of this is the
date that they would remove them, but they are working,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the fire department and how that conversation has changed

um, incredibly hard internally to understand how best to
remove them, if they can do it with their internal power
department, if they can do it with an in-house contractor
that they already have on board to really understand what
105
Packet Pg. 861

5

those options are.
And so we are making progress on the Catenary. I
don't have a definitive date of when it would come down.

more about the parking discussions,
JOSEPH BARR:

Um, sure. But also, uh, through you,

Mayor Siddiqui, uh, Councillor, were you also asking
about why we couldn't do the MassAve4 as a quick build?
Okay, so let me--let me come back to that. But I do want
to add on to what, um, Kathy just said.
In terms of the ability to remove that section of
the median or portions of the median between Upland and
Roseland in the short term, um, I think we've looked at
very, very quickly, so we're still kind of in the process
what we might be able to do with that space.
And I do think even with the catenary still in
place, it would give us the opportunity to look at, um,
either some, um, small, um, but potentially significant,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, I don't know, Joe, if you want to add a little bit

uh, bus priority or to look at parking or loading options
in that area.
And as we've done on, um, North Mass Ave as we've
proposed elsewhere in Porter Square, even with the
106
Packet Pg. 862

5

catenary in place, we've--we've have gotten agreement
from the fire department for, you know, loading, um, in
areas where there's catenary above because the duration

recently installed on North Mass Ave, sort of very
isolated, longer-term parking.
So, you know, having looked at that, again very
quickly, 'cause as Kathy said, this is all developing
very fluidly in--in real time.
We think that, you know, on balance we can
accommodate, um, in that area between Roseland and
Upland, um, some parking or some loading as well as being
able to preserve the valet parking area for the hotel
there, which has been a sort of, um, difficult issue to
resolve.
Uh, and so we do think that, you know, thankfully
with this ability to do that, um, quick, uh, removal,
relatively quick removal of the median that we should be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

of the stay for the vehicle isn't as long, and even as we

able to further improve the plan and we are planning to,
um, discuss that more, uh, at the community meeting that
we have tomorrow evening.
Um, but going back to the original question on the
107
Packet Pg. 863

5

MassAve4, I mean certainly we could do a quick build
there.
Um, it would be very, very impactful and we, you

about a year ago, um, looked at, you know, to look at
what it would--what the impacts of doing a quick build,
you know, for the entirety of the MassAve4 segments,
particularly the areas not in Harvard Square, but the
areas north of Waterhouse.
Um, and it's feasible to do, it just has, you know,
very, very significant parking impact. So I think we felt
pretty strongly that that was not something we wanted to
move forward with.
And that's what led to the subsequent study and
analysis, uh, you know, that led to the recommendation
that you have before you for the partial build.
So it is possible or it is feasible, but I think the
level of impact that it would have is such that we would

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

know, the intent of the report that we released just

not recommend, um, pursuing it, you know, as a quick
build in the short-term
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan?

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

108
Packet Pg. 864

5

Mayor, and through you. So I just want to read one
sentence from the Ordinance that says, "Some impacts to
motor vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss

traffic control devices separated bicycle lanes and or
quick build separated bicycle lanes cannot be installed."
So what I'm hearing is that you--you've determined
that there will be significant parking laws and the
council is saying, "Okay, well, we'll compromise and
we'll agree to a slightly longer timeline to allow you to
mitigate that."
I'm also hearing that we have very good traction on
getting these catenary wires removed regardless of these
Policy Orders.
And so I honestly don't understand why we're even
having this conversation at this point, because, you
know, we we're already compromising.
We're already agreeing to, despite what the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

shall not result in a determination that temporary

Ordinance says, allow a longer timeline, which is allowed
under the Ordinance, to mitigate some parking loss.
And yet we're being told that, you know, it's not
good enough, and that we need further delays in order to
109
Packet Pg. 865

5

make sure that the wires come down.
So, you know, I am a bit frustrated by all this. Um,
I can't wait to vote no on these Policy Orders, and I

project and I hope that we can move it along really fast
because as you've heard in public comment, people are
afraid for their lives and rightfully so. Thank you,
Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

We have Councillor Azeem.
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, first I have a question in a slightly different
direction and then getting back to the main topic.
Um, I saw in some of the slides presented, uh, to
um, to us that there was an option of like when we do
full reconstruction about having like bus rapid transit
in some pieces of it, I was wondering if we do the
partial reconstruction, is that like a down payment on
that if we wanted to do that in the future?

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

wish you a lot of luck and success with--with this

Or is it tangential in that like if we would have to
redo the streets again and so this wouldn't compliment
that?
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Um, through you, Madam Mayor.
110
Packet Pg. 866

5

So, you know, I'd say some of what we're doing with the
partial build is sort of a down payment, right? So you're
actively removing the median, you're making traffic

So some of those improvements, you know, would have
value for sort of if there was a full reconstruction in
the future. So there is some value there, you're not
gonna get the full value.
But the traffic signal work, the median removal,
some of the utility pieces we're gonna need to replace
some sections of water main.
So some of those pieces would be, you know, sort of
have long-term value that would go towards a full
construction project.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Wonderful, thank you. Um,

so now back to, uh, the main topic at hand, the Policy
Orders. Um, I was wondering, I know some of this is in
the packet that you gave us, but I just wanted to start

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

signal changes that support that in the future.

just so we have some common facts to bring out. If we
were to do a quick build, how long would it take and what
would it cost?
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Uh, sorry. Through you, Madam
111
Packet Pg. 867

5

Mayor. So the quick build, you know, we had put a rough,
um, I'm sorry, it's just been a while since I looked at
this.

sections of Mass Ave, um, sort of, so put the Harvard
Square piece to the side, but the two other sections, um,
you know, for quick build, we'd said, you know, one to
two years.
And again, I think a lot of that would be process in
terms of, again, the impacts are quite dramatic and so
there'd be a significant process associated with that.
Um, and we had just sort of said lower estimate and
said, you know, very ballpark under 2 million just
because again, we didn't really do a lot of design work
on the quick build.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Wonderful. And could I get

those same numbers, the time and cost for the partial
build?
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So for the MassAve4, so for the, like the two

Sure. So for the partial build,

um, we'd estimated four to six years, and, um, and
there's a timeline associated with that as well. And then
we're estimating about $40 million for the partial build.
112
Packet Pg. 868

5

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Great. And could you give

me the number of parking spots that would be roughly on
like the MassAve4, or like the segments affected?
Sure. So the existing parking

on, and again sort of putting Harvard Square to the side,
so it's sort of the MassAve2, um, there are about 260
parking, and again, this is very rough estimate, about
260 parking spaces and about 350 linear feet of loading
zones.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Councillor Azeem.
Um, and so of the 260

parking spaces, uh, so if we were to do, um, a quick
build, we'd lose the majority of those 90%, and if we did
a partial build, we would lose about half of them.
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Correct.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Great. Um, sorry, I have

to do some maths, so, uh, I'll yield at this time and
then come back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

KATHERINE WATKINS:

then Councillor Nolan, and then Councillor McGovern.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor, and through you. Um, I just had a quick question.
113
Packet Pg. 869

5

It came up during, uh, one of my colleagues talking that
they mentioned that uh, we shouldn't do the Porter Square
intersection twice that, you know, we should just do it

It would be too disruptive to do the quick build and
then go back and do a partial construction. I'm just
curious, you know, how easy would it be to take down a
quick build in that sec--in that 1,400 feet? What are we
talking about?
JOSEPH BARR:

Um, through you, Mayor Siddiqui. I

mean, it would, it's particularly if it's a--if it's a
year or two later and some of the materials are starting
to, particularly pavement markings are starting to wear
out and there's gonna be construction and um, you know,
there'll probably be some level of paving associated with
that, it's not a big deal, you know, to remove it later.

JOSEPH BARR:

I was just gonna say, through you,

Mayor Siddiqui, and some of the improvements might still
continue to have benefit.
Like we might not have to remove everything to put
in the partial build 'cause a lot of it would be, um, you
know, changes to the median, but maybe some of the
marketing stayed the same, the flex post stayed the same.
Um, and as Kathy mentioned in Porter Square
specifically, there are, you know, much of the median
north of Somerville lab has already been removed in
places where we think it was appropriate to remove during
that prior construction project.
So I don't know that the changes would be that
significant in terms of the design, but like we would be

that's not a big--big deal to make those kinds of

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Well, thank you, Madam

115
Packet Pg. 871

5

Mayor, and through you. So, and just moving on to the
MassAve4, thank you for answering.
I'm think a couple of my colleagues had asked the

support, I was two weeks ago, I'm in full support of the
partial, um, build option for MassAve4.
I think it's a real strong compromise to how quickly
we need to move while balancing the entrance of multiple
stakeholders who are involved.
Uh, and I'm not sure if I'll have another
opportunity to speak tonight. So I guess I'd like to just
say that I won't be supporting Policy Orders #3 or #6
this evening.
Um, you know, as one of the original co-sponsors of
the ordinance amendment in 2020, I have been a strong
supporter of the Cycling Safety Ordinance. Uh, but you
know, we heard from community members a really deep
desire to have more engagement opportunities, more

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

questions that I was thinking about, but I'm in full

community meetings, additional working groups, and
economic impact study.
We voted several weeks ago to delay this Porter
Square section to ensure for those meetings, to ensure
116
Packet Pg. 872

5

that the neighborhoods, um, the residents were all
brought into this conversation.
But the Porter Square intersection is one of the

comment tonight that it's not, it's certainly is.
While we tend to only hear about the deaths on our
streets, and we do see those ghosts bikes that those
deaths leave in their wakes, we rarely hear about their
near misses and the serious collisions that can leave
people injured for the rest of their lives.
I just want to report on some data The Mass
Department of Transportation reports that over the last
11 years, including Dr. Lavin's death, there have been 43
serious collisions, including six hit and runs in this
1,400 square or 1,400 feet of roadway.
And for the record, for those who call and say that
we're only doing this for the 5% of people who commute by
their bikes in Cambridge, we are actually doing this for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

most dangerous in the city. I know we heard a lot of

the over 50% of residents who bike at least once or twice
a month. That's a huge number.
So for folks who are saying 5% or 8%, it's just,
it's not true. Uh, those are--those are bike commuters.
117
Packet Pg. 873

5

And while we certainly should be able, should be
trying to be creating this infrastructure to make sure
that we increase that number, I really want us to think

And that's only our residents. It doesn't even
include those who bike through our city from other
communities. So Policy Order #6 seeks to further delay
this Porter Square intersection for many years when this
critical infrastructure needs to happen much more quickly
to protect cyclists.
There was a reason that this section was separated
from the MassAve4 in the Cycling Safety Ordinance. And as
a city, we need to move--moving forward with this section
without any further delays.
Policy Order #3 seeks to delay the rest of the
MassAve4 until the catenary wires are removed by the
MBTA.
These discussions, as mentioned earlier, as

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

about the over 50% of residents that cycle.

mentioned in the mayor's letter with the city manager,
those are underway. They're a top priority for our staff
and for our city.
And passing the PO quite frankly feels like we would
118
Packet Pg. 874

5

remove that leverage that the city has in place with the
current timelines.
The Cycling Safety Ordinance in these timelines were

majority of the members here tonight.
This isn't about pledges, it's not about politics,
it's about safety. And tonight and every time I will vote
for safety. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We have Councillor Nolan,

and then we have Councillor McGovern, and then I'll go
back to those who have spoken.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. I have a couple questions. Um, I know you
cover, uh, through you, Mayor Siddiqui, to the staff and
thank you very much for your letter to the MBTA.
But the first question is, I know we can't say for
certain what the best sense of timing of the catenary
wires, but do we have any information whatsoever that we

put into a place for a reason. We voted on them with the

can share with the public and with the council about that
decision?
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Um, through you, Madam Mayor.

So, um, you know, I would say that I've had extremely
119
Packet Pg. 875

5

positive conversations in terms of getting the right
people at the T very focused on this issue.
I don't have a, "We can do it, you know, by this

summer.
So this is not looking at a five year plan in terms
of the removal of the catenary. So it is in a timeframe
that is consistent with the other projects that we're
talking about.
And again, prioritizing this one section as opposed
to the entire system, which I'm also extremely committed
to. So it's, you know, it's managing the, this is
absolutely a priority, but we're also prioritizing the
full removal of the system.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, and thank

you, through you, the staff. And if the MassAve4 project
passes as proposed, so we have three things before us.

date." The conversations we're having are about this

One is the memo and then there's two separate Policy
Orders related to this.
I'm talking about, for now, the first, uh, memo
about the partial build. Um, does that give the city
120
Packet Pg. 876

5

enough flexibility to do comprehensive planning and a
better implementation?
Could you talk a little bit to that, 'cause I think

little bit more and understand that--that thinking about
how this moves us forward and that that does give you a
lot of flexibility in implementation?
KATHERINE WATKINS:

Sure. Through you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Um, you know, the timeline that we laid out for
both the Harvard Square sections as well as, you know,
the other two MassAve2s, um, so the MassAve4, you know,
really has a timeline that is one allows us to coordinate
with all the utility work that needs to happen, both our
work as well as private utility company work.
And it allows us, you know, we've included a pretty
long, um, design process just given the complexity. And
then we're also coordinating it with other constructions.
So we're looking at, you know, how this lines up

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that was in the--in the memo and I just wanted to hear a

with other construction, particularly in Harvard Square.
So, but each of the ones, you know, has a
substantial design process associated with them, both for
the Harvard Square as well as for the--the, you know, the
121
Packet Pg. 877

5

catenary and um, median sections
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. So that

another one last question.
If Porter Square would be part of the MassAve4
partial build, would we be able to install the number of
miles that is specified this year in the Ordinance?
JOSEPH BARR:

Through you, Mayor Siddiqui. Um, I

think if--if we were to stop work on Porter Square and
then, you know, move it into the MassAve4, we don't
really have another project teed up or queued up to be
able to start working on to get done this year.
So I think in the totality of the entire ordinance,
obviously we would still aim to get to the--the goal, but
in terms of this year/next year and--and keeping up with
the pace that we're asked for in the ordinance, I think
it would be challenging and or not possible really to get

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

gives you the timing for the flexibility. And then

there given that, you know, we've already invested a
significant amount of time and--and frankly money in the
design work for Porter Square.
And again, that won't--that's not lost in the sense
122
Packet Pg. 878

5

that we could then put that into the--the work that the
TDBW is doing, but in terms of keeping up with the
mileage goals, I think it would be not possible to-- to

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Um, this

is really difficult because of all these challenges that
everyone's been working on, and it's understandable.
And I have to say that people I respect and people
in this community feel so passionately and are both sides
of this, are all sides of this. And there's--and I
respect deeply all of those conversations.
And the real question is what is best for the city
and to be a leading city. And this is not about a delay,
it's about how we do it well.
So I think that now thinking about the two, um,
Policy Orders, it really is a deep sense of civic duty
that led Councillors Toner, and Carlone, and Simmons, um,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

do that for this year.

to bring these forward.
And on first read, I thought, "Well, this makes a
lot of sense that all this does is say we are going to
make sure that we are living up to the promise of not
123
Packet Pg. 879

5

doing the work until the catenary wires come down and
that Porter Square should be part of MassAve4." Which
makes, still makes some sense to me.

the council messed up to some extent the implementation,
and communication, and inclusion, and planning around
this.
We did not do our job when we passed this of
communicating clearly and reaching out very specifically
to a number of people who were involved.
An example is, while working with it and you know,
Councillor Toner's worked very hard and brought back some
of the parking on the Northern Mass Ave, that should have
been there from the beginning.
And it wasn't, and it's really because many of us on
council asked for it. But Councillor Toner went out and
had lots of meetings and that is now far, far improved.
We also initially, because they hadn't been

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And I also in this context, see that the city and

anticipated on that section of the Northern Mass Ave, had
no handicapped spots, which then this council, I brought
it forward and said we need to do that.
So those kinds of changes do lead to a really deep
124
Packet Pg. 880

5

fundamental mistrust of the city, of us moving forward,
which I totally get.
Um, we promised an economic impact study, which is

haven't, we only passed it a little while ago. The
stakeholder group is just being set up.
There are businesses, including many BIPOC
businesses who have begged us to really think about
delaying this.
And I will say the climate issue, I completely get,
obviously it's the thing I feel like we should pay more
attention to, but passing this will literally do nothing
in and of itself unless we reduce the number of cars on
our streets.
Even if we increase the number of cyclists, which is
a positive benefit in and of itself, if we don't also
reduce the number of cars, we have literally done nothing
for the planet and we need desperately to do both,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

not done yet 'cause it can't be done yet because we

increase the number of cyclists and reduce the number of
cars.
Um, and we--our own data shows that the usage hasn't
gone up that much. While it goes up high in percentage
125
Packet Pg. 881

5

terms, it was pretty minimal when we actually did include
several separated language, which I use regularly.
I use the, um, Harvard Square Brattle Street one and

all the time.
Um, so we really, we will have failed if we don't
focus very deliberately on that. And yet my vision for
the city is for us to be a model, and if we delay this
and if we don't move forward, it will be very problematic
and very challenging for us not to be a model and to live
up to those goals.
So we have, I could argue, I went back today, I
convinced myself five times that I had to support the
Policy Orders and I convinced myself five times that I
couldn't possibly support them.
And when I really come down to say, I won't be
supporting the Policy Orders because I think it will take
us away from focusing on what we actually need to do

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the--and the Mass Ave from Harvard Square to, uh, Kendall

next, which is shift as soon as possible to multimodal,
to increase cyclists, to make it safe for the network
across the city, and to decrease the number of cars going
across.
126
Packet Pg. 882

5

And I say that with a heavy heart because so many
people are counting on us and think that we have not done
our jobs here, which I think that's true.

city, and I think what's best for the city is for us to
actually move forward with these, um, with this, uh,
cycling ordinance as much as we can and improve it along
the way.
So that's what, um, I'll be doing supporting the
partial construction and not supporting the other, um,
Policy Orders. I yield, Madam Mayor
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Um, so I just, I want to thank everybody, um, who
participated and commented, you know, tonight and--and
also through the, I would say roughly 6,000 emails we
received over the weekend.
Um, and I really, I got to say, I was saying this to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And yet I think I come down to what's best for the

Councillor Nolan earlier that in my whatever years,
however many years I've been doing this, I can't really
think of an issue that I have seen so equally divided.
For every email we got that said delay, we got an
127
Packet Pg. 883

5

email that said don't. And um, and in fact, I talk to two
people this weekend who live in the same house and they
feel differently about this issue.

remember that no matter where we stand on this issue, we
are a community and I hope that we can disagree without
assuming the worst and those, uh, who feel differently.
Um, you know, I may not agree with my three
colleagues who sponsored Policy Orders three and six, but
I don't think that they had bad intentions.
I don't think they want people to get hurt. Um, I
don't think they, you know, don't care about safety. We
just have arrived at a different conclusion.
Um, and this is a complicated puzzle. We want safe
streets, we want to minimize parking laws, we want to
support businesses. We don't want increased traffic.
But the reality is there is no way to get all of
what we want, even with the wires in the median being

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And--and I really say that because I do want us to

removed, and no matter how long we take discussing it,
the street is simply just so wide.
So something has to give. Um, and that's why I do
support doing whatever we can to minimize parking loss by
128
Packet Pg. 884

5

putting meters on side streets, which in and of itself is
controversial.
There's a lot of folks who say, "I support

meters on my street either." Uh, but I think that's a
necessity.
Um, and then I do support Councillor Toner's, uh,
you know, the way he's been trying to get the city to
move towards renting parking spaces. I think those are
mitigation measures that we should do.
Um, but I do have a couple questions, Madam Mayor,
through you. Um, so through you to Mr. Barr, and I will
for full transparency, we did discuss this earlier, but I
want to discuss it in public.
So data can be looked at differently, and we've
heard people look at the data around Porter Square
differently tonight.
Um, but just in terms of city data, is it fair to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

businesses, don't take parking away, but don't put any

say that for cyclists Porter Square is one of the most
dangerous intersections in the city?
JOSEPH BARR:

Um, through you, Mayor Siddiqui, yes,

I think that's an--that's an accurate statement. And as
129
Packet Pg. 885

5

you said, there's been different ways of looking at the
data, but if you look at the information in the city's
bicycle plan, which is kind of what we consider to be our

really all up and down Mass Ave, but certainly in Porter
Square.
Um, and really going back to the very first project
I ever worked on in this job was looking at Inman Square
and Porter Square and a couple of other locations for
safety issues.
And, you know, the Inman Square led to what you see
going on in Inman Square, Porter Square, we were able to
do some changes, but we always felt like there was more
that needed to happen.
And so I think what we're doing with the project we
have ongoing now is really trying to get at the issue
you're raising of it continuing to be, you know, one of
the more dangerous locations in the city.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

official reference, you can see clusters of crashes

Thank you. And just,

I'm sorry, I should have been more clear on that. I'm
talking about that 1,400 foot stretch of, you know, sort
of Porter Square proper, not the MassAve4, but just sort
130
Packet Pg. 886

5

of that Beach to Roseland.
Um, and so the second question, and you talked a
little bit about this tonight, um, and I know you can't

you did MassAve4, you looked at parking removal ratios,
right?
With the wires coming--the partial rebuild with the
wires coming down and the median coming out. If we sort
of use that ratio to look at Porter Square and that 1,400
feet, um, we're likely, even with the median coming out
and the wires coming down, we're looking at losing
probably close to 50%, give or take, of parking--of those
34 parking spaces. Is that fair to say?
JOSEPH BARR:

Through you, Mayor Siddiqui. Yes, I

think that's accurate. I don't have exact number, but
that's a good. I think the--the work for the MassAve4
gives us a good estimate of what we would likely be able
to preserve, what we're able to do something similar.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

say exactly, um, but if we were to apply, you know, when

Councillor McGovern?

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Yep. Thank you. So in

essence, what we're talking about is that, you know,
right now if a quick build, we're talking about 34
131
Packet Pg. 887

5

parking spaces being removed, but if we wait and we do
this all together, 2026, and wait those four years for
this to happen, we're really potentially talking about

So in essence, we're talking about 17 parking
spaces. And so just now I want to explain how I reach my
decision so people understand. You know, I asked myself
two questions.
The first was, do I think Porter Square, the Porter
Square intersection is safe? And then the second question
was, what do we gain by a delay? And the answer to the
first question is, no, I don't believe the Porter Square
intersection is safe.
The data shows that, and the data doesn't even
include, and I talk about this often when we talk about
stop signs and whatnot, we don't ever, we can't ever
gauge near misses, right? Because they never get
reported.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

only regaining 17 spaces, give or take, one or two.

So we, even the data we do know, we know it's not
safe. And then we hear constantly about near misses that
happen that only reinforce the fact that it's not safe.
So the answer to my first question is, I do not believe
132
Packet Pg. 888

5

the Porter Square intersection is safe.
The next question is, what do we gain by a delay?
And based on our earlier conversations and what you said

the median when it comes to parking, which seems to be
the number one concern, we're only talking about saving
17 out of 34 spaces.
So what I'm being asked, and let's make no mistake,
this is a delay. I mean, it says right in the--it says
right in both Policy Orders to not move forward with the
quick builds until certain things happen, potentially
dragging it out to 2026.
Um, so basically, I'm being asked, we are being
asked to vote in favor of keeping one of the most
dangerous intersections in the city, dangerous in hopes
that we can save 17 parking spaces.
And I hate to sort of break it down to that level,
but those are the numbers. Um, and that's just something

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

tonight, a delay in taking down the wires and taking out

I can't, I can't do.
Um, I do support doing everything we possibly can to
mitigate parking loss. Meters on side streets, we need to
spend the money to rent spaces, right? And--and we can
133
Packet Pg. 889

5

get into that.
I know there's some legal haggles there, but I'm not
sure I agree with those. But, you know, whatever--um,

end of the day, for me to vote to delay this quick build
in Porter Square proper, we're not talking the rest of
it.
That's a different conversation, um, would me
actively voting to keep a dangerous intersection unsafe
in hopes that more time will lead to saving 17 parking
spaces? Give or take a few?
And, you know, I can't--I can't do that. I can't
hold my breath for the next four years hoping that
someone else doesn't get hurt.
Um, there's a difference between actively voting to
delay something that you know might be a danger, right?
And that's what we're being asked to do.
And I know it's not the intent of the--I mean, I've,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

this is not an anti-parking crusade for me. But at the

I know that everyone cares about people being safe, and
the Councillor's response to this absolutely do. This is
not--this is just how I reach my decision.
And for me, it was an issue with safety and I can't
134
Packet Pg. 890

5

support delaying an unsafe intersection, um, for what
would amount to be a number of years for minimal change
in what's before us today.

and #6, but I do pledge, um, you know, to do everything
that I can to, um, try and, you know, mitigate the
parking loss. And I do want to just say lastly, Madam
Mayor, thank you for the time.
Um, I do really hear the concerns of seniors and
folks who are concerned about not being able to park in
front of their, um, you know, in front of their doctor's
offices.
That's a, you know, my mother is partially
paralyzed, but she can still drive. To ask her to walk
three blocks to a doctor is not an gonna be an easy thing
for her.
Um, so when we're discussing where to save spaces
and where to take spaces, I hope we really prioritize and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So, um, I will be voting no, uh, on Policy Orders #3

keep into consideration those folks who are gonna need
those spaces the most.
Um, if we had a choice between four spaces in front
of Dunking Donuts or four spaces in front of a doctor,
135
Packet Pg. 891

5

maybe we go with the four spaces in front of a doctor.
Um, so I do really hear that, but at the end of the
day, I can't vote to keep an unsafe situa--uh,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor

McGovern, who we've heard from five of our colleagues. I
know, Councillor Carlone, you had your hand up, so I'll
allow you to respond.
I know that I think Councillor Toner's hand up and I
know that Councillor Azeem would like to go, and then I
can go.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

I'll try to be quick.

Uh, councilor, my fellow councilor, well he came back,
um, mentioned that the wires wouldn't, I think you were
inferring the wires wouldn't be enough. That's enough.
I'm actually, that's what I'm asking for in waiting
is for the wires and that we plan it that way, whether,
hopefully it's the summer so that it isn't 17 parking

spaces, it's seven storefronts, seven businesses that, as
I said, will be dead.
There is a restaurant plant, two restaurants want to
open up. They have spoken to a number of us. They're not
136
Packet Pg. 892

5

gonna move forward if there's no parking in Porter
Square. We might say that's ridiculous, but the point is,
it's a tough time.

Six months, I'm thrilled. Build it. Even the short-term
solution. It's a short-term solution. It isn't just
spilled quickly.
Number one, the original schedule was
unimplementable. We've proven that. It takes much more
work. Now, I think part of that is we didn't know, we
couldn't say how much time is needed.
How are you going to work with neighbors? How are
you gonna work with business? We had none of that,
because I assumed like everybody else there was time and
that that would be working out fine.
And it's not the phasing that's the problem, it's
the loss of parking. Yet another nail in the retail
coffin in Porter Square. And so there's--why does this

So the wires come down in four months. I'm thrilled.

have to stop at Beach? Why can't it stop at Davenport
avoiding those businesses?
I get Porter Square. I totally agree. Porter
Square's a mess for traffic. Too much is happening there,

But why not stop at Davenport Street and save that
block and allow those businesses at least a little more

the ropes now.

talking about traffic and, excuse me, traffic and design.
JOSEPH BARR:

I mean, I guess the, but the reason

why we're doing this segment from Beach to Roseland is
because that's what's required under the ordinance.
It's also logical in terms of, you know, relatively
major street crossings where the transitions would make
sense.
Um, but were it not for the ordinance, we would--we
would have a little bit more flexibility of where it
stopped and started. But I think that the stretch we're

I would also just say that between Davenport and
Allen Street, we are including a load, you know, a I

removed, um, could become, you know, we have to look at
what makes more sense loading or parking, but could

So I think we are, we are open to that. And we do
have space even under the current plan that we'll be,
we've discussed before, and we'll be discussing tomorrow
night to provide some parking/loading in the area north
of Davenport.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you. But what I'm asking is, maybe I
should be--I have to be more direct. The danger zone is
primarily at the intersection and the shopping center,
and then from Davenport on, or Allen Street on it is a
different animal. Is that correct?
JOSEPH BARR:

Um, through you, Mayor Siddiqui, I

don't have the--the crash, um, map in front of me, but I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

do, my memory of it is there are crashes all up and down.
I mean, really all of Mass Ave. That's why Mass Ave is
given a higher priority.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

But we're talking

139
Packet Pg. 895

5

about more difficult area versus a less difficult area to
traverse. That's all I'm saying.
Instead of Beach being the end, save these

that's all I'm suggesting here is consider that.
And finally, in the end, this is not a yes or a no
situation. Very few situations we deal with are, it's in
between. Is it 80%? Is it a 100%? That's all we're asking
for, is to make, to look at the bigger picture and still
promotes safety.
I was one of the only people that promoted public
safety when a restaurant was causing enormous smoke
inhalation in a neighborhood, uh, I don't know, six years
ago I think it was.
Um, so I'm big--that's what urban design is, but
it's also balance on impacts. I'll stop there. Thank you,
Madam Mayor.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I'm exhausted by the number of times we have the same
conversation here in City Hall. Let's start at the

So, Mass Ave is dangerous. People have died in the
sections that we are talking about tonight. I personally
have seen people get injured.
What's etched in my brain is last September 26th at
1:03 PM when I was biking, and the person right in front
of me was hit, fell to the ground, and an ambulance was
caused because his head was injured.
I myself have been doored on this section, and I
have jeans with holes in them teared into them because of
the dangers of this piece. You know, we think about like
bicycle safety as like a fringe issue, right? Like it's
not actually that dangerous.
You can go on the CDC website and see that the
leading cause of death among young people, ages of five

to 29 is motor vehicle accidents.
If you have an eight year old, the leading cause of
death is that they will get hit by a car. If you have a
teenager, the leading cause of death is that they will

get hit by a car.
If you are 25 years old, the leading cause of death
is that they will get hit by a car. If I die in the

on our streets and got hit by a car.
This is not a fringe issue, this is a leading public
health issue. Um, we ran on these issues. This was not a
minor issue during the last election.
It was clearly stated out who supported these bike
lanes, what that meant. The policy had already been
passed, and then a super majority, seven out of nine City
Councillors ran on implementing these issues.
And I get it, it was a complicated issue. We need to
have compromise. Every time we talk about bicycle safety,
we compromise. I have supported every study, every new
advisory group.
We have already broken the pledge. I have broken the
pledge by introducing a delay last time, which delayed

recent future, the most likely cause is that I was biking

the implementation of the Porter Square bike lanes to the
summer, even though knowing that the summer is when
there's highest--highest bicycle usage, when summer is
the place when most people use bicycles and are most

5

likely to get hurt.
And I not only voted for it, I didn't complain. I
defended the vote, and I never asked for anything in

and we do it happily. And the partial build itself is a
compromise.
Doing the quick build would be $2 million and take
one to two years. The partial build will take $40 million
and take four to six years.
That's adding two to four years of delay and $38
million in extra cost, which as other councillors have
said, could go to sewer separation, free tee passes, all
sorts of other things.
You know, I got the numbers from, uh, earlier. We
have 260 parking spots and 350 feet, at the average spot
of a parking spot being about eight feet. That's 43
parking spots.
If we're saying that, you know, this will save half

of that, that's about 152 parking spots at the cost of
$40 million minus the Harvard Square full construction,
you know, and you divide that by the number of parking
spots we're paying, we're paying about $200,000 for every
143

5

parking spot we are saving along this.
The new super high-rise that's going up in Kendall
Square with eight stories of underground parking is

We're paying double that to save 150 parking spots.
This is a huge compromise. And yet what I'm told is we're
being unreasonable not com--Every time we talk about
this, we are compromising.
And so I would say, like, you know, with that, and
then, you know, we are voting on this partial build,
which has already come up, introduced two more things
like, "Hey, even what you're doing now is not good
enough." When it will be good enough?
At some point, you just have to admit, you don't
want the bike lanes. You can't have, you know, I want
bike lanes, but we need X, Y, Z all the time and adding
one new requirement after another.
What you're doing is just doing this into infinity.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

paying half of that for these parking spots.

You know, we're talking about another four year delay for
the Porter Square timeline.
You know, someone mentioned is that, you know,
there's been three deaths in the last 10 years on this
144

segment. That's not too much.
Well, if you're talking about a four year delay,
just divide the numbers and you're talking about one

Not to mention all of the people that will get
injured during this section need to go to the hospital,
have permanent injuries. So that's why I can't support
these proposals tonight.
And if people don't want to support the partial
build, either because they think that there's a better
solution, I'd be happy to vote for no for it as well, and
see if we can really come up with a better solution.
Thank you. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor Azeem.

So I think we've heard, um, from everyone. Um, I will
briefly just say that, uh, last council meeting, as we
know, we had a substantial discussion, um, about removing
these wires and, uh, with the really a goal of getting a

commitment from the MBTA.
And as we've talked about this letter, which calls
for these immediate arrangements, um, you know, will
continue, my office, the city staff will continue to put
145
Packet Pg. 901

5

pressure on the MBTA and work really closely with them.
And I sincerely believe that we'll be able to move
forward, uh, with the plan that's more flexible once the

Um, I think while there's pressure on the MBTA,
there's, we have this time to ensure we're moving forward
with the plan that keeps much of the parking along Mass
Ave.
And I totally agree with Councillor Carlone and
others. I mean, what our small businesses are going
through and have gone through is we need to hear that,
and then we need to react and do everything we can to
mitigate. Um, and I hear that from city staff.
Um, and--and so I think I'm a 100% committed to
that. Um, I look at the 75 pages in our book, and I've
read through it a few times, and I think when I read it,
I see that we've had community engagement, we've had
planning over the past year, uh, and it's showed a lot of

dialogue that's taken place.
And it further does say pending City Council
approval, the MassAve4 segments will proceed into design
phase to determine the specifics. The community will have

And in the letter from the city manager, there was
a--there was input from businesses. There were--were a
lot of conversations. Can there be more? A 100%. Um, and
I see that continue, uh, I see that to be happening
continuously.
So, you know, I think I support, I was going to
support the order last week. I'm still going to support
it. I think three and six, Policy Orders #3 and #6
undermine what our goal there is.
And I think we have to move forward with the caveat
of there's so much work to be done, um, and safety is
paramount.
Uh, and I think there is a way to be working, uh,

April 12th, the Government Operations Committee met to
have a working conversation with the city manager and his
team to discuss the council's new role in approving
members to boards and commissions.
It was a productive conversation, and I want to
thank the committee members as well as the city manager
and his team for brainstorming some ways we could partner

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Denise E. Simmons - Yes

on developing new strategies to recruit candidates and
how to present those candidates, as well as some other
items related to boards and commissions.
This Policy Order put forward by the Government
159

Operations Committee members was generated from that
conversation, and lays out what was discussed.
Our hope is with this partnership between the

about what we'd like to see in boards and commission
appointments, and we can approve members when they get to
council.
So the Policy Order asks for developing a standard
operating procedure for recruiting candidates to boards
and commissions, which is better aligned with current
city staff recruitment, standard operating procedures,
including, but not limited to where to advertise for how
long and what languages, et cetera.
Also, developing a comprehensive strategy to provide
anti-bias training and onboarding to new boards and
commission members, as well as exit interviews to members
upon leaving.
Providing a report of boards and commissions that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

manager's office and the council, we can be very clear

currently have term limits where applicable and a
strategy for imposing term limits based on best
practices.
Developing a standardized presentation of
160
Packet Pg. 916

5

appointments and reappointments to City Council,
including, but not limited to the number of applicants,
length of opening, current demographic breakdown of the

cetera.
And exploring ways we can provide stipends to boards
and commission members. This is something that has come
up over and over a again, and we--and we really talked
about it at the government operations meeting.
Um, this is just asking that the city manager report
back to, uh, the City Council with ways that we can
provide stipends to boards and commission members,
particularly those who meet more regularly, like the
Planning Board and the Board of Zoning Appeals.
As well as lastly, providing a report on how boards
and commissions can meet the city's goals for diversity
and inclusion, while ensuring that any required
professional expertise and or specific knowledge that may

board of committee, where that outreach was done, et

be statutorily required will continue to be represented.
So it's our hope that with, um, this partnership
with the city manager's office and these reports and, and
working with them, that we will be able to exercise, um,
161
Packet Pg. 917

5

a greater responsibility over boards and commission
member appointments and reappointments.
As for the appointments that I pulled off the table

evening, they automatically go into effect. So we should
vote those up or down this evening.
Uh, it was really my hope and the committee's hope
to have that conversation before we were, um, to vote on
these appointments and reappointments, uh, and before
that they went into automatic effect.
So I'm hoping that we can move forward with these
appointments and reappointments tonight as we wait on,
um, the report back from the city manager and his team,
uh, on this new way of working together.
So, um, Madam Mayor, I'm not sure Mr. Clerk, how we
want to proceed with, uh, items four through 10 here, um,
as well as Policy Order #2.

all of these rules, these, uh, this new conversation in
place before this.
Many of the people I, uh, on--on the list are ones
who are--are folks whose backgrounds we have a little bit
of, but we don't have as much as I would hope and expect
to have in the future.
That being said, I think I would be, um, happy to
support these moving forward with the expectation in the
future.
We won't just be presented with this names, we'll
have a better sense of the process that went through it

about how they fill, um, the--the goals of the City

important role we can play to remind all of us, it was
74% of voters asked us to be involved in this and endorse

the idea that the council should have a role in these
very important boards and commissions coming before us.
So, uh, like the Vice Mayor, I am--I am grateful

of our colleagues. I hope that we can pass it.
And I also look forward to a time when that kind of
procedure will be in place, so that before we are asked
to vote on any, uh, uh, appointments to any board or
reappointments, we would have a fuller information
understanding of how they fit into the ecosystem, if you
will, of the boards and commissions of the city.

I'd asked the clerk, but it's not what he has to refile

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So, uh, just clarify the

Council to you. Mayor Siddiqui. So what's on the file is
the new refiled petition with all of the pages that it's
supposed to have. So that should be referred to the
Ordinance Committee and the Planning Board.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

I didn't know if he

had refiled. Okay.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

In the--in the existing

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

celebrating people being promoted and I congratulate all
of them.
But we have promotions in--in all of our departments
all the time, and I don't see why we need to highlight
promotions specifically in this department.
If we're gonna do it across all departments, then we
would be having lots of these resolutions every week.
So I'm not comfortable with that. I don't think we
should be doing that. So I'm gonna vote no on these, uh,
resolutions. Again, not because I don't, you know,
congratulate those folks, but because I don't think we
should be introducing individual promotions like this
resolutions for individual promotions like this for any
one particular department. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, and through you. I, um, just wanted to point out
that on our police department and all of these sergeants,
and congratulations to every one of them who--who have
made it to rank of Sergeant.
I think these are perfectly, uh, appropriate. There
are exams that are required for sergeants. Um, and so it-it is a big deal. It's not like just getting promoted,
um, in every department.
Certainly. I think this has always been, um, the way
that the council has handled promotions, uh, and the
police department.

congratulating any of our city of employees for

And, um, I mean, I'm certainly very happy to support
these this evening and--and make sure that, um, these
sergeants know that the City Council, um, appreciates
that they took this exam and were promoted and, um, that
175

they're providing a public service in our community. So
I'll be supporting these tonight. Thank you.
Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Uh, yes, thank you,

Madam Mayor. I certainly will be supporting these
resolutions, uh, for a few, for a few reasons. City
council, as we know through the charter, has very few
opportunities to delve into personnel matters.
And this is one of way that we can say out loud that
we are proud. We acknowledge this making this--making
this benchmark in your career.
Number two, particularly to sergeants. Sergeants are
probably the shorter patrol people. I don't want to say
patrolmen, patrol officers. Sergeants really know folks
in the community.
They are the ones that walk in the doors and
support, they support the staff under--that work under
them, but they also know the community that they're

support, uh, this part, particular resolution.

And if we want to change and make--make it that
every, um, advancement that an employee makes that we
know about, um, or should be told about so that we can't

'cause I certainly don't think we should get rid of that.
And that's a recognition that we all go to and
support. So I think it's important that we do this. I
hope that we continue this, and I want to thank
Councillor Toner for doing it. I, uh, yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Uh, thank you. Real

quick, um, Madam Mayor, you know, I do, um, uh, I will
support these, um, as I--as I always do.
Um, and I do think, you know, any councilor can
bring forward any resolution congratulating anybody for
their promotion who works for the city. And quite
frankly, I don't think we do it enough.
Um, it is meaningful to people. Um, you know, I know

acknowledge beyond the--the employee recognition. Um,

sometimes people look at these resolutions and for us, we
get them every week and we think, "All right, we'll just
pass 'em."
But it does mean something when the council

recognizes the accomplishments of people in our
community. Um, so, and as long as we don't pull them,
they don't take up any time.

do more of them. Um, and, uh, you know, Councillor Toner,
uh, beat some of us to the punch. But, um, happy to
support them and I hope we do more to congratulate our

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. So, just as a little background, in June of 2019,
the Cambridge Community Center had been planning to
expand their mental and behavioral services into an
unoccupied CHHA facility at 205 Western Avenue.
And after having gone through the, and receiving the
necessary zoning change from the BZA needed to occupy the
building for the summer, it was determined that the
elevator and the HVAC were not working, and the building
could not be occupied.
The Cambridge Community Center was working on an
expanded use and awaiting the city's response on how and
when the repairs would be made, and then the pandemic

So as we all know, the Cambridge Community Center
became the, uh, epicenter of a resilient response during
COVID-19, jumping right into action and opening a food

becoming a neighborhood resource, uh, resiliency.
In January of last year, they actually hired a full-

their young people and families since the onset of the
pandemic.
We've talked so many times in this room about the
need for mental health services for our young people, and
we have a program here with the Cambridge Community
Center ready to go. They just need the space, and we need
some clarity on whether or not they can occupy the
building at 205 Western for this purpose and whether or
not it's feasible.
We had several conversations with the city manager,
uh, and his team in the fall. I've not yet heard back on
the status of this building and whether or not it can be
occupied.

We know that these services were critical before the
pandemic and now, especially for our young people, um,
there just aren't enough services.
There aren't enough mental and behavioral health
services for our residents and our young people.
So I really hope that we can figure out, uh, whether
or not this building is habitable for the Cambridge

prioritize finding another space for, um, this really

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Policy Order

#4, that the city manager being hereby is requested to
confer the Department of Public Works and advise ways to

of trashcans to and to keep waste output low with the
rollout of the new bins in June. This was filed by
Councillor Nolan, myself, pulled by Councillor Azeem.
I'll go to Councillor Nolan first.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. This, uh, Policy Order relates to the exciting
news that we all heard about for many months about
standardizing trash bins, uh, across the city.
We had not been aware, as a council, about what the
sizes, that would be the default sizes. Those, uh, have
already been decided.
Um, some of us, myself included, think it would've-it might have been better to have the default size be
smaller than what is being proposed, for a few different

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

encourage residents to request the smaller size they need

reasons.
The city's Zero Waste Plan anticipates a reduction
in trash of up to 80% over the next 20 years. We've
already seen a, uh, very large reduction in trash up to
189
Packet Pg. 945

5

this point.
The last time a survey was done of, uh, trash
throughout the city, which was in 2018, it found that 75%

gallons of trash per household.
And yet the default for all households now for, uh,
one, two, and three families is the equivalent of 40 to
45 gallons per household.
So that really, uh, flies in the face of what we're
trying to send a message, which is everyone should be
reducing their waste.
And since the time that that trash, uh, survey was
done, we've introduced a textile recycling, um, option.
The curbside, uh, composting option has been spread
throughout the city and has now been in place for a few
years, and we're continuing to try to reduce.
So what this Policy Order does is not change the
default that's already out there. What it does is ask the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

or more of city residences had less than about 20 to 25

city to do, uh, to communicate to residents that if they
really believe they do not need this larger bin, which
presumably is for about half or--or at least half, if not
75% of residents, other than an occasional, if you have a
190
Packet Pg. 946

5

move out, you are gonna fill in more of a typical bin.
But we should not be basing our policies and sending
out across the city the message that it's okay to have

a year when, uh, folks may need more.
Uh, I did talk to DPW staff. They did explain how it
was that this was decided, and they also did confirm that
the--the city's own, uh, surveys had shown a much, much,
uh, reduced amount of trash per household.
So what this does is ask the city to let more people
know a little more aggressively about the availability of
an option for them to opt out of the standard default to
a still pretty large, but a 35 gallon, uh, bin
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Azeem, and then

Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Uh, thank you Councillor.

Um, thank you, Madam Mayor, and thank you Councillor
Nolan, um, for introducing this. Um, I'm supportive of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

this much, uh, garbage on the basis of, uh, once or twice

the measure. I just wanted to add a few thoughts and
comments that I heard from city staff and then, um, make
a statement.
One is that, um, you know, I think that, uh, I'm
191
Packet Pg. 947

5

certainly supportive of smaller bin sizes. I think that
Councillor Nolan is correct, and we had a small
conversation about this where, um, the 45 gallon one is

few times a year, you really need to go over the 20 to
30, which average is produced, and you need a place to
put that trash. And so that's why they were putting in
slightly bigger ones.
And the 65 gallons, uh, for larger households is
really meant because in larger households, you would
split the, uh, trashcan.
So not everyone would take the 65, but you would
have two 30s, uh, 30 gallons of waste for larger multifamily housing.
Um, I also just wanted to bring up that, you know, I
think that thinking about our Zero Waste Plan makes a lot
of sense, and we haven't revisited our trash ordinance in
20 years, and I know that's something that everyone wants

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

really meant for smaller households, where, you know, a

to talk about.
And so if there's any interest, I would be, uh, open
and interested in, uh, rethinking that and seeing how we
can update it. Thank you,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, and through you. Um, as the former chair of the

Zero Waste Plan with DPW every year. And I'm sure, uh,
Councillor Nolan will do the same as--as the current
chair.
Um, I too support this Policy Order, but I did want
to make a comment on it as well because, uh, you know,
I've, as people know, I'm into recycling and
environmentalism and all this stuff, and I keep a close
eye on our family household trash, and--and I can
honestly say that I've never been tempted to throw stuff
away because I have a bigger garbage can.
So, while I certainly understand the dynamics and
how all of that works, I don't think people are deciding
to, you know, how much trash they generate based on how
big their--their trash can is.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Health Environment Committee, we--we did review our, uh,

It's based on how much stuff we end up having to
throw away. And certainly having food waste pickup is fan
fantastic, and having some of these other options like
textiles is really great.
193
Packet Pg. 949

5

But the real problem is that when you buy something,
whether it's online or--or even in-person, too often it
comes wrapped in other stuff that you just have to throw

And so that's really the crux of the problem. It's
not how big the trash cans are. Also want to point out
that, you know, sometimes people forget to put out their
trash one week, or, you know, something happened and it
didn't get put on the curb.
And you want to make sure that they have enough room
in their trashcan to, you know, go another week without
the lid being propped open, because then that, again,
attracts rodents.
And even if your food waste is in a separate bin,
you still might be throwing away food packaging, which
smells like food and still attracts rodents and so forth.
So, I think, you know, the city's really doing a
great job with this bin rollout. I think it's fine to ask

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 25, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

away. There's no other, uh, option there.

them to communicate to residents that they can request a
smaller bin.
But, you know, again, I don't think that's
ultimately the--the real problem that needs to be
194

addressed.
And certainly, uh, happy to take Councillor Azeem up
on the offer to reexamine our waste ordinance and see if

these companies to reduce the amount of waste they end up
shipping into our homes. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

This young man, um, who took his life, uh, I think
we were in a meeting at the, uh, had a meeting getting
ready to start, and, um, actually drove by where he lay.
And it was, everyone was very, very taken.
He was such a young man and full of life and very
kind. And one has to ask, you know, what might have been
troubling himself.
But I put this order in not so much just to mark his
passing, but to honor his living. And so I hope my

but the important thing was here was a couple that were
just very dear.
And Barbara was a doctor. She, um, worked for
Cambridge Cares and the, um, a number other jobs. I just
can't recall at this moment.
I have to tell you, I was so shocked to my core to,
um, know that she has passed. It will leave a huge void
in the community, the LGBTQ community, the Cambridge
community, the medical community.
Um, arrangements have not been made, but I thought
it was important that we honor her living. Uh, this is my
new way of approaching these resolutions as opposed to,

Eric Grunebaum, 98 Montgomery Street, spoke in support
of the Alewife lab office moratorium to Vice Mayor Mallon
and City Council members.

He is a veteran of Friends of

Reservation, friends of Jerry's Pond and Alewife Working
Group. He thanked them for voting on March 9th to send the
zoning rezoning petition to the full council and requested
them to move the process forward as quickly as possible. He
also urged them to convene the working group and begin the
zoning process. Eric thanked the council for their renewed
attention to the Alewife area's revival and careful
planning and restoration. He mentioned the intense
development pressures in the area and expressed his support
for the Green New Deal for Cities Act.

PUBLIC COMMENT
Neil Rohr, 655 Concord Avenue, spoke during a meeting
regarding the Alewife zoning petition and urged the City
Council to move it to a second reading. He mentioned that
the issue first came up as a policy order almost six months
ago and was referred 7 to 0. He also noted that there were
five policy orders passed seeking information from either
the city manager or the community development department,
but none of that information had been forthcoming to his
knowledge. Neil expressed his frustration with the delay
and said that if he were on the City Council, he would be
up in arms and outraged. He requested the council to move
the petition to a second reading and thanked them for their

the Zoom. Neil Rohr, please go ahead. You have the floor.

Matt Lerner, address not provided, spoke about items 1
and 2 on the committee reports and requested that the City
Council consider an amendment to exclude the triangle from
the AOF moratorium. He mentioned that the anticipated
4
Packet Pg. 969

6

development in the triangle is different from that in the
quad, and there is no scarcity of housing in the triangle.
Lerner highlighted that the triangle district has

previous air life planning efforts, and the Envision Air
Life 2019 found it to be the most densely developed area in
Cambridge. He emphasized that the development pressures in
the triangle are vastly different from those in the quad
and that a pause in development is not needed.
Lerner's request to exclude the triangle from the
moratorium is not intended to suggest that the triangle not
be included in the study area or not be part of any
rezoning. He expressed that a moratorium would prevent
Longfellow Real Estate Partners from proceeding with their
plan to construct an approximately 40,000 square foot
edition at 125 Cambridge Park Drive. The project would open
up a diverse outdoor space and improve climate change
preparedness and resiliency via EV charging stations and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

consistently met and exceeded the goals outlined in

solar arrays. Lerner requested to submit copies of his
prior statements to the clerk for review by the council.
Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk Street, spoke for the
Cambridge Residents Alliance and thanked the council for
5
Packet Pg. 970

6

voting to send the LY free zoning petition to the full
council. They requested the council to vote in favor of
moving the petition to a second reading, including language

outs for developers.
Farris also asked the council to approve the
resolution in support of the Green New Deals, New Deals for
Cities Act of 2021 by Representative Corey Bush, which
provides funding for environmental justice, building
electrification, decarbonization, reparations, and green
jobs. Ferris emphasized the urgency of passing these
measures to achieve climate and equity goals in Cambridge.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, spoke about
several issues, including housing support and Alewife
zoning. She urged people to stop using the word "Zoom" and
recognize it as a primary means of public comment and
accessibility for some individuals. She expressed
excitement about the progress in the Grand Junction path

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

covering new and existing developments, and avoiding carve-

and APA funds going towards broadband. However, she
reminded the council of the oldest awaiting report item
from 2016 about housing support and urged them to address
it. She also questioned the number of curb cuts at 650 East
6
Packet Pg. 971

6

Kendall Street and suggested adding a covered bike rack at
City Hall. She highlighted the importance of decent
planning in the city and urged the council to pass her

the announcement of the start of a study should not be an
occasion for up zoning to be filed. She also expressed
concern that too often, up zoning is done before proper
planning takes place. She concluded by thanking the council
and urging them to work towards improving accessibility,
housing support, and planning in the city.
Mike Nakagawa, 51 Madison Avenue, North Cambridge,
spoke about Alewife Zoning during a meeting. He expressed
gratitude to the councillors for forwarding the petition to
the whole council and urged them to pass it to a second
vote with no exceptions, even if there were still
outstanding issues. He emphasized that delays should not be
tolerated and that the area needs resiliency planning.
Nakagawa pointed out that developers tend to pick and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

previous testimony on Air wife zoning. She emphasized that

choose parts of old and proposed plans and that a universal
standard needs to be established. He also stressed the need
for resiliency zoning in the rest of the city after
Alewife's issues are addressed. He did not think the time
7
Packet Pg. 972

6

period for this zoning should be shortened or extended.
Nakagawa has leadership roles in several groups, including
the Alewife Study group, Fresh Pond Residents Alliance, and

on the climate change preparedness and resiliency planning
Air Focus Group, which produced an air preparedness plan in
2017.
Loren Crowe, 8 Museum Way, spoke about city manager
agenda item number 1, expressed gratitude towards the City
Manager and staff for creating a new Department of
Community Safety with $3 million. He hoped for a holistic
approach to community safety and thanked Councillor
Simmons, McGovern, and the task force members. He also
thanked former Commissioner Bard and Vice Mayor Mallon for
their leadership. Crowe acknowledged the hundreds of
residents who shared their vision for the city, following
the murder of George Floyd. He expressed concern about the
assault on LGBT rights nationally and suggested Cambridge

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the Cambridge resilience zoning task force. He also served

should do more than usual to commemorate Pride Month. The
intersection in front of City Hall has become an important
point of LGBTQIA plus visibility in Cambridge. Crowe
wondered if Cambridge could become a national model for
8
Packet Pg. 973

6

acceptance and allyship. He hoped the council would
consider taking action ahead of June and long after. LGBT
rights are under assault nationally more so than any time

are contagious. He encouraged the council to consider
policy order number five as the first action of many. Crowe
does consulting work that puts them in touch with trans
healthcare providers in Texas, and parents who have the
means to do so are fleeing the state right now. Community
members of all types are being slandered as groomers and
pedophiles, and trans people are under assault by
Republicans looking to make a breakthrough in the culture
war. Crowe wondered if Texas and Florida would compete to
be the national leader in bigotry, or if Cambridge could
become a national model for acceptance and allyship. He
thanked the council for Commemorating Pride Month and hoped
for more action.

This was pulled by Councillor Nolan. Councillor Nolan, you
have the floor.

Co-Chair to start us off on this item if that's allowed.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you both

Councillor Nolan and -- and Vice Mayor. Um, I want to say
at the start that, um, having now seen nine budgets put
together that this budget is organized in, uh, the most,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Yes-8, No-0, Absent-1. Motion passes.

uh, informational manner and, uh, I just glanced through
the beginning of it. I'm up to 2.7. It might take me a few
weeks. But, um, if you're looking for something, you can
find it and the breakdown, which, uh, we asked for last
11
Packet Pg. 976

6

time of each city goal-- each council goal with a dollar
amount, even though one can interpret that plus or minus
because there's an overlap in where money goes is I believe

and that gives us a sense of really where money is going
and how it's meeting our goals.
Um, and I wanted to congratulate, uh, the manager and
his finance team in doing that. Um, this budget is-- if you
lift it up, you can tell it's about 800 million. And, um,
what impressed me is that in the key areas that concern
many of us, it clearly outlines the increase, for instance,
affordable housing is an increase of 17/17 and a half
percent. Uh, early childhood, the max the-- the amount of
money is 29.4%. Um, there are other figures that my, uh,
Co-Chair might talk about. Um, but I-- I think one of the
keys on the agenda tonight related to this is there are
required loan orders for bonded capital projects that, uh,
the manager and his staff will talk about and they need to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the first time that's done so accurately and-- and clearly,

be adopted tonight as, um, as, uh, orders so that they can
be part of the final budget. So I'll bring it back to my
Co-Chair, uh, Councillor Nolan. But, um, truly, uh, at
least the first 30 pages, uh, are very, very-- I'm sure the
12
Packet Pg. 977

6

whole, very, very well organized and have responded to
council requests over the last few years. Vice Mayor, thank
you.
Councillor Nolan. You have

the floor.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Uh, yes, as

the-- uh, my, uh, other Co-Chair of the Finance Committee
noted it's a budget which has continued to improve over
time. There's a-- as people read through it, you can go
through, uh, the numbers themselves. I don't repeat them
all other than to say that, uh, look for the categories in
which spending is and the responsiveness to City Council
priorities of affordable housing, equity, and inclusion,
community safety, sustainability, infrastructure, early
childhood, universal pre-K education, municipal broadband
is hidden in there-- in the, um, in some of it too. We
should all be glad that we have been working together to
address those. I won't go into those specifics. It's--

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

before you, however, I do want to remind the council and
all of us that there will be Finance Committee budget
hearings, uh, Tuesday May 10th. So that is coming up soon
next week.
13
Packet Pg. 978

6

It will be an all day meeting starting at 9 o'clock
with the departments in the categories of general
government and public safety. Wednesday the following day,

Committee for the school department budget. Um, and then
Tuesday, May 17th, uh, we will have another starting at
10:00 in the morning, departments in the category of human
resources, community maintenance, intergovernmental and the
capital budget. We are also holding Thursday, May 19th for,
uh, the day in case there's a need for an additional budget
meeting as well. You, uh-- the councillors will all be
getting an email requesting that they tell us the areas of
the budget that they want to have-- that they have
questions on so that we can ask the staff to prepare and in
advance of that. I look forward to those meetings, which
will be on us before we note-- uh, before we know it. And
I-- I want to also thank the-- the finance staff and all of
the city departments because even if the finance puts it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

May 11th at 6 o'clock, we'll be joined by the School

together, every single department obviously has to put
together their own departmental budget and it includes
goals as well as, uh, plans for the next year, which I
think is exactly where we need to be. Thank you, Vice Mayor
14
Packet Pg. 979

6

Chair Mallon. I yield.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

Nolan. Um, Mr. City manager, did you have anything to add?
Yes, thank you to

you, Madam Chair. I'll be brief and I'm gonna turn it over
to David, if that's okay. So first of all, I-- I really
want to start off by thanking the council. Uh, I think this
is a budget that really has added a lot of additional
information and formatted it in a way that makes it easy
for the public. And as someone who's been working on
budgets for 40 years, I think our ability to listen to the
council and try to make this book better, has made this
book better and the council deserves a lot of credit for
that. And I think when you do something as long as all of
us have, sometimes you think it's just the way it is is
fine and, uh, I-- I appreciate that sometimes as good as it
is, it can always get better. And I think especially
working with the chairs over the last probably 4 to 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

years, we really have done a lot of additional work that
has made this a much better document and I don't think that
would have happened if it wasn't for working with the
council.
15
Packet Pg. 980

6

So I want to-- want to really give the council credit
for that. I think the page on the council goals putting
numbers to it. It's rough, it was difficult to try to fine

it was-- it's a great addition to the budget. And working
through the years in the consolidated spending, really
highlighting key areas of the city, I think have been a
great addition. So I want to thank the council. I also want
to thank the departments and the staff because the budget
is a lot of work before all this was added. But a
willingness to say this is making it a better document and
doing that additional work has been important in that
doesn't happen by action, it happens with a lot of work. So
I want to thank Taha and his team and I want to thank the
city departments for all they're doing.
Uh, in this current budget, I think we've really
worked hard to make sure the budget reflects the City
Council goals. And I think we've made it clearer than ever

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

tune it. But I think it really sends a message and I think

before that that is the case. And I think the City Council
goals clearly prep-- reflect the priorities that the
citizens want in this city. So I think-- and the residents
want in the city. And I think it's important that the
16
Packet Pg. 981

6

budget reflect what residents feel are important. I think
we've really done that. I think we spent a real lot of time
saying what are the key areas and how we can provide a

affordable housing has been a key factor. It will continue
to be. Schools and early education, sustainability, vision
zero, and traffic safety, anti bias and diversity, all
areas where the council has made a priority. This budget
reflects that. And again, I think that's the ability for
the council and the manager and his team to work together.
I'm also incredibly pleased to present the first
community safety budget for the city of Cambridge. I want
to thank everybody involved in it. I think it will be the
envy of every city around. I think it's unique. Uh, I-- I
got to give a special shout out to Christina Jacoby who
really has been the point person for the city in this.
She's done a phenomenal job working with a lot of people
and I'm not gonna name them because there is a lot of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

better service. And I think if you look at this budget,

people. I want to thank the residents in the committee. I
want to thank the chairs of the Committee, Councillor
Simmons and Councillor McGovern. I mean, but I think this
budget is something I'm incredibly pleased about what we're
17
Packet Pg. 982

6

presenting and all the work that went in with to make sure
that when you present something like this, it is something
the city will be very proud of and it will have major

And I think one of the things that we've always
strived here is to say, how do we go about providing
services for not the people who know how to get the
services, but how do you provide services for the people
who not necessarily do know how to get the services? How do
you reach out to them and how do you make them aware of
that the city is their city, it's their budget and we can
help? And I think we've done that. So again, I'll let David
and Taha talk about the numbers. But, uh, as you know, this
is my last budget and I couldn't be prouder of the budget
we've turned in because I really think in my 40 years of
doing budget, this is the clearest representation for the
public to really see where our money goes. How-- what we
say is our priority translates into this budget. And again,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

impact on the residents who need it the most.

that's not just by acne, it's a lot of hard work, but a lot
of that hard work in decision making was worked in
conjunction with the City Council and especially the chair.
So I want to thank everybody. This is a budget, I'm
18
Packet Pg. 983

6

incredibly proud of and looking forward to the budget
discussions, uh, when we get into the Finance Committee. So
thank you and I'll turn it over to David, if that's okay,

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Mr. Manager. Mr.

Kale.
DIRECTOR DAVID KALE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um, I

would just, uh, emphasize what the manager just, uh, talked
about on page I-12 and 13 and 14. Um, I would suggest that
the public when the budget's loaded online and Taha-- Taha
will talk about the logistics of that. I think that if, uh,
you read those bullet items that talk about the things that
the council and the manager have worked on, um, to create a
lot of open space and to provide affordable housing and
innovative programs such as the police and fire cadet
program and the like I think that you take a step back and
look at those accomplishments, what we've been able to do
with the council, especially in the era-- era of COVID

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Madam Chair.

where municipal budgets, in some cases were being reduced
in other communities, we've been able to move the ball
forward and I think collectively we should take pause and,
um, take rightful pride in what we've been able to do.
19
Packet Pg. 984

6

This budget, uh, as the-- uh, I never quite heard the
budget and, uh, what $800 million worth of, uh,
expenditures weighs, but I guess now I do, um, is $801

over the FY 22 adjusted budget. Uh, the FY 23 budget calls
for 8.4 increase in the property tax levy, um, and that is
higher than last year, uh, which with the actual rate was
4.7. Um, our five year average of the actual tax levy
increase has been 5.8% and the 10 year average is 5.2%. Um,
in past years, when we have set the tax rate, we've been
able to use non property tax revenues at a higher level
than what was in the budget that is before you in the
budgets previously. Uh, what we do is we take a look at
where we end the fiscal year, um, and what we have for
actual, um, revenues and see if we can make adjustments
that to basically make adjustments to the property tax
levy.
Um, we will continue to do that and when we come back

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

million and represents an increase of 48, 754,000 or 65.5%

to you in the fall to vote the property tax rate and the,
uh, final classification, uh, we will have taken that
review. Um, I would also note that there has been a
transition period over the last couple of years and I think
20
Packet Pg. 985

6

we talk about bridges and we've been able to use our
financial flexibility to basically get hopefully knock on
wood on the other side of COVID and get back to some, uh,

think that our parking fund receipts, uh, seem to have
stabilized and are increasing. Um, the water and sewer
revenue seem to be coming back as more folks, um, travel
and utilize hotels and more folks are coming back to their
office spaces.
Um, so those are good thing. meals tax seemed to be
rebounding. So I think some of our non property tax
revenues are coming back, which is what we were hoping for.
But our ability to transition over the last couple of years
by using our reserves that we never quite have imagined we
would have had to need to use our reserves to the extent
that we did, but nobody ever could have imagined COVID
either. So, um, the city was in a good place. And this
budget in '23, uh, also includes items that are non

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

normal, um, in terms of revenues. And the good news is, I

property tax to, uh, basically offset, uh, the property
tax, which is $2.5 million in overlay, surplus-- surpluses,
$13 million in free cash, um, which is a reduction from
last fiscal year where it was $20. 11 million from the debt
21
Packet Pg. 986

6

stabilization fund, $17 million from the health claims
trust fund.
Um, it also includes increases due to, uh, salary

includes 23 full time positions, which again, um, full time
positions for '23 which again, I think as a manager noted
has allowed us to address the City Council priorities that
have been communicated to us. Uh, including the capital
budget and important infrastructure improvements, um,
around, uh, um, affordable housing, street and sidewalk
enhancements, building a facility improvements, um, and the
like and these, uh, capital investments again allow us to
move forward on our, uh, physical plant but also in, uh,
our affordable housing, um, priorities.
Um, in addition to that, I will remind you that we
continue to receive our AAA bond rating from the three
major rating agencies. And, uh, we just had our sale, uh,
back in March and we received an interest rate of 1.9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

negotiations and insurance increases. And the budget

million-- 1.9% true interest cost, which again saved us
money from otherwise having to spend more in interest that
we could put towards other programs because of our lower,
um, interest rate. So, as I noted, while we transition, um,
22
Packet Pg. 987

6

from COVID, there is still some uncertainty and again, uh,
we're monitoring this very closely and we have every month
and we will continue to do that between now and the end of

financial flexibility, we've been able to balance providing
additional services to the residents, but at the same
token, um, utilizing our reserves in a very prudent way.
Um, the long term outlook for Cambridge remains very strong
and it, uh, is due to, uh, adhering to the policies and
practices that have been implemented by the city
administration and the City Council. Um, so with that, I
think Taha has a few other things to add in terms of, uh,
other information and, uh, I'll turn her over to Taha.
TAHA JENNINGS:

Thanks, David. I want to start by

saying, thank you to the council and Finance committee CoChairs. Um, of course to the city manager, assistant city
manager of fiscal affairs and Public Investment, David
Kale, who just heard from, assistant finance director

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the fiscal year. But again, I think because of our

Michele Kincaid, uh, the fiscal team throughout the city,
um, and especially to the staff in the budget office,
Angela Pierre, uh, the Deputy Director, Daniel List, our
principal budget analyst, Jackson Price, our budget analyst
23
Packet Pg. 988

6

and PB coordinator and Matt Nelson from the city manager's
office. Uh, putting this together is simply not possible
without all of the extra effort and hours that the team put

It takes a lot of work, not just to put the book
together, but also throughout the year, working closely
with every department and fiscal staff. Um, obviously, as-as David mentioned COVID-19 has made putting together the
annual operating capital budget a little bit more
complicated, uh, over the past couple of years. But at the
same time, we've continued to work to add new information
based on council interests, um, and also in order to try
and make the budget as transparent and as easy to follow as
possible. Um, there is a lot of information. So I-- I do
think it's helpful to just briefly summarize what's in each
section of the book, um, in advance of our anticipated
meetings with the finance committee.
Uh, so section 1 of the book starts with a joint COVID

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

in.

message from the mayor and city manager. Um, and it's
important to not only recognize all the strategies that
happen outside of the budget that have been taken to
address the COVID-19 pandemic, but also the city's ability
24
Packet Pg. 989

6

to do those things is because of how we put together our
budget. Um, I would encourage everyone to read the city
manager's message in section 1 very carefully. Um, it

budget, what it means for the community, for taxpayers new
initiatives, and how they relate to council goals and
priorities.
Uh, section 1 also includes a section outlining the
city's anti race equity and inclusion efforts. Uh, this
started last year because we felt it was important to be
able to highlight some of this important work that's going
on in departments. Uh, we highlighted four departments last
year and this year, um, uh, we added two more departments.
Uh, there is a listing of some of the significant
modifications to the budget. Uh, this is also in section 1,
um, several of those budget modifications are described in
greater detail, um, in the following key initiatives, uh,
portion of that section. Uh, David alluded to this but the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

really provides a good summary of everything that's in the

council goals are listed on page 54 of section 1 and based
on feedback from council and working with the finance CoChairs.
This now includes estimates on the amount of operating
25
Packet Pg. 990

6

funds allocated to each of the 12 City Council goals. The
consolidated -- the consolidated spending section of the
budget was added a few years ago and has become a useful

some key priority areas. Uh, last year, we added a new
category for expenditures related to addressing racial and
economic inequities and we included some, you know,
enhanced information, uh, regarding that. Section 2 of the
book is the city overview section. It includes information
on how to read and understand the budget book. Um, as well
as a lot of, uh, benchmark information from departments
and-- and in key areas.
Uh, section 3 of the book is our financial summary
section. Uh, here you get an overview on where the city is
financially, um, but just as importantly why the city's
budget strategy is what it is. Uh, this section includes
information on the budget process, our financial policies
and guidelines that we've consistently used, uh, and this

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

tool to estimate the total spending across departments in

year based on discussions with council, uh, that started, I
think last year's budget process. Uh, there's an updated
investment policy related to fossil fuels and for profit
prisons. Section 4 is the revenue section of the book and
26
Packet Pg. 991

6

details all the revenues that the city uses in the budget.
Taxes obviously is our biggest source of revenue. Um, but
again, and as David mentioned, many of our other non

been historically, um, because of COVID-19 and these same
revenues, those we-- we'd still keep a close watch on and
monitor carefully because they're very important to limit
impacts on taxpayers when we're looking at ways to fund
many of the new initiatives, um, and expanded programs in
the city.
Uh, section 5 of the book is, uh, the expenditure
section. It's the largest section of the book. Uh, provides
information on what each department and division, uh,
within the city does, uh, their objectives for the upcoming
fiscal year and how those directly relate to City Council
goals. Section 6 of the public investment section of the

the appropriation orders and this is what-- these are what
are actually adopted by the council. These will be the
budgeted amounts and revenue amounts, uh, for department in
the statutory categories listed. Uh, you could almost think
of the entire budget book as providing additional
information and context to back up the appropriations. Uh,
finally, the glossary and index are pretty self
explanatory, but we do work to keep definitions and terms
updated to help further explain what's in the book. Uh, the
bottom line is that we really want people to understand and
be comfortable with what's in the budget and what it
ultimately means for the community. Um, what's inside the

about showing how the city is being responsive to community
needs, council goals, city priorities, and in a way that's
fiscally responsible.

Um, I also want to, um, also recognize that this is
the city manager's final submitted budget. Um, and I think
it's really easy to take for granted how much information

know, be clear and transparent to the public, um, how
responsive it is to co-- to council needs community needs.
Um, and-- and how it's evolved over the years based on
changing needs and priorities. I think everything that
people noted that they appreciate about the budget and have
noted that they appreciate about it budget. Um, the city
manager has had a pretty strong hand in-- in making happen.
Um, I think it's a very successful framework that's gonna
serve us well, for a long, long time. Um, so thank you
again. I know there are Finance Committee meetings
scheduled over the next couple of weeks. I'd be happy to
answer any questions that you might have now, uh, but of
course, at those hearings and in the meantime, please feel
free to reach out to the budget office.

Uh, good-- good evening. Uh, through you Madam Chair to the
city manager and his team, let me just start the way, uh, I
would like to finish. And that's by saying, I want to

particularly around the budget and the fiscal strength of
our city. We are in an enviable position and that does not
happen by accident. It takes extraordinary hard work and we
made the right decision several years ago when we chose Mr.
DePasquale to be our city manager. largely in part because
of his skill, his expertise, his attention to first of all
have the right people in his department, Mr. Jennings, Ms.
Kincaid, Mr. Kale, and so many others that, uh, Taha
Jennings just mentioned in his department doing the work.
And-- and someone who's been around for a minute or so, I
have watched this budget document in particular evolve over
time.
It has been because of the leadership, um, of Mr.
DePasquale. So I just want to start by saying, thank you so

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

thank, um, Mr. DePasquale for his work to the city,

much for, uh, choosing to have stayed with Cambridge and
being our city manager. And for this budget, uh, as Mr.
Jennings went through, uh, parts of the budget document,
um, talking about how the budget, first of all, as a
30
Packet Pg. 995

6

document is so much different than it was 15 years ago. The
glossary, having a way for people to understand the
language that we use that's in the development of this

pleased about in section 1 of the anti racist inclusion,
that part of it. We as a City Council have talked a lot
about diversity, equality, and inclusion. Uh, but this
time, it really stands out in a budget in a tangible way.
So I'm very, very pleased about that.
Uh, I love the segmentation of the budget and we do
have-- and we have done extraordinarily well given coming
through a pandemic. We all should be grateful and pleased
that we have done so well, but it would not have happened
without the leadership of Mr. DePasquale. We will have time
to unpack and go through item by item of this budget. But I
want to as we start this budget cycle, say at the very
beginning, I appreciate the work of me, Mr. DePasquale. I
thank him for this budget. I certainly thank his staff and

I look forward to the upcoming, um, finance meetings that

acknowledge Councillor Carlone, um, on his work when we
started that in the previous budget cycle .The work you see

So with that, I will yield the floor. Again, we'll have
opportunities to unpack this budget. Um, I'm excited about
the money that's coming forward the $88.1 million. So
again, I thank you too, Mr. DePasquale, acknowledgement to
the-- the co chairs, particularly Councillor Carlone. I
will yield the floor at this time, Madam Chair.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Through you, um, again, I will-- I just got the-- just saw
the book tonight. So I haven't had a chance to dig into it
that much. But I do-- I do want to thank, uh, everyone, uh,
from the budget office and the finance department who
worked on this and put this together. I-- I always think

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

here is the cumulative effort of everyone working together.

back to, uh, Councillor Kelly with our budget needs to tell
a story, you know, and uh, it-- it tells a story, it's
gotten better and better, uh, year after year and that's-uh, that's because of your hard work. And, um, there's a
32
Packet Pg. 997

6

lot of stuff in here that-- that, uh-- I think is-- is
gonna be really great just for my quick skimming of the-I'm really, I'm glad to see the, um, uh, that we're adding

That was one of the things that came out in the, uh, in the
task force that by having a mental health professional in
911 you can eliminate, I forget what the number was, but it
was a pretty high percentage of calls of even needing to
send someone out because they're able to, you know, better
assist someone on the phone. So I think that's gonna be-um, I think that's gonna be a great, a great addition and-and, um, I was really happy to see that. Um, a quick
question though. Um, last year, you know, we went through
that whole, I think it was last year, um, where there were
some positions that we didn't add right away, maybe it was
two years ago, we didn't add right away and then, you know,
like the-- the social worker at the library and stuff like
that. And then we-- we sort of reprioritize, is there--

positions are all new in addition to that or are some of
these going back to those empty positions.

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

These are all full

will be starting in January as we just-- as we try to

department heads and knowing the priorities the council
have set, we really tried to say that we-- we really need
to address them. They are starting in July and there is a
small percentage and we really have tried to address the
positions in the previous budget that haven't been filled.
And a lot of that was a strategy around COVID, to be very
honest, and I think we are making great progress in filling
those positions that were new last year as well. I don't
know Taha if you need to add anything.
TAHA JENNINGS:

Through you Madam, uh Vice Mayor, yet-

- those are-- these are separate positions. So though-- if
those other positions that were put on hold aren't filled
yet, they're in the process of being filled, but these are
separate from those new positions.

certainly a city our size, um, that is doing all the things
that we're doing and, um, there's always more to do and-and we never rest on our laurels here. But, um, I'm sure
there's a lot of great stuff in here and I'm looking
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

forward to digging into it and I hope Mr. Manager as your
last budget I don't know if you have a glass case for this
to put on your mantel at home or something. But, uh, uh,
congratulations in-- in-- in all that-- all that you've
done in stewarding and-- and, uh, this city through some
challenging financial times over the years. So I look
forward to the-- the, uh, the Finance Committee meetings
where we can dig a little deeper. Thank you.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Ma'am

Chair. Through you, and my thanks as well to the manager
and staff for this, uh, budget as it's often said that the
budget is a moral document and I appreciate the additional
clarity and the ability for the council and-- and the
public to identify how we're spending our money and how we
are impacting our residents' lives. Um, I was pleased to
see the community safety department in-- in the budget. I
look forward to how that, uh, unfolds. I know there's still
35

Packet Pg. 1000

6

some on-- ongoing discussions around that and some details
and particularly some questions around how the hard
proposal in particular will be included as we move forward.

know-- and-- and I appreciate, uh, my colleague's question.
I-- I'm a little bit confused about positions that not
being filled because that was two years ago. So I don't
know if-- if you want to bring some clarity to that, but I- I am disappointed to see yet again, uh, a proposed
increase to the police budget, uh, despite, you know, the-the many discussions we had about that over the last two
years. Thank you.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you Madam

Chair, I just want to go over the positions again. Uh, when
we did the budget last year, we knew there was gonna be
some COVID issues. So our intent was for-- from a lot of
those positions to put them on for a half a year, some for
a year. But with the fact that we did have limit capacity

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So I look forward to that ongoing discussion. I am, you

and how many people we wanted the building during COVID and
so many other items, we were really slow in filling
positions and that was an intentional decision. We have
really picked that pace up. So most of the new positions
36
Packet Pg. 1001

6

that were in the budget we're in now are either filled or
in process. Uh, and over and above that, there is a new
series of positions that are in this budget. Some of which

budget is approved, we're gonna advertise in June so that
come July, we can actually have people in the position. So
it is a change in terms of how we're looking at positions,
but we are really ramping up in terms of previous positions
that were never filled before because they were brand new,
getting filled in, making sure that these new positions
which we feel are really important to get to where the
council feels the priorities are needed in the city and
where we agree that some of them will even be hopefully
brought on as early as July once this budget is approved.

immediately adjacent and to the west of the Tobin school
project.

COMMISSIONER KATHY WATKINS:

Hey, through you, um,

Mayor-- Vice Mayor. Um, so as people have heard, there's
been a lot of interest in sort of continuing CSO control.
And so we have done a lot of projects over the last 20 to
30 years, increasing sewer separation, looking at
decreasing flooding in the neighborhood and really looking
at providing a higher quality level of service to our
residents and also improving the water, um, quality of the
receiving bodies, both the Alewife as well as the Charles
River. So that- that work has been quite successful. And I,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

you know, as we talk about it, I also say that there's also
a lot of work yet to be done. And so over the next year and
a half, we will be working on a plan, um, with DEP, EPA,
the cities of Somerville and also, um, MWRA looking at
45
Packet Pg. 1010

6

additional, um, sewer improvements.
And so over the next year and a half, we will have a
public process as well as doing a lot of technical work to

how can we continue to make improvements both in the
Alewife and the Charles. But the projects that you see, um,
you know, in the Port, on River Street, in Central Square
are all about decreasing the amount of storm water that
gets into our sewer system, improving the level of service
for the residents and also improving water quality. So
again, we talk about this very much as a continuous

Councillor Paul F. Toner - Yes

pointed to maybe somewhere-- somewhere else in the back
about what is involved in this particular appropriation
because it crosses a number of different projects. I am
very happy to see all the projects. I-- I will note that I
47
Packet Pg. 1012

6

do hope the Danehy New Street Project considers and builds
on the work done by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority
and built on by many of the tenants in the Fresh Pond

to connect Danehy to the other side at that site somewhere
along there in order to make the connection. So I'm just
curious, I don't think that's included, but I would like to
know what is included in this or whether you could point me
to the range of projects that would be covered by this
appropriation.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Mr. City Manager.

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

So, um, Chair

Nolan, if you look at the capital budget on page, uh, VI26.
It lists the three projects in totality of $15 million. Um,
we have appropriated funds through CPA to do the design for
the Linear Park. And this basically, uh, will allow us to
allow us to have that project go forward. Uh, the Danehy
New Street Path, uh, basically, um, is the, uh, former rail

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

apartments, um, who are asking us to consider an underpass

right away, uh, that the city acquired in 2016. So this
appropriation will provide funds, uh, to have that project
move forward. And then the Grand Junction, um, again, prior
funds have been authorized. And basically, this is an
48
Packet Pg. 1013

6

allocation to make sure we can complete the project, um, as
we move forward. So, um, that is the $15 million is to
cover those three projects. And, uh, the $15 million is an

projects, but we've lumped them together just to have, uh,
some flexibility in terms of as we move forward.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. And it's for

the design and construction of these projects. And I-- I-I know in fact, on Wednesday, there's a couple of
different, uh, departments or initiatives to actually walk
along the path on Danehy street as well as one on the other
side. So I, um, uh, look forward to this connection and
also look forward to continue conversation so that we can
really have this network, including connecting the paths
that we're building on one side of the tracks at a to the
other side of the tracks because I think it's a critically
important part of knitting the community together. So thank

for the municipal facilities improvement plan. This item

Thank you, Vice Mayor

Mallon. I-- this is an appropriation for again, a range of
various projects related to the municipal facility

improvement plan. It includes an-- an upgrade to the ground
source heat exchange known as the Geothermal Well System at
the-- at the Annex which I understand was one of the first

improvements. My-- my overall question particularly, for
instance, with the HVAC improvements, is this something
that will get us along on towards greater sustainability?
Because we ,do have the, um, the command for ourselves to
move forward to lower our emission pollution. And it wasn't
clear from some of this right up. I understand a lot of
these are the-- due to the initiatives of the council and
the community to increase our ability to, for instance,
move towards a fossil fuel free feature-- in future,
including electric vehicle charging station. The Vice Mayor
has a policy order later on for us in this to include some
of the bicycle infrastructure that may not have included
before. I-- I'm not sure if we can answer all the question
but really helpful to understand how it is that this moves

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and now needs to be upgraded. Building envelope, HVAC

us along and to be a little more specific about whether
this does reduce our emission pollutions as a city for
these various projects.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Commissioner O'Riordan.

COMMISSIONER OWEN O'RIORDAN:

Through you, Madam Vice

Mayor. So co-- um, Councillor, the quick response to your
question is yes, it does move us along. Um, the project

it's to improve the envelope associated with that building.
So as to reduce the load-- the energy load that's going to
be required to heat and cool it. Um, over and above that as
you said, the geothermal wells need to be, um, up-upgraded at that facility at the moment. They-- they are
open loop geothermal wells and we'll be putting in a closed
well system as a result of this investment.
Beyond that at the Moses Youth Center, we'll be
replacing the gas, um, the, um, the gas boilers with
electrical boilers. And then obviously with regard to the,
um, the work that's being done, um, associated with
electrical charging stations, we expect to invest in
charging stations at the police department, at the water
department and public works and at other facilities. And

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

associated with the City Hall Annex is a 2-4 project. One,

again, that will allow us in future to invest more money in
vehicle-- electric vehicles as we move forward. So it's
really important from that perspective that we do that. And
similarly, with regards to the other investments here,
52
Packet Pg. 1017

6

again, they're meant to be high efficiency, um, air
conditioning systems that we're putting in-- in both the
Healy building as well as Neo Connell Branch Library. So
again, overall will lead to a reduction in fossil fuels and
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

red-- reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the city.
And again, it's one of the primary motivations in terms of
this program is that we do things from a sustainability
perspective as well-- as well as looking at comfort and
looking at accessibility improvements and so on.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Um, I

understand some of our own windows here in this chamber
have not been upgraded and they're very, very leaky. So I
look forward to when we can do that, but I-- I-- I am glad
to hear that and it would be good to quantify that. So we
understand how it is-- this is-- this is moving. Again, I
don't expect it to happen now, but it's really important
that we-- that we understand as we move forward how much,
uh, that this is helping our own goals. Thank you. I yield,
Vice Mayor.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Vice Mayor. So last time we received ARPA funds, we went
through this discussion and we were told that we couldn't
vote on individual expenditures that we had to vote 55
million all at once. And so now I'm assuming we're back to
the same situation where we are now being asked to vote on
23 million all at once. And obviously, we're going to
approve it at some point. But I would like to understand
how we can get more specificity around how the money is
going to be spent. I appreciate the process that we're
going through right now, um, with the finance committee,
but, you know, we're still-- there's still a lot of
outstanding community requests for funding, for example.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Mr. Manager.

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Through you, Madam

55
Packet Pg. 1020

6

Chair. And I certainly can appreciate the question,
Councillor. Uh, I took very seriously the $65 million and
the council's approval of it. And I think we have worked

respectful of the commitment we made to say we're gonna
really work with the council with the priorities. Based on
what we've done to date, uh, Finance Director felt it was
appropriate to come up with the 23 million. And I can
assure you, I wanted to make sure that we had made our
commitment clear so that there was trust in this out of 23
million. And I think we've done that, but I can let David
get into the details. But again, I'm-- I'm-- I'm assured
that I'm moving forward again. We will work incredibly
closely with the council and keep them aware of what we're
doing and making sure it falls in line with what the Cochair of the committee feel in the City Council. And I want
to thank the co chairs for really their leadership to
making sure that what we said, making sure the public is

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

incredibly hard with the two chairs to really try to be

aware, making sure the council is happening. And I think
we've done a good job with that, but I'm gonna turn it over
to David for more detail. But thank you.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Mr. Kale.
56
Packet Pg. 1021

6

DIRECTOR DAVID KALE:

Through you, Madam Chair, um,

through Councillor Zondervan. As you're aware, we've had
several finance committee meetings to discuss, uh, the

uh, that we reviewed with the City Council and, um,
virtually all of them meet the priority areas that were
communicated to us in previous finance committee meetings.
In addition to that, we have allocated $22 million for a
cash assistance program that was announced last week. In
addition to that, we're continuing to receive public
requests. We have now over 42, I believe as of this morning
that we've received from the public that were reviewed by
the finance committee last week.
Um, we will, um, have a strategic pause on public
request as of, uh, tonight. Um, we also have received a
request from the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition. Uh, we also
have other City Council priorities that we are looking at,
uh, which is the transit, uh, component. And we're waiting

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

proposals. We have allocated $33 million in, um, projects,

for the report from the mayor's task force that will be
issued in June. We are looking at the report that was
recently issued with regard to homelessness and looking to
see what things in addition to what we've already allocated
57
Packet Pg. 1022

6

that we can look at. In addition to that, the climate
crisis working group report has been issued and we're
working to see what things that are eligible that we can

department heads, uh, that have not been submitted for
review.
So what we will again do, we will be sitting with the
City Manager to review, um, the, uh, public request to see
which ones we can move forward. Um, I would just note that,
uh, the public request, uh, total over $119 million.
Actually, I think now we're at $139 million. So obviously,
um, we're not going to be able to fund all of that. Uh, but
we do have areas that, uh, the council has asked us to look
at which I just mentioned. So of the $33 million that we
have, we will then start to work with the council to get
their feedback and to take a look at the areas that the
council has asked us to look at and come up with some
suggestions and we'll provide that to the council in future

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

fund. Um, and then we also have, uh, requests from the

finance committee meetings.
So I think as the manager said, we've provided
information to the council. We've solicited feedback. We
are moving on using the money, which again is to help
58
Packet Pg. 1023

6

individuals and organizations with the pain that COVID has
caused. And again, I think we all that information is on
our webpage. So we've posted everything on the webpage. Um,

request that we've received. As I noted, we will go through
the items that I just mentioned, which is public request
and the nonprofit coalition request, uh, transit,
homelessness, climate crisis and department head request
and try to-- we'll come up with the strategy how to utilize
the 33 and solicit feedback from the council.
So I think with this allocation appropriation of the
additional funds that will make us whole in terms of what
the federal government has given it to us and will allow us
to continue with the planning. So, um, I don't know if that
answers your question, but that is the, uh, road map that
we-- we will be following.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we will be updating the webpage with the additional public

Vice Mayor. Through you. I-- I appreciate that. Um, you
know, I-- I'm still trying to understand why we can't get a
sense of how the money is going to be spent with more
specificity before we vote on this. But I would like to
59
Packet Pg. 1024

6

hear from my colleagues, you know, what their thoughts are
on that, um, before we move forward.
DIRECTOR DAVID KALE:

Through you, Madam Mayor, as we

grant and basically the implementation, um ,as the Manager
said, we will work with the council, but the, um, grant
appropriations is not on a project by project basis and we
had that conversation. But I think as I noted, um, the
Manager made a commitment to make sure that through the
finance committee that we would continue to provide
information to the council, which have and solicit feedback
and, um, try to-- and to focus on City Council priorities
which, um, as I noted, looking at the initial list of 44 at
the finance committee, um, highlighted the fact that we did
that and, uh, one of the priorities that the council
expressed was the cash assistance component, which we have
just done.
So I think with this allocation, um, we will have our

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

noted, last time, basically the council votes the total

total funds in hand. Uh, otherwise, we'll be at, uh, uh,
the 65 allocation and we will stop spending because that's
all we have authorization to do. And we like to move
forward on continuing to provide information to the council
60
Packet Pg. 1025

6

so that we can allocate the total amount of the grant in a- in a thoughtful way. Uh, again, I would just also point
out that, um, as we commit funds, there is the-- the side

important, uh, for the city and the council to allocate the
funds so that we can, um, implement as we solicit feedback
and, uh, implementation of these funds so that that can
move forward. Um, otherwise, we will be in a holding
pattern which I don't think the council wants to be in. So,
thank you.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

And can I just add

one thing? Uh, I want to make one thing very clear because
I-- I think it's certainly a concern of Councillor
Zondervan. And I understand other than this additional
money that we've just talked about last week, there is no
agreement on any other funds on what we're gonna do with
it. We will work with the council and the chair to go over
that. So there is nothing that we've committed to, not

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

of the coin of implementation. So, uh, I think it's

would we again without bringing it to the chairs and

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Vice

Mayor. And through you to our manager and assistant city
manager, I-- I-- we spoke today with Mr. Kale about setting
up an ARPA Finance Committee Meeting. So once again, we can
talk about priorities and emphasizing what's important to
us. Uh, just as what was said, that's exactly what we've
been told. We've asked the same questions and we're hearing
from nonprofits and other groups just as everyone else in
the room is and we understand and, um, both sides have to
express what their interests are and what the goals are and
how to interpret the City Council goals at this point. But,
um we knew there was gonna be, uh, it was going to be a
very busy period with the manager selection and finance
budget meetings. So after that is when we informally
suggests that having another meeting, so we will get to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

that and everyone will have the opportunity to make their
point. I-- I hope that helps a little bit. We haven't
forgotten as my-- I guess that's what I should have said in
the beginning. We-- we know that's coming up. Thank you.

Thank you, Madam Vice Mayor.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

Carlone. Any other colleagues comments? I'm not seeing any

with that additional funding. I-- I think it was always my
understanding that we were talking about the ARPA funding
and that funding as a bucket, uh, when we were soliciting,
uh, community submissions. And I know I did receive a
couple of frantic calls from community nonprofits today
saying when is the deadline? So thank you, Mr. Kale, for
being so responsive to saying it's tonight at 8:00 p.m. So
we should have all of those submissions in, uh, by 8:00
p.m. tonight and then have the-- the additional meetings,
um, to discuss those items and the ones that are already
included on the spreadsheet that we've seen before, um,
after the city manager search and after the budget hearing.
So, uh, Councillor Zondervan.

Chair. I'm not, uh, ready to vote on this tonight, so I'm
going to exercise my charter right.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Councillor Zondervan has

exercised his charter rights. So we are moving on to the
63
Packet Pg. 1028

6

calendar. Oh, sorry. We're moving on to the calendar. We
have one charter written item, uh, that the City Manager
being here by is requested to report back on the

with free Charlie cards throughout the school year. This
charter right was exercised by Councillor Simmons and
council on April 11th. Uh, Councillor Simmons, you have the
floor.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Chair.

This is before-- I said-- I did exercise my charter right.
Um, I did have some concerns about, I still have those same
concerns, although I certainly-- I believe I-- I understand
the spirit of-- of this order and I know it does ask for
information from the City Manager. I respectfully like to
see if we could forward this to the mayor's committee on,
uh, transportation. I think it's free transportation that's
being chaired by Councillor Azeem. I've not spoken to
Councillor Azeem to see if he would be, um, able or

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

feasibility of providing all Cambridge High school students

interested in taking this on. So I-- I apologize for
bringing this before I'm on the floor without having talked
to him first, but I think it's important, um, I do have
just a ton of concerns and whereas we're having this full
64
Packet Pg. 1029

6

conversation around free

MBTA. This may be quite the

appropriate place to let this land.
Um, If my colleague is, uh, not, uh, agreeable with--

don't think it's ready to be forwarded to the City Manager
at this time. So, um, my inclination would be to forward it
to a committee that's working on MBTA affairs. I think
that's this most prudent thing to do. I don't believe the
City Solicitor is here that we could ask to opine on this.
So, um, that's what I would like to do, I would like to
refer it. I yield.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Uh, thank you, Councillor

Simmons. Councillor Nolan, uh, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Vice Mayor

Mallon, and-- and thank you to, uh, through you to
Councillor Simmons for explaining her concerns. I hope that
we do for this as City Manager because otherwise we are
really being fundamentally inequitable in our approach to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

with that, um, or the council, I should say, um, I just

some students who live in Cambridge because this is a
companion, uh, policy order that, uh, is exactly the same
wording and the same intent, which is, uh, which we passed
and referred to the City Manager a couple of weeks ago,
65
Packet Pg. 1030

6

which was to say for all CRLS students, let's consider and
ask the City Manager if it would be feasible to provide
only CRLS students, high school students with free Charlie

25% of, um, well, actually, I think at the high school
level, it's only 15 or 20% of students at the high school
level who are attending other schools in particular.
There's an overwhelming majority of the schools who attend
the two charter public high schools in Cambridge, are low
income students of color, I would think would be remiss and
not being very equitable to ensure that all Cambridge High
school students, uh, regardless of where they go to school
would have access to free Charlie cards.
I would think there might be some discomfort with the
idea that there are schools, um, where parents are paying
for their children to attend and they would be included in
this if it was passed in this way. Remember, we're only
asking the City Manager for a report on this and the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

cards. And from my perspective, given that there's about

feasibility of it. And my response to that is, well, there
are many students at CRLS whose families were-- are, um,
certainly not in income brackets that they necessarily
would need this, uh, would not be able to afford this
66
Packet Pg. 1031

6

anyway. And the students-- the Kids Council-- Policy
Council came to us and said they wanted it to apply to
every single student at CRLS. Acknowledging that a very

economic position where it would be a, uh, difficulty for
their families to afford the tea cards.
This is in the category of if-- if a free Charlie card
is good for students at CRLS, I think it's a, um, an
opportunity for us to show equity across the board, uh, and
to ensure that all students in Cambridge, regardless of
which school they attend have access to a safe and reliable
means of transportation. I did have an opportunity to ask a
couple of students, um, who are low income, who are at, uh,
the Cambridge, uh, the Community Charter School of
Cambridge. And they were thrilled just at the idea that the
City Council would even consider them because they didn't
think that that would be included. So I really do hope we,
um, uh, forward this to the City Manager only because we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

large percentage of students at CRLS may well not be in an

did that with the other policy order. So it would seem odd
that we didn't, on the other hand, if, um, if this goes
only in the category of the, um, goes to the, uh, to the
Transportation Committee again, I- I-- I wouldn't
67
Packet Pg. 1032

6

understand because it seems like an inequitable way to
treat certain students in the city different from others.
Thank you, uh, Vice Mayor. I yield.
Uh, we've got Councillor

Azeem and then Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Uh, thank you, uh, uh, Vice

Mayor Mallon. Um, I just wanted to respond to Councillor
Simmons' point. Um, I would be, you know, uh, whatever the
will of the body is on whether passing it tonight or if
they-- so if it chooses to pass it to the Transportation
Committee, I would be happy to hold a hearing on it. Um, I
would just add that, um, we have currently in the works
four or five Transportation Committee hearing. So it would
happen, uh, a little bit later in the year. Um, but I leave
that choice to the body. Um, thank you. I yield.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

I-- I think she may want to clarify. So Councillor Simmons,

you have the floor and then Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
Madam Chair.

My--

Uh, uh, thank you, uh,

my concern just, um, I don't have-- my

concern it says all Cambridge high school students, which
68
Packet Pg. 1033

6

might-- it doesn't sound like to me it's all Cambridge
residents. Maybe it's the way that attend high schools that
are in Cambridge. So I don't know who the-- the community

respectfully, I asked, um, because we're having that
broader conversation and the City Manager would-- if this
is sent to him would go off and certainly sent his staff to
look at it. And we've kept this sort of other process
happening that's gonna be speaking about free MBTA. In its
broader sense, I just think it's a very good place to have
that conversation. And by sending it directly there, it
doesn't stop the City Manager from sending someone to that,
um, meeting to follow the direction in the conversation. I
just think in terms of having-- taking quite a-- a holistic
approach to this, that might be-- that is a sound place.
And my colleague is that he's-- he's agreed to take this on
to send this. I yield.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

is and rather than try to debate this on the floor

Simmons. Councillor Zondervan and then Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Vice

Chair through you. I-- I'm supportive of sending this to
committee for a hearing. I-- I just wanted to clarify a
69
Packet Pg. 1034

6

little bit as well that while the-- the previous order that
we already passed is very clear about, um, prioritizing
CRLS students. This order is-- is less clear and-- and

understand where-- where's the priority here? Are we trying
to send these cards to CRLS students as quickly as
possible? Are we trying to figure out other high school
students in the city who might be eligible? So I appreciate
my colleague's suggestion that we discuss this in-- in
committee while the Manager has time to respond to the
original order about the CRLS students. And then when we
have more clarity on exactly what we're asking for here,
then we may be able to-- to send that to the Manager as
well at a-- at a later time. Thank you.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

Zondervan. Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Vice Mayor.

If, uh, transportation committee is booked, in essence,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

makes it, um, you know, difficult for the manager to

maybe another committee, um, can pick it up quickly. Um, I- I hear the concern of Councillor Azeem that it could hold
up moving forward on this. Um, for me, I think any high
school kid is fine to help finance. This is a liberation in
70
Packet Pg. 1035

6

many ways for low-income kids in partic-- particular and
some high income kids aren't going to do it anyway. Um, and
so I-- I would vote for this tonight as is or whatever.

of the council believes we should do, I'm-- I'm for. We
just have to start moving on this and I think every comment
made, there's a common sense behind it. So it's just coming
to what we agree, uh, as a group. But thank you. I yield.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

Carlone. Councillor McGovern?
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you. Um, so I-- I

do-- I do agree. I think the wording needs to be cleaned up
a little bit, um, because, you know, providing all
Cambridge High school students. So that are we talking
private, parochial, charter? Is it anyone who goes to
school in a Cambridge High school, whether they live in
Cambridge or they don't? So I do think-- I do agree that I
think we need to clean up the-- the language. I wonder if

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

As Councillor Azeem said, whatever the-- the majority

there's a middle ground here because I-- I do-- I mean, I
do agree with Councillor Nolan to the-- to the point of if
you live in Cambridge and you make a choice to send your
child to-- and I'm often criticized for how I feel about
71
Packet Pg. 1036

6

charter schools sometimes. But if you-- if you-- if you
choose to send your child to a charter school, because you
think that's a better option for your-- your-- your kid and

exclude, you know, those-- those children from something.
But again, it's not quite clear to me. So I-- I'm just
throwing this out there, see how people feel. Um, do we
table this, clean up the wording, um, and then come back?
That's a little-- that means we're not acting on it tonight
which some people might feel uncomfortable about. Um, but
we're not sending it off to a committee that might not take
it up for three more months. Maybe we just need to clean it
up a little bit and bring it back. So that's a possibility
also.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

there's a motion on the floor to refer this to the

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of

Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency and the amount of

Extraordinary Expenditures account which will be used to
support the purchase of a new vehicle for the emergency
preparedness and coordination office. Um, this was pulled
by Councillor Nolan. Councillor Nolan, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Uh, thank you, Vice

Mayor Chair Mallon. This-- this is a little bit of a long
saga here. Uh, what I think is very positive is that we
have worked through what I think the expectations of the
council are now whenever a vehicle purchase happens because
the, uh, protocol had not been followed with respect to
this one. The council did not get the-- the three, um, the
information on the three vehicles that were reviewed. I had

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the emergency management performance grant from the

exercised my original charter-- charter right, because I
was concerned that we have a policy of buying EVs any time
they're available and this was-- was not for an EV. We had
some back and forth just so the rest of the council knows
75
Packet Pg. 1040

6

and-- and I think I do apologize. There was some back and
forth and there was some information provided to the Mayor
and myself on the other vehicles that were inspected

departments at Rivean which is, uh, one of the EVs now,
that is a very, um, uh, large and beefy, uh, vehicle that
could have met the needs.
Uh, there was some information on some other vehicles
that were-- were reviewed. I-- and I apologize because I
believe we only got it and we did not, um, it was not
forwarded to the clerk for the rest of the council. So all
of you don't have the benefit of understanding that in
fact, those vehicles were followed. I am happy to pull this
off the table tonight and to, uh, bring it forward. The-the City Manager did send us, uh, an updated and a revised
request based on this back and forth where, uh, the-- the
fire, uh, chief had said that he, uh, that this would meet
their needs and that this would be a plug in, uh, electric

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 2, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

including a Tesla, which has been used by a number of fire

vehicle hybrid as opposed to it. Well, it's not a fully
electric vehicle, it is a different kind of vehicle than it
initially been, um, been requested.
So given that, that it would be-- if we vote on the
76
Packet Pg. 1041

6

revised, uh, recommendation from the City Manager to take
advantage of this grant, I would be happy to support it-to support it. And I-- I-- I do know that we have worked

vehicles come forward, that we will have the benefit of the
full discussion that has happened within the Green Vehicle,
uh, Committee so that we have the benefit of that
information and know that it happened, which-- which had
not been clear in this case. So with that, if that's enough
information for the council. If we want to hear through you
with-- with the-- the Chief or the City Manager, I would
certainly be happy to support this tonight.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Councillor

Nolan. Mr. Manager, do you have anything to add?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

No, I-- I want to

just, you know, say that we've worked through this process.
I think we've gotten to a good place and hopefully we can
approve this tonight and get this vehicle on board and

Director, Sheila Keady regarding the resume of Joseph

We also have questions, uh, for the second-round
interview questions for the City Auditor and as we were
briefed, uh, in the weeks prior by the Vice Mayor, uh, and
those who did the first round of interviews, uh, we have
some information about the candidate, candidates here. This

Heather Hoffman, living in 213, Hurley Street,
started by stating that she was glad to see candidates for
the post of City Auditor and City Clerk, who to her,
However, she qualified her

statement by declaring that there was a whole lot of public
suspicion of the processes by which the City Council
selected very important City officials.
She went on to state that too many past
selections just had a single candidate. So, she hoped that
both of these candidates were truly good and that they do
their jobs. She also hoped that the City Council can do a
better job in future by finding multiple qualified
candidates for such really important positions that keep
Cambridge running.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

There are no further

individuals in public comment.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay, thank you for your

public comment. We'll leave it open until 11. So, before we

bring in, um, the applicant for City, uh, Auditor with the
Clerk -- with the Auditor position and with the Clerk
position, I'm going to have the leaders of those searches.
Just say a few words to remind, uh, how we folks,
4

7

how we got here before we go to the question. So, Vice
Mayor, would you like to say a few words?
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Well, thank you,

bringing forward, uh, the candidate for City Auditor Joseph
McCann. Uh, and I wanted to thank my colleagues, uh,
Councillor Nolan, Councillor Azeem and Councillor McGovern,
uh, for sitting on the ad hoc committee and helping us
select this candidate that we're present, presenting this
morning.
As I noted in my, um, communication, Mr. McCann
has been with the City of Cambridge for just over a year in
the Auditing Department as the Manager of Fiscal Reporting.
Before that, he held positions: he was the Comptroller at
the Mass, Massachusetts Port Authority for over a decade.
He previously worked at the Mass Turnpike
Authority and the Mass Water Resources Authority, both in
high level fiscal management positions. And you do have a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Madam Mayor. Um, I'm pleased to be here today and for

copy of his resume and cover letter on your desk.
Um, but prior to that, uh, Mr. McCann was
actually at KPMG, uh, and had the City of Cambridge as one
of his clients and had -- um, our employees have very, very
5
Packet Pg. 1077

7

positive things to say about him during that time. So, he
holds knowledge on both sides of the fiscal auditing
experience.

position as there were several members of the Auditing
Department that, um, we thought would be ready to, to jump
up and, and head into this role. It's a very specialized
position.
Um, and in addition to that, there have been some
-- a lot of difficulties hiring in this, in this type of
position. So, we really wanted to both promote from within
and make sure that we had, um, an opportunity for some
auditing folks who, who were looking at the City Auditor
role to have this opportunity to be come before us today.
So, uh, the Screening Committee was very
impressed with Mr. McCann's, uh, level of knowledge, um,
the the positions that he's held in the past and really
thought that his answers were, um, and, and are excited to

We decided, um, to look internally in this

So, um, I just wanted to say all that and thank
you Mayor Siddiqui for appointing the ad hoc committee.
Thank you to my colleagues who participated on it and I

look forward to um speaking with Mr. McCann this morning.

candidate before us so we can ask questions. Please bring - you can come yourself [laughs]. And just make sure that
the mic is on. Great.
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Test, test, test.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

You got it. So, we'll

start with, uh, questions for you. Uh, we have about 11
questions and so I'll start with the Vice Mayor and then
followed by Councillor Azeem.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor through you. Um, Mr. McCann, thank you for being
here. It's nice to see you again.
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Thank you.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

We have a few

questions for you. So, the first one I wanted to give you
an opportunity just to take a few minutes to talk about
your job experience, um, your work experience and how you
think that it prepares you for the City Auditor position.
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Okay. Thank you. Good morning,

everybody. So, my background goes back several years and as
7
Packet Pg. 1079

7

the V ice Mayor pointed out, I'll start at the beginning.
Um, I worked at KPMG for the first part of my career as a
Staff Auditor, moving up to Manager and then Senior

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Manager.
And for a number of those years, I was the Staff
Auditor up to Senior Manager on the City of Cambridge. So
that gave me a pretty good working knowledge of the City
itself.
From that point, I proceeded to go over to Mass
Water Resources as the Assistant Controller, I was there
for about 4 years, working in their financial systems, um,
doing financial reporting, grant reporting, et cetera.
Left there to go over to the Massachusetts
Turnpike Authority when they were transitioning into
MassDOT. So, there were a lot of system work, transition
work, moving that to the State Agency that it became. That
was a couple of year transition.
And at that point, I went over to, uh,
Massachusetts Port Authority, which I was there for about
11 years as a controller. In all of those positions, they
were dealing with high level management type positions,
dealing with financial reporting, grant reporting, internal
8
Packet Pg. 1080

7

controls, some system implementations.
And then from Mass Port, I ended up coming to
Cambridge about a year ago to run the financial reporting

position today.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you. I just

want a quick follow-up. Just wanted to see if you could
provide a little bit more information about how that would,
um, prepare you for the City Auditor role.
JOSEPH MCCANN:

The preparation, it was a -- it

allows me to look at this in the perspective of financial
controls, financial reporting, the oversight to both the
Council and the constituents of Cambridge -- it -- from a
perspective of internal controls, financial reporting, the
accuracy and the thoroughness that is really required in
this position. It's working with the outside auditors.
There's, um, it's a very large budget, the grant
piece of it leads to a lot of financial reporting with a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

down in finance and that's what led me to applying for this

lot of federal agencies. So, I have a lot of oversight in
all of those positions as well as just the oversight to see
that internal controls are followed that the best interest
of the City is maintained from my level through and
9
Packet Pg. 1081

7

including the level of the Council and all the fiscal
responsibilities of the City.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you. I think

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Council -- all -- all

set? Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Thank you. Uh, can you

describe your experience working with the heads of other
departments to resolve concerns surrounding the expenditure
of public funds. Please use a specific example of when
there was a disagreement regarding whether the proper
process was followed and describe how the conflict was
resolved. Thank you.
JOSEPH MCCANN:

OK, thank you. I can give you a

couple of examples. They both deal with grant reporting.
Typically, there's a lot of leeway and, and there could be
some discrepancies in grant reporting. To an example, they
-- one would be Force Account Labor, whereas a lot of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

--

grants allow you to charge in-house labor to different
grants. And there are very specific requirements as to what
type of labor and what positions can be charged.
So, there was a situation as an auditor, going
10
Packet Pg. 1082

7

back a number of years, where Force Account Labor was
included in a couple of grants and it was an excessive
amount from positions that were a reach to what they were

The best way to handle that from my perspective
was to make sure that the grant documents clearly stated
what I perceived that you state, do some research through
the regs as to what was proper and allowable and then go to
the client and present that. And in that case, that was
overturned and the amounts were backed out of the grant, so
that it would not create an adverse position.
So, to answer your question, it would be followup with what the client was attempting to do and
accomplish, do my research so that I know that my
understanding is correct. Also, checking with the outside
audit firm if necessary and then presenting it to the
client.
And in that case, like I say, it was removed from

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

trying to accomplish.

the grant documents. Another example would be with overhead
rates. Overhead rates, the calculation of overhead rates
have a lot of components that go into them. And there was a
situation where the rate could have been higher.
11
Packet Pg. 1083

7

There were some charges that were not put into
the rates and, again, checking with the documentation,
checking with the regulations of the required information

to their attention, they could actually put more cost into
that grant line and going forward that was changed.
So, to answer your question in the case of making
sure that my fact pattern and my understanding is correct,
presenting it and explaining the position that I think is
correct and discussing it at all levels with the client or
with the department head and reaching a consensus as to
what is the best path forward.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Azeem. We'll

move to Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you to Mr. McCann. You've addressed
some of this already, but there is more to being auditor
than determining whether it is acceptable to purchase a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

that could be charged and going to the client and bringing

particular good or service, using municipal funds. Describe
for us how you view the role and what value you think it
brings to the organization?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Well, I think the value it brings
12
Packet Pg. 1084

7

in the role that brings is in the position of auditor, you
are responsible for the financial reporting, the internal
controls, the making sure that everything gets reported

the City Council, but it's also representing the finance
staff and really the constituents to see that the money
that is being allotted to be spent is spent properly and
it, it's spent in accordance with the intentions of the
people who have given the directive of how it is spent.
So, it's an in to me, the auditor is an
independent set of eyes and ears that basically look out
for the best interest of the council the -- and finest
department in the City of Cambridge. And myself too because
I have a CPA license that also I need to keep current and,
and follow the rules and regulations of that.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

accurately and timely and it's representing not only you as

Thank you, Madam

Mayor through you. Good morning. Uh, please discuss your
experience overseeing the compilation of the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report and your familiarity with
13
Packet Pg. 1085

7

implementing new Governmental Accounting Standards Board
pronouncements.
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Well, when I started here last

completion of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. I
have a wide array of experience, going back to my audit
days and then up to including my days at the various, um,
public authorities that I had. Mass Port does a CAFR or the
ACFR now.
So that -- there's a lot of experience with
preparing those documents. The document here is more
cumbersome than some of the others because municipal
finance has a lot of nuances that quasi-state agencies do
not have.
But I was responsible for making sure that the
numbers as I rolled up through the comprehensive system of
financial reporting that they all tied together that the
numbers could be substantiated with supporting schedules.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

year, I jumped right into the financial reporting and the

And that they all made sense in relation to other
documents that are filed: school reporting, grant
reporting, uh, Department of Revenue Reporting and the City
Financial Ledgers that are ultimately the records of the
14
Packet Pg. 1086

7

City.
So, my financial reporting, I think I'm very
detail-oriented person. So, making sure that everything

schedules is very critical and that, as you can imagine.
In addition to that, the government reporting is
becoming more complicated day-by-day. In the past year, we
had to implement, uh, Fiduciary Fund Statement which took a
lot of what the agency funds and move them into fiduciary
funds.
And those funds were a lot of the trust funds,
cemetery trust, scholarship funds, et cetera, and those
were handled differently. So, we had to reconfigure a lot
of the report before it was issued. This year we have a
lease pronouncement that will also change the way the City
and also just all governments handle their lease reporting.
So, there's a never-ending number of
pronouncements that changed this on a going forward basis.

applications help improve the operations?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Thank you. The first and foremost

was, uh, Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs on
PeopleSoft, which is the same system as the City. Back,
2012, we did a full system upgrade which was financial
reporting accounts, payable accounts receivable, um, grant
reporting, et cetera. I was responsible for all the
financial aspects of that upgrade.
At the same time, I was also responsible for a
complete rewrite of the chart of accounts for the entire
authority. This rewrite was -- the purpose was to expand
the chart of accounts to give us better and more detailed

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

you tell us about a time you have been involved in an

financial reporting. A lot of the information that was in
the system from prior periods and prior years had to be
converted and updated, proofed, reproofed and made sure
that it came over accurately.
16
Packet Pg. 1088

7

That was the biggest project throughout my
career, there have constantly been upgrades to different
modules, different payroll systems that payroll upgrades

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

pretty intense because as a Chapter 32 under the pension
system you have a lot of nuances that the rest of the
country does not have and working with the Payroll
Department and the consultants, they were all successful.
Did that answer your question?

Chair. Through you to our candidate. First of all, thank
you for putting your name in as a candidate to be
considered for this position. I really appreciate that.
I'll be thinking my question.
If you're hired for this position, will -- you
will be a department head and responsible for managing
several employees. Please describe for us your supervisory
experience and management style?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

My supervisory, uh, experience,

it goes back. Mass -- Mass Massachusetts Port Authority had

group, all walks of life, various ages.
The management style is very open. I have a very

treat everybody the same. Uh, I try to believe in cross
training people, working with people.
We all have different problems that arise,
unforeseen problems and working with everyone's individual
needs so that we can keep a strong team together, working
as a team to complete the end job as timely and as
accurately as possible because we do have time constraints
in this position and all of our positions we have, I have
held, there have been some degree of time constraints, but
I think, in a nutshell, open and honest and treating
everyone fairly.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Ok. Well, thank

you, uh, that was a very thorough answer. Madam Mayor, I
yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

open-door policy. Very honest. I treat everyone fairly. I

In your previous

experience, what ways have you demonstrated commitment to
the importance of def -- diversity, equity and inclusion?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Well, I think one thing I've
18
Packet Pg. 1090

7

always like to pride myself on is, I think it's very
important to cross-train people within your group, first
and foremost. And that allows people to grow within the

at lower levels moving forward.
When it comes to hiring, I, I believe you should
try to hire inside, not just because of this position, but
I think there are some values to be had, but looking at all
candidates, whether they're internal or external and put
the best candidates forward.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. Councillor

Toner.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Good morning. Um,

given your understanding of the Auditing Department, what
are some changes or improvements you would want to explore
if you ended up in the position of City Auditor?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Changes - I'd like to explore.

Um, Jim has done a great job. Um, so it's they're big shoes

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

group, to build the best team possible and to keep people

to fill. But I think, along the lines, we have some
upgrades, some system up -- changes that we're working on
even today in the area of fixed assets, in the area of
accounts payable. I'd like to see some of those go forward.
19
Packet Pg. 1091

7

Um, when I say, fixed assets, the reporting on
fixed assets is a lot of assets in the City that go into
the construction and process and then are moved over to in

automatic basis when they're completed, trying to get the
information in the system with contract numbers, purchase
order numbers, et cetera. So, there's not as much manual
review at audit time to pick up on some of those costs to
make sure they're in the right spot.
From accounts payable perspective, I think
there's some more scanning and some more, um, some more
automation that we can pick up in some of the documentation
that gets handled several times. We've got a lot of it that
we scan and that we keep electronically filed, but there's
more work that can be done.
And it -- also on top of that, on the financial
reporting side, I think we can make some modification, try
to better utilize the system to automatically create some

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes, go ahead.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Great. Thanks

so much. The world of municipal finance is constantly

regulatory requirements and evolving trends?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Uh, yes. As I mentioned earlier,

I'm a CPA in Massachusetts. Every two years you have to
renew your license and with that renewal, you require
documentation of 80 credit hours of continuing education.
That is a requirement to keep my certificate and my license
up-to-date and I participate in that every two years.
In addition to that, uh, we're members of the
GFOA, there's the Mass Society of CPAs, there's the public
accounting firm that we can utilize, looking to make sure
that we're up-to- date.
So, there's various mechanisms to keep up-to-date
for the current events and seeing that we haven't missed
anything that would require a change to the reporting that

If you became City Auditor, could you tell us what you

JOSEPH MCCANN:

In my first six months, I'd like

to -- I'd like to accomplish some of the, um, changes
within the system that I just mentioned to Councillor Toner
and I think those would be very e -- easy to do. Um, the
first six months, coming into the fiscal year end, there's
a lot of financial reporting that needs to be done to the
DOR, school reporting, getting the grant reporting in line,
the financial reporting.
So, I'd like to make sure that that is thoroughly
reviewed in any type of streamlining or automation we could
enhance I'd like to try to implement within that first six
months so that this fiscal year's audit is done timely and
accurately. And we also have the implementation, as I
mentioned of the CASB 87 related to, uh, lease reporting.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, ma --

Thank you Madam Mayor. And so, in closing, is there

let us know about, um, so that we would consider it when
we're considering you for this opportunity?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

Well, as I mentioned, Jim, I

think has done a great job, big shoes to fill. I think
because of my professional background, I think it would be
in, in my position here over the last year, it would lead
to a seamless transition.
I think I'm qualified to keep your interest in
the forefront to protect the City of Cambridge, to make
sure that the funds and the finances continue to be kept in
checks and balances and watched over with a very high
degree of accuracy in relation to financial reporting,
internal controls.
In addition, we didn't talk about this, but I

So, I think that would also allow a seamless
transition as Jim comes off of the, [clears throat] excuse
me, comes off of the Retirement Board and there'd be a

But I look forward to working with the strong
team that we have downstairs, working with the Mayor, the
Council and everyone in this room. And I think,
collectively, it would be a, a team that would be strong
and that we could continue going forward in the same nature
that Jim has 22 years experience of and confidence that
he's given the City.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. Do Councillors

have any additional questions that they'd like to ask?
Councillor Carlone?
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, more, perhaps,

more a comment, Mr. McCann. Uh, those of us who got to know
Jim, like him, um, but we hardly ever saw him because
things are running smoothly downstairs. It might make

sense, um, to have -- to offer people the opportunity to
come in and just talk about priorities or how you look at
things.
Um, I was one of only two Councillors last term
24
Packet Pg. 1096

7

that saw him and spoke to him and, um, I also think it
would make sense at the end of the fiscal year to have a
summary report saying, everything is fine hopefully and

my close to 9 years on the council.
And I think the more we see each other, even if
it's only those times, it makes us more familiar with what
the auditor's office is doing and how we're part of one
team. So, it's just a comment. It's not a question. It's,
it's just an observation. Thank you. Thank you, Madam,
Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you,

Madam Mayor and through you, um, as City Auditor would,
would you be involved at all or would you be able to advise
the Council and the City Administration on our efforts to
divest from fossil fuels?
JOSEPH MCCANN:

I think that's part of the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

giving a summary statement. Um, that has never happened in

investment policy which this position is involved in. And I
believe that great strides have been made to do that, um,
with both the City level and the retirement level, I
believe at this point. But, yes, we could continue down
25

that road and I think that's part of this from an oversight
of the Investment Committee.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Great. Thank

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any additional questions?

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Yes, Madam Chair,

just, uh, a follow-up on the diversity, um, question. As,
as you probably know, uh, through you to the Chair to the
applicant that the City has worked really hard, is working
hard and is moving in the direction of diversity, inclusion
and equity.
And you did speak earlier about you, you had a
very diverse staff. Um, could you kind of, uh, just restate
or further the state, um, in terms of -- because there's
two things that you said that were very interesting. I want
to make sure people were moved through the ranks.
Uh, and I have worked with a diverse staff, what
would be some of the tools and skills that you might bring

to do just that as openings, um, come to -- into your

JOSEPH MCCANN:

Well, I think you'd have to look
26
Packet Pg. 1098

7

at the candidates individually or the employees within the
department. When I talk about teamwork and cross-training,
to me, one aspect of cross-training allows an individual

detailed, uh, workings within the department. And with that
being said, I think it helps to promote upward mobility
either within the department or just within the
organization.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Ok. That's

helpful. Thank you so much. Madam Chair, I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. So, at this

time, I don't have any other questions, so we'll open it up
to a general, uh, discussion. So, uh, Mr. McCann, you can
go back, uh, to the audience, uh, seats. Thank you for
answering our questions. At this point. this is, uh, a
conversation about -- this is our discussion and then from
there, uh, I will ask what the will of the body is. So, I
see Vice Mayor Mallon's hand up and then Councillor

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

process, uh Sheila Keady Rawson did do some reference
27

checks and had some very glowing things to say about, uh,
Mr. McCann.
And I just wanted to remind Councillors that Ms.

questions on the reference checks, um and what those turned
up, uh, in a general sense, she would be more than happy to
answer any questions that we may have. So, if anybody is
interested in that, please raise your hand,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

And indeed, Madam

Mayo, uh, through you to the Vice Mayor. That was my, uh,
comment to hear that. Uh, I thought Mr. McCann addressed
the questions very professionally and, um, my guess is the
references will support that, but I would love to hear
that. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

If we can hear, uh, the

references, I'll have, um, Ms. Sheila Keady Rawson coming
up, come up and then I'll go to Councillor Bur --Azeem, uh,

PERSONNEL DIRECTOR SHEILA KEADY RAWSON:

7

Mr. McCann were, um, quite glowing. Um, I spoke to his
current supervisor, I spoke to colleagues here in the City
of Cambridge and I spoke to, um, former colleagues that he

Um, the things that came forward were his
approachability and his willingness to go the extra mile to
do research in terms of, you know, complex topics. Um, he - the person that he supervised, um, talked about how he
would regularly have one-on-one coaching sessions with his
employees, um, and would recommend to them various, um,
education opportunities and help them try to seek out the
resources for those education opportunities, whether they
were they were webinars or courses or other ways in the
financial industry to um go after certifications or degrees
that might in fact help them advance.
Um, there was, um, definitely a sense that his
abilities, both as an external auditor and as an internal
auditor were valuable so that he can see both sides when

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

had supervised in previous roles.

these sort of internal control meetings are coming about.
Um, and because he had worked for the City of Cambridge
previously, and now it felt like he had a very good
understanding of the systems that we use, the people
29

involved with those systems and the processes, and
protocols that were involved.

Um, first, I just wanted to, um, originally, also ask for
the references. It's wonderful to hear that and I
appreciate that. Um, I just wanted to give my thoughts as a
member of the committee that, uh, was looking at the
candidates that I thought that Mr. McCann was a wonderful
candidate.
And, you know, before working for the City, he
had worked for the Water Resources Agent -- uu, Authority,
working as a Comptroller over a budget of $800 million and
then Chief Financial Athor -- Officer at the Turnpike
Authority of a budget of 400 million and then a Comptroller

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

at the Massachusetts Port Authority, overseeing a budget of
about 800 million, all of which is in line with the budget
of the City.
And so, I thought it was a very valuable
30

7

experience. On top of that, um, the great references and
among members of the committee, um, I think we all had a
pretty, um, wonderful opinions of him. So, I was very

wanted to iterate that support on the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Um I, I think, um, Mr. McCann is, is an
excellent and highly qualified candidate and I would be
delighted to support him today. Um, as, as our new City
Auditor, I would like to understand a little bit more about
what other, uh, candidates applied in. You know, how, how
we came to be, uh in, in this position where we have only
one finalist,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Mayor.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to my colleague, we did an internal
posting as we understood that there were several members of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

impressed with the candidate, both then and today, and just

the auditing department who were interested in being
promoted from within. So, we wanted to do an internal
posting prior to going external. Uh, Mr. McCann was the
only applicant, uh, in the internal posting.
31
Packet Pg. 1103

7

And the ad hoc committee met with Mr. McCann and,
I think, at that time, we decided as a group not to move
forward with an external, um, posting at that time because

experience and background and, um, thought that he would be
a wonderful addition or continued addition to the auditing
department as City Auditor.
So, I know it's unusual to have one, uh,
candidate or I, I understand we have [laughs] two positions
today, where there's only one candidate, but because we
wanted -- it's such a highly specific job, uh, both in the
City of Cambridge and, you know, in the State of
Massachusetts, I think we really wanted to just consider
our internal, our internal applicants first. And we really
thought we got a strong candidate in the internal applicant
pool. So, we decided not to move forward with an external
applicant pool.
So, I hope that answers your questions. But I'm,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

we were so impressed with this candidate and his, uh,

I'm happy to, to continue the conversation if it didn't

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you I, I concur that we would be hard
32

7

for us to find a more qualified candidate, uh, than Mr.
McCann. Um, But I, I do think it, it would be useful in, in
the future to make sure that we go out to the, to the

we have multiple candidates, uh, to consider. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam

with the Vice Mayor. I think, um, you know, I think
generally speaking, I, I, I know it's somewhat
uncomfortable to -- for folks to have only one candidate,
but when that one candidate, um, is exceptional and
probably would be the best choice whether we had one
candidate here or, or several candidates here.
Um, I think this was a, uh, -- I'm very
comfortable as having served on that committee, um, you
know, moving forward, and uh, I think, uh, you know, having
Mr. McCann step up into the auditor position would actually

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

broader market to, you know, increase the possibility that

be a great benefit for the City and we would be hard
pressed to find, uh, uh, a better person for the job at
this time. Thank you.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

I'd be happy to

say as someone who is on the search committee, I just agree

that ordinarily and I, we asked ourselves, uh, is there a
reason for us to do an external search?
And the reality is, in this situation when we
have a department of the audit department that has been
performing very well, that has been meeting all the goals
of the City Council and serving us in a, in a way that is
exactly what you want an auditor to do, which is keeping us
on track, being very low key.
We don't want to hear from the auditor because it
means they're keeping us, uh, on a path of, uh, fiscal
responsibility and ensuring that everything is done
correct. This is exactly the type of job where dotting the
i's and crossing the t's are the heart of the job and this
has been done very well by that department.

with what the, the Vice Mayor and Councillor Azeem said

It just made a lot of sense to, to me as a member

Councillor Azeem noted to just move forward with one

supporting his candidacy today.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Anyone else? One question

I had was, uh, just to the Vi, Vice Mayor. As far as I

focus on internal, but if we were to -- had done an
external as far as posting, is there kind of like an
Association of Auditors? Is it -- I'm sure it's not that
simple, but was there any, um, information on that?
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

I think, um,

through you, to you, uh, that's a question for, um, Ms. and
where an internal uh an external auditing position would be
posted? I think, you know, we've been talking a lot about
the city manager search.
I think a lot of those places um are also
applicable and when you think about, you know, Mass
Municipal Association, things of that nature. Um but I, I'm
not sure if that answers your question or if you wanted to
have Ms. Keady Rawson, uh, continue to answer.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Um, so

right now, actually there's a huge challenge in
Massachusetts in terms of finding, um, finance people,

finance. Um, the areas that we would most likely explore
would be the Mass Municipal Association, the Mass Fiscal
Officers Association, the Government Finance Officers
Association.
Um, and then we would use, um, some of our other
resources to look for other affinity groups that might
have, um, other candidates that have fiscal accounting or
audit experience in a municipal setting. Massachusetts
tends to be pretty quirky in terms of its fiscal rules so
having someone that understands Massachusetts would be very
important.

based on those comments, I just wanted to confirm, uh,
what, uh, Sheila said, um, that the MMA orientation for new

a presentation on finance said, hold on to your finance
people, there's nobody out there. Uh, If you've got good
people in-house, make sure you keep them.

uh, promote from within when we, we have the opportunity.
So, I'm thankful that we had somebody internally and we
didn't have to do an exorbitant search to find someone who
will do a good job as auditor. Thank you, I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, through the

Chair to my, uh, to my colleagues and Ms. Sheila Keady
Rawson. Uh, I certainly understand as someone who's worked
for the City, uh, and has always said there is value from
promoting from within.
I'm very satisfied and pleased in, in some ways
that we -- pleased in ways, I won't say some ways, that we
have -- we are in -- considering hiring from within. Uh,
and I, I say that particularly because I've heard from this

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Um, I also, I'm very happy that we're able to,

Council's on own lips, "Uh, we don't want anyone from
inside to apply."
So, I, I'm pleased that we, at least, in some
instances find that valuable. Um, in terms of looking
37
Packet Pg. 1109

7

outside, um, I don't know intimately the role of this, uh,
this, this type of job in terms of what networks and
organizations. We are also responsive to a larger

And what I would never want this gentleman,
should he be chosen as the candidate and then the person
takes this position have his extraordinary expertise
questioned because we, we didn't look outside. So, there's
the value of looking outside as this. Actually, this
council has said in another iteration to prove the value of
the person that is actually rosen, risen to the top.
So that being said, uh, again, I, I have no
reservations. I did not participate in the process. So, I'm
not gonna try to second guess it. But I do want to at least
mention the realities is, you know, there's one thing to
say, well, there's no one out there, no place to look and
then but have looked and said, after making a search, we
came up, uh, empty, but we have an extraordinary candidate

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

community.

from within.
I think sometimes takes any cloud that may hang
over the very able candidate because that was not done. So
please, I'm gonna repeat. So, people understand I am in
38
Packet Pg. 1110

7

full support of hiring from within and I'm glad that we
have found a ex, extraordinary candidate to appoint, should
that be the will of the council.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

There's also value in having looked outside to
say, "And we looked outside and when we -- no one was that
the pool was insufficient because of the type of job and
the specialty that it is or no one could compare." Uh, and
that'd be a nice thing to say in here to the candidates
that we had inside.
So, something for us to think of. Hopefully, uh,
again, if the candidate before us is the candidate that we
hire, we will not be looking for an auditor anytime soon,
but we should be mindful of that. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any other comments,

questions, discussion that the Council would like to have?
So, the -- really next order of business is, it's what the
will of the body is. If there's a motion to appoint Mr.
McCann to the Office of City Auditor.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Can you put

forward a motion if there's no further discussion that the
Council unanimously of that's -- I don't know if we do this
by roll call. I guess we will because I'm not present that,
39

uh, the co move forward, that the Council, uh, move forward
the appointment of Mr. McCann as the new City Auditor.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Sure. Uh, thank you,

Madam Mayor. Uh, just very briefly for the public's sake.
Uh, the job description for Clerk was posted, uh, on
February 28th, 2022. Uh, Sheila Keady Rawson, Director of
Personnel distributed the posting, uh, to the -- to, uh, a
variety of organizations, uh, externally.
Uh, it was also promoted on social media and the
City's website, Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the
City Council accepted resumes until May 1st, 2022 and
prepared, prepared them for review by the initial search
committee.
As of May 1st, 2022, there were 32 total external
applicants. There were no internal applicants. The
committee selected 10 applicants for an initial interview,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

of these 2 interview -- 2 candidates accepted other
positions and withdrew, uh, their applications. Uh, we
proceeded with 8 candidates for a first round of
interviews. The committee identified 4 candidates for a
43
Packet Pg. 1115

7

second round of interviews.
After concluding the second round of interviews,
the committee identified and invited 2 finalist candidates

May 16th, 2022, after being invited to the inetive -interview with the full City Council, one of our finalists
withdrew their candidacy prior to, uh, being name, their
name being made public. Uh, this is, uh, a challenge
sometimes with public search processes.
Um, although we had hoped to present the Full
City Council with two excellent candidates to consider, uh,
we are confident in moving forward with our recommendation
of Ms. Diane LeBlanc as a candidate for the position of
Cambridge City Clerk. Naomie Stephen also completed a
background and reference checks. Uh, I do want to thank all
the members of the screening committee for their
participation.
My Co-chair Council Simmons, Councillors McGovern

Assistant So -- Solicitor for the time they put in, uh, uh,
in this search. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I, I don't know if
my Co-Chair has anything to add. Uh, Councillor Simmons.
Uh, thank you Co-

Chair Toner. Through the Chair, to my colleagues. Uh, this
was an extraordinary well-run process. Uh, just a couple of
things, not to reiterate what my colleague has done, but I
do want to acknowledge, um, uh, Councillor Toner being -this being his very first term hit the ground running, did
an extra extraordinary job.
We worked very collaboratively together. I look
forward to other opportunities of working with him. I also
wanna just say, in terms of our applicant pool as
Councillor Toner Co-chair Toner said, we had 32 external
candidates.
We had, we had a very diverse, uh, group of
candidates, diverse by race, by language, by gender, by age
and by experience. One of the things that we also thought

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

was very important and I thank Councillor Toner and the
committee for their support was we did have an anti-bias
training workshop prior to, uh, looking at our candidates.
I hope my colleagues and, in fact, they do
45
Packet Pg. 1117

7

believe, but they can correct me. They are, they're in the
room. They found that that was very helpful to kind of talk
about anti-bias, going into a hiring process and how it's

of baggage you bring into the room when you're getting
ready to embark on a hiring process.
This is also very unique for the City Council. We
have three positions that we are hiring for, which is in my
number -- x number of years of service to the council has
never happened. And so, uh, again, very well-done process,
very, uh, diverse, uh, group of individuals, the staff we
worked with, um, from the personal office were very good.
And a very, very strong, um, word to, uh, Ms.
Naomie Stephen. Ms. Stephen is, is the Admin -- Executive
Assistant, uh, for the City Council. Uh, but she just did
extraordinary work. And the reason why I say, extraordinary
is because she's also has her part -- her role in the City
Manager search has, uh, some -- a role in the auditor's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

so important to acknowledge what kind of biases, what kind

search, I think far less, but just doing all of that and
still making sure the office ran well. So, I just want to
personally thank, um, Ms. Stephen for her, her work in
this.
46
Packet Pg. 1118

7

Again. I, I am very pleased and I hope my
colleagues on the council and the members that served on
this committee, uh, felt -- feel likewise that we did have

worked very hard. We laughed a little so, uh, it wasn't all
arduous work.
Uh, so I, uh, engaged, -- uh, I agree, not
engaged with my Co-chair that a very hearty thanks to the
members of the, uh, screening committee, applicant
screening committee, uh, for their hard, hard work. I yield
the floor, Madam Mayor,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, uh, to you

both for the overview. Uh, with that, I, I would like to
welcome you up. And what we'll do is we'll begin with our
final round interview questions for City Clerk. We'll have
Councillor Toner go first, followed by Councillor McGovern.
DIANE LEBLANC:

Thank you. Thank you, Madam

Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the council. Thank you for

a very rich process, a very diverse applicant pool. We, we

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you. Good

morning, Miss LeBlanc. Thank you for participating in this,
uh, process that has lasted for a couple of months and, uh,
47
Packet Pg. 1119

7

hanging in there with us. Uh, I have the first question.
Uh, please take a few minutes to briefly tell us about
yourself and your work experience and how you think these

what attracts you to this position at this time in your
career?
DIANE LEBLANC:

Okay. Well, I'm currently, uh, a

City Clerk in, in Lawrence, but I'm gonna go back to the
beginning if you will. Um, my first professional position
was with the Federal Government, the National Archives and
Records Administration. It was my co-op job from
Northeastern University. So, I started there when I was 19years-old and literally grew up in the organization.
Um, I throughout -- I'm a, I'm a big proponent of
hiring internally. I was the benefit of, uh, internal
hiring. Um, but I competed for every position, uh, that I
ever got and I believe I got it based upon my merit. Um, my
first major role, uh, in a managerial supervisory capacity

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

experiences have prepared you for this position, but also

was as the Assistant Director of the Federal Record Center
located in Waltham, Massachusetts. It was a division so I
was an Assistant Director of a division. I eventually
became the director of that division.
48
Packet Pg. 1120

7

And then at one point with the National Archives,
there was a major reorganization, the most significant the
agency had ever seen and the creation of a regional

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

structure, which actually brought together all of the, uh,
staff and facilities, um, in New England, New York, New
Jersey and customer base in Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands. Um, I became the Regional Administrator. I served
in that capacity for 12 years.
Um, then a new archivist of the United States
came in and he went with a different structure. He
dismantled the regions and went back to the old structure.
Uh, so after that reorganization, my last assignment with
the National Archives and Records Administration was as a
special assistant to the director, who was based in
Washington, responsible for every presidential library
across the country.
Now, concurrent with my responsibilities as the
Regional Administrator, even as the director and assistant
director, um, of the division, I was also active as part of
my federal work with an organization called the Greater
Boston Federal Executive Board. And during my tenure with
the Federal Government, I, uh, served in various capacities
49
Packet Pg. 1121

7

there as well.
I think my first leadership role with that board
was as, uh, the Chair of the Women's Opportunity Committee.

well, uh, serve as their Vice Chair for a number of years
and ultimately, uh, serve as their Chair.
Um, I left federal service after 37 amazing,
truly blessed years and I was a City Councillor for my last
few years of federal employment and I became a full-time
City Councillor, if you will, and I loved it. And 10 years
I served, again, loved my community.
I've lived in Waltham for most of my life and
then I ran for Mayor and I was not successful in that
venture, but it was a wonderful, wonderful experience and I
have no regrets. My intent was to enjoy the holidays with
my family. Uh, take a few months to decompress and get back
out there into the workforce. There were different plans.
COVID hit, my mother passed.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

But ultimately, I would move up in that organization as

She was the second person to pass in my
community, Waltham. And I also, uh, got the virus back in
April of 2020. So, during the COVID period, I was home like
many people and as soon as things began to open up again,
50
Packet Pg. 1122

7

um, I took advantage of that downtime, if you will.
Um, and said, "Okay, what am I gonna do now?"
I've had my federal career and the answer was I loved

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

municipal government and once it hit me, it really hit me.
I was the Federal Record Keeper for the Northeast part of
the country. Who's the record keeper for municipalities?
That's the City Clerk.
I loved being a City Councillor. I loved the
process. I loved the engagement. I loved being part of
that. The role of a City Clerk seemed to be the perfect
fit. So, I set my goals there. I joined the various
associations. I, at my own expense, took a weeklong um,
training course, which was remote at the time. And I
applied for a position with the, uh, wonderful City of
Lawrence, Massachusetts. And they hired me and I have been
there not quite 10 months.
So how do I find myself here? Um, I was not
looking for a job. Let me take a sip of water. I was not
looking for a job. I love the City of Lawrence. I love my
staff. I enjoy my morning conversations with the Council
President and I love being of service to their new Mayor in
his administration. But Lawrence is 62 miles from Waltham;
51
Packet Pg. 1123

7

31 miles, um, each way.
So, I've been troubled by my carbon footprint for
a while. Uh, but, again, I wanted a job, I needed to work

This job was brought to my attention by a current
City Clerk who is a friend, uh, who knows me very well. And
they sent me a text message and said, the Cambridge City
Clerk position is open and I thought, oh, wow.
Um, as a Councillor, I followed the work being
done here in Cambridge, I followed your leadership on
important matters of Affordable Housing and Sustainability
and Equity and I struggled with it for a little bit because
I hadn't been in Lawrence that long. But then I said,
opportunities like this just don't come along that often.
So, I sent my 20-page resume in. Not the
traditional resume. That's a federal version of a resume,
by the way. And I was very grateful for the call. So that's
what brings me here.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

and they wanted me, I took it and I was grateful for it.

We'll go to Council

McGovern.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you. Good

morning. Uh, It's a two-part question. So, I'll ask both.
52
Packet Pg. 1124

7

But if you need me to repeat, just let me know since your
first interview, you have had time to watch a few of our
City Council and Council Committee meetings as well as the

After watching these and considering the
information you have learned through the process, what are
your impressions about Cambridge and particularly our City
Council meeting process? What, if any, are some
recommendations you would propose to improve how City
Council meetings are conducted?
DIANE LEBLANC:

So, I have watched more meetings.

I have watched the State of the City. Um, certainly the
State of the City and, um, the City Manager's address as
well as the Mayor's address confirmed what I knew about the
City of Cambridge and what was important to you, what your
values were and, and what you were looking to accomplish.
Um, I love that Cambridge has been a leader and
at the same time you're not satisfied with the work that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

State of the City Address via our website.

you've done. Um, you know that there is more good work to
be done around Affordable Housing and other important
issues and there's a sense of urgency.
Um, I like that sense of urgency because what I
53
Packet Pg. 1125

7

have sometimes found is that people will say, of the
legislative process, "Oh, it's like, you know, watching
sausage be made; it needs to take forever," and they accept

Um, that's not necessarily who I am at my core. I
like for things to get done and I think that things are
getting done here. So, it would be a privilege to be able
to be a part of that in some small way by supporting, um,
the leadership.
Now with regard to the process, because that was
a question that I was asked in, in one of the other
interviews. Your process ap, appears to work well. And,
again, I've got some comparisons, other communities and
everything is relative.
Um, your technology here works as well as I've
seen it work, um, in any other community. Um, I, I have
tremendous respect from what I've seen of, of Clerk Wilson,
who has led the City Clerk's office during a very, very

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

that.

difficult time.
Um, but there's always a way to improve process
and, and you, you did bring some things out to me. Um, you
were very candid during the interview process. And so, I
54
Packet Pg. 1126

7

would need to take a closer look. I would, we need to have
one-on-one conversations with each of you because clearly,
you're asking this question so you think that there's room

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

for improvement.
So together we need to figure out where that. I
know that one of the things that I struggle with now as a
City Clerk and I think City Clerks across the Commonwealth
struggle with is just, um, noticing getting your public
hearing notices in newspapers, right? Because they're not
daily print anymore.
Um, I firmly believe that there's a path forward
for communities that with appropriate changes and perhaps
legislation, we could begin to post those notices online.
Right.
And I understand that there are state laws and
whatnot, but this is a problem for communities across the
commonwealth. Um, so I love the opportunity and I love the
fact that you are open to changing the process if through
our conversations, we deem that's necessary. But, again,
nothing from what I have watched just jumps right out at me
is this is a glaring issue.

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

As a City, Cambridge

aims to provide excellent customer service. Tell us about
your approach to working with members of the public,

DIANE LEBLANC:

Okay. So, customer service, I

think if you were to go back and talk to some of my
colleagues, um, at the federal level, right? The Federal
Executive Board and, uh, certainly at the National Archives
and, and even, though a short tenure in Lawrence, in
Lawrence, they will say, Diane LeBlanc is committed to
exceptional customer service, crazy, extreme, wild customer
service. What would that look like here?
I don't know because I don't know what level
you're at. Um, I did notice that in putting, um, in writing
the performance measures for the next fiscal year that
customer service, improving customer service was noted as
something that the Clerk, the Clerk's office and this body
was looking, um, to pursue.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

especially in dealing with challenging situations?

So, again, just going back to the National
Archives, both as a Regional Administrator and then when I
moved over to the Office of Presidential Libraries, um,
multiple divisions sort of within that structure, but I
56
Packet Pg. 1128

7

always looked at each division, at each entity and, and,
and found a way working with the staff to create feedback
loops for customers, right?

we going to improve the process? What does this process
look like to the person watching at home? Right. What does
that individual say? Oh, my goodness, why are they doing
that? What doesn't make sense?
So, I would look to, uh, first off, I would look
to see what customer standards you have in place in terms
of your basic things that the Clerk's office does. You're
providing great customer service; you're providing vital
records within a very quick turnaround time.
So, you look at each area and you see how we can
do better at the National Archives. Our, our goal to
delight every customer was posted and it was well-known,
one of the biggest challenges that National Archives
facilities had across the country was in getting re, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Um, we're, we're talking about, you know, how are

agencies to part with their records right to getting the
courts to, you know, don't clutter up your offices.
There is a federal system in place that allows
you to send your records somewhere and they're going to be
57
Packet Pg. 1129

7

serviced and they're gonna be serviced within 24 hours. And
if you need somebody to call you and deliver the
information over the phone, we're gonna do it just getting

office, the FBI all of the federal agencies that you can
imagine was difficult.
One of the things I did was I established a
program of open houses and we would invite the customers in
to see our operation to meet our staff to hear about how we
delivered exceptional customer service. I also gave them an
open invitation. Ok? Anybody can look good when you know
somebody is coming, you have an open invitation to come see
us any time that we are open and go visit your records,
right?
So, there's many, many ways that, uh, customer
service, exceptional customer service, uh, can manifest
itself and I would look forward to bringing that here to
the City of Cambridge.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you,

Madam Mayor. Clerk LeBlanc, It's good to see you again.
58
Packet Pg. 1130

7

Sorry, I'm not there to greet you in person, but it's a
pleasure to have you in front of us. Um, my question, uh,
and, and you know me, it's always multifaceted.

to read it again, I'd be more than glad to, uh, diversity,
equity and inclusion are key values in Cambridge. How does
DEI: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion inform your work.
The second part of that is, can you describe a
time when you've tried to help your team become more
inclusive or a situation where you have identified a
practice that could be changed to eliminate implicit bias.
And then lastly, what did you learn in that process? Can we
go back to the topic? Can you describe a time -- oh, I'm
sorry, how does the diversity, equity, and inclusion inform
your work?
DIANE LEBLANC:

So, one of the documents that I

provided as an example of a written communication, um, to
the search committee was opening remarks that I had given

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

So, I will read it once. And if you would like me

at a Diversity Day program, when I chaired the Greater
Boston Federal Executive Board. And I am very, very proud
of the leadership role that I played.
Um, the Federal Executive Board was made up of
59
Packet Pg. 1131

7

the agency heads in the area and we met on a regular basis
and diversity inclusion was one of my main focuses. So, we
discussed what does this mean for the federal workforce?

And, and many of the larger agencies at the time
had what were called Special Emphasis Programs and they
have them today and they are important, they celebrate
cultural awareness and the different months and, and and
they raise awareness.
But under my leadership, diversity discussions
went to a different level. We need to do more than just
have celebrations. We need to be providing our managers and
train and, and, and supervisors with real training to
understand, right? Discrimination is illegal, right? I
mean, that's pretty clear and, and everybody says, "Oh,
well, you know, we're inclusive and, and, and we're aware
when we hire", but then you don't see the federal workforce
changing.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Right?

You see the numbers still low with regard to the
Hispanic population, you see the numbers still low with
regard to the disabled population. I led those discussions
at the federal level. We had hard discussions, we brought
60
Packet Pg. 1132

7

real training to managers and supervisors.
I also created something called a campaign to
promote public service, which went into high schools in

communities. Right?
And a high school could, could reach out to us
and get a federal speaker at a very high level to come in
and to talk to their students about, you know, this is who
we are in the Federal Government and we want for you to
think about working for us. And of course, every high
school wanted the head of the FBI to come.
Um, but once they got by that, I personally went
out into these high schools as, as somebody responsible for
hiring, again, my New York office, um, my Waltham office,
my Pittsfield office, I hired always minorities.
I was the first to hire African Americans in any
of our locations. Um, and always a commitment to hiring.
Um, so in, and even in Lawrence. Right.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Massachusetts and specifically high schools in under-served

So, so fast forward, um, to the City of Lawrence
when I went there, I mean, just some of the things that
were most obvious to me was the physical layout of the City
Clerk's office. It wasn't ADA compliant, right? It wasn't a
61
Packet Pg. 1133

7

welcoming environment to individuals in, in wheelchairs.
So, I've taken action to move that forward. In
Lawrence, I was responsible for elections. I am responsible

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

for elections. Our voting booths weren't ADA compliant,
right? It might sound like a small thing, but we just put
in a purchase order for $24,000 of voting booths that are
ADA compliant. So, we will have an ADA compliant voting
booth at every precinct, come September.
Um, in terms of identifying things where there's
an implicit bias. I looked at the application for poll
workers and I have no idea when it was created. Um, but it
asked for people's age, it asked for people's sex. It was
just grossly outdated. It had nothing to do with what you
need to know as, as a hiring person.
And so, I worked with the staff to come up with,
"Okay, what do we really need to know about somebody that
we're interested in as a poll worker?" And I created that
and then I sent it to the Assistant City Solicitor to make
sure that there was no implicit bias in that.
Um, another small example recently in the City of
Lawrence, a couple of the staff members, um, asked if maybe
we could stop taking cash, right, and only take credit
62
Packet Pg. 1134

7

cards. And that was a good opportunity for me to, you know,
have a conversation about how that might be, um, a
discriminatory practice. So, I am very sensitive to this

So, what did I learn? And, and I said this, I
think during one of the, the interviews, I've learned that
it's very, very hard to change people's hearts and that you
need to create safe spaces for people to have hard
conversations.
But it's not hard to follow the rules. And if
you're a hiring manager, right? Discrimination is
discrimination. It's not hard to look at every practice, to
look at every policy consciously through the lens of, "Is
this in any way discriminatory?"
And, and, and I see that as the responsibility of
everybody in Municipal Government, especially department
heads. I hope that answers your multifaceted question.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Clerk LeBlanc, as

this question relates to that.
Please tell us about your experience
participating in and managing public meetings, your
knowledge of parliamentary procedure, the Massachusetts
Open Meeting Law and Ordination process.
DIANE LEBLANC:

Ok. Um, well, thank you for that.

And yes, almost 10 months in the City of, of Lawrence. Um,
but let's go back to parliamentary procedure first if
that's ok. Uh, my first experience being responsible for
using Robert's Rules was, uh, when I was in high school and
I was elected the president of my Junior Achievement
Company and I was told that I would need to run board
meetings using Robert's Rules.
We also used Robert's Rules; we had our own, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

position is -- has been occupied for about 10 months. So,

by-laws, the Greater Boston Federal Executive Board. Uh,
that was a real thing. That is a real thing. It is, um, it
is an entity, Federal Executive Boards or an entity that
were created by President Kennedy, who believed there was
64

great value in bringing together the leadership of the
Federal Government in a particular area to advance common,
advance common goals.

where I was either the Chair or the Vice-Chair for many,
many years, Robert's Rules of Order, that's what we used.
Um, in Waltham, I was the Vice President of the City
Council for two years and the President of the City Council
for two years. Again, we had our own set of rules, uh, over
90 of them, but Robert's Rules of Order, uh, was our
fallback.
So, lots of experience with parliamentary
procedure and certainly as a City Councillor with the Open
Meeting Law prior to my coming to Lawrence. Obviously, as
the City Clerk, you are responsible for posting notices to
comply with the Open Meeting Law. That's it. It's the law.
I'm also very, um, well-versed fami, familiar
with the Public Records Law because in Lawrence, I am also

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

And the

ordination process, your experience with that?
DIANE LEBLANC:

In, in ordinances? Okay. So, so

have experienced crafting ordinances as, as a City
Councillor working with my council colleagues to move
ordinances through the process and get them approved.
But in terms of, um, the City of Lawrence, one of
the things that I identified very quickly when I came on
board is that there was a gap and the, um, the general
ordinances of the City of Lawrence, um, you know, for, for
just different reasons.
Uh, they, they hadn't been forwarded to the
organization that we work with, which is Muni Code, who I
believe you work with here as well. Um, since some point in
2019 and, uh, there was just an awful lot going on. So, I
actually have led that project and, again, even only being
there a short time, it's something that I am very proud of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

actually in the City of Lawrence, um, one of -- again, I

because, um, Muni Code now has all of our ordinances and we
are ready to, um, issue an up-to-date supplement.
And I have also brought this project far enough
along that the legislative body can make a decision as to
66

how it wants to move forward with a full-fledged
codification. Uh, by charter they're supposed to do a
codification every 10 years. Sometimes things happen.

have positioned the City to do a full codification of its
general ordinances. I've also worked with General Code, um,
to, uh, position the City. We're currently going through a
codification of our zoning ordinances. So, I'm, I'm
familiar with both.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

coordinating scheduling, advertising, staffing, agendas and
minutes. Could you explain how you would envision
streamlining these tasks to improve efficiency and creating
a sustainable workflow?
67
Packet Pg. 1139

7

DIANE LEBLANC:

Um, well, thank you for that

question. I, I, is, is I think I said during one of the
interviews when I read the job announcement that was the

in most communities, that's not the case." The Clerk is
responsible for Clerk City Council meetings.
So immediately I'm thinking your Clerk is super
human and somehow manages to do all of this. Um, but,
again, it was Cambridge and I wanted to come here. So, I
applied for the job despite that.
Um, I was very happy to note that in this year's
budget, um, you have put in for a Clerk of committees. I
think that that is an essential role. Um, and it's clear
that this body thinks that there's an opportunity to
streamline the process.
Um, it would be premature for me to say, Okay, we
should do this, this and this, right? I need to have the
direct conversations with each of you. What works for you,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

only thing that made me say, "Hm, that's different because

what doesn't work for you. I need to talk to Clerk Wilson.
I need to talk with those that have been involved
in this process and, and, and, and together I have no doubt
we come up with a process that's streamlined. You all have
68
Packet Pg. 1140

7

a lot of committees and, um, uh, again, uh, Clerk Wilson
probably is somewhat superhuman if, if he has been managing
that on his own.

I'm a hard worker. I work long hours. Um, I do need six
hours of sleep a day.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, we will go to Vice

Mayor Mallon.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to Ms. LeBlanc. So nice to meet you.
Thank you for being here today. If you are hired for this
position, you will be a department head and responsible for
managing several employees. How would you describe your
management style?
DIANE LEBLANC:

So, again, I have, um, been a

Supervisor Manager for, for most of my career. Um, I would
start off by saying, I hold myself to very high standards.
I try to lead by example. Um, and, but I also hold my

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

So, I do think, think it needs a close look. Um,

employees to high standards. Um, I think I communicate
openly.
Um, I certainly listen to my employees. I involve
employees in the process. Generally, if you're looking for
69
Packet Pg. 1141

7

answers, that's where you're going to find them. Um, and to
the extent that situations weren't my preference, is always
for consensus. Um, sometimes you get there, sometimes you

At the end of the day, I'm accountable for
achieving, um, the goals that we, we set and what we say
we're going to do. So, I have no difficulty accepting, um,
that accountability role. Um, again, while I hold my
employees to high standards, I also. uh. acknowledge their
work. um. through whatever mechanisms are available and.
um. use those plus whatever mechanisms I devise on my own.
So, I think, um. you know, it's a little bit of, of a mix.
But again, um. it's worked for me
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Uh, through you

Madam Mayor. Just to follow up if I may. I can imagine that
most of the members of the Clerk's office are actually
watching this interview right now. Um, we've had a few
changes in the Clerk's office.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

don't.

Mr. Wilson has only been with us for, I think in
the history of the City a little bit of a short time and
we've got two other positions that the City Council is
hiring for the City Manager being sort of the number one
70
Packet Pg. 1142

7

that I think is kind of top of mind for people. How would
you support the Clerk's office employees in another
transition in their department?
So, I'm not sure

that I heard the full question. It was a little bit
muffled. Was it, how would I support?
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Yeah. How would you

support the employees through, in the Clerk's office, in
particular, through another transition in the Clerk's
office, um, with the City Manager, knowing that we'll have
a new City Manager as well?
DIANE LEBLANC:

Sure. Again, I, if, if I am

chosen for this position, um, I'm excited about, about
meeting the staff. Um, from what I've, I've heard good
things about the staff and I certainly have been doing my
homework to the extent that that's, um, I've been able to
do that.
Um, I would say that, um, I will be there to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

support you. We will, we will do this, we will build on the
good work that you have done. Um, and we will move forward.
We will commit to, you know, continuous improvement as a
team.
71
Packet Pg. 1143

7

Um, again, I, I, I would start by listening to
them, right? I'm sure they all have ideas of what they
would like to do. Um, I remember when I met with, uh, the

Lawrence and I said, what would you change?
And they said everything and I'm thinking you've
been here a really long time, right? Um, look, we're, we're
gonna, we're gonna again build on what has worked and we're
gonna commit to getting better, um, you know, back to
management style.
I think it's very important that employees do
have an opportunity for development. Um, you know, the,
the, the, the new Auditor talked about the importance of
cross-training. That is also something that I have done in
the City of Lawrence, even in a short time.
Uh, there are multiple benefits to, to crosstraining, to both the organization and as a developmental
opportunity, uh, for the employees. So, I, um, I would

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

assistant, well, I met with one of the individuals in, in

welcome the opportunity to, to be part of their team and to
work with them.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you. I think

you've mentioned some of this in your answers already. Uh,
72
Packet Pg. 1144

7

but maybe there's a, a new, uh, comment you can make on
this one: describe a time when you brought forward a new
initiative or project where you had a leadership role and

Did you face any resistance to the change and how did you
manage that?
DIANE LEBLANC:

Okay. Um, so I, I, I, I will use

the example that, that I used during, um, the second
interview and my agency had just announced a major
reorganization.
I was the new Regional Administrator, um, in
charge of standing up this reorganization in the Northeast
part of the country. Um, as part of the reorganization, I
became responsible for the Bayonne Federal Records Center,
which was one of the largest in the country.
Uh, well, over 80 employees, closer to 90
employees, um, that had worked in the facility, most of
them more than 20 years, uh, prior to my coming on as

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

tell us how you managed it and brought it to completion.

Regional Administrator, they were told that they would be
losing their jobs because the facility was on a military
base that was slated for closure. Um, in good faith, they
had been told by some officials in Washington. Um, you
73
Packet Pg. 1145

7

know, "Don't worry, we're gonna keep you on board until the
very end.
So, you've got a couple of years to figure this

they said, "You need to get to Bayonne and you need to tell
them that we're not gonna be able to keep them." So, you
know, as you send out records across the country, you don't
need as many employees.
Um, so I literally, I met my Bayonne staff a week
after I was named a Regional Administrator and it was an
all-hands meeting and they were angry, they were openly
angry and rightfully so. I remember to this day, somebody
yelling out, "You will be like all the rest. We will never
see you again."
And now this is what I'm tasked with at the same
time, standing up a reorganization. Um, I could talk about
this for a long time because it was a really important time
for these individuals. But I approached it, again, by

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

out." And then when they named me Regional Administrator,

listening to them. I approached it by asking them what they
needed for us, from us. During this transition, the
military base had put up some services in place, but they
weren't meeting the unique needs of the employees at this
74
Packet Pg. 1146

7

particular facility.
So based upon what I heard, I worked with my
team, the best of my team, my newly created team in the

as a team and working hand-in-hand with the labor union as
a true partner and very, very long story short, we took
care of our employees.
During this very challenging time, we were able
to place the majority of them in new positions. At the same
time that I was tasked with doing this, I'm needing to take
care of the customer concerns, the logistics involved in
moving a million cubic feet of records and standing up a
major reorganization.
So, I, I hope that gives you just a flavor from
my ability to deal with tough situations. And, uh, that all
ended when the facility did close, all of the employees
turned out for the, uh, closure ceremony with their
families, with their heads high and we celebrated them and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Northeast region and we put together the services, working

we, we continued to support them in the region even after
the base closure.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you for that

example. We'll go to Councillor Zondervan.
75
Packet Pg. 1147

7

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you. can you describe in detail your
experience with meeting and records archival management,

paper to digital records and meeting management?
DIANE LEBLANC:

Okay. Um, well, thank you for

that. And again, I go back to -- I grew up, um, at the
National Archives and Records Administration and, um, as as
a very, uh, young individual, I sat at the table with many,
uh, members of the Internal Revenue Service, where we
talked about the day that that tax return would go away,
right? And I will tell you we had years where we had that
discussion, we talked about the day when the Federal
Government would accept an electronic signature.
So, I have seen records management progress
through the years. Certainly, during my time at the
National Archives and Records Administration, um, I have
watched the formats change. As Regional Administrator, I

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

software and other experiences you had transitioning from

was responsible for an operation that did microfilming and
that did scanning, right? And we provided those services to
the federal community at large.
I also was responsible for the newly created
76
Packet Pg. 1148

7

Records Management Team, which was part of the
reorganization. And I was one of just a few individuals
selected by the archivist of the United States to roll out

changed the way that the National Archives sort of looked
at providing records management assistance to its
customers. Whereas, in the past we went out, we did audits
and it was, "Gotcha, you're not keeping this right, you're
not doing this right."
It was a new approach to going in and saying,
"What do you need from us?" And the reality is at the time
that we did that everybody's talking about electronic
records, everybody's talking about, let's get these filing
cabinets out of our faces and get everything online. So, I
was responsible for the staff. Am I the, am I the techie? I
am not, right. Do I understand how it all works? I
certainly do.
And the national Archives has actually created an

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

a program called Targeted Assistance, which completely

Electronic Records Archives, right? For the permanently
valuable records of the Federal Government, the software
changes on a regular basis and it depends upon the company
and everybody is out there who wants to sell you something
77
Packet Pg. 1149

7

that's going to do every single thing that you ever wanted
it to do.
Here's what I, I want to know as a Clerk for the

towards electronic record keeping. I don't know if the City
has a policy on electronic record keeping. But at the end
of the day, the fundamental responsibility of the City
Clerk is for all of the City's records, not just the
council records, the legislative records, not just the City
Clerk's records, it's for all of the City's records going
back to 1630.
And if something is deemed a permanent or
historic record, it is the responsibility of the
municipality to make sure that it is preserved forever. So,
if you are making a decision to take that historic record
and put it in an electronic format, you were also
committing the City, you, you, you need to have an
Electronic Records Policy in place and you're committing

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

City of Cambridge, as I'm sure there's a need right to move

the City to migrating that data forward every time the
software changes, right?
So, there's really a lot involved in that
question. I love that question. Um, again, as a City Clerk,
78
Packet Pg. 1150

7

you, you, you're tasked with sort of keeping the history,
but at the same time, how do we make it more accessible?
Sometimes you do need to digitize, sometimes you do need to

you still need to keep the paper.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

with understanding the operations of the City Clerk's
office and the landscape of City Hall, what do you hope to
achieve in 3 to 6 months in this position and in 1 to 2
years from higher?
DIANE LEBLANC:

Well, I would, I would look to

take the office to the next level, right? Whatever that is
right? Is it, is it doing more work with the departments on
their records management needs? Is it really cranking up
customer service a few notches? Is it implementing on

make things available in electronic record and sometimes

demand translation services?
Um, I don't know what it is because I don't know
where the office is currently at, but I would look to move
in 1 to 2 years. I would look to move the office, um,

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Uh, thank you, Madam

81

7

about your experience in Lawrence, the challenges you came
into the office, facing and how you have handled, uh, your
term so far?
Sure. Um, and, again, I have

nothing, but good things to say about the City of, of
Lawrence. Um, they have a nine-member City Council, um, in
my short time there.
Uh, I -- my first day on the job was August 17th.
Um, in September, I had a municipal, uh, preliminary and I
had never overseen an election before.
Um, I'm very good at assessing situations. And
after a week, week-and-a-half, I reached out to Michelle
Tassinari, who is the head of the elections division in
Lawrence. And I said, "Okay, this is what I have for
resources.
This is what this is, what we've got down and I
need help." And right there, I changed the dynamic. They
became our partner and they were there to support and they

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

DIANE LEBLANC:

helped and they got us through that, um, that September
election.
And then in November, I had, um, a very robust
municipal election. Um, the incumbent mayor had been an

7

interim mayor, the former president and, um, there were
multiple candidates for mayor in the preliminary and again,
we got through the November election.

um, how we did training for, for the poll workers. We
actually, um, had a poll worker involved in the training.
Um, we provided training in both Spanish and English, not
just in English.
So, um, in very short order, I oversaw, uh, two
elections. In very short order I have, um, moved forward to
address, um, what's needed with regard to General
Ordinances and, um, and Zoning Ordinances and to move the
City forward in that direction.
I also was tasked with, uh, rep precinct, um,
something that, that I had never done and we came through
that process very well, um, with only creating, uh, two
sub-precincts.
Um, also during that short time, um, I, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Um, we in that very short amount of time changed,

needed to do two inaugurations, right? Um, so, uh, there
was the inauguration for the new mayor, which took place
literally a half hour after I certified the vote.
So, I certified the vote at City Hall. They put
83

7

me in a cruiser, drove me across town and we swore in the
new mayor, um, in November. And then we did the, uh, the
swearing-in for, for the School Committee and the, uh, the

So, there have been a lot of, uh, big things in a
very short amount of time and the staff has stepped up.
They've worked with me; they've worked as a team. Um, we
have done some cross-training, um, and, and as much as
there are many things I would miss about Lawrence.
They've, they've got great, great workers in
terms of, uh, the City Council. My day begins every
morning. Uh, the first thing I do is drop off my dog at 7
o'clock and then I get in my vehicle.
Uh, but by 7.30, I am on the phone with the
President of the City Council, Monday through Friday. And
we talk for 30, 40, 45 minutes. Sometimes I'm in the
parking lot and I say, I need to get into the office. Um,
but we talk daily, right? Because there's been a lot of

don't like about it is the commute.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Okay. Uh, in your

previous answer, you talked about, uh, a possibility of, of
implementing on-demand translation services as maybe an
idea of where, you know, the Clerk's office could go. Do

you have experience in that type of, um, implementation?
DIANE LEBLANC:

So, at the National Archives, we

several times moved to new software systems, um, but it was

particular need. Um, I'm using the software that's in place
um in the City of Lawrence. Um, we use CivicPlus, I don't
know that you use that here.
I think you've got Granicus. Um, and, and it is
different and I am not familiar with it. So, it would be
like learning CivicPlus, when I went to Lawrence. Um, but
that, you know, it's, it's not something that, um, I see as
an issue.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. Thank you

Other questions before we

move on to a council discussion. I don't think I see any.
So, thank you.
DIANE LEBLANC:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, Councillors now is an

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

generally proprietary, um, you know, created for that

opportunity for discussion, Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, Madam Mayor,

perhaps this was a question. Just as we did earlier, um,
with Mr. McCann, it would be great to hear references, uh,
87
Packet Pg. 1159

7

from Sheila.
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT NAOMIE STEPHEN:

So, um, I

checked the references, um, Naomie, so, um, I spoke to, um,

retired Clerk in the City of Waltham, who had also served
in his career as City Solicitor and Deputy Mayor.
Um, and overall, I would say their references
were superb. Um, the word that came up in talking to both
of them was, um, ethical. They talked about, um, Miss
Leblanc's strengths being this unique combination of
knowledge and capability. Um, and they spoke very highly of
her work, um, with staff.
Um, the person I spoke to at NARA talked a lot
about the personal level of, um, interaction she put into
dealing with the restructuring and reorganization, which
did include, um, reduction of staff that Miss LeBlanc spoke
about and how hard she worked to make sure that everyone
was taken care of in that instance.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Ms. LeBlanc's colleagues at NARA as well as the recently

Um, the gentleman from Waltham that I spoke to,
um, talked about how her time as Council President made her
uniquely, um, capable to do the Clerk work because she
understands, you know, moderating public discourse and sort
88
Packet Pg. 1160

7

of what it takes to get to actu, actual action on items.
Um, and both references spoke highly of her dedication to
accuracy and transparency with records.

and determination. So, there was some conversation around,
um, her ability to be firm, but also to be engaging with
staff and, and with her, um, fellow council members,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you. It's

pretty much what I expected. Appreciate it. Thank you,
Madam, Mayor. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillors, any other

comments, discussion? Councillor Nolan, you had your
screen. on.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yes, thank you. I,

um, I just want to say, I think, uh, Diane LeBlanc is an
excellent candidate. I was very happy to hear the answers
to the questions today and also, uh, Councillor Carlone's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Um, and, um, how she met challenges with resolve

question about references.
And, uh, Ms. Stephen's response was important to
me because, in general, I agree with, uh, many people who
have expressed that having more than one candidate is best
89
Packet Pg. 1161

7

practice.
And my one concern about, uh, Ms. LeBlanc was
having someone leave a job after a short amount of time, I

and to reflect on. I personally am satisfied with the
answer, uh, partly because I'm partisan also, I think
Cambridge is an unbelievable opportunity and a, a dream job
in many, many ways.
And I also, uh, endorse or appreciate the idea of
having a less lengthy commute for a whole host of reasons
in terms of energy, in terms of emission, pollution, in
terms of other elements to the job. So, so that to me
satisfied the question about why someone would be leaving a
job after a relatively short amount of time.
So, I, um, I certainly someone I have -- will be
supporting this candidacy and acknowledge that we are
lucky, I think to have someone with this range of
experience which comes through.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

will say is, is something that is important to understand

And I also look forward to some of the changes
and the improvements in some of the way that we do business
as articulated by the candidate before us. And I really
want to thank the search committee for going through this
90
Packet Pg. 1162

7

extensive process, which as we heard at the beginning
involved, uh, a very large group of candidates, a round of
interviews with a range of people and putting forward, uh,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

this candidate to us. I am grateful for all of your work.
Thank you, Councillor

Nolan, Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, um, so when I think of, and Councillor
Azeem brought this up, I hope in the search for -- in the
screening committee. So, I hope I'm not stealing this
thunder here. But when I think of the, um, the job of the
Clerk, there's obviously many things.
But if you think of it in terms of three major
buckets: you've got the record-keeping, the archiving, you
have the, the office itself and the sort of front facing
public piece of this when people come in for birth records
or death records.
And then you have obviously, you know, the
council and, and, and committee meetings and, um, you know,
I think Ms. LeBlanc has, uh, ample experience in all three
of those categories, um, which I think is somewhat unique.
I think oftentimes when you, um you know, you have folks
91

Packet Pg. 1163

7

that maybe are much stronger in one area and not as strong
in the other. I think, I think her experience is, is
extensive in all three of those areas.

as, as Councillor Nolan mentioned and as we talked about
with the auditor, you know, there is this concern about
having only one, one candidate. I, I would just point out
that, that, um, we had, uh as was pointed out by, by
Councillor Toner and Councillor Simmons, we had over 30
candidates that originally, uh, applied.
We sort of whittled that down, uh, over time and
we were prepared to put two candidates forward, one of whom
pulled out, which is not the fault, the responsibility of
Ms. LeBlanc that, you know, and I would say that if there
were two candidates here, um, I would be voting the same
way that I'm voting today. And so, I'm happy to support,
um, Ms. LeBlanc as the new Clerk for the City of Cambridge.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Before we go back to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

Um, you know, I know that, that, um, you know,

Councillor Azeem, anyone who hasn't spoken? Vice Mayor
Mallon,
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I also just wanted to point out just following along
92
Packet Pg. 1164

7

on Councillor McGovern's comments is that, you know, when
you have a very public process as required by Massachusetts
Open Meeting Law, oftentimes you do lose candidates because

You know, this is a very public process. You have
to let your job -- you need to let your employers or your
board know that you're, you're going for a position,
unlike, you know, if we were all going out for, you know,
a, a corporate position or a non-profit job.
So, it's not unusual to lose candidates. Um,
because when push comes to shove, you need to tell your
board or your, or your boss that you're a candidate in a
very public process that they would pull out. So, um, I
just want to add that, that, you know, we are doing a
couple of searches right now and it's, you know, when you
think back about other public processes, you know, it's,
it's very usual that people will pull out.
I do want to say that I had some reservations

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

they may have cold feet on.

about Ms. LeBlanc, um, and her short time in the City of
Lawrence. Uh, and this short time in being a City Clerk
because I know how often we rely on Mr. Wilson -- Clerk
Wilson, um to help guide this council through very
93
Packet Pg. 1165

7

challenging conversations.
Uh, but I have to say that I was very, very
impressed with Miss LeBlanc today with all of her

her honesty and candor and bringing forward some of the
things that I, you know, I've been thinking about for a
long time in the City Clerk's office.
So, I'm very, very excited to be supporting, uh,
Ms. LeBlanc today in the position of City Clerk and I'm,
I'm so glad that she put her name in the ring, uh, for this
position. And so, I, I look forward to, um, hopefully
moving her forward into this position, uh, at the end of
this meeting. Thank you, Madam Mayor,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Councillor Azeem.
Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Um, I wanted to summarize my thoughts as we went
through the process. Um, as Councillor Toner said in the
beginning, we had 32 total applications, 8 people we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

acknowledge -- or her knowledge, her experience and just

initially interviewed and then 4 people we called back for
a second round of interviews.
Um, so I think that Ms. LeBlanc has been through
a series of interviews at this point. And throughout the
94
Packet Pg. 1166

7

entire process, I was incredibly impressed.
I think if we think about records-keeping, her 37
years of experience in records-keeping, um, and the general

as being a participant, uh, and being a City Council
member, um, but also being on the other side as a Clerk,
brings incredible levels of experience.
And, uh, we've talked a little bit about the
customer, uh, service piece as well. Um, but all of our
conversations have been very fruitful and I'm very hopeful
that she'll do a great job there as well.
Um, I want to just talk a little bit about, you
know, the process: we had 2 candidates, we were hoping to
bring forward, um, one of whom decided to not go public and
there was at least some initial conversation about whether
we wanted to go to any of the other candidates who had
applied in our final 4 or other places and consider
bringing more candidates to the City Council.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

field is amazing. Her experience in running meetings, both

Um, and I can't speak for the other City
Councillors or the other people on the committee and why
they made the decisions that they did. But for me,
particularly, um, it would almost seem a little bit unfair
95
Packet Pg. 1167

7

to the other candidates, and that Ms. LeBlanc seemed so
much of a stronger candidate in my mind. And I thought
that, um, to make other candidates go public and wasn't

Um, and I think the Ms. LeBlanc is incredibly,
incredibly a strong candidate and going through the whole
process, um, I would say that, you know, you know, I
understand the skepticism and the general principle of
having more candidates is something that I agree with.
But in this specific case, looking at the whole
field and having been part of the process, I would say, you
know, to have some faith in the committee that we really
believe that this was the right direction to go in. And I
would stand by that statement. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor

Zondervan and then Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you I concur with my colleagues and,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

fair at this time.

uh, very excited to, um, hopefully in, in a few minutes
hire Ms. LeBlanc as our, as our new Clerk. And I look
forward to working with her.
Um, I think in terms of the number of candidates,
96
Packet Pg. 1168

7

it's pretty clear to me that, uh, and maybe did an
extensive search and, and through those all of their own,
um, ended up with, with one candidate. But, but once again,

candidate. And so, I, I think the process worked quite well
in this case. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you. Thank

you, Madam Chair. Uh, just a few things. First of all, I
want to stand with my colleagues who also were members of
the screening committee, uh, as in terms of having one
candidate. For me, I'm gonna say we, we have one candidate
and we have the best candidate. We did have a robust
process. It wasn't like there was no one else that ap,
applied. 32 people applied. We got it down to 10, down to
8, and then down to 4.
Unfortunately, or fortunately maybe, uh, those
people, the people that were asked to come forward didn't

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

uh, we are presented with a, a highly qualified, uh,

and the person that remains in the process has and, I
believe, would have risen to the top, uh, and would have
been our are unanimous, uh, choice.
This was an extraordinary process. We cannot say
97
Packet Pg. 1169

7

that enough. Um, to all my colleagues, we've been sort of
working overtime all the time with three searches running
simultaneously. But this process was extraordinary in its

even for Miss, uh, LeBlanc, uh, Clerk LeBlanc.
And I call a Clerk Blanc, not because I'm
foreseeing the future, but because she is a Clerk and that
is the title. Um, Clerk, Le, Leblanc, uh, just stood out,
in my opinion, of shoulder and head, head and shoulders of
the other candidates.
And those other candidates were extraordinary,
extraordinary and I hope that my colleagues will trust the
process and trust the service, not only of their colleagues
that served on this committee, but the other folks, Ms.
Stephen, um, the Assistant City Manager, Mr. Nelson and,
um, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm drawing a blank on the name of the
commissioners.
All right, now, who gave up their time and their

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 10:30 AM (Submission of the Record)

transparency, its efficiency, its quality of candidates. So

service. This was a very good process. I am very pleased
with the outcome and I'm hoping my colleagues will stay
with those of us that are voting in the affirmative so that
we can give the right message to the incoming, uh, the

wholeheartedly behind her. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

love the City and I understand the commute so, uh, issue as
well. And I think I was really pleased with the answers
that were given, uh, today. And, you know, obviously the
City Clerk position, and the Mayor position, we're all -we work very, very closely together.
So, I think, um, I felt that I could see myself
easily working with you, uh, on a Monday night. And, uh,
so, you know, I don't want to repeat anything my colleagues
have said, but really much agree with everything that's
been said. And I appreciate the, the search committee who,

PUBLIC COMMENT
Itamar Turner-Trauring, living at 139 Oxford Street
spoke on Policy Order # 5.

He said that it was a bad idea

highlighted the popularity of Memorial Drive being a park
for weekenders. He also stressed on expanding the park to
other stretches of Memorial Drive. He declared that over
2150 signatures have been collected thus far in support of
the park. He hoped that Policy # 5 will be voted out and
there will be no such Policy Orders in future.
Sheila Headly-Burwell, address unknown, identified
herself as one of the many members of the Riverside
Community greatly affected by the decision to close
Memorial Drive through way on Saturdays and Sundays
throughout the summer months till December instead of only
Sundays that was in force. She wanted to know how such a
policy that brought idling traffic to their doorstep be
justified as it brought sound and pollution along with it.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to reduce public open space at a policy level. He

She added that the traffic on Saturday nights was
dangerously speeding down their residential streets. She
wondered how a major throughway that was built for this
very reason is now closed. She closed by stating that the
3
Packet Pg. 1183

8

community had plenty to deal with already as they were
sandwiched in-between colleges that hold huge events from
time to time, shutting down access to their community and

Carl Graham, address not known, said he’s been living
in Cambridge for over 50 years and stated that there is a
need to figure out how to direct the traffic out of the
residential area and help it get back to the Mass Pike. He
said that there has to be a plan to direct the traffic and
keep it out of the residential area instead of wasting all
this negative energy on fighting against each other on
shutting down Memorial Drive. He asserted that that was the
only way to arrive at a solution. He also believed that the
authorities failed to consider how it affected the
residents that live in the area and said that he needed
them to develop more empathy about the way to solve the
plight of the residents, especially the ones that live on
Putnam Ave and Western Ave, where the traffic is the most.

hence should not be further inconvenienced.

Natassa Mason of Western Ave said that she enjoys the
river being shut down on Sundays because her children learn
how to ride their bike on those days. She asserted that

Connor Henry, living at 219, Harvard Street, spoke,
opposing Policy Order 5 and mostly focused on what he
thought were the positives of the Memorial Drive closures.
He complimented the authorities and said he felt very
strongly that the Memorial Drive closure is one of the best
things that has happened to Cambridge. He perceived that
increased open spaces have improved the quality of life as
many people were outdoors. Extending the closure to
Saturdays too was a great move, he thought. Biking and
walking in such open spaces was far better than doing the
same in allotted lanes, he mused. At the same time he said,
he did not want to belittle or speak against those who had

Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition spoke on behalf of the 75
plus member nonprofits serving Cambridge. She urged the
Council to support the coalition's proposal to put $20
million of Cambridge's remaining ARPA funds towards a

Cambridge Nonprofit Recovery Fund. The fund, she disclosed,
would be open to all Cambridge Nonprofits that serve
Cambridge residents. She asserted that the goal would be to

seriously by the pandemic. She further went on to state
that she had three points to share: first was to urge City
leaders to make available ARPA funds and also not to delay
decision-making on the remaining 33 million because of the
transition of the City Manager. She claimed that nonprofits
were and are the City's first line of defense for low
income, underserved and marginalized residents.
Secondly, she said that Cambridge should not have to
choose between the Nonprofit Fund and individual projects
and that nonprofits could legally accept money from both
sources so that it allows them to pursue their important
projects successfully. Thirdly, she also suggested a
vetting process to create the fund. She emphasised that the
Cambridge Nonprofit Recovery Fund is about lifting up an

appeal was because her questions about the content of antibias and diversity trainings have also gone unanswered
these past few years.
She also wanted to know the reason why the word
‘decolonization’ has never been uttered during hundreds of
hours of diversity training. She alluded that indigenous
voices were excluded even within the Affinity Groups, which
are supposed to be safe spaces to discuss. She added that

Christopher Cassa, spoke to express his support for
the Riverbend Park closures over the weekend. He affirmed
that there is a need to promote equitable access to open
space along the river and hoped that there will be a search
for another location as well to identify ways for people
near Harvard Square to enjoy Memorial Drive on the weekends
because it was categorized as Parkland. He declared that
the people who supported the closure were much more than
those who were upset about it and so hoped that planning
will be done accordingly.

Rachel Chu, who lives on Blanchard [ph] Road in 02138,
commented in support of Policy Order #5. She said she works
at the Charles River Conservancy and she thanked the City
Council on behalf of the CRC for continuing the weekend
closures on Memorial Drive. She continued that this kind of
access to public space is important for all as it provides
the residents and visitors with health and wellness
benefits. Identifying herself as someone who lives near
Mount Auburn, she personally was thankful for increasing
her access to the river and the opportunity to get out
biking and enjoying the beautiful city.

walking, and all kinds of other activities. She reminded
that Memorial Drive was a parkway and not a through way.
She further added that a survey showed that people
were appreciative of the opportunity to enjoy the river
without cars. She justified that the anger was misdirected
at the City Councillors as it was not their decision to add
Saturdays to the closure. She urged the City to work with
the DCR to look for ways for this to be a win-win for all
and pleaded to stop blaming people for wanting to have a
peaceful experience along the river.

added that he regularly walks, bikes and also drives around
Cambridge. He felt very disappointed to learn that the
Council was considering closing the drive to people who

wanted to walk and bike on Saturdays. He alleged that the
move was in the wrong direction as opening Memorial Drive
to non-car users on Saturdays makes Cambridge more

also pointed out that closing the non-car users on
Saturdays is incompatible with the City’s commitment to
addressing climate change. He highlighted that cars are an
enormous source of carbon emissions and also the most
dangerous part of the residents’ lives. Hence, he said that
it should be easier rather than harder for the residents to
walk and bike around Cambridge and thus argued that
Memorial Drive should be kept open to people walking and
biking on Saturdays. He rounded off by stating that the
solution is not by giving away the city's beautiful space
to car traffic.

advertised as even she didn't know about it until very
recently even though she lives really close by. Rather than
limiting the closure, she thought, there was an engineering
solution to maintaining that beautiful public space while
navigating the increased traffic. She declared that
LonelyBones had over 5000 members in their community and
hundreds who regularly skate with them and added that they
all love and depend on this space to be open and readily

surprised by the closure of the drive to traffic during

streets to pedestrians and cyclists. He revealed that more

than 1000 people had signed a petition in support of
keeping Memorial Drive open to pedestrians on Saturdays and
Sundays. He felt that emergency vehicles could easily pass

easily be removed.

He further added that those who walk on

Memorial Drive or by the Charles River benefit from
weekends of ‘Car-Free Activity Policy’. He also struck a
note of caution when he said that high-speed roads in urban
areas create disaster. He cited that in April of the
previous year, a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle on
Memorial Drive. While, the driver was fined, the pedestrian
was admitted in a hospital with severe injuries, he
reported. He revealed that the crash was just one of the
over 400 crashes on Memorial Drive since 2019, which had
led to the deaths of two pedestrians. He noted that City of
Cambridge's posted speed limit was 15 MPH slower than that
of Memorial Drive and this difference increased the
likelihood of severe injury by over 17%. On a closing note,

James Williamson, living in North Cambridge, spoke of
an item on the agenda that had to do with authorizing $15
million dollars in loans for three different multi-use
paths in the city. He noted that the City administration
was already spending millions of dollars on bicycle
infrastructure, much of which was controversial in the way
that it was designed and implemented, according to him. He
argued that the supposed multi-use paths are really not
multi-use paths, but are just bike paths. He proclaimed
that it was a case of false advertising and basically

Matt Lerner, address not known, from Long Fellow Real
Estate Partners wished to speak to the Alewife Zoning
Petition on the unfinished business item #3. He maintained
that he had been in front of this party in the Ordinance
Committee several times over the past three months,
requesting that the Triangle be excluded from the spending
moratorium. He insisted that the City's own planning study,
‘Envision Alewife’ in 2019, not only acknowledged, but
justified the planning rationale of the Triangle, stating
that it was an emerging sub-district in the City of
Cambridge, transforming from an office precinct to a mixeduse district and thus was not the focus of the study.

it was going to affect many lives.
She added that she was surprised about the major
omission in the bio of one of the candidates, which leaves

very, very salient to the job. She further stated that the
said person had two current employments and one of them,
which matters a whole lot to the job was in the resume yet,
but did not make it into the bio, presumably prepared by
the City, which she thought looked like a cover-up. She
closed by stating how disappointed she was and wanted the
authorities to do better.

it was very important. He urged the City to be a strong

policy was the exact opposite of being progressive in
combating climate change. He debated that the Riverbend

Highway as he thought that residents who lived on the east
side of the city did not have great access to the
waterfront and to the Riverbend Park on Saturdays and

continue looking at extending it further east and also
maintain the existing weekend closures.
He thought that there were ways to address the very
legitimate concerns of traffic being rerouted through the
neighborhoods. He contemplated that it can be done with
traffic calming and information and reasoned that as people
learned new patterns, they will find other arteries to pass
through the city.
Robert La Tremouille, Chair of Friends of the White

update, City Manager you have the floor.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Good evening

similar to my last presentation. I will have Derrick
provide the general update on the COVID-19 metrics.
As you will hear from Derrick, Cambridge like most
cities in Massachusetts remains high COVID-19 community
level. While our case numbers remain higher than we want
them to be, last week we saw an 8% decrease in new cases
from the previous week. I'm glad to see this decline, but
we need to remain vigilant.
We are closely monitoring Cambridge's data and I will
be meeting with our Commissioner of Public Health and our
Public Health Officer later this week to have, uh, continue
our in-depth conversation on what metrics the City should
be focusing on, moving forward, when determining the need
for targeted interventions.

everybody. Tonight, we will provide a brief COVID-19 update

People may choose to wear a mask at any time and I am

places like grocery stores, wearing masks. However, I want
to strongly encourage our residents and visitors to our

city to wear masks within indoors and public places. With
elevated case numbers in our region, voluntary masking will

well-being of ourselves, our loved ones in our community.
As a reminder, people experiencing symptoms, testing
positive or recently exposed to someone with COVID-19
should wear a mask.
Additionally, we strongly encourage the public to wear
a high quality mask indoors and public places. This
includes on public transportation and ride shares. Stay upto-date with our COVID 19 vaccine and booster shots, get

outreach and support efforts underway. For those in our
small business community needing masks for their workers,

We also will be expanding the June schedule for Cambridge,
seven days a week per week COVID 19 Testing Program, which
continues to include appointment-based testing and will
include expanded walk-in testing options for the month of
June. Daily appointment only testing is provided to our

to hold mobile vaccination clinics at locations and events
throughout the city during the summer.
As I have mentioned, I'm proud of the partnership

Apologize. Good evening everyone. This is a public health,

regards to the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.
First slide, please. Good evening. It's been about a
month since I've delivered the COVID-19 update and I wish I
had better news to report. Since our last meeting, the
United States has reached a groun -- grim mile -milestone. One million lives lost to COVID-19 since this

levels for Cambridge and Middlesex County.
As you can see, apart from a few blips, COVID cases

past week, we have actually moved into the high CDC
community level. This is due to the increase in hospital
admissions in the county, coupled with our continued high
case rate. As a reminder, many people are using rapid tests
and those results are not reflected here.
So these numbers are likely to be an undercount of
actual cases in the community, which means that we're in a
high -- at a higher level than what we're even able to
report to you at this time. Adding to my concern, we're
seeing increases in regional wastewater signals in three of
the four at Cambridge. Excuse me, three of the four
Cambridge sampling sites are also showing increases
Next slide please. This chart shows the COVID-19 case
rates in Cambridge by age. Unfortunately, we are seeing

Although there was a slight downturn in our cases over the

increases across the board in every age group except for
the 18 to 22 year old cohort, which is in the blue. You can
see the precipitous drop from that group, which coincides
with the end of the semes -- semester for our undergraduate
27

students. We believe this simply means that college
students have gone home for the summer.
We are particularly concerned to see case rates

reflected in orange, since they are the most vulnerable to
serious illness from COVID-19 complications. We are also
concerned that the number of cases in Cambridge Public
Schools has been increasing.
Next slide please. This chart shows -- shows our case
is broken out by Higher Ed and Non-Higher Ed. As a rule, a
high proportion of our cases over the past months have been
attributable to mostly young, mostly healthy and mostly
entirely vaccinated population on our campuses, a
population that has been at relatively low risk of serious
illness from COVID-19. However, you will see that for the
most recent week of data, 74% of our reported cases were
not related to Higher Ed.

We need the entire community to take responsibility
for protecting themselves and our most vulnerable
residents: those who are older, who are immune-compromised

recommendations, as I have said many times are as follows.
Number one, please get vaccinated and boosted.
Last week the CDC recommended boosters for children
ages 5 till 11. We'll be working to promote boosters among
this newly eligible group and we're certainly excited about
that from a public health perspective. Number two, wear a
mask indoors when outside your own home. We strongly urge
residents to exercise caution and wear a mask in indoor
settings. This is a CDC recommendation at the high
community level that we're currently in.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

At this point, uh, Councillors

will open it up to questions for the Cambridge Public
Health Team. I have Councillor Simmons and then Councillor
Zondervan and then Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS: Uh, thank you Madam
Chair, through you to Chief Neil, uh, one of the questions,
um, I think in the City Manager's earlier remarks, he
mentioned that we were going to do an advisory recommend

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we'll be creating a schedule for the fall for both COVID

that people wear a mask. Um, and I know that we're not
going to be meeting because of the Memorial Day weekend. I,
I have some concerns. I'm gonna follow the lead of our City
Manager and you Chief Neil.
32
Packet Pg. 1212

8

But I do have some concerns, particularly in the Black
and Brown communities, uh, about the prevalence of COVID19. Our numbers are still high. I think it would be great.

interview where you said, um, “COVID, we may be finished.
We might be tired of COVID, but COVID is not tired of us,”
or something to that effect.
And so if we're going to just do it on a
recommendation basis, are there ways that we can then
strengthen that message about how, particularly the Black
and Brown community need to be more vigilant because of our
access to health care is very varied and not always as
robust for so many different reasons.
So I, I just have some concerns. I have concerns
because there's this long weekend coming up -- coming out - coming up. A lot of people will be going out, which is
good, but a lot of people will be gathering in small places
and I just fear for certain communities to be more

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And I do appreciate your remarks just recently in a, in an

vulnerable. So the question through, uh, through -- through
the Chair to you, Chief Neil is, are there ways that we can
strengthen our message, particularly in the, uh, Black and
Brown communities, the underserved communities that have
33
Packet Pg. 1213

8

high numbers with infection rates.
And then the second piece, I believe he said something
about, um, mobile injection sites, um, or did I mishear you

mobile injection sites. And so, uh, if, if you've said
that, please repeat it. And if you didn't say it, where are
we with it? I yield.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I, I guess I could

start and then turn it over to Derrick. So I think the
advisory is really a much stronger statement than we have
in the past. And that's our next step. And I think we have
to make sure that we get the advisory out to as many people
as possible and working with Lee and Dan about that and
we'll work with the Public Health Department. So I think
this language has really stepped up to really make people
be aware of it.
We are also adding the Fire Department that they will
be doing mobile testing. They will be testing at our sites

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

because I know other cities and towns have done a mobile,

at Saint John's -- at Saint Paul's for vaccines and
boosters, but they're also gonna be doing mobile testing,
uh, starting very soon and that, that was announced by me.
Uh, that will, that will also be going on.
34
Packet Pg. 1214

8

So we're gonna be addressing them, but making sure
that we can help people get more boosters and then we
thought Saint Paul's was a great place to start. Alright

have testing, but at those sites we'll also be offering,
uh, vaccines and then we will be holding mobile vaccination
clinics at locations and events throughout the summer that
we're working with the Fire Department to select now.
So that's what we are at now and I think one of the
things we really want to stress is I think the fact that
we've got to make sure that this advisory gets to all the
places that it needs to go to. And I think we have a pretty
good handle on that, but we'll be working on that this week
and the advisory will be going out. I think as we're
speaking, I think it's actually going out, but I don't know
if Derrick has anything to add Derrick.
CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK L. NEAL:

Yeah, I

just wanna, uh, address, uh, Councillor Simmons’, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

now, we've booked that through the month of June. We, will

question directly, uh, through our C3 Outreach Team, we've
been, uh, strategically going to those Black and Brown
neighborhoods in our community, what I would call our
Health Equity Zones, our more marginalized communities, not
35
Packet Pg. 1215

8

only from an outreach perspective, but even through social
media, we've been, uh, really, uh, be -- being vigilant,
not just about enabling the client by giving them those

information so they can make informed decisions. Because
what we wanna do is that the most important tool in our
toolbox that we never mentioned and never get enough credit
for is health promotion.
And that's our ability to educate that, that citizen
so they can make informed decisions. So I would say that
we're -- I, I think that there's always room for
improvement, but I think that we've been doing a tremendous
job of working, uh, with -- through Nancy Richard Harding,
who leads that group, uh, in those communities. Anytime we
see an uptick and uh that's, uh, the, the Blacks and Brown
being in Cambridge is that we have a 6.2 square mile area
to cover. And if we can't do a good job with that, then
we're, we're in trouble and I think that from a public

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

protections such as a strong mask, but really the

health perspective. Our team has been doing a tremendous
job of, uh, outreaching and inreaching, uh, to those, not
only Black and Brown communities, but all of our
marginalized populations who are vulnerable.

particular groups that I can talk to you offline about

We'll go to Councillor

Zondervan and then Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. Madam,

through you to the Manager and Mr. Neil. I, I'm glad to see
that we're at least doing a mask advisory, but it's, it's
clearly not enough and to follow-up on my colleague's
comments, I was just looking at the demographic data again
and during the Omicron peak back in, in February, ignoring
the other category because that's a complicated, um,
category, but if you put that aside, the, the highest rate
of COVID-19 case counts was among our Black population in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Neil. Uh I, I will yield the floor, but I would love to

Cambridge And it was almost -- it was more than double the
White population. So clearly, what -- whatever we're doing
and whatever we've done so far is not protecting that
population equally from COVID-19.
37
Packet Pg. 1217

8

And so when we diagnose that if we're committed to
equity, we have to do more and doing a mask advisory at
this point, I have to ask the question if, if we think it's

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Uh, as I've said

from day one, there's different levels of advisories versus
mandate. After talking to the appropriate people, we don't
believe a mandate is the way to go right now. We think an
advisory is a way to go. We will continue to evaluate and
if we think we need to do a mandate at some point, we will
do a mandate, but at this point in time we are not doing a
mandate.
I think this will be some real concerns if we were to
do a mandate on enforcement, but if we need to do it as
we’ve done in the past, we’ll be one of the first to do it.
I know Brookline did it this time, but we'll do it when we
think it's necessary and we'll leave it on as long as we
need to leave it on as we were the last to take it off on

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

advisable to wear a mask, why would we not require it?

this current round.
So I think our record speaks for itself. I think it's
been incredibly successful. I think addressing some of the
concerns by putting the testing back at St. Paul’s and
38
Packet Pg. 1218

8

having the vaccines in the booster shots available for the
next four Saturdays starting in June was important.
Uh, I want to thank the Public Health Department for

community and we'll continue to do that. But at this point
in time, I think we'll have to, as we have in the past and
just wanna agree to disagree because we are not ready to
announce a mandate.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you, I, I appreciate that. I, I guess what I
would like to understand is what, what's the, what's the
criteria that we would use to decide to, to impose a
mandate or not?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

We will continue to

review criteria. I am not gonna say specifically what's
gonna trigger something one way or the other because things
can change. So we will continue to do what we've done to
date, review all the information, meet, have a discussion,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

all the outreach, especially in the Black and Brown

work with a [inaudible 01:16:10] with our Commissioner of
Public Health and then decide whether or not the
information we receive. But we're not going to publicly say
if this -- if X becomes Y, we're going to do it. I don't
39
Packet Pg. 1219

8

think that's the way to go. We've never done it that way.
And I don't think now is the time to change. I don't know
if Derrick wants that anything.
Chief.

CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK L. NEAL:

Sure,

I’ll add, we, we, we had a pretty, uh, intense discussion
last week. Louis and myself and, uh, his team as well as,
uh, having those discussions internally with my team and,
and, and really at this point in the pandemic and, you
know, some of you may be becoming tired, tired of me saying
this, but the, the pandemic is in the hands of our
citizens.
And, uh, what we really wanted to do was give the
citizens an opportunity to buy in with, uh, the mask
advisory. Uh, we, we think that, you know, business owners
will be vigilant, uh, and really, uh, highly recommending
that their patrons, uh, come in with mask and wear them at
appropriate time, you know, in those, uh, dining

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

establishments or just general business.
But just from a public health perspective, we just
think indoor masking is, is the, uh, the thing that we
should all be engaging in at this time. Um, so, uh, we
40
Packet Pg. 1220

8

agree, uh, in, in unison, uh, with the City of Cambridge
that, uh, this wasn't necessary and appropriate step to
take at this point with regards to the mask advisory

responsibility for each other, which is all that this
pandemic has ever asked for.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE: The other thing that
-- uh, thank you, Derrick that we are also looking at is
the fact that, you know, how can we get this posted. You
know, we're gonna talk to the Health Department and work
with our business community, work with our small businesses
and see if we can get these advisory signs up as you see in
some restaurants, they already have it, some banks already
have it.
Just to get more information out there and we're
confident that any time we've asked to work with our
business community, with our small business community,
they've been great partners and I think they'll again be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

because we want to empower our citizens to take

great partners in making sure that we spread this message
pretty strongly. But, again, we will continue to meet. I
mean, we've already scheduled another meeting.
I will say this, that Assad and Derrick have been
41

great in terms of finding the time and making sure we're
all on the same page and this is an ongoing discussion and
it won't be once a week, it will be whenever we think we

to that point as we have throughout the pandemic.

I'll go to Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

City is doing, but as I said before, it's not enough. We've
lost over a million people in the United States to COVID19. It's been more than two years. We've had several waves,
ups and downs in case counts.
And I would hope that by now we would begin to learn
that we need to be more vigilant and, and more proactive
about protecting people as um, you know, was mentioned, our
hospitalizations are going up. Those, those are significant

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, through you,

Mayor Siddiqui, I share my colleague's concerns. I also
understand it is incredibly challenging to figure out what

heard loud and clearly that a mask mandate is not something
being recommended. However, a very strong advisory is being
recommended. I, over the weekend, have gone into a couple
of places and it did stop me when there's a big sign on the
door saying, “Masks strongly encouraged”. That will
certainly help. It's short of a mandate, but anything we
can do to ensure that.
I think my question follows on some of what has been
raised, which is, how are we working to ensure that the
city staff, who are most vulnerable to this, for instance,
staff who cannot be remote, right? We know that some staff
can be remote, some can't. I understand about a third of
the library staff, for instance, has had COVID. About half
of them are since the mask mandate was lifted.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to do in this. I do have a question, um, I have -- we have

So how are we working to ensure that if, for instance,
there's a department or some other area of the city, where
the cases go up to a higher than expected account that we
are working with the staff to ensure that they feel that
43
Packet Pg. 1223

8

they can do their jobs well in service of this City and yet
also have the protection from, frankly, people like me who
may come in without a mask.

reaching out and making sure that we're working to ensure
the safety of that. And I think a follow on question while
I get it all out there is, can we put masks at the door of
any building, you know, City building people are entering
so make sure we do the message is there, but also the
ability if you don't have a mask with you that it's
actually immediately available. Thank you.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

So, uh, those are

great questions. I think we don't wait till uptick goes on.
We meet with our employees regularly on what we're doing in
terms of what the numbers look like. And I think, you know,
again, employees are -- can wear masks if they choose.
We've made that very clear.
Uh, so I think that's the way you do it and I think

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So I just want to understand how it is that we're

we've put in all the precautions, we've made rapid tests
available for our employees. So we've tried to make it as
simple as possible. We are very positive in terms of if
someone does get COVID, how many days they can be out.
44
Packet Pg. 1224

8

So I think we have a policy that works for our
employees. There's risks involved. I mean, we, we can't
stop government and we're doing the best we can. Uh, so

again, closely with the Public Health department, the
Personnel Director, but we can do that. We certainly had
masks, six a door, when they were a mandate.
And I, I don't -- we've, we've moved some of the creed
is out because we're not as formal as we used to be. And we
now have more than one door, but we certainly could try to
look at a way that we could make people aware that masks
are available if they want them. We certainly have the
masks.
I'd have to talk to David Kale, who's really been the
overseer of making sure that masks were available. See if
we can revisit a way that people realize if they would like
a mask that they'd be available for us. So I'd be happy to
talk to David. We've had that discussion, but revisited to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we'll continue to evaluate this, these risks. We work,

see if that makes sense at this time.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Those are my

questions. Um, thank you and I, like all of us, hope that
45
Packet Pg. 1225

8

we will get beyond this and we can if we all continue to
boost ourselves and get vaccinated.
Vice Mayor Mallon.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

through you, um, I just quickly wanted to say, uh, Chief
Neil brought up the fact that the 18 to 22-year-old age
group is declining in positive cases. And I think he
mentioned that that was because, um, students are – were -have already gone home. I know Harvard, uh, just continued
their mandatory, um, testing on April 28th and I believe
MIT did around that time as well. So that is -- that might
be why we're seeing a decline in that area or in that age
group.
So, um, I have two questions, one, um, to this City
Manager and to Mr. Neil, I know 5 to 11-year-olds are now
eligible for their booster shots. How are we as a City and,
and maybe this is a question for the, the Mayor for the
School Department, how are we messaging to parents that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Derrick.

CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK L. NEAL:

Thank

46
Packet Pg. 1226

8

you. Uh, through you Madam Mayor, uh, I wanna address that
question. I'm gonna let Doctor Dobberteen, our resident,
uh, not only, uh, Medical Director, but our Resident
Paediatrician, uh, answer that question in terms of what

DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we're doing on from a public health, uh, standpoint.
Thank you Derrick and thank you

Madam Mayor and Vice Mayor. Good evening, everyone. Uh, we
are very excited that boosters are gonna be available for
the 5 to 11 age group. Um, unlike earlier times in the
pandemic, when, uh, boosters have not -- vaccines have not
been readily available, vaccines are readily available.
Many families can get their boosters in their
pediatricians’ offices.
Uh, we offer boosters for children at the Windsor
Street Clinic weekly and we're looking at opportunities
over the course of the summer and into the fall of having
other vaccine opportunities that will be targeted towards
children. But, um, people should, should really have no
trouble getting a booster. And I think we're doing
everything we can with our social media accounts and
pushing out all our public health reminders to families to
get their children boosted, now that they're available five

months after finishing their first two primary series of
vaccines, uh, children 5-11 would be eligible for their
booster.

widely available and encouraging them. And I believe the -perhaps the Mayor can speak to this, but I believe the
Superintendent will be including information into her
communication to families as well.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I know the Superintendent did

send out a message today that had some information, but it,
it did not have, um, complete information about kind of
what I think you're looking for, Vice Mayor. But certainly
I don't see any reason why another communication wouldn't
be sent out with just some more information about, you
know, what Doctor Dobberteen just mentioned and, and
boosters and so forth. So I'll follow up.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you. I appreciate

that. I know, um, I'm always, uh, very happy to receive a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So I think it's getting the word out it's they're

postcard in the mail, especially, you know, the City has
done once in multiple language where, where they have the
QR codes that says, “If you need it in this language,
please just”.
48

So I think you, you know, -- the -- I know they are
readily available; they will be readily available. I think
it is all about getting that, that information out and we

the tools at our disposal. So thank you for following up on
that, um, Mayor Siddiqui and thank you to Dr. Dobberteen.
My second question is around, um, the mobile vaccine
booster clinics. Um, I, I'm excited that we're starting to
do these and have them around town.
My question is, there are a lot of events that
happened here in the City. Inman Eats was yesterday. There
was a citywide bike ride on Saturday. How are we
coordinating those mobile vaccine and booster clinics along
with community-sponsored – business-sponsored events, um,
to kind of marry up? What -- we know a lot of -- there were
so many people at Inman Eats yesterday. You know, I'm, I'm
sure a lot of them are like putting off making that booster
appointment, but would do it if it was right there. So how

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

have a lot of different ways to do it. So we should use all

are we doing that?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

So through you

Madam Chair, that's a great question. We actually talked to
the Chief about that a week ago about how do we focus on
49
Packet Pg. 1229

8

big events and how do we make people aware of it. I don't
know where they are with that discussion. I don't know if
anyone's on from fire or if, if Lee wants to talk about it,

events too to, to find out where it is.
And, again, we'll get this started and we'll -- as
soon as we get this all lined up and Lee just sent me the
text. They are in the process of finalizing with Special
Committee Event on what events we should be going to. Uh,
we'll get that to the council and we'll do everything we
can to advertise. But that was one of the spots we said we
– this -- it's a, it's an audience that we can't miss.
So it's not just getting the fire and to the Fire
Department's credit, these are difficult times because as
you get closer to the summer, you got vacation times and we
have a mandate -- dated on how many we have. So we wanna
make sure when we use the mobile, we use it correctly and
get the most for it. So that is something we'll be in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

but I know they're working with the special committee on

discussion with and we'll help give the council the
information. Thank you.

glad those conversations are happening. And as soon as
there's any decisions made, I think, the council would,
really would like to know.

the advisory is the way to go and I think if we can do
more, then, well, we want to do more. And so definitely to

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you I did, um, -- I do support this, um,
item and I will be voting for it, but I was surprised to

see it on the agenda. I just wanted to understand, you
know, if, if there was prior notice, you know, how it was
determined to fund this project from free cash versus the

CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Uh, through you

Madam Mayor, and I can turn it over to David as well. So
probably a year ago, uh, I received a call from some women
athletic employees from the School Department, who felt
like I should take a trip to Danehy Park with them and
listen to some of their concerns. Uh, they - I got to be
honest; they’re people I know and have great respect for
us.
So we went and what they were saying, made perfect
sense. They really felt like we needed to do, do something
for the young women and girls who were playing sports at
Danehy Park in terms of a facility. And at that time, we
talked about, to be very honest, anywhere from 2 to $4
million just off the cuff figuring. But I thought it was

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

capital budget.

the right thing to do and I said, let's get the ball
rolling and talked to the Athletic Director, who sent the
letter to us and talked to the Superintendent at the time
and everyone said it was positive.
53
Packet Pg. 1233

8

Danehy Park is a tricky facility to put a structure on
and we made that clear. So as we started to get some
momentum to move this forward, we said, well, if we're
gonna do it as Cambridge does it, let's do it right. And it
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

took us probably about a year to get to where we're at
today.
And with the intention that we were gonna do it, we
just wanted to make sure we had all the pieces and what
we've come up with today is a little different. It's much
bigger, but it's, it's what Cambridge the way thinks
Cambridge does it, but we – not that we're ready and we
have an estimate and we've got everything online. We just
thought that now it's time to come up and that's why it's
here today and it wasn't in the budget.
It was always gonna be free cash, but it was gonna be
based on when we felt we had the appropriate information
for the City Council. To be honest because we didn't think
it was gonna be $11, but when you're asking for this type
of request, you gotta make sure you have the proper backup.
So David is the point person for this and Paul Ryder and
Paul, you can please come on up to. Paul is a consultant
who was the former Recreation Director, who was uh the lead
54

Packet Pg. 1234

8

for the Universal Design Park and is now gonna be the lead
for this on the City side.
And David can talk about some of the process we went

the CRLS trainers and I wanna give a shout-out, especially
to Mary Shankwood [ph], who's been a lead in terms of
saying, “This is what we need to do. Here's how to go about
it”.
And I'm really excited to be able to do this, uh, at
this point in time because after the conversation with
them, I really felt like we -- this would be the right
thing to do. But David and Paul have been much more into
details other than my staying, let's try to figure out how
to do this and we've had to add a few other items as well.
So David, I don't know if you want to start.
ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER DAVID KALE:

Thank you. Through

you Madam Mayor, um, so this has been an inter-departmental
project, um, which is, and they were on the call Public

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

through to get to where we are. We really work closely with

Works and uh Electrical Department, IT. Paul -- Louis
mentioned Paul, um, the Schools and the Athletic Department
and the Human Services Department with the Rec director and
Assistant City Manager Semenoff and our architects and
55
Packet Pg. 1235

8

consultants. So I think this project has many complex
components and we had just recently and we've been meeting
this on this weekly for several months.

as you will note in the City Manager's letter, the scope is
pretty expansive in terms of the actual structure, but then
we've added to that, um, the, uh, Wi-Fi component to this
and bringing Wi-Fi to Danehy Park, uh, as well as
completing, uh, the Portland Loo for the DePasquale
Universal Playground Portland Loo as well as, uh, fixing
some of the amenities that, uh, have come up after we open
the park,um, as well as trying to deal with the parking lot
that where this will be sited, which is on the New Street
side of Danehy Park.
So to answer your question, I think this has become a
multi-faceted project in addition to the facility and we
weren't ready to include it in the capital budget when we
submitted the budget to the City Council. And we were also,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

We just finished our cost estimates and the scope. And

um, have determined that we can fund this from free cash
based upon our free cash balance, which, again, we
typically do when we make in fiscal year projects similar
to what we did for the purchase of the BB&N Field.
56

So there are times and that's why we have free cash to
basically do these one-time allotments. And based upon the
timing, this is why we're up to the Council now because we

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor and through you, I, I do appreciate, um, the
background and, you know, like I said, I mean, this looks
like a great project and I'm more than happy to support it
tonight. Um, but I think, you know, I, I would certainly
appreciate in the future and I know in other cases we've
gotten a heads up or, you know, some early briefings on,
you know, we're working on this project and we're thinking
about bringing it before the council for an appropriation.
I, I think, you know, and, you know, you may not have
realized initially that it was $11 million but, but when
you do realize that it's getting into that size and scope,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

have just completed the, um, um, road map as well as the

I, I think it would be helpful for the council to have a
little bit of a heads up that this is coming because it
just, it's surprising when, you know, especially during
budget season and, you know, we have a capital budget and

then all of a sudden we see the $11 million appropriation.
That is a bit of a surprise.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

Actually, Madam

unusual to come up with $11 million. Like I said, we didn't
think it was going to be that dollar amount, but, yes, we
could have probably given you the heads up. So I apologize
for that, but I think we're in a good place now and
hopefully we'll get the full support of the council. But
thank you,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you through you,

Mayor Siddiqui. This certainly has many really good things
in it. Equity in sports, Title IX was a long, long, long
time ago. Girls in this city have said that some of the
facilities are not equitable. So this is really terrific to
see that this was -- this is in response to some of that. I
think it was even a few years ago that I was on school

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor, I certainly appreciate those concerns. This is

committee when some of the girls talked about the lack of
support citywide for some of the girl sports.
I also want to call out that it includes the
possibility of running a city fiber cable, which may be if
58
Packet Pg. 1238

8

we do get municipal broadband. This is anticipating that
there'll be at least some kind of, um, public internet, WiFi. And there is, um, -- it also includes an, an

universal design playground.
I do have a specific question which is in line with so
many of the positive things about this project, including a
carbon neutral, fossil-fuel free facility, which of course
is also in line with our goals, whether we also considered
having a composting toilet instead of a traditional toilet,
which wastes a lot of water and would not require any
connection to the sewer and possibly save money. There are
ADA accessible toilets that are being used in a range of
places across the country from Walden Pond to ski resorts
to Carlisle State Park. And I'm wondering if that was
considered for the Universal Design Playground and if not,
why not, or if it can be at least looked at?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE:

I guess if you're

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

understanding that we need more facilities for the

talking about the facility, we're at the beginning of the
design process. So clearly, we'll put that on the list to
look at to see if it's feasible and practical. And then
with regard to the Portland Loo at the De Pasquale
59
Packet Pg. 1239

8

Universal Design Playground, I think we've done a lot of
homework on that and trying to find the right kind of
facility so that it can serve the constituents of the park.

And, again, I think we think that might be the best
application, but, uh, again, we can take a look at it. But,
I think, having that kind of facility for the playground at
this point appears to be the best solution. But I don't
know if you want to add, Paul, about what we're looking at
potentially as alternatives.
DIRECTOR OF RECREATION PAUL RYDER:

Given the

popularity of the playground, I mean, the additional
toilets, what you are talking surely we’ll look at –
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Could you speak into the mic

DIRECTOR OF RECREATION PAUL RYDER:

um, certainly, and given the popularity of the playground
is, you know, it's very crowded every day. We can add
60
Packet Pg. 1240

8

additional toilets that you're talking about, the
composting. So I think it's a great idea and, you know,
we're in the design phase right now so certainly we can, we

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. I, I do

recommend it. I mean, these are, you know, Misquamicut
Beach in Rhode Island, Salisbury in North -- there are
hundreds of thousands of visitors for these kinds of
toilets. It is the next stage of urban design around
sustainability. And honestly, if the state allows it, the,
um, the output from those can be used as fertilizers that
are natural fertilizers that do not have faeces and sludge
in it from municipal sludge.
So I, I, I take you at your word. I, I know probably
more about composting toilets than many people so feel free
to hit me up for this. Um, I also want to acknowledge that
one of the things you talk about here, which is something

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

can do that.

the council has heard from neighbors, is that the noise
concerns around the slide is something that was
unanticipated and it sounds like that is also part of this
project.

DIRECTOR OF RECREATION PAUL RYDER:

That's correct and

we're working with the playground manufacturer and the
architect daily. Um, so we are going to replace those

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. That's

really good to hear. It's unfortunate that this -- that,
that, that's something that is -- I have been by that park
a lot and it is definitely well-used and yet I also have
heard some of the noise that I think if I lived right near
there would be a challenge for me to not feel like, “Why
did they do this” without considering us that we want to
support it? And yet there are some issues.
So, again, I will take that, that the design will
include some of these other ideas for making it the more,
the most sustainable park we possibly can and also
acknowledge that the, the neighbors’ concerns about the,
about the slides will be addressed. Thank you. I yield,

lack of facilities and there's a Policy Order on tonight
about lack of bathrooms at, at playing fields. Um, so
that's one thing I'm really excited to see and I think this
is, this is great.
Um, couple of questions. Uh, one, it talks a lot
about, um, you know, the high school and, and, um, there's
gonna be some additional storage pace -- space for
Cambridge Youth Programs, -- uh, Sports Programs in terms
of like the bath house and all those that -- is that also

think, um, as much as we can do, I mean, the, the sports
programs at Danehy are exploding, right, between lacrosse
and soccer is. I mean, there's, they -- I think they said

something like that.
So, um, you know, as much as we can do to make all of
that available because those are our kids too, right? Um,
and so, um, I hope we do that and then I'm going to make a
plug. I know $11 million dollars is a lot of money. Maybe
this would cost a little more, but for years I've been
hearing from folks in the neighborhood and trying to get
some lights at the dog park out at Danehy. So as long as
you're putting in electricity and digging stuff up, maybe
we can, we can revisit that.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE: Uh, so through you
Madam Mayor, uh, that will be in discussion. I felt that we
really should talk to the neighborhood first, but I
understand what you're saying. I'll just leave it at that.

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to the Manager and his team. Um, like many of
us, uh, my confidence grew with playing sports as a kid.
And, um, and what amazes me is, although my wife is very
athletic. At our age, women didn't have the opportunities
that started 20/30 years ago. And my nieces -- it, it just
amazed me, uh, how they gravitated toward lacrosse and
obviously soccer, um, down in Virginia and Maryland.
Um, so I'm also thrilled. I'm not gonna repeat what my
colleague said. I think a lot of good points have been
raised, but it does really say, we're listening, and, and
we're building. And as far as the 11 million goes, as an
architect, I haven't seen a breakdown, but I have no doubt
foundations, uh, and utility, even utility connections are
going to be expensive. So that's one of the reasons.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

helpful feedback that you all provided at the last meeting
when we discussed this. And so we've incorporated, um, that
feedback into this Substitute Order, which I think will

much better reflect the, the will of the council.
Uh, as you know the City has received a total of 65
very inspiring community proposals from 40 – 41, uh,
individuals and organizations. And the total funds
69
Packet Pg. 1249

8

requested was over $188 million.
So it's very important that the council sets a very
clear policy direction in this area because we only have

benefit from not allocating all of that money right away.
And so -- and also that we should consider other council
priorities in addition to those community submissions such
as the fare-free transit and recommendations from the
Climate Crisis Working Group.
So this substitute addresses those concerns by
reducing the amount that's being allocated to $10.5 million
and offers more specificity around certain proposals. For
example, some of the proposals like Friends of Jerry's
Pond, Friends of Magazine Beach, the Boston area, um, the
Rape Crisis Center and, and Heart will require additional
funding beyond ARPA in order to achieve their mission. But
they would benefit greatly from partial funding from ARPA,
um, on the order of $500,000 each.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

about 30 million to allocate. And I agree that we could

So that's what this, uh, substitute asks for. Other
community submissions like the Cambridge Community Center,
Starlight Square hinge on substantial construction on Cityowned property. And so they would benefit from partial
70
Packet Pg. 1250

8

funding from ARPA to pay for feasibility studies and
initial design work, but then would likely need other
sources of funding to complete those projects.

substantial investments to -- into our nonprofit ecosystem,
but there's a separate request from the Cambridge Nonprofit
Coalition that would lead to funding for many deserving
nonprofits that did not submit a separate proposal of their
own. And so this substitute acknowledges that and asks that
we give additional consideration to that proposal outside
of this $10.5 million proposed allocation.
And then I've provided a more detailed breakdown in
the, uh, communication of how the money would be allocated.
And this proposal doesn't, uh, obviously contain
everything. So, you know, if, if colleagues want to
propose, uh, additional, um, funding or, or organizations,
you know, I'm certainly open to that and I recognize that
we will be discussing this in more detail at the committee

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

The -- you know, this proposal would make, uh,

meeting on Wednesday.
But I do think it's really important that the council
sets a clear policy direction for how we want to allocate
the remaining ARPA funds and the substitute attempts to do
71
Packet Pg. 1251

8

that in a, in a better way.
Um, I think the community submission process has
really brought out the best in Cambridge and I look forward

through ARPA or through other funding mechanisms. Tonight
is just the beginning and I ask that you join me in
advancing these 18 applicants. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will have a discussion.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

I think, uh, the outline which I've just seen, um, makes
sense and I think it should be discussed on Wednesday as,
uh, a possible, uh, breakdown. What the outline on
Wednesday, um. Councillor Nolan and I discussed will be
that we're inviting -- Mr. Kale is inviting 25 -approximately 25 proposers to briefly summarize what
they're doing. I'm sorry before that, he will explain what
ARPA requires.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI: Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN: Thank you, Mayor
Siddiqui. I do think it's a good idea for us to work
through and understand and discuss some of these proposals.
I'm having a hard time understanding why these were picked
out of others. Um, I, I just don't know where to go with
that.
I mean, one of the programs that I was just at their
celebration of Breakthrough Greater Boston isn't even on
this list and they have over 80% of all their low-income
students of color persisting in college. 95% go to college,
more than 80% persist. The contrast nationally is 14% of
low-income students persist.
So I don't know why we wouldn't at least have that be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

better. Thank you, Madam, Mayor.

named as one of the programs on this list. So if this list
is programs that we are saying we endorse of all the 41
projects, I, I can't support it now without understanding
what this list derived from.
73
Packet Pg. 1253

8

So, so that's -- I certainly appreciate there's every
single project is worthy. I just find it hard to understand
how we can reasonably come to agreement on, on this

definitely support the idea of having some of these funds
allocated to certain nonprofits in the city.
I also am glad that it does incorporate the ideas for
undertaking some of the recommendations from addressing the
climate crisis directly in the fare-free transit. But the
rest of it is just -- it's a little challenging for me
because I feel like I'd be picking and choosing and I, I
hope -- I don't think that's the intent, but, but it ends
up looking that way if we all have selected some from the
list of 41 projects and not others.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Simmons and then the Vice Mayor.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you Madam Chair

through you to my colleagues. Um I, I think I'm, I'm going

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

proposal for naming specific and not others in it. So I

in the same direction as my colleague, Councillor Nolan.
Um, I don't know, maybe the -- my -- the maker of the
motion can tell me who because he says, “What we”. I don't
know who the ‘we’ is because, um, I think very much in the
74
Packet Pg. 1254

8

same vein, there are groups that miss the first iteration
of the – the first opportunity, uh, to apply for funds.
Here was another opportunity, everyone didn't know

think of them -- they would probably bode well with, with
additional funds and I still -- I really struggle with -we've had this process, we allocated some, some funds. I'm
very concerned about if, if the intention is to, um,
allocate all the funds, but by naming some folks that were
invited to, to a process that other people weren't invited
to. And that may not be what happened here.
But I, I, I'm just concerned that we had a process.
People that I expected to be as on a -- as a part of that
ask, weren't there. And I, I just said, “Gee it's too bad
they missed it”. And now we have this other process;
they're not there either. So I don't know if they weren't
informed, they weren't invited. Uh, so as this stands, if
we were to -- if this is going to come to a vote, I could

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

about it. I don't see, um, now, read it again, the YWCA, I

not support it. I, I don't understand it enough.
I don't know and I'm not saying that the maker or
whoever worked on this, as a part was, was trying to be
exclusive, but in some ways it appears that it might have
75
Packet Pg. 1255

8

been exclusive because there are people that we all know
about. Councillor Nolan mentioned a group, I mentioned a
group. I, I don't know if others in the chamber know of

that there was a bite -- another bite at the apple. So, uh,
I, uh, I don't know if this will come up at the Finance
Committee or not, but if this is to be voted this evening,
I will not support it. I yield the floor.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Point, point of

information.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan state

your point.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN: The YWCA did not
apply for funding directly through this process. So that's
why they're not on this list.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Vice Mayor Mallon.

Not a Point Of Order, but thank you. He has had a point of
information. Uh, go ahead voice, Vice Mayor Mallon.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

other people that would have taken advantage if they knew

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I was gonna make that point, um, that Councillor Zondervan
made that. Um, some of the organizations that were brought
up here tonight with the YWCA, the Breakthrough, they did
76
Packet Pg. 1256

8

not submit a community, um, application, but I think that
that's where the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition and their
sort of bulk funding that they've suggested that they --

organizations who may not have submitted on time or have
not known about it.
Um, I, I would have to say that if we were voting on
this tonight, I would have to vote present because I do
still work for Food for Free, um, the nonprofit that is
mentioned -- one of the nonprofits that's mentioned on this
Policy Order. But I do wonder if it would be prudent at
this juncture since we are having a conversation in the
Finance Committee next week to refer this P O to the
Finance Committee to have a larger conversation as we're
talking with David Kale and, uh, other members of City
Staff. It doesn't seem like tonight, I'm just guessing by
the body, the will of the body that, um, we would want to
move forward on this tonight. Um, so I would like to make a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that would increase the access to this ARPA funding by

motion to refer this to the Finance Committee for a fuller
discussion at that time.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So Vice Mayor, we have

Councillor Zondervan's motion to obtain – to just -- to
77
Packet Pg. 1257

8

amend by substitution. So we would have to do that first
and we could vote up -- that up or down and then we can
vote on your, um, -- to refer the whichever P O to the

communication late, late communication to the finance.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON: Yes, everything that's
for –
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Everything.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

-- us tonight should get

referred to.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay, I just wanted to make

sure. I, I do have Councillor Azeem. So let me go to
Councillor Azeem. We, we can -- you can talk about the
amendments that are before us.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um,

I wanted to first start off by say -- by thanking
Councillor Zondervan for his amendment. For me, at least,
I, I support these amendments and I think that it makes it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

finance hearing and then I assume you wanna do the

a stronger case overall. Um, and I would be happy to
support it, um, either way tonight. Um, I think I wanted to
comment on the Vice Mayor's point.
I think, having talked to the City Manager a few days
78
Packet Pg. 1258

8

ago and just a few hours ago, um, uh, about like the ARPA
hearings, I think that there is a sense that on Wednesday
they wanted to get a sense from the City Council on what

And so I think it would actually be even more powerful
if this was referred to Wednesday's meeting where we could
have it as a template and make adjustments based on what
other City Council priorities are and have it as a
recommendation or something that we can work and come out
of. So I would support, uh, forwarding this to the Finance
Committee. Um, I would prefer the amended version, but I
would be fine with preferring the original as well.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor Azeem.

Any new -- from folks we have -- we haven't heard from on
this before I go back to folks we've already spoken, we've
already made a point. Go to Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you and, and thanks to my colleagues for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

matters to us and how to allocate the remaining funding.

their comments. Um, I, I again want to clarify that one of
the things that this substitute does is it narrows the
scope from the remaining 30 million to 10.5 million so that
naturally creates space for other ideas and proposals that
79
Packet Pg. 1259

8

are not on the, on this list to also receive funding.
So it, it narrows the scope so that we can be more
specific about funding these proposals. But in no way is it

ultimately wish to fund. Um, I, I support referring this to
committee. I think that's a fine way to go. I do ask my
colleagues to vote on the vote in favor of the substitute
because I think it is an improvement over the original.
Thank you Madam Mayor.
And I wanted to just to, uh, before I go to Councillor
Carlone, I think Vice Mayor Mallon you had said something
about Breakthrough earlier and I think Breakthrough did
apply through ARPA, um, but the YWCA did not. So I think
that's what I heard, but I just wanted to confirm. I'll go
to Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you. Uh, our ARPA

meeting is Wednesday, two days from today at 2 o'clock. Um,
One of the -- and I support having, uh, a thought out list

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

meant to or does it exclude other proposals that we

that we can respond to. So that's why I see and I haven't
looked at it in detail, but I, I support that because it's
a reference that we can use, uh, even if we want to change
the numbers dramatically, it's a good reference.
80
Packet Pg. 1260

8

But I, I just wanna highlight that, uh, ARPA requires
certain kinds of projects and it's likely that not all 25
meet those requirements. So even on this list, and I

areas that we want covered, individually want covered might
not be eligible. And, um, and that it takes a long time for
the City to research that longer than you know, oh, that'll
be done in 20 minutes. It's not that at all.
So it's one of the things that I've asked Mr. Kale to
go over on Wednesday, what that criteria is and, um, and we
might all be disappointed in that or not. I don't know yet.
So I just wanted to highlight that, Mayor. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. Thank you, Councillor

Carlone. So hearing no one else, I think we can go ahead
and do a vote on the Substitute Order. Uh, and from there
we'll vote to refer the whichever order passes to the
Finance Committee along with the late communication from
other officers. So roll call on Councillor Zondervan’s

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um

As you know, two weeks ago, we placed, uh, the linkage fee
on the table. Um, the thought process behind that is just
that ordinances have a time limit and based on the, uh, way
that our summer meetings were looking, um, I was worried
that, um, it was very likely that the ordinance would
expire before we got to a meeting where we could ordain it,
especially after the second meeting because it has to go to
a second hearing and there was a time delay in there.
Um, I think that time has now passed. And so I would
be, uh, happy to refer this to the, uh, Planning Board and
the Ordinance Committee. Um, I just wanted to, again, thank
Councillor Simmons for all of her hard work on this and for
Councillor Zondervan as Chair of the Ordinance Committee,

like to offer an amendment, uh, where in line eight in

up and allow for, um, the project at 125, Cambridge Park

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you.

Drive to go forward. We've heard from Mr. Lerner [ph] about
a number of amenities that they would like to be putting in
there. I actually personally walked the property, uh, last
week.
87
Packet Pg. 1267

8

Um, a number of things that we as a council say that
we want to see happening in the Alewife Triangle area, um,
the things that they're proposing, doing more open space,

I think will bring great value and, um, recreational
activity to folks working and living in the area.
Um, I know personally that my intention was never to
hold up, uh, projects in the Triangle. Uh, that when we
talked about the overlay project for me, it was about the
Quadrangle. Um, so I'd like to offer this amendment.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Toner can you say

the, uh, amendment for us one more time?
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Uh, It's simply to say,

Alewife Overly Districts, it says 1 through 6 now, I'd like
to change it to 1 through 5.

have it?

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay, we're gonna put it up.

So we'll have that. Before us I do have a few hands up, uh,
88
Packet Pg. 1268

8

to discuss the amendment. So we'll go to Councillor Nolan
and then Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, uh, Mayor

Siddiqui. Uh, thank you, uh, Councillor Toner for reaching
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

out and, uh, looking at the entire district. I would not
support this change for a number of reasons. I don't think
we should exclude any part of the area.
The Alewife Envision Plan, the plan from 1979, every
plan that has ever been done in the Alewife area includes
all of the area of Alewife and they include it for a, a
good reason. Uh, it is one ecosystem to begin with. It is
an area of the city that has had heat effect and the heat
island effect as bad as other places. It has had flooding
as bad or worse as the other side of the tracks and all
around Alewife, it is in the same flood plain.
So it's really critically important then when we plan
for this area, we include the entire area and understand
that the planning and zoning that we should do, should be
in concert with a comprehensive view of the entire area as
per all of the plans that, um, have gone forth, uh, looking
at this area, they include that area as part of the, as
part of the same system.
89

Packet Pg. 1269

8

The other thing is, well, I understand, I appreciate,
I too have walked it several times in the last month. I'm
very familiar with the area. It is mostly built out, but

that are not owned by the, the 125, Cambridge Park Drive,
who have done exemplary work. They are open lots that if we
don't include it, could well, um, be the next stage for not
being included in the comprehensive planning and zoning
that I hope we do.
And I would say, we also need to remember part of the
whole reason for this planning is to make sure that it is
connected that there's either a commuter rail or a bridge
that, that goes on either side of the, of the tracks, which
means it would be, I think, sub-optimal for us to not
include the other side of the tracks since a key part of
what we're all hoping what the City Council has stood up
for. What all the planning processes in the neighborhood
has asked for is a connection across the tracks or

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

there are still a number of parcels that are not built out,

underneath the tracks or both.
And I'm certainly looking at, at the ways that we can
do that, if we exempt the entire northern side of it, then
that means it would -- maybe more difficult for that to be
90
Packet Pg. 1270

8

part of the, the inclusive process that I hope to see. And
I will also say, It’s -- at this point, the way it's
written, we're only talking about a year-and-a-half, we're

We have, uh, the City saying that they can get this
process done in nine months. I would also want all the, um,
players to be at the table. There would have not any
incentive to be at the table if they are excluded. So I
want everyone we can to be at the table and to help
pressure all of us in the City to get a thoughtful planning
process and zoning done as expeditiously as possible.
So I, I appreciate the intent and I'm certainly
sympathetic to, um, some of the. the work that has been
done. On the other side, I have, as I say, uh, used that
area, I’ve been there, been to the cafes on both sides, um,
and, and yet I do think it, it would be much better for us
to continue to view this as originally intended in all of
the plan that we have ever done, which is include the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

not talking about a moratorium of two or three years.

Overlay Districts 1-6. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We're going to Councillor

Azeem, Councillor Carlone and then I think I have
Councillor Simmons.
91
Packet Pg. 1271

8

COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Uh, thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, yeah, I think this is a very interesting conversation
because I agree with everything Councillor Nolan has said,

project and projects, in general, under the current zoning
are not my ideal, uh, for what would be happening in the
Triangle. Um, and I do think that prioritizing the, the
crossing, pedestrian crossing and other sorts of
development is very important.
Um, at the same time. I'm not sure what we would
achieve by including District 6. The special permits have
already been issued or far enough along in the process that
as we discussed last time with a solicitor, this wouldn't,
uh, -- they wouldn't be subject to the new zoning and so
these projects are going to happen anyway; they've just
been -- they'll just be delayed two years, which will just
add to the cost and expense to them. Um, and this does not
prevent the, um, committee from developing new zoning that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

but come to a different conclusion. Um, I think that this

will affect the Triangle if they so choose.
Although I think that my understanding from the
committee and what, like, the stakeholders on the table
want to do is really focus on the Quadrangle. But if they
92
Packet Pg. 1272

8

want to focus on the Triangle, they're still welcome to do
so and propose new zoning. I think the only practical
effect this has is on, uh, just delaying the project that

Toner’s amendments tonight.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Carlone and then Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, I too also visited the site and had a very good meeting
with Mr.Lerner and seeing what they've done. And there's no
doubt that this developer cares about making a sense of
place, where there is none and almost every move they've
made have improved the environment, not just for their
buildings, but for the whole surrounding area. And I last
week talked about doing what Councillor Toner has proposed.
Um, but over the weekend, I went back out and, um, I agree
with Councillor Nolan now.
And part of the reason is the committee that is being

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

will happen anyway. And so, um, I would support Councillor

set up to review this, including may -- many neighborhood
people, uh, have asked me to not support the amendment in
front of us. And, um, and I've concluded that that is the
right thing that as much as I felt this developer should be
93
Packet Pg. 1273

8

rewarded for everything they've done in a sense that spot
zoning intent. And, um, it's not a negative on the
developer. I'm actually very impressed and I feel awkward

But, um, I'm pretty convinced with the integrity of
the study, including some large, uh, a lot that everybody
says, “Oh, nothing will happen in the two years, um, owned
by, um, Mr. Chan. It's nevertheless a large lot in this
district. And, um, that does need to be part of this study.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Simmons and then Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Chair.

Uh I think I certainly agree with my colleague, Councillor
Turner and Councillor Azeem, but there's something that,
um, Councillor Nolan said that, uh, for me to want to make
remarks. I know we're very well-intended about doing things
in a timely fashion. And I, I do truly believe that we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that I have to go in an opposite direction.

believe that we will do things in a timely fashion, but
often it does not happen too often. It does not happen and
so I heard very -- I listened very intently to the
developer that came to speak on this issue.
94
Packet Pg. 1274

8

I appreciate the work and the time that Councillor
Toner put into this. and I also know that, although we're
very intentioned about trying to do things in a timely

gonna have, uh, impact on where things can go and how fast
they proceed. So I would respectfully support the, uh, the,
uh, the order that the coun -- my council colleague,
Councillor Toner has submitted. I think it is the prudent
and smart thing to do. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, I think precisely because we want this
to happen quickly, it's really important that we include
the full area in the moratorium and not try to split off
the Triangle. As Councillor Nolan has explained, they need
to be planned together.
The whole point of the moratorium is to say, we don't
want anything to go forward while we do the planning. So it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

fashion, we're gonna have a new City Manager that is all

doesn't make sense to exclude the Triangle, but then to say
it should be part of the planning. If it's part of the
planning, it needs to be part of the moratorium. So I will
not be supporting this amendment. Thank you.

acknowledge and thank our City Clerk and I'm gonna take a - the moment to read it.
It says, “Whereas Anthony Wilson winds down his tenure
as City Clerk, the City Council thanks him for leading this
critical office for over the past few years and for his
steadfast commitment to providing exemplary service to the
people of Cambridge. And whereas since assuming this role
in the summer of 2019, uh, Clerk Wilson has led his
department through an eventful period, dealing with the

challenges presented by COVID-19, ensuring that all
important City Council Committees have always had adequate
staffing and leading his office through a time of
modernization and transition.
100
Packet Pg. 1280

8

He has done so by being unfailingly professional,
accessible and unflappable and the City is better off his
having served. And whereas Anthony Wilson leaves his role
with the City to continue making his mark on the world. And
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

it is certain that he shall continue to bring the same
energy, enthusiasm and ability to draw out the best in
those around him as he enters his next exciting chapter.
Now, therefore, be it ordered that the City Council
formally go on record and thanking Anthony Wilson for his
service -- years of service to the Cambridge -- City of
Cambridge in his role as City Clerk. And then wishing him
the very best of all future endeavours and be it further
ordered that he goes downstairs and gives himself a
[inaudible 02:28:07] gross copy of this resolution on
behalf of the entire City Council”.
Um, Madam, uh, Madam Mayor, uh, I am happy, but
saddened that Clerk Wilson is leaving our employ. He has
been an extraordinary gentleman. He has brought his best.
Uh, I have talked to the folks that work with him and they
all feel happy for him, but sad as well because what he has
brought to the office, very collaborative and genuine and
thoughtful.

Um, I hope he does very well in the next chapter of

you. But in my absence, job well done, Clerk Wilson and I

beautiful resolution unto our City Clerk. I have to say
that he is bright red here in the chamber. It's not easy to
listen to accolades, but I, I hope that you are ready
because they are coming.
Uh, we have been fortunate enough to have you as our
City Clerk for the past several years, especially during
such a tumultuous time, not only in our community, but our,
our country. As you know, I know you, you and your office

you are always our North Star and knowing what to do, how
to do it. And um I really -- I can't say this enough, I
will miss you. I do wish you the best in what is coming

I hope that you keep in touch and that this time in
Cambridge, um, that you treasure it that as you move
forward. Um, the, the positives come -- rise to the top and

something I wasn't supposed to do. Um, but you are steady
hand, uh, and especially on ordinance, which can get a
little bit mucky and we often have to go to you and rely on
you to help lead us to the light and you have done that.
And, um, I hope I can still get my barbecue sauce, uh,

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um,

I just wanted to say, through you to the Clerk. I know I

Parliamentary Procedure. And I think that I have
appreciated the support and I'm sure Councillor Simmons has
as well as I've picked up the detail and the nuances.
And I think that, you know, you have made my time on
the council a lot easier and have supported all the
different things that we've been trying to do. And I very
much appreciate that, um, and I'm sad to see you go so
early.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

it is incredibly challenging and also important in the

A range of questions have come up over the last couple
of years that have been quite, um, murky when I first
wondered about how to, uh, work, do my job. And you are
incredibly helpful on a professional level that, that made
me understand, I think better the role of what it, what it
takes to run a council and to run a City Clerk's office.
And I'm very grateful for that. Plus personally, you
have among the best Christmas cards I've ever seen with
those, that family that is unbelievably adorable. Maybe
we're not supposed to get too personal, but I appreciate
that side of you as well that you are, um, a full person.
You bring your heart and soul and mind and many, many hours
to the job. I wish you well in the future and I do still

Um, I hope I get a Christmas card, uh, this year uh,

first six months on the council and it's been great to, to
get to work with you. Thank you.

prepared. [laughs]. Um, I think it goes without saying, um,
after the COVID years and figuring out how to do the, um,
hybrid meetings, you and I have really been partners and
you helped my position kind of grow in a way that was kind
of a unexpected blessing of the pandemic. So I appreciate
you and I, of course, will miss you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay, last but not least, um,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

somehow.

[laughs] we've been through some good times and some bad
times and I'll never forget when we first got Zoom bombed
and how angry I was about it[laughs].
I took the anger out on you and I was like, “How did

you let this happen?” It was -- who knew what Zoom bombing
was and there it was so, um, I'll miss you and, you know,
thank you for all the help and the guidance and, uh, you

it was just fun getting to know you and work with you. So I
wish you the best.

Oh, oh, yes. And would we like

to have the Clerk say any -- say a few words?
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

I want to have the

Clerk say a few words would be free before he free, because
I want him to have the last word. Uh, someone mentioned
COVID and COVID was certainly a gray cloud in our lives.
But I want to say to you, uh, Mr. Clerk, if COVID was the
gray cloud, you were certainly the silver lining. I turn
the floor over to you.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Uh, thank you. I'm not --

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

know, I think, um, and there will be some shoes to fill and

I don't usually speak that much during the meetings. Um,
and I'll keep this brief because we all know how long the
meetings can be. Um, but uh I was gonna say that, uh, it
really has been -- there's just a couple of things I just
108
Packet Pg. 1288

8

wanna touch on.
Um, I come from another community and I've actually
sort of as an, as a lawyer I’ve worked in several

of my staff downstairs, really phenomenal, phenomenal, uh,
team members, phenomenal people to work with. Um, I, I, you
know, you always -- when you go to a place you always hope
to have good people to work with that you can rely on and
they really took it to the next level. I was, in fact, very
surprised by their willingness to pitch in and do things.
So, um, as I sit up here, receiving the accolades, I really
have to give it back to the people behind me who really
made it, uh, uh, happen.
And then to, uh, the City Council, I really have
enjoyed working with all of you even though sometimes it
can be frustrating at times. But, um, one of the things
that I do see here is really some of the best parts of
democracy. Everyone that I look around on the table,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

communities. Um, the staff, Paula Crane, the other members

whether I personally agree or don't agree with their, um,
particular positions, are strong advocates. I do see those
of you listening to one another.
If you guys get mad at one another, I just encourage
109
Packet Pg. 1289

8

you, um, that these are your colleagues and, and, and the
passion is real and it's -- and from what I can see is very
rooted in a place of community and how you all see one

future that your community be. And you really have -- we've
been through in the three years that I've been here, um,
some shakeups in politics, uh, at variety of levels.
And really this body gives me a lot of faith, um, that
people, good, people, passionate people, people who care
about the things that they're saying, are still being
elected, are still working on behalf of their colleagues or
on behalf of their, um, the residents and the people in the
city. So I, I can't really say enough.
I really have appreciated being here. Um, I've really
appreciated working at the very and I as a Clerk I'm very
fortunate.

I get to work with the City Manager. I get to

work with my staff, I get to work with the City Council in
a lot of roles you don't get to do that. You get to see

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

another or how you see yourselves in your community, in the

your, um, one aspect of the organization and it really has
been fortunate that the people of Cambridge really do have
an extraordinary organization working on their behalf and
for their needs. And I, I just appreciate you guys gave me

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

[laughs] Okay, I'm

gonna be quick so that we can go and celebrate our Clerk.
So on 2 and 4, I thank you Madam Chair. I want to bring
these two policies on the heels of our having our initial
conversation on the ideal, uh, Working Ideal Report several
weeks ago back in the Civic Unity Committee meeting.
And while I think that that was a solid initial
conversation, I am mindful of how much time it's taking to
schedule these hearings to take to really, um, obtain a
sense of what progress we're making toward the
recommendations out lied -- outlined in the Working Ideal
Report and to obtain a sense of how we can make concrete
strives in acting on these recommendations.
So these two orders are designed to move this pro –

and 4.

progress -- process along with more, with more, um,
urgency. And I hope my colleagues will support both of
them. The idea behind #4, which talks about Anti-bias
Training is this was, you know, we, um, and the searches
121
Packet Pg. 1301

8

for the Clerk and the City Manager, we utilized a process
where we did an Anti-bias Training Module and I thank the
Mayor and the Vice Mayor for agreeing because when I sort

and we did. Uh, having this on Anti-bias Training, it was
just an important part, I think, of the process because one
of the things that struck me during both processes is that
the City Council does a very limited amount of direct
hiring.
And the City as an employee, certainly engages in the
screening, interviewing and hiring of potential employees.
So the -- it was important that we do Anti-bias Training
because we don't hire generally, but we talk about being a
bias-free organization. And so with that in mind, I wanted
to become a part, a standard part of our process, a core
pillar of our process because if we don't and we continue
to, to not have it across the entire, um, hiring processes
that happen within the City, then shame on us.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

of insisted, I think this is really important that we do it

So I just wanted to make sure that it's codified that
we are recruiting, screening and, and, and, um, really
working at making sure that we are having as bias-free a
hiring process as possible.
122
Packet Pg. 1302

8

Because a School Department already incorporates this
into their hiring processes; DHSP does it and they hire a
lot of their hiring processes, but we do not do it

support these Policy Orders as one step further as being a,
um, anti-bias, a bias-free organization. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Have Councillor Zondervan

next.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor through you, um, thanks to my colleague for bringing
this forward. I certainly support both of these Policy
Orders. I did want to ask about what we heard in public
comment earlier this evening from a City employee, who felt
that Native American people were not being fully included
in, in our anti-bias work. I, I don't know if there's any
way to address that through these Policy Orders or if we
should do that separately. But I, I did wanna ask about,
um, you know, that, that concern that was raised this, this

citywide. So I'm hoping that my colleagues will, um,

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Madam Chair, it's not

something I could answer directly, but what I would say, I

think that is a very important consideration. That's
something that I don't want to bog it down by saying, let's
put it in committee because it's so hard for us to get

And so what I would say, I would invite one or two
other colleagues to sit down and let's have a conversation
and put some language on the floor and I muse and say -- I
say one or two because I wanted for us to be as invested in
it, uh, to move it forward.
But I also know -- but it would take several weeks
maybe past -- um, before we go past our break to get this
before, uh, the council through a committee process. But if
we put together a Policy Order, a few of us work together
to do that, we can get that on the books and then continue
to move forward. So I would recommend and I would certainly
be willing to meet with you Councillor and any other two
Councillors that wanna make themselves available to have
that discussion.

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Chair.

Uh, I'm hoping my colleagues will support this order as
well. This was a part of the Working Ideal Report. They had

trying to have another meeting with them, but it's been
hard to get them.
So I thought it was really important for us not to
stop or waste any more time. It is important that we have a
Talent Officer and the order speaks for itself. The School
Department has a, a Talent Officer. Someone that goes out
and seeks good help, helps us hold on to them. Not only
recruit them, but hold on to them.
One of the things that came on I wanna say, it was in
one of our Clerk interviews, someone spoke about the
importance of a Talent Officer and I, I wondered why when
we have this report, we've had it for a couple of years too
and it has never come before us, um, as an idea.
So I'm hoping that this passes so that we can start to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

a number of recommendations and we're going to -- we are

be more intentional about, um, how we get people to, to
apply. And, and let me go back, it would -- actually came
up in the Clerk's interview and there was one candidate
that was extraordinary.
126
Packet Pg. 1306

8

Uh, a large pool of candidates not appropriate for
the, for the Clerk's position. But we said, “Gee, how could
we hold on to someone like, like this, this, uh,

forward the resume to say, “This person, I know fits.” I
think a job that's either coming down the pipe or a job
that's already open, but we don't have that right now.
So opportunities, good qualified folks, particularly,
uh, people of color get away because they don't -- they are
not -- we don't, we, we are not aggressively reaching out
to bring them in. So I'm hoping, again, this Policy Order
will prevail and then we could, um, get to the work of
hiring someone and then really begin, begin to get some
really serious candidates here hired and, and stay. I yield
the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We are going to Policy Order

#5 that the City Manager being hereby is requested to
direct -- Director of Traffic Parking and Transportation
Department to limit the blocking off of Memorial Drive to
vehicle traffic to Sundays. Councillor Simmons, you have
the floor. This was filed by Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Okay. Thank you. Thank

you. And, and I do know, um, there's another -- I think,
uh, Councillor Toner wanted to speak to this. Um, I wanna
thank you Madam Chair. I, I wish to note that when the
closures, the closures of Memorial Drive to vehicular

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Paul F. Toner – Yes

traffic was initially introduced, it was during the height
of the padam -- pandemic at a time when fewer people were
leaving their homes and getting in their cars to travel
anywhere. It was a different time.
128
Packet Pg. 1308

8

Travel levels were significantly lower than prior to
the onset of the pandemic and certainly lower than they
currently are now. When the concept of closing Memorial

in the council meeting last October, it was never suggested
that this would be in perpetuity.
The order that was brought in by, by my colleagues
asked that the City Manager explore extending closure hours
until at least the final Sunday in December, 2021, but it
never stated in perpetuity. It also never said, let's not
talk to the, to the community. Let's not engage the
community.
And that's important to note because prior to doing
anything permanent is important that the City reach out to
the residents and give them an opportunity to weigh in.
Share their thoughts on how the City's ideas may impact
them. I believe we skipped that important step and I, I
know this to be the case because when I spoke to, um,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Drive to vehicular traffic on Saturday was last discussed

people in traffic and parking and transportation, I said,
did we have a community meeting? And they said, “No, we, we
should have, but we didn't.” I said, did DCR have a public
meeting?
129
Packet Pg. 1309

8

And they said, “No, they didn't.” Now, we also know
that DCR isn't great at public meetings. So we have not
engaged a very important [member] in the implementation of

neighborhood that it's going to impact. So the City should
have reached out to the residents and to give them an
opportunity to weigh in and share their thoughts on how the
city's ideas may impact them.
I believe we skipped that step. And while many people
may feel that this is a no brainer that we should indeed
close off Memorial Drive to vehicles every weekend, we are
hearing from a number of residents that is -- this is
having an adverse impact on them.
So all I'm asking is that we give all the residents,
particularly those that are impacted the, uh, those in
favor of the weekend closures and, and those that are in
opposition to the closures, the opportunity to weigh in to
share their thoughts and allow us all to feel that we have

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

closing Memorial Drive and that is the people in the

been heard. You have heard me say on a number of occasions,
there's gonna be the -- somehow we have to get to the
unhappy medium.
So the City leadership, um, should and I implore my
130
Packet Pg. 1310

8

colleagues to support, to support the idea of this because
we should not disenfranchised one segment of the community
or one neighborhood in order to help some other part of the

but that has been the impact.
So regardless of what this decision, the City Council
ends up making here, I think it's important to provide the
opportunity to our constituents. And that's the opportunity
to share their experience, to voice their concern and to
let them know what we do and -- what we do and that we care
about what they have to say. And, and I think that has been
a missed opportunity.
So going forward and I said this when it came up when,
um, one of my colleagues brought up, “Let's do it more in
the eastern end of the city.” And I said, we have to engage
people and I, I, I, I have to say, engaging people might
mean you dispatch people to knock on the door and say,
“We're having this meeting, please come out. It's gonna

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

neighborhood. Now, I don't think that was the intention,

have impact on your community.”
So this is not trying to split the community ap -apart. It's about, it's about how do we make a segment of
our community to feel more whole. It's an opportunity for
131
Packet Pg. 1311

8

us to push back on the DCR and say, “You can't do this to
our community and not talk to the people in that
community.”

that we haven't done and I know I am convinced that this
council wants to do right to this particular segment of the
community that's saying, “Wait, halt, hold on for a minute.
We need an opportunity to be heard.” This might work for
some, but it doesn't necessarily work for us. So I, at this
point, I will yield the floor to hear from some of my
colleagues on this order.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Madam Mayor, Point

Of Order.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I have Councillor Zondervan

and then I have Councillor Toner.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you Madam

Mayor. I, I believe, uh, this order is, um, a duplicate
because we in February --well, it was adopted on March 7,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, there's just so many, um, things that we can do

uh, Policy Order 2022 #34. The first order states that the
City Manager being hereby is requested to work with DCR to
establish a 2022 schedule for Riverbend Park that includes
weekly Saturday and Sunday closures, starting no later than
132
Packet Pg. 1312

8

April two, if not sooner and be it further. And that order
was adopted by a vote of 8-0.
And I believe my colleague was not present for that

didn't realize that we passed that order, but it, um,
presents exactly this on this issue. And the council voted
to ask DCR to close, uh, Riverbend Park on both Saturday
and Sunday. So this order to ask now to reverse that
decision, uh, is, I believe, out of order.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

I will -- Madam Chair,

I would be strictly ask to hear from my other colleagues
before I respond to Councillor Zondervan.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I’ll have councillor – I’ll

have the Clerk opine on whether this is duplicate order. I
mean, it’s out of order.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Think, I’m sorry,

Councillor I was distracted for a second. Can, can you just
tell me which meeting this was in, the number?
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

It was, uh, adopted

on March 7, 2022. It was Policy Order 2022, # 34.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Uh, thank you Madam Mayor.

I, uh, I'll just -- I'd like to speak to the point that
Councillor Zondervan just brought up. But also, uh, the
Policy Order itself, um, uh, that I voted, uh, with the 80
on that. But I, I have to say, uh, this is just another
example in my opinion of us not doing outreach to the
community because when I asked, I, I was going to vote,
‘no’ on that, that night because we've also voted to close
it at night.
And I asked questions about how did this go last year?
Everybody said it was fine. Nobody complained. I said,
well, why are we closing at night? And people said, “Oh,
well, you know, we had, you know, it makes it easier for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

up, I will allow Councillor Toner and then Councillor

everybody.” And the moment that we put this into effect, I
got two emails from people saying, why are you closing it
at night?
Uh, you know, why are you, uh, uh, open -- closing
134
Packet Pg. 1314

8

down the streets and bringing loud trucks to my house at 7
o'clock in the morning, waking my children, uh, to put, uh,
put the barriers in place. So I, I just -- I do have to say

that evening because I was told it wasn't a problem last,
last time.
Uh, that being said, um, I, I don't want to prevent
others from speaking to this, but it's my intention to
charter, right, this Policy Order so that I can work with
my colleague, uh, uh, Councillor Simmons and anybody else
to try to address some of the issues we've heard tonight.
Um, I don't want us, you know, not have people have access
to, uh, uh, the Riverway on Saturdays.
But I do think there are legitimate concerns from
people who are living in the proximate neighborhood who are
being impacted and I think we need to do some community
outreach with those folks to see if we can find, uh,
opportunities to mitigate the problem. Thank you. I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that I felt like I, I took a vote under false pretences

So, Councillor Toner,

I just want to require your -- you're not exercising
your Charter Right just yet? Okay, so there's no charter,
right? So we're going to go back to the discussion at hand.
135
Packet Pg. 1315

8

I had Councillor Nolan next.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you Mayor

Siddiqui and, uh, Councillor Simmons for pointing at us to

closure. I am glad that Councillor Zondervan did the point
of information. There had been the Policy Order passed
March 7th of 2022 asking for actually two things. One was
the extension by days to Saturday and Sunday and then a
separate question of expanding it beyond the current length
of a long Memorial Drive.
And that was something we all got a report back from
the City Manager in response to this awaiting report
saying, that DCR had been very interested in working to
continue to expand the hours of Riverbend Park, including,
and they note in it, that this could potentially involve
opening Riverbend Park for the entire weekend. Um, and then
regarding the sec – we got in a second item, which had been
amended to ensure that there was a community outreach

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

a number of residents who have concerns about, about this

before any expansion happened. DCR expressed an interest in
looking at this and recognized that it would be through
community and stakeholder engagement process. And they were
in the process of, of setting that up.
136
Packet Pg. 1316

8

That answer from the City Manager was received, I
believe on March 28th, 2022 that's when it was placed on
file. So we got a relatively quick reply to our request of

had asked for a similar opening in 2021 that did happen
starting in April. We had also asked for a similar opening
in 2020, um, that would -- took a few weeks to be delayed
and it was worked out. But then that also passed.
There had been some real concerns at the beginning of
COVID about whether this was the best thing to have people
gather in large numbers. And, in fact, it turns out that
that was a positive, partly to provide people with a way to
get together outside. I, uh, understand that some of the
traffic implications are challenging and yet my, my read on
it having -- I both bike and I walk and I also drive my car
is that weekdays are actually even more challenging in that
there's far more traffic.
I understand that there will be a, a Substitute Policy

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

March 7th to remind us of the body. As has been noted, we

Order if this is not charter-rided put forth, which I, I
fully support for us to try to mitigate some of the
impacts. This is something that, uh, goes a long way
towards us, opening up one of the most beautiful elements
137
Packet Pg. 1317

8

of our city, which is the Riverfront for more people. I
also believe for equity purposes, I would love to see this
extended to along the entire length of Memorial Drive,

and, and we certainly don't want to have traffic bollixed
up all the time. But I, I certainly think we can do more to
ensure that even more residents can benefit from it.
And as we heard in public comment, there are some
people who are very concerned about this and we need to
think about and understand their concerns. And then there
is also over 2000 people who signed a petition, over half
of whom are Cambridge residents, urging us to continue to
keep this park open for both Saturday and Sunday.
And they are finding it a welcome change to our city
and putting us on the map for joining the legions of cities
across the, the world actually, who are trying to use some
of the public space more as parks and gathering spots.
So I would not be able to support the current Policy

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

understanding there are challenges because of cross streets

Orders written if – if it turns out – we -- it is in order
before us. And from what I understand of the substitute
motion, it's very much in line with what I think we should
do in turn -- in terms of moving forward, continuing to
138
Packet Pg. 1318

8

broaden the access to the Riverfront for a wider range of
people by having Memorial Drive continue to be open. I
think it's thrilling.

night time traffic has caused a real problem, I have driven
there at night. It doesn't seem to be, again, it seems much
better than, than during some of the weekdays that I've
been along. So I, I hope that we can reaffirm our vote from
March and, and move forward.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So I have Councillor Carlone

and then Councillor McGovern. Actually, before we do that,
the Clerk will uh give us his opinion on whether this is
out of order or not.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Um, so I was just look at

in, I didn’t -- I don't have my copy of Robert's rules, so
I can't quote to Robert's rules directly. Um, but, uh, the
gist of the duplication is essentially that the language is
substantially the same, the words are substantially the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I, I -- unless there's evidence to suggest that the

same to something that the council has previously adopted.
And, again, from memory, my understanding is that it's to
prevent, uh, members of the body from resubmitting the
exact same item over and over.
139
Packet Pg. 1319

8

I think in Robert’s rules case, it's primarily in the
case where something is not adopted and the member would
like to see that adopted continuously, um, uh, submitted.

different from the language in, um, adopted in March. And
it's actually asking for, um, um, for a different, um, for
a different outcome in terms of the, the policy where in
March was the closure on two days, specifically Saturday
and Sunday.
And this is talking about limiting, I believe, it's
the Sunday uh the Sunday closures, Um and sort of to
editorialize, um, bodies can uh pass orders that change
their previous actions. Um, you know, as situations and
things change and policy, objective change throughout the
year and throughout the term. So I don't – be -- based on
my reading, I don't believe that this is a, is a duplicate
order.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

So I'm gonna continue the

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

140
Packet Pg. 1320

8

everyone and, un, I am a lover of public space. I've talked
about it many times. We have to greatly increase it and
access to it. But at the same time, if people can't get out

Um, I experienced something like that over a two-month
period, one time elsewhere. And, uh, if they feel that the
road is terribly backed up, we have to look at it and I
truly believe that our staff can do this and look at it and
make recommendations to lessen the impact. Um, do I want
Memorial Drive to be for more people? Of course. Do I hope
that car traffic reduces over time? Of course. But, um,
I'll say, what I said on Porter Square.
I think there's a way to do both in a fair way and we
have to ask the City to look at it and I believe my fellow
Councillor is going to propose something like that and, uh,
I think that's the way to do it. We don't have all the
details. I truly believe the people who spoke tonight on
both sides for that matter, but we need detailed

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor,

through you. So, um, you know, as folks know, I live in
this neighbourhood, um, my whole life. Um, you know, so I,
I really understand and appreciate the concerns that are

on Saturdays and Sundays to either go to my mother's or
take my daughter to soccer, I sit in that traffic.
Um, my Franklin Street is a -- my end of Franklin
Street is very much a cut-through for folks who want to
avoid the traffic on Putnam Ave. So I, I have folks racing
down my street and, and that as well. I don't get backed
up, coming -- getting out of my driveway like some do, but
I see it. So I, I do appreciate that and I, I think that's
real and I think the folks who have those concerns, it -it's a valid concern. It's, it’s, it’s a real concern for
them. It does impact, um, their activity and, and, and
their life and that's important.
With that said, I think that there are things that we
can do to try and alleviate up a lot of that and mitigate a

lot of that. Um, I mean, to be quite honest, that
intersection of Western and Putnam is a disaster seven days
a week. Um, at certainly at rush hour during Monday through
Friday, it's a disaster and there are things that we should

Packet Pg. 1322

8

do, not only because of Memorial Drive being closed on, on
weekends, but there are things that we need to do for that
intersection because it's just a really horrible

So, you know, with that said, I, you know, I voted to
support keeping Memo, you know, having Memorial Drives
closed on Saturdays, I think it is a great benefit. Um, you
know, I, I, I think it's a, it's a benefit to -- this
isn't, you know, a bike issue or a non-bike issue. It, it,
it's really about creating and reimagining open and
recreational space in, in, in our community and creating
the safe space.
Um, you know, I use it with my twins. Um, and, and I
think it is a, this is a both -- and it is a tremendous
resource and a good thing and it is an inconvenience to a
lot of the folks who live in the neighborhood. So, um, you
know, I, but I do think there's a way to make it better.
I don't think we should,, um I, I, I will not vote in

favor of Policy Order # 5 because I'd like to work on
making it better before we take any steps to, to say, we
should close on Saturday. I don't think we should. Um, But
we have to do something to help the folks that, that are
143
Packet Pg. 1323

8

having, you know, issues with, with, with the traffic.
So, um, you know, I, I, I do have a substitute. I, I
do wanna also be respectful to my colleagues, particularly

that neighborhood. Um, I would be willing to respect the
Charter Right and work with Councillor Simmons. Um, If that
is, uh, the way the council -- uh, if that is what she
would like to do, otherwise I would be prepared to offer a
substitute motion that would call on the City to work on
traffic calming measures in the neighbourhood, but not
close Memorial Drive on Saturday.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Chair.

Yes, Councillor Simmons. I do

have -- I'm gonna -- I'll let you go ahead, but there's a
few other hands up.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

I just want to respond

to Councillor McGovern. So I would be willing to, to take - I see that as a compromise because it is about working in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Simmons who, I know, cares very much about, um,

a spirit of co -- in cooperation. I do believe I heard, uh,
in the iteration by one of my colleagues that the order or
said that there would be a meeting in the community and
that clearly hasn't happened.
144
Packet Pg. 1324

8

So what I'm, I'm -- Councillor

Toner is gonna move

his Charter Right? Councillor McGovern, I certainly
support, um, a charter, right, or, or whatever the process

Councillor McGovern, maybe Councillor Toner would join me
in a Late Order saying that this should be a community
meeting because we will have this window of opportunity to
engage the community and the City Manager may or may not do
that if he is not directed to do so. And I think that would
be important.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So I, I have a few hands up.

Um, Councillor Zondervan had stated some -- a question
about the, uh, you know, the, um, whether this is double -duplicate or not, but he didn't address the substance. So
we haven't heard from him so I'll let him -- I'll allow,
allow him to comment before I go to Councillor Toner.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you, um, I do appreciate the concerns that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

would be to put this on hold. But I would hope that

were being raised and I, in fact, spoke with one of the
people who spoke in public comment and, and I agreed with
him that ideally we would be closing Mem Drive all the way
from McGrath to Mount Auburn.
145
Packet Pg. 1325

8

And, and also ideally, we would be shrinking it down
to one lane in each direction and I would love to see it
closed on Friday nights too. But this closures on the

back in February and it's gonna take some time for the
traffic to adjust for people to realize that Oh, it's also
closed on Saturday.
So, you know, don't drive through Cambridge or that
part of Cambridge during the day on Saturday. And some of
these traffic challenges will, will undoubtedly resolve. In
addition to that, I'm sure there are things we can do,
working with DCR and our Traffic Department to give people
more advanced notice that, that this is happening and to
help direct the traffic so that, uh, it's less of an impact
on, on the neighbors. But going back to not closing, um,
Memorial Drive to traffic on Saturday is not what the
majority of the community is asking us to do. And so I
would not support that step. Thank you, Madam Mayor
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

weekends is a compromise that we as a Council agreed to

Now, Councillor Toner.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Uh, thank you Madam Mayor.

I'd like to exercise my Charter Right at this point, uh,
with the hopes of being able to work with Councillor
146

8

Simmons and McGovern and anybody else that wants to be part
of the discussion to address the concerns of the Community.
AYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay, Councillor Toner has

Order #6.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Madam Mayor, Point Of

Order very quickly if I may?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

State your, um, Point Of

Order, Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

Councillor McGovern had

said he would support a Charter Right on his proposed
amendment. So I -- two things I need to know: one, because
there's no order to amend, does that make his substitution
moot? And if it does not, because that is not in front of
us, I can't move a Charter Right on it. So I need some
direction.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So Councillor Simmons, there

was -- Councillor McGovern alluded to an amendment per the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

exercised his Charter Right. So we'll move on to Policy

Clerk. It was not before us.
COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS: Right, ain’t in there.
So first and so it's not before us. So we've exercised a
Charter Right on the Policy Order that is in the books.
147
Packet Pg. 1327

8

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

It’s not before us so we’ve

exercised Charter Right on the Policy Order that is in the
books.
So my Point Of Order is

this: because that order is not -- it has, has the Charter
Right exercised, does it make an amendment to an order that
is under the charter, right moot?
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So –

Come, City Clerk.

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

No, technically there is

no -- there are no, um, amendments before the body. So when
this item comes back before the body at the next regular
meeting, which I believe is June 6th, amendments can be
made at that time.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Very good So it's moot.

Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

It's moot. So we'll move on to

Policy Order #6.Tthis is, uh, that the City Clerk, uh, send

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR E. DENISE SIMMONS:

this Policy Order with a letter of support from the City
Council or at a Massachusetts Public Bank. Councillor
Carlone, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

148
Packet Pg. 1328

8

Mayor. Um, many of you have seen a number of articles in
the Globe in the last few weeks, both about, uh, a public
bank, um, but also about, uh, the wealth gap throughout the

and my first term 2014/15, uh, we proposed the Public Bank.
In fact, had many of the same, whereases as is, uh, in
this a more up-to-date one. Um, this we have often talked
about that we need multiple ways to promote our progressive
nature to help people, to reduce the wealth gap, to get
more pre-K, to build more affordable housing, more open
space, everything we talk about. One of the things I
studied in grad school a long time ago was implementation
strategies and I became fascinated by it. And there are
many things I learned that we use still today.
Um, however, what really answers, uh, this question,
you’ve all heard, ‘form follows function’. That's a design
term about how you design modern buildings. Well, in
reality, ‘form follows funding’, um, that's what gets built

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

country. Um, and we've talked about this many times and,

and that's what this is about. It's about another way to
fund projects. Of all places, the North Dakota has had this
since, um, 1919 and they have done had, had tremendously
positive effects. It doesn't hurt local banks, you work
149
Packet Pg. 1329

8

with local banks.
Um, you'll hear all the things that's negative about
it and North Dakota is a approved – uh, proves that. And

Oakland, California, Santa Fe, Philadelphia, Manchester,
New Hampshire are looking into the format -- formation of a
public bank.
Now, as it turns out, in the State Legislature, there
are two bills moving forward. Senate # 665 led by Senator
Eldridge and in a bill at the house, # 1223 by
Representatives Connolly and Elugardo, um, and all this
does is, it says, “Please move forward with these bills
that this is a great opportunity and another vehicle, a
strong vehicle that can make change”.
Um, the Boston Foundation, I'm almost done, The Boston
Foundation noted every year that black entrepreneurs have a
need, an unmet need of $574 million dollars that they
cannot get loans through regular banks or regular sources.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

you will also see in this order that numerous cities,

So I hope you will unanimously support this and that all it
is doing is encouraging the state legislature to move
forward and discuss this in more detail.
Um, I can also tell you that Santa Fe has moved, going
150
Packet Pg. 1330

8

forward, and is doing an in -depth feasibility study
citywide for a public bank. Um, this is just the positive
all the way along. Thank you, Madam, Mayor.
Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui, through you, thank you, Councillor Carlone for
bringing this forward. I enthusiastically support it, would
love to be added this -- just to remind people and
reinforce what Councillor Carlone said for the folks
working on this. The Boston Globe recently endorsed this
concept in an editorial.
This is something that's been worked on for a long
time, particularly some of the things that this council has
talked about, which is, for instance, collaborative
ownership or limited equity co-ops or relatively unusual
forms of financing that traditional banks find it very
difficult to even understand how to do. That's the kind of
thing a public bank does. I worked in the area of worker

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

ownership for a long time trying to do union buyouts. And
it was something that if there was public financing and
public bank, it was much easier for us to save those jobs
from, from, -- in some of those situations.
151
Packet Pg. 1331

8

So I think that's the kind of thing we're talking
about. Again, not to -- it would not hurt, necessarily, the
existing organizations. This is something that the state

excited about for precisely the reason that is talked
about, which is there's just some forms of financing that
traditional funding sources are not doing it; it is not
doing it for entrepreneurs of color, it's not doing it for
women entrepreneurs, it's not doing it for certain kinds of
home ownership, for low and moderate income people
opportunities. So I, I hope that we can encourage not only
them to do it, but then I hope that the state legislature
takes this up and moves forward this really excellent idea.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Anyone else before we go ahead

and add Councillor Nolan on this? Hearing none. Well, I add
Councillor Nolan.

City Manager is requested to confer with all relevant City
departments to draft a report for a future Transportation
and Public Utilities Committee hearing on the impacts of

was followed by Councillor Azeem and Councillor Nolan and
Councillor Azeem, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. As

many of you may have heard the MBTA recently announced a
major Bus Network Redesign. Uh, it will be a very extensive
process. There will be six months of public feedback over
which they'll make changes and the full implementation will
take place between now and 2028. So we have a long road
ahead, but this is very exciting.
This is the first major redesign, uh, in a 100 years
really of all of the bus routes and exactly how they
function and where they go. Um, and I think it's a very
exciting process in particular. We were really worried
before the, uh, network redesign came out that bus service

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the M -- MBTA Bus Design --Redesign. Councillor Azeem. This

would be cut, that entire lines might be dropped. Instead,
overall in the system, we've seen an increase in 25% in bus
service and 70% in the -- over the weekend.
Um, in particular, in Cambridge, it looks like it will
154
Packet Pg. 1334

8

be very exciting where we'll get more than the average
city. We'll get 35% increase in bus service and we'll see a
lot of, uh, routes, high frequency routes increase. So

like the 66-1 bus and we'll go to 10.
Um, what's really interesting is in particular part of
my conversation with the MBTA is that, they were really
looking forward to rewarding communities that had made
physical infrastructure investments. And I think that I
really credit, you know, they haven't said this so this is
just my own opinion, uh, but really like some of our bus
lanes in particular, um, the major redesign, why we go from
5 to 10 high frequency bus routes is because they went from
making Harvard Square as our only bus terminal to Harvard
Square and Central Square being a second bus terminal.
Even in addition to all those things, another thing
that's very exciting is that we'll be getting four new bus
lines in Cambridge, three of which will be high frequency.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

we'll go from five high frequency routes, those are routes

High frequency, meaning that the buses will come more than,
uh, every 15 minutes, including on nights and weekends. Um,
and so this is really, really incredible. I'm very excited.
It'll lead to tens of thousands of more riders in Cambridge
155
Packet Pg. 1335

8

as has been estimated.
Um, even then this is a draft and I think that there's
room for improvement, uh, particularly as we get towards

Cambridge border in Somerville, Somerville is seeing, uh, a
much more significant cut in bus, uh, in -- infrastructure
than we are. And some of that has implications on bus
ridership and bus usage in Cambridge.
And so I think there's an opportunity to provide
feedback. And so I just wanted to both bring awareness to
the community that this is going on and then, uh, uh, work
on having a community process, where we can get feedback
and make sure that everyone in the community knows that
this is happening. And we can get as much feedback as we
can on how to improve these designs before they became, uh,
finalized.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

That was a lot of fast

talking, Councillor Azeem. We’re going to go to Councillor

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

our border with Somerville in East Cambridge and then North

Nolan [laughs] and Nolan and then Councillor Toner.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. As

Councillor Azeem noted, this is very exciting and then, as
he also noted at the end that there are also some concerns
156
Packet Pg. 1336

8

that have been raised about some of the lines, whether this
is unintentionally or when you actually dig into the
details, this will reduce service in certain areas of the

evident in, in the Policy Order which I was happy to cosponsor.
And also we recognized, which is why we're asking for
an analysis that there are also areas of the city which may
be less served. And it’s, as, as you look at some of the
plans on the surface, some of them look like, “Oh, this is
great. It increases service.” But then if you're cutting
other service, actually, the net may actually be not the
increase that we had looked for.
So I, I hope the full council passes this. I also want
to offer in line with what you just said, um, the amendment
to ensure to add the words in the last order and gather
community input. So it's not just the City departments that
we are doing, but to confer with all relevant City

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

city. So the excitement about them taking this on is

departments and gather community input to prepare an in depth analysis. Because I think sometimes the community
knows they're the ones using the buses and they know when
it is that those buses come.
157
Packet Pg. 1337

8

And I think some -- we've already gotten some emails
as a City Council, suggesting that some of the concerns as
Councillor Azeem said in Eastern Cambridge, there's some

forward and as we encourage the MBTA to continue their work
and increase service. We know that the way to reduce car
usage is to have public transit be frequent and affordable.
And we all hope that the MBTA, as they move this on and
improve the draft, that that will happen.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So Councillor Nolan has an

amendment that she made. The Clerk will get it on -- get it
up for us. You can come and give it to him, Councillor
Nolan.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

I have.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

You know what is

[inaudible 3:33:51]
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

Yeah, yeah, I have, thank

you.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

concerns in northern and in western. So as we put this

So while the Clerk does that, we'll go to Councillor
Toner.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Actually, Councillor Nolan beat me to the punch. Um, it's,
158
Packet Pg. 1338

8

uh, some community input process. Um, the emails as, uh,
Councillor Nol -- Nolan has mentioned, you all know, we've
received questions from folks about, uh, who knew and when

I actually didn't know anything about it until residents
started writing to me about it.
And you know, I think there's a real concern on the
part of some residents that the MBTA has already, you know,
made these decisions, sealed with these bus routes, uh,
without, without considering the impact on the communities,
uh, uh, affected. So I do hope that we can as a City, ou,
our staff can, uh, reach out to these communities, gather
their input and represent them at these meetings with the
MBTA.
I do think there's a little bit of suspicion among
some of the residents that our staff goes forward and says,
this sounds like a great idea, but doesn't actually voice
the concerns of the residents. That -- I don't believe

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

did we know it in terms of these proposed bus, uh, changes?

that's true, but I think we need to do a better job of
building the confidence of the residents that, that we are
representing their interests, uh, in these, these meetings
with the MBTA. Thank you, I yield.
159
Packet Pg. 1339

8

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We’re gonna go to Councillor

Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam.

think we are getting community input and we've seen in the
past that when we go back to the MBTA, they can and will
make adjustments. Um, so I hope that we do that in this
case because some of what they're proposing is really not,
um, conducive to, to our transit goals in the City.
But in addition to all of that, I think it's, again, a
reminder or a wakeup call to us that the MBTA is, you know,
they're trying to manage a regional transit infrastructure
that does not always align with our local goals here in
Cambridge. And at some point, we really to grapple with
that reality because we cannot get to where we want to go
if we keep relying on the MBTA. Unfortunately. Thank you,
Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any comments before I go back

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor, through you I, I certainly support the amendment. I

to Councillor Azeem -- Councillor Carlone?
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Just quick, just --

thank you, Madam Mayor, through you just quickly, uh,
having frequent bus service is fabulous. I lived in
160
Packet Pg. 1340

8

Manhattan in my youth and Madison Avenue is, you knew a bus
was coming every six minutes. So, but there was also, um,
uh, entry ways that you could get out of the rain while you

have that.
And I think part of the strategy should be
prioritizing on Northern Cambridge, for instance, on Mass
Avenue. In many cases, some of the buildings are set back;
there isn't a place for shelter. We have to look at that as
well and I'm sure that will be part of Councillor Azeem's
Committee work on this. I would also like to be added as a
co-sponsor.
This is very exciting, but the people that are losing
a bus line, it's challenging, but I could bring up the
kinds of things. I just did about the shelter and
integrating a system of bus arrivals, timing and just
obvious things. But we're an urban area, we should have an
urban system. Thank you Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

were waiting for a bus. Many of our locations, you don't

So we have, uh, two amendments

before us to -- the amendment that's right before us on our
screens: ‘‘To Add and Gathering Community Input’. And in
addition to, well, add Councillor Carlone to the order. I
161
Packet Pg. 1341

8

do have Councillor Azeem. Did you want to say something
else?
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Yes, I just, uh, had a

than excited to have Councillor Carlone on it, uh, on the
amendment. I think that this conversation will be a great
time to talk about bus shelters. Um, I will also say that
we're already planning a committee hearing in the fall to
talk about, uh, bus shelters and bus stop redesign. But
that will be from the City's perspective.
And so I think that it also makes sense to add it
here. And then, uh, just for the audience and the public
listening, um, just as it was brought up by Councillor
Toner, um, this network redesign is very, very new; it was
just brought up last week.
And so I don't think communities have even started
looking at it, much less, already holding committee
hearings and things like that. So this is my attempt to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 23, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

quick, uh, two comments. Um, one is, uh, I would be more

bring it out into awareness in the public and to start the
process, this will be, you know, six months of just
community hearing the feedback.
And so we are, um, you know, I think ahead of the
162

curve on this one and totally support all the amendments
and getting as much community feedback and input as we can.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Good evening, everyone. A

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States
of America, to the republic for which it stands, one nation
under God, indivisible, liberty, and justice for all.

the Massachusetts General Assembly and approved by the
Governor, the city is authorized to use remote
participation at meetings of the Cambridge City Council. In
addition to having members of the council participate
remotely, we've set up Zoom teleconference for public

for public comment.
To watch the meeting, please tune in to Channel 22 or
visit the Open Meeting Portal on the city's website. If
you'd like to provide public comment, please go to

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So with that, we'll move to,

go to public comment. We have right now about 25 speakers
for public comment. So pursuant to Rule 24 C-1(A), in the
event that there are 20 or more speakers signed up, the

permitted to allocate the remainder of their time to other
speakers. And just so folks know, we have our special

So we'll move, do a recess from the regular meeting to
go into our special meeting. And after which, for the
special meeting, we'll also hear public comment, uh, and
2

then conduct the meeting and then go back to our regular
meeting. So with that, I will go to Lauren Santucci,
followed by Christopher Cassa.

Lauren Santucci, address not provided, spoke on River
Bank Openings, she has lived across from one of the closed
sections of Memorial Drive for the last six years. She's
concerned about the new extended hours of Inman Park, which
is a wonderful asset to the community, but also a
significant inconvenience for those living in the affected
areas.
She suggests that the question is not just should the
park be open for one day or two days, but rather what
amount of inconvenience is appropriate to impose on a small
community of these residents for the recreational benefit
of the larger community. If we were to get rid of weekend
access to Riverbend Park, we would be overlooking the real
benefit it brings to so many of us in the community.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

PUBLIC COMMENT

She encourages us to find a middle path between
opening Riverbend Park for Saturday and Sunday during the
high-use summer months and reducing back to one day when
it's used less in the fall and almost not used at all in
3
Packet Pg. 1369

9

the early winter. She notes that hundreds of signatures
have been received to keep it open for both days, but the
number of US residents living in these impacted areas is

not know the impact on US residents.
Christopher Cassa, address not provided, a member of
the steering committee for the Memorial Drive Alliance,
expressed gratitude for the park's Saturday opening, but
acknowledged the need to find a middle ground that doesn't
negatively impact the comfort of nearby residents.
He suggested finding solutions to traffic bottlenecks
and moving traffic more efficiently, perhaps even starting
the park's opening time slightly later. Cassa also
mentioned that many major American cities use their
riverfronts at night and suggested finding ways to activate
the space at night to make it more useful. He referenced a
petition signed by 3,664 people who value the open space
and stressed the need to take both the petition and the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

smaller. They also note that those signing petitions may

concerns of impacted residents seriously. Cassa spoke with
respect and appreciation for the committee's time.
Sara Hendren, address not provided, spoke on Riverbend
openings. She's a resident of Cambridge and spoke in

The Riverbend Park allows for slow movements, which
is essential for young children learning to ride bicycles
and older adults using walkers or wheelchairs. Sarah
emphasized the importance of cities making room for
slowness and flexibility, especially on weekends when the
city does not need to work like an efficient machine. She
invited the council to come and watch her son Graham, who
has Down Syndrome, riding a tandem bike with two wheels
behind her husband, an activity that is far too big for
regular sidewalks but perfect for the Riverbend Park. Sarah

The current ordinance has provisions to deal with lack

waived. For contracts under $10,000, the current
requirements do not apply, and some of the proposed changes
are reasonable. However, at least one clause would weaken
the law compared to Somerville's equivalent law, making it
harder to enforce contracts.
Somerville has had this law for five years and is
doing well. Passing the amendments in a single meeting
without detailed discussion is not recommended. It is
better to have an extended discussion to understand the
changes and figure out which ones make sense and how the
city can deal better with these issues. He suggested
forming a committee or having a more extended discussion to
learn more about the details.

She suggested that the report should be rejected until
it contains real detailed information that would allow the
community to evaluate and respond to the progress and
implementation of the cycling safety ordinance. Osgood
emphasized that the council should give the community of
Cambridge more than words and policy orders and that the

PUBLIC COMMENT
Clive Lawrence, address not provided, proposed opening
Memorial Drive to pedestrians all weekend to promote safety
and public health, in line with Cambridge City Council's
goals of safe and sustainable transportation and increased
access to open spaces. Memorial Drive's design encourages
speeding and has resulted in over 400 crashes, including 2
fatalities since 2000.
The solution to improve transportation safety is to
end car dependency and make recreational spaces like
Memorial Drive and Riverbend Park accessible to cyclists,
joggers, and roller bladers. However, there are concerns

about traffic on streets like Putnam Avenue and the lack of

congratulations to the council and search committee for
selecting Yi-An Huang as the city manager candidate. He
found that Huang addressed many of the issues he cares
about in the city and had the experience of having worked
in an executive high level in a large organization.
Huang's approach to transparency and how it should be
handled in the city was inspiring. He is appreciative of
Huang's approach to housing, which is not just an issue of
zoning or dollars, but of people and solving for their
needs. He is also looking for someone who can bring
professional managerial experience to the city, as well as
the ability to have more visibility into how the city is
doing and how it's evaluating itself. Finally, he wishes
Huang luck and thanks him.

housing crisis and give an answer on how to help the
unhoused population.
He showed himself to be a clear communicator and a
quick study of the city's urgent issues. He also has
experience transforming organizations and would help

He believes that Cheryl is the best candidate for the
position, given her extensive experience in municipal law
as the city solicitor for the city of Chelsea for the past
20 years and her experience working in Cambridge's legal
department. He emphasizes that municipal law is unlike any
other area and that Cheryl has made executive decisions and
has experience managing a large staff.
Doucette also notes that Cheryl has handled adversity
in all challenges, including multiple city charter changes.
He highlights the fact that the city has never hired a
woman or a black person for this position. Doucette
believes that Cheryl has the qualifications to handle the
issues faced by the city and run it in a way that benefits
all citizens, especially those who are being gentrified and

However, Meyer also acknowledges Fisher's appeal due
to her experience, community connections, and no-nonsense
attitude. Meyer is confused about why some individuals
fighting for neighborhoods and smart building are in favor
of Fisher, despite her stance on certain issues.
Nonetheless, Meyer appreciates Fisher's desire to eliminate
conflict of interest with her business partner and hopes
that all candidates consider the unintended consequences of
their decisions. Meyer wishes the candidates good luck in
their deliberations.

He reviewed the applications and interviews of

However, he found that Khumalo lacked attention to
specifics of Cambridge and became more focused on Huang,
who demonstrated a collaborative leadership style, planned
and implemented institutional changes, and met the needs of
low-income and unhoused people at BMC. Huang's planning

address the needs of black and brown communities. He
believes that choosing one of these two qualified
candidates is critical to positively impact the black and
brown community, not just with policies but also by
retaining actual residents in Cambridge.
Marie Elena Saccoccio, address not provided, spoke
briefly to express her support for two candidates for a

Iram Farooq for showing well in the process. He believed
that the council would not choose someone who has worked
there already, but he thought Cheryl was clearly the choice
for now, as she had all the necessary experience to run the
city.
He believes that when considering leadership, three
things must be taken into account: courage, character, and
capability, and they believe that Cheryl Watson embodies
all of these qualities and is the most prepared candidate
for running the city due to her municipal experience.
He also criticizes the flawed process of the selection

and vouches for her character, ambition, and fairness.
Watson is a woman of color who left Cambridge to pursue her
goals but came back to her roots.
She believes Watson is overqualified for the position
and can bring results for all residents of Cambridge,
particularly in areas such as affordable housing, social
services, climate change, early childhood education, and
equality. She provides examples that other candidates did
not provide and believes that Watson knows a little bit of

During the event, Sanchez expressed her concern that one of
the other candidates had referred to themselves as

of underprivileged individuals in the city.
Sanchez, who has lived in Cambridge her entire life,
worked for the transportation department for over 30 years,
and is a homeowner, believes Fisher is highly qualified to
run the city as she has a deep understanding of the needs
of the community. Sanchez was impressed with Fisher's
presentation at the event and praised her poise, knowledge,
and vision for the changes needed in Cambridge, including
addressing the unique needs of seniors. Sanchez concluded

meeting about the hiring of the city manager, expressing
his support for candidate Cheryl Watson Fisher. He
38

highlighted the importance of selecting the right city
manager and felt comfortable with the selection committee.
As a representative of the Cambridge branch of the NAACP,
he encouraged the council to choose Fisher, whom he felt

was the most qualified candidate due to her 20 years of
experience as a city solicitor in Chelsea.
Reeves emphasized the importance of qualifications,
particularly for African Americans, and felt that Fisher
had been near the "flame" for many years, making her a
strong candidate. He also noted that Fisher was from
Cambridge and had graduated from Cambridge Rindge and
Latin, and encouraged the council to consider having
someone who excelled from the city lead it forward. Reeves
also referenced a scholarship program honoring Cambridge's
best and brightest and expressed a desire for these
individuals to return to Cambridge and be part of the
city's leadership.
Jalen Bernard, address not provided, spoke in support

working in the cities of Cambridge and Chelsea, dealing
with issues such as housing, gentrification, gun safety,

importance of equity and racial justice in the hiring of a
new city manager for Cambridge. She expressed concerns
about the history of displacement and gentrification in
Cambridge and suggested that the city needs a manager who
is not associated with such practices or with real estate
developers and commercial interests that have contributed
to these issues.
Wortis shared that she has spent nearly 25 years
organizing workshops for parents, teachers, and caregivers
in Cambridge that prioritize the experiences and voices of
multi-racial and multi-ethnic families. She also mentioned
that anti-racist curriculum has been introduced and
celebrated in the public schools in Cambridge.

He believes there is now a consensus that commercial
development has been excessive and that the new city
manager should prioritize other areas. Williamson also
noted that the needs of ordinary citizens in the city have
historically been ignored, such as when the DCR pool in
North Cambridge was closed before Labor Day weekend. He
hopes the next city manager will pay more attention to the
needs of ordinary citizens who may not have access to
insider information.
Nicola Williams, Abbey Street, expressed her gratitude
towards the committee and the city council for their

she acknowledged the challenges of navigating housing and
education as middle-income residents.
She spoke in support of Mr. Yi-An Huang for the city
manager position, highlighting his personal experience as a
homeowner and parent of public school kids, which gives him
a unique perspective to understand the consequences of any

Mike Nakagawa, 51 Madison Avenue North Cambridge,

perspective on how things could be done.
He noted that the process seemed rushed, with the
public meeting the candidates for the first time less than
a week ago and now having a vote on such an important
decision. Residents have not had a chance to discuss the
options amongst themselves and convey their resulting
decisions. Mike acknowledged that the candidates are highly
qualified but bring different strengths, and he believes
more time is needed to figure that out.
He suggested having an interim city manager if needed

She also stresses the need for a candidate who will
look at how the city's finances are structured to address

city's two primary concerns, the AAA bond rating and low
residential property tax rates. She believes that the
city's focus on commercial development raises land values
and creates a housing crunch. She encourages the council to
tackle this issue.
Justin Saif, Hurley Street, East Cambridge, spoke in

that this work did not start just this term. It started
last summer, uh, with Councillor Simmons, who had led us

acknowledge Councillor Simmons work on that.
I also want to thank the current chair of the
Government Office Committee, Vice Mayor Mallon for her work
this term, getting us to this point, helping us getting us

that each councillor, as their name is called, will
50
Packet Pg. 1416

9

indicate their choice for the selection of a candidate.
A councillor may be recorded as present. After every
counselor has voted and stated who they'd like for be the
next city manager, the Clerk will announce the results and

ask for any corrections or changes. After all corrections
and changes have been recorded, the chair, the-- the Clerk
will-- will declare the results of the vote. If any
candidate has received five or more votes, they will have
been, uh, appointed and offered, uh, the contract for the
office of city manager.
If none of the candidate receive-- of the candidates
received five votes, the council will go to another round
of votes, uh, to-- and follow the same procedure. And the

changing of a vote before all councillors have voted. So
this is the procedure that I spoke to the city solicitor

The second item was-- is the-- at the seventh point?
No, the fourth point is then we would be called on one by

option is to, uh, go member, uh, by each, by each
applicant. And-- and that's another way, so that each
person is on the record on how they, uh, proceed the

could do it. So I want to hear from my colleagues that
that's, uh, a way that we could do it. 'Cause I guess my

to comment. You are welcome to comment upon the merits of

And then ultimately, I think the goal is to-- for you
to say which one-- which candidate you would like to offer
the position to. So the plan was to go through each
councillor to do that. And then I described kind of the-the procedure of the vote process that I suggested we vote
upon. And you can ask-- I mean, clerk, if you want to say
more, you're welcome to on how, you know, you-- we
suggested that this be the procedure.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

the time when the Chair's determined that either, um, you
know, everything that has been said has been said, at least

in that-- for that ballot, then you-- the body would move
on to the vote. The vote would consist of going through

last. And each-- and each member of the body would state
the name of the individual that they would like to appoint
to the office of city manager. And at the end of those
declarations, there'll be an opportunity for corrections
and changes. Once that has, uh, concluded the numbers of-for each candidate will be tallied and the vote will be
announced.
If a, um, candidate has five votes, then there'll be
no need for further balloting and that person will be
offered the position. If no candidate reaches that
majority, then there will be another round of battling,
which could include additional debate.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

I did think of another

way that we could have done it looking at each candidate,
'cause there were four, but I'll see how the vote falls out
and if-- if that's-- if it doesn't go in with the majority,
54

then I would suggest the other measure.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Ma'am

wouldn't be a motion, right? We're-- we're just gonna do
debate and then we'll go to the vote.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. And this

is also just for my understanding, this is the same process
that we use when we vote for the mayor?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And the vice mayor. Yes.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Great, thank you.

Any additional comments before

we go to move to vote this procedure? Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Does anyone want to

speak before I speak again? If no one-MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I didn't see any other hands.

No, I didn't see any other hands.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. Through you, um, I believe you said there-- there

I just wanted-- just

for our edification. Uh, the last time we had this vote, we
only had two candidates and so this is a little bit
different. That's why I offer us to look at it in a
56
Packet Pg. 1422

9

different way. Maybe some of us didn't remember that, but
I'm more glad-- more than glad to edify you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor Simmons.

I think we should go ahead, uh, vote on the procedure
whereby each councillor, as their name is called, uh, will
indicate their choice for the selection of a candidate. And
we can do-- I think we should do a roll call on that.
City Clerk Anthony Wilson called the roll:
On adopting the procedure as outlined by the Mayor:
Councillor Burhan Azeem – Yes
Councillor Dennis J. Carlone – Yes
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon - Yes
Councillor Marc C. McGovern - Yes
Councillor Patricia M. Nolan – Yes
Councillor Denise E. Simmons - Abstain
Councillor Paul F. Toner – Yes
Councillor Quinton Zondervan – Yes

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Anyone else? Just checking further. I don't hear anyone. So

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui - Yes
Yes-9, Abstain-1. Motion Passes.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So the procedure out of the

way, uh, if a majority are more, uh, councillors vote to
57
Packet Pg. 1423

9

offer the position of city manager to a candidate, the city
council will move into an executive session for purposes of
conducting a strategy session in preparation for

manager's position.
So after this, once we come to a conclusion, if we
come to a conclusion, the next step we can take is to move
into an executive session before entering into the
executive session, depending upon who the successful
candidate is for the city manager position, the council may
also discuss in open session whether to appoint an acting
city manager and if so, whether to conduct a strategy
session in preparation for negotiations with non-union
personnel relative to the acting city manager's pos-position in executive session.
So that doesn't have to-- have to-- have to happen
tonight, but really, it's the pleasure of the city council
if you'd like to do that. Does that make sense to anyone?

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

negotiations with non-union personnel relative to the city

Does anyone have questions for the clerk or the city
solicitor at this point? Sorry Peter, we can't get to your
question. Okay. I don't see any further questions.
So at this point, this will be the opportunity where
58
Packet Pg. 1424

9

by each councillor can comment upon the candidacy of our
four finalists. Uh, feel free to describe your deliberative
process and to comment, uh, upon any or all or one of the

state which candidate you would wish to offer a-- employ-employment contract. So we will start with Councillor
Azeem.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um,

I wanted to say how exciting it is to be here tonight. Um,
you know, one of the most important decisions we make as a
city council is the selection of the new manager. And it's
been, uh, so incredible watching this process unfold,
watching, uh, people chime in to make the profile of what
the job applica-- uh, uh, uh, job profile will look like.
Uh, watching the steps come in as we chose a selection
committee and all the individuals that applied and how
difficult that was as we had 100, uh, over 100 people apply
for a few spots. And then, uh, from that, seeing the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

candidates, uh, and provide any relevant information as you

candidates that emerge, um, it's been a very exciting
process.
Um, and, uh, I'm glad to be here today where I've been
struggling to make this decision. Um, you know, uh, I've
59
Packet Pg. 1425

9

had a lot of conversations over the last couple-- couple of
days. Um, we've gotten hundreds of emails. I had 46 calls
on Friday, 19 on Saturday, 26 on Sunday, and a whole lot

tough choice. We have a lot of great candidates.
Um, I know that's a good place to be, though. I do
place some of the blame on the Vice Mayor for being a
little bit too good at her job in running this process. Um,
but, uh, it is an exciting place to be. Um, and so I just
wanted to share my thoughts on the candidate and, um, how I
came to the decision I did today. Um, there were really
three candidates that I was really, uh, deeply deciding
between.
The first was, uh, Ms. Iram Farooq, uh, who's
currently Assistant City Manager and head of, uh, CDD. Um,
I-- I really love talking to her and how she's an expert in
city politics. She understands how the city runs, the
different dimensions of it, um, has a fundamental

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

more conversations today as well. Um, and it's a really

understanding of the policy de-- details and the different
ways that we could do things. And she could start on day 1
in a way that I don't think any other candidate can, just
knowing the city so well.
60
Packet Pg. 1426

9

Um, and it's been incredible watching her, um, as
she's, you know, worked so long in city government and
seeing her climb the ranks and get to where she is and now

encourage people to work in city government and get to a
place where they can get promoted to the top position, um,
that really encourages people to make a career out of this
and to stay with it.
Um, and you know, it's a nice point. It's like, uh,
you know, uh, the way that she talks about her story about
being an immigrant and, uh, smaller, it really speaks to a
lot of my heart. And, um, I-- I-- I think she's a
phenomenally strong candidate. Um, there's also Ms., uh,
Cheryl Watson Fisher. Um, you know, when I first met her, I
was just shocked by how incredibly empath-- empathetic she
was. Uh, you get a sense of warmth from her and the way
that she tells stories and can operate in all rooms
regardless of class and race.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

potentially be our City Manager. I think that we should all

Um, and thinking about all the work that she's done in
Chelsea, which is, uh, uh, you know, a city that's not as
blessed with as many resources as we have. And hearing
stories about how when like ICE came into Chelsea, how she
61
Packet Pg. 1427

9

defended her residents against them, and how well she
handled COVID, um, alongside her city manager.
Um, hearing from the community in the last couple of

going through CLS, living in a poor, growing up in
affordable housing, and how that's shaped her experiences.
And, you know, uh, to me, like, you know, a big part of why
I'm here today is because growing up poor and with housing
insecurity, I think it puts a fire in you in terms of like
how seriously you take these issues. And there's no, uh,
there's an urgency that comes with that that I see in, uh,
Ms. Watson Fisher.
And then finally we have, uh, Mr. Yi-An, um, who does
not have an experience in city government. And I was
worried at first about how much he would know, and I was
overly impressed every single time he had done an
incredible amount of research. He could cite all the air,
uh, air wife plans had gone by decades and decades. Um, and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

days around the connections she's had growing up here,

he was incredibly empathetic seeing him, uh, speak in, uh,
in front of city staff. Um, and he, in my sense, really got
it on issues of housing and transit.
Um, but there was a little extra with him. Um, for me,
62
Packet Pg. 1428

9

you know, uh, I think a lot about my life and how I was
born in Pakistan and my parents, uh, would make, uh, much
less money in their entire lives combined than I make in a

won the visa lottery, and that was a golden ticket, um,
that got us to the US and I was really dedicated to service
and giving back.
And that was really, really important to me. One of
the first things I did when I got to Cambridge was sign up
to be an EMT. Um, and one of the things I was really
shocked by when I became an EMT was that we have all of
these amazing hospitals in Boston. Um, we have level one
trauma centers like MGAs and Tufts, like the real
innovative research comes out of here. Um, but their
populations don't really look like the populations of the
city that we have.
Um, a lot of them are very, you know, uh, wealthy
privileged individuals who go to these hospitals because

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

year now. And, um, I got really lucky in that my parents

they serve the local-- local population, but also people
from all over the world. That's not true of BMC. Um, BMC
has a population that's 70% minority and 93% minority among
kids. They're a safety enough hospital that no one wants to
63
Packet Pg. 1429

9

go to when they talk about hospital administration.
Um, you know, we've gone through a series of hospital
mergers in the area, uh, where hospitals have been trying

but BMC has stayed independent. And I-- I don't think
that's because, um, they wouldn't benefit from the merger,
but it's because no one wants to take on that type of
challenging population and what it really means to them.
Uh, no one who has options has BMC at their first choice if
they're looking to maximize wealth and prestige.
It-- BMC makes a lot of hard choices and serves as a
safety net for so many residents and to come at, uh, to BMC
at the time he did when, uh, you had to make critical
decisions about budget cuts because they were really
struggling, meant that you had to make a lot of tough
decisions about whether you were going to fund, you know,
COVID care in the emergency room or pediatrics.
And those are really tough life or death decisions

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

to form larger and larger coalitions to get more profit,

that have really, really big implications. And the result
of failure is that you have a hospital with a huge deficit
that can't fund, uh, the critical po-- uh, just supports a
critical population that it has. Um, you know, um, and I
64
Packet Pg. 1430

9

really see that in him. Um, you know, uh, I think a lot
about how, um, you know, uh, uh, the conversations I've had
with members of the East Asian community and how it's the

representation they see and the fact that there's no one in
city hall and so Asian come in, nor in city government, and
how much that matters to them. But most of all, it's the
little things.
It's really easy to be nice when you're talking about
a city, is really easy or sometimes not that easy, uh, to
allow change in your neighborhood and to make difficult
decisions. It's much harder when it's in your home. I think
about how after last year when, um, you know, we pulled out
from Afghanistan and there was a lot of people who needed
support, there were three kids who ended up on an Army
base, and he decided to take them into his home and keep
them there and support them through CLS. And that is the
type of generosity that I see in him.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

largest growing minority population in the city, and the

You know, I see someone who has executive experience
and has a lot of the mathematical and engineering or
mathematical and technical knowledge to really do the job,
but I also see someone who, at the end of the day, I think
65
Packet Pg. 1431

9

is a very decent person. And I think that matters a lot to
me. Um, so all three candidates that I listed today are
phenomenal. I would be so happy with any of them as city

we can't. And so, uh, today I will be supporting Yi-An
Huang for city manager. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So Councillors, um, don't feel

the need to say, uh, as much as Councillor Azeem said. We
do have a business meeting after this. So, um, but thank
you Councillor Azeem. Uh, but really, um, I'll leave it to
you on how you much you want to speak, but don't feel the
need you have to speak about everyone. We'll go to-COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Yes, Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you. I prepared a

40-page brief that I'd like to, um, actually, I thought the
information shared was very useful by Councillor Azeem, but
I'll be much briefer. I, um, believe all four people should

manager. Um, and I wish I could hire all of them, but, uh,

have been in the final, um, review package. And, uh, I was
part of the interim committee. Uh, so I was fortunate with
my colleagues to be at every level. And I have to say the
interim committee that, uh, took it from approximately 30
66
Packet Pg. 1432

9

down to 10, and then five was an excellent committee chosen
by other members of the council.
It was very well balanced, very diverse in opinion.

without exception, all worthy people. And I believe the
Final five one person dropped out, um, unfortunately, but,
um, I felt that they were all top and meeting each of them,
I was impressed for different reasons by every one of-every one of them.
Uh, to get to the point, there are two people that I
feel are at the top. One I've known a very long time and
another one that I've only recently met. Uh, Iram Farooq is
someone I've known over 20 years. Although we didn't work
directly together, I knew her when I was a consultant to
community development. And I saw the inner workings of the
city, which, uh, eventually led me to run for council. But,
um, I found she had enormous energy and enthusiasm and
optimism, um, and the way I encouraged her to stay, uh, on

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And I have to admit that the 10 that were chosen were

course.
And, um, and when she became the deputy for community
development, uh, I encouraged her there. And then, as we
all know, she became the head, very difficult job
67
Packet Pg. 1433

9

answerable to the manager. Um, in my years, I have felt-I've had 30 years as a consultant to community development.
And each of those years I served under five different heads

the manager pretty much ran the big decisions of community
development.
That's not a criticism, that's just the way it is.
Uh, I think Iram could do an excellent job. At the same
time Yi-An Huang, um, has greatly impressed me. I'm aware
that about 60% of all the emails we've received are, uh,
mention him as the most desirable person. Um, I see them at
two different ends of capabilities, both at the highest
level and both could do the job. And that's where I am now
in the middle of that quandary. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Vice Mayor

Mallon.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. Um, to my colleagues, uh, this has been quite

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

of community development and every one of them knew that

a process. I want to thank everybody that has been
involved. My council, colleagues, every member of the
community who came forward to be part of a focus group, or
provide feedback or email or call us.
68
Packet Pg. 1434

9

It has been an incredibly engaged, uh, community
process, uh, as only Cambridge can do. And I think it
really brought us to a place where we had a leadership

screening committee and looking for which candidates they
should be bringing forward as finalists. Um, but I think
it-- it helps guide us tonight as we make this decision and
has helped guide me for the past, uh, several weeks, um, as
we have looked at all of these finalists, who are, I think,
um, truly incredible, all four of them. So different.
That's the one thing that I've heard, oh, in the
community this week, is that, wow, these are all great
candidates and they're all so different. So good luck, So,
um, it has been a challenging decision for me. I want to
thank all four candidates for coming forward, for throwing
their hat in the ring, and for really, um, spending so much
time with the Cambridge community, researching what we do
here, what we need here, um, and bringing that best energy

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

profile that really can direct-- both directed the initial

to the-- the meet the finalist night to the city council
interview to, um, the employee interview, which I found
really, really fascinating.
So as somebody that probably, maybe one of the only
69
Packet Pg. 1435

9

people here that listened to all 30 hours of the focus
groups that, um, came forward, I personally responded to
every single comment on our co-urbanized feedback website.

was me. Um, and I-- I really-- I took all of those things
to heart, and especially when we put together those
leadership profiles.
So, Norman Khumalo, um, really impressed me with his
style, his grace, his humility, his knowledge. Um, he's
clearly an incredible leader in Hopkinton, um, and I
learned a lot from him, um, in our time together. Um, so I
want to say thank you to Norman for coming forward and-and applying for this position.
Uh, Cheryl Watson Fisher was an-- just a pleasure to
get to know. I-- I had heard of her and our community,
certainly, I know that she has a lot practice here. Um, but
it was just wonderful to get to know her as a person. Um,
her warmth, her grace, her talent, uh, for seeing problems

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So if you got a comment from the City of Cambridge, that

in the Chelsea community, identifying them and-- and really
working to-- to solve them, and wanting to bring that same
energy here in Cambridge.
Um, I would say that the-- the two that, um, the two
70
Packet Pg. 1436

9

candidates that I most struggled with, uh, in making this
decision were, uh, Iram Farooq and Yi-An Huang. Uh, both
are incredibly impressive. And I-- I think that Burhan

you take my notes? Because I think you said all of the
things that I wanted to say about both candidates. Um, so I
won't repeat them.
But, um, Ms. Farooq is incredibly talented, and I have
worked with her for such a long time, and I'm-- I'm
grateful to her for-- for coming forward and putting her
na-- name in. This is a very difficult public process, and
I-- I am grateful for her-- for her, um, leadership at CDD.
Uh, and it truly was a very difficult decision. But I
think, you know, when I look at this leadership profile and
who is our ideal candidate for me, Yi-An Huang meets every
single bullet point here, um, both professionally and
personally.
Um, I was impressed, I was blown away by his answers

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Azeem might-- I don't know if you-- Councillor Azeem, did

on his candidate questionnaire. I wanted to know more about
this person. Um, and he didn't fail, uh, both at the meet
the finalist night, um, and the city council interview. But
most-- most importantly for me, it was the employee
71
Packet Pg. 1437

9

interview that really-- he really showed, um, where he
would shine. Um, but I have to say, doing, you know, we-we got references from the-- the-- the search consultants,

Like we've reached deep into our community and our
people-- to reach out to people that may have worked with,
um, these candidates, may know them personally. And there's
not a person that I reached out who wasn't completely
impressed by Yi-An Huang and what he could bring to the
City of Cambridge.
Um, so I will say that the-- the neighbor tonight who
came forward to say that, um, he drives her to market
basket each and every week so that she can do her grocery
shopping was, um, for me, just the culmination of
everything that I heard about him and his family, his
humility, his warmth, his grace, his intelligence. Um, I'm- I'm very happy to be supporting Yi-An Huang for city
manager tonight. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

but I'm sure everyone has done their own recon, right?

We will go to council

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, ma-- Excuse

me. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I do also want to start by
thanking everybody who-- the Vice Mayor, Ms. Stephan, uh,
72
Packet Pg. 1438

9

the-- the screening committee, um, all the folks who sent
us their thoughts. Um, and mostly I want to thank the four
finalists who stepped forward and as stressful as this two

they're going through. And I just really do appreciate
their willingness to, um, to step forward. And-- and I
think as others have said, um, I think we have four really
strong candidates.
We have four candidates that are experienced, that,
um, they're-- they're well educated, they're passionate,
and they're good people, right? They're really good people.
And, um, I really appreciate those who-- in the community
who commented and sent us emails expressing why they
supported the person that they did and-- and not so much
about why someone was bad or not-- or not capable.
These are four really good human beings that deserve
our respect, um, no matter how we vote. And so, you know,
as I thought about this, and-- and this was not an easy

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

weeks or so has been for us, I can't even imagine what

decision, you know, for me. I didn't come to my decision
lately. Um, you know, I thought about two words that I-- I- I heard a lot was experience and transformational, and
what do those words mean, and how do people look at those?
73
Packet Pg. 1439

9

And they can mean different, you know, different things.
There's educational experience, professional experience,
um, uh, uh, just, uh, management experience.

someone who's totally from the outside, who has a fresh
look, who's gonna come in and sort of transform things. And
transformational can-- can also mean, um, you know, can
also come from people from within. But one of the things
that we, um, that we don't talk about as much, and-- and
this is something that I didn't even-- it wasn't even on
the top of my list, and I had to kind of, as I was
processing, is, uh, personal or lived experience, um, and
how important that is.
Um, you know, I think of my work as a social worker
where, you know, I'm well educated, I got the highest
license, I'm committed, all of those things. But when I
work with someone who is unhoused, or I work with someone
who is in public housing, or I work with someone who

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, and then transformational can certainly mean

doesn't have the privileges that I have, no matter how
educated I am, experienced, I am good at my job as I am, I
don't fully get their experience 'cause I haven't walked in
those shoes. And to me, that's really something important.
74
Packet Pg. 1440

9

We talk all the time about how, you know, we don't
hear, you know, when we talk about affordable housing, the
people who live in affordable housing are never at the

uh, having, uh, Cheryl Watson Fisher who grew up in public
housing, be at the head of that table, right? And say to
the people who we're talking about and say, we never hear
from, hey, I got it.
I know what it's like, I know what it did for me. Come
to the table. How incredibly powerful would that be? Income
insecurity, right? We can-- we can be educated about it.
It's not an academic exercise to Cheryl. Um, you know,
climate justice or injustice. Um, growing up in a name we
think there are no trees in the port. Now looking at it 40
years ago, you know, it was a concrete island.
She understands what climate injustice is. Um, and-and the same with racial justice, right? And so, again,
four really talented, well-qualified, well experienced

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

table. How transformational would it be in someone like,

candidates, but the one to me who has all of that other
stuff and a personal, uh, in her core of who she is
understanding of the very people that we say are constantly
underrepresented, is Ms. Watson Fisher. And that's what did
75
Packet Pg. 1441

9

it for me. Um, you know, beyond the fact, look, she is a
good manager.
There were questions about her being a manager. She

majority, minority, majority non-English speaking and very
poor, didn't have the resources we had here and yet she was
able to manage all those supply chain issues, all those
state grant issues, and get PPE and tests in the hands of
people who weren't as easy to get those services to as they
are here in Cambridge. She did that.
Um, she understands municipal law, which is huge,
right? Um, and she-- she understands, you know, again, what
it's like to grow up struggling and overcoming those
hurdles to get to the place where she is today. So I think
she combines all of that. Um, again, I think there's four
really strong candidates, but I will be voting for Ms.
Watson Fisher, um, because of her lived experience, because
I want to elevate, you know, we talk about representation

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

managed the whole COVID response in a community that is

matters. Well, what better representation than someone who
grew up in affordable housing and-- and, you know,
understands those issues in a real personal way.
So I'll be voting for her, um, based on that. It's
76
Packet Pg. 1442

9

not just her lived experience, but it's her lived
experience combined with all of her academic, educational,
and pro, uh, management and professional experience. Thank

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Through you. We are all, I think, united in what
has been said about the difficult choice in front of us
because of the nature of the candidates. Uh, I want to
start, um, obviously with the process while it was
compressed, it was so ally led by Vice Mayor Mallon and our
search consultant.
And I want to thank not only the finalists, but the
close to 30 applicants from across the country who spent
time applying, writing a really extensive questionnaire
that the search committee that I was honored to be on,
poured over in detail in order to, uh, decide who would
interview in front-- out of that process came the four

finalists before us tonight.
They emerged with a range of experience, which is
impressive, and we should, as has been said, be really
happy and frankly honored that we have such excellent
77
Packet Pg. 1443

9

choices. And the choice is difficult, not only 'cause
they're excellent, but they have very different strengths.
And the four candidates each impressed me in different

I will, uh, go right to the, um, to the conclusion,
which is after reading, researching, talking, reaching out
to people, I will be voting for Yi-An Huang for our next
city manager. I believe he is a candidate who will bring a
fresh perspective to bring progressive change. He has a
demonstrated ability to get things done and to do things
urgently and importantly, to bring people together. His
children attend CPS for which I have a-- a real sweet
fondness and that will give him a connection to the
community. And I'm not sure of that specific connection the
council has ever had, actually in a city manager.
He has lived in Cambridge for more than 15 years as a
renter and homeowner. And of those in the community who
weighed in, I reached out to some many, had never emailed

the council before, which said there's really grassroots
support from families, whether it's where his kids go to
school, people who worked with him at Boston Medical
Center, or people who heard his thoughtful answers at the
78

forums. His strong communication skills are something we
have all noted as needed.
His leadership in healthcare during COVID, which

experienced doing things in a timely way. I was blown away
with his anecdote, which was confirmed by me reaching out
to some people in the medical field that he did help Boston
Medical Center take a three-year plan for telehealth that
had been in the works and implemented in 14 days because of
COVID, which was frankly amazing.
His experience outside business administration could
be an asset because as been said, he will ask new questions
and we also have really strong leaders in the city and they
will be a great team. Experience managing complex budgets,
to me is a really huge asset. He talked about the budget,
our bond rating in the place of the budget and council
goals in a way that demonstrated solid understanding of
finances, which the leadership profile focused on and

required, and was a large part of our hope for this miracle

people.
He knows how to manage including difficult people like
all of us. And he does not have a specific agenda for the
role other than working to meet the goals of the city. And
as been mentioned, he did his homework, which showed it's a
good sign 'cause this job is really hard and requires a lot
of work. His understanding of the issues facing us was
impressive.
So his track record also shows he knows how to get
things done and he knows how to deal with very challenging
issues, including identifying tradeoffs and making
decisions in a timely manner. It also came through that
he's generous and kind and empathetic. As, uh, Councillor
Azeem noted, the story about him housing three Afghan

refugees was what was really interesting about that.
It was not disclosed in any writing, in any
interviews. It came to us through the community. It was not
something he would've thought to bring forward, and it

about his humility in listening and learning. So from the
beginning I stated we need a leader and a manager. Our

We have four candidates all qualified for the job
with an impressive range of skills and experience and lived
experience. After all the intensity of the last few months,
in my considered opinion, the best person to lead this
incredible city into the future is Yi-An Huang.

I also want to talk a little bit about the community
process and say a very special thank you to the community
that I represent and the community of the port neighborhood
in particular, who have come out to say there's someone
that we think very highly of and we want you to know that.
And I, in terms of my deliberation, did take the time to
talk to people that work at BMC and walked and talked into
the neighborhood and went to the barbershops and the beauty
parlor.
A lot of people knew about the process and a good deal
that people did not know, but those that knew were very,
very focused on who they thought would be a very good
candidate. But-- but before I go into the depth of my

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

work that they put into bringing us the candidates that we

remarks, I also want to just thank those that have emailed
and testified this evening, uh, that really kept the level
of testimony at a very high level, uh, that didn't go into
bashing a character assassin-- assassination. And for those

And I hope that we-- as we go forward in deliberative
processes, in community-based processes, that people focus

That being said, uh, this is an exciting moment. It's an-it's a historical moment. It's a tremendous opportunity
that we had before us. As most of us know, since the
establishment of the city manager position in 1942, 11
individuals have served in this role.
Save the interim manager, Lisa Peterson, who I have to
pause and thank. And she left our service a couple of years
ago. Um, and she stepped in during her time here to
shepherd the, uh, keep us going while we chose a, um, city
manager. And so she was here, uh, very briefly, five weeks
in 2016. And I just think it's important that we
acknowledge that work. But since 1942, 11 individuals have
served the role of city manager.
They have all been men. They've all been men. And as a

city counselor and as a city council that says, we want to
lift up people who we do not normally see. And we want to
lift up women in particular. I know that this was our
opportunity. This is our opportunity to say we are going to
83
Packet Pg. 1449

9

do what we say we're really about.
So 11 men, all white men, uh, that served us up until
this point. So in a community as proudly and as diverse as

experiences and needs, it is well, it is well past time for
us to shatter the status quo. It is well past time to
appoint a woman and a woman of color who truly understands
that the needs of this community are great. There's
sometimes slow and painstaking, but it's important to
engage on every level.
We need to appoint an individual that has the
experience, the temperament, and the skills necessary to
lead the city of Cambridge into the next era. In short, it
is imperative that we appoint Cheryl Watson Fisher as our
next city manager. As soon as this process began, we had
people from across the community urging the council to look
for someone outside the traditional pool of candidates,
someone who would bring in fresh ideas, a fresh

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Cambridge is, with the diversity of viewpoints, life

perspective, and understanding how to successfully wield
the-- the levers of municipal government and to-- and a
desire to look at the entirety of our local government with
fresh eyes.
84
Packet Pg. 1450

9

Cheryl Watson Fisher has all of those qualities. She
is someone who is from Cambridge, who has worked up from
humble beginnings in the port neighborhood, who has worked

Chelsea, and who understands not only the nuances of
municipal government, but how to engage the community to
ensure that a more diverse cross-section of communities is
being heard, respected, and served. You know, as the COVID19 threat appeared to be leaving us, uh, in leaving its
most acute phase, we are clearly not at that point.
We have weathered the incredible storm together, but
we are not whole. Some have seen their entire livelihoods
destroyed. Some have been forced to say goodbye to their
family members. Some have been forced out of Cambridge due
to the increased cost of living. All of us have felt the
sting of inflation, of skyrocketing gra-- gas prices and
rent payments. We may not all have had the exact same
experience these past two years, but we have all been

in numerous municipal roles, both in Cambridge and in

impacted. Our nerves are afraid, and our patient has been
made thin.
Now more than ever, we need someone with the
compassion, the dedication, the mindfulness, and the skills
85

9

necessary to helm our municipal government and lead us
toward less turbulent waters. Again, with all the four
finalists for this position, they all brought something to

virtues of, of others. I strongly believe that Cheryl
Watson Fisher is the person who has all the qualities
necessary to meet the challenges we face head on.
As the curtain-- current city solicitor of Chelsea,
the former assistant city solicitor of Cambridge, a
business owner, a member of two community boards, a member
of the port community, bilingual, person of color, and a
woman, Cheryl Watson Fisher brings with her the depth and
breadth of diverse experiences that match the diverse
experiences, love lived by our residents all across the
Cambridge community.
And why is that so important? Because when you've
lived these experiences, when you have been the only person
in the room that looks like you, when you have direct

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the table. And I-- I agree and I'm not gonna stole the

personal experience that is different from all those around
you, you begin to view things through a different lens. You
become more willing to ask, who haven't I reached out to?
That should be a part of the conversation. Who is not
86
Packet Pg. 1452

9

in this room? You become trained to challenge some basic
assumptions about how business is done. You become more
inclined to challenge those around you and who-- to think

something should be continued to be done because it's
always been done that way.
Just in case a newer way might have been more
productive in a community as diverse as ours with a
diversity of needs, the mindset becomes incredibly
important. Just as important, just as powerful as the
symbolism of bringing someone who looks like them into the
community they're serving, is to serve at the very top of
the power structure of that community and have a-- a long
talk about how we provide and preserve a diverse community
and of seeking an-- uh, seeking ways to establish a local
government that reflects diversity, opportunity, and
community.
Tonight marks that opportunity for Cambridge. To put

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

outside the box and to change the orthodoxy and to ask why

us in a place where we walk the talk, put our money where
our mouth is, to appoint a proud woman who has worked her
way up from humble beginnings in the port, to taking over
the reins of power and leading a city forward. As a member
87

9

of my-- of the port myself, as someone who lives in the
port, I think it's important that those represent-- those
neighborhoods are represented and in strong and important

That sometimes I know as a member of the Port, we
don't see or feel that the city council listens or even
thinks about what we feel or say. And through Cheryl Watson
Fisher, we have that opportunity because she gets it. It's
not-- she doesn't have to be a quick study. She doesn't
have to read the reports and watch films. She knows from
the ground.
She knows because she's lived it. She knows what it
feels like to be less than, but she also knows how to lift
people up. I can think of no one or nothing more powerful
than to appoint Cheryl Watson Fisher to this role. I should
be proudly casting my vote for what I hope will be the
first woman to serve at the helm of this city, the first
woman of color, the first black woman. You know, wouldn't

it be something to be able to say if we in Cambridge not
only did the right thing, we did hit the historic thing.
And so I-- I want to reiterate, we say something to
young girls and boys. When we appoint, should we appoint
88
Packet Pg. 1454

9

and we should appoint Cheryl Watson Fisher. We are saying
to little girls and boys that you can be a CEO, you can be
the mayor, you can be the city manager. And how many times

let's see if we can promote someone that all our children,
our families, our employees, and ourselves can look up to.
I firmly, firmly support Cheryl Watson Fisher.

very public process. You-- your life gets scrutinized and,
uh, that's-- that's a-- a challenging process to go

So I really appreciate them taking this opportunity. I
also-- I wanted to say I appreciate all the feedback we
received from community members, uh, either here tonight or
89
Packet Pg. 1455

9

through the emails, uh, over the course of the past few
days. Um, I-- I also want to say that it's wonderful to
have four strong and diverse applicants before us. Uh, I
believe we have a great group of candidates and any one of
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

them is capable of doing the job and being our next city
manager.
Um, I will say, as others said, as a community, we
came up with an-- an enormous list of expectations and
criteria for the next city manager. And no one will ever
meet these criteria and check every box. Uh, but I do
believe we have an excellent staff and great department
heads that are gonna help any-- any one of our candidates
as city manager and the transition. Uh, I do have to call
out though.
It's-- it's unfortunate and I don't mean to be
negative, um, but however, that some in the community have
framed this as an insider versus outsider debate. And some
have written to tell us to vote against any insiders
referring to candidates who either are from Cambridge, have
worked in Cambridge or have ties to Cambridge. And that's
very unfortunate because as a lifelong Cantor Bridge in,
former teacher, public employee, union leader, now public

official, I find it disappointing and hurtful. And I have
many family members and friends who have either worked for
the city or have strong connections to the city.

public service in the city of Cambridge. And I think it
sends a terrible message to our employees, and quite
honestly to our young people, the message being that you,
that they should not aspire to a career in public service
or to grow their professional career here in Cambridge.
Because coming from Cambridge or working in Cambridge will
be held against you in any pro-- promotional process.
We should be doing everything we can to recruit,
retain, and grow the best professional workforce we can,
rather than disparaging those who have experience and
history within our city. I'm also disappointed by those who
have suggested that there are conflicts of interest on the
part of candidates due to their lifelong friendships and
professional associations, while being unable to point to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Uh, many amongst us have dedicated our careers to

one instance of such a conflict or ethical lapse.
I just needed to, uh, put that out there because
there's been so much commentary on these issues. Uh, now as
to the four candidates we have before us, my first choice
91
Packet Pg. 1457

9

for city manager is Chelsea City Solicitor Cheryl Watson
Fisher. Uh, I've actually known Ms. Fisher-- Ms. Watson
Fisher since I was 12 years old and spent eight weeks in

Brandeis University.
I also participated in junior achievement here in the
city at Cambridge Tri-- Latin High School. I was a Mason
student, but the classes were, uh, Cambridge Latin. Uh, I
enjoyed, uh, getting to know both Cheryl and her sister,
and we had wonderful times together. I will say that I have
not seen or spoken to Cheryl probably in about 30 years, so
I was happy to see that she, uh, took this opportunity to
apply.
She has deep roots in Cambridge. Uh, she has dedicated
herself to her career in public service and the law. She's
worked for the city of Cambridge early in her career as
assistant city solicitor. She left Cambridge to grow
professionally and and became the city solicitor in

summer camp with Cheryl and his sister Charlotte at

Chelsea. In Chelsea, she managed both the cities and school
department's legal issues and collective bargaining. In
addition, she serves on the executive leadership team of
the city and wore many hats and stepped in to fill the
92

shoes of missing department heads when called upon.
She has brought experience in-- in municipal
management and government in years of experience and

passion for our city and its residents clear. She knows the
issues and challenges we face, and she is aligned with our
council's goals. She will build upon our strong foundations
and help us become a more equitable city.
When we vote, I will be proud to vote for Cheryl
Watson Fisher as our first female, uh, city manager of
color. And I also just have to say, uh, you know, uh,
Councillor McGovern and Councillor Simmons, you are very
eloquent in your comments and I second everything that you
said. Uh, thank you, Madam Mayor, and I yield

care, we are presented with four exceptionally qualified
candidates, each with their own gifts and talents that they
would bring to the role. Like my colleague, I-- I believe
that any of these four candidates would make a great city
manager. So like it was for many of you, this has been a
very difficult decision. And as most people know, I'm a
Cantabrigian by choice and even an American by choice. And
I don't think that there is any real conflict between
people who have been here forever and people who have come
here more recently.
We all love Cambridge and we want what is best for the
city and its diverse residents. I've always felt welcome
here and that's why I chose to settle here. My kids went

Huang and Iram Farooq. And it may be surprising for some to
hear me say that about Iram, but I felt that she made a
really compelling case. I enjoy working with her.
I respect her background and lived experience, and I
do not see her as a continuation of the current
administration. However, after very careful thought and
reflection and lots and lots of listening, I've decided to
support Yi-An to be our next city manager. I believe that
he offers the bold, dramatic change that we need. I know he
will respect the will of the council and will work to build
strong relationships with each of us.
One that is based on transparency and open
communication. I know that he shares our agenda and
priorities and I'm particularly excited for the potential

priorities that we all expressed on this council.

opportunity through green jobs, and a long-awaited

city's emerging cannabis industry.
This is a critical moment in our city's history, one
in which you're finally turning the page to a brighter
tomorrow. Thank you everyone who's participated in this
process so far, and I can't wait to make our ambitions a
reality over the course of the next year with Yi-An as our
city manager. Thank you.

So thank you to the four finalists for all of the time
they put into the process and for making yourselves so
available to the Cambridge community. My colleagues tonight
have shared many great reasons why they're supporting the
candidates they're supporting, uh, and I appreciate their
comments about the difficulty, uh, and the process and the
ups and downs. Uh, and I agree with so much of what's been
said. I want to thank everyone who reached out to us
throughout the process. Uh, we heard from hundreds of
residents who've been really integral.
For me personally, after a lot of careful
consideration, deliberation, doing my due diligence, more
conversations, I've come to the conclusion, uh, that like

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that we were given the opportunity to choose between this

many of my colleagues, several of my colleagues, uh, that I
would like to support Yi-An for our next city manager. I
came to this decision after taking into account the
candidate's resumes, the written answers, numerous
97
Packet Pg. 1463

9

interview sessions, skillsets, and references. And I'm
confident that Mr. Huang is a great fit for this position.
This decision-- decision also goes back to the

and stakeholders, that they wanted someone who has
experienced tackling complex problems and has effectively
read-- led large diverse organizations. It was made clear
that the next manager needs to be experienced in inclusive
leadership, forward thinking, be forward thinking, be
progressive and collaborative, and you need to have a deep
understanding of Cambridge, but a willingness to take the
city in a new direction.
These are criteria that I believe Mr. Huang has proven
that he meets. His references were extremely strong and
point to a history of entering into complex organizations
and helping change the culture. As one reference said, they
could not think of any challenge that he couldn't excel at
in his written answers. And during the interviews, he

talked about his experience building positive cultures in
large and complex organization.
He noted his approach, plus equity, thinking about

orientation, collaboration, and accountability. These are
all qualities we need in our next city manager. And Mr.
Huang showed throughout this process that he will lead in

sense is that the city of Cambridge has many strengths,
this also feels like an opportunity to reassess strength in
the organization and set in-- set new and ambitious goals.
I agree with that sentiment. I would look forward to
work with-- to work with them on what's to come. So I think
each of us comes to this decision based on our live life
experience, based on the many conversations we've had with
people and members of the community. And of course, this
council, there's not everyone who will be in agreement. Uh,
that's-- that's historically, I think the whole point of
having a city council like we do.
We-- we will not agree on everything. But I think the
process that brought us to these candidates, uh, was a good
process and things that we learned, things we couldn't have

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Point of personal

privilege, could we take a short recess before we go to
executive session?
We can. So I think first we

should move to-- move into executive session and then also
have a 10 minute-- 10 minute recess.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Vice Mayor Mallon.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Um, just a point of order.

Did we want to, um, discuss before going into executive
session or discussing an open session whether or not to
appoint an acting city manager, um, and then we would be
able to discuss that in executive session?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We can do both.

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

So again, the question was

whether or not to appoint a acting city manager now. The
council could do that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, the coun-- as I said,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

the council can go into executive session for that. For the
purposes, uh, the council may discuss an open session
whether to appoint an acting city manager and if so,
whether to conduct a strategy session in preparation for
102
Packet Pg. 1468

9

negotiations with non-union personnel.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

I just want to clarify,

the council could vote now to appoint someone to-- to be

session to discuss the idea of, uh, an interim city
manager, but it couldn't vote on appointing a person or
talk about names in the executive session. So just to
clarify.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Chair?

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

I'd like to go with

your original recommendation, which is we can go to
executive session. We don't take any votes there, but we
can make-- we can have deliberation and then we can come
out and make the vote. I think your-- your decision or the
way you had laid it out was-- was sufficient and we should
just follow what you had laid out before.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor?

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the interim, uh, city manager. It could go into executive

Vice Mayor Mallon.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

I just have a question for

the City Clerk and the City Solicitor. Can we discuss in
executive session an acting city manager if we have not
103
Packet Pg. 1469

9

debated it an open session, whether or not we want to do
that? I just want to make sure we're clear when we go on
through the executive session, what can be discussed.
Uh, I'll turn it over to

the Solicitor, but you can discuss the idea of appointing
an interim. You can't discuss names if you were to do it in
executive session.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor.

Um, I-- I agree with the Clerk to-- to be a little bit
more, uh, detailed. If you wish to, um, discuss who the
council would like to appoint as acting city manager, that
discussion would need to take place in open session.
At that point after that person has been identified,
you can discuss contract term negotiation in executive
session. Alternatively, you could discuss, uh, the terms
that you might wish to offer to an acting city manager in
executive session, but you may not discuss who that
discussion would be related to if you have not already

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

named the person either in open session or, um, you could
discuss that subsequently.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you. Through you

Madam Mayor. So if we were to discuss a certain person that
104
Packet Pg. 1470

9

we would be appointing or discuss appointing, we would have
to do that now and then discuss terms in the executive
session?
Through you Madam Mayor,

the other alternative is to go into executive session and
to say whoever we wish to discuss in open session later, we
could agree that, uh, we would offer X salary or for Y, Z,
other terms of that contract. But it might be a little bit
more difficult if you don't know yet who you're talking
about but it could be done that way.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Oh, thank you, Madam Mayor.

I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So the-- I-- I had a motion to

move into executive session for purposes of conducting a
strategy session in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel relative to the city manager's position.
Uh, and so I had that motion. Go ahead, Zon-- Councillor
Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I'm confused. Are we appointing an acting city
manager or not?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So from my understanding, Vice
105
Packet Pg. 1471

9

Mayor, are you going to make a motion for appointing a city
manager at this point? Uh, in interim city manager at this
point?
No. I think going into

executive session and discussing the idea and then coming
back out into open session to discuss whether or not we are
going to do that with a person attached.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So we can move right now into

an executive session to do both.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, let me just--

You have the language.

CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

If I may, it would be to

enter executive session to, um, to discuss the preparations
for negotiations with Yi-An Huang, um, for the position of
city manager-- for the offer of the position of city
manager and to discuss potential negotiations with an
acting city manager, uh, in the interim 'cause the-- the
purpose of discussing the acting and executive session

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

the person serving in that role. And the council will be
returning to public session from the executive session.

discussed in our executive session.
We will go ahead and say that the City Solicitor
engaged the services of Valerio Dominello & Hillman, LLC.

Or if that firm is unavailable, another suitable available
law firm in con-- consultation with the personnel director
and as approved by the City Solicitor to negotiate an

council on terms to be discussed by the full city council
at a future executive session meeting with the employment
contract to be approved at a future open meeting of the
city council. So that's our first motion.
The second motion is that the City Solicitor and the
personnel director are directed to negotiate the interim
acting city manager contract on behalf of the city council.
Um, actually that's-- that's just the-- the-- let's vote on
the first motion. Uh, and we'll do a roll call on that.
CITY CLERK ANTHONY WILSON:

VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Uh, thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you, um, the, uh, as the contract is being
negotiated with, uh, Mr. Huang, we understand that our
current city manager, uh, is retiring on July 5th, and that
there will likely be, uh, some number of weeks in between
the contract negotiation-- negotiation and when Mr. Huang
will be able to start.
So we do need to discuss tonight, um, an acting city
manager that will, uh, act as city manager in the interim
for those number of weeks. So, uh, just would like to talk

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Paul F. Toner – Yes

briefly about the process, um, by which we got to, uh,
where we are today. Um, when we understood that, um, we
would be making this decision likely this evening and that
there would be only a month in between the vote and when
110
Packet Pg. 1476

9

Mr. DePasquale retires on July 5th, we, um, under the
charter are allowed to, or as a city council, are able to
appoint a department head, uh, as acting city manager.

First, we did have an ac-- uh, assistant city manager
who was, um, in the running for this position. So that
person was, um, not considered and we considered some other
department heads. But, um, in those conversations, the
commissioner of the Department of Public Works was amenable
to stepping into the role for several weeks, um, to ensure
that we had a city manager in the interim between hiring
the city manager tonight and when they were able to start.
Um, I have spoken with our executive search firm and
Mr. Huang does need some time in between, uh, tonight's
vote, both to give notice to negotiate that contract, uh,
and finish out his time at Boston Medical Center, as well
as, uh, enjoy a family vacation with his family before, uh,
he is able to-- to sit in the seat.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

There were some considerations that we, um, went through.

So I would be putting forward a motion tonight for
discussion of, um, executing a contract with the
Commissioner Owen O' Riordan, um, to act as the city
manager. So, uh, I just wanted to explain the process there
111
Packet Pg. 1477

and, um, hopefully open it up for discussion by colleagues.
Thank you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Discussion from my colleagues

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. I understand that there will be sometime between
the retirement and the start date, and I, uh, understand
from the charter as has been said by Vice Mayor that we are
authorized to have a department head. I think it's an
excellent idea. Um, if, uh, Mr. O' Riordan is amenable and
I would support that motion.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Others? Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Um, we're lucky to have

someone, uh, like Mr. O' Riordan to step in and, uh, I
agree with counsel and Nolan and the Vice Mayor. This would
be almost a seamless, uh, transition with someone of his

We're now on to City Manager

Agenda Item Number 1, transmitting communication from
Louise DePasquale, City Manager, relative to an order
authorizing the city manager to transfer necessary funds
needed to maintain appropriation control as part of the
fiscal end of year closeout process. Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to the manager. I recall last year I asked the
118
Packet Pg. 1484

9

similar question on approximate size of this transfer and
it was relatively minor compared to the overall budget. So
my question is, is that again the case?
So through you, uh,

Madam Chair, it really depends and David probably got some
estimates on what contracts weren't settled in the budget.
So at the time we put the budget together, there was a
salary adjustment account. The-- until the unions have
agreed, then gets moved to the department. So David could
give you the specifics, but if it was a large department,
the transfer could be logic as the money was put in and out
of budget. But David and Taha have been working on the
details, so I'll turn it over to them.
DAVID KALE:

So through you, Mayor-- Madam Mayor to,

uh, Councilor Carlone, the same principle will be and Taha
has some estimates, but we did have some public safety
contracts that were settled during the year and obviously
that will be offset by some savings through vacancies and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

the like.
So the overall scope will be similar. It won't be a
huge amount of money, but it allows us to close the books
without having to come back to the council to do individual
119
Packet Pg. 1485

9

transfers. And we use it just to do for that purpose, which
is to balance the books primarily to cover the cost of
salary, uh, contract settlements and it should not be a

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

that there's no figure. I understand why, but I wanted to
hear you say it again. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

none, we can go ahead and do a roll call in adopting the

We will now go on to City

Manager Agenda Item Number 6, the communication transmitted
from Louis DePasquale, City Manager, relative to proposed
amendments to the Truck Safety Ordinance, chapter 8.112.080
of the Cambridge Municipal Code. We have two orders within
this, uh, to adopt. So-- but first we'll go to Councillor
Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to my colleagues. The truck safety
ordinance allows the city to attach certain requirements
to, um, trucks that serve as city contracts to improve the
safety of those trucks operating in our city, including
putting side guards which protect against, uh, in the case
of a bicycle collision, somebody getting pulled under the
truck.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So the request, as I understand it for amendments, is
to allow the department to more easily accept a contract
in-- in situations where the vendor is unwilling or unable
to make those modifications and there are not, uh, other
121
Packet Pg. 1487

9

vendors bidding on the contract. And so essentially, the
city is stuck without being able to provide the service.
Um, and, you know, obviously, that creates a problem.
So I-- I am supportive of granting that flexibility,
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

but I do want to make sure that we have accountability as
to whether this ordinance is actually working and whether
we are actually getting safety improvements. So I have-- I
had transmitted to the clerk, uh, earlier this evening, an
amendment that would, uh, require an annual report to keep
the council abreast of, uh, how these waivers are being
issued. How many and whether or not the ordinance is-- is
achieving the side effects. So I will move to amend the
proposed amendments to add this, uh, provision to-- to
them.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So Councillor Zondervan, uh,

had shared an amendment with the clerk, uh, that was sent
to all of us. We will get that on the screen momentarily,
but there it is. So the amendment is under the waiver
section 2-- 2.112.087, and it's to add provision E as
follows.
E on an annual basis, the city manager shall provide a
report to the city council that includes the number of
122

Packet Pg. 1488

9

waivers issued, the number of responsive contracts executed
without a waiver, and the total number of contracts
executed during the previous fiscal year, as well as any

relevant information regarding the effectiveness of this
ordinance in increasing the safety of trucks operated in
Cambridge. So we will have a discussion on this amendment.
Councillor McGovern and then Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you. As the lead

sponsor on the policy order along Councillor Toner that
asked for-- for this report, I'm fine with this and I
checked with the city too, and it's not gonna interfere
with, um, you know, the ability for them to solve this
problem. So I'm fine with it.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Again, through you to the manager and his team. Uh, I was

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

trends parenthesis, positive or negative, and any other

the councillor that put this forward back when-- in my
first term, and eventually it was made into an ordinance.
And, um, so my question is, shouldn't we have something in
here that says when you buy a new truck, it should have
123
Packet Pg. 1489

9

guards? I mean, wouldn't they just keep going and not put
guards on?
DAVID KALE:

So you, um, and Owen O' Riordan is on the

a lot of vendors use third parties to do their deliveries.
So they don't necessarily own the trucks that are doing the
deliveries. So therefore, it's difficult for the vendor to
manage the third party to see what they're doing for their
fleet in terms of retrofitting.
Now, eventually that may be the case when you buy new
vehicles and may become the practice, but that's one of the
challenges we have. Not all the vendors we do business with
actually own their fleet of vehicles to make the
deliveries. So that's one of the things that I think the
world's gonna have to catch up with. I don't know if Owen's
on the line, he or Joe that has-- or Liz has any other
commentary on that, but I think it's not as straightforward
as one would think.
DEPUTY CITY MANAGER OWEN O'RIORDAN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

line. I think one of the things that we're finding is that

Um, through you,

Madam Mayor. Um, I would agree with what David has said,
and again, I-- I-- just our leverage with, um, contractor
isn't such that we can force them to, uh, include these
124
Packet Pg. 1490

9

elements on their trucks. Um, I think one of the things to
note here is that we've indicated that we may, um, offer
waivers.

strongly encourage contractors as they, uh, go through the
execution process in terms of city contracts that they do
provide, um, these, um, these, uh, improvements to their
trucks, um, as-- as they think about executing contracts
with us. And so, uh, we continue to, um, leverage the
extent that we can with these contractors that they provide
these improvements to their trucks.
But again, as David said, there are many instances
where we don't have sufficient control over these contracts
and where there are many vendors who actually-- actually
use third parties to, um, convey materials to the city. And
so unfortunately, we just don't have the level of control
over these contractors that would allow that to happen.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

again, um, to the manager and his team, it seems to me that
there will come a time no matter who is doing the work,
that they will be buying a new truck. And I think there

needs to be a statement that says that when buying a new
truck, we expect that, uh, any contractor would be living
up to the full meaning of the ordinance. You're-- if I

demanding it. Or maybe we are, maybe I am, but you're not
saying now, but trucks don't last forever.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DESPAQUALE:

Ah, true. You Madam

Mayor. Only ‘cause I've been part of this negotiation, we
have really worked hard to make sure the people understand
the importance to this request. If we manage and say they
have to, I'm getting the impression that they will say they
don't need Cambridge's business, that's right. That's what
we're up against.
Now, we could strongly recommend, which we have, we
will strongly push, but if we say they have to, they will
just say thank you, but no thank you. And that's the
discussion, the broadest to this point. We've played every
card we had in the deck in the conclusion-COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

pretty much what we were told and that's why we are
bringing it here because we, uh, we've tried everything
possible and they're not budging.
Okay, if I might just

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

clarify, I said strongly encourage and that's makes them
realize that this is a serious ordinance and not something
that they can continue to not, um, respond to.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DESPAQUALE:

I think-- I think

strongly encourage is fine language. I just-- I want to be
honest to say that we have pushed Todd. I believe, and
they've pushed Todd back saying, we don't want your
business. If those are the guys, we, I have no issue
pushing with that. And I think we will continue to push
that.
But I want to be honest, this has been a difficult
conversation, but we understand the importance and that's
why it took us so long to get it 'cause we really didn't
want to come to this point. We thought we could kind of get
them to do it. And it's not been successful, to be very
honest.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

that, uh, if they don't have these safer, uh, elements on a
truck, the drivers have to be aware that they have to, to

tonight, I saw a truck that made-- well, I won't go into
it, and it was an out-of-town truck. Different city's name
was on it. All right. Thank you, Madam Mayor. But I do
encourage that we add what our expectations are in the
future and that we hardily recommend they purchase vehicles
that meet the intent of the ordinance in the future.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So before I go back to

Councillor Zondervan, I did see Vice Mayor Mallon's hand
up.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. Um, as somebody who has been, uh, working with
the school department, Food and Nutrition Department, that
they are not able to execute a contract for next year's
school food. And they've had a significant bunch of issues

drive even safer than they normally do. Just coming here

around supply chain issues, rising food costs, and to add
this uncertainty onto getting food to our children for the
next school year, it-- it's-- I-- I don't know if, um, if
the manager-- the manager or Ms. Unger, just want to speak
128
Packet Pg. 1494

9

briefly to like, what has gone into this and why it is
urgent.
We're balancing a couple of different things here and

here every week, um, there-- there is some real realities
around what the manager said, which is people are just
saying to us, oh, well, sorry, um, I'm gonna take my
business elsewhere. I-- and you know, Ms. Unger could
probably speak to the fact that we participate in an urban
ring of contracts for things like food, paper, um, and
because we have this ordinance, we may not be able to
participate in that ring and enjoy, um, bigger discount on
food. So I don't know if either of you want to speak to
that.

DIRECTOR ELIZABETH UNGER:

The school department has,
129
Packet Pg. 1495

9

um, been meeting with the purchasing department for the
past several months to try to address the issues that
they're having with, uh, fulfilling their food contracts.

As you've mentioned, Vice Mayor, there's been issues
with that just on the supply chain piece of things as well.
But the school has done their due diligence in trying to
work with the contractors that make these deliveries and
have been pretty much shut down as far as the truck safety
ordinance goes. Um, if they're not able to purchase through
this consortium, um, given the nature of the food market
for the school department, um, it's going to be nearly
impossible for them to fulfill their responsibilities, uh,
for the food program.
So the school has advocated for the schools, uh, with
their contractors. Um, the purchasing department has worked
with them to advocate as well, and we've hit a stonewall.
So without the ability to waive, uh, for a consortium,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

They do purchase off of a consortium.

which is a contract that the city itself does not go out to
bid for, um, and that's a power that's, uh, that's not a
waiver that's not allowed in the ordinance as it's
currently written. Uh, the school department is not going

for further explaining kind of where we are in this-- in
this moment, particularly around school food. So thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go-- we've already

gone to a few councillors. First before I go back to them,
anyone who hasn't spoken who would like to speak on this
matter? Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

I'll be very brief. I

understand there's real concerns about this ordinance and
us trying to do things, and yet I also know in here that we
have sports that are waiting for it. We have the schools
that are waiting for it. It is something we need to keep
working on and we need to keep pushing for, and yet it's
also something I hope that we will decide tonight to move

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

forward on.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. We'll go back to

Councillor Zondervan and then Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

131

Mayor. Through you to my colleague. The ordinance, as I
understand it does not regulate purchasing of vehicles. It
only regulates that the vehicle must meet certain

retrofitting existing trucks. And-- and the DPW in fact
assists the vendors in making those retrofits if they wish
to do so.
So I-- I think we are beyond encouraging, we are
really working directly with vendors to make sure that they
can meet the-- the ordinance. All-- all that's being
proposed is that the department can grant waivers in
certain situations where the vendors just not interested or
not willing or not able to-- to meet those requirements, to
retrofit their trucks. Uh, or if they're dealing with the
sub contractor and they're not able to compel them to do
it.
So, you know, this ordinance obviously doesn't go far
enough. It doesn't regulate most of the trucks that are on

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

requirements and those requirements can be achieved through

the roads and-- and we don't have the power to do that,
unfortunately. But if-- if even one vendor upgrades their
trucks because we have this ordinance, that is-- is a win.
And so I think, you know, allowing a little more
132
Packet Pg. 1498

9

flexibility and then requiring that we get an annual report
to tell us how it's going is probably the best we can do at
this point until hopefully we can get more help from our

our-- of trucks on our streets across the board. Because
this ultimately can only regulate trucks that are doing
business with the city.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

I understand that. I'm

going to be voting for this as is with your amendment. I'm
just asking questions for clarification and reinforcing
what our goal is. I know contract-- construction
contractors, none of them will put on this, uh, support or
protection unless they're forced to. And I assume truckers
in general are gonna be that way because it's not a big
money industry anymore.
So my-- my last question, Madam Mayor, through you to
the manager and his team is this ordinance is not new. It's

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

state and-- and federal regulators to improve the safety of

been in existence, I think three or years and we've not had
problems before, but now we do. That seems
counterintuitive.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DESPAQUALE:

That was-- that was my

133
Packet Pg. 1499

9

question when it came up. So I'll let the purchasing agent
answer it.
DIRECTOR ELIZABETH UNGER:

Through you, Madam Mayor.

are of a term of three years or one year with two options
to renew. It is now what we're seeing is an influx of
those, um, last renewals having expired or the three-year
term of a contract having expired. And we're going out for
some contracts that we don't usually go out for with such
frequency.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

All right. That makes

sense. That makes sense. Thank you. I understand the
dilemma.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Anyone--

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Anyone else before we go ahead

and adopt a few things? So first we have the order within
our book, uh, Agenda Item Number 6A and then we have Order

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Um, as it would play out, often the city has contracts that

Number 6B, um, is to adopt the attached amendments. But
before we do that, we have to do a roll call on Councillor
Zondervan's amendment, uh, and then we have to take that
ordinance as amended and pass it to a second reading
134

because it's an ordinance. So those are the three things
we'll do.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Point-- point of

Councillor Zondervan, state

your point.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. The

orders, um, A and B are actually to adopt the ordinance
tonight as a-- as an emergency, uh, order. So we would not
be passing it to a second reading.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So the Clerk had said we'd had

to do at the second reading, but I-- your point is well
taken. And I agree with the City Solicitor who's nodding at
me since it's emergency. We can do that tonight.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Yes. Through you, Madam

Mayor. The council has the authority to, um, pass
legislation through all stages of legislation at one
session. Um, it-- unless there's state law that has

superseding provisions, for example, chapter 40A, but this

circumstances.

We have a charter written item on the calendar about

Transportation Department to limit the blocking of Memorial
Drive to vehicular traffic to Sundays. Pleasure of the city
Council. Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Chair. I want to-- on this matter that we are, let me just
thank you, Madam Chair. I want to say that since my
colleague Councillor Toner res-- exercised this charter
right on this policy order a couple of weeks ago, I've been
able to convene two really good community meetings to
discuss the situation, uh, around Memorial Drive. And I
want to thank my colleague, Councillor McGovern, who was
to-- was able to attend one of the two.
We have heard from area residents who are in favor of
keeping Memorial Drive close to vehicular traffic on the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

directing the Director of Traffic, Parking and

weekend. And from those who desperately want Memorial Drive
to once again be open to ve-- vehicles on Saturdays. And
from those who are still making up their minds, I'm happy
to report that everyone was-- was respectful of one another
140
Packet Pg. 1506

9

even when they didn't agree on the solution.
And the important thing is these meetings provide the
most impacted by the city's decision with-- with the

meeting last Thursday during which people started
brainstorming about the mitigating measures the city might
take to calm traffic in this area.
And in the interest of a landlord of the residents to
be heard, I'm going to ask my colleagues to vote to lay
this on the table, allowing us a chance to convene some
additional community meetings. And I believe from these
meetings, people will feel respected, they'll feel heard,
and we will ultimately reach a healthier, more holistic
resolution to this matter. I thank you and I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

With that, we have a motion

before us, discussion, colleagues. We do need to vote to
put this on the table. Councillor Zondervan.

opportunity to be heard. We held a particularly solid

Mayor. I certainly appreciate the efforts to have community
conversation, but I-- I'm not in support of this order. I
prefer that we simply vote on it and, you know, community
conversation can happen whether or not this order is on the

table. So I-- I'll be voting no to tabling it and voting no
on adopting it. Thank you.
Councillor Toner.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. I

just, uh, hope we can table it so it gives us just a little
bit more time. Nothing's gonna change. Uh, the, uh,
Memorial Drive will be, uh, open or closed Saturday and
Sunday until we resolve this issue. But I do think we
should take a little more time to discuss some of the
impacts and figure out if we can, um, mitigate the issues,
uh, for the residents in the area while also, um, uh,
providing for the enjoyment of the river. So I hope we can
table it. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor Azeem

and then Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

the motion? Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Just quickly, Madam

Mayor, um, through you, uh, I have no doubt and I-- I've
not-- I don't know the details of the policy order, but I
suspect, uh, it's going to use, uh, a lot of common sense
and the abilities that the city has to help move traffic.
So I'm optimistic that we can lessen the impact and still
keep Mem Drive open. So I-- I will be voting in the
affirmative. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

With no nothing further, we'll

want to be discussing these motions. Uh, I can make, uh,
move the adoption, uh, under this specific items. And also,
uh, so that the committee understands that the, um,
committee item that we brought before us includes an
acceptance of the committee report and placing it on file,
which requires a vote.
There's also the adoption of the general fund budget,
the adoption of the water budget, and the adoption of the
public investment fund budget. Uh, I'm not sure if the-- if

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Nolan, Chair and Councillor Dennis Carlone, chair of the

members of the council want to, uh, discuss the budget or
make any comments about it before we move to adopt the
various items. I am excited about this process.
I recognize we had as three separate full hearings on
147

9

the, um, on the budget, uh, over the course of the last
month. We also did receive, uh, an and solicited an
information and comments from the public. It-- while I

has not been as much attention to the budget being on, um,
the agenda tonight, the reality is we did have several
hearings of the budget and people had an opportunity in
each of those hearings to come forward and talk about it.
This, uh, budget is-- is also properly before us, as
is always happens as part of the committee report from the
finance committee brought forth to the-- to the full
council. So I wanted to make it clear to people that while
there-- there's certainly been many other things going on
in the city. This is the way the budget has always
presented, um, to the council in order for adoption at the,
uh, first meeting in June. So, again, I'm happy to make the
motions, but also, I'm not sure if any other members of the
council want to weigh in on the budget.

And the end result, at least one of the end results
were, we had the least a number of public comments on this
budget that I remember from all previous ones questioning
or proposing. Now, one could say that it was just too much,
but in the past we had many more people. And, um, as I said
then, I have to really, uh, respect the way it was put
together. And if nothing else from this point on, we have a
starting point of understanding how much money is in each
goal and we can move forward from there. So I, uh, agree
with Councillor Nolan that we should move ahead. Thank you.

Through you, I also think we should move ahead tonight. Um,
we've had a lot of discussion about the budget. It's-- it's
time to-- to move forward. I know that there are, um, there
are a number of job descriptions and that I think of the

there are job descriptions to kind of get that going, but
that can't happen until we approve them-- really approve

So we can hire people. Um, there's probably other
positions that are in similar, uh, uh, in a similar place.
Um, and I don't think anything is really gonna change, um,
between now and next week. So we should-- we should put
this to bed.

Others commentary? Con--

Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. I certainly appreciate the process
that's been followed, but it's not in my recollection, uh,
uh, been the normal process because normally the budget
vote is advertised and people in the public know when we
are voting on the budget. And that is not the case tonight.
So I-- I'm just baffled that we are presented with

the money, uh, to make that happen.

this surprise process and, you know, I certainly hope that
in the future we will be more transparent with the public
about what-- what is happening in-- in the council. I mean,
you know, we just voted to appoint a new city manager
150

that's obviously distracted everybody and-- and, you know,
taken up all their attention.
So I understand that the budget isn't going to

vote on. So I think a reasonable thing to do would be to
table this and-- and vote on it next week.

country itself to likewise indicate-- undertake, excuse me,

constituents all the time. And it would be, uh, helpful to
have some of that training as well.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes. And actually the-- my

office and the city manager did work to, uh, put together a
mental health training for employees. Um, but I do think
that it'd be great to also have the council at some point
do that as well. So, you know, we can put that in as

Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Do you want to speak on it first?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

No, please go ahead.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you. Uh, Chief

Raymond is someone that I discovered when working with
Kathleen Walcott. Some of you will remember her through an
organization that we-- we both, um, headed together, Ethnic
Foundation Incorporated for years back in the '.80s We
would do these presentations about Black History lost and
found, and it took us several years, but we were able to

So, I'm very pleased when the Mayor asked me to
sponsor this order, because it talks about our history, the
presentation and representation of African-Americans in our

community. 'Cause we often think our children in
particular, that some of the advances made by black people- black/African-Americans in the city are-- are rather

So this speaks to the history, the presence, the work
and the community that Chief Raymond, uh, represented. And
to have a permanent marker so that when anyone, myself
included, but as we go through the streets of Cambridge, we
can look at this-- this marker and say there was this man
who was a-- a fire chief and was the first African-American
fire chief in the country. And so I-- I'm hoping that my
colleagues will stand with us, uh, on this order of going
forward. I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor Simmons,

for your co-sponsorship. Anything further from the body?
We'll go ahead and adopt policy for number 6. All those in
favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Those against say nay, the ayes
have it. We now move on to policy order number 7, which is

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank you, Madam Mayor. I--

uh, and rework, uh, this, uh, policy order based on some
information I received earlier today. So if I could, uh,
put a charter right on it and bring something, uh, amended
back to you next week, that would be great.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

No problem. Councillor Toner

exercises his charter right on number 7. We'll go to
accounts-- we'll go to policy number 8, which is for the
creation of an ad-hoc committee for an ad-hoc committee for
the purpose of reviewing and selecting self nominated
residents and stakeholders to be on the Charter Review
Commission. This was filed by myself and Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. If you would like to, uh, talk about your
communication order. Want me to review the policy order,

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

You go ahead.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Okay. Uh, this, uh, as

the communication from the mayor indicates in conjunction
with the policy order, this is in reference to establishing
a Charter Review Commission, which came directly out of the
ballot initiative that was passed in November of 2021 by
the voters of the city with, um, which the council had
proposed.
The-- what the policy order does is establish an ad
hoc committee of the Cambridge City Council that it will be
formed for the purpose of reviewing and selecting self
nominated residents and stakeholders to be on the Charter
Review Commission. Um, for all of us to, um, under-- make
sure that we understand the process, the-- all councillors

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I'm-- I'm open.

will, uh, have an opportunity to input into the committee
if this ad hoc committee is established and the process
itself of the Charter Review Commission, while it be-- will
be comprised of per the charter that was passed and is in
178
Packet Pg. 1544

9

law of a number of voters of the city, they will, uh, will
be charged with convening public input and forums for any
kind of suggestions for the-- for the charter changes that

They will not, um, be able to vote anything without
the council forwarding it changing and then go into the
voters of the city. But what the policy order and the
communication before us is to establish the Charter Review
Commission, which has a time on it. It is, um, per our
charter expected to be, uh, in place by early July so that
we, uh, need to get this in process pretty soon.
The idea is that, uh, four of us would, uh, select the
res-- the, uh, folks to serve on this-- on this committee.
And I had sent to the clerk earlier today, there was a, an
error in when we-- when this policy order was sent to the
clerk. There were-- if-- if you have read it on the-- the
two ordered at the end are exactly the same and it was-there was supposed to be a different second ordered.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

might be proposed.

I'm not sure if the count-- if the clerk wants to read
it, but instead of a duplicate of ordered about the ad hoc
committee, it should be replaced with, you should all have
it. I don't know if we want to put it up on the screen.
179
Packet Pg. 1545

9

Ordered that the ad hoc committee will ensure the full City
Council has input into the Charter Review Commission
members and will put a communication on the June 27th, 2022

So that's the proposed amendment to this policy order. And
I'm very excited that we're moving forward, uh, with this
process to establish this Charter Review Commission.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So that amendment is before

us. Discussion, we have Councillors Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I-- I have some comments about the charter review
process itself, but I-- I first would like to understand
the amendment when, uh, my colleagues says we'll have
input. What does that mean exactly?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Right. The intention

here is to ensure that while there's only four of us on the
ad hoc committee, that we will be making sure that any--

that all councillors are able to deliver to the four of us
on the-- on the ad hoc committee, their thoughts on who
would be, uh, really good members for the Charter Review
commission.
180
Packet Pg. 1546

9

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I-- I guess I'm-- I'm just trying to understand what

are we having conversations with the chair of this ad hoc
committee? What-- what's the process that's envisioned
here?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So, my understanding,

Councillor Zondervan is similar to the city manager
process. There was, uh, there was a form that was filled
out by members who were interested. I envision that there
will be, um, a similar form. Uh, and you know, that form
was shared by all the city counselors, um, to those who
were interested in serving on that preliminary committee.
So in this way, I could imagine you could send it to folks
who you'd want to see on the commission to-- on the-- on
the commission. And so that's how I view the order, um, and
what input means. Councillor Nolan, you can say more if

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that looks like. Are-- are we submitting a list of names or

you'd like.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

That's exactly right.

We are trying to have this be a fully inclusive process and
make sure that the city council has input, if anyone has
181
Packet Pg. 1547

9

ideas on a better way to input. Uh, it depends. This has
not yet been passed, but assuming it passes, we are-- are
certainly open to us. I-- I know that the four of us, uh,

ready to get to work and get this, uh, started as soon as
we can.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Chair.

Sure. Uh, I'll just--

Councillor Zondervan, I'll go back to you, Councillor
Zondervan. And then I have Councillor Simmons, and then I
have Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I'm-- I'm not against the amendment. I-- I'm just
really not clear what we're saying if we're saying we have
input because sharing a-- a link to a form is not providing
input. So, you know, if-- if we want-- if we are imagining
something else, then I would like to describe that better
in the amendment so that we're clear on what-- what it is.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the Mayor, the Vice Mayor, Councillor Toner, and myself are

So Councillor Zondervan, I

think this format is one that I think comports with what
we've kind of put into place. And there is an order that
says this ad hoc confers with the law department prior to
182
Packet Pg. 1548

9

any meeting to discuss confidentiality, open meeting laws.
Um, I think if you want, we could add further-- how to get
further input. But I think because of-- we've been doing

past, the ad-hoc's committee structure was proposed to us
to be kind of the easiest way of doing it. So-COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Right. And, you

know, again, to be clear, I'm-- I'm not questioning that.
I'm just trying to understand exactly what do we mean when
we say has input. I-- I'm still not clear. I mean, all I've
heard so far is there'll be a form and we can share that
around, but that's not providing input to the committee.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Well, if you have alternate

language, we can-- we can specifically say there will be a
form shared if you want us to get really specific, but I
think this is the best way for the council to provide
input. Councillor Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

this and so because of some issues that have come in the

Just so that I'm following the dots, there's an ad hoc
committee that's going to appoint a review committee and
the whole council gets to interact with the ad hoc
committee to say who's gonna sit on the Review Commission?
183
Packet Pg. 1549

9

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So similar to the city manager

process.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

There was a com-- ad hoc

committee that was put together, which was Councillor
McGovern as chair, Councillor Toner, Councillor Zondervan
and Councillor Nolan. They reviewed all the nominations for
those to be on that screening committee, which you and I
and Councillor Carlone and Councillor Nolan, what we're on.
What we have before us is-- because the Charter Review
commission, we can't have any counselors on that
commission.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Got it.

So really in an effort to kind

of ensure we have a candidate selection process that's
balanced, we want some councillor input on who gets to be
on the commission. 'Cause we can't be on it. So this ad hoc
committee will be dis-- will be reviewing applications from

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yep, yep.

together.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Maybe it's the hour.

Uh, the only thing that I would ask then, if I-- if I get

Packet Pg. 1550

9

it at all, uh, 'cause I don't know it-- it's still a little
cloudy, but it's too late. I would-- I would respectfully
ask that we make sure that whoever is doing the appointing

And I-- with such a tight timeline, what I'm really
concerned about is there's-- they're-- there are those
people that always participate because they've got the
skill, they've got the time, they've got the knowledge. And
I really want to see something different. I want to see a-a broader-- I don't-- I can't recall how many people are on
this charter review, but let's just say for the purposes
the conversation, we have 11 neighborhoods and this should
be one person from each neighborhood and it really needs to
talk about, again, diversity ability, et cetera.
And I mean, it's-- it's just late but no longer-- I
think you get my gist, so I don't-- that's my input. You
don't have to partici-- you know, reach out to me.
Otherwise, not unless you're saying that we want you to let

us know who we should be appointing. Other than that, that
was what I would like the ad hoc committee to be sure that
they do. And I hope they have some written minutes that we
can review.

very strongly supportive of and I really want to get into
the details of it. Um, if Councillor Nolan is willing to

Well, we have to vote on the

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

have any round table minutes. We have-- we've disposed of
committee report number 1. So we have committee report
number 2, which is, uh, the ordinance committee matter on
April 6th, 2022 to conduct a public hearing. Pleasure of
the city council. Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will pull number 2.

Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you, uh, to my colleagues, as you may
recall, this was to discuss a proposed zoning amendment
that would make adjustments to the requirements under the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Eight.

Green Building Ordinance Article 22 of our zoning to, uh,
calculate the potential emissions of new buildings.
And as you may recall, there was a favorable
recommendation from the planning board, but they did
189
Packet Pg. 1555

9

suggest some changes to the, um, zoning. And in committee
we discussed that as well. The amendments were forwarded to
the council with a favorable recommendation, but it was a

motion, the community development department and the law
department were going to work with myself on making any
adjustments to the language.
Um, unfortunately, that didn't happen because, you
know, there are some other matters that have taken
precedents. Um, and in order to, uh, pass this into law
before it expires, we would have to vote it to a second
reading tonight, which I don't think is-- is going to work.
And in any case, we're-- we're going to make adjustments to
the language.
So I think the-- the better option is to let this
petition expire again and then I will bring it forward with
the adjustments to the language. And as you may also
recall, this zoning amendment is part of the Green New

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 6, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

vote of five to three. And there was a, um, as part of that

Deal, which includes a, uh, separate amendment to, uh, call
the Green Jobs ordinance that would provide for
establishing a green jobs training program as well as the
potential amendments, the Billing Energy's disclosure
190

9

ordinance, which we will be discussing at the ordinance
committee on June 22nd.
And so letting this amendment lapse and then refiling

these other two components of the Green New Deal and move
them forward together. So that would be my recommendation
to-- to the council at this point. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will then-- I think I

conferred with the clerk and I think we can just accept
this report and place it on file and no other action is
required from us. So in favor of doing that, and all those
in favor say aye. Aye. Those against say nay. The ayes have

They're both present.
DEPUTY CLERK PAULA CRANE:

Yes. So they can hear us. We

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And Councillor Azeem is on

here too, so.
DEPUTY CLERK PAULA CRANE:

Okay. So the quorum is

present with nine members.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll have to figure out

what's happening. We will, we're on it. So with that, all
of tonight's votes will be by roll call. We'll now open
public comment. Right now we have about 26 speakers with
more than 20 speakers pursuing to rule 24(C)1-A. In the
event that there are 20 or more speakers signed up, the
amount of time allocated will be two minutes.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yes. Mayor Siddiqui.

Individuals are not permitted to allocate the
remainder of their time to others. I ask that you please
state your name and address for the record and the item on
the agenda that you are speaking on. And I have Councillor

Zondervan's hand up, but we can't hear him, but he has
texted me, uh, and stated he had to like to entertain a
motion to allow public comment on late policy orders, so.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Discussion.

We can discuss that.

Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Um, thank you. Um, this

is a-- a-- a little bit of a tough one up. Uh, often I
typically do not vote to do that. I think late policy
orders by not being on the agenda, um, skews the public
comment because the grant-- the larger number of the public
don't know that that it's going to be discussed.
Um, and so what tends to happen sometimes is that one
side of a particular policy order will call in because
they've been told that this is gonna be amended and a lot-they'll be allowed to participate, but it really isn't very
transparent and opens it up to the-- the entire community
who might have a different opinion.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

I don't know which policy order, uh, Councillor
Zondervan is talking about, but in principle, um, I-- I
have trouble with this because it-- it-- it's not, uh,
there's a lot of people in the public who aren't gonna know
4
Packet Pg. 1567

10

that this is even being discussed and won't have that
opportunity. So I will be voting no.
We'll go to Vice Mayor Mallon.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. I believe that the two lay policy order, uh,
items that are being referenced by Councillor Zondervan are
both in direct response to the Supreme Court, uh, case
ruling, uh, on Friday overturning Roe v. Wade. And I know
that we are as a community, devastated by this news and
placed two items, emergency items on the agenda for this
evening that I hope our colleagues can, um, overlook our
past practice to not allow public comment, um, for late
policy orders for the many reasons that Councillor McGovern
enumerated. However, I do think in light of the Supreme
Court ruling on Friday, this might be a-- a time where we
would overlook that past practice and, um, allow members of
the public to speak on this important issue this evening.
Thank you, Madam. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Any other discussion before we

take this vote? Hearing none, we'll go-COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

I'll just-- I'll just

say in light of now knowing full well what this is about, I
5

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. So we will do a roll

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Uh, yes. Councillor Simmons,

state your point.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Uh, I-- I'm sorry. I

hear. Do we-- do we vote to bring the late or orders
forward and-- and so people can speak or do we-- I didn't
hear it. I voted yes hoping that that-MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

--what it was, but I

wasn't sure. I just didn't hear.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons. Council

Simmons, I'll clarify. So the-- the vote was to allow
public comment on the late orders.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Okay. So my point of

order is do we have to vote to bring them forward so that
they're actually before us so people can speak to them?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I'm looking to--

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

I thought we had to

said the-- the, uh, audio is terrible tonight, so I didn't

make an order because it-- because usually vote to bring a

them. So if I-- I may be wrong, so I just want to be sure
that you did receive the late order.

Um, point- point of

order, Madam Mayor.
Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Uh, through you. I believe we voted to suspend the
rules to allow public comment on the two policy orders. Um,
but I don't think we need to vote to bring them before us
yet.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, the-- Clerk Crane, uh,

agrees with that assessment. So we can-- we don't have to
have them before us. So, Councillor Simmons, I don't know
if you're talking to me 'cause you're muted.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Great.

Thank you. Okay. First person

we have is Eric Grubba, followed by Aleen Dixon.
PUBLIC COMMENT
Carolyn Lichtenstein, address not provided, spoke on
POR Number 125. Spoke about the inequality between girls'

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

softball and boys' baseball leagues in POR 2022, number
125, the Park Amenities report. Carolyn plays in the girls'
minor softball league and mentioned that their infield has
gravel instead of dirt or sand, which makes it difficult to
8
Packet Pg. 1571

10

slide safely. Additionally, their games have ended early
due to a lack of lights on the field, and the benches are
falling apart, causing injuries to players. Carolyn asked

their field assessments.
James Selvitella, 73 Plymouth Street, spoke on Policy
1. He spoke about the need for upgrades in girls' softball
fields under Policy 1. He stated that the facilities are
severely outdated and have been long overlooked, with
issues such as bad drainage and rough infields with rocks
causing safety concerns. He also mentioned the worn-out
bleachers and benches that have only been updated once
since they were considered state-of-the-art 30 years ago.
James explained how the situation is affecting the
girls' teams, with cancellations and playing in a rush to
finish before it becomes too dark. He expressed curiosity
about the city's plans for Danny Heat, the long-term plan
for girls' softball, and other options if draining issues

persist. James acknowledged the city's resources and the
need to prioritize girls' softball.
Ania Queen, Norfolk Street, spoke on Policy Order
Number 125. She is softball player for Cambridge Girls

Packet Pg. 1572

10

Softball, spoke about the unequal treatment of softball and
baseball fields. She highlighted that baseball fields
receive crews to clean them up when they get muddy or

resulting in game cancellations.
Additionally, baseball fields have better dugouts,
benches, fences, and lights for night games, whereas
softball fields lack these amenities. Ania also mentioned
that the city council only approved the one good softball
field after a girl presented the issue. Also, urged the
council to recognize the problems with softball fields and
take action to address them.
Anna Laura Chavez, 147 Cushing Street, spoke on Policy
Order Number 125. She is a 10-year-old Cambridge tiger
softball player, spoke about the need for better softball
fields. She explained that the fields are not being
maintained fairly compared to baseball fields, which can be
dangerous. For instance, the fields lack safety fences and

frozen, whereas softball fields are left in poor condition,

the ball has nearly hit parents and siblings in the
bleachers. The unfairness makes Anna and her teammates feel
undervalued, and they want to raise awareness towards the
softball field's conditions. They hope that the city will
10
Packet Pg. 1573

10

support equality between baseball and softball fields.
Sophia Summerskill, 9 Greenough Ave, spoke on Policy
Order Number 125. A fourth-grader wrote a letter stating

treated equally. After a rainy day, the people who work on
the fields cleaned up the boys' fields, but not the girls'
fields. Sophia thinks that the dugouts should be improved
and broken lights could be added to the fields.
The games of softball go late, and they cannot slide
because of the infield, which is covered with gravel near
the pitching mounds, and there are ditches that can cause
injuries. Moreover, they do not have batting cages, and the
foul lines at their fields are only crisp at the All-Star
game. Sophia requests the renovation of their fields to
avoid inequalities between baseball and softball fields.
Nudia Kumar Vergu, address not provided, spoke on
Policy Order Number 125. A fourth-grade Cambridge tiger
softball player is advocating for improvements to the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

that the softball fields and baseball fields are not

Cambridge softball fields. The player wants dugout covers
and foul nets to prevent injuries to players and
spectators. She also wants benches that are not falling
apart, as one bench is made of wood and has splinters.
11

Finally, she wants closer bathroom facilities. The player
believes these changes are simple and necessary to improve
the safety and quality of the softball fields in Cambridge.

Order Number 125. He is a coach with the girls' softball
league since its beginning in 1995, believes that gender
makes a difference with softball and baseball fields. The
issue is not about field improvements at Dana Heat, but
rather the need to level the playing field to ensure that
girls' fields are valued by the city as much as the boys.
When the league began, there were different fields
throughout the city, but those fields were not maintained.
Sarah Breen presented a petition to the city, arguing that
the boys had 10 exclusive fields while the girls had none,
leading to the assignment of Dana Heat three for girls'
softball. However, over time, it was realized that the
girls' field was isolated, with no visibility from the
road, and restrooms and parking lots were far away. Blacken

Steven McCauliffe, 27th Inman Ave, spoke on Policy

Field was used by the girls for over 20 years without a
bench to sit on, let alone dugout grass and bathrooms.
Steven suggests that the girls should have one of the
Glock and fields to call their own, and if that's not
12
Packet Pg. 1575

10

enough, they could have secondary fields at DHE or build
two new fields at the DHE lower soccer field adjacent to
New Street. Steven's daughter, who played in the league,

it's still a man's world. Steven implores the city to
eliminate discrimination against the softball girls of
Cambridge and make them feel embraced just as much as the
boys.
Anthony Gallucci, address not provided, spoke on
Policy Order Number 125. He thanks the counselors and the
vice mayor for filing a motion to discuss the state of
youth sports in the city. He has been involved in youth
sports for 30 years and believes that there is a shortage
of playing fields and capacity across the city. He mentions
that the West Little League was unhappy about being reduced
to two fields at Glacken from three at Tobin. He feels that
the Danny [Dhe] facility has gotten old and needs a major
reinvestment.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

felt discriminated against and called out the fact that

The facility needs better drainage, lights, and an
overall facelift. He suggests adding a turf field at the
top of the stairs and conducting a major study to determine
what a reinvestment in Danny Dhe would look like. He
13
Packet Pg. 1576

10

believes that the girls' softball team should be involved
in the committee for the changing facility to give them a
voice. He also feels that all athletics should be

softball.
Jeff Lowenberg, address not provided, spoke on City
Manager Agenda Item Number 12. He is a Senior Vice
President for development at Boston Properties, spoke on
city manager's Agenda item number 12, the request to modify
two existing open space covenants on either side of the
blue garage in Kendall Square. The modification of these
covenants was required for the proposal to relocate the
Eversource substation.
The construction of the substation will lead to an
expanded central plaza, approximately 4,700 square feet
larger than the open space being replaced. The MXD district
already has more than double the required amount of
publicly dedicated open space. The vote represents the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

celebrated, but especially female athletics and girls'

final step in a lengthy and complex process initiated by
city manager DePasquale nearly three years ago. Many city
departments, the city council, planning board, and
Cambridge redevelopment authority provided support for the
14
Packet Pg. 1577

10

collaboration between Boston Properties, Alexandria real
estate, and Eversource. The collaboration was encouraged
and supported by local neighborhoods, especially the Lyndon

planning team.
Kit Haynes, 10 Hazel Street, spoke on the late order
that was put forward to ban limited services pregnancy
centers. She expressed concern over a recent decision by
the Supreme Court that allows states to prosecute
individuals who seek medical care in Cambridge, even if
they cross state borders. She highlighted the potential
danger of crisis pregnancy centers, which masquerade as
healthcare facilities but offer invasive procedures without
providing abortion or contraceptive services.
Haynes explained that these centers often lie to
people seeking abortion and provide misinformation about
the health effects of abortion. While there are currently
no such centers in Cambridge, she warned that people in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Park Neighborhood Association and the East Cambridge

Cambridge could still be directed to nearby facilities.
Haynes urged for the passing of an order to prevent these
centers from operating in Cambridge and to ensure that
people seeking information about healthcare are not misled.
15
Packet Pg. 1578

10

She emphasized the responsibility to protect individuals
seeking healthcare and prevent misinformation.
Tom Evans, address not provided, spoke on City
Manager's Agenda Number 12. He thanks the city manager
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Louis DePasquale for his service to the city of Cambridge.
They then go on to discuss a specific policy item, namely
the proposal to move the Eversource substation from its
current location in the East Cambridge neighborhood to
Kendall Square. This proposal requires the modification of
a pair of open space covenants in the Kendall Square Urban
Redevelopment project area.
The speaker notes that the covenants are focused on
providing quality open space in Kendall Square and regrets
the temporary loss of park space that will be required for
the construction of the electrical substation and the
development of new housing and commercial space. However,
they argue that these modifications are necessary for the
project to move forward, and that the public areas of open
space in Kendall Square will be extensively improved as a
result, including the addition of open spaces on top of the
substation and investments in neighboring parks. Finally,
the speaker recommends that the covenant modifications be
16

Packet Pg. 1579

10

approved so that the project can proceed.
Catherine Warn, address not provided, spoke on City
Manager's Agenda Number 12. Shehanks four public servants

Cambridge, including Louis DePasquale, who is the city
manager. She notes that DePasquale has done an amazing job
and that there is no better way to send him off than with a
series of affirmative votes on city manager's agenda item
number 12. Warn is the chair of the redevelopment
authority, which recently heard from Tom Evans, the
executive director.
She discusses the plan that DePasquale identified to
save the East Cambridge environment from a field of
electric transformers, which involves building an electric
substation entirely underground, 150 feet underground. The
agenda items before the council tonight are one piece of
that puzzle, and they involve reconfiguring existing
easements and covenants to fit the new open space that will

who are concluding their careers with the city of

be created with the development. The new easements and
covenants before the council actually increase the area of
open space created, and the duration of the easements is
increased by nearly 50 years. Warn argues that there is no
17
Packet Pg. 1580

10

better sendoff for DePasquale than the passage of these
modifications tonight.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street. She expressed

lack of transparency in the city council's late policy
orders. She then discussed the proposed relocation of the
Eversource substation from Focusing Street to Kendall
Square. Heather argued that the substation was necessary
because of the energy consumption of Kendall Square, which
has negative effects on the neighborhood.
She expressed disappointment that parks would have to
be temporarily closed for the substation's construction but
believed that the process should not be diminished. Heather
noted that few people had participated in meetings about
park design and called for a more transparent and inclusive
process that encourages public involvement.
Santos Caskio, address not provided, spoke on policy
order regarding the 105 Windsor Street Building. He

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

concerns about the relocation of polling places and the

expressed support for continuing to allocate a building for
social services and adult family and teen enrichment in the
deport neighborhood, which is one of the poorest
neighborhoods in Cambridge. He suggested that the building

10

should have multi-use to have an economic impact on the
neighborhood and to provide open spaces for residents to
use.

affordable space in Cambridge, and using the building for
social services could help further their mission to serve
marginalized neighborhoods. Santos requested that the
building be allocated towards social services, adult and
family enrichment, and creating an economic impact in the
deport neighborhood.
Lee Ferris, address not provided, poke on policy order
regarding the 105 Wind Street Building. She Is a member of
the Port Organizing Group, which held community meetings to
discuss the future use of 105 Windsor Street. Over 50
people attended these meetings and called for a multi-use
building that could serve as a center for community
building and port activities, including meeting spaces,
workspaces, classrooms, a library, an art gallery, music

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Many social service organizations struggle to find

practice rooms, an industrial quality kitchen, and a museum
documenting the history of the port.
Lee emphasizes that there was no mention of city
offices in the building during the community meetings. Lee

Packet Pg. 1582

requests that the city remove the possible use of city
offices from the building and encourages a full community
process on the use of 105 Windsor Street. Lastly, she

centers.
Robert Armand, 288 Washington Street, spoke on Order
105 Windsor. He a lifelong resident of Cambridge, spoke in
favor of utilizing the 105 Windsor Street building as a
multi-use space for local community organizations. He
suggested using the space as a makerspace with 3D printers,
a computer lab, and technology workshops, as well as
holding agricultural workshops to teach the community about
growing food.
Robert emphasized the need for access to healthy food,
particularly in the poor neighborhoods of the city, such as
the Port neighborhood. He suggested that the space could be
used for upliftment, empowerment, and education,
particularly for the disadvantaged members of the community

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

expresses support for the late policy order on crisis

living in nearby public housing projects. Robert also
supported the idea of having a kitchen in the building, as
suggested by another speaker, and emphasized the importance
of having a multi-use space that could benefit families. He

thanked the city council for their time and expressed his
support for the community's involvement in the use of the
105 Windsor Street building.

Windsor Street. He a lifelong resident of Cambridge, spoke
on behalf of utilizing 105 Windsor Street as a multipurpose
building. He suggested turning the building into an arts
center as he believes that the city is losing its artistry
due to developers taking over such spaces. Jeff highlighted
that the development in the city is not sustainable for
people who don't have the income to pay the median rent or
don't have Section 8.
He believes that people at the bottom are not being
considered anymore, which is sad to see, as they are the
ones who built the city and represent its culture. Jeff
personally knows people who were pushed out of the city and
couldn't finish high school due to the unaffordable rent.
He requested the city council to consider the people at the

regarding the building or any other developments in the
city.

129. She spoke about the Harvard Square Advisory Committee
and was pleased to see that the Neighborhood Association
was a part of it. However, she noticed that the Harvard

committee and requested consideration to have
representation from the business association as the
businesses would be impacted by whatever decision is made.

facilities, and we heard some very moving testimony tonight

the Parks Department and Department of Public Works to

from some of the players, uh, of girls' softball.
The lack of lights make those early season games
really short. The benches we've heard are unsuitable. Uh,
there are no batting cages or covers on the dugouts to

protect them from sun, rain, or even foul ball. Uh, the
infield is rocky and they can't slide. We've heard that a
few times tonight. So there are definitely some short-term

our girls softball players.
Um, and just to-- for some edification for, um, some
of my colleagues who may not know Adam Corbi, the
Department of Human Services, has been working with the
girls softball leadership on creating an advisory council
that includes some female coaches and some of the impacted
girls softball players to discuss necessary changes to the
Dunhill fields to bring them up to par. But during that
conversation, um, you know, we know that there-- we need to
understand if there are more or other inequities on our
fields and their amenities.
So this policy order asked for a very quick report
from the Department of Human Services and the City Manager
to advise what fields have, what amenities and who they

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

and long-term changes that we can make to those fields for

serve. And we believe that this will tell us a fuller
picture of any other inequities we need to remediate. Um,
and I will also just say that I was very, uh, moved tonight
by the story that we heard from Steven, a public comment
25
Packet Pg. 1588

that his 32-year-old daughter, upon hearing that Glackin
was for the boys, her first reaction to say, well, the
girls always get the short into the sticks.

girls who are seeing leaders at the federal level fail
them, um, see that their local levelers-- local leaders
step forward and prioritize their needs and their worth.
Um, so I hope that our council, colleagues can join us in
this effort tonight to-- to really understand what fields
have what amenities and who they serve. And I hope to get
that report very quickly. I also wanted to say that the
mayor has been working very closely with some families, and
she asked to be added on to this. So I would like to
propose an amendment to ask to add, uh, Mayor Siddiqui on
as a co-sponsor. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

you, Madam Mayor. Uh, through you. Thank you to the Vice

you to all the young folks who have been circulating

10

petitions and, um, I've seen you at different events, uh,
over the last few weeks, and it's great to see you
participating, uh, in our city government and our city

Um, I-- I agree that, uh, you know, with the Vice
Mayor that there's a-- there's some specific issues around
girls softball, and then there's sort of broader issues
around fields that we're always sort of struggling with.
We-- our field are used really heavily and-- and-- and not
just by city youth sports, um, but there's a lot of private
organizations or, you know, permits that get given out. So
we-- we really have to take a look sort of across the board
at how-- how we're using these fields, uh, equitably.
Um, but certainly, you know, with -- with girls
softball, uh, in particular, um, you know, there are some
immediate fixes that I would hope, uh, would be in place by
next season. Um, you know, I-- I-- I'm-- I'm glad that
there's a committee being formed and-- and we need to sort

of get together and put heads together to figure out what
needs to be done and-- and whatnot.
But I-- I-- I just-- my message to the city is to
please treat this with urgency. Getting lights put in is
27

10

not something that happens in a week. It takes time. And we
need to make sure that whatever renovations we're doing to
girls softball are done in time so that when they come

high quality fields that they deserve. So, um, glad to see
this moving and, uh, let's keep it on the fast track. Thank
you, Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone, before I

go to you, I'm going to go to Councillor Toner as he was,

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Thank, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Just very briefly, I want to, uh, uh, uh, thank the
young ladies and the parents, uh, who came out here
tonight. And I want to thank Mr. McCullough for being such
a great advocate. Uh, my daughter, uh, Grace, who's now 23,
was a ruby red and, uh, she greatly enjoyed playing with
Mr. McCauliffe, uh, softball, um, and continued on to hi-into high school.

back, uh, next spring, that they're coming back to, uh,

Um, I'll just point out that-- that my daughter,
Grace, actually wrote, uh, did a little study when she was
a senior, uh, in high school, pointing out that there are,
you know, some disparities and, uh, uh, female sports in
28
Packet Pg. 1591

10

the city. And I don't think it's done intentionally. I
think it's a matter of awareness, and we need to do a
better job of, uh, making sure that we're taking care of

across the city to make sure that there's equitable fields
and resources for all the kids across the city. Thank you.
I yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Uh, as someone who played a lot of softball on Cambridge
lots when I was younger, um, the fields were not in great
condition, but they weren't gravel. And I-- I find that
just unthinkable. I believe Title IX says, uh, women's
sports. I don't think it specifies an age that it begins at
5th grade. Um, so 4th grade would be included, should be
equal. Um, the new fields that the team members referred to
for baseball are in incredible shape.
I've never played on a field in that condition, uh,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

all of our young people, uh, male and female, but also

maybe in college. But, um, so this is a no-brainer. And,
um, I agree with my, uh, colleagues on everything they've
said. Uh, the Vice Mayor has suggested adding, uh, the
mayor. I would say the best route here is to make it
29
Packet Pg. 1592

10

unanimous and that we all support this equally. Thank you,
Madam Mayor. I yield,
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. Um, really want to support this, uh,
policy order. And also, you know, this serves as an
important reminder that really we are short on playing
fields as, um, Mr. Gallucci reminded us, and that we really
need to redouble our efforts to provide more laying spaces
for all of our residents. He also mentioned, um, the need
to-- to use turf instead of natural grass.
And, you know, that's a separate but related issue in
part because our fields have such high utilization that we
end up using turf because the grass can't take that kind of
beating. But there are real environmental concerns around
the use of artificial turf as well and-- and health
concerns. So, all of this points back to the need for more

open space. As Councillor Carlone always reminds us, and
the need for some of those, uh, open spaces to be sports
playing fields.
I also don't understand why these sports are even
30
Packet Pg. 1593

10

gendered why girls are playing softball and boys are
playing baseball when both sports can be played by all
genders. And so I would hope that in addition to looking at

social infrastructure and make sure that we improve our
equity in terms of who can participate in what sports.
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

brief. I agree. Every one of us should be on it. I've
played on those fields and they were in not great shape and
that was 15 or 20 years ago. When my softball team was out
there, it's like, what is going on in this-- in this city?
Right? You all know that I'm looking at these amazing
players right here, and I wish I'd started when I was your
age, but Title IX didn't come in until I was in high
school. And there was no softball league in the city I was
in.

it depends on how you define federal funds. It mostly apply

powerhouse for female athletes. And it's pretty ironic that

know that. I'm really glad my college brought this forward
and that you've come forward and ad-- and advocated, and
nobody should have had to do that.
I think in addition to what is laid out in this policy
order, what we also heard is it wasn't just the, uh, the
equipment that's there, the fields, it's also the upkeep
and how it is and how quickly people respond. Because what
we heard is there were two fields and two different
reactions, right? So let's make sure it's not just the
equipment and that we're-- we're making sure that that's in
better shape, but that also, we understand how it is that
decisions get made about how quickly fields get turned
around and be able to be used, especially if it's a playoff
game.

Um, then you've-- you've prepared all the time you've
gotten there. And if you can't play, it is just not a-- a
good feeling. So-- and we all know also, this is part of
our commitment to sports are critical to health. It's
32
Packet Pg. 1595

10

really important if we're gonna send the message that we
want people to be doing sports, we need to make sure that
they all have the-- an equitable opportunity to do it. And

let's start with this.
Let's get moving and let's make sure that we do more
citywide to ensure that there's an availability of, um,
fields for everyone. So yes, I think the whole council
should be added. I'm-- I'm very saddened people had to come
here, and I'm really thrilled that they did come here in
order to advocate and that some of my colleagues brought
this forward.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Simmons and then Councillor Azeem.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Mayor. I actually had taken my hand down, uh, but now that

extraordinary, uh, athlete playing tennis, softball, and
basketball. She had the height she didn't pass on. Uh, I'm
pleased to see, uh, that we are giving due care to our-our fields. And I thank the makers of this motion. There's
33
Packet Pg. 1596

10

been a lot of discussion about the disparity of the uses of
the fields, uh, by women, although I don't see it in the
policy order. Um, but seeing that, that seems to be what we

In addition, um, I hope and I maybe bring-- I'll bring
a policy order to this, uh, to-- to address this. You know,
it's not only is the field important, it's what the field
is called. And I believe, and I talked to, uh, the woman
that owns Patty's, Ms. Ruth, about this, is that how many
fields that our young women play on that are not named
after women at all. And so I'm really pleased to see, uh,
that we're paying attention to our-- our fields. That we
make sure that our-- our children are treated in a manner
that they-- they deserve and we treat them respectfully by
having them feel that they are in good shape. So I-- I will
certainly, uh, support this field. And maybe who's-- who's
to say maybe I'll join the softball team. I yield.

Officer, Derrick Neal is joining us online. We'll be able
to address any questions after. Since our last update,
Middlesex County has moved into the low COVID-19 community
transmission level, and Cambridge has moved down into the
median community transmission level.
We are pleased to see our seven-day moving average
continuous sustained downward trends and our vaccinating
rates continuing to increase. As of our last report from
the Commonwealth, 94% of chemo regimens have at least one
dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Seventy-seven are fully
vaccinated and 50% have a booster shot. With the
announcement that the COVID-19 vaccine is now available to
those ages six months and up, I expect our vaccination
numbers will continue to increase in the coming months.

the first became available, the city continues to help make

I am proud of the partnership between city staff and
partner organizations over the past three years that have

residents for testing and vaccinations, especially one at
the Cambridge side, Trinity Properties. St. John's Church,
Cambridge Housing Authority and St. Paul's AME for
providing convenient locations for our testing program. Our
partnerships with public health professionals, business
association, community partners, and universities have
helped us ensure that we supported and protected the health
and safety of our community.
While we've had that much success, we must remember
the 166 presidents that we have lost their lives to COVID19. Over the past two years, the city has launched and

that they're surging. Is there anything we should be aware

of that's either in the work so that we should, uh, know
that we'll be eventually communicated? 'Cause this-- the

whether there's any update on that.

Sure. I'll be happy to

turn it over to Derrick, but I think the good news is at
this point, our numbers are going down. They're going down
dramatically. And we'll take the necessary precautions
moving forward, I'm sure as and if we need this, I know
especially with the fire department, giving them the
opportunity to just take your breath. We'll have them back
in line. But I know Derrick and the public health
department and as side have been taking a look at what's

ought to add anything.

Sure. Be--

in-- in-- in our community. I believe the last was a 100

before I turn-- good evening. And, uh, first of all, Louis,
thanks for your-- all of your leadership and, uh,
everything that you've done for me during my transitional
period. I-- I'm gonna miss, uh, working with you. Uh, I
47
Packet Pg. 1610

10

certainly wish you well in the next, uh, chapter in your
life. So have fun.
Thank you.

CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK NEAL:

Uh, through

you, uh, Madam Mayor, uh, Counselor-- Councillor Nolan. Um,
we're really focusing our attention at this time on, uh,
encouraging that children be vaccinated. Uh, and we're
encouraging them to-- to go to their local, um,
pediatricians. But, uh, what we feel like we're dealing
with at this point is, uh, still a level of vaccine
hesitancy that parents are experiencing and, uh, the-- the
resistance to take their-- their children to, um, become-to-- to-- to be vaccinated. So that's where we're really
surrounding our attention that at this time, is really
health promotion and making sure that we educate
individuals because that's the greatest challenge that
we're having now.
As Louis stated, uh, we feel like our numbers are

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

plateauing. The-- the data is, uh, demonstrating that to
us. So, um, I-- I do want to turn this over at this time
to, uh, Dr. Lisa Dobberteen. And, uh, she may want to, uh,
bring Anna Kaplan our epidemiologist into the conversation.

Thank you.
DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN:

Through-- through you, Madam

Mayor. And, uh, thank you, Councillor Nolan. Um, I think we

BA.4 and BA.5, which are on the heels of, uh, our current
variant. Um, we do know that staying vaccinated and being
up-to-date with your vaccinations, including boosters, to
raise everybody's level of antibody protection is the best
way to, um, protect oneself against these variants.
So we're watching it carefully. We don't, at the
moment, foresee any changes in any of our recommendations,
but we are-- we are ever vigilant. Uh, I'll let Ms. Kaplan,
uh, add anything that she would like. Um, and I'd also send
my warm congratulations to Mr. DePasquale on his
retirement.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:
DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN:

Thank you.

Um, we're-- we're really happy

for you and it's been a pleasure working with you, sir.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:
DR. ADDISON KAPLAN:

don't know yet enough about the next wave of variance, the

Thank you.

Um, good evening. Um, Madam

Mayor, uh, through you to Councillor Nolan. Um, yes,
echoing, um, what Dr. Lisa has shared and, uh, that the
49
Packet Pg. 1612

10

strategies remain the same, even if the, uh, variant that's
more transmissible, uh, or more severe should emerge.
Um, the only addition I would make is that there are

Pfizer about bivalent, uh, vaccines for the fall, which
should cover or,--or ideally will cover, um, and improve
the immunity for the new variants. Um, this is not too
dissimilar from our flu vaccines, which are quadrivalent.
They cover four strains and they're different every year.
So it seems that that's the direction things are
going, although of course, we're watching and learning and,
and looking to the regulatory bodies for-- for our next
instructions. Um, so that's-- that's what we'll do next.
And also just want to echo congratulations on your
retirement. Um, we hope to, to see you maybe in public
comment with some COVID questions for us. So have-- have a
lovely, um, time resting and we'll see you soon. Thank you.

some, uh, promising, um, new data from both Moderna and

Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to the City Manager and the staff. Thank
you for that update. Um, so my-- my understanding is that
50
Packet Pg. 1613

10

the walk-in testing is going away, but we're keeping the
appointment only seven days a week testing. So if that's
correct, what's the lead time currently for getting an

CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor, there really is none. And I recently went, uh, and I
looked and by the time I got there it was appointments. So
that's one of the reasons we're very comfortable with that,
that we have plenty of open appointments. And I would say
most people will certainly get it on the day. But like I
said, I was able to get it probably a half hour by the-- it
took me longer to get there than the appointment was
available. So we have plenty of appointments opening and
that's why we're comfortable at this time going with that
arrangement. And I'm sure if that changes in the future, I
know Fire will be ready to come back and our sites will-can come back up again.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

appointment?

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. Thanks for that-- that response and
thanks for providing that service. Um, and then my second
question is around rapid tests. Um, so I know that each,
51
Packet Pg. 1614

10

uh, household can order, I believe eight, uh, test kits
from the federal government, but that still leaves out
unhoused individuals and-- and other people who might not

we're doing to-- to help make sure that people have access
to, to rapid testing kits?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Uh, yes. We have-- we

have rapid tests on site. We have been working with many of
the areas that work with our in-house to make sure they're
made available. I know the public health department is
working that, but I don't know if Derrick Neal want to add
anything. But certainly, making tests available is
something they were comfortable with and we continue to do
it and we'll continue to offer.
CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK NEAL:

Also,

Louis, I'll add that, uh, we do have the outreach team that
the city of Cambridge is-- is funding. And, uh, this is a-a data-driven team. When we identify those areas, uh, that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

have access to that service. Um, so is-- is there anything

have, um, maybe a spike, uh, in the, uh, COVID numbers of
our particular neighborhood in Cambridge, uh, we use, uh,
uh, our wastewater data to target those areas for outreach.
And we do have an allotment of, uh, those tests, um, in
52
Packet Pg. 1615

10

storage that, uh, we can, uh, readily de uh, distribute to
these communities.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And I know that, uh, the city

about 43,000 rapid tests from the state. And I think
similar to what we did last time, you know, there's going
to be a distribution effort for those tests, but I'm not
sure if you received them already or not. And I think Nancy
at the public health department is coordinating all that.
But I think there'll be a lot of rapid tests to go around.
CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK NEAL:

That's

correct, Madam Mayor.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Great. Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you. Thanks for those responses. And
also, uh, a reminder for everyone on the Zoom to stay on
mute. Thank you.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you.

Any other questions from the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

received about four-- is-- or is-- or is going to receive

city council about COVID?
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor.

Yes. Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Oh, thank you, Madam

53
Packet Pg. 1616

10

Mayor. Uh, a couple of things. First of to you to Mr.
DePasquale, uh, thank you for your, uh, report and I will
certainly miss you giving us the updates on COVID with your

have a good time in retirement. I don't know how you're
gonna retire 'cause you know so much and done so much.
People are gonna just, you know, have you on speed dial to
figure stuff out.
So you might want to change your phone number if you
really want to retire. But I just want to say, relative to
COVID and what we were able to do, the city council-- the
mayor's office with the city council, but exceedingly
through your office, what we did was unparalleled, in my
opinion, uh, in terms of taking care of our citizens during
COVID. And I wanted to go on the record personally and say
thank for that. One question I do have through you, um, to
Chief Neil.
Uh, I know that we are changing our-- our testing and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

excellent team that you've put together. Uh, everyone says

I guess my biggest concern remains the same. Um, it's
really how we reach out to the seniors. You know, the more
we move online, the harder it is for them. It's not the
seniors that live in, um, senior housing, because I think
54
Packet Pg. 1617

10

CJ has done a-- a very good job above making sure that they
get the services. It's our seniors that live on their own
independently. And we do want people to age in place. We

And so I'm just curious how we are going to make sure
that those seniors that, again, that live in their-- their
own homes live independently, will continue to have access,
particularly those that are not, um, all that up on, um,
technology. That's the first question. The second question
is, uh, you spoke about having, um, the-- a supply of tests
that you'll be giving out.
I just want to remind us, I don't think we forget, but
it's worth saying, the interfaith community has reached out
on several occasions asking for PP-- PPE and tests. I hope
that we are going to continue to reach back to them about
having these at their houses of worship, the interface
meeting spaces, uh, at the ready so that people have access
to them. So those are my two questions, Manager.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

recommend it.

Through you, Madam

Mayor. And then I'll turn it over to Derrick in a second.
Uh, the good news with CIC is it's just a phone call. It's
a phone call to let them know when is appointment
55
Packet Pg. 1618

10

available. And I can tell you I took my last test with them
and they-- it's a great run set up. They couldn't have been
more pleasant.

to help do the work that our Fire Department and health
department did such an amazing job with. Uh, we continue to
work with the faith community on mask. I know Dean has been
involved in that, and we certainly will continue to do
that. And, uh, Derrick, I don't know if there's anything
else, but the Housing Authority has been a great partner in
terms of making sure that we had got vaccines and sites
there. So I'll turn it over to Derrick.
CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK NEAL:

Yes. Uh, to

expand on that, uh, Louis, um, we, Richard Harding is, uh,
co-- co-leads our outreach team. And again, we specifically
char, uh, target those marginalized communities, those
individuals who may not only be in congregate settings, but
in settings where they may have limited mobility in terms

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

So I'm very comfortable turning them over for now, uh,

of not having the-- the-- the-- the support to-- to be
mobile within our communities.
So we make sure that we keep those communities close
in order to monitor their health, safety, and wellbeing.
56
Packet Pg. 1619

10

Uh, I will, you know, share with you that, you know, I-- I
live, uh, uh, 95 Foster Street because it's my address.
And, uh, not far from, uh, Fresh Pond. We can't overlook

that have, uh, free testing as well. We have to make sure
that we're taking advantage of everything outside of CIC,
uh, the things that our community offers when it comes to
testing resources.
Uh, the unfortunate part about, uh, the, uh, rapid
tests is that we are-- we're unable to ca-- uh, capture
that data. Uh, so it doesn't really give us true indicators
of where we're at with regards to the disease. But, um, we
can't forget the fact that we're still in the midst of a
pandemic. And although the numbers are low, uh, we've seen
this movie before and we know that they can, uh, readily go
back up.
Uh, Cambridge is a little higher than the rest of the
state, the rest of Middlesex County, because we have a

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the fact that we have, uh, what I, we call the CVSs, uh,

robust, uh, we have robust resources with regards to the
testing that we can provide within our community. So we're
always gonna be ahead of the curve. It's gonna seem like we
have a little bit more disease in our community, but we
57
Packet Pg. 1620

10

have significant testing resources. So I'm hope-- I hope
that I'm addressing your, uh, questions, uh,
Councillorwoman Simmons.
Council Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to Chief Neal. Uh, yes, you have. And thank you
for reminding me about CVS. Again, the-- the seniors for
the most part are always looking to us. They-- it's good to
know that CVS does this. And I said, remind the seniors
that I work with, um, that that's available, and I'm happy
to hear that you-- you can do CIC on the phone.
The last time, and this was a little over a week ago,
when I sent, um, a senior, they were asked to do it by
computer and I told them, call back and insist that you do
it. So I didn't know it was the-- the standard. So that's
good because I'm just afraid that's-- if it's hard for
seniors, they won't-- they won't do it. They'll get
deterred. So, uh, I'm glad that we're making as many

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

opportunities as possible. I'll certainly keep pushing out
the resources to the group of seniors I work with. And-and, uh, I'll end with this, uh, Chief Neal, you had said,
well, when we were doing our pro-- the panel not too long
58
Packet Pg. 1621

10

ago, uh, we might be finished with COVID.
COVID is not finished with us. And I have to tell you,
I have used that many, many times and it really helps drive

hand washing and all those other preventative measure
measures that keep us all safe. So I just wanted to say
thank you for giving me that quote. I've used it and I do
make sure everyone knows I've got it from you. It was an
original, so thank you for that information. Madam Chair, I
yield.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Council Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. I want to change the tone just for a second and say
thank you for really investing in this and the Cambridge
Health Alliance of taking it very seriously early on and
perhaps being conservative at times when other people
thought it wasn't necessary. Uh, however it turned out to
be necessary and, uh, to both the alliance and the city for

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

home to people the idea of keeping mask and, you know, go

really doing an outstanding job. So thank you for that
leadership, um, both you and to Derrick. Thank you.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor.

Any other COVID-19 related
59
Packet Pg. 1622

10

questions? One thing I wanted to just, uh, uh, follow up on
was around the vaccines for, uh, children. I had
corresponded with you, Director, uh, Neal. And the response

as the weeks go on, if there could be some more social
media, just more information from the health department on
what's happening with the vaccines and that you're saying
go to your pedia-- pediatrician first.
You know, I do think there is a desire to have some
kind of clinic at some point before the school year starts.
Um, so that's just something that I think I keep getting,
uh, emails about. Um, and something I think, I'm sure a lot
of school, preschool, a lot of different parent, you know,
different age groups, uh, parents are interested in. I
think those who kind of know where to go, they're making
the calls and have easily been able to find, uh, that
resource. But for some, I think it's a little bit harder.
So any outreach for that throughout the summer would be

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

you sent me was really helpful. I think if at all possible,

important. Director Neal.
CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DERRICK NEAL:

Yeah.

Before I-- thank you, Madam Mayor. Before I pass this on to
Dr. Dourine, I-- I do want to let you know that even though
60
Packet Pg. 1623

10

health promotion and-- and being able to educate people in
terms of the resources that they can draw down on in terms
of, uh, getting their children, uh, vaccinated, uh, we are

the month of July in a ramp up to-- to back the school. But
I'll let Dr. Dobberteen, our resident pediatrician, uh,
address that, uh, directly.
DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN:

Thank you, Derrick. And through

you, Madam Mayor. Um, one of the efforts that we intend to
put into place, uh, quite rapidly is a series of forums for
giving parents the opportunity to ask questions and
spreading it out throughout the city in a ver-- variety of
forums, um, different areas, different locations with
different speakers, because we think it's important for
parents to get their questions answered.
Remember that in the first two years of children's
lives, they have at least, um, nine to 12 visits with their
pediatrician. So they're-- they're, uh, knocking on our

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

still visiting the prospect of having something later in

doors frequently. And those will be nice opportunities to
get both their routine childhood vaccinations along with
the COVID vaccination, which can be given in concert. We
are looking at introducing the opportunity for pediatric
61
Packet Pg. 1624

10

vaccines for the youngest children's six months to four
years at our weekly Wednesday clinic at Windsor Street.
We're not quite ready to ramp that up this moment, but

other opportunities later in the summer. And certainly by
the time it's time for flu clinics to roll around, those
will be full scale flu and COVID vaccination clinics for
all ages.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Great. Thank you so much. So I

think that's all the questions for the COVID-19 update.
Thank you for the update, uh, everyone. And we can go ahead
and do a roll call on placing this on file.

Agenda Item Number 2, a communication transmitted from

appointments and reappointments. So the following persons
as members of the Cambridge Health Alliance Board of
Trustees. Councillor Zondervan, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to the City Manager, and these are
certainly great appointments. I-- I have a question about
the CHA and particularly the, the mental health services,
which, um, were described in a recent-- recent article in-in Cambridge Day regarding, uh, the victims of violence
program, that there's some real challenges with that-- with
that program that people are leaving rather than violate
their own moral and ethical standards as stated in the
article.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan, how does

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Louis DePasquale, City Manager, relative to new

this relate to the appointments? Can you bring it back to
the appointments?
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

I-- I'm about to get

there. And that, um, two other groups made, uh,
63
Packet Pg. 1626

10

representing CHA mental health clinicians, uh, made similar
assertions last year in a letter to the Alliance Board of
Trustees saying that more than a third of mental health

question is, how do we expect the board of trustees in
particular, uh, some of these new appointments to-- to help
address some of these challenges that we're seeing when we- we need these mental health services more than ever?
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan, I think

this is beyond-- that question's beyond the scope of what's
before us, which is the reappointments. I think it's-that's a more of a policy board discussion. Uh, so I'm not- I don't think-COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Madam Mayor.

--City Manager will be able to

answer that.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

I might be able to.

Councillor McGovern?

staff had left resulting in long waits for treatment. So my

Yeah. We-- thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you. We have been in the process of
trying to get a Human Services committee meeting scheduled
on the state of mental health services in Cambridge, in
64
Packet Pg. 1627

10

which the Cambridge Health Alliance would be, uh, the main
presenters of what services they're providing, not
providing what has happened. We-- we had it scheduled,

looking to do it again.
Um, so if that helps Councillor, uh, Councillor
Zondervan that is coming. We're sort of debating now. Do
you do it over the summer when few people are around, or do
you wait till September when there's more people? But we
can, uh, I'm happy to talk to him about that, but that is
coming down the pike at some point.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank- thank you,

Madam Mayor. Through you to, uh, Councillor McGovern. I-- I
do appreciate that, um, response. But I would like to
understand from the manager how these appointments in
particular, these are-- they're two new appointments being
made. They're not all reappointments. How they're planning
to address this or-- or how his choices for who to appoint

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

there was a conflict, it had to be canceled, and now we're

are affected by-- by some of these challenges that we're
seeing?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor, I guess all I would say is this goes true to Board
65
Packet Pg. 1628

10

of Governance Nominating Committee. Paula Paris is the
chair of that. Uh, they tell me who they're appointing. I
look at the two appointments. I think they're highly

answers they get during that process I am not involved.
And so that's fairly all I can say. I do believe,
though, the last time this came up, Dr. Sayah sent the
response to the council a year ago, and I may be wrong, and
I'm sure if there was a request to ask him to respond
again, he'd be happy to send another response to address
those concerns.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Agenda Item Number 6, a communication transmitted from Lous
DePasquale, City Manager, relative to awaiting report item
number 22-32 relative to an update on progress made in
regard to LGBTQ Plus Friendly Housing efforts. Councillor
Simmons, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Uh, I was very pleased to see this item before the
city council. Um, as many of you may-- may or may not know,
this discussion on LGBT Friendly Housing goes back. I want
to say I think he, uh, the City Manager puts in 2016, but
it actually goes back to 2008. Uh, Jeff Walker was working
on this with a young woman named Kate Thomas, who worked

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui - Yes

for Campus Elder Services.
And the idea behind, um, LGBTQI Plus housing was
primarily around seniors, and it was around the-- the need
to have the LGBTQQI Plus community, to the aging community
67
Packet Pg. 1630

10

to feel safe. Uh, as the LGBTQI community age, all of us
that were very proactive and progressive in-- in the 50s,
60s, 70s, 80s, 80s in particular, and much later in the

being able to live up our authentic lives.
And it's unfortunate. There's a great film that I hope
you have the chance to-- to see that speaks about where
these two men have lived their lives together and they-one goes-- is hospitalized and has to go to, um, nursing
care. And how he's afraid to acknowledge his partner or our
transgender community, women in particular, black women in
particular, not being able to live their authentic lives
because of fear of reprisals.
So I am just very, uh, pleased to see that we're
moving forward, that we have, uh, some, uh, some parameters
around what a timeline that look like and that we'd have
something before the city council, um, in the fall or early
winter of 2023. LGBTQI Plus lives really do depend on this

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

90s, um, find ourselves at retirement, being able to-- not

type of housing. And it speaks to having a-- a wonderful
positive quality of life for the community. When we started
this work, we were just LGBT and now we're QI Plus.
So I hope we don't add any more letters to the
68
Packet Pg. 1631

10

alphabet before we see this housing initiative come to full
fruition. Uh, thank you Mr. Uh, DePasquale for bringing
this forward. I'm glad we are able to receive this during

with me on it in particular. Um, I think Mr. DePasquale
actually went with me on a tour to an LGB-- proposed LGBT
Housing in Washington DC just to get an idea how they were- how they were gonna run it. Because the idea is we don't
have to reinvent the wheel.
The wheel's already been made. Let's just copy it and

making sure this hit-- hit the agenda. Hit the council

also thank you for believing in enough and the honor and
dignity of the LGBTQI Plus community to say this is so
important. I want to make sure that this gets moving again
as, um, I leave formal service. So I want to acknowledge
Mr. DePasquale for this work. I'm glad to see this is

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, through you. Um, Mike, thanks as well for this
response. Um, I did have a-- a couple of questions. So,

when we discussed the original policy order, but the-while-- while it's true that the Fair Housing Act creates
some-- some restrictions, as Councillor Simmons mentioned,
there's uh, lots of these-- lots of examples of this type
of housing available across the country. And-- and some of
them, like Triangle Park Apartments in Los Angeles is 70%
LGBT. Uh, Spirit on Lake Apartments in min Minneapolis is
65%. And there are many other examples.
So it doesn't seem to really provide a-- a practical
limitation to, uh, achieving high percentages of LGBT, uh,
folks living in these-- in these housing, uh, developments.
And then the response mentions the private real estate
developers. But most of the examples that we see across the
country, uh, I-- I think almost all of them are subsidized

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

one, and-- and, you know, we did talk about this before

housing, uh, income restricted to some extent. So I was
curious about the inclusion of private real estate
developers and-- and what role we think they would play in- in this effort.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Madam Chair? Madam

Chair?
Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you. If I may,

uh, respond to my colleague. Uh, through you, Madam Chair,
to my colleague, thank you for asking that question. About
20 years ago, the-- one of the very early initiatives was
100% privately run. And the flexibility about private-- the
private market is you don't have the restriction that, as
you mentioned, around income or who you can invite in and
who you can-- cannot.
And so part of the reason, um, I-- I want to say the
attorney's name was Scacchi, but I-- don't hold me to that
because he was on the ground floor of this. I-- what I want
to believe was 100% market rate, uh, which would not have
had the same restrictions as municipal state or federally
funded housing. We wanted to have the benefit of that
knowledge so that the real estate, uh, piece that you see

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

there is more about people who have done it without subsidy
and benefiting for what they may be able to tell us. If
it's even a far away chance that we can do it, very likely
it's going to be market moderate and low.
71
Packet Pg. 1634

10

It's certainly gonna-- we-- if we can pull this off,
it'll certainly very likely be funded through public or
state fund-- state or federal funds. But we really want to

of someone who's attempted or done it, uh, that do-- don't
come from, uh, out of the private sec-- out of the public
sector. I hope that helps. I yield floor, Madam Chair.

We're onto City Manager Agenda

Item Number 7, transmitting communication from Louis
DePasquale, City manager, relative to the appropriation of
$500,000 from free cash to the Public Works-- $500,000 from
Free Cash. The Public Works Public Investment Fund,

a Mack LR Electric Rubbish Packer. Councillor Nolan, you
have the floor.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Through you. This is, uh, I have to say a very
exciting purchase. I-- I pulled it for a couple questions,
not because I wouldn't be fully supportive of, I believe
this will be our first ever all EV heavy duty, uh, DPW. We
have a number of other EVs, but they are not in this

category. Um, a couple, uh, questions again, while I think
it's very exciting that we're here, I can't wait for me not
to be able to hear the trash trucks going in front of-- in
front of houses across the city.
73
Packet Pg. 1636

10

Um, we should still always understand per our green
Fleet's policy what the other options were. So just in the
future, just make sure that backup is provided to the

out of free cash. I think it'll be helpful for all of us as
we have free cash expenditures to have just a running total
of what this leaves in the balance of free cash.
And there was mention that this is gonna be placed
immediately so that we can, um, make sure we get in line
'cause I know these trucks are very popular. There have
been rebates from the state up to, I believe, $90,000 for
fully electric trucks. And I'm just curious as to whether
we are eligible for those, if you applied to those, and if
we might expect to see in the future a reduction overall
and the overall cost as a result of that.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor, I know John Nardone is on the line, so I really
don't know the answer that question, so I'm gonna turn it

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

council and there are-- this is, uh, expected to be funded

over to John.
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER JOHN NARDONE:

Yeah. Uh, through

you, Madam Mayor, um, to you Councillor Nolan. Yes. We are
exploring, uh, the possibility of getting some rebates. And
74
Packet Pg. 1637

10

you correct, those are in the $90,000 range. We're in the
process of filling out those applications and, um, with any
luck, we will-- we'll get those. The problem, uh, that

actually grants, they're not rebates, but, uh, is that the
grants come in, uh, much later than, uh, when we order
things. So we would still order the vehicle, um, you know,
we would pay for it upfront and hopefully we get some, um,
grant money to reimburse that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Yes. In

fact, we may have to have actually already purchased it in
order to get the rebate. That was true for the $2,500 I
got, which I used to pay for the charger in my garage when
I bought my electric vehicle. I just wanted to make sure
that was on the table.
Again, I'm excited and I look forward to even more of
these purchases over time as we replace our entire fleet

with electric vehicles and hope that, um, every time we do
this, we also have the backup of-- of whatever other, uh,
options were considered. Thank you. I yield, Mayor

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

it. And-- and I'm wondering if there's any reason for that.
Do we-- do we have a long-term plan and, you know, do-how-- how do we-- how do we start replacing all of our
trucks? Right? And-- and did this opportunity just come up
and-- and you know, you brought this to the council, or how
did this happen?
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Uh, so we have a ca,

uh, I'll, John, okay, I'll let you start off then. I'll
follow up if I need to. John. Through you, Madam Mayor.
Sorry.
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER JOHN NARDONE:

Uh, yeah, through

you Madam Mayor. I'm sorry, Louis. Um, to you, Councillor.
So, you know, we've been talking a long time about overall
how we can electrify our fleet. And I think we've done that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I'm happy to see it. Um, but, uh, I-- I was surprised by

in kind of the low hanging through with Sedans and-- and
starting to look at those that are really readily
available. Uh, we've had some good conversations with
several Councillors about how we begin to get our heavy76
Packet Pg. 1639

10

duty fleet into that kind of that electric realm.
Um, and I think we are pretty hesitant with a lot of
our vehicles, only because, you know, those are year-round

have that are heavy duty. Um, this is what we would
consider in the heavy, heavy-duty field, the low hanging
fruit. Um, our rubbish packers don't plow like some other
cities do. Um, and they really-- they serve one purpose.
We've been talking with the city of New York for-- ever
since they started their pilot program with this very same
truck.
Uh, we've met with them several times, both online.
We've gone down, we've seen their operation, we've talked
to drivers, we've talked to their head mechanics, and with
the exception of some really minor things, problems that
they had. Uh, this one, I-- I-- I'll knock on wood, I think
this one is a no-brainer for us. Uh, we do need the
infrastructure. Uh, the good thing for us is because the

don't need a fast cha-- charger right away to charge these

10

able to do fine. We are exploring the possibility of fast
charger of public works, but, um, I don't want to put that

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. I, I thought the manager wanted to respond as well,
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

So I would just follow

up and say that John did an excellent job. But one of the
things that did happen this year, which made it a little
easier, is that we had no snow after the snow and ice
appropriation. And we had built in some funds for snow. So
even though we're not taking that directly, we'll leave a
balance in your account, which will help replenish this. So
this is something we really wanted to do in having the
opportunity to have some money available because we didn't
get any snow after our appropriation. Also made it a little
easy here, but it is clearly something that is on the

one for us.

agenda for public works moving forward.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, uh, Madam

Mayor. Through you. That was very helpful. Do-- and,--and I
appreciate the opportunistic nature of this, but, uh, I
78
Packet Pg. 1641

10

think it would be helpful for the council again, uh, as my
colleague mentioned as well, to-- to get a little bit of a- of a sense of what the plan is and how we're gonna move

particularly if this works out really well.
Um, so I-- I would, uh, hope that we can get, you
know, maybe through a committee hearing or-- or through a
report, a sense of what that timeline will look like to get
all of our trucks all-- all electric. 'Cause this is very
exciting, uh, as my colleague mentioned. Um, my last
question is around the safety features on this truck. Is
there anything, uh, particular about it that-- that will
help improve the safety of these vehicles on our streets?
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER JOHN NARDONE:

Uh, so through you

Madam Mayor, they will have all the same safety features
that we currently have on our-- our large packers or our
large trucks. You know, things like bike guards and backup
cameras. Um, I think the one thing-- one particular thing

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

forward with-- with replacing all of our trucks,

about this truck and-- and a lot of this has to do with the
fact that we've gone to two person vehicles.
Um, we've been looking for this type of truck because
it's what they call a cab over. So it can sit lower to the
79
Packet Pg. 1642

10

ground. So from a, um, you know, a worker standpoint, it's
much easier for them to get in and out of the truck. We
have drivers and laborers that are co-- constantly in and

little bit safer for them.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Great. Thank you.

And-- and it's my understanding that that also improves the
visibility and reduces blind spots, uh, for the drivers. So
that-- that sounds really good. Thank you.

but I think it's a meeting that where you have really shown
all the work that you have been working on.
And I hope that sometimes you'll be able to come back
and see the fruits of your labor, uh, particularly some of

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation and

the things that you brought for us this evening. Um, as
many of you know, is the building-- The Boardman Building,
uh, has been in area-- in the port, has been, um, vacant
for about 20 years. It-- the land, I--if-- if I have my
81
Packet Pg. 1644

10

statistics right, this land was sold to us by the Boardman
family. Uh, the most important thing about it though is
that the land that-- I think-- I believe you said Paul sits

The Wampanoag and-- and a few others. And-- and I
think it's always important that we remember that as we go
forward. But back in, um, the 1800s, the Boardman family
sold to the city for a dollar, the land, for the purpose of
a brick schoolhouse. And it was the first brick
schoolhouse, uh, in Cambridge. We-- some of us allege that
the bricks from that building were-- were from the, uh,
brickworks up in North Cambridge.
Although we have not been able to say that with
definitive, you know, uh, to say that is actually the case.
But here's this building, uh, so-- sold. Here's this land
that was sold to the city for a dollar, uh, by the Boardman
family. And it's also interesting to know what the
Boardmans, Andrew Boardmans, um, of which there were

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

on, belonged to the Massachusetts tribe, to the Nip Month.

several, held the position of town clerk for over 50 years.
It's an interesting tidbit of information.
So the building, the land sold to the city, the city
of Rex, uh, a school, the-- the Brick Schoolhouse for the
82
Packet Pg. 1645

10

community. 'Cause at that time there was-- it was
neighborhood school. So here in 1802 for-- for a dollar,
we, um, purchased-- we purchased a land in 1868, the

schoolhouse. Um, you also note that Boardman, um, Boardman
Street is named after the Boardmans. That's another
struggle that we have to talk about.
We didn't get to appoint that other committees, uh,
Mr. DePasquale because you didn't appoint doesn't mean we
don't have to sit on it. Um, what's so-- what's important
about this Windsor Street building that it was built as a
school, but it has served as a center for seniors, is
served as a-- as a health clinic. It has served as a
library, it has served as a recreation center. So it's
always had a community process, education being, uh, part
of-- part of the mainstay of that building.
I think that's very, very important. The other thing
that we found out, uh, those of us that love history in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

schoolhouse was built and it's been standing, there's a

museums and things of that nature about this building and
the Boardman family that we're still doing research on, we
believe also owned at least one slave that we can document
named-- a man named Cuffy. And I actually have a copy of
83
Packet Pg. 1646

10

the fellow sale for him that he was sold to a woman that
lived in, uh, the port, at the time to the Boardman family.
Um, his name was Cuffy.

because his building is just so rich with historical
information that sits in the midst of an extraordinary, uh,
community, again, as a schoolhouse, a senior center, a
health center, a library. So I am really pleased that the
city managers looking to bring the building back online for
the city's using. I just want to speak up for-- as a
resident of the port, uh, and the state that I-- I have,
um, really want to speak about, um, how we are going to use
this building.
Again, it's so important and so timely for us to be
bringing this online because the building has been sitting
vacant for-- for 20 years. And a number of people recently,
there was a meeting with over 40 people present, and a lot
of them said they would love to see some place that talks

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

We're still doing research on him. I just say that

about the history of Cambridge, uh, in this-- in this spot.
Because the point does not want to be just seen as a haven
for social service programs, as you all probably know this,
all over 30 social service programs in-- either in or
84
Packet Pg. 1647

10

serving the port. And so there's a number of people that
are a little tired of-- of social service programs being
the default, uh, of the port community. We are a rich,

We have a history to tell, uh, we have a history to
share. So we want-- we want something that could be a
source of neighborhood pride. Uh, and we'll give people all
over the city at least to come visit us and to learn from
us and to acknowledge our value to this community. And 105
is just-- would be an ideal, uh, location as you heard from
someone who testified. And-- and the City Manager's, um,
write it up, he says, of the many uses, one could be a
place where we get the stuff, tell the story of Cambridge,
uh, with some-- with a museum.
As you probably know, there's about 25 museums in
Cambridge. Twenty of those belong to, um, Harvard, the
other, uh, the other to MIT. None of them tell the story
of-- of Cambridge, the good and the bad. So I just want to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

vibrant community.

really say that here we are a world-class city and we need
to start treating ourselves, our city, and this
neighborhood as a part of a world-class city by capturing
purity and presenting the history of a world-class city by
85
Packet Pg. 1648

10

giving the history and culture and-- and culture our home.
So this is an unutilized space. I've walked by it many
times. I've been in it many times. In fact, one of the men,

which-- which is-- which was the Cambridge Asian-American
Association and of-- for-- for years. And so I am hoping as
we roll this conversation out, uh, to the community, um, we
get to hear from all the voice voices that show up all the
time without being asked and the ones that we have to
really bring out. But for those few old people that I've
talked to, um, we want the city to look at the port.
It's not a place where you put all your social
programs and we believe social programs are important job
training area and art and community space and all of that.
Uh, but we also don't want to be seen only as that. So I
look forward to, uh, to this process. I also want to just
say to us that the Pry Development Authority, um, did a
whole plan around this building that had failure to launch.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

one of the places that it was used to be the home of Shama,

So I'm hoping the CRA's, uh, efforts will not go
totally in vain and that this-- but-- well, we honor the
work that they've done. We honor the people that live in
the city. We-- but-- and most importantly, we honor the
86
Packet Pg. 1649

10

people that live in the port. So, uh, again, I see this-this rich historical building being the jewel in not only
the city's ground, but in the ports craft. And we've been

to support this notion.
And we turned the entire city looking at places that
might be suitable. And 105 was certainly in the-- in the
tarp rate. So I want to yield the floor again. Again, thank
you, Mr. DePasquale on your final night as our-- our leader
in chief doing all this, bring all these wonderful
opportunities for us to work on.
Uh, not in your absence but to work on. Uh, I hope
that we will all get an opportunity to reap the, uh, fruits
of all the labor that's been going in around this building
and around the whole idea of holding on and restoring in,
passing along our history. Madam Chair, I yield the floor.

Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you, Mayor

Siddiqui. Through you. This is, um, exciting to have this
before us. I was struck by all of the co-- many of the
87
Packet Pg. 1650

10

comments, uh, made in in public comment about the vision
for this space is a multi-use center is doing a multitude
of uses. Um, that what are named in the-- in this memo

education, exhibitions, as well as a Cambridge history
museum and city offices.
And there were many other uses that we have talked
about as a council that will be very exciting. And I want
to make sure that those are included in whatever
feasibility study is done in this ongoing community
process, which, um, I have heard from the community, which
is a makerspace, a preschool, a library.
There's just many possible uses. And I-- I wonder how
these funds will be used if the community process about how
the structure is going to be used is not yet determined how
it is that we're gonna be doing the build out. So that's
my-- my first question and that it's mentioned in here that
some of the, um, the design program will include the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

includes several, the meeting spaces, spaces for public art

continuation of ongoing community process. So kind of which
comes first because there's so many.
There's a range of, uh, ways this building could be
used. It-- it sounds like there's already a decision to
88
Packet Pg. 1651

10

keep it instead of if sometimes having just done the
foundry realize I was there when, uh, the City Manager
another did a ribbon cutting. It turned out to be a-- a 46

project. So I just want to understand where in the process
we are in terms of the community input and design.
DAVID KALE:

Through you, Madam Mayor to Councillor

Nolan. So if approved with this appropriation, that will
give us the resources to explore the potential
opportunities, go out to the community, get their ideas,
and then frankly as, um, part of the process to see what is
the feasibility of-- of those ideas and how they may or may
not be able to be accommodated in the building. So it is a
process that we follow and we do get input from the public
and when then we try to see what in fact can be programmed
in the building and then make decisions thereafter.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. So all of

million project when we expected it to be a 6 million

those various elements will be like-- Makerspace, preschool
library, you know, this is also an entity as has been
mentioned, has a variety of uses over the years. Uh,
Concilio Hispano used to be in this space that, that's, uh,
89
Packet Pg. 1652

10

uh, community within Cambridge that no longer has that kind
of presence. It's certainly something that would be really
important for us to ensure is included in the-- in the

My other question is there-- there was the CRA study
done in, uh, 2017, the CRA report, which-- which went
through this and had a feasibility study to do the first
round of renovations. That total cost to bring us to a
point of doing it sounds like much of what is being
proposed now is $2 million, $2 million and 50,000 for the
total cost of that project.
This is $4.5 million for-- is it the same kind of work
and it's just escalated? Is this additional work? Is this
what-- what-- how do we look at that report which was
recommending this $2 million and how does that tie into
this request today?
DAVID KALE:

I think there'll be a couple phases,

obviously. Through Madam Mayor to the Councillor Nolan.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

discussion of how this is to be used.

Obviously, this appropriates funds for design and
construction, but the first piece will be the design and
then obviously once we go through the design on the uses,
um, um, the cost estimate. And then we'll-- we will be back
90
Packet Pg. 1653

10

to you for more funds to deal with the actual construction
once we have a better sense of where we're going and what
the potential costs are estimated to be.
Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah, thank you. That

didn't quite-- so is this in addition to-- is this in
replacement of the 2 million that was proposed in 2017,
that was cost estimated by the CRA for a, I mean the scope
of it was electrical scope, it included, uh, estimation of,
you know, basically making it accessible, HVAC
architecture? So I'm just curious as to how that ties
together.
DAVID KALE:

I-- I-- well, there's a couple

components. There's clearly, um, the design component to
fit what the program will look like, and then obviously the
building does need some remedial repairs. Um, but then also
if it's going to be rehabed totally there will be a
construction cost. So there's probab-- so I think frankly

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

the 2017, and I'm not 100% familiar with that. I-- I think
maybe it was a placeholder, but the reality is, is this is
for design and, uh, whatever's left over for construction,
but we'll probably we will be back for more funds to
91
Packet Pg. 1654

10

complete the construction component of the project.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

Madam Mayor, David,

what are we projecting right now early on in the bond

DAVID KALE:

Uh, so we've-- we've had-- through, um,

Madam Mayor, we-- we've-- again, I-- I-- once we get with
the design and we get done with the cost estimates based
upon the program, um, obviously we've been before you for
some of our bigger projects, but right now we have a
placeholder of 20 million in total. Um, we'll see what that
looks like once we have cost estimates based upon what
we're designing for.
Um, and then we'll see if that is a good number or not
based upon the, uh, climate at the time for pricing for
construction and the like. And, you know, um, we, we-- we
have John Nardone on the, uh, call as well as Christine
our, um, um, city, um, uh, architect, uh, assistant
commissioner. But basically, that would be the process that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

schedule?

we would use and would come back with you for additional
appropriation to make sure that we would meet the, uh,
needs of the building as well as the resources to do that.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Nolan.
92
Packet Pg. 1655

10

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Okay. I-- it just

surprises me 'cause this-- what I'm looking at is from dead
list. It's a cost estimator on the concept design estimate,

you were-- what I'm hearing is we're gonna do a design, we
will, before we engage in any kind of decision about what
the program will be-- the council will be involved in that
decision.
DAVID KALE:

You will get another recommendation for

additional funds. So yes, you will be.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Okay. Um, great. I'm

also still, you know, for the doubling of cost it sounds
like, um, from 2 million to 4.5 million for probably
similar work but construction.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

I-- I-- I think David

is saying it's not similar. David is saying there's a part
of this is for the basic construction, but then there's
also additional fund as we know this project is gonna cost.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

which includes electrical, which includes-- so-- so what

I would also say based on my little experience in
construction, a 2017 report based on where we are now, I
don't even know if it would be worth referencing if I'm
being honest, based on price escalations the way it's gone

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Yeah, sorry.

We have a few people after

you.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yep. I'm-- I'm happy to

have this be included on a broad look at how it is that we
can best use this building and what the best use will be.
And what I'm also hearing is that this will also include
the feasibility of any of those and if it turns out there's
some question about whether-- what the best use is, we will
all be involved in that discussion before any additional
funding is. So thank you, Mayor Siddiqui.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you to the manager and-- and Mr. Kale. Um, I
believe there hasn't been, um, a-- a study of the existing

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay.

building condition yet, is that correct?
DAVID KALE:

Um, I-- I could stand to be corrected. I

know that when we've toured the building, uh, we've done
some preliminary cost estimates to deal with the roof and
94
Packet Pg. 1657

10

the envelope and I think that's where we're using
potentially some of these funds to make sure we can protect
the asset if need be. Um, but in terms of the overall gut

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Yes, and-- and that's

what I was getting to, that the first thing is an analysis
of what's there structurally. My guess is the roof has to
be highly, uh, probably entirely replaced. Um, the skin
needs a lot of work. The windows will be replaced and
you're gonna do all that before you really understand the
problem. Uh, so wonderful building from the outside, it had
never been on the inside.
It's a community scale building. So the potential is
great. You know, I-- I would recommend pre-K, which was not
on that list since that neighborhood, especially if it's
subsidized, could-- could use that. Not entirely, but part
of that list, um, uh, the mentioning that the foundry was
initially fixed at 6 million, that was early catalyst money

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

rehab, that's obviously a bigger scope.

to get private money involved. So that was never the
budget, that was strictly the city initial investment.
Um, and no one would've known that it would end up
where it is because the building was in worst condition,
95
Packet Pg. 1658

10

even though we were all pessimistic, it was in worst
condition. And this building laying fallow probably is
similar. On the other hand, the finished product, certainly

historically renovated. And the inside if-- if it's all
classrooms, has great potential to be flexible.
So, uh, I'm optimistic and I think this is a great
start, but as you have said, it is a start to find out
where we really are, but it's a commitment, uh, to do the
right thing and, uh, we thank you for that. Thank you,
Madam Mayor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Vice Mayor

Mallon.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Through you. I think Councillor Nolan, um, asked a lot of
the questions that I had around, um, the funding and how
much the projected cost is. I am curious, one thing that
was mentioned in this CRA report was that there was some

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

from the outside will be a knockout restored ren--

idea that there would be CR-- CRA revenue from the MXD
development as part of a possible financial, um, impetus
into this program. That-- that that would be an a, you
know, a potential capital funding. Is that something that
96
Packet Pg. 1659

10

the CRA is still working with the city on in terms of this
project or-- or no?
DAVID KALE:

Uh, through you, Madam Mayor to the Vice

um, re-energize those conversations to see what things are
the same or not the same. Obviously, the CRA has in-- done
some other projects in the meantime, so their ability to
take on some more projects is something that we really
haven't had a lot of conversation about, but we will.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Um, thank you. Madam

Mayor, through you to Mr. Kale and to Mr. DePasquale. Uh,
yeah, I think if there's some mechanism for you guys to get
that information back to us, it would be helpful. Um, just
because I know the CRA has been very, very interested in
assisting the city with some of these, um, projects outside
of Kendall Square to really contribute to the community,
particularly in projects like this.
So it would be great to re-energize that conversation

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. Um, that was five years ago. So we will-- we will,

and see if there is any financing available from the MXD,
uh, development. So those were my questions. Thank you. Um,
and thank you for bringing this forward. I know that's
something that the community has been asking us about for a
97
Packet Pg. 1660

10

long time, and every time I walk by that building, I think,
gosh, I wonder, um, when we're really gonna start thinking
about what to place here.

uh, views on what could be in there and that the city
certainly has a lot of needs, but I hope that there's a
continuation of a community process to get us to a place
where, um, the community can feel proud of what's going in.
Well, thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We will go to Councillor

Zondervan and then Councillor McGovern.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

moving forward on this building. Um, I do have a lot of
questions and we heard a little bit of public comment, but
I, I think the-- the public would benefit from, uh, having
some time to-- to become aware of this and, and to engage

these funds before us. I-- I would just like to get a
little bit more detail on how exactly these funds will be
used, um, to help enhance our affordable housing programs.
That reading the, um, agenda item, it didn't seem like this
money would be run through the Affordable Housing Trust, so
I-- I didn't quite understand how this money will be used

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

exactly.
CITY MANAGER LOUIS DEPASQUALE:

from HUD on an annual basis, and it usually doesn't, um,
show up on the, um, in our budget document just because
there is a timing mismatch between the federal calendar and
the city's budget calendar.
So we are always, uh, we- we are always coming to you
short-- shortly after the budget, uh, approval with, uh, a
bunch of these federal-- federal grant programs, including
this one and the next one. Um, so the home funds are-- the
federal government sets up a fairly, uh, in some ways
broad, but with fairly stringent guidelines what the
funding can be utilized for. And we've listed at the, at,
uh, in the document in the last paragraph, the kinds of,
uh, the range of possible work that's possible.

have not specifically identified a project that it would
get allocated to, uh, but we anticipate that it would, uh,

understanding of exactly how these funds are used. I mean,
it's-- it's exciting to see that they're available, but I
still have no idea exactly how you're going to use them to- to-- to, you know, enhance our affordable housing
101

programs. I-- I don't know if you have examples, maybe of
previous projects that you can provide, not necessarily
right now on the spot, but you know, in-- in the future

sense of how these funds get used, um, specifically. That
would be great.
ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER IRAM FAROOQ:

Sure. Sure.

Through you, Mayor Siddiqui, here we are. Um, we're happy
to pull together, um, both a few of the examples of use of
past funds, uh, as well as, um, perhaps a little bit more
detail from the program guidance of what, what's the range
of, uh, utilization that is possible under the program.

that you can make available to us, just so we have a better

housing built in the past small projects that literally had
10 different funding sources, and that's the creativity and
the drive that the housing department has to put that
together and the housing trust I assume as well. So, uh,

in Middlesex County in 2020, the program, uh, the-- the

allocation is, um, is mostly through grant agreements, um,
actually almost exclusively through grant agreements with
existing entities to provide services.
It's not intended, uh, to be so much for construction,
but for people with AIDS who are income qualified. Um, so
the range of programs are things like, uh, programs of the
AIDS action community, uh, AIDS action committee, or the
Institute of Health and Recovery. Uh, Lowell Houses

renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction revolving

Um, and so, um, I know that Iram is on the call, but
basically what this authorization does, since it's a
revolving account on an annual basis, the city council
needs to establish the spending limit for the revolving
107
Packet Pg. 1670

fund based upon fund balance and projected, um, income, so
that you have the funds available to spend on projects. And
so that's why we're asking for a million six hundred and
fifty thousands authorization as the expenditure, um,

limit.
Um, obviously, we can come back more to raise that if
there's additional revenues, but, uh, in the-- in the, uh,
memo from the manager, it outlines what we expect to
receive and what's in the fund balance, and those, again,
will be used, um, for renewable energy projects.

ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER IRAM FAROOQ:

Through you,

Mayor Siddiqui, the only thing that, um, I would add is
that, um, as we've discussed at the-- the recent hearing
last week, is that we are working on a, uh, virtual power
purchase agreement. Uh, and while the focus, you know, part
of the focus is the city, um, municipal energy use, we are
also thinking of that as being something that could support
the aggregation. Uh, and if, um, if we're able to make that
108

Packet Pg. 1671

10

work, that would be one of the key areas that this funding
would, uh, would go to support.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

1.3 million has already been spent?
DAVID KALE:

Um, through you, Madam Mayor. Iram,

correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I believe the cost
for the Graham Parks project was.

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

That's correct.

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you. I guess

I'm a little bit confused about the timing of that. So
we're voting on a spending limit, but most of the money's
already been spent?
DAVID KALE:

Um, no, because the-- it's beca-- it's a

rev-- excuse me, through you, Madam Mayor, to Councillor
Zondervan. It is a revolving fund, which is the nature of
that is basically, it's-- it's a quasi-grant program. So

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor. Through you. So did I hear Mr. Kale correctly that

basically, we collect funds which then can be expended, uh,
without, um, with this authorization. So basically, um,
this is meant to really establish the expenditure limit for
the revolving fund based upon available receipts.

moved forward and then it will get supplemented with, uh,
additional funds as they come in through the adder, um, for
this coming year.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Okay. Thank you. I--

I-- through you, Madam Mayor. I think I understand that a
little bit better, but it's-- it's still a little bit
confusing. If it's presented to us as, you know, 1.6
million, but 1.3 has already been spent. Um, I-- I don't
fully understand that. I appreciate that. It's a-- a

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. Um, as most of my colleagues will
recall, this of course, is a, uh, new transfer station that
was originally proposed at Fulkerson Street in East
Cambridge. And we were luckily able to relocate to, um,
this site and this proposal to rework the open space is-is not new and-- and not surprising to us.
So of course, I-- I fully support it in order to
facilitate the construction of this, um, substation. But we
did hear some concerns in-- in public comment about using
this diminished process. So I would like to understand a
little bit better what the difference is between using a
diminished process versus the full process and the extent
to which the community gets to weigh in on particularly

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Councillor Zondervan.

the-- the new open space as it gets, uh, designed.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Uh, through you, Madam

Mayor, um, this, uh, the full disposition process is set
forth in chapter 2.I10 of the municipal code. I don't have
113
Packet Pg. 1676

10

it right in front of me, but the full, uh, disposition
process under the ordinance requires that there be two
separate appraisals for the property to be disposed of a

before the city council, as well as possibly some other,
um, public outreach.
And I believe there needs to be some sort of
representation about, uh, what other uses might be able to
be made of the property. In this case, that's not
particularly relevant because these are covenants that were
put in place. So, I mean, a co-- we have previously
informed the council that a covenant on real property
restricting its use is a property interest of sorts.
Therefore, we believe it is subject to the disposition
ordinance. There also were some previous covenants that
were modified, um, in connection with this overall, uh,
larger project going back many years. And, uh, that also
involved a request to diminish the full disposition

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

hearing before the planning board. And I believe a hearing

process. So it is a disposition of a property interest, but
it's a use type of property interest as opposed to any
actual ownership.
So it's a covenant that would, uh, restrict the use of
114
Packet Pg. 1677

10

these open space areas to be available to the public for
public open space uses for a period of time. Right now,
there are four such covenants in place at this overall

is the Broadway Park. And then there are two covenants that
relate to the Danny Lewin Park.
As part of this overall project, the Danny Lewin Park
covenants would be extended by a number of years to be coterminous with the, um, expiration of the proposed, um,
modification of the covenants to the Benny Park Covenant
and the Broadway Park Covenant and the existing two Benny
and Broadway Park covenants. Excuse me, did I-- I might not
have just said that correctly.
The Benny and Broadway Park covenants would be
terminated. The Danny Lewin Park covenants would be
extended to be co-terminous with the new, uh, covenant that
is proposed to be located on top of the Eversource
substation after it is constructed for a total net gain in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

site. Uh, one is the so-called, uh, Benny Park, the other

open space of, I believe it's approximately 4,800 square
feet.
So the total amount of open space that's currently
restricted in the Broadway park and the Benny Park would be
115
Packet Pg. 1678

10

replaced with the open space area to be constructed on top
of the Eversource substation with this additional area
included as well, as well as an extension of the existing

original question of, I'm sorry if that wasn't helpful, but
I'm just trying to say that it's, uh, so they're not-- the
termination would be terminating covenants as property
interests, but it would be with respect to replacement of
an alternative covenant accomplishing similar, uh, public
open space, um, development.
And the modification would only be as to the two Denny
Lewin covenants, which would not be terminated, um, at all
by this. So it's really just the extension of those two
covenants. I'm sorry if that's a little rambling, but
please let me know if you have any additional questions.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan and then

Councillor Carlone.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

covenants on the Danny Lewin Park. So, going back to the

Mayor. Through you, I-- I do appreciate that. Um, I-- I
think what I would like to understand a little bit better
is what will happen under this diminished process now. So
you mentioned under the full process there would be all
116
Packet Pg. 1679

10

these hearings about the end of these covenants, and then
presumably about to some extent the new governance or-- or,
you know, the proposed new covenants. But if we use this

there any hearings for the public to, uh, engage with this- with this process?
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor,

the-- this is the process that's being proposed by Boston
Properties, which is to have this matter on the city
manager's agenda before the city council tonight with the,
um, approximately 60 pages of attachments that have been
submitted showing the existing covenants, the proposed new
covenants, and explaining the process that's related to the
proposed construction of the Eversource substation and the
need to make these changes to the existing covenants.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor?

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. So-- so I'm hearing that there's no

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

diminished process, then what does that look like? Are

further process besides what we're doing right now, and
then in a few years, the new substation will build and then
some new open space will appear, and that's it. And I-- I
think that is a little bit unsatisfying. I-- I don't--it-117
Packet Pg. 1680

10

it does seem like the full process is excessive in this
case, but-- but it seems like it should be possible to have
some process, particularly as the station moves forward and

So it doesn't sound like we're gonna resolve that
tonight, but-- but hopefully we can, uh, get some
assurances from-- from the Cambridge Street Development
Authority and-- and Boston Properties that there'll be some
more public process, uh, related to this. We're-- we're
also hearing some concerns about, um, the transmission
lines related to this, um, transfer station. But, uh, I'll,
uh, ask-- I've asked that question separately of, uh,
Engineer Watkinson. Hopefully I'll get a-- a response to
that, um, separately. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Councillor Carlone.
Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. I, uh, through you to the manager and his team. Um,
I mean, it's-- it's very clear that for the project to move

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the open space starts to get planned and designed.

on on a schedule, this approval needs to happen sooner
rather than later, especially given that it's five weeks to
our next gathering. Um, my question, uh, to Madam Solicitor
is what happens after 2080? Whatever it is, the, uh, the
118
Packet Pg. 1681

10

extended covenant.
CITY SOLICITOR NANCY GLOWA:

Through you, Madam Mayor,

um, I don't have right in front of me, but I believe in

district, the, um, the redevelopment plan, which has been
approved by the city council for the redevelopment
district, there is a requirement to build out a certain
amount of square footage of residential properties and
business properties as well as open space.
That open space does not have to be permanently
committed to only one area, because as the rest of the
development district is built out, as I understand it,
there may be times when either Boston properties, the
designated developer or the redevelopment authority may
come to the council requesting to move the designation of
open space from one area in the MXD District to another
area. So that is what is being proposed here.
These covenants are intended to assure that the-- that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

the, uh, the MXD zoning as well as the redevelopment

these particular covenants stay in place for that amount of
time, and I do not have this memorized. So, um, and I don't
know if Mr. Evans is available or anyone, but, uh, someone
perhaps could-- could confirm my belief or perhaps Iram
119
Packet Pg. 1682

10

could, but my-- my belief is that the provision of that
amount of open space in the total MXD district is a
permanent requirement, but it can be provided in different,

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Well, that's a very

strange urban design concept. I understand. Now they've
redone open space a number of times and built bigger
buildings. Um, I won't be here in 2080, but, uh, I find
that a really bizarre concept. On the other hand, I know to
make the project work and to get Eversource started, uh,
which is essential for many reasons, um, we really do need
to move this. I just hope the council in 2080 is very firm
about not building in any of these spaces, um, which has
happened before. So I will be voting yes, and I encourage
others to vote yes, but, wow, very interesting. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We-- we do have Tom Evans who

has his hand raised, so I'll allow him to respond to
whatever has been said. Tom?
TOM EVANS:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

uh, locations from time to time.

Thank you. Um, through you, Madam Mayor.

Um, just a few things in response. One, uh, there is a, uh,
process un-- that's just about to get underway to do some
programming, planning and further design work for the open
120
Packet Pg. 1683

10

space on top of the substation. Um, we've figured out where
all the, uh, structures and mechanical issues are for the
substation.

- before the CRE Board and the planning board, um, in the
special permit, it was determined that, uh, further
planning work would have to go forward, uh, to really
design that open space. And so that planning effort's gonna
begin with a, um, a, a programming effort to figure out,
well, what, what does the community want? What does Kendall
Square need as open space?
Um, and then re-approach the design process there. So
there-- there is more process to come. Um, regarding the
MXD district, uh, the zoning, uh, requires that there's
100,000 square feet of open space, um, in the district. It
can be moved around. Um, part of that is, uh, likely put in
place because, you know, some of the open spaces, uh, are
built on structures such as the rooftop garden on, uh, top

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And then although we did have a plan presented before-

of a garage.
Um, certainly there might be a day where we don't have
the green garage as a parking structure, and that open
space, uh, could be reconfigured at that time. Um, I would
121
Packet Pg. 1684

10

also say that it's unlikely it would ever see anything get
built on top of the substation that wasn't, um, uh, you
know, open space because of the accessibility reason, uh,

need for the substation may certainly change.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Uh, urban plazas need certain characteristics to work. The
proportions of this plaza are fine. Um, there's been an
analysis of sun, which is okay during certain times of the
day, but it's a fountain water, a major feature. It's
outdoor dining, and as I understand it, um, the last I saw,
outdoor dining was going to be very difficult. I hope
that's changed. I'm not suggesting for a response now, but
I will call a Neighborhood and Long-term Planning Committee
meeting on this, uh, in the near future to see where we
stand. But once again, I'll be moving forward tonight. I'll
be voting yes. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I yield.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon - Yes

opportunity of your last, uh, city council meeting here
with us, uh, to thank you for your 47 years of service. Um,
I have only had the opportunity to work with you directly
for the past six months, but, uh, in many ways you've had
127
Packet Pg. 1690

10

a-- a-- a-- a big impact on my life and career.
Uh, moving to Cambridge at the age of 12, I got to
benefit from the Cambridge Public Schools, which have been

managers, and all the work you've done to maintain the
fiscal stability of the system. I-- I've also been an
employee of the city of Cambridge and also a union
representative who represented, uh, 1,100, uh, teachers and
paraprofessionals.
And, uh, I'm very happy that during my time as a union
president, my job was made easy 'cause I never had to worry
about the fiscal stability of the city. We never had to
worry about layoffs, and we were always well funded as a
school district. And our employees had great benefits and,
uh, great salaries. Uh, as a parent in, uh, Cambridge, my
children have benefited from the fact that you, uh, were
overseeing the Fisk of the city, uh, and now as city
manager have, uh, managed, uh, all of our departments and

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

so well funded and supported by-- by you and prior city

my wife and children have benefited as residents of the
city, and I'm greatly appreciative of that.
Um, I wish you well in your retirement. I know that
we'll see you quite regularly around town, uh, especially
128

on the baseball fields. But I just wanted to take this time
to thank you for all the great work you've done over 47

Simmons and then Councillor McGovern.

to smile. Okay. Uh, you're looking-- you're looking a
little pensive. Uh, Mr. DePasquale, I want to just take
this opportunity, uh, to say thank you again.
I think it's important not to just thank someone when
they're getting ready to leave because they're moving on to
a higher position or because they're retiring. I think it's
always important to tell people, or especially gratitude
toward people all the time. I hope I've always done that
because I believed in the work that you do. I believe in
the work that you've done.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I often talk about how people, uh, can be role models,
but I don't see you as a role model, Mr. DePasquale. I see
you as a real model. There are young men and young women
throughout our city that are gonna look at you and say, I
129
Packet Pg. 1692

10

can do that because he did that. And not just you did it.
You did that as a kid from Cambridge. As, um, as that tshirt says, here's a young man who ca-- who grew up in

city, and worked his way up through the ranks. And I think
that's a story that often gets lost.
So you should be proud of that. I thank Cheryl and
your family for lending you to us for all these years with
long nights and applause and a few boos, and you have come
through it, um, with-- with, um, a level of poise and
honor. I don't know if I've ever seen you lose your temper.
And it's hard to do that in these kinds of jobs.
I mean, we have-- one thing we all love about
Cambridge is we have an active citizenry. Something that's
not too good about Cambridge just has a active citizenry.
And so they're always pulling on, you've wanting your
attention, wanting their services, and you've been able to
do that. I've known you since I was on the school committee

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Cambridge, went off to college, came back, worked for the

back in the 1990s, and I found you easy to work with then.
And then when I came onto the city council, and
particularly when I served as mayor, I found you very easy
to work with. You were always reasonable.
130
Packet Pg. 1693

10

Now, I'm not gonna-- I don't want anyone to think that
Mr. DePasquale was a yes man, because he wasn't. We would
go toe to toe up. My favorite thing to say about him and

He'd make Lincoln cry because you didn't want us just to
spend money willy-nilly. 'Cause you remember the lean days,
you remember those days and we didn't have that money.
You know, what's so interesting, sometimes I say to
people, you drink from a well you didn't dig, but you know
those days, you participated in digging that well so that
people would not be thirsty. Meaning they would need food
or shelter or a job or a-- a hot meal or a kind word.
So you should feel extraordinary about what you've
done, whether it's working with our youth in baseball, I
never got the baseball thing, but I said earlier, I'm not a
big sports person. You really embrace citizen en-engagement. When you became city manager, you-- you
established a citizen advisory so you can hear from folks.

his predecessors, that he would hold onto a penny so tight.

Always coming to meet with the seniors.
Every-- every absolutely every time I said would or
ask, I'm gonna say, said, ask, would you-- do you have time
to talk to the senior group? You always made time. And
131
Packet Pg. 1694

10

those few times that you weren't able to come, you'd send
someone to be there in your place or that no one could
really fill your shoes. So whether it was the BIPOC
community, or I want to say black, indigenous, and people
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

of color, you would always be willing to sit down and talk
and say, what are the issues? How can we solve them? And
how can we solve them together? Or the LGBTI Plus
community, how can we make this happen?
This is a good idea. And there were a few times you'd
say, I really don't know about that. But the fact that you
are willing to listen, because I-- I could tell you some
stories about your credit successors that weren't as kind,
he-- that weren't as kind. You support the business
community. You-- no matter if you were talking to a high
dignitary or just a-- a-- a regular person down on their
luck, you treated everybody equally and with respect. And
that is a skill that everyone doesn't possess.
Again, you're not just a role model student scholar,
you're a real model. So I wish you good health, good luck,
and great success in-- in your retirement. You know, as you
know, retirement is when you stop living at work and you
start work working to live. And so I hope the rest of your132

being home all the time. Uh, but again, to you, Mr.
DePasquale, to the family, to the staff that thinks so
fondly of you, on behalf of all of us, I want to thank you.
But let me start what I, uh, finish what I was saying.
I do want to say a big thank you to-- to Cheryl
DePasquale because again, it's not easy doing this job, so
you have to have an extraordinary person, uh, holding you
up to get-- so you can do this job. So, congratulations, I
wish you all the very best.

being out in the community, people feeling like they can
approach you and talk to you, not as the person who runs
the city, but as Louis. And that is not an easy balance to
strike in the position that-- that-- that you've worked in.

you know, as a person and, um, and your-- your leadership
style.

you know, we're always talking about things that, um,
things that we're not doing right, things that we need to
do better, things that we need to pay more attention to.
Um, and when we do stop to take a moment to say, hey,
but we're doing all these good things, sometimes people get
ruffled about that and say, oh, you're being too, you know,
patting yourselves on the back. But there's a lot of really
good things that happen in this city that don't happen by
accident. And they happen because people in leadership have
had a long-range view, um, you know, to make sure that we
have the resources to do things.

mere fact that we are having a conversation about spending

You can probably read it from there. Um, no, he can't. But,

I can tell you that it is pretty amazing how many people
know you in the city.
I learned what kind of sandwich you like, turkey with
bacon, and a wrap, in fact that you always get that at a

I also wanted to say thank you to Louis for your 47 years
of service. It's a tremendous accomplishment, and your
heart has always been here, uh, with the residents of
Cambridge, but also with the West Cambridge Little League,
I think, um, I always knew you as the mild-mannered
assistant city manager for fiscal affairs when I worked
here in the mayor's office.
And when my son, uh, was on your team, I showed up for
my first practice and you were screaming at these kids, and
I thought, who is this person? And everyone that said,
that's-- that's Louis and I-- I didn't recognize you, but
I-- I got to know both sides of you and how passionate you
were, uh, both for your players, how much you encouraged
them, how much we all appreciated you as a coach, but how

whatever there had been in our working together was upended

by a really, really, really challenging time, which the
city and you contributed to coming through with an
incredible array of services and changes and-- and helping

I think, how you approached it in your very long career,
which I was not aware of.
I'm not even sure I lived in Cambridge when you
started working for the city, even though I feel like I'm
an old timer. Clearly not. Um, as Councillor Toner said, my
kids certainly benefited from the range of programs that
you were-- helped the city make. Um, it's-- as we know, we
disagreed on some things. We tussled a little bit, and we
always were able to have respectful conversations and make
sure that we understood each other, which is, again,
something we can have more of.
Um, and-- and I also know that we also both love
numbers. We understand them, we use them, and we-- we know
how critically important it is to make sure that we're

people in this really tough time, which is a testament to,

grounding ourselves, particularly around budget issues and
as we approach things. And that's something I think, uh, I
always appreciated in being able to talk to you about and
knowing that whatever I said you would understand, and you

helped me understand even deeper some of the numbers.
So I will say, I'll-- I'll miss calling you and
hearing what's cooking and then we talk, and then it's not

lunch around Blair Pond in your retirement, which you may
fix up right in your backyard, which is an incredible
hidden gen-- gem in Cambridge. As the quad area gets
totally developed, we'll all be descending on you for-- for
advice and for working, um, working lunches, perhaps around
the pond. And apparently what I should, um, say now is to
really wish you well in your retirement. You king you, you
are amazing.

Madam Mayor, do you mind if I just say a few-MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

tonight's resolution, and thank the mayor for allowing me

to say a few words. Uh, I will be brief, but I've had the
privilege to work with many incredible city employees
during my career.
I have always known that our employees at the city's

to the public that every city employee plays an essential
role in our ability to carry out our goals and positively

enough for the incredible efforts and dedication to our
community.
I especially want to recognize and thank my team
that's indirectly in the city manager's office, and they
were all sitting here, so, Mary, Ellen, Stacy, Francesca,
Matt, Lee, and Dan especially. Thank you for all you do.
You've put endless hours to support me as city manager, and
I can't thank you enough.
I also will truly miss the amazing colleagues I've had
and many friends throughout my career with the city. As I
have said, I have been blessed to work with great people
over the years and have made my work in the city so
rewarding. As city manager, I've also been fortunate to
work with three highly collaborative mayors; Mayor

me for this opportunity. I want to thank the current and

believe that over the past five and a half years, we have
had a positive impact on the community that we've placed in

Without an open and honest partnership between the
mayor, city council and the administration, we would not be
an effective government that we are today. Our community,
our business organizations, our faith community, and our
nonprofit leaders in the university and regional partners
are critical parts of this community. I was pleased to
personally thank many of them today at the Chamber of
Commerce event this morning.
I want to thank them for their partnership over the
years. While the city can do a lot, we cannot solve every
problem or provide every service on our own. Cambridge is

Uh, thank you, Madam

Born. This woman was extraordinary. Uh, her funeral was a
Saturday. She died right after her 102 birthday. I'm not
going to read all the warehouses, but I think it's
important to-- to just say a few things. Uh, Abni Born came
to Cambridge in the 1940s as a part of the Great Migration.
She worked a number of jobs in Cambridge.
She was-- she worked at the Harvard Coop Cochrans,
which many people in-- in the chamber probably don't
remember. Uh, she worked at the Cambridge Headstart with
Kids. She was the Employment Council for the Office of
Manpower Affairs at Cambridge. She worked for the Cambridge
Economic Opportunity Committee. She even, uh, participated

in a program called Cambridge Rents A Kid. I looked for
that program myself.
Uh, she was re-- she was an extraordinary woman, uh,
wear of hats. I used to always admire her crowns. But in
156
Packet Pg. 1719

10

addition, she, uh, worked as an election poll inspector
for-- and poll clerk for over 50 years in North Cambridge.
She was a Boy Scout, then mother of Girl Scout leader, an

and Russell Elementary Schools, an active member of the
concerned Black parents for Betty Cambridge at the
Cambridge and High and Latin School back in the 70s.
And she also served many years with distinction on the
Tenant Council of the Russell Senior Housing Complex at the
North Cambridge, uh, north Cambridge Senior Center. She
lived 2050, uh, 2050 Mass Avenue when the building went
under renovation, and she was relocated to one 50 area. And
I visited her there and one thing she said was, I can't
wait to get back to 2050. She loved that building.
She was a member of the Union Baptist Church of
Cambridge, and just did so much for her community. She
really believed that if-- if you are not busy doing
something for someone, then you're not living right. I'm--

if she were to be a song, I would say the work that I've

Uh, yes. Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Uh, many of you may know that the Reverend

first Parish in Cambridge, Unitarian Universalist. Uh, and
I said, who is this extraordinarily young man? I-- a
brilliant orator, very committed to social equity, very
committed to social equity. He even got me interested in
going to the-- the service for the praying over the dogs.
That was a stretch for me, but I would do that because
of Red Reverend Dyer. When the Harvard Report came out, he
was one of the first people to kind of read and want to
engage and say, what were we in Cambridge doing? And asking
Herman University to do. I am pleased for him that he's
moving on, uh, to further his education.
He's gonna work on his-- his PhD, but I'm sad for us,
um, sad for First Parish in Cambridge, Unitarian
Universalist, but I certainly wish him well. I also want,

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor, and thank you Councillor Simmons. Yes, I-- I would
love to be added. Um, uh, I remember when-- I-- I don't go
to First Parish as much as I probably should, but have been
going there for a number of years on and off. And I
remember when, uh, Adam, uh, was hired, um, to come to
Cambridge.
And, uh, he just had such a profound impact on the
culture of-- of the Unitarian Church on First Parish, um,
in-- in terms of, you know, the-- the issues he brought to
the table, his life experience that he brought to the
table. Um, but it wasn't just within the-- within the
confines of the church. Um, his work with Y to Y, which is
in the basement, um, of the church.
Um, he's sat on a number of various, uh, task forces,

in Cambridge. And-- and he really, um, you know, he just
really immersed himself in-- in-- in this community in-- in

100 different ways. And, uh, as Councillor Simmons said, I

this is the-- the one I go to. And, uh, I-- I can't say
enough good things about, uh, the Reverend. He's-- he's
just been an amazing community member as, uh, my colleagues
have said. And, uh, I'm gonna miss him a lot, and I wish
him all the best. Thank you.

Yes. Certainly, I wish the

Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um,

I-- I couldn't not, uh, just talk about, uh, Mr. Maloney
for a little bit since he has 48 years of service to the
city. Uh, trumping-- trumping, uh, City Manager
DePasquale's 47. Um, my-- I first knew, uh, Mr. Maloney as
the person who signed my paychecks when I was a school
teacher in Cambridge.
Uh, he, uh, being the, uh, chief, uh, financial
officer for the city. Uh, but after 20 years working on the
city side, he went over to the school department side. And

I had the pleasure of working with Jim, uh, when I was the
union president, and he was Chief Financial Officer, COO
for the school department. And, uh, he was always a
pleasure to work with. Uh, as the union person, uh, he was
163
Packet Pg. 1726

10

the man I was negotiating with on over many things and we
always reached satisfactory resolution to contracts and
issues, uh, dealing with, uh, facilities and teacher

And, uh, it was just a joy to work with him and a
pleasure to work with him. And, uh, he has been such a, uh,
a mainstay in the school department helping us, uh, through
not just COVID, but mergers and closures, new buildings
being built, uh, just a whole variety of issues over the
past 20 years. And I just want to wish, uh, Jim a happy
retirement, uh, well-deserved retirement. Uh, I also know
that, uh, uh, Councillor McGovern would like to also be
added as a sponsor. And, uh, I see that as, uh, certainly a
friendly amendment. Thank you. I yield.

gave the best of himself to the organization called the

his life. I hope he does it well and knows that we think of
him often and fondly. And Madam Mayor, I yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We go to Vice Mayor Mallon,

Councillor Nolan, and then Councillor McGovern.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

And, um, thank you to Councillor Toner for putting this
important resolution, um, to honor Jim Maloney for his many
years of service, uh, to the Cambridge Public School
Department. I just wanted to say, I know we all know Jim
from his time as the director of fiscal affairs here for
the city and also, um, for the school department.
But I think what people may not know about, uh, Jim,
is that at the beginning of the pandemic, he was one of the

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

City of Cambridge. I wish him just the very, very best. Uh,

architects of making sure that every student in the
Cambridge Public schools, who was home remote learning,
actually had access to a breakfast and a lunch every day.
Um, he and I organized a team of people, but Jim Maloney
165
Packet Pg. 1728

10

wasn't just doing this from behind his desk or at his home.
He was driving food from one site to another when
there wasn't enough at-- at, you know, the MLK or there's

that work himself, um, at great personal expense, I would
say. I think, you know, he was in a-- a-- a high risk
category, um, for COVID and to see him out there each and
every day.
And I mean, we probably texted 475,000 times in those
first couple of months making sure that those kids had food
to eat, but it was really for him. Um, he was so driven to
make sure that kids didn't go hungry while they were home.
Um, and he was out there each and every day. So, um, while
we are all here, uh, celebrating his long and storied
career here in the city, in the school department, I think
that's something I really wanted people to know, is that he
really cared about our kids, um, and-- and in such a
specific way over the time of COVID.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

too many people at the Morse. Um, he was literally doing

So, Jim, I-- I wish you the best of-- of luck in your
retirement. You certainly deserve it. Um, and to your wife,
Ann, thank you for lending us your husband, um, for all
these nights, weekends, um, and all the times he wasn't
166
Packet Pg. 1729

10

there. So thank you, Jim Maloney, for all of your time here
and your dedication to the city of Cambridge. Thank you,
Madam Mayor. I yield back.
Councillor Nolan.

COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. I will

reiterate or just echo what my colleagues have said. Having
worked with, uh, Jim for a long time during the school
committee and always understanding and knowing how much he
would rise to the occasion, he would put in the hours, he
would come up with, um, ways that we could have yet another
meeting on a topic.
He would, uh, be there on a weekend. He would
organize, um, whether it was a budget hearing or whether it
was yet another meeting, discussing some of the
consequential changes in the district. He, um, sometimes,
like many other people in the city kind of lived, uh, lived
at the school district, sometimes we all felt like, and-and he was also as Vice Mayor just said, so deeply

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

dedicated to ensuring that the school district served our
kids as well as he could.
And he-- for people to understand the COO of the
district takes into account such a range of different
167
Packet Pg. 1730

10

things that are really important, that there's the
education, but then there's the school buildings, and then
there's the meals, and then there's the transportation, and

kids get to different places or that we coordinate with the
city on our afterschool programs and our summer programs.
And who gets to have those summer programs, are just every
single one of those elements that were critical to-- to the
success of kids that we, uh, seek to serve in the city.
Jim was really at the center of making sure that those
systems all came together. So as my colleagues have said, I
wish Jim well, I hope he is looking forward to retirement.
He certainly, uh, earned it many, many times over, given
his-- his long career with the city before he even moved
over to the school district when I had the opportunity to
work with him. So, thank you to colleagues who put this
forward, and I would-- I would certainly like to be added
to the, um, resolution. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

then there's how it is that you're going to make sure that

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, on a similar-- similar theme as, you know, the Vice
Mayor was talking about, you know, Jim, you know, driving
168
Packet Pg. 1731

10

around to make sure there was enough food, uh, at-- at
these locations. And, you know, it's a sort of a similar-little similar to-- to what we said about Louis. Um, you

well, maybe three years ago now, um, from a parent who had
rented a school gym on a Saturday for her child's birthday
party, and the custodian didn't show.
And so you had-- she had all these kids waiting
outside to get into the school, and she was like, can you
help me? Can you help me? Well, I called Jim, and Jim drove
down there and opened the building and stayed there and
took-- did the job that, you know, of the custodian to make
sure that these kids had their birthday party. And this is
the stuff that like nobody knows about, right?
You know, people know-- the public knows, you know,
how does someone-- what does someone say at a school
committee meeting or, you know, at a city council meeting,
and did they support this and did they support that? Nobody

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

know, I remember getting a phone call like two years--

knows this other stuff, you know. Um, just a couple months
ago, we all got an email, uh, from a gentleman who was
getting married on a Sunday, and there was an issue with
his-- with his marriage license on a-- on Saturday.

And

169
Packet Pg. 1732

10

what happened?
Ms. Crane went in on a Saturday in Open City Hall to
get this guy his marriage license so they could get married

really understand the commitment that some-- that the
people who work for this city have to this city and not
just focus on did I agree on this issue or that issue. Jim
and I didn't agree on every issue.
We had our back and forth, but you cannot com-- you
cannot deny his commitment to the children of this-- of
this city and--- and to this city in general. And it's
just, um, I hope that this continues as we're seeing a lot
of retirements happen. I-- I hope that his-- that new wave
of folks come in, uh, that they have that same commitment
because it's-- it's-- it means a lot to a lot of people,
but it goes unnoticed. So, Jim, thank you, um, and, uh, you
know, we'll see you around.

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Um, my colleagues have said a lot that I-- I don't want to
repeat. I-- I met Jim when he was the chief financial
officer for the city, and, uh, was very impressed with him
170
Packet Pg. 1733

back then when I was a consultant to the city. But I know
Jim and Anne as neighbors. Uh, they lived next door and,
uh, they're just wonderful people, uh, uh, who care about

supportive and very caring about the city as a whole. Good
people. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

there's anyone else who's spoken. And I want to echo
everyone's thoughts. I-- the last few years have been
really rough and Jim did a lot-- a lot of work. So wish-- I
wish him well in his retirement. So we'll add-COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

recognize, uh, a long standing public servant here for the

in his retirement and wish him well. And thank you for your
many, many years of service here, um, to the city of

No worries, no worries.

it first. So, Councillor Toner, if I could be added as a
173
Packet Pg. 1736

10

co-sponsor. Um, I hope he's listening. Arthur Goldberg, you
were just one cool dude. I-- I've seen him, we've talked
intermittently, but I really never got to really know him

And this last several years, he came to the council
more often than he had before, and I really got to know him
so much better. And spending, you know, not a lot of time,
but enough time in the, um, city hall to have a
conversation and just developed a profound appreciative of
who he is and how he works and how well he is respected. A
as many of you know, in 2007, he got the, uh, employee of
the year award, and that was certainly well deserved.
So as you go forth, Mr. Goldberg, Attorney, Deputy
Solicitor Goldberg, as you go forward in, uh, whatever life
leads you, I hope you go with this knowing this, that we
appreciate what you've done, and we know whatever you
choose to do going forward, it'll be quite as wonderful as
you are. I yield the floor.

headed the ordinance committee for a few terms. And
whenever Arthur was here and we asked for his opinion, he
always gave a direct, straightforward opinion. And other

that, it was a productive meeting. And, um, I think that's
just in him to make sure that that happens. And that's
quite a trait to have. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

proud he is of his son, Cameron, um, for-- for being on the

thing. Um, you know, but we've had very-- very-- very few
of those kinds of things, uh, happen in the public.
And that is because, um, you know, Jim does, uh, such
177

an amazing job. And-- and certainly, um, you know, I think
Madam Mayor and--- and, you know, you can attest and-- and
Councillor Simmons when she was mayor, you get a little

a little more, there's some more moving pieces. And, um,
you know, Jim was always just incredibly responsive and
incredibly helpful and-- and incredibly, uh, understanding
and, um, professional and polite and, and, uh, again,
another really dedicated, um, uh, city employee who did a
lot of things that people don't even know about, but, um,
kept this city running and, uh, I wish him all the best.

all, his office was way in the back, uh, in the corner. And
if you didn't know it was there, you would miss it. It was
a great place to hide out. And I would kind of go there and

issues, uh, financial issues.
An extraordinarily smart man with an encyclopedic
memory and funny, he had the best sense of humor. Uh, so I
just say to you, Jim, I hope you're listening and I'm gonna
miss you. Do not come back here 'cause we'll press you into
service. Enjoy your retirement. Our thanks to your,-- your

having you work, the crazy hours that city-- city employee

Nolan and myself. Councillor Carlone, you have the floor.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you. Thank you,

Madam Mayor. Um, we discussed this at first during the
budget hearing and then maybe a month ago. And, um, and
basically what this is, is just about every one of the
counselors and the mayor have submitted policy orders about
problem streets or sections of streets where there's speed
or people not following, uh, the law. And it-- it dawned on
a few of us that, um, the whole concept of a road, and I--

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I've studied transportation.
Road design is no longer how many cars can you squeeze
in within an hour to get through a-- a place from one point
to another. Uh, we live in this city, uh, we sell in this
183
Packet Pg. 1746

10

city, and we work in this city and play in this city. So
it's a different concept. And-- and we were able to lower
the speed limits that works for most cars, but one out of

standard in traffic design you expect one out of seven not
to follow it, but then not to do anything about that is
you're creating a-- a more dangerous situation.
And just within the last six months, we've heard
people complain about Cardinal Madeiros, Concord Avenue,
Upper Concord Avenue, Garden Street, Linean Street, Sherman
Street, more recently Third Street, and where I live,
Washington Avenue. And I know you've all heard about other
streets that I haven't listed. Um, and yet you look at our
budget, 250,000 for traffic calming, traffic signals,
350,000. That's probably three traffic signals in the city.
Maybe not even that, Vision Zero, 300,000. And it raised
intersection, which changes the drainage can be $250,000.
So this is just wrong, I think. Yes, we're doing great

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

seven don't pay attention to it. And that's sort of a

streets like Western Avenue, but there's so many other
streets that need less rebuilding, but we need to look at
this. And this goes back to the $5 million theoretically we
got back from-- for the Lechmere station from the MBTA. I
184
Packet Pg. 1747

10

have no doubt that's already been reassigned in the budget.
So this is more for the next budget.
Each of these numbers should be many times what the

where one of our councillors lives is a raceway, no doubt
about it. And, um, that's one street that little kids live
right off of and on. It's just wrong. And we can do this.
We have the money, certainly have the free cash, but we
also have the budget capacity. So that's all that this is
about. And the order is to rethink the amount of funding
considering the $5 million refund for transportation.
Now, I know in ARPA, uh, the request has been money
for, uh, free bus passes or free bus system. I'm all for
that. Uh, I can tell you in the ARPA recommendation that
Co-chair Nolan and myself fulfilled that and our
recommendation to the manager, uh, we'll see what it is. I
believe we put in two to three, might even have been three,
I don't recall now. Um, so we're trying to really begin to

budget is to have a meaningful impact. Cardinal Madeiros,

focus on this. Um, our streets are-- were not intended in
recent years to be a speedway, but they become that. Thank
you, Madam Mayor. I hope we all support this.

I've had a car crashing into my house. Um, every weekend we
have a car crash, including yesterday. We had a near miss
involving a bicycle. And, you know, I-- I'm just-- I'm at
my wit's end asking for some kind of intervention, some
kind of improvement to the intersection and-- and nothing's
been done. So, uh, thank you for bringing this forward and,
uh, hopefully we'll finally get some action.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We'll go to Councillor

Simmons.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Uh, thank you, Madam

thank you for bringing this policy order forward. Uh, could

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

trying to get a better-- I see the order and it says to
review the dramatically growing need for expanded traffic

that. I-- I-- I'm looking for-- so you're looking for the
City Manager to take this 5 million and take some action?

There's a second order on the second page that the above $5

streets that require traffic, calming, traffic signals, and

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you, uh,

Councillor. Through you, uh, Madam Mayor, to my colleague.
So you're asking the City Manager to take the 5 million and
make some improvements to targeted areas. Is that correct,
Councillor?
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

That's what it says.

Yes. That's what I'm doing.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Simmons.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

That I would

respectfully ask if-- if-- that you would consider adding
to that order and that any traffic mitigation, uh, be
discussed or inform the targeted neighborhood. And what, I
mean, this is a wonderful benefit, but it's always
important to let people know that we're doing it earlier.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

vision zero improvements as soon as possible.

Um, this term it might-- it might have been our last
meeting, I brought in an order saying, let's tell people
what we're doing.
We do this incredible work, and then people wake up
188
Packet Pg. 1751

10

and it's there. As opposed to letting people know we're
going to do it. Let people know that we're about to do it.
Let people know we're going to implement it, let people

that to make sure, because we have a new city manager and
he's gonna be, you know, it's gonna be OJT.
So if it's not written, I would not want that step
missed because this is an extraordinary order asking for us
to do some very important work. But I want to make sure
that we spell out that we're doing this for the residents,
but we want the residents that have been complaining of the
increasing number of speeding cars and trucks on the
residential streets, including, and then you list them all.
Some of us are in the know and some of us don't know. So
would you consider adding to your order and that any
traffic-- any and all traffic mitigation, uh, inform the
targeted communities? We just want to make sure people know
that we're doing this.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

know that it's done. And so would you consider just adding

Councillor Carlone.

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Quite frankly, I think that's a given. I've been
saying that about every planning project, uh, the city has.
189
Packet Pg. 1752

10

And now I frankly communicate directly with Mr. Barr and
he's followed through. I'm-- I think we have to tell him
that. I-- I feel the big issue here is funding and these

year, uh, knowing the process. So I-- I-- I think we can
follow up on that. Uh, I-- I-- I think the key is to get a
commitment. And quite frankly, I don't think we will get a
commitment. It's gonna have to wait 'till the budget.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

have amendment language, the Clerk Crane is looking for it.

relative to preventing overdose deaths and increasing
access to treatment in Massa, uh, in the Massachusetts
House of Representatives.

with a favorable, uh, recommendation. And now it's really
sitting on the, um, speaker's desk. Uh, Massachusetts in
2021 saw an increase in overdose deaths of 9%, uh, across
the state. Uh, and just recently, I held a human services
meeting on to get-- to get some, uh, an update on the-- on
the opioid task force of the city. And one of the things we
talked about, and I had talked about this in council a few
weeks before that, that, uh, over about a eight to 10 week
period in Cambridge alone, we saw nine overdose deaths due
to a tainted supply entering the community.
Um, this is a problem that's not getting better, it's
getting worse. Um, this is a bill that talks about, uh, in
addition to-- to preventing overdose deaths. It-- it-- it-it talks about safe consumption sites. Um, I know that that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Uh, it's current-- it currently came out of committee

is sometimes counterintuitive to people as to why would you
give a place-- a safe place for people to, uh, use drugs.
Um, but in the 20 plus years that safe consumption sites
have been, uh, in effect in other parts of the world, um,
195
Packet Pg. 1758

10

there has never been an over overdose death within a safe
consumption site. And that is what harm reduction is all
about.

hate to be that crass, but that's what we're talking about.
And I just spoke today with a mother who son overdosed, uh,
and died alone, um, in his apartment. And, um, just
recently. And, you know, if that-- if he had used in a safe
consumption site, someone would've been there to revive him
and maybe he'd be in treatment right now. Um, so this is-I get it. If people are-- I know the knee jerk reaction is
to say, oh my God, this, why would you do this? I really
encourage people to look at the research.
I was, uh, one of the mayors on the Governor's Harm
Reduction Commission. Um, I went to Montreal with a group
of people from-- from Cambridge. Um, there's a lot of
research out there. I would be happy to share it with
anyone who has questions. Uh, one of the things you see

but the number of needles found in parks and playgrounds
and sidewalks around safe consumption sites decreases,

Um, many of the places in Montreal where safe
consumption sites were located, a lot of the businesses
didn't even know that safe consumption sites were there.

front of their businesses anymore or in their bathrooms.
Um, they work and the research proves that they work. And
so it's time that Massachusetts get over our-- our fear
that we're somehow legitimizing something, um, safe. Uh,
substance use disorder is an illness.
It is not a crime. There is no child that ever said,
when I grow up, I want to be addicted to drugs. But yet
lots of people are. And until we start thinking of those
folks as that they were 10 years old once-- 10 years old
once, and wanted to do something else with their lives, um,
we're never gonna have the compassion to move forward in
the way that other countries have.
So I didn't mean to go on that long, but it-- it is
something I'm-- I care deeply about. Um, so, uh, I would be

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I-- I-- this is Urban Design, and I visited my college town
this weekend, Troy, New York. And most people go Troy, but
202

10

Troy was the site for the new series, uh, the Gilded Age.
If you watch that on HBO, it's probably the most intact
19th century downtown. And, um, where I lived, had a

fifth year.
The reason I'm bringing this up is downtown is
desolate. Our Harvard squares better than that. Saturday,
uh, Friday Katie and I were there. We walked around,
probably saw 25 people. I went Saturday. They have Saturday
Farmer's Market and most of the streets are closed
downtown. And it was unbelievably packed like Harvard
Square is during big events. Um, I-- I've never seen a
contrast like that.
No cars-- cars had to park on the periphery or in the
garages. And it-- and the businesses were all open, even at
10:00 in the morning, 9:00 in the morning, because they
knew the crowd was there. It was amazing. And I'm happy to
show people pictures anytime. Um, but it was amazing. So

this concept, obviously within the limits that, uh,
Councillor Nolan has written, incorporating input, is
really desirable and is doable.
Uh, I don't know about full-time that you need a
203
Packet Pg. 1766

10

higher density of people living in Harvard Square, but
certainly on regular occasions. So I signed to co-sign
this, but I fully endorse the concept. Thank you, Madam

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. So we do have, um,

the amendment by Councillor Nolan and then we did have the
amendment by Councillor Simmons. I'll let Councillor
Simmons speak.
COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Uh, I was gonna introduce the amendment of adding the
Harvard School Business Association. I do know that the
advisory committee is a broad spectrum of individuals, but
Harvard Square Business Association that has been operating
in Harvard Square for half a decade, if not longer. Would
be-- has a little bit more girth when it comes to all
things Harvard Square. They worked extraordinarily hard to
make sure the business, uh, community has a voice and
something as important as this would be, um, I think an

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Mayor.

important voice to have the table.
So my amendment is that the Harvard Square Business
Association, the Office of Tourism. And the reason why I
say the Office of Tourism is because I hope you'll see, uh,
204
Packet Pg. 1767

10

tourism as an opportunity to bring people in the city. So I
want to make sure that they're talking and a part of this
discussion, uh, as well as the Harvard Square Valley Street
Committee in other areas, stakeholders. And the reason why
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

I add other stakeholders is there are a number of churches
in Harvard Square that are very keen on what happens in
Harvard Square.
I did not name them, I just said other area
stakeholders. So just as this group is getting together to
do their work, if there's somebody that's not, um, at the
table, this-- that's other stakeholders, sort of includes
them. So I respectfully ask that my colleague will accept
this minor support to her order, 'cause I know she and I
both agree that we want to have as robust and as
interactive opportunity to talk about the outcomes of
Harvard Square.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Um, I-- I think, uh, couple things. I-- I-- I thank,
um, Councillor Simmons for talking about other
stakeholders. It just occurred to me, I reread the-- reread
the order just now, uh, that talks about the potential to
205
Packet Pg. 1768

10

enliven Harvard Square, including a Sunday market on Church
Street. We just got through talking about Adam Dyer, who at
uni, uh, first Parish, which is on the corner of Church

A lot of people who go to that parish park in that
parking lot that's on Church Street across from where fire
and Ice used to be. So if we're gonna close that street
down, uh, for a farmer's market, which may be a great idea,
there's gonna be a lot of folks who aren't gonna be able to
park in that parking lot to go to church on Sunday. So it
isn't very important.
All these, these are dominoes, right? And-- and
everything we do has an impact. Um, I was also gonna ask,
uh, to add the Harvard Square Business Association, as you
guys-- as you know, we just, uh, I just worked on them
planning an event, which was very fun and very successful
in Harvard Square. Um, and the amount of work that they did
was unbelievable.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

Street.

Um, and they need to be at the table because
ultimately, it's gonna be them who are gonna be carrying
out all of this programming and things that are happening.
Um, none of this could have happened without them. Um, uh,
206
Packet Pg. 1769

10

and so they need to, you know, they need to be at the
table. They've always been very good partners. Um, and so
I'm glad that we will add them. Um, and so I would

Uh, thank you. And I do want to thank the HBSA for their
work this weekend. Denise Gelsen was picking up trash at
11:00 o'clock at night. That's the dedication. So, uh, I
thank her for that and they should be part of this
discussion.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

So anyone else? Councillor

Nolan?
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Yeah, I'm happy to have

that be a joint, uh, amendment from both of us since I
proposed the HBSA from first. And if we want to add other
stakeholders, that's fine.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And the office of tourism. So

we'll go ahead and, um, vote on the amendment, uh, to add
to the ordered, the Harvard Square Business Association,

these notes are from a while back. We had, um, you know,
the parking minimums policy order, which was introduced by

it was forwarded to the transportation committee and it
left the Transportation committee with, uh, a favorable
hearing.
Um, and from now on, it would go, um, the second

policy order, which was the late policy order, uh, that we
all just brought forth, would treat us. It would continue
on to the Ordinance Committee and the Planning Board. Um,
and so it still has a long process ahead. I just wanted to

reiterate what the two policy orders do. The first one
relook at, um, uh-- the second one, uh, is perhaps easier
to start with.

order in itself, which simply means that developers have
the option but are not obligated to build parking. But they
still can, the same as they could at any time beforehand.
And then the first one would ask for language from CDD,
removing all the other mentions of it, which they are
extensive mentions that it would be hard for us to do by
hand and ask the city to review its general parking, uh,
maximum's policy. Um, I would hope that we can fo, uh, you
know, place the first policy order on file and then forward
the second policy order, the late reso-- or the late policy
order onto the planning and, um, ordinance committees.
Thank you.

Mayor. So I-- I bring this petition in as a communication
at the request of the residence behind the petition. And I
do that in property 'cause they wanted to have the

the city looks at extended hours at Hoyt Field, that their
concerns be heard as well.
So how does this all come up? So it's at the heart of
the issue, is that a number of neighbors that actually abut
the field, uh, did not get word of the petition until, uh,
after the petition was adopted. And their concern was that,
well, no one really came and asked us how we felt about it.
We have-- we are not against, um, awful leash dogs, but we
feel like no one asked us.
And now something's going forward with us without us
weighing in. And-- and a few people were feeling very taken
aback. And I know that it was not the intention of the
petitioners, uh, to make these feel-- folks feel unheard.
So they wanted to be sure that not only that city knew that

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

opportunity to be heard on the issue and make sure that as

there were people that welcome dogs, but had a a bit-- may
have had-- had a-- may have a different opinion. And they
want to certainly make sure that whatever happens at Hoyt
Field will engage them as well.
217
Packet Pg. 1780

10

You see, these kinds of oversights can-- can lead
people to feeling disrespected, unheard and unacknowledged.
So I recently, um, and it was adopted, brought in a policy

goes around its community engagement process, bringing
about greater transparency, predictability, and reliability
to the process across every city department. And so I think
that moving in that direction, we will resolve some of
these issues with-- where someone brings in.
It could be me, I'll use myself as an example. I bring
in a-- a policy order. Um, we have to do our diligence and
make sure that we are reaching out to the people that are
going to be most impacted. Uh, something that Ayanna-Congressman Ayanna Pressley always says is people that are
closest to the pain to be closest to the power. And so I'm
just bringing this in, hoping that it will be referred to
the City Manager so when he takes up that discussion around
unleashed-- extending the unleashed hours of unleashed dog

And I know he's new and doesn't quite know all that
there is in terms of community involvement, but it is upon
us and coming upon us to press the, uh, either the interim

Yeah. Um, I'm fine with

exception to how it's-- my file and the petition is
portrayed, but I'm really not looking forward to getting
into that. But I would just notice there's a lot, you know,
I-- a lot the people who filed the petition asking for offleash dog hours were all people from the Riverside
community.
This petition has a lot of people who are not, um,
which is fine, but they're not to-- to say that somehow
the-- my-- the order that I filed didn't express the
community when almost everybody from that, uh, signed that

So we have two policy orders.

The first one that we have is one that was filed by myself,

Nolan, uh, around the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade.
Uh, as has been mentioned, it's-- this has been just a
really, really horrible, um, even though we knew it was
coming, the way it's hit, uh, you know, has had a really
devastating impact, um, on many.
And so this order-- this policy order kind of really
wants to codify, uh, some of the language similar to the
state around not, you know, on-- on committing, um, to the
protection of abortion rights and reproductive healthcare
rights, and an individual right to make, uh, re-reproductive decisions about their bodies.
And we've asked, uh, the City Manager to, uh, you
know, issue similar directives that the-- the governor as
well has-- has done. So I'll let my colleagues say anything

Yeah. I just want to

echo everything you say, we were all devastated. It just-as you said, Mayor Siddiqui, even when you know it's
coming, somehow you hope it won't be as draconian as it

into tears and all day Friday. And it-- it-- it just-- we
talk about us going back 50 years and it literally is going
back 50 years.
And this is something we, at the local level, can
actually do and can take action on. We can provide, just
like we're a sanctuary city in other areas, we need to do
everything we possibly can to protect people, not just in
our city, but outside the city who come here. And I'm
grateful to Vice Mayor Mallon for the other policy order
we'll be talking about 'cause that's another part of this.
It-- it-- it is literally central to equality of-- of
women. And without it, it-- it-- any talk you have about
caring about-- about women is just wrong. So I-- I-- I-- I

possible to put this in place.

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

It's getting late

absolutely. Uh, very quickly. So first of all, thank you
for putting together this order and allowing, um, all of us
to collaborate. Uh, what I found very devastating is of the
Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

young women, my granddaughters all having conversations
about what this means-- means for them as women about
having control over their own bodies for the LGBTQI Plus
community, you know, in-- I can't think of, uh, Judge,
whatever his name is, Thomason, Thomas.
Thomas, who is trying to set the stage to roll back
full-- full rights and responsibilities. It is horrible
what's going on. And I wanted-- I wanted to stand in the
vanguard that says, we will not stand for this and we will
push back. Which this-- this order is very much keeping in
what we did around sanctuary cities.
When-- when former president came into office and
started acting, uh, very anti-immigrant and we immediately
jumped into the fray and said, not here, not now. And
that's what this policy order seeks to do. Not here and not
now, but we have to do so much more. But this is an
excellent, excellent start 'cause we want to make sure our
staff do nothing to support this-- this anti-- nothing less
226

than anti-woman, anti-equal rights protection, anti-gay,
uh, set of, um, revisions.
So I-- I thank my colleagues for, uh, what I hope--

ready for the fight 'cause we are really in for one. I
yield the floor.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you, Councillor Simmons.

Vice Mayor Mallon?
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

I thank you, Madam

Mayor. I, um, I wish I could be eloquent-- as eloquent as
Councillor Simmons was before me. It was a very dark
weekend for so many of us, even though as the mayor
mentioned, we-- we did know this was coming. It was still
such a shock. I spent a-- a very difficult weekend, um,
trying to explain to my kids, to their friends, talking
with them about what this means for them to not have bodily
autonomy, to have rolled back protections that I-- we've
all enjoyed.

hope will stand with us and to the co-sponsors as we get

Um, and I can't believe we're in this place. I can't
believe that in 2022, we are having this conversation. We
are-- where women do not have control over their own bodies
and their reproductive freedom. Abortion is healthcare.
227
Packet Pg. 1790

10

Abortion is healthcare. And we will not go back. We will
fight. And I-- I-- I hope the men on this council can speak
to this today, because I really need the men in our lives

Women are tired, we are tired of fighting this fight.
We all had a horrible weekend thinking about what's next
and what's coming for our LGBTQ Plus community. What
protections are going to be rolled back next? This is a-- a
small thing that we can do for our community to say to
them, we're affirming your right of reproductive freedom
and bodily autonomy.
We are saying to the young women in our community, we
care about you. We see you, we understand what's happening
at the federal level, but we will protect you here in
Cambridge. So I hope that our-- our colleagues can stand
with us tonight and reaffirm what we know we hold sacred
here in Cambridge and to fight back as best we can. Thank
you, Madam Mayor. I yield back.

COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Thank you. And-- and

thank you, uh, to all the sponsors and Vice Mayor thank you
228

10

for-- for your words. Um, you know, no matter how angry or
sad or upset I am about this, I know you know that as a
man, it doesn't hit me in quite the same way. But I am the

who's had a career of explaining really horrible things to
kids.
I was lost at how I could possibly explain this to
her. Um, and to think that-- that the Supreme Court just in
that same week says a state doesn't have the right to make
a decision about concealed weapons, but a state has the
right to make a decision about what women can do with their
bodies. Placing guns ahead of-- of-- of women's autonomy is
just disgusting. Um, it shows the-- that this-- that this
court has become an activist political court.
Um, and I stand with all of you and all the women of
this community and around this country. Um, and it's
probably a time for me to listen more than speak. But, um,
yeah, I mean, it-- I just, I'm-- I'm at a loss and I agree

COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Thank you, Madam Mayor.

I-- I would love to be listed as a sponsor. Um, I'm sure

the highest degree. And, uh, I have many friends, women,
single women who've, uh, had abortions, others have had
kids on their own. And, um, this takes the decision out of
their hands. And-- and I-- I understand the opposite, uh,
point of view, except we don't do anything for most of the
poor kids who were born, who, uh, the mother decided to
maintain the pregnancy.
So, to me, there's no question. This is part of the
political game. And we had a horrible president and, uh,
who used to be 100% for, uh, the rights of women. And then
of course, he switches and you can see the government-- oh,
sorry, the-- the population as a whole is against this
move. And all I can say is I hope it politically backfires
hard and quickly. And, um, not-- and-- and obviously, we

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

some others would as well. Uh, this is male chauvinism to

have to turn it back to the way it was, but, um, I hope we
all sign. But I-- I can't speak for everyone. Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:
COUNCILLOR BURHAN AZEEM:

We'll go to Councillor Azeem.
Thank you, Madam Mayor. Um,
230
Packet Pg. 1793

10

I just wanted to share the similar, uh, reaction as to the
Vice Mayor. Um, I think that everyone had such a strong
feeling of disgust this weekend. Uh, we all knew that it

they had all of this time to see how population felt, how
two-thirds of Americans disagree with them, and they still
go out and did it in almost the exact same copy as the one
that was originally leaked.
Um, and so I wanted to thank, uh, the Vice Mayor, uh,
Mayor Siddiqui, uh, Councillor Simmons and Councillor Nolan
for bringing this forward. Um, I think that the rulings
come out and it was gonna be a long road ahead. Um, and we
can do what we can do here to, uh, protect, uh, uh, the
women in our community and those who can get pregnant, um,
and support everyone.
Um, and then hopefully lead the battle such that, and
then next coming elections and, uh, weeks coming forward,
we can get some momentums towards getting this, uh,

codified into law. Um, and so I just wanted to thank you,
uh, for introducing this, and would be happy to be added it
as a co-sponsor.

pregnancy centers. Councillor Zondervan, you have the

floor.
COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor, and, uh, my thanks to Vice Mayor for co-sponsoring.

anyone who'd like to be a co-sponsor editor as well. Um, so
this is a-- a slightly different response to, uh, the vial
ruling that came out of our federal, um, Supreme Court. And
I-- I don't have polite language, so I-- I won't say too
much, but I just hope that this will be the, uh, the last
gasp of the patriarchy.
That's all I'll say about that. Um, so, so the
language in this order would ban so-called limited-service
pregnancy centers in Cambridge. And this is based on
language that was recently adopted in Somerville. And, of
course, we'll discuss this in the, uh, subsequent meetings.
But the idea is to, um, not allow these types of centers to
operate in Cambridge because they, um, are quite common
and-- and they'll pretend to be offering services to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

And, uh, as with the previous order, I'm happy to have

pregnant people without actually providing, uh, any
abortion services or emergency contraceptions, or even
referrals to such, uh, services.
And so it's-- it's very deceptive and people can get
234
Packet Pg. 1797

10

tricked into thinking that they will be, uh, receiving such
help. And instead, they are being talked out of having an
abortion. Now, while there are no such establishments

several close by. And just to give you a-- a sense of-- of
what we're dealing with here, there's the Boston Center for
Pregnancy Choices in Boston.
Your Options Medical Center has five locations in the
state, including-- including Brookline and Revere,
Heartbeat Pregnancy Help Center in Burlington, Pregnancy
Help in Natick, Friends of the Unborn in Quincy, Learn Your
Options, Pregnancy Confirmation Services in Revere. So-but some of these, you can tell how deceptive they are,
even in the name. So I hope we can, uh, join Summerville
in-- in banning these establishments and these deceptive
practices from our city.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Vice Mayor Mallon.

VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Oh, thank you, Madam

operating Cambridge right now, as far as we know, there are

Mayor. Through you. Thank you to Councillor Zondervan for
bringing this forward. I did, um, I-- I did also look at
the list, uh, and it's pretty shocking to see there are
over 30 of these pregnancy crisis centers here in the state
235
Packet Pg. 1798

10

of Massachusetts, which I think people really should know.
I mean, I think we think we live in a really, really
blue state and we're safe here. But some of these-- some of

Resources in North Adams, CareNet Pregnancy Resources
Centers in Fishburg, they all purport to be a place where
you can go and get pregnancy options. Right? Many of us
would assume that those are abortions.
Um, but it's not the case. So we-- we really need to,
um, put this forward and make sure that in Cambridge
something like this can't open. I-- I was shocked to find
out that somewhere as liberal as Brookline has, um, uh, one
of these pregnancy crisis centers, uh, operating. So I hope
that we can move this through very quickly. It's, um, you
know, one of-- one of many prongs we have locally where we
can take action and-- and we should be doing it. So, again,
thank you to Councillor Zondervan for putting this forward,
and I hope that our-- our colleagues can join us tonight,

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

these names, New Direction Pregnancy and Sexual Health

um, and-- and moving this forward to the next step. Thank
you. I yield back.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Toner.

COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Uh, Madam Mayor, through
236
Packet Pg. 1799

10

you. I'm just curious if-- if, uh, Councillor Zondervan or
the Vice Mayor, um, I'm supportive of the intent. I'm just
curious, the legality of preventing someone from opening a

this, this discussion. I'm-- I'm just curious if we've
asked the City Solicitor who would stand with-- would
withstand challenge if we prevent somebody from opening.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

I have Vice Mayor who wants to

respond.
VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:

Oh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. That would be the part of the
conversation that we would have once we pass this forward.
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:

Okay. So this isn't going

to an effect right now? This is to-VICE MAYOR ALANNA M. MALLON:
COUNCILLOR PAUL F. TONER:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you. All right.

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

service in the city that offers, you know, these services,

Mayor. Just, uh, as a point of information, we can either
move this to a second reading and then we would have
further discussion about it in the council, including with
the solicitor or we can refer to the Ordinance Committee
237
Packet Pg. 1800

10

for discussion then.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

We have Councillor Simmons

hand and then Councillor Nolan.
Uh, thank you, Madam

Chair. Do-- through you to my colleague, the co-maker, I-I do hear what Councillor Toner is saying, and-- and we may
be advised. We want to do the right thing the right way and
whatever the, um, we might want to either refer it to the
solicitor and we'll hear back at the meeting in August, or
we can refer it to ordinance.
I-- I don't know if ordinance is maybe the correct
place because there's no ordinance before us. I mean, I
don't-- I can't see the order, so I can't read it. And, uh,
but I guess my recommendation would maybe to, um, not
necessarily adopt the order. I think we-- we certainly
support. I support without, uh, doubt the intention. So is
it prudent then to just send it to the solicitor to make
sure that we are standing on solid ground so that we are

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

COUNCILLOR DENISE E. SIMMONS:

doing it correctly?
So I guess my recommendation would be with, uh, my
Councillor, uh, Toner is suggesting, or I think, suggesting
that we send it to the, um, solicitor for, uh, report
238
Packet Pg. 1801

10

before we adopt. And then if it's an ordinance piece, then
we can certainly take it the next step. That would be my
recommendation. I stand down, Madam Chair.
We have Councillor Carlone and

Councillor McGovern and I'll go back to Councillor
Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR DENNIS J. CARLONE:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Uh, I don't think this can be done through zoning
because I'm assuming there are medical people,
professionals, and if not, I don't even know, you know,
counseling. How can you stop anybody counseling, uh,
anything? Um, so I think policy-wise that we don't favor it
and we want the public to know. And, uh, that, I think
makes sense. I-- I agree. We should hear from the
solicitor, but I'm fairly certain what she's going to say.
Thank you.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor McGovern, then

Councillor Nolan.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Uh, thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you. And maybe this is a question for the
Clerk, but, um, can't we do both? Can't we send this on to
ordinance and amend and just ask that the city send it to
239
Packet Pg. 1802

10

the solicitor as well to come back at the ordinance
committee meeting with a opinion while we can do both at
the same time rather than having to delay anything?
Clerk?

DEPUTY CITY CLERK PAULA M. CRANE:

Yes. I-- I believe

we could do both.
COUNCILLOR MARC C. MCGOVERN:
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Thank you.

Councillor Nolan, and then

Councillor Zondervan.
COUNCILLOR PATRICIA M. NOLAN:

Thank you. Um, I'd love

to be added to this and to remind us all we understand, we- whatever comes up, we may not be able to completely
prevent a providing of a service, although we might. What
we certainly should be able to do is to prevent the
mislabeling of a service, which is what these crisis
pregnancy centers are.
They pretend, they put themselves out as if you're
pregnant, come to us and we'll discuss all your options.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

And they lie about it and they're deceptive and they do not
talk about all options. In fact, they give usually false
information about the risks-- risks of pregnancy versus the
risk for abortion. So for me, this is partly about ensuring
240
Packet Pg. 1803

10

that whatever, if we can't prevent them, that at a minimum
we can make sure that it's not deceptive services being
provided.

people who've gone-- who have gone through this, they're in
a very vulnerable time and they think they're gonna get
someone to-- to talk to them about the range of options and
they don't. So I think that's the area in which we should
be able to ensure that in this city, you will not ever be
able to, uh, go to, uh, something that-- that is outright
deceptive.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Councillor Zondervan.

COUNCILLOR QUINTON Y. ZONDERVAN:

Thank you, Madam

Mayor. Through you to my colleagues, the, um, the order
does have proposed ordinance language attached. Uh, of
course we would be, um, wise to get the solicitor's, uh,
opinion on that, but-- but I'm, uh, happy to pass it
regardless because we know that there's precedent in-- in

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 27, 2022 5:30 PM (Submission of the Record)

That's the real crux of this. And it is-- having known

Somerville.
Um, Councillor Carlone is correct that trying to ban
this type of service through zoning would be very
complicated. And so the ordinance simply states that the
241
Packet Pg. 1804

10

manager would not, uh, issue any licenses or permits for
such a service. But it also, um, makes it clear that any
kind of deceptive advertising, uh, would be against the law

with that type of behavior.
So, um, you know, I-- I think it's fine to refer this
to the solicitor for an opinion and then also to send it to
the ordinance committee where we can discuss the proposed
language in more detail.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Sure. So before we do that, I

have Councillor Nolan who would like to be added. I'd like
to be added and Councillor McGovern would like to be added.
So if we can do a roll call on that.

One to refer the attached ordinance language to the

from the solicitor on the attached language.
MAYOR SUMBUL SIDDIQUI:

Okay. So those are the two

motions before us. For the amended order, we can go ahead
and do a roll call.

there should be some language in this policy order that
says, ordered that the City Solicitor review the language.

purchase it, it will be sold, and the housing will not be affordable. The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui
recognized Councillor Carlone who noted that for years he has been saying that the City should
be purchasing all of the property it can and that we need a group of people who are focused on
making acquisitions for several uses. Councillor Carlone noted that this is a logical purchase. The

the site. Kathy Watkins responded noting that it would possibly be used for the Parks Division or

which is confusing. Councillor Nolan noted that we must get to the point where every student in
