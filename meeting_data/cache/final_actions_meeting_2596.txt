1.1

April 6, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:

Based upon a review of the City of Cambridge’s (“City”) personal property accounts, I am
proposing adoption by the City Council of a statutory small business exemption for personal
property accounts equal to or less than $10,000.00 in assessed value, and if approved as a special
act by the Legislature and Governor of the Commonwealth, for personal property accounts equal
to or less than $20,000.00 in assessed value. This recommendation is made to help small
businesses in Cambridge for Fiscal Year 2021 going forward. This is one part of the City’s
effort to help small business in Cambridge through a combination of programs including small
business initiatives, grants, workshops and tax relief, particularly with respect our effort to assist
small businesses dealing with the ramifications of COVID-19.
For smaller accounts, this proposed exemption would decrease the administrative burden upon
small businesses and upon the City Assessing and Finance Departments. Fiscal year 2020 was
used to analyze the proposed impact of this exemption. At fiscal year 2020 tax rates, the
proposed exemption would save a small business $126.80 for a $10,000.00 exemption, and
$253.60 for a $20,000.00 tax exemption. For fiscal year 2020, the City has 2,576 personal
property accounts. Of those, 62% have an assessed value of $20,000.00 or less (which
represents just 0.54 percent of the overall personal property valuation in the City of $1.679
billion dollars), and 49% have an assessed value of $10,000.00 or less (which represents just
0.27 percent of the overall personal property valuation in the City of $1.679 billion dollars).
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has enacted a statute which allows cities and towns which
accept its provisions to allow for an exemption for personal property tax, not to exceed
$10,000.00:
The following property shall be exempt from taxation . . . Fifty-fourth. Personal
Property, if less than an amount established by the city or town, but not in excess
of $10,000 of value. This clause shall take effect upon its acceptance by a city or

Packet Pg. 17

1.1

town, which shall establish a minimum value of personal property subject to
taxation and may modify the minimum value by vote of its legislative body.
G.L. c. 59, §5, clause 54th (“Clause 54”).
The City has not accepted Clause 54, and based upon the foregoing, I recommend that the City
Council issue an order accepting the provisions of Clause 54, which was originally enacted
through Chapter 159 of the Acts of 2000, and to establish the exemption for the amount of
$10,000.00 for Fiscal Year 2021 going forward.
I also recommend that the City request authority from the legislature to allow for a larger
$20,000.00 personal property tax exemption for small businesses, for the reasons stated above.
As such, attached is a form of vote for the City Council to adopt G.L.c.59, §5, cl.54th and a

I am hereby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $16,620.00 from Free Cash to the
General Fund Human Service Programs Other Ordinary Maintenance account for the support of
the daytime operation of the First Church in Cambridge Shelter for the duration of the COVID19 crisis.
The City, through the Department of Human Service Programs, has agreed to fund the daytime
operation of the First Church in Cambridge Shelter for the next 8 weeks. First Church in
Cambridge currently provides a 14- bed overnight shelter. With these funds, First Church will be
providing staffing for daytime shelter space that allows for appropriate social distancing for their
14 clients who would otherwise not have a place to go during the day. Many of their shelter
clients would utilize spaces that are now closed (coffee shops, libraries), so this is intended to
allow those shelter clients to safely shelter during the day through this crisis. This appropriation
reflects the critical importance for existing shelters in Cambridge to remain open and provide
safe spaces and opportunities for social distancing for individuals that might not otherwise have
them.

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate
crisis; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero
emissions no later than 2050; and

WHEREAS:

In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and

WHEREAS:

All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating,
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor,

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Section 12.22.010

Short Title

This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.
Purpose

This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City.
Section 12.22.030

Definitions

A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in
both directions.
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility,
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles.
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City.
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time.
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion,
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to
existing conditions or better.
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading,
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are
restored to existing conditions or better.

Section 12.22.020

2.5.a

I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round,
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible
loading, intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle
lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better.
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane.
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any
such plan shall maintain Connectivity.
Section 12.22.040

Requirements

A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment.
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane
with Adequate Directionality.
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or
(b) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of

H. “Public Transportation” shall mean bus and shuttle stops for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist

shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council.

2.5.a

D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a),
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided,
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has
commenced prior to December 31, 2025.
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-byblock analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that QuickBuild Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection
C.
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle
Lane of Adequate Directionality along
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;

Packet Pg. 73

Attachment: 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025.

2.5.a

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis.
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment.
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound,
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year.
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however,
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

March 31, 2020

My name is Victoria Awkward, and I am the Artistic Director of VLA DANCE, a dance company based in
Cambridge and Boston. I am writing to share the ways in which BioMed Realty has supported my artistic
work and to urge you to support their proposal for 585 Third Street by rezoning the land to allow BioMed
Realty to develop a much-needed public space and arts facility.
I grew up in Natick, commuting into Cambridge to work, take dance classes, and spend time with friends.
Since graduating college and beginning my professional artistic career, I have gravitated towards
Cambridge because of its artistic community and spaces, including the Dance Complex, José Mateo Ballet
Theatre, Studio @ 550, the Multicultural Center, Green Street Studios, and BioMed Realty. However, I
have also witnessed in recent years the closures, full, partial, and potential, of many cultural institutions.
It is vital that Cambridge continues to support its artistic community. Allowing BioMed Realty to develop
on 585 Third Street would increase the dwindling space for artists, especially dancers, to work in the city.
VLA DANCE and our peers in the dance community would benefit, and thus the cultural sector of
Cambridge would directly benefit as well.
I especially support BioMed Realty’s proposal to develop at 585 Third Street because I believe it will be a
wonderful and important addition to East Cambridge, a neighborhood which I called home last year,
living on Gore Street. Kendall Square is developing quickly, and as biotech companies and corporations
take foothold there, what the area needs desperately is space for culture and community. BioMed Realty’s
plan increases green space and will provide access to affordable, diverse and inclusive programming that
benefits not just the people who work in Kendall Square, but the residents of the area as well.
BioMed Realty has shown that they are committed to supporting local arts, and their support for my
company, VLA DANCE, has been unparalleled. Last August, BioMed Realty hosted VLA DANCE’s show
“Bare Velvet” at their campus on Third Street, providing us with a full week residency and monetary
resources. More recently, BioMed Realty supported VLA DANCE’s GoFundMe Campaign with a matching
donation of $5,000. Their support has directly impacted VLA DANCE’s ability to thrive and continue to
enrichen the cultural scene in Cambridge.
I am excited for this project because I have seen how much direct community input has gone into the
plans. I believe that once completed the space will be enthusiastically activated, since the community has
been involved at the initial stages.
With all this in mind, I ask that you support BioMed Realty on the rezoning of 585 Third Street. For
further communications, I am available at victoria@victoriaawkward.com or 508-315-9833. Thank you
for your time and for the work you do for Cambridge.
Respectfully,

Victoria Lynn Awkward
Artistic Director of VLA DANCE

Education and information are everything. It’s disgraceful if children away from school during this uncertain time should
be deprived of what in 2020 is a basic utility. I have wondered about the lack of progress in Cambridge about making
internet access available to all. I am in support of Policy Order 4 (POR 2020 #69) by Councilors Zondervan, Nolan, and
Sobrinho-Wheeler and Mayor Siddiqui. The order asks that "the City Manager explore short-term solutions to expand
essential internet access to Cambridge residents who lack it during the pandemic until such time that a municipal
broadband network can be implemented.”

Councillors and Clerk,
Please include this correspondence in the package of the next city council meeting.
Can you guide me to where the info is about the city contracts being offered to Cambridge
businesses like mine for food preparation?
I have not received any email about the contracts, nor do I see anything posted on the license
commission website, or in the city announcements that go out. My legal clients have also not received
any such contract offers or information.
I have heard, however, that specific businesses that are members of the Harvard Square Business
Association have received invitations to apply for these contracts.
Are these city contracts being offered in a fair and open process for all Cambridge businesses?
Thank you

Public comment for Council Meeting of Mar. 30, 2020

Public comment to Cambridge City Council on City Manager's Agenda Item #2 and Policy Orders #2 and #3,
March 30, 2020
In view of the activity at the War Memorial Recreation Center and Field House on Cambridge Center today its
use as a temporary shelter for the homeless during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency seems to be well
under way. In view of the urgent public need for temporary shelter, I expect that this interim use is something
most neighbors in Mid-Cambridge will accept and support if it is done right. I urge the City to inform and
promptly engage with abutters, the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association, and the Joan Lorentz Park
Committee to ensure that legitimate concerns about the guests in the heart of the neighborhood are promptly
and properly addressed for the good of all.
On P.O.R.s #2 and #3, it will be great if residents of all ages can make temporary use of some side streets and
Memorial Drive for needed socially distant recreation during the Public Health Emergency. I'm sure the MidCambridge Neighborhood Association will be glad to work with the City to identify streets in our area where
this could work.
Please remember, though, that Joan Lorentz Park is Mid-Cambridge's main and only remaining park and
residents will want to use it more even than in "normal" times in the weeks and months ahead.
Thanks for your consideration,
John Pitkin,

Attention: City Council and Planning Board
City of Cambridge, Massachusetts
RE: Support Letter for the Rezoning of 585 Third Street, Cambridge, MA, for Redevelopment by BioMed Realty
Dear Cambridge Council and Planning Board,
I am writing this letter today, in strong and enthusiastic support of BioMed Realty's earnest and well-rooted application
to rezone and redevelop the long-barren 585 Third Street, Cambridge, MA, lot, into a beautiful mixed-use commercial,
recreational, and cultural building, with a 30,000 SF arts and culture center, and a 10,000 SF indoor all-season public
space, at its center, and over an acre of public and green space. I am writing as the President and Executive Artistic
Director of the 17-year-old non-profit 501(c)(3) public charitable cultural organization, Brookline Community Center for
the Arts, Inc., (BCCA) and as an individual artist, engineer, and developer, specializing in mixed-use redevelopment
projects.
Whenever a developer makes a proposal that requires rezoning, one of the criteria should be the determination of the
earnesty and viability of their plans, so I'd like to offer our organization's and my personal experience with BioMed
Realty. I fully attest to their first-rate and caring management, including but not limited to the visionary V.P. of
Development Salvatore Zinno, and the hardworking, passionate, and skilled Community Manager Andrea Windhausen,
with whom we've been extremely fortunate to develop a strong community partnership. In January 2020, they awarded
our non-profit a rent- and utilities-free licensing agreement to their 1,250 SF retail facility at 500 Kendall Street,
Cambridge, (opposite the 585 Third Street lot), along with extensive publicity services and other logistical support, and
recently a $5,000 cash sponsorship, to facilitate our establishment of the Cambridge Community Center for the Arts
(CCCA - www.CCCAonline.org), in support of artists and organizations that had recently lost their space with the
closure of Green Street Studios, and other local cultural establishments and support systems. During challenging
economic and social times, which have only become tougher with the recent COVID-19 crisis, BioMed has proven many
times over, to be a trust-worthy partner, a loyal corporate sponsor, a true team player, a culturally inclusive and
unbiased supporter of community arts programming of all types, and a first and effective responder, each time it counts.
We feel extremely fortunate for BioMed's support of our cultural programming, and a big reason for our ability to
survive through the progressing pandemic, is due to their corporate sponsorship, the many direct community
partnership referrals and connections that they have provided us with, and their regular collaborative engagement with
our programming. This has allowed us to keep focusing our resources on employing artists, and continually developing
our technological infrastructure and reach, which has proven invaluable, as we were among the first organizations to
launch our online/virtual arts programming, to help keep artists working, and for the Cambridge, Greater Boston, and
global online community, to benefit from the dance, martial arts, fitness, and music classes we continue to offer.
BioMed plans to extend our facility licensing agreement through the end of this summer, while increasing our access to
be able to offer on site programming seven days a week, during all prime-time hours of operation, and hope to be able
to keep extending our stay, which effectively makes them our first long-term corporate sponsor, and further
demonstrates their commitment to our organization and the community!
On Thursday, February 27th, a good number of community artists, arts colleagues, and myself, had the great pleasure of
attending BioMed's unveiling of their arts center plans for the Canal District Kendall building they had been working so
diligently on, for the past two years. The strong show of support by a wide range of Cambridge constituents, for
BioMed's visionary building design was well-deserved. As a developer and re-development consultant who has helped

develop and realize several mixed-use cultural, industrial, commercial, and residential buildings, and has deeply
analyzed large (400K to 1.1M SF) building projects with non-profit and cultural elements at their core, financed by the
strong economics of the for-profit residential and commercial building components, I was particularly impressed and
inspired by BioMed's well-rooted, extremely well researched, socially- and community-minded, environmentally
friendly, practical, and from my initial assessment, economically viable detailed building design! From the get go,
BioMed has engaged the community artists and arts administrators to realistically design the cultural facility portion of
their building, in a way that would best serve the evolving needs of the community, including but not limited to their
assessment that a 250- to 300-seat theatre and multi-use and scalable art studios, would be the best approach — From
28 years as a professional artist, producer, and arts administrator, I can confidently say that they have hit the mark, and
the fact that they are continuously getting council from active community leaders, and local artists and arts organization,
in an earnest effort to develop a solid plan for the realization and management of their proposed cultural facility, speaks
volumes of their high chances of success.
I have found BioMed and its community and development representatives, to be highly transparent, forthright, and
dependable, and willing to put their money where their mouth is, in support of arts, culture, and community. My staff
and I have strong confidence, and a consistently growing relationship track-record to prove BioMed's intention, that our
non-profit organization, and many other worthy community organizations and artists, will find a permanent home in
BioMed's proposed multi-use building, that the building will serve as the resounding and unifying center piece of the
growing vision for Canal District Kendall, and that until the building is realized, BioMed will continue to actively support
the arts community with action, shared real estate, and funding. Our non-profit organization and I, wholeheartedly
support BioMed's application for the rezoning of 585 Third Street, and encourage your council to work hand-in-hand
with them to carefully consider, and help further develop and support their well-thought-out multi-faceted building and
environmental plan, and to do so expeditiously, in the best interest of allowing the project to proceed at the earliest
date — the sooner the better for the benefit of the revitalization of the Cambridge cultural landscape!
Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and please contact me at (617) 642-1444 or

RE: 207 Lake View Curb Cut
207_LAKEVIEW_CAMBRIDGE_04_02_20compressed.pdf; Lertter City Council.pdf

Dear Councilors,
We are requesting that the attached letter and revised plans be included in the public record for Monday’s discussion
concerning the curb cut for 207 Lake View Ave.
Based on some feedback from counselors we went ahead and made two significant changes to the plans, attached
hereto:
1) The plans now formally call out “permeable pavers”
2) The driveway as been narrowed from 13’ to 12’
Additionally, we just met with our neighbors to discuss some of their concerns and are amenable to working with them
in a neighborly fashion.
Thank you,
Maggie Currier

3.7.a

April 2, 2020

We are writing to ask for your support on a driveway curb cut on Lake View Ave. I am a life-long
resident of Cambridge, born and raised on Lexington Ave and now raising two children, ages 3.5
and 1.5, with a baby due in August.
In October we purchased the home at 207 Lake View Avenue. We were drawn to the generous
yard which would allow space for our kids to burn off energy and an area for my husband to
garden. We expected it would be a home to raise our family and in the long-term space for my
mother-in-law to move in with us (a widowed, cancer survivor living alone on the North Shore).
In February we drafted plans and obtained signed support from all of our neighbors, and met
personally with our next-door neighbor who would be most affected by the driveway. They
asked for a few changes to the plans, which we readily accepted.
We’ve decided to take some additional measures to clarify our plans. We are an
environmentally conscious family and would like to preserve as much open space as possible.
The initial plans show a 13’ wide driveway which we have amended to 12’. In addition, the
driveway would be made out of permeable pavers which is stated on the plans.
When we purchased the home, we knew there was no driveway. Normally we are able to park
within 5 houses of ours. However, as a 21-week, pregnant mother juggling two toddlers it’s
really become a matter of safety to request a driveway. As you can imagine, corralling children
while loading bags and kids into the car can be a challenge. Additionally, raising a family has
taken its toll on me physically, especially my back, which is prone to falling out of alignment and
rendering me bed ridden. Running after children who run into the street or could encounter a
car backing out of the driveway is a scary situation with limited physical abilities.
My mother-in-law has been coming to our home 2 days a week from Georgetown, MA to watch
the children. This is an hour and a half commute during rush hour. She is not accustomed to city
roads and when she can’t find parking in front of the house, she circles the block which is
confusing and stressful for her. We would like to have parking to accommodate her needs and
well as my own.
Sean O’Grady and Ranjit of the Cambridge zoning department have signed off that this
driveway meets Cambridge building code and zoning ordinances, from section 6.40, we are
more than 25’ away from a street intersection, and are more than 15’ away from any crosswalk.
We appreciate your help and consideration at this time.
Sincerely,
Maggie Currier & Samuel Kachmar.
