Project Background - Where We've Been
November 2020

opportunities in City purchasing, procurement and programs for MWBEs and other historically
disadvantaged businesses and non-profits in Cambridge.”
Early 2021
• Based on conversation in late 2020, the City Council requested that the City Manager and City staff to implement a
Disparity Study and a Sheltered Market Program for WBE, MBE, Veteran's and LGBTQ+ businesses.
• In response to these council orders, Law Department determined that the City must conduct a Disparity Study prior
to creating any type of Sheltered Market Program under state law.
Summer 2021
• Purchasing, Community Development, Law, and Office of Equity and Inclusion Departments worked together to put
out the Disparity Study RFP around goods and services.

WHAT IS A DISPARITY STUDY?
A DISPARITY STUDY is an objective research tool that determines
whether there are disparities in a governmental agency’s
procurement activities of certain groups. It further determines if
those disparities are statistically significant and likely caused by the
race and gender status of firm owners.
A Disparity Study’s uses are:
•

Remedy past or current inferences of discrimination

•

Bolster firms who may have previously been under-utilized

•

Determines a geographic area that creates a pool of firms to be
used for the procurement process

whole plan or ordinance to be dismantled

Sunset Provision

Evaluate Current Procurement Policies
Ways to further encourage participation from M/WBEs
Current efforts

• Purchasing considers W/MBE status as an element in determining “best value” when procuring goods and
services through statewide contracts established by the Operational Services Division.
• Added a section on the City’s Business Certificate form to better understand our businesses. Certificate
additions include:
•

if a business owner identifies as a W/MBE.

•

if they would like to become a vendor with the City.

• Require draft RFPs to include comparative evaluation criteria that rates W/MBE certification status.
• Continue to encourage City departments to purchase from W/MBEs when procuring under sound
business practices.
• Provide a list of W/MBEs on Common Ground for the more commonly purchased commodities
under 10k.

Develop Aspirational Goals
• The Disparity Study found that the City does not have aspirational goals for the
participation of minority- and women-owned businesses in its contracting and
procurement.
• City will look at the availability data in the study and create a base figure for our
overall aspirational goal.
• Once developed, we will work to internally educate staff on how to meet this
goal and review it as needed.

Consider Sheltered Market Pilot Program
What Is a Sheltered Market?
• A Sheltered Market Program is a program under which certain contracts are designated by
the Chief Procurement Officer (Purchasing Agent) for procurement from one or more classes
of "disadvantaged vendors.“
• M.G.L. Chapter 30B Section 18 would allow Cambridge, when authorized by majority vote
and City Manager approval, to create a sheltered market for:
• Designated supplies and services.
• Currently, Section 18 only lists “disadvantage vendors" to be a minority business,
women-owned business, or veteran-owned business.
• May apply to a single contract or to any number of contracts.

Sheltered Market Pilot Program (continued)
How Does a Sheltered Market Process Differ from the Standard 30B Process?
• No sole source.
• Contract shall not be awarded if fewer than three responsive bids,
proposals, or quotes are received or if all rejected (pursuant to Section 9 of
Chapter 30B).
• No majority vote approval for contract duration longer than 3 years.
• May have to rebid if no responsive/certified bidders respond.
• Sound business practices allowed for purchases valued less than $1,000 only.
• More stringent solicitation of quotes and invitation for bids requirements.
