Massachusetts Has Created a Fossil Fuel Free
Demonstration Program
The Massachusetts Legislature has authorized 10 communities to
implement fossil-fuel free requirements for new construction and major
renovation.
• Part of an Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind (2022)

The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources has developed
regulations and a suggested ordinance (‘model ordinance’).
• Final regulations were sent to Legislature in mid-May.
• Communities in the demonstration are required to provide justification if
making changes to the model ordinance and seek DOER approval

rule petition requesting this authority
in 2021 (submitted April 2022), so we
are a Prioritized Community.

A city or town must meet 10%
affordable housing requirement or

• If a Prioritized Community drops out,
DOER may select a substitute
community. Somerville and Boston
have both voted to move home rule
petitions forward.

• Adopting the code as soon as the state makes
it possible
• Eliminating pathways for fossil fuel use in

Massachusetts’s climate roadmap has identified the importance
of decarbonizing new buildings
• From the state Decarbonization Roadmap:

• “New construction offers the easiest and most
economically attractive way to start
decarbonizing the buildings sector…”
• “Almost all new buildings can cost-effectively
pursue an efficient electric design that increases
occupant comfort and pays for itself...”

• Research has also identified the indoor air
quality and health benefits of fossil fuel free
buildings
• Requiring fossil fuel free construction also
prevents developers from installing new gas
infrastructure that will have to be removed
later on.
• Any new fossil fuel systems would need be
replaced by 2050, as would the new gas pipe.

The Fossil Fuel Free Demonstration Program applies to new
buildings that will be built and to major renovation projects
New buildings are covered by Fossil Fuel Free, including the construction of
new residential, commercial, and institutional buildings as well as additions to
buildings.
Major renovations are covered by Fossil Fuel Free and defined in the state
regulation, typically meaning alteration of 50% or more of building area or
above a certain square footage by building use type.
Exempted per state regulation: hospitals, medical offices, and laboratories.
•
Laboratories are defined by their ventilation requirements.
•
Medical offices are narrowly defined as those receiving licensure from
the Department of Public Health (e.g., clinical facilities, surgical centers,
adult day health).

The Department of Energy Resources (DOER) has developed
a “model” ordinance for the Fossil Fuel Free Demonstration
Program
What the model ordinance covers

• A building cannot use coal, oil, natural gas, or other fossil fuels in its operation
• This is includes heating, hot water systems, lighting, cooking, and clothes drying,
and many commercial process loads (e.g., restaurants, dry cleaners)

• A city or town may propose limited exemptions or changes to model ordinance with
justification

• The model ordinance is based on the new Specialized building code (which City
Council voted to adopt in January) and basically eliminates options that allow for
fossil fuel use, with two clarifications:
• It allows gas or propane use for multifamily water heating until 2027
• It spells out that major renovations cannot install new fossil fuel equipment for
heating, hot water, cooking, etc.

The state adjusted its deadlines for Fossil Fuel Free (FFF),
resulting in an expedited community engagement process
• In draft regulations released on December 23, 2022, DOER indicated that the deadline for submitting
proposed ordinance language would be November 10, 2023
• On May 10, 2023, DOER released its final regulations, which set the application deadline for
September 1, 2023—two months earlier than previously indicated
• As a result, CDD needed to complete community engagement for FFF on an expedited timeline

We undertook a research process to review potential
changes to the model ordinance
We retained consultant services (ARUP) to conduct a technical review of
the fossil fuel free requirements as they would apply to new buildings
and major renovation projects in Cambridge.

ARUP reviewed building types and building systems and underlying code
to identify where exemptions or waivers may be appropriate.
We also had ARUP review the specific concerns that the survey
responses and webinar questions identified regarding how new and
renovated buildings would comply.

We also estimated how many building projects per year
could be required to be fossil fuel free
Residential
New, 7%

Residential
Reno, 2%

Based on available permitting data, in the past four
calendar years (2019-2022), the following range of
projects per year would have been affected:
Commercial
- New projects: 5-20
- Renovations: 240-380
Residential
- New Projects: 15-30
- Renovations: 1-10
• Commercial – Projects that were Level 3 OR greater than 20,000 ft2
• Residential – Projects that were both Level 3 AND greater than 1,000 ft2
• Data is limited to past 5 years, which were impacted by COVID

Commercial
New, 5%

Commercial
Reno, 87%

Of commercial renovations,
>70% per year are
larger developers

The feedback we received focused on a few key themes (1/2)
• Request to exempt backup generation and restaurant cooking equipment
• Included in proposed ordinance

• Concern over exemptions of labs and medical buildings
• These exemptions are mandated by the state

• Seeking clarity on definition of Major Renovation
• Detailed in proposed ordinance

• Question about cost impacts; request for education on making retrofits, help
finding qualified contractors and financial support for making upgrades:
• State has identified cost-effectiveness of all-electric construction with savings over
time; state and federal incentives for all-electric systems are significant

• Electrify Cambridge and other city programs to connect residents and
businesses with technical support and utility/state incentives; City will dedicate
ARPA funding to further incentivize building upgrades

The feedback we received focused on a few key themes (2/2)
• Concerns about whether grid will keep up with demand:
• Waiver process included in proposed ordinance. Cambridge is working with
Eversource on capacity planning in support of decarbonization policies.

• Question whether existing gas stoves must be replaced:
• The regulation only applies to new construction and major renovation; in
renovation, there is no requirement to remove fossil fuel equipment

• Question whether all-electric technologies are available to provide heating
and cooling:
• These technologies are available for most building types; DOER has exempted
laboratories, hospitals and certain medical facilities due to concern that allelectric technologies for high ventilation buildings may not be available yet.

• Question about how gas infrastructure will be phased out:
• The state Decarbonization Roadmap lays out an approach for drawing down gas
infrastructure in an orderly process by 2050.

Based on technical review and public input, we are proposing
specific changes to the model ordinance
The proposed ordinance that CDD is submitting is based on:
• A review of feedback received through community engagement
• A review of all-electric technologies for different building types and
systems
• Justification for proposing limited changes to the model ordinance
In the following slides, we will present the changes proposed.

Proposed changes to the model ordinance (1/3)
Clarifying that, in a major renovation, fossil fuel free would only apply to
the permitted work area and would not impact other areas of the
building not under construction.

Simplifying the definition of major renovations to include alterations
that:
• Reconstruct 50% or more of a residential building and exceed 1000 sq. ft.
• Reconstruct 50% or more of a non-residential building or exceed 20,000
sq. ft.

Proposed changes to the model ordinance (3/3)
The following waiver provisions would be added:

• An applicant would be able to apply to ISD for a waiver, provided that the
appropriate documentation is supplied, for:
• Manufacturing process loads that cannot be built all-electric
• Historic buildings
• Building systems for which sufficient electric service isn’t available at the
time of occupancy (with a commitment to electrify once service is available)
• ISD is authorized to develop regulations that specify the waiver application process.
• The ordinance would go into effect on January 1, 2024 or three months after
approval by DOER, whichever is later, applying to new building permit applications.
