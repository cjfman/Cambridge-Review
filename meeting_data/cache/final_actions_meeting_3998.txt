Alewife District Plan Recommendations

Quadrangle Street
Types

Grade-Separated Bicycle Lane

Bicycle Lane

Spinelli Place, Mooney Street, and portions of
Fawcett Street should include a grade-separated bicycle lane within the road design.

This street type recommends the inclusion of an onstreet bicycle lane along Moulton Street and Wheeler
Street.

Communication: 180 Fawcett St_20211207 (Public Hearings)

Due to the rate of development in
the Quadrangle, it is likely that most
streets will be upgraded and new
streets will be constructed. The
plan below outlines the preferred bicycle facilities and associated street
types per street. The street types
located on the right are illustrative
of the preferred dimensions, mix of
pedestrian, bicycle, vehicular uses,
and landscape buffer spaces.

Pavement Marking

Elevated Walkway with Grade-Separated
Bicycle Lane
Most of the light industrial and retail spaces within
the Quadrangle will be located along Smith Place,
Wilson Road, and portions of Fawcett Street. To
ensure continuous access to elevated first floors, a
publicly-accessible elevated walkway is recommended on private property adjacent to the public rightsof-way on these streets. Included within the public
rights of way are a traditional at-grade sidewalk, a
grade-separated bicycle lane, vehicular lanes, and
street parking.

Shared Lane Pavement Marking
This street type recommends shared lane pavement
markings, such as sharrows, on mid-block streets
(see map).
