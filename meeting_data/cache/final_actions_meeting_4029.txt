Please find attached an order requesting the appropriation and authorization to borrow

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Please find attached an order requesting the appropriation and authorization to borrow
$37,000,000 to provide additional funds for the construction of improvements at the Fire Station
Headquarters Building located at 491 Broadway.
In FY19 this project was initially planned as an “alteration” and was funded with a $25 million
dollar appropriation. However, as the project proceeded it became clear that a larger scope was
required as part of a complete rehabilitation of this historic building.
This project now includes a new data center for emergency communications, a net zero
emissions building with energy producing solar panels and geothermal wells, a sub-station to
accommodate the energy requirements for an all-electric building including charging stations,
and construction phasing. These new elements coupled with significant construction escalation,
schedule delays and temporary facility siting account for the increased amount required for the
project.
The project schedule calls for the construction of the new data center to begin in the fall 2022.
As the new data center is switched over, the renovations to the main building will begin mid-year
2023 with an estimated completion date of late 2025.
With the approval of this recommendation, the renovated Fire Headquarters building will be a
net zero emissions building with updated training and living quarters, that will also provide for
the safety of firefighters with a decontamination system to clean bunker gear and equipment of
hazardous materials from a fire; and a new emergency communication data center, which will
serve the fire operations for decades to come.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale

Shockingly erroneous handling of properly filed letter

On behalf of Friends of the White Geese, I strongly object to Communication 13 on the final actions for May
9. Our letter SUBJECT: "Positive News on the Grand Junction, WITH MAJOR CAVEATS"
OUR letter was submitted on Monday, May 9, 2022, for the “next city council meeting.”
Placing it in “final actions” for May 9, 2022 is extremely incorrect. It hides our letter from public or even city
Council view.
PLEASE PLACE IT IN THE COMMUNICATIONS FOR May 16, 2022
Thank you.

Handling of our hand delivered letter.

Mr. Clerk:
Following up on our recent email.
To, hopefully, prevent any further mishandling of our letter RE: “Positive News on the Grand Junction, WITH MAJOR CAVEATS”
hand delivered on May 9, 2022.
The following is the comment to the clerk immediately following the addresses:
“Mr. Clerk: This is being transmitted to you in two originals, one for the City Council at its next meeting after today in adequate time
to be placed as a communication on the agenda. The other is for the Finance Committee for receipt in time for its next meeting, May
10, 2022.”
“next meeting after today” is not ambiguous.

Rat Problem

> I don’t think the rat problem will be touched by changing carts.
> And I think, at least in this area, people are really good about properly taking care of their trash as directed by the city.
> I live near the fire station at Huron, Garden, and Sherman Streets in Cambridge.
> There is a lot of development in this area, including and especially on my small dead end street, Winslow Street.
> I have lived here in this place since 1989, and rented before that across the street. So I have lived on this street
combined almost 40 years.
> We never had rats, until Bill Senne, a developer, bought the property across the street, and built 5 town houses. They
have finally finished 3 of the five. The building has gone on and on and on over years and years. Up until recently, there
was practically always an open dumpster. However, while the dumpsters are gone, the rat problem is here! They were
fed and multiplied over all those years.
> The workers throw their leftover pizza boxes, and whatever trash they have, etc, etc, etc, into them. Of course the
workers don’t think or don’t care; they don’t live here. I have seen rats run in and out of the dumpsters. For one,
probably a hole for drainage. We did not have rats before the developer (in particular this developer) and construction
came, and now we do. We are overwhelmed with them.
> Cambridge supposedly has a Rat Program (with Waltham Pest Services) for small building with 4 units or less. They
(Waltham Services) came out, put a couple traps around our building, and took them away after a few months, even
though there was clearly still a rat problem. I was shoveling my driveway this past winter and a rat ran by, just a few feet
from me, not concerned in the slightest about my presence.
> I take a walk regularly in my neighborhood. There is development, construction and remodeling WITH HUGE
DUMPSTERS everywhere I go.
> Another area of concern is trash collection. I believe that trash collectors work very hard, and it is a physically
demanding job. Plus they probably feel pressure to do the job as fast as possible. I am very grateful that they collect my
trash each week. However there is inevitably and consistently trash that misses the truck and is left on the street. I
imagine this also contributes to the rat and trash problem. I would like to see the city focus on the developers,
construction, the dumpsters, and on their workers doing the gutting, building, electrical, plumbing, etc, and trash pick
up, all of which contribute to the problem! I wish they would deal directly with at least a couple of the HUGE sources of
the rat problem.

Hi,
I have a short public comment, with an image of Terminal Road's connection. Can I email you and the
Council with both text and image on the same page?
I assume that the image will not show up in the public comment when I speak on Monday.
Attached is the DRAFT so you can see what it looks like.

Written Comment on The Climate Crisis Working Group Findings and Recommendation
(Please add Item to Upcoming City Council Agenda)

Written Comment onThe Climate Crisis Working Group Findings Recommendation
Peace Be Unto You;
Dear Cambridge,
My written comment is a brief critique of a few items in the recently released Climate Crisis Working Group Findings
and. Recommendations. The specific item that I offer a reaction to is found in Appendix A. on pg. 31, entitled “Anything
We Missed.” This item is found at the very end of the document. It pertains to what if anything was missing from the
Findings and Recommendations. I think that precise emphasis and coverage of those most affected by the climate crisis
was missing, such as the plight of the homeless and their struggles against the natural elements. The need for homeless
housing as a relief from the climate was missing. For the homeless, housing is a relief from the climate crisis and its
change. The need to prioritize the people most impacted by the climate criis was not covered at all. The working group
missed this in total.
The working group seems to concentrate on everything environmental except those affected the most by the climate
crisis and climate change, and they are the homeless, in which a disproportionate number are black men, women, and
children. Climate crisis and climate change, and racial injustice share the same roots, and have to be addressed together,
and that was also missing in the working group’s findings and recommendation. There is no climate action that is not
also about racial equity, diversity inclusion, and justice for the most vulnerable segments of the community.
There is a long history of racism in the mainstream environmental, built by people who cared about things like,
conservation, wild life, trees, open space, but didn’t care about poor black peoples, and other impoverished segments of
the community
We need to be able to prioritize the people that are going to be most impacted.
The findings and recommendations don't fortify support for underserved communities and don't support
equitable community development for all people. Mass layoffs and other economic disruptions in the wake of
the pandemic are drastically increasing the number of people at risk of homelessness. This is especially true in
Massachusetts, which was coping with a homelessness crisis and a severe housing shortage before COVID-19 became an
issue.
The working group missed reporting on and supporting planning efforts, policy changes and legislation that facilitate
higher density housing (especially affordable housing) near transit as an essential strategy for cities to meet climate
change goals by reducing building and transportation emissions.
The working group missed encouraging conversation around the connection between climate change
and racial equity. Though climate change will affect all people in Cambridge, many (homeless) are more
vulnerable to climate change. Climate change will have a greater negative effect on this group.
Finally, the importance of social equity in addressing the climate crisis and climate change, was totally
excluded in the working group’s released of its findings and recommendations.

WHEREAS:

For many years, Cambridge was home to a monthly LGBTQ+ Dinner known as
“Kate’s Café” – named in honor of the late Kate Thomas – which attracted seniors in
the LGBTQ+ Community from Cambridge, Somerville, and surrounding towns, and
which was originally hosted at Cadbury Common, before moving to Ryles Jazz Club
and then at the S&S Deli in Inman Square; and

WHEREAS:

For so many of the attendees, the majority of whom were Cambridge residents, this
monthly ritual had become an important, standing appointment on their calendar, it
helped create a greater sense of community and solidarity amongst the local LGBTQ+
Community, fulfilling a previously unmet need in the Cambridge area by providing its
members a lively, warm, and enjoyable destination to socialize, and to foster, nurture,
and bolster personal and professional relationships; and

WHEREAS:

As with so many other things, this monthly dinner has been largely derailed by the
Covid-19 pandemic, with two years of difficulty in safely bringing large groups of
people together, and subsequently with the loss of many viable dining locations; and

WHEREAS:

With Covid-19 restrictions continuing to ease, and with the possibility of renewed
attacks from Washington against the rights gained by the LGBTQ+ Community, the
need for the members of this community to once again have a monthly destination to
dine, to reconnect, to fortify, and to strengthen one another becomes all the more
important; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the Executive
Director of the Council on Aging, Somerville and Cambridge Elder Services, and the
Executive Director of Cadbury Common to determine the feasibility of re-establishing
some form of the Kate’s Café Monthly LGBTQ+ Community Dinners either at
Cadbury Common or at another suitable location, and to report back to the City
Council in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge prides itself on being inclusive, and was one of the first in the
Country to declare Cambridge a “Sanctuary City” for all people, which confers
protections to all residents, regardless of immigration status; and

WHEREAS:

LGBTQIA+ rights are under attack across the country, with State Houses limiting
transgender children’s rights – particularly around life affirming health care, the
recently passed “Don’t Say Gay” law in Florida that is now being proposed in over a
dozen states, recent book bans that target books with LGBTQIA+ characters, and
more; and

WHEREAS:

The leaked Supreme Court of the United States draft opinion regarding Roe v. Wade
contained language that signaled future uncertainty of other landmark cases that were
decided in the Supreme Court, such as Obergefell v. Hodges, which provide basic
protections and the right to gay marriage, and others; and

WHEREAS:

There is a need to declare a similar sanctuary or refuge status on the City of Cambridge
for our LGBTQIA+ residents; and

WHEREAS:

Recognizing a need to create a dedicated team to focus on issues of LGBTQ+
residents, the City of Boston just established an “Office of LGBTQ+ Advancement”
which will be “tasked with empowering, protecting and promoting the rights, dignity,
and advancement of Boston’s LGBTQ+ residents. This office will be responsible for
developing policy, community oriented programming, and providing resources for the
city’s multiracial, multigenerational, multicultural and multilingual LGBTQ+
community.”; and

WHEREAS:

Currently the Cambridge LGBTQ Commission shares an Executive Director with the
Commission on Immigrant Right and Citizenship and the Human Rights Commission;
and

WHEREAS:

The LGBTQIA+ community in Cambridge should have dedicated leadership in the

•
•
•

•

•
•

Advising steps to declare a sanctuary or refuge status in Cambridge
An action plan, with necessary steps, to become the most LGBTQIA+ friendly
City in the Country
LGBTQ+ friendly housing options, including and especially for seniors

2021
Working with the Community Development Department to ensure that safe
space needs to support our LGBTQIA+ residents is discussed as part of new
development
Making Cambridge a refuge for transgender children and their families from
other states as they access critical medical care
Providing access to LGBTQIA+ focused legal assistance and mental health
services; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City of Cambridge go on record affirming our continued commitment and
support of our LGBTQIA+ community members; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the appropriate City
staff to determine the feasibility of hiring a dedicated Executive Director for the

provide the necessary funding for this department.

The City of Cambridge has a decades-long vision to invigorate the Alewife Quad,
making it a livable and lively area for residents; and

WHEREAS:

Many have viewed a connection at Terminal Road as a way to alleviate some traffic
congestion and make the area more walkable; and

connection to be built; and

WHEREAS:

The 55 Wheeler Street project appropriated funds to study the possibility of a

was composed of Councillor Azeem, Councillor Nolan, Councillor McGovern and myself, and we have
met in executive session over the last two weeks to interview Mr. McCann and discuss his references.
Please find attached to this communication his resume and cover letter.
Mr. McCann has been with the City of Cambridge since 2021 in the Auditing Department as the Manager
of Fiscal Reporting, and prior to that held the position of Comptroller at the Massachusetts Port Authority
for over a decade. He also previously worked at the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority and the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, both in high level fiscal management positions. Mr. McCann
has prior experience at KPMG and holds knowledge on both sides of the fiscal auditing experience.
The Mayor will be calling a special meeting for the City Council members to publicly interview Mr.
McCann, and for the body to deliberate whether a formal extension of an offer of employment should be
made to this candidate.
I am available to answer any questions the body may have.
Thank you,

Communicating Information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
The District planning process is moving forward. Later this month, we will kick off discussions
with the School Committee about the outcomes that will be used to set goals and measure
progress towards those goals. The District Plan sets the foundation of our work for the next few
years and is a roadmap for improved outcomes that we desire for our schools.
Due to an increase in the number of COVID cases and COVID-related hospitalizations within
our community, we are encouraging our entire school community to mask, particularly when we
are indoors. Please note that CPS is NOT reinstating a requirement but advising mask use based
on current data.
Dr. Turk will be leading the process for the Math Coordinator position and is currently compiling
an interview committee. Interviews will begin on May 20th. CPS is also screening applicant
resumes to begin the process for the Chief of Academics & School position to prepare for
upcoming interviews over the next couple of weeks.
A reminder that Speakfully, our updated Incident Reporting System, launched last week. Any
member of the school community can submit a report regarding inappropriate conduct, such as
discrimination, harassment, retaliation, bullying other civil rights violations or other areas of
concern through Speakfully. For more information, visit the CPS website.
*It is important to note that Speakfully does not replace the ability of any member of the school
community to initiate a complaint verbally with a Principal or any CPS staff member at any
time.
