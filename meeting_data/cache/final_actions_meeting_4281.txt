PLANNING BOARD
CITY HALL ANNEX, 344 BROADWAY, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139

Date:

December 21, 2022

Subject:

Patrick Barrett, et al., Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board does NOT RECOMMEND adoption.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On December 20, 2022, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss a
Zoning Petition by Patrick Barrett, et al., to amend the Zoning Map and Articles 4.000 (Use
Regulations), 5.000 (Development Standards), and 6.000 (Parking and Loading Requirements) of
the Zoning Ordinance (the “Petition”). The Petition would rezone the area bounded by
Massachusetts Avenue, Cedar Street, and Alberta Terrace, which is currently zoned Business A2 (BA-2) and Residence B, to a new base zoning district “Business A-5” (BA-5). It would also
expand the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District, which currently covers part of that area, to
cover the entire area. The resulting zoning would allow increased density for residential uses and
building heights up to 80 feet.
Following public comment and discussion among Board members, the Planning Board voted to
transmit an unfavorable recommendation on this Petition to the City Council, with the following
comments.
Board members expressed differing opinions on the substance of the proposal. However, Board
members agreed that a development proposal for this site should follow a more thorough
planning process addressing the entire area and incorporating more input from the larger
community. The City Council has requested that a planning study of northern Massachusetts
Avenue be commenced in 2023, and Board Members supported waiting for that process to be
completed.
The Planning Board voted 7-0 in favor of transmitting the above recommendation. One member
was absent.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Mary Flynn, Vice Chair.

Summary of Petition Effects
The effects of the Petition are limited to the area bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, Cedar Street, and
Alberta Terrace (“Rezoning Area”). This triangular-shaped area contains two lots, which are separated by
a portion of Harvey Street that intersects Cedar Street and Massachusetts Avenue. See attached map.
Currently, the portion of the Rezoning Area within 100 feet of Massachusetts Avenue is zoned Business
A-2 (BA-2) and is within the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District (MAOD). The remainder of the area,
further than 100 feet from Massachusetts Avenue, is currently zoned Residence B (Res. B).
The Petition proposes to rezone the entire Rezoning Area to a new zoning designation Business A-5 (BA5), and to expand the MAOD to the entire Rezoning Area. The MAOD standards are not proposed to be
amended, but several proposed footnotes are intended to supersede some MAOD requirements.

Barrett, et al., Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

Barrett, et al., Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

The zoning for northern Massachusetts Avenue contains multiple layers of regulations that need to be
combined to get the total picture, some of which are newer and others of which are vestiges from older
times. It is like an old house that has been painted over multiple times in many different colors,
sometimes only in parts.
The following is a summary of the zoning history of the Rezoning Area and northern Massachusetts
Avenue in general.
•

From 1943-1961, the Rezoning Area was zoned Business A, which had a 60-foot height limit and few
other dimensional requirements. From 1961-1986 it was zoned Business B, which had no height
limit, a 4.0 FAR limit, and required 300 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit. During this time,
Massachusetts Avenue north of Harvard Square was a mix of Business A, Business B, Business C, and
several higher-density residential districts.

•

In 1986, there was a comprehensive rezoning of Massachusetts Avenue north of Harvard Square,
based on a planning study. The Rezoning Area and its surroundings were rezoned to a new Business
C-1 district, while other sections of the commercial corridor were rezoned to a new Business A-2
district. Porter Square remained Business C.

Max. Residential FAR
3.00
1.75

Max. Height

45’

•

The 1986 rezoning included the creation of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District. Like other
overlay districts created around that time, the purpose was to apply detailed development
standards and advisory review procedures based on urban design objectives. The design-based
standards focused on encouraging pedestrian-friendly buildings with active ground floors,
articulated building façades, and clear windows. Proposals that did not meet all the detailed
standards could seek approval for modifications by special permit from the Planning Board. The
North Massachusetts Avenue Urban Design Guidelines were published to guide Planning Board
review and advisory review.

•

In 1991, the Rezoning Area (along with most other BC-1 areas) was rezoned to BA-2, except that the
portion more than 100 feet from Massachusetts Avenue was rezoned to Residence B. Previously,
the entire Rezoning Area was included in the Business district.

•

Some zoning changes adopted in the early 2000s were relevant to this area. In 2005, the threshold
to require a public advisory review meeting in the MAOD was lowered from 6,000 square feet to
2,000 square feet of GFA. In 2007, the threshold for requiring a Project Review Special Permit in the
BA, BA-1, and BA-2 districts was lowered from 50,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet of GFA.

•

In 2012, the “North Mass Ave” zoning was adopted following recommendations from the North
Cambridge Neighborhood Study. The main goal of this zoning was to better encourage mixed-use
development with active ground stories. In previous years, some larger residential developments
had been built with little to no ground story retail.

Background

a

•

In 2016, after a resident-led zoning petition, the North Mass Ave zoning was expanded to cover all
areas within the MAOD with a BA-2 base zoning, north and south of Porter Square. (At the same
time, another resident-led zoning petition was adopted which excluded the area north of Richard
Avenue from the North Mass Ave zoning.)

The North Mass Ave zoning (Section 20.110 of the Zoning Ordinance, now applicable to almost all areas
with a BA-2 base and MAOD overlay) can be described as an “overlay on an overlay,” applying in
addition to the general MAOD standards in specific areas. It adjusts the base development standards to
allow 4-story mixed-use development, so long as the ground story contains “active” space such as retail,
certain types of office, or certain types of institutional use. There is a minimum height, depth, and
frontage of active space, subject to modification by Planning Board special permit. Exceptions can be
made in the case of historically residential buildings or by Planning Board special permit if active use is
found to be infeasible. The total FAR for a mixed-use project is 1.75 and maximum height is 50 feet, to
allow for a taller ground story. If a non-mixed-use project is permitted, the FAR is limited to 1.00, and
height is limited to 45’ (residential) or 35’ (non-residential).
Massachusetts Avenue was identified in the Envision Cambridge comprehensive plan as an area for
further study, with the goal of providing area-specific recommendations for zoning changes and
development guidelines. The City Council adopted a Policy Order in September, 2022, requesting that
CDD begin a study in 2023.
Considerations
It is difficult to evaluate the proposed zoning against the City’s planning goals. The previous planning
study that formed the basis for the current zoning is over 35 years old, and the zoning has been adjusted
several times since that original study based on changing priorities. In some respects, the proposed BA-5
zoning reflects the pre-1986 zoning for this area.
Increasing the zoning capacity for housing in a mixed-use area is generally consistent with the Envision
Cambridge planning recommendations. However, Envision Cambridge also calls for area-specific
planning in order to decide what zoning standards should be implemented.
Without area-specific planning objectives or priorities, the following considerations are meant to guide
general discussion of the proposed zoning compared to planning and zoning principles applied
throughout the city.
Geographic Area
The history of zoning along northern Massachusetts Avenue is complex and layered, as is the current
zoning. The existing patterns of development are similarly complex and at times chaotic, containing a
wide variety of buildings with different uses, sizes, and ages.
The Petition proposes to rezone only one small section of this corridor. The Petition does not explain
why this specific area is proposed to be rezoned and not others. The sites in the Rezoning Area have
older buildings and lower-density development relative to some nearby sites. The Rezoning Area is at a
key intersection, but not the busiest in the corridor, and excludes other sites near the same intersection.

Barrett, et al., Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

a

Rezoning this small section would continue the trend of varied and eclectic development patterns along
Massachusetts Ave. That could be a positive or negative result, depending on one’s attitudes about
varied and eclectic development patterns. The proposed change would also eliminate what is currently a
“split-lot” zoning, and would restore the original “Business” designation of the area that is commercial in
use but was rezoned to Residence B.
As a technical matter, where it is proposed to create a new base zoning district, that district should be
listed in Article 3.000 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Development Scale and Density
The proposed BA-5 zoning would have a permitted height and density similar to what is currently
permitted in Harvard Square and Central Square. The distinction is that the proposed BA-5 would only
permit increased height and density for residential uses, while Harvard Square and Central Square
permit greater height and density for non-residential uses as well. Residential uses would be permitted
at a greater height and density than in Porter Square, but non-residential uses would be permitted at a
similar scale. Per Section 5.30.11, “residential” uses in this context would exclude hotels.
The proposed change would result in a large difference between the allowed height in the Rezoning
Area (80’) and the allowed height in abutting districts (35’-50’). For developments greater than 25,000
square feet, this variation could trigger provisions in Section 19.52, which limits building cornice lines to
no more than 20’ higher than the height limit of an abutting zoning district, with bulk control
requirements for building sections above that cornice line.
The proposal would exempt “all ground-floor commercial spaces” from FAR calculations, which
potentially removes the complication of applying the “mixed-use formula” in Section 5.30.12 to a
project with residential development above ground-story retail. However, it could also have
unanticipated consequences by excluding all “commercial spaces” (a term which is not defined in the
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance) instead of specific uses that are desired to meet area objectives. As an
example, the proposed zoning might allow a two-story office/lab building without setbacks (an effective
FAR of 2.0) by exempting the ground story.
Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District Standards
The proposed zoning would retain the MAOD designation for the entire area. Some design standards
would continue to apply, such as requiring clear windows and street-facing pedestrian entrances, and
prohibiting parking at the ground story. However, the proposed zoning contains footnotes that would
waive or supersede some requirements of the MAOD. In particular, a proposed footnote waives some of
the active use requirements (Section 20.110.21) applicable in BA-2 areas that were originally created in
the “North Mass Ave” zoning amendment. A substantial development without active use along
Massachusetts Avenue might not be a desirable outcome.
As a practical matter, it is not clear that these footnotes are necessary. By rezoning the area to BA-5, the
requirements applicable in BA-2 districts would arguably no longer be applicable to the Rezoning Area.
Moreover, it is confusing to write provisions into base zoning that are intended to supersede overlay
district requirements. Base zoning requirements should apply except to the extent that they are

a

modified by overlay zoning requirements. Amending the MAOD, where desired, would be a clearer
approach than writing base requirements that are intended to supersede it.
Development Review
By keeping the Rezoning Area in the MAOD, the proposal would retain the advisory review procedures
that require a non-binding public meeting for any development proposal of at least 2,000 square feet.
Changing the base zoning from BA-2 to BA-5 would increase the threshold for a Project Review Special
Permit from 20,000 square feet – the lower threshold that was enacted in 2007 – to the general citywide
threshold of 50,000 square feet. A higher project review threshold could remove impediments to new
development by making the review process less burdensome for medium-scale projects, but the
absence of a binding design review could result in worse urban design outcomes.

Proposed BA-5 Zone

a

On Jan 3rd we presented our petition to the ordinance committee and were tasked by several
City Council members to do more outreach and discuss further the development plans for the newly
created BA-5 subdistrict to the Mass Ave. Overlay with the abutters, neighbors, and community.
•

•

•

To date we have met with the abutters, neighborhood, and community five additional times on
Jan 18th, Jan 21st, Feb 9th, Feb 21st, and Feb 23rd. A community member also distributed flyers to
the neighborhood alerting them to our meetings and attendance was robust. During these
meetings members of the public brought issues ranging from construction disturbance to the
relative height and encroachment of their properties. Everyone was civil and engaged.
The neighbors and abutters created a list of concerns which we address in a document that
we’ve all worked on which we call simply a “letter of commitment” attached hereto and
incorporated herein. This letter represents a commitment by the developer to proceed on
agreed upon terms should any zoning be approved. There is a mutual understanding that while
this commitment letter is not binding to the City of Cambridge, we all feel this is a good solution
to satisfy the concerns and reinforce the commitment of North Cambridge Partners to work with
the neighbors and abutters to build much needed housing for the area and also protect their
homes in the process.
I’ve attached the letter of commitment and the massing study that it references. We humbly
ask that the Council seriously consider our proposal and our commitment to the neighborhood,
and see our efforts for what they are: a good faith proposal to create much needed housing that
will be for sale, and to help nurture a community with which we have gratefully been able to
reach collaborative agreement.

Regards,

Patrick W. Barrett III, Esq.

This letter of commitment (the “LOC”) dated February 24, 2023, by and between North
Cambridge Partners LLC (“NCP”) with a business address of 9 South Street, Chestnut Hill, MA
02467 and the abutting neighbors of Alberta Terrace, Cedar Street, and Harvey Street (the
“Neighbors”) located at various addresses along Alberta, Cedar, and Harvey, (together
hereinafter the “Parties”).

BACKGROUND

A) The Parties wish to enter into an agreement as outlined in this LOC in relation to a
proposed zoning change and development of a project located in part of the proposed
BA-5 zoning district located at 2400-2414 Massachusetts Avenue (the “Project”).
B) The Parties wish to record their understandings and agreements in relation to what zoning
will be passed, how it will be implemented, and various aspects related to construction,
maintenance, and precautionary measures relating to the Project.
C) Developer Statement: NCP is committed to working collaboratively with the surrounding
neighbors, and to inviting them to share and develop a collective vision for the
neighborhood. NCP acknowledges that material deviation from this MOU with the
neighborhood would constitute a substantial detriment for the purposes of special permit
review with the City of Cambridge.

1) Purpose and Project. This LOC sets out the basic terms upon which the Neighbors
would consent to NCP proceeding with the requested zoning change filed in October
2022 with the City of Cambridge (subject to the requested amendments below), and the
Project brought by NCP that is a result of that zoning change. The project is a mixed use,
ground-up development that will consist of both residential condominium units for sale

NCP agrees as part of its work with the City of Cambridge to create a safe,
pedestrian, and bike friendly plan for the Project. This includes the widening of
sidewalks, illustrated in the massing study attached hereto, showing 11’ on
Alberta Terrace and Cedar St and at least 7.5’ on Harvey St.
NCP will work with Neighbors, and especially direct abutters, to protect their
properties during construction to limit impact of noise, rodents, and debris from
impacting quality of life within the area of work. NCP will work directly with
abutters on a case-by-case basis to address disruption inconveniences; this may
include, for example, the offer of discounted co-working space, noise cancelling
headphones, or some other mutually agreed upon resolution.
NCP is committed to creating a blend of private and public green and/or
permeable open space within the site, which will total at least 15% of the lot area.

trash pickup schedule and rodent control plan. Garbage, recycling, composting (if
any), and EV charging will be located in a proposed underground parking facility
provided this does not violate any ordinance in the City of Cambridge or any
requirements of the local utility.
NCP is committed to regular consultation with the neighborhood through the
zoning process, planning/design, and all aspects of the project as it proceeds
through the review process with the City of Cambridge, and to mitigating quality
of life concerns to the best of NCP’s ability during construction.
NCP commits to building a project that will not be a “fortress” such as closing all
four sides of the locus. NCP commits to having some portion of the site open to
the neighborhood.

3) Term and Termination. The understandings and agreements outlined in this MOU shall
subsist until such time as the Project receives a certificate of occupancy from the City of
Cambridge, and all remaining landscaping, construction, and other project related work is
completed.
4) Complete Agreement. This Agreement embodies the complete agreement and
understanding among the parties and supersedes and preempts any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.
