>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL BE BY ROLL CALL.
WE'LL OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. PURSUANT TO THE RULE WE DON'T HAVE
MORE THAN 20 SIGNED UP. I ASK FOR THOSE WHO SIGNED UP, STATE YOUR
NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND THE ITEM ON THE AGENDA THAT
YOU ARE SPEAKING ON. FIRST PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS ALLAN, FOLLOWED
BY CHRISTOPHER.
>> HI, I'M ALLAN. 24 UNION STREET. I WILL SPEAK ABOUT APPLICATION AND
PETITION NUMBER TWO. THE CITY COUNCIL ADVISE ME TO TRY HUMANITY,
SO I WILL DO MY BEST TO BE KIND. I FIND THE PETITIONS DISAPPOINTING.
THERE ARE OVER 21,000 HOUSEHOLDS ON CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY
WAITLIST. THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IS AT THE TOP OF EVERY POLL.
PEOPLE LIVE IN PATIENT'S ATTIC OR ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
AFFORD AN APARTMENT. WITH THE PETITIONS SAY, NO WE DON'T NEED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE NEED GREATER SETBACKS AND MORE PARKING
SPACES. IF THAT KILLS THE PROJECT OR THE PLANET, SO BE IT. IT IS JUST

STAGGERING. I'M NOT AGAINST TAKING A SECOND LOOK AT THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY. IT HAS SUCCESSES, OVER 340 AFFORDABLE
HOMES, BUT ALL ARE EASILY ACQUISITION. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCENARIOS THAT WE HOPED FOR. AND THERE WAS A
SET OF ACQUISITION AT WILLIAM AND PEARL STREET THAT I'M UPSET ABOUT
WHERE FIVE LUXURY HOMES WILL BE BUILT BECAUSE THE OVERLAY SCENARIO
IS NOT COMPETITIVE ENOUGH AT THE SITE. AND WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE
BZA SHOWING ITSELF INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO COMPREHENSIVE PERMIT
PROPOSALS, THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND THE OVERLAY TO MAKE SURE IT
COVERS SCENARIOS LIKE MASS AVENUE AND BROADWAY PARK. THERE IS
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT CAMBRIDGE NEEDS TO BUILD AND MAKE
SURE WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. MAKE IT
WEAKER? SERIOUSLY? I HOPE THE PETITIONERS ARE LISTENING, I SURE THEY
DON'T REALIZE HOW OUT OF TOUCH THEY SEEM AND I HOPE THEY WILL
RECONSIDER AND WITHDRAW. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS, I DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS, NONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOUGHT
SO HARD TO CREATE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER LAY WANT TO DO
THIS. I HOPE THE PETITIONERS WILL REACH OUT TO US AND HEAR FROM
THOSE WHO CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO WE DON'T
HAVE TO FIGHT ABOUT IT AT THE PLANNING BOARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT.
>> CHRISTOPHER, 17 LAUREL STREET. SPEAKING ON PETITIONS AND
APPLICATIONS 1 AND 2. I WANT TO SPEAK ON THE TWO PETITIONS RELATED
TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY. WHEN IT BEGAN BEING DISCUSSED,
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR HOW IT WAS BUILT OR
WHY THERE WASN'T ENOUGH. DURING THE PROCESS, ONE THING I LEARNED
IS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BUILD NEW HOUSES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES.
WITH LIMITED FUNDING, STEEP REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPENSIVE LAND IN
CAMBRIDGE, IT REALLY, REALLY IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE PROJECTS WORK.
AND EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHARGE, WHETHER IT IS THE PRICE OF LUMBER
GOING UP, REQUIRING DIFFERENT STAIRWELL EXITS OR CHANGING DESIGNS,
IT CAN REALLY KILL A PROJECT AND REALLY DESTROY ITS FINANCIAL VIABILITY
OR OTHER VIABILITY.
THE PETITIONS AS SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONERS IT WOULD KILL EVERY
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY PROJECT THAT IS PROPOSED SO FAR CITY
WIDE. NOT A SINGLE ONE THAT WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE UNDER THE
OVERLAY IF THE PETITIONS WERE TO GO FORWARD. AND THEY ARE SIMPLY
PUT WOULD MAKE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSE, OVERLAY, WHICH IS ALREADY
ONLY SUCCEEDING IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE LAND IS OFTEN
ALREADY AVAILABLE OR ESPECIALLY INEXPENSIVE, IT IS THE ONLY PLACES IT IS
VIABLE. I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY WAS A SET OF COMPROMISES MADE
BETWEEN RESIDENTS, COUNCILLORS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS,
THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND EVERYBODY ELSE TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE
THE BALANCE OF CREATING HOUSING AND ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES THAT
FOLKS CAN DEAL WITH.

I RESPECT THE PETITIONERS, I BELIEVE, THEY ARE ALL VERY CLOSE TO ONE OF
THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT IS BEING THERE. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
FOLKS ARE UPSET ABOUT LOSS OF PARKING, BUILDINGS THAT ARE CLOSER TO
THEM, AND I RESPECT THAT IS A FEELING THAT FOLKS HAVE, BUT IN THE
SAME WAY, I HOPE THAT IF THERE WAS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY
PROJECT GOING UP IN MY BACKYARD, I'D UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS MORE
IMPORTANT TO HOUSE THE PEOPLE AND TO HAVE THE PROJECTS BE BUILT
THAN PROTECT MY PARKING SPACES OR HOW CLOSE A BUILDING IS TO ME
THAT I'D UNDERSTAND THAT. OF COURSE, MY BUILDING IS TWO FEET FROM
THE PROPERTY LINE. THAT'S NOT A THING ANYWAY. I REALLY WANT TO SAY
THIS IS LIKE IT IS NOT A LIGHT DECISION TO MAKE THESE THINGS THAT SEEM
LIKE MINOR CHANGES. I WILL ADD ON PARKING, I THINK THERE WASN'T A
STRONG ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PROCESS. THE CITY AND
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS CAME INTO THIS SAYING WE DON'T USE
MORE THAN POINT FOUR SPACES NOW PER UNIT. HAVING AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, ONE SPACE PER UNIT, THAT WOULD BE A BAD IDEA. IT WOULD
CREATE UNNECESSARY AND WASTED SPACE. THERE'S A NEED TO ENGAGE
MORE WITH THE PROCESS, HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE, AND ENSURE
WE DON'T KILL 350 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MORE GOING
FORWARD OVER CONCERNS OVER ONE PROJECT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES ZALL?
>> JAMES ZALL IS NOT ON. DAVID, GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I'M DAVID. I LIVE AT 115 AUBURN STREET AND I'M SPEAKING ABOUT
APPLICATION 1 AND 2. I WILL ECHO WHAT THE PREVIOUS COMMENTERS
SAID. I THINK THE PEOPLE BRINGING THE INTENTION ARE WELL INTENTION
AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROJECT NEAR THERE AND WANT TO
ASK FOR MINOR TWEAKS. THE TRUTH IS, THESE TWEAKS WILL CAUSE
PROJECTS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY TO ALL BECOME
UNWORKABLE. AND WE NEED TO DECIDE WHO WE WANT TO BE AS A CITY.
DO WE WANT TO LIVE UP TO OUR PROGRESSIVE IDEALS AND BE WELCOMING
AND PROVIDE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT WANT TO LIVE HERE. OR DO
WE WANT TO PUT THINGS LIKE PARKING AND ESTHETICS OF THE BUILDING
FIRST. ON THE ISSUE OF PARKING, WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE CITY IS
WELL DOCUMENTED HOW MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS HAVE A VERY
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AFFORDABILITY. CITIES THAT HAVE MUCH WORSE
WALKABILITY AND TRANSIT OPPORTUNITY, SUCH A MINNEAPOLIS AND
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, HAVE MOVE FORWARD WITH GETTING RID OF
MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS. IT IS A BIG SUCCESS. IF THERE ARE
ISSUES WITH STREET PARKING, THE COUNCIL CAN USE OTHER WAYS TO
ADDRESS THOSE. IT SHOULDN'T FALL ON PEOPLE TRYING TO BUILD...
BUILDING HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH THE PARKING
ISSUES.
ADDING PARKING IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE FOR HOUSING DEVELOPERS. IT
SHOULD BE ON MORE OF THE UPPER INCOME PEOPLE WHERE OWNING A
CAR IN CAMBRIDGE IS A LUXURY TO PAY FOR THOSE COSTS. THANK YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ITAMAR TURNER TRAURING.
>> I LIVE 139 OXFORD STREET AND SPEAK ON THE TWO ZONING PETITIONS.
VERY EXCITED TO SEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TERM AND SEE IT PASS
AND ALL THE AFFORDABLE PROJECTS BEING BUILT. EVERY AFFORDABLE
PROJECT MEETING I HAVE BEEN TO HAS INVOLVED A LOT OF PEOPLE
SHOWING UP AND SAYING... THERE'S GOING TO BE COMPETITION FOR
STREET PARKING SO WE SHOULDN'T BUILD IT. IT SHOULD BE SMALLER AND
LESS PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE. THEY ARE RIGHT, THOSE ARE GIVENS.
DON'T PREVENT HOUSING BEING BUILD AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEING
BUILT THAT IS SOMETHING OF AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CURRENT
SITUATION. I SEE 2072 MASS AVENUE PROJECT, WHICH WAS A LOVELY
BUILDING, PLENTY OF UNITS, IT WAS ALSO KILLED BY THE NEIGHBORS AND
BZA. AND THESE TWO PETITIONS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY ARE
BASICALLY GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY TAKING UP SPACE FOR THINGS THAT AREN'T UNIT
S, PARKING SPOTS MEAN YOU ARE NOT YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM
SOMEWHERE. YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN, LESS ROOM FOR UNITS AND
THINGS LIKE UNDERGROUND GARAGES. THE NUMBERS I HEARD QUOTED A
HUNDRED THOUSAND PER PARKING SPOT. VERY EXPENSIVE. AND WHEN YOU
ARE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS AFFORDABLE, THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF
MONEY.
AND SO, FIRST I HOPE THAT TO UNDERSTAND THE PETITIONS THEY HAVE TO
PASS THE COMMITTEE. I HOPE THEY WILL DIE THERE. SECOND, THE HO
CLEARLY COULD BE IMPROVED. 2072 MASS AVENUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BUILT. I HOPE THAT NEXT TERM WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE HO TO BUILD
IT. AND THIRD, GET RID OF PARKING MINIMUMS FOR ALL CONSTRUCTION,
NOT JUST AHO, BUT TO FIT IN MORE APARTMENTS. IF YOU DO THAT, BOTH
THE AHO AND STANDARD ZONING WILL BE IN SYNC, WHICH I'M SURE WILL
MAKE THE ZONING OFFICE HAPPY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JUSTIN SAIF.
>> HI, JUSTIN. HURLEY STREET. I JOIN THE CHORUS TO KILL THE CREATION
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CAMBRIDGE TO BE CREATED USING THE 100%
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY. AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED, GIVE THE
CHALLENGES OF THE CHANGING CLIMATE AND THE FACT THAT ALL OF
CAMBRIDGE IS REASONABLY ACCESSIBLE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,
MANDATING PARKING IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FOR PROJECTS UNDER THE
100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY.
THEY RAISE THE COST TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CAMBRIDGE AND
THEY PROMOTE CAR OWNERSHIP. WE SHOULD GET RID OF ALL PARKING
MANDATES, NOT ADD THEM FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY.
ASSUMING OUR REGION FINDS A WAY TO STAVE OFF RISING SEA LEVEL,
CAMBRIDGE MAY NEED TO PREPARE ITSELF TO HOST CLIMATE REFUGEES AND
THE WORD. SIMILARLY, THE PROPOSED SETBACK CHANGES WOULD BE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND WE SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOMES
PERMITTED TO BE CREATED USING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY IN
COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS TO ALLOW PROPOSALS TO MOVE FORWARD,

INCLUDING ONES LIKE THAT 2072 MASS AVENUE.
FOR THE PETITIONERS, I URGE YOU TO READ THE CAMBRIDGE HOUSING
AUTHORITY'S PUBLICATION, STORIES OF THE CAN'T WAITLIST. PUBLICATIONS
SHARES STORIES OF THE FEW OF THE 21,000 PEOPLE AND FAMILIES WHO ARE
ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAITLIST. THESE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS,
THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN'S CLASSMATES. RESIDENTS LIVING IN
SUBSTANDARD HOUSING, UNHOUSED RESIDENTS, AND RESIDENTS DISPLACED
FROM CAMBRIDGE ALL TOGETHER WHILE WAITING AND WAITING FOR
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
CAMBRIDGE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER AND CAN'T GO BACKWARD. PLEASE
REJECT THE PETITIONS AND STRENGTHEN THE 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING
OVERLAY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO JAMES ZALL, WHO IS BACK AND THEN
JESSICA SHEEHAN.
>> THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. JAMES, PEMBERTON STREET IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE AND I
SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO APPLICATIONS AND PETITIONS 1 AND 2. A YEAR
AGO, WHEN THIS COUNCIL ORDAINED THE OVERLAY, SOME OPPONENTS OF
ZONING REFORM PREDICTED THAT FEW IF ANY ADDITIONAL UNITS OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD RESULT FROM IT. TODAY THERE ARE 350
UNITS AT FOUR LOCATIONS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE AAHO APPROVAL
PROCESS. THIS NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AFTER DECADES OF
EXCLUSIONARY ZONING, INDICATES IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED AND
STRENGTHENED AND NOT DIMINISHED.
WE NOW HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF NEIGHBORS AND THEY ARE MY
NEIGHBORS, I LIVE ABOUT A TENTH OF A MILE, A FEW MINUTES WALK FROM
WALDEN SQUARE. SMALL GROUP OF NEIGHBORS HAS PROPOSE TWO
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE A CITY WIDE EFFECT. REDUCE THE
NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS TO BE BUILT AND WOULD LIKELY MAKE
SOME OF THE PENDING PROJECTS UNAFFORDABLE AND IMPRACTICAL. IT IS
NOT KEEPING WITH THE HOUSING GOALS, THE COSTS EXPRESSED BY
RESIDENTS AND DISCONNECTED FROM A REGION THAT IS FACING A HOUSING
DEFICIT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP WORK WE HAVE JESSICA SHEEHAN.
>> JESSICA, UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. SANDY, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. I'M SANDY GOULD, AND LIVE IN CAMBRIDGEPORT. I'M HERE
TODAY TO ADVOCATE FOR SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER SEVEN, PLACE A
MEMORIAL IN HONOR OF TOM DOYLE AT THE SOCCER FIELDS NEAR SENT
TRAVEL SQUARE. TOM IS A LONG TIME COACH IN CAMBRIDGE'S SOCCER AND
DIED EARLIER THIS SPRING FROM INJURIES RESULTING FROM A FALL WHILE
CLIMBING. SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE AND TWO SOCCER PLAYER CHILDREN.
TOM WAS A LONG TIME COACH FOR CAMBRIDGE SOCCER AND RAN


PAGE 5

Jun 1, 2020

PRACTICES FOR BOTH HIS CHILDREN'S TEAM AT THE PACIFIC STREET FIELD
EVERY FALL AND SPRING ABOUT TEN WEEKS IN EACH FALL AND SPRING.
AND WE HAVE COME TO ASSOCIATE THAT FIELD WITH HIM. HE WAS A
WONDERFUL COACH, REALLY CARED ABOUT HIS TEAM, DIDN'T REALLY CARE
WHETHER THEY WON OR LOSS, WANTED TO SEE PLAYERS GROW AND
BECOME BETTER ATHLETES AND PEOPLE. THE LOSS IS FELT BY THE SOCCER
COMMUNITY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE CLOSE TO
TOM. THIS PLAQUE WOULD BE A WONDERFUL COMMEMORATION OF HIS
DEVOTION TO THE SOCCER COMMUNITY. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JONATHAN BEHRENS.
>> HI, JONATHAN, 115 HAMPSHIRE STREET. I SPEAK ON APPLICATIONS AND
PETITIONS 1 AND 2. THERE'S NOT A LOT TO SAY THAT MY FELLOW
COMMENTERS NOT ALREADY MENTIONED. EITHER OF THE PROPOSED
CHANGES WOULD HAVE SINGLE HANDEDLY KILLED EVERY PROJECT THAT IS
BROUGHT FORWARD. AFTER DOZENS OF MEETINGS, OVERWHELMING
SUPPORT OF VOTERS AND COUNCILLORS AND A STUNNING SUCCESS THE AHO
HAD. IT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY TO DESTROY THAT. WE ARE IN A DUAL
CLIMATE AND HOUSING CRISIS, SO WE SHOULD CREATE LESS CAR STORAGE
AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHEREAS THE PETITIONS WOULD TAKE
US IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL
CONSIDERATION SO FAR AND HOPE YOU WILL KEEP THESE IN MIND. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LOREN CROWE?
>> LOREN IS NOT ON THE ZOOM. ELLIE, GO AHEAD.
>> I'M UNMUTED NOW. CAN I BE HEARD?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT. I'M ELIE YARDEN, AND SPEAK TO A
COMMUNICATION TRANSMITTED REGARDING THE NEXT STEPS ON
IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL PRE K. I AM TRULY IMPRESSED BY THE
CALMNESS WITH WHICH THE REPORT IS GIVEN. AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO
URGENCY OF ANY SORT. IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH WE HAVE NEVER BEEN
THROUGH A PANDEMIC. SO, LOOKING AT THE TIMELINE S AS WELL AS THE
ASSOCIATION WITH SOCIAL SERVICES, RATHER THAN EDUCATION, I
SOMETIMES WONDER ABOUT THE DEPTH OF COMMITMENT OF THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE TO BEING A CITY OF A PERMANENT UNDER CLASS. IT IS A
RATHER POOR WAY OF DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. MY LAST ATTEMPT
AT DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE HAPPENED DURING THE MANAGERSHIP OF
RICHARD ROSSI, IF ANYBODY WHO REMEMBERS HIM. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF MEETING HIM WITH ME SITTING ON HIS RIGHT SIDE AND ELLEN
SEMONOFF ON HIS LEFT SIDE, SAYING DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH IT
WOULD COST IF WE WERE TO DO WHAT IS BEING SUGGESTED. AT THIS
POINT, MONEY IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FACE BECAUSE CLIMATE
CHANGE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONEY. SO I BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT
HOW MANY BRAINS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED HAVE BEEN LOSS BY THE
FAILURE TO GIVE THEM THE ATTENTION THAT THEY NEED BETWEEN THE

PAGE 6

Jun 1, 2020

AGES OF 2 AND 4.
I SPEAK AS A GRANDPARENT. I HAVE FOUR CLOSE RELATIVES IN THE
CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL SYSTEM. TWO OF THEM NON WHITE, TWO OF THEM
WHITE. I'M IN DAILY CONTACT WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FAILURES
OF EDUCATION IN CAMBRIDGE. AND I BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT THE CITY
COUNCIL THAT MANAGES THE CITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. ARE YOU
FINISHED? WE'LL STOP THE CLOCK. STILL ON THE ZOOM? NO? I THINK THAT
WAS COMPLETE. THIS IS FOR REFERENCE, ITEM THAT IS CALENDARED ON
UNIVERSAL PRE K. NEXT UP, WE HAVE MARILLEE. I WRITE IN FAVOR OF
PETITIONS 1 AND 2, CONCERNING SETBACKS ON OFF STREET PARKING. HOW
CAN CONSIDERING SMALL AMENDMENTS KILL THE ENTIRE OVERLAY.
SETBACKS MAY SHRINK OPEN AND GREEN SPACE, ALL PART OF
ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY, HEALTH BENEFITS, AND SAFETY ISSUES. WHY NOT
LOOK AT IT? LOSS OF CRUCIAL PARKING ALSO NEEDS RESTUDYING, BIKE
LANES AFFECT THE ENTIRE CITY. ISSUES EVERYBODY SUPPORTS,
IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT BALANCED OR TRANSPARENT. NOR ARE TWEAKS
FAVORING CITY WIDE, IT IS FIND TO CONSIDER MORE HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT, DON'T PUSH BACK ON OTHER DIRECTION HELPING
RESIDENTS. IT IS AGEISM AND SEXIST. PARKING SPACES ARE NOW METERED
ON TIGHT NEIGHBORHOODS, OFF STREET PARKING WITH PERMEABLE
SURFACES ARE BEING ELIMINATED. DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE MORE
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE CITY THAN WORK IN THE
CITY INDICATING SOME NEED FOR PARKING. MANY ELECTRIC CARS NEED
CHARGING STATIONS, BIKE LANES MADE PICKUP AND DROP OFF, SHORT TERM
LOADING AND DELIVERIES MORE DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS.
CUSTOMERS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE IMPACTED. WHAT ABOUT
HEALTHCARE WORKERS VISITING NURSES, CONTRACTORS, PARKING CANNOT
BE TOTALLY ELIMINATED AND IT IS ARROGANT AND HOSTILE TO THINK SO. IT
WAS LEFT TO TRAFFIC AND PARKING TO IMPLEMENT, YET THEY SEEM TO
HAVE NOT HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND CITY
WIDE ROLLOUTS, INCLUDING HARVARD SQUARE. OFF STREET PARKING IS
CRUCIAL TO MANY. WE NEED BALANCE AND TRANSPARENCY TO ADDRESS
THIS FOR THE GREATER GOOD. AND BY THE WAY, SOME OF THE HO UNITS
BEING TOUTED WERE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE AND HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY
THE 900,000 DOLLARS A UNIT FOR JACKSON PARK UNITS ESTIMATED. WE
CAN USE THAT MONEY A LITTLE BIT BETTER. WE HAVEN'T STARTED TO LOOK
AT PROGRAMS.
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AND TWEAK IT BECAUSE WE
ARE LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY. AND THE BIGGEST VOICES THERE ARE
BASICALLY BULLIES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE NOW GOING TO HEATHER HOFFMAN AND
HILLARY.
>> 213 HURLEY STREET. FIRST, I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRUCK
RESTRICTION. TRUCK RESTRICTIONS ARE NO GOOD AT ALL IF YOU DON'T


PAGE 7

Jun 1, 2020

HAVE GOOD SIGNAGE. SO, IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TRUCK RESTRICTIONS,
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE SIGNS TO TELL THE TRUCK WHEN THEY
NEED TO KNOW IT FACING THE CORRECT DIRECTION, THEY SHOULDN'T BE
GOING WHERE THEY MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT GOING.
I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE POLICY ORDER ABOUT HOUSING
STABILIZATION. ANYONE WHO HAS LISTENED TO ME OVER THE YEARS HAS
HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS THAT
HAVE GONE UP IN PROFUSION IN EAST CAMBRIDGE AND ALEWIFE, THEY ARE
NOT BUILT FOR STABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE BUILT TO TURN PEOPLE. IF ONE
OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO THAT IS IN OUR CONTROL IS TO FORCE
DEVELOPERS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF BUILDING AND RUNNING THESE
APARTMENT BUILDINGS SO PEOPLE MAY STAY FOR LONGER THAN A YEAR.
EVERY DEVELOPER WILL TELL YOU, THEIR EXPECTED ANNUAL TURNOVER IS 50
100% ANNUALLY. THAT'S NOT STABLE. WITH RESPECT TO GREEN ROSE
HERITAGE PARK, AND GENERAL PARKING AND STREET MAINTENANCE,
PLEASE, PLEASE MAINTAIN THINGS. GREEN ROSE HERITAGE PARK IS A
WONDERFUL PLACE AND IT CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE KEPT UP. BUT SO DO SO
MANY OTHER PLACES AROUND THE CITY. LIKE THE SIDEWALKS IN EAST
CAMBRIDGE, FOR EXAMPLE. WITH RESPECT TO PURCHASING PROPERTY
FROM LESLEY, I REALLY HOPE THE CITY WILL FINALLY BE A LITTLE MORE PRO
ACTIVE ABOUT ACQUIRING PROPERTY. INSTEAD OF GOING GETTING STUFF
FROM THE DEAR BUDDIES... WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS PETITIONS
ABOUT MASS AVE. I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL GIVE THOSE EXACTLY AS MUCH
RESPECT AS THE AS YOU GAVE TO THE BULLDOZER PETITION THAT YOU FELL
ALL OVER YOURSELF TO TREAT IN AN UNWARRANTED FASHION AND HAVE
HEARINGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED
CHANGES TO THE AHO. IT WAS WRITTEN BY AND FOR DEVELOPERS. AND IN
CAMBRIDGE, MY OBSERVATION IS THAT RESIDENTS GET ONE BITE'S APPLE.
DEVELOPERS HAVE AN UNLIMITED NUMBER. WHETHER OR NOT I AGREE
WITH THE CHANGES, I'M PLEASED TO SEE RESIDENTS GETTING THEIR BITE.
THANKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE GO ON TO HILLARY, FOLLOWED BY JAMES
WILLIAMSON.
>> I'M HERE I'M HILLARY AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF POLICY
ORDER 7, RENAME PACIFIC FIELD DOYLE FIELD AFTER TOM DOYLE. TOM DIED
TRAGICALLY IN JUNE FROM A FALL FROM CLIMBING. HE WAS A MEMBER OF
THE COMMUNITY FOR 22 YEARS. COACHED SOCCER FOR FIVE YEARS AND
SPENT HOURS WITH KIDS. HE COACHED HIS OWN CHILDREN AND COACHED
TWO OF MY CHILDREN AS WELL. I'M FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THE GUIDANCE
AND SUPPORT TOM OFFERED MY CHILDREN AND MANY KIDS. HE WAS AN
AMAZING COACH WHO SUPPORTED CHILDREN, IN DOING THEIR BEST AND
LOVING THE GAME.
IT WOULD BE REALLY, REALLY MEANINGFUL TO KNOW THE COUNTLESS MORE
CHILDREN WOULD PLAY ON A SOCCER FIELD NAMED FOR TOM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.

>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> JACKSON PLACE IN JEFFERSON PARK PRESIDENT. I'M LIVING IN THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
SO MUCH. I WILL TALK MAINLY ABOUT RINDGE AVENUE. IT IS AN ITEM THAT
HAS BEEN ON THE TABLE NOW FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. IT IS A SECTION OF
RINDGE AVENUE AND IF YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THIS PLAN.
THIS IS A SECTION THAT RUNS BETWEEN THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARKING LOT
NEXT TO COMO FIELD. AND IT EXTENDS DOWN TO ALEWIFE BROOK
PARKWAY, ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF RINDGE AVE. WHERE YOU HAVE A
WELL RECEIVED PLAN TO REMOVE A FENCE AND OPEN UP JERRY'S PIT OR
POND AS A MUCH NICER AMENITY FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
NOW, THE PROBLEM WITH THE PLAN, THE PLAN THAT IS CURRENTLY ON THE
TABLE, FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE TWO NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS THAT WERE
MEETING REGULARLY WITH IQHQ FOR WELL OVER A YEAR. THEN THIS PLAN,
THIS SPECIFIC PLAN FOR A TWO WAY BICYCLE LANE, WHERE THE SIDEWALK
CURRENTLY EXISTS ON THAT SIDE OF RINDGE AVE, WAS INTRODUCED OUT OF
NOWHERE BY CITY STAFF WHO MAY HAVE HAD SOME OFFLINE DISCUSSIONS
WITH PEOPLE FROM IQHQ.
AS USUAL, THE WORK THAT IS DONE BY PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS
AND IN THE COMMUNITY IS HIJACKED AT THE LAST MINUTE BY CITY STAFF
FOR SOMETHING THAT NOBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I KNOW
ACTUALLY REALLY WANTS. THE IDEA OF A ONE WAY BIKE LANE IS WHAT HAD
BEEN ON THE TABLE PRIOR TO THIS TWO WAY IDEA BEING INTRODUCED,
WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE A SIDEWALK. NOW, THE OTHER ASPECT ABOUT A
TWO WAY BIKE LANE IS BY THE ADMISSION OF CITY STAFF IN A PRESENTATION
BY ADAM SHULMAN ABOUT FIRST AND SECOND STREET OPTIONS IN EAST
CAMBRIDGE TO THE BICYCLE COMMITTEE LAST WEEK, IN THE PRESENTATION,
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A TWO WAY BIKE LANE IS NOT GOOD FOR
PEDESTRIANS. WE CAN SEE THAT ON BRATTLE STREET IN HARVARD SQUARE.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO THE LEFT, YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO THE RIGHT, AND
THEN TO THE LEFT. IT IS JUST NOT GREAT FOR PEDESTRIANS. SO, I JUST
WANT TO CALL OUT THAT OTHER ASPECT OF THIS PLAN.
WE NEED SOMETHING NICE AND PLEASE DON'T SCREW IT UP WITH AN
UNNECESSARY TWO WAY BIKE LANE. ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE
BEEN TALKED ABOUT, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I
DON'T KNOW THEY ACTUALLY KNOW ANYBODY WHO LIVES IN AFFORDABLE
HOUSING. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT US AND HOW WE
FEEL ABOUT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, WE HAVE
PAT HAND?
>> THAT NAME IS NOT ON THE ZOOM.

THE COVID 19 UPDATE. MIRRORING STATEWIDE TRENDS, NEW INFECTIONS
AMONG CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS HAVE DECLINED OVER THE FIVE WEEKS
SINCE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. FOLLOWING THE DELTA VARIANT SURGE THAT
BEGAN IN JULY. CAMBRIDGE'S MOVING AGE FOR CONFIRMED CASES PER
HUNDRED THOUSAND IS NOW 7.4 CASES PER DAY. AND DOWN FROM THE
13.6 CASES I REPORTED SEPTEMBER 27. AND ADDITIONALLY, OUR PERCENT
POSITIVITY HAS DROPPED FROM POINT 37 OF 1%, AS OF SEPTEMBER 23 TO

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
#5
A COMMUNICATION
TRANSMITTED FROM
LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE,
CITY MANAGER,
RELATIVE TO THE
REAPPOINTMENT OF
ALBERT DARLING AS A
CONSTABLE FOR A TERM
OF THREE YEARS,
EFFECTIVE THE FIRST
DAY OF JANUARY, 2021

AS OF TODAY, THE STATE SEVEN DAY AVERAGE PERCENT OF POSITIVITY IS
1.67%. THE WEEKLY CASE RATES IS THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE MID JULY. TO
MAINTAIN THE DOWNWARD TREND AND GET INFECTION RATES TO A SAFER
LEVEL, THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDS
VACCINES OR BOOSTER SHOTS FOR ALL AND TO ADHERE TO THE CITY'S
INDOOR MASK MANDATE. 76% OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED
AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE AND 69% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY
VACCINATED, ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S WEEKLY COVID 19 VACCINATION
REPORT PUBLISHED ON OCTOBER 14.
THE PERCENTAGES HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE THE LAST REPORT. ANY
RESIDENTS THAT SEEK VACCINE CAN GET ONE ON OCTOBER 22 OR 23 AT THE
FLU AND COVID 19 VACCINE CLINICS BEING HELD. BOOSTER SHOTS ARE ALSO
AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS. STOP BY THE CLINIC AT THE KING OPEN
SCHOOL ON SATURDAY AND IT WAS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE THE SETUP AND THE
VOLUME OF PEOPLE ATTENDING TO RECEIVE THE FLU OR COVID 19
VACCINATION. I THANK THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, FINANCE

DEPARTMENT, AND THE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS MATTER. YOU
KNOW, THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, HAS FOUR
CATEGORIES. HIGH, SUBSTANTIAL, MODERATE AND LOW. AFTER MANY
WEEKS IN THE HIGH TRANSMISSION... CAMBRIDGE ON THE OTHER HAND,
MARKED THE FIRST TIME SINCE MID JULY IT DROPPED FROM THE HIGH OR
SUBSTANTIAL TRANSMISSION CATEGORY INTO THE MODERATE
TRANSMISSION CATEGORY.
I'M PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS WE ARE MAKING TO REDUCE CASES IN OUR
COMMUNITY. I WANT TO THANK OUR RESIDENTS, BUSINESS COMMUNITY,
AND UNIVERSITY PARTNERS FOR CONTINUING TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND I REALLY
BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO KEEP THE NUMBERS LOW IN CAMBRIDGE IS
DUE TO A WHOLE COMMUNITY BUYING INTO IS THE WORKING TOGETHER.
AS ALWAYS, THE CITY'S COVID 19 METRICS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE DATA
CENTER. AND THE CASE TRENDS ARE IN THE POSITIVE, WE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THE UPCOMING HOLIDAY SEASON CAN HAVE ON
COVID 19 TRANSMISSION. WE KNOW PEOPLE WILL TRAVEL AND MEMBERS
FROM DIFFERENT HOUSES WILL BE SOCIALIZING AT INCREASED RATES.
THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO VACCINATION, ONE OF THE BEST STRATEGIES
WE TO MINIMIZE THE SPREAD IS WEARING MASKS. SUE BREEN WILL TALK
MORE ABOUT THIS DURING HER PRESENTATION, BUT AT THIS TIME, WE ARE
CONTINUING TO KEEP THE MASK ORDER IN EFFECT. FOR OCTOBER, THE CITY
IS OFFERING COVID 19 TEST FOUR DAYS A WEEK. TESTING CAMBRDIGESIDE,
TWO DAYS A WEEK. CHURCH STREET AND ST. JOHN IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE.
THE TESTING SITE AT CAMBRIDGESIDE GOES BACK TO A DRIVE THROUGH
TESTING SITE. DUE TO THE DEMOLITION AT THE MALL, THE SITE WILL
RETURN TO A WALK IN TESTING SITE. IT WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE THIRD
LEVEL, WHICH IS CURRENTLY VACANT. 50 CHURCH STREET AND ST. JOHN ARE
WALK IN TESTING SITES. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE TESTING
PROGRAM, IF NEED WE'D EXPLORE TO ADD A FIFTH DAY. AT THIS TIME, OUR
TESTING DEMANDS ARE BELOW THE HIGH FROM THE SUMMER. I WANT TO
THANK CAMBRIDGE FIRE AND PRO EMS FOR ALL THE STAFFING THEY HAVE
DONE AT THE SITES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM. THIS IS A
SIGNIFICANT EFFORT AND VALUABLE SERVICE AS WE PROVIDE TO THE
RESIDENTS.
INFORMATION ABOUT CITY'S TESTING PROGRAM, INCLUDING HOURS, IS
AVAILABLE ONLINE. MY LAST COVID 19 UPDATE I ANNOUNCED THAT THE
EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY LICENSES FOR OUTDOOR DINING IS GOOD
THROUGH APRIL ONE AND DUE TO APRIL ON JANUARY 1. WE HAD 72
RESTAURANTS EXPRESS IN ESPECIALLY COOING PATIOS OPEN. THE
RESTAURANTS WILL WORK TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO PUBLIC
WORKS AND THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT TO MOVE FORWARD. AS PART OF
THE 22 LICENSE RENEWAL CAMPAIGN, CITY WILL RELEASE UPDATED DETAILED
REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE ANNUAL OUTDOOR PROGRAM
DINING EFFECTIVE THE SPRING OF 2022.
THE GUIDELINES WILL HAVE CONTINUED USE OF EXTENDING INTO PARKING

LANES WHERE POSSIBLE. I WANT TO THANK THE MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. INCLUDING
LICENSE, TRAFFIC, DPW, LAW, FIRE, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT,
INSPECTIONAL, AND THE STAFF FROM THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE.
HALLOWEEN IS AROUND THE CORNER. THOSE CELEBRATING, I ENCOURAGE
YOU TO CHECK THE LIST OF SAFE WAYS TO CELEBRATE CREATED BY THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THERE ARE NO CITY
RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR, CAMBRIDGE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND
THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES COMMUNITY SCHOOL PROGRAM
WILL NOT BE HOLDING EVENTS. I KNOW BOTH FIRE AND COMMUNITY
SCHOOLS LOOK FORWARD TO THE RETURN OF HALLOWEEN ACTIVITIES NEXT
YEAR. WE PUT OUT TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE PROVIDING
ACCESS TO DATA AND SHARE INFORMATION DAILY WITH THE COMMUNITY
THROUGHOUT EMAIL UPDATES. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO SHARING
INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WITH THE COUNCIL IN THE WEEKLY
DIGEST. AS WE HAVE DONE, WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE DATA
COMING FROM THE COMMONWEALTH AND WORK WITH CITY
DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, COMMUNITY PARTNERS, TO
ENSURE WE SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE
COMMUNITY.
AS EACH PREVIOUS DECISION MADE, I WILL WORK WITH THE TEAM, PUBLIC
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND REGIONAL PARTNERS. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO
SUE BREEN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL BRING UP THE PRESENTATION.
>> MS. BREEN: THANK YOU EVERYONE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YOU HEARD THE
CITY MANAGER GO OVER SOME OF THE NUMBERS. ONE THING TO
EMPHASIZE, WE ARE HEADING DOWNWARD, WHICH IS HOPEFUL. I WOULD
JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT COVID NUMBERS, ALTHOUGH ON A DOWNWARD
TREND, ARE STILL UP AND DOWN AS EVIDENCE BY MIDDLESEX COUNTIES
MOVING BACK INTO THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY AND CAMBRIDGE PLATEAUED
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
MASKS ARE AN IMPORTANT LAYER OF PROTECTION. THEY HELP TO KEEP
KEEP SAFE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FULLY PROTECTED AND THOSE WHO ARE
NOT OR CANNOT BE VACCINATED, SUCH AS YOUNG CHILDREN. WE DO NOT
KNOW HOW MANY INFECTIONS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY OUR MASK
MANDATE OR THOSE OF SOMERVILLE, ARLINGTON, BELMONT, OR
WATERTOWN, STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS HOW EFFECTIVE MASKS ARE IN
PRESENTING THE SPREAD. THE MORE PEOPLE THAT MASK UP IN INDOORS
AND CROWDED ENVIRONMENTS, THE SAFER WE ARE UNTIL MORE PEOPLE
ARE VACCINATED AND THERE'S A LOW LEVEL OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION
LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY.
IT BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE CDC
TRANSMISSION CATEGORIES ARE EXTREMELY USEFUL AS A DECISION MAKING
TOOL. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY METRIC THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.
AVAILABILITY, FOR VACCINES FOR CHILDREN AND BOOSTERS FOR ELIGIBLE
RESIDENTS, UPCOMING HOLIDAYS AND TENDENCIES FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER

PAGE 12

Jun 1, 2020

INDOORS, GIVEN LAST YEAR'S HOLIDAY SURGE, WE'LL MONITOR WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY. NEW VARIANTS OF CONCERN ARE
GAME CHANGERS OR CONSTANTLY IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS AND WHAT
WE ALSO WHAT WE ANTICIPATE. WHAT ARE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES
DOING? MASK MANDATES ARE IN EFFECT IN BOSTON, SOMERVILLE,
WATERTOWN, ARLINGTON, BROOKLINE, AND NEWTON. NEXT SLIDE.
ONE OF THE MAIN METRICS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THE CDC'S
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RISK CATEGORIES. I BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO
THIS ACTUALLY QUITE IMPRESSIVE SLIDE. AND HOPEFUL SLIDE. WE STILL
HAVE A WAYS TO GO. THE CDC CATEGORIZES COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION
RISK AS LOW, MODERATE, SUBSTANTIAL, AND HIGH. CATEGORIES ARE
DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND
RESIDENTS PER WEEK. THE HIGHER THE NUMBER OF CASES, THE HIGHER
TRANSMISSION RISK. AND THE COLORED BARS ON THE CHART SHOW THE
RISK CATEGORIES FOR MIDDLESEX COUNTY FROM EARLY JUNE THROUGH
OCTOBER.
LATER IN JULY, WHEN DELTA BECAME THE PREDOMINANT I LOST MY SPACE.
THE BLACK LINE SHOWS CAMBRIDGE RISK CATEGORIES OVER THE SAME
PERIOD. YOU WILL SEE THAT CAMBRIDGE AND THE COUNTY FOLLOW THE
SAME BASIC TREND, ALTHOUGH TRANSMISSION RISK ON ANY GIVEN WEEK
MAY DIFFER.
IN LATE JUNE AND INTO JULY, TRANSMISSION RISK FOR BOTH CAMBRIDGE
AND MIDDLESEX WAS LOW. LATER IN JULY, WHEN DELTA WAS THE STRAIN,
TRANSMISSION RISK INCREASED, GOING FROM MODERATE, THEN
SUBSTANTIAL, AND THEN HIGH. IT WAS THIS INCREASE IN THE TRANSMISSION
RISK THAT LED US TO THE MASK MANDATE TO HELP CONTROL THE SPREAD OF
INFECTION. COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATES ARE NOW DECREASING.
AND CAMBRIDGE HAS JUST REACHED A MODERATE TRANSMISSION
CATEGORY, WHILE MIDDLESEX IS STILL HIGH. GIVEN THAT CAMBRIDGE IS AN
URBAN HUB WITH THOUSANDS OF WORKERS AND VISITORS COMING INTO
THE CITY EVERY DAY, WE FEEL THAT MIDDLESEX COUNTY INFECTION RATE
GIVE US A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE RISK TO CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS.
WE ALL NEED TO REMEMBER THAT VIRUSES DON'T KNOW ANY BOUNDARIES.
I THINK THIS GRAPH HERE IS STRIKING WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE
STARTED THE MANDATE FOR THE INDOOR MASK ON SEPTEMBER 3. AND
THEN THE DECLINE IN SOME OF OUR RATES. WITH REGARD TO REMOVING
THE MASK MANDATE, WE'LL LIKE TO SEE A SUSTAINED LOW COMMUNITY
TRANSMISSION AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THIS WILL TAKE INTO ANY TAKE
INTO CONSIDERATION THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER.
SO, OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO KEEP THE MANDATE IN PLACE UNTIL
MIDDLESEX COUNTY MAINTAINS A LOW TRANSMISSION CATEGORY. NEXT
SLIDE PLEASE.
COMMUNITY TESTING IN CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES. THE CITY OFFERS COVID
19 TESTING FOUR DAYS A WEEK IN FOUR HOUR SESSIONS START NOVEMBER
1, A SITE WILL OFFER INDOOR TESTING. THE FIRST THROUGH THE TEN, 4, 047
TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED. SITES ARE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERING AN

PAGE 13

Jun 1, 2020

AVERAGE OF 809 TEST A SESSION FOR OCTOBER 1 10. AND RESIDENTS CAN
GET TESTED AT LOCAL PHARMACIES AND OTHER SITES. IF YOU GO TO THE
CITY WEBSITE, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THOSE ON THE WEBSITE AS WELL.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
OKAY. FALL VACCINE CLINICS ARE IN FULL SWING. WE HAVE ADMINISTERED
1,311 FLU SHOTS AT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLINICS IN OCTOBER. 94 COVID 19
VACCINES ARE ADMINISTERED THROUGH OCTOBER 15 16 AT PUBLIC CLINICS.
AND THE UPCOMING CLINICS THIS WEEKEND, OCTOBER 22 AT THE RESERVOIR
CHURCH. AND OCTOBER 23, AT THE PASANI CENTER. HERE IS THE FALL FLU
VACCINATION DATA. AS YOU HEARD BEFORE, WE DID 1311 TOTAL FLU
VACCINATIONS AND HERE IS A BREAKDOWN. 348 FLU SHOTS. AGE 18 AND
YOUNGER. 241 FLU SHOTS, AGES 65 AND OLDER. AND 94 COVID 19
VACCINES, MOSTLY BOOSTERS. FOR 82 DOSES. TEN FIRST DOSES DELIVERED,
INCLUDING SEVEN PEOPLE AGE 18 AND YOUNGER. TWO LARGE PUBLIC
CLINICS. ONE AT THE SENIOR CENTER, GAVE 355 TOTAL VACCINES. AND AT
THE KING OPEN, GAVE 797 TOTAL VACCINES. WE HAD 46% WALK IN, AND
54% PRE SCHEDULE. SEVEN SMALL TARGETED CLINICS WERE HELD AT SENIOR
BUILDINGS AND MEAL SITES. NEXT SLIDE.
BOOSTER SHOTS, ON OCTOBER 14TH AND 15TH, THE FDA ADVISORY PANEL
RECOMMENDED MODERNA BOOSTER SHOT FOR SELECT GROUP AND... A
RULING JUST CAME OUT ACTUALLY TODAY I MEAN NOT TODAY, WE WERE
CONTACTED BY THE STATE TO ASK IF WE WERE READY TO BEGIN GIVEN
VACCINES FOR CHILDREN AGES 5 11 BECAUSE THEY WILL BE GETTING
VACCINE AND WE TOLD THEM THAT WE WERE READY TO DO THAT.
SO, AS THE MANAGER SAID, 69% FULLY VACCINATED. 76 RESIDENTS WHO
HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. AND 77, 423 RESIDENTS
ARE FULLY VACCINATED. NEXT SLIDE. VACCINATION RATES AND ETHNICITY
DATA. THESE HAVEN'T CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY. THEY CONTINUE TO BE
SORT OF UP THERE WITH MASSACHUSETTS.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. VACCINATION BY AGE AND GENDER. PROPORTION OF
RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. 12 15, GREATER
THAN 95%. A BIG JUMP OVER MASS. 16 19, 56%. WE ARE SLOWLY CREEPING
UP IN THAT CATEGORY. 20 29, 73%. 30 49, 86%. 50 64 YEARS, 95%. 65 74,
95%. 75 PLUS, GREATER THAN 95%. WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HAD JUST
ABOUT EQUAL BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE PEOPLE RECEIVING VACCINES.
WHICH IS NOT THE WAY IT IS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES, INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
SO, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT,
PARTICULARLY THE SCHOOL NURSES, WHO CAME IN ON SATURDAY AND
HELPED RUN THE SUCCESSFUL VACCINE CLINIC AND WE COULDN'T DO IT
WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE FIRE FIGHTERS, WHO ACTUALLY RAN THE FRIDAY
CLINIC BECAUSE ALL THE SCHOOL NURSES WERE IN SCHOOL. SO THAT IS THE
END OF MY REPORT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL? ANY

Jun 1, 2020

QUESTIONS? I SAW VICE MAYOR MALLON'S HAND UP AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND
FOR THIS COVID UPDATE. I HAD ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT 16 19 YEAR
OLD DATA AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE ABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN BY
AGE GROUP TO DO MORE DIGGING AND IT WAS STATED THAT SHE'D BE ABLE
TO DIG INTO DATA AT THE STATE LEVEL AND BRING IT BACK FOR THIS
MEETING TONIGHT. DO YOU KNOW IF SHE IS PREPARED TO DO THAT? COME
ON UP?
>> HI, WE WERE ABLE TO START TO LOOK INTO THAT DATA. ONE REASON
THE STATE AGGREGATES BY 12 15 AND 16 19, WHEN YOU GET INTO SMALLER
NUMBER POPULATION ESTIMATES, LIKE JUST 16 YEAR OLDS IN THE CITY OF
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> YOU GET INTO SMALL NUMBER ESTIMATES, THERE'S A LOT OF STATISTICAL
VARIABILITY. IT IS VERY HARD TO SAY THERE ARE 80216 YEAR OLDS IN THE
CITY OF CAMBRIDGE. I CAN LOOK AT HOW MANY 16 YEAR OLDS HAVE BEEN
VACCINATED. WE DID DO THAT AND BREAK IT OUT YEAR BY YEAR. IT IS HARD
TO CALCULATE A PERCENTAGE. I'M WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM
COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE ON HOW MUCH TO COUNT ON THE NUMBERS IN
SMALL GROUPS. AND I DIDN'T FEEL CONFIDENT PUTTING OUT THERE 70% OF
THIS VERY SMALL GROUP IS VACCINATED BECAUSE IT CAN VARY SO MUCH
WHEN YOU USE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY ESTIMATES.
I'M STILL WORKING ON IT AND WE SHOULD HAVE MORE NUMBERS SOON
AND WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. TO KEEP IN MIND, STATISTICAL
VARIABILITY CAN IMPACT THE NUMBERS, AS WE DISCUSSED WITH SOME
OTHER POPULATION DATA.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A COVID
UPDATE UNTIL NOVEMBER 1. IF WE GET THAT DATA PRIOR TO THAT, CAN IT
BE SENT TO US? THIS IS VALUABLE INFORMATION TO GET.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE CAN PUT IT IN THE WEEKLY DIGEST AND IF IT COMES
IN EARLY, WE'LL TRY TO GET IT OUT BEFORE THAT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. AND THANK YOU. I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, FOLLOWED BY COUNCILLOR
NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO DO SUSPENSION TO
BRING FORWARD THE CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER 1. THE HEALTH AND
ENVIRONMENT MEETINGS ON THE COVID 19 RESPONSE.

Councillor Zondervan motion
to bring forward Calender Item
#1

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, WE'D HAVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES AND THAT
REQUIRES A ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE SUSPENSION OF THE RULES TO BRING BACK THE


PAGE 15

CHARTER RIGHT 1. (ROLL CALL).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THAT PARTICULAR MEETING
WHICH TOOK PLACE IN APRIL WAS A REALLY GOOD SUMMARY OF THE
PANDEMIC RESPONSE, THE EARLY PART OF THE PANDEMIC, WHICH I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE WAS AN EMERGENCY. WE HAVE NOW TRANSITIONED
INTO A NEW PHASE OF OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE WHERE WE ARE
PREPARING TO ULTIMATELY LIVE WITH THE VIRUS PRESUMABLY FOREVER.
AND WHILE WE DID SOME THINGS IN THE EMERGENCY PHASE, WE HAVE TO
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN THIS PHASE. I WAS GLAD TO SEE THE NUMBERS
COMING DOWN REALLY SINCE EARLY SEPTEMBER. THEY HAVE BEEN
TRENDING DOWN. BUT VERY RECENTLY, THAT'S KIND OF FLATTENED OUT
AND I AGREE THAT SOME OF THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN, INCLUDING
THE INDOOR MASK MANDATE, HAS REALLY HELPED TO BRING THE NUMBERS
DOWN. WE MAY NEED TO TAKE SOME ADDITIONAL MEASURES AND KEEP
SOME OF THE MEASURES THROUGH THE WINTER TO KEEP OUR NUMBERS
DOWN AND KEEP OUR RESIDENTS SAFE.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HOW WE'RE PLANNING TO DO THAT.
I WAS GLAD TO SEE OUR TESTING CAPACITY STAYING AT FOUR DAYS A WEEK.
I'M HOPING WE CAN STILL EXPAND THAT A LITTLE BIT SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE
EASY ACCESS TO TESTING. OUR VACCINATIONS SEEM TO REMAIN CLOSE TO
FLAT. THE NUMBERS THAT WERE PRESENTED TODAY, 94 SHOTS, IT IS NOT
ENOUGH. I'D LIKE TO SEE A VACCINE MANDATE FOR STAFF. AND I KNOW
THIS IS NOT YOUR CALL, BUT I'M STILL FLABBERGASTED THAT THE COVID 19
VACCINES ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE DOCTOR OFFICES, UNLIKE THE FLU
VACCINE, WHICH PRESUMABLY WOULD DRIVE A LOT MORE VACCINATIONS.
PARTICULARLY, AROUND THE VACCINATIONS, I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT OUR PLANS FOR VACCINE MANDATE AND FOR GETTING
VACCINATIONS UP IN GENERAL.
>> SUE BREEN: I WON'T SPEAK TO THE VACCINE MANDATE, WHAT I WILL
SPEAK TO AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO DR. DOBBERTEEN TO TALK ABOUT THE
STATUS OF VACCINATION IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING, IF SHE CAN, FOR US


PAGE 16

Jun 1, 2020

TONIGHT. I THINK SHE IS STANDING IN THE WINGS. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING
NEWS. A LOT OF US IN PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE BEEN ALSO WAITING TO HEAR
FROM MODERNA AS WELL AS JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO HEAR DID I SAY
THAT RIGHT? J&J TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE VACCINES IN HAND. LITERALLY
DID WE GET THAT SURVEY FROM THE STATE TODAY WE HUDDLED TO TALK
ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD A COVID VACCINE, PURE COVID VACCINE CLINIC
AS SOON AS THE VACCINES ARE IN OUR HANDS. THAT'S THE MOST
IMMEDIATE STRATEGY THAT WILL COME OUT OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
AND WE ARE LOOKING, HOPEFULLY AND DEPENDS ON VACCINE DELIVERY
FROM THE STATE AND THINGS CAN GET A LITTLE KERFUFFLED IN TERMS OF
DELIVERY AND SHIPMENTS. WE LOOK TO DO THAT PROBABLY IN EARLY
DECEMBER.
I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO LISA TO SEE IF DR. DOBBERTEEN, TO SEE IF SHE
HAS ANYMORE TO ADD TO THAT?

>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. THERE IS AN ACTIVE EFFORT
ONGOING IN CHA PRIMARY CARE OFFICES AS WELL AS THOSE IN OTHER
SYSTEMS. THE LOGISTICS OF VACCINE STORAGE IS WHAT PREVENTED THE
VACCINE FROM BEING WIDELY AVAILABLE IN PRIMARY CARE OFFICES, AS
WELL AS THE LOGISTICS OF DELIVERING PRIMARY CARE IN THIS STILL
PANDEMIC SETTING. WE HAVE LIMITS ON CAPACITY LIMITS ON PATIENT
FLOW. WE ARE STILL WEARING PPE AS WE SEE PATIENT. IT TAKES TIME TO
SEE THEM, WE ARE CLOSE TO NORMAL THANKFULLY THAN WE WERE 6 9
MONTHS AGO, WE STILL DELIVER CARE IN A PROCESS THAT IS VERY
DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WE USED TO. THAT IS IMPEDING PRIMARY CARE
OFFICES TO GIVE VACCINES. I CAN TELL YOU, THERE'S AN ACTIVE AND
ONGOING EFFORT AND A PILOT SITE WITHIN CHA BEING WORKED ON AT THIS
VERY TIME. AND THERE'S ALSO AN ONGOING EFFORT LOOKING TO SEE
ABOUT DELIVERING VACCINES TO CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY IN THE SITES THAT
SEE MANY CHILDREN BECAUSE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER 50% OF
PARENTS WOULD PREFER TO GET THEIR VACCINE FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN THE
SITE WHERE THEY GET THE PRIMARY PEDIATRIC CARE. ALL THAT IS
HAPPENING.
I THINK WE ARE WELL POISED, AS MS. BREEN SAID, IN THE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN A ROBUST EFFORT OFFERING VACCINES TO YOUNGER
CHILDREN CITY WIDE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT
UPDATE. IT IS REALLY ENCOURAGING AND A BIT IRONIC THAT THE PANDEMIC
ITSELF IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF DELIVERING VACCINES AT DOCTOR
OFFICES. I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT'S A CHALLENGE. I WISH YOU
MUCH LUCK AND SUCCESS WITH ESTABLISHING THAT PRACTICE. AND MY
SECOND QUESTION IS ON EXTENDING MEMORIAL DRIVE CLOSURES. THIS IS
FOR THE MANAGER, WHETHER WE ARE HAVING ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT
POTENTIALLY EXTENDING MEMORIAL DRIVE BEING CLOSED FOR TRAFFIC
LATER INTO THE FALL TO MAKE THAT OUTDOOR SPACE AVAILABLE.


PAGE 17

Jun 1, 2020

>> CITY MANAGER: I HAVE NOT RECENTLY TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THAT. IF
THE COUNCIL WOULD LIKE ME TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL TIME, SEND A
COUNCIL IN ON WHAT IT MAY BE, WE HAVE DONE THAT IN THE PAST. I'D BE
HAPPY TO START THAT DISCUSSION AND SEE WHERE WE CAN FROM THERE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GREAT. THANK YOU. I WILL REACH OUT
ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE
OF THE POINTS IN QUESTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE.
FOLLOWING UP ON THE QUESTION OF THE VACCINATION RATE AS NOTED, IT
HAS BEEN PRETTY FLAT. AND AS VICE MAYOR MALLON TALKED ABOUT, THE
AGE GROUP WHERE IT IS THE LEAST, IT IS THE 16 19 YEAR OLD. WE HAVE
WHAT 73% OF THE 20 29 YEAR OLD. IT IS REALLY BELOW WHERE WE WANT
TO BE. WE HAVE TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT HAVING BRINGING A SPECIFIC
NOT JUST THE FLU CLINIC, BRINGING IT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL, GETTING TO
FAMILIES. IF THE GROUPS THAT ARE HESITANT ARE GROUPS SIMILAR TO
FAMILY SERVED BY EN ROUTE, HAVE WE DONE SPECIFIC OUTREACH. I'M
CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT GROUP OF RESIDENTS WHO
ARE NOT YET VACCINATED BECAUSE THE MORE WE CAN GET EVERY SINGLE
ONE ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINATION, WE HAVE SOME HIGH RESULTS, BUT NOT
THAT MUCH MORE THAN THE STATE. I WANT US TO BE ABOVE THE STATE
AND IF WE CAN GET THAT UP AS WE SAW TODAY WITH THE DEATH OF COLIN
POWELL. THEY ARE AT HIGHER RISK AND WE WANT TO PROTECT THEM AS
MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE DOING SO, NEXT
TIME WE HAVE A REPORT THAT IT IS STARTING TO TICK UP IN TERMS OF THE
TOTAL VACCINATION RATE. THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. I'M SORRY.
>> MS. BREEN: WE ARE MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORT TO DO A LOT OF
OUTREACH. WE HAVE THE AMBASSADORS GOING OUT THROUGH
NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES, WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS, A LOT
OF SOCIAL MEDIA. WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO SET
SOMETHING UP, SPECIFICALLY FOR THE SCHOOLS. BECAUSE DR. DOBBERTEEN
HAS BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE EFFORTS, I'LL LET HER TELL YOU
WHERE THEY ARE AT NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: CAN I CLARIFY? I'M NOT SURE WHO IS NOT
GETTING IT, WHAT I HAVE HEARD, IT IS COMMUNITIES WHO MAY BE
LINGUISTICALLY IS NOT AS AWARE. IF IT IS NOT THAT COMMUNITY THAT
NEED THE OUTREACH, WE SHOULD OUTREACH TO OTHERS. I JUST HEARD
THAT AND WASN'T SURE IF THOSE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO
REACH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. I THINK WE HAVE DONE A GREAT
DEAL OF OUTREACH IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AS WELL AS PARTNERING
WITH THE SCHOOL PARTNERS WHO ARE HELPING US OUTREACH AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL. THERE IS THIS IS STATISTICALLY CONFIRMED THERE IS A CORE OF
YOUTH WHO HAVE HESITATION. AND I SPEAK TO THOSE YOUTH IN MY OFFICE

PAGE 18

Jun 1, 2020

EVERY DAY AND OFFER TO HAVE CONSULTS WITH THEM. THEY HAVE DONE
THEIR RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET. AND AS WE KNOW, MISINFORMATION
FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS, IT IS A POWERFUL FORCE THAT IS
DISSUADING SOME FOLKS FROM GETTING VACCINATED. WE'RE TRYING TO
COUNTERACT THAT THROUGH MANY CHANNELS, INCLUDING THE
SUPERINTENDENT AND MYSELF ARE HAVING TWO LISTENING SESSIONS NEXT
WEEK FOR FAMILIES OF CRLS STUDENTS.
I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THIS IS NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING. WE HAD A
VACCINATION CLINIC EFFORT, TWO VACCINATION EFFORTS OVER THE
SUMMER THAT WERE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TO YOUTH WITH VERY SMALL
NUMBERS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. WE ARE
CONTINUING TO TWEAK OUR OUTREACH AND OUR MESSAGE. I THINK THAT
WE ARE COMING UP AGAINST THIS IS CAMBRIDGE'S WINDOW ON WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN A FAR GREATER FASHION IN OTHER PLACES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY. SADLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL JUST ADD, I GOT THIS INFORMATION TOO LATE
TO BE IN THE COMMUNICATION TO THE COUNCIL, AS DR. DOBBERTEEN
MENTIONED, DR. GREER IS MEETING WITH THE LEADERS AND PREPARED FOR
A SURVEY FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVES ON COVID 19
VACCINATIONS THAT WAS DISSEMINATED FRIDAY. THEY ARE WORKING WITH
THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ON A STUDENT VIDEO FROM STUDENTS, BY
STUDENTS, TO ENCOURAGE VACCINATIONS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN OUTREACH
TO AGENDA FOR CHILDREN, FAITH BASED LEADERS AND OTHERS TO SPREAD
THE WORD ABOUT VACCINATIONS AND DR. DOBBERTEEN MENTIONED THE
FAMILY INFORMATION SESSIONS AS WELL. AND I THINK LASTLY, THERE'S
GOING TO BE MORE WORK WITH THE UPPER SCHOOLS ON SPREADING
INFORMATION AND SO FORTH.
TOMORROW WE DO HAVE A SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING. I'LL HAVE
UPDATES AND I'LL DEFINITELY SHARE IN THURSDAY'S COMMUNICATION
ABOUT FURTHER EFFORTS.
>> CITY MANAGER: I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN AND THE CITY
HAS THAT CONCERN. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC
HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE SCHOOLS AND IN THE CITY, IN TERMS OF
TRYING TO GET INFORMATION OUT ON VACCINES IS SECOND TO NONE. WE
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT, BUT THE REALITY IS, DR. DOBBERTEEN
MENTIONED, THERE ARE A PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE JUST NOT
GOING TO GET VACCINATED NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY, WE'RE JUST
NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEM. IT IS NOT FROM A LACK OF EFFORT. TRUST
ME, THE WORK THAT DR. DOBBERTEEN, DR. BREEN HAVE DONE, AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL LEVEL, HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. WE'LL KEEP TRYING. I DON'T SEE THE
NUMBERS DRAMATICALLY CHANGING AS A PERCENT AGE. I WISH I COULD
SAY THAT IS NOT THE CASE, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT, THE REASON I
ASK, IT IS SOMEWHAT FLAT, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I KNOW WE ARE REALLY TRYING HARD, BUT AS VICE
MAYOR MALLON AND OTHERS POINTED OUT, IF THE NUMBERS ARE

PAGE 19

Jun 1, 2020

ACCURATE, WE ARE IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, 72% IS 16 19 YEAR
OLD ARE VACCINATED AND 56% HERE. AND SOME OF THE HIGHER AGE
GROUP OF 50 64, MY AGE GROUP, CAMBRIDGE IS ABOVE 95%. STATE IS
BELOW US AT 90. I WANT US TO BE ABOVE IN EVERY CATEGORY. I ASKED
ABOUT, NOT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, IS THE 20 29 YEAR OLDS. JUST ABOUT
WHERE THE STATE IS. 73%. THE 30 49 ARE 86%. IT IS REMINDING US THAT
WE WANT TO BE A CITY WHERE WE ARE AHEAD OF THE STATE AND ARE IN A
COUPLE OF THE AGE CATEGORIES. WE ARE NOT IN THE OTHERS. I'M AWARE
EVERYBODY IS WORKING HARD. I KNOW IT IS FANTASTIC AND WE HAVE
TESTING. I HEAR IT. FOUR DAY TESTING WE HELP RESIDENTS STAY SAFE AND
WE WANT TO SEE THE NUMBERS TICK UP.
THE OTHER QUESTION IS ALSO RAISED PARTLY BY A COUPLE OF MY
COLLEAGUES, WE'LL COME BACK TO. THE CITY MANAGER HAS HEARD
SEVERAL TIMES. IN THE NEWS, WE HAVE BOSTON AND THE STATE TALKING
ABOUT THEIR MANDATE STAFF, FOR ALL THE STAFF, THEY ARE COMING DUE
RIGHT NOW. STAFF THAT ARE THEIR RATES WENT UP DUE TO THE
MANDATES FOR THE VACCINE AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. I KNOW
THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME COMMUNICATION ABOUT WHERE WE ARE
AT. WE THOUGHT WE'D GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE WOULD HAVE MOST
OF THE STAFF VACCINATED, WHETHER THERE IS A MANDATE OR NOT. I'M
CURIOUS IF THERE ARE SPECIFICS ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE AT THE POINT
WHERE THE STAFF IS ALL VACCINATED OR HAVE HAD AN EXEMPTION.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE HAVE NOT MANDATED VACCINES TO THE STAFF. WE
TALKED TO THE UNIONS, AT THIS POINT, I'M NOT RECOMMENDING
MANDATING IT. WE ARE STILL IN DISCUSSION. WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS
OF WHAT WE'D DO IF WE DID PUT THAT MANDATE IN PLACE. WE ARE SEEING
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH BOSTON IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF
REPLACEMENT OF EMPLOYEES WHEN THIS HAPPENS. WE ARE STAYING ON
TOP OF IT. WE MET ON IT THIS WEEK, BUT AT THIS POINT, WE DO NOT HAVE
A VACCINE MANDATE IN PLACE. AND TO BE HONEST, IT IS NOT SOMETHING I
SEE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I UNDERSTAND THAT. DO WE HAVE A SENSE WHAT
PERCENT OF THE STAFF ARE VACCINATED. I KNOW GOVERNOR BAKER AND
THE CITY OF BOSTON TALK ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGE VARIOUS
DEPARTMENTS ARE.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE HAVE A SENSE, TO BE HONEST, IN TALKING TO THE
PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT, TO GET THE INFORMATION IS DIFFICULT. WE
HAVE A SENSE, WE CONTINUING IS PRETTY HIGH. WE DON'T HAVE DEFINITES
ON WHAT PERCENTAGE. WE THINK WE ARE PRETTY HIGH.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY. YOU KNOW WHERE SOME OF US STAND. I
APPRECIATE YOUR
>> CITY MANAGER: I APPRECIATE THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: WE'LL KEEP ASKING AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET IT.
THANK YOU. THE OTHER THING I'D SAY, NOT A QUESTION, THE METRICS YOU
TALK ABOUT, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE ONLINE. WE HAVE A TARGET

PAGE 20

Jun 1, 2020

TO SHOOT FOR AND BE SPECIFIC WHEN WE REACH THEM, WHETHER IT WILL
LEAD TO HAVING THE INDOOR MASK MANDATE BE TAKEN AWAY. THANK YOU
AND I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. JUST A QUICK
OBSERVATION/SUGGESTION. ESPECIALLY IF WE'LL AT SOME POINT, IF WE GET
TO THE POINT OF OFFERING VACCINES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, MY
UNDERSTANDING AROUND TESTING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL IS THAT IT IS BEING
OFFERED AT LUNCH. AND I KNOW THAT IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE
BEEN IN HIGH SCHOOL, IF I HAD 25 MINUTES FOR LUNCH TO EAT AND
SOCIALIZE WITH FRIENDS, THE LAST THING I WILL DO IS GET A VACCINATION
OR A TEST. IF THAT IS THE CASE, I KNOW IT MAY BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR
THE SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU DON'T PULL KIDS OUT OF CLASS OR WHATEVER.
PROBABLY NOT THE BEST TIME TO ASK HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO
VOLUNTARY GET SOMETHING STUCK UP THEIR NOSE. MAYBE WE CAN THINK
OF A DIFFERENT TIME TO DO THAT AND GET MORE COMPLIANCE.
>> THE OTHER TIME THAT IS NOT VERY GOOD IS AFTER SCHOOL. NO
LUNCH, NO AFTER SCHOOL. IT LEAVES YOU VERY LITTLE TIME. WE KEEP
TRYING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER WAS AHEAD
OF ME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. SORRY. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. IT IS
HELPFUL TO GET. IT IS GREAT TO HEAR THE CITY IS CONSIDERING OUTDOOR
DINING EXTENSION GOING INTO THE WINTER. RELATED TO THAT AND
APOLOGIES, I MISSED PART OF IT, THE OUTDOOR HEATING PROGRAM.
CONSIDERATION ABOUT EXTENDING THAT FOR THIS WINTER AS WELL?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL HAVE MATT NELSON RESPOND ON THAT. I BELIEVE
WE ARE IN A GOOD PLACE. MATT, ANY UPDATE ON THAT?
>> MATT NELSON: THANK YOU. AS THE CITY MANAGER MENTIONED, OUR
TEMPORARY LICENSE PROGRAM FOR THE OUTDOOR DINING WAS EXTENDED
UNTIL APRIL 1. AND THE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE PERMITTED FOR PATIO
HEATERS WILL CONTINUE THE PERMITS THROUGH THAT TIME.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR. THANK YOU.
I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. TO THE MANAGER AND MS. BREEN,
MANY PEOPLE ARE THEIR POSITIONS ARE AFFECTED BY PEOPLE THEY KNOW
WHO GET SICK OR LEARN SOMETHING. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO 15 19 OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER. 16 19,
HAVE GOTTEN COVID? WHAT I'M ASKING IS, EACH OF THE BRACKETS THAT


PAGE 21

Jun 1, 2020

YOU SHOWED US SAID WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE VACCINATED. BUT I'D BE
VERY CURIOUS HOW THE PERCENTAGES RATE VIS A VIS OF ACTUALLY
GETTING COVID. OR FOR THAT MATTER, DYING FROM COVID. I THINK THAT
WOULD BE HELPFUL IF TEENAGERS LEARN THAT A COLLEAGUE HAD IT AND
SUFFERED FROM IT. THE WORD GOES AROUND. IS THERE ANY INFORMATION
LIKE THAT AVAILABLE?
>> MS. BREEN: I GOING TO ASK ANNA TO SEE IF SHE HAS THAT
INFORMATION? DO YOU HAVE IT, ANNA?
>> WE DO PUBLISH THE CASE RATES BY AGE. I BELIEVE WE BREAK IT OUT BY
DECADES. 0 9. 10 19. ON THE CITY DATA CENTER. AND I DON'T HAVE THE
NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME, I DO KNOW EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC, WE SAW
FEWER CASES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT INCREASE
OVER TIME. AND DR. DOBBERTEEN CAN SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE SEVERITY
OF CASES. WE DO PUBLISH THAT ON THE DATA CENTER. IT IS PART OF THE
4:00 UPDATE. I'M HAPPY TO BREAK IT INTO SMALLER CHUNKS OF 16 19.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I'M SORRY. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A CHANGE. IT IS
CONSISTENT?
>> SORRY. WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN CASES AMONG PEOPLE IN THAT
AGE GROUP OVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE PANDEMIC SO FAR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I'M JUST SUGGEST ING IF ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE,
HOPEFULLY RECOVERED, DO A VIDEO ON WHAT IT WAS LIKE, MUCH LIKE
OTHER SUBJECTS DO THAT... IT MIGHT BE A WAY TO HAVE A GREAT IMPACT
ON PEOPLE OF THAT AGE. DR. DOBBERTEEN, YOU WANT TO ADD?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: SURE. THANK YOU. THE FEW CASES EARLY ON IN
THE PANDEMIC WAS SOMEWHAT OF A REFLECTION OF CHILDREN WERE NOT
BEING TESTED EARLY ON. THE DATA ISN'T THE DATA ARE SOMEWHAT
MISLEADING IN THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY MANY CASES IN CHILDREN
THAT WERE JUST NOT PICKED UP BECAUSE WE WERE NOT TESTING THEM. IN
GENERAL, FORTUNATELY CHILDREN HAVE HAD, FOR THE MOST PART, MUCH
LESS SEVERE DISEASE.
THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN WHO GET THE SEVERE SYNDROME HAS
REMAINED VERY LOW. AND WHAT WE DO KNOW IS AS THE POPULATION OF
OLDER FOLKS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE HIGHLY VACCINATED, THE BURDEN
OF DISEASE RISEN AMONG CHILDREN AND TEENAGER. MOST KIDS KNOW
SOMEONE WHO HAD COVID AND MANY KIDS KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS
SERIOUSLY ILL WITH COVID.
IT IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC. AS WE VACCINATED OUR SENIORS,
INITIALLY THEY WERE HIT HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC AND SADLY MOST
DEATHS ARE IN THAT CATEGORY, ESPECIALLY EARLY ON. AS THE BURDEN OF
DISEASE HAS SHIFTED, THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED GET LESS DISEASE, GET
BREAK THROUGH DISEASE, AND YOUNGER PEOPLE GET MORE DISEASE. THAT
IS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS AS WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I YIELD.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OTHERS ON ZOOM? COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, YOU ARE
ALL SET?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: ALL SET.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. AND THEN I WILL JUST POINT OUT THAT HOPE
PERHAPS AS WE APPROACH THANKSGIVING THAT THE FIFTH SITE CAN BE
READY TO GO. I DO FORESEE JUST TESTING DEMANDS GOING UP AS HAS
BEEN THE CASE FOR MOST OF OUR HOLIDAYS. JUST THE EMAILS WE GET FOR
AROUND THAT TIME OF HAVING ACCESS. I KNOW THAT THE CITY MANAGER
HAD SAID THAT YOU SPOKE TO THE CHURCH?
>> CITY MANAGER: YES, WE HAVE A SITE, WHICH STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHO WILL STAFF IT. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. IF WE DO SEE UPTICK,
WE KNOW IT IS COMING, WE'D CERTAINLY LOOK TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN
SET UP THAT FIFTH SITE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. AND I THINK THAT COVERS IT. TOMORROW I
WILL HAVE THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING AND THERE WILL BE MORE
UPDATES TO SHARE WITH THE COUNCIL AROUND SOME OF THE EFFORTS WE
ARE MAKING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND SO FORTH IN CONJUNCTION WITH
CPH AND SO FORTH. WITH THAT, THAT'S THE PRESENTATION. WHAT I CAN
DO NOW, I KNOW THERE'S A QUICK UPDATE THAT THE MANAGER'S OFFICE
HAS AND TRAFFIC HAS. I WILL ENTERTAIN THE MOTION TO PULL
COMMUNICATION NUMBER FIVE. SORRY, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP. GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS MUTED. VERY QUICKLY,
IT HAS COME UP, I HEARD IT DANCE AROUND THE EDGES IN TERMS OF THE
RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION. I WANT TO KNOW, IT COMES TO MY ATTENTION, A
NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE RELIGIONS ON EXEMPTION
NOW. PART IS TO REGARDING SCHOOLS. I WANT TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE
OF WHERE WE WERE AROUND THE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION. THROUGH YOU
TO THE CITY MANAGER OR TO DR. DOBBERTEEN.
>> CITY MANAGER: AS A MANDATE? EXEMPTION FOR THE CITY EMPLOYEES?
WE DON'T MANDATE THE VACCINE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT SCHOOL IS DOING
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: ANY CHANGES TO OUR STAND ON WE HAVE A
MASK MANDATE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CLEARLY HAVE A RELIGIOUS...
RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. BECAUSE OF IT, THEY ARE NOT PART OF THAT. I
KNOW THE MANDATE IS STILL FAIRLY FIXED. I'M LOOKING TO SEE FROM YOU
AND MAYBE THEN THE MAYOR, WHERE WE ARE ON THE RELIGIOUS
EXEMPTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE TAKING THEY HAVE A RELIGIOUS
EXEMPTION. IF WE CAN GET UPDATED ON THAT. PLEASE? DR. DOBBERTEEN,
WHOEVER FEELS MOST EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THAT.
>> MS. BREEN: I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR. DOBBERTEEN, ONLY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A MANDATE, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
BE CLEAR THAT AN EXEMPTION IS NOT PHILOSOPHICAL. IN OTHER
COMMUNITIES, THEY ARE SORT OF MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO. THERE ARE
THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING


PAGE 23

Jun 1, 2020

INFORMATION CERTIFIED. IT IS REALLY RUNNING THE GAMUT. WE FOR
ADULTS IN THE CITY HERE HAVEN'T HAD THAT CONVERSATION. IT IS PART OF
THE CONVERSATIONS WE'LL BE HAVING. AS THE CITY MANAGER SAID, IF DR.
DOBBERTEEN CAN ADDRESS WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THE SCHOOLS FOR
VERIFICATION OF THAT. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DO FOR
CHILDREN WHO ARE IN SCHOOL. IT IS NOT THE SAME PROCESS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO
KNOW. IT HAS COME UP TO ME AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH THE
INTERFAITH COMMUNITY QUITE A BIT. I WANT TO PREPARE TO GIVE THEM
THE CITY'S STAND ON IT. AS INFORMATION COMES UP OR IF WE DEVELOP A
POLICY OR PRACTICE, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO
KNOW TO MAKE SURE IT GETS OUT TO GROUPS, PARTICULARLY INTERFAITH
COMMUNITIES, SO THEY CAN ACT ACCORDINGLY TO RULES AND
REGULATIONS. LASTLY, THE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION, I'M PLEASED FOR THE
EXTENSION TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE UNTIL
JANUARY I HAVE SPOKEN TO THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES AS HAVE OTHERS.
WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THERE WAS A
GREAT CONCERN ABOUT HAVING TO SHUT DOWN EARLY AND WHERE THE
WEATHER HAS BEEN KIND TO US AND FOR REASONS WE MAY ASCRIBE TO
THAT, THEY DON'T WANT TO STOP AT THIS JUNCTURE WHEN IT IS BEGINNING
TO GET THEM OFF THEIR KNEES AND ON TO THEIR FEET. I CERTAINLY HOPE
WE'LL GET REGULAR UPDATES IN TERMS OF OUTDOOR DINING AND WHAT
WE'LL PUT IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS,
PARTICULARLY RESTAURANTS WHEN WE STOP THE OUTDOOR DINING.
THANK YOU. I'LL WAIT FOR MY ANSWER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, WE'LL HAVE MORE
INFORMATION TO SHARE ON THAT PROCESS. AND DR. GREER SAYS THERE
WILL BE MORE INFORMATION COMING ON WHAT THE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE. I
WILL DEFINITELY SHARE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S ALL FOR QUESTIONS. WHAT WE CAN DO NOW,
I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO CLOSE PLACE THIS COMMUNICATION ON FILE
ALONG WITH THE COMMITTEE REPORT FROM THE HEALTH AND
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE REPORT THAT COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
PULLED. SO WE CAN MOVE TO DO THAT.

Place City Manager’s Agenda
#1 and Calendar #1 on file

>> MR. CLERK: ON THAT MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE THE MANAGER, JUST BRIEFLY, I WILL
ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO PULL COMMUNICATION NUMBER FIVE
>> SO MOVED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: REGARDING MASS AVE SAFE OR CITY PETITION BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN. ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON SUSPENSION OF THE RULES TO BRING FORWARD
COMMUNICATION NUMBER FIVE: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO

AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WHILE WE HAVE YOU, CITY MANAGER, YOU KNOW
THERE'S BEEN SOME WE HAVE TALKED TO YOU, I THINK VICE MAYOR
MALLON, AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND OTHERS, COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER, THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATION WITH MR. BARR FROM TRAFFIC
AROUND THE NEW UPDATES THAT WERE MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE
FEEDBACK FROM THE SEPTEMBER 16TH MEETING. AND THE FEEDBACK
SHORTLY AFTER INQUIRING WHETHER THERE COULD BE ANOTHER
COMMUNITY MEETING TO GO OVER THE CHANGES. AND HAVE ADDITIONAL
COMMENTARY. I THINK THERE WAS A DATE SET. I JUST WANTED THAT TO BE
SHARED FOR THE PUBLIC.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN
THIS MATTER. WE DID SEE THE COMMUNICATION AND RECEIVED MANY
EMAILS. TALKED TO MR. BARR, THE SPECIFICS ARE NOT FINALIZED YET.
THERE IS A DATE. OCTOBER 28, THURSDAY, AT 6:00. OCTOBER 28,
THURSDAY, AT 6:00. AND JOE IS WORKING ON THE AGENDA AND THE
FORMAT. WE HOPE TO HAVE THAT OUT SHORTLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. IF YOU CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION
SOMEHOW, WHETHER IT IS IN AN EMAIL OR IN A DIGEST, NOT A DIGEST,
WEEKLY NIGHT.
>> CITY MANAGER: ABSOLUTELY.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WILL SPEAK TO THIS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
CITY MANAGER AND THANK YOU MAYOR SIDDIQUI FOR ENSURING THE
PUBLIC KNEW ABOUT THIS. THERE ARE SO MANY CONCERNS EXPRESSED
ABOUT THIS PLAN. THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF DEBATE BACK AND FORTH. AND
MOSTLY WHAT PEOPLE WANTED WAS TO MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES WERE
HEARD. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SURPRISED WHEN THE PLAN CAME
OUT, WHICH DOESN'T MEAN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD OUTREACH DIDN'T
HAPPEN, BUT IT DOES MEAN FOR WHATEVER REASON MANY DIDN'T GET THE
MEMO AND WASN'T AS EFFECTIVE. I'M REALLY GLAD WE'LL MOVE FORWARD
WITH A COMMUNITY MEETING. AND GLAD THAT THE CITY MANAGER IS
MOVING FORWARD. WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL AGENDA. I DO THINK, SINCE
I COMMUNICATED, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS RELATED TO THIS
PROJECT THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING AND I DON'T KNOW
IF WHEN THE AGENDA IS SET, THEY CAN INCLUDE IT, WE NEED FULL
COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE PLANS DISSEMINATED. BE SPECIFIC ABOUT
CHANGES AND THE LIMITS, THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT THAT. AND THE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PARKING IMPACT NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY LAID OUT.
AGAIN, SOMETHING IF THERE IS A STREET WITH 20 SPOTS AND WE ADD FIVE
METERS. PLENTY OF SPACE, THAT'S ONE THING. IF IT IS 20 SPOTS AND ADD
FIVE METERS AND RESIDENTS ALREADY NOT ABLE TO PARK, THAT'S A
DIFFERENT SITUATION. THAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND FOR THE PLANNING. I
DON'T THINK IT IS COMMUNICATED TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THE LOADING
ZONES, I THINK THERE'S QUESTION OF THEM BEING MADE INTO PARKING
SPOTS. I HAVE A SISTER IN Rosendale, BOSTON FIGURED OUT HOW TO HAVE
A COMBINED BUS LANE, THAT ALLOWS FOR PARKING, I HOPE THE FIRE

PAGE 25

Jun 1, 2020

DEPARTMENT COMMUNICATES AND UNDERSTANDS HOW THE CONCERNS
ARE ABOUT USING LOADING ZONES FOR PARKING. WE CAN WORK THAT OUT
TO FACILITATE SAVING THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND RESPONDING TO THE
RESIDENTS IN THE AREA. AND WE ALSO KNOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE
CONFUSED. THERE'S A SHORTER TERM BIKE BUILD PLAN AND A
CONSTRUCTION PLAN, MAKING THAT CLEAR SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT
WE'RE DOING NOW AND WHAT MAY END UP IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DON'T
HAVE THE MEDIAN, REACH OUT AND HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FLOW OF
TRAFFIC ALONG THAT PART OF MASS AVE. AND THE ENFORCEMENT PLAN
NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED, NOT JUST FOR CARS, BUT FOR
CYCLISTS, WE HEAR THAT FROM BOTH. SOMETIMES MANY OF THE CYCLISTS, I
DO BOTH, I THINK WE SEE A SMALL MINORITY ON BOTH OF THEM. AND
ENDANGERING PEDESTRIANS, CYCLISTS, AND DRIVERS FEELING SCARED. WE
HAVE TO WORK THAT OUT. AND A PLAN, IT IS UNDERWAY AND MONITOR
USAGE OF THE BIKE LANES TO BE CREATIVE AND UNDERSTAND HOW WELL
THEY ARE USED AND ADJUST. I'M GLAD THIS MEETING IS GOING FORWARD
AND I HOPE THOSE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WE RESPECT THEM AND MOVE FORWARD BEFORE WE DO
ANYTHING THAT SURPRISES MORE PEOPLE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I'M SURE MR. BARR IS LISTENING. WE'LL GO OVER THE
AGENDA AND TRY TO ADDRESS AS MANY OF THE CONCERNS. I WILL REACH
OUT TOMORROW.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRIEFLY COMMENT
THAT I THINK IT IS FINE TO HAVE ANOTHER COMMUNITY MEETING. I DO
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT DELAYING THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF THESE IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURES ON THE ROADS. WE'RE GETTING
THIS WEEK ALMOST DAILY REPORTS OF CRASHES BETWEEN MOTOR VEHICLES
AND BICYCLES. LUCKILY, THEY HAVE MOSTLY BEEN MINOR INJURIES SO FAR.
WE'RE JUST PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH THE LIVES OF OUR
CONSTITUENTS. I SUPPORT ANOTHER COMMUNITY MEETING, BUT I DO
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE MOVE FORWARD SWIFTLY ON IMPLEMENTING
THESE IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, COUNCILLOR
CARLONE, AND THEN COUNCILLOR TOOMEY.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I COULDN'T CONQUER MORE
HEAVILY ABOUT SAFETY FEATURES. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE
EVERYBODY FEELS SAFE. I ALSO HAVE TO SAY AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP TO
SOMETHING COUNCILLOR NOLAN SAID. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE
FEELING LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. SMALL BUSINESS OWNER,
SENIOR CITIZENS, VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF THEM. THEY ARE FEELING VERY
LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. AND THIS IS A CITY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON
OUTREACH. AND I ALWAYS SAY AND I'LL CONTINUE TO SAY, WE CAN DO THE
RIGHT THING THE WRONG WAY. IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK TO HAVE
ANOTHER COMMUNITY MEETING OR TWO OR THREE. WE THINK ABOUT
SENIOR CITIZENS, IN PARTICULAR, THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE
INFORMATION. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN THE IMPLEMENTATION


PAGE 26

Jun 1, 2020

HAS TAKEN PLACE AND IT FEELS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED. WHY DIDN'T I HEAR
MORE ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SENIOR CITIZENS THAT LIVE UP
IN THAT PART OF THE CITY.
I'M HAPPY WE'RE HAVING A MEETING. I DON'T WANT US TO BE AFRAID TO
TAKE THE TIME TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE AS INFORMED AS
POSSIBLE. AND AGAIN, THAT'S SENIOR, PEOPLE THAT HAVE MOBILITY ISSUES,
OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, IF IT MEANS TAKING AN EXTRA STEP TO DO IT
IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN AN AUTHENTIC LEVEL, IT IS
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. I HOPE TO ALL OF US I'M GLAD WE ARE
HAVING THIS MEETING. IF IT MEANS HAVING ANOTHER ONE, THEN SO BE IT.
I HEAR AND I'M SURE YOU HEAR AS WELL FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE UNHEARD.
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US AS A CITY COUNCIL TO REACH OUT TO THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU DON'T HEAR, CAN'T EMAIL YOU 12 TIMES A DAY OR CAN'T CALL
YOU, CAN'T COME TO A MEETING. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US AS A CITY
COUNCIL TO REACH OUT TO THE PEOPLE LEAST HEARD. I'M HAPPY WE'RE
HAVING THIS MEETING. I HOPE THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
MAKE SURE WE ARE WORKING TOWARD THE SAFETY OF ALL INDIVIDUALS
REGARDLESS OF THEIR METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION. WHETHER THEY
WALK, BIKE, OR DRIVE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SAFE. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I THINK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
STATED IT VERY WELL. EVERYBODY ON THE COUNCIL WANTS SAFETY FOR
BICYCLES. BUT NOT AT A LOSS OF BUSINESS OR PEDESTRIANS. AND I SAID
THIS FROM THE BEGINNING, BICYCLE SAFETY IS A PRIORITY, BUT IN ANY
URBAN DESIGN PROJECT, YOU LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED AND YOU
HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ALL THE PEOPLE EQUALLY. AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE. IT MAY NOT BE 100%, IT MAY ONLY BE 85% FOR EVERY GROUP,
BUT IF THE MEDIAN IS THE PROBLEM, THEN THE MEDIAN SHOULD GO.
IT JUST MAKES SENSE. LOOK AT THIS FROM AN URBAN DESIGN, NOT JUST A
TRANSPORTATION DESIGN. WHICH INCLUDES EVERYBODY AFFECTED. AND
I'M SURE WE CAN GET THERE. THERE ARE BICYCLE PATHS, MAYBE THEY ARE
NOT THE BEST RIGHT NOW OR THEY CAN BE SOMEWHAT SAFE, BUT THE
POINT IS, IF THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM PHYSICALLY, THEN WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE BIGGER PROBLEM. AND NOT IGNORE IT BECAUSE THE TEMPORARY
PAINTED ON BIKE PATHS WILL LAST FOREVER AND NOT BE FULLY BUILT AND
PROTECTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE. PAINT DOESN'T PROTECT PEOPLE.
SO I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN THE BROADER WAY AND SAY
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR RETAIL. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR
PEDESTRIANS. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR BICYCLISTS. THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE DOING FOR MASS TRANSIT. WE ALL WANT SMALL BUSINESS TO
SUCCEED, JUST LIKE WE WANT EVERYONE TO BE SAFE. NOTHING IS NEW
THERE. IT IS VERY BASIC. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF
MY COLLEAGUES. ONE THING I HAVEN'T HEARD TONIGHT IS THE PEDESTRIAN
SAFETY FROM BICYCLISTS. I CAN TELL FIRST HAND, MY EXPERIENCE OVER THE
LAST WEEK, ALMOST GETTING STRUCK TWICE IN A CROSSWALK BY A

PAGE 27

Jun 1, 2020

BICYCLIST FLYING THROUGH. I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY ABOUT THE SAME
THING. THE COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT THAT SOME BICYCLISTS HAVE FOR
THE PEDESTRIANS. WE ALL WANT SAFETY FOR EVERYBODY, BUT YOU HAVE
TO COME UP WEAPON A PROCESS THAT PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, PARENTS
WITH STROLLERS, THEY ARE ALL SAFE. IT SEEMS THAT IS IN THIS WHOLE
DISCUSSION, LET ME TELL YOU, I'M TOTALLY DISGUSTED BY THIS PROCESS.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER, THERE WAS NO PROCESS.
THERE WAS NOTHING WAS DONE BUT FLYERS ON TELEPHONE POLES. THE
PUBLIC WASN'T INVOLVE IN THIS. WE HAVE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF EMAILS
FROM RESIDENTS IN THE AREA SAYING WHERE ARE WE IN THE
CONVERSATION. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED ON CAMBRIDGE STREET
PREVIOUSLY. IT WILL HAPPEN ON BROADWAY AND HAMPSHIRE STREET. IT IS
COMING. TO SAY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS,
PEDESTRIANS, WELL THAT LEFT A LONG TIME AGO. THERE WAS NO PUBLIC
INPUT IN THIS AT ALL. IT IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE. AND SO, AT THIS STAGE,
TO SAY I KNOW IT WAS SAID ABOUT MAKING CHANGES. THERE WON'T BE
ANY CHANGES TO THIS THIS MASS AVE THING. NOT AT ALL. IT IS WRITTEN,
IT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL STREETS
ABUTTING MASS AVE, THEY WILL HAVE METERS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.
THESE ARE TAXPAYERS THAT PAY TAXES. THEN THEY CAN'T PARK IN FRONT OF
THEIR HOUSE. I WENT TO THE CLEANERS, TEN METERS IN THE RESIDENTIAL
AREA. IT WILL HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY. THE RESIDENTS
WHO ARE LIVING ON THE SIDE STREETS, THEY WILL HAVE TO BE FEEDING THE
METER AND YOU CAN ONLY PARK FOR TWO HOURS MAXIMUM. WHERE DO
THEY PARK? THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES HERE THAT REALLY ARE NOT
ADDRESSED. I REALLY FEEL BAD FOR THE RESIDENTS, THE SENIORS WHO ARE
BEING IMPACTED BY THIS. THE SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO
SURVIVE.
IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE. TO SAY THERE'S BEEN A PROCESS, IT IS TOTALLY
DISINGENUOUS FROM THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO ON THAT THURSDAY, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER
MEETING. AND IN THAT, I'M SURE WE CAN PROBABLY PULL UP WHAT HAS
BEEN UP TO DATE AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. THERE IS ONE LAST HAND UP.
WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. BRIEFLY, I WAS GOING
TO RAISE THE POINT THAT YOU RAISED. IT WILL BE ANOTHER MEETING,
THERE IS COMMUNITY PROCESS AROUND THIS, A MEETING ON SEPTEMBER
14 ABOUT THAT ON THIS. THIS SECTION FROM DUDLEY STREET TO ALEWIFE. I
WANT TO CORRECT THE RECORD. I'M HAPPY TO SEE MORE OUTREACH BEING
DONE. I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS DO A BETTER JOB REACHING OUT TO
STAKEHOLDERS, BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY AND COMMUNITY
INVOLVEMENT AND WE DID HAVE A MEETING ON THIS AND WE'LL HAVE
ANOTHER ONE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S ALL WHO HAVE THEIR HANDS UP. WE'LL HAVE
MORE INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THAT AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING THIS COMMUNICATION ON

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I PULLED THREE AND FOUR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY. SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED ME.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I THOUGHT SOMEONE ELSE PULLED IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS THREE. MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM
THREE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS SOMETHING FOR AS YOU
NOTED, 25 MOBILE RADIOS. ABOUT $4,000 EACH. AND IT IS GREAT FOR
SNOW VEHICLES. I BELIEVE THIS MAY BE FOR ALL SNOW VEHICLES TO
COMMUNICATE. WE HAVE TO UPDATE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS
ALLOWS THE CITY TO OPTIMIZE ROUTES AND TO TRACK TRUCKS. THAT'S A
QUESTION AND SOMETIMES DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING. DOES THAT
ALLOW FOR THAT TWO WAY COMMUNICATION AND EASIER FOR THE CITY TO
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE TRUCKS ARE GOING ACROSS AND THEREFORE BE
IN A BETTER POSITION TO ENSURE THEY ARE GETTING THE WORK DONE IN
THE MOST OPTIMAL FASHION. IF THAT MAKES SENSE AS A QUESTION,
THROUGH YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER.
>> CITY MANAGER: ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE OWEN ON THE LINE. I WILL HAVE
OWEN ADDRESS IT.
>> OWEN: THANK YOU, MR. CITY MANAGER. THE RADIOS IN AND OF
THEMSELVES DON'T ALLOW US TO TRACK ROUTES AS SUCH. WE DO HAVE
GPS UNITS AND WE HAVE SOFTWARE ON OUR SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW US TO
TRACK THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DRIVES. AND WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE
ON THAT YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT OUR DRIVERS
WILL BE OPERATING IN AN EFFICIENT WAY IN ROUTE OPTIMIZING. THERE IS
AN ADDITIONAL PIECE OF SOFTWARE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE MOST
OPTIMAL ROUTING TO OCCUR FOR THE DRIVERS. THE RADIOS NOT
THEMSELVES THEY ARE PRIMARILY COMMUNICATION DEVICE FOR US WITH
THEM. THEY DON'T ALLOW TRACKING PER SE. WE HAVE GPS UNITS ON ALL
THE VEHICLES. AND THAT DOES ALLOW TRACKING AND WE HAVE SOFTWARE
THAT ALLOWS US TO TRACK THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. BECAUSE OF THIS, I LOOKED UP WHAT
THE CAPACITY OF VARIOUS MUNICIPAL RADIOS ARE. I WAS ASKING UNLESS
SOMEONE ELSE HAS QUESTIONS, TO YIELD AND PASS THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP. ROLL CALL ON THE
APPROPRIATION?

AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM FOUR.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 4).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS YET ANOTHER PURCHASE FOR
OUR FABULOUS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. IT IS 1.5 MILLION FOR NEW FIRE
MADISON, WISCONSIN, IS THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE A ZERO
EMISSION VEHICLE TESTED IN NORTH AMERICA. MADE IN THE USA. THIS IS
NOT A COMPANY BY THE GREEN VEHICLE POLICY WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED
TO JUDGE TWO OTHER LESS EMISSION VEHICLES, SINCE THAT PROBABLY IS
NOT AVAILABLE, I WILL CHARTER RIGHT IT AND GET THE INFORMATION
ABOUT WHY AN ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE IS NOT BEING PROPOSED.
>> CITY MANAGER: CHIEF, YOU ARE ON THE LINE. YOU WANT TO ADDRESS
THIS.
>> YES, I AM. GOOD EVENING. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU. GO AHEAD.
>> SO, ACTUALLY A POINT OF INFORMATION, THE VOLTERO, MANUFACTURED
BY PIERCE, A DIVISION OF OSH KOSH, A VEHICLE IN USE CURRENTLY IN
MADISON, WISCONSIN, IT IS A PROTOTYPE, WHICH IS A LEASE
ARRANGEMENT. I HAD DISCUSSION WITH JIM JOHNSON, THE PRESIDENT OF
PIERCE FIRE APPARATUS, WE WERE OUT THERE IN AUGUST FOR FINAL
INSPECTION OF OUR NEW PIERCE TOWER, WHICH WENT IN SERVICE AT
LADDER TWO IN EAST CAMBRIDGE, WHICH IS EQUIPPED WITH IDLE
REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY. ONE OF THE FIRST PIECES IN THE
COMMONWEALTH TO HAVE THAT GREEN TECHNOLOGY ON IT.
WITH RESPECT TO THE VOLTERA, PIERCE ANTICIPATES THAT MASS
PRODUCTION OF THE VEHICLES IS PROBABLY THREE YEARS AWAY. THEY
DESIGN THIS UNIT WITH MADISON IN MIND BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED IN
APPLETON, WISCONSIN. THEY PROBABLY VISIT THE FIRE STATION WHERE THIS
IS LOCATED. THEY WERE VISITING ALMOST FIVE DAYS A WEEK, AND MAYBE
NOW DOWN TO THREE OR FOUR DAYS. COLLECTING DATA AND POINT OF
INFORMATION, IT IS ACTUALLY A HYBRID. NOT AN ENTIRELY ELECTRIC
VEHICLE. YOU NEED AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WHEN THE VEHICLE
IS PUMPING WATER. BUT FOR VARIOUS RESPONSES AROUND TIME WHEN
THE VEHICLE IS OUT DOING INSPECTIONS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE, IT
CAN OPERATE OFF THE BATTERY PACKAGE.
THEIR SECOND VOLTERA VEHICLE WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE CITY OF
PORTLAND, OREGON, IN THE SPRING OF 22. SPRING OF 2022. AS I SAID, THEY
TOLD ME THEY ANTICIPATE MASS PRODUCTION OF THE VEHICLE IS ABOUT
PROBABLY THREE YEARS AWAY. AND THEY ARE DELIBERATELY TAKING A
SLOW AND METHODICAL APPROACH TO THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE
SURE THEY GET IT RIGHT.
THE DESIGN OF FIRE APPARATUS IS A VERY COMPLEX MATTER FOR A WHOLE
HOST OF REASONS. THE APPARATUS MUST MEET EPA STANDARDS,
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STANDARDS, AND WHEN YOU DESIGN


PAGE 30

Jun 1, 2020

FIRE APPARATUS FOR AN URBAN FIRE DEPARTMENT SUCH AS US, THERE'S A
LOT OF CONCERNS THAT A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO INTO IT.
MAINLY BEING THE CAMBRIDGE FIRE DEPARTMENT TAKES WHAT WE CALL AN
ALL HAZARD APPROACH AND WE CARRY A LOT OF SOPHISTICATED AND
UNIQUE EQUIPMENT ON ALMOST EVERY PIECE OF FIRE APPARATUS IN THE
CITY. FIRE APPARATUS DESIGN IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TYPE OF THING.
THIS REQUEST FOR THE 1.5 MILLION WILL ALLOW US TO GET BACK ON TRACK
WITH OUR APPARATUS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM, WHICH TOOK A HIT
DURING COVID FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS.
FIRE APPARATUS INDUSTRY, LIKE A LOT OF PLACES, HAS SEEN ISSUES WITH
SUPPLY CHANGE PROBLEMS DUE TO PARTS, SO FORTH AND SO ON. THAT'S
KIND OF WHERE WE ARE COMING FROM. I CAN APPRECIATE THE CONCERN
ABOUT WHY AREN'T WE PURCHASING A VOLTERA, THE FACT IS, IT IS NOT
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. I'LL TELL YOU, MR. JOHNSON, JIM
JOHNSON, DID TELL ME THAT THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS ON THE SHORT LIST,
IF YOU WILL, FOR DOWN THE ROAD FOR A POTENTIAL LONG TERM LEASE
ARRANGEMENT WITH ONE OF THE VEHICLES. EVEN THAT IS PROBABLY A
GOOD 2 OR MAYBE 3 YEARS AWAY. THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC. THEY ARE
HOPEFULLY OPTIMISTIC THEY CAN GET INTO MASS PRODUCTION OF THIS IN
THREE YEARS. BUT THEY ARE JUST THEY ARE BEING DELIBERATELY SLOW
AND METHODICAL WITH THIS APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THEY GET IT RIGHT.
THIS IS GOING TO ENTAIL A WHOLE DIFFERENT RECONFIGURATION OF THE
APPARATUS MANUFACTURING LINE AND SO FORTH.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I'M VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THE
REPORT AND THAT YOU HAVE FOLLOWED IT VERY CLOSELY. I DON'T KNOW IF
THERE IS THE ONLY HYBRID ON THE MARKET. I DO KNOW WE HAVE A GREEN
VEHICLE POLICY THAT SAYS WE HAVE YOU MAY NOT KNOW HAVE BEEN
TOLD TO GO THROUGH THIS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EVERY SINGLE
VEHICLE PURCHASE NEEDS TO HAVE EXAMINE TWO ALTERNATIVES. AND
MAKE THE CASE FOR WHICH ONE IS THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY
SUSTAINABLE. IF THAT IS NOT DONE, EVEN IF THIS IS DONE IN WITHOUT
THAT, I THINK WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE POLICY AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE
THE PAPERWORK ABOUT WHAT ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED. AND
THEN THE CASE WILL BE THIS MAY BE PROBABLY THE BEST ONE. AGAIN, LET'S
FOLLOW OUR POLICY AND MAKE SURE WE KNOW AND SCOUR FOR ANY
AVAILABLE HYBRID, I RECOGNIZE THAT IDLE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY IS
IMPORTANT. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER HYBRID MODELS. SINCE I
DON'T KNOW, I WANT THE GREEN VEHICLES POLICY TO BE FOLLOWED AND
FOR US TO THEN HAVE THAT TO ENSURE THAT OUR OWN EFFORTS AT TRYING
TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN AND BE LEADERS IN THIS FIELD ARE
BEING FOLLOWED. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT, I WOULD WANT TO CHARTER
RIGHT IT AND HAVE US COME BACK NEXT WEEK AND WE'LL HAVE THAT
ABOUT WHAT IS CONSIDERED. I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE ANYTHING IF
WE ARE JUST VOTING THIS IN ANOTHER WEEK. UNLESS WE HAVE DONE THAT
AND SOMEONE CAN PROVIDE THE BACKUP.
>> CITY MANAGER: CHIEF?

Jun 1, 2020

>> MY UNDERSTANDING, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INSTRUCTED THAT ACTUAL
EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE EXEMPT
FROM THE GREEN VEHICLE COMMITTEE REGULATIONS. I WILL TELL YOU
THAT ALL OF OUR SUPPORT VEHICLES, STAFF VEHICLES, THEY HAVE GONE
BEFORE THE GREEN COMMITTEE. WE HAVE BEEN BUYING HYBRID VEHICLES
FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WE HAVE TWO VEHICLES ON ORDER TO REPLACE THE
DEPUTY CHIEF VEHICLES THAT ARE CURRENTLY, I BELIEVE, NINE OR TEN YEARS
OLD. BOTH ARE HYBRIDS AND APPROVED BY THE GREEN COMMITTEE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL FOLLOW UP. I THINK THE CHIEF IS ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT. THESE VEHICLES ARE EXEMPT. HOWEVER, I THINK THE CHIEF'S
EXPLANATION ON HOW FAR WE GO TO MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING TO
MAKE THE GREEN FLEET CONDITIONS RESPONSIBLE IS SOMETHING HE TAKES
GREAT PRIDE IN. THE VEHICLES TAKE A LONG TIME TO COME. THE SAFETY OF
OUR RESIDENTS IS A TOP PRIORITY AND I'D HOPE THAT WE CAN GET A VOTE
ON THIS TODAY. I THINK THE CHIEF HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO MAKE
SURE HE MET THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED AND AS KNOWLEDGEABLE AS
POSSIBLE. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN I RECOGNIZE
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I UNDERSTAND. WE NEED TO BE MORE ACTIVE AND
PROACTIVE ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
KIND OF GREEN FLEET. WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. WE HAD IT ON THE BOOKS
FOR A LONG TIME. THE CHIEF KNOWS MORE WITH NONE INCLUDED IN THE
BACKUP, WHICH MEANS WE DON'T TELL THE PUBLIC WE ARE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING OUR WORK AND FOLLOWING
THE POLICY. IF IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO MOVE IT FORWARD, I WON'T
CHARTER RIGHT IT. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE ASKED FOR THE
BACKUP OF A GREEN FLEET. IF EMERGENCY VEHICLES ARE NOT SUBJECT, WE
NEED TO CHANGE THAT. EVERY PURCHASE HAS TO BE JUST REVIEWED FROM
THE POINT OF VIEW WHAT IS THE BEST FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IT DOESN'T
SLOW ANYTHING DOWN.
>> CITY MANAGER: HERE IS OWEN, TOO.
>> OWEN: THANK YOU. EMERGENCY VEHICLES, AS THE CHIEF HAS
INDICATED, THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM CONSIDERATION. UNDER THE GREEN
FLEETS POLICY AS THINGS STAND.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS
RAISED BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CHIEF HAS
ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS AND I BELIEVE THEY ARE LOOKING AT ALL
OPTIONS AND CLEARLY AREN'T BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE JUST YET. I THINK
IT MAY BE WORTH OUR WHILE TO LOOK AT THE POLICY AGAIN AND UPDATE
IT NOW THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE ON THE HORIZON AND BECOMING
AVAILABLE. MAYBE WE CAN BEGIN TO INCLUDE OUR EMERGENCY VEHICLES
AS WELL. I DO THINK WE SHOULD VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT AND GIVE OUR
STAFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PURCHASE AND
COME BACK IN THE FUTURE WITH THE BEST OPTIONS AVAILABLE ON THE

MARKET.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I HAD A QUESTION AROUND THE
COST OF THESE. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE ORDERING TWO. $750,000 FOR
EACH. I FEEL LIKE I REMEMBER THE LAST TWO LADDER TRUCKS WE BOUGHT
WERE SLIGHTLY MAYBE AROUND $500,000. THAT'S MY MEMORY. I
COULDN'T FIND THEM TODAY. I'M CURIOUS, IS MY MEMORY CORRECT? ARE
PUMPER TRUCKS THAT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE? IT FEELS LIKE A BIG JUMP?
>> CHIEF MAHONEY: THE RECENT TOWER LADDER THAT WAS PURCHASED IN
SERVICE IN EAST CAMBRIDGE HAD A PRICE TAG OF JUST UNDER $1.5 FOR A
LADDER TRUCK. THE LAST TWO PUMPERS, ENGINE TWO AND ENGINE FIVE IN
INMEN SQUARE, THEY ARE ABOUT $600,000 WITH THE INCREASE IN COSTS
AND ALSO THE ISSUE THAT WE LOOK AT WITH THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN
ISSUE, WE ANTICIPATE THE COST OF THESE VEHICLES AND THERE'S A
BENEFIT TO THE CITY OF PURCHASING TWO UNITS TOGETHER. FOR
ENGINEERING PURPOSES, WHEN YOU BUY MORE THAN ONE VEHICLE, THEY
GIVE US A DISCOUNT. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, THE 1.5 MILLION WILL
COVER THE TWO PUMPERS WITH SOME POSSIBLE, FOR A LACK OF A BETTER
TERM, SOMEWHAT ANTICIPATED POSSIBLE SURPRISES IN ITEMS THAT MAY
HAVE TO BE ADDED IN THE DESIGN DOWN THE ROAD.
THEY HAVE CURRENTLY INFORMED ME THAT DELIVERY IS PROBABLY
ANYWHERE FROM 12 14 MONTHS FOLLOWING EXECUTION OF A CONTRACT.
AGAIN, THE FIRE APPARATUS INDUSTRY, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, IS BEING
AFFECTED BY THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. WE'RE SEEING IT WITH
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURES, CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, ALL KINDS OF
THINGS. THAT'S WHY I WOULD SAY THIS IS A VERY TIMELY MATTER. AND I
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE CITY COUNCIL TAKE A FAVORABLE
DISPOSITION ON THIS REQUEST.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. MY NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND
DELIVERY. I DID FOLLOW LADDER 1 AND 2 ON PIERCE'S TWITTER. AND
WATCHED HOW LONG IT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THE TRUCKS
OPERATIONAL AND ON THE ROAD. I AGREE WITH YOU IT IS AN EXPEDITIOUS
MATTER. THE OTHER QUESTION IS AROUND YOU MENTIONED THERE'S
URBAN CONCERNS FOR CAMBRIDGE. ONE CONCERN IS VISION ZERO GOALS
AND HOW LONG THE TRUCKS ARE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE LENGTH OF OUR
TRUCKS AND HOW WE MOVE TO A SHORTER LENGTH TO ENSURE WE DON'T
HAVE INCIDENTS ON THE ROAD AND WE WORK IN A VERY TIGHT URBAN
ENVIRONMENT. I'M CURIOUS THE LENGTH OF THE TRUCKS AND IF THEY ARE
SHORTER THAN THE ONES WE HAD IN THE PAST OR THE SAME?
>> CHIEF MAHONEY: THESE PUMPERS THAT WE HOPE TO PURCHASE WILL BE
DESIGNED VERY MUCH ALONG THE DESIGN OF ENGINE 2 AND ENGINE 5. THE
ISSUE THAT WE RUN INTO, IT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO EXPLAIN. NFPA
STANDARDS DICTATE CERTAIN CHASSIS CONFIGURATION, ABILITY TO CARRY A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT, WE BUY OUR PUMPERS TO CARRY 500
GALLONS OF WATER BECAUSE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THAT MINIMUM OF


PAGE 33

Jun 1, 2020

500 GALLONS IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT FOR A QUICK FIRE ATTACK
BEFORE WE CAN SECURE A LINE WATER SUPPLY FROM A HYDRANT.
500 GALLONS OF WATER IS ABOUT 4,000 POUNDS. TWO ADDITIONAL TONS
OF WEIGHT ADDED TO THE VEHICLE BY CARRYING 500 GALLONS OF WATER.
THAT KIND OF DICTATES SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE OF
THE VEHICLE. I CAN ASSURE YOU SINCE 2017, IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND
FOR WHAT IT IS OTHER WO, I WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE "CAMBRIDGE
CHRONICLE" WHEN I WAS REAPPOINTED. AND I SAID MY TWO TOP
PRIORITIES WERE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE FIRE
HOUSES AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE FLEET OF THE FIRE
APPARATUS THAT WE HAD BEEN PURCHASING.
THE TWO MOST RECENT PUMPER PURCHASES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER
THAN PUMPER PURCHASES IN THE PAST. AND THAT'S AT NO DISRESPECT TO
CHIEF REARDON, THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT WERE SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT. A POINT OF INFORMATION, THE NEW TOWER LADDER IN EAST
CAMBRIDGE, IRONICALLY IT REPLACED A TOWER THAT WAS 95 FEET IN
LENGTH, THE HEIGHT OF THE ARIAL. WE REPLACED IT WITH A 100 FOOT
ARIAL. YET, THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE IS SEVEN FEET SHORTER THAN THE
EXISTING TOWER. I TAKE THE ISSUE OF SHORTENING UP THE LENGTH OF THE
VEHICLE, MAKING THE WHEEL BASE IT IS MANEUVERABLE IN A TIGHT URBAN
CONGESTED AREA. YOU CAN ATTEMPT TO SHORTEN THE VEHICLE MORE,
WHAT YOU DO, YOU SACRIFICE THE ABILITY TO CARRY CERTAIN EQUIPMENT.
YOU SACRIFICE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A ROOMY ENOUGH CAB FOR THE FIRE
FIGHTERS TO BE IN. IT MAKES IT THERE'S ISSUES WITH ERGONOMICS THAT
GO INTO IT. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE TAKE THE DESIGN OF THE
APPARATUS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IT IS A PRIORITY. THERE ARE
CERTAIN INTERLOCKING PIECES, IF YOU WILL, THAT DICTATE THE CERTAIN
DIMENSIONS THAT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE IN THE SPECIFICATIONS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE YOU ANSWERED THE
QUESTION. IS IT SHORTER THAN TRUCKS WE PURCHASED IN THE PAST?
>> IT'LL BE ROUGHLY THE SAME LENGTH AS ENGINE 2 AND 5. WE CAN'T
REALLY SHORTEN UP THE VEHICLE AND STILL CARRY THE EQUIPMENT WE ARE
REQUIRED TO CARRY. THOSE PUMPS, IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE FIRE
FIGHTERS AT ENGINE 2 AND 5, THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY ARE EASY TO
MANEUVER AROUND THE CITY STREETS. IN ORDER TO HAVE A PROPERLY,
SAFELY DESIGNED VEHICLE, TO CARRY EQUIPMENT, AND CARRY FIRE
PERSONNEL, THEY ARE AS SHORT AS THEY CAN BE WHILE MAINTAINING A
CERTAIN LEVEL OF SAFETY AND COMFORT FOR THE PERSONNEL.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL? HEARING NONE, WE
CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION?

PAGE 35

Jun 1, 2020

AND HERE WE HAVE A COMMUNICATION FROM MEMBERS OF THE
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
TO CARL BARON PLAZA ON THEM. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GIVE
THEM A FAIR HEARING AS WELL.
THEY ARE MAKING VERY SPECIFIC REQUESTS, INCLUDING REPAIRS TO THE
BRICK IN THE SIDEWALKS, DEMANDS THAT THE AMAZON STORE REPLACE THE
DOORS BECAUSE THEY CONSTANTLY OPEN INTO THE SIDEWALK AND INJURE
PEOPLE. REQUEST TO INSTALL DRINKING FT. AND WATER BOTTLE REFILL
STATIONS, HANDWASHING STATION, NARCAN DISTRIBUTION, TRASH CAN
AND RECYCLING BARRELS, DISPENSERS FOR DOG WASTE BAGS. SOME TYPE
OF KITCHEN INSTALLATION. PERSONALLY, I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT INSTEAD OF
THE AMAZON STORE. A MESSAGE BOARD, WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO
GET INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE. INFORMATION TO PEOPLE THAT PASS BY
THERE OR SPEND TIME IN THE PLAZA AND ELECTRICAL OUTLETS SO PEOPLE
CAN CHARGE THEIR ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING WHEELCHAIRS AND
CELL PHONES AND LAPTOPS. AND PRESERVING THE TREES, THAT PROVIDE
COVER FOR PEOPLE THERE. AND THIS ONE REALLY STRUCK ME TO POST OF A
SCHEDULE OF WHAT TIME THE SPRINKLERS GET ON SO PEOPLE DON'T GET
SOAKED WHILE SITTING THERE. THOSE ARE REASONABLE REQUESTS AND I'D
HOPE THAT WE CAN TAKE SOME TIME TO LOOK AT THEM AND
ACCOMMODATE THEM AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT SPACE FOR
PEOPLE FOR UNHOUSED IN THE COMMUNITY.
I WANT TO REMIND US THAT... I'M SORRY. SOMEONE IS NOT ON MUTE. I
WANT TO REMIND US THAT WE DO HAVE A POLICY ORDER THAT READS THE
CITY MANAGER BE AND HEREBY REQUEST TO WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATE
DEPARTMENTS AND STAFF, INCLUDING COMMISSION FOR PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES, TO NOT USE (INAUDIBLE) PUBLIC SPACES OR REDESIGNED,
INCLUDING IN THE UPCOMING REDESIGN OF CAROL BARRON PLAZA AND
CREATE GUIDELINES THAT ENSURE THE PUBLIC SPACES ARE WELCOMING TO
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. SO, I HOPE THAT WE CAN TAKE THESE REQUESTS
VERY SERIOUSLY AND COME UP WITH WAYS TO ADDRESS THEM.
I'M GOING TO EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT. I'M HAPPY TO HEAR FROM MY
COLLEAGUES BEFORE I DO THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS
FORWARD. I WOULD AGREE. MAYBE INSTEAD OF EXERCISING YOUR CHARTER
RIGHT, INSTEAD OF PLACING ON FILE, WE CAN REFER IT TO THE CITY
MANAGER SO IT IS IN FRONT OF HIM AND ON THE DESK AND ASK FOR A
RESPONSE. I THINK WE CAN DO THAT? I LOOK AT THE CLERK?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN DO THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: MAYBE THAT'S A SUGGESTION AND WE CAN
HEAR BACK FROM HIM AND INCLUDE REACHING OUT TO FOLKS IN THE
COMMUNITY. MAYBE WE CAN SET UP A MEETING TO DO THAT. THEY DO
SEEM LIKE REASONABLE REQUESTS. I THINK SOME OF THIS IS BEING DONE,
BASED ON THINGS I HAVE SEEN. IT GOES TO SHOW THE LACK OF
COMMUNICATION. IF SOME OF THE STUFF IS BEING DONE, CLEARLY SOME OF


PAGE 36

Jun 1, 2020

THE FOLKS DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. JUST AN OPTION. OBVIOUSLY, IT IS
UP TO YOU TO AND EXERCISE YOUR CHARTER RIGHT. I THINK THAT IS
ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO REFER IT TO THE
MANAGER. DOES THAT TURN IT INTO A POLICY ORDER? I'M NOT SURE HOW
THAT WORKS?
>> MR. CLERK: I DO NOT BELIEVE IT TURNS IT INTO A POLICY ORDER. IT
WOULD BE REFERRED TO THE CITY MANAGER WITH A NOTE THAT THE
COUNCIL IS LOOKING FOR A RESPONSE TO THIS COMMUNICATION.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. I'M GOING TO EXERCISE MY CHARTER
RIGHT. I WILL REACH OUT TO THE MANAGER AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE
BEST WAY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?

Resolutions #’s 1 and 3-11
Adopted

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION NUMBER TWO. (READING
RESOLUTION NUMBER 2).
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE MY COLLEAGUES
THAT JOIN ME IN THE RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF OUR ANIMAL
CONTROL COMMISSION, ESPECIALLY CHRISTINA, MICHAEL, FOR PUTTING
TOGETHER FOOD SECURITY EFFORT FOR OUR RESIDENTS FOR THEIR PETS.
THIS IS BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY, PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, I WAS OUTSIDE
CEOC AND SAW A BIG SHIPMENT BEING BROUGHT OVER BY THE ANIMAL
CONTROL COMMISSION. IT WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FOOD. AND I
THINK WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE LOW INCOME WHO
HAVE PETS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR PET FOOD BILLS, ESPECIALLY
FOR ANIMALS THAT GAVE PEOPLE SO MUCH COMFORT OVER THE TIME OF
THE PANDEMIC. JUST TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE FOOD PANTRY AND GET PET
FOOD AND TAKE THAT EASE AND BURDEN OFF THE RESIDENTS SO THE PETS
HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CITY EMPLOYEES,
ANIMAL CONTROL COMMISSION, FOR DOING THIS ON THEIR OWN. FOR
RECOGNIZING A NEED IN THE COMMUNITY AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
HAPPENING. UNTIL I SAW IT IN THE "CHRONICLE." I SAW THE IT IN THE
DELIVERY. I SAY THANK YOU TO THE TEAM AT THE ANIMAL CONTROL
COMMISSION FOR PUTTING TOGETHER AND TAKING CARE OF RESIDENTS.
THIS IS ONE SMALL WAY CAMBRIDGE FEELS IT REALLY CARES ABOUT THE
RESIDENTS. I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK.

Resolution #2 Adopted
Thanks to Christina Correia,
Director, the team at the
Animal Commission, and the
Pet Food Task Force for their
innovation to solve the growing
need for pet food within
Cambridge.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE RESOLUTION
FORWARD. ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION?

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER ONE. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 1).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I BRING THIS FORWARD FOR THE
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE SPENT TIME REFURBISHING GREEN ROSE PARK AND
REDEDICATED IN THE HONOR (INAUDIBLE). COMMUNITY PARK NAMED AFTER
TWO EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN. THAT BEING SAID, THERE ARE VOLLEYBALL
AND OTHERS, MOSTLY VOLLEYBALL THAT COME AT NIGHT AND PLAY. IT IS
REALLY RUINING, DAMAGING THE GRASS AT GREEN ROSE PARK. IT IS
DAMAGING AND INHIBITING THE USE BY OTHERS TO SIT AND RECREATE. I ASK
THAT YOU ADOPT THIS ORDER IN AN EFFORT TO RESTORE THE PARK AND THE
GRASS WHERE PEOPLE COME AND RECREATE. WE MAKE AN EFFORT TO
RESTORE TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE VOLLEYBALLERS CAME AND MAYBE
PUT A SIGN THAT SAYS WHO CAN AND CANNOT USE IT WITHOUT ADVANCED
PERMISSION.
THIS IS THE INTENT BEHIND THE POLICY ORDER. TO RESTORE IT TO ITS
RICHNESS AND I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I DON'T HEAR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS.
AND WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WILL BE QUICK. I CERTAINLY
AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. PART OF THE ISSUE IS THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS 20% OF THE OPEN SPACE. AND EVEN IF WE REPAIR IT,
WITH THE HEAVY USE, WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK THERE AGAIN IN A FEW
YEARS. I'M ALL FOR REPAIRING IT. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME. I'M JUST
SAYING, WE HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE OPEN SPACE IN UNDERSERVED
NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S REALLY THE FULL ANSWER TO THIS ISSUE. THANK
YOU. (ECHO FEEDBACK).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WAS NOT COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. ANYBODY ELSE?

POLICY ORDER #1
ADOPTED
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to direct
the Public Works Department
to repair the grass at GreeneRose Heritage Park and ensure
that the area is kept wellmaintained

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. TO REFRESH EVERYBODY, IN 2019,
MYSELF, THE MAYOR, AND OTHERS, ADVOCATE FOR A PATHWAYS CLASS TO
BE BUILT HERE AT THE MIT JOB CONNECTOR. THEY HAD PROGRAMS IN
DORCHESTER FOR YEARS AND RESIDENTS DIDN'T TAKE PART OF THAT
OPPORTUNITY AND A CHANCE AT A GREAT JOB WITH BENEFITS AND
PROTECTIONS. BUILDING PATHWAYS IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES HANDS
ON AND RELATIVE JOB RELATED SKILLS TO THOSE THAT LOOK TO ENTER
CAREER TRADES. THERE IS THE FIRST CLASS, BUT BECAUSE OF COVID, NO
CLASSES IN 2020 OR 2021. FOR THE CLASS BEING RECRUITED, WE HAVE TO
ENSURE IT STAYS HERE AND RESIDENTS ARE PRIORITIZED. I WORK WITH THE
TEAM TO DESIGN A NEW SIX WEEK PROGRAM CALLED THE INTRODUCTION TO
BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ALL
RECEIVED AN EMAILED FROM SARAH AT MIT ON FRIDAY. THROUGH THE
PROGRAM, WE'LL PROVIDE THE SAME VITAL SERVICES IN ADDITION TO
MENTORS TO PARTICIPANTS IN AN EARLIER STAGE IN THE CAREER. THEY WILL
ENTER THE PROGRAM BEFORE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE BUILDING
PATHWAYS, JUMP STARTING THE FAMILIARITY WITH THE TRADE.
COMPLETION, THEY CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO
matriculate INTO THE PROGRAM OR JUMP INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP
PROGRAM. IT IS VITAL WE DON'T ASK THEM TO TRAVEL TO DORCHESTER.
AND ANNUALLY, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN THE
CITY AND WE HAVE RESIDENTS WHO NUMBER IN THE HUNDREDS IN THE
TRADES. WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE PATHWAYS FOR RESIDENTS INTO THE JOBS
AND KEEP THIS PROGRAM HERE AND PRIORITIZE OUR RESIDENTS AS A
CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THAT.
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MAYOR SIDDIQUI, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS,
AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, FOR JOINING ME IN THIS EFFORT AND I HOPE
THE COLLEAGUES CAN REAFFIRM WE NEED THE BUILDING PATHWAYS HERE
IN CAMBRIDGE. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK VICE MAYOR
MALLON, NOT JUST FOR THIS POLICY ORDER, BUT FOR ALL HER WORK ON
THIS AS WELL AS MIT, THE JOB CONNECTOR, THE BUILDING TRADES. WE
HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE UPWARD MOBILITY
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG ADULTS IN THE CITY WHO ARE FINDING IT
HARD TO FIND JOB S THAT PAY WELL. AND WE HAVE ALL BEEN WE ALL
KNOW THAT JOBS IN LABOR UNIONS AND CONSTRUCTION, YOU CAN EARN
SOME DECENT MONEY AND THOSE UNION JOBS HAVE BEEN PATHWAYS TO


PAGE 40

Jun 1, 2020

THE MIDDLE CLASS.
I JUST CAN'T EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR HAVING A PROGRAM HERE AS VICE
MAYOR MALLON SAID. WE KNOW FROM HISTORY, A LOT OF OUR YOUNG
ADULTS WILL NOT GO OR DO NOT GO TO DORCHESTER FOR THE TRAININGS
THAT HAPPEN THERE. THESE ARE PEOPLE PAID TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
TRAININGS. THERE ARE VARIOUS OBSTACLES TO BEING PART AND ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS TO GIVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN
CAMBRIDGE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THIS FIELD IS SOMETHING WE
SHOULD DO. THANK YOU, VICE MAYOR MALLON AND TO EVERYBODY WHO IS
INVOLVED IN THIS. OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IT AS WELL. IT
IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. I HOPE THAT THEY WILL HEAR THIS AND
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ON MAKING SURE WE HAVE ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE? I SEE COUNCILLOR
TOOMEY AND I SEE FIRST WE HAVE COUNCILLOR CARLONE, THEN
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, AND THEN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WILL BE QUICK. I'M THE
BYPRODUCT OF SUCH A PROGRAM. MY FATHER BEGAN WORKING AS A
CARPENTER IN NEW YORK CITY. EVENTUALLY, BECAME A SUPERINTENDENT
OF BUILDING HIGH RISE BUILDINGS, MULTIFAMILY UNITS ON ROOSEVELT
ISLAND SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS BECAUSE HE GOT A BREAK. HE DIDN'T
WANT TO GO ON TO COLLEGE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, THAT ALLOWED ME
TO GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE HE HAD A DECENT LIVING. IN FACT, I HAD
CONSTRUCTION JOBS AS PART OF A UNION AS WELL DURING SUMMERS.
THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM. THE MORE WE CAN DO FOR IT, THE BETTER. AS I
SAID, I'M AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THE NEXT GENERATION. AND
I'M VERY GRATEFUL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK VICE MAYOR
MALLON, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, EXCUSE ME. JUST ONE SECOND.
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI FOR SPONSORING THIS. I'D
LIKE TO ADD MY NAME AND I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE MAKE THIS
UNANIMOUS. MOVE SUSPENSION TO MAKE THIS POLICY ORDER
UNANIMOUS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ALREADY HAVE IT BE UNANIMOUS. BECAUSE
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS MADE THAT MOTION I'M SORRY. WHAT DAY IS IT?
WE DEFINITELY CAN ADD YOU, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. AND THEN WE CAN
ADD THE REST. WE CAN HEAR FROM COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN LET'S
DO A ROLL CALL TO ADD EVERYONE ELSE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. FIRST, I WANT TO REACH OUT AND
ACKNOWLEDGE VICE MAYOR MALLON WHEN SHE GAVE ME A CALL AND SAID
SHE WAS INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. I WAS ON BOARD FOR A NUMBER OF
REASONS. FIRST, WHAT WE HAVE FOUND SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I MENTIONED


PAGE 41

Jun 1, 2020

THIS BEFORE, ABOUT A DECADE AGO, I INTRODUCED THE DREAM JOBS
PROGRAM, ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS IN THE PROGRAM, FOLKS
FROM CAMBRIDGE WOULDN'T GO TO BOSTON TO THE CHINESE CULTURAL
CENTER TO DO THE TRAINING. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO DO IT IN CAMBRIDGE.
WENT INTO BOSTON, WE HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT WENT ALL THE
WAY THROUGH. OF A CLASS OF IN EXCESS OF TEN, DOWN TO A CLASS OF
TWO. AND PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE
CAMBRIDGE. IT IS A GOOD THING, THAT'S A BAD THING. GOOD THING, IT
SAYS TO US THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO THEIR TRAINING IN CAMBRIDGE.
THEY CAN DO IT HERE. SEE IT HERE. THEY WILL PAYMENT HERE AND BENEFIT
PARTICIPATE HERE AND THE BENEFIT HERE. THE FACADE, THERE ARE A LOT
OF IMPEDIMENTS THAT WE COULDN'T REMOVE QUICKLY ENOUGH. WE LOST
MEMBERS AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE. I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS
ORDER BECAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE HERE, PARTICULARLY FOR THE BLACK
AND BROWN COMMUNITY. THAT MAY NOT GO OUT OF CAMBRIDGE FOR
VARIOUS REASONS, TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION. IT IS IMPORTANT WE TRY
TO ADVOCATE THAT WE DEMAND THAT WE REALLY PUSH TO MAKE SURE THE
PATHWAYS PROGRAM STAYS HERE AND WE GROW IT. WE ARE DELIBERATE
AND INTENTIONAL ON GROWING THIS PROGRAM. I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR
EVERYBODY ON THE CALL, THE LAST TIME YOU CALLED A PLUMBER OR A
LABORER TYPE OF JOB, MAYBE YOU CHOSE WRONGLY OVER THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY YOU PAID. AS NOBLE AS IT IS. I'M GLAD THIS IS BEFORE US AND
HAPPY TO BE A SIGNATURE ON IT AND I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL ADOPT IT. I
YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND ADD THE ENTIRE
COUNCIL AND ON THE MOTION, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.

Enire City Council added as
sponsors to Policy Order #2

>> MR. CLERK: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED?
>> MR. CLERK: AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. WE ARE ON POLICY ORDER 4. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 4). I THANK THE COSPONSORS FOR JOINING ME ON THIS. I
THINK WE ALL KNOW, SOME OF US HAVE SPOKEN TO THE NEW NOT SO
NEW, FORMER VICE MAYOR, WHO IS THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS HEAD AT LESLEY ABOUT THEIR PLANS. AND HOW
THEY ARE SELLING A PORTION OF THE REAL ESTATE IN A FEW PRIME AREAS
AROUND CAMBRIDGE. WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE
YEARS ABOUT PRIORITIES THAT CAN BE MET WITH APPROPRIATE SPACE. TALK
ABOUT PRE SCHOOL, UNIVERSAL PRE K, HOUSING. AND NOW THIS
UNIVERSITY PARTNER ANNOUNCED THEY PLAN TO SELL, IT PROVIDES A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT THEY PUT ON THE MARKET COULD MATCH THE
CITY'S NEEDS.

POLICY ORDEER #2
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
That the City Council go on
record prioritizing Cambridge
residents for Building
Pathways

I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE MANAGER AND
LESLEY TO IDENTIFY WHAT PRIORITIES COULD BE MET WITH PURCHASE OF
LAND FROM LESLEY AND THE REALLY KEY AREAS. I THINK PASSING THIS WE
CAN GO AHEAD. I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME EARLY CONVERSATIONS, BUT


PAGE 42

Jun 1, 2020

NOW WE CAN REALLY GO ON AND DO MORE. I SEE COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I THINK WHEN THAT PLAN HIT THE
NEWS, WE ALL THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY THAT WE SHOULD SEE IF THE CITY
CAN DO SOMETHING. IT IS OFTEN A LACK OF SPACE THAT PREVENTED US OR
WE SAY WE NEED MORE SPACE. THIS IS IN THE HEART OF TOWN, WHICH IS
SOMETHING TO BE USED FOR A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. WE HAVE
SO MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK OF USING SMALLER SPACES RIGHT IN
THE HEART OF THE CITY. I WILL NOTE, SINCE LESLEY HAS THE
RESPONSIBILITIES OF A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION, EDUCATIONAL
ORGANIZATION, WE ARE A GOOD PARTNER FOR THEM. THEY HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS TO THE COMMUNITY, ENSURE THIS IS THE
BEST USE OF THE COMMUNITY. I THINK IT COULD BE AN EXCELLENT
PARTNERSHIP FOR THE CITY TO STEP IN AND TALK WITH THEM. I'M GLAD YOU
HAVE STARTED THE CONVERSATIONS AND I KNOW I STAND READY AND VERY
EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF US BEING IN A DEEPER PARTNERSHIP. I KNOW
LESLEY DEVELOPED SO MANY PROGRAMS FOR OUR STUDENTS AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL, THEY ARE ABOUT TO EXTEND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THEIR
HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. MANY PEOPLE I KNOW, THEY HAVE GONE
THROUGH THE LESLEY PROGRAM AND BECOME TEACHERS. I'M REALLY HAPPY
THIS IS ON THE AGENDA AND I HOPE THE CITY TAKES THIS SERIOUSLY AND
MOVE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. I STAND READY IF YOU NEED HELP AS WE
MOVE THIS FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. THANK YOU. ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE ON TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 6. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 6). I WANT TO PULL THIS TO SAY I THANK THE
COSPONSORS AS WE ALL ARE AWARE, CAMBRIDGE HAS RECEIVED A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN
MONEY. I'M SORRY. AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDS, ALMOST $65
MILLION. AND I THINK IT IS A HUGE SUM OF MONEY THAT CAN HELP US
ACCOMPLISH A NUMBER OF GOALS. AS I MENTIONED, IN OTHER
COMMUNITIES SUCH AS BOSTON, COMMITTEES AND TASK FORCES HAVE
BEEN FORMED TO DISCUSS THE BEST WAY TO UTILIZE THE FUNDS. I THINK
CAMBRIDGE SHOULD DO SOMETHING SIMILAR AND I THINK THE CITY
MANAGER IS IN AN AGREEMENT WITH THIS. RESIDENTS SHOULD GET A
VOICE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FINANCE COMMITTEE CO
CHAIRS, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR CARLONE, HAVE BEEN
VERY HELPFUL IN GETTING THE CONVERSATION STARTED. IN THIS SUMMER
WITH COMMITTEE HEARING AND GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE DO HAVE
TO SPEND THE MONEY, WE HAVE UNTIL END OF 2024. I THINK WE HAVE
SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW SOME OF THIS MONEY CAN BE
ALLOCATED WITH THE HELP OF THE PUBLIC.

POLICY #4 ADOPTED
That the City Manager is
requested to determine the
feasibility of purchasing
property from Lesley
University to address City
goals.

I WANTED TO PUT THIS ON THE RECORD SO WE CAN START PLANNING WITH
THE FINANCE CO CHAIRS AND OTHER AND CITY MANAGER ON A PROCESS.
COUNCILLOR NOLAN?

Jun 1, 2020

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED TO THIS.
I THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT OFTEN. SINCE
WE HEARD ABOUT THE FUNDS, AS YOU SAID, IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING
THAT WILL ALLOW THE CITY AND THE COUNCIL WORKING TOGETHER, I THINK,
TO DO MANY PROJECTS WE MAY NOT HAVE WE HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO
MOVE FORWARD. THIS WILL PROVIDE US WITH THAT EXTRA AMOUNT OF
FUNDING THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DECIDE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO
HAVE COMMUNITY INPUT. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND
WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN DO THAT. GO TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
FIRST.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. PLEASED TO BE A SPONSOR, MY CO
CHAIR AND I DON'T THINK I'M SPEAKING OUT OF TURN TO SPEAK FOR HIM IN
SOME WAY TO SAY WE HAVE BEEN EAGER TO APPLY AS MUCH COMMUNITY
OUTREACH AS POSSIBLE. THE MORE THAT WE TALK TO OUR RESIDENTS, OR
CONSTITUENTS, THE BETTER THEY ARE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO
WITH THE MONEY AND THEN WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO WITH
THE MONEY. WE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STAND
WITH YOU, BUT TO PUSH THIS OUTWARD SO THAT AS MANY PEOPLE AS
POSSIBLE CAN BE AWARE AND CAN GIVE US INPUT. I THINK IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNCIL TO ASK PEOPLE TO REACH OUT, BUT THAT WE
REACH OUT. I STAND IN FULL SUPPORT AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL
SUPPORT IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. OF COURSE, I
AGREE WITH MY FELLOW CO CHAIR FROM THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. THIS
MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE THOSE WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY COVID.
MOST PEOPLE IN NEED. I THINK WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BETTER THAN
DOING EXACTLY THAT. FINDING OUT WHAT IS MOST NEEDED. I SHARE WITH
MY CO CHAIR HER ATTITUDE ABOUT THIS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE
MEETINGS. TAKE CARE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE CAN GO AHEAD AND DO A ROLL CALL
ON ADDING COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO THE ORDER.

Motion to add Councillor
Nolan as a cosponsor to Policy
Order #6

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AND ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE ORDER AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR,
ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE ON TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 11. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 11).

POLICY ORDER #6
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
That the City Manager is
requested to appoint a task
force that will hold regular
public meetings to solicit ideas
and feedback from residents on
the distribution of American
Rescue Plan Act funds

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. THIS CAME OUT OF
THE CLIMATE CRISIS WORKING GROUP. IT WAS A SUGGESTION FROM
AUDREY, WHO IS ONE OF THE NATIONAL LEADERS IN THIS EFFORT TO TRY TO


PAGE 44

Jun 1, 2020

FIND AN ALTERNATIVE PATH TOWARDS ELECTRIFICATION BY ENCOURAGING
PILOTS FROM EVERSOURCE AND NATIONAL GRID, THE UTILITIES TO TRY WHAT
THEY CALL GEO MICRO GRIDS. THE WORDING OF THE RESOLVE PARAGRAPH,
A PROPOSE SITE LOCATION, WITHOUT SPECIFYING, IT WAS DELIBERATE
BECAUSE IT WAS SAID THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSIONS AND THEY WERE IN
DISCUSSION WITH CITY ABOUT THE SITE LOCATION. THERE WASN'T A
SPECIFIC ONE SELECTED YET. SHE SUGGESTED WE PHRASE IT THIS WAY. I
THINK IT MAY BE BETTER. THERE'S AN AMENDMENT THAT WE SENT TO THE
CLERK TO FURTHER CLARIFY WHAT THE MAYBE MAKE IT MORE CLEAR.
WHAT WE ARE DOING IF THIS PASSES, WE ARE EXPRESSING ENTHUSIASTIC
SUPPORT FOR CAMBRIDGE AS A LOCATION FOR EVERSOURCE'S GEOTHERMAL
PILOT PROJECT. AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, TWO CHANGES I PROPOSE
TO MAKE, THAT AMENDMENT AND THEN TO ADD COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
AS A COSPONSOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE AMENDMENT S IS THERE A HAND UP? GO TO
COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS,
I'D SUGGEST ALL MEMBERS BECOME SPONSORS TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT WE ARE ALL BEHIND THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN DO THAT IN ONE VOTE, ALONG WITH THE
AMENDMENT THAT WAS ON THE SCREEN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR CARLONE. AND THANK
YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, FOR WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. COUNCILLOR
CARLONE, IS RIGHT, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STEP IF WE CAN GET
THERE. THIS HAS A POTENTIAL TO BE A GAME CHANGER IN THE QUEST TO
TRY TO BECOME FOSSIL FUEL FREE. I HOPE THE CITY CAN MOVE ON THIS.
WE'LL BE ABLE TO BECOME A PILOT SITE BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO THIS AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS
PROVEN, BUT WE NEED SITES TO BE CHOSEN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE MOTIONS?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTIONS: MOTION TO AMEND THE LAST RESOLVE
PARAGRAPH TO INSERT THE WORD CAMBRIDGE. REPLACE THE WORDS AT A
SITE WITH CAMBRIDGE. AND ON ADDING THE ENTIRE COUNCIL AS
SPONSORS. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

Motion to amend Policy Order
#11 to replace “the proposed
site location” with Cambridge
and add entire City Council as
co sponsors

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE ORDER AS AMENDED? (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR,
ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 13. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 13).

POLIY ORDER #11
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
City Council support for the
proposed site location for
Eversource’s Geothermal Pilot
Program project.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO PULL THIS TO
AMEND IT TO ADD COUNCILLOR CARLONE AS A COSPONSOR. WE WERE NOT
ABLE TO REACH HIM IN TIME EARLIER, BUT I'LL TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO
REMIND THE COUNCIL THAT WE DID ASK THE COURT THIS LAST TIME AROUND


PAGE 45

Jun 1, 2020

AND SADLY GOVERNOR BAKER VETOED IT. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT
ADVANCED IT SO FAR IN THIS SESSION.
WE DID HAVE A GREAT HEARING LAST WEEK AT THE STATE HOUSE. THERE
WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT ON IT. AND WE REALLY, REALLY NEED THIS TYPE OF
LEGISLATION. IT IS A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADD HOUSING STABILITY
AND TO ADD HOUSING AFFORDABILITY TO OUR CITY. I HOPE THAT WE CAN
PASS THIS AND ASSERT OUR SUPPORT ONCE AGAIN TO THE STATE
LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I'M EXCITED TO MOVE
THIS FORWARD TONIGHT AND SEE THIS FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE
LEGISLATURE AS COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN MENTIONED. THE LEGISLATURE
DID PASS IT LAST TIME, IT WAS VETOED. BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN PASS IT
THIS TIME IN A SUPER MAJORITY. IT WAS A LINE ITEM VETO LAST TIME. AND
TO THE IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE, TENANT RIGHT TO PURCHASE OR TENANT
OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE, IT WOULD ALLOW TENANTS TO DONATE THAT
RIGHT TO A NONPROFIT. AND BUY THAT HOME AND KEEP IT AFFORDABLE IF
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY THEIR HOMES THEMSELVES. ONE OF THE FIRST
CALLS I GOT, A COUPLE OF BUILDINGS IN CAMBRIDGE THAT ARE BEING SOLD.
BOUGHT BY AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND THE TENANTS WERE
SEEING GREATER THAN 100% RENT INCREASE IN THE SPAN OF A MONTH OR
TWO. AND THE CITY DID WORK ON THAT AND A LOT OF ASSISTANCE. IT
WOULD BE GREAT IF THOSE TENANTS OR A NONPROFIT CAN BUY IT AND KEEP
IT AFFORDABLE AND ADD HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE UNITS IN CAMBRIDGE.
THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD DO IF WE HAD TENANT OPPORTUNITY TO
PURCHASE AND THAT'S WHY THE LEGISLATION IS SO IMPORTANT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WILL VOTE NO AGAIN THIS
EVENING. THIS POLICY ORDER DOESN'T ALLOW ADDED PROTECTION, AS
FAR AS CAN I SEE, FOR A SMALL HOME OWNERS OR TWO OR THREE FAMILY
HOMES. IT COULD BE PUT IN A DIFFICULT FINANCIAL OR PRECARIOUS
SITUATION. GOD FORBID THEY HAVE TO SELL QUICKLY BECAUSE OF
FINANCIAL NEEDS. SOMEONE GOES INTO A NURSING HOME AND THERE'S A
FAMILY EMERGENCY, THEY HAVE TO SELL QUICKLY. IT PUTS SMALL HOME
OWNERS IN A DIFFICULT AND VULNERABLE SITUATION. AND I THINK THAT'S
VERY UNFAIR. THE BIG PROPERTY OWNERS, THEY KNOW HOW TO SKIRT THIS.
BUT TO PUT THE ONUS ON A SMALL PROPERTY OWNER, I FIND
UNACCEPTABLE. I WILL BE VOTING NO. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE BEFORE WE MOVE TO ADOPT?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. TO MY COLLEAGUE, I WANTED
TO POINT OUT THAT THE LEGISLATION DOES EXEMPT SMALLER PROPERTIES.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I AGREE. THAT'S ALL I WAS GOING TO SAY. I
DON'T KNOW WHY THE SCREEN CAME TO ME.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I RESPECT COUNCILLOR TOOMEY'S POSITION ON


PAGE 46

Jun 1, 2020

THIS. AND YET, THIS SPECIFIC BILL AT LEAST DOES EXEMPT SMALLER
LANDLORDS. ALL THE DETAILS WOULD BE WORKED OUT FOR THE LOCAL IT
GIVES THEM THE OPTION TO DEVELOP IT. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW
THIS WOULD AFFECT SMALL LANDLORDS, SINCE THIS BILL I THINK WE ALL
KNOW THAT THIS ALONE WON'T SOLVE IT. IT NEEDS THE DC TOPA, IT HAS A
SUBSIDY, AS WE PASS THIS, IF IT COMES BACK, WE RECOGNIZE THIS IS ONE OF
THE ENABLING FACTORS. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ADDRESSING SOME OF
THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE CONDO CONVERSIONS
AND OTHERS IN THE CITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. SINCE I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO
BRING UP THIS SUBJECT ON THE COUNCIL, I DON'T KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO,
YES THERE ARE OTHER RELATED ISSUES, BUT IN WASHINGTON, THEY HAVE
CREATED 10,000 UNITS OVER THE YEARS DURING THIS PROCESS. AND
INVESTING $87,000 IN A UNIT THAT IS PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE, IN MY
MIND, IS A BARGAIN COMPARED TO BUILDING A NEW. IT IS ANOTHER WAY
TO HAVE HOUSING THAT IS INTEGRATED INTO A COMMUNITY AND NOT IN A
SEPARATE PROJECT ALL BY ITSELF. IT IS JUST ANOTHER WAY TO GET MORE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND PERHAPS SOME MORE GENTLE WAY, GIVEN A
COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. HEARING NO ONE ELSE, ROLL CALL ON
THE POLICY ORDER? AND WE'RE GOING TO WE'LL ADD COUNCILLOR
CARLONE.

Motion to add Councillor
Carlone as a co-sponsor to
Policy Order #13

>> MR. CLERK: ON ADDING COUNCILLOR CARLONE AS A COSPONSOR. (ROLL
CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AS AMENDED?
>> MR. CLERK: AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL). EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE DONE WITH THE POLICY ORDERS. WE DO NOT
HAVE ANY ROUNDTABLE MINUTES. WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMITTEE
REPORTS. WE MOVE TO COMMUNICATIONS AND REPORTS FROM OTHER CITY
OFFICERS. THERE'S ONE FROM ME SHARING INFORMATION FROM THE
SCHOOL COMMITTEE AND NEW INFORMATION IS AROUND THAT EARLY
COLLEGE PILOT THAT MY OFFICE AND THE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN WORKING
ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME AROUND EARLY COLLEGE PILOT IN PARTNERSHIP
WITH A UNIVERSITY. THAT'S EXCITING. WE HAD A GREAT FAIR OVER THE
LAST WEEKEND AS WELL AT THE PEABODY SCHOOL. THAT'S THE UPDATE
FROM THE SCHOOL. MORE UPDATES TOMORROW THAT I WILL PUT IN
THURSDAY'S MEETING AS WELL. DON'T HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING
THAT MATTER ON FILE?
>> MR. CLERK: ON PLACING THE COMMUNICATION ON FILE: (ROLL CALL).
NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO ANY LATE RESOLUTIONS, CLERK WILSON?
>> MR. CLERK: I DON'T HAVE LATE RESOLUTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY LATE POLICY ORDERS?

Motion to suspend the rules for
two late Policy Orders

>> MR. CLERK: I HAVE TWO LATE POLICY ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES. IT REQUIRES A ROLL
CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: SUSPENSION OF THE RULES TO RECEIVE THE LATE POLICY
ORDERS? (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN WE HAVE THE LATE POLICY ORDERS BEFORE US?
>> MR. CLERK: ONE MOMENT WHILE I PULL THEM UP TO SHARE ON THE
SCREEN. FIRST ONE... I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT LARGER. FROM VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN
RECEIVING WE RECEIVE IN THE EMAIL EVERY DAY CRASHES THAT INVOLVE
PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS AND IT STRUCK ME ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
LAST WEEK, THERE WAS A PEDESTRIAN THAT WAS STRUCK IN THE
INTERSECTION AND A CYCLIST THAT WAS STRUCK IN THE INTERSECTION.
TWO DAYS APART. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE
INTERSECTION FOR ANY VISIBILITY ISSUES OR ANY SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO
MAKE. I THINK BECAUSE IT IS SO CLOSE TO CRLS AND THE STUDENTS THAT
CROSS THAT INTERSECTION EVERY DAY, I THINK IT IS REALLY AN URGENT
ISSUE TO LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION AND SEE WHAT SAFETY
IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE.
LIKE I SAID, ONE OF THEM WAS A CYCLIST, THE OTHER ONE IS A WOMAN
PUSHING A STROLLER. THE QUICKER, THE BETTER. AND I HOPE THAT MY
COLLEAGUES CAN SUPPORT ME IN THIS EFFORT AND TRYING TO GET THE
ATTENTION OF THE CITY MANAGER AND THE TRAFFIC AND PARKING
DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS ORDER.
AND AS I SAID EARLIER, I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS REPORT. IT DOES
SEEM LIKE WE ARE SEEING AN UPTICK IN THE CRASHES ACROSS THE CITY. WE
HAD ANOTHER ONE EARLIER TODAY. I HOPE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS
INTERSECTION AND CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR TRAFFIC
SAFETY, INCLUDING THE BIKE LANES. THEY ARE IN THE PLAN AND INCLUDING
ANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE TO PROTECT OUR MOST
VULNERABLE ROAD USERS, PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS, IN PARTICULAR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NO OTHER HANDS, ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING
THE POLICY ORDER?

Adoption of Late Policy order
submitted by Vice Mayor
Mallon

>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
SECOND LATE POLICY ORDER IS FROM COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. THE
ORDERED PARAGRAPH... WORK WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE

PAGE 48

Jun 1, 2020

AN EXPLANATION OF THE INCIDENT, INCLUDING LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
ARREST WERE PROPERLY FOLLOWED. IT IS IN THE WHEREAS PARAGRAPH
THAT OCCURRED ON OCTOBER 17, 2021.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THIS POLICY ORDER IS FROM
MYSELF AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. MY OFFICE RECEIVED A
VIDEO FROM A WITNESS TO THIS INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON IN CENTRAL SQUARE. WHERE SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS CAN BE
SEEN BEATING UP A MAN IN CENTRAL SQUARE. IT'S A VERY DISTURBING
VIDEO. IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH TO WATCH IT. AS WE WERE
TOLD BY THE WITNESS WHO TOOK THE VIDEO, THE MAN WAS SITTING AT THE
BUS STOP NEAR THE YMCA, ACROSS FROM CITY HALL. AND THE POLICE
STARTED TALKING TO HIM, GOT OUT OF THE CRUISER, CONFRONTED HIM,
AND THEN THIS OTHER MAN, WHO IS NOT IN UNIFORM, ALSO PULLED UP IN
HIS PRIVATE CAR AND JOINED THE POLICE AND PULLED OUT A BATON FROM
THE CAR THAT HE USED TO THREATEN THE MAN. AND HE APPEARS ON THE
VIDEO TO BE ABOUT TO HIT THIS MAN WHEN THE VIDEOGRAPHER YELLED
OUT TO THE MAN TO COMPLY. THAT ALERTS THE MAN WITH THE BATON
THAT HE IS BEING VIDEOTAPE. HE TURNS AND LOOKS AND MOVES AWAY
FROM THE MAN.
WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTION ABOUT WHO THIS MAN IS AND WHY HE WAS
ALLOWED TO JOIN THE POLICE IN THIS PARTICULAR ACTION. THE VICTIM WAS
APPARENTLY PEPPER SPRAYED AND WAS YELLED AT THAT HE HAD STOLEN
SOME CANDLES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND LATER REMOVED IN AN
AMBULANCE. IT IS A VERY DISTURBING INCIDENT. IT HAS NO PLACE IN OUR
CITY AND I'M EXPECTING A FULL ACCOUNTING OF WHAT HAPPENED. I DID
PASS IT ON TO THE COMMISSIONER AS WELL. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING
SOME ANSWERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WILL SUPPORT THIS, BUT I DO
WANT TO SAY THAT I REACHED OUT TO THE COMMISSIONER TO FIND OUT
MORE INFORMATION. THE MAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT IS NOT AFFILIATED
WITH THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO
PARTICIPATE. THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET HIM TO STOP. HE WAS
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM. A PASSERBY. NOT A POLICE OFFICER.
AND THERE IS THE COMMISSIONER INFORMED ME, AS IN ALL INCIDENTS
WHERE FORCE IS USED, THERE IS AN ONGOING THERE WILL BE AN
ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THIS AND A REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED.
IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT I SAW IT TODAY. IT CERTAINLY WAS ANYTHING LIKE
THAT IS DISTURBING. AND NEEDS AN ACCOUNTING AND WE NEED TO GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS TO WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW IF THE POLICY
MAKER SPOKE WITH THE COMMISSIONER TO GET INFORMATION. I THINK IT
IS IMPORTANT BEFORE PUTTING AN ORDER THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE
INFORMATION YOU CAN JUST TO NOT MAKE SURE WHAT WE PUT
FORWARD IS CORRECT. CERTAINLY, AN INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED AND
IS REQUIRED. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I THINK THEY ARE ISSUING A


PAGE 49

Jun 1, 2020

STATEMENT TOMORROW, IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I TOO STAND WITH MY COLLEAGUE,
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. I WILL SUPPORT THE ORDER BECAUSE WE ALSO
WANT WE ALWAYS WANT TO FIND OUT IF THERE ARE ANY BEHAVIORS THAT
WOULD BE CALLED INTO QUESTION OUR CREDIBILITY AS A CITY OR OUR
CREDIBILITY AS A POLICE FORCE THAT HAS DOES EXTRAORDINARY WORK
AROUND DE ESCALATION. I WANTED TO SEEK AND GET INFORMATION AND
WAS NOT THERE AND HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. I WISH MY
COLLEAGUE WOULD HAVE SHARED IT WITH US SO WE CAN MAKE A MORE
INFORMED DECISION. NOT TO SAY THAT OUR COLLEAGUE WOULD
DELIBERATELY MISREPRESENT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE WANT TO BE
INFORMED AND WELL AWARE, IF THERE IS MISCONDUCT, WE WANT TO BE
ON TOP OF THAT. IF THERE IS MISINFORMATION, WHATEVER WE DO, WE DO
IT BASED ON FACTS. I UNDERSTAND FROM HAVING TALK TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND TO COMMISSIONER ELOW, THERE IS A STANDARD
PROCEDURE TO MAKE SURE THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION. IT IS IMPORTANT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT WE'LL HAVE AN INVESTIGATION. THIS
MAY WE DO WANT THE CONSTITUENCY, THE RESIDENTS, AND CITIZENS, TO
UNDERSTAND WE TAKE BEHAVIORS OF ALL CITY REPRESENTATIVES,
INCLUDING OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT, VERY SERIOUSLY IF THERE IS ANY SORT
OF INFRACTION THAT MAY HAPPEN. WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE WE HAVE
ALL THE EVIDENCE AND THE COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE. THE LAST THING IS WE
WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS THAT MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. HAVING SAID
THAT, I WILL SUPPORT THIS ORDER, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH
THE WAY IT IS WORDED. IT PRESUMES INFORMATION THAT MY COLLEAGUES
AND I I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF. I HAVE NOT SEEN. AND I CERTAINLY
KNOW MY COLLEAGUE WOULDN'T MISREPRESENT THE NOT DELIBERATELY.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE THE EVIDENCE AND THAT WE MAKE THAT
EVIDENCE AWARE TO OUR CITIZENS SO THEY CAN BE AWARE.
I WILL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR
COMMISSIONER AND FROM OUR CITY MANAGER ABOUT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ARE NOW
VOTING FOR THIS POLICY ORDER. IT IS NEITHER AN INDICTMENT ON EITHER
PARTY UNTIL SUCH TIME WE HAVE GOTTEN A TRUE AND FULL REPORTING
AND SEEN THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL LEAD US TO A MORE CLEAR
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR RAISING
THOSE POINTS. I WANT TO CLARIFY, THERE WAS OUTREACH OUT TO
COMMISSIONER ELOW BEFORE SUBMITTING THIS. AND WITH A LOT OF THE
POLICY ORDER, THERE ARE PIECES THAT STAFF IS WORKING ON, THEY CAN
HAPPEN WITHOUT THE POLICY ORDER THEMSELVES. WHEN CONSTITUENTS
BRING THINGS TO US AND WE WANT TO ELEVATE AND GET A RESPONSE AND
MAKE SURE THAT RESPONSE IS PUBLIC AND GETS BACK TO FOLK. A POLICY
ORDER IS A WAY TO DO THAT. THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. I'M GRATEFUL FOR

PAGE 50

Jun 1, 2020

THE SUPPORT AND FOR THESE POINTS BEING RAISED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: CAN WE SEE THE REST OF THE POLICY ORDER. I
DON'T SEE IT IN MY INBOX.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN YOU SCROLL DOWN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER HANDS BEFORE WE GO BACK TO
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES
FOR THOSE COMMENTS. I DID SPEAK WITH THE PERSON WHO TOOK THE
VIDEO. I DID REACH OUT TO THE COMMISSIONER TWICE TODAY. AND I DID
SHARE THE VIDEO WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND THE CITY MANAGER. IT IS
ALSO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON TWITTER. AND THE WITNESS DID RELAY TO US
THAT THE POLICE INITIALLY TRIED TO STOP THE MAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES, BUT
LATER ALLOWED HIM TO PARTICIPATE. AFTER THE INCIDENT WAS OVER,
SHOOK HIS HAND, THANKED HIM, AND ALLOWED TO LEAVE WITHOUT ANY
ACTION BEING TAKEN. I WASN'T THERE AND THAT WASN'T ON THE VIDEO.
I'M JUST RELAYING WHAT THIS WITNESS TOLD US. AGAIN, I LOOK FORWARD
TO A FULL ACCOUNTING FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON WHAT
HAPPENED, IN PARTICULAR WITH THIS PLAIN CLOTHE ED INDIVIDUAL. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO OTHER HANDS. WE CAN DO I LOOK
FORWARD TO GETTING THIS INFORMATION AS WELL. I THINK WE CAN GO
AHEAD AND DO A ROLL CALL ON THE ADOPTION OF THE LATE ORDER?
