>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, TONIGHT'S VOTES ARE BY ROLL
CALL. WE'LL OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. I ASK YOU STATE YOUR NAME
AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND THE ITEM YOU SPEAK ON. FIRST
PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS LYNN, FOLLOWED BY ALLEN.
>> LYNN HAS NOT JOINED. ALLEN, GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME? THANK YOU. 17 PLEASANT
PLACE. I'M COMMENTING AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND NOT ON BEHALF OF
ANY ORGANIZATION. I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 2, THE GREEN NEW DEAL ZONING PETITION. I THINK TAXING
CARBON EMISSIONS FROM COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND
SPENDING THAT MONEY TO FUND JUSTICE AND EQUITABLE
TRANSITION IS A GOOD IDEA. I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A
FRAMEWORK. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE TAXING COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT IS AN IDEA THE COUNCIL EXPRESSED AN INTEREST. I
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAKE AWAY A REVENUE SOURCE FOR
AFFORDABLE HOUSE. AS THE IDEA IS FLUSHED OUT, AFFORDABLE
HOUSING IS ADDED TO THE LIST OF THE CLIMATE MITIGATION.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A JUSTICE ORIENTED WAYS FOR THE CITY TO
SPEND MONEY, IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS THE


PAGE 1

Jun 1, 2020

CITY CAN DO TO DECREASE CARBON EMISSIONS. MOST OF THE
EMISSIONS IN CAMBRIDGE ARE BUILDINGS, BUT MOST CAUSE IS BY
TRANSPORTATION. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A GOOD WAY TO SPEND
THAT MONEY ON AND I'M GLAD THE FRAMEWORK EXEMPTS I THINK
IT IS A REALLY GOOD FRAMEWORK AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THE
POLICY ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, CAROL LYONS.
>> GOING TO LEE. PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> PARTICIPANT: CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> PARTICIPANT: LEE FARRIS. I SPEAK FOR THE CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENT'S ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT OF THE CAMBRIDGE GREEN NEW
DEAL. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS PETITION. IT IS URGENT TO FIGHT
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE WAY THAT THIS PETITION COMBINES THAT
FIGHT WITH THE FIGHTS FOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS
EXCITING TO ME. I THINK ALSO IT WILL BE REALLY EFFECTIVE. IT IS
ELEGANTLY DESIGNED THE WAY IT CREATES THE BEGINNING OF THE
LIFE OF A NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND THEN DIRECTS THE FUNDS
COMING FROM THE FEE TO EITHER SUPPORT GREEN JOBS DEVELOP
PROGRAMS OR ACTUAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT
MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN CAMBRIDGE. THAT'S VERY EXCITING. IT IS
VERY NICELY DONE. I THINK IT WOULD LEAD TO A LOT OF SOLAR
INSTALLATIONS ON ROOFTOPS. AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO EXISTING
BUILDINGS. IT WOULD LEAD TO BENEFITS FOR JOBS AND ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CAMBRIDGE.
LIKE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER, I'M ALSO VERY GLAD THAT IT EXEMPTS
RESIDENTIAL. I THINK THE COUNCIL SHOULD HOLD A HEARING AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE ON THIS. AND MOVE IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
FORWARD SO THAT THIS BECOMES OUR POLICY AND OUR PROCEDURE
IN CAMBRIDGE THIS YEAR. AND NO LATER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE NICOLE WILLIAMS AND THEN
HEATHER HOFFMAN. ACTUALLY. I APOLOGIZE. MELISSA JOIN THE
FEED. WE'LL GO TO MELISSA AND THEN NICOLE WILLIAMS.
>> MELISSA, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> PARTICIPANT: CAN YOU HEAR ME? HI. THANK YOU, MAYOR
SIDDIQUI. THIS IS MELISSA. AND I AM JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY SPEAK
ON POLICY ORDER TWO, THE GREEN NEW DEAL. AND YOU OFTEN HEAR
ME SPEAK ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES. I'M HERE TONIGHT WITH THAT
SAME PERSPECTIVE IN MIND. I GUESS I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY, WE ARE
REALLY AT A TURNING POINT. WE'RE AT A TURNING POINT IN THE
CITY, A TURNING POINT IN OUR GLOBAL CLIMATE ISSUES TODAY. I
JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS CITY COUNCIL AND I HAVE BEEN
ENCOURAGED BY THE CITY COUNCIL IN TERMS OF THE REAL COURAGE
THAT YOU ARE SHOWING TO REALLY MOVE ON THE ISSUES THAT
REALLY INDICATE WE'RE AT A CRISIS POINT. OBVIOUSLY, BUILDING
EMISSIONS, AS THE MAKERS OF THIS POLICY ORDER HAVE INDICATED,
CREATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE PART
OF WHAT OUR CITY IS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROBLEM.


PAGE 2

Jun 1, 2020

I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU ON THIS SCORE AS WELL AS ON
OTHERS TO MOVE BOLDLY, TO MOVE COURAGEOUSLY AND MOVE IN
KEEPING WITH THE TIMES. I TRULY THINK THIS CITY COUNCIL CAN BE
ONE THAT WILL GO DOWN IN REALLY THE ANNALS OF THE HISTORY OF
THE CITY IN TERMS OF THE ONE CITY COUNCIL THAT REALLY ROSE TO
THE MOMENT AS IT ROSE TO THE MOMENT OF THE COVID CRISIS AND
CONTINUES TO RISE IN THAT CASE.
WE REALLY CAN SHOW THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO WHAT IS
NECESSARY AT A MOMENT THAT CALLS ON US TO DO IT. WE DON'T
HAVE MOMENTS LIKE THIS OFTEN AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M
REALLY CONVINCED THE CITY COUNCIL IS POISED TO BE ABLE TO ACT
AND I URGE YOU TO ACT ON THE POLICY ORDER. IT HAS COMPONENTS
TO IT, MANY OF IT WHICH I LIKE. LOOKING AT THE RETRAINING OF
WORKERS AND IN TERMS OF BUILDING BETTER BUILDINGS FROM THE
GET GO SO WE DON'T ADD TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE. OKAY. THANKS
SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND APPRECIATE IT. THANKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO NICOLE WILLIAMS AND THEN HEATHER
HOFFMAN.
>> PARTICIPANT: GOOD EVENING. HOW ARE YOU? I DO WANT THE
NICOLE WILLIAMS, BREWER STREET. I SUPPORT THE NEW GREEN DEAL
PETITIONS GENERALLY. I THINK IT HAS SOME REALLY GOOD IDEA S.
PARTICULARLY, I REALLY THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A GREEN
TYPE OF CONTRACT WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT AND THIS FITS IN THAT
CATEGORY. I LOVE THE FACT THAT WE'RE LOOKING IT IS LOOKING
AT GREEN JOBS, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE HAVE SOME
INDUSTRIES HERE IN CAMBRIDGE AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO
DEVELOP A NEW INDUSTRY. THE HIGH TECH OR BIOTECH AND IT WILL
GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE
OF COLOR. JUST EXPANDS MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS FOR THEM.
AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT CERTAINLY ON A NATIONAL LEVEL THAT
THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME MOVEMENT. WHY NOT HAVE OUR
RESIDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THIS SPACE?
IN RELATION TO THE PART ABOUT PAYMENT INTO THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND GREEN HOUSE GAS REDUCTION
REVOLVING FUND FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS IN PUBLIC PROJECTS,
INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, I'D LIKE THAT TO
BE BROADER TO INCLUDE HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS
AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAMS. WE THINK ABOUT
HOUSING, WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE
AND INCLUDES I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PART OF IT.
OTHER THAN THAT, I THINK IT IS A GREAT START. IT IS QUITE A LOT TO
DECIPHER. I'M STILL DIGESTING IT MYSELF. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT
STOOD OUT FOR ME THAT I FEEL WOULD BE I WOULD SUPPORT WITH
SOME TWEAKING. I'M SURE THERE SHOULD BE FURTHER VETTING OF
IT. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, SO I COMMEND
THE SPONSORS OF THIS FOR ALL THIS WORK IN PUTTING THIS
TOGETHER AND GENERALLY I SUPPORT IT. AND I WOULD WELCOME
INPUT FROM THE OTHER COUNCILLORS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, HEATHER HOFFMAN?
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. FIRST, I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THE HOUSING CHOICE POLICY ORDER. I'M GOING TO BE VERY
INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT THE PEOPLE WRITING THE REGULATION


PAGE 3

Jun 1, 2020

THINK THIS MEANS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS NOT ALL THAT WELL
WRITTEN. IT LEAVES A WHOLE LOT TO THE IMAGINATION AND IT WILL
NEED REGULATION. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ESPECIALLY NAIL THEM
DOWN ON WHAT THEY MEAN BY ELIGIBLE LOCATION, SINCE THAT
SEEMS TO BE REALLY A CRUX OF THE WHOLE IDEA OF WHERE YOU
CAN PASS ZONING WITH ONLY FIVE VOTES.
AND THEN... I HOPE YOU WILL FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN
THERE THAT REQUIRES IT TO GET DENSER OR WHETHER WE CAN JUST
DOWN ZONE PLACES AS LONG AS WE PERMIT MULTIFAMILY HOUSING
THERE BY RIGHT OR BY SPECIAL PERMIT. AND SECOND THING I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IS A RESOLUTION. AND THAT IS THE ONE ON TELLING
ARKANSAS HOW THEY SHOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES.
THE RIGHTS ARE VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART. I DO NOT WANT US TO DO
SOMETHING THAT MAKES LIVES OF TRANS PEOPLE SOMEWHERE ELSE
MORE DIFFICULT. ONE THING THAT I DO BECAUSE LAWYERS ARE
SUPPOSED TO DO PRO BONO THINGS IS DO THE LEGAL WORK FOR
CHANGING TRANS PEOPLE'S NAMES. AND SO, WHEN I SAW THIS, I
THOUGHT IF I WERE SITTING IN GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON'S OFFICE AND
I GOT THIS RESOLUTION, I WOULD THINK IT WAS A BUNCH OF LIBERAL
PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR LIVES THAN WE
DO, SITTING ON THEIR HIGH HORSES, TELLING US WHAT TO DO.
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MENTION OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THERE.
NOT A SINGLE MENTION OF CARING ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS AND
NEIGHBORS, YOUR CHILDREN, NONE OF THAT. IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE US
TELLING THEM THAT THEY ARE A BUNCH OF IGNORANT HILL BILLIES
AND THEY SHOULD KNOW BETTER AND WE'RE SMARTER. IT IS NOT A
GOOD WAY TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO COME
AROUND TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING. AND I THINK THIS COUNCIL
SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME THIS TERM ON THE HIGH HORSE AND WAY
TOO LITTLE TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO CONVINCE PEOPLE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK THAT'S ALL THAT SIGNED UP. WE'LL
LEAVE NAOMI, CAN YOU CHECK IF THERE IS ANYBODY ELSE IN THE
ZOOM.
>> THERE ARE NO OTHERS THAT ARE SIGNED UP AT THIS TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR THE NEXT
SHORT TIME AND SEE IF ANYONE ELSE JOINS US. WE ARE MOVING TO
RECONSIDERATIONS. THERE ARE NONE. NEXT UP, WE HAVE THE CITY
MANAGER'S AGENDA. PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL. ANY ITEMS
THAT MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO PULL. WE'LL PULL 1.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: NUMBER 5 AND 6.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: 4 AND 7.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE? WE HAVE PULLED 1, 4, 5, 6, AND 7.
WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEMS 2, 3, AND
8.
>> MR. CLERK: THE MOTION IS TO PLACE 2 AND 3 ON FILE AND REFER
NUMBER 8 TO THE PLANNING PASSWORD AND THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE FOR A HEARING AND REPORT. ON THAT MOTION: (ROLL
CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

Jun 1, 2020

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 1.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 1). ROLL CALL TO SUSPEND
THE RULES TO BRING FORWARD COMMUNICATIONS AND REPORTS
FROM OTHER CITY OFFICERS NUMBER 2. TRANSMITTING QUESTIONS
FOR THE COVID 19 UPDATE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER?
>> CITY MANAGER: GOOD EVENING. MY COMMENTS TONIGHT ALONG
WITH CLAUDE'S PRESENTATION WILL ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL'S
SUBMITTED QUESTIONS EARLIER IN THE WEEK. SINCE MY LAST
REPORT ON MARCH 29, CAMBRIDGE HAS SEEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN
THE SEVEN DAY MOVING AVERAGE FOR CONFIRMED CASES PER
HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. WE ARE REPORTING A 16.8 CASES
COMPARED TO 16.0 CASES LAST WEEK. ALSO, SINCE MY LAST REPORT,
THE POSITIVE RATE INCREASED TO ONE HALF OF 1% AS REPORTED ON
APRIL 1 IN THE COMMONWEALTH'S REPORT. AS OF TODAY, APRIL 5,
THE SEVEN DAY PERCENTAGE OF POSITIVITY FOR THE
COMMONWEALTH IS CURRENTLY AT 2.36. AS VACCINATIONS
CONTINUE TO BE ADMINISTERED IN THE COMMONWEALTH, YOU HAVE
TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND ADHERE TO SAFETY MEASURES.
ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S LATEST WEEKLY COVID 19 MUNICIPAL
VACCINATION REPORT AS OF MARCH 30, 28% OF CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE, UP 16.7 FROM THE
PREVIOUS WEEK. CLAUDE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS AND I WANT TO
HIGHLIGHT THAT, PORTION OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVED
AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE AND IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS
BLACK OR HISPANIC IS HIGHER THAN COMPARED WITH THE
COMMONWEALTH.

CITY MANAGER AGENDA #3
A communication transmitted from
Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appointment of the following person
as a member of the Community
Preservation Act Committee for a
term of five years, effective April 5,
2021: Owen O'Riordan and Mary
Flynn.

CITY MANAGER AGENDA #8
A communication transmitted from
Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to a Planning
Board recommendation to adopt
both the Retail Uses Zoning Petition
and the Home Occupations Zoning
Petition, with comments for further
consideration.

IN CAMBRIDGE, AS REPORTED ON APRIL 1, 29% OF BLACK RESIDENTS
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE COMPARED TO 22% STATEWIDE. IN 17%
HISPANIC LATINX RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE AS COMPARED TO
15%. I'M PLEASED THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW. AND I'M PROUD
OF THE CITY'S OUTREACH EFFORTS IN THE MATTER TO DATE. I WANT
TO THANK THE MAYOR AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR THE
LEADERSHIP IN THE AREAS.
TODAY'S RESIDENTS, 55 PLUS AND RESIDENTS WITH ONE CERTAIN
MEDICAL CONDITION BECOME ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE
AND ON APRIL 19TH, THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AGES 16 OR OLDER, WILL
BEGIN ON APRIL 19TH. THE COVID 19 VACCINE IS FREE AND ONE OF THE
BEST WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND THOSE AROUND YOU FROM
GETTING THE COVID SICKNESS AND WE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO
GET VACCINATED. TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS, THERE ARE MANY WAYS
AND WE RECOMMEND ALL THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES.
YOU CAN PRE REGISTER FOR THE STATE'S MASS VACCINE SITE ONLINE.
WE SUGGEST EVERYBODY PRE REGISTER. YOU WILL BE CONTACTED
BY A METHOD OF CHOICE VIA TEXT, EMAIL, OR PHONE WHEN THE
APPOINTMENT IS AVAILABLE AND YOU WILL HAVE 24 HOURS TO
RESPOND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. PRE REGISTER, YOU CAN CHECK
OFF YOU WORKING ACADEMY TO INDICATE ELIGIBILITY. IN ADDITION
TO PRE REGISTERING, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO FIND
AN APPOINTMENT. SOME OF THE METHODS INCLUDE, SEARCHING
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND OTHER COMMUNITY LOCATIONS.

PHARMACY SIGN UP AT CVS.COM OR WALGREENS.COM. OR GROCERY
STORE SIGN UP AND STORE PHARMACY. YOU CAN CALL 211, THE MASS
VACCINE SCHEDULING RESOURCE LINE. HOURS ARE MONDAY
THURSDAY. LIVE CALL CENTER WORKERS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN
ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND LANGUAGES THROUGH TRANSLATORS. I
WILL ADDRESS QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO
CLAUDE.
THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED A POLICY ORDER ASKING THE CITY TO
WAIVE ALL OPERATING FEES FOR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING LICENSE
ANNUAL FEES. SINCE OTHER CITIES HAVE WAIVED FEES AND THE
COUNCIL ASKED THE CITY TO MATCH OR DO MORE. ALL THE BUSINESS
ASSOCIATIONS IN THE CITY SUPPORTED THAT ORDER AND CONFIRMED
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. BUSINESSES HAVE SOME FINANCIAL HELP, BUT
THOSE DO NOT COME CLOSE TO FILLING THE GAP. SMALL BUSINESSES
ACROSS THE CITY ARE STILL STRUGGLING. TO DATE, THE CITY HAS
WAIVED 40% OF THE FEW LICENSE FEES, LIQUOR LICENSE AND OTHER
FEES. THE CITY IT IS SCHEDULED TO GET 87 MILLION IN SEPTEMBER
OF 2020, WE REDUCED ALL LICENSES FEES BY 40% FOR CALENDAR 21.
AND WE SET UP PAYMENTS STRUCTURES SO BUSINESSES CAN DELAY
UP TO 85% OF WHAT THEY WOULD DO UNTIL LATER IN THE SPRING.
TO CLARIFY, THE CITY HAS RECEIVED ABOUT AN $800,000 REVENUE
LOSS. BY LESSENING THE IMPACT ON BUSINESSES. RECENTLY, THE
CITY WAIVED THE PUBLIC PERMIT FEE FOR SIDEWALK BUSINESSES
USED PERMITS. OUR FY21, 40% ACROSS THE BOARD LICENSE FEE
REDUCTION IS ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE REDUCTIONS IN THE
REGION. AND MOST LIKELY THE LARGEST REDUCTION IN TOTAL
DOLLARS. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT NO OTHER CITY AND TOWN
AT THIS POINT IS YET ADDRESSED REDUCING FEES FOR FY22. HI
MEETINGS WITH CITY DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING LICENSE,
INSPECTIONAL, AND PUBLIC WORKS, WHEN INVOLVING AND
REVIEWING ALL PERMIT FEES AND STRUCTURES WITH THE POSSIBLE
OF ADDITIONAL CHANGES COMING IN FY22. AT THIS POINT, NO
FINANCIAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE
DOING FOR FY22, BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION.
IN TERMS OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, AS I STATED LAST WEEK,
WE HAVE FOUND THAT USEFUL SOMEWHAT TO THE CARES AND FEMA
FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED. TO WAIT FOR GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE
THE CITY'S APPROACH FOR A PLAN TO BE PERMITTED. IT NOT CLEAR IF
A CATEGORY FOR LOSS REVENUE WILL APPLY FOR MUNICIPALITY
THAT PROACTIVELY CHOSE TO REDUCE THE REVENUE ON ITS OWN. OR
APPLIES TO FEES NOT COLLECTED DUE TO BUSINESS CLOSURE OR
NONPAYMENT.
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER ASKED, IF WAS GREAT TO SEE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT OF RIVERBEND PARK. THANK YOU TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH DCR TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
BESIDES OUTDOOR DINING, WHAT ARE THE PLANS TO GIVE MORE
SPACE ON CITY OWNED STREETS FOR THE DURATION OF THE
PANDEMIC, BEING SHARED STREETS OR OTHERS. LAST WEEK, I WAS
PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION WITH THE CITY
DCR AGREED TO OPEN RIVERBEND PARK AND CONTINUING THROUGH
NOVEMBER 2021. WEATHER PERMITTING. THIS 16 RIVERBEND PARK
WILL BE OPEN ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAY HEAR 11 7. I WILL THANK
YOU FOR THE PARTNERSHIP FOR WORKING WITH US. AS THE SPRING


PAGE 6

Jun 1, 2020

WEATHER ARRIVE, I'M EXCITED TO SEE RESTAURANTS OPEN THEIR
OUTDOOR DINING HOURS. WE WILL EXPLORE STREET CHANGES THAT
SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH BUSINESS
ASSOCIATIONS ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS.
IN CENTRAL SQUARE, WE ARE CONTINUING STARLIGHT SQUARE IN
MUNICIPAL LOT FIVE THROUGH THE FALL. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN
CLOSING NORFOLK STREET ON MONDAYS IN SUPPORT OF CENTRAL
SQUARE FARMER'S MARKET, WHICH WILL OPEN ON MAY 17TH. WE
HAVE ALSO REINSTATED DINING AREAS ON MASS AVENUE. AND THIS
SEASON WE'LL EXPAND THIS BEYOND BROOKLINE PARKWAY TO
SIDNEY STREET. AND HARVARD SQUARE, WE WORK WITH THE
HARVARD SQUARE BUSINESS ASSOCIATION ON A PILOT FOR CLOSURE
OF BRATTLE, BETWEEN BRATTLE AND ELLIOT AND CHURCH TO
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR ADJACENT RESTAURANTS AND
STORES.
THE CITY HAS STARTED A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT PALMER STREET
IMPROVEMENTS AND A VIRTUAL MEETING HAPPENED LAST MONTH.
INMAN SQUARE WE'LL CONTINUE THE OPERATION THROUGH THE
SUMMER. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT HAVE PLANS TO REINSTATE THE
SHARED STREET PROGRAMS BASED ON THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED
LAST YEAR. AS WE MENTIONED IN THE UPDATES TO THE COMMUNITY
LAST DECEMBER, THERE ARE MANY ISSUES RELATED TO THE
OPERATION AND USE OF BEHAVIOR THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC. IT WAS
CHALLENGING FOR THE CITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMUNITY ISSUES SO
WE HAVEN'T PRIORITIZE FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARED
STREETS. HOWEVER, WE'LL REMAIN OPEN TO OTHER SUGGESTIONS OF
ADDITIONAL STREET CHANGES TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND
LOCAL BUSINESSES. THIS CONCLUDES MY RESPONSES TO THE
COUNCIL QUESTIONS. AS A REMINDER, THE CITY CONTINUES TO OFFER
SEVEN DAY WEEK FREE COVID TESTING TO ALL RESIDENTS. WE HAVE
NUMEROUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO HELP OUR
RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND OUR EVICTION
MORATORIUM REMAINS IN PLACE. I ENCOURAGE ALL TO RECEIVE A
VACCINE WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND WE ARE HERE TO
CONDUCT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO THE COMMUNITIES TO
ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY. THE VACCINE IS FREE OF CHARGE TO
ALL. AS WE HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC, WE CONTINUE
TO MONITOR DATA WORKING WITH THE COMMONWEALTH, OUR
EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL, CITY DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESS
ASSOCIATIONS, COMMUNITY PARTNERS, TO ENSURE THAT WE SUPPORT
AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY.
AS EACH PREVIOUS DECISION IS MADE, I WILL WORK WITH MY TEAM
AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND THE STATE AND OUR
REGIONAL PARTNERS. AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, THE SAFETY OF
THE RESIDENT WILL ALWAYS AND REMAIN OUR NUMBER ONE
PRIORITY. ONCE AGAIN, I ASK OUR RESIDENTS TO REMAIN VIGILANT
AND DON'T LET THEIR GUARD DOWN. WEAR MASKS, WASH HANDS
FREQUENTLY, PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND LIMIT
GATHERINGS WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE. AND THANK YOU
AND I TURN IT OVER TO CLAUDE.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME? APOLOGIES, MY
SIGNAL IS UNSTABLE AND SORRY FOR BEING OFF CAMERA. I WOULD
LIKE TO THANK THE CITY MANAGER, DR. ASSAAD SAYAH, AS WELL AS
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE


PAGE 7

Jun 1, 2020

TONIGHT'S UPDATE. I'M JOINED BY DR. DOBBERTEEN, OUR MEDICAL
DIRECTOR AND WE'LL FIELD QUESTIONS AT THE END. BEFORE I GO
THROUGH TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
TODAY MARKS THE START OF NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK,
WHICH RUNS NATIONWIDE APRIL 5 THROUGH THE 11TH THIS YEAR.
THIS NATIONAL AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IS CELEBRATED EACH YEAR
DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL AND SPEARHEADED BY THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION. YOU MAY KNOW OR
RECALL, WE ORDINARILY WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE PUBLIC HEALTH
ACTIVITIES AT CITY HALL WITH A POSTER DISPLAY, WE'D HOST OUR
GRADUATE STUDENTS SYMPOSIUM CALLED "REAL WORLD PUBLIC
HEALTH" WHERE WE HAVE 40 OR 50 GRAD STUDENTS AS WE RECRUIT.
THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR WHERE WE CAN'T OFFER THE EVENTS, WE
PLAN TO SHARE NEWS AND INFORMATION REGARDING NATIONAL
PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK THROUGH THE SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN,
WHICH WILL OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR
POSTINGS.
NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS A SNAPSHOT. THIS REFLECTS CASE DATA AS OF 5
P.M. LAST FRIDAY. AS OF 4 P.M. TODAY, THE CASE COUNT AT 5,649
REPORTED. WE LOST 121 RESIDENTS AS REPORTED TO THE
DEPARTMENT DUE TO COVID. AND THE SLIDE SHOULD SHOW WE HAVE
959 ACTIVE CASES AS OF 4:00 TODAY. AND AS THE CITY MANAGER
MENTIONED, WE HAD 28% OF RESIDENTS THAT RECEIVED ONE DOSE,
17% OF RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED AS REPORTED TO THE
DEPARTMENT.
STATEWIDE TRENDS IN MASSACHUSETTS. NEW INFECTIONS ARE
RISING SINCE EARLY MARCH. WE TALLY FROM 1,500 CONFIRMED
CASES TO ABOUT 2,000 CONFIRMED CASES PER DAY. YOU HEARD
ABOUT THE OVERALL POSITIVITY RATE IN THE COMMONWEALTH,
WHICH IS OVER 2%. IN CAMBRIDGE, WE HOLD STEADY AT 0.56% AS THE
LATEST REPORT. AND LASTLY, FOR THE PAST WEEK, WE DID HAVE
CONFIRMED 151 NEW CONFIRMED CASES, WHICH TRANSLATES TO AN
AVERAGE OF 22 NEW CONFIRMED CASES PER DAY. THIS IS A DECREASE
FROM THE PRIOR WEEK. BUT HIGHER THAN OTHER WEEKS IN MARCH.
AND WE ARE SHOWING ON AVERAGE ABOUT 17 NEW CASES PER DAY,
LOOKING AT THE RECENT SEVEN DAY AVERAGE.
REGARDING COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S QUESTION. I DO THANK MEMBERS
OF THE COUNCIL FOR SUBMITTING THE QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME.
COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASKED, CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO HAVE
RELATIVELY LOW NUMBER OF NEW CASES COMPARED TO THE COUNTY
AND THE STATE AND THE LOW HOSPITALIZATION AND THANKFULLY
FEW NEW DEATHS. HOWEVER, THE QUESTION, WE ARE TERRIBLE
COMPARED TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN EXPERIENCING NEW
CASES. DO WE HAVE SENSE OF THE ORIGIN, WHETHER IT IS NEW
VARIANTS. THE QUESTION GOES TO WE KNOW THE AGE IS TRENDING
DOWN AND IT IS PRIMARILY YOUNGER RESIDENTS. DO WE ANY
CONTACT TRACING AND/OR INTERVIEW TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE
CASES ARE BEING SPREAD. LET ME ELABORATE. REGARDING
CONTACT TRACING. YES, OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE'S
COMMUNITY TRACING COLLABORATIVE, KNOWN AS THE CTC,
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP ON ALL NEW CASES AMONG RESIDENTS.
YOU CAN IMAGINE, DETERMINING HOW SOMEONE GETS EXPOSED TO
THE VIRUS IS DIFFICULT. IF THAT PERSON HAD MULTIPLE POTENTIAL
EXPOSURES.


PAGE 8

Jun 1, 2020

RECOGNIZING THIS CHALLENGE, WE LOOK AT RECENT CASE DATA
WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE STATE'S COMMUNITY TRACING
COLLABORATIVE AND WE CAN MAKE SOME OF THE OBSERVATIONS,
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF EXPOSURE OCCUR IN SITUATIONS WHERE
INDIVIDUALS ARE UNMASKED, AT HOME WITH HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS.
IN THIS CASE, THE INDIVIDUAL MAY SPREAD THE VIRUS TO OTHERS IN
THE HOUSEHOLD. WE FOUND WE ARE SEEING A SIMILAR LEVEL OF
TRANSMISSION AMONG CLOSE CONTACT FROM DIFFERENT
HOUSEHOLDS. THEY COULD BE FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS FROM
DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS. SPENDING TIME TOGETHER.
WE ARE SEEING IN SMALLER NUMBERS TRANSMISSIONS ASSOCIATED
WITH TRAVEL OR PLAYING WITH SORTS, WHETHER IT IS INDOOR OR
OUTDOOR, DINING, AND WORKPLACES. LASTLY, IN TERMS OF WHAT
AGE GROUPS ARE BEING IMPACTED. CHILDREN AND TEENS, 0 19,
COMPRISE THE LARGEST COHORT OF NEW CASES. IS THIS TRUE FOR
SOME WEEKS. IN CAMBRIDGE, THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CASES HAVE
BEEN AMONG RESIDENTS IN THE 20S AND CONTINUES TO BE TRUE FOR
MOST OF THE RECENT INFECTIONS.
THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION IS VARIANTS. OUR DEPARTMENT,
WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING IN CONCERT WITH THE STATE, THE
MORE TRANSMISSIBLE VARIANT B.1.1.7 IS A FACTOR IN THE RISING
RATES IN CAMBRIDGE AND THE STATE. BUT NOT THE ONLY FACTOR.
WE TALK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC FATIGUE COMPOUNDED BY
LOOSENING RESTRICTIONS IN THE COMMONWEALTH, BUT ACROSS THE
COUNTRY. AND AS OF TODAY, THERE HAVE BEEN 712 CASES OF THE
VARIANT B.1.1.7. 58 CASES OF P.1. CLOSER TO HOME, WE HAVE BEEN
NOTIFIED OF TEN VARIANT CASES AMONG CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS.
TOTAL OF 10. SIX ATTRIBUTED TO THE VARIANT B.1.1.7. ONE CASE TO
THE VARIANT P.1. AND THREE CASES FOR THE VARIANT B.1.351. KEEP
IN MIND, AS WE MENTIONED ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, WE ARE
ECHOING OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS, WE ARE NOT OUT OF
THE WOODS YET AND THEREFORE MUST BE VIGILANT IN THE WEEKS
AHEAD. WE SHOULD DO ALL WE CAN TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION SO
THE VARIANTS DON'T GAIN A GREATER FOOTHOLD IN THE
COMMONWEALTH. THAT WAS A LONGER RESPONSE. THANK YOU FOR
THAT QUESTION. MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE.
WE SHOW YOU THE BAR GRAPHS EACH WEEK SO YOU CAN SEE THE
COMMITMENT BY THE CITY SINCE LAST SUMMER. OUR COMMUNITY
TESTING PROGRAM CONTINUES TO OPERATE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
ACROSS FOUR SITES AND IS ROBUST. WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE SINCE
THE PEAK IN JANUARY. AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN ASKED THE
QUESTION, THE FDA APPROVED TWO RAPID TESTS. AVAILABILITY OF
AT HOME RAPID SELF TEST COULD BE A GAME CHANGER IN DEALING
WITH THE PANDEMIC. IT REQUIRES PEOPLE HAVE EASY HOUSE FREE
ACCESS TO THE TEST. HOW DO WE ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE
NEW RAPID TEST. I WOULD SAY, THE AVAILABILITY OF THE RAPID
TESTS, THEY WERE ANNOUNCED THIS PAST FRIDAY, AND IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET FOR A FEW
WEEKS. AND HOWEVER, WHILE THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE
TESTS ARE NOT IN THE PURVIEW TO MANAGE, WE HAVE TIME TO
CONSIDER THE BEST WAY TO USE THEM IN AN EQUITABLE FASHION TO
PROTECT RESIDENTS.
WE TRY TO KEEP THE COUNCIL APPRISE OF WHO IS ELIGIBLE. WE ARE
CURRENTLY AT PHASE 2, GROUP 5. JUST KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUALS


PAGE 9

Jun 1, 2020

55 AND OLDER, INDIVIDUALS WITH ONE HEALTH QUALIFYING
CONDITION AS OF TODAY, THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE
VACCINATION. PLEASE NOTE THE CDC AND STATE ADDED TO THE LIST
OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS, TYPE 1 DIABETES, HIV, OVERWEIGHT AS
DEFINED BY BODY MASS INDEX AND HAVING A SUBSTANCE USE
DISORDER.
NEXT SLIDE. SO, IN TERMS OF STATEWIDE. JUST KNOW THAT WE
CONTINUE TO SEE THAT VACCINES ARE GETTING SHOTS IN ARM. A
THIRD OF THE RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE. WE
ALSO SEE OVER 600,000 DOSES HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO THE
COMMONWEALTH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS I SAID, THE
TIMELINE FOR THE REMAINING GROUPS, THIS WEEK RESIDENTS 55 AND
OLDER AND THOSE WITH MON MEDICAL CONDITION ARE ELIGIBLE. IN
TWO WEEKS, 16 AND OVER WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED.
RESIDENTS CAN PRE REGISTER TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT AT THE
MASS VACCINATION SITE. NEXT SLIDE.
REGARDING PHASE 2 ELIGIBLE GROUPS. THANKS TO OUR PARTNERS AT
THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE. JUST KNOW, THESE ARE
DATA SINCE OUR ROLLOUT IN EARLY JANUARY. AS OF APRIL 1, OVER
2,600 ELIGIBLE PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF
MODORNA OR SINGLE DOSE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
WITH THE OUTREACH TO UNHOUSED, WE HAVE PROVIDED A TOTAL OF
600. 631 FIRST AND SECOND DOSES TO THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY.
JUST KNOW, TOMORROW OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUR PARTNERS WILL
BEGIN THE HOMEBOUND VACCINE PROGRAM BY VACCINATING OVER
100 ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED THUS FAR. ELIGIBILITY
IS BEING ASSESSED BY THE COUNCIL ON AGING AND THE SOMERVILLE
ELDER SERVICES AND PROGRAM AND TO MENTION OUR DEPARTMENT
IS ALREADY VACCINATED 13 HOMEBOUND INDIVIDUALS WITH
VACCINES REMAINING FROM THE PRIOR CLINICS HOLD IN THE
CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY BUILDINGS.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT VICE MAYOR MALLON POSED A
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS. HOW IS CPH WORKING TO
ENSURE UNSHELTERED, UNHOUSED RESIDENTS ARE FULLY
VACCINATED. CPH WORKING WITH THE FIRST STEP OUTREACH VAN
AND HSHS STREET SCREECH HARVARD SQUARE OUTREACH TEAM TO
ADMINISTER VACCINE TO UNHOUSED RESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T RECEIVE
THEM WHILE IN SHELTER? AS THE SLIDE SAID, WE PROVIDED OVER 600
DOSES OF THE VACCINE TO THE UNHOUSED POPULATION. AS WE HAVE
DONE THROUGHOUT THE VACCINE ROLLOUT, WE'LL CONTINUE TO
WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO ENSURE THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE
TO UNHOUSED RESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM. WE CAN DO
THIS BECAUSE OF THE STRONG PARTNERSHIP ON THE GROUND WITH
THE MEMBERS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE, BUT
WORKING WITH BAY COVE HUMAN SERVICES AND THE HEALTHCARE
FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAM AND OTHERS IN THE CITY. WE'LL
REPORT BACK TO THE COUNCIL AS WE MAKE PROGRESS TO GET TO THE
UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS.
NEXT SLIDE. REGARDING INITIAL UPDATES. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL
QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILLORS REGARDING THE VACCINE AND OUR
OUTREACH EFFORTS. VICE MAYOR MALLON ASKED ABOUT HOW ARE
WE ENSURING CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS OR EMPLOYEES AT


PAGE 10

Jun 1, 2020

ORGANIZATIONS BASED IN CAMBRIDGE WHO DO NOT HAVE LEGAL
STATUS FEEL SAFE MAKING AN APPOINTMENT AND GETTING
VACCINATING. THE FEDERAL PROGRAM ASKED FOR STATE ID AND IN
THIS GROUP, A PAY STUB IS REQUIRED TO PROVE ELIGIBILITY, WHICH
MANY DO NOT HAVE. LEGAL STATUS CAN NOT PROVIDE. HOW DO WE
PROVIDE ACCESS THE VACCINE SAFELY OR MARKETING FOR CLINIC
THAT DO NOT ASK FOR ID OR PAY STUB FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT LEGAL
STATUS. AS SANCTUARY CITY, WE EXTEND TO VACCINATIONS. WE DO
NOT ASK FOR IDENTIFICATION OF ANYONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE
CITY RUN VACCINE CLINIC, I DO UNDERSTAND THE FEDERAL
PHARMACY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY REFERENCE IN YOUR QUESTION
REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A VACCINE. KEEP IN
MIND, OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY AT LARGE, WE DON'T HAVE
CONTROL OVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
FEDERAL PHARMACY PROGRAM. WE DO ASSIST RESIDENTS WITH
NAVIGATING THROUGH THE PROCESS.
MAYOR SIDDIQUI ASKED, CAN YOU SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC WHAT
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT VACCINES AND CHILDREN. I WILL DEFER TO
DR. DOBBERTEEN TO ELABORATE. PFIZER EXPECTS A VACCINE TO BE
READY FOR USE IN TEENS AGES 12 15 IN LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL.
WHICH IS VERY EXCITING NEWS. TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY AND THE
EXPECTATION THAT CHILDREN AGES 5 11 CAN BE VACCINATED IN
EARLY 22, 2022, WITH THE VERY YOUNGEST GETTING VACCINES LATER
NEXT YEAR. DURING THE Q&A WILL ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN TO
ELABORATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. ON THIS SLIDE
LASTLY, MAYOR SIDDIQUI ASKED, WHEN VACCINE SUPPLY BECOMES
AVAILABLE, WHAT IS THE PLAN TO REACH RESIDENTS IN NORTH
CAMBRIDGE WHERE WE SEE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES. WE HAVE AT
LEAST CONVEYED TO THE STATE, WE ARE MODERATE RISK LEVEL
COMMUNITY, WE DO HAVE THE RELATIVE DISPARITIES ACROSS THE
FIVE HIGH NEED AREAS ACROSS THE CITY. JUST KNOW, OUR
DEPARTMENT AND CITY PARTNERS ARE WORKING ON THE CONCRETE
PLAN TO VACCINATE ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS IN THE HARDEST HIT
NEIGHBORHOODS, NORTH CAMBRIDGE. WE HAVE RECEIVED 3,000
DOSES OF VACCINE FROM THE STATE TO DEGREES THE AREAS OF
HIGHEST NEED AND STARTING WITH NORTH CAMBRIDGE
NEIGHBORHOOD BASED ON THE ANALYSIS. ONCE THE ADDITIONAL
VACCINES ARE AVAILABLE, WE'LL CONDUCT SIMILAR OUTREACH
ACTIVITIES IN EAST CAMBRIDGE, WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON AND THE
PORT NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'LL KEEP THIS COUNCIL UPDATED AS WE
MAKE PROGRESS.
NEXT SLIDE. WITH REGARD TO VACCINATION DATA BY RACE AND
ETHNICITY. AS THE SLIDE SHOWS, THE PROPORTION OF RESIDENTS
WHO HAVE HEAD AT LEAST ONE DOSE, COMPARE CAMBRIDGE TO THE
REST OF THE COMMONWEALTH, WE CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE
COMMONWEALTH WHEN IT COMES TO THE BLACK AND LATINX. WE
ARE SHOWING 29% OF THE VACCINES ADMINISTERED HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE COMPARED TO 22% IN THE COMMONWEALTH. AND FOR
LATINX, 17% COMPARED TO 15% ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH. KEEP
IN MIND, THIS IS A RESULT OF A CONCERTED EFFORT BY THE PARTNERS
ON THE GROUND. THANKS TO THE HOUSING AUTHORITY, COUNCIL ON
AGING, THIS COMMISSION, AND OUR FANTASTIC CLINICAL AND
OUTREACH STAFF, AND THE TEAM AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, PRO EMS,
NURSING STAFF, AND THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CORPS. THEY

HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE AMBASSADORS ON THE GROUND.
COUPLE OF MORE SLIDES AND I WRAP UP. RECOGNIZING THAT
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER ASKED A QUESTION WITH ALL
MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS AGE 16 AND OLDER SOON BEING ABLE TO
RECEIVE THE VACCINE STARTING ON APRIL 19. WHAT IS THE CITY
DOING TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT TO CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS AND
WHAT SHOULD RESIDENTS KNOW ABOUT SIGNING UP FOR THE
VACCINE, WHERE TO SIGN UP, HOW LONG DELAY BASED ON SUPPLY, ET
CETERA. COMMUNICATION OUTREACH CONTINUE WITH A FOCUS ON
APRIL 1920 ALL CAMBRIDGE ADULTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE. EFFORTS ARE
CITY WIDE AND TARGETED. CITY WIDE COMMUNICATION WILL
INCLUDE A MAILER IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES WITH EMPHASIS ON TWO
MESSAGES. THE VACCINE IS SAFE, FREE, AND EFFECTIVE. AND HOW TO
REGISTER. WALKING THEM THROUGH STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS.
WE'LL HAVE POSTERS AT BLUE BIKE STATIONS. SOCIAL MEDIA, WE
HAVE THE CITY EMAIL AND THE WEBSITE FOR UPDATES. AND UPDATES
AS NEEDED, BUT WE'LL TRY TO ADJUST THE MESSAGING AS WE MOVE
THROUGH. THE TARGETED OUTREACH WILL HAVE GRASSROOTS
OUTREACH IN SELECT NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE'LL WORK WITH
COMMUNITY MEMBERS, NONPROFITS, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, AND
MORE TO REACH NEIGHBORHOODS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
HARDEST HIT BY COVID WHO MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE
VACCINE AND QUESTIONS REGARDING THE COST. IT IS FREE. AND
REMAIN THOSE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF THE VACCINE.
WITH REGARD TO THE CLINICIANS SPEAKERS BUREAU, THIS ACTIVITY
CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST AND ACTIVITY. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE
DR. DOBBERTEEN AND THE ASSOCIATE CHIEF FOR CLINICAL SERVICES,
WHO PARTICIPATED IN THEIR SECOND VACCINE CONVERSATION FOR
FAMILIES FROM THE FOLLOWING CPS CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
BALDWIN, PEABODY, ET CETERA. ALONG WITH THE MAYOR AND
ROBIN HARRIS, AND THIS OCCURRED THIS LAST THURSDAY APRIL 1.
DR. DOBBERTEEN AND TRACY WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE LAST OF A
THREE PART SERIES ON FRIDAY, APRIL 9, THIS COMING FRIDAY FOR
FAMILIES FROM THE LAST GROUPINGS OF SCHOOLS.
SHARING WITH YOU OBSERVATIONS, PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION,
PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED, WHO WAS CERTAIN TO GET THE VACCINE
AND WHO IS HESITANT TO GET THE VACCINE. BEFORE THE
PRESENTATION, 55% WERE HESITANT TO GET THE VACCINE. 45% WERE
SURE THEY WOULD GET IT. AND WE SAW THAT AFTER THE
PRESENTATION, THE NUMBER OF HESITANT DROPPED TO 25%. AND
THOSE THAT INDICATED THEY WILL GET THE VACCINE INCREASED TO
75%. WE HAVE LEARNED SINCE THAT 90% OF STAFF AT ONE SITE AND
OVER 60% AT ANOTHER HAVE ALREADY BEEN VACCINATED SO FAR. I
WANT TO THANK DR. DOBBERTEEN AND TRACY FOR BEING
AMBASSADORS WITH THE CPS PARTNERS.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF ACTIVITY SINCE LAST FALL.
WE HAVE THIS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHERE OVER 1400 UNIQUE
ADULTS HAVE BEEN TESTED IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE HAVE
ADMINISTERED OVER 21,000 TESTS. REGARDING THE STUDENTS, WE
HAD OVER 1,200 UNIQUE CHILDREN TESTED. AND WE HAVE
ADMINISTERED OVER 4,000 TESTS. ONE CORRECTION ON THE SLIDE
REGARDING THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE CASES, THAT SHOULD READ 54
POSITIVE CASES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE SCHOOL PCR
TESTING AND WITH REGARD TO POOL TESTING, A NEWER OFFERING ON


PAGE 12

Jun 1, 2020

MONDAY THE 27TH, THE STAFF ADMINISTERED 263 TESTING POOLS AND
APPROXIMATELY 1476 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SWABBED.
NEXT SLIDE. THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION. SO, WE TRY TO
SHARE AS A CONTEXT A COMPLEMENT TO THE NUMBERS. WE LIKE TO
SHARE WITH THE COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS WE GET ABOUT THE
WORK ON THE GROUND. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE. THIS IS SENT TO A
STAFF. AND THIS IS BY THE DAUGHTER OF A HOMEBOUND WOMAN.
MOST APPRECIATED OF ALL IS YOUR CARE. SO UPLIFTING TO KNOW
THAT PEOPLE LIKE AND YOU THE EM TECHNICIANS, YOU ARE NOT
ONLY SAVING LIVES, BUT BRINGING JOY INTO ELDERLY HOMES, MY
MOTHER ENJOYED ALL OF YOU, AS DO I. I'M AN ARTIST AND I SEND
YOU MY ANGEL OF HOPE. WE TRY TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL HOW WE
HEAR, THANKS AND KUDOS FROM THE FRONT. IT IS A HEAVY LIFT FOR
OVER A YEAR AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTARY
SHARED WITH OUR FANTASTIC TEAM. SPECIAL SHUTOUT TO THE
INCREDIBLE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ON THE FRONT LINE NONSTOP
SINCE LAST YEAR. FOR ALL IT IS WORTH, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REPORT. DR. DOBBERTEEN, IF YOU HAVE
COMMENTS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE OPEN UP TO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM
THE BODY. WE GO TO VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I HAVE TWO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ON
THE QUESTIONS I ASKED. YOU INDICATED YOU WILL WORK WITH
PARTNERS TO DO THIS I HEARD FROM SOME OUTREACH, THEY SEE
UNHOUSED AND UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS THEY RUN INTO
UNHOUSED AND UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS EVERY NIGHT. IT WOULD
BE GREAT TO HAVE SOMEONE ALONG WITH THEM AND CAN
ADMINISTER THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE RIGHT THERE AND
WORK THROUGH THE POPULATION. I WONDER HOW YOU WORK WITH
THE PARTNERS AND IF THAT IS AN OPTION?
>> MY JACOB: I WILL START AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.
RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS EASIER TO GET TO THE STATIC SITES. WE ARE
AWARE THERE ARE UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS OUT AND ABOUT. IT IS
HAVING AMPLE VACCINE IN HAPPENED. WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE TO
THE SERVICE PROVIDERS THIS IS AN AREA OF FOCUS. WE MADE A
COMMITMENT TO GET TO NORTH CAMBRIDGE AS AN AREA OF HIGH
NEED. WE ARE INTENTIONAL IN CONNECTING WITH THE UNSHELTERED
RESIDENTS. WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN, BUT ONCE WE HAVE VACCINE IN
HAND, PREFERABLY THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON, ONE DOSE, THAT IS THE
WAY TO GO. WE ARE AGILE WITH THE PARTNERS AND MAKE SURE WE
STAY AHEAD OF THIS AND WORK IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE
SERVICE PROVIDERS. DR. DOBBERTEEN, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS
ANYTHING ELSE YOU TO ADD IN TERMS OF THE EFFORTS?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO
REQUEST FROM THE STATE ANOTHER ALLOTMENT OF THE VACCINE
FOR THE UNHOUSED. WE USED ALL OF THE ALLOTMENT FOR THE
UNHOUSED POPULATION. WE NEED ANOTHER CHUNK OF VACCINE TO
BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND DO THOSE FOLKS. ONCE WE DO, WE HAVE A
NUMBER OF GOOD IDEAS PERCOLATING ABOUT FINDING PEOPLE
WHERE THEY ARE. I'M CONFIDENT IF WE CAN GET THE VACCINE, WE'LL
BE ABLE TO MAKE INROADS IN THE FOLKS WE HAVEN'T CONNECTED
WITH YET.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT. I KNOW THAT


PAGE 13

Jun 1, 2020

OUTREACH TEAM IS DEFINITELY WILLING TO BE A PARTNER ONCE WE
HAVE THE VACCINES IN HAND. I KNOW THEY ARE A PARTNER OF
YOURS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING US KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.
UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE AND THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE FOR THE
DIFFERENT REGULATIONS ON THE STATE, FEDERAL AND CITY SIDE, I
WONDER, YOU SAID YOU ARE ASSISTING RESIDENTS TO NAVIGATE THE
PROCESS. I WONDER HOW IS THERE A CALL CENTER OR A PUBLIC
HEALTH DOING OUTREACH TO EMPLOYEES PARTICULARLY IN THE
SERVICE INDUSTRY IN CAMBRIDGE. IS THERE A WAY FOR ISD TO WORK
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO GET INFORMATION OUT
ABOUT WHAT DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED AT EACH OF THE
DIFFERENT LEVELS. IT IS DIFFERENT AT THE CITY LEVEL VERSUS THE
FEDERAL PHARMACY PROGRAM.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I'D SAY THAT AS
A SITUATION CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING
DIRECTLY WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS, WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE
THE RIGHT INFORMATION GETS IN THE RIGHT HANDS. FOR EXAMPLE,
TODAY 55 AND OLDER WITH ONE HEALTH CONDITION, THEY ARE
ELIGIBLE. WE ARE TRYING TO STAND UP DEDICATED CLINICS TO MAKE
SURE WE GET TO THE PUBLIC WORK STAFF, THE FRONTLINE STAFF
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. IT IS NOT JUST ONE APPROACH, WE ARE TRYING
TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND TO
IDENTIFY THE FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE
GET THE INFORMATION TO THEM. THAT'S ALL CAN I SHARE RIGHT
NOW. WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB IN GETTING TO THE UNHOUSED
FOLKS. WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB GETTING TO THE ELDERLY, AND
TRY TO MAKE SURE WE TRANSLATE THE MATERIALS AND MAKE SURE
THE INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE. I WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DO HAVE A ROBUST CALL CENTER. IT IS
SUPPORTED BY THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE. THAT HAS BEEN A GAME
CHANGER FOR US SINCE LAST FALL. WE TRY TO HAVE IT STAFFED AND
POPULATED BY FOLKS ACROSS LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. TO MAKE
SURE WE CAN ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FOLKS WHO MAY STILL BE
HESITANT ABOUT GETTING THE VACCINE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO DRIVE HOME
THIS IS A REALLY VULNERABLE GROUP FOR VACCINE HESITANCY AND
FOR THAT LACK OF DOCUMENTATION. I HOPE THAT THE CAMBRIDGE
HEALTH DEPARTMENT CAN CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE THIS
VULNERABLE GROUP, PARTICULARLY IN OUR SERVICE INDUSTRY.
THANK YOU. THOSE ARE MY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN? I'M SORRY. DR.
DOBBERTEEN? AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: A QUICK ADDITION TO WHAT MR. JAKE HAS
SAID. IN THE VACCINE FORUMS WITH MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, WE ARE
BRINGING HOME THE INFORMATION THAT DOCUMENTATION IS NOT
NEEDED. THE VACCINES ARE FREE AND DOCUMENTATION IS NOT
NEEDED. AND TRYING TO GET THAT WORD OUT AND LOOKING AT
WAYS WE MAY BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR INSPECTIONAL
SERVICES COLLEAGUES AND THE SERVICE INDUSTRY AS WELL. I'M
TOTAL IN AGREEMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON
AND WE ARE DOING OUR BEST.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE


PAGE 14

Jun 1, 2020

PRESENTATION. I WILL FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION, IF I
UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY, I KNOW WE HAVE DONE A LOT ON
FEES. YET, WE HAVEN'T DONE WHAT SOME OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE
IN TERMS OF TOTALLY WAIVED FEES BEYOND SOME OF THE BUSINESS
FEES. EVEN IF AS WE TALKED, SOMERVILLE SPENT, ACCORDING TO
THEM, $750 IN FEES THAT ARE WAIVED. AND EVEN IF WE OTHERS
HAVEN'T DONE MUCH, WE HAVE RESOURCES. ARE YOU SAYING YOU
WON'T WAIVE ANY ADDITIONAL FEES? MAYBE BUSINESS OPERATING
FEES?
>> CITY MANAGER: AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK IN THE PAST,
WE HAVE RESEARCHED, NO CITY HAS WAIVED MORE FEES THAN US.
WE ARE PROUD OF THAT AND WE'RE IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO DO
THAT. I WILL MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR. FY22, WE ARE COMMITTED TO
WAIVING FEES. A BLANKET STATE THAT WE'LL WAIVE EVERY FEE IN
THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M ENDORSING. I'M
WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY DEPARTMENTS, WITH THE BUSINESS
COMMUNITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN WAIVE. I WOULD THINK
WHATEVER WE WAIVE THIS YEAR, WE'LL LOOK INTO WAIVING NEXT
YEAR, MAYBE ADDITIONAL ONES. WE HAVE TO REALIZE WHAT THAT
IMPACT MEANS ON THE BUDGET AND WE ARE GOING BUDGET BY
BUDGET, DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT, THE FIRST ONE IS THE PUBLIC
WORKS ONE AND WE WAIVED IT.
AGAIN, I KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. THIS
IS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF REVENUE. WE WANT TO HAVE A
STRATEGIC PLAN. WE DEGREE WITH YOU, WE NEED TO HELP THE
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. WHEN IT IS SAID AND DONE, I THINK WE'LL BE
THE LEADER IN WAIVING FEES FOR FY22. WE'D DO MORE IF WE COULD.
I DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO ANNOUNCE WE'LL WAIVE ALL FEES YET.
WHEN WE ARE DONE, I THINK THE COUNCIL AND BUSINESS
COMMUNITY WILL BE PLEASED WITH OUR NUMBER. I WILL ASSURE
YOU OF THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I UNDERSTOOD I'M SORRY. MAY I RESPOND?
I UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO ANNOUNCE WAIVING ALL
FEES. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING WE COULD. MY
UNDERSTANDING IS, AS YOU INDICATE, 40% OF SOME FEES. AGAIN,
BASED ON HAVING A COUPLE OF OTHER CITIES WAIVING 100%. I'D LIKE
US TO BE AHEAD OF OTHERS. AND NOT JUST THE LICENSE FEES, BUT
OTHER FEES. WHETHER IT IS DUMPSTER FEES, AS WE TALKED ABOUT
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. OPERATING FEES FOR HAIR SALONS.
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS. THE
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT PART OF AN ASSOCIATION. WE
HAVE NUMBER OF AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT
ASSOCIATION.
WE STAND BEHIND YOU. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN. AND I HOPE IT IS
MORE THAN WE HAVE DONE TO DATE AND WE CAN REALLY EVEN
FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR. THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR ANSWERING
MY QUESTION. I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION
BRIEFLY. THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING CAN'T BE OVERSTATED. AND


PAGE 15

Jun 1, 2020

THE CITY DID A GREAT JOB MAKING TESTING AVAILABLE TO THE
RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC, WHICH HELPED A LOT. WITH
THE NEW AT HOME TEST, WE CAN RESPOND FASTER BECAUSE PEOPLE
CAN GET THE TEST AT HOME AND QUICKLY DIAGNOSE WHETHER THEY
HAVE BEEN INFECTED OR NOT. IF THEY WERE EXPOSED OR THEY ARE
AWARE OF INFECTION IN THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
THEY CAN ONLY DO THAT IF THEY HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE TEST. IT
HAPPENED ON FRIDAY, SO WE DON'T HAVE A ANSWER YET. I THINK IT
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THIS
RAPID TESTING IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC SO THAT PEOPLE
CAN VERY QUICKLY ISOLATE IF THEY TURN OUT TO HAVE COVID SO
WE CAN USE THE SPREAD WHILE WE GET EVERYBODY VACCINATED.
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. WE'LL
MOVE TO PLACE THIS ITEM ON FILE ALONG WITH THE
COMMUNICATION FROM OTHER CITY OFFICERS.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) EIGHT IN FAVOR AND
ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOTION BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE TO CLOSE
PUBLIC COMMENT. ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THAT MOTION: (ROLL CALL) EIGHT IN FAVOR AND
ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. MOVING TO CITY
MANAGER AGENDA ITEM FOUR. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM
NUMBER 4).

CITY MANAGER AGENDA #1

A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to an update
on COVID-19 vaccination
rollout.
COMMUNICATIONS AND
REPORT FROM OTHER CITY
OFFICERS #2

A communication was received
from Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui,
transmitting questions for the
COVID-19 Update.

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I HAD A COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS FOR THE CITY MANAGER ABOUT THE BOARD OF ZONING
APPEALS AND THE CURRENT MEMBERSHIP. ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE OF
COLOR CURRENTLY SERVING ON THE BOARD OF SCREENING APPEALS?
>> CITY MANAGER: YES. I WILL HAVE OTHERS GET INTO THE
SPECIFICS.
>> DAVID: ONE ASSOCIATE MEMBER WHO IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN
FEMALE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. AND OF HOW MANY
MEMBERS?
>> DAVID: WITH THIS APPOINTMENT, CURRENTLY TEN MEMBERS,
FULL MEMBERS, AND THE ASSOCIATE MEMBERS. TOTAL OF 10. WITH
THIS APPOINTMENT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. AND THEN, WHAT IS THE
BOARD RECRUITMENT LIKE AND HOW ARE PEOPLE RECRUITED OR
CONTACTED WHEN THERE IS AN OPENING FOR A BZA OR OTHER
COMMISSION?
>> CITY MANAGER: GREAT QUESTION. LET ME JUST TALK IN GENERAL.
BACK IN 2018, I MADE A COMMITMENT TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY ON
THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BEFORE THE REPORT THAT CAME OUT
IN AUGUST. WE CAN GO OVER THE SPECIFICS. I WANT TO SAY, IN THE
LAST TEN MONTHS, 50% OF MY NEW APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS AND
COMMISSIONS HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OF COLOR. SOMETHING I TAKE
PRIDE IN AND SOMETHING WE WORK IN. IT IS SOMETHING WE'LL


PAGE 16

Jun 1, 2020

CONTINUE TO WORK IN. IT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND SOMETHING WE
CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE IMPROVEMENT. THE BOARD SHOULD
REFLECT THE RESIDENTS. I WILL SAY, THIS IS I APPRECIATE THE
QUESTION, WE ARE WORKING ON IT. I CAN ASK DAVID WHO IS ON THE
COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS. THIS IS A PRIORITY AND
HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. I'M PROUD OF US, ESPECIALLY OVER
THE LAST TEN MONTHS. THE 50% NUMBER.
>> DAVID: I WILL NOTE THAT ON THE BOARD CURRENTLY WITH THIS
APPOINTMENT THERE ARE FIVE MALES AND FIVE FEMALES ON THE
BOARD. BY AND LARGE, WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE POOL OF
CANDIDATES THAT WE RECEIVED SO WE'LL ADVERTISE AGAIN AND
WE'LL WORK WITH LEE GIANETTI AND HIS TEAM TO IN ADDITION TO
DOING THE CABLE TV AND THE EMAIL BLAST TO RESIDENTS, WE'LL
TRY TO STRATEGIZE HOW WE CAN RECRUIT A BROADER AUDIENCE FOR
THE POSITIONS. AGAIN, BOARD OF ZONING APPEAL IS LIKE THE
PLANNING BOARD AND A FEW OTHERS. SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING TO
GET RESIDENTS TO APPLY BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT TIME
COMMITMENT. WE'LL CERTAINLY TAKE WHAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED
AND WHAT THE MANAGER NOTED AND REFORTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO
DO MORE OUTREACH TO SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A MORE
DIVERSE POOL WITH THE NEXT SET OF APPOINTMENTS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I THINK THE REPORT YOU
REFERENCED FROM AUGUST OF 2019 TOLD US THAT 73% OF THE BOARD
AND COMMISSION MEMBERS ARE WHITE. 12% ARE BLACK AND 3%
HISPANIC AND LATINO AND 10% ASIAN AMERICAN OR PACIFIC
ISLANDERS. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT THAT HAS COME FROM
THOSE NUMBERS AND THE APPOINTMENTS THAT HAVE COME
FORWARD IN THE TEN MONTHS. HOWEVER, THEY MAKE CRITICAL
DECISIONS ABOUT HOUSING AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A BROAD
SPECTRUM, WE'LL HAVE BOARDS THAT DON'T REPRESENTS THE
RESIDENTS. I AGREE THEY ARE REALLY HARD TO RECRUIT BECAUSE
THEY ARE VOLUNTEER, LONG HOURS, THEY ARE THANKLESS TO BOOT,
WHEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RECRUIT INTO OPEN POSITIONS EVERY
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ENSURE WE HAVE A PERSON OF COLOR
TO RECRUIT. I WILL VOTE NO ON THIS AND NOT BECAUSE OF HER
ABILITY OR QUALIFICATIONS, AND I THANK HER FOR VOLUNTEERING
IN THIS CAPACITY, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE A MORE SERIOUS
EFFORT TO RECRUIT AND APPOINT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND DEVELOP A
STRATEGY TO WORK ON THE REPRESENTATION NUMBERS. I BELIEVE
THE CITY MANAGER AND YOUR TEAM SHOULD COME BACK WITH
ANOTHER CANDIDATE THAT IS BETTER REPRESENTATIVE, WHO WILL
MAKE THE CRUCIAL HOUSING DECISIONS IN OUR CITY MOVING
FORWARD. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY. AND
FOR BRINGING FORWARD CANDIDATES ON OTHER BOARDS AND
CANDIDATES, THIS ONE IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR US TO OVERLOOK AT
THIS POINT. I WILL VOTE NO. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WANT TO FOLLOW UP. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE
VICE MAYOR MALLON'S COMMENTS. THE THREE APPOINTMENTS I
REACHED WE ARE AWARE OF IT AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON
IT. THIS IS A NOTIFICATION. I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF
THAT. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS. TRUST ME, WE'LL CONTINUE TO
WORK ON IT. AND LIKE I SAID, I SAID I'D WORK ON THIS IN 18, A YEAR
AND HALF BEFORE THE REPORT CAME OUT AND WILL CONTINUE TO
WORK ON IT. IT IS A PRIORITY. I RECENTLY LOOKED AT THE LAST TEN


PAGE 17

Jun 1, 2020

MONTHS, WE ARE AT 50% FOR NEW APPOINTMENTS. WE ARE PROUD
AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN AND I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH
IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I ECHO ALL OF THE CRITIQUES
FROM VICE MAYOR MALLON. I HAVE ONE QUESTION ON THIS. WERE
ANY OF THE BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS IN CAMBRIDGE, DO WE OFFER
COMPENSATION? I KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO IN
SOMERVILLE. IT IS HARD TO RECRUIT PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS
VOLUNTEER, MAYBE IT SHOULDN'T BE A VOLUNTEER POSITION?
>> CITY MANAGER: COUNCILLOR CARLONE HAS BEEN A LEADER OF
THIS DISCUSSION NOW FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. MAYBE LONGER.
WE HAVE NOT MADE THAT DECISION YET. WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS.
AT THIS POINT, WE ARE NOT COMPENSATING. WE HAD DISCUSSIONS
FOR A WHILE WITH COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.
AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE NOT MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: ESPECIALLY FOR THIS POSITION,
FOR THE PLANNING BOARD, SOME OF THE REALLY HIGH TIME
COMMITMENT, BUT HIGH IMPACT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WE
HAVE IN CAMBRIDGE, THEY SHOULD BE COMPENSATED. AND THAT'S
THE WAY TO RECRUIT DIVERSE CANDIDATES. TO REALLY MATCH THE
DIVERSITY IN THE CITY. AS VICE MAYOR MALLON SAID, THAT'S NOT
THE CASE. ALL THE BOARDS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH HUGE IMPACT,
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY IN GENDER
AND SOCIOECONOMIC AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY. AND RENTERS, 2/3
RENTERS, THAT IS NOT THE CASE ON THE BOARDS THAT MAKE THE
DECISIONS. I WILL VOTE NO ON THIS. I REALIZE IT IS A NOTIFICATION.
AS WE TALK ABOUT CHARTER REVIEW, WE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS TO
HAVE AN IMPACT HERE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR ASTRAY
FROM WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US. AS WE THINK ABOUT THE BOARDS
AND COMMISSIONS, THE BZA AND PLANNING BOARD, THEY MAKE
DECISIONS ABOUT HOUSING, THEY ARE NOT DIVERSE IN TERMS OF
RACE, THEY ARE NOT DIVERSE IN TERMS OF AGE, NOT DIVERSE IN
TERMS OF HOME OWNERSHIP VERSUS RENTERS. PEOPLE BRING THEIR
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, BUT THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. IF
THAT IS DOMINATED BY A CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC, IT CAN CREATE
DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE. I THINK IT
IS IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY DO OUR BEST I DO THINK THE
RECRUITMENT IS DIFFICULT. I WOULD AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR
CARLONE AND OTHERS WHO HAVE PUSHED FOR FINDING WAYS TO
ADDRESS THAT.
AND I THINK WE OFTEN REAPPOINTMENT PEOPLE... I SHOULDN'T SAY
THIS. WE DON'T DO THE REAPPOINTMENT AND I CAN'T SAY WHAT GOES
THROUGH THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WE GET PEOPLE
REAPPOINTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT IS GREAT FOR YOU
NEED INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE, BUT I DO OFTEN
WONDER IF SOME NEW VOICES AND POINTS OF VIEW WOULD BE
BENEFICIAL. AGAIN, I KNOW IT IS HARD WORK. I WILL VOTE FOR IT. I
UNDERSTAND IT IS NOTIFICATION AND I DON'T WANT THESE ARE
FUNNY. EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT THIS, IT IS ALWAYS THE
UMBRELLA OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BEING APPOINTED. WE START
TO BRING UP THIS OTHER STUFF THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT


PAGE 18

Jun 1, 2020

INDIVIDUAL.
I DON'T WANT TO VOTE NO AND HAVE SOME PERCEPTION THAT
REFLECTS POORLY ON THE CANDIDATE. IT IS ABOUT THE WAY WE DO
IT OR NOT DO IT. I DON'T WANT IT TO REFLECT JUST A NOTIFICATION.
I DON'T WANT IT TO SOMEHOW BE MISINTERPRETED IT IS A PROBLEM
WITH WHO YOU APPOINT. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS, BUT NOT FAST
ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX TO GET BETTER
REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARDS, PARTICULARLY THE PLANNING
BOARD AND BZA.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL SAY THIS, IF YOU LOOK AT MY
APPOINTMENTS LATELY, IT IS MORE NEW APPOINTMENTS THAN
REAPPOINTMENTS. IT IS A HARD BALANCE. YOU SEE PEOPLE THAT
DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO THE CITY, WE LOOK FOR NEW FACES, THEY
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. IN MANY CASES THEY HAVE.
I RECOGNIZE THE FACT WE NEED NEW FACES AND WE TRY TO
BALANCE IT. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN. IT IS SOMETHING WE LOOK
AT CLOSELY.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. WHEN I READ WENDY
LEISERSON'S RESUME AND BACKGROUND, I WAS IMPRESSED. I DON'T
KNOW HER. WHEN I FIRST LOOKED, LET'S SEE WHO THIS IS. AND TOP
MARKS. TOP MARKS ON THE BACKGROUND. I AGREE WITH
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, AS THE MANAGER SAID,
CONSIDERING PAYING A STIPEND, IF NOT MORE. THE REASON I SAID
THAT IS NOT JUST FOR LOWER INCOME PEOPLE, BUT FOR PEOPLE WITH
A BACKGROUND IN THE AREA THEY WILL COVER. FOR EXAMPLE,
URBAN DESIGN. THERE IS NO ONE TRAINED IN URBAN DESIGN ON
THAT.
IF WE USE THE SAME STANDARD ON THE COUNCIL, ONLY TWO
MEMBERS ON THE COUNCIL RENT THEIR APARTMENTS. WE HAVE
WATCH OUT ABOUT THE STANDARDS. IT IS CITY WIDE. WHEN I WAS A
CONSULTANT, I WAS ASKED REPEATEDLY WHO COULD BE ON THE
PLANNING BOARD. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
APPLY. SOMETIMES I HEARD THE MANAGER REACTING (LAUGHING).
HE PROBABLY REMEMBERS. THEY WENT OUT TWICE FOR THE SAME
ADVERTISEMENT. IT IS NOT LIKE 30 PEOPLE SIGN UP. YOU ARE LUCKY
IF IT IS TWO AND YOU ARE LUCKY IF ONE HAS CREDENTIALS. NOT
EVEN GETTING INTO BACKGROUND. IT IS DIFFICULT. WHAT
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER SAID ABOUT A STIPEND, I THINK IT
COULD HELP. I CAN THINK OF ONE PERSON I ASKED PROBABLY 20
YEARS TO SIGN UP FOR THE PLANNING BOARD AND HE IS JUST NOT
INTERESTED. HE WOULD BE WONDERFUL ON THE PLANNING BOARD.
THANK YOU. I WANT TO MENTION THAT.
THE APPOINTEE IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT.
APPRECIATE IT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE
CONCERNS AND ALSO AGREE THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SEEMS
PRETTY WELL SUITED TO THE JOB. AS WE MOVE FORWARD, IT IS
SOMETHING NOT ONLY COUNCILLOR CARLONE SUGGESTED THE
STIPEND, AND I RAISE THE QUESTION OF IF WE DON'T DO A STIPEND,
CAN WE PAY FOR CHILDCARE OR MEALS SO THE PEOPLE CAN READILY
PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETINGS WITHOUT HAVING TO GIVE AWAY
OTHER TIME AND MISS DINNER. I KNOW THE CITY MANAGER IS
LOOKING AT THAT AND SAID HE'D TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT. I


PAGE 19

Jun 1, 2020

THINK A STIPEND IS APPROPRIATE. AT A MINIMUM, MAKE IT SO
ANYBODY WITH A CHILD AND/OR NEEDS TO HAS DINNER FOOD AS WE
KNOW, IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF GETTING
PARTICIPATION. THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOLS, WHEN FOOD AND
CHILDCARE IS PROVIDED, THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING
WILL GO UP. I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE GOAL TO
INCREASE REPRESENTATION.
I WANT TO, AS WE MOVE FORWARD, ENSURE WE FIND A WAY TO
INCLUDE THE RELATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE CITY WHO
SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. (SPEAKING SPANISH).
WE FORGET THAT BY USING ENGLISH ALL THE TIME, IT IS REALLY
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND
IDENTIFY THE WAYS IN WHICH WE IDENTIFY DIVERSITY, LET'S MAKE
SURE WE INCLUDE AS MUCH AS WE CAN A RANGE OF WAYS THAT WE
DEFINE DIVERSITY. I APPRECIATE THE CITY MANAGER TRYING VERY
HARD TO ADDRESS THIS AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE PRIOR COUNCIL
FOR WORKING ON THIS. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT YIELDED
SOME GREATER DIVERSITY THAN HAD BEEN IN THE PAST. THANK YOU.
I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: JUST QUICKLY. I KNOW THERE'S A
CONCERN ABOUT HOUSING, BUT I FOLLOW THE PLANNING BOARD
PRETTY CLOSELY. I HONESTLY CANNOT REMEMBER ONE SPECIAL
PERMIT FOR HOUSING THAT THEY TURNED DOWN. EVER. MAYBE IT IS
NOT THE RIGHT REPRESENTATION OF THE CITY, BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO HOUSING, AS I SAID, I CAN'T REMEMBER ONE. IT IS A PRETTY
INCREDIBLE RECORD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING BACK TO VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I WANT TO RESPOND TO WHAT MY
COLLEAGUE SAID. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THE PLANNING
BOARD WORKS HARD AND HAS APPROVED A NUMBER OF SPECIAL
PERMITS. HOWEVER, I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION
LAST WEEK AT THE PLANNING BOARD ABOUT THE MISSING MIDDLE
PETITION AND HOW ONE OF THE PLANNING BOARD MEMBERS, WHO IS
A PERSON OF COLOR, CHANGED THE CONVERSATION WHEN TALKING
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF ZONING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT
LENS AND EXPERIENCE ON A BOARD THAT DECIDES HOUSING. I WANT
TO RESPOND TO THAT QUICKLY. WE ARE TAKING A LOT OF TIME ON
THIS ITEM. THANK YOU. I WILL YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE ONE MORE HAND UP. THEN WE'LL PROCEED
TO VOTE. I SEE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, WHO HAS NOT SPOKEN. I
WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO WEIGH IN HERE
AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY OF TRYING TO RECRUIT
PEOPLE TO THE BOARDS AND APPRECIATE THE IMPERATIVE TO BE
MORE INCLUSIVE. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT. I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE THAT TONIGHT, CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH
THIS PARTICULAR APPOINTMENT. I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK
WITH THE CITY MANAGER AND COME UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO
INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE BOARDS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AS WE
GO FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING BACK TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO


PAGE 20

Jun 1, 2020

WHEELER AND THEN GO FROM THERE.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I WANT TO PUT IN AN
ADDITIONAL THOUGHT. THE CITY COUNCIL IS COMPENSATED. MYSELF
AND OTHERS ON THIS BODY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB IF IT
WERE NOT. I WOULD HAVE TO QUIT MY OTHER JOB AND HAVE NO
INCOME. I LOVE THE FOLKS ON THE BODY. I COULDN'T AFFORD TO DO
IT FOR FREE. FOLKS HAVE TO EAT. AND THIS BODY IS CLOSER TO
GENDER AND RACIAL ETHNIC PARITY THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. THAT'S
A BIG REASON WHY. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE PEOPLE AS A FULL
TIME JOB OR DO IT AND GET SOME SORT OF COMPENSATION FOR IT
RATHER THAN JUST THE PRESTIGE OF PUTTING IN HOURS AFTER YOUR
DAY JOB. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND GET TO
MORE REPRESENTATIVE MAKEUP OF THE BODIES, I THINK IT IS A HUGE
GOAL TO STRIVE FOR. THANKS FOR HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, WE HAVE SOME NEXT STEPS HERE. CITY
MANAGER, YOU ARE HEARING THE DIFFERENT VALID CONCERNS. WE
HAVE HEARD FROM YOU TONIGHT, SINCE THAT REPORT, THERE IS
WORK DONE. I KNOW CIVIC UNITY POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE A
DISCUSSION THERE ON NEXT STEPS ON COMPENSATION. NEXT STEPS
ON ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE
WERE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THAT REPORT. I THINK KNOWING WHAT
WORK HAS BEEN DONE AND WHAT MORE WE HAVE TO DO, I THINK TIES
CLOSELY TO THE CITY COUNCIL GOALS WE HAVE AND WHAT I HEAR
TONIGHT.
I WANT TO LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT, IT IS A CONCERN THAT
HAS COME UP FOR MANY YEARS. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS
TO IT AND THE URGENT MANNER IT DESERVES.
WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING THIS ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL).

CITY MANAGER AGENDA #4

A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appointment of the following
person as a new Associate
Member of the Board of
Zoning Appeal for a term of 5years, effective April 5, 2021:
Wendy Leiserson

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: MOTION PASSES, SEVEN IN FAVOR, TWO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 5.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 5).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. TO THE CITY MANAGER OR
OTHER STAFF, I PULLED THIS BECAUSE I'M IN FAVOR OF ENSURING ALL
STAFF HAVE THE RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT FOR THE JOB.
I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THIS IS A HYBRID BUCKET TRUCK, WHICH
IS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET SINCE 2015. UNFORTUNATELY, IN ALL


PAGE 21

Jun 1, 2020

ELECTRONIC BUCKET TRUCK, IT IS TESTED IN NEW ZEALAND SINCE
2019, MANY MAJOR PLAYERS, SUGGEST THOSE WILL NOT BE
AVAILABLE UNTIL 2022. WE DO HAVE A GREEN FLEET POLICY THAT
RECOMMENDS OR ENSURES WE ARE BUYING THE MOST ENERGY
EFFICIENT AND MOST ELECTRIFIED VEHICLE POSSIBLE. IS THIS A
HYBRID BUCKET TRUCK.
>> CITY MANAGER: WHOEVER WANTS TO HANDLE THAT CAN ANSWER
THAT QUESTION. MARK?
>> MARK: THIS BUCKET TRUCK IS A SMALL MODEL. SMALLER IN
MODEL AND A BIO DIESEL. NOT A HYBRID.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: UNLESS WE HAVE THE REPORT FROM THE
GREEN FLEET VEHICLE TASK FORCE THAT GOES THROUGH
EVERYTHING, I WILL CHARTER RIGHT THIS SO I CAN GET THE REPORT.
MY UNDERSTANDING, WE SHOULD DO A HYBRID AND THEY DO EXIST
AND HAVE BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
>> DAVID: POINT OF INFORMATION. IT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE
GREEN FLEET REVIEW COMMITTEE.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE WOULDN'T COME HERE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE
APPROVAL FIRST.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REPORT AND SEE
WHAT OTHER VEHICLES WERE CONSIDERED AND WHETHER A HYBRID
WAS CONSIDERED. IF IT WAS, WHY IT WASN'T APPROVED. WE REALLY
SHOULD BE BUYING EVERYTHING HYBRID, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. IT IS
PART OF THE POLICY, THE GREEN FLEET POLICY, I MET WITH DPW AND
THE GREEN FLEET FOLKS ABOUT THIS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
THE POLICY IS IN PLACE SINCE 2006. IT WOULD HELP ME TO
UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS IT IS BIO DIESEL INSTEAD OF HYBRID. IT
SEEMS IT WOULD BE THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT. IT IS GOOD NEWS
IT IS SMALLER. I RECOGNIZE I DIDN'T PREVIEW THIS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE REPORT IN ADVANCE. I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REPORT
ABOUT WHAT LED TO THE RECOMMENDATION. WHAT OTHER TRUCKS
ARE CONSIDERED. AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT A GREEN FLEET POLICY
SHOULD BE. I WILL CHARTER RIGHT IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN EXERCISED HER CHARTER
RIGHT ON CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 5. WE WILL GO TO CITY
MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 6. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER
6).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT A
WAR MEMORIAL WITH A WORKING POOL. WE GOT THE MEMO
SUGGESTING THAT A STUDY IN 2019 WAS DONE TO PERFORM THE
COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE POOL AND DETERMINED THAT
SOME THINGS NEED TO BE CHANGED. MY QUESTION IS HOW LONG HAS
IT BEEN? WERE THE POOLS NOT COMPLETELY REDONE DURING THE
RENOVATION OF THE WAR MEMORIAL? IS THIS APPROPRIATE? AND
WHY IT WASN'T DONE WHEN THE WAR MEMORIAL WAS CLOSED
DURING COVID. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE REPAIR AND
IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND, I GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ALREADY
DOES IT MEAN IT WON'T BE OPEN ALL SUMMER RIGHT WHEN WE THINK
WE CAN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND
THAT.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ADAM. WHEN THE WAR


PAGE 22

Jun 1, 2020

MEMORIAL WAS UPDATED, THEY DID PATCHWORK. THE ORIGINAL IS
BACK TO 1955 THAT WE'RE CHANGING HERE. I CAN TURN IT OVER TO
ADAM TO DO SPECIFICS AND TIME FRAMES.
>> ADAM: THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT,
MR. MANAGER. THERE'S TWO ISSUES AT PLAY. ONE IS STRUCTURAL
AND ONE IS MECHANICAL. STRUCTURAL ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE
CONCRETE. THERE IS PATCHWORK DONE TO THAT IN 2007 AND 2010. IT
WAS RELATED TO THE RENOVATION OF THE SCHOOL. AT THE TIME, I
WASN'T HERE SO I COULDN'T SPEAK TO THE ASSESSMENT AND WHY
THEY DIDN'T GO FURTHER. THE PATCHES HAVE USED THEIR USEFUL
LIFE. AND THERE'S ALSO SOME OTHER THAT IS PRESENTED ITSELF
SINCE THEN. IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.
>> CITY MANAGER: WHAT ABOUT THE TIME FRAME? WHEN WILL IT BE
DONE AND OPEN?
>> ADAM: WE ARE LOOKING TO DO THINGS THIS SUMMER. THERE
WILL BE A TIME WHEN WE HAVE TAKE WATER OUT OF THE POOL TO
GET THIS DONE. THE GOAL WOULD BE TO HAVE THIS DONE BY
SEPTEMBER SO IT IS BACK UP AND RUNNING FOR OUR ROBUST SWIM
PROGRAMS IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. COULD YOU ADDRESS THE
TIMING QUESTION, SINCE THE WAR MEMORIAL WAS CLOSED FOR A
WHILE, THIS ASSESSMENT, IN 2019, THE MONEY IS APPROPRIATED, WHY
IT IS NOT DONE BEFORE NOW. TO PUT IT IN PLACE AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE WHILE COVID WAS RESTRICTING SO MANY ACTIVITIES
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER WHEN THERE
WOULD BE A CHANCE IT COULD BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
>> CITY MANAGER: CAN I JUMP IN. I WOULDN'T HAVE CONSTRUCTION
WORK GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING DURING COVID
PROTOCOLS. WHY NOW RATHER THAN LATER? THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE GOT THE NUMBER. THIS IS THE RECOMMENDATION. WE WORKED
WITH ADAM AND ELLEN. IT IS A LOT OF MONEY, BUT THE SCHOOL
GETS ACTIVITY. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN PUT IT UP EARLIER, ADAM.
>> ADAM: PART OF THE ISSUE WAS THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THEY UNDERSTOOD THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE SO THEY DID
ADDITIONAL SAMPLING. WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON WITH THE
SHELTER, AND SOME OF THE STUFF RELATED TO COVID, ON THE CITY
SIDE AND CONTRACTOR SIDE, THIS IS WHEN WE ARRIVED AT WHAT WE
BELIEVE IS THE WHOLE DECISION. WE WANTED TO BE ABSOLUTELY
SURE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YUP. I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK IT IS
IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW AND IT MAKES SENSE GIVEN IT HAS TO
THE SHELTER. AND YET, IT SEEMED ODD FOR US TO DO IT WHEN WE
HOPE TO OPEN UP AN INCREDIBLE RECREATIONAL PLACE FOR THE
CITY. THIS IS A CO GYM FACILITY? CORRECT?
>> ADAM: I'M SORRY?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IT ALLOWS FOR A MORE EFFICIENT ENERGY
>> ADAM: THAT'S NOT THE SCOPE OF THIS WORK.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT WILL CONDITION?
>> ADAM: FOR SURE.


PAGE 23

Jun 1, 2020

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY? ARE YOU THERE?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: SORRY. I WAS ON MUTE. THANK YOU. I
WANT TO THANK THE CITY MANAGER AND THE DEPARTMENT OF
HUMAN SERVICES AND RECREATION FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD. AS
THE STAFF MENTION THE, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO THIS WORK
WHEN WE HAD THE SHELTER AT THE WAR MEMORIAL SITE. TIMING IS
NOT IN OUR HANDS. IT IS GOING FORWARD. I THINK THIS IS AN
ABSOLUTE GEM THAT WE HAVE IN THE CITY. THE MANY PROGRAMS
THAT WE OFFER ED FROM CHILD BIRTH TO YOUNG KIDS TO ALL THE
SENIORS. FOR THE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE RESOURCE. TO HAVE THIS AVAILABLE
AND SHOW THE COMMITMENT THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATION IS
PUTTING FORWARD TO ALL RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, FOR ALL
RESIDENTS FROM AGES, IT IS INCREDIBLE. THIS BUILDING IS IN
EXISTENCE FOR GENERATIONS AND USED BY GENERATIONS FOR MANY
YEARS.
GLAD THE COMMITMENT CONTINUES AND WE'LL MOVE FORWARD
WITH THIS APPROPRIATION TONIGHT. HOPEFULLY THE WORK WILL BE
DONE SOON. AS AN ASIDE, I DON'T KNOW IF THE MAYOR WANTS TO
MENTION (INAUDIBLE) AN OUTDOOR FACILITY WILL FULLY
OPERATIONAL. THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OUTDOOR
POOLS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THANK THE MANAGER AND ELLEN
SEMONOFF AND THE STAFF FOR THE COMMITMENT TO KEEP THE
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE FOR ALL AVAILABLE.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NO OTHER HANDS, ROLL CALL ON THE
APPROPRIATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTING THE ORDER: (ROLL CALL).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.

EXERCISED BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN IN
COUNCIL APRIL, 5, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM SEVEN. (READING
CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 7). PULLED BY VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO PULL THIS ITEM. I MEANT TO PULL NUMBER 8. UNLESS THERE ARE
QUESTIONS FROM THE BODY, I'D MOVE THAT WE VOTE REFER THE
PETITION AND THEN I'D LIKE A MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO
DISCUSS A PREVIOUSLY VOTED ON ITEM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN POTENTIALLY, IF THERE IS A MOTION TO


PAGE 24

Jun 1, 2020

SUSPEND THE RULES, BRING FORWARD CALENDAR ITEM THREE.
COUNCILLOR CARLONE? I SAW YOUR HAND UP?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. I THINK WE CAN JUST REFER THIS TO
PETITION. RIGHT WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING FURTHER?
>> MR. CLERK: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THAT...
>> MR. CLERK: REFERRING THIS COMMUNICATION TO THE PETITION:
(ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 8.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 8).
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: DO WE HAVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO
BRING IT BACK IN FRONT OF US.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. ON THAT, ROLL CALL AND THEN TO THE
ITEM.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO DISCUSS
AN ITEM PREVIOUSLY VOTED ON: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MOVING
SUSPENSION. THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION AT THE
PLANNING BOARD AROUND THE RETAIL TABLE OF LAND USE UPDATE
ON A HOME OCCUPATIONS. AND THE FEELING I GOT FROM THE
OVERALL GOAL FROM THE MEMBERS WAS THE CITY SHOULD BE
REMOVING ALL BARRIERS GIVEN THE DEVASTATION OF THE PAST
YEAR AND COVID 19. THE PLANNING BOARD ADVISE US TO GO MORE
AND SIMPLIFY THE ZONING ORDINANCE BY SAYING FURTHER
CONSOLIDATION OF RETAIL USE TYPES MIGHT HELP ADVANCE THE
GOAL OF ALLOWING MORE RETAIL AND OTHER COMMENTS. AND MY
QUESTION IS FOR CCB, WILL THEY PROVIDE THEM FOR NEXT
WEDNESDAY'S MEETING TO CONSIDER AND ADOPT POTENTIALLY?

CITY MANAGER AGENDA #7

A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to a Planning
Board recommendation to
adopt with comments for
further consideration, Article
8.000 Nonconformity Zoning
Petition.

CITY MANAGER AGENDA #8

A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to a Planning
Board recommendation to
adopt both the Retail Uses
Zoning Petition and the Home
Occupations Zoning Petition,
with comments for further
consideration.

>> THIS IS JEFF ROBERTS, DIRECTOR OF ZONING AND DEVELOPMENT
FILLING IN ON THIS ONE. OUR PLAN FOR THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
HEARING, WE WILL BE BRINGING THE PLANNING BOARD
RECOMMENDATION. THE PETITION AS IT STANDS IS THE VERSION THAT
WAS DISCUSSED BY THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE BACK
IN SEPTEMBER. AND CERTAINLY, IT IS GENERALLY THROUGH MY
PREFERENCE, THEY WORK IN PARALLEL FOR THE ZONING PETITIONS.
WE HAVE STARTED TO LOOK AT THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY
THE PLANNING BOARD AND USUALLY WE LIKE TO INCORPORATE ANY
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MADE BY THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND
PREPARE FINAL VERSIONS OF THE ZONING TO PUT BACK BEFORE THE
COUNCIL FOR ACTION.
CERTAINLY, WE CAN THE PLANNING BOARD COMMENTS WERE
GENERAL IN NATURE. I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT MEMBERS
OF THE COUNCIL THINK ABOUT THOSE POINTS. IF THERE ARE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR DIRECTION PROVIDED BY THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE, WE WOULD WORK TO PUT THEM TOGETHER WITH THE
PLANNING BOARD COMMENTS. WORK WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT
AND INSPECTIONAL SERVICES AS NECESSARY TO PUT ALL THOSE


PAGE 25

Jun 1, 2020

CHANGES IN AND PROVIDE THEM BACK TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
THE ONE THING TO MENTION AND I'M SURE NANCY COULD FILL IN ON
THIS, ANY CHANGES AT THIS POINT WOULD HAVE TO REMAIN WITHIN
THE SCOPE OF THE ORIGINAL PETITION. BUT CERTAINLY IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT IF THE COUNCIL DID WANT TO GO TO PROCEED TO MAKE
ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT WEREN'T IN THE SCOPE OF THIS PETITION,
WE CAN WORK WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT TO PUT TOGETHER A
FOLLOW UP THAT WOULD RESOLVE ANY OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES.
THIS IS A PRETTY THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE TO THE WAY
OUR USERS ARE DEFINED, LISTED AND TREATED. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL
TO TAKE A SWING AT THE BIG ISSUES AND THEN TO TRY TO DEAL WITH
ANY ADDITIONAL ISSUE S EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR AS ISSUES ARISE
OVER TIME.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT, MR. ROBERTS
AND FOR BEING HERE IN MS. FAROOQ'S PLACE. I'M REFERRING TO THE
FURTHER SIMPLIFICATIONS THAT THE PLANNING BOARD HAD
SUGGESTED THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT. I WAS HOPING CDD WOULD
COME FORWARD WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR US TO CONTEMPLATE NEXT
WEDNESDAY RATHER THAN US AT THE TIME. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
TO COME FORWARD WITH SOME TWEAKS AND FURTHER
SIMPLIFICATIONS FOR US TO CONTEMPLATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. I
REALLY WANT TO EXPRESS HOW I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE CHANGE AND
THIS IS A LONG PROCESS AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
COMMITTEE AND THE PLANNING BOARD EXPRESS THAT, THE CHANGES
ARE NOT PERFECT, THEY WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATED FRAMEWORK TO
MAKE FUTURE TWEAKS AND THAT'S PREFERABLE THAN ANOTHER
DRAWN OUT PROCESS. IF WE WANT TO SWING AT THE OTHER BIG
ISSUES THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE PETITION.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE CONVERSATION NEXT WEDNESDAY.
I HOPE CDD CAN BRING US REALLY GOOD INFORMATION AND
REFINEMENTS AND POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS FOR US TO THINK ABOUT
SIMPLIFYING FURTHER. I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE US TO MOVE
FORWARD ON THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS HAS BEEN IN THE
WORKS FOR A REAL LONG TIME. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK
THAT HAS GONE INTO IT FROM CDD, ZONING DEPARTMENT, IT IS A
MONUMENTAL TASK. HOPEFULLY, HERE WE ARE MAKING THE FINAL
TWEAKS AND GET TO THE HOME STRETCH. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE
CONVERSATION NEXT WEDNESDAY. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ROLL CALL
ON REFERRING THIS TO THE PETITION.
>> MR. CLERK: MAYOR SIDDIQUI, NO ACTION ON THE ITEM. THE
COUNCIL ALREADY VOTED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. NO ACTION NEEDED. WE CAN MOVE
FROM THE CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA.
CORRECT?
>> MR. CLERK: CORRECT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO THE CALENDAR. PLEASURE OF THE
CITY COUNCIL? UNFINISHED BUSINESS. WE HAVE THE RELATIVE TO
ZONE ING PETITION AMENDS ARTICLE 8 OF THE CAMBRIDGE ZONING
ORDINANCE. PASSED TO A SECOND READING IN COUNCIL ON MARCH
22. CAN BE ADOPTED TODAY. A MOTION FOR ORDINATION? ON THE


PAGE 26

>> MR. CLERK: ADOPTION OF CALENDAR ITEM 3: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE NOW MOVE TO APPLICATIONS AND
PETITIONS. THERE ARE NONE. MOVING TO COMMUNICATIONS. THERE
ARE TWO. MOTION BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE TO PLACE ON FILE.
ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTIONS. PLEASURE OF THE
CITY COUNCIL? MEMBERS LIKE TO PULL ANY? ON THE MOTION BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTIONS, RESOLUTION 1 10,
ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ADOPTING ON RESOLUTIONS 1 10: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
IF I MAY, TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, SHE MAY HAVE TO GET CLOSER
TO THE MICROPHONE, YOU ARE HARD TO HEAR ON THE VOTES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: OKAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDERS. PLEASURE OF THE
CITY COUNCIL?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: NUMBER 1.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: NUMBER 2.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE A TINY EDIT ON 4. I WILL PULL IT. ANY
OTHERS. ROLL CALL ON 3. WE PULLED 1, 2, AND 4.

CHOICE LAW WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AND IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AT THE HOUSING
COMMITTEE TO REALLY DELVE INTO WHAT IT DOES AND DOESN'T DO
AND HOW IT WILL OR WILL NOT EFFECT DECISIONS THAT COME
BEFORE THE COUNCIL. WE HAD A ZONING PETITION IN FRONT OF US
AND SAID IT WAS UNDER THE NEW HOUSING CHOICE POLICY AND
REQUIRED FIVE VOTES RATHER THAN THE SUPER MAJORITY. WE
SHOULD HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE AND HOW IT AFFECTS ZONING

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. CAN I BE HEARD?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WANT TO SAY, I'M MORE THAN WILLING
AND I'M NOT NOT TO SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUE AND CO CHAIR,
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, I WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT
LOOKING AT A VERY CRAMPED MEETING CALENDAR TO HAVE
SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS SO WE CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION
SOONER THAN LATER. IT IS GOING TO BE PART OF US FINDING TIME ON
THE CALENDAR THAT HAS MUCH DEMAND, BALANCING GETTING
PEOPLE ON THE SCHEDULE. I WILL COMMIT AND I WON'T SPEAK FOR
MY COLLEAGUE, CO CHAIR, GET A MEETING ON THE BOOK AS SOON AS
THIS POSSIBLE WHICH I HOPE IT IS ADOPTED. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS, WE CAN MOVE TO
ADOPT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I REALIZED, I BELIEVE YOU WERE CO
SPONSOR OF THIS POLICY ORDER. IT WAS NOT ENTERED IN THAT WAY.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO ADD MAYOR SIDDIQUI AS A
COSPONSOR TO THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE AMENDED POLICY ORDER?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

POLICY ORDER #1
That the Housing Committee is
requested to schedule a hearing
to discuss the Housing Choice
Law and its potential
implications for housing
projects in Cambridge with
representatives from the
Executive Office of Housing
and Economic Development,
and community housing
organizations.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER TWO.
(READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER 2).
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WILL MAKE A MOTION TO
ADD COUNCILLOR NOLAN AS A COSPONSOR. FIRST I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY
EXPLAIN THIS POLICY. I'M VERY EXCITED TO INTRODUCE THIS GREEN
NEW DEAL ZONING PETITION, WHICH IS POSSIBLY THE FIRST EVER
ATTEMPT TO FUND A JUST ENERGY TRANSITION THROUGH LOCAL
ZONING. WHAT IT DOES, IT CREATES A FRAMEWORK TO OFFSET
LOCALLY EMISSIONS FROM LARGE BUILDINGS, COMMERCIAL
BUILDINGS, BECAUSE WE ARE EXEMPTING HOUSING. AND USE THE
OFFSETS TO CREATE A GREEN JOBS PROGRAM AND TO CREATE
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN
THE COMMUNITY.
THE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ARE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS FOR
BEING THE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THAT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD FOR A
LONG TIME. AND UNDER THE NET ZERO ACTION PLAN, PARTICULARLY
THE LABORATORY BUILDINGS, WILL NOT BE NET ZERO CONSTRUCTION
UNTIL 2030 AT THE EARLIEST. WE HAVE ABOUT A DECADE OF
CONSTRUCTION. IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT, MANY
BUILDINGS WILL CONTINUE TO ADD TO OUR EMISSIONS. WHAT WE'RE
SEEING IS THAT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE NET ZERO ACTION PLAN IN
2016, OUR BUILDING EMISSIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE,
WHICH OF COURSE IS CONTRARY TO THE GOAL, WHICH IS TO
DECREASE OUR EMISSIONS AND TO GET TO ZERO BY 2050.


PAGE 28

Jun 1, 2020

THE KEY HERE IS TO BE INCLUSIVE AND TO BRING OUR LOW INCOME
AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES INTO THIS ENERGY TRANSITION SO
THAT WE ALSO CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY JOB S AS WE
TRANSITION TO RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY.
THAT'S THE VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE POLICY DOES.
OF COURSE, THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS THAT WE'LL DISCUSS AS WE
REVIEW THIS THE GOVERNOR SIGNED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND
THAT WILL PRODUCE A NET ZERO STRETCH CODE THAT WILL ALLOW
US TO BEGIN REQUIRING NET ZERO CONSTRUCTION IN CAMBRIDGE FOR
SMALLER BUILDINGS PER THE ACTION PLAN. WE STILL NEED A
DEFINITION FOR WHAT KINDS OF LOCAL OFFSETS ARE ACCEPTABLE AS
WE TRANSITION TO NET ZERO BUILDINGS. HOPEFULLY, THIS PETITION
WILL CREATE THE BEGINNINGS OF THIS CONVERSATION SO THAT WE
CAN BE READY TO OFFSET THE EMISSIONS GOING FORWARD AS WELL.
AGAIN, THE MOTION IS TO ADD COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN I'D
MAKE A MOTION TO REFER THIS TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE FOR
A HEARING. I'M HAPPY TO HAVE ADD ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE
TO BE A COSPONSOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BEFORE GOING TO THE MOTION, I HAD SEEN
COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S HAND UP, WHO IS A COSPONSOR. I'D LIKE TO
GO TO HIM.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO THANK
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN FOR ALL THE RESEARCH AND IN DEPTH
ANALYSIS HE DID TO PREPARE THIS DRAFT. IT IS SO TRULY NEEDED
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AS I MENTIONED A FEW WEEKS AGO,
EMISSIONS THAT ARE GOING TO OCCUR OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS
ARE GOING TO BE WITH US FOR 100 YEARS. THEY DON'T GO AWAY.
AND THE SOONER WE DEAL WITH THIS, THE BETTER.
I'M GLAD TO BE A COSPONSOR AND I THANK COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
AGAIN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYBODY ELSE BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE
MOTION TO ADD COUNCILLOR NOLAN? ON THE MOTION, WE CAN DO A
ROLL CALL TO ADD COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO OTHER HANDS. I LOOK FORWARD TO
DISCUSSING THIS IN FUTURE MEETINGS AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT
AND IT HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS. ON TO COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN'S MOTION, WE CAN TO DO A ROLL CALL ON REFERRING
THIS TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND PLANNING BOARD FOR
HEARING AND REPORT.

POLICY ORDER #2
That the City Council amend
the Article 22 of the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of
Cambridge entitled
“SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
AND DEVELOPMENT” to
insert a new section 22.24.4

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER THREE. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER THREE).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS
POLICY ORDER I WANT TO MENTION THAT YES IT IS IMPORTANT ON
THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE SPECIFIED, BUT IN THE PAST, GARDEN
STREET, SHEPARD STREET, EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A SPEEDWAY.
AND THEY ARE ALL RELATIVELY WIDE STREETS AND THEY ARE ALL
DEAD STRAIGHT. AND THE SPEED BUMPS, NO RAISED INTERSECTIONS,
THERE'S VERY FEW STOP SIGNS. THOSE EXIST THAT ARE NOT FOLLOW

ED. I BELIEVE ON THE STREETS, LITERALLY WE HAVE TO HAVE A
CAMERA AND TICKET PEOPLE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IN THE END
THAT WE'RE GOING TO STOP THIS. I'M ALL FOR THIS PETITION. I HOPE
THE DIALOGUE IS BROADENED TO BE SPECIFIC STREETS ON ALL THE
EVEN MY STREET, LINIAN AND, WASHINGTON AVENUE. PEOPLE HAVE
ASKED FOR THE SAME THING. IT IS A HILL, BUT PEOPLE SPEED DOWN
THE HILL AT SHOCKING SPEEDS. IT IS A WIDE STREET AND IT IS
STRAIGHT. WE DESIGN THE STREETS TO GO 45 OR 50 MILES PER HOUR.
IT IS A BROAD ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER HANDS, ROLL
CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 4. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 4). THE ONE EDIT, INSTEAD OF BLUE, CHANGE TO RED.
GOING BACK TO THE ORDER ITSELF, IT IS ABOUT RAISING AWARENESS
ABOUT AUTISM. USUALLY IN THE PAST, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
OBSERVE IN PERSON AUTISM ACCEPTANCE DAY. THIS YEAR WE WERE
NOT ABLE TO DO IT IN PERSON, I DON'T THINK LAST YEAR EITHER. WE
WANTED TO AT LEAST LIGHT UP CITY HALL AND MEMBERS HAVE
REACHED OUT FROM THE AUTISM COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE REACHED
OUT TO KIND OF GIVE MORE INFORMATION AROUND WHY THEY ARE
USING RED AS THE COLOR. AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN ALSO
REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT THIS AS WELL.

Mayor Siddiqui moved to
amend the ORDERED
paragraph of Policy Order #4
to replace “blue” with “red”

I WANTED TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING. HE IS WELCOME TO. THAT IS
THE ONLY EDIT I HAVE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR
LEADERSHIP ON THIS. SORRY. I DROPPED MY PHONE. THANK YOU FOR
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. I DID HAVE SOME CONVERSATION
WITH MEMBERS OF THE AUTISTIC COMMUNITY. AND THEY DO HAVE
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE PARTICULARLY THE ORIENTATION
AUTISM SPEAKS THAT LEADS THE CHARGE ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY
YEARS. I DID WANT TO PROPOSE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL
AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THEY RAISED. I WILL SEND
THEM TO THE CLERK AS WELL. THEY PREFER NOT TO BE... REFERRED
TO AS DISORDERED. I SUBSTITUTE THE WORD CONDITION THERE. AND
THEY PREFER TO BE CALLED
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE TO DO MY AMENDMENT FIRST.
CHANGING THAT AND THEN THE REST OF THE AMENDMENTS.
>> MR. CLERK: CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, AMEND THE LAST
PARAGRAPH TO DELETE THE WORD BLUE AND INSERT RED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT: (ROLL CALL) MOTION ADOPTED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MOSTLY THE
AMENDMENTS THAT I'M PROPOSE ARE TO AFFIRM THE COMMUNITY
MOVEMENT MORE. A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE, I THINK, IT IS JUST FROM
THE WAY THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. THERE'S REALLY A
CHANGE HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN AFFIRM


PAGE 30

Jun 1, 2020

THROUGH SOME CHANGES.
I WILL SEND THIS TO THE CLERK. WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK WILSON, YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENT I
WANTED TO CLEAR THE RECORD. MUCH OF THE INFORMATION HERE IS
NOT FROM AUTISM SPEAKS. IT WAS FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE
AROUND AUTISM ACCEPTANCE.
>> MR. CLERK: I DON'T HAVE THEM YET.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THEY SHOULD BE ON THE WAY. THE
OTHER ISSUE I WANT TO RAISE BRIEFLY AS WELL, THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT IS ALSO THEY ARE SELLING SOME PATCHES, I BELIEVE,
THEY ARE IN SUPPORT OF AUTISTIC PEOPLE. THERE'S SOME CONCERN
THAT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IS ALSO STILL BASED ON THE AUTISM
SPEAKS LANGUAGE. I'LL ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY WITH THE
COMMISSIONER. I JUST WANTED TO RAISE THAT POINT AS WELL.
>> MR. CLERK: I HAVE THE AMENDMENTS. YOU SHOULD SEE THEM ON
THE SCREEN. THEY DELETE LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST WHEREAS
PARAGRAPH. DELETES THE SECOND WHEREAS PARAGRAPH. I BELIEVE
BASED ON THE REVIEW, THE THIRD WHEREAS IS THE SAME. AND
MAKES AMENDMENTS TO THE FOURTH WHEREAS PARAGRAPH.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: SO, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, WHEN
YOU TALK ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS, YOU MENTIONED JUST
CHANGING A COUPLE OF WORDS. HERE YOU ARE STRIKING WHY ARE
YOU STRIKING THE WHOLE SECOND WHEREAS?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. PART OF WHAT I WAS
TOLD AND WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IS THAT THERE IS A CONCERN IN THE
SECOND WHEREAS, IT REFERS TO AUTISM AS THE FASTEST GROWING
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT THE
CONDITION HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERDIAGNOSED. AND
NOW PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THEIR DIVERSITY MORE. THERE'S
MORE DIAGNOSIS, BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT IS A
GROWING CONDITION. IT JUST MEANS THERE'S GREATER RECOGNITION
FOR THAT DIVERSITY. MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE SKEPTICAL
ABOUT REFERRING TO IT IN THIS WAY. I FIGURED THAT IT WOULD BE
SIMPLER JUST TO REMOVE THAT WHEREAS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: ALL OF A SUDDEN, I PUT MY CAMERA ON
AND I'M IN THE DARK. HOLD ON. I'M IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION
PROGRAM. MY ONLY THING I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT
OF THIS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF CONVERSATION OR MAYBE
SOME DIFFERENT OPINIONS BETWEEN WHAT DIFFERENT GROUPS
WANT. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU SPOKE TO AND IS THIS A FEW PEOPLE
YOU KNOW WHO ARE NOW WE'RE TAKING OUT WHAT THE CDD SAYS. I
DON'T KNOW HOW ACCURATE IT IS. IT IS WEIRD TO DO THIS ON THE
FLOOR. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS SHOULD BE A
STRAIGHTFORWARD ORDINANCE. WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING
GOOD HERE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR, WE WANT TO I'D
BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE THE HUMAN SERVICE COMMITTEE
MEETING IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT AUTISM IN OUR COMMUNITY. I
DO MY WORK AND WORK WITH A LOT OF KIDS ON THE AUTISM
SPECTRUM. I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SORT OF TRY TO FLUSH
THIS OUT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ON THE FLOOR NEXT TIME. IT IS
WEIRD TO PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DEBATE IN A COMMUNITY THAT


PAGE 31

Jun 1, 2020

WE'RE NOT A PART OF AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS REALLY I DON'T
KNOW WHO I SHOULD LISTEN TO IN THIS. WE HAVEN'T HAD THE
CONVERSATIONS. IT IS AWKWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU THINK YOU HAD
REACHED OUT TO THE MOTION MAKERS ABOUT THE COLOR. WE ARE
SEEING THE AMENDMENTS. THEY COULD HAVE COME EARLIER IN THE
DAY AS WELL. I THINK I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH STRIKING THE
SECOND WHEREAS. IT IS FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT WE ASSESSED
AND REVIEWED. I TAKE THE POINT AROUND CHANGING THE DISORDER
TO CONDITION. AND LEAVING THE REST. AND I THINK LEAVING
YOUR RED ADDITION. YOU HAVE CHANGED. I'M FINE WITH THAT. I
WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN WE CAN GO TO THE
AMENDMENTS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO RAISE MY I
ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE'S THOUGHTS, I'M SORT OF LEANING TO
THE MOTION MAKERS. I DON'T THINK I THINK THE MOTION MAKERS
DID THIS IN GOOD FAITH. MAYBE IS NOT A PERFECT DOCUMENT. I
DIDN'T HEARING ANYTHING ELSE, UNLESS I MISSED IT IN PUBLIC
COMMENT. I TRUST MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THIS IN GOOD FAITH. I
WOULD SORT OF SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES, THE COSPONSORS OF THIS
ORDINANCE. LEAVE IT THE WAY IT IS. I DEPARTMENT FIND ANYTHING
THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME. MY NEPHEW, MY GRAND NEPHEW, IS
AUTISTIC. I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THIS POLICY ORDER. I'M SORRY I
WASN'T ABLE TO JOIN IN AS A CO MAKER BECAUSE IT REALLY IMPACTS
OUR LIFE IN A PERSONAL WAY. I THANK EACH OF YOU FOR BEING
THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE WHOLE IDEA OF
AUTISM SPECTRUM CONDITION/DISORDER. SOMETIMES YOU USE THE
WORDS THAT PEOPLE ARE MOST FAMILIAR WITH. NOT TO INSULT, IT IS
WHAT THEY KNOW. WE BRING PEOPLE ALONG SLOWLY TO THE NEWER
AND MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE OR BROADER NAMING OF THINGS.
I WOULD SAY, I'D BE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS STAYING
EXACTLY AS IT IS WITH THE MINOR CHANGE S YOU LEANED INTO
CHANGING THE COLOR. I THINK THAT IS A CONCESSION. I THANK YOU
FOR THAT. WE JUST HAD THE CITY HALL LIT UP FOR MULTIPLE
MYELOMA MONTH. I HOPE PEOPLE DON'T GET CONFUSED. THE ONLY
THING I WILL ADD, TO USE THE SIGN BOARDS TO EXPLAIN WHY WE DO
THE WONDERFUL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE'RE DOING THEM. IF THE SIGN BOARDS, THE DPW SIGN
BOARDS, I KNOW THEY ARE SCHEDULED FAR IN ADVANCE, IF THERE IS
NOTHING PRESSING THAT SHOULD GO UP, MAYBE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE,
WE ARE LIGHTING UP THE HALL RED IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF... SO
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THE CONNECTION. THANK YOU TO THE CO MAKERS
OF THIS POLICY ORDER ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND SO MANY
OTHER PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILIES ARE TOUCHED BY AUTISM. I
CERTAINLY THANK YOU ON THEIR BEHALF. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, WHOSE HAND IS UP.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE
PROCESS. I DID SPEAK WITH ONE OF THE ADVOCATES OVER THE
WEEKEND AND THEY INDICATED THEY WOULD CONTACT YOU
DIRECTLY. I WASN'T SURE EXACTLY WHAT CHANGES WOULD OR
WOULDN'T BE MADE TO THIS. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECOND WHEREAS. THE INFORMATION AS IT IS


PAGE 32

Jun 1, 2020

CURRENTLY PRESENTED, I GUESS, I'D SUGGEST THAT SINCE THERE'S
SOME CONTROVERSY ABOUT IT THEN, WE DON'T NECESSARY HAVE TO
EXPRESS IT. WE COULD JUST LEAVE IT OUT. I'M JUST HOPING TO MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS TO HELP THE COMMUNITY BE REPRESENTED MORE IN
THE WAY THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE REPRESENTED. I UNDERSTAND IT IS
ALL NEW AND HAVE CHALLENGES TO PROCESS ALL AT ONCE. I'M
GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANGES THAT YOU PROPOSED. I THINK IT IS
IMPORTANT WE DIG DEEPER AND MAKE SOME OF THE OTHER CHANGES
AS WELL TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE HEARD WHAT THE ADVOCATES
ARE ASKING US TO DO.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH CHANGING DISORDERS TO CONDITION. I THINK LANGUAGE IS
EVOLVING AND CHANGING. I THINK IT IS FINE. AND I WAS GOING TO
SAY, ONCE WE SETTLE THIS, I THINK WE SHOULD ADD COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT DOING
THIS. I RECOGNIZE IT IS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. I THINK IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS IN ADVANCE. HAVING BEEN
TO A COUPLE OF CEREMONIES, THEY ARE MOVING, HAVING SPENT
MANY YEARS ON THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE TALKING TO PARENTS WHO
ARE INVOLVED IN HAVING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER RECOGNIZED
IS ARE THESE CHANGES INCLUDING THE COLOR SOMETHING THAT
THE GROUP PARTICULARLY WITHIN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHO
ADVOCATED FOR A LONG TIME ON RECOGNIZING THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SYSTEM CONSULTED?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DIDN'T HEAR FROM THEM DIRECTLY ON THE
COLOR. I HEARD FROM MAYBE TWO ON THE COLOR. BUT NONE ON
THE LANGUAGE ITSELF.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY. I THINK WE RECOGNIZE IT IS
IMPORTANT AND GOOD TO MOVE FORWARD. MY UNDERSTANDING OF
COLOR, IT IS ACTUALLY SOME ARE GOLD, PURPLE, THERE'S A RANGE
THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR AUTISM ACCEPTANCE. MANY PLACES
MAINTAIN THE BLUE ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT STARTED
RECOGNIZING THERE IS SOME PROBLEMATIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH
SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT STARTED THAT. I'M HAPPY TO
SUPPORT THIS. I WANT US TO MOVE FORWARD. I HOPE THE REAL
QUESTION OF US DOING WHAT WE CAN TO ENSURE ACCEPTANCE, WE
CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS BEFORE US ON
THIS THE CLERK SHOWED US. I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THEM UP OR
DOWN. GO FROM THERE. AND WE HAVE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S
MOTION TO ADD COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. WE CAN DO THAT AFTER.
>> MR. CLERK: ON COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S MOTION TO AMEND THE
POLICY ORDER AS SHOWN ON THE SCREEN? (ROLL CALL).
