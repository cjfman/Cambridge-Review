Re:

Policy Order #1 06.26.2023

Policy Order #1 06.26.2023 requests “… an explanation of the legal standard that is used to compel changes or deny projects reviewed by the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions.”
The basic historic preservation law in Massachusetts is the Historic Districts Act, M.G.L. Ch.
40C, which was adopted in 1960 to enable municipalities to establish historic districts within
which the issuance of building permits for publicly visible exterior construction or alterations is
regulated by local historic district commissions. Historic preservation laws have been upheld as
permissible under the inherent authority of the state to regulate, protect, and promote public
health, safety, morals, or general welfare.
The intent of the Historic Districts Act is described in Section 2:
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the educational, cultural, economic and
general welfare of the public through the preservation and protection of the distinctive characteristics of buildings and places significant in the history of the commonwealth and its cities and towns or their architecture, and through the maintenance and improvement of settings for such buildings and places and the encouragement of design compatible therewith.

Section 6 of Ch. 40C establishes regulatory procedures for historic districts:
Except as the ordinance or by-law may otherwise provide in accordance with section eight or said section eight or nine, no building or structure within an historic
district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects exterior architectural
features unless the commission shall first have issued a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship with respect to
such construction or alteration.

Packet Pg. 198

Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the commission shall file with
the commission an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of
non-applicability or a certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as
the commission may reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations,
specifications, material and other information, including in the case of demolition
or removal a statement of the proposed condition and appearance of the property
thereafter, as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the commission to enable
it to make a determination on the application.
No building permit for construction of a building or structure or for alteration of an
exterior architectural feature within an historic district and no demolition permit for
demolition or removal of a building or structure within an historic district shall be
issued by a city or town or any department thereof until the certificate required by
this section has been issued by the commission.

Section 7 specifies the criteria historic district commissions are to employ in evaluating applications for certificates of appropriateness:
In passing upon matters before it the commission shall consider, among other
things, the historic and architectural value and significance of the site, building or
structure, the general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the features involved, and the relation of such features to similar features of buildings and
structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new construction or additions to
existing buildings or structures the commission shall consider the appropriateness
of the size and shape of the building or structure both in relation to the land area
upon which the building or structure is situated and to buildings and structures in
the vicinity, and the commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and
set-back requirements in addition to those required by applicable ordinance or bylaw. When ruling on applications for certificates of appropriateness for solar energy
systems, as defined in section one A of chapter forty A, the commission shall also
consider the policy of the commonwealth to encourage the use of solar energy
systems and to protect solar access. The commission shall not consider interior
arrangements or architectural features not subject to public view.
The commission shall not make any recommendation or requirement except for
the purpose of preventing developments incongruous to the historic aspects or
the architectural characteristics of the surroundings and of the historic district.

The City Council established the Cambridge Historical Commission in 1963 as both an historic
district commission under M.G.L. Ch. 40C and an historical commission under M.G.L. Ch. 40,
Section 8D. The Council designated four historic districts (consolidated into the Old Cambridge
Historic District in 1976) and assigned the commission several additional duties, including historical research and publications, establishment of additional districts, providing advice to other
city boards and departments, and preparation of nominations to the National Register of Historic
Places.
Twenty years later, the City Council enacted Ch. 2.78, Article III of the Cambridge Municipal
Code to enable the Historical Commission to initiate studies for designation of neighborhood
conservation districts and individual buildings as landmarks.
Section 2.78.140 states the purpose of the neighborhood conservation district and landmarks ordinance:

Packet Pg. 199

The City Council finds it necessary to enact this article under Section 6 of the
Home Rule Amendment in order to preserve, conserve and protect the beauty
and heritage of the City and to improve the quality of its environment through
identification, conservation and maintenance of neighborhoods, areas, sites and
structures which constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City; to resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to this purpose; to foster appropriate use and
wider public knowledge and appreciation of such neighborhoods, areas or structures; and by furthering these purposes to promote the public welfare by making
the City a more attractive and desirable place in which to live and work. To
achieve these purposes, the City may designate neighborhood conservation districts and landmarks to be administered as set forth in this article.

For administrative convenience, Article III incorporated by reference several sections of the Historic Districts Act, M.G.L. Ch. 40C. Section 2.78.170 enumerates these:
The Historical Commission and each neighborhood conservation district commission shall have like powers, functions and duties with respect to each landmark
and neighborhood conservation district over which it has jurisdiction as is provided Historic District Commissions under clauses (a) through (g) under Section 10
of Chapter 40C of the General Laws with respect to historic districts, including
without limitation with respect to the approval and disapproval of certificates of
appropriateness, nonapplicability and hardship, the dating and signing of such
certificates, the keeping of records and adoption of rules and regulations, the filing
with the City Clerk and Building Department of certificates and determinations of
disapproval by it, and the determination of designs of appurtenances (excluding
colors) which will meet the requirements of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

Section 2.78.220 of the Cambridge Municipal Code describes the criteria and factors to be considered by commissions when evaluating applications for certificates of appropriateness in
neighborhood conservation districts and landmarks:
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic
and architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of
such features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case
of new construction or additions to existing structures a commission shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both in relation
to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in the vicinity, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the
zoning ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural features not subject to public view.

B. A Commission shall not make any recommendation or requirement except for
the purpose of preventing developments incongruous to the historic aspects, architectural significance or the distinctive character of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

historic districts, and designated landmarks) and the three neighborhood conservation district
commissions have issued thousands of Certificates of Appropriateness since the adoption of Ch.
2.78, Article III in 1983. While many determinations have involved negotiation and an amendment of proposed projects, outright denials are rare. No major new construction project has ever
been fully blocked under the authority of this Article, but some have been modified to receive
approval.
•

The Cambridge Historical Commission has received 5,069 applications for properties under its jurisdiction over a 60-year period. Forty-five (0.89%) were denied. Twenty-one of
the denials involved landmarks or properties in the Harvard Square Conservation District;
two of these were major construction projects that were subsequently approved in a different form. All other denials involved additions, minor alterations, signs, cell phone antennas. and the like.

•

The Mid Cambridge NCD Commission has processed 6,693 applications since 1985. The
Commission has recorded denials of 101 applications over 37 years, but 92 of these were
non-binding decisions involving siding or inappropriate window replacement and the applicants were able to proceed as they wished at the conclusion of the review. The nine
binding applications that were denied involved properties listed on the National Register.
Eight denied applications were for alterations and one was for demolition and replacement with a new building.

•

The Avon Hill NCD Commission has processed 800 applications since 1999. Seven applications (0.88%) have been denied. Two of these cases involved garages and five inappropriate window replacement.

•

The Half Crown-Marsh NCD Commission has received 589 applications since 2007.
Eleven (1.9%) have been denied; three of these were modified and subsequently approved. Six denied cases involved fences.

Spreadsheets documenting denied applications are available on request.
Finally, applicants aggrieved by a finding of an NCD commission may appeal to the Cambridge
Historical Commission. Cambridge Historical Commission decisions can be appealed to the Superior Court.

Re:

Response to Proposed Amendments to Ch. 2.78, Art. III [Updated 8.7.23]

On August 7, the City Council will consider a number of proposed amendments to Ch. 2.78, Art
III of the Cambridge Municipal Code, the Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCD) and
Landmarks Ordinance. Council Order O-1 of 6/26/23 requests a review of the proposed
amended ordinance language.
The amendments originated with a citizens’ petition filed in May, 2021 that was refiled in
somewhat amended form at the beginning of the present Council term. I have submitted several
memos analyzing the petition, some provisions of which were opposed by the Historical
Commission, and proposed amendments intended to make the NCD and landmark designation
process more efficient and effective.
Law Department and CHC staff attended several Ordinance Committee hearings and CHC staff
have participated in informal sessions of stakeholders convened by Councillors McGovern and
Zondervan. The outcome of those discussions is reflected in a document prepared by the City
Clerk titled “Attachment D Final Clean Version of 2.78 for August 7”.
With two exceptions, the amendments contained in Attachment D are acceptable to the
Commission. These both appear in Section 2.78.220, “Factors considered by Commissions.”
Section 2.78.220, paragraph A describes the factors to be considered by the Historical
Commission and NCD commissions in evaluating requests for certificates of appropriateness. It
also authorizes commissions to make determinations about dimensions and setbacks that may be
more restrictive than permitted by zoning. The paragraph in its entirety presently reads as
follows:
In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic
and architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general

design, arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the
relation of such features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area.
In the case of new construction or additions to existing structures a commission
shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both in
relation to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in
the vicinity, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional
and setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision
of the zoning ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements
or architectural features not subject to public view.
The proposed language contains two amendments objectionable to the Historical Commission.
The proposed amended version of this paragraph reads as follows:
In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic
and architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of
such features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case
of new construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the
size and shape of the structure, and a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to
those required by applicable provision of the zoning ordinance. A Commission
shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural features not subject to
public view (emphasis added).
The first amendment to this paragraph would prohibit commissions from considering “the
appropriateness of the size and shape of additions and new buildings.” The ability of
commissions to consider such features is fundamental to their mission. A commission
prohibited from reviewing the size and shape of new construction cannot adequately protect
properties that the City Council has designated under this ordinance.
The second amendment would eliminate a commission’s ability to “impose dimensional and
setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance.” This provision of the Ordinance tracks a similar provision of M.G.L. Ch. 40C, the
Historic Districts Act. Although rarely used, it is an important regulatory tool and its loss
would weaken commissions’ ability to negotiate appropriate outcomes.
In addition, the Law Department recommends against adoption of the following underlined
amendment to Section 2.78.160, paragraph B:
Members shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diversity of
residents within and surrounding the district. Such members shall serve for a term
of three years, except that the initial appointments shall be for one member to
serve one year and one member to serve two years, and vacancies shall be filled
for the unexpired term of office. No member shall serve more than two
consecutive terms. Each member and alternate may continue in office for up to six
months after expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly appointed and
qualified. The City Manager may extend an appointment by another six months if
no such duly appointed and qualified successor has been appointed at the point of

expiration, provided the City Council votes to approve the extension (emphasis
added).
The Law Department comments that this provision may result in a situation where there are not
enough members to vote on an application. Normally, after a member's term expires a member is
in holdover status which is a legal status that allows the member to continue to take action until a
new member is appointed. This provision eliminates the possibility that members can serve in
holdover status and could result in vacant positions. If there are not enough members to vote on
an application, an application can be constructively approved by operation of law, pursuant to the
procedures in G.L. c.40C, §11, that are incorporated into Chapter 2.78. The Law Department
recommends removing this language to avoid that possibility. The following existing provision
of the Ordinance should remain in place:
Each member and alternate shall continue in office after expiration of his or her
term until a successor is duly appointed and qualified, except that no member
shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
The attached document contains several redlined editorial revisions that I do not consider
controversial and restores in part the original language of Section 2.78.160, paragraph B, and
Section 2.78.220, paragraph A.
The text has been reviewed by the Law Department, which considers that the amendments before
the Council constitute issues of policy rather than law.

2.78.140 Purpose.
The City Council finds it necessary to enact this article under Section 6 of the Home Rule
Amendment in order to preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of the City; to
improve the quality of its built environment through identification, conservation and
maintenance of neighborhoods, areas, sites and structures which constitute or reflect distinctive
features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic, racial, or social history of the City; to
foster appropriate use and wider public knowledge and appreciation of such neighborhoods,
areas or structures; to welcome a diverse set of residents and broaden appreciation for individuals
with marginalized identities who have shaped Cambridge’s history; and by furthering these
purposes in balance with other City priorities such as affordable housing construction,
environmental sustainability, and accessibility to promote the public welfare by making the City
a more attractive, desirable, affordable, diverse, equitable, accessible, and inclusive place in
which to live and work. To achieve these purposes, the City may designate neighborhood
conservation districts and landmarks to be administered as set forth in this article.

2.78.160 Neighborhood conservation district commission—Established—
Membership requirements.
A.

Upon designation as provided in Section 2.78.180 of this article of any neighborhood
conservation district, and unless the designation provides that the Historical
Commission itself shall exercise authority with respect thereto, the City Manager
shall appoint a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission to consist of seven
members and three alternates who shall by reason of experience or education have
demonstrable knowledge and concern for improvement, conservation, and
enhancement of the district, and whose composition represents the diversity of the
designated neighborhood in terms of age, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual
orientation, and property ownership or tenancy. Appointments shall reflect the City’s
goals for anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Members and alternates must
have the ability to work and interact effectively with individuals and groups with a
variety of identities, cultures, backgrounds, and ideologies. The membership shall be
as follows:
Member 1. District homeowner
Member 2. District renter
Member 3. District resident
Member 4. District resident
Member 5. District business operator/owner or District resident
Member 6. Historical Commission member/CHC alternate or Cambridge
resident

Member 7. Cambridge resident with professional qualifications
Alternate 1. District resident
Alternate 2. District resident
Alternate 3. District resident
The district business operator/owner seat shall be occupied by someone who owns or
operates a business within the district that is not a formula business as defined in
Article 2.000 of the Zoning Ordinance, or a representative of a business association
within the district. The City Manager shall prioritize applicants representing retail
establishments, local service establishments, or restaurants that employ no more than
50 full-time equivalent employees. The requirement to seat a district business
operator/owner shall not apply when a district does not contain any portion of a
commercial district or when the City Manager is unable to fill the seat after an
exhaustive search. Whenever the requirement does not apply, the seat shall be filled
by a district resident.
The position for a Cambridge resident with professional qualifications shall be
occupied by someone who possesses training or experience in historical preservation,
architecture, and/or a similar field. Three years after establishment of the district the
requirement that one member be a member or alternate of the Historical Commission
shall cease and a district resident shall be appointed to that position. Under no other
circumstance may an individual serve at once on both the Historical Commission and
a NCDC.
The Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall act solely in the
exercise of those functions described in this article which are applicable to the
district under its administration.
B.

C.

Members shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diversity of
residents within and surrounding the district. Such members shall serve for a term of
three years, except that the initial appointments shall be for one member to serve one
year and one member to serve two years, and vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired term of office. No member shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
Each member and alternate may continue in office for up to six months after
expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly appointed and qualified. The
City Manager may extend an appointment by another six months if no such duly
appointed and qualified successor has been appointed at the point of expiration,
provided the City Council votes to approve the extension. Each member and alternate
shall continue in office after expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly
appointed and qualified, except that no member shall serve more than two
consecutive terms.
The Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and study committees shall
elect annually a Chair and Vice-Chair from its their own number. In the case of
absence, inability to act, or unwillingness to act because of self-interest on the part of
a member, their place shall be taken by an alternate member designated by the Chair,
if available, otherwise by the Vice-Chair if available, otherwise by a majority vote of
the members and alternate members of the Commission present. The person
exercising the function of Executive Director of the Historical Commission or his or

Commission. Persons serving as members or alternate members of a Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall, as a result of such service, be considered as
"special municipal employees" for purposes of Chapter 268A of the General Laws.

2.78.170 Powers and duties.
A.
The Historical Commission and each Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall have like powers, functions and duties with respect to each landmark
and neighborhood conservation district over which it has jurisdiction as is provided
Historic District Commissions under clauses (a) through (g) under Section 10 of Chapter
40C of the General Laws with respect to historic districts, including without limitation
with respect to the approval and disapproval of certificates of appropriateness, nonapplicability and hardship, the dating and signing of such certificates, the keeping of
records and adoption of rules and regulations, the filing with the City Clerk and Building
Department of certificates and determinations of disapproval by it, and the determination
of designs of appurtenances (excluding colors) which will meet the requirements of the
landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

2.78.180 Designation procedures.
A. The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a
landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or
object which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more
historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political,
economic or social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or
architecturally significant (in terms of period, style, method of construction or association
with a famous architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of
structures; may recommend for designation as a neighborhood conservation district any
area within the City containing places and structures which it determines are of
importance to the architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of
the City, and which considered together cause such area to constitute a distinctive
neighborhood or to have a distinctive character in terms of its exterior features; and may
recommend amendments to any designation of landmark or neighborhood conservation
district theretofore made.
B. Prior to the recommendation of designation or amendment of designation of any
landmark or neighborhood conservation district an investigation and report on the
historical, architectural and other relevant significance thereof shall be made. The
report shall recommend the boundaries of any proposed landmark or neighborhood
conservation district and shall recommend for incorporation in the order of the City
Council designating each landmark or neighborhood conservation district general
and/or specific standards and appropriate criteria consistent with the purposes of this
article and the provisions of Section 2.78.190 of this article that are to be applied in
making any determination of the type referred to in Sections 2.78.170, 2.78.210 and
2.78.220 of this article, with respect to the designated landmark or within the
designated neighborhood conservation district.
C. In the case of a landmark, preparation of the report shall be directed by the Historical
Commission. In the case of a neighborhood conservation district, preparation of the report
shall be directed by a study committee consisting of three members or alternates of the

reason of experience or education have demonstrable knowledge and concern for
improvement, conservation, and enhancement of the district, and whose composition
represents the diversity of the neighborhood itself in terms of age, race, ethnicity, gender
identity, sexual orientation, and property ownership or tenancy. Appointments shall reflect
the City’s goals for antiracism, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Members must have the
ability to work and interact effectively with individuals and groups with a variety of

2.000 of the Zoning Ordinance, or a representative of a business association within the
district. The City Manager shall prioritize applicants representing retail establishments,
local service establishments, or restaurants that employ no more than 50 full-time
equivalent employees. The requirement to seat a district business operator/owner shall
not apply when a district does not contain any portion of a commercial district or when
the City Manager is unable to fill the seat after an exhaustive search. Whenever the
requirement does not apply, the seat shall be filled by a district resident.
D. Any thirty registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission
initiate, or the Historical Commission on its own may initiate, the process of designating
a landmark or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore made. Any one
hundred registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission initiate
the process of designating a neighborhood conservation district or amending or
rescinding any such designation theretofore made. The Commission shall within sixty
days following the filing of such request or petition hold a preliminary hearing and
arrange for the preparation of a report and, if required, request the appointment of a study
committee. In the event the Historical Commission requests the appointment of a study
committee, the approval of the formation of such committee shall be by order of the City
Council. If a petition for a landmark designation is not accepted by the Historical
Commission or a request to initiate a study of a neighborhood conservation district is not
recommended by the Historical Commission or approved by the City Council, the
Historical Commission shall not reconsider a proposed designation, amendment or
rescission of designation within two years of its previous hearing thereon. No later than
sixty days after the transmittal of a report to the Commission pertaining to a proposed
designation, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The Commission shall give not

landmark and to every registered voter and property owner abutting the proposed
landmark or within the proposed neighborhood conservation district, each such voter and
owner to be determined from the then current records of the Assessing Department and
Election Commission, and to the City Manager, the Planning Board and the City Clerk.
E. Prior to the public hearing, the Commission shall transmit copies of the report to the
Planning Board for its consideration and recommendations.
F. The recommendation of the Historical Commission with regard to any designation,
amendment or rescission shall be transmitted to the City Manager and to the City Clerk
with a copy of the approved designation report. When making recommendations
pertaining to Neighborhood Conservation Districts only, the Historical Commission shall
include in their report information on the impact of the designation on housing and
renovation costs in the district. The Historical Commission shall obtain and include a
letter from each business association within, or within 500 yards of, the proposed district
setting out their views on the proposed district, or they shall otherwise provide a
statement that no response was received. The Historical Commission shall include each
written public comment that was properly received during the Study Committee process.
The Historical Commission shall provide a review of current and available academic and
industry research on the price effects of historical preservation districting and shall
provide a written summary of that research and relevant citations as part of the report.
Designation of a landmark or a neighborhood conservation district or amendment or
rescission of designation shall be by order of the City Council. In the case of a
designation, the order shall include a statement of the reasons for such designation and a
statement of standards which the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation
District Commission is to apply under Sections 2.78.170 and 2.78.190 through 2.78.220
of this article.
G. No designation, amendment or rescission of designation shall become effective until a
map setting forth the boundaries of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district or
change in the boundaries thereof, has been filed with the City Council and has been
recorded with the Registry of Deeds for the South District of Middlesex County.
H. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district contains
provisions for both regulatory and educational/incentive programs, the regulatory
provisions of the order shall not be effective unless and until the educational/incentive
provisions of the order are funded.
I. Following acceptance of a landmark designation petition by the Historical Commission, no
application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises of a
property being considered for landmark designation shall be granted until reviewed by the
Commission as though the property were designated as a landmark under this Article III.
Beginning with the acceptance of a designation petition or a vote to initiate a landmark
designation study and until (a) the Historical Commission makes a negative
recommendation on a proposed designation, (b) the City Council determines not to enact
the proposed designation, or (c) one year has elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission
shall review all proposed construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior
architectural features, other than color, of the structures on the premises of a proposed

landmark. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction over issuance of building permits in
a neighborhood conservation district study area except in the case of properties that are
already designated as landmarks or protected by a preservation restriction or with regard
to applications to demolish buildings pursuant to Ch. 2.78.Article II.
J. Notwithstanding the prior provisions of this section 2.78.180, a neighborhood
conservation district previously established by order of the City Council, in accordance
with this section, which order instructs that there be a review of the activities of the
Neighborhood Conservation District Commission established pursuant to that order,
following one or more public hearings by such Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission and by the Historical Commission, and a report to the City Council by
such commissions containing a summary of testimony at such hearings and
recommendations by such commissions for amendments to the powers, responsibilities
and procedures of such Neighborhood Conservation District Commission (including
amendments to the boundaries of the affected neighborhood conservation district), may
be amended by the City Council, in a manner consistent with the recommendations of
such report, or be rescinded without the necessity of the appointment of a new study
committee or of a de novo study process.

2.78.190 Review procedures.
A. Except as the order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation
district may otherwise provide in accordance with this article, the Historical Commission
or Neighborhood Conservation District Commission having jurisdiction shall review all
construction, demolition or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other
than color, ADA compliance features, accessibility features, climate resiliency features,
or renewable energy features of any landmark or within any neighborhood conservation
district.
B. The order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation district may
provide that the authority of the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation
District Commission having jurisdiction shall not extend to the review of one or more of
the following categories of structures or exterior architectural features of the landmark or
within the neighborhood conservation district in which event the structures or exterior
architectural features so excluded may be constructed or altered without review by the
Commission:
1. The application of exterior wall material in a manner that does not require the
removal or enclosure of any cornice, fascia, soffit, bay, porch, hood, window
or door casing, or any other protruding decorative element;
2. Alterations to the exterior of existing structures that do not increase or diminish
the size and location of windows and doors, cause the removal of any bay,
porch, hood, window or door casing or any other protruding decorative
element, or alter the appearance of a roof;
3. The exterior appearance of a new structure that does not require a variance or
special permit under the zoning ordinance then in effect;
4. Signs, temporary structures, lawn statuary, or recreational equipment, subject
to such conditions as to duration of use, dimension, location, lighting,
removal and similar matters as the Commission may reasonably specify;

5. Terraces, walks, driveways, sidewalks and similar structures substantially at
grade level;
6. Walls and fences;
7. Storm doors and windows, screens, window air conditioners, lighting fixtures,
antennae, trellis work and similar appurtenances.
C. The Historical Commission or a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission may
determine from time to time after a public hearing that certain categories of exterior
architectural features or structures, including, without limitation, any of those enumerated
in this section, if the provisions of the applicable order do not limit the authority of such
commission with respect thereto, may be constructed or altered without review by such
commission without causing substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this
article.
D. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district provides, the
determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall be binding
only with regard to applications to construct a new building, to demolish an existing
structure if a demolition permit is required, to construct a parking lot as a principal use,
and to construct an addition to an existing structure that would increase its gross floor
area, and in all other cases the determinations of a commission shall be advisory only and
not binding on an applicant. In no case shall a building permit be issued until the
commission has made a determination under the applicable provisions of this article.
E. A determination of the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission with regard to an application to construct a residential building in which a
majority of the units are permanently reserved for households at or below 100% of area
median income through the Affordable Housing Overlay or any other means on the
premises of a designated landmark shall be advisory only and not binding on the
applicant.
F. Applications for temporary accessibility features shall be granted Temporary Certificates
of Hardship for the length of the ownership or tenancy of the disabled applicant. Such
certificates shall be issued through administrative procedures within one business day. A
determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard to an
application to construct permanent accessibility features shall be advisory only and not
binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical Commission with regard to an
application to construct such permanent features on the premises of a designated
landmark shall be binding, but the Commission shall not in any case deny all accessibility
improvements necessary to comply with provisions of the Americans With Disabilities
Act and relevant Massachusetts statutes.
G. A determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard to an
application to construct climate resiliency and renewable energy features shall be
advisory only and not binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical
Commission with regard to an application to construct such features on the premises of a
designated landmark shall be binding but not unreasonably denied.

district may otherwise provide, no structure designated a landmark or within a
neighborhood conservation district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects
exterior architectural features unless the Historical Commission or Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission having jurisdiction shall first have issued a certificate
of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship with
respect to such construction or alteration.
B. Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the Historical Commission or
Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall file with the Commission an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a
certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as the commission may
reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations, specifications, material and
other information, including in the case of demolition or removal a statement of the
proposed condition and appearance of the property thereafter, as may be reasonably
deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a determination on the
application.
C. No building permit for alteration of an exterior architectural feature of a landmark or
construction of a structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature within a
neighborhood conservation district and no demolition permit for demolition or removal
of a landmark or of a structure within a neighborhood conservation district shall be
issued by the City or any department thereof until the certificate required by this article
has been issued by the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission having jurisdiction.
D. This provision does not apply to proposals for, or existing, affordable housing that either
is developed under the Affordable Housing Overlay, as defined in Section 11.207 of the
Zoning Ordinance, or has a majority of units permanently reserved for households at or
below 100% of Area Median Income, in a neighborhood conservation district, over which no
neighborhood conservation district commission has jurisdiction. The Historical Commission
shall have only advisory jurisdiction with regard to such affordable housing.

2.78.220 Factors considered by Commissions.
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall consider, among other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new
construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure,
and a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not impose dimensional and
setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance. In the case of new construction or additions to existing structures a
commission shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both
in relation to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in the
vicinity, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback
requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural

features not subject to public view.
B. A Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not make any recommendation
or requirement except for the purpose of preventing proposals incongruous to the
historic aspects, architectural significance or the distinctive character of the landmark or
neighborhood conservation district.
C. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall also consider community goals as may from time
to time be expressed by the City Council, including the need to provide additional
housing, affordable and otherwise, and to promote the sustainable use of energy and
capacity for climate resilience.

2.78.270 Enforcement and remedies.
The Historical Commission and any Neighborhood Conservation District Commission are each
specifically authorized to institute any and all actions, proceedings in law and in equity, as it
deems necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this article or to
prevent a threatened violation thereof. Any violation of any provision of this article may be
punished to the like extent provided in Section 13 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws for a
violation of said Chapter 40C. In addition to the foregoing, no building permit shall be issued,
with respect to any premises upon which a landmark or a structure within any neighborhood
conservation district has been voluntarily demolished otherwise than pursuant to a certificate
granted after compliance with the provisions of this article, for a period of two years after the
date of the completion of such demolition (the word "premises" for the purposes of this sentence
referring to the parcel of land upon which the demolished structure was located and all adjoining

Cannabis Amendments Zoning Petition

To the Honorable, the City Council,
Following the Ordinance Committee hearing on June 27, City staff have
completed additional technical review of the draft zoning language before the
City Council to remove the special permit requirement for Cannabis Retail uses
throughout the City (the “Petition”).
Attached for the Council’s consideration is an updated draft with an additional
change made to Section 11.803.1.b. The reference in this section to maintaining
an Economic Empowerment Applicant and/or Social Equity Applicant
certification by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission is amended to
generally state that such designation and/or certification shall be maintained,
rather than stating that it shall be made a condition of a special permit. For this
portion of the package, the recommendation is to substitute the attached
language to the Petition prior to passing the Petition to a second reading.
In addition to this change, City staff have developed proposed amendments to
the City’s Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance in order to improve
consistency and clarity in the Business Permit and Host Community Agreement
process.
Staff have identified a conflict between the Zoning Ordinance and the Cannabis
Business permitting Ordinance in the language which defines the criteria for
being designated as a Social Equity Applicant. The Zoning Ordinance identifies
this as “… applicants that have been designated as Economic Empowerment
Applicants or certified as eligible to participate in the Social Equity Program by
the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission...” whereas the Cannabis
Business Permitting Ordinance identifies Social Equity applicants as also being
Cambridge residents.
We recommend that the Cambridge residency requirement be removed from
Social Equity status in the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance. To date,
none of the Social Equity applicants whose applications are in process or who
have inquired about the process are Cambridge residents.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of a grant in the amount of $735,939 from the U. S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the HOME Program to the Public Investment Fund
Community Development Extraordinary Expenditures account ($662,346) and to the Grant Fund
Community Development Salary & Wages account ($73,593).
HUD established the HOME program in 1990 to financially assist municipalities in expanding their
supply of decent, safe and affordable housing. For FY2024, HUD awarded $735,939 to the City of
Cambridge. HOME funds are administered by the Community Development Department which
implements projects and programs written in the City’s One Year Action Plan and Five-Year
Consolidated Plan which are mandated by HUD.
Development activities may include acquisition, moderate rehabilitation, substantial rehabilitation and
new construction of housing units for low- and moderate- income families and individuals. The majority
of the HOME funds, $662,346 will be used towards those activities; and $73,593 will be used for the
Community Development Department’s administration of the HOME program. This appropriation will
continue the development and rehabilitation of affordable housing in the City of Cambridge.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
This is in response to City Council Awaiting Report No. 20-53, dated October 19, 2020, attached hereto,
which requests that the City Manager work with the relevant City departments on how Cambridge might
participate in the Massachusetts Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy Program (“PACE”)
pursuant to G.L. c. 23M, including exploring all options for incentivizing participation.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency (“Mass
Development”), has established a program in which owners of commercial and industrial properties, as
well as residential properties of five or more units, can procure financing for various sustainable energy
improvements to their building under the PACE program. Qualifying properties procure a loan from a
lender registered with Mass Development, and a lien is placed upon the property in the form of a
betterment. The City would handle the collection of the semi-annual payments for the loan, and transfer
the monthly payments to Mass Development. Any liens for City water, sewer and property taxes are
ahead of the PACE lien for energy improvements.
After consultation with the Finance, Assessing, Community Development and Law Departments, we
believe that implementation of the PACE Massachusetts program in Cambridge is feasible. As of May of
2023, 65 municipalities in Massachusetts are participating in the PACE program. The PACE program
could be useful to provide financing for both properties subject to the BEUDO ordinance amendments
and those voluntarily undertaking energy efficiency or other decarbonization projects in order to reduce
energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
PACE is intended to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements which reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from building operations. The availability of energy financing is an ongoing
challenge and PACE would provide a new option for Cambridge property owners.
Property owners may choose to access PACE financing because:
•
•
•
•
•

Energy upgrades reduce operating costs for buildings.
Loans can be 100% upfront.
Loans ride with the property, not the owner, and can be transferred with the property
when sold.
Loan terms can be up to 20 years, enabling projects with longer paybacks that other
financing does not allow. Commercial energy loans typically run 7 to 10 years at most.
Non-profit entities can secure financing that is difficult to obtain elsewhere.

Packet Pg. 245

1.15

•

It is possible for PACE financing to be considered “off balance sheet.” Since PACE is
seen as being in a category similar to property taxes, the financing could be viewed as
an annual expense, rather than a long-term obligation. This could help limit constraints
on other financing that a property may wish to undertake.

I am recommending that the City Council vote to accept Massachusetts General Law Chapter 23M, which
is a state law which requires a majority vote of the City Council to participate in the PACE program. As
such, I have attached hereto a proposed order authorizing the City to participate in the PACE
Massachusetts program.

Project Update: Central Square Municipal Property Needs Assessment
and Planning Study

The Community Development Department (CDD), in collaboration with other City
departments and the Cambridge community, is working on a municipal property needs
assessment and planning study for city-owned properties in Central Square. As noted in
our response to policy orders provided in November 2022, there are significant
demands on City-owned properties. These include affordable housing, public gathering
space, infrastructure needs, arts and cultural amenities, human services space,
community facilities, and municipal functions and municipal office space. The purpose
of this study is to understand the full range of needs to meet the City’s programmatic
and service goals and analyze how existing municipal properties and facilities can
accommodate those needs.
The majority of underdeveloped and/or underutilized municipal properties are located
in Central Square and include both buildings and vacant lots, including land. Some, such
as 35 Cherry Street, with planned future uses; others have greater flexibility. The study
will focus on properties that could be redeveloped for different or greater intensity of
uses. The map below identifies the area for the needs assessment and planning study
(the Project), including the focus properties.

Project Scope and Progress
The City hired Agency Landscape + Planning, a planning and design firm based in
Cambridge, to assist with this study. Together with interdepartmental staff led by CDD,
the team is scoped with assessing and recommending future uses of municipal
properties as described below:
1. Research and Analysis
In June, the team started conducting research on the municipal properties.
Research includes a review of the site history, current building use and conditions,
and applicable zoning and other land use controls. The team also looked at
existing plans and studies, including Envision Cambridge, Central Square Planning
Study, Resilient Cambridge, the Open Space Needs Assessment, report of the
Mayor’s Arts Task Force, Addressing Homelessness in Cambridge report, and the
Red Ribbon Commission Report to understand the wide range of district,
neighborhood and citywide needs.
The team also conducted an inventory of existing parking and utilization.
Specifically, the team conducted parking utilization surveys on different days and
at different times of day to assess current demand. This will be used to
understand how present and future parking needs can be met in conjunction with
future redevelopment of surface parking lots.
2. Needs Assessment and Goal Setting
The planning team also conducted detailed interviews with City staff familiar with
the focus properties and Central Square projects in the pipeline to gather detailed
information about their current use, condition, and potential opportunities and
challenges. The interviewees include staff from CDD, Public Works, Capital
Buildings, Traffic, Parking, and Transportation, Department of Human Services
Programs, Cambridge Public Library, the City Manager’s Office, and the Cambridge
Redevelopment Authority.
The team is currently finalizing its community engagement plan. Community
engagement will commence in late summer and run through the fall. Community
engagement is intended to ensure that community members are updated and
included to meaningfully inform the needs assessment, goals, and
recommendations for municipal properties. Engagement will focus on hearing
from historically excluded, underserved, and underrepresented communities. The
team will partner with CDD’s Community Engagement Team (CET) to reach out to
underheard communities in Cambridge and the diverse people who live, work,
visit, worship, and learn in Central Square. This will include the American-born
Black community, immigrant communities, seniors, youth, and other underheard
communities. The following is an overview of the plan’s different engagement
strategies:
• Community meetings and workshops
• Surveying & tabling “pop-up” events;
o Setting up a table at farmers markets, local events and festivals,
community facilities such as Starlight Square, libraries, youth centers,
and parks

Online survey
Meetings & focus groups:
o Attending existing group meetings and creating dedicated focus groups
to reach underheard communities. Appropriate groups for engagement
may include but are not limited to the Central Square BID, Starlight
representatives, Central Square Advisory Committee, the Community
Learning Center, the Citywide Senior Center, youth centers, communitybased organizations, interfaith community, and neighborhood groups
City Council Updates
Additional Outreach as Needed

Equitable and inclusive community engagement will give a holistic perspective on
community needs, priorities, and goals. Learnings from community engagement,
along with input from city staff, will inform the needs assessment and inform
future redevelopment.
3. Planning Recommendations
This stage of the plan will develop recommendations for the future use of
municipal properties based on analysis, needs assessment, and continued
community engagement.
The team will develop concept plans and development test fits to demonstrate
how desired program elements can be accommodated on existing sites and
buildings. They will also identify opportunities for public realm improvements,
new development, and adaptive reuse projects.
Draft recommendations will be presented to the community and City Council to
receive feedback prior to a final report. At the end of the process, the team will
prepare final deliverables summarizing the entire process, findings, and
recommendations.
Project Status and Working Schedule
The project is proceeding on schedule. The team has completed its first two months of
work, which included project start-up and early data gathering, site analysis, and city
staff interviews. The community engagement phase will start later in August and
continue through the end of the project. The Project is scheduled to be completed in
December 2023.

2023 Affordable Housing Overlay Annual Report

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Per the requirements of Section 11.207.11 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, we
are pleased to submit the 2023 Annual Report of the Affordable Housing Overlay
(AHO) which provides a summary of affordable housing development activity under
the AHO.
The Ordinance requires that the annual report include the following:
(1) A list of sites considered for affordable housing development under the AHO, to
the extent known by CDD, including:
• Developer name;
• Site location;
• Actions taken to initiate an AHO project;
• Site status.
(2) A description of each AHO project underway or completed, including:
• Developer name;
• Site location;
• Number of units;
• Unit types/number of bedrooms;
• AHO project status;
• Number of residents served by AHO project;
• Tenure.
As summarized in the attached report, a total of 16 sites are under active review for
potential development under the Affordable Housing Overlay including 13 new sites
first evaluated in 2023 and 3 sites reported last year which continue to be under
review (See Table-1 & Table-2 in the excel sheet). There are currently six AHO
developments with a total of 616 units actively underway (See Table-3).
Four of the AHO projects (Jefferson Park Federal, 52 New Street, 49 Sixth Street, and
116 Norfolk Street) have completed both the AHO community process and the AHO
Advisory Design Review process. Construction began at 116 Norfolk Street in
December 2022. We expect that 52 New Street and Jefferson Park Federal will begin
construction in the coming months, and 49 Sixth Street will begin construction in
early 2024 once all funding has been committed.

Jefferson Park Federal involves the comprehensive redevelopment of a former
public housing development to result in 278 new affordable rental units. The 52
New Street development involves the new construction of 106 affordable rental
units on a site adjacent to Danehy Park. The 49 Sixth Street development involves
the conversion and historic reuse of a portion of the Sacred Heart property in East
Cambridge into 46 affordable rental units. The 116 Norfolk Street development
involves the historic renovation and expansion and conversion of an existing
building of single-room-occupancy (SRO) units to 62 new studio units for individuals
transitioning out of homelessness.
The fifth AHO project, Walden Square Phase 2, has restarted its AHO Community
Process after a redesign and will begin the Advisory Design Review process when its
community process is complete. The sixth AHO project, 1627 Massachusetts
Avenue, involves the historic preservation and conversion of an existing building
into affordable housing and the creation of new affordable housing in a rear
addition. The 1627 Mass Ave development has completed the AHO community
process and began the Planning Board Advisory Design process in July 2023.
The attached report lists the sites which have been evaluated as potential AHO
developments, to the extent known by CDD staff. However, the list does not include
other sites, such as existing multi-family buildings, which were assessed during this
time period as potential opportunities to create affordable housing through means
other than the AHO zoning provisions.
We are pleased that there are six active AHO developments underway which
together will create 616 affordable units, and we will continue to work with
affordable housing providers to identify, assess, and secure additional sites for
development under the AHO provisions.

August 7, 2023
To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report #23-42 from June 5, 2023 regarding irrigation systems at Danehy
Park, the Department of Public Works and the Department of Human Service Programs provide
the following update:
Capital Planning for Danehy Park
There is a need for a fresh look at Danehy as a facility, as the original construction, including the
irrigation system, is 30-years old. The City has contracted with a landscape consultant team for
planning services to develop a Capital Improvement Plan for Danehy Park to guide the future of
the park in the next 10-20 years.
Capital Plan Goals
The goal of the Capital Improvement Plan is for Danehy Park to be an exceptional public park
that the citizens of Cambridge will continue to be proud of and cherish. It will be planned and
designed with the intent of making an extraordinary contribution to the improved quality of life,
health and wellness of its surrounding neighborhoods and the entire City. The Capital
Improvement Plan will:
• Complement the essential natural, historic, and visual character of the site.
• Be based on a strong inclusive public engagement process that prioritizes outreach to
traditionally underrepresented groups and informs the park design and creates long-term
support of the community.
• Integrate ecological design and natural resource management that protects the site’s
natural systems while offering visitor experiences in these environments for enrichment,
education, health and wellness outcomes.
• Incorporate measures from the City’s recent resilience focused planning efforts to protect
from, and mitigate, future flooding and heat impacts due to climate change.
• Offer a variety of choices for people of all ages, backgrounds and interests who will
want to come to the park for relaxation, respite, play, exercise or to connect with other
people.
• Evaluate the condition and quality of the parks’ features and systems and propose a
series of distinct projects / phased improvements (with cost estimates) to inform future
capital planning. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Landscape and Ecology
Utilities: drainage, water, electrical, irrigation, etc.
Bicycle and pedestrian access into and through the park
Accessibility (park was constructed prior to ADA / MMAAB regulations)
Play: opportunities for multi-generational play as well as traditional fields and tot
lots

The plan will be developed with the context of Danehy Park being a former landfill and where
additional environmental control measures may need to be incorporated within the facility.
Schedule
The Capital Planning process will begin in the winter of 2023 and take approximately 12 months
to complete.
Current Status of Irrigation System and Short-to Medium Term Improvements
Due to the overall age of the irrigation system, the operation and maintenance of the system is a
challenge and requires both short-term and longer-term improvements.
• In response to the serious irrigation challenges in 2022, immediate repairs were made.
Several lines, irrigation heads and the pump that failed last year contributing to the loss
of 12 trees have been replaced and are functioning. 120 trees are currently planned for
planting once DEP approves excavation in the park. Fifty-five trees were also added
during the construction of the Louis DePasquale Playground.
• The Spring 2023 system turn on went reasonably well, but there were some additional
repairs identified that are being addressed. The park is currently being irrigated by four
systems and supplemental hand watering in some limited areas. See below for the list of
completed and on-going improvements.
• As part of the Capital Planning process, we are prioritizing the evaluation of the
condition of the irrigation system. Staff anticipate coming to City Council for a fall
appropriation to fund the Capital Improvement Plan, irrigation system improvements
(including redundancy between zones and/or system back up measures), Field Turf 4,
and the Track & Throwing Area. Additional capital funding requests are expected in
future years to implement other recommendations from the Capital Improvement Plan.
Completed Improvements to the Irrigation System
In addition to the routine repair of heads and lines associated with the typical spring startup,
irrigation specialists have been deployed to assess and address the following issues:
•

St. Peter’s Fields (System 1):
Several heads, valves and lines were repaired this spring and the system is serving the
needs of our baseball and softball field. Our irrigation specialists are working to restore a
line in Roethlisberger Park behind the Softball Field on Garden Street. Staff monitor this
area and provide surface irrigation as needed.

•

Pump System Near Sherman St. Entrance (System 2):
The pump that was installed in 2022 was removed for storage over the winter and DHSP
worked with the Water Department to reinstall in Spring 2023. A line break was
Packet Pg. 274

1.19

discovered recently along the main path by the Miyawaki Forest which is being repaired
by an outside contractor. The pump and system are functioning and keeping the
Miyawaki Forest irrigated.
•

Irrigation System Near New Street Entrance (System 3):
In Spring 2023, we experienced wiring issues in System 3. The Cambridge Electrical
Department identified and replaced several defective parts and staff are able to operate
the system manually and run it for the designated times. The irrigation specialists on site
are identifying solutions to address the wiring in this system, which would eliminate the
need for staff to operate the system manually.
The irrigation main that was cut during construction work on New St has been assessed.
This area will be included in the scope of our larger evaluation, but the contractor we
currently have deployed is also trouble shooting interim solutions. Surface irrigation is
available presently, and park staff are monitoring and watering this area as needed.

•

Louis D. Pasquale Universal Design Playground (System 4):
A leak was discovered after the system start-up in the spring of 2023. This has impacted
the waterplay and a portion of the irrigation system. The leak was able to be isolated, and
the waterplay is currently in use and all irrigation has been restored. Danehy Staff
watered portions of this park as needed, while the contractor worked to increase the
functionality of the system. The contractor is currently working to fix the isolated leak
and the manufacturer will be replacing several sensors.

Irrigation systems have engineering complexities and underground failures that must be
managed; in addition to cross-departmental efforts made to ensure the best possible response to
the needs of all of the City’s parks, there are dedicated maintenance funds and resources for
professional and technical services that are used for on call repair services and seasonal openings
and closures that the city contracts for to ensure the care for our parks. In addition to these
operating funds, staff anticipate coming to City Council for a fall appropriation to fund the
Capital Improvement Plan, irrigation system improvements (including redundancy between
zones and/or system back up measures), Field Turf 4, and the Track & Throwing Area.
Additional capital funding requests are expected in future years to implement other
recommendations from the Capital Improvement Plan.

1.21.a

Packet Pg. 280

Overview
At the direction of the Cambridge Police Commissioner, consistent with a Policy Order of
the Cambridge City Council, PERF examined the Cambridge Police Department’s (CPD) decision
to withhold the involved officer’s name from the public in the wake of the fatal shooting of Arif
Sayed Faisal on January 4, 2023. PERF was also asked to make policy recommendations to CPD
for releasing involved officers’ names moving forward. CPD welcomed and was fully engaged in
the process.
After examining the applicable law, professional rules, and CPD policy, PERF concludes:
-

-

CPD could have — legally and ethically — released the officer’s name during the
weeks after the shooting.
Its decision not to do so was based on CPD’s past practices, the statewide practices
of law enforcement agencies in Massachusetts, and the absence of a relevant CPD
policy.
CPD’s ability to release the officer’s name changed when the judge overseeing the
inquest into the matter ordered that no information could be shared publicly until
the inquest is complete; from that point on, CPD could no longer provide the
officer’s name (or any other information) to the public.

Below, PERF presents the relevant procedural history of this incident, analyzes various
rationales law enforcement agencies sometimes cite for withholding an involved officer’s name
from the public and offers policy guidance moving forward.

Background
As of the date of this report, an inquest into the circumstances of the fatal shooting has
not yet concluded; PERF will not receive police reports about the incident until the inquest is
complete. Therefore, the basic facts mentioned in this report are based on consistent news
accounts.
On January 4, 2023, a CPD officer shot and killed Arif Sayed Faisal, a 20-year-old college
student experiencing an apparent mental-health-related issue. The shooting took place after
Mr. Faisal — who had reportedly jumped through a glass window and was cutting himself —
refused to drop a long knife and advanced toward officers.1 That incident sparked unrest and
demands for transparency by community members.2
Two factors unique to the city of Cambridge (“the city”) and its police department
significantly affected the public response to the incident. First, CPD does not have a body-worn

camera (BWC) program, so there was no video of the incident to release to the public.3 It
appears that the current and previous CPD Commissioners, as well as the CPD union and some
Cambridge city councilors, have supported implementing a BWC program for years, but there
was resistance from others in city government as well as some city residents.4 This tragic
incident has reinvigorated the push for BWCs, and CPD recently took the proactive step of
sending a member of its executive staff to a national meeting focused on BWC best practices.5
The other factor complicating CPD’s response to the incident – and leading to public
frustration - reflects that this was the first officer-involved CPD fatality in more than two
decades. Therefore, the general order governing CPD’s response had not been updated to
reflect some modern transparency trends. Specifically, CPD had no policy language about
whether and when to release the shooting officer’s name.
Not having a policy on name release distinguishes CPD from other national law
enforcement agencies that have implemented such a policy,6 but the same cannot be said of
law enforcement in Massachusetts. While it’s possible that other police agencies in the state
proactively release involved officers’ names within days of fatal critical incidents, PERF was not
able to identify any. This likely presents an opportunity for CPD to be a leader in the state.

CPD Actions Concerning Release of Shooting Officer’s Name
At the time of the fatal shooting, CPD’s policy governing officer-involved shootings had
not been updated since 2008, and its only reference to the release of an officer’s name occurred
in the context of how officers could guard against telephone harassment if their names were
somehow released to the public:
“In order to protect against crank or abusive calls, officers should be advised to
have phone calls answered by another person for several days if their names
are released to the public.”7
Because CPD had no policy requiring the release of the officer’s name within a specified
time frame - or prohibiting it - CPD was free from the inception to make its own choice about
whether to release the shooting officer’s name. When CPD decided not to release the name in
the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the public was left wondering why CPD did not
disclose information that other agencies routinely release expeditiously.
For instance, a 2016 PERF review of agencies in the Washington, DC area found that
even then, many departments had updated their policies to provide for the expedited release

of an involved officer’s name after a critical incident. These included: Anne Arundel County
(MD) Police Department – within 24 hours; Baltimore (MD) Police Department – within 48
hours; Howard County (MD) Police Department – “As quickly as possible”; Montgomery County
(MD) Police Department – within 24 hours; Prince George’s County (MD) Police Department –
within 24 hours; and Prince William County (VA) Police Department – within three to five days.
PERF determined that CPD withheld the officer’s name based on past practice within the
department (concerning non-fatal incidents and other acts of potential misconduct), as well as
the current practice of other Massachusetts law enforcement agencies. Those factors, as well as
a belief that it was not permitted to release the name without the express consent of the local
prosecutor, rather than a desire to keep information hidden from the public, steered CPD’s
response in the weeks after the shooting.
After the local prosecutor announced an inquest8 (a practice authorized in
Massachusetts in which a judge investigates the circumstances of a death to determine
whether a crime took place),9 CPD informed PERF that it was not releasing the officer’s name
because, according to the local prosecutor, the judge presiding over the inquest had issued an
order directing that no entity could release information about the incident until the inquest was
complete.10
To be sure, the judge’s order precludes CPD from releasing the name until the inquest is
complete. But as noted above, nothing in law or policy automatically prevented CPD from
releasing the name before the judge issued that order.
On May 15, 2023, the Cambridge City Manager, consistent with a City Council Policy
Order, requested that CPD work with PERF to establish a policy on the release of the names of
officers involved in any use of force incident resulting in injury or death, “including
retroactively.”11

Rationales for Withholding Names
To prevent confusion about these issues as CPD develops its new policy, this section
addresses some rationales law enforcement agencies cite when withholding officers’ names
from the public. Going forward, CPD should begin with the presumption that it will release the
officer’s name within a specific period of time, and then thoughtfully consider whether reasons
exist that would legitimately and in good faith justify withholding it from the public.

PERF also reviewed a press release issued by the Middlesex District Attorney on February 23, 2023, indicating
that by order of the Court, no further details would be provided about the incident until the inquest process had
been completed.

Public Records Law Exemptions
Every state including Massachusetts,12 as well as the federal government, has a publicrecords-access law (i.e., freedom of information or sunshine law). Public access laws stand for
the principle that records of public entities, including police agencies, are assumed to be
available to the public unless a specific exemption exists that allows the record to be wholly or
partially withheld.13 Absent such an exemption, the records, and information contained in them
(such as an officer’s name) are public.
In terms of police agencies and officer-involved shootings, proactively releasing
information that the public would be entitled to know by virtue of the state’s public access
law is an act of good faith that reinforces public trust. But as noted above, there are
exemptions to public access and agencies generally invoke one of the following to avoid
releasing an officer’s name after an officer-involved shooting.
i. Pending Investigation
Public records laws generally contain some type of “pending investigation” exemption.
However, the fact that a matter is pending investigation, by itself, does not justify the blanket
denial of all information about the incident until the underlying investigation is complete.
Instead, most agencies can legitimately withhold information about a pending investigation only
if its release would interfere with the pending investigation itself or law enforcement’s ability to
function in general.
The Massachusetts Public Record Law is no different. Investigatory materials are defined
as materials:
“… compiled out of the public view by law enforcement or other investigatory
officials the disclosure of which … would probably so prejudice the possibility of
effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public
interest.”14
According to the Massachusetts Supreme Court, police officers occupy positions of “special
public trust” that favor transparency of public records about them.15 It would therefore be a
heavy burden to show that releasing an officer’s name, standing alone, would run so counter to
public interest that withholding it would be justified by the Public Records Law.

Absent a good-faith reason why releasing an officer’s name would prejudice CPD’s ability
to conduct its work effectively, CPD should release involved officers’ names proactively moving
forward. (See the “Policy Recommendations” section below for specifics.)
ii. Safety of the Officer
The Massachusetts Public Records Law, like other public access laws, also contains an
exemption allowing agencies to withhold records (and information within them) if release
would endanger or threaten a person or persons’ safety.16 After critical incidents, police
agencies have occasionally withheld officers’ names on this basis as well.
PERF does not minimize the importance of officer safety, especially in the highly charged
environment that can follow critical incidents. But blanket denials based on safety, with no
corresponding threat assessment, are hollow. As detailed below in the Policy
Recommendations, PERF believes that moving forward, CPD should engage in safety
assessments after critical incidents and, in the absence of specific threats that would justify
withholding the names, release them within a pre-determined time frame, after informing the
officer and implementing safety provisions.
In reviewing these Public Records Law exemptions, PERF does not suggest that in any
given case, these or other exemptions could not be validly invoked to withhold an officer’s
name or other information. The point, rather, is that invoking an exemption as a blanket
rationale to avoid public release, without corresponding facts that support that action, runs
counter to principles of transparency and can erode public trust.
Rules of Professional Conduct
At some point prior to the judge’s order, CPD advised PERF of its belief that it could not
release the officer’s name according to the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. Those
rules govern attorney conduct but can affect law enforcement indirectly. Specifically, Rule
3.8(f)(2) requires that prosecutors “take reasonable steps to prevent … law enforcement
personnel” from making statements that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making. But
again, in this case, the release of the officer’s name would not have violated the Rules of
Professional Conduct.
According to Rule 3.8, prosecutors (and members of law enforcement working with
them) shall refrain from making statements “that have a substantial likelihood of heightening
public condemnation of the accused” or “materially prejudicing” a proceeding.17 In other words,
it is incumbent on the prosecutor and law enforcement to refrain from making statements that
would be expected to prejudice public opinion against a person accused of a crime or,
presumably, a person against whom a criminal charge is possible.

These rules are no different from those promulgated by President Obama’s Task Force on
21st-Century Policing, which called for increased transparency when law enforcement agencies
communicate with the public after critical incidents.18 The Task Force recommended that
information be released early and updated regularly if it could be done “without compromising
the integrity of the investigation or anyone’s rights.”
Unless CPD can, in good faith, after consultation with the prosecutor, articulate why
releasing the name of the officer in a critical incident would prejudice public opinion such that
the officer’s rights are affected, or show that release of the name would credibly compromise
the investigation, PERF recommends that the agency proactively release it going forward.
In this case, the public knew early on that an officer fired a weapon and killed a man. It is
difficult to imagine how replacing “an officer” with the officer’s name might have prejudiced the
outcome of the investigation.
The Commonwealth’s Right of Privacy Statute
Massachusetts law provides, “A person shall have a right against unreasonable,
substantial or serious interference with [that person’s] privacy.”19 Violation of the statute occurs
when “facts of a highly personal or intimate nature” are disclosed about a person, “with no
legitimate reason for doing so.”20
Here, the information that the CPD is considering releasing about officers, following
critical incidents, is their names – not their addresses, private medical information, or any
personal or intimate details about their lives. As noted above, the Massachusetts Supreme
Court has held that police officers occupy positions of trust that lean in favor of transparency
regarding their records.21 And, far from having no legitimate interest in releasing the name, CPD
and the city have a very compelling reason to do so – being transparent with the public they
serve.
Accordingly, it does not appear that Massachusetts’s Privacy Statute provides a
justification to automatically withhold an officer’s name from the public after a critical incident.
Summary
The statutes and rules highlighted above allow agencies to delay the release of
information, or withhold it altogether, under certain circumstances; they should not be used as
blanket justifications to keep information from the public. As detailed below, PERF recommends
that CPD make determinations about whether to release information - such as the officer’s

name in a critical incident – on a case-by-case basis, and after thoughtful deliberation, with a
presumption that the information will be made public.

Policy Recommendations
The new critical incident policy that CPD is drafting will greatly assist the agency, the
public, and officers, by establishing consistent timelines and clear expectations. The policy
should specify that the release of information such as an officer’s name, will take place within
prescribed timeframes — subject to relevant legal and professional standards, including the
Massachusetts Public Records Law and Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct.
PERF recommends that the Cambridge Police Commissioner, in consultation with
appropriate staff and the prosecuting authority, should assume that certain information will be
released to the public unless a legitimate, good-faith reason exists to withhold it. PERF
recommends that CPD’s new policy include language capturing the principles below:
1. Unless a specific, articulable, good-faith reason exists not to do so, within 24-36
hours of an officer-involved critical incident CPD should publicly disclose:
- Preliminary facts about the incident, including, at a minimum, where and when
it took place and the number of people injured or deceased.
- Preliminary information about the officer(s) involved, such as length of time as
an officer and length of time with CPD (if the officer transferred from another
agency), rank, assignment, prior uses of force, and status (e.g., modified
assignment or leave pending the investigative outcome.)
- An estimated time frame for how and when further information will be
released, including the officer’s name.
• CPD policy should specify that the agency will begin its threat assessment
to determine whether a credible risk to officer safety exists during this
time.
• CPD must consider and begin to address officer wellness during this time
(see #2 below).
The above principles balance the public’s desire for information with the CPD’s need
to consult with staff and the prosecuting authority to identify whether any genuine
issues exist that conflict with the presumption of information release. They also
present a timeframe within which CPD must begin its threat assessment and provide
the public and the involved officer with its good-faith expectation about when the
name will be (presumptively) released.
2. CPD should, within two to five days of an officer-involved critical incident, publicly
disclose the name of the involved officer(s) unless circumstances exist that justify
not releasing that information.

-

This two-to-five-day period allows CPD to conduct a meaningful threat
assessment.
If the assessment reveals no credible threat to safety, CPD should release the
name within two days. If there are genuine threat indicators, the assessment
should continue. And if, after five days, a credible risk persists, the officer’s name
may be legitimately withheld for as long as the risk remains. CPD should,
however, communicate why it is withholding the name from the public. And if
the threat abates, the name should be released.
If circumstances other than officer safety justify withholding the officer’s name
(and this will generally be rare) CPD should broadly communicate that to the
public (e.g., “Release would impede CPD’s ability to conduct this [or other]
investigation(s).”). CPD should also be prepared to defend that justification after
the investigation is complete.
Before an officer’s name is released publicly, CPD must ensure that the involved
officer has been notified and given access to departmental services. These
include mental health assistance, peer support, and a full explanation of the
officer’s rights.

Conclusion
The issue of whether and when CPD should have released the involved officer’s name in
this fatal incident ultimately stemmed from the lack of a clear protocol and will be mitigated
once CPD updates its policy.
Notwithstanding the lack of policy, if, after examining the issues outlined above, CPD had
chosen to release the officer’s name, it could have legitimately done so — until the judge issued
the order directing that no information could be shared until the inquest was complete. As of
this writing, the inquest is continuing.
CPD is an agency that has, over time, demonstrated leadership in several key areas of
reform, including juvenile diversion programs,22 and trauma-informed police practices.23 CPD
now appears poised to lead the state of Massachusetts in developing a policy to release officers’
names after critical incidents.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Council Order No. O-8 of February 10, 2020, which is attached hereto for your
reference, the City has inquired as to the possibility of acquiring the property at 450 Concord
Avenue, owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (“Commonwealth”) and utilized by the
National Guard Armory of Cambridge, adjacent to the Tobin School. The Commonwealth is
unwilling to sell the entire parcel to the City, but has expressed interest in selling a portion of the
property. The portion of the property consists of 30,752 square feet of the Armory property that
is adjacent to the Callanan Fields and Tobin School (“Property”), as shown on the attached map
as “Parcel B”. Currently the Property is used for military purposes by the Commonwealth. The
Property could be used to expand the sports fields, create school learning areas, and increase
open space and walking paths near the Tobin School and Callanan Fields. The City has obtained
an appraisal showing the value of the Property to be $5,380,000.00.
In order for the City to purchase of the Property, the Commonwealth requires that a special act
be passed allowing the Commonwealth to dispose of the Property and for it to be sold to the
City. The Commonwealth has proposed legislation allowing the Commissioner of Capital Asset
and Maintenance to convey the Property to the City in an amount to be determined by an
independent professional appraiser, which will be paid for by the City. A copy of the proposed
legislation, which has been reviewed and edited by City staff, is attached hereto.
I request that the City Council vote to allow the City Clerk to transmit the proposed legislation to
the City’s legislative delegation for passage before the legislature. If the legislation and
independent appraisal are approved, then I will bring the proposal before the City Council to
approve the purchase under the terms offered by the Commonwealth.

bicycle lanes, which began in 2004 with the installation of the city’s first separated
bike lane, and accelerated in 2016 with the introduction of quickbuild separated bicycle
lanes; and

WHEREAS:

It is crucial to ensure that the study utilizes accurate, objective, and reliable data from
before and after installation to assess the positive or negative economic impacts on
businesses from separated bicycle lane installations; and

WHEREAS:

The goal is to improve the implementation of separated bicycle lane projects so that
positive impacts on local businesses are enhanced and negative impacts are avoided or
mitigated; now therefore be it

Packet Pg. 303

2.1

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consider the following measures
to enhance the aforementioned business impact study:
1. Prioritize the utilization of objective data sources on economic impact over
subjective or survey-based data sources: (a) Partner with the state revenue
agency to conduct sales tax data analysis, avoiding privacy issues; (b) Obtain
transaction or business utilization data from third-party vendors; (c) Examine
the long-term impacts on vacancy rates and rent prices on earlier bike lane
projects, including Cambridge St, Brattle St, Western Ave, and earlier
segments of Mass Ave, avoiding potential distortions caused by the pandemic;
2. To the extent that subjective or survey-based data sources are used, work to
minimize statistical bias (anchoring bias, reporting bias, etc.): (a) Consult with
a working group of experts, such as quantitative social scientists and policy
evaluation researchers from local academic institutions, to ensure the
utilization of best practices; (b) Measure customer perceptions and preferences
for the retail environment through customer intercept surveys; (c) Consult with
business staff to understand and assess their priorities, preferences, and
concerns, in addition to consultations with business owners;
3. In addition to measuring impacts, aggregate ideas for how to improve the
implementation of separated bicycle lanes along commercial corridors to
enhance the business environment: (a) If surveys are conducted, solicit broader
feedback regarding ways to improve the implementation and operation of bike
lane projects, potential mitigations for regions with newly implemented bike
lanes, and curb-use management strategies, including loading, short-term/longterm parking, and outdoor dining; (b) Estimate the potential impacts of
changes to parking policies and dynamic meter pricing to ensure sufficient
parking availability;
and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
these matters by September 1, 2023, outlining the proposed improvements to the
business impact study for separated bicycle lanes, including the incorporation of
objective data sources, collaboration with external partners, and strategies for gathering
feedback and ideas from businesses.

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR CARLONE
WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that the Philippine Human Rights Act
(PHRA) has been reintroduced in the US House of Representatives as H.R. 1433, but a
companion bill has yet to be filed in the US Senate; and

WHEREAS:

PHRA seeks to suspend all security (military) funding and sales from the US to
the Philippines until such time that the human rights crisis in the Philippines has
been properly addressed, including by (but not limited to):
• Investigating and prosecuting members of the military and police forces
who are credibly found to have violated human rights
• Withdrawing the military from domestic policy
• Establishing protections of the rights of trade unionists, journalists,
human rights defenders, indigenous persons, small farmers, LGBTQ+
activists, and critics of the government
• Taking steps to guarantee a judicial system that is capable of
investigating, prosecuting, and bringing to justice members of the police
and military who have committed human rights abuses
• Fully complying with any and all audits or investigations regarding the
improper use of security aid; and

WHEREAS:

Since 2016, the Philippines has been undergoing a national human rights crisis,
precipitated by former President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal Drug War, involving ExtraJudicial Killings (EJKs) of over 30,000 people, including urban poor, farmers,
peasants, indigenous, environmental activists, and government critics, and others
purported to be involved in drug activity; and

WHEREAS:

Other Human Rights Violations in the Philippines, largely attributed to the
government, include: forced disappearances, torture, red-tagging of civilians and
activists, silencing of the freedom of expression and the press, and state violence and
theft against indigenous peoples; and

WHEREAS:

These human rights abuses are often committed by the Philippine National
Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which receive
taxpayer-funded financial assistance from the U.S., and it is estimated that
6,242 individuals were killed by the PNP and the Philippine Drug Enforcement
Agency in anti-drug operations from July 1, 2016, to May 31, 2022 in addition
to the 30,000 EJKs; and

Packet Pg. 306

2.2

WHEREAS:

Very few “drug war” killings have been investigated by Philippine authorities, only a
handful of cases—12 out of thousands—are in varying stages of investigation by
police or active review by prosecutors, and to date, there is only one case, the videorecorded murder of 17-year-old student Kian delos Santos in August 2017, which
resulted in the conviction of police officers; and

WHEREAS:

Current President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has maintained that he will
continue the War on Drugs, the regime no longer reports on killings by government
actors, and killings by the PNP and AFP have continued under his regime with over 90
drug-related killings since Marcos took office in September 2022; and

WHEREAS:

Marcos Jr. has maintained the Philippines’ withdrawal from the International Criminal
Court (ICC) and will not cooperate with the ICC’s investigation into the Crimes
Against Humanity during the previous Presidential Administration between 2016 and
2022; and

WHEREAS:

Marcos Jr. is the son of the former President and dictator of the Philippines, Ferdinand
Marcos Sr., who enacted Martial Law in the Philippines between September 1972 and
January 1981 and committed egregious human rights violations including amassing a
private fortune of US $10 billion by plundering from the Filipino people during his
time as president; and

WHEREAS:

The U.S. has given over US $1.14 billion in military assistance to the Philippines since
2015, which means that U.S. taxpayer dollars have contributed extensively to human
rights violations in the Philippines; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in enthusiastic support of H.R.1433, the Philippine
Human Rights Act, and in urging Representatives Katherine Clark and Ayanna
Pressley to co-sponsor the existing bill; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in urging Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth
Warren to file a companion bill to H.R.1433 in the US Senate; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of
this resolution to Cambridge’s entire Congressional Delegation on behalf of the entire
City Council.

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR TONER
WHEREAS:

The City Council is currently working towards establishing a more aggressive timeline
to implement our BEUDO requirements, which would mandate that the majority of
buildings falling under the scope of this ordinance would need to fully comply by
2035, rather than 2050; and

WHEREAS:

Over the course of many months of hearings and public discussions on this matter, it
has become clear that for some, it will be a confusing and potentially costly process to
fully comply with this more aggressive timeline, and it would be prudent for the City
to find tangible ways to assist residents in meeting that goal; and

WHEREAS:

One such method would be to establish a BEUDO Compliance Advisory Board, which
– similar to the Implementation Advisory Committee that was established to assist
businesses comply with the smoking ban enacted two decades ago – would be
available to advise residents on how to best adapt to the new law, how to better
understand the law, how to troubleshoot areas of concern, and to otherwise assist
residents who may be in need of greater, more comprehensive support throughout the
process; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to
establish a BEUDO Compliance Advisory Board designed to meet the above stated
goals of assisting residents with complying with the forthcoming adjusted BEUDO
timeline, and to report back to the City Council on progress made towards this goal at
the August 7, 2023 City Council meeting.

Tonight's BEUDO Amendments

Dear City Councilors:
I greatly appreciate your support thus far for the effective set of amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance.
As a concerned parent living in this city of booming development our shared climate concern remains a daunting
concern. Our city should continue to be doing everything it can to reduce greenhouse emissions swiftly and equitably.
We need all the support presently available at the state and national levels; we need to push our building owners,
especially institutional buildings, to do their part.
Please speak for our many concerned citizens, myself included, that you pass a final version of the BEUDO amendments
that is adequate and strong.
One specific suggested modification to tonight's amendments is the inclusion of a 2030 Net Zero target for new large
lab, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these could undermine the
greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to
bring about.
My Sincere Appreciation,

Subject: Support strong BEUDO amendments

Dear City Councillors:

I have heard from some of my older jaded neighbors that cambridge will always go where the money is and
defer to large labs, medical facilities and research buildings allowing them special passes in exchange for
doing business here. I want to prove my neighbors wrong about the leaders of this great city.
Please represent my voice, and the voice of so many residents who believe we can be a leader and have hope
for a livable climate for all children. Pass a final version of the BEUDO amendments that is strong, vigorous,
and adequate to the urgency at hand.
One specific possible modification to the amendments that I support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target
for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these
buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.
Thank you so much for your support thus far for a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO).

Please pass the "BEUDO amendments" motion

Dear Members of the Cambridge City Council:
I want to thank you for your efforts to establish legislation that, when implemented, will
have Cambridge acting to halt climate change. I am grateful for what you have done so
far.
Now, as I understand things, the “BEUDO amendments” motion will come before the
Council on Monday, June 26. I most strongly urge you to pass the motion, taking
us one step along the way in efforts to block climate change.
A part of my focus on climate change is concern for my children and grandchildren and
their generations. Yet, the damage of climate change is not simply something that will
happen in the future. The impacts are already upon us, as can be seen from news
reports each day. And, aside from those major events – hurricanes, fires, etc. – that
appear in the news, the extensive damage to people’s health from climate change is
becoming increasingly apparent. Cambridge and others must act now!
Please do not allow the motion to be delayed with excessive new amendments or
counterproductive actions. Of course, the “BEUDO amendments” motion is not perfect,
but it is good, good enough to be moved forward. Please do not let it get bogged down.
Cambridge must move ahead on combating climate change!
Thanks.

Policy Order #5

Dear Councilors,

I write concerning PO#5 which prescribes in extraordinary detail a study to determine the economic
impact on businesses of your plans for separated bike lanes through major commercial areas. I was
under the impression that your body had already executed a contract with the Volpe Center to study the
same issue by this Fall.

As a citizen who feels steamrolled by the juggernaut adoption and implementation of the CSO, I am also
confused by the aforementioned policy order. Many Cambridge residents have been calling for
transparency and accountability regarding the CSO implementation. Then it appeared that the Volpe
study was one small step in the right direction. But now, it appears that the council
is preparing to make the implementation of the Volpe study more difficult if not impossible with the
introduction of PO#5. It is completely unclear how this new PO inter-relates with or effects the Volpe
study.

I strongly urge the council to stop this chaotic and confusing direction and to let the Volpe study
proceed. Please vote against PO#5.

Thank you,
Barbara Anthony

Support strong BEUDO amendments

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you so much for your support of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO).
As a parent and grandparent, the climate crisis is a palpable reality to me. I want my city to be doing everything
it can to reduce greenhouse emissions swiftly and equitably
We can draw on all the support now available at the state and national levels. In addition, we must push our
building owners, including, importantly, institutional ones, to be doing their part.
Please represent my voice, and the voice of so many residents, and pass a final version of the BEUDO
amendments that is strong, vigorous, and adequate to the urgency at hand.
One specific possible modification to the amendments that I support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target
for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these
buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.

Support for Strong BEUDO Amendments

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you so much for your support for a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO)! I believe that what you are doing is historic, and nationally important. Although
Cambridge is not the only city in the country setting greenhouse gas emissions standards for buildings (New
York City, Boston, San Francisco, Washington D.C. and St. Louis are examples), Cambridge’s BEUDO will
have some of the earliest compliance dates. This reflects the true urgency of the climate crisis!
I appreciate the work that CDD staff and the Council have done to move the BEUDO amendments forward!
The refinements to the use of Verified Carbon Credits are great – they will allow some flexibility while meeting
real carbon reduction goals as locally as possible.
I urge you to continue to push our large building owners, especially the institutional ones, to do their part. Is it
possible to include a 2030 net zero target for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities by
allowing them to develop Hardship Compliance Plans based on actual technological barriers and hardships? Is
it possible to keep the 2030 net zero target for all “New Covered Properties” without pre-empting the state
building code by having a fee, rather than penalty, structure?
Please stay the course to pass a final version of the BEUDO amendments that is strong, vigorous, and
adequate to the urgency at hand!

Please support strong BEUDO amendments

Dear Cambridge City Councillors,
Thank you so much for your support thus far of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO). This is truly admirable work!
Please finalize the amendment to require all BEUDO buildings over 25,000 square feet to be net-zero by 2035, with only
local offsets permitted. Please also support the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target for new large lab, scientific research,
and medical facilities, to prevent emissions from these buildings from undermining the greenhouse gas reductions
BEUDO is designed to bring about.
We cannot allow this situation to continue to be out of control any longer. Apparently, greenhouse gas emissions from
large commercial and institutional buildings in the city increased by almost 30% from 2011 to 2019.
Affected parties can absorb the costs. Please don’t assume otherwise. We have waited far too long to fully address
global warming. New England is warming faster than other parts of the U.S.
Cambridge has an exemplary history including its involvement in founding this nation. Let’s honor that history by taking
decisive action to slow climate change on a schedule much more appropriate to the severe time limits outlined by the
IPCC than the alternative. The benefits in livability, health, economic justice and additional years at net-zero will far
outweigh the costs.
Thank you!
Sincerely,
David Buck, 307 Elm St. Unit 3, Cambridge 02139-1485

Perspective on BEUDO, Support from the Climate Committee

To the City Council:
I’m David Rabkin, a resident living at 184 Huron Avenue and the Chair of the City’s Climate Committee.
As an individual and as the Committee Chair, I’m requesting that tonight you approve BEUDO as is, and not
amend it further.
• More than 20 years ago, the City created the Climate Protection Action Plan, which recognized the

threat of climate change and called for substantial reductions in the City’s overall greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions.
• As the years have progressed, our understanding has consistently grown, and so has our assessment of
the increased severity of the consequences of inaction.
• In 2017, the Council, responding to a lack of progress toward our City’s stated goals, passed a policy
order calling for the City as a whole to become “net zero” with regard to greenhouse gas emissions
by 2035.
• In 2021, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed a law – its Climate Roadmap – which called for
the state’s overall GHG emissions to be reduced by 50% relative to 1990 levels by 2030.
• As currently proposed, BEUDERO (BEUDO) targets reducing by 2035 a big chunk, but still far less than
50%, of our city’s emissions. It’s a great first step – but only a first step – toward our goals and the
requirements of the laws we face.
• BEUDO was intended to cover the city’s large properties – both commercial and residential.
• The Climate Committee has considered BEUDERO and the current form being considered today many
times. Each time, and over many years, the Committee has argued that BEUDERO should be more
inclusive, not less:
o We have questioned the use of exceptions and/or different schedules for laboratories.
o We have questioned, but now accept, the exemption of condominiums in the short term, and
only because of the ownership structure questions. We note that condos, too, will need to
be weaned from fossil fuel, which will require additional regulation.
o And we have repeatedly recommended that the City consider including MORE residential
properties - not keep the current 50 units and above in BEUDO. Boston sets the limit at
15. Exempting them altogether is inappropriate. They are large, single-owner buildings,
precisely the type of real estate BEUDO should cover.
o Since the Committee has not considered other kinds of exemptions, I can’t comment on them
beyond stating that ultimately we need to regulate ALL our buildings. Why exclude ANY that
fall into the category of larger, single-owner properties, particularly when we have processes
for exemptions relating to financial or technical challenges?
• BEUDO is going to be complex and challenging to implement. Even if it’s 100% effective, it still targets
less than half of the City’s overall emissions. The City needs to stop adding exceptions – which only

Attachment: David Rabkin Perspective on BEUDO Support from the Climate Committee (COM 1539 #2023 : A communication was received from

4.11.a

Packet Pg. 512

creates challenges for future policy-making and implementation – and focus on what comes next,
specifically:
o Implementation: We need to provide access to the advisory, technical, and financial services
and tools that property-owners need to respond effectively to BEUDO.
o The rest of our city’s building stock: Developing the regulations needed to target all the other
kinds of buildings in Cambridge is far from straightforward, and yet it’s essential to reaching
our goals and complying with the laws we and the Commonwealth have passed.
It’s time to pass BEUDO, shift our focus to the support that property-owners need, and get down to business
on the rest of the emissions-reduction task before us.
Thank you.

BEUDO amendment

Dear Honorable Councillors,
I support the BUEDO amendment by Councillors Toner, Simmons, and McGovern to align condos and rental properties.
While limiting greenhouse gas emissions from commercial buildings is important, treating condos more favorably than
rental units discriminates against tenants, who tend to have lower incomes and will need to pay rent increases. It may
also encourage condo conversions, thus further reducing our rental housing supply. Thank you for your consideration.

Please pass a strong version of BEUDO

Dear Mayor and City Councillors,
On June 26 you’ll have a chance to vote on a good policy to cut emissions in our city. The BEUDO Amendments will make
Cambridge healthier and will make our city a leader and an example of appropriate local-level climate action. We know
that we will need a multitude of policies to slow the heating of our planet and that local policies, like BEUDO, have a
central role to play.
I am proud of the work you gave done to craft the version of BEUDO that is before you today, you and the CDD have
worked very hard to reach a good compromise. I think exempting condo owners at this time was a wise choice, just like
favoring local offsets over global ones and setting up a review board with a robust presence of different stakeholders.
Please protect the current version from any attempt to weaken it or granting exemptions. Commercial and institutional
buildings have had a big win when the threshold was raised to 100,000 sf and up. Now it’s time to protect our residents
and our children, whose future is already damaged, from the most catastrophic consequences from climate change.
Please consider a change to make construction after 2024 be netzero by 2030. Development and climate goals need not
be antithetical, but new development can’t continue to rely on fossil fuels and contribute to emissions when we need to
reverse the course.
When there was an air quality alert due to the air pollution from the wildfires in Canada I kept my kids at home instead
of taking them to the playground. No parent wants a future where it’s too hot to be outside, the air is too polluted to
breathe, and there’s not enough water to grow the food we need.
All children, in Cambridge and everywhere, deserve better. The cost of climate inaction falls squarely on their young
shoulders. Please take responsibility for our climate future by passing strong BEUDO Amendments. Our children’s eyes
are looking at you.
Thank you for your leadership

Starlight Square Update

Dear Neighbor,
I hope your summer is off to a great start. As Program Director at Central Square BID, I am writing to you with
an update regarding Starlight Square. We have heard your concerns, and we are committed to reducing any
negative impact. As a residential or commercial neighbor, you are on my outreach list - and your participation
and enthusiasm as a community member is key to our season’s success.
We are proud to share that Starlight has begun its fourth season of events and performances. We have been
approved by the License Commission of the City of Cambridge for all events thru July 8th. We have also
submitted proposed programming to the License Commission for events happening July 15th thru August 13th.
This application will be heard during the Board of License Commissioners’ Public Meeting on Thursday, July
13th, beginning at 10:30am.
As we have done in the past, a monthly schedule of events has been posted on-site at the corner of Bishop
Allen Drive and Norfolk Street, and on the Starlight Square website (starlightsquare.org/events). We also have
several QR codes posted around the outside of Starlight that link to the public events calendar.
All past sound mitigation efforts are still in place. We reduced the number of performances featuring live drum
kits, and reduced the total number of events by eliminating shows on Tuesday evenings to limit weeknight
impact. We invested in two amplifier shields to help isolate the sound of guitar and bass amps. These shields
have been tested to lower decibel levels from performances. Last season, we implemented several sound
mitigation strategies, which included reducing speakers, installing acoustic panels, investing in a drum shield,
reducing live music events, and ending Sunday performances by 3:00 PM. Our A/V staff will continue to
measure decibel levels multiple times during each event to ensure compliance with the city's noise ordinance.
Do you have any feedback you’d like to share?
If you’d like to share any feedback during an event or otherwise, please contact the on-site manager (Erik,
Danielle, or Carissa) at this phone number: (617) 279-5518. As a neighborhood organization, your input is
important to us. As always, feel free to email me. Expect to hear from me on a monthly basis as we keep an
open dialogue.

Support Strong BEUDO Amendments

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you for your support thus far of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO).
We have another hurdle to cross by making these amendments as strong as possible so they reflect the
urgency of the climate crises upon us. We can no longer give a break to owners of large buildings as we seek
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equitably. Large buildings produce the bulk of the emissions that impact
Cambridge residents and their health.
Therefore, we urge you to include an amendment for a 2030 net zero target for new large labs, scientific
research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these buildings could undermine the
greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.
As parents, we want a livable climate now and in the future for all residents. We urge you to pass a final
version of the BEUDO amendments that is as strong as possible to address the urgency of the climate crisis.

BEUDO Vote June 26th, 2023

Dear City Councilors:
We thank you for service to Cambridge.
We understand that you will be vo ng today on BEUDO amendments that could substan ally reduce Cambridge’s
emissions of greenhouse gases.
The climate emergency calls for rapid reduc on of emissions. Cambridge could beneﬁt itself and the global community
by leading in this respect. The building sector oﬀers major opportuni es to reduce emissions.
The owners and operators of large buildings in Cambridge could easily aﬀord to make major, rapid reduc ons in
emissions, without resort to oﬀsets. Arguments to the contrary do not recognize the signiﬁcance of this moment in
human history.
We urge you to vote for measures consistent with the gravity of this historical moment.

Please Support a Strong Set of BEUDO amendments

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you so much for your combined vision, energy, and commitment that has resulted in a strong set of
amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO), which will come before the Council
on Monday, June 26.
As my twenty-three-year-old daughter, Emily, raised in Cambridge, is setting off on her adult life, I worry a
great deal about the state of the world she is inheriting, an unstable world marked by record ocean warmth,
record low reservoirs in the West, and record wildfires, storms, and floods. And I worry about children and
families right here in Cambridge who suffer from asthma, the effects of extreme heat, and other issues related
to climate and the burning of fossil fuels.
The BEUDO amendments will have a significant impact in moving us toward our Net Zero goals as a city. They
are, in fact, essential.
Thank you again for everything you've done so far. I urge you to follow through on Monday by passing a final
version of the BEUDO amendments that is strong, vigorous, and adequate to the urgency at hand.
Thank you,

Please exempt large rental housing from BEUDO 2035 retrofit timeline

Dear Members of the Cambridge City Council and City Manager Huang,
We understand that an amendment will be offered at the June 26th City Council meeting to exempt large
rental housing from the BEUDO 2035 retrofit timeline. I urge you to adopt this amendment. The existing 2035
timeline will cause displacement of residents in order to rush through the retrofits; it will also cause higher
rents to pay for the retrofits.
The City Council has many laudable goals. Unfortunately some of these goals are in conflict. Rushing through
residential retrofits will conflict with maintaining our already inadequate supply of affordable housing.
Maintaining our housing supply must take precedence. Remember that the April 12 City Councillor BEUDO Q &
A document opined that “Even a limited scope project could require relocation of occupants for up to a year”
(page 2) .
I urge the Council to take the time to study what level of retrofits can be done without displacing residents,
and to locate funding sources that are substantial enough for the task at hand (tens of thousands of dollars
per rental unit). In the meantime, please assign large rental housing to the 2050 timeline.
With many thanks for your consideration,
Helen Walker

Critical Climate Votes on Monday

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and City Councilors,
My name is Jack Hanson and I'm the Executive Director of Run On Climate and a former City Councilor in Burlington,
Vermont. I've written to you previously on votes to advance climate action in Cambridge.
You have a great opportunity tomorrow to make progress on the most consequential issue of our time -- the climate
crisis -- while simultaneously helping make your community safer, more affordable, and more resilient.
What you all do in Cambridge matters well beyond the direct impacts. The policies you are voting on serve as both an
inspiration and a model for communities across the country.
Our work at Run On Climate is to accelerate municipal climate action and spread the most effective municipal climate
policies to jurisdictions across the U.S. I can tell you with certainty that Cambridge is among a small handful of leading
municipalities.
Tomorrow you have the chance to pass cutting edge policy that will help push forward and shape climate action across
this country.
Decarbonizing buildings is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and Cambridge is poised to lead the way. Please
vote yes on the BEUDO amendments without any changes that would weaken them. Please also vote yes to move
forward on prohibiting fossil fuels in newly constructed buildings. This is, from my perspective, a no-brainer and should
be adopted swiftly.
Thank you for reading and please reach out any time if you would like to discuss further.
Sincerely,
Jack Hanson

PO#5: NO MORE DELAY in Economic Impact assessment

Dear Councillors Nolan, Mallon, Zondervan and McGovern,
I am writing about PO#5 which you have put forward. I am surprised by the timing and, unfortunately,
I must question your motives.
The business community has waited well over a year for something the Council promised to do in
February 2022---- conduct an economic impact assessment of CSO separated bike lanes on
businesses. It took well over a year for CDD to find and hire a consultant, Volpe Transportation. The
contract and approach was recently reviewed at Councillor Toner's economic development
committee. Councillor Nolan is the only PO sponsor that participated and did not raise concerns
about approach or suggest any of the content now in the PO.
We all want to ensure the study is as accurate and meaningful as possible, and perhaps the PO
content adds value to that goal. I am sure this is the rationale you will provide at the council meeting.
However, the timing is suspect given the the consultant has already begun work and CDD's goal is to
have the study completed in the fall. Over the past year, you had plenty of time to offer your
suggestions, as well as those of your advisors, on approach to the CM and CDD as the RFP was
developed.
Unless there is a definitive Yes answer that the PO content can be incorporated into the existing
Volpe contract without creating a delay, it should not pass. Or, would passage of this PO mean the
consultant selection process needs to be re-bid as this seems to be a material change in project
scope as well as approach? For sure, the price tag just increased. It would be very unfortunate if this
PO created any further delay rather than provide an outcome enhancement.
It is disheartening to see the continued lack of support and understanding from the council for our
small businesses and their situation. They have waited over a year for the study to even be kicked off
and now this wrench is thrown into the discussion. Please, no more delays.
Sincerely,
Joan Pickett

Support BEUDO Amendment

Dear City Councillors,
Please support the amendment to exempt large apartment buildings and to allow houses of worship and
hospitals extra special consideration as well as historic buildings. It is common sense to make these changes
now before passing the Ordinance. Large apartment building owners will pass along the cost of retrofitting their
buildings to tenants further exasperating our housing challenges. Religious organizations are already facing
significant financial challenges. Why should the city add to them with the full knowledge now they will be
unable to afford retrofitting their buildings?
The goals of BEUDO are laudable but please consider impacts on those that are smaller contributors to the
problem and the spill over impacts which run counter to other city goals. Make changes to the Ordinance now
before it passes.
Sincerely,
Joan Pickett

We need strong BEUDO Amendments

Dear City Councillors:
I am writing to urge you to pass strong BEUDO amendments to cut emissions in our city. I commend all the
work you’ve done so far on this crucial policy, now it’s time to vote on a strong policy to meet the challenges of
the climate crisis.
As a parent and property owner, I am deeply worried about the impact of climate change in our city and
globally. It is our duty, as adults, to do all we can to protect all children and deliver them good climate solutions.
BEUDO is an excellent climate solution that will make us a model city in addressing building emissions, the
largest source of emissions in our city.
As you vote for a final version, please close a loophole and include a 2030 net zero target for new construction
such as labs, scientific research, and medical facilities. This change is fair and practical and helps us meet our
BEUDO targets
Thank you for your service.

VOTE NO PO109 - Increasing the scope of impact study does not work

Vote NO on PO109 about the business survey. While I share your frustra on about the lack of a business impact analysis,
increasing the study's scope and complexity will make things much worse and assure failure. To deliver on large,
complex projects, you must focus on the problem you wish to solve rather than "boiling the ocean." A be er approach

To that end, we should limit our focus to 5‐7 years of data and a few speciﬁc CSO sites. If we ﬁgure out a good model,
we can expand in a subsequent phase to other areas and be er understand the best data to collect going forward.
You never have exactly the data you think you need at the beginning. e.g., tax returns of all businesses (which is a

Finally, the recently published business survey results provide their essen al and clear concerns. The survey design was
subop mal but did give insights. In the absence of other data, the business owners voiced signiﬁcant dissa sfac on with
parking, traﬃc, and the cost of space. These points should not be ignored as 'subjec ve.' Even though the survey
included businesses with private parking, 70% of respondents rated these issues as major concerns.

RE: Act now on climate - we need strong BEUDO amendments

Dear City Councillors,
I am pleased to see that the BEUDO amendments have been prepared by the CDD with extensive input from council
members and the public. Thank you for your careful a en on to the details of this crucial issue. I am looking forward to
ﬁnal passage of the amendments this Monday, June 26, and hope that this will have your support.
The issue of a 2030 net zero target for new buildings including large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities is an
important one. I understand that an amendment to deal with this has been proposed, but that there are possible legal
issues regarding pre‐emption. I hope that these issues can be resolved and that net zero for new construction can move
forward, either now or at a later date. This will have a major impact on the effectiveness of our city climate policies.

Dear City Councillors,
I write to urge you to pass the strongest possible BEUDO amendments, with a net zero target date of 2035 for large
emi ers, and eﬀec ve ﬁnancial support for smaller emi ers. A net zero target date of 2050 is clearly inadequate given
the increased urgency of the climate crisis. Please also minimize the use of global oﬀsets. The City of Boston plans to
allow only 10 percent of emissions to be compensated for by carbon oﬀsets, and the Commonwealth of Massachuse s
up to 15 percent. Strict limits on oﬀset use are essen al, given the dubious and o en counterproduc ve record of global
oﬀsets.
I a ended the recent rally at City Hall sponsored by Sunrise and other groups, and was struck by the sincerity and
passion of Cambridge Rindge and La n School students on this issue. Please do not fail the next genera on by bending
to pressure from corpora ons and universi es to water down climate ac on. We have collec vely delayed ac on for
much too long, while engaging in ﬁne‐sounding rhetoric on climate. Now is the me to prove our commitment by taking

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you for your support for a strong set of amendments to BEUDO. You have taken the issue of building
emissions seriously in the interest of your constituents in Cambridge.
As a parent and grandparent I am concerned about a liveable future for my children and grandchildren. I am
also concerned about everyone living in Cambridge suffering from the harmful effects of building emissions.
There is financial support now at the state and, especially, national levels in the Inflation Reduction Act which
we can draw on. We can and must push our building owners, including, importantly, institutional ones (who,
with their own studies are showing the harmful effects of building emissions), to be doing their part.
I appreciate your hard work as elected representatives of our city. Please pass a final version of the BEUDO
amendments that will protect the people who elected you.
I also support the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target for new large lab, scientific research, and medical
facilities. Without it the large emissions from these facilities could undermine the gas reductions that BEUDO
is designed to bring about.

Policy Order #5 Business Impact Study

The city of Cambridge should enlist the involvement of the MIT Urban Planning Department to conduct the Impact Study
for the bike lanes instead of trying to hire an outside independent company.
Cambridge is investing an extensive amount of money in bike lanes that are reshaping our entire city without any pre or
post analysis for their impacts.
Almost all of the really good existing economic impact studies have been written by university professionals who know
how to effectively aggregate and conduct such projects, especially one that will take years to complete.
Currently there is very little trust between the small business community and the city. Having a local university with
strong ties to our community would be a much better option than utilizing an outside firm being paid by the city.

Congratulations and Thank You!

Dear city council, city manager and city staff,
Congratulations on making Cambridge such a great place to live and for winning these two well deserved
awards/designations!
It takes a team of dedicated individuals with dedicated staff to achieve something like this. My husband and I were so
happy to have given birth to and raised our two boys in Cambridge even though it has not always been easy for us
financially. There were always so many great free events to take our kids to and so much help when we needed it,
sometimes from many of you. I sent my boys the link to the “Best Place to live for families” and said “You’re Welcome!”
;-0
https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/

A Mass. city was named best place to live for
families in 2023, according to Fortune

As an environmentalist I have been a part of the push to demand you do more but I have always appreciated how hard
you work and care for this city and the people who live and work in it, how well this city runs, how easy it is to get what
we need from various city departments and that you are continually striving to do more, so congratulations and thank
you.

Comments to City Council on Ordinance #26 - BEUDO Amendments

Honorable City Councillors:
First of all, thank you so much for your support thus far of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO).
I think by now we are all aware that the climate crisis is barreling down upon us fast. Most of us can now see, feel,
smell and personally experience it almost every day of the year. The climate crisis is of course not an issue that
Cambridge alone can solve but we must act in good faith and follow a moral compass that dictates we do our best.
By helping to reduce the CO2 levels in Cambridge, stronger BEUDO amendments are a great step in the right
direction. So I urge you to pass the strongest amendments possible!
Please do not vote to exempt houses of worship, health centers or hospitals. This has the possibility of creating
large loopholes. We need to keep exemptions to attributes like technical or financial feasibility. The BEUDO Review
Board should be able to evaluate exemptions requests on a case-by-case basis. I urge you also to not vote to
exempt residential buildings. The CDD was clear that we need to ensure that residential buildings start the process
of recognizing they need to decarbonize. Simply having residents switch to 100% renewable electricity will get most
of them to their goal.
Lastly, I support the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities.
Without this provision, emissions from these buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO
is designed to bring about. We must ALL be working together on our goal of reaching Net Zero. How can we
possibly hope to achieve that if we exempt so many players?
Again, my sincerest gratitude for all you do on a daily basis trying to achieve our climate goals as a city and to do
our part for the global community.

Residents Alliance supports strong BEUDO

6/26/23
Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in strong support of the proposed amendments to BEUDO. The city
council has passed a goal of net zero for the entire city by 2035, and a strong BEUDO is crucial in meeting that important
goal.
We strongly support a 2030 Net Zero target for new construction projects started after 2024. This would incentivize
more building developers to build directly to net zero construction. It does not make sense for any new building to
include fossil fuel combustion equipment when technologically and economically viable alternatives already exist, and
are already implemented in Cambridge. Since existing buildings can reduce their carbon emissions, we should not
create exceptions for new buildings.
The ordinance amendment already includes a hardship exemption, which would automatically cover any buildings that
have financial or technical feasibility issues with compliance. No further changes should be allowed. No exemptions for
new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities should be written into the ordinance, because emissions from
these buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.
Thanks to all of you who have worked for a strong BEUDO. We hope you will pass a strong BEUDO ordinance tonight.
Our prior letters are included below for your reference.
Sincerely,

I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in strong support of passage of the BEUDO
ordinance. We are pleased with the amended ordinance that is before the Council and hope you
will pass it to second reading.
We are pleased that local carbon credits must be utilized first. We are disappointed with the
decision to place properties with less than 100,000 sq. ft. of development on a 2050 timeline,
and think the threshold should have been no higher than 50,000 sq. ft.
Our 4-24 letter is included below for your reference.

4/24/23
Dear Mayor and Councilors,
Passing a strong Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) that holds building owners
accountable for the true cost of their emissions is an essential step in combating climate change.
As a city, our climate goals have not been achieved. We need to accelerate the switch away from
fossil fuel and should have goals that are far ahead of the world, including a date of 2035 for
larger commercial buildings in the city to be fossil fuel free.
We want Cambridge to be an environmental leader that shows how to take effective action to
reduce climate change, so that we leave the world habitable for our grandkids. Therefore we
ask that the 2035 deadline be enacted. We do not agree with the city’s proposal for a slower
timeline for commercial buildings with less than 100,000 Sq. Ft.
Councilors, we ask you not to give the universities and other large buildings a way out by
allowing them to use cheap global carbon offsets, as they requested in private meetings with city
staff, and as city staff proposed at the 4/12/23 Ordinance hearing. We disagree with the city’s
proposed “PAVER” offset criteria. As you know, global offsets are poorly monitored, and there
are instances where they have actually harmed indigenous people in Kenya and Chile with
schemes that did not even end up reducing emissions.
The ordinance already includes an Alternative Compliance Payment option for situations where
building emissions cannot be directly reduced. This fee of $234/ton is the established cost of
local decarbonization from Boston’s ordinance.
We oppose using global offsets because we want to reduce emissions locally, or no further than
New England. Funds from local offsets will be used to create local green jobs that decrease
Cambridge's energy usage. Reducing local carbon emissions will also have the co-benefit of
improving the quality of the air we breathe in Cambridge itself, and will cut the number of
premature deaths caused by fine particulate pollution, especially in low-income communities and
communities of color, children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions.

We also note that the Council’s version was developed collaboratively and publicly, and its
supporters made numerous concessions to offer flexibility, including the campus designation, the
emissions factors, the deferred compliance credits, and much more to make a 2035 deadline
feasible.
Passing a strong BEUDO ordinance will support well-paid green jobs and reduce economic
inequality. The Cambridge Community Foundation report showed that 40% of Black residents
are in the bottom quintile of the city's income ladder. The Green Jobs program, passed in March
2023, will use local building emissions offsets from the BEUDO ordinance to create free green
jobs programs and economic opportunity for low-income residents in Cambridge. Workers who
refurbish our buildings to deal with climate change will earn a living wage. Weakening BEUDO
by allowing the use of global carbon offsets will reduce opportunities for green jobs. The city’s
Green Jobs ordinance should quickly be put in motion and be used to hire Cambridge residents
to do retrofits of affordable housing in Cambridge. Installing solar and increasing energy
efficiency are important ways to help Eversource meet the need for additional green electricity.
We commend the city for starting a program to help multi-family buildings decarbonize.
Because residential buildings cause only 15% of Cambridge’s emissions, it makes sense to focus
first on decarbonizing the big commercial properties. Therefore, we strongly agree with
removing condo buildings at this time from the Ordinance. As the new multi-family program
generates experience and knowledge, those lessons can then be used to develop an ordinance
regarding residential buildings. In particular, we urge the city to create a better process to
involve residents of condo units.
We support funding and technical and other assistance from the city to help building owners
navigate decarbonization.
Lastly, policy review should occur sooner than 2032, and the Ordinance should set review
milestones at several earlier points.
The City Council should move to pass this policy without changes to carbon offsets. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Lee Farris, President

Please pass strong BEUDO amendments on Monday

It’s been a long path to this Monday night’s vote on the BEUDO amendments.
I’ve been impressed by the persistence of our City Council in working towards consensus on the much-needed
BEUDO amendments. Our city manager and Community Development Department have been flexible and
resilient in responding thoughtfully to advocacy from all sides.
The compromise language that was agreed on June 5 will result in a nearly 50% reduction in local greenhouse
gas emissions, much of it occurring over the next 12 years when scientists tell us the most aggressive cuts are
needed to ward off catastrophic levels of warming.
Please vote for a strong version of the BEUDO amendments and avoid last minute provisions that could
weaken the impact of this initiative. The review process included in the amendments can address legitimate
concerns about special challenges in implementing emissions reductions.
I remain concerned about the loophole in the state’s 10-town fossil fuel-free demonstration project that will
allow new construction in Cambridge of large labs and biomedical facilities with fossil fuel infrastructure. I
support the amendment to BEUDO that will put these large new commercial and institutional buildings on an
accelerated 2030 path to net zero.
Thank you again for the commitment you’ve shown to a greener and more resilient future.

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you so much for your support thus far of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO).
As a parent, the climate crisis is a palpable reality to me, and I want my city to be doing everything it can to
reduce greenhouse emissions swiftly and equitably
We can draw on all the support now available at the state and national levels, and we can and must push our
building owners, including, importantly, institutional ones, to be doing their part.
Please represent my voice, and the voice of so many residents, and pass a final version of the BEUDO
amendments that is strong, vigorous, and adequate to the urgency at hand.
One specific possible modification to the amendments that I support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target
for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these
buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.

Dear City Councillors:
I am grateful for your support in implementing comprehensive amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO). As a parent, the climate crisis is an undeniable reality that deeply concerns me, and I strongly
believe that our city should take every possible measure to swiftly and fairly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
With the available support at both the state and national levels, it is crucial that we encourage all building owners,
particularly institutional entities, to actively participate in this collective effort. I kindly request that you represent my
voice and the sentiments of numerous residents by approving a final version of the BEUDO amendments that exhibits
strength, robustness, and a level of urgency commensurate with the situation.
I would like to highlight one specific amendment that I wholeheartedly endorse, which involves incorporating a 2030 net
zero target for new large labs, scientific research, and medical facilities. Failure to include this provision might
undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that the BEUDO aims to achieve through these buildings.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

PLEASE PASS the BEUDO Amendments

Dear City Councillors,
As you probably know, I have written to you many times over the past couple of years about the BEUDO
Amendments. Ever since I was appointed to the Net Zero Action Plan 5-Year Task Force, I have understood
that large buildings are the elephant in the room with respect to greenhouse gas emissions in Cambridge. No
other source of emissions comes close.
Many people have worked very hard to get Cambridge to the point of passing emission reduction
requirements -- the BEUDO Amendments. I will not repeat here the arguments that I and many others have
been putting forward for making the Amendments as strong as possible. The version of the BEUDO
Amendments that the Community Development Department (CDD) has submitted for the June 26 City
Council meeting goes a long way towards achieving that goal.
I am aware that several amendments to the CDD version of the BEUDO Amendments may be proposed at
tonight's City Council meeting:
•

I do not think that particular types of buildings (such as hospitals or religious institutions) should be
exempted; we will have the BEUDO Review Board to make case-by-case decisions on requests for
exemptions.

•

I also do not think that large single-owner residential buildings with rental units should be exempted;
those buildings need to get started on reducing their emissions, and the 100% renewable community
aggregation electricity program that Cambridge offers gives them a simple way to make substantial
progress towards that goal.

•

Finally, assuming it would be legal for all new construction to be required to be net zero by 2030, I
support the amendment to require that. Everyone talks about new construction and major renovations
being the easiest place to achieve net zero buildings, and to achieve that quickly. It makes complete
sense to try to do that.

BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO PASS THIS ORDINANCE -- NOW. It is time to pass the BEUDO
Amendments. Please vote for them on June 26, so that we can get started with implementing them.
With appreciation for all of the hard work that you have done to get us to this point,

Could you kindly forward this submission and attachments to the Ordinance Committee
for consideration of the Proposed Amended Buildings and Landmarks Ordinance now being
considered?

Dear City Councilors :
The backdrop of the Proposed Ordinance should not be ignored since it was in direct
response to our labor. As many of you know, I am fourth generation Cambridge resident. My
family has paid taxes to this city for over a century. My parents and grandparents worked in the
factories here. I say this to emphasize my breath of interest in preservation of our history,
whether it be our immigrant industrial history; our African American history; or, yes, even the
history of our privileged West Cambridge landed gentry. Based on this appreciation and full
well having experienced the razing of Boston's West End, along with the unbridled development
in Kendall, I rallied some neighbors to study the possibility of establishing a Conservation
District in East Cambridge. We were not a group of old white privileged wealthy people. We
were a group of serious-minded residents who were truly motivated by an appreciation of the
value in our history and architecture. We met weekly for about 9 months in the St. Francis of
Assisi Church Hall, a notable Landmark itself. We spent much time establishing boundaries,
looking at other guidelines employed around the country and within Cambridge, taking walking
tours of the boundaries; and researching the history of this great neighborhood.
Once the petition for establishing an East Cambridge Conservation District was filed, we
were pilloried all over social media. Audrey Vetrano Cunningham and I were mocked
incessantly with video clips posted to twitter even ridiculing our "Italian accents." Bill Dines
was portrayed as an out of control privileged old white man. John Whisnant was mercilessly
described as an old greedy white man. Truly the basis was absurd since the positions we were
taking were absolutely supported in law. Our MGL c. 40(C) provides standing to owners. It is
the law. There is no value judgement we were making. It is the law. Hence, in response to our
proposed Conservation District, you have before you what has been termed the "Crowe Petition."
Recently I note that Conservation Districts in Brookline have been struck down as
unlawful. Why?? Because they did not mirror the process or requirements set forth in MGL. C.
40(C). Our Conservation District ordinance and process up to now is absolutely faithful to 40(C).
The Citizen Petition now presented as a Proposed Ordinance is devoid of any foundation in law
to be presented as a variation of any Conservation District composition or process. The Proposed
Ordinance creates some kind of land use system, not zoning and not preservation, premised on
equity and diversity and business interests. It completely alters the rigors of standing which are
as old as property law itself and violates 40C. It rejects any notion of professional or academic
qualifications, likewise in violation of 40C and in doing so the Proposed Ordinance insults the
lawyers, architects, real estate professionals, urban planners and historians who have always

Attachment: Marie Elena Saccoccio Document 163 (COM 1571 #2023 : A communication was received from Marie Elena Saccoccio)

Dear Madam Clerk:

comprised the Commission and the Neighborhood Conservation Districts as uncompensated
volunteers. This is not to say that adherence to the strictures of 40C is the only lawful process
that can be adopted. However, adherence to 40C is the wisest process since that process has
been wedded and analyzed and ordained within a statute that has stood legal challenges
throughout the years.
I am attaching here two cases for your review. The Brookline case clearly provides that
even with a Neighborhood Conservation District, the strictures of MGL c. 40C apply. You
simply cannot ignore state law. And I am attaching here a Cambridge case involving our Avon
Hill Neighborhood Conservation District in which the Superior Court found that:
“The Commission incorrectly argues for a "supported by substantial evidence" standard.
Cambridge Municipal Code, 2.78.240 ("The superior court may reverse a determination if
it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record"). To the extent such section of the
Municipal Code seeks to alter the statutory standard of review as set out in G.L.c. 40C,
§12A, such section violates state supremacy, and is therefore void.”

I also note that in violation of Plan E, one City Councilor intervened with the Cambridge
Historic Commission, personally attempting to stop the process and promote her constituents’
position. I have a letter she authored attesting to this and there is also a recorded meeting of the
Conservation District in which she demanded that the entire process be stopped. As this is a
flagrant violation of Plan E, I am requesting that City Councilor refrain from any further
participation, including discussion at Council, and any vote or decision that may result.
I am attaching here a wonderful resource compiled on the history of preservation in this
Commonwealth. It is not a tool we suddenly discovered to become rich overnight. I also note
that our Historic Commission, and especially the Neighborhood Conservation Districts, are often
cited nationally as a kind of gold standard. Please find attached here an informative read
explaining how historic preservation can be a tool for ensuring affordable housing and not its
enemy. It discusses Jane Jacobs and how she would view the Affordable Housing vs.
Preservation false dichotomy. Also, cited within that article, Cambridge in 1983, created the first
Conservation District in the country, quickly forming the basis for Nashville, Dallas, Miami, and
Chapel Hill. Today there are over 165 NCD's in 35 states.
In sum, I support the requested changes presented by Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the
Cambridge Historic Commission. They are crafted to comply with the law and amend where
needed.

Opinion
Title:
MEMORANDUM
OF
DECISION AND ORDER ON PLAINTIFFS'
MOTION
FOR
JUDGMENT
ON
THE
PLEADINGS
This is an appeal from a decision of the Avon
Hill
Neighborhood
Conservation
District
Commission ("Commission") denying plaintiff's
application for a certificate of appropriateness to
build a garage in the front setback of their
property. This appeal is pursuant to G.L.c. 40C,
§12A. Plaintiff moves for judgment on the
pleadings pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c).[2]
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs, John and Julia Bagalay, submitted
an application for a certificate of appropriateness
to the Commission to construct a 21' x 22' garage
within the front setback of their home. It is
undisputed that the proposed design was by the
original architect of the Bagalay's home, was
consistent with the historical and architectural
character of the home, and was consistent with
the historical and architectural character of the
entire neighborhood. After two public hearings
and a site visit, the Commission voted
unanimously to deny the application. The

Bagalays appealed to the Cambridge Historical
Commission.
The
Cambridge
Historical
Commission failed to act on the appeal within
thirty days from the date of filing, thereby
entitling the Bagalays to an appeal before this
court, pursuant to G.L.c. 40C, §12A and
Cambridge Municipal Code, 2.78.240.
DISCUSSION
The superior court may only annul a decision
of a historic district commission if: (1) the
decision exceeds the authority of the commission,
or (2) the decision is unsupported by the
evidence. G.L.c. 40C, §12A. Two courts have
refined this standard using somewhat similar
language. In Marr v. Back Bay Architectural
Comm'n, the court stated that a historic district
commission decision may be annulled if: (1) the
reasons given on the face of the decision are
insufficient in law to warrant the commission's
decision, or (2) if the reasons given on the face of
the decision are unwarranted by the evidence. See
23 Mass.App.Ct. 679, 683-84 (1987). In Gumley
v. Board of Selectmen of Nantucket, the court
stated that a decision may be annulled if: (1) the
decision is based on legally untenable grounds, or
(2) the decision is "unreasonable, whimsical,
capricious or arbitrary." See 371 Mass. 718, 724
(1977) citing MacGibbon v. Board of Appeals of
Duxbury, 356 Mass. 635, 638-39 (1970).[3]
The plaintiff attempts to argue that the
Commission fails both prongs of the inquiry. As to
the first prong, plaintiff claims that the
Commission failed to consider the statutory
criteria of "appropriateness,"[4] specifically,
"architectural value and significance," and instead
denied plaintiffs' application based solely on a
legally untenable valuation of public space over
private space.
The certified record clearly reveals that the
Commission considered the "architectural value
and significance" of the proposed garage as well
as its "relation to the land area... and to
buildings... in the vicinity..." G.L.c. 40C, §7.[5]
Furthermore, the Commission's consideration of
the relative value of public space, on a case by

4.43.c

(Mass. Super. 2004)

Packet Pg. 557

case basis, clearly falls within the specific
statutory
mandate
for
Historic
District
Commissions. G.L.c. 40C, §2 ("The purpose of
this chapter is to promote the educational,
cultural, economic and general welfare of the
public through the preservation and protection of
the distinctive characteristics of buildings and
places significant in the history of the
commonwealth... through the maintenance and
improvement of settings for such buildings and
places...") (emphasis added). The protection of
historically significant public space is also
included among the statutory criteria of
appropriateness. See G.L.c. 40C, §7 ("[T]he
commission shall consider, among other
things[6]... the building... in relation to the land
area upon which the building... is situated... and
the commission may in appropriate cases
impose... set-back requirements...") (emphasis
added); see also Cambridge Municipal Code,
2.78.220.
Therefore, to the extent the application was
denied based upon the incongruousness of the
front setback garage to the public's enjoyment of
the "place" of Avon Hill, and the incongruousness
of the front setback garage to the "setting" in
which Avon Hill's historic houses reside, such
basis for decision was entirely appropriate under
the law.
Turning to the second prong of the inquiry,
the court will not intrude upon the discretion
granted the Commission by the legislature to
make such a determination of incongruity unless
such
determination
was
"unreasonable,
whimsical, capricious or arbitrary" in light of the
evidence before the court.[7] Gumley, 371 Mass. at
724. The evidence before the court is the certified
record dated March 25, 2004, and upon this
record, the Commission's determination that the
proposed siting of the garage was incongruous to
the historic character of Avon Hill is entirely
reasonable and cannot be said to be whimsical,
capricious, or arbitrary.
Plaintiffs' assertions to the contrary are
meritless: (1) that the Commission ignored the
unanimous support of neighbors for the plaintiffs'

project is of no momentùthe Commission is
tasked by c. 40C with promoting "the general
welfare of the public" and not simply the interests
of a few abutters; (2) that there exists a maximum
30% lot coverage cap in the applicable zoning
ordinance does not mean there exists a
"certificate of appropriateness by right" for all
projects falling below the maximum; (3) the
Commission agreed that the garage's architecture
was significant, beautiful, and congruous to the
neighborhood, but nowhere in the statute does it
state that architectural factors are more
important than the physical siting of the garage or
the siting's effect on the public's enjoyment of an
historic streetscape; and (4) any concern
expressed by the Commission about setting
unfavorable precedent is a mere statement of the
consequences the Commission believed in good
faith would attend the improper granting of a
certificate of appropriateness. That the certificate
would be improper was based upon a careful and
reasoned judgment in light of the statutory
criteria of appropriatenessùa judgment which the
court may not replace with its own.
ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby
ORDERED that judgment enter AFFIRMING the
decision of the Avon Hill Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission denying
Plaintiffs' application for a certificate of
appropriateness.

such section violates state supremacy, and is
therefore void.

Some examples of the Commission's
consideration of the statutory criteria are as
follows: "Mr. Irving said... the proposed garage
worked with the main house and was subsidiary
to it." C.R. at 101; "Ms. Norfleet commended the
applicants for the original drawings... [S]he
disagreed that the garage would not detract from
the pedestrian experience of the street." C.R. at
101; "[Ms. Born] said the information and design
were very good." C.R. at 102; "Ms. Born
recommended that the motion deny the
application based on the proposed siting of the
garage but not on the architectural design of the
garage building." C.R. at 118.
[5]

"Among other things" are several "General
Conservation Standards" as set forth in the "Avon
Hill Neighborhood Conservation District Order
(June 15, 1998)." C.R. at 79. The general
conservation standards are to "conserve the
historic
development
patterns
of
the
neighborhood, including its green space, open
vistas, generous setbacks, and predominantly low
density lot coverage [and to] enhance the
pedestrian's
visual
enjoyment
of
the
neighborhood's buildings, landscapes and
structures..." These standards permissibly expand
upon the statutory criteria of appropriateness and
conform to the explicit purpose of c. 40C as
delineated in §2.
[6]

Plaintiffs urge this court to rule that the
Commission did not give "sufficient weight to the
statutory factors and criteria of 'appropriateness,'
" specifically, the architectural significance of the
garage and its relation to surrounding buildings
and the land. Plaintiffs' brief at 3-4 (emphasis
added). The amount of weight to grant the various
[7]

pieces of evidence before the Commission falls
solely within the discretion of the Commission.

The TOWN OF BROOKLINE, Defendant.

DECISION ON CROSS-MOTIONS
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Howard P. Speicher, Associate Justice
INTRODUCTION
*1 “You call this a barn? This looks like a stable.”

“Well, if you look at it, it's a barn; if
you smell it, it's a stable.”

“Well, let's just look at it.” 1
Sometimes one's perception of the nature of a thing (or in this
case, a law) depends on one's perspective or on the context
in which it is perceived. In the present dispute, plaintiff
Hancock Village I, LLC (“plaintiff”) perceives Brookline's
Neighborhood Conservation District Bylaw as a zoning
bylaw illegitimately masquerading as a general bylaw in order
to stymie the redevelopment of the plaintiff's property. The
town of Brookline (“Brookline” or “the town”) perceives
the same bylaw as a legitimate exercise of its home rule
powers to enact a general bylaw. According to the plaintiff,
however, Brookline has chosen to view the bylaw from a
perspective that willfully and conveniently ignores its true
substance and nature. In short, the plaintiff contends that the
town has elected not to smell the stable so that it might insist
that it is a barn.

4.43.d

In 2011, the town of Brookline adopted a “neighborhood
conservation district” bylaw. This bylaw would serve to create
local commissions with the ability to regulate the dimensions,
layout, and design of construction in designated districts.
Brookline adopted the bylaw not as an amendment to its
zoning bylaw pursuant to G. L. c 40A, or as a historic district
bylaw pursuant to G. L. c. 40C, but as a general town bylaw
pursuant to its general home rule powers.
The first district established under the bylaw comprised
solely the entire Brookline portion of the 70-acre property
of plaintiff. 2 Plaintiff filed this action seeking to invalidate
both the bylaw establishing the framework for the creation
of neighborhood conservation districts in the town, as well
as the particular section of the bylaw creating the district
encompassing the plaintiff's property. It contends that the
bylaw was not a proper exercise of Brookline's general police
power, as its subject matter falls squarely under the purview
of G. L. c 40A and G. L. c. 40C, and must therefore have been
enacted pursuant to the procedures provided in those statutes,
and with the substantive protections and mechanisms required
by those statutes.
For reasons discussed below, I find and rule that although the
Neighborhood Conservation District Bylaw and the related
Hancock Village Neighborhood Conservation District Bylaw
were in the form of general bylaws, they are both properly
characterized as zoning bylaws that fail to comply with
the procedural and substantive requirements of the Zoning
Act, G. L. c. 40A, and that further, to the extent they are
characterized as historic district bylaws, they fail to comply
with the procedural and substantive requirements of G. L. c.
40C. Accordingly, they will be declared to be invalid and of
no force and effect.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
*2 On April 13, 2018, plaintiff Hancock Village I, LLC
filed a six-count complaint against defendant the town of
Brookline seeking declarations to the effect that Section 5.10
of the Brookline General Bylaws was invalidly enacted and
is of no force and effect. Counts I through IV seek declaratory
judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231A. Count I requests a
declaration that the bylaw in question was enacted without
compliance with the procedures of
G. L. c. 40A, § 5,
and Count II requests a declaration that the substance of the

Brookline filed an Answer on May 14, 2019, and an
Amended Answer on May 21, 2019. The parties attended a
case management conference on May 29, 2018. In accordance
with an agreed-upon schedule, on February 15, 2019 the
parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and
responses to each other's motions. A hearing was held before
me on the parties' respective motions on May 7, 2019, after
which I took the motions under advisement.

The following material facts are found in the record for
purposes of Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, and are undisputed for the
purposes of the pending motions for summary judgment:
1. Hancock Village is a 70-acre mixed-use development
consisting of 789 garden-style apartments, 530 of which are
in Brookline, with the remainder in the 20-acre portion of
the property that lies over the city line in Boston. Hancock
3

2. The vast majority of the Brookline portion of Hancock
Village is located in the M-O.5 (Apartment) zone,
Brookline's lowest density apartment house district. 4 The
remainder is in a single-family district.
3. In August, 2011, the plaintiff submitted an application for
“Major Impact Project Review” to the Brookline Building
Commissioner, which is a preliminary step in applying
for a special permit under the Brookline Zoning Bylaw.
The application was for the development of thirty-one
detached single-family homes and 162 dwelling units in a
multifamily building. 5
4. In the fall of 2011, two warrant articles – Article 5
and Article 6 – were proposed, and were scheduled for
consideration at a November 15, 2011 Special Town
Meeting. 6

Conservation Districts (“NCDs”) in Brookline. 7
6. The petitioner's description of the NCD Bylaw that
accompanied the warrant for Article 5 described NCDs as
a tool “designed to be more neighborhood specific than
the Town's Local Historic District (LHD) By-Law ... The
guidelines for a particular NCD, unlike an LHD, can be
focused less on preservation of the specific details of each
structure and more on preserving the general character
of a neighborhood, by ensuring that the general scale,
composition, massing and design is compatible with the
site as well as other existing structures in the surrounding
area.” It stated that “the guidelines for an NCD could
address landscape and urban issues such as protection of
landscapes, open spaces, viewsheds and paving without
grade changes.” 8

UNDISPUTED FACTS

Village is owned by plaintiff Hancock Village I, LLC.

5. Article 5 would insert Section 5.10 into Brookline's
General Bylaws; this section, titled “Neighborhood
Conservation Districts” (the “NCD Bylaw”), set out
the framework for the operation of Neighborhood

7. Article 6 would insert Section 5.10.3.d.1 into this section,
creating the Hancock Village Neighborhood Conservation
District (“Hancock Village NCD”), which was to be an
NCD applicable solely to the plaintiff's property. 9 This
was the first time an NCD had been on the warrant for any
town meeting in Brookline. 10
*3 8. These articles were proposed as general town bylaws
under the town's home rule power, rather than as zoning
bylaws adopted pursuant to the procedures in G. L. c. 40A.
9. Articles 5 and 6 were discussed and debated at seventeen
meetings of various town boards and committees. 11
10. Article 5 and Article 6 were approved by Town Meeting in
November 2011. Article 5 was passed by a recorded ballot
vote of 183 in favor, 35 opposed, with 5 abstentions. Article
6 was passed by a counted vote of 200 in favor and 24
opposed. 12
11. On May 30, 2012, the Attorney General approved the
adoption of Article 5 and Article 6; however, she noted that
the “question is close” as to whether the proposed bylaw
should have been adopted as a zoning bylaw. 13
12. Since the passage of the NCD Bylaw, plaintiff has secured
comprehensive permit approvals pursuant to G. L. c. 40B
for the further development of Hancock Village. The

Bylaw. 14 Brookline and a number of abutting landowners
filed an appeal of plaintiff's comprehensive permit on
March 11, 2015. That appeal was dismissed by order of the
Land Court (Piper, J.) on July 17, 2018. 15
13. Plaintiff has made at least six applications to the Hancock
Village NCD Commission for work on existing homes.
None of these have been denied. 16
14. On April 3, 2018, plaintiff filed the present action seeking
to invalidate the NCD Bylaw contained in Section 5.10 as a
whole, including both its establishment of the general NCD
framework as well as the particular Hancock Village NCD
contained in Section 5.10.3.d.1. 17
The NCD Bylaw
15. Section 5.10.1 of the NCD Bylaw, which sets forth the
bylaw's purpose, states, in part:
This by-law is enacted for the purposes of preserving
and protecting groups of buildings and their settings that
are architecturally or historically significant; preserving
and protecting the layout of neighborhoods or historical
subdivisions of neighborhoods, vehicular and pedestrian
circulation patterns, green spaces, landscapes, and
viewsheds that are historically significant or significant to
the character of the town or its neighborhoods; preserving
and protecting distinctive features of the architectural,
cultural, economic, political, or social history of the town
and its neighborhoods, and limiting the detrimental effect
of alterations, additions, demolition and new construction
on the character of the town and its neighborhoods.
Through this by-law, alterations, additions, demolition,
and new construction may be reviewed for compatibility,
including without limitation design, massing, topography,
scale and materials with the existing buildings, green
spaces, open spaces, courtyards, landscapes, neighborhood
and subdivision plans and layouts, circulation patterns,
viewsheds, settings, and neighborhood character. 18
16. Pursuant to Section 5.10.4 of the NCD Bylaw, each
NCD is to be overseen by a commission (“NCD
Commission”) of at least five members, consisting of
a combination of Brookline Preservation Commission
members and residents of the town appointed by the Board

17. Each NCD Commission is tasked by the NCD Bylaw with
“exercis[ing] its powers in administering and regulating
the alteration of buildings, other structures and natural and
manmade elements within such NCD as set forth under
the procedures and criteria established in this by-law,”
and “review[ing] all Reviewable Projects in the NCD,
including without limitation new construction, demolition
or alterations that affect the landscape of topography,
the exterior architectural features of buildings and other
structures, or the mass and siting of buildings and other
structures.” 20
*4 18. Section 5.10.2 defines “Reviewable Project”
as including “(i) a change to a building or
other structure or part thereof such as removal,
construction, reconstruction, restoration, renovation,
replication, rehabilitation, addition, partial or total
demolition and other similar activities, or the construction
of a new building or other structure or part thereof ...
(iii) addition or replacement of doors or windows ... (iv)
a change to a site that includes constructing, placing,
erecting, installing, enlarging, or moving a building or
other structure or similar activities; (v) the removal or
addition of streets, driveways, parking areas, walkways, or
paved surfaces...” 21
19. Section 5.10.5 provides that “a building permit (which
shall include permits for demolition) or an occupancy
permit may not be issued for an altered building, structure,
site or property or other Reviewable Project without the
prior issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.” 22
20. Section 5.10.7 states in part: “The Commission shall
determine whether the proposed alteration or other
Reviewable Project, including any modification thereof
agreeable to the applicant, is compatible with the specific
design guidelines of the applicable district and the purposes
of the bylaw.” It further states that a Certificate of
Appropriateness will be issued if the Commission deems it
compatible, and denied if it is deemed incompatible. 23
21. Section 5.10.3.c states: “The Commission may impose
dimensional requirements that further the purposes of
the by-law, including without limitation preventing
Reviewable Projects inconsistent with the historic or
architectural aspects, scale or massing, neighborhood or
subdivision plan or layout, circulation patterns, or green

character of the NCD.”

24

22. Section 5.10.3.d.1 establishes the Hancock Village
NCD, and provides a number of specific “design
guidelines” for the NCD. Per these guidelines, elements
that “shall be compatible with the existing buildings
in the district” include: “[t]he architectural design and
building materials” (Section 5.10.3.d.1.i); the elements of
the façade, such as windows, doors, and trim (Section
5.10.3.d.1.iii); the “shape, pitch, style, and type of roof
(Section 5.10.3.d.1.iv); and “[t]he size, height and massing
of a building or other structure.” (Section 5.10.3.d.1.ii). 25
23. As to this final category, Section 5.10.3.d.1.ii of the
Bylaw goes on to state: “Compatible building size, height
and massing shall include, but not be limited to limited
to [sic]: (a) No building over 2 ½ stories in height ...
shall be constructed. (b) In relation to any abutting single
family, detached homes, any new single-family homes shall
be similarly oriented, have similar rear yard depths, and
similar distance between dwelling units.” 26
24. Section 5.10.3.d.1.v also states that the project shall
“maintain the spatial organization of the district,” and
shall not have a “significant negative impact on historical
architectural or landscape elements ....” It further provides
that “[s]ignificant negative impacts shall include, but not
be limited to: ... (d) Addition of new impervious surfaces
within 100 feet of abutting properties, and (e) Loss of open
space through building coverage exceeding 20% of the area
of the district ....” 27
The Zoning Bylaw
25. As provided in Section 1.00, the purposes of the
Brookline Zoning Bylaw (the “Zoning Bylaw”) include
“(b) preventing overcrowding of land ... (e) preventing
undue concentration of population ... (j) encouraging the
preservation of historically and architecturally significant
structures; ... (l) providing for adequate open space,
including landscaped and usable open space, public shade
trees and other landscape and natural features.” 28
*5 26. Sections 5.00 – 5.92 of the Zoning Bylaw comprise
extensive dimensional regulations imposed on districts
throughout the town. Table 5.01, in particular, provides
specific height maximums, minimum lot sizes, open

space requirements, minimum setback requirements,
and floor area ratio maximums. 29
27. Section 5.06 of the Zoning Bylaw provides “Special
District Regulations” for certain areas of the town on the
basis that “unique land use, environmental, architectural
and other physical conditions present within the Town
require detailed neighborhood, district or site planning
and design review to insure: orderly and planned growth
and development; [and] historic and natural resource
conservation; residential neighborhood preservation ....”
These Special District Regulations are to be established
by Town Meeting “from time to time, in accordance with
M.G.L. Chapter 40A.” 30
28. Special District Regulations established under Section
5.06 impose dimensional requirements, such as maximum
height, minimum open space, and maximum floor area
ratio, which differ from those which would otherwise be
required by Table 5.01.
29. Section 5.09 of the Zoning Bylaw, which is applicable
in a number of designated areas in the town, establishes a
“Design Review” process with the purpose of “provid[ing]
individual detailed review of certain uses and structures
which have a substantial impact on the character of the
Town and upon traffic, utilities and property values therein,
thereby affecting the public health, safety, and general
welfare thereof.” 31
30. This process allows the Planning Board and Zoning Board
of Appeals to review proposed construction for, among
other things, “consisten[cy] with “use, scale, yard setbacks
and architecture of existing buildings and the overall
streetscape of the surrounding area” (Section 5.09(4)(c));
“the location and configuration of open space” (Section
5.09(4)(d)); the impact of layout on vehicular circulation
(Section 5.09(4)(e)); and consideration of “historic,
traditional or significant uses, structures or architectural
elements ....” (Section 5.09(4)(k)). 32

JURISDICTION
*6 The Land Court has exclusive jurisdiction over actions
brought pursuant to G. L. c. 240, § 14A for the determination
of the validity of an ordinance “adopted under the provisions
of chapter forty A or under any special law relating to zoning,
so called, which purports to restrict or limit the present

This court likewise has jurisdiction over the plaintiff's counts
for declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A. Under that
statute, the Land Court may “on appropriate proceedings
make binding declarations of right, duty, status and other legal
relations sought thereby ... in any case in which an actual
controversy has arisen and is specifically set forth in the
pleadings.” G. L. c. 231A, § 1. “A landowner who seeks to
challenge the validity of a zoning by-law where there is an
actual controversy may bring a proceeding in the Land Court
under G. L. c. 231A or under G. L. c. 240, § 14A.” Mantoni
v. Board of Appeals, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 273, 275, 609 N.E.2d
502 (1993).
Construing the plaintiff's constitutional claims as a subset of
its G. L. c. 240, § 14A claim, they may properly be heard
in the Land Court as well. Typically, a plaintiff must notify
the Attorney General of constitutional claims pursued within
the context of a declaratory judgment action. See id., quoting
Gamache v. Acushnet, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 223, 438
N.E.2d 82 (1982) (“If the party seeks to involve a question of
constitutionality in the declaratory judgment proceeding, ‘the
attorney general shall also be notified of the proceeding.’ ”).
The record reflects the plaintiff's previous communications
to the Attorney General strenuously objecting to the passage
of the Warrant Articles; however, there is no indication one
way or the other whether the plaintiff has indeed notified the
Attorney General of the present action. Nonetheless, no notice
to the Attorney General is required for an action under G. L.
c. 240, § 14A. Id. Accordingly, the Land Court may maintain

jurisdiction over the plaintiff's constitutional claims insofar as
they are considered to be incorporated into its G. L. c. 240,
§ 14A action.
The Land Court independently has jurisdiction over the
present action because it was properly filed in the Permit
Session. Pursuant to

G. L. c. 185, § 3A:

The permit session shall have original
jurisdiction, concurrently with the
superior court department, over civil
actions in whole or part: (a) based
on or arising out of the appeal
of any municipal, regional or state
permit, order, certificate or approval,
or the denial thereof, concerning the
use or development of real property,
including without limitation appeals
of such permits, orders, certificates or
approvals, or denials thereof, arising
under or based on or relating to
chapter ... 40A to 40C, inclusive, ...or
any local bylaw or ordinance; (b)
seeking equitable or declaratory relief
(i) designed to secure or protect the
issuance of any municipal, regional or
state permit or approval concerning the
use or development of real property
or (ii) challenging the interpretation or
application of any municipal, regional
or state rules, regulations, statutes,
laws, bylaws, ordinances concerning
any permit or approval; ...and (d) any
other claims between persons holding
any right, title or interest in land
and any municipal, regional or state
board, authority, commission or public
official based on or arising out of
any action taken with respect to any
permit or approval concerning the use
or development of real property but

project or development involves either

such land.” G. L. c c. 240, § 14A. “The primary purpose
of proceedings under § 14A is to determine how and with
what rights and limitations the land of the person seeking an
adjudication may be used under the provisions of a zoning
enactment in terms applicable to it, particularly where there
is no controversy and hence no basis for other declaratory
relief.” Hansen & Donahue, Inc. v. Town of Norwood, 61
Mass. App. Ct. 292, 295, 809 N.E.2d 1079 (2004). There is
no dispute that plaintiff is the owner of the land which is
subject to the challenged bylaw, and the nature of its challenge
– contending that the bylaw should have been, but was not,
enacted pursuant to G. L. c. 40A – falls within the purview of
the statute. See G. L. c. 240, § 14A; Valley Green Grow, Inc. v.
Town of Charlton, 27 LCR 99, 103 (2019) (Foster, J.) (“The
court sees little distinction between determining the validity

*7 Although not a direct appeal of a denial of a permit,
the plaintiff alleges in its complaint, and the record supports
the claim, that the adoption of the NCD Bylaw is a direct
response to, and improperly impacts plaintiff's efforts to
develop additional housing – both single-family units and
multi-family units – as well as other improvements on the
Hancock Village property. 33 In August 2011, the plaintiff
proposed a “major impact project” to add additional housing
at Hancock Village. 34 It is not in dispute that the proposal
to adopt the NCD Bylaw and the Hancock Village NCD
Bylaw was a direct response to this proposal. 35 Under
these circumstances, the Land Court's jurisdiction is properly
grounded in G. L. c. 185, § 3A, in addition to G. L. c. 240,
§ 14A and G. L. c. 231A.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS
The crux of this case is whether Brookline has impermissibly
circumvented G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40C by utilizing its
general home rule power to pass a bylaw that is, in truth,
either a zoning bylaw, a historic district bylaw, or both.
Plaintiff argues that the NCD Bylaw replicates the manner
of regulation governed by these two statutes, but evades
their mandatory procedural and substantive requirements
for enactment and administration. It also argues that the
provisions governing an NCD commission's power to impose
requirements are too vague to pass constitutional muster, and
deprive an applicant of due process. Brookline contends that
the effect of the NCD Bylaw is not to amend the Brookline
Zoning Bylaw, but rather to supplement it through land use
regulation not the exclusive domain of zoning. Similarly,
it argues that the NCD Bylaw differs from historic district
bylaws, and that G. L. c. 40C does not govern all bylaws that
happen to fall within the broad field of historic preservation.
Therefore, it contends, the NCD Bylaw was properly enacted
pursuant to the town's general police powers, and did not need
to adhere to the procedural requirements of either G. L. c. 40A
or G. L. c. 40C. Alternatively, it argues that, even if the NCD
Bylaw does fall under the ambit of these statutes, Brookline
substantially complied with the procedural requirements of
both. Brookline also repeatedly draws attention to the fact
that Neighborhood Conservation District bylaws have been
adopted in other Massachusetts municipalities as general
town bylaws, as they are seen as an effective alternative to
more traditional means of regulation. 36
I. THE NCD BYLAW IS PROPERLY CHARACTERIZED AS
A ZONING BYLAW AND WAS INVALIDLY ADOPTED AS
A GENERAL BYLAW
*8 Towns may enact “by-laws as an exercise of their
independent police powers but these powers cannot be
exercised in a manner which frustrates the purpose or
implementation of a general or special law enacted by
the Legislature in accordance with ... [art. 89, § 8, of
the Amendments to the Constitution].” Board of Appeals
of Hanover v. Housing Appeals Comm. in the Dept. of
Community Affairs, 363 Mass. 339, 360, 294 N.E.2d 393
(1973). A municipality's zoning power is “one category of the
more general police power, concerned specifically with the
regulation of land use,” and an exercise of its zoning power
must adhere to the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 40A.

implementation of the statute. See
id. As previously noted
by this court, “[t]he reason for this is that zoning bylaws have
different, stricter requirements for enactment than general
bylaws. A zoning bylaw must be reviewed by the planning
board in a public hearing and then reported on by the board,
and, crucially, may only be enacted by a two-thirds vote of
town meeting. General bylaws have no such requirements
—they may be enacted by a majority vote.” Valley Green
Grow, Inc. v. Town of Charlton, 27 LCR supra, at 105 (internal
citations omitted).
Brookline impermissibly evaded these stricter requirements
in a circumstance where they were necessary. Brookline's
NCD Bylaw is, in its fundamental substance, a creature of
zoning. It regulates subject matter falling within both the
traditional definition of zoning as well as the existing purview
of the Brookline Zoning Bylaw. Despite this, Brookline
enacted the NCD Bylaw as a general town bylaw, and made
no attempt to follow the particular procedures laid out in G. L.
c. 40A. Accordingly, having failed to strictly comply with the
requirements for enactment of a zoning bylaw, Section 5.10
of the Brookline General Bylaws is invalid, and of no force
and effect.
A. The NCD Bylaw Addresses Subjects Traditionally
Classified as Zoning Under Chapter 40A
The NCD Bylaw has the purpose and effect of regulating
subject matter traditionally falling under the ambit of zoning.
This is a significant factor indicating that a bylaw is governed
by G. L. c. 40A, and must be enacted pursuant to its
procedural requirements. In
Rayco Inv. Corp. v. Bd. of
Selectmen of Raynham, supra, 368 Mass. at 391, 331 N.E.2d
910, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that a bylaw
limiting the number of trailer park licenses that the town
could issue was not a proper exercise of the town's general
police power, as the “nature and effect of the ... bylaw is that
of an exercise of the zoning power.” It noted that “similar
by-laws have been adopted in the past by municipalities as
zoning by-laws,” and that “[t]here seems little doubt that the
1971 by-law could be viewed within the scope of the town's
zoning power.”

Id. On the opposite side of the same coin,

in Lovequist v. Conservation Commissioner of Dennis, 379
Mass. 7, 13, 393 N.E.2d 858 (1979), the court held that it

was not improper for the town of Dennis to enact a wetlands
bylaw through its police power rather than as a zoning bylaw;
and like in
Rayco, the court's analysis looked in part to
the universe of subject matter conventionally regulated by
zoning. It noted that the bylaw was not a “zoning measure
for the reason that [it] manifests neither the purpose nor the
effects of a zoning regulation. The Dennis by-law does not
prohibit or permit any particular listed uses of land or the
construction of buildings or the location of businesses or
residences in a comprehensive fashion. On its face it does
not deny or invite permission to build any structure. It does
not regulate density.” Id. The Court further elaborated that
the wetlands values protected by the bylaw (such as water
supply, groundwater, and flood control) were not “typical
of the concerns usually reflected in the zoning process,”
which instead included such things as “the character of the
community and compatibility of nearby land uses.”

Id.

Brookline relies heavily on
Lovequist, citing to the
proposition therein that “[w]e do not consider all ordinances
or by-laws that regulate land use to be zoning laws,” and
arguing that the NCD Bylaw regulates land use in a manner
that need not be classified as zoning. It is true that the court
in
Lovequist recognized that “municipal regulations that
simply overlap with what may be the province of a local
zoning authority” do not necessarily need to be “treated as
zoning enactments which must be promulgated in accordance
with the requirements of G. L. c. 40A.”
Id. at 14, 393
N.E.2d 858. However, the court made clear that such overlap
was permissible in circumstances where “we think it manifest
that [the bylaw] is not a zoning regulation.”
Id. Cf.
American Sign & Indicator Corp. v. Framingham, 9 Mass.
App. Ct. 66, 69, 399 N.E.2d 41 (1980) (sign bylaw's “overlap
with what may be the province of a local zoning authority”
did not require it to be enacted as a zoning regulation where
it “ ‘manifests neither the purpose nor the effects of a
zoning regulation’ and does not involve most of the typical
concerns reflected in zoning laws”);
Hamel v. Bd. of
Health of Edgartown, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 422, 664 N.E.2d
1199, (1996) (board of health sewage flow regulation which
overlapped with zoning's use regulations was permissible
where the purpose and effect was “the maintenance of safe
drinking water in the geographical area concerned.”). Here,
the NCD Bylaw does not incidentally overlap with the domain
of zoning while embodying a different purpose and effect.

Instead, the NCD Bylaw usurps that domain wholesale,
purpose, effect, and mechanisms all.
*9 All that the Dennis bylaw in
Lovequist was not, the
NCD Bylaw is. The essential focus of the NCD Bylaw's
purpose clause is the protection of the “character of the
town and its neighborhoods” as established by the physical
and aesthetic characteristics of its structures and layout.
This loudly echoes the central objectives of zoning. Zoning
primarily operates to “balanc[e] rights or privileges of use
with the character of neighborhoods, a task which necessarily
calls into play issues of size, location, setback, traffic, and the
sundry other matters addressed in local land use and zoning
bylaws and ordinances.”
Rogers v. Town of Norfolk, 432
Mass. 374, 382, 734 N.E.2d 1143 (2000). Protecting the
character of the neighborhood as reflected in its physical
structures is indeed a familiar refrain in the context of zoning.
See
Lovequist v. Conservation Com. of Dennis, supra,
379 Mass. at 14, 393 N.E.2d 858 (“[T]he character of the
community and the compatibility of nearby land uses” is a
“typical concern[ ] usually reflected in the zoning process.”);
Trustees of Tufts College v. City of Medford, 415 Mass.
753, 758, 616 N.E.2d 433 (1993) (“[P]reserving the character
of an adjacent neighborhood” is one of the “purposes sought
to be achieved by local zoning”);
Emond v. Board of
Appeals of Uxbridge, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 632, 541
N.E.2d 380 (1989) ( “[T]o preserve the character of ... the
neighborhood is one of the ‘broad purposes of zoning’ ”);
Fabiano v. City of Boston, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 286, 730
N.E.2d 311 (2000) (the goal of “preserv[ing] within reason the
historic residential character of the [neighborhood] ... is a goal
surely within the purview of the [Boston zoning] enabling
act.”).
The NCD Bylaw's mimicry of conventional zoning is likewise
apparent in the content and effect of its substantive provisions.
“[Z]oning ordinances or by-laws govern ‘the use of land
and the size, location and use of buildings.’ ”
Hamel v.
Bd. of Health of Edgartown, supra, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at
422, 664 N.E.2d 1199, quoting
MacGibbon v. Board of
Appeals of Duxbury, 356 Mass. 635, 636, 255 N.E.2d 347
(1970). As provided in the Act of the Legislature revamping
G. L. c. 40A, St. 1975, c. 808 § 2A, zoning bylaws achieve
the purposes of zoning by regulating such subjects as “size,
height, bulk, location, and use of structures ...; areas and
dimensions of land ... to be occupied or unoccupied by uses

4.43.d

and structures, courts, yards and open spaces; ... and the
development of the natural scenic and aesthetic qualities of
the community.” The court in
Lovequist itself helpfully
identified a number of characteristics of conventional zoning,
including regulation of density, uses of land, construction and
location of structures, as well as provision of a means to
apply for permission to build structures. See
Lovequist v.
Conservation Com. of Dennis, supra, 379 Mass. at 13, 393
N.E.2d 858.
Here, the NCD Bylaw's definition of “Reviewable Project”
itself makes clear that the NCD Bylaw is indeed almost
entirely concerned with the construction and siting of
buildings. Its provisions go on to provide for regulation of
the dimensional characteristics of such reviewable projects
in order to manage the neighborhood's density and physical
character: at the heart of the NCD Bylaw are the NCD
Commission's powers to regulate “alterations, additions,
demolition and new construction, and its powers to consider
“without limitation” features including “design, massing,
topography, scale and materials ... green spaces, open spaces,
courtyards, landscapes, neighborhood and subdivision plans
and layouts” among others. 37 The Hancock Village NCD
even raids the traditional zoning toolbox for particular
dimensional controls, such as the delineation of specific
height, setback, and open space regulations. 38 There can
be no question that, unlike the bylaw in
Lovequist, the
NCD Bylaw has “the purpose [and] the effects of a zoning
regulation.”

B. The NCD Bylaw Addresses Subjects Already Governed
by the Brookline Zoning Bylaw
*10 The second factor compelling the conclusion that the
NCD Bylaw falls within the scope of Chapter 40A is the fact
that its subject matter has, in fact, been previously regulated
in Brookline by the Zoning Bylaw. “If the municipality
has a history of regulating that subject matter through its
zoning bylaw, then it can only be further regulated through
the zoning bylaw, not through a general municipal bylaw.”
Valley Green Grow, Inc. v. Town of Charlton, supra, 27
LCR at 105. In
Rayco, the court considered it “significant
that prior to the adoption of the 1971 by-law the town's
zoning by-law dealt specifically with the subject of trailer
parks,” and that “the zoning by-law purported to cover
this subject in a comprehensive fashion and it follows that

the 1971 by-law necessarily modified the earlier by-law.”
Rayco Inv. Corp., supra, 368 Mass. at 393, 331 N.E.2d
910. Similarly, in Spenlinhauer v. Town of Barnstable, 80
Mass. App. Ct. 134, 140, 951 N.E.2d 967 (2011), the town
adopted a general ordinance, not a zoning bylaw, regulating
the subject of parking. The Appeals Court noted that the
town had “historically regulated off street parking through
its zoning bylaws, not its general ordinances or bylaws,” and
did indeed have a “comprehensive bylaw regulating parking”
enacted through its zoning power. Id. The new parking bylaw,
by comparison, was intended to address the impact of parking
on the “character and quality of the town's neighborhoods,
precisely the target at which the town's zoning ordinance
is so thoroughly and comprehensively aimed.” Id. at 141,
951 N.E.2d 967. Accordingly, the court concluded that “the
challenged ordinance is a matter for regulation through
the town's zoning power, not through its use of a general
ordinance.” Id.
Given the above conclusion that the NCD Bylaw regulates
subject matter conventionally at the heart of zoning, it
is unsurprising that those subjects are, in fact, already
comprehensively governed by the Brookline Zoning Bylaw.
The Zoning Bylaw's stated purposes reflect those expressly
outlined in the NCD Bylaw – of particular note are the
purposes of “encouraging the preservation of historically
and architecturally significant structures” and “providing for
adequate open space, including landscaped and usable open
space, public shade trees and other landscape and natural
features.” 40
The mechanisms by which the NCD Bylaw sets out to achieve
these objectives replicate, and indeed replace, those already
present in the Zoning Bylaw. Table 5.01 of the Zoning Bylaw
contains the typical dimensional controls, common across
all zoning ordinances and bylaws, which regulate height,
setbacks, open space, and density of construction in the
town. These provisions are intended to control the massing,
scale, and siting of structures and buildings. The NCD
Bylaw displaces the Zoning Bylaw by generally empowering
the NCD Commission to set its own requirements related
to precisely these same categories. Section 5.10.3.c allows
the Commission to “impose dimensional requirements that
further the purposes of this by-law, including without
limitation preventing Reviewable Projects inconsistent with
the historic or architectural aspects, scale or massing,
neighborhood or subdivision plan or layout, circulation
patterns, or green space, open space, landscape, vegetation

4.43.d

or viewshed character of the NCD.” 41 Section 5.10.3.d.1
goes even further to impose its own version of particular
dimensional controls already expressly provided in the
Zoning Bylaw: it requires 80% open space, a 100 foot
setback, 42 and a maximum building height of two and
a half stories, 43 thus baldly supplanting the dimensional
requirements set forth in Table 5.01 of the Zoning Bylaw. The
NCD Bylaw's usurpation of the Zoning Bylaw's domain is
made expressly clear by the concluding statements in both
Section 5.10.11 and 5.10.3.d that, where the NCD Bylaw
imposes stricter requirements than other bylaws, the NCD
Bylaw shall prevail. 44
In fact, in replacing baseline dimensional requirements for
a designated locale, the NCD Bylaw appears to operate in a
similar manner to a mechanism already contained with the
Zoning Bylaw – the creation of Special Districts. Pursuant to
Section 5.06 of the Zoning Bylaw, the town may establish
Special Districts encompassing certain areas of the town;
these are meant to address “unique land use, environmental,
architectural and other physical conditions” of certain
neighborhoods which require particularized regulation. To
address these factors, Special Districts are subjected to
dimensional requirements which differ from those otherwise
imposed by Table 5.01. Thus, not only is the imposition of
generalized dimensional controls the province of the Zoning
Bylaw, but even the act of designating special areas for
particularized regulation is as well. The NCD Bylaw cannot
usurp this power by filling geographic holes which have
purposefully been left free of such particularized regulation.
Brookline's argument that its NCD districts “supplement”
the Zoning Bylaw is no different from the town's unavailing
argument in Spenlinhauer that, because the “detailed and
extensive” parking regulations in the zoning bylaw did not
apply to single family homes, parking for that use could
be properly regulated by a supplementary general bylaw.
The court in Spenlinhauer rejected this, holding that the
framework's inapplicability to a particular use “does not
create a hole the town can fill through enactment of general
ordinances.” Spenlinhauer v. Town of Barnstable, supra, 80
Mass. App. Ct. at 140, 951 N.E.2d 967.
*11 In sum, the NCD Bylaw's imposition of its own
dimensional requirements – whether discretionarily crafted
by the Commission, or delineated by the bylaw itself –
regulates a field already comprehensively addressed by the
Zoning Bylaw, and for precisely the same purpose. Though
Brookline contends that the NCD Bylaw's regulation of these

then consider those recommendations as an additional factor
when reviewing special permit applications. This design
review includes consideration of “historic, traditional or
significant uses, structures or architectural elements.” For one
particular district, it provides that “any new structure shall
be harmoniously related to nearby pre-existing structures and
the street façade in terms of color, texture, materials, scale,
height, setbacks, roof and cornice lines, signs, and design
elements ....” 45
Plaintiff nonetheless agrees that the preservation of historic

II. THE NCD BYLAW IMPERMISSIBLY INVADES THE
PROVINCE OF CHAPTER 40C
Brookline next points to the fact that, apart from its
dimensional regulations, the NCD Bylaw also regulates
aesthetic architectural and landscaping elements through
“design guidelines.” It contends that design has been
traditionally regulated through Brookline's general bylaws,
rather than the Zoning Bylaw, as the latter only regulates such
aesthetic and design elements for certain uses or structures or
in certain areas of the town. Therefore, it argues, the subject
matter regulated by the NCD Bylaw does not overlap with
that of the Zoning Bylaw. Nor does it, Brookline contends,
improperly overlap with G. L. c. 40C's regulation of historic
districts, but instead acts as a permissible alternative to
the manner of regulation envisioned by that statute. Even
assuming that the NCD Bylaw's “design guidelines” could
be practically severed from its dimensional regulations – a
highly unlikely proposition, given the manner in which they
are closely intertwined – the town's contention that they are
permissible subjects of the town's general police power is still
unavailing, as they do indeed intrude upon the domain of G.
L. c. 40C.
First, it should be noted that the Zoning Bylaw does
itself regulate design to a certain degree. Section 5.06 of
the Zoning Bylaw imposes Special District Regulations
on certain designated Special Districts in the town; these
address “unique land use, environmental, architectural and
other physical conditions” of particular neighborhoods which
require further regulation. Not only do these Special District
regulations alter the dimensional requirements to which the
district would otherwise be subject, but they also subject
an applicant to design review pursuant to Section 5.09 of
the Zoning Bylaw. Section 5.09's Design Review Guidelines
provide for “individual detailed review of certain uses and
structures which have a substantial impact upon the character
of the Town....” This requires the Planning Board to submit
design recommendations to the Board of Appeals, which must

architectural design elements is indeed “more definitively” 46
regulated under Section 5.6 of the town's general bylaws,
titled “Preservation Commission and Historic Districts
Bylaw,” 47 than by the Zoning Bylaw. Brookline likewise
points to this section as proof that the NCD Bylaw's proper
place is amongst the town's general bylaws. 48 However, the
appearance of historic district regulation in the town's general
bylaws does not open the door to unrestrained regulation
of the subject under the town's home rule power, because
Section 5.6 was enacted pursuant to and is governed by G.
L. c. 40C. The NCD Bylaw's regulation of historic design
mimics that statute, and must likewise follow its necessary
procedures. Brookline, contending that it did not have to
follow the procedural requirements for adoption of a historic
district bylaw as provided by G. L. c. 40C, §§ 3 and 4, does
not argue that it has complied with those requirements.
*12 G. L. c. 40C pursues the “preservation and protection
of the distinctive characteristics of buildings and places
significant in the history of the commonwealth and its cities
and towns or their architecture....” G. L. c. 40C, § 2. Similar
to G. L. c. 40A's mandate allowing towns to establish zoning
districts only pursuant to specified procedures, G. L. c.
40C states that “[a] city or town may, by ordinance or bylaw adopted by two-thirds vote ... establish historic districts
subject to” a number of procedural requirements that must be
followed “[p]rior to the establishment of any historic district.”
G. L. c. 40C, § 3. (emphasis added) It is true that “[Chapter
40C] gives municipalities unfettered discretion whether to
establish a historic district and, if so, what lands, buildings,
and structures to include in that district.”
Springfield
Preservation Trust, Inc. v. Springfield Library & Museums
Ass'n, 447 Mass. 408, 419, 852 N.E.2d 83 (2006). However,
if a municipality does choose to establish a historic district, it
must follow the statutory procedures for doing so. 49

it is tailored to specific neighborhoods, this argument employs
“supplement” as a euphemism for “supplant.” They expressly
regulate the same subject matter, and the NCD Bylaw serves
to effectively replace the Zoning Bylaw's requirements. As

The practical framework of G. L. c. 40C provides that no
building permit shall issue in a historic district “for alteration
of an exterior architectural feature” without a certificate of
appropriateness, certificate of non-applicability, or certificate
of hardship. G. L. c. 40C, § 6. In determining whether an
alteration is historically appropriate,

the commission shall consider, among
other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance
of the site, building or structure, the
general design, arrangement, texture,
material and color of the features
involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of buildings
and structures in the surrounding
area. In the case of new construction
or additions to existing buildings
or structures the commission shall
consider the appropriateness of the
size and shape of the building or
structure both in relation to the land
area upon which the building or
structure is situated and to buildings
and structures in the vicinity, and
the commission may in appropriate
cases impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to those
required by applicable ordinance or
by-law.

G. L. c. 40C, § 7.
The regulation of architectural design for the purposes of
historic preservation under this framework, and under the
comparable framework provided in Brookline's Preservation
Commission and Historic Districts Bylaw, is no different from
the regulation of design provided by the NCD Bylaw. Section
5.10.3.d.1 begins by articulating the history of the Hancock
Village neighborhood, and describes the particulars of its
historic architectural design. In addition to the dimensional
requirements described above, the NCD Bylaw's substantive
design guidelines govern the same exterior design features
covered by G. L. c. 40C, § 7; and, like the statute, the NCD
Bylaw requires evaluation of those features for compatibility
with the surrounding neighborhood's historical character. It

4.43.d

provides for this evaluation with the aim of “preserving
and protecting groups of buildings and their settings that
are architecturally or historically significant,” which again
directly mirrors the purpose set forth in G. L. c. 40C, § 2. It
even calls for the same manner of approval – a “Certificate
of Appropriateness” – as appears in the statute. Although
Brookline contends that the NCD Bylaw differs in that it
“allows Brookline to address issues beyond the scope of
M.G.L. c. 40C,” the additional issues it lists – “landscape and
urban issues such as protection of landscapes, open spaces,
viewsheds” 50 – are simply the very same issues which
themselves improperly fall within the purview of the Zoning
Bylaw and G. L. c. 40A, as described above. A bylaw cannot
escape categorization under either statute by packaging the
content of one along with the other.
*13 The unavoidable conclusion is that, with regard to
exterior design elements, the NCD Bylaw establishes a
historic district of the type specifically envisioned by G.
L. c. 40C. Accordingly, by purporting to enact the NCD
Bylaw pursuant to Brookline's general home rule power,
but without following the procedural requirements G. L. c.
40C, Brookline has frustrated that statute's purpose. See
Board of Appeals of Hanover v. Housing Appeals Comm.,
supra, 363 Mass. at 360, 294 N.E.2d 393. Brookline contends
that G. L. c. 40C does not occupy the field of historic
preservation, and that the NCD Bylaw may therefore regulate
historic preservation without conforming to the requirements
of the statute. As support for this contention, Brookline cites
no applicable authority other than the Attorney General's
memorandum, which itself concluded without citation to any
precedent that G. L. c. 40C “neither explicitly or implicitly
preempts other types of by-laws aimed at architectural
or historic preservation.” 51 There is no apparent reason,
however, why the interaction between a municipality's
general home rule power and the statutory scheme provided
in G. L. c. 40C should differ in any way from the interaction
between that power and the statutory scheme of G. L. c.
40A. The principles articulated in Rayco and Spenlinhauer
apply just as much in the context of the former as they do
in the latter. It might be so that the entire field of historic
preservation, speaking broadly, is not preempted by G. L. c.
40C; however, it is not so difficult to determine that a town
bylaw which singles out a district for historic preservation,
utilizes a mechanism identical to that of G. L. c. 40C, does so
for the same professed purpose, and does so in a town that has
already accepted G. L. c. 40C, has trespassed on the purview
of the statute. Were it otherwise, the statute's provision of

Accordingly, even if the NCD Bylaw's regulation of historic
architectural design does not fall under the umbrella of G.
L. 40A and the Zoning Bylaw, it is functionally identical to
the historic districts governed by G. L. c. 40C, and would
therefore in any event be required to follow that statute's
procedural requirements for enactment.
III. THE ENACTMENT OF THE NCD BYLAW FAILED TO
COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE
REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER 40A AND CHAPTER 40C
Because the NCD Bylaw's dimensional regulations are, in
purpose and effect, an amendment to the Brookline Zoning
Bylaw, the bylaw can only be valid if enacted pursuant to the
procedures of G. L. c. 40A. It was not. Brookline argues that
the process “substantially complied” 52 with the provisions
of G. L. c. 40A, and that this is sufficient to sustain the bylaw.
It is not. In Canton v. Bruno, 361 Mass. 598, 603, 282 N.E.2d
87 (1972), the Supreme Judicial Court expressly rejected
this same argument, then advanced by the town of Canton,
that “substantial compliance” was sufficient to satisfy the
procedural requirements of the predecessor statute to G. L.
c. 40A, § 5. Interpreting the same language that now appears
in the current text of
§ 5, it held that “the Legislature
mandated a rule of strict compliance by the plain language
‘[Zoning] ordinances or by-laws may be adopted ... but only
in the manner ... provided’ ....” Canton v. Bruno, supra, 361
Mass. at 598, 282 N.E.2d 87. See Penn v. Town of Barnstable,
26 LCR 215, 217 (2018)Penn v. Town of Barnstable, 26
LCR 215, 217 (2018) (Vhay, J.). Cf. McIntyre v. Selectmen
of Ashby, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 735, 739, 584 N.E.2d 1137
(1992) (noting that G. L. c. 40, § 21(17), which authorizes
earth-removal ordinances, was enacted “to avoid the involved
and strict procedural requirements for adopting or amending
zoning ordinances and by-laws ....”).
Brookline asserts that the numerous town and board meetings
held concerning the NCD Bylaw were more than sufficient
to provide notice and procedural protection equivalent to that
available under Chapter 40A. Strict compliance, however,
brooks no equivalence. It is not in dispute that Brookline
failed to strictly comply 53 with the provisions of
G. L. c.
40A, § 5; accordingly, Section 5.10 of the Brookline General
Bylaws, as enacted by the passage of Warrant Articles 5

and 6, cannot stand. Similarly, the NCD Bylaw failed to
comply with G. L. c. 40C's procedural requirements for
enactment. These failures include, among others, the failure
to give written notice of the public hearing on the required
report of a study committee at least fourteen days prior
to the date of the required hearing. G. L. c. 40C, § 3,
¶ 1. Brookline's contention, repeated once more, that it
“substantially complied” with the requirements of G. L. c.
40C is just as unavailing the second time as the first. Thus,
even if Section 5.10's regulation of historic exterior design
in Hancock Village were severable from its dimensional
regulations, the bylaw still could not survive.
*14 Of course, even had the town complied with the
procedural requirements for the adoption of a zoning bylaw
in G. L. c. 40A, § 5, the bylaw as passed is invalid because
it fails to include or incorporate (as was the town's apparent
intention) the many substantive protections and mechanisms
of G. L. c. 40A. The NCD Bylaw, purporting to be a general
bylaw, provides no protection for prior nonconforming uses
or lots as required by
G. L. c. 40A, § 6; it does not
recognize the zoning freeze provisions of the same section; it
does not provide for zoning relief to be granted in the form
of special permits or variances, but instead substitutes types
of approvals and relief not sanctioned by G. L. c. 40A; it
institutes as the local board granting approvals a commission
composed in a manner not recognized or sanctioned by G.
L. c. 40A; it does not provide for the notice or hearing
requirements required by G. L. c. 40A, §§ 11 and
15; and
perhaps most egregiously, by providing no specific avenue of
appeal, it provides for what is only a limited record review by
an action in the nature of certiorari instead of the more robust
de novo review required by

G. L. c. 40A, § 17.

IV. THE NCD BYLW VIOLATES THE UNIFORMITY
PROVISIONS OF G. L. c. 40A, § 4
Aside from its invalidity for failure to utilize the procedural
requirements for adoption of a zoning bylaw, and its failure
to include the substantive protections, noted above, required
to be included in every zoning bylaw, the NCD Bylaw is also
invalid because it violates the uniformity principles that are
fundamental to the validity of any zoning laws, and which
are required by G. L. c. 40A, § 4. Pursuant to that section,
“[a]ny zoning ordinance or by-law which divides cities and
towns into districts shall be uniform within the district for
each class or kind of structures or uses permitted.” G. L. c.
40A, § 4. A bylaw fails to provide uniformity where it is so

requirements on an ad hoc basis. See SCIT, Inc. v. Planning
Bd. of Braintree, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 108, 472 N.E.2d
269 (1984);
Fafard v. Conservation Comm'n of Reading,
41 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 572, 672 N.E.2d 21 (1996). Such an
improper delegation of legislative power results in a scheme
in which criteria are “devised for the occasion, rather than of
uniform applicability.”

Id. at 572, 672 N.E.2d 21.

The seminal example of a violation of uniformity is provided
by
SCIT v. Planning Board of Braintree, where a
town's zoning bylaw rendered every use in a particular
district subject to a special permit, with the only rubric
for consideration being the bylaw's general purpose clause.
See
SCIT, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Braintree, supra, 19
Mass. App. Ct. at 103-108, 472 N.E.2d 269. The Appeals
Court found this to be invalid, holding that § 4 “does not
contemplate ... conferral on local zoning boards of a roving
and virtually unlimited power to discriminate” between
different applications.
Id. at 108, 472 N.E.2d 269. The
bylaw violated the uniformity requirement of § 4 because “
‘[i]t attempted to delegate to the board ... a new power to alter
the characteristics of zoning districts, a power conferred ...
only upon the legislative body of the city to be exercised
only in the manner prescribed by [G. L. c. 40A] ... and
it attempted to do this without furnishing any principles
or rules by which the board should be guided, leaving the
board unlimited authority to indulge in ‘spot zoning’ at its
discretion or whim.’ ”
Id., quoting
Smith v. Board
of Appeals of Fall River, 319 Mass. 341, 344, 65 N.E.2d
547 (1946). Cf. Salvadore v. Town of Westborough, Case
No. 97-0547, 2002 WL 1554586, at *4, 2002 Mass. Super.
LEXIS 199, at *3 (May 22, 2002) (bylaw which provided
for adoption of dimensional requirements on a case-by-case
basis for municipal structures was valid; though “structures in
other zones, such as single-family residences, commercial or
industrial structures” are amenable to uniform requirements,
municipal uses – such as water towers and fire stations – are
not).
The requirement for uniformity is not limited to zoning
bylaws subject to G. L. 40A, § 4, but extends to other
exercises of the police power as well. “In the administration
of controls limiting the use of land – as with any exercise of
the police power – uniformity of standards and enforcement

are of the essence.”
Fieldstone Meadows Dev. Corp.
v. Conservation Comm'n of Andover, 62 Mass. App. Ct.
265, 267, 816 N.E.2d 141 (2004), quoting
Fafard v.
Conservation Comm'n of Reading, supra, 41 Mass. App.
Ct. at 569, 672 N.E.2d 21. For example, in
Fieldstone
Meadows, supra, 62 Mass. App. Ct. at 267 n.5, 816
N.E.2d 141, a conservation commission administering a local
wetlands bylaw employed a policy prohibiting construction
within twenty-five feet of bordering vegetated wetlands. This
requirement was, however, not specifically laid out within the
actual regulatory framework; moreover, it “provide[d] that
‘special justification’ could be advanced for proposals for
building within the twenty-five foot zone.” The court held that
this policy did not provide uniformity of application, and was
a legally insufficient basis for the commission's denial.
at 270, 816 N.E.2d 141.

Id.,

*15 Nonetheless, discretion in applying dimensional
requirements is not per se delegation of authority resulting
in a violation of the uniformity principle; it is only when
a board's discretion is truly unrestrained that uniformity is
threatened. In
Emond v. Board of Appeals of Uxbridge,
supra, 27 Mass. App. Ct. at 632, 541 N.E.2d 380, a provision
of the bylaw permitted the board to grant special permits
for lots with less frontage or area than required by the
bylaw's dimensional requirement, as long as the lots were
“in neighborhoods where there is a general pattern of house
lots that deviate similarly ....” The court found no violation
of § 4: “The by-law does not give the board unlimited
discretion.... Adjustments to conform zoning standards to
the circumstances of particular fact situations need not, we
think, be made exclusively by establishing zoning districts
on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. Authorizing
adjustments by special permit, subject to clear and uniform
standards, does not violate the uniformity requirement of G.
L. c. 40A, § 4.”
Id. See also
MacGibbon v. Board of
Appeals of Duxbury, supra, 356 Mass. at 638, 255 N.E.2d
347 (“The by-law confers a measure of discretionary power to
the board, but it does not confer unrestrained power to grant
or withhold special permits by the arbitrary exercise of that
discretion.”).
Here, the NCD Bylaw goes too far in delegating what is,
in effect, an unrestrained power to legislate ad hoc zoning
requirements. In particular, Section 5.10.3.c missteps in
affording the Commission the general power to conjure up
whatever dimensional requirements it sees fit on a case-by-

case basis. Section 5.10.3.c states, “The Commission may
impose dimensional requirements that further the purposes
of the by-law, including without limitation preventing
Reviewable Projects inconsistent with the historic or
architectural aspects, scale or massing, neighborhood or
subdivision plan or layout, circulation patterns, or green
space, open space, landscape, vegetation or viewshed
character of the NCD.” Like the bylaw in
SCIT, this
provides virtually unlimited discretion, guided only by very
general statements of purpose, to create dimensional zoning
requirements from whole cloth, and to do so on a caseby-case basis, resulting in the very antithesis of uniform
application. 54 See SCIT, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Braintree,
supra, 19 Mass. App. Ct. at 108, 472 N.E.2d 269. And,
it provides not just the power to tweak the numerical
element of a set dimensional constraint – such as
Emond's
downward adjustment of the frontage requirement – but
also the power to create whatever new categories and
types of dimensional constraints the Commission might
imagine. Unlike
Emond, the ability of the Commission
to discretionarily create and impose its own dimensional
requirements deprives the bylaw of the “clear and uniform
standards” which must necessarily be articulated in the bylaw
itself.
Emond v. Board of Appeals of Uxbridge, supra, 27
Mass. App. Ct. at 632, 541 N.E.2d 380. The NCD Bylaw
suffers from this deficiency whether it is classified as a zoning
bylaw (as concluded above) or a general bylaw (as contended
by Brookline).
V. THE NCD BYLAW CONSTITUTES IMPERMISSIBLE
SPOT ZONING
*16 A variant of violation of the principle of uniformity
required by G. L. c. 40A, § 4 is spot zoning. “Spot zoning
involves the singling out for disparate treatment of one parcel
of land from similar parcels in the same zoning district.”
Murphy v. City of Springfield, Case No. 114481, 1987 WL
966132 *2 (Mass. Land Court, 1987) (Fenton, J.), aff'd
25
Mass. App. Ct. 1121, 522 N.E.2d 1017 (Rule 1:28 Decision).
“ ‘Spot zoning’—singling out a parcel of land for special
treatment as compared to other parcels in the same zoning
district—is unlawful.”
Canteen Corp. v. City of Pittsfield,
4 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 293, 346 N.E.2d 732 (1975). Where
a single parcel is re-zoned at the behest of citizens objecting
to a particular proposed use of the parcel, such re-zoning
violates the uniformity principle and is invalid spot zoning.

A zoning amendment “will be sustained unless there exists

Id. at 751, 189 N.E.2d 555. “If the
reasonableness of a zoning regulation is fairly debatable,
the judgment of the local legislative body (here the zoning
commission of Boston) should be sustained and the reviewing
court should not substitute its own judgment. Nevertheless,
a zoning ordinance or by-law will be held invalid if it
is unreasonable or arbitrary, or substantially unrelated to
the public health, safety, convenience, morals or welfare.”

(1990) (citations omitted).
The re-zoning of a single lot of land “at the instigation of
citizens who objected to a particular proposed business use,”
setting it apart from other similar adjacent uses, “constitute[s]
arbitrary and unreasonable action.”
Schertzer v. City of
Somerville, supra, 345 Mass. at 752, 189 N.E.2d 555. This
is so even if the target site of the re-zoning is large enough
that it would not ordinarily be unreasonable for it to be treated
as a subject of re-zoning. In National Amusements, Inc. v.
City of BostonNational Amusements, Inc. v. City of Boston,
the Appeals Court upheld a judgment of the Land Court
invalidating the re-zoning of a 13.8-acre parcel from business
use to residential, holding that zoning changes, “which have
no better purpose than to torpedo a specific development on
a specific parcel are considered arbitrary and unreasonable.”
National Amusements, Inc. v. City of Boston, supra, 29 Mass.
at 312, 560 N.E.2d 138.
There is no doubt that Brookline's purpose in adopting the

the same purpose deemed invalid in Scherzer and National

appeals. 56
The proposal to adopt the NCD Bylaw and the Hancock
Village NCD Bylaw followed directly, with, as noted
above, an explicit written acknowledgment by the Brookline
Advisory Committee Subcommittee on Planning and
Regulation that “[t]he impetus for [Article 6 of the Town
Warrant adopting the Hancock Village NCD Bylaw] comes
from the proposals by [the owner of Hancock Village] to
add as many as 466 new housing units to Hancock Village
... [the owner's] most recent proposal (August 2011) is a
major impact project that includes 31 detached single-family
houses and 162 units in a multi-family building. The Planning
Board, Building Commissioner, Preservation Commission,
Department of Public Works (Traffic and Engineering),
and Housing Advisory Board all have begun to review
the proposal.” 57 The Board of Selectmen also made it
abundantly clear that the town's intention in adopting Article
6 was to force Hancock Village to remain the quaint gardenstyle apartment complex it has been since first built in 1949. In
the Board of Selectmen's “Supplemental Recommendation”
to the Town Meeting on the subject of Article 6, the Selectmen
wrote:
*17 Hancock Village was designed and constructed in
accordance with commitments made by the developer
John Hancock Insurance Company, including not only a
commitment that there would be a buffer strip along the
side of the land facing Russett and Beverly Roads, but also
an agreement that the area would be a “garden village type
of housing” development, with horizontally divided (as
opposed to vertically divided town-house type units) not
exceeding 25% of the units, with flat roofs not exceeding
25% of the buildings, with building coverage not exceeding
20% of the area, and with no building over 2 stories in
height.
...
The design guidelines in Article 6 are intended to ensure
that the development and alterations within the Hancock
Village area are compatible with the existing neighborhood
and abutting properties ... to provide “an additional layer of
protection for existing residents of Hancock Village and
its immediate surroundings.” 58

These explicit acknowledgments of the purpose of the
proposed warrant articles, coming from the committee
charged with reviewing the proposed warrant articles
prior to their consideration by the town meeting and
from the board of selectmen, in combination with the
surrounding undisputed circumstances of the adoption of
Warrant Articles 5 and 6, including their timing in light
of Hancock Village's submission of its development
proposal, 59 compel the inference that in adopting the two
NCD bylaws, “the town was concerned only with blocking
the plaintiff['s] development.”
Pheasant Ridge Associates
Ltd. Partnership v. Town of Burlington, 399 Mass. 771, 779,
506 N.E.2d 1152 (1987). Where the undisputed record allows
the court to draw such an inference, the town's action, even
adopted by town meeting, may be invalidated. Id. (facially
valid eminent domain taking for park purposes invalidated
where undisputed record allowed inference that true purpose
was to block proposed G. L. c. 40B development).
The NCD Bylaw and the Hancock Village NCD Bylaw,
although facially not adopted as zoning amendments, were,
for the reasons stated above, bound to comply with the
principles governing the adoption of zoning amendments, and
also for the reasons stated above, violated the requirements
for uniformity that prohibit spot zoning.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment is ALLOWED, and the defendant's Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED. The court need not address
the plaintiff's arguments as to the unconstitutional vagueness
of the NCD Bylaw, as it invalid for the independent grounds
articulated above. Because it failed to adhere to the procedural
and substantive requirements of G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c.
40C, and fails to provide for uniformity of application, the
enactment of Warrant Articles 5 and 6 was beyond the scope
of the town's power and authority, and Section 5.10 of the
Brookline General Bylaws, in its entirety, is accordingly
invalid and of no force and effect. 60 Judgment will enter in
accordance with this decision.

In the face of Brookline's repeated references to comparable bylaws in other municipalities, the court is
compelled to note that its decision in the present case invalidates a section of Brookline's bylaw, and
Brookline's alone; the court passes no judgment on the validity of any other municipality's bylaw, no matter
how similar. Those other bylaws are not before the court. The validity of each depends on an analysis of its
particulars, and the court is neither inclined nor empowered to undertake such an analysis within the context
of the present dispute.
Section 5.10.1, NCD Bylaw. Joint Appendix p. 875. Although not discussed by the parties, it appears that by
purporting to give NCD Commissions the power to regulate “subdivision plans and layouts” the NCD Bylaw
also impermissibly invades the exclusive province of the Brookline Planning Board under the Subdivision
Control Law, G. L. c. 41, §§ 81K, et seq. This is another basis of the invalidity of the NCD Bylaw.
The NCD Bylaw gives the Commission the unfettered discretion to “impose dimensional regulations that
further the purposes of this by-law...” Section 5.10.3.c, NCD Bylaw. Joint Appendix p. 879.
It must be recognized that such regulation of dimensional characteristics is not always a function purely
of zoning; though zoning must be the default classification of such ordinances, comparable regulation may
appear in a non-zoning context when specifically provided by statute.
G. L. c. 40C, § 7, for example,
does specifically allow a historic commission to “in appropriate cases impose dimensional and set-back
requirements in addition to those required by applicable ordinance or by-law.” However, as discussed further
below, the NCD Bylaw was not passed pursuant to G. L. c. 40C or any other particular statute specifically
authorizing this manner of regulation.
Joint Appendix p. 694.
Joint Appendix p. 879.
As the plaintiff correctly points out, the provision prohibiting the “[a]ddition of new impervious surfaces within
100 feet of abutting properties,” though unusual in its wording, operates identically to a traditional setback
requirement.
Sections 5.10.3.d.1.ii.a; 5.10.3.d.1.v.d and e. Joint Appendix pp. 881-882.
Joint Appendix pp. 891, 899.
Joint Appendix p. 789, “Specific Standards for Beacon Street and Coolidge Corner General Business District.”
Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, p. 55.
Joint Appendix pp. 851-859.
Brookline points to a number of other general town bylaws for the same proposition, but none contain any
comparable regulation of architectural design, and need not be addressed in depth. The other general bylaws
cited as ostensibly similar to the NCD Bylaw's design regulation include Section 8.26, which regulates storm
drains for the purpose of “eliminat[ing] non-stormwater discharges”; Section 8.27, which governs wetlands
protection; Section 5.1, regulating the connection of an alarm to a police station; Section 5.2, regulating
condominium health and safety; Section 5.4, which governs refuse pick-up; Section 5.8, which regulates
signs; and Section 5.9, which adopts the provisions of 780 CMR 120.AA for the construction of energyefficient buildings.
That is, provided that the municipality has accepted the provisions of the chapter and it has thereby become
effective in the municipality. See Allen v. Old King's Highway Reg'l Historic Dist., 2000 Mass. App. Div. 330,
332 (2000). It is clear that Brookline has done so, as it has a historic preservation bylaw passed expressly
under G. L. c. 40C.

Hancock Village I, LLC v. Town of Brookline, Not Reported in N.E. Rptr. (2019)

Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Response, p. 22.
Joint Appendix p. 385.
Brookline's Memorandum in Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 14.
There appears to be some dispute as to whether the plaintiff complied with a number of
§ 5 requirements.
For example, the plaintiff contends that the Planning Board held a meeting concerning the NCD Bylaw, but
it did not hold a “public hearing” as required by
§ 5, and did not provide proper notice that the meeting's
subject matter would be the consideration of a zoning ordinance; Brookline, on the other hand, contends that
two public hearings were indeed held. A Planning Board memorandum states that “The Planning Board held
two meetings on Articles 5 & 6, one of public testimony ... and one for board discussion.” Joint Appendix p. 203.
There is also no indication in the record of precisely when Articles 5 and 6 were first submitted to the Board
of Selectmen, for the purpose of evaluating compliance with the requirement that a Planning Board hearing
be held within 65 days of the Articles' submission. Regardless, it has never been in dispute that Articles 5
and 6 were not specifically noticed as an amendment to the Zoning Bylaw; a failure to specifically identify a
bylaw as Chapter 40A zoning (let alone what appears to be Brookline's concerted effort to emphasize that
the NCD Bylaw was not zoning, but instead an alternative to zoning) is necessarily a “misleading” defect for

the purposes of
G. L. c. 40A, § 5 ¶ 2. Moreover, as discussed below, the bylaw likewise fails to comply
with G. L. c. 40A's substantive requirements.
Brookline asserted at oral argument that Section 5.10.3.d.1's provision of particular dimensional
requirements for Hancock Village meant that the Commission could not craft its own additional dimensional
requirements through Section 5.10.3.c, and would be limited to those contained in Section 5.10.3.d. This
reading does not comport with the plain meaning apparent in the text. Section 5.10.3.c generally empowers
the Commission to “impose dimensional requirements that further the purposes of the by-law” and provides
examples of the types of requirements it may impose. Section 5.10.3.d.1, applicable to Hancock Village
in particular, states that structures “shall be compatible with the existing buildings in the district,” and shall
not have a “significant negative impact on historical architectural or landscape elements.” Although it then
provides a number of specific requirements within each of these categories, it states that the categories “shall
include, but not be limited to” those specifically-provided requirements. Both 5.10.3.c and Section 5.10.3.d.1
provide the Commission with the discretion to impose its own requirements which do not specifically appear
in Section 5.10.3.d.1.
Joint Appendix pp. 1169-1170.
Joint Appendix pp. 127-129.
Joint Appendix p. 1297.
Joint Appendix, pp. 632-633.
At a public hearing on the proposed warrant articles on September 20, 2011, a member of the Board of
Selectmen expressed concern that the NCD might not be passed in time to stop the approval of Hancock
Village's major project impact review application: “Is any understanding or concern about when this – the –
NCD would have to be passed in relation to the building application – the building permit application or the
approval of that application? Is there – is there a point at which the fact that we've – declared a NCD is too
late in the process?” Joint Appendix p. 136.
It must be noted that the Hancock Village NCD is not the only NCD to exist as a subsection within the
overall framework of Section 5.10: enacted as Section 5.10.3.d.2. is the “Greater Toxteth Neighborhood
Conservation District.” While the validity of this other NCD was not directly at issue in this case, the necessarily
wholesale invalidation of the enabling sections of Section 5.10 for the reasons enumerated above logically
precludes the independent survival of that other NCD.

Introduction
For over 10,000 years, human activity has shaped the landscape of this Commonwealth. Today,
this landscape has stories to tell everywhere we look. Whether they are archaeological sites
associated with Native American inhabitants, wood framed structures from early European
settlement or factory villages adjacent to water powered sites, the landscapes of Massachusetts
offer variety and interest that enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors alike. Today,
the Massachusetts landscape is multi-layered as human activity on the landscape has shifted and
shifted again.
The buildings, bridges, parks,
burial grounds, agricultural
landscapes, mill housing,
industrial complexes,
archaeological sites and the
many other historic and cultural
resources found in the cities and
towns of Massachusetts are
significant to our understanding
of our past. They establish our
sense of connection to our
communities and they are the
very reason people choose to
live, work, and visit here.
As irreplaceable significant
historic and cultural resources
have been threatened or
destroyed, advocates for their preservation have organized, voiced their concern, and worked
tirelessly to protect them. Today, a network of local commissions, local and state non-profit
organizations and state government agencies work to assure that historic resources remain an
integral part of our cities and towns while still allowing growth, change, and new patterns of
development.
The Paul Revere House located in the North End, Boston

This State Historic Preservation Plan for 2011-2015 offers the chance for all of us to recognize
our past accomplishments, view the challenges ahead, and see how we can all work together
towards a Commonwealth that continues to reflect the stories of everyone in the historic
landscape around us.
The Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Plan 2011–2015
As the State Historic Preservation Office, the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) is
responsible for taking the lead in preparing the five-year state historic preservation plan. The
MHC is responsible for ensuring that its programs and activities further the broad goals,
objectives, and priorities outlined in this plan. While the Massachusetts Historical Commission
is the primary user of the plan, it is meant to be a plan that will be useful for all preservation

partners at the local, state, and national levels. The preservation community in Massachusetts
includes well over 500 organizations as well as many more organizations directly involved with
historic resources or with the management of historic resources. At over 450, local historic
district commissions and historical commissions make up the majority of the preservation
organizations statewide. In reviewing this plan, local historical commissions and historic
district commissions will note their own goals, challenges, and accomplishments. Likewise, so
will the many other organizations highlighted in this plan. Unlike previous state historic
preservation plans, the goals section of this plan includes the organization responsible for
carrying out each objective.
This plan reflects the input, discussion, and hard work of many individuals representing many
different agencies and groups. Its goal is to provide all of the preservation partners, including
municipal governments, state agencies, regional and statewide organizations and the
Massachusetts Historical Commission with a clear direction on how best to protect the
irreplaceable historic and cultural resources of Massachusetts.
For the Massachusetts Historical Commission this plan has particular importance. Each year, the
Massachusetts Historical Commission develops an Annual Work Program, based on the State
Plan, that describes the implementation priorities and the specific tasks necessary to accomplish
the goals of the State Plan within existing legislative, funding, and staffing opportunities and
constraints.
Creating the 2011-2015 Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Plan
The development of the 2011-2015 State Historic Preservation Plan began in late 2009 with a
review of the content of the previous 2006-2010 State Historic Preservation Plan for
accomplishments, outstanding goals, and remaining challenges. Following a review of current
state historic preservation plans from other states, a general outline for a new state historic
preservation plan began taking shape.
During December 2009 and January 2010, a list of Advising Organizations was developed. This
list included over 80 organizations representing historic preservation
partners at the local, regional, and state level as well as state agencies
and non-profit organizations involved with historic resources.
During early 2010, MHC staff compiled a revised Municipal Status
Database that compiled information on preservation activities for the
351 cities and towns in Massachusetts during the previous five-year
planning cycle. Information included the general level of preservation
activity, historic property surveys undertaken, new National Register
listings, and local bylaws or ordinances that were established.
At the end of January 2010, MHC contacted all of the Advising
Organizations to introduce them to the state historic preservation
planning process, to ask them if they thought other organizations should be on the Advising
Organizations list and to seek their input regarding recent major accomplishments. Local

commission members were involved in this process through the MHC Local Preservation Update
e-newsletter.
MHC followed up with requests for additional comments during the Spring of 2010 through the
Masshistpres listserve and e-newsletter. For the Advising Organizations that had not responded
at that time, MHC followed up directly either in person, by phone, or by email.
Public meetings began in Spring 2010 with a western Massachusetts meeting in Holyoke at
Wistariahurst Museum, hosted by the Holyoke Historical Commission. An additional eastern
Massachusetts public meeting was held in Duxbury in June. At each of the meetings, MHC staff
discussed MHC and its programs, previous state preservation planning efforts, and the outline for
the current preservation plan. A discussion, facilitated by MHC staff, followed that considered
accomplishments, challenges, and goals for the coming five years.
By the Fall of 2010, a draft document was ready for distribution to the Advising Organizations.
During October and November 2010, comments from the Advising Organization members, local
commission members, and the general public were received, reviewed, and incorporated where
appropriate.
The result of this planning process is the Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Plan 20112015.
For the Massachusetts Historical Commission, accomplishments for this plan cover the following
federal fiscal years:
Fiscal Year 2006 – October 1, 2005 to September 30 2006
Fiscal Year 2007 – October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007

A Statewide Overview of Historic Preservation in Massachusetts
Historic preservation in Massachusetts today includes a broad range of organizations at the state,
regional, and local level consisting of all branches of government, advocacy, and educational
organizations as well as the many citizens that deeply value the historic and cultural resources
present in this state. This section of the state historic preservation plan describes these
organizations and their critical role in historic preservation efforts. The table of over eighty
Advising Organizations demonstrates the breadth of organizations involved with historic
preservation in Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts Historical Commission
The Massachusetts Historical Commission was established in 1963 by the State Legislature to
identify, evaluate, and protect the important historical and archaeological assets of the
Commonwealth. Preservation programs at the Massachusetts Historical Commission include the
Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth, the National Register of
Historic Places, Local Government Programs, Survey and Planning Grants, Massachusetts
Preservation Projects Fund Grants, reviews of state and federally funded or licensed projects,
federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits, annual preservation awards, and archaeology
month. The Massachusetts Historical Commission is also the office of the State Historic
Preservation Office and the State Archaeologist. The Commission, which is also the State
Review Board, consists of eighteen members appointed from various disciplines. Professional
staff includes architectural historians, architects, archaeologists, and preservation planners.
The Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth has been compiled
and maintained by the MHC since MHC’s creation in 1963 and has grown to include records on
an estimated 200,000 properties and sites. The inventory includes buildings, structures, sites,
objects, areas, parks, landscapes, and burial grounds. Inventory
information is recorded on MHC inventory forms, following
standards and guidelines set forth in the MHC’s Historic Properties
Survey Manual.
The National Register of Historic Places is a program of the
National Park Service administered in Massachusetts by the
Massachusetts Historical Commission. Properties listed in the
National Register include districts, sites, structures, buildings, and
objects that are significant in American history, architecture,
archaeology, engineering, and culture. The National Register of
Historic Places is the official list of the nation’s cultural resources
worthy of preservation.

Through Local Government Programs, the Massachusetts
Historical Commission provides assistance and advice to local
commissions through publications, compiled resource material, regional workshops, listserve
monitoring, DVDs, and answering daily inquiries.

The annual MHC Survey and Planning Grant program is utilized primarily by local commissions
for historic property survey, national register nominations, design guidelines, and educational
outreach materials. Depending on funding availability, these grants are sometimes limited to
Certified Local Governments.
Administered by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, the Massachusetts Preservation
Projects Fund supports the preservation of historic properties, landscapes and listed, or in certain
circumstances, eligible for listing in the State Register of Historic Places. Properties must be in
municipal or non-profit ownership and can include pre-development and development projects
consisting of stabilization, protection, rehabilitation and restoration.
The MHC is authorized by state and federal law to review and comment on certain state and
federally licensed, permitted, or funded projects to determine whether the proposed project will
have an impact on historic or archaeological properties. Through review and compliance, if it is
determined that the project poses a threat to a historic property within the project area, then
project proponents and the MHC jointly explore alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any
damaging effects.
The Federal and State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits are also administered through the
Massachusetts Historical Commission. These tax credits are available to certified rehabilitation
projects on income-producing properties.
The State Archaeologist, whose permits ensure that important archaeological resources are
properly conserved, oversees archaeological excavations on public lands or on lands in which the
Commonwealth has an interest. The State Archaeologist also reviews development projects that
affect archaeological properties and negotiates solutions to protect the sites.
Preservation Massachusetts, Incorporated
Preservation Massachusetts, Incorporated is the statewide non-profit advocacy organization for
historic preservation. Preservation Massachusetts (PM) advocates for historic resources at the
local level through such initiatives as the Endangered Historic
Resources List and the Circuit Rider program. At the state
level, PM advocates for policies, funding and tax incentives
that help to preserve historic and cultural resources.
Municipal Governments
Local Historical Commissions and Historic District
Commissions, part of municipal government, constitute the
bulk of historic preservation efforts statewide. Together, local
commissions are responsible for updating and expanding their
historic property survey, nominations to the National Register
for eligible properties, educating the public about historic
resources, advocating for significant historic resources and
establishing and/or administering local bylaws and ordinances that protect historic resources.
Local Historic District Study Committees investigate the establishment of local historic districts.

Tribal Historic Preservation Officers
The Tribal Historic Preservation Officers are responsible for historic preservation on tribal
property. This may include identifying significant properties, nominating properties to the
National Register and consulting directly with federal agencies in a government-to-government
relationship regarding potential project effects to sites of traditional and religious significance to
the tribes.
Regional Planning Agencies
The regional planning agencies provide planning assistance in their region on economic
development, community development, land use, transportation, mapping, housing, historic
preservation as well as other areas. There are thirteen regional planning agencies in
Massachusetts with two regional planning agencies having professional preservation staff.
Local and Regional Organizations
A wide variety of local and regional organizations
exist in Massachusetts. Many of these
organizations are advocacy organizations for their
locality or region. Others are museum
organizations focusing on a particular locale or
period. There are also five National Heritage
Areas. Together, these organizations offer
expertise and insight on a diverse range of historic
resources.
State Agencies
Besides the Massachusetts Historical Commission, there are many state agencies that play a role
in historic preservation. Many state agencies are owners of historic properties including open
spaces, buildings and archaeological sites. Other state agencies administer funds, develop
polices and regulate projects that could impact historic resources.
Degree Programs
The degree programs include certificate, bachelor and post-graduate education in historic
preservation. Each program provides a unique level of expertise for understanding, informing
and preserving our significant historic resources.
Creating the Advising Organizations List
As the Massachusetts Historical Commission developed this state historic preservation plan,
efforts were made to reach out to the great variety of organizations, governmental bodies and
individuals involved in historic preservation.
The result was the list of over eighty Advising Organizations found on the next page. These
organizations participated in the development of this state plan from its earliest stages through to
the completion of a final version in the Fall of 2010.

Major
Accomplishments
The preparation of this 2011-2015 State Historic Preservation Plan offers a unique opportunity
to acknowledge the many accomplishments of the past five years. The Massachusetts
preservation community has had many great successes. While not a comprehensive list, this
section of the plan takes a look back over the past five years to reflect on these achievements.
1. Identifying and Documenting Historic and Archaeological Resources
Additions to the Statewide Inventory
MHC’s Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth continued to
grow largely as a result of ongoing community efforts to update and expand documentation of
historic properties and sites. Over 5000 inventory forms were added to the statewide historic
properties inventory from 2006 to 2010. Many local historical commissions continued to update
their surveys incrementally at a modest rate through their own documentation efforts or through
contracted consultant services. Through much of the period, funding for surveys through MHC’s
Survey and Planning Grant program was limited to Certified Local Government (CLG)
communities. With the limited availability of this traditional funding source for professional
surveys, Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds became a key source of support for
professional historic properties surveys in municipalities that have adopted the Act. Among
towns who used CPA to fund surveys, at least seven, Carlisle, Dartmouth, Groton, Norwell,
Northborough, Randolph and Salisbury undertook multi-year or multi-phase, comprehensive
communitywide surveys. Statewide, at least a dozen communities undertook substantial,
professionally-completed communitywide or neighborhood survey projects. Among the CLG
communities that received Survey and Planning Grant support, Boston completed a multi-year
survey of Beacon Hill, and initiated a multi-year survey update of the Central Business District,
Lowell surveyed its Acre and Pawtucketville neighborhoods, Plymouth updated the survey of its
local historic district, and Quincy updated the survey of Quincy Center. Interest in documenting
mid-20th century resources grew, and the towns of Lincoln and Brookline undertook thematic
surveys of their mid-20th century resources, the latter with Survey and Planning grant support,
and Boston’s CBD survey included a reevaluation of mid-century buildings as a key component
of the project.
Electronic Submissions and Inventory File Scanning
MHC continued to update its survey program to develop standards for digital photography and
the use of digital mapping resources, and to provide guidance on web-based research methods.
It also developed standards for receiving and processing electronic version submissions to
supplement hard-copy inventory forms. MHC also developed and tested a working prototype
online inventory form mapping tool, as a first phase in the development of a web-based interface
for completing inventory forms.

The addition of over 10,000 records to the MACRIS database over the period reflected both the
growth in the inventory and the addition of new National Register designations. More
significantly, MHC made major steps toward its long-held goal of making digital images of its
paper inventory files and photographs accessible through the MACRIS interface. MHC staff
developed and tested a work-flow strategy for digital scanning of its inventory files, and
succeeded in obtaining the support of a Preserve America Grant from the National Park Service
to support its digitization efforts. With this work ongoing, MHC developed and launched an
updated MACRIS interface on its web site, allowing users to search, view, save, and print digital
images of inventory forms as they are converted in the ongoing scanning project.
Historic Property Survey Planning
MHC continued its pilot project to assist select communities in western Massachusetts prepare
historic property survey plans. In 2007, a historic property survey plan was completed for the
Town of Heath. While directly useful to the town of Heath, the model has been distributed
widely around the state for use by other communities. Additionally, this pilot project provided
recommendations for the next phase of survey plans, the survey planning website. As an
outgrowth of its western Massachusetts initiative, MHC developed a Reconnaissance Survey
Planning Website to provide local historical commissions with an online interface for entering
and uploading street addresses, digital photographs, historical information and notes. Building
on the survey plan methodology developed by MHC Staff for the towns of Granby and Heath,
the website offers local historical commissions a method of organizing and reviewing basic
property by property survey information. After the website was developed, two interns assisted
with community-wide digital photography in select communities. The website is available to
any community with survey needs interested in planning a survey project.
Mid 20th Century Resources
In the town of Lincoln, Friends of Modern Architecture (FoMA) has funded a project to survey
the town’s significant collection of mid-20th century modernist residences and is working with
the Lincoln Public Library to begin the process of providing archival material to the library.
FoMA has also been in touch with the neighboring towns of Lexington and Concord, and with
Historic New England (which has also initiated information gathering on modernist architecture
throughout the region) to provide or share historical information. Elsewhere, the Cape Cod
Modern House Trust was incorporated in 2007 to promote the documentation and preservation of
significant examples of Modernist architecture on the Outer Cape. In the City of Boston, the
Boston Preservation Alliance and the New England
Chapter of DoCoMoMo have advocated for the reexamination of important local mid-century buildings, and
the Boston Landmarks Commission undertook such a
review as part of the first phase of its survey update of the
city’s Central Business District.
2. Evaluating and Registering Historic and
Archaeological Resources
Listings During the Last Planning Cycle
The number of nominations completed and properties
listed in the NR diminished since the publication of the last Leverett Center National Register
District listed in 2008.
State Plan, but there were nevertheless a number of major
achievements. More than 165 nominations were completed, documenting the significance of

more than 4,700 contributing resources. Ten communities saw their first National Register
listings ever during the 2006-2010 period, and almost all were achieved with local funding.
These included: districts in Brimfield, Boxborough, Heath, Holbrook, Leverett, and Plympton;
individual properties in Rochester, Shutesbury, and Southwick; and a municipal park in West
Bridgewater. Large districts in several communities contributed to the high volume of listed
properties, including town center districts in Brimfield, Dedham, Leicester, Millville, Medway,
Winthrop, secondary areas of development in Marshfield, Middleborough, Sandwich,
Westborough, and Weymouth and sizable expansions of early listings in the centers of Sandwich
and Shelburne Falls. In all, some 56 districts were listed during the period since the last State
Plan. Most were initiated by local historical commissions and were funded with largely local
resources. Community Preservation Act funds aided district nominations in two communities
(Dedham and Marshfield) and individual nominations in several others (including Duxbury,
Groton and Wellesley).
Middlesex Canal
One of the most significant accomplishments was the listing of the Middlesex Canal, a linear
district of some 225 contributing resources in nine municipalities, primarily archaeological sites.
The 2009 designation, the result of collaboration between the MHC, the Middlesex Canal
Commission, and the Middlesex Canal Association, updated and expanded a very early
nomination that had listed only a portion of the canal’s 27-mile-long route; the revised
nomination incorporated recent scholarship on the canal, one of the most significant engineering
achievements of the early Republic.
National Register and Federal Investment Tax Credits
While many National Register nominations were primarily for honor and recognition, incentive
programs prompted a sizable number of listings, another major accomplishment. National
Register listings in support of federal investment historic rehabilitation tax credits comprised a
significant portion of the nominations completed since the last plan—almost fifty professionally
prepared nominations were listed as part of a certified rehabilitation project.
National Register and Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund
Seventeen nominations for properties owned by municipalities or private nonprofits resulted in
applications to the Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund during the period.
Under-Recognized Property Types Listed
During the period since publication of the last plan, interest in listing previously underrecognized property types continued to grow. Three individual properties were added to the
National Register through the Underground Railroad context. Other properties associated with
African Americans in Massachusetts were added to the National Register, including one district,
the Myrtle Baptist Church Historic District in Newton, that is comprised of the remnants of a
largely African American neighborhood that was partially lost in the 1960s with the construction
of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Other properties included: the Samuel Harrison House in
Pittsfield, the home of Rev. Harrison, chaplain for the 54th “Glory” Brigade, former slave and
eloquent spokesman for racial equality; and two churches, the Bethel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Plymouth and the Clinton African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in
Great Barrington. Long overlooked, historic properties associated with Native Americans were
also of considerable interest during the period since the last state plan. The Vanderhoop
Homestead, Aquinnah, and the Sachem Rock Farm, East Bridgewater, both listed in the National
Register in 2006, hold associations with the Wampanoag Tribe, while several pending
nominations are significant for their associations with the Nipmuc Tribe. The MHC has

collaborated with the State Department of Conservation and Recreation on a nomination, still
pending at the time of the publication of the State Plan, for the Wachusett Mountain Historic
District, a state-owned property with numerous areas of significance, including associations with
the Nipmuc Nation. The nomination supports the significance of Wachusett Mountain as a
Traditional Cultural Property. Another pending nomination, for the Hassanamisco Reservation
in Grafton, also documents the significance of a property associated with the Nipmuc tribe.
20th Century Properties
Interest in mid 20th century resources grew considerably during this period. National Register
staff at the MHC participated in an ongoing National Park Service project to develop a context
for modernist residential buildings of the outer Cape Cod. The context will lead to the National
Register designation of a number of architecturally significant modernist properties in the region,
including several located within the Cape Cod National Seashore.
Survey and Planning Grants for National Register Nominations
The MHC’s Survey & Planning grant program funded five communities’ National Register
nominations during the period. The New Bedford CLG significantly revised and updated an
early nomination for the County Street Historic District, originally listed in 1976, to more fully
address the area’s economic, social, and ethnic history, and nominated an important city
property, Hazelwood Park. The town of Bedford’s CLG prepared nominations for two districts
and a town-owned cemetery. More recently, the Oxford Center Historic District (NR listing
pending) adds some 220 contributing resources to the National Register. And in Lexington, a
context for mid-century modern residential buildings, to be accompanied by one National
Register district nomination (NR pending), will lay the groundwork for additional nominations
of eligible properties in a community that grew enormously during the decades following the
Second World War.
Cumulative Listings
At the end of 2010, Massachusetts remained a national leader in the NR program, with more than
3,800 listings since the start of the program in 1966, including close to 1,700 National Register
Historic Districts and approximately 77,000 contributing resources.
3. Protecting Historic & Archaeological Resources through State & Federal Regulations
State and Federal Reviews at the Massachusetts Historical Commission
MHC continued its extensive review of projects under state and federal law. The federal law
most widely employed to help protect historic resources is Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act. Similar to Section 106 for federal projects, state funded, licensed, or permitted
projects or projects undertaken by a state agency are reviewed by the Massachusetts Historical
Commission through State Register review regulations. Under Section 106, MHC reviewed
approximately 2,000 projects each year. Under State Register review, MHC reviewed
approximately 10,000 state projects each year. Through additional programmatic agreements
with other agencies, review commitments for some projects were minimized. Additionally,
MHC has developed historic covenant language for disposition of historically significant state
properties. MHC responded to issues of historic gravestone and permit applications for stone
conservation.
The vast majority of projects reviewed by the MHC do not result in adverse effects to historic
and archaeological properties. For instance, in 2009, the MHC reviewed 2,932 federal projects,
only 56 or 2.3% of which had adverse effects on historic resources. Similarly, in 2009, MHC
reviewed 9,087 state projects, 148 or 1.6% of which had adverse effects. Thus, roughly 98% of

projects MHC reviewed have not impacted significant historic
resources. In cases where there is no feasible alternative to avoid a
significant site, MHC has overseen archaeological data recovery
efforts, which has resulted in the preservation of archaeological data
and proper curation of artifacts and records. Data recovery efforts
also include disseminating information to the public. An excellent
example is the African Meeting House on Beacon Hill with its
report, lectures, exhibit and MHC Archaeology Month poster for
2006.
Preservation Restrictions under MGL Chapter 184
MHC continued to fulfill its statutory review and approval role for
preservation restrictions held by qualified organizations and
governmental bodies under M.G.L. Chapter 184, sections 31-33.
Perpetual preservation restrictions remain an important and effective
African Meeting House, Boston
protective mechanism. The requirement of preservation restrictions
as a condition of local Community Preservation grants, and the
continued interest in the available federal tax deduction for the donation of perpetual
preservation restrictions on qualified properties have meant that the volume of restrictions
coming to MHC for statutory approval has continued to grow significantly. Adding to this
volume has been an increased use of preservation restrictions in planning contexts as a condition
for the issuing of zoning variances, special permits, subdivision approvals or land transfers
related to historic properties. MHC continues to administer preservation restrictions that it holds,
responding to an average four to five requests per month for review and approval of proposed
activities. Among local preservation organizations, the Nantucket Preservation Trust has
developed an active preservation restriction program, to date covering fourteen properties,
including eight with interior protections.
State Building Code
MHC continued providing technical assistance regarding partially preserved and totally
preserved status relative to the Massachusetts Building Code Section 3409. These designations
provide some exemptions from the state building code in order to meet the needs of historic
preservation coupled with public safety.
4. Protecting Archaeological Sites
MHC reviews
In MHC review of projects, MHC has consulted with developers and project proponents to
consider ways to avoid and protect significant sites. There have been many cases of project redesign to avoid impacting sites and to protect the sites from construction-related impacts. In
addition, a number of sites have been placed under a preservation restriction for permanent
protection such as at the Grafton State Hospital. The MHC has advocated for the acquisition of
archaeological sites by towns or non-profit land trusts. Numerous sites and archaeologically
sensitive areas have been purchased for conservation. In consultation with the Commission on
Indian Affairs, Tribes, and Wampanoag Confederation on Repatriation, the Massachusetts
Historical Commission upheld the State Unmarked Burial Law.

State Archaeologist Permits
Approximately 100 state archaeologist permits were issued each year for archaeological
investigations.
Bibliography of Archaeological Survey and Mitigation Reports
MHC updated the bibliography of archaeological survey and mitigation reports. This is available
for distribution on a CD and by paper copy.
Archaeology Month
In cooperation with many local
organizations hosting events, MHC
publicized statewide archaeology month
events through an event calendar brochure
and the distribution of an archaeology
month poster. In 2008 alone, there were 69
events in 35 communities.
5. Protecting Historic Resources through
Financial Support
Federal Investment Tax Credits and State
Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit
Massachusetts continues to rank in the upper third of states in terms of number of dollars spent
on rehabilitation projects under the Federal Investment Tax Credit program. The State Historic
Rehabilitation Tax credit, although capped at $50 million, has resulted in a significant increase in
federal investment tax credit applications. Staff at MHC presented the tax credit program at the
Traditional Building Conference and at Department of Housing and Community Development
Conferences. Set to expire in 2011, the state historic rehabilitation tax credit was recently
extended until 2017. The State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit program has grown in
popularity, especially during the past few years of economic downturn. In the calendar year
2009 alone, 76 projects were awarded historic tax credits. Of those, 54 projects created a total of
701 residential rental units, 46% of which were affordable housing. There is considerable
partnering with the state’s low-income housing tax credit and new market tax credits. Over
5,000 temporary and 9,000 permanent jobs were created in 2009. For every dollar awarded in
state historic tax credits, private investment has been leveraged at ten times that amount.
Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund
The Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund (MPPF) is a 50 % matching grant reimbursement
program established in 1984 for the preservation of historic properties, landscapes, and sites
(cultural resources) that are listed in the
State Register of Historic Places which are
either under municipal or nonprofit
ownership. Since the reinstatement of the
MPPF program in August 1994, sixteen
grant rounds have been administered and
nearly $42 million has been awarded in the
form of 657 grant actions. Grants for predevelopment, development, acquisition,
and emergency work have been awarded to
503 historic resources in 190 communities

within the Commonwealth. This represents an estimated total investment (with matching funds)
of roughly $84 million. During the most recent 5-year period, $5.65 million has been awarded in
the form of 142 grant actions. The majority of grantees request funding assistance for the
stabilization, repair, and restoration of the exterior building envelope typically involving roofing
repair/replacement, foundation rebuilding, masonry repointing, carpentry repairs, window
restoration, drainage systems repair/replacement, and painting. As a condition of funding,
property owners must execute and record an interior and exterior MHC Preservation Restriction
on the property’s deeded parcel of land. This ensures that the resource will retain its historic
character and integrity—long after the MHC-funded project is complete—through a formal
design review and approval process by MHC staff. The MPPF is a highly recognizable and
popular grant program frequently resulting in dramatic, visible improvements to historically and
architecturally significant resources throughout the Commonwealth.
Community Preservation Act
Since its passage in 2000, 147 communities have adopted the Community Preservation Act. The
CPA is a local option state law that helps communities preserve their open spaces and historic
sites, create affordable housing, and develop outdoor recreational facilities. CPA allows

Historic agricultural landscape in Groton protected through community preservation act funds.

communities to create a local Community Preservation Fund with money raised through
a surcharge of up to 3% on local property taxes. The state provides guaranteed annual CPA
matching funds based on these local surcharge collections,
providing a significant incentive to communities to pass the Act.
These combined funds are then available for use by adopting
municipalities on community projects in open space protection,
historic preservation, and the creation of affordable housing and
outdoor recreation. Within these 147 communities, historic
preservation is by far the most popular category of possible uses
of CPA - over $200 million in CPA funds have been appropriated
for use on more than 2,083 Historic Preservation projects. CPA
funds have been used to provide accessibility to historic buildings,
protect historic landscapes, restore farmhouses, churches, and
town halls as well as preserve historic documents. In some
communities, historic preservation and affordable housing have
been combined into one project. In other places, historic
preservation and open space preservation have resulted in preservation of a farmhouse with the
accompanying agricultural open space.

MHC Survey and Planning Grants
The MHC Survey and Planning grant program has very successfully provided CLGs and local
commissions with matching grants for historic property survey, national register nominations,
preservation plans, and public education projects. Over the past five years, MHC allocated
$651,540 to this program. With the local matches, the figure grows to $1,094,800 in funding for
historic preservation projects. During FY 2007, the survey and planning grant program was open
to all municipalities not just certified local governments. During this year, 19 projects received
funding.
National Trust for Historic Preservation Grants
Since 2005, the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) has awarded $1,485,096 in grants to 74
non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and public agencies in the state of Massachusetts.
Grantees are located in 47 municipalities within the state. Funds were used to support a variety of
planning, educational, and construction projects. In 2009, the Partners in Preservation Program, sponsored
by American Express in cooperation with NTHP, provided $1 million in preservation funding and greatly
raised the profile of preservation needs statewide.

Preserve America Grants
This federal program provides grant funding for projects that focus on economic and educational
opportunities related to heritage tourism. Examples of funded projects in Massachusetts included
promotional and marketing strategies for Gloucester and Lowell.
Save America’s Treasures Grants
Administered by the National Park Service, the Save America’s Treasures grant program
provides funding for nationally significant structures and sites. This matching grant program has
funded projects including the Colonel James Barrett House in Concord, the United First Parish
Church in Quincy, the Frederick Ayer Mansion in Boston, and Old Ship Meetinghouse in
Hingham.
Regional Grant Programs
John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor Commission–Heritage
Partnership Grant Program and the Essex National Heritage Area - Essex Heritage Partnership
Grant Program offered grants to member communities for historic preservation purposes.
6. Protecting Historic Resources through Assisting Local Governments
Historic Preservation E-mail List
Administered by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, masshistpres is a statewide listserve
with over seven hundred subscribers across the state. It remains a very active list made up of
local preservation commission members, preservation professionals, architects, consultants,
archaeologists, planners, and many others. The opportunity to learn, discuss, and offer advice in
a statewide digital format made up of volunteers and professionals provides a rich environment
for networking and information sharing.
New Outreach Material for Local Preservation Commissions
Over the past five years, the Massachusetts Historical Commission completed two DVDs for
local commission members. Local Historical Commissions in Massachusetts is a 50 minute
DVD covering all the basics of historic preservation planning. Local Historic Districts in
Massachusetts is a 1 ½ hour DVD covering how local historic districts protect historic resources,
the history of local historic districts, how to establish local historic districts, design review in
local historic districts, and proper administration of local historic districts. In 2008, MHC started
the Local Preservation Update E-Newsletter, a brief newsletter for local commissions covering
grant opportunities, upcoming workshops, new national register listings, websites to visit, and

other pertinent information for local commission members. Distribution of the electronic
newsletter has grown to approximately 2000 people. Preservation through Bylaws and
Ordinances – Tools and Techniques Used in Massachusetts was thoroughly revised with many
new case studies from around the state.
Local Commission Training Workshops
Over 70 MHC On the Road workshops were offered to local historical commissions, historic
district commissions, local historic district study committees, and the general public during this
planning cycle. The MHC On the Road Program includes modules on Introduction to Historic
Preservation Planning, Demolition Delay Bylaws, Establishing Local Historic Districts, and the
Certified Local Government Program. A workshop on the Secretary of the Interior Standards,
prepared by MHC staff, was also delivered at several conferences. The Historic
District/Historical Commission Committee of Preservation Massachusetts also developed and
delivered modules on Preparing MHC Inventory Forms and The National Register of Historic
Places.
Circuit Rider Program
The Preservation Massachusetts Circuit Rider Program, in partnership with the National Trust
for Historic Preservation, has funded three part-time circuit riders that have provided assistance
to local commissions, property owners, and concerned citizens regarding historic preservation in
their community. Services have included advocacy letters, grants, and access to information on
a wide range of topics. The three circuit riders are regionally focused with one circuit rider for
western/central Massachusetts, the greater Boston region, and Southeastern Massachusetts/Cape
Cod/Islands.
Department of Conservation and Recreation Heritage Landscape Inventory
During this planning cycle, the Department of Conservation and Recreation continued its
successful partnership with cities and towns in preparing heritage landscape inventory
reconnaissance reports. These reports identified valued heritage landscapes, discussed issues
with their preservation, and provided recommendations for their protection. During this
planning cycle, the program worked with 63 communities to identify 3,941 heritage landscapes
in the Freedoms Way, Blackstone/Quinebaug-Shetucket, Upper Quaboag/North Quabbin and
Connecticut River Valley areas.
Regional Planning Agency Preservation Planners
The Cape Cod Commission and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission have staff preservation
planners that assist local governments. At the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission,
preservation planning staff has completed inventory forms, national register nominations, local
historic district planning, tax credit application assistance, and public education projects such as
tours and booklets. In addition, PVPC reviewed housing rehabilitation projects under Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Local Archaeological Review
As requested, MHC was able to provide technical assistance to local governments on how to
develop archaeological reviews in local regulatory programs.
7. Protecting Historic Resources through Local Government Actions
Local Regulations
Historic preservation bylaws and ordinances at the local level increased during the past five
years. There are now 127 municipalities with a demolition delay bylaw or ordinance, an increase
from 108 five years ago. While most delay periods remain at 6 months, there are now twenty-

Local historic districts continue to increase more modestly
with most additions in communities with existing local
historic districts. The city of Holyoke established their first
local historic district on Fairfield Avenue. Several
communities established architectural preservation districts
including North Andover and Wellesley.
Public Education and Advocacy
Many local historical commissions recognized that public

success in preserving threatened resources by speaking out
and mobilizing residents.
Reactivated Local Historical Commissions
Several communities with inactive local historical commissions were reactivated during this
period such as Alford, Athol, Leyden, Richmond, and West Stockbridge. Most notable is Athol
which applied for and received a survey and planning grant for survey work in their downtown.
New Certified Local Governments
As the survey and planning grant program was largely limited to certified local governments,
interest in the program grew. Many communities inquired about the process of becoming a
certified local government. The town of Lexington submitted the application material and
became a Certified Local Government in 2009.
8. Protecting the Rural Historic Landscape
Agricultural Lands
Between 2002 and 2007, the number of farms and farm revenue increased dramatically in
Massachusetts, up over twenty seven percent. Amazingly, there was no net loss of farmland
during this time period. With
special assistance programs such
as the Farm Viability program,
the Department of Agricultural
Resources directly assisted many
farmers while at the same time
protecting farmland for the future.
In 2009, the Agricultural
Preservation Program recorded its
750th restriction. Over the past 30
years, more than 63,000 acres of
farmland have been protected.
Barns Program
Agricultural land located in the town of Gill
The Preservation Massachusetts
Preserve Mass Barns Program held three successful regional conferences for owners of historic
barns. In addition, information and resources for barn owners was placed on the Preservation
Massachusetts website.

Agricultural Commissions
From its introduction ten years ago, there are now over 100 cities and towns with an agricultural
commission. Through representing the agriculture community, agricultural commissions have
provided an advocacy voice for farmers, helped resolve conflicts, offered new markets for
products, put forward right-to-farm bylaws, and held educational workshops. All of these efforts
help to protect farmland and preserve rural landscape.
Massachusetts Land Trust Coalition
The Trustees of Reservations opened their 100th property, Cormier Woods, in 2008. Located in
Uxbridge, Cormier Woods is a 175-acre rural farmstead dating back to the early eighteenth
century.
Scenic Byways Projects
Scenic byway projects during this planning cycle included 6 corridor management plans and 3
land protection projects.
9. Protecting Historic and Archaeological Resources from Detrimental Natural Processes
MHC represented the historic preservation perspective on the advisory committee for a
significant, ongoing statewide disaster planning project to develop an Emergency Management
Framework for Cultural Resources – Coordinated Statewide Emergency Preparedness
(COSTEP), a significant pilot project led by the Northeast Document Conservation Center, the
Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, and the Massachusetts Archives. The pilot has
successfully raised the profile of cultural resources and their special needs in disaster planning
among the emergency management community, and has also brought greater understanding of
the emergency response framework to the cultural resources community. Participants in the
COSTEP project have included state and federal level emergency managers, and representatives
of the museum, library, archives, and records management communities.
10. Revitalizing and Protecting Historic Urban
and Industrial Areas
Federal and State Tax Credits
The federal and state tax credits provided
financial incentives to rehabilitate sites throughout
Massachusetts particularly in urban and industrial
areas. A study in 2009 by Preservation
Massachusetts concluded that the credits had a
catalyzing impact on many communities across
the Commonwealth.
11. Encouraging Historic Preservation through
Heritage Tourism
Visitors to Massachusetts
Massachusetts remains a very popular destination for heritage tourists due to its history,
significant historic sites, interpretation and access. According to the Massachusetts Cultural
Council, historic/cultural tourism generated nearly $2 billion in 2006. Tourism is the third
largest industry in Massachusetts supporting 120,000 jobs. Findings by MCC conclude that tax
dollars in Massachusetts when invested in historic/cultural travel have a more than 5:1 return on
investment. Cultural tourism includes arts, heritage, recreational, and natural resources. It is the

fastest growing sector of the travel industry. Cultural tourists spend considerably more per day
than other tourists and stay one half day longer at each destination.
Preserve America Communities
There are now twenty Preserve America Communities in Massachusetts. These are Blackstone,
Douglas, Falmouth, Gloucester, Grafton, Holyoke, Hopedale, Leicester, Lowell, Mendon,
Millbury, Millville, Northbridge, Plymouth, Salem, Springfield, Sutton, Upton, Uxbridge,
Worcester. Preserve America designations provide recognition for local efforts in the
appreciation and protection of historic resources and offer new avenues for enhancing heritage
tourism.
Distinctive Destinations
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has now recognized five communities in
Massachusetts as distinctive destinations. These are Chatham, Lowell, Northampton,
Provincetown, and Salem. This program recognizes both the preservation efforts of the
community and the memorable experiences for the visitor.
Heritage Areas and Corridors
The Blackstone River Valley, Quinebaug/Shetucket, Housatonic, Essex, and the newest heritage
area, Freedoms Way all marketed interesting events that highlighted the resources in their region.
Historic Places for Historic Parties
The Massachusetts Historical Commission began revising the popular handbook, Historic Places
for Historic Parties. This booklet lists the many venues around the state for hosting an event.
Scenic Byways
Administered by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the number of scenic byways
around the state increased to fifteen with Battle Road: The Road to Revolutions Scenic Byway
and Route 116 Scenic Byway established during this planning cycle. All fifteen scenic byways
offer marketing opportunities that encourage heritage tourism with their
interesting places to visit. Specific heritage tourism projects included
the western MA byways promotional campaign and the interpretive
signage and wayfinding on Jacob’s Ladder Trail.
12. Strengthening the Stewardship of Historic and Archaeological
Resources
Local and State Funding Programs
As mentioned previously, the Massachusetts Preservation Project Fund,
the Community Preservation Act, and the tax credit programs have
greatly assisted in the rehabilitation of significant historic resources
throughout the state.
Historic Curatorship Program
A window removed for

and Recreation (DCR) has generated over $10 million in private
investment at sixteen properties. Through this program, DCR partners with curators who agree
to rehabilitate, manage, and maintain historic properties within the state park system in exchange
for long-term leases.
Public and Private Property Owners
Often unrecognized are the many public and privately owned historic resources where
stewardship is ongoing and where annual funding is allocated for proper maintenance. Whether
it is a municipality diligently maintaining their town hall year after year, a homeowner reglazing
a wood window, or one of the thousands of historic property owners statewide with a plan in

place to care for their own resource, each one constitutes a stewardship success worth noting
here.
13. Protecting Historic Resources through Education and Public Awareness
Statewide Preservation Coalition
Organized by Preservation Massachusetts, the preservation coalition is made up of state,
regional, and local partners. It continues to serve the preservation community by providing a
strong collective voice when needed.
Homeowner Education
The membership based Historic Homeowner Program at Historic New England provides
homeowners with individualized assistance through the expertise of HNE professional staff on
paint colors, maintenance, design, and construction. The Springfield Preservation Trust offers a
list of contractors on their website.
Contractor Education
The Nantucket Preservation Trust Apprenticeship Program provides funds and educational
programs geared to contractors, builders, preservationists, and students to learn traditional
building methods.
Most Endangered Program of Preservation
Massachusetts
Over the past five years, this annual program
has provided a venue to recognize significant
historic resources threatened by demolition,
development, neglect or policies. As was the
case with the threatened Ames Shovel Shop in
Easton listed in 2008, the accompanying
publicity was a contributing factor in saving
this property from demolition.
Plaques and Marker Programs
Over 60 communities have a historical plaque
program with many communities such as
The Ames Shovel Shop in Easton

Lowell, Salem, and Nantucket actively using plaque
programs to recognize historic preservation activities,
increase owner appreciation and educate visitors.
Preservation Awards
Organizations such as the Massachusetts Historical
Commission, Preservation Massachusetts, Boston
Preservation Alliance, the New England Chapter of
The Whitin Mill complex in Northbridge was the the Victorian Society all have developed annual
recipient of an MHC Preservation Award.
Preservation Award programs to recognize projects
and people that have contributed to historic
preservation. In addition, many local commissions or non-profit organizations also have
preservation award programs. Together, the awards and events provide excellent opportunities
for education through the local media.

Walking and Driving Tours
Many local commissions, societies, and groups organize walking tours to highlight interesting
architecture, neighborhoods or sites. Tour topics offered in the city of Boston included
immigration, industry, archaeology, burial grounds, and many more. Technology is providing
new methods of offering on demand tours through hand held devices. The city of Lowell has
offered a very successful annual program, Doors
Open Lowell, which provides access to many
buildings and sites not typically open to the
public.
DCR Terra Firma Bulletins
The Department of Conservation and Recreation
(DCR) prepared a series of six educational
bulletins on preservation topics such as historic
roads, farms and town commons.
Modern Architecture
In order to raise awareness of modern
architecture, organizations such as the Friends of Modern Architecture/Lincoln, DOCOMOMONew England Chapter, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the Cape Cod Modern
House Trust have organized lectures, tours, forums, and symposia. FOMA/Lincoln offered a
panel discussions regarding the repair and upkeep of Modern houses allowing opportunities for
participation by attendees and the sharing of information.
Historic Property Survey Forms on the Massachusetts Historical Commission Website
Historic Property Information on the MHC website improved greatly with the introduction of the
first set of scanned inventory forms uploaded to the website. This project began with a scanning
plan and a pilot project to test methodology and technical standards. With support from a two
year Preserve America grant, scanning of MHC inventory forms began in 2009. In early 2010,
the first set of inventory forms with photographs were available on the MHC website.
Scanning National Register Nominations
The Massachusetts Historical Commission developed protocols for scanning National Register
nominations for posting on the website. The nominations from 1999 to the present have been
scanned and new nominations are scanned as they are completed. Posting these National
Register nominations on the website has been completed.
Massachusetts Historical Commission Publications
Numerous MHC publications were distributed during this planning cycle such as the annual
State Register of Historic Places, Preservation Planning Manual, Preservation through Bylaws
and Ordinances, Establishing Local Historic Districts, A Guidebook for Historic District
Commissions, and Archaeology Month calendars.

Greening the Older Home Workshops
During 2009, Historic New England, the Massachusetts Historical Commission, and the National
Trust for Historic Preservation-Northeast Office began offering a workshop on Greening the
Historic Home. Overall themes in the
workshop included windows, insulation, and
renewable energy. The workshops were well
attended and presented in Salem,
Newburyport, Medford, and Harwich.
Preservation and Sustainability Forum
During 2010, The Boston Preservation
Alliance convened a focus group to
investigate new methods of collaboration
between the historic preservation and green
building community on research methods,
marketing, and education.
15. Including diverse cultural and ethnic
communities in historic preservation.
Neighborhood Preservation Partnership
An exciting initiative over the past two years has been undertaken by the Boston Preservation
Alliance and Historic Boston Incorporated. Working in the neighborhoods of Boston, efforts
have included supporting historic property owners with technical assistance, offering a forum to
discuss what the neighborhood needs regarding historic and cultural resources and fostering
connections between the neighborhoods and city government. This has been accomplished
through two circuit riders dedicated to providing preservation assistance.

The Challenges Ahead
While the past five years has brought many accomplishments, challenges remain in the
preservation of the historical and cultural resources of Massachusetts. Utilizing the same
categories from the Major Accomplishments section, this section focuses on where those
challenges remain.
1. Identifying and Documenting Historic and Archaeological Resources
Survey Activity
While survey activity during the 2006-2010 period increased over that reported in the last 5-year
plan, survey activity is still much reduced from the 1990s. This appears largely the result of
state-level budget constraints that greatly limited the amount and availability of MHC Survey
and Planning grants during much of this time, though this was partially offset by the increased
availability of Community Preservation funds to support survey projects.
Communities with Outstanding Survey Needs
There remain 128 communities identified by Massachusetts Historical Commission as having
specific outstanding survey needs.
Many Community-wide Surveys Are Not Up-to-date
There are many communities that have not revisited their surveys in 25 or 30 years. The
documentation on the existing forms may be inadequate for current standards and coverage may
be insufficient. The development of a communitywide survey plan would be a particularly
important first step for communities with little or no survey. Plans are needed that target priority
properties for survey, identify significant historic themes, and establish a phased approach to
completing the identified goals. Plans and surveys need to address the full range of local
resources by type, period, theme, and location.
Local Historical Commissions
It is essential that local historical commissions develop plans for an active and ongoing program
to initiate, maintain, update, and expand their communitywide inventory of historic and
archaeological resources using MHC guidelines and inventory forms in accordance with NPS
standards for the identification and evaluation of cultural resources. As the local organization
responsible for historic preservation planning, the inventory should be the local historical
commission’s highest priority.
Funding Survey Projects
The major impediment to increasing the level of survey statewide is the lack of funding. While
many communities that have passed the community preservation act, have hired a professional
consultant directly or used CPA funds for a matching survey and planning grant, numerous
towns have struggled to find the funding for professional survey assistance. Over the past few
years, MHC grants have been typically limited to CLGs leaving non-CLG communities with no
grant opportunities. During the upcoming planning cycle, it is hoped that the survey and
planning grant program can be opened to non-CLGs.
Technical Assistance, Training and Support
In particular for those local historical commissions interested in preparing a survey plan or
completing survey forms themselves, there is a great need for additional technical assistance and

training. In cooperation with the Massachusetts Historical Commission, Preservation
Massachusetts prepared a powerpoint presentation on preparing inventory forms. Plans to
continue offering this useful workshop statewide are needed. At the Massachusetts Historical
Commission, a new and updated Historic Property Survey Manual is needed that reflects changes
in survey methods and technologies, including digital photography, GIS mapping, and internetbased research.
Professional Survey Contractors
With the majority of inventory forms submitted by professional historic preservation consultants,
it is essential that training and support is offered that sustains an active community of
professional survey contractors that can maintain high standards of field documentation and
research.
Public and Non-Profit Owned Resources
Municipal, state and federal agencies, non-profit land holding organizations, including regional
and local conservation land trusts own many historic and archaeological resources. In many
cases, these properties do not have adequate survey. New methods of encouraging survey of
public and non-profit owned resources are greatly needed.
Thematic Surveys
Under-represented in the historic resource inventories statewide are certain thematic resource
types including historic industry-related resources, agricultural resources and rural historic
landscapes, transportation and service infrastructure, commercial properties, designed
landscapes, resources with ethnic associations, properties associated with African-American
history, properties associates with Native Americans, and mid-20th century resources. While
several municipalities have initiated reconnaissance-level surveys of ancient and historic
archaeological resources in their communities, most statewide lack this level of information.
While particularly useful, challenges to completing thematic survey include multiple
jurisdictions as one thematic survey may include numerous municipalities.
2. Evaluating and Registering Historic and Archaeological Resources
Every year, MHC evaluates some 110-120 properties for their National Register eligibility. And
every year, MHC’s NR staff reviews, processes, and moves toward completion on average about
35 nominations, while double that number comprise a backlog of nominations awaiting review,
editing, additional research, and/or final processing. Funding
at both the local and state levels is a factor in the
considerable backlog. At the local level, commissions do not
have the funds necessary to hire a professional preservation
consultant to prepare the nomination, meaning more time
must be spent at the state level to produce a final nomination
that meets the NPS’s standards. At MHC, staff and funding
constraints both limit the number of nominations that can be
reviewed annually and brought to the State Review Board.
Nevertheless, interest in the National Register program
Maritime resources in Fairhaven
continues to grow, since the program is central to
preservation planning activities statewide and the access
point for limited protection and grants opportunities for historic and cultural resources. While
the volume of National Register nominations continues at a high level, a remarkable number of
cities and towns in Massachusetts have yet to see listings of any of their historic resources in the

Packet Pg. 621

National Register. Among the two dozen communities still without any NR listings since the last
plan, several have expressed interest in designation of one or more of their town’s historic
resources, even if those nominations have yet to be developed. These include the towns of
Bellingham, Carver, Chilmark, Oakham, Otis, and Wales. The MHC remains committed, where
possible, to facilitating nominations in such communities.
Older Nominations
With National Register listings as far back as 1966, Massachusetts has many early nominations.
While national and state standards for registration have changed, nominations from the mid
1980s and earlier need improved documentation to meet current preservation planning needs and
updated information to reflect current conditions. In addition, extending the period of
significance for early nominations is needed which will recognize many more contributing
resources.
Additional Education is Needed
There remains a need for additional training for local historical commissions and the general
public on the benefits and the process of listing properties in the National Register of Historic
Places. Designation in the National Register provides recognition, increases awareness of
historic and cultural resources, provides limited protection, and access to grant and funding
opportunities. Therefore, it is essential to provide access to the National Register listing process
through venues such as the Preservation Massachusetts training module.
Modernism
The resources of the mid 20th century, including suburban neighborhoods, commercial,
institutional, and civic structures, individual residences, and mid 20th century landscapes are
among the region’s least appreciated and most threatened historic resources. Expressions of
modernism are found in
Massachusetts as early as the
1920s, and examples continued
into the 1970s. Interest is
growing across the state in
recognizing these now-fragile
resources. Context studies are
presently in development for midcentury modern residences of the
Outer Cape, and for individual
houses and subdivisions in the
An example of modernist residential housing located in Lincoln
town of Lexington. It is expected
that over the next five years, a number of National Register nominations for modern residential
properties in these and other communities will be submitted. Other property types associated
with rapid postwar development—for example, schools, commercial buildings, defense-related
resources, transportation-related resources—also would be well served in terms of the National
Register program by increased context development to allow for more informed evaluations and
the protective and recognition opportunities that can come with National Register eligibility. One
very common property type will present a particular challenge in upcoming years—the 20th
century apartment building. In urban areas such as Boston and Springfield, thousands of
apartment buildings were erected in the early 20th century. With incentive opportunities for
historic rehabilitation, more examples of this property type are being presented for evaluation
and registration. Without context development, evaluation is challenging. The MHC expects to

collaborate with consultants and communities in development of context that will help
understand the significance and registration requirements of this common property type.
New or Little Recognized Property Types
There is additional need to evaluate properties associated with Native American tribes, AfricanAmerican, Portuguese, and other ethnic groups for whom few historic and cultural resources are
presently designated.
3. Protecting Historic & Archaeological Resources through State & Federal Regulations
Review and Compliance at the Massachusetts Historical Commission
The review and compliance program is difficult to predict since it depends on many factors
including the economy, finances, real estate market conditions, state/federal/local budgets,
investments as well as others. For instance, the federal economic recovery and stimulus
programs resulted in a 25% increase in MHC project reviews in 2009-2010. MHC responded
quickly to recovery project reviews, in order to assist with the stimulus programs. However,
there was no supplemental funding for hiring additional staff. In fact, the state budget decline
has further exacerbated MHC’s limited staffing problem. Even with these challenges, MHC
continues to use federal and state reviews as effectively as possible to result in preservation and
protection of historic resources.
Monitoring Existing Preservation Restrictions
MHC now holds over 600 preservation restrictions on grant-assisted properties. Updating owner
information, communicating with owners, and monitoring the restrictions on-site all require staff
committed to these tasks. This remains very challenging with limited staff availability at MHC.
Establishing Additional Preservation Restrictions
The demand for preservation restriction technical assistance remains very high as CPA related
preservation restrictions are implemented, as property owners seek to take federal tax deductions
and as organizations expand their easement holding activities. In addition, the resources
proposed for protection with a preservation restriction is highly varied. As each preservation
restriction must be reviewed individually based on the significant features of the resource,
processing the high volume of preservation restriction submittals remains challenging.
4. Protecting Archaeological Sites
Lack of Archaeological Survey
Only a very small percentage of the state has been subjected to an archaeological survey. As a
result, perhaps only 3-5% of the number of
archaeological sites expected to exist are
recorded in MHC’s inventory. Given the lack
of systematic archaeological survey across the
state, identification surveys are a priority
planning activity.
Archaeological Awareness
The general public has a lack of awareness
when it comes to archaeological resources.
Below ground resources may even be
overlooked by those in the preservation
community. Additional public education is

needed on the archaeology of Massachusetts.
Regulations Protecting Archaeological Sites
While MHC may reviews impacts to significant archaeological sites in Massachusetts through
review and compliance activities, most archaeological sites are on privately owned land. When
development does not meet a review and compliance threshold such as federal or state funding,
permitting or licensing, MHC review may be non-existent. Additional planning, education, and
local review are needed to better protect significant archaeological sites.
5. Protecting Historic Resources through Financial Support
Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund
Aside from the challenge of maintaining funding for this program, current challenges for the
MPPF program include developing a revised preservation restriction agreement which will
require a standard of baseline documentation in the form of existing conditions, photographs, and
other record documents. Similarly, the nearly 600 MPPF preservation restrictions, currently held
by the MHC, require the development of a more active covenant monitoring program. Presently,
MHC Grants Division staff is in the midst of notifying all owners of properties with MPPF
preservation restrictions to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities and to update the
MHC with current contact information as well as anticipated project plans.
Community Preservation Act
While the participation in the community preservation act continues to grow, challenges remain
for increasing statewide revenue and increasing local participation from economicallychallenged communities. During the economic downturn, real estate filings dropped
considerably resulting in far less revenue into the community preservation trust fund. From a
100% match several years ago, the average statewide match dropped to 31% in 2010.
Meanwhile, although 147 communities have passed CPA, passage by large, urban communities
as well as less affluent communities has lagged. Stimulating broader participation in CPA
remains critical to extending the preservation benefits of the Act to communities statewide.
Survey and Planning Grants
Due to budgetary constraints, the Survey and Planning
grant program operated at a minimal level during the
2006-2010 period. Except for FY 2007, only Certified
Local Governments were eligible to apply. As a result,
many worthwhile local projects could not be funded.
State and Federal Tax Credits
The state historic preservation tax credit was recently
extended until 2017. Maintaining this tax credit is
essential as the loss of this tax credit would be
devastating. Meanwhile, efforts to remove the $50
million annual cap have been unsuccessful.
20th Century Buildings
Funding challenges will also be present as recent past
buildings from the 20th Century age. Transitional
masonry buildings consisting of structural steel frame,
masonry walls, cast stone, and terra cotta are facing
Financial challenges face many historic

6. Protecting Historic Resources through Assisting Local Governments
Technical Assistance to Local Historical Commissions
While technical assistance to local governments is available through many different avenues
such as MHC guidebooks, handouts, DVDs, phone/e-mail responses, and on-site workshops, the
need for assistance remains greater than what is currently offered through commission training.
Too often, the bar remains high for volunteer commission members to accomplish essential tasks
such as survey, national register nominations, establishing local historic districts or mobilizing an
effort to save a threatened historic resource.
Circuit Rider Program
Although the circuit rider program is providing expertise and information to many local
communities, this program was funded for only a three-year period. Additional funding will be
needed to sustain this assistance program.
Heritage Landscape Inventory Program
The Heritage Landscape Inventory Program, administered through the Department of
Conservation and Recreation is on hold due to state budget cuts. This successful partnership
program between local communities and a state agency was a great loss with its abrupt
termination. Without it, many communities will be unable to identify important landscape
resources
7. Protecting Historic Resources through Local Government Actions
Local Historical Commissions
Historic preservation efforts statewide remain largely at the local level through historical
commissions and historic district commissions. Very few commissions have staff assistance and
so rely almost exclusively on the volunteer efforts of commission members themselves. Local
commissions face many challenges as they remain on the frontline of preservation efforts.
Among their challenges are recruiting new members, assuring adequate municipal funding, and
finding time to accomplish their goals. Many of the all-volunteer, local commissions are
overburdened and unable to establish a strong, effective, and
long-lasting presence in their community. Even though there
are nearly 3000 members that make up the commissions,
they are not well represented.
Inactive Local Historical Commissions
While almost every municipality in Massachusetts has
adopted a local historical commission, it is estimated that 15
% of commissions statewide are not currently active. In
these communities, there may be no one that can advocate for
a threatened resource, recognize the need for preservation
planning, or understand that preservation options and

strategies are available.
advocacy efforts to preserve it.
Demolition Delay Bylaws
An impressive number of communities established a
demolition delay bylaw over the past five years. Yet, there remain 224 cities and towns without
this basic level of regulatory protection. Additionally, most demolition delay bylaws remain at
only six months. This is often an inadequate period of time to seek alternatives to demolition.

4.43.e

36
Packet Pg. 625

Additional demolition delay bylaws are needed and with lengthier delay periods of twelve to
eighteen months.
Local Historic Districts
While 120 cities and towns now have a local historic district, that leaves 231 without the
protection of a local historic district. Furthermore, only a very small geographic area of the state
is actually protected by a local historic district. Most of the historic areas of Massachusetts
remain unprotected. Establishing additional local historic districts and enlarging existing local
historic districts is essential. While local historic districts remain the most effective preservation
tool available, passage of additional local historic districts remains very challenging. It is
estimated that only 10% of appointed local historic district study committees successfully pass a
local historic district through their local legislative body.
Local Historic District Commissions
With the vast majority of the local historic district commissions consisting solely of volunteers
without municipal staff support, district commissions struggle with design review,
administration, public education, and enforcement.
Volunteers Needed
Although not the case in all communities, local historical commissions and historic district
commissions are often facing difficulties in finding qualified, energetic volunteers to serve on
their commissions. As our culture increases its mobility, fewer people have a connection and
commitment to their hometown.
Other Regulatory Tools
While tools such as Architectural Preservation Districts remain an excellent option for cities and
towns interested in protecting neighborhood character without the more stringent design review
regulations of a local historic district, few communities have opted to establish architectural
preservation districts.
8. Protecting the Rural Historic Landscape
Development Trends
A report issued in 2009 by the Massachusetts Audubon Society found that 22 acres of land is
developed each day in Massachusetts with some areas particularly threatened by sprawl
development. While the report found good news that between 1999-2005 Massachusetts
protected more land than it lost to development, the threat to the rural historic landscape is clear.
As the report notes, agricultural land is highly threatened as we continue to build farther from
metropolitan areas. 87% of the development was for residential construction accounting for a
loss of 10,000 acres of agricultural land between 1999 and 2005. Without its agricultural
landscapes, Massachusetts loses a key piece of its character.
9. Protecting Historic and Archaeological Resources from Detrimental Natural Processes
Although Coordinated Statewide Emergency Preparedness (COSTEP) has made excellent
progress in integrating cultural resources into emergency management, they recognize that the
majority of cultural heritage institutions do not have an emergency plan with staff trained to
carry it out. With several recent floods in Massachusetts impacting historic museum collections,
the need for quick action through an emergency plan was acutely noted.
10. Revitalizing and Protecting Historic Urban and Industrial Areas

The majority of residents of Massachusetts live in urban areas. In many ways, the future of
historic preservation in Massachusetts rests with the urban
areas of the state. Large cities, medium sized cities, and
the small industrial villages scattered throughout the state
have the abundance of irreplaceable historic resources. As
manufacturing practices adjust to modern requirements,
many of these places face challenges in funding large-scale
rehabilitation projects and maintaining vibrant
neighborhoods. While urban revitalization success stories
abound, decades of job losses and disinvestment are the
common theme. The result is that many Massachusetts
Multi-family housing in the City of
residents choose new housing constructed on former

agricultural fields or woodlands while opportunities for
infill housing and rehabilitation are unmet. A report by
MassInc and the Brookings Institution released in 2007 focused on 11 historic mill cities and
found many concerns regarding their economic status compared to other areas of the state.
11. Encouraging Historic Preservation through Heritage Tourism
Drawing Additional Heritage Visitors to Massachusetts
There are numerous challenges regarding heritage tourism
particularly during the economic downturn. The state
budget crisis has greatly impacted the funding available to
draw visitors to Massachusetts. In many cases, state
funding for visitor centers has been eliminated. All of the
Visitor Centers on the Massachusetts Turnpike have been
closed. Publication of the Getaway Guide magazine has
Shaker Village, Hancock
ceased. Additionally, grants that encourage visitation to
area attractions have declined or been eliminated. At the
same time, discretionary income has declined bringing fewer travels. Museums have noted that
visitation by school groups has dropped off. All this could have long-lasting implications as the
next generation will have less interest in historic preservation and heritage tourism sites face
increased competition from other recreational venues.
Economic Impact Study
The economic impact study from 2002 clearly demonstrated the enormous impact of heritage
tourism on the economy of Massachusetts. This study is now almost ten years old and more
recent statistics are needed to encourage policies that protect historic resources.
12. Strengthening the Stewardship of Historic and Archaeological Resources
State Government Property
While the Massachusetts Historical Commission does not own any property in the state, many
state agencies do. These include the Department of Conservation and Recreation, Massachusetts
Department of Transportation, and the university system. State owned historic properties include
archaeological sites, buildings, bridges, landscapes, and structures. For properties in the DCR
system, one of the major issues remains deferred maintenance and the lack of funding to properly
maintain buildings and structures. At the MA DOT, challenges include the many historic
bridges in need of rehabilitation or upgrade. An additional concern of note is the need to make

certain that significant state surplused property is only sold with an appropriate preservation
restriction.
Local Government Property
Many of the same concerns noted for state property are also true for
property owned by municipal government such as deferred
maintenance, lack of funding, and disposition of surplus property.
State Government Policies
While most state policies and regulations consider their impacts to
significant historic resources, some state policies remain that do not
adequately take into account historic resources, community character,
and neighborhood revitalization. Of particular concern to many

Building Authority’s Model School Program which encouraged
Lawrence
demolition and new construction over additions and rehabilitation.
Historic Homeowners
Although historic homeowners own the vast majority of the historic resources statewide, there
are few resources to assist them with the stewardship of their property. There are currently no
statewide tax credits, loans or grants available to assist private residential historic homeowners.
Even more troublesome is the fact that finding qualified contractors sensitive and knowledgeable
regarding best practices may be hard to find or entirely unavailable in their geographic area. As
a result, homeowners may be left with few preservation options regarding maintenance of their
property. Aside from efforts at Historic New England, there is essentially no training in
Massachusetts directed to historic homeowners. This is a huge constituency that is not being
reached. Additional training for homeowners including
topics such as lead paint abatement, window repair, energy
efficiency, water infiltration, moisture, architectural details
and local history would be highly beneficial.
13. Protecting Historic Resources through Education
and Public Awareness
Statewide Preservation Coalition
The Statewide Preservation Coalition, made up of
preservation partners around the state, was particularly
effective at advocating for the Massachusetts Historic
Preservation Tax Credit. This broad coalition of local,
regional and state preservation partners could achieve
additional successes.
Utilizing the News Media
While the news media will often publish or broadcast
stories related to historic preservation, the news media is
not effectively utilized by the historic preservation
community. Particularly at the local level, commissions
need training and expertise that can help them develop relationships with news media, prepare
press releases, and respond to inquiries on historic preservation topics. While MHC prepares
press releases for preservation award winners and national register nominations, there are many
additional topics that would appeal to news media outlets and their consumers. The fiftieth

anniversary of the Massachusetts Historical Commission in 2013 offers unique opportunities for
publicizing statewide historic preservation efforts.
Additional Training Needed
There is a great need for additional historic preservation training. Besides local commissions,
other groups that would benefit from targeted training include realtors, contractors, and
developers.
Plaque Programs, Walking Brochures, and Other Local Education Efforts
Challenges related to funding are even impacting such local efforts as plaque programs and
walking tour brochures. During this economic downtown, the Bostonian Society was forced to
temporarily suspend any additional historical plaques.
Municipal Websites
Over the past five years, most municipalities now have an official city or town website.
However, a review of municipal websites demonstrated that many do not include a webpage for
the local historical commission or the historic district commission even when other boards and
commissions are listed. A local commission webpage is a valuable tool for education, outreach,
and strengthening historic preservation efforts and needs to be a local commission priority.
Massachusetts Historical Commission Website
Improvements to the Massachusetts Historical Commission website are needed including a more
user-friendly format for the citizens of Massachusetts. The website as currently constructed
assumes a level of historic preservation knowledge most visitors are unlikely to have. While
great progress has been made in accessing digitally converted text and photo files of historic
property inventory files through the MHC website, this remains a multi-year project to complete
the state.
Statewide Historic Preservation Conferences
Although annual statewide historic preservation conferences were held from 1999 to 2005, MHC
has been unable to maintain this event due to staffing issues. Yet, there is a great need for
bringing the volunteer and professional statewide preservation community together for training,
networking, and inertia. The continued success of other annual conferences for the land trust
community, planning boards, and conservation commissions demonstrates that an annual historic
preservation conference for the state would be a great benefit.
Massachusetts Historical Commission Newsletter
Staffing changes at MHC have presented numerous challenges to publishing a timely hardcopy
newsletter. It has now been several years since the Preservation Advocate, MHC’s newsletter
has been published. While the e-newsletter has helped fill this gap, there remains a need for a
more in-depth bi-annual SHPO newsletter.
Basic Historic Preservation Inquiries
Despite educational and outreach efforts, continued confusion over the National Register of
Historic Places and Local Historic Districts remains.
14. Sustainably Rehabilitating Historic Properties
Historic Buildings are Green Buildings
Historic buildings remain under great threat with the recent focus on green energy-efficient
buildings. Yet, new construction built in a completely car dependent outer suburban area will
likely be considered a green building. Yet, the historic building located in an urban setting is
seen as an energy waster. With the advertising and misinformation about how best to
accomplish energy-efficiency, the general public has an imbalanced perspective regarding

historic buildings. This is particularly true for window replacements, deep energy retrofits and
where insulation is appropriate. Historic buildings are most often inherently green through their
embodied energy, walkable locations, quality construction, and natural materials. By upgrading
mechanical systems, sealing air infiltration and insulating appropriate areas, historic buildings
can outperform many new buildings. Yet, this message is not getting through effectively by the
preservation community even though energy auditors are stating similar conclusions. While the
rating system for sustainable buildings, LEED, is now recognizing the inherent sustainability of
historic buildings compared to new construction but there is a long way to go towards making
the point system an even playing field.
Window Replacements
The replacement of historic windows remains a great concern as old growth wood windows,
fully capable of rehabilitation and weather sealing, are removed and discarded. With the
financial incentives and extensive marketing, property owners will continue to purchase
replacement windows even when other strategies have a much better cost benefit analysis for
saving energy and money. The preservation community needs a vocal, proactive, and broader
message regarding the benefits of retaining original windows.
Deep Energy Retrofits
Other concerns include deep energy retrofits. Better documentation and monitoring of the
impacts of deep energy retrofits are needed. Some deep energy retrofits are clearly not
preservation friendly and do not meet the Secretary of the Interior Standards. Other energy
retrofit techniques may be acceptable. However, further research is needed into what short and
long-term damage may result as well as simple
cost/benefit analysis.
Alternative Energy Systems
Guidelines are also needed regarding alternative
energy systems such as accommodating solar panels
on historic buildings. The historic preservation
community needs to recognize that new installations,
while visible, can still meet the Secretary of the
Interior Standards.
Collaboration with the Energy Community
Too often, historic preservation is pitted against green
energy. Yet, recent discussions suggest that there are
many common goals and much that can be learned from each other. The historic preservation
community must reach out to the green energy community to clarify common ground and then
how best to market this message out to the public and policy makers collaboratively.
15. Including diverse cultural and ethnic communities in historic preservation.
Native American
With a past stretching back 10,000 years in Massachusetts, Native Americans have a distant past
and a recent past that offers perspectives for all residents of Massachusetts to learn and
appreciate. Yet, additional efforts are needed that can help to identify, document, and educate
regarding the Native American historic and archaeological resources present statewide.
Demographics
Massachusetts remains an immigrant state. In fact, if not for the additional immigrant
populations entering and residing in Massachusetts, the state would be losing population. In the

last federal census, the percentage of foreign-born persons residing in the state was 12.2%. This
offers both opportunities and challenges for historic preservation efforts. As the history of the
state is directly tied to immigrant populations arriving here, historic preservation can be brought
right into the present. However, while there are some exceptions, the historic preservation
community is in general not reaching out to new arrivals. Additional materials and methods are
needed that engage specific audiences.

Statewide Goals and Objectives
After reviewing the major accomplishments over the past fiver years, considering the current
challenges we face, this section looks ahead to the next five years for what needs to be done, who
is best suited to accomplish it, and a benchmark for how to reflect on the status of historic
preservation five years from now.
These Statewide Goals and Objectives can only be accomplished through the commitment of
many local, regional, and statewide organizations involved in historic preservation. Partnerships
are essential. So, too, is the recognition that each organization has unique strengths that will
collectively bring us closer to reaching these goals. For the first time, this State Historic
Preservation Plan identifies the organization(s) responsible or best-suited to accomplish each
objective.
It should be noted that some of the Massachusetts Historical Commission objectives found here
represent core responsibilities of the Massachusetts Historical Commission. These are included
here because the Statewide Goals and Objectives are referred to regularly and, most importantly,
form the basis of our Annual Work Programs. Each task included in our Annual Work Program
must refer back to the Goals and Objectives of this State Historic Preservation Plan.

INTRODUCTION
When Americans celebrated the 100th anniversary of Jane Jacobs’s
birth this year, they reflected on her tireless advocacy for vibrant, diverse
cities in the face of widespread urban renewal.2 Jacobs championed an
animated streetscape of unique buildings, old and new; an eclectic array of
merchants; and colorful, if chaotic, sidewalk activity—essentially “an oasis
with an irresistible sense of intimacy, cheerfulness, and spontaneity.”3
Although urban renewal cut a path of destruction through the heart of many
cities during the mid-twentieth century, Jacobs’s ideas lived on to shape the
historic preservation movement and many other progressive policies that
have influenced modern planning.4
But Jacobs’s fight is far from over. Ironically, the renewed interest in
urban living—and urban pioneering—that was sparked by her theories has
reignited the same tensions that divided Jacobs and her contemporaries
back in the 1950s: preservation versus demolition, old versus new, rich
versus poor.5 At the core of these tensions is an affordable housing crisis.
Consequently, the strides Jacobs made and the polices she advanced—
particularly historic preservation—are being criticized by housing
advocates as obstructing affordable housing development.6

Historic Housing for All

Thus, on Jacobs’s 100th birthday, the question on the minds of many
was: on which side of the affordable housing debate would Jacobs fall?7
Would she side with affordable housing development or the preservation of
historic districts?8 It is impossible to answer this question, and not just
because Jacobs is no longer around to opine on the issue, but because it is
the wrong question. We should be asking: how can historic preservation be
used to further affordable housing goals?
The main argument from housing advocates is twofold: that the only
way to create enough affordable housing to meet the demand is to build as
much housing as possible, and that historic districts prevent development,
thereby obstructing affordable housing growth.9 This Article proposes that
historic preservation is not the problem and that preservation is a necessary
tool for creating and maintaining quality, affordable housing.
Part I of this Article provides a background on the tension between
historic preservation and affordable housing, and lays out the argument
against historic preservation. Part II examines the flawed assumptions on
which the argument is premised, and explains why preservation is not the
problem. Part III illustrates how historic preservation can, in fact, further
affordable housing goals. Finally, Part IV explores ways in which historic
preservation laws and policies can be strengthened to create more higher-

quality affordable housing, while at the same time encouraging
preservation.
I. BACKGROUND
A. Local Historic Preservation Controls
Local governments have implemented a variety of zoning regulations
that restrict or condition development, but historic preservation has received
the brunt of the criticism in the affordable housing debate. The reason for
this heavy criticism is that historic preservation is perceived as little more
than an exclusionary tool for the elite, keeping out low-income, multifamily development.10 Before considering the strength of this argument, it
is important to understand the structure of historic preservation laws and
how they do or do not restrict development.
1. National Register Historic Districts
The National Register of Historic Places formally recognizes the
historic and architectural significance of properties and districts but
exercises no regulatory control; designation is merely honorary.11 As the
National Park Service states: “National Register listing places no
obligations on private property owners. There are no restrictions on the use,
treatment, transfer, or disposition of private property.”12 Properties listed on
the National Register may, however, benefit from state and federal tax
incentives and preservation grants.13 With over 11,000 National Register

the Contemporary Role of Preservation Law in Urban Development, 19 GEO. MASON L. REV. 665, 668

the wealthy and powerful exclude high-rise developments from their cozy historic districts”); Todd

Preservation Impact the Poor, 8 GEO. J. POVERTY L. & POL’Y 257, 258 (2001) (“[Critics] accuse

Historic Districts containing over 850,000 buildings, the potential benefits
are vast.14
2. Local Historic Districts
The local historic district is the strongest preservation tool. To create
an historic district, the local government adopts an ordinance providing for
the formation of the district, the criteria for establishing the district, and the
guidelines for review.15 Before property owners can make exterior
alterations, demolish existing buildings, or construct infill development,
they must obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the commission,
certifying that the work satisfies the guidelines.16 Typically, preservation
ordinances incorporate the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
Guidelines for Rehabilitation,17 but local governments may adopt more or
less restrictive guidelines based on the community’s preservation or other
planning goals.18 Even the more restrictive guidelines remain flexible; they
are merely guidelines and cannot prevent change or halt new
development.19
The first local historic district was established in Charleston, South
Carolina in 1931.20 Nearly a century later, there are over 2,300 local historic
districts in all 50 states.21 Historic districts are found in rural areas,
suburban neighborhoods, and city centers; they may be comprised of small
clusters of buildings or encompass hundreds of acres of urban land; and
they may reflect a range of architectural styles, development patterns, and
historical trends.22 Regardless of the location, size, or level of significance,
the recognized benefits of historic districts—economic development,

sustainability, stabilized property values, and social and psychological wellbeing—remain constant.23
3. Neighborhood Conservation Districts
A neighborhood conservation district is an aesthetic zoning regulation
typically implemented in neighborhoods that do not qualify for historic
district designation, due to their lack of historical significance or loss of
historic fabric, but have distinct characteristics that are worthy of
protection.24 Often referred to as “historic districts lite,” conservation
districts “have less stringent regulatory hurdles and more flexibility in
implementation [than do local historic districts] . . . .”25 While conservation
districts range in their level of regulatory control, many focus more on
preventing teardowns and encouraging the rehabilitation of existing
buildings, rather than preserving individual architectural details.26
Cambridge, Massachusetts created the first neighborhood conservation
district in 1983, and a number of other cities followed suit, including
Nashville, Dallas, Miami, Boise, and Chapel Hill.27 Currently, there are an
estimated 165 neighborhood conservation districts in 35 states.28 While
there is little documentation on the benefits (or shortcomings) of these
districts, anecdotal evidence suggests that they provide benefits similar to
those conferred by historic districts, while providing property owners more
flexibility for change.29

controls. While many of these restrictions have been lessened or eliminated

over time,30 one notable example has remained in full force for over 100
years: the Height of Buildings Act of 1910.31 The Act provides that, in
Washington, D.C., no building shall exceed in height the width of the street,
plus 20 feet; no building shall exceed 130 feet in any business district, with
some exceptions on Pennsylvania Avenue for buildings not exceeding 160
feet; and no building in a residential district shall exceed 85 feet.32 While
adoption of the Act was motived in part by fire safety concerns,33
preservationists have embraced the height restrictions as protective of
L’Enfant’s plan and the monumentality of the nation’s seat of
government.34 The height restrictions also prevented skyscrapers from
consuming Washington, D.C.—the fate of many inner-ring suburbs
surrounding the city.35
B. The Affordable Housing Problem
Low-income families have always struggled with securing safe,
sanitary, and affordable housing. More than a century ago, the poor and
immigrant classes crowded into tenement houses lacking sanitation, fire
safety, and adequate light and ventilation.36 In the mid-twentieth century,
low-income African-American families were warehoused in substandard
public housing high rises, many of which were segregated from the rest of
the city by highways and other physical and psychological barriers.37
Fortunately, law and policy progressed over the past century. Today, health
and safety regulations (when enforced) protect tenants from substandard
housing conditions, and inclusionary zoning policies seek to abate the

publically funded segregation of the twentieth century (albeit with mixed
results).38 Nonetheless, cities still struggle to meet the demands of
providing quality affordable housing, particularly in tight markets where
population growth limits housing supplies.39
C. The Perceived Tension Between Preservation and Affordable Housing
Many housing advocates believe there is only one viable solution to the
affordability problem—more housing—and to achieve that goal, cities with
tight housing markets need to eliminate their growth controls and add
greater density.40 This is where historic preservation is perceived as an
obstacle: historic districts prevent new construction, thereby gentrifying
those districts as enclaves for the wealthy, reducing the supply of housing
in the city, and decreasing the availability of affordable housing.41 This
fight against historic preservation is particularly persistent in San Francisco,
New York City, and Washington, D.C., where there is no longer room to
expand outward, only upward, all while the populations continue to grow
and exert pressure on already tight housing markets.42
II. PRESERVATION IS NOT THE PROBLEM
Housing advocates who criticize historic preservation as an obstacle to
affordable housing premise their arguments on several unfounded
assumptions: (1) that the actual cost of housing is the only factor that
impacts a family’s ability to afford housing; (2) that historic districts
prevent development; (3) that historic preservation causes gentrification and
displaces residents; and (4) that housing is fungible and increasing the
overall supply will meet the affordable housing demand. These assumptions
are, at best, overstated. At worst, they are completely false.

A. Factors Impacting Affordability
The first assumption is that the actual cost of housing is the only factor
that impacts a family’s ability to afford housing.43 Before addressing this
assumption, it is necessary to define “affordable housing.” According to the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a family is
considered “cost burdened” if it pays more than 30% of its income for
housing,44 and a family is “severely cost burdened” if it pays more than
50% of its income for housing.45 This ratio “is the most widely used and the
most conventional measure of housing affordability . . . and has shaped
views [on] who has affordability problems, the severity of the problems,
and the extent of the problems.”46
As a measure of housing affordability, the housing-income ratio is
problematic on many fronts. First, the ratio is not adjusted based on
household income. A household earning $100,000 per year that is paying
50% of its income on housing may not be as severely cost burdened as a
household earning $30,000 per year and spending the same percentage on
housing. While housing affordability is a very real problem for many
families, this ratio does not accurately reflect the housing needs of lowincome families. As is obvious, “severe rental burdens disproportionately
impact poor families.”47 And families with the lowest incomes, “those
earning less than 50 percent of the area median income [and] pay[ing] more
than half their income [o]n rent,” often live in substandard housing.48
Why is this distinction important? Because the affordable housing
problem cannot adequately be addressed without accurate information on
the families with the greatest need—those with the lowest incomes and the
most severe rental burdens. Building more housing units may decrease the
shortage of affordable units to an extent, but ensuring that those newly
created units are affordable and available to the lowest income families is
critical. Currently, “higher income renters occupy substantial shares of units

that would be affordable to the lowest income renters,” further exacerbating
the affordability problem.49
The second major problem with the affordable housing ratio is that it
does not account for the other myriad variables that drive housing decisions
and impact household expenditures.50 For example, a household with
children will certainly have greater expenses than one without.51
Furthermore, many households make trade-offs, foregoing more affordable
housing options to live in close proximity to public transit or within
walking distance to jobs, schools, stores, and other amenities.52 The savings
on transportation costs and medical bills (which a walkable lifestyle may
reduce) can offset higher housing costs—or even provide a financial bonus
to households.53 This is particularly relevant for historic districts, which are
often located in transit-oriented, walkable neighborhoods and are desirable
for this very reason.54
Finally, the ratio does not consider other external factors that impact
household income. Lack of jobs, low wages, and the high cost of other
necessities, such as health care, child care, and food are all factors that
impact a household’s ability to afford housing—the less income one has for
housing after factoring in other expenses, the greater the need for affordable
housing.55 These are all important factors to consider because they help
inform local governments about the best way to achieve affordable housing
goals.

B. Development in Local Historic Districts
The second assumption is that local historic districts are exclusionary
and prevent development.56 This statement demonstrates a fundamental
misunderstanding of historic preservation law and the extent to which
historic district regulations impact housing affordability. First, historic
district guidelines are not designed to prevent development or obstruct
change.57 In fact, they cannot “[l]imit growth, or regulate where growth
takes place.”58 Rather, they ensure the appropriateness of new development
and building alterations—i.e., that the changes do not compromise the
integrity of the historic and architectural qualities that contribute to the
district’s significance.59 The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, on which
many local historic district guidelines are modeled, expressly provide for
compatible new additions, exterior alterations, and new construction, as
long as the “character-defining features are not radically changed, obscured,
damaged, or destroyed.”60 Not only is the inherent flexibility of the
guidelines evidenced by the use of the word “compatible,” but also the
measure of compatibility as defined in the guidelines—radical change—is
far from restrictive. The process itself is also flexible, as it encourages
applicants to work with commissioners to achieve a balanced result.61
Importantly, preservation ordinances often contain provisions that make
concessions for undue financial hardship62 or for projects that have
“important public benefits,” including “social or other benefits having a
high priority for community services.”63
Undoubtedly, some property owners in historic districts attempt to use
their ordinance as an exclusionary tool to keep out undesirable
development, but the historic district commission as an administrative body

plays a neutral role in adjudicating certificates of appropriateness.64 The
commission’s role is to further the interests of the public, as articulated in
the preservation ordinance.65 While commissioners are not all immune from
the vagaries of the political process, or of outside influence, the (slight)
threat of bias should not be used to undermine the value of historic
preservation laws and their ability to balance the protection of significant
resources with the need for change. And again, nothing in the Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards prevents infill construction, accessory uses, or
multi-family buildings, all of which provide an excellent vehicle for
integrating affordable housing into historic districts.66 Neighbors’ outcries
against such development should go unheeded.67
Those who characterize historic preservation as exclusionary possess a
very limited understanding of historic districts and their residents. Historic
districts are often portrayed as enclaves for wealthy urbanites who moved
in and pushed longtime residents from their homes, or as refuges for
suburbanites who escaped the city for large single-family homes on
sprawling lots. But the reality is that many historic districts house lowincome residents: roughly 60% of the 850,000 buildings protected by
historic districts are located in census tracts with a poverty level of 20% or
more.68 Residents in these census tracts are more likely to embrace changes
that bring new housing and economic development opportunities.69
C. Gentrification
The third assumption is that historic preservation causes gentrification
and displaces residents.70 Indeed, gentrification remains a polarizing term in
the urban planning context,71 but a growing body of research indicating that
historic district designation can have a positive effect on low-income

residents undermines much of the previous discourse on the issue.72 As this
research shows, historic preservation does not necessarily cause
gentrification, and even where gentrification does occur, it does not
necessarily displace residents.73
A 2016 study commissioned by the Historic District Council looked at
the effects of historic districts on affordable housing in New York City,
using data on changes in median income, rent, and rental burdens in each
borough between 1970 and 2010.74 Brooklyn was the only borough with
any statistically significant relationship between historic district designation
and an increase in median income.75 In no borough did historic district
designation or timing of designation have any statistically significant
relationship with an increase in rent or rental burden.76 “While the average
rental burden . . . in historic district census tracts rose from 1970-2010, it
increased at a slower rate than all census tracts in New York City.”77
This data reinforces the findings of an earlier 2002 study by the
Citizens Housing and Planning Council, in which researchers analyzed
renter mobility in both gentrifying and non-gentrifying neighborhoods.78
The findings revealed that, when controlling for other factors,
disadvantaged residents in gentrifying neighborhoods were 17% less likely
to move than those in non-gentrifying neighborhoods.79 And increases in
rent in gentrifying neighborhoods were associated with a lower probability
of moving, even when controlling for other factors affecting mobility.80
“The probability of a poor household or a non-college graduate moving
from a unit declined as the rate of rent inflation in their neighborhood
increased.”81
The conclusion drawn from this research is that gentrification can
improve housing and neighborhood conditions, and encourage stability in

low-income households.82 It is important to keep in mind that in most
circumstances, pre-gentrification neighborhoods are economically
disadvantaged.83 They suffer from the effects of segregation, concentrated
poverty, loss of employment opportunities, low-performing schools, and
crime.84 When wealthier households invest in disadvantaged
neighborhoods, they bring local tax dollars, which can be used to maintain
affordable housing; spend money on local goods and services, spurring the
establishment of new local businesses and other jobs; and create economic
and racial diversity.85 And, over time, these neighborhoods see a reduction
in crime and an improvement in public schools.86
While gentrification is not the panacea for all the ills of inner-city
blight, it is certainly one of the best solutions.87 Urban renewal dealt a
sweeping blow to inner-city neighborhoods; gentrification, on the other
hand, is an incremental process, particularly when it occurs through historic
preservation.88 As neighborhoods slowly revitalize, local governments, land
trusts, community development groups, and other housing advocacy
organizations can implement policies to maintain housing affordability and
limit displacement.89 In fact, it is difficult to see how economic and racial
diversity can be achieved without some degree of gentrification. As long as
gentrification is demonized and avoided, affordable housing will continue
to be concentrated in areas of poverty.

D. Housing Fungibility: Supply and Demand
The final assumption is that all housing is fungible—i.e., that one
house is like the next, and thus the only thing motivating an individual’s
choice of housing is its availability and affordability.90 Accepting a theory
that housing is fungible leads inevitably to the conclusion that increasing
the supply of housing overall will reduce or eliminate the affordable
housing problem. But housing supply and demand is more nuanced than
this unitary theory,91 and the scholars who have advanced this theory have
relied solely on a narrow set of observations that do not accurately reflect
the realities of the housing market.92
1. Filter Theory
The traditional housing supply and demand theory is rooted in the
“filter theory” that was proposed in the 1960s as a market-driven solution to
housing shortages and contributed to the housing disparity we have today.93
The filter theory posited that low-income households would benefit from
the construction of high-end units through a “trickle-down” process.94
When a family at the top of the income ladder upgrades to a new housing
unit, it leaves the old unit vacant. The next family down the income ladder
will upgrade into that vacated unit, leaving another unit vacant. This
continues down to the lowest-income family. When that family abandons
its housing unit, that unit will be demolished.95
The filter theory drove the housing policies of the 1970s and 1980s that
perpetuated the extreme economic and racial segregation that began during
the middle-class suburban migration and urban renewal of the 1950s and

2012), http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/02/what_is_bernank.html (showing that housing can be
seen as fungible, since properties depend on their availability on the market, and are subject to typical
supply and demand rules).

1960s.96 During the era of filtering, there were “record numbers of new
luxury housing starts” alongside a “swelling homeless population and
drastic shortages of affordable housing.”97 Wealthier families were able to
upgrade to suburban homes or segregate themselves into more affluent
urban neighborhoods, while the poor African-American families remained
in the inner-city neighborhoods the wealthier families left behind.98 The
result was concentrated, entrenched poverty, high crime, poor schools, loss
of business, and declining property values.99 While several other factors,
including the impacts of deindustrialization, racial prejudice, and redlining
and landlord milking contributed to neighborhood decline and segregation,
the filter model failed to account for these factors, thereby exacerbating
them.100
2. Applying the Lessons of Filtering to Today’s Housing Market
Today, inner-city neighborhoods in San Francisco, New York City, and
Washington, D.C. are burgeoning with newcomers, and buildable land is
scarce.101 But the lessons we learned from filtering 30 years ago are equally
applicable to today’s housing market. First, housing choices are driven by
several factors, and no unitary theory can be applied.102 Second, affordable
housing is not market-driven; it must be either mandated or incentivized,
particularly in areas of high demand.103 And finally, the end result of
filtering is that low-income families are segregated into areas of
concentrated poverty and substandard housing.104
96. See Aoki, supra note 93, 798–800 (“The[] inadequacies [of the filtering model] had
emerged by the late 1980s, and policies premised on the simplistic assumptions of the filtering model
began seeming implausible at best and malevolent at worst, insofar as these policies negatively impacted
on the inner cities and allowed those at the high-end to deny complicity in urban decline.”).

Applying these lessons to the current housing crisis, it is clear that
initiating another building boom will not create the necessary supply of
affordable housing. Populations in cities like San Francisco, New York
City, and Washington, D.C. continue to grow and put pressure on the
housing market, and job growth in these metropolitan regions, particularly
the San Francisco Bay Area, attracts new residents from other regions in the
country and abroad.105 To a large extent, the new housing constructed in
these cities will serve those new professionals. For the market to create
affordable housing, there must be an oversupply of housing, far more than
necessary to serve the growing population of educated, affluent jobseekers.
This is an unlikely prospect, and one that does not necessarily make good
financial or planning sense.
Because the market will not supply enough, or any, affordable housing,
it must be either mandated or incentivized. At present, developers in cities
with mandatory inclusionary zoning laws are typically required to set aside
around 10–20% of their units as affordable housing.106 While developers
can apply for incentives, like the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC),
to create additional affordable units, they are less likely to do so in areas
where they can receive a market rate for the unit that is substantially higher
than the tax credit offset.107 And given the high cost of new construction—
particularly with large development projects—developers will need to
either absorb the costs of creating affordable housing, which they are not
likely to do, or pass these costs on to the tenants, decreasing affordability
overall.108 Moreover, studies on LIHTC effectiveness reveal that a large
proportion of affordable housing projects are concentrated in areas of high
poverty and racial segregation: 73.9% of inner-city units are located in
census tracts with more than 50% low-income households, and 48% are

located in tracts with more than a 50% minority population.109 In short,
there is a limit to how much affordable housing a developer will be willing
or able to create in high-demand areas when building new construction
from the ground up.
Given this backdrop, two things can be expected to happen if historic
district controls in high-demand neighborhoods are removed and developers
can add substantially more height. The first scenario is that developers
continue to build more market-rate housing and less affordable housing,
pushing even more low-income residents out of the neighborhood and into
areas of poverty, which was the consequence of the filter model.110 The
second scenario is that, as new high-rise construction consumes the
neighborhood and the desirable elements of the neighborhood are lost—the
historic character, human scale, walkability, and social and psychological
connections—the affluent residents that “gentrified” the area in the first
place will no longer find it attractive and leave.111 This is intuitive when
looking at historic districts, which attract residents based on a range of
qualitative factors. The current supply and demand theory fails to account
for this and other non-quantitative factors driving housing decisions, the
very flaw in the filter model. In either scenario, the poor end up
concentrated into areas of poverty.
IV. HISTORIC PRESERVATION FURTHERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS
In its infancy, the preservation movement focused on restoring
buildings of great national importance, but modern-day preservationists
have increasingly viewed preservation as “an effective tool for a wide range
of public goals,” including affordable housing, neighborhood revitalization
and stabilization, and economic development.112 While historic preservation
alone cannot eradicate the affordable housing crisis, it can—and should—
play a central role in a comprehensive, long-term plan to increase the
availability and quality of affordable housing; protect the affordability of
that housing; and create vibrant, mixed-income neighborhoods that improve
the standard of living for low-income families. As this Part explains: (1)
rehabilitation of existing buildings is more cost effective than new
construction; (2) historic preservation creates jobs and boosts the local

economy; (3) historic buildings improve quality of life; and (4) historic
districts can preserve smaller, cheaper housing, and prevent displacement of
residents.
A. Historic Preservation is Cost-Effective
The prevailing belief that rehabilitation is costlier than new
construction has been repudiated by empirical data.113 While each
individual project has its own unique costs, the evidence demonstrates that
rehabilitation is, at least, a competitive option—and often a more affordable
one.114 This is particularly true when creating affordable housing because
the level of rehabilitation need not be substantial to make the housing
livable.
A recent study from Harvard University is worth highlighting for its
applicability to affordable housing.115 In 2013, a team of researchers studied
the business models of investors who purchased foreclosed properties in
Cleveland, Ohio to see if renovating the vacant properties would be a more
cost-effective alternative to demolition.116 At the time of the study, an
estimated 8,300 vacant homes in Cleveland were slated for
condemnation.117 The cost of demolition was $10,000 per home.118 In the
alternative, each house renovated through the HUD Neighborhood
Stabilization Program was eligible for a $90,000 subsidy.119 The research
team was tasked with determining how Cleveland should best spend its
limited subsidy: by renovating the vacant buildings or demolishing them.120
The study found that in five out of six neighborhoods, rehabilitation
was more cost effective than demolition when the rehabilitation was limited
to making the house livable (as opposed to bringing the house up to modern

green building standards).121 Notably, the study looked at the cost of
demolition alone, rather than demolition plus new construction.122 Adding
in the cost of new construction invariably tips the scale in favor of
rehabilitation and allows additional room for substantial rehabilitation
beyond mere code compliance.
Similar studies reinforce this conclusion. A 2001 HUD-sponsored
study found that it would cost $75,000 to repair an older home with severe
physical problems, and $25,000 for one with moderate problems.123 The
study further found that only 11% of the older housing stock suffered from
severe or moderate physical problems, meaning that only a small
percentage of homes would require the full $75,000 for repairs.124
Importantly, “the $75,000 figure is comparable to the most cost effective of
Federal housing programs and significantly cheaper than some
programs,”125 making rehabilitation of even the most deteriorated housing
stock a competitive option.
Of course, quality of construction is always a factor to be considered in
the preservation-versus-new-construction debate. To achieve affordability
without “massive subsidies,” developers may use cheaper, lower-quality
building materials, which adds costs over the long term and reduces the
quality of the unit.126 On the other hand, historic buildings have already
withstood the test of time, largely because of their higher-quality, oldgrowth wood, load-bearing masonry construction, and overall superior
workmanship.127 These older buildings will remain durable, helping to
preserve the affordability and quality of the housing over time.128 Even
when new construction costs are cheaper compared to rehabilitation costs,

the added factor of building quality will inevitably tip the scale in favor of
rehabilitation.129
Rehabilitation becomes even more competitive with the availability of
tax incentives. When property owners undertake substantial rehabilitation,
state and federal rehabilitation investment tax credits are available to help
defray the costs. The federal government offers a tax credit for 20% of the
rehabilitation costs on income-producing properties (this excludes owneroccupied residences) that are listed or eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places and are rehabilitated in compliance with the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards.130 A 10% credit is available for
properties built before 1936 that are not eligible for listing.131 While the tax
credit is limited for properties producing only passive income (e.g., rental
income), where the property owner is a real estate professional, he or she
may be eligible for the full credit.132 States administer an even wider range
of credits to piggyback on the federal credit. Many offer a 25% credit,
allow full credit for passive activity and owner-occupied residences, and
require a lower minimum investment.133
Developers of affordable housing can also piggyback the low income
housing tax credit (LIHTC) on top of their federal and state rehabilitation
tax credits.134 The LIHTC is available for new construction as well as the
adaptive reuse of existing buildings,135 and the ability to piggyback the tax
credits gives developers working with historic buildings a financial windfall
over those constructing new units.
B. Historic Preservation Boosts the Local Economy
Many variables impact housing affordability that cannot be addressed
simply by building new housing. Low wages, lack of jobs, high taxes, and
many other factors directly impact household income and housing

affordability.136 By looking at the impacts of rehabilitation projects made
possible by state and federal tax credits, researchers have gathered
empirical evidence on the economic benefits of historic preservation.
“Dollar for dollar, historic preservation is one of the highest jobgenerating economic development options available.”137 Rehabilitation
work is significantly more labor intensive than new construction, the
impacts of which have a ripple effect through the local economy because
the construction workers and other laborers hired locally will spend their
money at local businesses.138 And general contractors undertaking
rehabilitation work are more likely to purchase materials from local
vendors.139 For every $1,000,000 spent on rehabilitation versus new
construction, rehabilitation will result in $120,000 more staying within the
community; five to nine more construction jobs; 4.7 more jobs elsewhere in
the community; $107,000 more in household income; and over $100,000
more in retail sales.140 Clearly, as household incomes increase, families
have more money to spend on housing.
Rehabilitation work has additional benefits beyond job creation,
including tourism, new business growth, additional private investment, and
increased property and sales taxes, to name a few.141 Again, these benefits
significantly impact household income. For example, as the city’s tax base
increases, it can provide more services to the community—e.g., public
transit, childcare, better schools—which can improve the quality of life of
the residents and reduce their household expenses.142
C. Historic Buildings Improve Quality of Life
In light of the substandard public housing of the twentieth century,
there is an increasing recognition that housing cannot be merely affordable,
it must also improve the quality of the life of the residents and the larger
community. In the quest to build ourselves out of an affordable housing
shortage, we may be building ourselves into unlivable communities.

Historic Housing for All

The type of density most housing advocates are seeking is high-rise
construction, as this is the only way to add significantly more density in
tight markets. But when it comes to affordable housing, this type of density
has been proven harmful, particularly for children growing up in poverty.143
And as the public housing projects of the twentieth century have shown us,
there is a greater risk of segregation and concentrated poverty in high rises
than in the mixed-use, lower-density, human-scale neighborhoods.144
Affordable housing should be located in diverse, mixed-income,
walkable, transit-oriented neighborhoods close to shopping, schools, parks,
and other amenities. Historic neighborhoods possess many, if not all, of
these qualities, and creating historic districts preserves and enhances those
qualities.145 Placing incompatible high rises in the middle of historic
districts degrades the quality of life that makes these places livable and
desirable. The result is that we are destroying the things we value, so that
nobody can enjoy them, when we should be figuring out how to bring the
things we value to a wider audience, so that everybody can enjoy them.
Historic preservation, when part of a comprehensive housing plan, can
achieve this goal.
D. Historic Districts Protect Affordable Housing
The strongest argument for maintaining historic districts is that they
protect affordable housing. There is a misconception that historic districts
are home to only affluent households.146 But the data does not support this.
Sixty percent of the 850,000 buildings listed in historic districts are located
in census tracts with a poverty level of 20% or more,147 and 32% of
households below the poverty line live in older and historic homes.148 Data
on the effectiveness of the LIHTC indicates that many older buildings
already serve low-income families, and when developers construct new
143. See Schill & Wachter, supra note 37, at 1293 (“High density apartment buildings are now
generally thought to be inappropriate for poor families with children. Elevators break down as a result of
heavy usage and insufficient maintenance. In addition, parents find it difficult to monitor the activities
of their children when recreation spaces are located at a distance from their apartments. Furthermore, the
large volume of residents fosters anonymity, making it difficult for tenants to maintain security and a
sense of community. All of these factors combine to promote vandalism, which further undermines the
quality of life in public housing.”) (footnotes omitted).
144. See id. at 1293–94 (describing concentrated poverty in high density, residential towers that
characterized public housing and observing that “these types of projects often generated a series of
problems that led to their abandonment by all but the poorest and least mobile tenants”).

affordable housing with the tax credit, it often replaces older buildings
already serving that purpose.149 Since the late 1970s, nearly a third of the
over 500,000 housing units completed under the auspices of the federal
historic preservation tax credit were affordable to low- and moderateincome families,150 a figure that is “noteworthy when compared with some
better-known affordable housing production programs.”151 While the need
to create new affordable housing is critical, the need to protect existing
historic housing is even more critical.
When historic district guidelines recommend against demolition of
existing buildings, incompatible additions, or out-of-scale infill
development, they protect the smaller homes that, by their size alone, are
made more affordable. Because many historic neighborhoods are located in
desirable neighborhoods, the land is more valuable than the building
itself.152 New, more affluent residents moving into these neighborhoods
often try to maximize their square footage with large additions that double
the size of the home, second story “pop tops” on single-story homes, or new
McMansions squeezed onto narrow lots.153 Inevitably, these larger homes
drive up property values and make the neighborhoods unaffordable—the
exact problem critics claim historic districts create.
This is particularly relevant in suburban neighborhoods, which housing
advocates claim are constrained by too many exclusionary zoning
regulations to allow affordable housing growth. It is true that many newer
suburbs are zoned only for single-family homes and mandate strict
minimum lot sizes and minimum setbacks. But many historic suburbs,
particularly those built pre-World War II, were designed with smaller lots
and setbacks, allowing greater density (as compared to more modern
suburbs with minimum lot sizes), and many of the properties boast

secondary structures, like carriage barns or shops, that can easily be
transformed into accessory living spaces.154 In fact, many of the larger,
older homes themselves were long ago divided into apartments for boarders
or other family members, and may be grandfathered in in areas otherwise
zoned only for single-family dwellings.155
It is important to keep in mind that zoning regulations that prohibit
multi-family housing are not tied to historic preservation laws. Historic
districts do not regulate interior alterations and cannot prevent a property
owner from converting a single-family home into apartments.156 Local
governments interested in creating affordable housing can loosen other
zoning restrictions while keeping historic district regulations in place. This
will protect neighborhoods from teardowns but allow flexibility for adding
density. And larger historic homes are very adaptable.157 Their divided
interior spaces (as opposed to the open floor plans common in modern
homes) can easily be broken up into small apartments or condos, or
converted back to single-family living if the needs of the neighborhood
change.158
Finally, while it is important to add density to curb sprawl and generate
diversity and affordability, limiting the amount of development in certain
high-demand neighborhoods can be beneficial on a wider metropolitan,
regional, or national perspective. While cities with the tightest markets, like
San Francisco and New York City, have little buildable land, many other
cities still contain swaths of vacant land and abandoned buildings that need
redevelopment.159 As pressure increases in key, high-demand areas, these
disadvantaged communities continue to struggle with extreme poverty,

disinvestment, and declining populations. Incentives can lure businesses
and developers into these areas, but placing a cap on growth in alreadyoverpopulated areas can further encourage revitalization of underpopulated
communities.160 This should be happening at both the regional and national
levels. For example, many older industrial cities in the Northeast are
crippled with disinvestment while New York City keeps growing. And rust
belt cities in the Midwest are suffering from extreme decline while droughtstricken cities in the West and Southwest are booming. Limits on
overbuilding in tight markets can stimulate the growth necessary in those
areas currently lacking investment.161
V. FURTHERING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH PRESERVATION
Many programs are dedicated to creating and maintaining affordable
housing, including land trusts, grants, and tax incentives, and many local
governments have mandatory inclusionary zoning policies to help achieve
their goals. The purpose of this Part is not to discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of those programs, but to recommend new approaches to
affordable housing that should be adopted by the preservation community.
Preservationists should raise awareness about the intersection between
preservation and affordable housing, and demonstrate positive ways
preservation can be used to further those dual goals.
A. Top-Down Approach
The most effective way to integrate affordable housing into historic
preservation is for the National Park Service (NPS) and State Historic
Preservation Offices (SHPO) to encourage or mandate certain activities
through the grants and technical assistance that they provide to local
governments. This can occur through the Certified Local Government
(CLG) Program, cost-share programs between SHPOs and local
governments, matching preservation grants, and downtown revitalization
programs.

160. Edward Glaeser argues that “[t]he social costs of binding development restrictions lie in the
misallocation of consumers by having them live in less productive, less attractive places.” Glaeser,
supra note 101, at 335. What Glaeser is essentially arguing is that we should let the undesirable areas
further decline, while the more attractive areas continue to grow. This would arguably lead back to
segregation and isolation of the poor in areas of concentrated poverty—less productive, less attractive
places—exactly the thing that Glaeser claims is a result of exclusionary historic districts.
161. With climate change and the threat of rising sea levels, the idea that we should encourage
growth in the interior and away from at-risk coastal areas is not unfounded.

1. Certified Local Government Program
The CLG program, jointly administered by the NPS and SHPOs,
provides funding and technical assistance to local governments undertaking
preservation activities.162 To be certified, a local government must meet a
set of minimum goals: establish an historic preservation commission;
enforce state or local legislation for the designation and protection of
historic properties, typically through a preservation ordinance; maintain a
system to survey and inventory historic resources; facilitate public
participation in local preservation; and follow any other procedures
established by the states.163 States receive annual appropriations from the
Federal Historic Preservation Fund and must pass at least 10% of their
funding along to CLGs for surveys, National Register nominations,
rehabilitation work, design guidelines, educational programs, training,
structural assessments, feasibility studies, and a host of other activities.164
To integrate affordable housing into the CLG program, the federal and
state governments should add an affordable housing goal as a condition of
certification, and offer additional funds to CLGs with significant affordable
housing needs. This would require local preservation officers or
commissions to work with planners and housing advocates to identify
affordable housing needs, an important first step in integrating affordable
housing into local preservation activities. An important component to this
planning process is identifying the affordable housing needs by
neighborhood and flagging those that are “high need”—e.g., tight housing
markets and rising real estate prices—“moderate need”—e.g., some multifamily rentals mixed with pricier single-family homes—or “low need”—
e.g., plenty of affordable housing that should be maintained. This initial
step should focus on only the housing needs; not the preservation goals.
The next step would be for the CLG to include an affordable housing
goal within the purpose statement of its preservation ordinance. This
purpose statement should not only articulate the goals of creating and
maintaining affordable housing, but also it should explain how that goal is
to be carried out. Once a proper ordinance is drafted, the CLG can decide
which preservation activities will best address both its affordable housing
needs and its important preservation objectives. The focus of this step

[Vol. 41:603

should be to balance the dual goals of preservation and affordable housing
in a way that achieves a positive result for both.
The next activity a CLG should undertake is the survey and inventory
of historic buildings. States routinely require this activity of its CLGs, as it
provides information for preservation planning purposes and facilitates with
National Register listing, review under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, review of tax credit projects, and many other activities.
While many communities target, or at least prioritize, the most significant
buildings for survey, states should require their CLGs to survey all historic
buildings (those over 50 years in age) and to perform this in a systematic
way that prioritizes the most threatened buildings or neighborhoods.
Through the survey process, CLGs should consider neighborhoods that are
in need of affordable housing, or that contain affordable housing in need of
protection, and should highlight properties that are suitable for multi-family
use or low-cost rehabilitation. This inventory of historic resources can be
useful at the regional and state levels as a means of identifying where
affordable housing growth should occur, and it can also be used by the CLG
to plan for historic districts and other local preservation activities.
The most important activity for a CLG is the designation of properties
to the National Register of Historic Places or local landmark registers. And
key here is the local historic district, which can be used to create or
maintain affordable housing. First, CLGs should be required to create
historic districts in low-income areas, particularly those with small,
vernacular buildings, as these areas are often overlooked by local historic
preservation commissions. A neighborhood that is eligible under traditional
criteria—e.g., that buildings retain their historic and architectural
significance—should be protected as a traditional historic district with
guidelines that adhere to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards. A
neighborhood that has lost its integrity, either through individual building
alterations or overall loss of building stock, but nonetheless merits
protection—e.g., at least 50% of its building stock remains intact or the
buildings have lost architectural detail but retain their historic footprint and
envelope—can be protected as a neighborhood conservation district. The
guidelines for the conservation district should be more flexible, focusing on
preventing teardowns, oversized additions, or out-of-scale infill
development. The conservation district is important, as it protects more
low-income or potentially affordable properties from being replaced by
higher-end housing, and the more flexible guidelines allow for less costly
renovations. For both the historic and neighborhood conservation districts,
the ordinance should mandate strong demolition delays, particularly in
neighborhoods with high land values and smaller homes, and should also

631

contain mechanisms to discourage demolition and incentivize rehabilitation,
such as impact fees, exactions, or transferable development rights.
In addition to planning for the creation of affordable housing, CLGs
should design educational programs that train property owners and local
builders on performing rehabilitation work that does not compromise the
quality of the construction or destroy energy-efficient features. This is an
important addition to the survey and landmark designation activities
because it ensures that the properties are not just affordable, but also safe,
sanitary, and durable.
Finally, the NPS and SHPOs should provide technical assistance to
CLGs in designing and carrying out these projects. This should include
sample historic and conservation district guidelines for neighborhoods
targeted as “high” or “moderate need”; sample criteria for designating
neighborhood conservation districts; guidelines for identifying properties
well-suited for affordable housing; and guidelines for crafting a strong
preservation ordinance.
2. Cost-Share Programs
Through cost-share programs, state and local governments partner to
undertake preservation survey and inventory projects. The state and local
governments share costs, while the state administers the program—hiring
consultants, reviewing the work, and ensuring completion of the final
product—which is typically a comprehensive survey report detailing the
findings and providing recommendations for stewardship.165 Like the
surveys undertaken by CLGs, discussed above, these surveys should
identify buildings suitable for affordable housing and the condition of those
buildings, and provide recommendations on how the housing goals can be
incorporated into larger preservation goals.
3. Matching Grants
Other preservation matching grants are available to local governments
on a competitive basis for the rehabilitation and repair of historic
buildings.166 States should give preference to projects involving the
rehabilitation or repair of affordable housing, particularly in areas where the

need for housing is great. States should also increase their share of the
matching grants for projects based on how much affordable housing will be
created.
4. Downtown Revitalization
The National Main Street Center, a subsidiary of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation, maintains a network of local downtown revitalization
organizations (“Main Street programs”); provides technical assistance,
training, and workshops; and has created an organizing framework—the
Main Street Four Point Approach—that the local Main Street programs
implement to achieve their revitalization goals.167 Many states have
coordinating programs that work with the local communities to carry out
the Four Point Approach.168 As Main Street programs are located in central
business districts, their primary focus is on business growth, but most
central business districts also contain housing. As this housing is centrally
located and typically in the form of rentals, the affordable housing
opportunities are significant. Economic development certainly has ripple
effects into the residential community, and Main Street programs should
take the reins to promote rehabilitation of housing and ensure that housing
remains affordable, even as property values begin to rise. This can be
achieved through a revised Four Point Approach that expressly addresses
the residential component of the downtown, as well as training and
workshops on how to incorporate affordable housing goals into an
economic development plan.
In addition to the Main Street program, states should adopt an Elm
Street program for revitalization of residential neighborhoods bordering
central business districts.169 In many cases, these neighborhoods have
suffered population loss and disinvestment, and they often boast large
historic homes that have already been divided into multi-family rentals. As
the central business district revitalizes, these residential neighborhoods may
feel pressure from developers. One goal of an Elm Street program should

be to preserve both the historic character and affordability of these
neighborhoods.
B. Enhanced Tax Incentives
Another way preservationists can drive affordable housing
development is by advocating for enhanced federal rehabilitation tax
credits. Currently, several limitations in the federal tax credit hinder its use
for affordable housing projects, particularly small ones undertaken by
individual property owners. For example, the requirement that properties be
income-producing precludes rehabilitation of owner-occupied properties;
limits on income from passive activity make it difficult for property owners
to use the tax credit to create rental housing; and the substantial
rehabilitation requirement ($5,000 or the adjusted basis, whichever is
greater) makes small projects infeasible.
The solution is a second federal tax credit for affordable housing
projects. The requirement that properties be listed or eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places would remain, as would the
requirement that the completed work satisfy the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards, albeit in a modified form that would grant more flexibility to the
property owner.170 First, removing the requirement that properties be
income-producing opens the tax credit to a wider range of projects that
could provide affordable housing. And second, eliminating the substantial
rehabilitation requirement would make feasible both small projects that
involve bringing a building up to code, and larger projects that would not
generate as much profit for the developer (e.g., rehabilitating a former
industrial building to be used for low-income housing).
Maintaining affordability is as important as creating affordable
housing. For large projects of ten units or more, an additional, smaller
credit should be available for every 5 years the units are maintained at an
affordable rate for low-income families, up to 30 years. For example, the
developer could receive an initial 20% credit and an additional 5% every 5
years up to 30 years, for a total credit of 50% of the rehabilitation costs.
This will encourage substantial rehabilitation of large historic buildings for
affordable housing when such a project would not otherwise be
economically feasible, and it would help stabilize the neighborhood by
ensuring that the units remain affordable over a generation.

170. See ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRES., AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HISTORIC
PRESERVATION (2006) (providing modified guidelines to be applied in Section 106 review of affordable
housing projects).

Vermont Law Review

[Vol. 41:603

CONCLUSION
So what would Jane Jacobs do today if faced with the question of how
to address the affordable housing shortage? We can say with confidence
that she would still advocate for an animated streetscape of unique
buildings, an eclectic array of merchants, and colorful sidewalk activity.
We can also say with confidence that she would advocate for better-quality
housing for low-income families, and more integrated and diverse
neighborhoods. Knowing that, the answer to the question is simple: Jacobs
would support historic districts. Jacobs saw historic districts as a way to
preserve city life for both the wealthy and disadvantaged. And they still
serve that purpose today. Historic districts are inherently inclusionary
because they are varied, adaptable, and unique places that people love.
They confer benefits on everyone. New construction will always be
necessary, but it should supplement—not supplant—historic preservation.

what hopefully you have considered before, though not one Councilor replied to any submission
or even noted any of the issues. I find it most insulting that players incredibly divisive and
disruptive at all the meetings of ECNCD were at the table and yet, the many residents who worked

Dear Council Members and Mayor:
Please find below and attached my prior submissions on this issue. I did attend the last meeting on this
issue at which no public comment was allowed under the guise that this was a continuation of the prior
meeting. A bit of leger de main. LOL Let me add that at the last meeting, over and over, I heard the age
of Charles Sullivan and his length of tenure introduced as if the real necessity for this butchering is his
age. To say it was insensitive is an understatement. Age was used like a hammer to justify the goal of
the proponents. Let me also note that the proponent and author carry the burden. They need to justify
their chosen language based on their research and knowledge. Instead, the Executive Director was
ordered to review 40 years of cases in which petitions were denied or granted. Any Councilor should

City Councilors,
Quite suddenly posted to the City Calendar is notice of upcoming Ordinance Meeting on the Amendment
to Chapter 2.78, entitled "HIstorical Buildings and Landmarks." No further information is posted. No link
for public comment. No proposed text other than a reference to amended language from meeting of April
2023, though if memory serves me that was the formal meeting in which the proposed language not only
was not publicly posted, it was not even previously shared with the Cambridge Historic Commission. I am
submitting my prior opposition with attachments. I note that the chief proponents of the gutting of
historical protections for this city will no longer be with us. One is relocating happily out of state and the
other, after flagrantly violating Plan E strictures, is stepping down. Can we please take a breath. What is
being proposed is not even lawful procedurally or substantively.

Honorable Council Members and Mayor:
Please register my ﬁrm opposi on to adop on of the BEUDO ByLaw now before you. I am a aching here my prior
submissions and at this point not much has changed from the original wording. Not one Councilor responded to the
issues I raised; one aide was generous enough to actually render his legal opinion though he is not a lawyer. Note, a
municipality cannot do via a ByLaw what it is prohibited from doing by MGL. c40A, Sec on 3. A rose is a rose is a
rose. You do not get to back door what is statutorily prohibited under Home Rule. There is enough case law on that
issue. We really do not have that many houses of worship le in this fair City. Why would you knowingly seek to burden
them to a point to force closure?? As I have already asserted, this would be the only jurisdic on in the country
burdening houses of worship this way. Do we really have that many landmarks that their exemp on would amount to
anything?

I am resubmi ng what I emailed previously with the following addi ons. Despite discussion and further delibera on,
the proposed amendments allowing for hardship evalua on simply do not address the looming problem with
BEUDO. Though many condo owners seem to have garnered support from the Council, the Houses of Worship have
simply been ignored. I have spoken to a member of the clergy here in Cambridge who recently got quotes for
replacement of a hea ng system. Without BEUDO mandate, the hea ng system replacement would be $600,000.
Abiding by the present BEUDO, the compliant hea ng system would be $6,000,000. Under the proposed BEUDO, this
City will be pu ng every House of Worship out of business. Upon further inquiry I direct the Council's a en on to M.G.L.

be wise to engage an outside en ty to provide a more extensive study and survey. To be sure, this will be the only city in
the na on to apply such a mandate to Houses of Worship and Historic Landmarks with no accommoda on or
relief. Please just take another look at the NYC exemp ons!!
I also note that the City Solicitor has submi ed a rather foreboding opinion essen ally warning that you are entering
unchartered territory. I also note that by Special Act this City asked to be relieved of the restric ons of the Dover
Amendment because the municipality felt overly burdened by the inﬂuence of the universi es. Were the Houses of
Worship overly burdening as well??
Please take a look at the law in NYC:
The law is deliberately comprehensive, although there are a few exemp ons to be aware of:
* City‐owned buildings (except senior colleges in the City University of New York system)
* A classiﬁed religious place of worship
* Nonproﬁt hospitals and healthcare facili es
* Industrial buildings used predominantly to generate electric power or steam
* Rent‐regulated housing
* Housing that is owned by (or on land owned by) the NYC housing authority
* Buildings that are part of a federal housing program
* Housing Development Fund Corpora on (HDFC) proper es
* Mul ‐family dwellings of 3 stories or lower, with no central HVAC or hot water system Most exempt buildings will
instead have to commit to a reduc on of carbon emissions, rather than a cap.

To the point, this is a dras c change from anything anyone ever an cipated. This needs study and a real plan with those
eﬀected most at the table. I note, I see no men on of hardship waivers or exclusions for historic landmarks or even
houses of worship. The faith community was never even at the table. This is exactly the kind of policy that could shu er
our churches but then again perhaps this is not high on priority of most of the Council these days.
I am a aching here an eyepopping ar cle from the Boston Business Journal proﬁling Trinity Church in Copley Square as
using 18 mes as much fossil fuel as the John Hancock tower. We all know that could never be true but this is the kind of
crazy data that is being collected.
Please give this more me. To involve developers like Alexandria, an incredibly successful REIT, and Harvard and MIT
who share the highest endowments in the world, while excluding our small developments and houses of worship is just
plain outrageous. Please read through the a ached ar cle. This is the kind of data this city will be relying upon. This is

designated by the mayor, may grant an adjustment of the annual building emissions limit
applicable to a covered building in existence on the effective date of this article or for which a
permit for the construction of such building was issued prior to such effective date, provided that
the owner is complying with the requirements of this article to the maximum extent practicable.
1. Such an adjustment may be granted upon a specific determination that:
1.1. Capital improvements are necessary for strict compliance with the limit set forth in
section 28-320.3 and it is not reasonably possible to make such improvements due to (i) a
constraint imposed by another provision of law including but not limited to designation as
a landmark, landmark site, interior landmark, or within a historic district pursuant to
chapter 3 of title 25 of the administrative code, or (ii) a physical condition of the building
or building site including but not limited to lack of access to energy infrastructure, space
constraints, or lack of access to a space within a building covered by a lease in existence
on the effective date of this section;
1.2. The owner has made a good faith effort to purchase greenhouse gas offsets to comply
with section 28-320.3 but a sufficient quantity is not available at a reasonable cost; and
1.3. The owner has availed itself of all available city, state, federal, private and utility
incentive programs related to energy reduction or renewable energy for which it
reasonably could participate.
2. Such an adjustment may be granted upon a specific determination that:
2.1. The cost of financing capital improvements necessary for strict compliance with the limit
set forth in section 28-320.3 would prevent the owner of a building from earning a
reasonable financial return on the use of such building or the building is subject to
financial hardship as defined in this article. In evaluating the ability of an owner to earn a
reasonable financial return, the department may consider future savings expected from
such capital improvements;
2.2. The owner is not eligible for any program funded by the city or enabled by a local law that
provides financing for the purpose of energy reduction or sustainability measures. Proof of
ineligibility for financing must be demonstrated by rejection from any such program
funded by the city or enabled by a local law or an affidavit explanation why such owner
could not reasonably participate in such programs;

energy credits to comply with section 28-320.3 but a sufficient quantity is not available at a
reasonable cost; and
2.4. The owner has availed itself of all available city, state, federal, private and utility
incentive programs related to energy reduction or renewable energy for which it
reasonably could participate.
§ 28-320.7.1 Effective period. An adjustment granted pursuant to item 1 of section 28-320.7
may be effective for a period of not more than three calendar years. An adjustment granted
pursuant to item 2 of such section may be effective for a period of not more than one
calendar year.
§ 28-320.7.2 Application. An application for such an adjustment shall be made in the form and
manner determined by the department and certified by a registered design professional.
§ 28-320.8 Adjustment to applicable annual building emissions limit for calendar years
2024-2029. The department may grant an adjustment of the annual building emissions
limit for calendar years 2024 through 2029 applicable to a covered building in existence
on the effective date of this article where such covered building emissions in calendar year
2018 exceeds the building emissions limit as prescribed by section 28-320.3.1 by more
than 40 percent, as reported to the department by a registered design professional. The
adjustment shall result in a required building emissions limit that is 70 percent of the
calendar year 2018 building emissions for the covered building. Such adjustment may be
granted where:
1. The owner of a covered building demonstrates that the building emissions in excess of the
building emissions limit is attributable to special circumstances related to the use of the
building, including but not limited to 24 hour operations, operations critical to human
health and safety, high density occupancy, energy intensive communications technologies
or operations, and energy-intensive industrial processes;
2. The owner of a covered building demonstrates that the energy performance of the covered
building is equivalent to a building in compliance with the New York city energy
conservation code in effect on January 1, 2015; and
3. The owner of the covered building has submitted a plan to the department setting forth a
schedule of alterations to the covered building or changes to the operations and
management of the covered building sufficient to ensure that the covered building will be
in compliance with the annual building emissions limits for calendar years 2030 through

Support Beudo amendments and protect NCDs

TO: Council and City Clerk
Dear Council,
I have two Policy Orders I want to address:
1) PLEASE SUPPORT AMENDMENTS BEUDO- In tweaking BEUDO, it is still important to bring
your decisions back to how and who are going to be affected. Just pushing residential buildings to
start the process to decarbonize is unrealistic. And "Simply having residents switch to 100%
renewable electricity will get most of them to their goal" is simplistic and ideological. the question
is HOW and what kind of PLANNING do they need, and what help let alone electricity is available? this
package deal can't rely on the review board which guaranteed will be swamped by individuals looking for
solutions.

While the goal is laudable, small businesses owning their space, hospitals and healthcare facilities
and houses of worship are equally financially distressed. Not all qualify for federal or city
funding. Small non-residential condos (mostly businesses) are still bouncing back from COVID. If you
can exempt labs from complying you can make exceptions with healthcare facilities which are more
complicated. And what dwindling congregation can afford millions of dollars to retrofit cavernous
churches, likewise, Historic designations? They can’t possibly be compliant by 2035.
If residential buildings contribute to 20% of GHG, then concentrate on the 80% you have more control
over. THEN work with individual owners to find a do-able path to compliance. Is individual
consideration a loop hole? Single-owner buildings should join the ranks of individual condos and large
residential buildings. (you can decide how family inheritance vs corporations qualify). What is being
triggered is either owners selling and/ or raising rents. It will exacerbate residential displacement and
add to the housing and rent crisis. New Technology is also constantly being developed. We don’t
always have to be “FIRST” but we need to do it right!
2) PLEASE PROTECT NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (NCD)NCDs continue to be under attack as certain Councilors try to streamline a flexible but vital concept.
(MOSTLY NON-BINDING) NCDs help oversee our historical landscape while allowing change. That
is their governing mandate. Opponents want to do what they want when they want with no guidelines
or consequences. CHC has already suggested a non-binding review of AHO projects.
CHC, in defending itself, should not be charged with reviewing cases when the Author challenging the
policy should be the one proving abuse of power or obstruction of housing. HE/ THEY (complicit
Councilors) should be doing their own research. The question asked of the CHC is how many cases
rejected housing over 40 years. The REAL questions are 1) HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF
APPLICATIONS HAS THE CHC HANDLED IN 40 YRS, 2) OF THOSE- HOW MANY WERE
RESOLVED BY STAFF 3) HOW MANY ACTUALLY WERE REVIEWED BY FULL COMMISSION 4)
AND OF THOSE, HOW MANY WERE NOT APPROVED AND WHY.

COMPARING NCD LANGUAGE WITH 40C STATE MANDATE FOR HISTORICAL DISTRICTS IS
NOT THE SAME THING. NCDs were developed to allow building while safeguarding Cambridge’s
culturally significant historic stock. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE BASED AS CLOSELY ON THE
STATE 40C AS POSSIBLE, NCDs and THEIR LANGUAGE are LOCALLY CUSTOMIZED.
NCDs function individually. The fact that the Author and Council Sponsors are adamant at taking any
jurisdiction away from NCD function shows ignorance of the highest order.
Forbes magazine appraised Cambridge as #1 place to live citing historical architecture, cafes, etc as
an important asset. How do you think it got that way? Through the stewardship of the CHC and its
customized NCDs. And all the while, CHC is helping to identify and create opportunities for Affordable
Housing.
Thank you for your service.

Support strong BEUDO amendments

Dear City Councilors:
Thank you so much for your support thus far of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO).
As a resident and property owner, the climate crisis is a palpable reality to me, and I want my city to be doing
everything it can to reduce greenhouse emissions swiftly and equitably
We can draw on all the support now available at the state and national levels, and we can and must push our
building owners, including, importantly, institutional ones, to be doing their part.
Please represent my voice, and the voice of so many residents, and pass a final version of the BEUDO
amendments that is strong, vigorous, and adequate to the urgency at hand.
One specific possible modification to the amendments that I support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target
for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these
buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.
Thank you,
Marta Bianciardi

BEUDO Amendment, June 26 City Council Meeting

Dear Cambridge officials,
I hope to be at the meeting tonight (June 26) but may not be able to, so I'm writing to make sure my two
points are recorded. I'm a building trustee at 36-42 Linnaean St, a 61-unit building that should be subject to
BEUDO emissions requirements but as far as I can tell from the legalese of the documents will not be. I do not
think, as a life-long environmentalist, partner of a climate scientist, and professor who's taught or team-taught
in environmental studies courses, that we can afford to make exceptions. Natural systems do not care if
condo dwellers will be inconvenienced while their fossil-fueled steam heat systems are being replaced by heat
pumps. And we no longer need only worry for the children's future: the rate of warming itself is increasing
rapidly. I've already suffered a heat stroke at the end of a 10-day heat wave--during which I was hydrated and
working by day in an air-conditioned library. Natural systems do not care if we drink 8 glasses of water a day
(a luxury we can't count on access to much longer), or recycle, or build seawalls. They only care how much
carbon and methane we emit.
1) I hope you will vote for the strongest possible amendments to BEUDO, including, in cases of "alternative
compliance," a strictly enforced limitation of carbon credits to local New England projects that can be
overseen and regulated, and the use of collected fees for energy efficiency projects and green job training
programs that benefit low-income and minority residents.
2) I hope the city will implement and enforce a rational plan to educate its residents and owners about the
facts: not only why BEUDO is necessary but what in concrete terms lowering emissions will mean, and
when, for variously situated owners and/or residents. The hysteria and paranoia of the condo associations
should embarrass a city as prosperous and highly educated as Cambridge, and it's painful for residents to
suffer so much anxiety needlessly. Big changes can't be made successfully against the will of the people--who
have, if little other power, the powers of rumor and sabotage. You need to reach out and explain to them, to
us, what the need and benefits of such action are and will be, and what local, state and federal assistance and
subsidies are available.
Thanks for your attention to these urgent concerns,

Re: BEUDO Amendment, June 26 City Council Meeting

To all:
I need to amend a couple of details in my earlier letter to you today, written under a time pressure that didn't
allow me to clarify the current status of buildings like mine, 36-42 Linnaean St. 1) I am happy to find that the
amendment I support does not in fact exclude condo buildings. The contribution of 50+ unit buildings to our
emissions is very significant.
2) I am now however puzzled as to why hardship arrangements with the city can only be made for individual
NON-resident condo buildings. Not sure what a "non-resident condo building" is, but surely there will be
situations in which some century-old resident condo buildings will be subject to enormous costs for retrofitting that can't be paid for by assessments on largely fixed-income owners on the schedule required, even
with the subsidies so far available from the federal government: the only way a century-old Harlow building
e.g. can reduce emissions 40% by 2030 is to replace its heating system, from oil-fueled steam heat to heat
pumps.
I firmly believe that condo buildings should not be excluded from the amended BEUDO regulations! But I do
think it would be wise to imagine that hardship compliance might sometimes be appropriate for individual
aging buildings, permitting re-negotiated reduction schedules. I think you'd get a lot less angry comment and
action from anxious condo associations
Thank you very much for your attention.

Support for BEUDO exemptions

Dear Councillors This is in support of the exemptions in the current BEUDO amendments for large apartment buildings and special
considerations for health centers, hospitals, churches and other places of worship.
The move toward decarbonizing heating/cooling systems must move forward in a data-driven way. The push for a 2035
goal is impractical ...according to Eversource...and will come with extraordinary costs for individuals and institutions.
AND without one jot of evidence that the push for Cambridge "to be first" will have any impact on the climate crisis if
the region as a whole moves toward 2050 as the (aspirational) target.

Strong BEUDO amendments please!

Dear City Councillors:
Thank you so much for your support thus far of a strong set of amendments to the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO).
As a scientist, and as someone who grew up in Cambridge, MA, before air conditioners were a safety matter in
the summer, and when winters were long and snowy, the climate crisis is a palpable reality to me, and I want
my city to be doing everything it can to reduce greenhouse emissions swiftly and equitably
We can draw on all the support now available at the state and national levels, and we can and must push our
building owners, including, importantly, institutional ones, to be doing their part in a meaningful way and not
just symbolic gestures or toothless words that will be too little too late.
Please represent my voice, and the voice of so many residents, and pass a final version of the BEUDO
amendments that is strong, vigorous, and adequate to the urgency at hand.
One specific possible modification to the amendments that I support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target
for new large lab, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these
buildings could undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about. As a
laboratory scientist, I know that the work that we do in labs has a large climate impact—but that with proper
rules and regulations it can and must be mitigated. The pharmaceutical industry in particular should not be
exempt from participating in necessarily strong emissions reductions: as an industry that spends vast sums in
the name of human health, nothing will bring as much health benefit as being part of the solution to prevent
catastrophic warming.
Thank you,
Mel Abrams

Dear City Councillors:

Strong BUEDO ammendments

Hello,
Ahead of the meeting on June 26th, I wanted to send a final message of support for the strongest amendments
to BUEDO.
Thanks to the City Council for continuing to support the strongest set of amendments to BUEDO. As a parent
of a small child in Cambridge it is heartening to know that the city is thinking critically about the future of our
kids. We can be the example of change.
One possible modification that I would like to support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target for new large
labs, scientific research, and medical facilities. Without this provision, emissions from these buildings could
undermine the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO is designed to bring about.
Again, our children's future is reliant on the choices that we make today. And even this seemingly small
modification will make a big impact.

Support strong BEUDO amendments

Dear Mayor and City Councillors:
I am writing as a father and homeowner to ask you to protect our city’s future by voting for
strong BEUDO Amendments. You have been working for a very long time on BEUDO
Amendments that are a good compromise for our residents, our universities and our business
owners. I hope on Monday you will pass strong BEUDO amendments without further
exemptions and additional compromising.
The climate crisis poses an existential threat to future generations and demands swift and
courageous climate action, so say no to any attempts to water down this good policy.
As a father, I want to make sure my kids can play outside in the renovated Sennot park without
suffering from a heat stroke I want them to be able to breathe clean air and continue to live in
our beautiful city as adults. As a property owner it is essential for me to know that my city is
doing all it can to protect my home, my biggest asset, from floods, extreme heat, depreciation
and other damage deriving from climate change.
I urge you to support a modification that would include a 2030 net zero target for new
construction after 2024. This would make sure that new large research and medical buildings
start as net zero. It makes sense for new construction to be built net zero, rather than being
retrofitted later.
I am hopeful you will pass a strong version of BEUDO and grateful for all your work on the
amendments.

City Council public comments in support of BEUDO ordinance, June 26, 2023
My name is Peter Crawley, I reside at 88 Thorndike Street and want to express my support for
adoption of the revised BEUDO ordinance without delay and without further amendment. I
have served on the Cambridge Climate Committee for over 10 years and also served on the
most recent Net Zero Action Plan Task Force.
Requiring building performance requirements has been studied in Cambridge for at least 10
years, starting with the original Net Zero Task Force formed in 2013. The Council set a goal to
reduce City-wide emissions by 20% by 2020, but instead of decreasing, emissions from buildings
increased by over 10% from 2012 – 2019, which proved the clear need for a regulatory
framework. Emissions from Cambridge buildings represent about 80% of total city-wide
emissions, and BEUDO buildings comprise about 70% of total building emissions, it therefore
becomes clear that reaching Cambridge’s carbon reduction goals (as well as those imposed by
the State), requires reducing emissions from existing buildings, including large residential
buildings.
Community Development proposed this BEUDO ordinance in November 2021 and after over 18
months of stakeholder engagement, a compromise ordinance is now before you for final
adoption. The ordinance evolved to include many features making it easier for stakeholders to
achieve Net Zero, including the use of Offsets. It also honors the capital planning process and
allows for compliance deferrals if building improvement plans are in the works, and in cases of
bonafide hardship. Rather than adding more exemptions to the ordinance, the City should
allow the BEUDO Review Board assess deferrals on a case by case basis. The ordinance is not
perfect and will undoubtedly be revised in future years to respond to changing technologies
and implementation challenges. But the most important thing is TO GET STARTED and move
into the implemention stage. We need to adopt BEUDO without any further watering-down and
let innovative building owners and industry experts work to achieve compliance.
I applaud City officials, Councilors and building owners for acknowledging the urgent need to
reduce emissions and for working-out a compromise BEUDO ordinance. And to those who
assert the BEUDO goals cannot be achieved, I remind them of the Chinese proverb: “The person
who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it”.

Strong BEUDO Amendments

Dear City Councillors,
Thank you for your support of amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance that will strenghten the
Ordinance.
A further amendment I do support is the inclusion of a 2030 net zero target for new large labs, scientific research, and
medical facilities. These large buildings will be exempt from the fossil-free new construction pilot project that
Cambridge is planning to be part of, so without this amendment, emissions from these buildings could substantially
weaken BEUDO.
The most recent IPCC report has warned that rich countries, responsible for a very disproportionate share of green
house gas emissions must redress this injustice by taking urgent actions to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2040. Many
citizens of Cambridge, including our youth have voiced their concerns about the climate crisis we are facing, which
threatens lives locally and globally. We are demanding change!
My young adult children and I want our beautiful city which has abundent resources and which has contributed a
disproportionate share of Green House Gases to step up and accept the challenge before us.
Thank you all for putting Cambridge in the role of responsible leadership in this most important issue of our time.

Urgent Call to Pass Strong Amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO)

Dear City Councillors,
I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for your continued support of the proposed amendments
to the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO). As a parent deeply concerned about the
climate crisis, I believe it is crucial for our city to take swift and equitable action to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.
I am encouraged by the progress we have made thus far and the support we have garnered at the
state and national levels. It is essential that we capitalize on this momentum and compel all building
owners, including institutions, to contribute their fair share in combating climate change.
I urge you to wholeheartedly represent not only my voice but also the voices of countless residents
who share the same concerns. It is imperative that we pass a final version of the BEUDO amendments
that is robust, proactive, and aligned with the urgency of the climate crisis we face.
In particular, I strongly support the inclusion of a 2030 net-zero target for new large lab, scientific
research, and medical facilities within the amendments. Failing to include this provision would risk
undermining the greenhouse gas reductions that BEUDO aims to achieve. These specific buildings
have the potential to contribute significantly to our emissions, and we cannot afford to overlook them
in our pursuit of a sustainable future.
By setting ambitious targets and holding these facilities accountable, we will ensure that our city
remains at the forefront of sustainability efforts, inspiring other communities to follow suit.
Once again, I express my heartfelt appreciation for your dedication and commitment to addressing
the climate crisis through the BEUDO amendments. The decisions you make now will shape the future
of our city and have far-reaching impacts on generations to come.
Please seize this opportunity to pass a final version of the amendments that reflects the urgency of
the situation and upholds our collective responsibility to safeguard our environment.

City Manager Agenda Item #7

Dear Mayor, City Councillors and City Clerk,
I am delighted and filled with pride to read the following City Manager's Agenda for Monday's City Council Meeting
7. Transmitting Communication from Yi-An Huang, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $4,000.00 to the
Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance account. These funds were awarded to the Summer
Food Program by Project Bread and will be used to enhance promotion and outreach, support activities, and for
program related supplies. CMA 2023 #180
This is almost exactly $4055 which Kids Fighting Against Hunger - Project Bread The Walk for Hunger raised. The team was made up of my neighbors, caring Cantabridgians and their family
and friends. As the name implies, it was led by Co-Captain Ileana (5 year old!) and Co-Captain Kamala (she is 20 months
old!). I can't thank enough the generous support that will enable food-insecure children to have nourishment food
through the summer!
I would like to thank Vice Mayor Alanna and Councillor Carlone on their years of dedicated services as they move
forward to new ventures. I remember Vice Mayor Alanna's enthusiastic support of Walk for Hunger going back to
2018. Looking through old email exchanges with her, it saddens me to note that In 2017, 11 funded agencies in
Cambridge received $41,700. Although the hunger insecurity persists, due to new ways of allocating funds, the City
received 1/10 of that amount. But I am sure other agencies received grants directly through the new procedure. I will
adjust my strategy for soliciting support in accordance with the new procedure.
Respectfully yours,

Today’s agenda for the last City Council meeting before the summer break is a story of two cities. On
one hand, we are ending on a high note of City Manager Agenda Item #7 announcing four-thousanddollar grant awarded to the Summer Food Program from the Project Bread. I want to thank publicly the
generous community support for the Kids Fighting Against Hunger Team led by 5-year-old cocaptain Ileana and her 20 months old sister Kamala of Norris Street. We were proud to have raised
$4055, just little over the grant we received!
On the other hand, we are ending on a low note of Policy Order #5, that "the City Manager is requested
to consider measures to improve the Cycling Safety Ordinance Business Impact Study." Please do not
adopt this policy order for the reasons I have amply documented in my letter to you this morning but
don’t have the time to present to you during this short comment time. I would welcome an opportunity
to present them at a separate meeting. Please don’t consider this Policy Order only by itself but in
conjunction with the contract with Volpe Center for the Study and the CDD’s presentation to the
Economic Development & University Relations Committee Meeting on May 2, 2023. By the deadline for
the City Manager’s report in this order, Volpe Center would have delivered Final Deliverables for Task 4 Finalize Report & Data Summary Template on 8/10/2023. So, is this Policy Order requesting the City
Manager to start the study again from the beginning?
The Volpe Center contract is yet another case for my call for an audit of CSO implementation. The
contract points to the way the Purchasing Department constructs a contract with making sure all the I’s
are dotted and all the t’s are crossed. In the case of the Economic Study contract, the City missed
inconsistent deliverable schedule in the Statement of Work and didn’t even assign a Cambridge
Purchasing Department’s file number.
Thank you

Reject Policy Order #5 re measures to improve the CSO Business Impact Study

(1).pdf

Dear Mayor, City Councillors and City Clerk,
Please reject Policy Order #5, that "the City Manager is requested to consider measures to improve the
Cycling Safety Ordinance Business Impact Study" for the reasons I have amply documented in my
correspondences on this matter forwarded below and in the two attachments. Please note that I incorrectly
identified Councillor Toner as one of the sponsors of POR 2021 #259 in Post 5_2_Committee Meeting Letter to
Chair Toner. That should have been former Councillor Toomey.
I am also attaching Volpe Agreement No. VP140023 for your reference.
Please consider the following before you debate this Policy Order (PO):

1. City signed
in spite of the fact
that the due dates for the deliverables in the text of the Task description are not consistent with the dates in
the summary table in the Statement Of Work. And please note that the Agreement has Volpe Center file
number and not the Cambridge's. My repeated request to the Public Records Access Officer for the Request for
Proposal and list of bidders have not been responded to.
2. The Contract is a "Best Effort (not fixed price), no fee basis" contract. So what is the consequence of this PO on
this contract if adopted?
3. Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) Economic Impact Study Update presented by Community Development
Department (CDD) to the Economic Development & University Relations Committee Meeting on May 2, 2023
seems to be consistent with Deliverables for Task 1, Develop Study Methodology & Finalize Economic Data Set
which was due almost 3 months earlier on 2/10/2023 assuming 1/10/2023 start (i.e. City advanced the
estimated cost of $100,000 upon approval of the Agreement per the Contract)
4. According to the Deliverable Schedule, by now Volpe Center should be wrapping up a draft of the Finalize Report
& Data Summary Template due on 7/10/2023.
5. This PO is requesting the City Manager to "report back to the City Council on these matters by September 1,
2023, outlining the proposed improvements to the business impact study for separated bicycle lanes, including
the incorporation of objective data sources, collaboration with external partners, and strategies for gathering

feedback and ideas from businesses." But Volpe Center would have delivered Final Deliverables for Task 4 Finalize Report & Data Summary Template on 8/10/2023. So, is this PO requesting the CM to go back to Task
1? And what consequences will that have on the Contract with Volpe?
6. The public has the right to know what transpired since the CSO Impact Study Update presentation by CDD on
May 2, 2023 to warrant this apparent restart. I, for one, demand an explanation and demand an audit of CSO
Implementation by the City Auditor who reports directly to the City Council, as I have been asking in previous
communications.
Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim
Norris Street

Dear Chairman Toner,
Thank you for getting the Community Development Department (CDD) presentations on the Agenda Packet and thank
you and your committee for reporting back on your meeting.
However, I am totally disappointed and deeply concerned. The City Council accepting your Committee's report without
any discussion proves, yet again, how desperately we need reforms in the City governance. The two reports from CDD
should not have been accepted in the first place by your Committee let alone reporting back to the City Council.
Through you, please require CDD to provide documents highlighted and in bold red below. Furthermore, from now on,
any report from the City departments to the City Council that are based on outside contractors should include
deliverable schedules and delivered documents as I am constantly finding City reports are one step behind what the
contractors are doing. The City is presenting their version of the delivered documents to the community to gather
feedback when in fact the City has already accepted the contractor's deliverables and had given them permission to
proceed. This is my observation based on public records I have obtained through 29 (and counting) Public Records
Requests and even appealing to the State Public Records Office on some of the denied requests.
According to the minutes of the City Council on 5/15/2023:
