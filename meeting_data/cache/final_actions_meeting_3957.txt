proposal in the strongest possible terms. This proposal is far too reminiscent of the racist,
xenophobic, classist urban renewal projects of years past, such as Boston's New York Streets project,
the first urban renewal project in Boston, and its more famous follow-up, the replacement of the
West End with the sterile towers of Charles River Park.

FIRST IN COUNCIL

September 29, 2021

To the Honorable City Council:
The undersigned registered Cambridge voters respectfully request that the City Council ordain the
ordinance language set forth below relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation
Districts in the city.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access
21st Century Values for Neighborhood Conservation Districts
We invite you to join us in asking the City to improve the way that we create and operate Neighborhood
Conservation Districts in Cambridge. Intended to serve the worthy goals of helping communities to
preserve historic structures and maintain neighborhoods as they are, Neighborhood Conservation Districts
have too often been exploited unfairly as a means by which tiny, unrepresentative groups of residents can
exploit our city ordinances to control their neighbors’ choices and housing options. Recently in
Cambridge, we have seen small groups of homeowners initiate the process of establishing new
Neighborhood Conservation Districts in order to raise their property values, settle interpersonal disputes,
and restrict development potential below even that allowed by zoning. None of those purposes matches
Cambridge’s values, and yet that behavior is currently enabled by our City ordinances.
The current ordinance language was drafted 40 years ago and needs to be updated to reflect modern
community values related to diversity, access, equity, representation, and inclusion. The ordinance
governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts currently allows just ten
unrepresentative residents to launch a lengthy study of a Conservation District in an area that might be
home to thousands of residents and burden their homes with binding rules. A study can be initiated by the
appointed members Cambridge Historical Commission without any input or say so from our
democratically elected City Council. A study places binding rules on a neighborhood from the Historical
Commission that no one in the neighborhood outside of the Historical Commission’s Study Commission
has approved of or consented to, and, according to an opinion issued by City Solicitor Nancy Glowa,
those rules can remain in place for as many years as the Historical Commission wants to study them. The
membership appointed to the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions in no way reflects the
diversity of their neighborhoods with age, race, ethnicity, renter status, or a host of other factors, tending
to confer additional power and privilege to the already powerful and privileged.
This petition proposes changes to the ordinance governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood
Conservation Districts with a view to increasing the democratic legitimacy of our Conservation Districts
by empowering the members of the neighborhoods they govern and by introducing essential democratic
checks and balances to the process. The main goals of this petition are:

•
•

•

Increasing the democratic threshold required to begin a Conservation District Study
Ensuring that the goals of Neighborhood Conservation District are balanced with other City goals
of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all City neighborhoods and the need to address the housing
supply and cost crisis
Ensuring that the democratically elected City Council has a voice in starting a new study

Packet Pg. 2

•
•

Ensuring that the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and the rules governing
Neighborhood Conservation Districts are reflective of the diversity of our neighborhoods
Ensuring that no binding rules are imposed on neighborhoods without the consent of the governed

We find no fault with the intent behind the original ordinance language, and we believe that it likely
represented the best thinking of the times to solve a social problem of importance to the community.
However, the world has learned a lot in the past forty years. Everyone in this city has learned a lot. And
we believe that the ordinance changes proposed below will help to better accomplish the ordinance’s
original goals by modernizing our Neighborhood Conservation Districts in accordance with our modern
values and increased understanding of the moral requirement for diversity, access, affordability, equity,
representation, and inclusion throughout community life.
We respectfully request ordination of the below changes to the language of Chapter 2.78 Article III.
Underlined sections represent the petitioners’ proposed new wording and struck through sections
represent proposed deletions.
The primary point of contact for this petition is Loren Crowe of 8 Museum Way, Apartment #508
Cambridge, MA 02141. He can be reached at 760-522-2101 or lorencrowe@gmail.com.

ordinance language set forth below relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood
Conservation Districts in the city.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access
21st Century Values for Neighborhood Conservation Districts
We invite you to join us in asking the City to improve the way that we create and operate Neighborhood
Conservation Districts in Cambridge. Intended to serve the worthy goals of helping communities to
preserve historic structures and maintain neighborhoods as they are, Neighborhood Conservation
Districts have too often been exploited unfairly as a means by which tiny, unrepresentative groups of
residents can exploit our city ordinances to control their neighbors’ choices and housing options.
Recently in Cambridge, we have seen small groups of homeowners initiate the process of establishing
new Neighborhood Conservation Districts in order to raise their property values, settle interpersonal
disputes, and restrict development potential below even that allowed by zoning. None of those
purposes matches Cambridge’s values, and yet that behavior is currently enabled by our City ordinances.
The current ordinance language was drafted 40 years ago and needs to be updated to reflect modern
community values related to diversity, access, equity, representation, and inclusion. The ordinance
governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts currently allows just ten
unrepresentative residents to launch a lengthy study of a Conservation District in an area that might be
home to thousands of residents and burden their homes with binding rules. A study can be initiated by
the appointed members Cambridge Historical Commission without any input or say so from our
democratically elected City Council. A study places binding rules on a neighborhood from the Historical
Commission that no one in the neighborhood outside of the Historical Commission’s Study Commission
has approved of or consented to, and, according to an opinion issued by City Solicitor Nancy Glowa,
those rules can remain in place for as many years as the Historical Commission wants to study them. The
membership appointed to the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions in no way reflects the
diversity of their neighborhoods with age, race, ethnicity, renter status, or a host of other factors,
tending to confer additional power and privilege to the already powerful and privileged.
This petition proposes changes to the ordinance governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood
Conservation Districts with a view to increasing the democratic legitimacy of our Conservation Districts
by empowering the members of the neighborhoods they govern and by introducing essential
democratic checks and balances to the process. The main goals of this petition are:







Increasing the democratic threshold required to begin a Conservation District Study
Ensuring that the goals of Neighborhood Conservation District are balanced with other City goals
of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all City neighborhoods and the need to address the housing
supply and cost crisis
Ensuring that the democratically elected City Council has a voice in starting a new study
Ensuring that the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and the rules governing
Neighborhood Conservation Districts are reflective of the diversity of our neighborhoods



Ensuring that no binding rules are imposed on neighborhoods without the consent of the
governed

We find no fault with the intent behind the original ordinance language, and we believe that it likely
represented the best thinking of the times to solve a social problem of importance to the community.
However, the world has learned a lot in the past forty years. Everyone in this city has learned a lot. And
we believe that the ordinance changes proposed below will help to better accomplish the ordinance’s
original goals by modernizing our Neighborhood Conservation Districts in accordance with our modern
values and increased understanding of the moral requirement for diversity, access, affordability, equity,
representation, and inclusion throughout community life.
We respectfully request ordination of the below changes to the language of Chapter 2.78 Article III.
Underlined sections represent the petitioners’ proposed new wording and struck through sections
represent proposed deletions.

Subject: please include with meeting materials for September 30 Ordinance Committee hearing
I am writing to express my opposition to this proposal in the strongest possible terms. This proposal is far too
reminiscent of the racist, xenophobic, classist urban renewal projects of years past, such as Boston's New York Streets
project, the first urban renewal project in Boston, and its more famous follow-up, the replacement of the West End with
the sterile towers of Charles River Park.
In both cases, thriving, dense ethnic neighborhoods of working poor people and affordable businesses that provided for
their needs were taken by, in the first case, the Boston Housing Authority and, in the second, the newly created Boston
Redevelopment Authority and bulldozed so that they could be replaced by private development that would bring in
more tax money. The New York Streets were obliterated, except for Albany Street, and a printing plant for the Boston
Herald Traveler and other industrial facilities built in their place. As Boston's South End became more and more of a
playground for the wealthy and the newspaper business less lucrative, the Herald cashed in and moved elsewhere,
leaving the area to expensive condo developments with cute names like Sepia and Ink Block.
This proposal follows upon a sustained campaign against the establishment of a neighborhood conservation district in
East Cambridge that was prompted by repeated instances of developers buying beautiful old homes from East
Cambridge's past as a home for both factory workers and factory owners, stripping them of all of their historic trim,
adding incongruous modern gewgaws like picture windows, and making them completely unaffordable to anyone
without a huge amount of money.
The proponent and his compatriots organized outside groups of fellow zealots to descend upon study group meetings,
much as the Tea Party descended upon town halls held by elected members of Congress to answer constituents'
questions about the Affordable Care Act, and make it impossible for the meeting to continue. They verbally abused city
staff, members of the Cambridge Historical Commission and other members of the city-appointed study group, and
residents in attendance. Much of the opposition has been expressed in blatantly ageist terms, as though Cambridge
residents should have no voice in civic affairs once they reach some arbitrary cut-off age. At least one of the members of
this Ordinance Committee expressed enthusiastic support for this hooliganism. It is commonplace for this Councillor and
others to go on at length about the need to protect and support our frail elders, so it appears that elders who aren't frail
deserve nothing but scorn and derision from our elected officials and our neighbors.
East Cambridge and other dense parts of Cambridge were redlined because they were full of immigrants, mostly Italians,
according to the notes on the old HOLC maps. Many of the current residents of these neighborhoods are the children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those same reviled immigrants, but this proposal would toss them aside, as
has happened before, so that their homes can be torn down and replaced with something more attractive to today's
techies, life science researchers, and others attracted to the high-paying jobs in the millions of square feet of
commercial development surrounding and encroaching on these old working-class ethnic neighborhoods.

Another aspect of this proposal that reflects a disturbing trend in current-day America is the disdain for expertise.
Currently, neighborhood conservation district commission members are chosen for knowledge of the neighborhood or
relevant experience, such as in historic preservation, architecture and the like. This proposal would remove those very
reasonable requirements in preference to a performative box-checking of how many renters versus how many
homeowners or how many people of color. Of course, these commissions should include people of varying backgrounds,
but expertise in the areas the members will be called upon to evaluate should be a given instead of a mark against an
applicant.
In sum, this proposal is a distillation of just about every type of malgovernance we sanctimoniously decry elsewhere,
because the proponent has a vendetta and a political agenda that override all considerations of good governance and
neighborliness. The Ordinance Committee should pass on this bad idea; there is nothing worth saving in it.

Issue - Initiating a Study: Only ten signatures are required to submit an NCD
petition that can then be approved by the CHC, not the Council
Why is this an issue?
• CHC voted for the East Cambridge NCD (ECNCD) petition, signed by 25
residents, mostly affiliated with a homeowners group
– Increase home prices, defend against development
• The hastily submitted 13-voter University Park NCD petition had four signers
withdraw. Opponents gathered 113 signatures in days
– The CHC vote to move forward with the study was still uncomfortably close

• Studies are work, which goes on for years; significant demands on residents
• CHC not a forum to balance non-historical city goals, such as those related to
housing affordability
• The Council can balance city wide goals and needs

• Community Diversity: ECNCD study commissioners and study participants are
generally older white homeowners
• Meetings not well attended, averaging 25.7 people on a call (including staff,
councillors, press, etc.)
• CHC Director on the difficulty working people and people with families have
attending years of evening meetings: “That’s life”
• Professional experience requirements guarantee a professional and class bias
– Commissions should represent stakeholders and balance professional and lived
experience

• Viewpoint Diversity: Skeptics were largely excluded from ECNCD study
committee and then the study process

Issue – Estimating Impacts on the Housing Crisis: Currently, there is no
requirement to analyze or estimate what impacts NCDs may have on our housing
crisis, in terms of cost or anything else

Attachment: 4. NCD Petition - Ordinance Committee Presentation 9.29.21 (COM 522 #2021

There is currently no ordinance requirement to study the
impact of NCDs on our housing crisis

Why is this an issue?
• Opponents and proponents agree, research suggest that historical preservation
districting increases home values
• Original ECNCD proponents touted increased home values as a positive benefit
of an NCD to a homeowners group
– Even cited a well regarded study
– Price increases benefit incumbent owners, harm renters and future buyers
• CHC Director told Commission members that NCDs have no impact on housing
prices at August, 2019 meeting
– Wellesley, Nashville, Tucson, many other Historical Commissions, and a
deep research consensus, all disagree

Conservation Status and Residential Transaction Prices: Initial Evidence
from Dallas, Texas. Diaz III, et al. Journal of Economic Research. Johns
Hopkins University. 2008
“The results of this study demonstrate a positive and statistically
significant relationship between residential sale prices and properties
located within conservation districts. There is also evidence of a spillover
premium for property adjacent to the conservation districts. On average,
the results suggest that conservation districts increase the value of
residential properties in and around the districts. These findings, including
the magnitude of the found premiums, are consistent with the majority of
the historical district papers.”
Diaz (2008) found a price premium for home in studied NCDs of 17.6%.

Home prices are going up for lots of reasons in Cambridge.
NCDs likely add one more
NCDs are not the only factor demonstrated to increase home prices, but
they can make a bad situation worse.
As with climate change, we need to look holistically at multiple factors that
add up to make a problem worse, and we can’t ignore a potential policy
intervention simply because it’s a partial solution.

It has been suggested that NCDs and Historical districts are different and
non-comparable.

neighborhood conservation district commission shall have like

Give how similar NCDs are allowed to
be to Historical Districts, it’s perhaps
not surprising that they have similar
effects on prices

• POR 2020 #208: “ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is
requested to confer with the Cambridge Historical Commission and other
relevant City Departments to ensure that any report or recommendation for a
new Neighborhood Conservation District in Cambridge presented to the City
Council include an analysis of the potential effects on City housing
affordability based on current research…”
• No such analysis is found in the ECNCD draft report, nor is any planned
• Instead of analyzing current research, CHC asked CDD to conduct a “study”
–
–
–
–

Scraped Craigslist rental data and compared simple averages of home prices in
and out of Cambridge NCDs
CDD was careful to say usefulness was limited because no controls were in place
• Those caveats don’t appear in ECNCD draft report
Authoritative peer reviewed research already exists, and benefits from
sophisticated and statistically significant methodologies
As with vaccine studies, we can trust peer-reviewed research from other cities.
We don’t need to “do our own research”

The council has already asked for research based
assessments of cost of NCDs

Research exists on the cost effects of NCDs, and is available
to the CHC
• CHC’s ECNCD draft report says that research on NCDs is limited
–

Cites no sources to support that statement

• Could have found many sources in “Fiscal Impact of Local Historic
Preservation and Neighborhood Conservation Zoning on Residential Property
Values” by Eric Hill, in 2015
–

–

“On average, we have seen the increase in property values within [Historic
Preservation] zoned districts at a higher percentage than that of their
Neighborhood Conservation District counterparts, and more so neighborhoods
without protections.”
“It should also be noted that HP and NCD districts tend to benefit the middle and
upper class historic neighborhoods and limit low-income residents as to what
they can afford.”

• I have offered to help CHC staff comply with POR 2020 #208. I have offered to
present to the ECNCD commission. I have been rebuffed.

Issue - Ordinance grants NCD commissions jurisdiction over projects that would
otherwise be allowed under the AHO
Why is this an issue?
• The potential exists for viable AHO projects to be blocked or subject to undue
regulatory hurdles, or in some cases not proposed because of an NCD.
• The potential exists for residents to undermine the spirit of the city-wide
nature of the AHO by placing an NCD over their particular neighborhood.
• We have seen an effort by a small group of residents in East Cambridge to use
NCD to limit dimensions and setbacks below zoning in an attempt to use an
NCD to accomplish land use changes that should require a down zoning.
Petition Goal (1): Amend the ordinance so that AHO projects are exempt from
NCD commissions review
Amendment 9 (2.78.170): AHO supersedes NCD jurisdiction

Create an environment of study, not enforcement
Issue - Binding rules preempt consent: On the first day of a new NCD study, all
projects within the NCD study boundaries are subject to binding rules the
Historical Commission has taken from other existing NCDs in the city.

Why is this an issue?
• The rules used may or may not be proposed by the CHC at the end of the study
period or adopted by the City Council.
• Rules crafted for one neighborhood may not be appropriate for another.
• Residents within the study area have no opportunity to consent to the rules
used.
Petition Goal: The purpose of review of building and renovation permit
applications should be to gather information over the year-long study period, and
to solicit positive interaction between residents and the CHC.

Issue – Currently, the ordinance is ambiguous on the point of whether an NCD
study can be extended beyond an initial one-year statutory period.
Why is this an issue?
• The ECNCD remained in place for two years - with permit applicants subjected
to binding NCD commission review for the entire time.
-

While the basis was the pandemic, when the process resumed only the time remaining
at the halt of meetings should have been added, not an additional year.

• Based on this interpretation, the Historical Commission could have extended
the review even further and kept the binding review in place.
Petition Goal: Make explicit that NCD Study Commission jurisdiction to review
permits on a study area ends after one year. An exception would allow an
extension under a declared state of emergency.

NCD Reform Petition at Ordinance

Dear Chairs McGovern and Carlone,
Justin Saif, Mary Ellen Doran, and I are grateful for the opportunity tomorrow to present our petition to modernize the
processes that govern the creation, approval, and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts in Cambridge.
We have a few documents that we hope will help during the hearing.
1. NCD Petition: Issues, Goals, and Proposed Solutions - This is our attempt to identify the issues that we are trying
to address with this petition and the solutions that we have proposed by way of amendments to the ordinance.
2. Annotated Petition Text for Ordinance - This is a google document that shows the redline version of our petition.
This redline document is linked to from the Goals document, so clicking on a link in the proposed solutions
document will take you to the appropriate reference in the redline text. We hope these two documents help to
show what we're hoping to accomplish with the committee's help.
3. Further Suggested Amendments - We have several further suggestions to make that we believe would improve
the petition, all of which are responses to specific helpful requests or suggestions from several Councillors with
whom we spoke in the lead-up to tomorrow's hearing. The paragraphs in this document could replace their
counterparts in the original petition if the committee so wished.
Thank you for your consideration on this matter, and we look forward to working with the committee towards
improvements to our NCD processes.
Best regards,
Loren Crowe

Commission, may be a Cambridge resident who lives outside the district. The remaining alternates shall
be neighborhood property owners. The neighborhood conservation district commission shall act solely
in the exercise of those functions described in this article which are applicable to the district under its
administration.
B.
Any member or alternate of the Historical Commission may be appointed to a neighborhood
conservation district commission for a term coterminous with such person's term as a member or
alternate of the Historical Commission. Members and alternates of a neighborhood conservation district
commission who are not members of the Historical Commission shall by reason of experience or
education have demonstrable knowledge and concern for improvement, conservation and enhancement
of the district, and at least two of the members or alternates shall have professional qualifications
related to real estate or architecture or historic preservation. The members of the neighborhood
conservation district commission shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diverse

alternate shall continue in office after expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly appointed
and qualified, except that no member shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
C.
The neighborhood conservation district commission shall elect annually a Chairman and
Vice-Chairman from its own number. In the case of absence, inability to act, or unwillingness to act
because of self-interest on the part of a member, his or her place shall be taken by an alternate member
designated by the Chairman, if available, otherwise by the Vice-Chairman if available, otherwise by a
majority vote of the members and alternate members of the Commission present. The person exercising
the function of Executive Director of the Historical Commission shall serve as secretary of each
neighborhood conservation district commission. Persons serving as members or alternate members of a
neighborhood conservation district commission shall, as a result of such service, be considered as
"special municipal employees" for purposes of Chapter 268A of the General Laws.
(Ord. 1331, 12/14/2009; Ord. 1166 § 8, 1995; Ord. 1002 (part), 1983: prior code § 2-147(k)(3))

2.78.170 Powers and duties.
The Historical Commission and each neighborhood conservation district commission shall have like
powers, functions and duties with respect to each landmark and neighborhood conservation district over
which it has jurisdiction as is provided Historic District Commissions under clauses (a) through (g) under
Section 10 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws with respect to historic districts, including without
limitation with respect to the approval and disapproval of certificates of appropriateness,
nonapplicability and hardship, the dating and signing of such certificates, the keeping of records and

2.78.180 Designation procedures.
A.
The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a landmark any
property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or object which it determines to
be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad
architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City or the Commonwealth or
(2) historically or architecturally significant (in terms of period, style, method of construction or
association with a famous architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures;
may recommend for designation as a neighborhood conservation district any area within the City
containing places and structures which it determines are of importance to the architectural, aesthetic,
cultural, political, economic or social history of the City, and which considered together cause such area
to constitute a distinctive neighborhood or to have a distinctive character in terms of its exterior
features; and may recommend amendments to any designation of landmark or neighborhood
conservation district theretofore made.

B.
Prior to the recommendation of designation or amendment of designation of any landmark or
neighborhood conservation district an investigation and report on the historical, architectural and other
relevant significance thereof shall be made. The report shall recommend the boundaries of any proposed
landmark or neighborhood conservation district and shall recommend for incorporation in the order of
the City Council designating each landmark or neighborhood conservation district general and/or specific
standards and appropriate criteria consistent with the purposes of this article and the provisions of
Section 2.78.190 of this article that are to be applied in making any determination of the type referred to
in Sections 2.78.170, 2.78.210 and 2.78.220 of this article, with respect to the designated landmark or
within the designated neighborhood conservation district.
C.
In the case of a landmark, the report shall be prepared by the Historical Commission. In the case
of a neighborhood conservation district, the report shall be prepared by a study committee consisting of
three members or alternates of the Historical Commission and four persons appointed by the City
Manager, including at least one person who resides in the district under consideration, at least one
person who owns property in the district under consideration, and one person who owns property or
resides elsewhere in the City and has demonstrated knowledge and concern for conservation and
enhancement of those exterior features of the City which are important to its distinctive character.
D.
Any ten registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission initiate, or the
Historical Commission on its own may initiate, the process of designating a landmark or neighborhood
conservation district or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore made. The Commission
shall within forty-five days following the filing of such request or petition hold a preliminary hearing and
arrange for the preparation of a report and, if required, request the appointment of a study committee.
The Historical Commission shall not reconsider a proposed designation, amendment or rescission of
designation within one year of its previous hearing thereon, unless two-thirds of all its members vote to
do so. No later than forty-five days after the transmittal of a report to the Commission pertaining to a
proposed designation, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The Commission shall give not less
than fourteen days notice of such public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City and by mailing notice thereof to the owner of the proposed landmark and to every owner
abutting the proposed landmark or within the proposed neighborhood conservation district, each such
owner to be determined from the then current records of the Assessing Department, and to the City
Manager, the Planning Board and the City Clerk.
E.
Prior to the public hearing, the Commission shall transmit copies of the report to the Planning
Board for its consideration and recommendations.

Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation
Districts Diversity, Equity, Access, and Inclusion Petition
Discussion of Issues, Goals, and Proposed Solutions
1. Issue - Signature threshold: It only takes 10-registered voter signatures to initiate a
Neighborhood Conservation District process and put it on the Historical Commission’s
agenda.
a. Effect: A small handful of residents can place a neighborhood where hundreds,
or in the case of the East Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District
(ECNCD), perhaps thousands of residents live under onerous and often costly
rules that only a tiny fraction of residents have consented to or even been made
aware of.
b. Goal: Increase the number of community members involved in the NCD creation
process before it reaches the Historical Commission.
c. Petition solutions:
i.
Increase the individual property landmarking threshold to 30 registered
voters and the Neighborhood Conservation District (NCD) petition
threshold to 100 registered voters in order to encourage wider
neighborhood input during initial petition process
1. Amendment 11 (2.78.180 D) - Petition thresholds
ii.
Transfer the authority to begin a study over to the democratically elected
City Council, which has more direct connections to residents than the
unelected members of Cambridge Historical Commission (CHC)
1. Amendment 12 (2.78.180 D) - City Council study approval
2. Amendment 17 (2.78.180 I) - City Council study approval
2. Current issue with the ordinance: There is currently no requirement for diversity on
NCD commissions (only diversity of opinions expressed in the creation of the district).
a. Effect: City Manager appointed NCD commissions are overwhelmingly
composed of older white homeowners who are unable to speak for the lived
experiences of the residents in their neighborhoods, which heaps additional
unearned power and privilege onto the already powerful and privileged at the
expense of their neighbors. Current home owning ECNCD Commissioners have
demonstrated their lack of ability to empathize with their fellow neighbors by
making disparaging remarks about renters at Study Commission meetings and
citing increased property values as a positive effect of initiating an NCD in East
Cambridge rather than as a negative burden on the overwhelming majority of
East Cambridge residents who rent.
Further, the current ordinance requires that community members appointed to
NCD Commissions be selected on the limited basis of their education or
professional backgrounds, which creates a (no doubt unintended) viewpoint bias

e

on NCD commissions by stacking them with only members from similarly high
education and high income professions. As we now know, NCDs affect more than
architecture. They affect housing, access to schools, access to jobs, public
health, public safety, and more, and limiting Commission representation to those
with “experience or education” related to neighborhood preservation or “real
estate or architecture or historic preservation” as the ordinance does currently,
has resulted in Commission members who can speak well to those narrow,
specific professional viewpoints, but far lessor not at all to other more pressing
experiences in the neighborhood. “Those closest to the pain should be closest to
the power.” Knowing what it’s like to search for affordable housing, face housing
insecurity, operate a small, low-margin retail establishment, or struggle to keep
children in quality schools are all are all common experiences in our diverse
neighborhoods and among the many that would give a resident or worker
valuable insight into question posed to our NCD Commissions. Just as we
wouldn’t staff the Police Advisory Board with only police officers, or we wouldn’t
want a City Council composed only of lawyers, we shouldn’t want NCD
Commissions with members drawn only from a narrow band of professional or
socio-economic backgrounds. Representation matters.
b. Proposed solutions:
i.
Require that commissions reflect and consider the diversity of the
neighborhoods
1. Amendment 2 (2.78.140) - Balance conservation with modern civic
goals
2. Amendment 3 (2.78.140) - Balance civic values related to
conservation
3. Amendment 4 (2.78.160 A) - Commission membership
4. Amendment 5 (2.78.160 B) - Diversity on Commissions
5. Amendment 10 (2.78.180 C) - Commission membership
ii.
Require that renters be represented on NCD commissions
1. Amendment 4 (2.78.160 A) - Commission membership
2. Amendment 10 (2.78.180 C) - Commission membership
iii.
Remove appointed and unrepresentative Historical Commission members
from NCD Commissions, but retain CHC staff to administer Commissions
1. Amendment 4 2.78.160 A - Commission membership
iv.
Remove classist/professional selection bias by removing the requirement
that NCD Commission members be appointed on the basis of their
professional backgrounds
1. Amendment 4 (2.78.160 A) - Commission membership
2. Amendment 10 (2.78.180 C) - Commission membership
3. Current issue with the ordinance: Local and small businesses are not provided with
representation by statute on NCDs, nor is affected business community input required

e

prior to starting an NCD study, even when the study area encompases commercial
districts that contain many businesses.
a. Effect: The ECNCD study commenced and included the commercial zone on
Cambridge Street despite an explicit formal request from the East Cambridge
Business Association that Cambridge Street be excluded. The subsequent NCD
study has focused almost exclusively on residential issues, and the study
committee only has one business owner who can be, and has been, consistently
voted against by the other members.
b. Proposed solutions:
i.
Require that businesses be represented on NCD commissions
1. Amendment 4 (2.78.160 A) - Commission membership
2. Amendment 10 (2.78.180 C) - Commission membership
ii.
Require that the opinion of affected business associations be included
with any study recommendation forwarded to the City Council by the
Historical Commission
1. Amendment 16 (2.78.180 F) - Forecasting effects on housing and
businesses
4. Current issue with the ordinance: There is no requirement to notify residents,
including renters, of a study process under consideration by mail. The only requirement
specified by the ordinance is to notify homeowners.
a. Effect: Many renters were not aware that the EDNCD study was being proposed
in the first place, since they were not notified. Renters and non-owning residents
were not notified that a study had commenced until very late into the study
process, after a great deal of work had been done. The CHC and several NCCD
Commission members maintained for nearly a year that renters had no place in
the process.
b. Proposed solution:
i.
Require that all residents within the proposed NCD be treated equally by
the ordinance whether they are renters or homeowners
1. Amendment 15 (2.78.180 D) - Treating renters and owners equally
5. Current issue with the ordinance: The ordinance, written decades ago before
Cambridge was experiencing a housing affordability crisis and before the existence of
the current research consensus that shows that NCDs have generally negative effects
on housing affordability, does not require or even suggest that housing affordability
should be a consideration falling under the purview of NCD commissions or the
Historical Commissions.
a. Effect: Housing affordability is a top priority of Cambridge residents and the City
Council, and yet the ECNCD study has gone on for 18 months without a genuine
discussion of the overwhelming body of research that shows that historic
preservation districting raises home prices in and in the vicinity of districts. The
CHC has been free to bypass the issue despite the City Council’s wishes
expressed in a non-binding policy order last year. The CHC did ask the

Packet Pg. 90

Attachment: Loren_1. NCD Petition_ Issues, Goals and Proposed Solutions (COM 523 #2021 : A communication was received from Loren

e

Community Development Department (CDD) to look at rent prices in existing
Cambridge NCDs and compare them to non-NCD areas of cambridge. That
project was based on flawed data scraped from Craigslist rental listings by an
intern with no advanced statistical training who’s analysis consisted of long
division. A more appropriate effort would be to review the current findings of peer
reviewed literature studying NCDs and their effects on housing prices and use
their findings to project what effects we would see from NCDs in Cambridge.
b. Petition solutions:
i.
Make explicit that preservation efforts need to be balanced with city wide
affordability goals
1. Amendment 3 (2.78.140) - Balance civic values related to
conservation
ii.
Require the Historical Commission to include a report on the impact of the
designation on housing and renovation costs
1. Amendment 16 (2.78.180 F) - Forecasting effects on housing
costs
6. Current issue with the ordinance: As drafted, the ordinance grants NCD commissions
jurisdiction over projects that would otherwise be allowed as of right under the Affordable
Housing Overlay (AHO) or over dimensional factors allowed under applicable zoning.
a. Effect: The potential exists currently for otherwise viable AHO projects to be
blocked due to added NCD regulatory hurdles or to not be proposed at all due to
fear of added costs or regulatory hurdles. Potential exists for residents to
undermine the spirit of the city-wide nature of the AHO by placing an NCD over
their particular neighborhood.
Further, we have seen a desire and subsequent effort by a small group of
residents in East Cambridge to use an NCD to limit dimensions and setbacks
below what would be allowed under applicable zoning ordinance provisions.
Under current ordinance language, NCDs can claim jurisdiction over dimensions
and setbacks, but If a traditional downzoning still requires a City Council
supermajority and an NCD can be approved by a simple majority, then NCDs
provide an opportunity to circumvent current democratic thresholds to accomplish
something with five city council votes that should require six.
b. Proposed solution:
i.
Amend the text so that NCD commissions shall have no powers over
AHO projects.
1. Amendment 9 (2.78.170) - AHO Supersedes NCD jurisdiction
2. Amendment 24 (2.78.210 C) - AHO supersedes NCD jurisdiction
ii.
Amend the text so that NCD Commission shall have no power to restrict
dimensional and setback requirements below those required by
applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance.
1. Amendment 25 (2.78.220 A) - NCDs may not limit dimensions and
setbacks below zoning

7. Current issue with the ordinance: Climate resiliency and renewable energy features
are currently subject to review by NCD commissions.
a. Effect: NCD review potentially adds costs and barriers to adoption of climate
resiliency and renewable energy features.
b. Proposed solution:
i.
Exempt climate resiliency and renewable energy features from NCD
jurisdiction.
1. Amendment 19 (2.78.180 I) - Exempting climate resilience factors
2. Amendment 22 (2.78.190 A) - Exempting climate resiliency factors
8. Current issue with the ordinance: NCD study period takes place under binding rules
imposed by the Historical Commission that the affected neighborhood have not had the
opportunity to consent.
a. Effect: All projects within the NCD study boundaries are subject to binding rules
that may or may not be proposed by the CHC at the end of the study period or
adopted by the City Council. Rules crafted for another neighborhood are
inappropriately applied to the neighborhood under study. The purpose of review
of building and renovation permit applications by the CHC should be to gather
information about the quantity and character of proposed changes to the built
environment over a year-long study period. That information can be gathered
under non binding review.
b. Proposed solutions:
i.
Conduct NCD studies under non-binding review standard
1. Amendment 18 (2.78.180 I) - Non binding review during studies

9. Current issue with the ordinance: Currently, the ordinance is ambiguous on the point
of whether an NCD study can be extended beyond an initial one year statutory period
a. Effect: The Ordinance can reasonably be read currently as limiting the time
under which NCD rules adopted for the purpose of conducting a study to one
year, but the Historical Commission and the City Solicitor read it otherwise. The
ECNCD remained in place for two years, meaning that permit applications were
subject to binding NCD Commission review for two years instead of the initial one
without any community consent or City Council Approval. Previous studies have
kept NCD rules in place for longer, also without any community consent or City
Council approval. One year is more than enough time to gather data needed to
inform Study Commission decision making processes.
b. Proposed solution:
i.
Make explicit that NCD Study Commission jurisdiction to review permits
and impose rules on a study area ends after one year, even if the study
commission needs to extend its meetings and deliberations beyond the
one year review period in order to complete its work on a potential NCD
proposal. One year of project review is more than enough time to gather

e

information about the types of projects being proposed in the
neighborhood. An exception would allow an extension under a declared
state of emergency.
1. Amendment 20 (2.78.180 I) - Study review ends after one year
10. Current issue with the ordinance: NCDs, once approved, operate in perpetuity without
any opportunity for City Council review.
a. Effect: NCDs may operate under rules and regulations adopted long ago that
would not be consented to by current residents or Councillors.
b. Proposed solution:
i.
Require City Council and neighborhood review and renewal of existing
NCDs every ten years to ensure conformity with current neighborhood
desires and community. priorities
1. Amendment 21 (2.78.180 K) - Periodic review and renewal
11. Current issue with the ordinance: The ordinance, drafted 40 years ago, uses outdated
language
a. Proposed solution:
i.
Replace gendered language with gender-neutral language
1. Amendment 7 (2.78.160 C) - Gender-neutral language
12. Other amendments: Our petition suggests a handful of other amendments making
small procedural adjustments to favor community members working with the CHC,
defining the scope and intent of NCDs, and/or correcting typos in the ordinance.

From: Charles Sullivan, Executive Director
Re:

Citizens Petition to Amend Ch. 2.78, Article III, Neighborhood Conservation Districts
and Landmarks

A citizens’ petition to amend Chapter 2.78, Article III of the City Code will be heard by the
Ordinance Committee on September 29. The City Manager and the City Solicitor have
authorized me to reach out to the Council with these comments.
While I respect the concerns expressed by the petitioners, the proposed amendments would
diminish citizen access to the neighborhood conservation process and limit the ability of
neighborhood conservation districts to “preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of
the city [and to] resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to this purpose” (2.78.140).
The amendments that I propose are intended to align NCD commissions with City Council goals
for affordable housing and climate resilience and make the conservation district study process
less burdensome on property owners by eliminating interim Historical Commission jurisdiction
in NCD study areas.
Background
The Neighborhood Conservation District and Landmarks ordinance was adopted in 1983 to
counter a wave of development that targeted historically significant buildings. By the mid-1970s
the permissive zoning code that went into effect in 1962 was finally attracting the first significant

Packet Pg. 94

construction in the city since 1929. Many as-of-right projects triggered significant controversy
and opposition, leading the City Council to adopt the Demolition Delay ordinance (Ch. 2.78, Art.
II) in 1978.
The catalysts for the adoption of the NCD ordinance were the threats posed by the proposed
Kennedy Presidential Library to a neighborhood west of Harvard Square and the proliferation of
townhouses in the Mid Cambridge neighborhood. These neighborhoods did not appear to be
suitable for designation as historic districts under the Historic Districts statute, MGL Ch. 40C, so
CHC staff and board members, working with City Councillor David Sullivan, devised a more
flexible instrument that allowed jurisdiction to be tailored to neighborhood conditions.
Cambridge’s neighborhood conservation model has since been adopted by several other cities
and towns in Massachusetts.
Conservation districts in Cambridge include Mid Cambridge (1983, about 2,200 buildings); Half
Crown-Marsh (1984, 200 buildings); Avon Hill (1998, 220 buildings); and Harvard Square
(2000, 230 buildings). A conservation district study for East Cambridge is now underway.
Proposed Amendments by Citizens’ Petition
The petitioners’ amendments fall into several broad categories:
1. NCD membership requirements and member qualifications (2.78.160)
NCD commissions consist of five members and three alternates allocated among homeowners,
residents, property owners, and a member of the Cambridge Historical Commission. The
proposed amendments would require appointment of two tenants and one business owner:
Current
Citizens Proposal
Members - 5

Alternates - 3

2 resident homeowners

1 homeowner

1 resident (tenant optional)

2 tenants

1 other property owner

1 other property owner

1 CHC member

1 business owner

3 property owners

No requirements

•

The Ordinance already allows for appointment of a tenant. The Mid Cambridge NCD
Order requires a tenant representative, but over many years it has proved almost
impossible to recruit a tenant for this slot.
• Two existing NCDs are residential districts with small numbers of tenants, and
businesses are few or non-existent.
The proposed amendments would strike the current requirement that members and alternates
represent the “the diverse viewpoints expressed in the creation of the district” and “have
demonstrable knowledge and concern for improvement, conservation, and enhancement of the
district.” Professional qualifications related to real estate or architecture or historic
preservation would also be eliminated (2.78.160.B).
• Elimination of professional qualifications would degrade the ability of NCD
commissions to deal with complex architectural and development issues. I
recommend retaining the required professional qualifications, at least in part (see
Staff Recommendation #2 below).
2. Limiting jurisdiction by preventing review of affordable housing, climate resiliency,
and renewable energy measures (2.78.170, 2.78.210)

Packet Pg. 95

The proposed amendments would eliminate the authority of neighborhood conservation district
commissions to review projects developed under the affordable housing overlay (2.78.170) or
alterations that include climate resiliency or renewable energy features.
• The Historical Commission and the various NCD commissions have a long history of
constructively balancing community goals with their stated purpose of restraining adverse
influences on the city’s built environment. Over the last forty years complete denials have
been extremely rare, and no commission has ever denied an affordable housing project.
Commissions typically view their role as mitigating adverse effects, not preventing
projects entirely. This amendment seeks to address a hypothetical problem that has no
basis in past experience.
• Projects that involve climate resiliency or renewable energy features can also be
destructive of architectural character. No commission to date has ever denied an
application for such features, but they occasionally request alterations to solar panel
installations to protect historic features. The Historic Districts statute, which is
incorporated by reference into Ch. 2.78, already prioritizes solar power:
When ruling on applications for certificates of appropriateness for solar energy
systems … the commission shall also consider the policy of the commonwealth to
encourage the use of solar energy systems and to protect solar access (MGL Ch.
40C, Sec. 7).
3. Limiting initiation of NCD studies (2.78.180)
The proposed amendments would require City Council approval before an NCD study could be
initiated.
• I assume that the objection here is to the temporary jurisdiction exercised by the
Cambridge Historical Commission in NCD study areas. Amendments proposed at the end
of this memo would eliminate this jurisdiction.
• Requiring the Historical Commission to identify all the opponents of a proposed district
would be an impossibility. The study process is designed to elicit and respond to a range
of views.
4. Establishing perpetual sunset reviews (2.78.180)
The proposed amendments would require re-adoption of each existing NCD after ten years,
beginning in 2022.
• The amendments overlook the provisions of paragraph 2.180.J, which provides for
inclusion of a sunset clause in the Order establishing each district. Requiring a
simultaneous decennial sunset review would be unnecessary and excessively
burdensome.
• The Avon Hill, Mid Cambridge, and Harvard Square NCDs all had sunset reviews after
establishment. The Harvard Square Order was readopted in 2021.
5. Limiting general authority (2.78.220)
The proposed amendments eliminate the ability of an NCD commission to “impose dimensional
and setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance.”
• Paragraph 2.78.220.A mirrors Section 7 of MGL Ch. 40C, the Historic Districts statute.
Although it has been rarely used in Cambridge, this provision is an important regulatory
tool. Elimination would seriously weaken the authority of NCD commissions.
6. Expanding time limit for appeal (2.78.240)
The proposed amendments would extend the time period for appeals from twenty to sixty days.
• Extending the time period for appeals to sixty days would unfairly burden applicants by
exposing them to legal jeopardy for an unreasonable length of time.
7. Preventing enforcement of decisions (2.78.270)

Packet Pg. 96

The proposed amendments eliminate the authority of NCD commissions to enforce their
decisions.
• Eliminating the ability of NCD commissions to enforce their decisions makes their
jurisdiction largely meaningless. In effect it makes all their decisions non-binding on the
applicant.
Proposed Amendments to Ch. 2.78.
The Neighborhood Conservation District and Landmarks Ordinance was the first of its kind in
Massachusetts. Almost forty years of experience suggests several amendments that would align
its objectives with current city policies, rationalize the NCD study process, and clarify certain
procedures.
1. Alignment with City Goals (2.78.220)
In recent years Cambridge has faced growing problems of gentrification, diminishing diversity,
and lack of affordable housing. It is critical that efforts to “preserve, conserve and protect the
beauty and heritage of the city [and to] resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to
this purpose” be aligned with city goals. Accordingly, I propose the addition of a new paragraph
B to Section 2.78.220 - Factors considered by Commissions:1
• B. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall also consider community goals as may from
time to time be expressed by the City Council, including the need to provide additional
housing, affordable and otherwise, and to promote the sustainable use of energy and
capacity for climate resilience.
2. Membership of NCD Commissions (2.78.160)
The current system of membership qualifications is weighted toward property ownership while
allowing for tenant representation when appropriate. When the ordinance was written it was
thought desirable to include an Historical Commission member on each NCD commission.
However, this condition has often proved impossible to meet. Accordingly, we suggest that
inclusion of an Historical Commission member on NCD commissions be limited to the initial
three years of the commission’s existence. I also suggest eliminating the requirement that one
member represent the real estate profession.
2.78.160 - Neighborhood conservation district commission—Established—Membership
requirements.
A.
Upon designation as provided in Section 2.78.180 of this article of any
neighborhood conservation district, and unless the designation provides that the
Historical Commission itself shall exercise authority with respect thereto, the
City Manager shall appoint a neighborhood conservation district commission to
consist of five members and three alternates. At the establishment of the district
the members shall include three residents of the neighborhood, not less than two
of whom shall be homeowners; one neighborhood property owner (who may or
may not be a neighborhood homeowner); and one member or alternate of the
Cambridge Historical Commission. Three years after establishment of the
district the requirement that one member be a member or alternate of the
Cambridge Historical Commission shall cease and a neighborhood resident shall
be appointed to that position. One member and/or one alternate of a
neighborhood conservation district commission, in addition to the mandated
member of the Cambridge Historical Commission, may be a Cambridge resident
who lives outside the district. One member and/or alternate may be a tenant
residing in the district. The remaining alternates shall be neighborhood property
owners. The neighborhood conservation district commission shall act solely in
1

Existing Paragraph B to be redesignated Paragraph C.

Packet Pg. 97

the exercise of those functions described in this article which are applicable to
the district under its administration.
B. Any member or alternate of the Historical Commission may be appointed to a
neighborhood conservation district commission for a term coterminous with
such person's term as a member or alternate of the Historical Commission.
Members and alternates of a neighborhood conservation district commission
who are not members of the Historical Commission shall by reason of
experience or education have demonstrable knowledge and concern for
improvement, conservation, and enhancement of the district, and at least one
member or alternate shall have professional qualifications related to architecture
or historic preservation. The members of the neighborhood conservation district
commission shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diverse
viewpoints expressed in the creation of the district. Such members shall serve
for a term of three years, except that the initial appointments shall be for one
member to serve one year and one member to serve two years, and vacancies
shall be filled for the unexpired term of office. Each member and alternate shall
continue in office after expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly
appointed and qualified, except that no member shall serve more than two
consecutive terms.
3. Enlarge NCD Study Committees (2.78.180)
I suggest that study committee membership be enlarged from seven to nine members. This would
allow representation of a broader range of views on the committee.
C. In the case of a landmark, the report shall be prepared by the Historical
Commission. In the case of a neighborhood conservation district, the report shall
be prepared by a study committee consisting of three members or alternates of
the Historical Commission and six persons appointed by the City Manager,
including at least four residents of the neighborhood, not less than three of
whom shall be homeowners, one neighborhood property owner (who may or
may not be a neighborhood homeowner), and, if possible, one person who owns
property or resides elsewhere in the City and has demonstrated knowledge and
concern for conservation and enhancement of those exterior features of the City
which are important to its distinctive character.
4. Separate Designation Procedures and Review Authority for Landmarks and NCDs
Section 2.78.180 establishes identical designation procedures for landmarks and neighborhood
conservation districts: upon initiation of a landmark or NCD designation study, the Historical
Commission protects the properties for up to one year while a recommendation is prepared for
City Council action. I propose separating designation procedures and eliminating interim CHC
jurisdiction over NCD study areas. Doing so would align the NCD ordinance with the provisions
of MGL Ch. 40C, the Historic Districts statute, which contains no such provision for interim
jurisdiction.
Landmarks and neighborhood conservation districts are fundamentally different. Potential
landmarks are individual buildings that may face imminent threats to their existence; it is
essential that the Historical Commission be able to exercise temporary jurisdiction to prevent
their destruction. The pressures facing neighborhoods are diffuse; while individual buildings may
be threatened, a neighborhood in its entirety offers more resilience in the face of change.
In the case of a landmark the report is prepared by the staff, but a neighborhood conservation
district study requires the appointment of a study committee. Recruitment of members and
organization of a committee can easily consume a third of the time allotted for the study. The
study itself requires that the committee reach consensus on a series of difficult topics while
Packet Pg. 98

educating the public about the need for conservation and the policy choices involved in preparing
a recommendation to the City Council.
Removing the Historical Commission’s interim jurisdiction over building permits in proposed
neighborhood conservation districts would allow the study committee time to study the issues
and educate the public. I propose following amendments to paragraph 2.78.180.I:
I. Following acceptance of a designation petition by the Historical Commission,
no application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the
premises of a property being considered for landmark designation shall be
granted until reviewed by the Commission as though the property were
designated as a landmark under this Article III. Beginning with the acceptance
of a designation petition or a vote to initiate a landmark designation study and
until (a) the Historical Commission makes a negative recommendation on a
proposed designation, (b) the City Council determines not to enact the proposed
designation, or (c) one year has elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission shall
review all proposed construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the
exterior architectural features, other than color, of the structures on the premises
of a proposed landmark.
The proposed amendments would accomplish a new alignment of Historical Commission and
NCD commission goals with the city’s overall goals and eliminate the time pressure and conflict
that accompanies NCD studies. I hope that the Ordinance Committee will encourage further
discussion among the parties and support making the revisions to the Ordinance that I have
proposed.
