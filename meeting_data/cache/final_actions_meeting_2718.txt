Whereas: Cambridge has witnessed two
the deaths of Cambridge residents killed
by large trucks in Harvard Square in the
past year; and Whereas: A Truck Safety
Ordinance would provide requirements
for safety improvements made to trucks
owned by companies which have
contracts with the City; and Whereas:
The City of Boston currently already has
a Truck Safety Ordinance and a similar
ordinance in Cambridge is something
that has been talked about for multiple
years in Cambridge; now therefore be it
Ordered: That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to work with the
Transportation Department and Solicitor
to provide the City with an update on
the progress toward a draft Ordinance as
soon as possible and with the draft of an
Ordinance by October 19, 2020. by
