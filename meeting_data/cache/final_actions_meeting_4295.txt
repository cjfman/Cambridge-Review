We truly understand how important after school care is for families and are fully committed to expanding
access in Cambridge
Today we want to share the broader context we’re operating in, update on progress this year and discuss
the path forward for Fall 2023
Access to, and staffing of, after school programs is a challenge nationally
While not as high as we’d like it to be, Cambridge has a higher portion of students in afterschool
programs than the state and national average
The City of Cambridge offers 20 of the 27 elementary after-school programs in the City
An equity-driven change to financial aid and how seats are assigned exposed true demand and created
waitlisted families for the first time, many of whom historically were able to get access
We worked with school leadership this past year on an expansion plan to grow Community School
capacity by over 100 seats
However due to historically challenging staffing, our effective capacity has not grown despite hiring 52
people since Spring 2022
To deliver on our targeted ~170 seat expansion for Fall 2023, we plan to grow programs with the most
stable staffing model, add full time teachers to grow select Community School programs, and engage the
help of a recruiting firm (also extending support from temp agencies) with an additional cost of ~$1.5M
We are speaking with the 6 community providers about supporting them to absorb seats from Margaret
Fuller program closure and ideally grow beyond that
Knowing we will not meet all families demand this fall, we are continuing to shift our notification timeline
earlier and plan to list community program options along with our own on our website

Prior to pandemic, a survey of Massachusetts parents found that for every child in
afterschool, 3 more would participate if program available

Even pre-pandemic, there was insufficient after school capacity for
Massachusetts families

▪ Overall tight labor market led to increased competition for workers

▪ Concerns with health post pandemic led some to find roles with lower exposure risk

▪ Cambridge unemployment rate of 2% lower than long term average 3.5%

5

The pandemic-fueled reduction in childcare workers across the state has
worsened this mismatch

This is not just a Massachusetts problem as providers nationally cite
staffing shortages as a major challenge

▪ Fewer men in workforce

https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/the-case-of-the-missing-workers/

7

▪ Those out of workforce to care for child or other
relative

▪ Workers used COVID shut-down as opportunity to
shift into office roles (1M more office workers than
pre-pandemic)

▪ Covid led people to retire early

▪ Fewer people immigrating into the US (50% drop of
new arrivals between 2019 and 2021)

National trends – 3.5M fewer workers than prepandemic :

Hypotheses for underlying drivers of national staffing shortages include
less immigration and workers shifting to professional roles

Met with all 7 community-based programs that provide 5 day a week afterschool
programs
Margaret Fuller House is closing their afterschool program at the end of June (30
seats JK-5)
Talked to remaining 6 about how City could support them in absorbing Margaret Fuller
house seats and ideally grow beyond that
Programs shared common themes including challenges hiring staff and significant
staff turnover
All of the programs are interested in continuing to work with the City to see how city
resources could support some expansion.
Continue our capacity work with the Agenda for Children, School Department,
community-based programs and families on potential strategies for growth and needs.

We are speaking with the 6 community providers about supporting them
absorb seats from Margaret Fuller closure and ideally grow beyond that
