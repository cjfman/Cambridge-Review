WHEREAS:

The use of gas-powered lawn equipment contributes to negative public health
outcomes as well as emissions pollution; and

WHEREAS:

The current ordinance language on leaf blowers from 1998 established that the
reduction of noise and emissions of particulate matter resulting from the use of leaf
blowers is a public purpose that protects the public health, welfare and environment of
the City of Cambridge and its citizens; and

WHEREAS:

With the technological advancements that have been made in green lawn equipment
since 1998, the use of electric lawn equipment could be an effective way for the City to
carry out its numerous landscaping and outdoor maintenance needs; and

WHEREAS:

The use of gas powered lawn equipment causes numerous physical injuries including
(but not limited to) back pain, muscle aches, headaches, and hearing loss, emits
volatile organic compounds which join with nitrogen oxide in warm seasons to form
“smog”, a well-known contributor to heart and lung disease, stroke, and premature
death and the workers who handle this gas-powered equipment also inhale fine
particulate matter exhaust which can lodge deep in the lung and enter the bloodstream,
causing conditions ranging from heart and lung problems, to stroke, cancer, and death,
and other exhaust compounds like carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons further exacerbate the hazards for landscape workers and bystanders
alike; and

WHEREAS:

Lexington, Arlington, Marblehead, and other Massachusetts municipalities have
limited their use of gas-powered lawn equipment and have developed plans to prohibit
their use in the future; and

WHEREAS:

California has implemented a statewide ban on the sale of gas-powered leaf blowers
beginning in 2024 and the municipality of Pasadena, California passed legislation that
officially banned gas-powered leaf blowers starting on April 28th, 2023; and

WHEREAS:

MassSave has an incentive program for Massachusetts residents to purchase electric
lawn equipment through their residential battery powered lawn equipment rebates up to
$75 for a lawnmower and $30 for other lawn equipment; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has requested the city on numerous occasions to develop working
groups and to investigate the use of non-gas-powered lawn equipment; and

Packet Pg. 2

WHEREAS:

In June of 2022, the Health and Environment committee held a hearing to discuss with
local business owners and workers the possibility of banning gas-powered leaf
blowers, and since then, healthier alternatives have continued to become increasingly
available, while the ongoing injustice to landscaping workers remains acute; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge can and should take action to protect the lives and health of landscape
workers, neighbors, and children, while also taking into account the needs and
financial concerns of residents and business owners in the city; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct relevant departments to
work together to develop a policy that would lead to a ban on the use of gas-powered
lawn equipment in Cambridge in line with the municipalities outline above, developing
incentive programs to layer on existing MassSave benefits, and direct CDD to work
with the Health and Environment Committee Chair to develop possible ordinance
language limiting the use of gas powered lawn equipment by residents, businesses, and
city operations; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the Health and Environment Committee of the City Council is requested to hold a
hearing on the above topic as soon as possible.

ENFORCEMENT
COMMONWEALTH CONNECT:
In 2016 The City established a Leaf Blower complaint category within Commonwealth Connect
This category continues to be an important tool in monitoring and enforcing compliance.
LICENSE COMMISSION’S GENERAL PROACTIVE APPROACH:
1.
2.
3.

4.

5.
6.
7.

Investigators patrol the City for improper use of leaf blowers. Information received from emails, phone calls,
SeeClickFix reports, and CAD reports are all utilized to investigate compliance.
Non-permitted commercial leaf blowers which are operating in Cambridge are sent
“warning” cease and desist letters with a link to the application and copy of the
Ordinance. This has been very effective in educating companies and getting them permitted.
Any violation at a property where there is no information as to who is performing the work, a “warning”
cease and desist letter is sent. The letter includes the Ordinance and information for the resident to provide
the commercial operator, if any. When necessary, residents are brought in for a meeting with the Chief
Licensing Investigator and the Chair for the License Commission. The Ordinance and its limitations are
explained to the resident.
Permitted and non-permitted commercial leaf blowers who violate the Ordinance have been brought before
the Board of License Commissioners and fines of $300.00 per violation have been issued. This has been
effective in having the companies take accountability for their employees and spend time educating their
employees.
Property owners are sent copies of any violations and fines issued, and if offenses become continuous or
repetitive, the property owners are also cited to appear before the Board. This has been effective in making
sure that companies take more pro-active steps to become compliant.
Emails during prohibited periods are sent to all companies reminding them of the limitations; in addition, when trends
in terms of violations are observed, emails are sent to all companies.
When permits are issued annually, the rules and regulations in multiple languages are also issued and distributed.

Challenges to an all-electric leaf blower
program
u

May not allow city, contractors, colleges and companies to clean debris efficiently and effectively
without some exemptions in place.

u

Could increase cost associated with leaf cleanup and insufficient seasonal manpower available.

u

Increased leaf debris may cause build up of organic matter on fields, pathways, and fence lines,
affecting drainage and potential playability.

u

May need a more significant exemptions to larger open spaces (Golf Course, Cemetery,..etc.) and
the new non-tow Street Sweeping program.

u

Increase in leaf debris draining to receiving waters leads to higher phosphorus loading.

u

Aesthetic qualities of parks, fields, planting beds, walking paths, sidewalks, plazas and businesses
throughout the city may decrease.

u

Enforcement will become more difficult; there are only 2 employees, who have other cores
responsibilities and duties, tasked with patrolling, and do not have the capabilities of issuing “on
the spot” tickets. It will also have a significant impact on the Board of License Commissioners’
operations and meetings.

Specific
Impacts for the Golf
Course
u

Impossible to maintain tee boxes,
bunkers, and greens.

u

Impossible to hand rake 54-acre course.

u

Labor market shortage for seasonal workers
adds to challenge.

u

Longer time frame to clear course meaning
1) shorter playing times
or 2) maintaining while playing. (unsafe).

u

Like playing fields – issues with dead turf.

u

Greens need leaf blowers.

Specific concerns
with the Street
Sweeping program
Impact on stormwater
u

Excessive leaves lead to blocked catch
basins.

u

Phosphorus – Pollutant of Concern on
Alewife/Mystic/ Charles River.

u

Leaf “debris” in separated drainage
systems increases phosphorus loading.

u

Important that leaf “debris” is managed
to reduce algae blooms.

State of the
industry
(Leaf Blowers)

u

Like the bans that Cambridge has had
in place since 2008, Leaf Blower bans
of various types have been enacted in
City’s and Towns across the United
States over the last several years.

u

Similar to what we are seeing in the
Electric Vehicle industry pressure at
the Federal and State level has led to a
boom in the number of manufacturers
bringing electric vehicles to market.

u

With the number of bans against leaf
blowers rising nationwide we are
seeing manufactures of this equipment
more aggressively pursuing batteryoperated alternatives to their gas
counterparts.

BATTERY OPERATED EQUIPMENT
For the past 6 years Public Works has been
utilizing battery-operated lawn equipment as
part of our park maintenance operations.
With the completion of Toomey park a
commitment was made to go all electric and a
storage facility was created to both house and
charge electric equipment.
Equipment utilized are: a 60” ride-on mower, a
33” walk behind mower, handheld leaf blowers,
and handheld string trimmers.

Packet Pg. 18

Effectiveness of the batteryoperated lawn mowers
Mean Green Rival 60” ride on
Mean Green WBX-33HD walk behind
Pros:
Noise, its quieter than a gas power
mower

Pros:
Noise, its quieter than a gas-powered mower
Its overall size is more compact than our gas mowers
making it a little easier to maneuver around obstacles

Eliminate emissions

Eliminate emissions

Cons:
Price $13,000

Cons:
Price, $34,000

Safety on slopes, the placement of the
battery / center of gravity causes this
machine to unsteady on inclines

Performance is affected, “takes longer” if the grass is
wet, thick, or the grass hasn’t been mowed regularly

Batteries, unlike smaller pieces of
equipment batteries are not readily
accessible and are not meant to be
swapped out with any frequency

Charge time is up to 12hrs
Can’t tolerate excessive moisture or the unit won’t
move until its dry.
Run time is very dependent on conditions. Under ideal
conditions like a straight open areas, no hills, regularly
maintained grass, no dew / moisture on the grass
blades etc.., run time can be comparable to a gas
counterpart.

State of the industry
(Lawn Equipment)
•

While homeowner scale products are becoming more
mainstream, commercial scale lawn equipment has been
slower to catch up. Unlike leaf blowers where both
residential and commercial versions are being produced
by many manufactures, most of the other commercial
equipment has not made the switch.

•

Some of the specialized equipment used to maintain the
golf course and areas of the water department are not
available at all.

•

While contractors are beginning to switch over some of
their smaller equipment ( particularly leaf blowers),very
few if any on the commercial side have gone electric in
other categories.

•

•

Given the size of some of this equipment, state level
bans like California's would help to move the industry
forward.
Charging infrastructure needs to be considered as
transition to large equipment happens.

California amend Small Off-road Engine
Regulations (SORE)
In December 2021, the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) approved a regulatory revision requiring most
small off-road engines (SORE) sold in California on or
after January 1, 2024, to be zero-emission. CARB
classifies small offroad engines as spark-ignition
engines which are 25 horsepower or less. These
engines are typically associated with lawn and garden
equipment, portable generators and pressure
washers.
u

The SORE regulations do not prohibit possession,
use, or repair of existing CARB compliant Sore
equipment.

u

Stores may continue to sell CARB compliant
equipment that was produced prior to 2022

Conclusions

u

LEAF BLOWERS

u

The City could consider a Leaf Blower ban similar to our
neighboring towns provided there are exemptions in place
for larger properties, specific operations, or emergency
situations.

u

Would need to consider a long enough lead time to allow
Municipal, Commercial and Residential operations to
adjust to the change.

u

Financial assistance should be considered where possible.

u

LAWN EQUIPMENT

u

At this time, we do not recommend a ban on additional
Lawn equipment.
u

The industry has not yet caught up with their gas
counterparts.

u

Statewide regulations would help make a switchover
more competitive on the commercial/contractor
side.

u

Charging infrastructure needs more consideration as
this and other equipment become more standard.
