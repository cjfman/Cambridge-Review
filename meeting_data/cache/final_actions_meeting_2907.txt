EXISTING STREETSCAPE

SIMMONS HALL

Harmoniously ordered windows reference the
meticulous grid of Simmons Hall, but impart a
human scale; angled surfaces dynamically
interact with the daylight and changing weather.
Breaks in the façade reveal activity within.

WEST BUILDING ENTRY COURT

MIT WEST CAMPUS GRADUATE DORMITORY PROJECT

Communication: 269-301 Vassar St_20210622 (Public Hearings)

The west courtyard is a nexus of street life, the
building entrance, verdant landscape, and
materiality. Curvilinear double-height interior
volumes contrast the rigorously proportioned
and patterned brick and metal facades.

The east courtyard expands the public realm
and welcomes visitors into this new
community; connecting to the Central Plaza
via the covered public loggia.

The interplay of lush landscape and
textured masonry construction enriches the
streetscape experience and nods to the MIT
West Campus legacy of Aalto and Saarinen.
