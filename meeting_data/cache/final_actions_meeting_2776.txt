Considerations
•
•
•
•

Can’t regulate based on property ownership (i.e., Trust, REIT)
Can regulate based on length of vacancy
Possible to regulate based on amount of retail frontage overall
Registration fees can only be used to cover the administrative costs
associated with the program
• Fines could be burdensome for property owners who have financial
hardship
