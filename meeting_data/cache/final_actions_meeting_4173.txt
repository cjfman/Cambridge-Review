FIRST IN COUNCIL
February 6, 2022

COUNCILLOR AZEEM
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

Some residents in Cambridge drive and benefit from off-street parking spaces; not
every resident, however, drives a car, and so the City should not require, but still allow,
homes to have off-street parking spaces; and

WHEREAS:

Parking minimums can force homeowners and residential & commerical developers to
accommodate space for more parking than they deem necessary, leading to higher
project costs and a decrease in the number of units or amount of open space; and

ORDERED:

That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge be amended by substitution as
follows:
6.30 - PARKING QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS
6.31 Required Amount of Parking. Off street parking facilities shall be provided for
each use of a lot or structure in the amount specified in the schedule of parking
requirements contained in Subsection 6.36. Said schedule specifies the amount of
accessory off street parking required for each type of land use listed in "Table of Use
Regulations" in this Ordinance. The amount of required parking is also based on the
intensity of development permitted in the district in which the use is located.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the zoning, the minimum accessory parking
required for all uses shall be zero (0) parking spaces.

Subject:

Accessory Parking Requirements Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board does NOT RECOMMEND adoption.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On August 16, 2022, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss a Zoning
Petition by the City Council to amend section 6.36, entitled “Schedule of Parking and Loading
Requirements,” of Article 6.000, entitled “Off Street Parking and Loading Requirements and
Nighttime Curfew on Large Commercial Through Trucks,” of the Zoning Ordinance of the City
of Cambridge by inserting text that reads “Minimum accessory parking required for all uses shall
be 0 parking spaces” and by inserting the numeral “0” in place of all current accessory parking
requirements for all uses in all zoning districts. The Board heard a presentation from Councillor
Zondervan and comments from Councillor McGovern, and received written materials from staff
in the City’s Community Development Department (CDD).
Following the presentation, public comment, and discussion among Board members, the
Planning Board voted to transmit an unfavorable recommendation on this Petition to the City
Council. Board members had a wide range of views on the concept, but expressed a shared
concern that more information and study is necessary to more fully understand the potential
effects of this zoning change.
The following is a list of comments made by Board members during the discussion:
•

Several Board members acknowledged that attitudes around parking largely depend on
people’s individual travel habits and preferences. Some noted that the City does not
require other types of amenities, and questioned whether it is in the public interest to
require parking and whether it is fair given that 30-40% of residents do not own a car.

•

Many Board members were unconvinced that not requiring parking would have a
meaningful impact on overall housing costs, because demand for housing in Cambridge
tends to be high regardless of parking availability. However, it was noted that there could
be other benefits to not requiring parking, such as allowing space for more housing units
and green space.

•

A primary concern was the potential impact in neighborhoods that already have little offstreet parking and very high demand for on-street parking, particularly in the eastern half
of the city. In those areas, additional development with less off-street parking could result

in increased competition for on-street parking, affecting existing residents who rely on
that parking. A specific concern was additional stress on longtime residents who are
feeling displaced by economic pressures.
•

Board members suggested that the City could consider more nuanced approaches. For
example, changes could be focused on areas that are closer to transit, or areas where there
is less demand for on-street parking. Another suggestion was to remove requirements in
smaller cases – such as when small numbers of housing units are created – but require
more scrutiny of larger developments, where there might be greater impact because there
is more likely to be a greater total parking demand.

•

There was interest in hearing more about other cities that have made similar changes and
what the results have been. However, there was some concern about comparing these
examples to Cambridge, because Cambridge has particularly dense, historic patterns of
development with relatively little off-street parking to begin with. Many of the
communities that have stopped requiring parking are less densely developed and have
more off-street parking as an existing condition.

•

There was also interest in seeing the results of the parking study being undertaken to
review the City’s parking regulations more holistically and make recommendations after
hearing community input. This study may not answer every question, but it will be
helpful when moving forward to have as much information as possible.

•

Several Board members noted that the zoning text needs clarification, including a
thorough review of other sections of the Zoning Ordinance that may be affected. For
example, the intent expressed by Councillors that the change would not affect parking
maximums should be resolved and made clear in the text. Potential ambiguity with other
sections of zoning, such as the requirements for reduced parking under the Affordable
Housing Overlay and special permit provisions related to parking, should also be
addressed. The text should also clearly state how existing required accessory parking will
be treated and whether owners can eliminate those spaces in favor of other land uses,
such as new buildable area or open space.

The Planning Board voted with 7 members in favor transmitting the above recommendation. One
member was absent.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

WHEREAS:

Some residents in Cambridge drive and benefit from off-street parking spaces. Not
every resident, however, drives a car, and so the City should not require, but still allow,
homes to have off-street parking spaces; and

WHEREAS:

Parking minimums can force homeowners and residential & commercial developers to
accommodate space for more parking than they deem necessary, leading to higher
project costs and a decrease in the number of units or amount of open space; and

WHEREAS:

The city should review its maximum parking requirement periodically to ensure they
meet our transportation and environmental goals; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct staff from the Community
Development and Law Departments to examine the Zoning Ordinance and provide
amendment language for consideration by the City Council to remove all other
references to parking minimums, including in Articles 13.000, 14.000, 15.000, 16.000,
17.000, and 20.000; and further be it

Parking Minimums Add Unnecessary Costs
“Parking requirements that are too high suggest that cities are forcing developers to build parking that
people don’t want, at the cost of housing units that people do want.”
-C.J. Gabbe, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Studies and Sciences at Santa Clara University

“Seattle developers built 40% less parking than would have been required before their parking reforms in
2012, resulting in 18,000 fewer parking spaces and saving an estimated $537 million.”
-Gregory Pierce, associate director of the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation and a faculty in Urban Planning at
UCLA.
Off-Street Parking costs between $50,000 to $100,000 per spot. This equates to roughly $200 - $400 additional
in rent ($2400 to $4800 annually).

Removing Minimums Won’t Stop Parking
Can developers still build the same amount of parking? Yes, this allows
but does not require less parking.
Will developers stop building parking? No, parking is still valued by many
homeowners and tenants. Furthermore, financing requirements often demand it for
new developments and commercial tenants often require it to provide parking for
employees who commute by car and don’t live in the city.

Many cities have removed parking minimums

Parking minimums were mainly introduced starting in the mid 20th century. In the 21st century,
cities have started repealing them.
Buffalo, NY and Hartford, CT led the way
○ “Buffalo Becomes First Major U.S. City to Eliminate Parking Minimums”
○ “Hartford Eliminates Parking Minimums Citywide”
Since then many cities have followed
○ “In light of negative externalities, cities such as San Francisco and Minneapolis have
followed the lead of Buffalo and Hartford in eliminating parking minimums entirely. Other
cities have deregulated parking in key development districts: Chicago, New Orleans,
Pittsburgh, Lexington (KY), Spokane, and Santa Monica”
- Daniel Hess, Professor in Urban Planning at the University of Buffalo
California Poised To Eliminate Parking Requirements Near Transit Statewide
○ A state bill awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature would prohibit parking mandates in

○

neighborhoods within half a mile of transit.
Oregon has a similar measure in place: 61 cities in the state's 8 metro regions must eliminate
parking mandates near high frequency transit service by 1/1/2023.

Analysis from Buffalo

High Level Trends, Parking Minimums Produce

● More traffic congestion; higher levels of air pollution/particulates
● Sprawling land use patterns
● Costs passed along to consumers (including non-drivers) in the form of higher
rents, higher prices of goods and lower salaries

Analysis from Buffalo: More Shared Parking
● Rather than build parking, developers shared parking
○ Four mixed-use projects tracked by the researchers built no parking spaces
■ These projects relied on shared parking networks instead of building
new parking which enabled them to provide parking access without
dedicating excess space
○ One mixed-use project tracked by the researchers built notably more
spaces (17) than it would have needed to build under the old rules
■ Intentional → project had entered into a shared parking arrangement
with adjacent mixed-use project
■ Result was 71 fewer total spaces between the two sites than
previously required

Analysis from Buffalo: More Viable Housing
● Transit-oriented development got a boost
○ Two mixed-use projects along the Main Street transit corridor in Buffalo, NY
created hundreds of units of student housing.
○ Researchers suggest that the added cost of the old parking requirements had
served as a deterrent to new development in transit-friendly areas.
● Adaptive reuse projects also became more viable
○ One small-scale mixed-use development near a light rail station rehabilitated an
old structure into 10 new apartments with ground floor retail space.
■ Project not feasible under the old parking requirements
● Called for 10 spaces on the site despite its close proximity to transit.
