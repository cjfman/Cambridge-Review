Scenario B:

In-person learning for limited ❏
number of eligible students

Remote learning is the default option for all
students

Current status

❏
CPS prioritized
in-person learning for
those students who are at
lower risk of transmitting
COVID-19 and our
youngest learners, who
struggle the most with
independent at-home
learning.

Families of eligible students could opt-in to
in-person learning:
❏

Students with disabilities in substantially separate
programs (preschool-12)

❏

English learners in Sheltered English Immersion
programs (JK-12)

❏

All students in preschool through grade 1 (all students)

❏

Students in grades 2nd and 3rd grades (limited capacity,
with priority given to students with disabilities, current
and former English language learners, and homeless
students)

2.1.a

Health & Safety First: Our top priority
is the physical health, safety, mental
health, and social-emotional well-being of
students, staff, families, and community.
Racial Equity: Accelerate CPS efforts to
become an actively anti-racist district and
disrupt the negative impact of the
pandemic and structural racism on
students, families, and staff, especially
those of color.
Relationships are the foundation:
Prioritize relationships between students,
families, and staff to ensure all students
feel acknowledged, respected, valued, and
supported.
Clarity & Consistency: Communicate
clear expectations and support more
consistent student and family experiences
across classrooms and schools. Deliver
consistent, coordinated, transparent, and
culturally-responsive communication.

Attachment: 2020.11.10_CC-SC Roundtable Presentation (COF 2020 #66 : Presentation

CPS Guiding Principles: Re-opening Plan 2020-21
Student-Centered Instruction:
Instruction should be student-centered,
provide voice and choice, and focus on
developing strong independent learners
who are change-agents through
culturally responsive, trauma-informed,
and healing-centered practices.
Family Partnership: Partner with
families, especially those with greatest
need and traditionally marginalized,
to support students’ academic and
social-emotional well-being.

Staff Support: Provide support and
time, and for staff to plan and collaborate
for effective relationships, instruction,
services, and student support.
Reflective & Nimble Approach:
Build in regular opportunities for
reflection to gather feedback from
students, families, and staff and
improve the approach.
