GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Unclear divisions of responsibilities. Overlapping mandates. Insufficient executive authority to make
key decisions. Outdated departmental structures. Bewildering sets of committees, some long-dormant,
others falling afoul of state law. Many of the issues impeding the efficiency, effectiveness,
transparency, and accountability of municipalities can be traced to outdated organizational structures
based on old (or non-existence) charters and convoluted bylaws.
The Collins Center’s Governance and Organizational Structure practice works to help cities and towns
fix their foundational structures, providing wide-ranging and long-lasting benefits across municipal
departments and services.
Services Include
•
•
•
•

Charter Commission assistance: Staff can work with charter commissions to fulfil their statutory
role in drafting a charter for the municipality.
Government Study Committee assistance: Staff can assist government study committees with
their work, regardless of whether their mandate is broad or narrow.
Charter/bylaw/policy review: Staff can review a municipality’s statutory documents and
practices and can recommend improvements and best practices.
Bylaw/Ordinance recodification: Staff can work with a committee to review and recodify bylaws
or ordinances to make them more consistent and easier to follow.

Background and History of Charters in MA – 1 of 3
• In 1821, MA constitution was amended to allow towns
over 12,000 population to adopt a city form
• In 1915, the legislature codified law relating to the
establishment of city governments by offering “plans of
city government” (Ch. 43 of MGL)
• Chapter 43 had 3 aims:
– Provide a citizen petition process to adopt a city form
– Define the state’s aims for city government
– Provide several model plans for city government

• The statute initially provided 4 plans (A, B, C, and D), but
eventually added 2 more (E and F)
• These are still in use (in modified form) in 12 cities

Attachment: City Council Presentation.DRAFT.09.23.20 (002) (12658 : A communication

2.a

• No city adopted Plans C, D, or F (the Lawrence
commission government was established by special act)
• The text of each Plan is modest, as it was anticipated that
cities would adopt ordinances to fill in the details
• Plans did not enjoy significant popularity – most cities
continued to petition for a special act
• Probably no city is operating today under a Plan as
exactly defined in Chapter 43
• A few cities have adopted special acts changing form of
government after operating under a Plan

following the adoption of the Home Rule Amendment

Background and History of Cambridge Charter

2.a

• In 1938, 50 professors, industrialists,
merchants, legionnaires, white collar
workers, and laborers organized a
campaign to adopt a Plan E form of
government to replace the
mayor/council form
• After contentious legal and political
wrangling, the question to adopt Plan E
was placed on the ballot, but it failed
• In 1940, the question to adopt Plan E
was again placed on the ballot, and it
was adopted

The Purposes of Charter Review - Overview

2.a

“A charter is the foundation of a local government and
functions as the municipal equivalent of a state or federal
constitution, setting forth guiding principles for governance.
Composed by citizens, a charter specifies the most fundamental
relationships between a government and its community. It
establishes the framework for how a local government operates
in terms of its structure, responsibilities, functions, and
processes. The way public officials are elected, the form of
government, and the role citizens play in local government are
just a few examples of the important choices articulated in a
charter.”
-Guide for Charter Commissions, National Civic League, p. 5

Packet Pg. 13

Five types of reasons for charter review:
1. Ensure that the government is keeping up with a
modern understanding of best practices
2. Ensure that the government is responsive to the needs
and preferences of the current population
3. Ensure that the charter is kept consistent with changes
in state or federal law
4. Ensure that the charter is kept consistent with changes
in values or cultural changes
5. Clarify any text that has caused confusion or dispute
over interpretation

The Purposes of Charter Review - Overview

2.a

The Purposes of Charter Review - Changes in best practices
Modern MA charters now frequently or always include:
• An automatic review process at a predetermined interval
(usually 10 years)
• A mechanism to reorganize departments without
amending the charter or a home rule petition
• A capital improvement plan process
• References to electronic/online access to information

The Purposes of Charter Review - Changes in population, etc.
Ensure that the government is responsive to the needs and
preferences of the current population, demographics, and
business base:
• Does the size and composition of the council allow it to
be responsive to and representative of the current
population?
• For cities with mayors, does the term for mayor allow for
planning and implementation of initiatives?

The Purposes of Charter Review – Changes in values

Ensure that the charter is keeping up with changes in values
or cultural changes:
• Many modern charters no longer include pronouns
entirely (or at least add “or she” to “he”, etc.)
• Many municipalities are changing the names of boards
and committees to remove gendered reference (e.g.,
Aldermen to Council, Board of Selectmen to Selectboard)

Packet Pg. 18

The Purposes of Charter Review – Clarify confusing text
Clarify any text that has caused confusion or dispute over
interpretation:
• Are the recall and referendum provisions clear and
complete?
• Have all the key terms been defined?
