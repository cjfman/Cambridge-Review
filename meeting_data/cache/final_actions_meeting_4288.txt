WHEREAS:

It has long been taught as established history that the City of Newtowne, which would
be renamed to the City of Cambridge in 1638, was colonized by the English in 1630, a
process which in fact continues to this day; and

WHEREAS:

While this is historically accurate, for centuries the story of those who already lived in
and occupied this land (which was originally known as Anmoughcawgen prior to the
English colonialism) has been all but whitewashed out of existence, subject to erasure,
and the story of how this land was stolen from them has been conveniently swept
aside, transforming their very existence into a mere historical footnote as the
forerunner of when the “real” story of this region began; and

WHEREAS:

Such historical whitewashing is disrespectful of those who originally called this land
home, and a great distortion of the historical record of the lives, legacies, and
achievements of the very real people who originally lived on this land; and

WHEREAS:

Indeed, it is critical that, as we consider this matter from the vantage point of 2022, we
acknowledge that this touches upon not just the theft of land, but the erasure of actual
people; and

WHEREAS:

In recent years, there has been growing momentum for municipalities like Cambridge
to formally acknowledge the fact that our cities have been built upon stolen land, and
while there is much to admire about the community that Cambridge has evolved into
over the centuries, our story is incomplete without acknowledging those that our
predecessors wrongfully displaced, and while we cannot undo the sins of the past, we
can and must incorporate the stories of those who preceded the English colonialists
into our larger historical narrative, and we must strive to do right by the descendants of
those Indigenous Peoples; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council formally go on record in acknowledging that the City of
Cambridge occupies land that remains/is still home of the Massachusett Tribe, a
vibrant and thriving community of people who are currently displaced from their
position as sovereign owners of this land; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record acknowledging that while the modern day City of
Cambridge cannot go back and undo the sins committed by our predecessors almost
four centuries ago, we can and must incorporate a more nuanced, more truthful telling
of our historical narrative to ensure that the stories of the Indigenous Peoples who
originally occupied this land are not lost to history; and be it further

Packet Pg. 2

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to review the current cultural
sensitivity training for all City employees and ensure that it explicitly includes and
highlights the experiences of Indigenous Peoples in all cultural sensitivity trainings
going forward; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to convene an advisory group to
determine ways in which the City can work to lift up the voices and experiences of the
descendants of the Indigenous People who currently reside in our community, and in
which the City can engage in purposeful relationships/relationship building with the
Indigenous People of this area; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
this matter in a timely manner.
