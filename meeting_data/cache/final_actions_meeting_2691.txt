Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager

The following information is provided in response to Awaiting Report 20-46, dated
September 21, 2020, regarding implementation of traffic calming measures on Concord
Avenue between Huron Avenue and Garden Street. Staff from the Community
Development Department (CDD) and the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department
(TP&T) have reviewed existing conditions on Concord Avenue and have visited the corridor
to better understand the neighborhood context and traffic safety issues. Below is an
outline of how City staff plan to address the safety concerns on Concord Avenue.
Existing Conditions
In October, City staff collected traffic volume and speed data for vehicles travelling on
Concord Avenue west of Bond Street over a 48-hour period. The volume data indicate that
Concord Avenue is currently carrying approximately 8,000 vehicles per day in this segment.
The speed data indicate that the 85th percentile speed (the speed that 85 percent of drivers
are traveling at or below) for vehicles was 31 MPH, while the 95th percentile speed was 33
MPH. The detailed speed data are attached at the end of this report. Given the citywide 25
MPH speed limit, this indicates that there is a need for improved speed control in this
section of Concord Avenue.
It is also important to understand the physical and operational characteristics of Concord
Avenue, which influence how drivers on the road behave and the options available for
addressing speed issues:
•
•

•

As noted, Concord Avenue is subject to the citywide 25 MPH speed limit.
This segment of Concord Avenue is served by multiple MBTA bus routes (72, 74, 75,
and 78), which together provide relatively frequent service between Harvard Square
and Huron Avenue. As a result, installation of any raised traffic calming devices is not
likely to be feasible without significant impacts on bus service.
Concord Avenue in this section is relatively straight, with only a very gentle curve
near St. Peter School to break up the linear nature of the street. When combined
with buildings that are generally set back from the street, this can easily lead to
increased speeds, particularly in the downhill section heading towards Harvard
Square.

Packet Pg. 41

Attachment: Concord Ave Traffic Calming 102620 (CMA 2020 #249 : Awaiting Report 20-46 RE: Concord Ave traffic calming)

Community Development Department

1.3.a

•

Although Concord Avenue is not a wide street, this segment can feel somewhat
wider and more open than the outer segment west of Huron Avenue, particularly
since the on-street parking on the south side of the street is not always heavily used.

In addition, since Concord Avenue is not currently programmed in the City’s Five-Year
Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan, at this point it is only possible to consider standalone traffic calming options that do not involve significant construction.
Potential Traffic Calming Interventions
After evaluating these data and reviewing the site context and tools available, staff are
considering a menu of options for slowing vehicle speeds and improving safety for people
walking, biking, and driving. These include, a) roadway line striping at the edge of the travel
lanes; b) a pedestrian push button-activated Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon (RRFB)
device at an appropriate pedestrian crossing; and c) a speed feedback sign that alerts
drivers to their actual speed.
•
•
•

The roadway line striping would visually reduce the width of the roadway. Generally,
narrow travel lanes help to reduce drivers’ speed and improve safety for all users.
The narrow lanes create “visual friction” making drivers more aware of travel speed.
We also plan on installing an RRFB on Concord Avenue at the existing crosswalk at
Bond Street to alert drivers when someone is crossing the street at this location.
We will also review the potential installation of a speed feedback sign at an
appropriate location along the corridor.

Installation of these improvements would take place next spring based on the availability
of funds and contracts to install the RRFB and the speed feedback sign.
We have also added the segment of Concord Avenue between Huron Avenue and Garden
Street to the list of requests for traffic calming to be considered when the street is
programmed for reconstruction at some point in the future.

Awaiting Report 20-55 – Visitor Parking in Permit Area 14

This memo is in response to Order 10 from the September 14, 2020 City
Council Meeting (Awaiting Report 20-55) to report on alternative parking
options for residents with visitors in Visitor Parking Permit Area 14.
Visitor Parking Permit Area 14 covers the area more commonly known as North
Point. On-street parking in North Point is limited because many of the roads are
private ways and not public streets. At the time North Point was being
redeveloped from an industrial site and a former railroad yard into a mixed use
neighborhood, the decision was made to add a new, separate Visitor Parking
Permit Area (Area 14) and not extend the adjacent Visitor Parking Permit Area
(Area 1) to include North Point. Unlike many parts of Cambridge, the buildings
within North Point typically have off-street parking for residents and visitors,
significantly reducing the need to accommodate resident parking demand on
public streets. In addition, most of these buildings have transportation demand
management programs in place, which will encourage the use of sustainable
transportation and reduce the demand for parking.
Given the Visitor Parking Permit rules that are in effect and apply to all
residents, Traffic, Parking, and Transportation does not intend to extend the
designated parking area of Visitor Parking Permit Area 14 or allow residents
with visitors in Parking Permit Area 14 to park in another designated area.
However, in recognition of the fact that there are limited resident parking
spaces within the North Point area and the additional challenges that many
resident are experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are prepared to
work with residents in Visitor Parking Permit Area 14 to explore parking options
at the nearby First Street Garage that can accommodate the needs of their
visitors.

Residents may not use a Visitor Parking Permit on their own vehicle.
A Visitor Parking Permits allows non-residents to park in “Parking by

returned to the resident at the end of the visit and the permit may not be
used for commuter parking or any other purpose.
Visitors using a Visitor Parking Permit must move their vehicle every 24
hours and may not be parked within the same designated area for more
than three days within a week.

Awaiting Report 20-42 – Illegal Parking in Front of LBJ Apartments
(150 Erie Street)

This memo is in response to Order 2 from the September 14, 2020 City Council
Meeting (Awaiting Report 20-42) to report on a plan to increase enforcement of
the City’s parking regulations to discourage vehicles from parking illegally in
front of the LBJ Apartments located at 150 Erie Street.
As requested in the order, staff from Traffic, Parking, + Transportation (TP+T)
reached out to the Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA) to discuss these
parking concerns and collaborate on a solution.
The property managers for the LBJ Apartments report that on occasion there
are vehicles that temporarily pull into the No Parking area in front of the
building, or that park for a short time period. This includes vehicles that pull into
that space to drop off or pick up residents and/or escort residents to their
apartment, as well as The Ride vehicles operated for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority. The Ride has been advised that they should use the
rear parking lot and not to use the space in front of the building. However,
residents prefer to get dropped off in this location and often make that request
to their drivers, which The Ride will try to accommodate. Moving trucks and
delivery will also attempt to park in this location but they are typically asked to
move.
Emergency vehicles are on site almost daily at the LBJ Apartments. The
Cambridge Police Department (CPD) and Cambridge Fire Department have
indicated that an illegally parked vehicle in front of the LBJ apartments would
not impact the response time or impede the work of the first responders
because they would simply stop their vehicles in the middle of the street if the

Packet Pg. 56

Attachment: LBJ Erie Street parking enforcement 110220 (CMA 2020 #251 : Awaiting Report 20-42 RE: illegal parking in front of LBJ

1.5.a

loading zone was occupied (as happens on smaller streets throughout the city
on a daily basis).
If a call is made to the non-emergency public safety telephone line for a vehicle
parked in the file lane, CPD will respond by sending out the closest officer who
will tag and tow a vehicle if warranted. TP+T’s enforcement of 150 Erie Street is
covered by a Parking Control Supervisor who is in a vehicle. If the Supervisor
observes an illegally parked vehicle and is unable to get that vehicle to move,
they would notify CPD if there is a need for further action (including towing the
vehicle).
It is important to note that the area in front of the LBJ Apartments is currently
signed as a Loading Zone, which allows loading for up to 30 minutes for
commercial vehicles and up to 15 minutes for private vehicles. As a result, the
current passenger pick-up and drop-off activities that occur in this area are
legal, as long as those time limits are not exceeded. A vehicle can only be
towed from this location if it stayed beyond that time limit, was issued a ticket,
and then was towed under the authorization of the Cambridge Police
Department (CPD), since vehicles cannot be towed from a public way without
that authorization.
Given the concerns that have been expressed, we will continue to work
collaboratively with CPD and CHA to monitor the loading zone in front of the
LBJ Apartments to discourage vehicles from obstructing access to the building
or staying beyond the time allowed in the Loading Zone.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Below you will find information requested by the Ordinance Committee relative to draft
alternative language to the Green Energy Analysis Zoning Petition, received from Assistant City
Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq and City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa.
Overview
Following the August 26, 2020 hearing on the above-referenced zoning petition, the Ordinance
Committee asked CDD to suggest revised language in response to the Planning Board
recommendation dated August 19, 2020 and CDD staff comments. Staff from the Division of
Zoning and Development and the Division of Environmental and Transportation Planning
worked together, in consultation with the Law Department, to draft alternative language that
retains the intent of the petition, provides clearer guidance, and is better integrated into current
zoning.
As with the current petition, the suggested language would add a component to the “Net Zero
Narrative” requiring applicants to submit an assessment of the technical feasibility and cost of
installation of “fossil fuel free” energy systems as part of a project subject to Green Building
Requirements. The Net Zero Narrative is a public document that is made available to the
Planning Board and the public for advisory review when projects require special permits. The
revised language is intended to describe the scope of the assessment more clearly, to ensure that
developers provide clear and consistent information in a way that relates to other components of
the Net Zero Narrative.
Suggested Language
Insert a new Paragraph 22.25.1 (c) (6) in the “Net Zero Narrative” submission requirements to

Packet Pg. 58

1.6

read as follows:
“(6) an assessment of energy systems that do not consume fossil fuels on-site (to include solar
photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source heat pumps, district
energy systems, and/or similar systems) that examines technical feasibility to meet the projected
HVAC and domestic hot water demands of the building based on the information provided in
22.25.1(c)(2), and cost of installation taking into account incentives provided in 22.25.1(c)(5), all
compared to code-compliant energy systems that consume fossil fuels on-site.”
Because such an assessment requires time to complete before a final application can be
submitted, staff recommends that this additional paragraph take effect 90 days after the date of
adoption. That way, development proposals that are early in the pre-application review process
can begin to incorporate this requirement immediately, but proposals that are in the later stages
of review will not be unreasonably affected.
Very truly yours,

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Due in large part to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant decrease in parking
meter revenues, the Parking Fund revenues for the Traffic, Parking and Transportation
Department have suffered significantly this year. Accordingly, I am writing to request that you
approve the increase of the fee for a Resident Parking Permit/Pass from $25.00 to $40.00, by
amending the provisions of Chapter 10, Section 10.17.070 of the Municipal Code. The current
fee of $25.00 per Resident Parking Permit/Pass was established effective with 2013 permits. The
fee has historically been adjusted from time to time as costs rise, and this type of change is also
in keeping with our overall transportation and sustainability goals. The $40.00 fee more
accurately reflects current costs. I request that consideration be given so that if approved, the
City could implement this change prior to the 2021 renewal season, which effectively starts on
December 1, 2020 when the City opens the permit application portal.
The proposed amendment to the applicable provisions of the Municipal Code is attached for your
consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale

WHEREAS:

The intent of Article 22.000 of Cambridge’s Zoning Code is “to promote
environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient design and development practices in
new construction and renovation of buildings in the city”; and

WHEREAS:

The city has set goals for different building types to meet the highest standards for
environmentally sustainable design in the coming years; and

ORDERED:

Under 22.20 Green Building Requirements, the following will be added as Section
22.25.1 (c) (6):
an assessment of renewable energy systems that do not consume fossil fuels on-site (to
include solar photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source
heat pumps, district energy and geothermal systems, and/or similar systems) that
examines technical feasibility to meet the projected HVAC and domestic hot water
demands of the building based on the information provided in 22.25.1(c)(2), and cost
of installation, the cost of maintenance and operation of the renewable energy system
and its components, and the amount of any greenhouse gas emissions by source (other
than from a public utility or municipal lighting plant), taking into account incentives
provided in 22.25.1(c)(5), and other federal, state and local incentives available to the
developer, building owner and tenants, all compared to code-compliant energy systems
that consume fossil fuels on-site and any energy system (other than from a public
utility or municipal lighting plant) that consumes fossil fuels to be constructed or
expanded off-site to provide energy to the building. The assessment and any review by
the CDD as to the assessment shall be made available to the City and to the public and

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and

WHEREAS:

Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines

benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and

WHEREAS:

There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more
people in a given relationship; and

To the Honorable, the City Council:

This is in response to Policy Order Number O-13, of October 5, 2020, which requests that the
City Manager work with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department and the City
Solicitor with regard to a draft Truck Safety Ordinance which “would provide requirements for
safety improvements made to trucks owned by companies which have contracts with the City.”
After consultation with the Law Department and the Traffic, Parking and Transportation
Department, as well as the Department of Public Works, the Police Department, the Purchasing
Department and the Community Development Department, I am forwarding a Truck Safety
Ordinance that contains the measures that could be taken to improve the safety of large trucks
utilized by City vendors, particularly in relation to the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. Similar
to the ordinance in Boston, the attached ordinance requires side guards and other safety measures
with respect to trucks operated by vendors contracting with the City.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager

Transfer Tax

Hello,
I am writing as a home owner in Cambridge for many years and want to express my opposition to a transfer tax. It is
unfair to tax one segment of the population. There is constant change in the market and this can only put downward
pressure on the real estate market.

Disappointing Anti-Gay Incident by East Cambridge Planning Team Board Member

Dear Council,

I write to share my post about a disappointing recent incident involving a board member of the East Cambridge
Planning Team. In light of this and past incidents and the flawed response of the ECPT Board, I hope you will
take prompt action to sever all ties between the City and this group.

Best,
Justin
Disappointing Anti-Gay Incident by East Cambridge Planning Team Board Member

The East Cambridge Planning Team is a City of Cambridge Neighborhood Association. Neighborhood
Associations in Cambridge play both formal, official roles on behalf of the City, including with regard to local
issues like curb cut authorizations, as well as very important informal, quasi-official roles on behalf of the City,
including assessing neighborhood support for local projects and working with the proponents of such projects
to address local concerns.
These projects can run the gamut from adding a small roof deck to constructing a large new building. Given the
powerful gatekeeping role these groups play, large developers often meet privately with and tailor the benefits
of new developments to the interests of the leaders of these groups.
In order to properly serve the significant role they play on behalf of Cambridge, these groups need to welcome
and reflect local diversity, particularly in a diverse urban neighborhood like East Cambridge, and include all
residents of the neighborhood.
A shocking anti-gay incident recently occurred on the East Cambridge Planning Team (or ECPT) email list.
One of the group’s board members engaged in an unacceptable incident of sexual harassment of a gay
member of the group and then issued a non-apology apology purporting to explain that instead doubled down
on the anti-gay harassment and othering.
After this board member sent an earlier email wrongly attacking the personal politics of the person targeted for
harassment (which was encouraged and seconded by a group leader and another member), this board
member railed (falsely) against participation by non-neighborhood residents and then stated:
Talking of which I invite [this neighbor] to share his bondage underwear website with us along with an explanation
of why we have to listen to an [irrelevant reference to political views] recommending that we take his views about
East Cambridge seriously. BTW [neighbor] you look ripped in that medieval leather thong.

While this board member has apparently resigned, in the board’s public statement in response to the incident,
it failed to take any responsibility for its role in fostering the hostile environment in which this incident took

4.4.a

Packet Pg. 175

place. Moreover, since releasing its statement, none of the current Board members has reached out to the
person who was harassed to apologize directly.
Clearly, given this deficient response, the group’s leadership still fails to understand its need to function as a
group that represents, and welcomes, ALL members of the East Cambridge community. The tone set by the
group’s leadership is often highly negative, and relative newcomers to the neighborhood and those with views
that do not conform to the views of the leadership are made to feel very unwelcome. The group has
relentlessly erected barriers to participation, including an insular environment and a set of strict rules for voting
membership that almost certainly have a disparate impact along racial and socioeconomic lines. The group
also failed to hold scheduled elections earlier this month, despite having rescheduled those elections in late
March.
The City should not have any ties--formal or informal, official or unofficial--to a group that has devolved to the
extent that it has allowed this event to transpire and continues to fail to grapple with its complicity. The group’s
leadership has failed to respond to this appalling incident in such a way as to inspire any confidence that it
understands or accepts the need for profound change or to improve going forward, beyond proposing to better
moderate its email list, something it has promised to do in the past in light of other personal attacks but that did
not prevent this recurrence. The City of Cambridge prides itself on its welcoming, progressive nature, but
maintaining any ties with this group draws the sincerity of those values into serious question.
Given these ongoing failings, the City needs to sever its relationship with this group going forward.
[I have purposely omitted the names of, and certain potentially identifying information of, those involved in the
incident--I think the focus now rightfully belongs on the City and its response.]

Residents Alliance comments on preventing evictions and protecting tenants

Importance:

High

For the 10/28/20 Housing Committee meeting:
Dear Mayor and Councilors,
The Cambridge Residents Alliance supports a stronger Cambridge Eviction Moratorium, and we are glad the Council
passed PO #10, which calls for working with the Legal Dept. to include enforcement language that prevents landlords
from trying to force tenants out before a Sheriff enforces an eviction. We have been asking for stronger tenant
protections for years, and certainly protection from eviction would be our top priority. We are worried that the end of
the state eviction moratorium, along with the weakness and complexity of the federal eviction moratorium, could lead
to numerous evictions here in Cambridge. The new state program will not be available quickly enough to help incomeeligible tenants, so preventing eviction is even more important. And eviction tends to disproportionately impact people
of color and low income people.
We ask that updated and complete info on Cambridge’s eviction moratorium be mailed to all tenants and
landlords. We’d like the city to clarify the status of its outreach about the moratorium, including on social media, to
both tenants and landlords. For example, I am a landlord of a two-family, and have not yet received the city’s postcard
(CMA #235) about the existing Cambridge eviction moratorium and the new tenant protection rules that began on
10/14. We request that full information about the moratorium and the new tenant protection, not just postcards, be
mailed to both current tenants and landlords. Also, flyers could be delivered to groups that work with low-income
people, like Cambridge non-profits, Margaret Fuller House, Community Arts Center, food pantries, etc. The city could
pay for banners on public buildings that say something like “Only a judge can evict you- call XXX for help.” The FAQ
document should be equally aimed at tenants and landlords; currently, it is aimed at landlords.
Cambridge could, like Boston, create an Eviction Prevention Task Force consisting of small property owners, legal
services agencies, housing service and rental assistance providers, public health organizations, tenant advocates,
community development corporations, and City of Boston staff. Boston's Task Force released a report in Dec. 2019 with
detailed recommendations to reduce evictions, many of which could work in Cambridge:
https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-walsh-announces-new-action-plan-evictions-boston
Cambridge could, like Boston, require an Eviction Prevention Plan for any developer applying to the city for funding to
create income-restricted housing. The Plan provides details on what steps will be taken by the management company in
eviction scenarios. Developers are required to submit an updated report that lists all eviction and displacement risk data
on a yearly basis.
The city could contract with tenant organizers, such as City Life/Vida Urbana, who try to identify buildings at risk.
The city could ask its immigrant services/outreach providers to do a lot of outreach in the immigrant communities about
rental assistance and tenant rights, and work together with school liaisons to identify families in need of assistance.

Attachment: Lee Farris_Residents Alliance comments on preventing evictions and protecting tenants (COM 713 #2020 : A communication was

4.5.a

Packet Pg. 177

The city could contract with a social service organization to do affirmative outreach to tenants whose cases are filed
in court.
We would like the Council to request an update from city staff on how much demand for all types of housing services
has increased during the pandemic, and how that demand has been met (or not), including for legal services and rent
assistance. The Council may need to allocate more funds to assist tenants.
We’d like the city to provide ongoing publicly available documentation of evictions in Cambridge and their reasons.
We’d also like the city to create a policy to address the problem of tenants being forced out due to renovations, as
Vancouver has done (see below), including either requiring the property owner to provide renter relocation assistance
to tenants, or the city could provide such assistance. The city could require written notice at least 90 days in advance of
the effective date of a no-fault eviction or significant rent increase.
“After hearing from dozens of tenants whose landlords were attempting to ‘renovict’ them, Vancouver city
council has unanimously passed a motion to better protect renters. The motion as passed will change the city’s
tenant relocation and protection guidelines to require landlords to offer tenants to temporarily move out to
accommodate renovations without ending the tenancy. The city will now also track all apartment buildings sold,
and as soon as a sale happens, will mail information to the tenants in those buildings informing them of their
rights. To address the growing trend of landlords offering tenants buyouts to move out without going through an
eviction attempt, the city will also explore measures “to regulate and publicly register all tenants buyouts.’ This
was only a partial success for the tenant activists, however. ‘Councillor Jean Swanson, a long-time housing
activist, brought the motion forward and heralded council’s decision as only a partial victory for tenants, because
council did not approve all parts of her motion.” Vancouver passes motion to protect tenants from renoviction
(Dec. 5, 2018).
What is the status of the proposal that the city directly notify tenants, when buildings are sold, of the tenants' rights,
including that a Notice to Quit does not mean the tenant must leave, and how tenants can seek help? Does the city
document the number of such sales each year, or could it start doing so?
We’d like the city to establish a process for advancing the recommendations of the Committee on Tenant Displacement,
including addressing the issue of tenants who are displaced due to condo conversions.
Thank you for your consideration of these proposals. We look forward to working with the Council and city staff to
better protect tenants in Cambridge.
Sincerely,
Lee Farris, President

Residents Alliance Supports Home Rule Petition for a Real Estate Transfer Fee

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in strong support of a Home Rule Petition for a Real Estate Transfer
Fee. Clearly Cambridge needs more funds to provide more affordable housing for low, moderate, and middle-income
people. A transfer fee on commercial and residential real estate transactions would be a great way to generate millions
in funds for affordable housing.
Now we hope the Council will take the draft petition language offered by Councilor Carlone and shape it to Cambridge’s
needs, approve it, then submit to the state legislature. We can discuss the exemption level, the rate, whether buyers or
sellers pay, and more. Boston’s Transfer Fee is a 2 percent fee on any transaction over $2 million. Somerville has a one
percent tax with no threshold, but owner-occupied buyers and sellers are exempt.
I am part of the state-wide Transfer Fee Coalition chaired by Ellen Shachter, which is working for a statewide enabling
act to allow communities to enact a transfer fee. Several of those petitions have gotten approval from House
committees. Cambridge passing a home rule petition for a transfer fee would add to the momentum towards passing
the state-wide legislation.
The Cambridge Residents Alliance looks forward to working with you to develop Cambridge-specific language for a
transfer fee.
Thank you,

Please support these Policy Orders tonight

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
I urge you to support
• The charter-righted Policy Order by Councillor Carlone asking City Council adopt a municipal ordinance to

reduce or limit campaign donations from donors seeking to enter into a contract, seeking approval for a
special permit or up-zoning, seeking to acquire real estate from the city, or seeking financial assistance
from the city. This will go along way to bringing greater transparency to city government.
o I learned yesterday that there are 2400 vacant apartments in East Cambridge. We can’t simply
build more and more, all the while jacking up the property values making it more difficult for
those long-standing residents with lower incomes to continue to live here.
•

The Policy Order by Councillor Simmons to direct the Community Development Department to
commence the public process with the Port neighborhood and surrounding communities to determine the

Dear City Council,
I write to you in support of the petition for Campaign Finance Reform brought by Councilor Carlone and
others. It is time we took money out of politics. Look at the wretched mess our country is in and how
much money is spent on trying to influence elections. Enough is enough. Let's take money out of politics
in Cambridge.
Thank you.

Dear City Council,

I support Councillor Carlone's draft language in support of an ordinance to reduce campaign

donations from donors seeking to enter into a contract, seeking approval
for a special permit or up-zoning, seeking to acquire real estate from the
city, or seeking financial assistance from the city. Such entities could be
required to fill out disclosure forms on their political contributions. Noncompliance or violations of the pay to play law will result in the loss of
contracts with the city.

Campaign finance reform

Dear Council members:
I am writing in support of Dennis Carlone's ordinance to limit campaign contributions from individuals seeking
to do business with the city. Just as campaign finance reform is critically needed at the state and federal levels,
which most or all councilors likely agree, it is also imperative that political decisions in Cambridge are not
tainted by contributions to councilors' campaigns.
Many critical decisions will be coming before the Council as it grapples with the dire need for housing, coping
with COVID-19, and mitigating against the climate crisis. Cambridge residents need to have trust in the
motivations of their city councilors making these difficult decisions about permitting, taxation, and
regulations. In my 30+ years as a Cambridge voter I have trusted my elected officials. However, no one is
immune to the influence of money even when they believe they are acting in a wholly unbiased manner.
Limiting campaign contributions allows residents to trust in their councilors while providing councilors with
protection against unfair claims of financially-influenced bias.
Please vote in favor of Dennis Carlone's ordinance limiting campaign contributions from individuals to $200.
Thank you,
Sally Orme

I am proud to be a Cambridge Residents Alliance member supporting the measure to limit campaign contributions by

and not just do whatever developers and MIT want them to do.

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Esteemed Members of the City Council;

I would like to take this opportunity to respond to Councillor Simmons’ letter of October 28, 2020
and to share with you some positive aspects of the Cambridge Brands building project.
I have tried to start a dialogue directly with Councillor Simmons but to date she has not returned
my phone calls or email requests to speak.
For the record, Mr. Doty is a sub-contractor of GMA Architects & Engineers. GMA was hired to
design our building. While Mr. Doty was acting on behalf of Cambridge Brands to interface with
Inspectional Services, DPW and the curb cut approval process with the City Council, his
remarks do not represent Cambridge Brands opinion of Councillor Simmons request for
information. To his credit, he has worked very hard to navigate the many requirements to get
before the City Council but made a poor decision to express his frustration in the manner in
which he did. When I became aware of his remarks I immediately reached out to Councillor
Simmons with the following email, as did Mr. Doty.

I can assure you Cambridge Brands does not view this process or any aspect of the city’s
permitting process a game, nor do we see Councillor Simmons’ inquiries as frivolous and we
have made every good faith effort to answer her questions.
Her recent letter questions our recruitment practices. We are a lean organization and have a
very stable workforce (average tenure 20 years) but when openings arise we have reached out
to area schools with limited success. In 2018, we hired a recent graduate of MIT, as a
Packaging Maintenance Supervisor. As previously stated, we participate and promote job
opportunities through:




The Cambridge Works intern program
Collaborate with the City of Cambridge Office of Workforce Development/Cambridge
Employment Program
Cambridge Career Source

As stated in my email, sent 10/26/2020 Cambridge Brands has worked with all city departments
with favorable results. We have found the permitting process to be a learning experience but it
has helped us understand the inner workings of city government
In 2016 -17, we shared our final design plan with all abutters. However, during our community
outreach meeting in March 2017, we were notified by one of them that their long-range plans
had changed and we could no longer count on leasing property from them. This new and
unexpected news required us to do a complete redesign.
We started the permitting process in 2019. Now this has put us to the next step of asking for
approval of our curb cuts before the City Council. This curb cut variance we are seeking is
required by the Department of Public Works.
At every step in this process of vetting our design and operation, we have tried to make this new
building addition state of the art and neighbor-friendly. As a result we can claim the following;


Brand new safe, efficient primary and secondary electrical gear that meets all Federal,
State and City code.

By redesigning traffic patterns of incoming trucks into Cambridge we have reduced 18

Reduced external noise by designing internal truck cooling systems eliminating the

Roof top air handling units that are well within city noise ordinances
Upgraded ancillary parking facility on Columbia Street with security cameras which will

Designing a mural on Main Street to tell the story of Candy History in Cambridge for

Upgrades to the current building requested by Cambridge Fire Department.
Upgrades to outside building lighting and landscaping.

Due to Food Safety and Food Defense concerns, particularly after regulatory changes in food
manufacturing following the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, we have
had to be more restrictive regarding access to our operations, particularly in an urban
environment.
While Cambridge Brands respects Councilor Simmons comments and questions, we have tried
to be engaged with the city as referenced in my presentation and will continue to do so.
Cambridge Brands has met all city requirements in good faith. We are long standing member of
the community dating back to 1908 and a responsible employer who truly invests in our
employees and try to help them succeed. When they succeed, the community succeeds.
We provide revenue to the City of Cambridge and while this may make us a small fish in a very
big pond, we are committed to Cambridge both in the short and long-term. We hope the Council
will look favorably on our curb cut request and vote to support it on November 2, 2020.
I sincerely hope you will base your decision on the work we have done to date in the permitting
process not an unfortunate misjudgment of a contractor’s (Mr. Doty) email.

Campaign Finance Reform

Hello City Councilors,
It is my belief that the people who have to live with the impacts of City decisions should have the largest
say in policy-making, more so than people who derive profits but don't feel the negative impacts.
While I respect that all the Councilors believe they are not influenced by funding sources in their decisions,
the issue is that people who support certain types of policies tend to get money from the people who profit
from those choices. This becomes an issue during campaigning when candidates with larger budgets,
often derived largely from profiteers outside the city, can outspend other candidates who may be
supporting residents with less available funds.
I feel there should be a cap on allowed campaign expenditures, but a good first step might be to limit
contributions from outside profiteers, and I think the issue should be discussed further by the Ordinance
Committee.

I work for the first large employer to move into Cambridge Crossing (formerly known as North Point), the large planned
development project near Lechmere Station. From the office, I saw the cranes surrounding the building that were
starting work on the next buildings. I live near Alewife Station. These two areas are where the city has been
encouraging a lot of growth, particularly in housing.
There is no easy transportation connection between the two areas. Although I live and work near T stations, they are
not on the same line, and there is no transfer except through Boston. When businesses used to be open, the only
options to reach work would take at least 45 minutes to cross town - except by bike, because I would only need to wait
for one red light at main intersections instead of three traffic light cycles.
The only realistic way to reach Cambridge Crossing is by Cambridge Street. That segment of my trip was the one that I
felt most risked my life.
We should be creating a safe bike network that includes connections to the areas the City is encouraging the most
development.
Thank you for supporting a safe network that I hope will be implemented in a thoughtful way.
sincerely,

Money out of politics

Dear Councilors This is to request the Council vote to send Denis Carlone's draft ordinance to the Ordinance Committee for
discussion. Cambridge DOES need to have a full airing of this issue. We can see how money has corrupted campaigning
at the national level and distorted priorities.
Cambridge can and should lead the way in "clean" campaigns and elections. I can think of no reason [other than the
rather uncomplimentary and sinister one] to not give this ordinance a fair, open and public hearing.
Please move this ordinance on to the ordinance committee.

SUPPORT MOVING FINANCE REFORM TO ORDINANCE COMMITTEE

I am writing in SUPPORT OF PO #1, MOVING THE PROHIBITING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FROM PEOPLE DOING
BUSINESS
WITH THE CITY. TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE.
It is a shame that after the June 2019 policy order was approved and placed at the door of the city solicitor, we have to
re-visit this
"divisive" topic. But Issues still remain.
To date, there still seems to be a correlation between politics, projects and votes when it comes to development pressures
and favoritism.
Whether a look of impropriety or not, it is important that those businesses don't try to sway councillors by contributions.
It could look like "pay to play." Other municipalities are tackling this also. We can learn from them. And I would think that
elected officials
would want to avoid these conflicts at all costs. It is neither "offensive or divisive" to remind councilors where
their allegiance lay.
Limiting campaign funds shouldn't be a confrontation unless it challenges the conscience of the individual taking
advantage of the situation.
We see certain lobbyists and special interest groups also benefiting by having seats at the advisory table.
Not only have we seen it in re-zoning which benefits developers who produce exorbitant and unaffordable
market rate housing (and not enough inclusionary or working class), we see erosion of protocol and interference
by certain city officials who closely follow activists and their twitter-feeds. I do not see this ordinance impacting
citizens zoning petitions. On the contrary. Big money is infused when big profits at stake and that includes
the Cannabis Industry. Many of these groups have PACs camouflaging direct donations harder to track.
If Council is sincere at looking at the bigger problem instead of waiving off the issue because it is too hard,
or too many moving parts, or should involve the school committee even though its budget gets approved by the council,
or needing a tighter re-write, then please DO IT because the principle involved is vital to citizen protection.
The fact that the council is being asked to police itself may prove to be the bigger concern.
A hollow policy or not, at least make a sincere effort to address this on-going scourge affecting a fair democratic process.
Please send this policy order to TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE. If it has to be re-written, if it needs more specifics or
teeth
because the principle involved is vital to a fair democratic process.
But I think PO #1 is a step in the right direction
We need more oversight when it comes to campaign finance donations with a hard
limit. Like everything else, it can always be amended. A hand-slap is not good enough.
thank you.

Support for P.O. #4 Prohibiting Campaign Donations from People Doing Business with
the City

P.O. #4 is a step in the right direction for equity in voter representation. Many Cambridge citizens feel the only way they
can get equal representation in government is to move to another city.
Nearly half of all American households don’t even have $1,000 in savings right now. There is no way the average citizen
can compete with the big donations of those having business with the city. If money didn't talk, these businesses
wouldn't bother with campaign contributions.

our elected officials are just as human as the rest
of us. We need this reform because our elected officials
are subject to the same temptations as "normal" people.
We need this reform because our elected officials sometimes
have great difficulty in giving up the reins of power. One only has
to look at a newspaper for almost daily examples.
Three past Speakers in the State House are convicted felons. Huge
scandals have developed in our State Police Force and
in some of our city police departments because they could not
control their own greed, and lust to stay in power.

Public Comment 11/2/2020, POR #246, #247, #252

Hello,
I just wanted to email to register my support for POR 2020 #246, 247, 252.
With regard to #246, I support this process commencing and moving forward with the objectives codified in the policy
order, as quickly, but also considerately, as possible.
With regard to #247, I simply want to reiterate the fact that the most pressing need at this moment is that tenants are
aware of their rights. We are currently in a stage where new formal eviction cases will take time to process, so the
greatest risk is that informal evictions will go through in which tenants are not able to avail themselves of all of their
rights. In this raging pandemic, this should never happen.
With regard to #252, I applaud the effort to use data to inform our next action steps on limiting evictions as much as
possible. I would ask to amend this order, however, to make it very clear that, in generating this data, the city must also
make sure to not inadvertently expose tenants' data to easier access by landlords, and thus make them subject to a very
common form of discrimination. If this cannot be done, as discussed in a recent housing committee meeting, perhaps a
better alternative is to obtain the aggregate data from a source that is able to maintain the confidentiality of individuals'
records.
Finally, I just wanted to echo what I've written in the past: that in all of policy choices right now, I believe that we must
continue to recognize that rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively make and
maintain, and we need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status quo.
Thank you so much,

Manager's communication regarding parking permit fee increase

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,
I am writing regarding the City Manager’s request to increase parking permit fees from $25 to $40. In 2013 the city
raised the fee from $10 to $25. It was later mentioned that no one had complained about the increase. I did not
complain at that time even though it was a hardship for me but I want my voice heard now.
As far as I know, only people with a handicap placard are able to have their fee waived. There is a misconception that
low income people do not have cars. Families with children, people who are older yet do not meet the strict
qualifications for a placard, people who work at jobs which are outside the reach of the MBTA often have no choice but
to own a car. I live in the Quadrangle area of Cambridge and need my car to get to services and meetings in Central
Square. I already have to pay to park in the garage in my building. Since the city has dramatically increased the use of
meters in places which used to be resident parking and increased the rate at these meters, I already pay a significant
amount to park in Cambridge.
This fee and lack of parking prevents many of us from accessing public meetings in person (when they resume.) When
was the last time a resident from Corcoran Park spoke at city council? During Covid 19, I do not feel safe taking a bus or
the T. In addition, the T is an uncomfortable, unsafe walk across a narrow bridge heavily used by bicycles. I bought a
bike but was nervous using it and my tight gripping of the handlebars gave me carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition with
which I am still struggling.
Please do not increase the permit fees. Even without Covid, we do not have a system where all of us can get to many
places in the city without a car. I use my car sparingly and only have 60,000 miles on my 2007 Civic. But I need it to get to
an affordable grocery store (not Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s), the library and other places. The Council and the
administration have chosen to create areas like Alewife that have no stores, libraries, schools, parks and other amenities
the city provides. I do not want to have to use my car. I am worried about the climate crisis, flooding, heat island zones
and civil unrest. I do not use airplanes which pollute terribly. I love trees which I watch being destroyed on a daily basis
in Cambridge . It is counter to my beliefs to drive a car that uses gas but I have to at this point.
Thank you for your attention to this overly long letter. Stay safe!
Sincerely,
Kathy Watkins

35 Cherry Street

Dear Council Members,
I am very happy that the city is considering constructing housing on the 35 Cherry Street lot which has been a barren
eyesore for as long as I can remember.
I would like for the Council to understand that the issue of housing in The Port must be understood within the context of
the role of the Federal government in racially segregating Cambridge, and denying Black citizens of Cambridge access to
wealth.
The dwindling presence of Black people in Cambridge, and the absence of Black people in the economic life of our city in
no small part can be attributed to federal, state and city governmental housing policy. It was the housing policy of FDR's
New Deal that lifted working class white families out of poverty, and explicitly denied the same elevator ride to black
people.
Newton Court and Washington Elms are-- discussed in The Color of Law, by Richard Rothstein--a must read for anyone
seeking to understand the history of our country's housing policy. I think that the 35 Cherry street lot provides an
opportunity for the city to develop a project of home ownership--one which provides housing and a first step towards
building wealth for many who were denied such opportunity because of the color of their skin. I also feel that the
project should be expanded to include the vacant building at the corner of School and Windsor street.
Our family has lived on the corner of School and Cherry Street since 1983 and our property is located directly across the
street from 35 Cherry Street. We would like to be very involved in discussions about the future of the Cherry Street lot,
the building on the corner of Windsor and School Street, and other development projects in the Port.
Thank you,

Policy Order by Carlone and others on limiting political contributions

Dear City Councilors,
It is crucial for the future of Cambridge as a city that is diverse and welcoming to people of all income
levels and from all racial and ethnic groups that we adopt the proposal to limit political contributions from people and
entities doing business from the city.
I want to address the risk to the quality of the city posed by contributions from developers.
Over many years Cambridge has attracted intense commercial development, making it
Massachusetts most favored location for commercial investment. The resultant commercial development has come at
a price; as commercial development grew, we lost affordable housing stock and lost residents, particularly working-class
people with modest to moderate incomes. This, of course, meant a decrease in the number of our long-term residents
of color.
One of the features that make Cambridge so attractive to commercial development is our
commercial property tax rate. In 2020, the Cambridge rate was $12.68, ranking the city as the 53rd lowest rate in the
state out of 344 towns and cities. In contrast, Boston charges $24.92, Somerville, $16.32 and Brookline $15/53.
Notice that if we had charged only $1.00 more, we would still have had a rate much lower than
that of neighboring cities. And, with the additional revenue generated, we could have addressed some of our
affordable housing needs, some of our educational needs and some of our social service needs.
That is, Cambridge’s tax policies favor private developers at the expense of residents, particularly
those residents who need affordable housing, public education, and social services.
Why raise this issue in the context of a discussion about contributions to candidates running for city
office? It is because so many of the political contributions come from people and organizations that benefit from these
low commercial property taxes.
By eliminating these donations, we can eliminate what many hypothesize to be a means of
influence.
Yours truly,

Dear Council,
It is with great sadness we at ECPT grieve the passing of Rich McKinnon. Rich came to ECPT meetings for almost 30 years
as a neighbor and also as a developer representative. I first met Rich when I was Vice President of ECPT in 1994. Since
then he has become a beloved neighborhood institution. No matter how much he argued with you, it always ended with
a handshake and a hug. He always had a big place in his heart for East Cambridge and the people who lived here. He was
loved and will be greatly missed by many. Rest in peace.
Very truly yours,

Campaign Finance Reform

To the Honorable City Council:
I earnestly support the policy order regarding campaign finance reform.
First of all, when I consult the OCPF (Office of Campaign and Political Finance) website, I
am shocked by all of the donations to certain councillors by entities doing business with
the city and by people who don't live in Cambridge. Those non-residents are very
suspicious and I doubt if they are all family members of those candidates.
To me it says that those candidates are not well-liked or supported by enough Cambridge
voters and therefore they have to seek financing from questionable donors.
Secondly, I find some of the questions asked by the councillors opposing the policy order to
be disingenuous and some to be flimsy or fake. However, it also occurs to me that only
those guilty of accepting a lot of money from entities doing business with the city would
raise these silly questions. The tone of the questions points to a guilty conscience by the
questioners.
Thirdly, I would expect all city councillors to favor campaign finance reform. It is the right
thing action to take. By not supporting campaign finance reform, they lose the respect of
Cambridge voters. They certainly have lost my respect.
Finally, with the lies and devious actions of the current administration in Washington, the
american people have lost confidence in people elected to public office. It is sad that some
of the Cambridge City Councillors seem to have taken a page out the playbook of the
current federal office holders.
“We’re in the middle of a pandemic. We shouldn’t be focusing on this.”
Really? Then it follows that the council should not be focusing on any policy orders or
other city council business. Someone missed the logic of this statement.

About POR2020#240

Dear Councilors:
I am writing in support of POR 2020 #240, from Councilor Carlone, joined by Councilors Nolan, SobrinhoWheeler and Zondervan: “That the City Council adopt a municipal ordinance to reduce or limit campaign
donations from donors seeking to enter into a contract, seeking approval for a special permit or up-zoning,
seeking to acquire real estate from the city, or seeking financial assistance from the city.”
The people of Cambridge need assurances that decisions on the business of the City will not be influenced by
campaign contributions. The most straightforward way to accomplish that objective is to adopt this
ordinance. I would hope that all of you would welcome this measure to assure that the possibility of undue
influence is off the table.
It is my understanding that a similar ordinance has been operative in Somerville since 2016, to good effect,
and that a number of cities and counties in New Jersey have implemented similar laws. We can learn from the
examples of these other localities and craft an ordinance that works well in Cambridge.
I appreciate that Councilor Carlone took the initiative to bring the ordinance to the Council. I urge the Council
to work with him to address all concerns and draft the best version possible as soon as possible.
Best regards,

CMA 2020 #253 for City Council Public Comment November 2, 2020

Hello,
I'm writing in favor of CMA 2020 #253 to increase the Residential Parking Permit/Pass fee to $40 for the 2021 season.
Private vehicle storage is a costly use of public land. We have more residents than we had in 2013 and the demand for
vehicles has increased with Uber, Lyft, and COVID-19. We have also seen new demands on our public spaces with
COVID-19, from restaurants taking over metered spaces for outdoor dining, opening Memorial Drive to allow walkers to
socially distance, and finding sites appropriate for voting and COVID-19 testing.
I encourage the City to charge more for this use by residents, as well as for metered parking spaces. Undercharging for
parking makes residents who choose more climate-friendly modes of transportation subsidize the use of private vehicles
by other residents.
My understanding from reviewing the Vision Zero Coalition survey in 2019 that all members of the Council other than
Councillor Toomey (who did not answer the survey) supported either an annual fee increase from $25 or a fee higher
than $25 atop a progressive fee structure.
I also support a progressive fee structure. However, if it is not possible to implement one before the start of renewal on
December 1, I think a simple fee increase should be implemented for 2021 with a progressive fee structure prioritized
for 2022.
Thank you,

Support for all Policy Orders on Tonight's Agenda

Dear Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,
I was really happy to read tonight's City Council agenda. I agree with all the Policy Orders and particularly with
#2, 3, 7 & 8. Thanks to all for their leadership in keeping residents safe and housed during these difficult times.
I have a few comments and suggestions that may help us further meet the needs of tenants most at-risk
during this time:
Policy Order #2
•
•

It's exciting to hear that a community process for the Cherry Street lot will be beginning. Thanks to
Councilor Simmons for this important policy order.
It would be great if we added to the policy order that the CDD process must include information on
housing waitlists from affordable housing providers such as CHA and JAS. Community input is essential
but waitlist data, such as the amount of time an applicant of a certain income and a certain sized
household has been on the waitlist, will tell us who is most in need of housing in our city, and therefore
suggest what the income restrictions and units sizes should be.

Policy Order #3
•

•

•
•

This is so important! Thanks to all who cosponsored this P.O. Data out of other municipalities with
eviction moratoriums suggest that evictions are still proceeding. Moratoriums have helped put a
damper on "the surge," but have not prevented eviction fully. https://evictionlab.org/evictiontracking/
Outreach should include a door-to-door campaign, especially in areas with a higher percentage of
immigrants and lower-income tenants. Lots of folks don't check their mail or have their address listed
differently.
Materials should be multilingual
Materials should make clear the resources accessible to tenants who do not have a lease or who are
undocumented immigrants

Policy Order #8

•

Evictions last on a tenant's record for seven years in Massachusetts. That's seven years of being
severely hindered in your housing search in what is already a tight housing market. Evictions also hit
lower-income renters, families, and communities of color disproportionately. Legislation out of

•

•

Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Portland, OR suggest ways forward, such as limiting evictions to appearing
for 3 years only on a tenant's record, barring credit screenings, eliminating racial bias in rental
screenings, and limiting property owners from charging first, last, and security deposits to incoming
tenants.
It's really great news that the City has obtained eviction information. I completely agree with the
language, "Facilitated discussions between property owners and tenants can reduce or eliminate
evictions and lead to solutions that are beneficial for both parties."
In the future, a citywide survey that asks tenants if they can afford next month's rent, and if they had
been asked to leave their housing (without an eviction) in the last 12 months would be useful, as that
would help the city get ahead of an eviction surge and also provide data on housing insecurity that
can't be understood through eviction cases alone. Many scenarios which are "like evictions," eg.
tenants being told to leave because the building is getting redeveloped or because of nonpayment of
rent, end in the tenant departing with an informal agreement on payment. It would be beneficial to
have another methodology to build a complete picture of housing security/insecurity in Cambridge.

Thank you all!

WHEREAS:

This year on Veterans’ Day, we celebrate the 102nd anniversary of the armistice that
finally silenced the guns of World War I; millions of brave Americans marched into
Europe and into the brutality of trench warfare to fight that war; and

WHEREAS:

There are more than 22 million living veterans who served our Nation in times of
peace and war—many of them willingly entered harm’s way to fight for our freedoms.
These veterans have diverse religious beliefs and come from varying backgrounds and
ethnicities, and by their service, they kept America strong, with men and women of the
armed services and reserve components serving around the world and here at home;
and

WHEREAS:

On Veterans’ Day, let us pause to reflect on the sacrifices of all of those who have put
on the uniform to serve in the United States military; let us honor our veterans who
proved their heroism and love of country, time and time again; and

WHEREAS:

We shall always be grateful for the noble sacrifices made by these veterans; we can
never adequately repay them; but we can honor and respect them for their service and
their sacrifice, and we can pledge that we will ask for this sacrifice only through
careful, honest, and conscious decisions rooted in our founding principles of justice
and human rights; and

WHEREAS:

As we consider the sacrifices and efforts of our veterans, we will never forget the men
and women of past wars for whom there is still no accounting; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That this City Council goes on record urging all residents to honor the men and women
who have defended our country, as well as those who are serving today by
commemorating Veterans’ Day on Wednesday, November 11, 2020.

WHEREAS:

The City’s comprehensive plan, Envision Cambridge, reiterates increasing affordable
housing as a community goal and includes an action item to prioritize using City and
other public property available for disposition to develop affordable housing; and

WHEREAS:

As part of a 2013 agreement related to the PUD-5 rezoning, MIT conveyed the parcel

WHEREAS:

Massachusetts’ statewide eviction moratorium expired on October 17th, 2020, but
Cambridge’s municipal eviction moratorium remains in effect until further notice; and

WHEREAS:

Evictions always pose a significant public health risk to our residents through housing
destabilization and financial impact, but evictions are an even greater public health
concern amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, as evicted residents may ‘double up,’ leading
to increased household transmission, or become homeless; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge eviction moratorium prevents constables from forcibly carrying out an
eviction order, but residents may not be aware of nor fully understand the rights they
have under the moratorium, and may be misled to incorrectly believe they must leave
their home; and

WHEREAS:

The Multiservice Center, the City Manager’s Housing Liaison Office, and community
organizations offer free housing support, financial assistance, case management,
referrals, legal services, and more, but tenants similar may not be aware that these
resources exist; and

WHEREAS:

While some housing professionals were sent an informational letter, and there are plans
to send out a postcard on tenant protection to all households, the City must quickly
develop a robust virtual outreach strategy using all means of communication,
especially social media and CPS communication channels, in order to truly educate and
protect tenants’ health and housing stability; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Public
Information Office, the Housing Liaison, the Multiservice Center, the School
Department, and other relevant City departments to create a comprehensive digital,
postal, and traditional media outreach campaign educating residents on the Cambridge
eviction moratorium, tenants’ rights, and resources available to at-risk tenants; and be

Under current state law, individuals can contribute up to $1,000 per year to municipal

WHEREAS:

This $1,000 threshold can create an unfair playing field in municipal elections and

WHEREAS:

There is a concern that large campaign contributions may lead to unfair access and

would limit campaign contribution to anyone contributing to a City Council campaign;

Re: Memo Re Cambridge Brands Curb Cut
Dear Mr. Wilson:
I am submitting this letter for inclusion on the November 2, 2020 City Council meeting
agenda. I exercised my Charter Right on the curb cut request by Cambridge Brands during the
October 19, 2020 City Council meeting, and during the October 26 City Council meeting, I
referenced an email exchange between myself, Paula Yetman from Cambridge Brands, and Charles
Doty from Cambridge Brands that took place following the October 19th meeting. I am submitting
that email exchange as part of this communication so that my colleagues can better understand what I
was referencing last week.
For further clarification: during the October 19th City Council meeting, I brought forward
some legitimate concerns about the level of outreach conducted by Cambridge Brands to its
neighbors, as well as the overall level of civic engagement by this company during those times when
they are not seeking something from the City. The reason I exercised my charter right, and the reason
I have sought additional time before we vote on this matter, is because I wished to learn more about
the company’s community outreach, and I have been reaching out to numerous people that live near
the Cambridge Brands building. Following the October 19th Council meeting, I sent an email to Paula
Yetman, the Plant Manager, as well as to Cambridge Brands attorney Charles Doty, underlining my
concerns and seeking to open a dialogue with them ahead of the next Council meeting.
Interestingly, Mr. Doty shared a little more with me than he intended to when he accidentally
copied me on an email that was meant only for Ms. Yetman and their Cambridge Brands colleagues.
In that email, he said “Good job! [Councilor Simmons] has surrendered and changed the topic in
order to save face. You need to respond with humility and sweetness, telling her that Cambridge
Brands looks forward to working with her and continuing to participate as an active member of the
Cambridge Community and the Main Street neighborhood.” Within an hour of sending that email,
both Ms. Yetman and Mr. Doty realized what had happened and sent me profusely apologetic emails
saying that this email should not have been sent, that no disrespect was intended, and so on.
And while I appreciate the apologies - the email that Mr. Doty had sent to me by accident
reveals that he viewed this discussion as something of a game. And I want to make it clear: I don’t
view these curb cut discussions, or discussions about civic engagement and the role of a responsible
corporate neighbor, as being frivolous. I do not view this as a game. Cambridge Brands has been in
this community for generations, they are looking for expand, and I think that’s wonderful - but I also
want to know how they fit into our community, aside from simply having a physical location here.
Do they feel any ties to the community? Any obligation to recruit locally for employment? Any ties
to our student population? I think those are fair questions, and those are the kinds of points I’ve been
seeking clarity on.
As I told Ms. Yetman in my initial email, I am not trying to prevent this company from

expanding, but I do want to know more about how they view their relationship with the People of
Cambridge. How do they plan to stay engaged with their neighborhood even after they receive this
curb cut, if that comes to pass? I am still interested in having that conversation, and it’s something I
would hope every company operating in this city is continually thinking about. Thank you.

to our student population? I think those are fair questions, and those are the kinds of points I’ve been
seeking clarity on.

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, October 27th, the School Committee held a Roundtable meeting with the principals of
our elementary schools. This is the presentation provided by CPSD and some of the principals
attending. We learned that while that students are greatly benefiting from in-person education,
educators and leadership are struggling with time management and are feeling spread thin due to
staffing challenges. It was important to hear about their successes and challenges and I look forward
to working with them as we move ahead.
On Wednesday, October 28th, the Special Education and Student Supports Subcommittee convened
and heard from OSS leadership as well as special educators. We heard many similar themes—while
educators cited that students are thrilled to be back in a much-needed in-person environment, that
they face insufficient time to effectively plan key efforts or to complete necessary paperwork, such as
lesson planning, attendance logging, IEP documentation, evaluations, and parent engagement
information. Educators continue to express that they are working extremely hard and are stretched
with staff shortages. The OSS team shared that their next steps are to work with caregivers to plan for
expanded hybrid in-person services and aim to get all students with IEPs back in school for the
winter.
This year’s JK/K Lottery info sessions will be Zoom webinars and are scheduled to take place on
Wednesday, November 18th 6:00-7:00 PM and Saturday November 21st 10:00-11:00 AM. Please
find more information here.

CPSD will be submitting its annual enrollment report to the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education in early November. While there may be some minor adjustments between now
and then, the current data shows that there has been an overall enrollment decline of 5.6% (402
students) this school year. This enrollment decline is the first since the 2006-07 school year and ends
13 consecutive years of enrollment growth. Prior to the pandemic, enrollment had been projected to
increase by approximately 2.5%.
On Thursday, October 29th, my School Committee colleagues and I joined a special event with CPS
scholars called “Meet the School Committee”, hosted by our Student Members Anais Killian and
Nuriel Vera-DeGraff. It is important for our community, including our students to understand the
role of the School Committee and for us to be available to answer their questions.
As I mentioned last week, I have been supporting the CRLS #HerVote club’s #HerVote project (in
partnership with the Radcliffe Institute). If you haven’t already, I encourage you all to also download
and print this template, to write your own response, and share it with us on Twitter and Instagram
with the hashtag #HerVote in this very last stretch before the November 3rd election.
We had a great turnout at our last Family Resource Fair on Saturday, October 24th on the Cambridge
Public Library lawn. We are planning to hold one more Fair in November—stay tuned for more
information.
Finally, I am excited to announce that Elevate Youth, the WorkForce Program, and my Office are
extending the Local Parks Program for another 3 weeks through November 18th. Due to daylight
savings, programming will run from 2:30-4:30 PM (instead of 3:30-5:30 PM) on Mondays and
Wednesdays at Danehy Park. If you have or know of a 4th or 5th grader who would benefit from
social and emotional learning activities centered around structured time in the outdoors, please have
them submit an application ASAP. We still have spots!
Our upcoming meetings are as follows:
• Friday, October 30th, 2020
o Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee Meeting | 11:00 AM
▪ Discussing the latest trends in the metrics
•

TENTATIVE Tuesday, November 10th, 2020

Massachusetts Housing Coalition Pledge

Encouraging Tenant & Property Owner Dialogue to Diminish
Housing Effects of COVID-19 Crisis
We, the undersigned property owners, in the spirit of ensuring the continued safety of
residents and lessening the impact of the advancing COVID-19 pandemic, are united in pledging
our support for an open, mutually beneficial dialogue with tenants suffering financial hardship.
We agree that legal proceedings against tenants in arrearage should be considered only a last
resort where the parties fail to productively resolve prevailing issues. We understand that
increased vacancies do not benefit tenants, property owners, public health, or the local
economy, and recognize that the current public health crisis necessitates collaborative
resolutions.
Further, we agree that we will, to the largest extent possible, seek open, fair discourse
regarding past and/or overdue rent in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable, mutually
beneficial outcome that preserves residents’ ability to remain in their home while minimizing
the economic impacts experienced by tenants and property owners.
