Hearings
Councillor Carlone explained that the purpose of ordinance is to codify how the city treats individuals from other
countries. He stated that other communities have adopted similar ordinances. Councillor Carlone distributed a
document from the police department with edits of the proposed ordinance for discussion.
Laura Rotolo, staff counsel from the ACLU, stated that she did not oppose the amendments proposed by the police
department. She raised concerns with amendments in section 2 paragraph E of the police department document.
Attorney Rotolo did not oppose sharing information with agencies other than ICE.
City Solicitor stated that City staff has not had an opportunity to review the proposed language so she has asked the
council not take any formal action until the staff can review the language and report back to the committee.
Attorney Rotolo stated she is supportive of adding some language clarifying that the police will continue to support
the federal government's anti-human trafficking operations.
Attorney Rotolo recommended that the Council not delete the section titled "Encountering persons driving without a
license".
Attorney Rotolo asked that the Committee get clarification about the police department's concerns about the section
entitled "Notice to individuals subject to ICE intervention".
Vice Mayor Devereux asked about the comment on the police department document which reads "seems like a
better policy than ordinance".
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, stated that council should be careful when limiting a police officers discretion to
enforce laws. She also noticed that there were sections that would apply to the School Department and she would
like to have the School Department review the ordinance.
Councillor Siddiqui spoke in support of needing more input from City staff.
In response to question from Councillor Mallon, Solicitor Glowa stated that an ordinance would be mandatory. She
stated that a policy is less enforceable than an ordinance.
Councillor Mallon stated that she wanted immigrants to feel safe in Cambridge.
Councillor Carlone stated that police officers will continue to have discretion to make arrests where appropriate.
William Durbin, Chief of Staff for the Mayor, stated that council should review sections 3 and 4. The Mayor felt it
would be more appropriate to have these complaints and reports sent to the city manager.
Councillor Zondervan spoke in support of the ordinance. He explained how his family was served a deportation
notice and the toll that it took on his family. He stated that this language should be an ordinance instead of a policy.
He did not want to wait to send this language forward to the Council.
