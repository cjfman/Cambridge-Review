VOLPE DESIGN GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE
ɵ

Create rich and varied, humanly scaled building with continuous ground level pedestrian realm

ɵ

Create strong streetwalls to frame streets, parks, squares, and plazas

ɵ

Mitigate building bulk to minimize adverse impacts on the microclimate, including shadows, wind, and urban heat island effects

ɵ

Make positive contributions to the Cambridge skyline and important views

ɵ

Look for opportunities to enrich urban pattern by breaking or modulating it by responding to elements of adjoining buildings, spatial
axes, views, significant corners, etc., or to elements of the building’s own structure or program

ɵ

Differentiate massing and materials, color, fenestration, bay patterns, etc.

ɵ

Design four integrated zones: pedestrian frontage zone, streetwall, tower, and building top

Pedestrian Frontage Zone
ɵ

Accommodate access needs of all users, and incorporate ’visitability’ measures where possible

ɵ

Ground floor level flush with or easily accessible from sidewalks and readily convertible to retail storefronts

ɵ

Break up the scale of the pedestrian frontage zone, create variation in façade treatment at an intimate scale, distinguish from
streetwall & tower

ɵ

Second-floor façade should be visually connected with ground floor façade, differentiated from Streetwall Zone above by its design,
or serve as a mediating element linking the ground floor and the streetwall zone

ɵ

Building facades should maximize the visibility of ground floors containing retail, restaurant, and limited office space

ɵ

Where appropriate, retail awnings should be provided to offer an active, vital marketplace image, while protecting pedestrians

Communication: Broad Canal_20210504 (Public Hearings)

Built Form

41
Packet Pg. 42

VOLPE DESIGN GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE
ɵ

Streetwall facades should use rhythmic patterns, carefully considered bay dimensions,detail, proportion, color, materials, and other
architectural elements to create a coherent and visually rich pedestrian experience

ɵ

The streetwall should be warm and inviting, and should include a variety of materials

Building Towers
ɵ

Articulate tall buildings to avoid a monolithic appearance, and emphasize slender, vertically-oriented proportions. Changes in plane,
material, fenestration pattern, color, etc. may be used to break up the bulk of building towers. Consider:
–

Emphasizing corners using taller elements such as towers, turrets, and bays.

–

Using at least two distinct finish materials and colors on each building.

–

Variation in forms to present different profiles to different vantage points.

Building Tops
ɵ

The penthouse design and materials should be of equivalent quality to the rest of the building and enhance the overall building
design.

ɵ

All mechanical penthouses and other projections should be architecturally integrated within the overall form and individual
elevations of the building. The penthouse should enhance, not detract from, the overall building appearance and balance.

Communication: Broad Canal_20210504 (Public Hearings)

Streetwall Zone

42
Packet Pg. 43

VOLPE DESIGN GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE
ɵ

Pedestrian frontages should align on the build-to line, with exceptions for recessed retail or other entrances and shopfronts.

ɵ

Streetwalls should align to the build-to line for 80% or more of the façade width.

ɵ

A taller streetwall may be appropriate on Broadway and Third Street and on wide streets

ɵ

In some cases, the direct extension of the tower’s verticality through the streetwall to the ground plane may enhance the sense of
place by creating a point of strong vertical emphasis.

ɵ

Reinforce distinction between building’s streetwall and tower by the use of contrasting strategies of homogeneity and heterogeneity.
Vary the design, scale, color, materials, massing, fenestration, etc. across the width of the streetwall or tower as vertical zones.

ɵ

Floorplates of the upper portions of tall buildings should be limited to create slender towers... Adequate separation should be
maintained between tall buildings above the streetwall to allow for views of the sky.

Community Spaces
ɵ

Community spaces should have their own distinct visual identities. Their main entrances should be directly accessible from streets
and other public open spaces.

Energy Performance and Embodied Energy
ɵ

Avoid excessive use of glass both for its poor thermal performance and high embodied energy.

ɵ

Incorporate passive design strategies such as building orientation, external shading, operable windows, and other approaches for
natural ventilation/cooling.

ɵ

Maximize the thermal performance of building envelopes, such as use of thermal mass, high performance insulation, etc.

ɵ

Design roofs to be “solar ready,” employ green roofs where possible, otherwise use high-albedo “white roofs”.
