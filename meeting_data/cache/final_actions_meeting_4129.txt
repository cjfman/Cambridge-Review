Attachment: June 2022_AFCOST_Human Services

Where Did All the Afterschool Staff Go?

“In the new Afterschool in the Time of COVID-19
survey, conducted by Edge Research between Nov.
1 and Dec. 13, 2021, prior to the Omicron variant
sweeping across the United States, the top two
concerns among afterschool providers are:
● finding staff to hire or staffing shortages,
and
● maintaining staff levels through health
concerns and safety protocols.”

OST Expansion Study Update
In order for Cambridge to provide additional afterschool programming, we must work as a
collective to determine a path forward. This process will require system-level work between all of
the OST stakeholders: OST providers, families/caregivers, Cambridge Public Schools and DHSP.
The Agenda for Children Out of School Time Initiative is the organizing body for the Cambridge
OST collective. They will lead this effort over the next fiscal year. As key partners, we will work
closely with them to map out a process to examine OST expansion opportunities for Cambridge.
The effort will require: 1) a capacity study to determine what opportunities currently exist and
where there may be room for growth and expansion 2) input and feedback from families and
caregivers about their needs for afterschool and any barriers to access and equity 3) examination
of the needs of the workforce, including pay equity, benefits, professional development and
access to career ladders 5) costs to provide quality programs and tuition and subsidies across the
