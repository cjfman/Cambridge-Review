Housing as an MIT Priority

Undergraduate Housing
Approximately 97% live in
MIT-affiliated housing

Graduate Housing
Currently houses 34% of its overall population – 3x the rate of other Boston area institutions
With the beds added through the Volpe commitment, that will increase to approximately half of graduate students
