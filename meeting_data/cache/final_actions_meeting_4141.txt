City staff have engaged the public
during MBTA service planning efforts
Our strategy has been to “canvass” the
community – attempting to meet people where
they are, as best as we can. This means:
• Flyers at bus stops
• “Popping up” at bus stops or city facilities with
information and ways to provide feedback
We have used this engagement strategy for the:
• Better Bus Project (2017-2018)
• Bus Network Redesign (Currently)
Packet Pg. 6

Previously, we heard that better buses look more
reliable, frequent and connect the city better
Run more frequent bus service, especially during rush hour
• Interest in more service on weekends, midday, and late evening

Improve bus reliability
• Interest in bus lanes and MBTA dispatching

Add new service in growing + underserved neighborhoods
Implement more “one-seat” rides between neighborhood centers
• Pair routes that can be easily connected at transfer points (Harvard)

Enhance directness of routing, access, and usability.
• Simplify + reroute to improve directness and access.

Overall comments

Route specific comments

“I think increasing service would be
very helpful, but I also don’t want
to lose some bus routes that stop
by my apartment.”

“Finally, a route between
Lechmere and Kendall!”

“Focusing on more high frequency
bus routes is great, the once an
hour buses are hard to use outside
of commuting.”
“Rationale for redesign of routes
isn’t clear.”

Attachment: CDDpresentation (COF 2022 #83 : A communication was received from

People have already shared some specific
feedback on the proposal

Why is the 83 being” diverted
from Central to Kendall?”
“Eliminating the 80, 87, and 88
lines is a big mistake.”

“Frequency is being reduced for
Concord Ave.”

City staff are encouraged that the proposal
includes
A commitment to add significant new bus service
Five new high-frequency routes in Cambridge, among them:
• Kendall to Lechmere, Charlestown, East Somerville, Medford
• Central to Longwood Medical Area, Jamaica Plain
• Kendall and Central to Watertown and Waltham
Adds more service in Central Square while reducing need for
buses to wait (layover) in the neighborhood
Further commitments to work on dedicated bus lanes and transit
signal priority

City staff have concerns about
Reduced service on Concord Avenue in the Alewife Quadrangle
• Where a significant amount of affordable residential
development has recently been constructed
• We expect more residential and commercial development in the
near term
Reduction of service on Broadway, proposed to be peak only
Elimination of all routes from East Cambridge to Somerville
Change of Route 83 from Central to Kendall

Attachment: CDDpresentation (COF 2022 #83 : A communication was received from

City staff have the following suggestions
Communications
• Make the rationale clear for each new route or route
modification
• Show when service is being moved to a different street,
reduced, or eliminated
Engagement
• Continue to canvass in communities to provide information and
answer questions
• Canvassing at bus stops rather than inside subway stations
Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: CDDpresentation (COF 2022 #83 : A communication was received from

a

City staff have the following suggestions
Bus routes
• No service reductions overall - continue level of service on
Broadway and Concord Avenue
• Expect minor changes to routes between East Cambridge and
Somerville and new routes in Somerville that connect destinations
directly to new Green Line stations

• More bus service to the Alewife Quadrangle than today to
support new transit-oriented development
• Route 83 should continue to begin and end in Central Square to
connect residents to civic facilities and human service programs
Packet Pg. 17

Attachment: CDDpresentation (COF 2022 #83 : A communication was received from

a

City staff have the following suggestions
Bus routes
• Provide a direct route between Kendall and Chelsea
• Strong desire from Kendall-area employers to have reliable bus service
for workers coming from Chelsea

• Consider serving Kenmore rather than Hynes on new Route 55
• The most congested section of the Green Line is often Hynes to
Kenmore
• Hynes is not currently an accessible station

Bus Network Redesign
June 28, 2022
Melissa Dullea
Adam Kamoune

Packet Pg. 20

A complete re-imagining of the MBTA’s
bus network to better reflect the travel
needs of the region and create a better
experience for current and future bus
riders.

Why are we doing this?
The region has changed.

But our bus network has not
changed with it.
Transit is essential to the
region’s economy. And the bus
serves our most transitdependent populations.

So it’s essential that our bus
network adapts to change.

What is Bus Network Redesign?

a

The Redesign is coordinated with other
initiatives to maximize benefit to riders

Attachment: MBTApresentation (COF 2022 #84 : presentation

a

Packet Pg. 22 3

Municipal partnerships are key to success
To increase service in congested corridors
we need effective transit priority.

In some cases, transit priority is critical for
implementation. For example, transit priority will
be necessary in the Longwood Medical Area to
ensure a positive rider experience.

Increased service will also require new
and expanded layover locations.
We will need bus shelters and accessible
bus stops in new locations.
We will need new and upgraded
garages to operate this service.

We’ve listened to our riders
WE HEARD THAT GREAT BUS SERVICE:

Goes where people want to
travel, when they need it

Is fast, frequent, and
reliable

Is simple to use and
understand

Serves the people who
need it the most

Packet Pg. 24 5

What we are trying to do
1

Equity first*, prioritizing the needs of those who depend
on buses and need frequent, reliable service

2

More frequent service in busy neighborhoods

3

More all-day service

4

New connections to more places
(including non-downtown centers)

5

A network that’s simpler and easier to use

*Equity is defined as improving access and quality of service for transit-critical populations
(low-income populations, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities, or people who live in households with few or no vehicles)

●

15 corridors → 30 corridors

●

Today, only 27% of weekday service
is frequent – in this plan it’s 50%.

●

Today Everett, Lynn, Medford,
Somerville, South Boston, and West
Roxbury have no all-day high
frequency routes – now they would.

●

Today LMA has only 2 frequent
routes – now it would have 6. Seaport
and Kendall also get new frequent
service.

●

We are focusing on frequent bus
service on corridors and connections
that are not served by rapid transit

Packet Pg. 27 8

We are creating better connections to more places
We are improving access to the top regional destinations with fast, frequent service*

Destination

# of residents in MBTA service
area that gain access to fast
and frequent service to destination

Longwood Medical Area

200,000+

South Boston Waterfront

180,000+

Back Bay

50,000+

Kendall Square

58,000+

*Fast and frequent service is defined by trips have a transit option that is competitive with driving options.
Competitiveness is defined by have a fast trip that minimizes walk distance, transfers, and wait time.

Better access to major destinations.
Proposed

13K
More residents with faster,
frequent service to
Longwood Medical Area

Attachment: MBTApresentation (COF 2022 #84 : presentation

More high-frequency service.

Better service and connections to the places you
want to go: Sullivan Square, Charlestown, Everett,
Allston, Mission Hill, Somerville, Longwood Medical
Area, and more.

Packet Pg. 29

Fundamentally, this is a better network for the
people who ride the MBTA
“Chelsea and Everett are neighboring towns and I
think there should be a more efficient bus route to
connect both towns. The towns are very close
together and it shouldn’t take an hour bus ride to
get from one town to the other.” Chelsea resident

“The frequency for the bus
is really far apart, especially
on the weekends.”
Quincy resident

“I want the MBTA to improve
frequent service throughout the
day, not just rush hours.”
Hyde Park resident

“I use public transport every day for
going to the doctors, grocery
shopping, airport, train station,
Brighton, downtown across the river,
Somerville.” Roxbury resident
