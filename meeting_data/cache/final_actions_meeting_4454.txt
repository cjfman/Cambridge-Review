To the Honorable, the City Council:
Cambridge is an amazing city and I’m so grateful to the Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilors for this
opportunity to serve. This is the community that has shaped my life, cares for my three children, and
aspires to be a shining light for other cities and towns around the country. We are a vibrant, diverse, and
beautiful city and I hope to reflect our best aspirations and abilities.
The City Manager Performance Review is a new process, reflective of the greater accountability,
transparency, and feedback I have enthusiastically supported– especially for myself! Over the last year, I
have experienced the weight this job carries. Our operational responsibilities cover everything from sewer
infrastructure to after-school programs for children, and we are continuously holding conversations with
the Council and our community about important, complex, and often contentious topics including housing
affordability, building height and density, bike lanes, climate change, racial and economic justice, police
reform, and much more.
Our city today runs with significant shared governance and transparency. By the end of 2023, we will
have held 38 City Council meetings with public comment on every facet of city government. While the
legal requirement is only that agendas are posted in advance, we post all discussion materials 48 hours
before Council meetings to encourage more informed and open discussions. These debates aren’t always
easy, but there is a beauty to the working of democracy in our city – a search for political consensus and a
hope that a professional city staff can help inform and guide us to better answers.
I recognize that the City Manager, as the City’s chief executive, holds tremendous power and
responsibility. This performance review process is an important part of accountability. I began working
with the Council on this shortly after I started. We held a Government Operations Committee meeting on
November 22, 2022 to review a draft performance review process, reviewed goals at a Special City
Council meeting on February 16, 2023, approved goals and the final process at City Council on February
27, 2023 and conducted a mid-year check-in with the City Manager Evaluation Sub-Committee on June
22, 2023. This next step, submitting a review of goals and performance by November 15, 2023 will be
followed by the City Council’s formal evaluation delivered at a Special City Council Meeting by
December 20, 2023. I’m looking forward to the conversation and feedback.
Thank you to the City Council for this privilege and to our community for their trust.
Very truly yours,

Yi-An Huang
City Manager

Summary of Goal Performance
The following goals were approved at the February 27, 2023 City Council meeting. This was my first
year in the role and therefore goals were more focused on organizational and management transitions. We
recognized that over time, we would like to move toward more measurable metrics. We also set goals
recognizing that they should be both achievable and ambitious. I have used as a rule of thumb that goals
should have an ~80% chance of success.
Strengthening HR has been a major area of focus and I’m thrilled that Rae Catchings, our new Chief
People Officer, joined the City in June. A number of the goals not fully met fall within the HR area, and
this represents both the longer-than-expected lead time to fill the position and a re-prioritization of work
as Rae onboarded and provided me with recommendations informed by her experience and expertise. I
hope that we can continue to set concrete and ambitious goals, while also recognizing that there is value
in building in some flexibility for learning and adaption.

We are on track to meet both goals in the leadership category. Our Universal Pre-Kindergarten program
has been a long-standing City Council priority and will offer all four-year olds and prioritized three-year
olds a high-quality early education. This is the largest FY24 financial commitment to new City
programming and has required significant coordination between the City and Cambridge Public Schools.
I’m grateful for the leadership of Superintendent Victoria Greer and her team, as well as Lisa Grant, the
Executive Director of the City’s Office of Early Childhood (OEC). Lisa has brought best practices from
around the country into our program design and incorporated an equity lens into key decisions. We will
be ready for families to apply from December 1, 2023 to January 15, 2024 with classes beginning in
September 2024.
This has been a heavy year with the shooting and death of Arif Sayed Faisal on January 4. Over the
following days and weeks, I was in frequent conversation with the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and City
Councilors. Police Commissioner Christine Elow and I represented the City at a four-hour community
meeting on January 12 and we met with the Council over more than six hours of public meetings on
January 18 and January 25 to review our police department’s training, policies, and practices. Out of these
discussions, we proposed a set of concrete actions to implement. On October 5, the District Attorney’s
inquest process concluded, and a final report was issued along with transcripts, videos, and documents
from four days of court proceedings across 29 witnesses and 53 exhibits. The court determined that
Officer Liam McMahon’s action was not criminal and the District Attorney decided that charges would
not be pursued.
This tragedy calls for continued commitment and the many actions we set out are on-track. We are
negotiating with the police union and planning for the implementation of body cameras and a new policy
to quickly release information following fatal police encounters. We have implemented improvements to
our less lethal options and continue to explore additional tools, training, and policies. A procedural justice
dashboard has been rolled out and we have brought in the Center for Policing Equity to analyze our data
and provide recommendations. We have also hired 11 people into our Community Safety Department
including two social work clinicians and six crisis responders who are in training and will begin providing
a civilian response to emergency calls starting in 2024. Finally, we continue to work with the Police
Executive Research Forum, an independent consultant, to review this event and seek out improvements in
our policies and practices.
Over this year, I have tried to communicate transparently and clearly with the Council and community,
and to act urgently in response to this tragedy. This has been the hardest work of my professional life and
I hope that out of this heart-breaking tragedy, we will find meaningful changes to how we respond to
these dangerous, complex events. I’m also so grateful for the leadership and partnership of Police
Commissioner Christine Elow who has brought steadfast empathy, professionalism, and dedication to our
community.

The City and the Council have also taken significant actions across several of our major challenges. On
climate change, we have passed an amendment to the Building Energy Use and Disclosure Ordinance
(BEUDO) to set a 2035 net zero goal for large commercial buildings, approved participation in the state’s
Fossil Fuel Free pilot program, launched Electrify Cambridge, a new program to provide no-cost
technical consults to residents on clean and green home energy upgrades, and rolled out accommodations
for EV charging across sidewalks. On economic development, we have re-zoned the Alewife quadrangle
after a robust and comprehensive community process. This re-zoning will help revitalize the
neighborhood with improved infrastructure like a bike/pedestrian bridge, greater open space, and
approximately 3,500 new housing units, including 700 affordable units. In all this work, City leaders have
played critical roles in working with the Council and I’m proud of our collective leadership in getting
important work done for our community in a way that has brought people together and honored our
shared values and goals.
Finally, I have worked to build a greater presence for Cambridge in regional conversations. Over the last
year, I have participated actively in Metropolitan Mayors, a coalition of the 16 cities and towns that form
the urban core of Metro Boston. I’ve held meetings and visited with municipal leaders in Boston,
Somerville, Watertown, Newton, Brookline, Malden, Melrose, Everett, Revere, and Chelsea. Recently, I
testified together with Mayor Michelle Wu in Boston and Mayor Katjana Ballantyne in Somerville at the
State Legislature Joint Committee on Revenue to push for approval of a local real estate transfer fee
option which the City Council passed 9-0, first on March 16, 2020 and again this year on March 20, 2023.
I have also been in touch with state leaders in the Healey Administration and had discussions with
Secretary Kate Walsh at Health and Human Services, Secretary Ed Augustus at Housing and Livable
Communities, Secretary Yvonne Hao at Economic Development, DCR Commissioner Brian Arrigo, and
MBTA General Manager Philip Eng. Many of our greatest challenges and opportunities are regional and
I’m committed to finding opportunities for Cambridge to be a key player as we seek to address
homelessness, affordable housing, transportation, climate change, and economic opportunity.

We are on track to implement the City Manager performance review process for 2023. I recognize that
this is the first time we have gone through this together and expect that we will learn and find
improvements for 2024. My hope is that we will establish an effective template and process that will
endure and provide our community with accountability, transparency, and feedback for the City’s
executive branch.
My original intention was to work with the Council over the summer to plan for how the new term would
kick-off with Council-City goal setting in January 2024. I ultimately decided it would be more
appropriate to begin these conversations with the Council-elect following the election. We have begun
preparing for this, including contracting with a facilitator for a Council-only training and a Council-City
training to begin building effective working relationships, setting norms, and developing a plan for shared
goal setting and prioritization.
I have grown in appreciation for the relationship between the Council and the City. I have spoken often of
shared governance and I believe this best describes our form of government. Political direction is set by
the Council and it is the City’s job to bring data, analysis, and recommendations to the Council. The City

is responsible for implementation and day-to-day operations and this provides us with a unique
perspective on feasibility, constraints, and timing. This relationship is healthy when there is
communication, collaboration, respect, and trust and I have worked hard on each of these fronts with the
Council.

Hiring for key senior leadership positions has been an important priority and we have filled a number of
critical roles since I started. This has included Owen O’Riordan as Deputy City Manager, Kathy Watkins
as Commissioner of Public Works, Rebecca Fuentes as Deputy Chief Operating Officer, Brooke
McKenna as Transportation Commissioner, Tom Cahill as Acting Fire Chief, B. Kimmerman as Chief of
Staff, Deidre Travis Brown as Chief of Equity and Inclusion, and Rae Catchings as Chief People Officer.
I’ve brought on Jane Licurse as Strategy Advisor and she has built a strategy team within the Executive
Office which has supported key projects. I therefore do not plan to fill the Chief of Strategy and
Implementation role. The Director of Emergency Management role continues to be an important job,
though we have prioritized recruiting for other positions. This role will fit into the Deputy City Manager’s
organization and we expect to post the job in 2024.
Within the City Manager’s Officer, I have announced Matt Nelson as Director of Administration and
Operations and he has been invaluable in coordinating Council meetings, agendas, major City events like
the Dance Party and Danehy Park Family Day, and constituent services. I’ve also hired Dominic Warren
as my Executive Assistant, and I’ve been grateful for both Stacey Cooper and Francesca Gaines who have
been vital parts of my onboarding and continue to do a fantastic job keeping the Executive Office running
smoothly and helping residents navigate City services.
This year has also seen significant retirements: Assistant City Manager of Fiscal Affairs David Kale and
City Solicitor Nancy Glowa. I’ve been grateful for their leadership, many years of service, and especially,
their kindness and support for me over the last year, bringing me up to speed on City affairs. They each
have so much to be proud of, including the strong and capable leaders they have developed in their
respective departments and a track record of dedicated and excellent service to our community. I’ve
appreciated Michele Kincaid and Megan Bayer for taking on acting leadership responsibilities. We have
run a rigorous process for the Assistant City Manager of Fiscal Affairs, and I was excited to recently
announce the hiring of Claire Spinner, who has been the Chief Financial OFficer at Cambridge Public
Schools, and she will start in early January.
Creating a clearer organizational structure has been a key priority. I’ve formalized the Deputy City
Manager’s role as the Chief Operating Officer for the City and consolidated major operational
departments within that portfolio. I’ve also organized key equity and inclusion departments together
under the new Office of Equity and Inclusion and I believe this will create greater coordination, visibility,
and connection for these teams. My ultimate vision is for all departments to have clear reporting, regular

check-ins with their manager, and a strong connection to senior leadership both for organizational
guidance and support.

Creating meeting structure has also been an important area of work. I established a regular leadership
team meeting to organize major initiatives, align on important changes, and receive feedback. This biweekly forum for organizational discussion has shaped key decisions, deepened my understanding of the
City, and strengthened leadership relationships. We have also held quarterly Leadership Together
meetings that include directors and managers across the City to bring together, get feedback from and
train a broader group of leaders.
Goal setting and annual performance reviews are best practices for high performing organizations, and we
are committed to doing this across all our non-union staff and managers. The goal for 2023 has been
partially met. We did not set goals for the leadership team but are conducting formal performance reviews
for senior leaders by the end of this calendar year.
In our current state, annual performance reviews have been implemented in several major departments but
are absent in other smaller departments. There has not been a more centralized coordination of these
efforts and we are committed to both honoring what is working well today but also implementing a
consistent City-wide approach built on best practices. This will be a big change and we will do this work
thoughtfully as we approach a plan for 2024 performance reviews.

A final note is that building more effective digital systems and tools across the City continues to be a
priority. I expect us to have more conversations in 2024 as we develop a plan for prioritizing digital
transformation projects across HR, contracting, procurement, record retention, and resident services.

Community Engagement
Proactively communicate with the community, and create a range of opportunities for all stakeholders
and residents to provide input and feedback, particularly communities whose voices are not typically

One of my early decisions was to create a Director of Community Engagement role. I recognized that our
community engagement work across departments could be more coordinated and consistent, and wanted
to respond to the Council’s desire to strengthen outreach to people less engaged with City Hall.
However, as I interviewed candidates, a couple of dynamics became clear. First, the vision for what
community engagement represents was more complex than I realized. Engaging the community with
human service programs looks different than designing a new park or receiving feedback on a bike lane.
Second, I hadn’t articulated how this role would interact with our existing community engagement staff
and departments heads. And finally, I hadn’t done much work to build buy-in across the organization. I
ultimately concluded that none of the candidates were going to be set up to succeed, and it was important
to pause.
Instead of the top-down approach of hiring a new leader who would have to define the role as a first task,
I decided on a more inclusive, bottoms-up process that brought together our existing community
engagement leaders and staff. We held more than ten meetings to understand the history of community
engagement in the City, our current state, what is working well, pain points, and action steps for
improvement.
We are planning to hire for this role but now with a clearer picture of the work, buy-in from our
community engagement staff and department heads, and a stronger confidence that the position will be
successful. I’m looking forward to sharing a fuller update at the upcoming November 20 City Council
meeting. I believe this process reflects the values that I want to instill in the City – a willingness to make
adjustments, pause and start over if something isn’t working, and commit to more inclusive and shared
decision-making.
I have also made it a priority to hold more resident meet and greet events to hear directly from our
community. I have exceeded the goal of having nine events and I have held 12 events from December
2022 through November 2023. This has included events open to all members of the public as well as
more targeted outreach to segments of our community such as seniors, non-profit leaders, neighborhood
associations, students, the disability community, and faith leaders. I’ve been so grateful for feedback
during these times and I’m looking forward to continuing to do this going forward.
Finally, one of my goals was to maintain a high score on our 2023 resident survey for the overall
performance of City government. We have met this goal, achieving a 69% Excellent/Good rating for 2023
compared to 64% in 2022, 66% in 2020, and 63% in 2018. This year, we experimented with adding
several new questions and obtained benchmark data so that we could compare our results to other

meeting and I’m looking forward to a fuller conversation about this important tool for incorporating
greater representative data and resident feedback.

Our new Chief People Officer, Rae Catchings, started in June and there have been several short-term
priorities including moving the department to 689 Massachusetts Ave to create more space, filling key
vacant positions, and addressing core HR operations. Rae has also been a critical partner on a number of
goals, including the City Manager performance review process, hiring key leadership positions, senior
leadership performance reviews, and telework 2.0.
Implementing an annual employee engagement and satisfaction survey remains an important priority, but
it was not one that we were able to meet for this year. We reviewed options including utilizing existing
state contracts, but ultimately decided that we could implement a higher-quality baseline if we moved this
work to 2024.
While measuring our employee engagement and satisfaction will happen next year, our efforts to
strengthen the City’s culture and support staff have continued. I have met the goal of conducting nine City
staff meet and greets. From December 2022 to November 2023, I have held 13 events for employees. This
has brought me across the City to all our major departments and included open Q&A and time to get to
know staff and hear their concerns. One of the key desires I heard when I started was that staff wanted
greater connection to leadership. I have tried to communicate more frequently and have sent 20 All Staff
emails over the last year to announce important changes, process major events, and celebrate important
dates.
In my first 90-day report, I talked about moving toward a culture of focusing on the right answer, setting
realistic goals and delivering on them, asking for resources and elevating risks, believing in possibility,
and valuing work/life balance. These continue to be important themes and reflect my desire to make an
impact and act urgently.
However, over the last year, I have also recognized the need to emphasize creating a healthy and safe
culture that is welcoming of feedback and treats everyone with mutual trust and dignity. Recently, Rae
Catchings, our Chief People Officer, and Deidre Travis Brown, our Chief of Equity and Inclusion sent a
joint message to All Staff to reiterate this commitment. I’m looking forward to partnering and supporting
them in these efforts.

Advance anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts across the City, including strategy,
organizational culture, HR, policy development, and service delivery.
Goal

Status

Create an equity and inclusion framework and updated goals and workstreams that increase
equity, access, and inclusion for City staff and community

MET

The City has made significant investments in anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion. We have
signaled the values that are important to us and devoted resources to seminars, trainings, and major
initiatives focused on revamping policies and procedures from an equity lens.
Over the last year, I’ve sought to recommit ourselves to this work. I created a new senior leadership
position and Deidre Travis Brown is our first Chief of Equity and Inclusion. She assessed our existing
efforts in early 2023 and we added budget for new positions within her team for FY24 that she is now
hiring for. We have also established stronger working groups with HR to collaborate on strengthening
existing policies, developing employee resource groups, and better addressing staff complaints and
grievances. I’m excited about the work that has been done to create an equity and inclusion framework,
updated goals, and workstreams and these will be presented at the November 20 City Council meeting.
Deidre has also led us toward a more inclusive planning process for employee events. We invited people
from across the organization to lead the planning for Hispanic Heritage month and had 13 diverse staff
design the event. This included food from three Hispanic and Latinx-owned restaurants, music and
dancing by one of our amazing local artists, Fabiola Mendez, a showcase of employee stories on how they
celebrate their heritage, and a trivia quiz. Participation in these events has increased and our recent
Disability Inclusion Panel Discussion had 84 people in attendance.
Finally, we have also sought to create space within the organization to process difficult events. We held
an employee forum at the main library on April 6 with in-person and virtual attendance to discuss the fatal
police shooting of Arif Sayed Faisal with myself and the Police Commissioner. This was a difficult and
raw conversation but also an important opportunity for City staff to ask questions and bring their
perspectives forward, understand how we are approaching this tragedy, and see the actions we are taking.
We also held a follow-up employee forum on October 26 to discuss the inquest report and update our staff
on next steps and how we are seeking healing within our community. We had about 100 staff attend each
of these events.
We have a beautifully diverse community and as a City organization, we are committed to both reflect
that diversity and more openly engage with how we create an anti-racist, equitable, and inclusive culture.
This is a journey that is uncomfortable at times, but I hope will lead us to a stronger and most just
community, better and more equitable decisions, and greater trust among those who have not historically
been represented.

I have been thrilled to have Owen O’Riordan, our long-time Commissioner of Public Works, step into the
role of Deputy City Manager and he has been a steady hand in keeping the day-to-day operations of our
city running. We have met the goal of hiring new department heads including Kathy Watkins as
Commissioner of Public Works, Peter McLaughlin as Commissioner of Inspectional Services, Mark
Gallagher as Acting Managing Director of the Water Department, and Brooke McKenna as
Transportation Commissioner.
The City is a complex technical and operational entity, and I have appreciated Owen’s deep experience on
several fronts. He led us through a switchover to MWRA water and installation of new filter material in
the Water department following a spike in PFAS readings in Summer 2022; implemented major changes
to our Electrical department including a significant budget increase to address repairs and replacement of
electrical infrastructure across the city; and reorganized staff to form a new Capital and Facilities
Planning department which will both improve our ability to properly maintain our municipal buildings
and support major decarbonization efforts in the coming years. These efforts have shown his ability to
manage through crises, proactively reduce risk, and establish foundational capabilities for our future
needs, and I'm thankful for his partnership.
We have partially met our telework goal. Our telework policy was finalized in Summer 2022 and has
provided many City staff with greater flexibility for work-life balance. Over the last three years, we have
learned to both take advantage of remote and virtual work as well as the importance of being together inperson. We are also on track toward revising our telework policy and expect this to be complete in
December. The staff survey component of this goal will be included as part of the scope of the annual
employee engagement and satisfaction survey to be conducted in 2024.
Finally, I’m proud of the work we have done with the Council to purchase new municipal lots. It has been
a long-standing Council priority for the City to acquire more land. These new plots present opportunities
for addressing our affordable housing crisis and providing sufficient space for critical Public Works
operations. I’ve been grateful for Owen’s leadership as well as the work of our Law and Finance teams to
guide us through these complex acquisitions which will help us meet our shared goals.

The City’s FY24 Budget was submitted on May 1, discussed during public hearings with the City Council
on May 9, May 16, and May 18, and adopted on June 5. This year, the City adjusted the process to
increase transparency and engagement with the Council and we met our goal of providing greater Council
input in the budget process.
The City worked closely with the Finance Committee Co-Chairs and held public hearings prior to budget
submission. The proposed budget reflected the Council’s goals and priorities, and we made significant
commitments across affordable housing, homelessness and housing stability, early childhood / universal
pre-kindergarten, climate change and sustainability, and safer streets. I worked closely with the Finance

team to tie our overall spending to these major areas and provided a clear view in the Consolidated
Spending section of the budget presentation.
We also engaged in substantive discussions on the budget and the City Council made formal requests for
budget increases for affordable housing and for the Public Health department. The City worked to meet
these requests and built in additional funding in the final adopted FY24 budget. I believe this
collaborative approach is a good foundation for us to build on and continue.
An area of improvement is to build greater community input to our budget. We already have a robust
Participatory Budget (PB) program and I’m excited about expanding this as we enter our tenth year. We
have announced an increase in the funding available and expanded eligibility to ideas that would require
operational funding. The PB program is an amazing opportunity for residents to shape where City funding
goes, and a chance for people to understand what programs exist across the City and how the budget
process works.
We have also met our goal of maintaining a strong fiscal position and AAA bond rating, which we
achieved from all three major bond rating agencies. A high bond rating is not just a financial advantage
that provides us with lower borrowing costs, but also a sign that our fiscal policies and management are
secure, and that the City will have the financial strength to accomplish our long-term goals.
As we enter 2024 and begin planning for the FY25 budget process, I’m humbled by the strength of our
financial position while also cautious about the overall economic environment. There are several
economic headwinds that we are monitoring including persistently high interest rates, office and retail
vacancies, an oversupply of lab space, struggling public transit options, and high construction costs.
While many of our major indicators were strong in 2022, we have seen slowdowns in 2023 and while we
have significant resources, we will need to prioritize across both our operating and capital budgets given
the number of existing commitments that we have already made. This will be an important discussion
with the Council and I’m looking forward to bringing greater transparency and longer-term planning to
these conversations.

Closing Thoughts
This has been an incredible year of lessons, trials, and joys and while I have grown so much over the last
14 months, I know there continue to be opportunities for feedback and learning.
A final note is that this amazing city is run by an amazing team. I’m so grateful for all the department
heads, directors, managers, supervisors, and staff who show up every day to serve our community. The
passion and dedication that I encounter inspires me and the successes we see are also theirs.
A final thanks to the City Council as we come to the end of this term. You have each brought an
incredible dedication to our community and it shows in every conversation that we have had. I have been
thankful for this opportunity to serve and the opportunity to work together with each of you.
