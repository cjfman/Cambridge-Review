COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR CARLONE
WHEREAS: Cambridge has received more than $88 million in ARPA funding, of which $33 million has
yet to be allocated; and
WHEREAS: The city has received a total of 65 inspiring community proposals from 41 distinct
individuals and organizations totaling more than 188,000,000; and
WHEREAS: In addition to the community submissions, the council and city are considering other
proposals and concepts including (but not limited to) fare free transit and priorities of the Climate Crisis
Working Group; and
WHEREAS: All proposals must be carefully vetted to ensure consistency with the Final Rule issued by
the Department of the Treasury, which took effect April 1, 2022; and
WHEREAS: Some of the community submissions including (but not limited to) Friends of Jerry’s Pond,
Friends of Magazine Beach, BARCC, and HEART will require funding beyond ARPA in order to achieve
their mission, but would benefit greatly from partial funding from ARPA on the order of $500,000 each;
and
WHEREAS: Other community submissions like the Cambridge Community Center and Starlight Square
hinge on substantial construction on city-owned property and would benefit from partial funding from
ARPA to pay for feasibility studies and initial design work; and
WHEREAS: The $20 million Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition proposal would lead to funding for many
deserving nonprofits that didn’t submit a separate proposal of their own, and should receive careful
consideration in addition to the proposed funding in this policy order; and
WHEREAS: The council is strongly supportive of the multiple applicants who have proposed expanding
the number of low-threshold housing stipends and related supportive services, but the details of how that
would work would benefit from discussion in committee; now therefore be it
ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to allocate at least $10,500,000 of the
remaining ARPA funds across each of the following applicants: BARCC, Bay Cove, Cambridge
Community Center, Cambridge Housing Authority, Cambridge/Somerville Health Care for the Homeless,
DeNovo, Food For Free, Friends of Jerry’s Pond, Green Cambridge, HEART, Homeowners Rehab, Inc.,
Joyful Destinations, Just A Start, Magazine Beach Partners, On The Rise, Popportunity Program,
Starlight Square, and Transition House; and be it further
ORDERED: That the Chairs of the Human Services Committee and Housing Committee be and hereby
are requested to hold a joint hearing on the topic of expanding the number of low-threshold housing

Packet Pg. 2

stipends and supportive services, and to invite representatives of the relevant ARPA community
submissions; and be it further
ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on this
matter as soon as possible.

Neville Communities, Inc.-The project is to provide funding for COVID-19 testing and
PPE as the facility has had declining revenues due to loss of patients and decrease in
new residence durin the COVID pandemic stretching their resources thin.
Outdoor dining infrastructure support and grants because the cost is very high and
the city should support infrastructure that not only supports businesses, but also
DPW operations, ADA accessibility, TPT efforts, etc. Offering the grant will allow the
City more control on what is erected.
The hotel/tourism industry in the Greater Boston Area is not expected to recover for
several years to prepandemic levels. Grants to provide daycare and/or training pay
to employees, grants to support small tourism-based businesses and other grants to
support this industry are warranted.
