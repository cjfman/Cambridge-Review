To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $50,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund
Inspectional Services Department Other Ordinary Maintenance Account to provide funds to
implement a pilot of SMART Box and SMART Pipe rodent control technology in the City.
In March, the City Council requested that I work with the Department of Public Works to
introduce the SMART Box rodent control system in Cambridge. Since then, staff in the City
Manager’s Office, Department of Public Works, and Inspectional Services Department have
researched this system, conferred with the City’s Rodent Taskforce, and spoken with a
representative from the City of Somerville about their experience with this technology.
Funds will be used to support a pilot project of both above ground SMART Boxes and SMART
Pipes used in sewers. The pilot of this new technology will be in addition to the City’s ongoing
efforts through our Rodent Taskforce, Private Property Rodent Control Program, investments in
new City-issued trash carts and our curbside compost program, and ongoing outreach and
education through community meetings, resident interactions, and informational handouts as we
continue to do everything we can to mitigate the impacts of rodents on the quality of life of our
residents
It is anticipated that this new technology will help to collect meaningful data and results to allow
us to add another rodent control option to the City’s toolkit. With City Council approval, the
procurement of this technology will happen this spring with deployments of SMART Boxes and
SMART Pipes expected later this spring and summer.
This is also in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 22-12.

Awaiting Report No. 21-69

This memorandum has been prepared in response to Awaiting Report No. 21-69/Policy Order O-3 dated
October 18, 2021, regarding the feasibility of creating a uniform process for aiding the resettlement of
refugees in Cambridge. For reasons explained below, there are external barriers to creating a truly
uniform process by which the City aids refugee resettlement. However, the Commission on Immigrant
Rights and Citizenship (CIRC) will continue its work to assist refugee and/or immigrant residents
resettling in Cambridge in the most consistent and equitable way possible – regardless of their
immigration status, national origin, race, or other characteristics.
“Refugees” may arrive in Cambridge from many different countries, including Afghanistan and Haiti, as
recognized explicitly in the Council Order. Given the tragic recent developments in Eastern Europe, we
may also see additional new arrivals from Ukraine. New residents may also come to Cambridge from
various other countries, or under circumstances, that do not always garner national news attention or
afford them immigration protections. The ability to proactively coordinate around refugees’ arrival and
resettlement in Cambridge differs significantly depending on federal treatment/classification of their
home country.
Only those who meet very specific criteria are eligible for resettlement through the U.S. Refugee
Resettlement Program. This program involves the federal and state governments, partnering with
nonprofit resettlement agencies, and it provides eligibility for a number of benefits. It is feasible to
create a more uniform process to assist individuals and families coming to Cambridge through the
Refugee Resettlement Program, and the Commission will work with appropriate partners to do so.
Those who are not eligible for the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program, though, are unlikely to arrive in
Cambridge through any formalized process. This limits CIRC’s ability to identify individuals resettling in
advance of their arrival. CIRC can, however, work with City and community partners to assist these
individuals more consistently and uniformly after they arrive in Cambridge.
Additional Coordination for Refugee Resettlement Program Arrivals
Many individuals currently arriving from Afghanistan are proceeding through the U.S. Refugee
Resettlement Program. The U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program is open to other eligible populations as
well, but there is a particular focus on coordinating services for Afghan arrivals. To better participate
and aid in this process, CIRC is joining quarterly consultation meetings with the state Office for Refugees
and Immigrants. CIRC is also joining an Afghan/Haitian Benefits Working Group, organized by colleagues
in Boston’s Mayor’s Office for Immigrant Advancement (MOIA). This working group receives regular

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: Uniform Resettlement Process response 4-4-22 (CMA 2022 #64 : Awaiting Report 21-69 response RE: uniform resettlement

1.2.a

updates from the state’s nonprofit Resettlement Agencies, including information on where new arrivals
from Afghanistan will be placed.
Through these connections, CIRC aims to make earlier contact with those coming to Cambridge through
the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program. CIRC can in turn connect new arrivals to key City and
community resources more quickly.
Additional Coordination around all Newly Arrived Refugees and Immigrants
While most Afghan arrivals are proceeding through the federal resettlement process, this is not the case
for many other new arrivals. For example, new arrivals from Haiti are not currently supported through
the federal resettlement process in the same manner as new arrivals from Afghanistan. Additionally,
while persons from Haiti, Afghanistan, Ukraine and additional countries may be eligible for Temporary
Protected Status (TPS), providing them with certain time-limited immigration protections, TPS
designation does not itself establish any sort of resettlement structure. Moreover, individuals who
don’t meet the legal definition of a “refugee”, who may not qualify for asylum or TPS, or whose
immigration status is uncertain will still arrive in Cambridge. And each person or family’s needs will be
unique.
New immigrant residents first connect with the City in many different ways. CIRC staff regularly meets
with other City departments to share information and resources. CIRC has been working to specifically
strengthen connections with other groups that often serve as a point of first contact for immigrant
residents, including the Department of Human Service Programs’ Community Learning Center,
Community Engagement Team, and Multi-Service Center, Cambridge Public Schools’ Family Liaisons, and
the Cambridge Public Libraries. Through these connections, key City staff can share information and
best practices, more effectively refer residents for services, and potentially identify trends.
Additionally, CIRC has developed a New Resident Overview resource. The goal is for this New Resident
Overview to serve as a quick reference for any new arrivals in Cambridge; providing information on key,
Cambridge-specific resources in the service areas most commonly needed by new immigrants. This
resource was developed with direct input from CIRC Commissioners, all of whom are immigrants or
work for immigrant-serving organizations. While this resource will not in and of itself create a more
uniform resettlement process for refugees in Cambridge, it can provide immigrant residents – and other
members of the Cambridge community assisting them – with an overview of resources, and allow CIRC
to make warm referrals for the individual or family’s specific needs.

Re:

Policy Order #9 dated September 13, 2021, regarding addressing food insecurity
by installing raised garden beds throughout Cambridge and providing free,
fresh, locally grown food for residents in need

Introduction
The City of Cambridge is committed to building equitable access to fresh, locally grown
food and to providing opportunities for growing food. The City currently operates two
successful programs – the community garden program and the SNAP Match incentive
program – that are being evaluated for opportunities to increase access to free, locally
grown food, as described below:
Community Garden Program
The Cambridge Conservation Commission operates a Community Garden Program,
supporting 14 community gardens. Plots have historically been assigned to Cambridge
households on a rotating, lottery-based system, with preference for residents who do
not have land on which to garden. Given the desire to expand and diversify access to
community agriculture in Cambridge and to prioritize food insecure families, City staff
are working on a public engagement process with garden coordinators to rewrite the
garden policy (last revised in 2015) to address operations, maintenance, and plot
turnover.
During a focus group session held in October 2021, a set of stakeholders, including
garden coordinators, Green Cambridge, Cambridge City Growers, Poets in the Garden,
and Cambridge Plant and Garden Club, identified the following strategies, among
others, to reduce barriers and increase access to community agriculture:

•
•
•

Constructing temporary raised beds on parking lots and land waiting for
development.
More strongly enforcing a 5-year term limit for garden plots.
Sharing single garden plots among neighbors.
Expanding community agriculture outreach and communication.

Attachment: Food Insecurity response - 4-4-22 (CMA 2022 #67 : Awaiting Report 21-63 RE: food insecurity raised garden beds)

Community Development Department

This focus group also supported the establishment of new food growing spaces based
on the community farm model. Distinct from the conventional community garden
model, within which members are assigned and tend one garden plot, the community
farm model has no limitations to membership and thereby can facilitate access to
gardening and fresh food by more people. This model includes staff oversight and is an
optimal setting to provide training and support for residents new to gardening. As the
City looks at options for expanding the community farm model in Cambridge, it will be
important to prioritize neighborhoods with the greatest need.

It is also recognized that as part of this effort the Inspectional Services Department
(ISD) and the Department of Public Works (DPW) will need to work closely with the
garden coordinators and those others involved in operating these spaces to ensure that
they are adequately resourced to ensure waste is properly dealt with and that they don’t
give rise to an increased level of rodent activity in the surrounding neighborhoods. The
ISD Department works seasonally to inspect the gardens with DPW staff for rodents and
rodent activity. DPW has overseen the installation and maintenance of bait boxes as
well as deploying carbon monoxide treatment. This collaboration will continue annually.
Two examples of the community farm model in Cambridge are sites managed by Green
Cambridge, a nonprofit organization: the Hurley Street Neighborhood Farm and a farm
at Riverside Press Park. Both sites invite collective participation in growing food, run
mostly through volunteer efforts of neighbors and partner organizations. The Hurley
Street farm is also supported by a part-time farm manager. Green Cambridge is actively
working in partnership with the City and developers to expand this model to additional
sites. Cambridge City Growers, a group of residents that formed in 2020, has also
worked to establish garden beds across the city.
Nutritional Incentive Programs
Cambridge has limited land on which to grow food, especially considering competing
land uses and open space needs. Nutritional incentive programs like SNAP Match,
however, provide broad, consistent access to healthy food for a wide range of people.
These programs don’t typically require people to engage in agricultural activities as a
precondition to accessing the benefit, and access is not constrained by the growing
season. Additionally, these programs can more easily be scaled up, by expanding the
locations and partners that administer the benefit or by increasing the incentive
amount. Increasing the SNAP Match benefit available to SNAP-eligible shoppers would
be quick and easy to implement and a straightforward way to expand access to healthy
food.
The Cambridge SNAP Match program doubles the buying power of SNAP-eligible
shoppers at the Central Square Farmers Market, Harvard University Farmers Market,
and the Cambridge Community Center Winter Farmers Market, and the Central Square
Winter Farmers Market. Each SNAP shopper is eligible for up to $15 per visit in matching

benefits at the participating markets, offering $30 in purchases while using only $15 of
their SNAP benefits. Since its inception in 2012, the SNAP Match program has issued
$181,977 dollars in matching funds to SNAP shoppers.
The Central Square Farmers Market, which issues the most in SNAP matching funds of
all participating markets, saw 487 unique SNAP shoppers at the market throughout the
2021 season, an increase from 303 unique SNAP shoppers in 2020. 2021 has seen a
significant increase in SNAP match usage, with an increase of over 43% in the amount of
SNAP match issued compared to 2020. This increase resulted in the highest amount of
match issued in one year to date – $34,049 – which now exceeds the amount of annual
funding made available to the program.
Another nutritional incentive program that Cambridge could consider is the Double Up
Food Bucks program, which provides additional funds to SNAP shoppers when
purchasing fresh fruits or vegetables from a food retailer. Funding for this program is
available through the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP), and
additional funding is required to be contributed by, or on behalf of, an applicant to the
program. Eligible applicants are local governments and non-profit organizations, while
eligible retailers include corner stores, neighborhood markets, grocery stores, mobile
markets, and farmers markets. Double Up Food Bucks is currently available in
Cambridge at The Daily Table, a non-profit organization which applied for this program
independently. Another store, Pemberton Farms, has reached out to the Cambridge
Public Health Department with interest in participating in this program. Double Up Food
Bucks is currently available at nine food retail locations in Boston, and the City of Boston
is actively looking to expand this program to more food retailers. This approach is an
option for Cambridge to consider if required additional funding was available to enable
an application to this program.
Conclusion
The City will continue to work on expanding its Community Garden and nutritional
assistance programs. Of significance, the City will introduce the community farm model
to new areas of Cambridge to expand and diversify access to community agriculture,
and the City will work to identify additional funding for the SNAP Match program to
keep pace with increased demand for affordable, healthy food.

of equipment for use in snow and ice operations.
Funds will be used to purchase a new, large salter that will replace a 13-year-old salter. The
vehicle which will be replaced is the oldest in the fleet and used for every snow and salting event
during the winter season.
Funds will also be used to purchase a new front-end loader which will replace a 20-year-old
loader. The loader is used for plowing and loading road salt into salter trucks as well as for
roadwork and construction services.
In addition, funds will be used to purchase three sidewalk/bike lane tractors which will be
important additions to the fleet. One tractor will replace an older vehicle that is used in every
winter weather event. The other two new tractors are additions the fleet that will allow for the
clearing of up to 5 additional miles of protected bike lanes, which are planned to be installed
prior to the 2022/2023 winter season.
Public Works continues to strive to incorporate more sustainable equipment into our fleet and as
part of this process explored both hybrid and all electric options for these vehicles. Because all
of the requested equipment is used primarily for winter operations, all electric applications are
not viable. While some manufacturers are making strides to offer hybrid options, the current
models and sizes do not work for the vehicles we are requesting. DPW staff will continue to
explore these options for all their vehicle purchases, keeping in mind environmental impacts,
operational and functional needs, and cost effectiveness.

>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you. a quorum of the ordinance committee being present in this meeting in
order to conduct a public hearing on proposed amendments to the building energy use disclosure ordinance
2021-26. pursuant to chapter 20 of the act 2021.by the massachusetts gen. assembly and approved by the
governor. the city have the right to use electronic participation in meetings of the cambridge city council. to
watch the meeting please tune to channel 22 or visit the open meeting for portal on the city's website. today's
meeting will be conducted in a remote format. if you like to provide public comment please go to [listing
names] to sign up for public comment. we will not allow any additional public comments sign-ups after 6 pm.
all those today will be taken by roll call. mr. clerk, please call the roll.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you mr. clerk obviously there is a lot to cover.
on the agenda we are going to hear first from CDD. then we can have some clarifying questions from the
committee. we will then hear from Councillor Nolan with a presentation on the amendments that she wishes to
bring forward. we can have clarifying questions following that presentation. we will then hear from Councillor
Zondervan will present the green new deal amendments. we can ask questions after that. we will go to public
comment. and then if time will go into, we can have more discussion we sort of anticipate this is going to take
certainly more than one meeting to get through. so, this is going to be a process. we certainly will get everything
tonight. so, with that I think we should probably just jump right in and go to CDD. assistant manager.
>> iram farooq, assistant city manager of community development: thank you Councillor McGovern good
evening to the ordinance committee. it was a pleasure to be here. and we're actually really excited to be here to
be talking to you today about amendments to the building energy use disclosure ordinance these are long time in
the making. we've been working on this along with members of the community with the regulated community
as well. starting pre-pandemic and with some hold up over time. so, it's really nice to finally have the
recommendations before the ordinance committee. we firmly believe that adding emissions reductions
requirements to the building energy use disclosure ordinance is one of the most impactful ways to get us to net
zero greenhouse gas emissions as a community. and that is something that has been very much in the forefront
of the team as they worked on framing the recommendations. I note that there are multiple different opinions on
this. we welcome discussion on the various ideas.
but I’m really happy to have the opportunity to talk you about the genesis of the specifics that are in the
proposal that has come out of the work following the net zero action plan. I will say that our presentation which

will be given by the spec is largely the same as the presentation as the health and environment committee in
December.

>> Seth Federspiel, sustainability planner: thank you very much. I will pull up the presentation. those full
screen side coming through for everyone? great. thanks very much for having me this evening. as the assistant
city manager said apologize to those of you from this will be familiar presentation print but I think again it's
helpful way to get everybody on the same page. in terms of where we are with this process. I’m going to move
through this pretty quickly so that we can get to the other presentations and discussion I’m certainly happy to
answer questions as we go. alright so I’m going to briefly discuss the context in the background for the building
energy disclosure ordinance pursuant to current amendments talk about the process and getting to those
amendments.
I will focus most of the presentation on reviewing the content of the amendments themselves as proposed by
CDD and the city manager back in November. so, as we were said the reason we are focused on building and
reducing billing greenhouse gas emissions because buildings play such a large role in our venous gas inventory.
so, in order to be successful in meeting our climate change goals is imperative to reduce emissions from
buildings in Cambridge and when we look at BEUDO building specifically BEUDO applies to commercial
buildings that a larger than 25,000 ft. in residential buildings larger than 50 units. these buildings have quite a
few. never.
sorry about that. but they count for about 60% of the square footage of the city. and the energy use and almost
70% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the building sector. so, 70% of that 80%. they come from buildings. the
reason greenhouse gas emissions are somewhat higher than energy is because of the amount of electricity used
by these buildings which has a slightly higher emissions factor then natural gas.
we mentioned the action plan I went to briefly place this proposal in context of the action plan the update which
was submitted to council a little bit earlier this year. the action plan is a comprehensive plan for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. and while BEUDO plays a very important piece of that. it is not the
only piece.
so, across the action plan which has actions for existing buildings the new buildings and the energy supply. we
have combination proposed requirements such as the country amendments but also a range of incentives and
support in enabling actions. so BEUDO again plays one piece of that. but in order for the net zero action plan to
be successful and to successfully meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals we need to activate all of these
actions together to address the full set of greenhouse gas emissions buildings in Cambridge.
on the BEUDO process, BEUDO was adopted in 2014. included a provision that in 20 team we reviewed the
impact of BEUDO. that review process showed that the energy use of BEUDO buildings remained relatively
stable over the time of the ordinance. this again energy use which is distinct from greenhouse gas emissions or
have gone down slightly for BEUDO buildings. largely due to improvements in electricity degrades but
certainly this trend is not satisfying the significant improvement in energy performance called for by the
ordinance. so, this trigger then our process to consider what amendments the ordinance would look like.
so, to briefly review that process a process again in 2017 so we been working on it for number of years. in that
process centered largely around consultation with the actual BEUDO property owners to really understand with
them what the considerations are for improving energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions from those
buildings and to work towards developing a proposed approach that can work for the buildings and achieve
greenhouse gas emissions that we need to achieve.

mostly because the petition the text of the ordinance of the proposal is the same. however, I just want to make
sure that we do this since we are now in the formal ordinance process, and it would make sure that everybody's
interested is attending this hearing as an opportunity to hear the full scope of what is on the table. so, with that I
will just introduce. [listing names] we hear from me more department and had the law department was deftly

and so, coming out of this process we had general support from the regulated community. about the
performance standards and assigned space targets that were established therein. there is a goal to establish
regulatory certainties so tried to get the policy figured out sooner rather than later. and a desire to balance
flexibility in the policy with simplicity and predictability again knowing what to expect going forward.

I advised reducing greenhouse gas emissions being able to have a lot of flexibility for how those reductions are
achieved so they can come from both on-site and off-site measures. the actual complaints and targets are on the
left-hand side, and it will go through those on the next slide. But based on those targets we base it on what the
sizes: four from the IPCC in terms of our 2050 net zero commitment.
in the interim targets between now and then. and then the other important aspect to understand here is that the
Cambridge proposal this is different than for example the Boston ordinance is setting targets relative to each
individuals buildings baseline. this really simplifies the approach.
by avoiding the need to calculate the universal target. by building type print it also gives us more certainty about
the outcome because we know that all of the buildings are reducing a certain percentage then the outcome is
that percentage reduction. in each building is then contributing a proportional amount of that percentage
reduction depending on where they are starting. so higher emitting building has two make a larger absolute
reduction. to make the same percentage as a more efficient building is a lower absolute reduction again at the
same percentage. so, this graph is visualizing what those thresholds look like overtime. and so again the oldworld trajectory put this on that science-based targeted net 0 by 2050 and we chose increments in five years. to
match up with the retrofit cycles that buildings will undertake. so, acknowledging that it takes time for buildings
to plan and implement retrofits. so that way we have these steps so the buildings have five years then they can
meet the steps for another five years as anticipated the next five years.
and because the baseline is consistent throughout any early action that is taken during any of the steps is given
credit for in the following steps prince of the building goes below 20% in the first . for example, the net
automatically credited towards the next complaints we met. the way we regulate complaints is like regulating
greenhouse gas emissions for each energy use in the building. multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor for
that energy use. we'll talk about that a little more at the next light. then there's also a provision that buildings can
take credit for alternative compliance credits. which are purchased and go to reinvest in greenhouse gas
emission reductions elsewhere in the city.
then renewable electricity which I’ll talk about in a second. it is also a part of the calculation and it subtracted
from the electricity use portion of the energy formula. so, the emission factors are important because emission
factors translate the amount of energy that the buildings are using to the emissions. for example, electricity
emissions change over time as the state and national electric grid for cleaner. so, we are in the process of
planning the stakeholder-based process to determine the emission factors in particular for the electrical grid
coming in looking backwards to the baseline and projecting forward so that buildings know what they can
expect to receive credit from the grid over the period of each compliance period.
we want to project forward five years of the time to give building that certainty. so, as the building went to
comply with the performance standard, they can take on-site emission reductions. by increasing their energy
efficiency by electrifying there and uses of energy in getting off fossil fuels. and by producing electricity
through on-site renewable sources. they can also purchase off-site renewable electricity. this applies to the
electrical use of the building. or they can purchase alternate complaints credits. basically, talk about each of
these. so, for the off-site renewable electricity we went through a stakeholder process to establish the criteria
what counts as off-site renewable print want to make sure that these nobles are high quality and are adding to
the room nobles on the grid as opposed to kind of counting the same or nobles that are already out there.

I’m going to jump into the actual proposal the proposed amendments were submitted to council back in
November of last year. this line summarizes them I’m going to go through these one by one. but it's you for
your reference. so of course, the center of the policy proposal is the actual performance requirements. and so,
point to note here is that the performance requirements are in greenhouse gas emissions breaks as opposed to
energy or another unit. and the reason for that do not have conversation with the property owners that are
preference for that unit of what we are regulating to match what we are trying to achieve.

so, another aspect of the proposal from CDD has been buildings the option to choose an earlier baseline. this is
in response from trunk the back of the building owners that they wanted to have a way to take credit for action
before that default baseline of 2018 /2019. so, what we've done is we've allowed a baseline back as far as 2010.
but then we scaled the reductions so that buildings remain on that science-based trajectory of 50% by 2030
relative to that 2010 baseline and 100% by 2050. so, we can see that in these next couple of graphs and charts.so
on average BEUDO buildings have been reducing their emissions largely again due to the grid by 2.53% a year.
so, when we look at that trajectory if you take a building back beyond the default baseline, we assume that their
missions would have been higher in 2010 and they were in 2018 and 2019. so, the amount of reductions that
they need to make by 2030 target are then proportionally higher. if buildings choose the 2010 baseline, they
have to make a 50% reduction by 2030 as opposed to the 40% reduction for buildings taking the default
baseline. but what this allows is for buildings that to take early action say that building reduces the greenhouse
gas emissions by 35% in 2050 before the default baseline at 35% reduction would have them in compliance
through the other 2029. so, they would get credit for having made the effort for the early action.
and it would prorate those reductions over time. so, this slide shows that if you take an early baseline in between
the default baseline in the 2010 year then the amount of reduction requirement is prorated accordingly. the other
flexibility mechanism shall be included is specific optional pathways for both laboratories and affordable
housing. I will show how you want to be very clear that while this is more flexibly to these building types it
achieves the exact same amount of a role greenhouse gas emissions reductions over time.
so, you see that these buildings have a longer time period to comply to give them more time to plan and
implement these budgets. but they have higher production professionals to rather than the 20% threshold in
2035. that was proposed these buildings would have to hit a 33% reduction threshold starting in 2027. and so,
when we look at that in comparison to the default pathway over time the affordable housing pathway is an
orange. the default pathway is in blue. and you see the kind of flop if you do the math on hypothetical building
the lifetime emissions from those two buildings over the policy period are exactly the same.
so again, it is not a less stringent pathway for those buildings. it's just flexibility mechanism to give them more
time to plan for and implement those projects. we've also proposed flexibility for campuses. this being true
campuses like the university for that city buildings it does not apply to portfolio owners of rented properties. but
the goal is to let those summers aggregate their missions across all of their buildings and so that they can then
make investments at that campus level.
there are handful of exemptions in the proposal. the primary exemption being buildings that have already
limited their missions were achieved net zero and we expect most new buildings will achieve that standard in
the near future so for new buildings built in the in between years. there's a grace period for those buildings to be
able to get up to speed and plan their admission trajectory emissions reduction with net 0 by 2050.
again, looking at the bigger picture net zero action plan other avenues that require buildings to achieve net zero.
as many of you probably know the state is just released the first draft of their net zero threshold proposal so will
follow in participating in development of that proposal very closely. over the next year so that we have a clear
mechanism to require buildings to achieve net zero emissions and therefore have achieved the goals of the
building energy use disclosure ordinance. performance requirements. we also propose exemptions for buildings
that are not operating that are vacant. being demolished. every buildings under financial distress.

so, these requirements are fairly stringent. in order to add to that were nobles out there. and were hoping to help
building owners access these were nobles potentially through pathways such as our community aggregation
program. the alternative compliance credits again are an alternative compliance mechanism that buildings can
choose, and we propose a price for these credits of $234 a ton which is consistent with the Boston ordinance.
and that price is based on the average cost of producing emissions from buildings such as these. so, it takes the
average cost over time and deposit forward to understand without marginal cost would be connect the goal is to
incentivize buildings to take action but then give a reasonable alternative payment mechanism which would
then be reinvested in city programs and projects to reduce carbon throughout the community.

in the event of noncompliance, we got the existing penalty structure for BEUDO. the other elements of
compliance with performance requirements. so separate penalties can be assessed for not reporting the current
penalty structure. for reporting false data since we can't delete the performance requirement finds based on data.
we require buildings to proposed the buildings are required to have a third-party audit of their baseline. a
compliance date of so we can check the veracity of that data and of course not complying with the actual
performance reductions. so, the form of the penalty is a violation of up to $300 per violation per day. and
finally, we propose that once we get the first year of reporting in the first complaint that the policy be reviewed
and make it is the time to check in on the effectiveness of the policy. to consider adjustments that are needed
and to move forward with those adjustments.

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair thanks to seth for that excellent presentation. I’m excited
as well to be discussing these amendments print, I had a quick question about the exemptions for buildings. if
we can say a little bit more about that. if the building is truly net zero, would we want them to nonetheless
report their energy emissions so we can verify that if they are net zero and they would know with any money.
then it would be de facto exempt anyway.
>> Seth Federspiel: I think that's a fair question. the assumption is that zero buildings will continue to comply
with the reporting elements of BEUDO. but they would not be expected to follow the mission reduction
trajectory if they already done so. I think may be a bit of a technicality. and so is something we're happy to
discuss and figure out the most efficient way to address.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: awesome thank you.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you Mr. chair. that they might have been the second presentation as you indicated
it was a good thing because I actually think I got more out of it this time. and I think I thank you for that. it was
an excellent presentation. my question is on the penalties he wouldn't just be assuming somebody doesn't listen
at all which hopefully will happen. it's more than the three zones that you called for the three areas which were
that up to 350,000 rated it would be plus the tonnage penalty would it not?
>> Seth Federspiel: again, I would defer to the law department for guidance on this. I don't know if Megan is
here?
>> Megan Bayer, associate city solicitor: through you Mr. chair. so, we are limited in the way that we can issue
a penalty. under the noncommittal disposition statute and/or ordinance so it's $300 a day for a violation. and that
is the maximum that we can depose.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: trying to get clarification how do you charge per ton assuming they didn't reduce
anything? that's why they didn't report. we think that would be an add-on may be that cold a penalty. I don't
know what to call the $234 per ton. cost but it seems to me that it would be both. I mean it's a serious it's more
serious and more of an encouragement to follow up. $350,000 quite frankly for some people would not be a big
issue. if the tonnage is also paid for. the exhaust. that's a serious combination . I don't think … I assume both
would be in effect what about the exhaust? the greenhouse gases in the air? I’m not trying to be tricky.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I think councilor there were two numbers that were put up there as penalties there
was the $234 then there was the $300 a day. so, I think what Councillor Carlone is asking is that mean to be
$524 per day that we get find $234 plus $300.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: I’m sorry I thought I said that but maybe not.
>> Seth Federspiel: through you my chair I just want to add the $234 is not a penalty. it is not a fine. the $234 is
an alternate compliance option. the buildings may choose to satisfy all or part of their greenhouse gas emission
reduction requirement. so, they can make that payment to the fund to satisfy the requirements of the ordinance.

but it's not a penalty. and if they … therefore if they don't report or don't do anything at all the $234 would not
be part of that equation.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: I will let it ride thank you very much.

>> Seth Federspiel: just to clarify Mr. chair you are speaking to the $234? we arrived at that number by building
off the analysis that boston had done. on the actual cost of reducing emissions in buildings such as those
covered by BEUDO. so, the analysis showed that the average cost of all of the measures that might be taken
between now and 2050 to get the net zero would be that $234. so, the idea is by setting that as the alternative
compliance credit level buildings would be incentivized to take the many measures that cost significantly less
than that and so that have a negative cost or savings buildings in overtime as is written in the proposal that
alternative amount could also be adjusted to reflect the changes in technology and changes in cost. so, the idea
is to incentivize the buildings to take as much action directly as they can.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you councillor toner.
>> Paul F. Toner: like you mr. chair set around my question is do you based on what you presented and being in
the process it seems like you did a pretty thorough job of engaging all the stakeholders the universities business
groups and others that might be impacted by that . it sounds like you also reached some degree of consensus
about the achievability by 2050 of may meeting these goals is that correct?
>> Seth Federspiel: so we had 40 meetings with the stakeholders over the four years that we've been working on
this. i will let them speak for themselves. but i think the senses we did reach a good level of agreement on both
the form and astringency in the timeline of the policy. again noting that really the timeline that we pursued is
one that is in line with the science demanding rent climate change.
>> Paul F. Toner: my only follow-up you mentioned ipcc i'm not familiar with that organization. i know you
said that this plan meets ipcc standards the note we did at least one letter and public comments from someone
suggesting may be ipcc has a different take on things. can you clarify for me whether this meets ipcc standards
or not?
>> Seth Federspiel: sure through you mr chair the ipcc is inter intergovernmental panel on climate change. it is
the intergovernmental panel of scientists to study, change and assess what greenhouse gas emissions be
achieved to avoid the worst effects of climate change. and so the science that we are basing it on was based on
the 2018 and 2020 report. which cited a 50% reduction by 2010. i'm sorry 50% reduction relative to 2010 by
2030. and 100% reduction for net 0 by 2050. it is that pace we need to achieve. so that again is a trajectory that
we designed the policy to achieve.
>> Paul F. Toner: one less follow-up as anything changed in the past year and they come out with different
metrics or anything or are they still in agreement with that last statement you made that?
>> Seth Federspiel: to my knowledge it's still the same.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: any other clarifying questions from the committee? not seeing any other hands.
okay. thank you thank you for the presentation don't go away. we will now go to Councillor Nolan.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: how often do with the say that I’m really sorry.do I share my screen now and then we
will see if this works.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: you should have the ability to share your screen.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I’m in city hall but not. all good?
this is a visual presentation laying out amendments that Councillor Zondervan Councillor Carlone and I have
discussed over the last few months actually as the BEUDO conversation happened. so, you all the city council
as a matter of public record received a memo that was part of the public record for our Monday meeting. with a
little bit more text around us.
this will not this presentation doesn't talk about the actual language changes, but it does present a summary of
what it is we are proposing and why.

BEUDO is critical to our success as a city to reach our clinicals. what BEUDO does is mandate emissions
reductions from existing large building. set ably talk about this. and CDD is put forth a proposal for how that
would be put in place. it was a price of emissions from buildings and eventually requires emissions reductions
to net zero. the picture on this page is the new MIT building on main street. the city council has for many years
worked on climate emissions reductions. and it was actually 2011 a couple of people you were on the council
this council voted in zoning at the time the reason this really critically important is even in 2011 every single
building owner Cambridge was on notice that net zero something the council and the city was incredibly
interested in. at that time Cambridge was not ready to build these buildings and net zero.
unfortunately, the amendments didn't pass. but with BEUDERO these buildings like every other existing
building left to become a net zero overtime. it is a really important context that we all have to be aware of and I
know that several councilors and some in the public are not as aware of the timeline here. Seth mentioned it
with net zero action plan that helped create BEUDO in the first place. that first action plan laid out a timeline
for BEUDO encoded the actual language of BEUDO was initiated the patient that this is meant to spur
reductions in emissions. if it doesn't by the end of 2018 requirements were going to be put in place. there was
supposed to be put in place and tested from 2018 – 2022. the first version of performance requirements which
would have mandated performance requirements to reduce emissions.
the first period never happened we are now starting the first period just in 2022. At the end of the first period
which is about to be reviewed 2023 and a second version of requirements started in 2024. it is critically
important to understand why it is that for all of the work that is been done the BEUDO net zero action plan
timeline we are three years behind. in anticipated also possible for adding requirements which again means
every single building owner has known since 2014 since BEUDO pass. that this was coming. so, what we are
proposing is to build on the fantastic work of CDD put forth a lot of effort into the BEUDERO standards and
do a couple things. one simplified by taking out some fairly complex alternative compliance timelines. taking
out some different remove some of this additional work that was done and argued over the application. there are
a few key things. number one faster reductions to net zero by 2050. to reduce emissions faster on the highest
emitters mainly let building trades and then charge new nonresidential buildings for all permissions that will be

about. image on this page.
if the new file medical realty building for Thursday. this will be an all-electric file that buildings which means
they can quickly get to net zero to purchase the renewable energy. almost from day one. it is critical to note
given particularly appreciate councillor toner's question about the IPCC target we are a lot about science -based
targets. here is the deal. the IPCC target of 2050 is for the earth as a whole. the earth as a whole.
if that is going to be reached it absolutely requires that environmental leaders have to be much faster than what
the IPCC ultimate end goal is. there is no way that the entire earth by following will follow the emissions that
we are talking about which means all of us with yours as is environmental leaders absolutely have an obligation
to do everything we can to accelerate because otherwise there is no help for the planet I am not stretching or
exaggerating that. not only that the world has changed a lot remember BEUDO was passed in 2014. we

let me go back. this building just so people know this image shows the construction of a new Alexandria I’ll let
building which includes a geothermal field through reduced energy requirements and omission . she buildings
having built right now as we speak in Cambridge. far better than the existing buildings. as CDD noted in the
original BEUDO with methods for reductions and it did not succeed.

discussed in 2012 2013 was finally passed by the council in 2014 we are six years beyond that. in the world is
only merchant we cannot meet our own goals. without accelerated timeline is why we're saying it should not be
2050.

they already are being built fossil fuel free. d frankly the highest emitters and also the most profitable for their
executive suite 5. that we should be moving to say all of them should be net zero as soon as possible. establish
more stringent baseline. so, what we are proposing is a kind of hybrid. what Boston did with set a baseline for
all buildings to match written will be a thing just wherever you are you start a new lower from there. what we're
saying is that yes that is absolutely true. if you're lower than average or if you're even average to start where you
are just reduced on a timescale. but if you're one of the highest emitters. why would he allow you to start out
really, really high, and only reduce the same percentage as somebody else. so, it will be kind of a hybrid
approach. just for that first dream act wintering efforts period during the same timeline as everyone else and
although BEUDO buildings the baseline is to be zero emissions.
as Seth said that is true for all existing natural buildings on the buildings that it will be built in the city next year
have to be zero baseline for greenhouse gas emissions. that element will be presented a little more in-depth with
part of the degree new deal amendment. so why do we say 2035 just remind the council. before I was on it.
maybe for Councillor Zondervan with on their certainly not before Councillor Carlone. April 24, 2017, policy
order passed that the council supports the goal of using 100% clean and renewable energy in Cambridge
including in building energy and transportation by 2035.
goal was reaffirmed December 13 of 2021. so, I’m reminding all of us we cannot possibly achieve that goal. IF
BEUDO buildings are still burning fossil fuels at the 2035. likely can’t even achieve it with a long-term goal of
2040 or 2050 if we don't take accelerated action now. and at this point we still causing emissions indirectly.
how many of us have gotten an amazon or some kind of delivery in the last few weeks?
those are all shipping of goods into Cambridge which the emissions are not captured in this. so, this is a
reminder that a net zero BEUDERO building business really mean zero omissions because you can have
residual missions and you can also basically buy your way out. as Seth noted many of these places have just met
there reduction targets by the greening of the grid by 100% renewable energy and electricity to stop burning
fossil fuels. they just used 100% renewable energy as a way to meet lower their missions. that is still allowed.
and under the current BEUDERO proposal building until paid to pollute while meeting the definition of net
zero. That may be changed later. there is love if you really save, I cannot possibly stop burning fossil fuels my
basement and you pay that alternative compliance payment. so, another reason we're passionate about this is
that we know it's been really, really, really hard the cities been working on climate actions for more than 20
years. more than 20 years. The climate action plan was in 2002 literally 20 years ago. and there's a whole slew
of work done even for that plan. we been trying to reduce emissions since 2003 if not before and it's been
unsuccessful. these are some quotes from various I think mostly the first couple the CPAC annual report for
greenhouse gas emission continue to increase. 2003 it should be noted that missions will remain in 1990. the
goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 had not been met even by 20% rate reduction and overall
the citywide building emissions from 2012 – 2019 grew 11.3% is the most recent data we have this is based on
the outside consultant report looking at the net zero action plan and this is for the building sector they found
overall it grew from 2012 – 2019, 11% it was supposed to be going down 20 or 30% and it hasn't. The five-year
review which was published in 2021 I believe that 2020, I think is 2021 found that the first five years of that

and again, it should not be a surprise to building owner. since BEUDO was passed many years ago. so, the
proposed amendments to the amendments to the amendments which will again seem in writing. and it's a name
public. net 0 by 2035. not 2050. that is completely in line with the signs-based targets of the IPCC 's as we
know and as all of the people who discussed this upset there needs to be some action by many players up front.
it is why 90% of new homes in the Netherlands built in last year 90% in the last year were fossil fuel free.
Ithaca will be fossil fuel free by 2030. we cannot wait until 2050 and cannot be satisfied with just being with the
crowd would be I think a huge lost opportunity for climate like every trade will be doing the simplified
reduction to a percent a year. not every five years. strike some of the exemptions. allow an alternative schedule
for 100% affordable housing guess. but not for laboratory space laboratories should not be exempt.

That was not anything that we expected or what we hope for, is far behind what we expected or desired
outcomes. That review called for a drastically different approach which is what led us here today to
BEUDERO. so, let's look at what would happen this is a visual to say we are all talking about the same thing.
getting to net zero. we are proposing let's do a faster decline. that is, it. this shows you an overall the
BEUDERO buildings started 100%, the proposal we are saying is already going to make this rapid steep
decline and get to net zero by 2035 and the other way the amendments are proposing to amend it still has the
decline without actually changing that a methodology we are saying it has to be faster. both schedule require
20% reduction starting at 2025 and not a lot before them other than for high emitters. as we mentioned as we
know rapid near-term emissions are critical. just like anything else if you are paying off your interest is in your
pay it the better. for here the sooner we reduce emissions the better because if you don't reduce the mission then
they go on for 10 years. if you reduce them in 10 years there was a lot less than reducing them now. Cambridge
is a leader on climate change action or wants to be. Right now we really should step it up and show others that
can be done. the other reminder for us is what actual building will do. if I own a building just like my house, I
have been looking ay ground source heat exchange. while we see this nice step function, for individual
buildings it will be I am either going to buy all me renewable energy and reduce immediately or I am going to
electrify immediately. it would be more likable to drop pretty soon and then using renewable energy purchases.
it won’t be all clean and a step function for everybody or 8% per year more like 50% one year, 40% the next
year and then they will be done.
again we can talk more about what this means. Neither of these steps completely eliminates emissions. it's really
only the actual energy consumption that we are talking about right here in this chart. it's really important to
create economic pressure in favor of eliminating wasteful energy consumption that we don't need. so here's an
example. let's use an example of how our proposal varies from the amendments on the table. so you know what
this data shows you have a nice redline and a pink line. redline is for according to the 2019 BEUDO data from
every year you can look it up on the web you have about 800 buildings per year out of 1000 who report their
use. Biogen according to this data was accessed on the cambridge open data portal was at a really high level of
greenhouse gas emissions intensity which is measured in kilograms of carbon per square foot. what we're saying
is the really high emitters instead of being able to start high and just reduce like everybody else, which is what
the redline is, they have to immediately reduce.
again they can buy alternative compliance payments but they have to reduce it down to the industry average by
2025. from there just like everyone else. so these are two specific properties in cambridge from the BEUDO
database one is Biogen which is super high, above average, then the other is 2 oxford street which is a harvard
lab and it basically is at the average of labs, and for them the CDD proposal would be yes over time they don't
reduce that much because they are pretty good in terms of greenhouse gas emission intensity. our proposal has
them reduce a little faster. it's worth noting that both of these buildings are on the list of the top 25 largest
buildings emitters in cambridge.
of the thousands that we found in the BEUDO list the top 25, both of these are on it which means even to oxford
street which is far far less than biogenic is the one of the top 25 largest buildings of greenhouse gas emitters by
intensity which means settings industry-standard would not in effect in the vast majority of buildings. only
require 15 or 20 buildings to dramatically move that standard by 2025. because they are not already meeting it.
The industry standard the use of 25 is kept leading using admission standards from boston BEUDO proposal
number for science and technology was 19.2 kg per square foot. and for manufacturing with 23.9. so we chose
24 is new jersey standards but is the highest of both of those we might set if we go with his approach is
something a little bit lower but it seems like that's a pretty solid number to start with. all the data comes from
the cambridge open data portal.
and it's from the year 2019 as a baseline. so the summary here is that an underperforming building meaning way
more than ever it is going to produce sooner because it if you visualize that lie between the pink and redline all
of that is additional emissions that will be paid for under the proposal.

plan which was an action plan was to lead to reduction in fact essentially led to no progress. they had calculated
1% decrease greenhouse gas emissions which of course 1% is almost nothing.

so that is what we hope our colleagues will agree. it's an urgent area we know that people have worked with a
range of stakeholders. what i can say is this is feasible knowledge saw examples assembled an example to
buildings in cambridge right now and built this way. and that reduction can happen and eventually is very the
report at the chose when you do this you actually save money that the state canal with proposal for net zero
energy stretch code as i've mentioned and finally the response from the community and folks that follow this is
not going to get us where we need to go that is not going to say but we cannot rely on that because it's going to
allow continued use of fossil fuels which we should not sustain in cambridge.
that is it Councillor McGovern. i will stop sharing?
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you council questions?
>> Paul F. Toner: thank you mr. chair. Councillor Nolan have you done any outreach to the various
stakeholders who were involved in 40 meetings over the past four years to discuss these potential amendments
connect i'm just concerned about making these changes and yanking the rug out from consensus documents at
this point. have you had an opportunity to reach out to them.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: we haven’t talked to the entire climate protection action committee. the climate crisis
working group and several members of the net-zero action plan task force. they have all sent letters to the
council agreeing that we need to accelerate and we need to do this. that is certainly something that is next step
as we go forward in this process. and i will say outreach to those actors includes a number of people were on the
net zero action plan that was discussed again at the climate crisis working group and at the CPAC which is the
central body of the city to give advice to the city as a whole on climate issues. does that answer your question?
>> Paul F. Toner: one follow-up i don't know the members of the spec does that include people represented
from mit, harvard, the bio-labs are they in agreement that this is something that they support?
>> Patricia M. Nolan: i can't speak for all of the members. we can hear from them. my response to that is there
is going to be some pushback from those players. my response is of course because they are the highest
emitters. when you look at those highest emitters, it is the people you're talking about. so it's like saying yes i'm
not dismissing that whole process. what i am saying we tried to say in the presentation this is a different world
from even five years ago. and every single building in cambridge has been on noticed since long before buedo
came forward but that was promulgated and actually in 2014 that this was coming.
>> Paul F. Toner: again mr. chair, through you mr chair my only concern is as a city and as a council we invite
people to the table to have these discussions to come up with a consensus document and then we throw a
complete curveball and suggest reducing things by 15 years. i think even in your comments you said several
years behind and we also now go to truncate it by 50 years. i understand the urgency i get the comments for
getting. i do hope that we go to engage the other stakeholders especially the one that going to implement this to
get their response.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: mr. chair can give a direct response to … thank you mr. chair through you mr
chair to councillor toner. i appreciate the question i think is a fair question. but i will add that we are
stakeholders also. as residents of the city. an inhabitants of this planet. the decision about how much pollution
we are supposed to accept is not purely up to the building owners. that being said personally i've been in
conversation with these developers and building operators in cambridge for over a decade. on this issue. so this
is not new it is not being sprung out of nowhere. as Councillor Nolan mentioned back in 2011 there was a vote

final slide. so let's also remember even if BEUDERO buildings which is 1000 buildings except noted only 7%
in number but at 60%-70% of emissions. even if they all collectively cut their emissions in half. that only gets
us to have our goal. the city needs other major cuts in order to get to even half because BEUDO buildings are
little bit over half the energy the total greenhouse gas emissions in the city. so if they go down we only solve …
the pie chart is going to get net zero citywide print 50% reduction for BEUDO is only 20% of the whole city. so
in vain if we achieve that goal on the nose it doesn't mean we achieve it for cambridge overall means with
overshoot for the BEUDO sector to leave room for the challenges everybody else going to face the rest of the
city's knuckle to reduce their emissions by 50%.

in his council on mit's proposed buildings. on main street sold to the extent possible we can unfortunately we
can't afford lobbyists and consultants but to the extent possible we made our voices heard as residents and
stakeholders in the city we been very clear for over 10 years that we need these buildings to be net zero now.
particularly the new ones but also the existing ones.

>> Paul F. Toner: i don't want to engage in a big debate i just feel that if they were going to shave 15 years off a
timeline that was agreed to by 40 meetings and four years with all stakeholders understand were all stakeholders
and make the limited but to get the sense that a dome of the self become a crisis as quick as everybody else. but
i also don't have to meet these requirements. i just want to make sure that we engage those folks and have
conversation about how we do things as quickly as possible and as they are away as possible. and not just
surprise them with a 15 year change in the timeline. thank you.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: mr. chair through you mr chair these amendments were first put forth by
Councillor Nolan Councillor Carlone and myself by myself at the health and environment meeting again having
an ordinance committee meeting now. we were planning to have another ordinance committee at least one
more. so there's plenty more opportunity for the building owners to let us know how they feel and read the letter
from the chamber of commerce today.
>> alanna m. mallon,vice mayor: thank you mr. chair through you mr chair following along what councillor
toner was saying. i think we are in a different time right now. we have received some really bad news even
recently that new england is in a dire situation and messages it's in particular. the land is shifting underneath our
feet and we do need these to respond to make sure we are being responsive a ship that timeline the one thing i'm
wondering is if there is some time you ordinance committee is not a great place to have that conversation with
building owners.
we got a couple building or developer like adding alexandria biomed for building buildings currently illegal?
also free. we also have developers would not been brought to the table around some of these amendments and
am wondering if there is a way to do that outside of the ordinance committee process. that would be helpful to
bring people to the table to talk about why this is so important to talk about some of these amendments and
changes and timelines i'm not saying change them. necessarily but i am… it is important for people to work
together. we get an email from them a tape that they were not contacted there when the biggest developers in
the city and i would hope that we would go to them as a partner and a somebody why not has a really aggressive
chemicals.
what are those chemicals in alchemy the partners and work together. so in between now and the planning board
meeting and subsequent ordinance meetings i would encourage us to have a conversation or motion makers for
the amendment makers in this case to have that conversation with some of those eager developers the ones that
are doing the fossil pre-work. alexandria biomed and the folks that are not necessarily building right now net
zero apostle three but had we had that conversation and bring everybody to the table because we do know that
there was those 40 conversations we note that there was some consensus and i understand we all understand we
are in an emergency.
the lender shifting underneath our feet how we work together and partner. it's not a question that's early. i guess
it's more of a comment of let's try to figure out how to bring the players to the table and really talk about what
we are trying to do together and partner. so i will yield back at the time sorry mr. chair that was in a question for
the committee.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: don't you wish you had that button control all the time. i do have a question for seth on
the 40 meetings he mentioned . set without really BEUDO or with a net zero meetings?
>> Seth Federspiel: that was BEUDO through you mr. chair beginning in 2018 we had a series of meeting the
rope with all BEUDO building owners. first to design to go through a process to understand what the

City of Cambridge

and the BEUDO process goes back for 2014 it was adopted by the council in 2014. but was worked on for
several years before that.there shouldn't be any surprises here that we are saying this timeline is too little too late
and thank you mr. chair.

framework for building performance standards in cambridge could be. we also had a series of meetings about
the technical support and resources that these buildings would need to achieve the emissions reductions we are
talking about we already launched the cambridge healing energy retrofit program in the fall of 2019. to provide
easy access to this date incentives and technical support for building to meet the standards there were number
working group meetings as well as follow-up meetings because this process did stretch out in part due to the
pandemic and other delays and so we had continual meetings in 2020 and 2021 so that all of the property
owners could be aware of the proposal leading up to this omission to council.

that was voted on by the council. and approved and then mit spoke to one or two of the councilors and the votes
were changed. so this isn't new. this has been around. my own feeling is as i tried to say a few weeks ago if our
goal is 2050 and we overshoot it's 2060. our goal is 2035 and we overshoot it's 2042 or something like that.
there is no doubt in my mind the world is going to overshoot and we are the leaders. we are the smartest people.
as far as developers go of course we have to talk to them. of course institutions. believe me they know. but we
have to talk to them. but we represent more than developers. we represent the residents i've told you all that i
have bad asthma. you can hear it. and some of the longer term councilors might remember that was a few years
in the winter when i couldn't talk without coughing every sentence which i'm sure excited everybody and that
was because of the air quality. thank god i have medication that helps.
my point is this a serious stuff. i think the city has done great work. and we are revving it up. and maybe it will
be met but it will be a lot closer and a lot sooner if our goal is sooner. thank you.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you councillor. anybody else before asking my question.
a couple of things i will make a quick comment i think we're sort of i don't have splitting hairs is rights term or
missing each other i think the comment people have known that this is coming true. this is been talked about for
a long time. but what they sort of thought was coming was 2050. 2035 and all these other amendments to now
being proposed tonight without something that people necessarily saw coming until they were presented in
december. i think both things are actually true. people knew something was coming and was his committee to
work on it. and they thought that was coming was 2050 and now all of a sudden we have all of these new things
are saying 2035 nothing which is better or worse. so the feeling for some of those folks i think we diminished
never really discussed this enough?
i think it's also understandable because these are pretty significant changes that may be necessary changes but is
not quite fair to say they knew this is coming they knew the overall goal was coming did not know the
amendments were coming. that aside Councillor Nolan i don't know if you can answer this or maybe seth. in the
examples you gave not to talk about new buildings.
also talk about retrofitting buildings so an example that you gave for all the buildings which i'm not an expert
used alexandria biomed. these buildings are being built now again unless experts using to me that that might be
an easier thing to build something from scratch and do something a certain way then retrofitting. i guess my
question i would love 2035.
i sort of agree with rather set ambitious goals if you don't make them as Councillor Carlone just said i don't set
goals that make us just feel good because they're like we are just doing something we said 23 but we are better
than everybody else. i want to make sure that they can be done as a sciences there that they are achievable.
what's the difference between retrofitting a building versus building a new building what happens if all these
buildings go electric without a lot of better power grid and then what does that mean that that means we need
more substations and then where those go to goldie that we like them.

>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you i work with developers almost my whole career. it certainly had been in design
for 45 years.and i found that there were few enlightened once we get it. like joe maguire and alexandria and that
there are others who were so, and i get why, short-term thinking. they liked putting expenses like we all do if
you own a home or a condominium out as much as possible. i believe Councillor Nolan mentioned this but
when mit got its up the zoning for mainstream the original condition was net zero buildings.

so we went to substation near their house. this will serve layers together i guess my question to Councillor
Nolan with you understand that the difference between new buildings versus retrofitting buildings and are these
goals applicable to both of those kinds of things? is it easier to build a new building and meet these goals versus
retrofit and meet his goals.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: i totally agree we should get all the players to the table. i with that. it's something that we
need to be doing. i will also note that if building owners are the table that is like the tobacco companies being
what to say how do you reduce smoking. there are literally the people remitting these emissions.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: i think they can do it right i think they could totally do it. to directly answer your question
i think you raise all those important things we've discussed which is the education that substations the capacity
of the grid. which is probably why what we really want to do is we want shield microgrids across the entire city
want grounds for seed exchange to be used to get dramatically lowers the load on the existing electric structure
because you are tapping into the earth's natural heat. and for several places where that is already in place. for
large building.
and they do not have to rely on they can do it with the existing electrical structure but that's exactly what your
specific question about retrofitting that easier with newer but remember the existing BEUDERO amendments
assume every existing building it to come down to zero. it’s only a matter of by when.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: some of the question was another discussions about this i've heard people say that
scientists are quite there yet. it's not quite ready. so part of the goals of 2050 were to sort of hoping that things
would kind of catch up and i guess is that.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: i talked to developers in the last couple weeks and they said if you want ask us to do this
five years ago i would've said you are crazy right now it really has changed. can it happen? i would argue
especially given as an mit and harvard's commitment gave the people the best people placed on earth to do this.
they can do it and remember if you can't get there within a few years you can have a total turn complainant's
famous which then go into a fund to help solve this.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you i know other folks with my question. i would say this before i turn it
over i'm going to go to. [listing names] because before i go there. this does bring up and imagine this monday
night. about is the ordinance committee and this apollo level with the vice mayor said the ordinance committee
is a more clunky committee. we get the language. we get an amendment. we discussed the amendment. it just us
at the table. we decide what we like the amendment or we don't vote on it. whereas it's not like a human services
committee where goodbye dh sp and you buy that nonprofit afterschool people and you might always have the
people to the table and we sit around and say how we come to solve the problem.
i guess that sort of a question in terms of yes mit will, i don't know if they're on the phone now. they will, it will
stay there three minutes or two minutes.
and that is it that is different than being at the table saying okay how do we all get to the goal of 2035 and here's
what our problems are and hear what our concerns are happily posed many substations around the city? that
doesn't happen in the ordinance committee. so with something for us to think about. it's not the past these
amendments then it's codified assault. that the discussions happening after the fact. it's something to think about
this is the best place to have those more in the weeds kind of conversations.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: the direction the ipcc save the recent report was code red for humanity literally is what it
was called it has changed.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: i'm going to go to.

>> Seth Federspiel: thank you i just want to remind you mr. chair and rest of the councilors of the table i
showed early in the presentation about the structure of the action plan. so BEUDO amendments and BEUDO as
it currently stands is specifically designed to address existing buildings and all the existing buildings. obviously
buildings become existing buildings but there other parts of the net zero action plan where we see to move new
buildings to achieving net zero emissions from the start. so BEUDO focused on existing buildings. and as a very
different process from the existing building to retrofit to change its existing systems and take them out and
replace them. to achieve net zero emissions than it is for new building to be designed to be net zero emissions
from the start. i just want to make that distinction.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: i do see Councillor Carlone Councillor Zondervan i saw Councillor Carlone
Councillor Zondervan pants pop up in relation to my question until just gotten up to hold on that because not
going to get to this resolved tonight i'm just worried about the time we got 30 people. i do not hold as people are
speaking but even if too many features that one hour. and then we still have to hear Councillor Zondervan's
presentation and go to clarifying questions about that. were going to be well past at 7:30 pm if we do those
public comments and do all that right now. i don't think we need to talk. you can answer those if you have
something additional to add don't feel i don't waste time answering my questions. if that's okay?
>> Dennis J. Carlone: just quickly absolutely existing buildings are different leases get finished at certain times.
so i'm sure seth are thinking about this. there would be a plan for existing buildings. so one or two floors would
be vacant into years. that's when work gets done and it can all be done until most of the building is done. but
nevertheless it would speeded up quite a bit. i'm done. i wouldn’t say anymore.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: thank you mr. chair i will be brief. my presentation is not very long.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: can you speak up it's very hard to hear you.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: uncovered you right now from my living room in an old electric that zero
building. it took me 15 years to retrofit but we are using 60% less energy overall to run our house. and we using
less electricity overall to run our house because we have solar panels. so the answer to your question is
complex. but the brief answer is it absolutely can be done. we absolutely have to do it and it does not require
bringing tons of electricity into the city can't require that that's not a good solution. we have to do it locally by
using our local energy sources geothermal with the use of solar. and then of course we bring in some renewable
energy from wind. and the BEUDERO structure is quite good. if you look at the amendments that we are
proposing it's like 5% of the tax we are trying to amend.
it includes 30 specific ways that these buildings can offset their energy use by building more renewable energy
off-site that doesn't have to be piped into cambridge because the grid itself is going to become more renewable.
it's a complicated answer but the answer to your question is yes you can do this work and we have to do it.
>> e. denise simmons: thank you mr. chair this is been a very good conversation i did want to say two things. or
several things quickly i wanted to get the public comments because i do want to hear people from the
community. to say i want to thank my colleagues for the time and the talent they brought to this process and
Councillor Nolan exuberance is palpable. i do have concerns in the morning and said. i believe some these
amendments are fairly new. in cambridge we as a city we talk about being a leader. we have been a leader in
transparency and predictive ability.
so if you think somebody were going to do this and were going to do this in 2050 and then turn around and just
change it without having discourse meaningful discourse we are not doing what we can do. i think the vice
mayor said that the ordinance committee that plays a different i respectfully ask some of these amendments i've

done a lot of work on existing buildings. and bringing their energy efficiency so we can speak to your question
and i just also wanted to mention that BEUDO applies to a pretty wide spectrum of buildings. i know we sort of
been focusing a lot on the three large dairy capitalized players. but there are number of smaller buildings that
are subject to the BEUDO amendments that do BEUDO and then the amendments prayed that will have
different levels of capacity in order to comply. i just pulled want to turn over to seth.

not heard from Councillor Zondervan go back to committee be properly vetted. i don't know what because
french nations or the unintended consequences may be and i'm just as concerned about climate change as the
person of color know that some of the downsides of the climate change impact my community more than any
others. thank you for using the pictures of black people ms nolan. so for me if were going to be about
transparency predictability that we need to be transparent and predictable. and to do that? do you really need to
take us back to the table and invite people. to have a conversation i don't think it's efficient enough to say well i
talk to these people and they knew it was coming.

>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: Councillor Zondervan let me ask you this how long do you think your
presentation is.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: maybe 10 minutes.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: why don’t we do that. and maybe we can be a little bit maybe we can hold some
of our clarifying questions since we're going to come back we can certainly revisit Councillor Zondervan's
presentation. and then get the public comment. the difference between if we get the public comments and we
recess that would be no public comment at the next meeting. if we adjourn would mean we would have public
comment at the next meeting. some would have to decide whether that will we get there. Councillor Zondervan
what would your presentation as planned? maybe we will hold up in some clarifying questions or get through
them quickly and then hopefully go to public comment in the next 10 minutes for 15 minutes.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: thank you mr. chair can everybody see my screen? i do want to preface by
saying the original net zero task force which i was a part of with Councillor Carlone we did have conversations
with the business community. at that time as well. i'm always happy and open to doing that again and more. but
i do have to say that the fact that 40 meetings were had without us and we are also stakeholders doesn't mean
that somehow we have to abide by this agreement because we are excluded from that conversation. it's never
too late so let's communicate and certainly reach out to some of these building owners and have this
conversation. i'm not in favor of sending this back to committee. we already had this last week. thank you
Councillor Nolan for presenting those amendments.
which i'm about to present here is a smaller set of amendments that are probably called the green new deal and i
worked on with Councillor Nolan and Councillor Carlone some of these ideas were presented last year as part
of the green new deal zoning position and based on feedback from the planning board we pulled it out of
zoning and is part is being put into BEUDERO which wasn't available to us at that time. so we are proposing
three amendments. one is to allow the alternative compliance payments called credits in the language to be used
for green jobs training programs. number two is to require all large new commercial buildings to paper all
emissions. and number three to include.
[unclear audio].
this is just showing some of the investments happening where across the street from you can see on this map all
of these technology buildings that are creating tremendous economic opportunity but not for the people living
across the street. and we are dealing with a double injustice area as councillor simmons mentioned climate
change disproportionately impacts people of color and low income communities and excluded from the
economic opportunities and their being displaced by the rising cost that is created by all of this high and
economic development. there is a lot of injustice happening and when we are contracting climate change with
do keep that in mind and try to design policy that counteracts both economic injustices and become injustice
happening.

so i want to say with all sincerity i certainly respect the work that son i look forward to my colleagues
presentation that's about tempering i would hope that we get rather soon to public comment i think you said
chairperson there are 30 people and 7:00 i recommend we continue this conversation because it really is going
to take more time not to adjourn perhaps a recess to continue the conversation after we have public comment.
my struggle recommendation would be to think back to the environmental committee and really tease this out a
lot more. i yield the floor.

this is throughout the state through 2050 if we don't require them to stop fossil fuels. then the green triangle
which i added showing approximately the amount of nations that they can be avoided if we got net zero
standard next year 2023 for the new building. so you can see how much potential emissions we can avoid if we
put in place requirements they start consuming fossil fuels or stop consuming fossil fuels. it's this is totally
feasible in fact yesterday morning department of energy resources introduced net zero energy stretch code that
we can potentially enact by next year. this is another quick example of the impact of new buildings. new
buildings projected up to 2050 by square footage are green at the top and existing buildings are blue at the
bottom. clearly the existing buildings little dominate the buildings by 2050 does a significant amount of
construction that's going to happen between now and then. and all that green area could be zero missions if we
adopt the right policies now.
why the commercial buildings and set really cover this well already. commercial buildings simply count for the
vast majority of our nations and we don't put in place stringent requirements for new buildings were going to
see exactly the same result again as we did with mit and main street. set also mentioned his earlier 6% of the
buildings in the city are responsible for two thirds of the emissions. it's pretty straightforward. we know where
the problem is and if we address those buildings we cannot down our emissions then for the new buildings
would avoid the problem in the first place to be net zero. so the amendment for this is simply to add a sentence
which has all nonresidential commercial properties receive a special permit for 2022 and beyond based on net
zero.
basically they're not reducing from zero there expected to be at zero and if they have any emission above zero
they would pay into the alternative compliance payment for those emissions which then the city can use to
install solar panels to help make affordable housing more energy efficient. i defunded green jobs training
programs through these minutes. then the last piece is the and body divisions this is just quickly showing what
we mean that that so the body divisions are the emissions from reducing manufacturing mining and materials
that go into the buildings. i told the emissions that results from that as well as that transporting those materials
to the building site in some cases these materials come from far away. and then of course the emissions
produced by the actual construction and heavy equipment to do that and here's why.
so this is from another report showing that the building materials and construction are 11% of our global
emissions. that's a pretty significant number. that is currently completely unaccounted for. and most of that is in
the concrete steel and materials there is glass and that as well.
it's relatively straightforward for us to calculate at least roughly what the emissions contribution for a new
building . the whole idea behind charging for those to create economic pressures on the developers to minimize
those emissions. i will read all this.
this set of slides specified again the exact language that creates the emissions requirements and it basically says
for new commercial buildings they would have to pay toward the emissions over a ten-year period to gain
alternative compliance credits. he goes into more detail about what is to be included in the calculation as well is
what we left out of the emissions regulations. this quickly just wrap up is a summary of the effect of the
amendment. so try to amendments as currently proposed. would charge a new building for the area that
represents the excess emissions.
and according to BEUDERO that to get those operating emissions to 0 by 2050. but if they don't manage to do
that which is simulated here read than they can pay $234 per ton those excess emissions was important to note

that's what we are trying to accomplish with the green new deal. as you know on monday we traduced a
proposal for green jobs ordinance. thanks again to councillor simmons and the mayor and Councillor Carlone
for the support on that. and at the idea in this amendment here is simply to allow the alternative compliance
payments that are being made by the developers if the building isn't net zero to go towards those green jobs
training programs. until this shows the actual text and you deed literally just a few words at the end that say they
can be used for green jobs training program sprint that is amendment number one. then amendment number two
is to require all new commercial buildings to pay for all of their emissions. one question might be why? so this
is for the department of energy resources which is a state department chosen a black line the projected
emissions from buildings.

2.1

is that they want paper the embodied emissions and they will pay for the operational emissions but they allowed
under the reduction schedule proposed by the BEUDERO. what we are proposing these amendments is that the
new commercial buildings would pay for all of their emissions under these amendments and so as been said
earlier these emissions are all advoidable to a large extent is reasonable to say we can avoid them that we have
to pay for them.
they would use those funds to do emission reductions elsewhere and to create economic opportunity for low
income. that is the conclusion of my presentation.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: great thank you. councillor simmons i assume that hand was from before?
>> e. denise simmons: yes it was thank you.

>> e. denise simmons: it wasn't the question was i don't i did not want to be thought of how we tried to cut off
public participation. in terms of your right when you said if we recess this meeting will be able to have public
comment because we would've already had it. but if there is no appetite to bring this into a forum where they
can be more engagement because public comment doesn't give us the kind of engagement that we needed to
hear from people 's perspectives then i would not recommend that we recess. just had a station ordinance
committee.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: i have a thought on how we may want to do we can do all this but i will say that
keep you all in suspense until the end. and let's get to public comment we don't give folks two minutes please
state your name and address for the record. obviously we know what you're here to talk about. mr. clerk can you
call with first.
>> kristine jelstrup: 120 pleasant st. good evening and thank you so much for this opportunity to speak to. i
enjoyed the presentation. i will keep this short as i can hear you all well aware that the coming crisis is upon us.
and getting worse with every passing year. 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in cambridge come from buildings
emissions. all cambridge buildings have gone up over 11% from 2012 – 2019. it is imperative that we reverse
this disturbing trend and move towards greenhouse gas reductions quickly. it's hard to imagine reductions in the
future when the trend has been to increase emissions. in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we need to
hold super emitter buildings to account for all of their emissions. it's crucial to cambridge to pass the strongest
BEUDO amendments possible. BEUDO is by far our best opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
cambridge. lastly cambridge should aim to reach net zero emissions by 2035 not 2050 we need to act boldly and
we need to act now. thank you.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you.
>> margery davies: i'm speaking as a member of the net zero action plan fund review test force. i appreciated
the opportunity to participate in the task force and have learned a lot from it. i'm also a member of the
cambridge chapter of mother's out front. i have spoken to you a number of times about BEUDO. one thing i
want to make clear is in terms of BEUDO amendments as proposed by the community development
department, the net zero action plan task force was given the opportunity to comment on those proposed
BEUDO amendments once they've been submitted. the task force wasn't involved in crafting those BEUDO
amendments. i'll be as brief as i can with several points. number one cambridge needs to move more quickly. it's
been my main concern since the beginning of the task force work in cambridge really needs to speed up in my
opinion. second point is that less than two months ago on december 13 the city council reaffirmed its
commitment originally made in 2017 for the goal of using 100% clean and renewable energy by 2035 not 2050.
point number three that situation is urgent. greenhouse gas emissions in cambridge have gone up over 11% not
found in recent years. this is going in the wrong direction. point number four accountability. i'm concerned that
cambridge does not hold itself accountable for the goals for the separated deadlines are often missed or we fail
to enforce requirements one troubling example is the rate of compliance with reporting requirements for
buildings covered by BEUDO. number buildings have been required to report their BEUDO about the report of

their emissions for the past six years. in 2015 95% of BEUDO buildings reported their energy use. the
percentage of buildings reporting has gone steadily down every year since. by 2020 only 73% of BEUDO
buildings reported.

>> greg carey-medlock: i live in 253 river st. today like to express my support for the BEUDO amendments as
proposed by councilors i moved to cambridge recently with my wife and son. when the most appealing features
of cambridge less is that it's a leader in progressive action.including climate change mitigation. in our homes we
feel strongly that duty to leave the world a bit better for next generation. thank you councilors for your service
and doing your part the next generation.
cambridge is a walkable likable city with excellent public transit which strongly enables our ability to reduce
emissions. however greenhouse gas emissions from buildings are increasing despite infrastructure for an
emissions monitoring put in place by BEUDO. building BEUDO have gone up by 11%.
and commercial institutional building specifically we seen at 29% increase in carbon emissions. as a scientist
myself which is simply laboratory settings i can tell you that this is not necessary. we need a coordinated and
proactive response to reduce building emissions through improved locally probably mitigate or influence on
climate change presence. the proposed BEUDO amendments do just that. climate change is an urgent and
unparalleled problem. in extra help with job security in homes especially from those vulnerable members of our
community. we must move quickly. i'm in support of reaching net 0 by 2035 as committed to previously by the
council. i urge the ordinance committee and council to improve the amendments and to prioritize climate
change action. thank you.
>> david rabkin: chair of the coming protection action committee. i'm going to respond to what i heard tonight
and change my remarks a little bit. first to something Councillor McGovern put on the table. mark we are going
all electrics or pretty close. it's going to take a lot of work. it just a matter of how fast it's going to be. so we
really have to focus on that. secondly BEUDO is about existing buildings. but we also need to do something
about new buildings.
right now when it comes to new buildings we are waiting for the state to update the stretch energy code.
unfortunately that's almost a year away. best case. how much in construction are we committed between now
and then. it is a big missed opportunity. we need to take action on a short run we need an approach probably
based on special permits. that seems like a likely good partial solution. i recommend keeping it simple so it can
be designed and implemented quickly.
third my major point. please remember CPAC’s letters of december about BEUDERO . they're very supportive
of what came out of those 40 conversations. as was talked about earlier. and yet we wrote in a letter that
BEUDERO is proposed filled all sorts of the city's needs. so we recommended that the city accelerated the
timeline in BEUDERO considers including smaller buildings within the framework. explore additional
measures to reduce emissions from the highest emitting buildings more quickly than planned. create a schedule
to phase out the acp. that may require the elimination of on-site fossil fuel burning systems.
evaluate the acp more frequently than planned starting at the end of the first complaince period. adopts the
commonwealth new stretch code as quickly as we possibly can. and finally invest in programs that provide the
access to the technical and financial resources that property owners are going to need in order to be able to
actually make improvements to the buildings that we need to meet our emissions goals.

point number five. the BEUDO amendments proposed by the community development department need to be
strengthened. the BEUDO amendments proposed by Councillor Nolan and Councillor Zondervan do just that
and note that you will support them. in conclusion this is in a competition. we are all in this together. city
councilors should be staff and cambridge residents creating the strongest BEUDO amendments that we can
should be a group effort. when we succeed we will all be able to be proud of her roles in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions in cambridge. thank you very much.

given official recommendations coming from a player that is very supportive and it should have bought in
completely i don't think it's appropriate to label BEUDERO thus far as a result of a consensus process. a
challenging it was to get where we are we still have a way to go. thank you.
>> robert michael pittsley: hello i'm calling from 56 norfolk st. the many effects of climate change have begun
to take place and finally become lately under normal. not living a scientifically predicted time.faced with
emerging diseases food insecurity and sea level rise. one with so many undesirable realities faced by
environment of justice communities differently come public direct we need to do everything we can to
transition to a system more conducive the public and by mental health.

the indirect effect of natural gas leakage on urban vegetation is obvious since the soil gas phase composition
leak is available for plant growth.within the gas zone the oxygen conservation is very low to zero while carbon
dioxide is high. consequently roof growth is stopped and respiration is inhibited so uptake of water nutrients are
reduced and eventually the plants die. after the effects of gas leakage may persist for can simple matter of time
toxic components can be left in the soil as reduced and organic substances. effective restrictions and prevention
of leakage with natural gas as well as ensuing injury to street trees can only be realized if there's good
cooperation between the city council parks department and municipal gas companies.
i'm here tonight asking the cambridge move faster, reach hire and set the example. we can and must reach net
zero missions by 2035 not 2050. vast amounts of scientific research clearly explain and can confirm the danger
and failure of our recurring energy systems as well as the viability of a more sustainable alternatives that are
modeled in cities around the world.
city council please adopt the higher standards please provide jobs for people to build a healthier future held the
buildings that we need. and please ban gas hookups for buildings and reflect the 2035 that's your goal upon old
BEUDO targets and senders.

confidence that we can address these matters together for mutual satisfaction just as we have for multitude of
details over the past several years.
unfortunately we’re not able to support BEUDO tonight because of the new amendments that were introduced
two days ago. these late edits have not been discussed with stakeholders. and are not endorsed by city staff. this
last-minute flurry of activity runs counter to the nature of the entire BEUDO effort . while we've only briefly
scanned proposed edits received the laboratories have been deleted from a section it's been excessively research
has anybody asked the BEUDO laboratory working group for a template?

it's because we work together they and day out on these matters we share data best practices expertise and
philosophies we argue offer counterproposals rewrite and regroup. and we make significant advancements as a
result of our commitment to the planet and as to the most reliable way of bringing about progress. collaboration.
we urge you to advance in november 2020 BEUDO amendments with continuing dialogue in the areas we
noted. thank you.
>> thomas lucey: sorry about that good evening i'm tom lucy speaking on behalf of harvard university. harvard
is negated with the city regarding reducing emissions to climate change and sustainability for decades. we've
advanced world second-generation climate goals and our campus is through leading-edge goals. we are pleased
to participated and contributed for many years to the city staff run sickle to present the result in the BEUDO
recommendations.
released in november. now given the time limit in public comment when i put the address those
recommendations but we will react to the new amendments were unveiled monday night.
so it's not amendments made with the same full and thorough vetting of public dialogue as the BEUDO process
because of the time to reengage all stakeholders to ensure remains a civil and respectful dialogue.
everyone in this impulse shares the same goals of addressing emissions and saving the planet. no one is a
monopoly on those sentiments nor the knowledge of the best approach to achieve them. as for the newly crafted
amendments with some initial comments and questions. given the state of current technologies these proposed
regulations will push building owners explore electrification at the same time. we've not seen a planet showing
that the regional or local grid is capable of handling these changes so rapidly.
so we asked for the city working with the state and eversource to understand the impact of this relation and what
the impact would be on the regional electric grid and specifically cambridge. is cambridge planning to do a
feasibility study to understand the scope changes left to meet the 2030 proposed deadlines and to understand the
risks and costs involved? what is the anticipated increase electrical demand? and how will this electrical supply
be generated? and if the city actively engage with the resource provides this increased demand to the city? this
removes our ability to utilize our subject matter expertise as well as a rigorous approach to research and science
to achieve net zero emissions. we want to do this in partnership with the city and to identify the best path to
achieve our shared goal of science-based net zero solutions. i hope we get the opportunity to do so and that
these amendments are not abstract would benefit from true scientific analysis on the road public dialogue.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: thank you. okay. i'm going to go to Councillor Zondervan then i have a thought.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: thank you mr. chair. and to my colleagues on the committee. my suggestion
was and remains that we keep this matter in committee. we will schedule another hearing and will have time in
between to talk with anyone who would like to discuss these matters in more detail. and i do take some issue
with the scolding for receiving on not reaching out because people know our phone numbers and they can reach
out to us as well. i'm happy to proceed in that way and i think we will have plenty of opportunity for dialogue
before we bring this forward.

we noticed the time frames have been drastically condensed leaving open questions regarding feasibility. and
available technology. as anybody reached out to have resource to get its view? mit is committed to a
comprehensive action plan of achieving net zero emissions by 2026. in eliminating all direct emissions by 2050.
it's no coincidence our common goals are aligned with the city's net zero action plan and the BEUDO
amendments.

with all the stakeholders of the table that's where we need to go next. that process led to particular amendments.
which some of us are now saying we need to be changed in the face of again the ipcc leaders report issued last
year with literally " code red for humanity.so i understand all of us want to get there. and the question is how to
get there. i want to have those discussions. i want this to get there. i want harvard, mit, all the building owners
in the city to be with us at the table. i know many of my colleagues committed to that. let's not throw this out as
an idea that we shouldn't endorse something that the rest of the city didn't even that before was just put on the
table.
once it was put on the table some of us came together working with a range of people across the city with just
our heads it was working with a range of experts across the city. in a greased does lots of questions to ask about
electric capacity about how we are doing it i would love to keep this in committee but also letting my colleagues
know if you think that makes sense that that is the appropriate venue to have very quickly as soon as we can
schedule it help the environment committee meeting and run it like a roundtable and specifically invite any of
the folks were in those 40 meetings if they would come and talk about his and eversource in the city.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you cochair. i think the issues raised primarily by the institutions are fair. i think
my colleagues have responded in part but as Councillor Nolan was referring to i think the people we talk to
need to show up at this roundtable. it might be that i have some background in green architecture but not in all
of these fields. that is for sure. and we do need the experts to talk about this. we are not saying just accept it
because it is submitted by us. we have to have these discussions but at the end it's only about our world and our
city and nothing is more important than this. in trying to push the effort forward to me if we can make this work
why not? that's really what it comes down to. if we can clean up the air sooner why not? that is what this is
about. yes there's been negotiation as my fellow councilors have said we've not been a part of that. and we are
the ones that make those decisions. final decisions. we have to influence each other in the right way. thank you.
>> burhan azeem: thank you mr. chair. apologies for not using the hand thing my zoom isn't working. i had two
questions for the city or mainly for the city but also if the amendment makers want to answer that is fine as
well. i'm curious why these amendments, why the original proposal focuses only large buildings rather than the
small buildings considering they also are a large consumer of the emissions print on top of that white
transportation emissions are not included my sense is if you have empty parking lots would be easier for to
qualify for these than the equivalent house just because the empty parking lot using less construction materials
obvious is used for trends relating more gas powered vehicles. so kind of doesn't fit into this particular version. i
was just curious why those were left out? on the original proposal.
>> Seth Federspiel: again net zero action… i will take those two question reversed. the net zero action plans is
exclusively focused on building emissions. which again are about 83% of the cities emissions we are in the
process of developing a net zero transportation plan that will address the transportation sector but that's a
separate process. not that it's not being inserted is not part of this policy. in terms of the building science
threshold the building energy use disclosure ordinance that is in effect and was adopted in 2014. applies to
specifically two large buildings in cambridge. the commercial buildings when he 5000 square ft. or greater. and
residential buildings largely in 50 units. those buildings account for about 70% of the building sector emissions.
even though they're only about 6% of the number of buildings. so the proposal the original proposal from does
not propose any changes to those thresholds.
>> burhan azeem: through you mr chair reasonably met up understand i forget the exact number but a percent of
our buildings are responsible for 60% of the emissions but in the original five you showed was really about
square footage. like the square footage of the buildings roughly corresponds with the percent of emissions to the

this in committee i also want to do is: many of the health environment committee have it be more of a
roundtable to any player including from both harvard and mit. have those discussions. i do want to remind all of
us that if we do want an open and transparent process my understanding is that those 40 meetings were closeddoor meetings that were not in the public domain. there were only with building owners.

>> Seth Federspiel: again this is considered at some length when the BEUDO ordinance was originally adopted.
consideration of the balancing point between what is asked of building owners and how many building owners
would be required to take those actions. and so for 25,000 square-foot and 50 units thresholds were established
to capture again that bulk of the square footage that you mention. while requiring a relatively small number of
building owners to go through the administrative process to do that reporting. and in terms of addressing
emissions from all the buildings in the city that's with a full net zero action plan is really important to consider

>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: i'm going to go to mayor siddiqui it looks like you're coming to us from a bunker.
>> mayor siddiqui: i'm fine with keeping this in committee. i will say on this topic. we've… the council past
castles of talk about various issues everything from the linkage fee and increasing it to.. to this issue where
fundamentally sometimes there is disagreement and partnership may not be able to happen. with that said i think
it is important to have our partners at the table and help us think through a lot of different decision points but
ultimately from what i've seen is that on this topic there have been a ton of meetings and there is a sense from a
number of individuals, activists who feel like they haven't been heard there invited to the table but this
fundamental disagreement. we should definitely keep having a conversation about these amendments. much
more is to be done. and at the end of the day i think ultimately we have to vote these up and down. and i think
there may not be concensus here. i think this is just the reality of the situation. if were looking for consensus on
this case and everything i've heard in all the meetings i have happen a notch without exist. and it is important to
hear from and have further conversations i will stop there but i'm happy to keep this in committee as we planned
not to vote in anything tonight.
>> Paul F. Toner: thank you mr. cochair. i'm go to throw my and the new guy card in the table i'm hearing that
there were 40 meetings over four years. but for some reason city councilors were invited and of the folks were
invited to the meetings. i'm not clear on that of why that is the case. but i do want to encourage Councillor
Nolan that if we are not going to take it out of the ordinance committee that you have that hearing speak in the
least from this my experience and my first ordinance meeting this doesn't seem like the appropriate venue to
actually get to the real core issues about what can and can't be done what's realistic? what's practical? i'm not
suggesting that everybody's going to agree but it sounds like according to the mayor activists felt like they
weren't heard. if there's an opportunity to have a different venue to talk about these issues and get everybody's
input before we finally bought an it i would appreciate that. going forward.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: what it was going to suggest…we said from the beginning it was going to be
another ordinance committee meeting nothing was advancing today. that was clear from the beginning. so we
can keep this in committee and send the subject matter to health and environment shared by Councillor Nolan
so that she can bring it up at that meeting or event unnecessary can we just keep it in committee then she just
call her own meeting?
obviously the goal being i would think Councillor Nolan that you call that meeting soon. so for the next
ordinance committee meeting so we have whatever comes out of that meeting if other things need to be
amended or adjusted we have that for the next ordinance committee meeting so mr. clerk is there any procedural
thing or can Councillor Nolan just called on me now that is if an ordinance with to do anything to send back or
can i just happen.
>> anthony ivan wilson,clerk: through you mr chair there is no procedural motion that needs to happend. i
would caution that may be talk to i don't know if there's anybody from the law department on the call. this is a

large commercial large buildings in general exceed 2% of us were footage in the city. there were like 70% of
the emissions. i don't see a great disparity between the surface area of these sizes. i'm wondering… i'm worried
a little bit that triple-decker's for example don't get included but once you get the four or five stories whenever
the threshold is it seems a little bit arbitrary is there reason to not include red smaller buildings?

process predicated under the general laws. i don't know if it precludes something like that. my one point of
caution for the council.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: anyone from the solicitor's office.
>> Megan Bayerl correct me if i'm wrong but i don't believe this is not a zoning petition.

>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: just to come in. i know this is radical in the political landscape that we are in.
these days. maybe we should try to assume good intentions and everybody's park instead of bad intentions on
everybody's part. what makes cambridge great this we heard this from a new commissioner of public health
came here from texas it's great to be in a city where you don't have to convince people that science is real. i
don't think that anybody even if those councilors will raise questions about the process and who spoke to a
sitting you're saying we don't believe that science and want to delay this as long as possible.and we can try not
to just because somebody asked the question or raises a concern doesn't mean that they don't agree with what
the ultimate goals are. and if so let's not do that to each other as this goes forward.and i think that's was
ultimately going to make the leader in this. by asking a question like okay were going for 2035 is that possible?
that is not my saying that i think climate change doesn't exist and it's a hoax is my asking are we setting a goal
they can actually be achieved and help me understand it. let's not do that to each other in this conversation. it is
too important.
Councillor Zondervan i will go to you it sounds like i guess one of the questions with answers we want to recess
or adjourn? again the application of that is if we recess the next meeting will be a direct continuation of this
meeting which means no public comments or we adjourn and we come back and we can pick it up where we
left off and have public comment those are the only i believe the only two significant differences with either of
those decisions.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan,chair: thank you mr. chair on happy to make a motion to adjourn once we are ready
for that. i don't think we should recess as we been talking about there's a lot of further public conversation that
needs to happen. i certainly don't want to avoid the public comment in our next meeting. i want to agree with
you wholeheartedly. i'd don't question any of my colleagues intentions. i don't doubt that we understand the
challenges that we face with climate crisis. i do think that their commercial interests were protecting
themselves. that is their job. we need to have that conversation as was said at the end of the day with design
which way with we want to go on this that is our job. our responsibility. i'm perfectly happy to have a hearing
on this in Councillor Nolan's committee i think it would be great. i do want also point out that in the ordinance
committee routinely developers make presentations to us about their projects. there is nothing preventing us
from inviting building owners and developers to come to the next hearing and make a presentation. about their
concerns and questions and again we can have conversations off-line as well about any concerns that they have
about it. i look forward to those conversations. regardless of the outcome we are all learning and growing on
this issue by having those conversations.
>> vice mayor mallon: thank you mr. chair was also going to throw my support behind adjourning rather than
recessing that seems like that is a motion on the table. i will yield back.
>> Marc C. McGovern,chair: i would say Councillor Zondervan i think you're right. i think we did have another
ordinance committee meeting can have harvard mit or whoever come. i would prefer to do it in another
committee just so the weekend what comes back ordinance might be the same amendment in my that's going to
be up you guys to which you file might be different slabs of presentations in ordinance and then there's not a lot
of time to discuss it and do the work so i think do that work in the subcommittee bring it to ordinance ready to
go and there may be nothing to change i don't know. we're sort of correct me if i'm wrong Councillor Zondervan
we are scheduling as for meeting today we are scheduling ordinance committee meetings out until the end of
march. at this point. so there is not a ton of time for a little bit of time you can even have more than one
meeting.

Please introduce a Policy Order for Moving Van regulations in areas with no
loading/parking zone

Dear Mayor, City Councilors and City Clerk
I am submitting a communication for the April 4th City Council meeting requesting the City Council direct the City
Manager to create regulations for moving van parking in the areas where there are no loading or parking zone due to
the implementation of the Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) such as
•
•
•

northbound Mass Ave from Dudley Street to Alewife Brook Parkway
eastbound Mass Ave from Trowbridge Street to Inman Street
potentially on Mass Ave from Beech Street to Roseland as CSO measures are implemented in that area

In a couple of months, students from local colleges/universities will be moving out at the end of the school year. Worse
yet, at the end of August/beginning of September, there will be the usual influx of students. Please plan in advance and
put into effect a workable plan so that students do not have to park blocks away and carry their belongings to/from their
residences.
Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully your,
Young Kim

Unknown woman killed by truck in Porter Square, and rest of project area

Dear Council members and city staff,
About 25 years ago, my husband and I were out walking with our newborn baby. We came across a woman who had
been hit by a tractor trailer and was lying in the roadway of Somerville Ave at Porter Sq, right next to the crosswalk, as I
recall. This Harvard Crimson article describes the heartbreaking incident we saw.
I have been wondering not only about who this poor Cambridge woman was and why she and her death seem to have
been forgotten, but how the city can possibly, in good conscience, consider not providing strong protection around that
corner/point around the Porter Sq. T. Somerville Ave going E from Mass Ave. is so obviously a terribly unprotected "bike
lane" along a key biking route.
I would hope and expect that this woman's dying in this way will lead to design that will prevent cyclists from dying in
that same spot. Steel, concrete, or other equally protective bollards or other protection there will keep cyclists
protected AND make motor vehicles drive and turn more carefully, making conditions safer for all.
The rest of the project area
Just as that critical corner should, obviously, be protected, so should the rest of the Porter Sq CSO project area and rest
of Mass Ave be. At the recent Lesley open house, I saw in more detail the city's plans NOT to provide protected bike
lanes in almost half of the Porter Sq project area. It feels almost like the city is waiting to have another pedestrian or
cyclist killed by a motor vehicle before providing the safer infrastructure cyclists and others have been begging -- and
voting -- for, and which is now legally required. Cambridge staff speak publicly about enabling people from 8-80 to be
able to bike safely, but without a clear network of protected bike lanes, that is not viable.
Please rectify your plans and enable continuously-protected bike lanes by
1) moving HP accessible parking spots to the first spots on side streets
2) using floating bus stops even for quick- and medium-build projects
3) figuring out how to maintain bike lanes that are narrower than the 7' we'd all like them to have. Of any city,
Cambridge can solve this problem; using the excuse of a lane being narrower than ideal to refuse to provide protected
bike lanes is probably not legal and is certainly life-threatening. Please don't do it.
Thank you
I hope you are proud of your work creating this bike (and bus) infrastructure.
I know you feel under a lot of pressure from many corners. But you probably don't hear from the many people I talk to
who are very proud and excited to live or work in Cambridge because of this great new infrastructure! They have no idea
about the echo chambers in which people are railing against the bus and bike lanes. Instead, they logically assume that
these lanes represent logical progress and they are very excited to see them spread into reliable networks. And these
people vote, as we have repeatedly seen.

Death of a Homeless Man in Harvard Square!

Peace Be unto You
Dear City Manager please add the following item to the upcoming City Council Agenda as a Communication. Thank you.:
Local social-political leadership,etc., guilty of homeless person's death,still turning blinded eye to the future wellbeing of
homeless citizens!
Peace Be Unto You,
Dear Cambridge, etc., a tragic thing has happened and passed by without the greater population at large being aware of
it. It was the death of a Homelessman, found dead on the pavement of the City of Cambridge, MA. The man's name was
'Michael, according to some resources. In November of 2021, his body was found face-first on the cold cement in
Harvard Square. No next of kin stepped forward, leaving him nameless.
Check out this story on wickedlocal.com:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/cambridge-chronicletab/2022/03/23/har__;!!GolgDdAAPFHvrrz0!L23sRjqoKwBkJDNAsODOj1vVYBWCJAxVPPjFISRvsYYnH9RbidscuoY0fR_1UP9ZCacAQo$ ....
He supposedly died Nov. 18, 2021 in Harvard Square Bank of America entry way.
Resources in the Wicked Local article say he was fond of eating out of a free community refrigerator at Massachusetts
Avenue and Church Street in front of the Universal Unitarian Church. The refrigerator was moved from Church Street
next to the Sinclaire Night Club to its current location at Mass. Ave., and Church Street. I wrote to the then Cambridge
health board director Claude Jacobs, and others including city officials, health officials at the Cambridge Health Alliance
Hospital., and I told them that the free food refrigerator was a bad idea, a public health hazard, and a disaster waiting to
happen. It still is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode again. The public and health officials didn't seem to be
interested in how explosive I thought that refrigerator would be if left in existance. The dead homeless person it is
reported was fond of eating out of it. Earlier my attention was brought to an article that reported how a man out west
was poisoning food in a similar free food refrigerator for fun, just to see homeless people die from the poisonous food
items in it.
I think that there is a great possibility that Michael, as he was called, was poisoned out of that free food fridge, and
dropped dead in front of the bank at Harvard Square. The blame for his death can be shared by many, such as the
Harvard Square political, economic, religious leadership in failing to unite, in providing a better life for the local
homelessness sector and mosaic. After my concerns were delivered to the elected and health officials the free food
fridge was moved from next to club Sinclaire to in front of the Universalist Unitarian Church. The leadership community
turned a blinded eye to my concerns about that free food fridge, and now a homeless man is dead, the food in the fridge
is among the things that are suspected in causing his death. I feel that our local social-political leadership,etc., are guilty
of that homeless person's death, and are still turning a blinded eye when it comes to the wellbeing of our population's
homeless citizens and residents. Shame on you all, you are guilty of murder. More of these questionable deaths of our
homeless neighbors can happen in the future. Homelessness is a public health issue that can be successfully addressed
by the powers that be, but unfortunately the crisis is growing by the hour.

Perez, Lori

I have attached (SEE BELOW) somewhat of a history of this matter and how I failed to get our leaders to see the dangers
of the existence of such a dangerous health hazard to remain in existence in Harvard Square and elsewhere in the
Cambridge, Massachusetts region.
1). Who was Harvard Square's 'Michael?'
Susanne BeckWicked Local
Despite his cadre of supporters, most who passed through Harvard Square were never aware of a man known as
Michael or his daily life that unfolded in full view of each of them. They were equally oblivious when he died Nov. 18,
2021 in the Bank of America entryway.
Kody Christiansen, a Harvard Extension School student, was among the first to find Michael lying face-first on the
sidewalk, before the bank’s front door early the next morning. Just days before, Christiansen had offered Michael a
blanket at the shelter.
Christiansen called 911.
The unhoused of Cambridge
The unhoused of Cambridge become the familiar faces we pass on the street, sitting quietly along the edges of buildings
or perching, often slumping, on available benches. Some have hand-lettered pleas for help, with jars for donations. A
few huddle behind makeshift shelters. Too often, they become fixtures, not human beings, mostly without names.
These are the more visible of Cambridge’s unhoused: People of all ages who are designated as such because they are in
transitional housing, emergency shelters or living on the streets. Cambridge’s 2019 census classifies 555 people as
unhoused - a number that has fluctuated only slightly in recent years – a small fraction of the city’s population.
Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise Jillson helped establish a small memorial for Michael
after his death in November.
The story of Harvard Square's 'Michael’
Michael – whose last name is still unknown - was one of those people, an unassuming man who often slept near St.
Paul’s Parish on Mount Auburn Street or sat outside the Bank of America branch in Harvard Square. He rarely asked for
anything from anyone.
Denise Jillson, the Harvard Square Business Association executive director, first met Michael in the spring of 2020 as she
was stocking a community pandemic-prompted refrigerator located near The Sinclair on Church Street.
More:Cambridge Black Trailblazers: Elizabeth 'Betty' Rawlings
“I pulled up with my car and started unloading the groceries and he would come and help me. Never said much,” she
said. “He never said much to anybody. He was really a very quiet guy.”
While they never exchanged many words, Jillson picked up on Michael’s preferences –his own version of comfort foods and tried to accommodate him.
“He liked the cheese and crackers, and he liked the peanut butter,”
she said, “[so] I would always make sure I got that stuff for him.”
Jillson wasn’t the only one looking after Michael.
“People gave him shoes all the time,” Jillson said, “and he would just lose them. It was like, ‘Michael, how could you
possibly lose shoes?
Like, how is that possible?’ And he was like, ‘Oh, you know, I don't know.’”

3.4.a

A group of HSBA members also pitched in for a belt.
“The only belt that we could find [because he was a large guy] was from a shoe repair,” Jillson said. “It was very
expensive.”
That soon disappeared as well.
Christiansen, a formerly unhoused person, was familiar with Michael.
The pair would cross paths at the Harvard Square Shelter - where Christiansen volunteers and where Michael
occasionally visited.
“He never stayed,” Christiansen said. “But he would come to the door sometimes to get warm meals or blankets or
whatever.”
Christiansen said he mostly knew him from the street.
Kody Christiansen, a Harvard Extension School student, was among the first to find Michael lying prone, face-first on the
sidewalk.
“I would see him when I would walk to class, be at a coffee shop, or on the way to the shelter. And he always reminded
me of Santa, because of his big bushy, white beard."
‘It’s heart-wrenching'
Streetside deaths are an unusual occurrence, especially in as well-traveled an intersection as Harvard Square. But
relative to the state as a whole, death rates for those who live on the street are high. A 2018 study by the Journal of the
American Medical Association notes unhoused adults sleeping on the streets were almost three times more likely to die
than those in shelters. The rate skyrocketed to nearly 10-fold when compared to the adult population of the state. The
most common reasons for death: Cancer and heart disease.
Councilor Marc McGovern recently chaired a working group to address some of the issues facing those without a
permanent home. The report, “Addressing Homeless in Cambridge," released in January, is an update of a 2016 effort.
McGovern said the 2022 version includes some new initiatives, although many of the recommendations are leftover –
undone - from six years ago.
More:Mental health the focus as Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Cambridge Public Hospital
“We sort of started with a fresh look …but you know, not a lot has changed in the sense that people [continue to be]
unhoused for very different reasons. So you need different approaches.”
For some, that means preventative measures to avoid eviction whether due to loss of income, health issues or other
matters. For others, it’s about securing permanent shelter and necessary support services – from employment to mental
health to simple things like an identification card – to ensure they remain there. One area of particular focus is better
integration of services, in the city, the region, and between the city and state.
“We're resource-rich and access poor [in Cambridge],” McGovern said, “a bunch of dots with no lines…We have all these
programs, but are [they]coordinated? Are they talking to each other?”
There is no clear indication yet when – or even if – the task force recommendations will be adopted. McGovern is hoping
to schedule a committee meeting within weeks to start the conversation. Still, as always, many of the proposals will
come down to money - what McGovern calls the “multi-million-dollar question.”

More:Inman Incubator gives artists a chance to show their goods in Cambridge

There is also nothing in the report addressing individuals like Michael who, for whatever reason, steer clear of shelters
and many forms of support.
“There's not a whole lot you can do,” McGovern said. “Unless someone is mentally unstable [and the police can use]
Section 12 and get them off the street for a couple of days against their will. It’s heart-wrenching.”
More:Cambridge recruiting community members to vet city manager applicants
Remembering, mourning Michael
Michael’s story is still unfolding. Jillson organized a memorial in December, including a tribute posted on a tree just
outside the BOA branch, and organized a service featuring The Boys of St. Paul's Choir School. Christiansen wrote a
poem.
But with no discernible identity other than a first name, and as yet, no known next of kin, Michael is a ward of the state,
turned over to the commonwealth’s Medical Examiner's Office following an investigation.
Jillson and her membership bemoan the limbo-like state.
“When they found out that we couldn't take possession of him because he's not been identified, it was jarring,” Jillson
said, “because I think people feel responsible for laying him to rest. So now what happens?”
A small memorial has been set up outside the Bank of America for Michael in Harvard Square.
Tim Keefe, the funeral director of Cambridge’s Keefe Funeral Homes, has offered his services to provide cremation free
of charge.
“We are obviously here to help the community,” Keefe said. “I mean this guy - although he may not have any direct
family - he affected a lot of people.” He added, “I think it's important for them to have closure as well.”
For her part, Jillson continues to keep an eye out for Michael and remains committed to ensuring that wherever and
whenever he is finally laid to rest, it is with the same quiet dignity with which he led his life.
“Our tagline [at HBSA] is taking care of the Square and that means taking care of the physical, outside public space and
the people in it,” she said. “Regardless of who those people are.

Dear Mr. Jacobs, perhaps you and your office heard of the outdoor Fridge and Pantry located on Church Street, right in
front of the Sinclair NightClub. I feel and I know others do too, that this is a potentially dangerous health hazard.
Perishable food is moving in and out of that location, without any official health inspection measures being taken.
Anyone can stop by it and drop off food items, at any time of the day or night, The food is at risk of being poisoned by
some lunatic with a vendetta to be carry out against the homeless,ect., that take and eat food items from that location. I

think the health department should step in and do something to protect the members of the public that take
uninspected food items from that place. There is nothing right about that place, it is a public health issue. It's not safe
and it's a public health violation. You must do something to protect the eaters out of it, hopefully you'll be able to
protect and save the lives of homeless peoples,etc., whose conditions have forced them to take and eat food from
there.
I have posted in this email, an article I had added to the City Council agenda a week ago, also had posted on my blog at

CCTV'S Human Service News and Information TV/Blog Alert and Update; Homeless Fridge and Pantry Harvard Square!
The “Fridge and Pantry on Church Street in Harvard Square, is it a Bad Idea or not?
Posted on: 10 April 2021 By: HRASHID
What happens when poisonous,unsanitary, and polluted food items find their way into the fridge and pantry? What
happens if homeless people start getting sick or begin dying from eating food that they have taken from there? What
guarantees that the food taken from that location and source is safe? Has the Board of Health certified that the fridge
and pantry is safe for human food consumption? Even though it’s good that people give food to the homeless, I think it
might be a bad idea when you look at the possible harm that can arise from its use and being designated as a safe source
of food for the homeless.
There are alot of people out there that hate the homeless, and that will jump at every opportunity to do them harm and
wrongs. That fridge and pantry is such an opportunity. There is no guarantee that the food at that location will continue
to be safe for human consumption by the homeless. Think about it.

Man sentenced for poisoning 8 California homeless people A man who poisoned eight homeless people in a Southern

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- A man who poisoned eight homeless people in a Southern California beach town so he
could videotape their reactions was sentenced Friday to four years in state prison.
William Cable, 38, of San Andreas in Northern California, was sentenced after pleading guilty to poisoning, injuring an
elderly person, and other felony and misdemeanor charges, according to the Orange County district attorney's office.
Prosecutors said that last May, Cable gave homeless people in Huntington Beach food laced with oleoresin capsicum,
which officials described as being twice as strong as pepper spray used by police.
Some victims were told they were participating in a “spicy food challenge” and others were not, authorities said. Some
were given other food and beer to get them to eat the poisoned food.

“They were exploited and poisoned as part of a twisted form of entertainment, and their pain was recorded so that it
could be relived by their attacker over and over again,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in June after
Cable was criminally charged.
Cable could have faced more than 19 years in prison if he had been convicted at trial.

Mr. Lipson, thank you for responding. Your response represents that there is actually someone out there in a high office
that cares about the health and well being of our most vulnerable residents and citizens. I sent you an email on the 28th
of April, 2021, it must have gotten lost in the shuffle. That open fridge and cupboard is the work of a terrible mindset.
There is nothing lawful about it. If left to stand it could hurt a number of innocent people. Especially if the Sinclair
NightClub next door is ever open again. That night club is inhabited by a wild intoxicated bunch, and there is no telling
what they might do to that location on a night out full of intoxicating spirits. There are other dangers that could threaten
the location, both heath and non health related. I know it was a mistake, and I believe they know it as well at City Hall.
Thanks again for your concern and with it perhaps we can actually help the homelessness sector and mosaic.

Wednesday, March 30, 2022 2:12 AM
City Clerk
Hasson Rashid
A Statement on the Start of Ramadan 2022: And Ramadan allows us to really put our
priorities in place.

Dear City Clerk, please add the following item to the upcoming City council agenda, as a Communication item. Thank
you:
When is Ramadan 2022? Muslims around the world will observe Ramadan and fast from sunrise until sundown for a
month. The first day of fasting for the holy month of Ramadan is likely to be Saturday, April 2. To establish the beginning
of Ramadan, which is determined by the sighting of the new moon, Saudi Arabia and other Muslim-majority countries
rely on the testimonies of moon sighters.This year will see the return of pilgrims in full numbers for the Umrah
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina after two years of COVID-19 restrictions, as Saudi Arabia lifted most restrictions just
ahead of Ramadan Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are all expected to follow Saudi
Arabia’s sighting of the new moon. Other countries have independent sightings, but Indonesia, Lebanon, Morocco and
Syria are also likely to begin fasting starting Saturday, while countries further east and west will commence as the moon
is sighted.
According to Crescent Moon Watch, a moon tracker run by the United Kingdom’s Nautical Almanac Office, Ramadan’s
new moon will arrive on April 1 at 06:24 GMT. On that day, the moon might be visible in parts of North, Central, and
South America. On April 2, the moon will be easily visible in most parts of the world.The actual visibility of the crescent
will depend on factors such as atmospheric conditions, cloudiness and the distance between the sun and the moon on
the horizon. The moon phases of Ramadan Lunar months last between 29 and
30 days, depending on the sighting of the new moon on the 29th night of each month. If the new moon is not visible, the
month lasts 30 days. Muslims believe that Ramadan is the month in which the first verses of the Quran were revealed to
the Prophet Muhammad more than
1,400 years ago.Throughout the month, observing Muslims fast from just before the sunrise, or Fajr, prayer to the
sunset prayer, Maghrib.
Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayers, charity, and
performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca if physically and financially capable. In many Muslim-majority countries,
working hours are reduced, and many restaurants are closed during fasting hours. Languages from various Muslim
majority nations have a personalised greeting in their native languages. “Ramadan Mubarak” and “Ramadan Kareem”
are common greetings exchanged in this period, wishing the recipient a blessed and generous month respectively. Last
year, fasting across the world ranged from 10 to 20 hours a day. At the end of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr. In
Arabic, it means “festival of breaking the fast.”
Depending on the new moon sighting, Eid al-Fitr this year is likely to fall on May 2.

Ramadan Prep: Let the Hearts Submit
With Dr. Omar Suleiman

Packet Pg. 107

The heart is the beginning and the end of everything that we do because the intention is the beginning and end of
everything that we do. And so it's important for us to go back to our heart and to think about what submission of the
heart looks like. Allah has said that all of the deeds of the child of Adam are for him except for fasting.
Fasting is for me, and I reward accordingly.
That’s because fasting is the deed of sincerity. Allah sees us at all times. We could secretly break away and break our
fast, but we maintain our fast because Allah is watching us, and that's what makes it the ultimate act of sincerity. That's
what makes it the ultimate act of Taqwa, of God consciousness and piety.
So what goes into having a pure heart? The first part of this is to submit your heart to the revelation. It is a heart that is
free of disbelief, a heart that is free of a heart that is free of hesitation, of discomfort with what Allah has revealed. It
knows that what Allah has revealed is true and that is the standard that it must submit to.
It’s not going to try to change it or adjust it. The very beginning is the acknowledgement of Allah’s perfection and your
imperfection. And then it's the journey of climbing through your imperfections to reach the standard of perfection,
knowing that you will die trying because no one of us will ever reach perfection. It’s continually seeking the mercy of
Allah, the forgiveness of Allah, and continuing to push yourself to do better to meet the standard.
The second part of this is submitting your heart by removing from it any ill will or hatred towards the creation of Allah.
Your heart cannot be at peace or in submission to Allah if it carries ill-will, envy, hatred, pride or arrogance.
And the third part of this is submitting your heart to Allah completely. You do not condition your love of Allah with
something of this dunya. So removing any conditions from your heart for your love.
Allah, I love you. I love you no matter what. And Ramadan allows us to really put our priorities in place. And when we
have our priorities in place and we put the pleasure of Allah above all other things, then our hearts submit to that. Our
hearts are in connection to Allah and nothing of this world can sever the connection of that heart to Allah.

Strong support for green new deal and accurate fossil fuel building accounting

Hello,
I am writing to express my strong support for adopting stronger measures to fight the climate
crisis. In particular, please adopt the amendments to better account for the fossil fuel emissions
in building construction and ongoing maintenance:
Emissions Accounting Zoning Amendment because we must calculate the impact of new
buildings honestly
Beudero GND Amendment to make the new buildings pay for the emissions in their construction
and upkeep

Residents Alliance supports Climate Crisis WG recommendations
CResA support letter for CCWG Climate recs.docx

4/4/22
Dear Mayor and City Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in support of the recommendations in the report from the
Climate Crisis Working Group. We hope these recommendations will be referred to a hearing by one of the
Council’s committees, so that speedy implementation can be discussed.
These are the key recommendations from the report:
1. Strengthen, implement BEUDO Amendments Performance Requirements: Shorten the timeline for net zero,
ensure the highest alternative payment is required, bring outliers’ emissions down faster.
2. Cambridge Community Electricity Program (CCE):
1) The CDD should either increase the default (standard) Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) to 80%

Dear Mayor and City Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in support of the recommendations in
the report from the Climate Crisis Working Group. We hope these recommendations will
be referred to a hearing by one of the Council’s committees, so that speedy implementation
can be discussed.
These are the recommendations from the report:
1. Strengthen, implement BEUDO Amendments Performance Requirements: Shorten the
timeline for net zero, ensure the highest alternative payment is required, bring outliers’
emissions down faster.
2. Cambridge Community Electricity Program (CCE):
1) The CDD should either increase the default (standard) Renewable Portfolio
Standards (RPS) to 80% renewable, or copy Lexington’s model of a standard offer at 100%
renewables not in New England, and an opt-up option of 100% renewables in New
England.
2) Follow Boston’s example by using CCE to opt-in low income households to
develop new clean energy sources and simultaneously reduce energy burden for low
income households without outlay on the part of the City.
3. Solar: City should invest in a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA), expand
community solar. All City properties should utilize on-site solar power generation.
Additionally, City meters should be enrolled in the Community Shared Solar (CSS), which
would both save money and increase energy efficiency of municipal properties.

Re: Petition signed by over 1,050 names requesting changes to the Cycling Safety
Ordinance Please Submit as a Communication For City Council Meeting

To City Council, and City Manager:
I want to thank Council Member Patty Nolan for initiating discussion of the petition sent in by Save Mass Ave at last
Mondays' Council Meeting, Mayor Siddiqui's decision to refer the petition to Council Member Burhan as head
of the transportation committee was very disappointing. The biggest obstacle to finding a solution is that the
City is looking at the Cycling Safety Ordinance as a transportation issue. It is not just a redesign of roads and
how people commute. It is much bigger than that.
How our roads are designed affect much more than transportation. It is accessibility for disabled,
handicapped, elderly and everyone else that needs cars and parking. It is preserving neighborhoods, and quiet
safe streets. It is economic: supporting small businesses, keeping people employed, supporting diverse
businesses including ones that are women and minority owned. It is ensuring medical access to dentist,
doctors, and therapist. It is helping industries hard hit by the pandemic and the lock downs including
restaurants, and service industries. It is economic and feasibility studies. It is store owners that have their
savings and livelihoods wrapped up in their businesses.
This is the ultimate problem with the ordinance, it is focusing just on transportation, and was given to the
Department of Transportation and Public Works to implement. It needs to look at Cambridge as a whole and
all the stakeholders and the consequences of taking away the parking from 22 miles of Cambridge streets. The
council has talked about unintended consequences. We are asking you to look at who you are affecting and
how they will be affected before you act. The petition asks for a project manager because there are so many
elements involved. Businesses are closing and moving away from North Mass Ave. Accidents on North Mass
Ave, and the adjacent streets are being reported. What happens in one section of the city has consequences
in other sections.
Azeem Burhan's answer to our petition was, and this is a direct quote: " I am not sure what further
conversation would add". The plan presented by the city will remove 100%- 95% of the parking from Mass
Ave between Alewife and Harvard Square if the MBTA's wires are not removed, and 60% - 50% of the parking
even if the wires are removed and construction is used to remove the median. The fact that the council as a
whole is letting this design be considered without addressing the consequences involved shows that the voices
of the voters of Cambridge are not being heard.
Policy Orders have been passed creating an advisory board for future implementations of the bicycle lanes and
requiring economic studies of the effects of removing parking. Neither Policy Order has been acted upon. The
advisory board has not been formed, and the study has been put off until after more parking has been
removed. If these Policy Orders were followed, the City will have more information to create a better

Subject: Please Submit as a Communication For Monday's City Council Meeting March 28: Petition signed by over 1,050
names requesting changes to the Cycling Safety Ordinance
Attached is a petition signed by over 1,050 names requesting changes to the Cycling Safety Ordinance. The supporters
of this petition have been writing, calling, and meeting with city trying to ensure all stakeholders have a voice in the
redesign of Cambridge’s streets. A compromise and solution has yet to be found that will ensure that Small Businesses
can survive, residential neighborhoods will remain free from diverted commercial traffic, and commuters of all modes of
transportation can safely use our roads. There have been policy orders passed that have yet to be acted on, and
community meetings held that have not substantially provided needed parking for our businesses or preserved the quiet
of our neighborhoods. The strict deadlines and requirements of the Cycling Safety Ordinance need to be evaluated and
modified.
We are requesting a City-Wide Project Manager in Charge of implementation. The city is continuing to install over 22
miles of vertically separated bicycle lanes without looking at how these lanes affect the city as a whole. The project
areas divide major roadways into small subsections without regard to how disrupting one roadway affects abutters and
others in the city. Pushing traffic off major commercial ways and onto nearby residential streets does not make our
roads safer. It simply moves the hazards onto other roads, and other populations. Meetings, letters, and calls to the
city are met with a runaround and no solutions, as each Department throws responsibility to another City Department.
There needs to be one responsible Project Manager that has the authority to reach out to the needed city departments
to address concerns. Policy Order #276 was passed on January 10, 2022 requiring the creation of a Cycling Safety
Ordinance Implementation Advisory Committee , with the appointments to be announced no later than January 31,
2022. This Advisory Committee has yet to be named, convened, or allowed to give input. Deadlines written into the
ordinance are approaching. This advisory Committee working with City-Wide Project Manager in Charge of
implementation of the Bicycle lanes needs to be allowed to meet and give input that is actually heeded before
construction continues.
The Petition calls for an Evaluation process with goals and target points set, to be used on new and existing protected
bike lanes. The ordinance required an impact analysis for the Mass Ave 4, and one has been accepted by the city, but it
does not include Financial and Economic impact. The City Council and the City Manager should be requesting this
financial information to be provided as required by the ordinance. A policy order, POR 2022 #29 was passed but it is

targeting the area of Mass Ave between Alewife Brook Parkway and Dudley Street. There are many vertically separated
bicycle lanes that have already been built. Data is already available on the affects the separated bicycle lanes have on
our businesses and residents. This data needs to be compiled and used quickly before more construction is completed.
Shared Parking that protects residents’ ability to park on their streets and also lets others use available spaces during
daytime hours needs to be developed. If shared parking programs can allow Business owners, employees to park on
nearby streets it would help to compensate for some removal of parking spaces. Short term stopping for 15 to 30
minutes does not help patients of doctors, dentists and therapists, or other people needing services. Shared parking
may help these patients retain access to medical and other service providers.
We support the businesses and neighborhoods that rely on Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a plan
for the city that will Improve Safety for everyone, will help Traffic flow, preserve Parking and support Public
Transportation and Businesses. If the Cycling Safety Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the
ordinance needs to be changed.

Parking minimums (Transportation Committee Hearing 4/5/2022)

Councilors Azeem, McGovern, Nolan, Toner, and Zondervan,
My name is Andrew Ray, and I live in Mid-Cambridge near Central Square. I am writing to urge you to give an affirmative
recommendation on the proposed removal of parking minimums in Cambridge. Parking minimums make our city less
friendly for pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit riders, artificially inflate the costs of living and running a business in
Cambridge, and encourage more people to rely on personal cars, TNC services, and taxis. I note that the presentation to
the committee includes a good deal of speculation about possible effects of this order, and while I recognize the value in
considering all possibilities, I would encourage you to look at what has happened in other cities that have eliminated
parking minimums. These cities have not reported any significant downsides, and have not seen a significant number of
complaints. I submitted the following arguments for inclusion in the agenda packet for the February 28 City Council
meeting, but I understood that there was an issue distributing packets that day, so I will repeat them here:
Requiring developers to provide parking that residents and business owners don't need makes this city less friendly to
pedestrians. As somebody who does not own a car, large parking lots act as a barrier to access. During the pandemic, I
have on several occasions walked from Alewife station to the Fresh Pond Reservation for exercise. Along this walk is the
Fresh Pond Mall, a strip of several stores behind a large (and half-empty) parking lot. Even though I walk right by the
stores, I have never considered stopping in because of the inconvenience of crossing the lot. It is to our city's credit that
there are relatively few places in Cambridge that are built in this way, but this is because most of the city was developed
before parking minimums were introduced. (For an example of an area developed after the introduction of parking
minimums, we need only look to South Boston's Seaport District.)
To some extent, the access issues posed by parking lots can be mitigated by putting parking in a garage, but doing so
greatly increases the expense of construction, leading to higher prices for both residential and commercial units. Indeed,
even surface lots increase the cost of construction per unit. If we truly care about reducing the cost of housing in the
city, parking minimums for residential properties should be an easy target. Not all Cambridge residents own cars, and
not all need a parking space, yet many people (myself included) pay for a parking space because it is included with their
apartment, whether or not they need it. As an example of this, my apartment building has a side parking lot with
approximately 25 spaces (as well as an underground garage). I regularly walk past the lot on Sunday mornings (when few
people are out and about), and have not recently observed more than four cars in the entire lot, suggesting that it is
likely at least a dozen of these spaces are paid for by people, including me, who do not use them. The American Planning
Association has estimated that a parking space can increase the price of a housing unit by as much as 17% [1].
Cambridge would not be the first city in the US, nor even the first in New England, to eliminate parking minimums. The
city of Hartford, Connecticut eliminated mandatory parking minimums citywide in 2017, two years after eliminating
minimums downtown, becoming the second US city to do so after Buffalo, New York [2]. Strong Towns reported in 2018
that there were only a few complaints over the rule change in Hartford [3], which was prompted in part by a joint study
from the University of Connecticut and the State Smart Transportation Initiative that found that the city lost out on an
average of $1200 in tax revenue in 2013 for each parking space in the city. The same study also looked at parking in
Cambridge. Because Cambridge has less downtown parking and higher taxes on parking infrastructure, the lost tax
revenue is lower here, but the study still estimated that the city missed out on approximately $1 million in tax revenue
in 2013 due to the presence of downtown parking (as opposed to other uses) [4].

Finally, consider that car-oriented infrastructure begets cars. Parking minimums make it difficult to promote public
transit and biking and are a threat to transit-oriented development projects [5], because the nature of minimums is to
encourage car ownership and car dependency. If not eliminated, parking minimums will continue to hamper the city's
ability to reduce emissions and meet the targets of the city's Climate Action Plan (in particular, section 5.3.1, which
defines a target for shifting more than 75% of private vehicle trips to other modes of transportation by 2050).
Please give an affirmative recommendation on this order and support pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, business
owners, and residents in Cambridge.
Yours sincerely and respectfully,
Andrew Ray

Please keep parking mandates in place for new housing

This message is for the city’s Transportation Committee in regards to the discussion about removing parking minimums
from the zoning code that takes place on Tuesday, April 5.
I am writing to request that parking mandates remain in place for every new unit of housing. Removal of this mandate
will not make housing more affordable, and make Cambridge a less desirable place to live.

In Support of Ordinance #2022-8

Good morning council,
As a renter at 266 Western Ave, I believe that parking minimums should be eliminated for all future development in
Cambridge and I believe this even as someone who owns a car in Cambridge and uses on-street parking.
The triple decker I live in was built in 1895 and was built with no space for off street parking. I'm incredibly grateful that
structures like these have been built all across Cambridge because it has allowed me and countless others to live in this
community and make it what it is today. However, this community would be very different that had housing been built in
1895 according to present day zoning practices. If my lot were to be developed today, it would not be able to house even
a third of the current residents in part due to the parking minimums.
However, I recognize I speak from a place of privilege because the reality is that there are many people who cannot afford
to live in Cambridge partly because the production of housing could not keep up with the economic growth and
subsequent demand for housing. Therefore, we need to remove the chokehold on housing production that is parking
minimums. The people who can afford to live in Cambridge and own a car, like myself, are not entitled to have easy
access to street parking, especially at the expense of housing more residents in our community.
Thank you and I hope you will vote for a proposal that will limit parking minimums in the future.

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, March 29th, 2022 the School Committee held a meeting to discuss the FY 2023 budget
adjustments. Based on previous discussions, three adjustments were made to the FY 2023 Proposed
Budget. These changes reflect adjustments and do not change the total amount for the Proposed Budget.
The three adjustments include a part-time Assistant Program Manager to the Family Engagement Office
and the addition of a 4th SEL social worker at CRLS. The budget will also reallocate $50,000 to design
and implement a BRYT program that meets the needs of upper school students.
On Thursday, March 24th, 2022 the School Committee held a public hearing on the FY 2023 Proposed
Budget. The Committee heard public comments, some highlighting the enthusiasm for increased hours for
family liaisons and a desire for more Spanish language programs. The School Committee will vote on the
budget Tuesday, April 5th, 2022.
King Open Principal Darrell Williams has been appointed Interim Chief Talent Officer, effective next
Monday, April 4. Assistant Principal Waleska Landing Rivera will serve as acting Principal of King
Open. The search process for a permanent Chief Talent Officer will begin soon.
MCAS testing will begin in April. Every spring, students across the state participate in the Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS), which are tests that measure the degree to which students
are learning the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks relative to the expectations for each grade level.
Federal and state law require that all students in grades 3 through 8 take the MCAS in English Language
Packet Pg. 142

5.2

Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. Students in grades 5 and 8 must also take it in Science, Technology &
Engineering (STE). There will be no negative impact to students based on their MCAS results or a
family’s refusal to participate. The state uses MCAS participation rates and results in its accountability
system to identify schools and/or districts in need of support. CPS uses a range of assessment tools to
understand student progress and areas of need. This year, our 5th and 8th grade students are part of an
opportunity to pilot a new science assessment, which includes activities featuring interactive science
simulations. These simulations allow students to conduct investigations, create and explore models and
solve science or engineering problems using scenarios featuring real-life problems. The goal of the pilot is
to gather initial information and feedback that will help create an engaging, equitable and innovative test
in future years. There are no scores attached to participation in the pilot.
Last weekend, I was thrilled to attend the CRLS festival play, “Sorry, Wrong Number.” I was also
delighted to attend a scholarship presentation by the ACE Mentor Program of Greater Boston for
RSTA’s Kaliab Tale, who received a $15,000 scholarship! The ACE Mentor Program of Greater Boston
offers students the opportunity to delve deeper and learn more about the architecture, construction, and
engineering industries. Also, I was delighted to roll on some skates and attended the “Rollin' and Summer
Resource Fair”, a program conceptualized by The Village (Caregiver University) by Cambridge
caregivers of color. The goal of this resource fair was to assist Cambridge families with students in K-8 to
get ready for the summer and provide information around different opportunities for the summer.
CRLS is excited to share that students Masato Hall, Mehelet Asnake, and Farai Sundai competed in the
Semi-Final National Chinese Speech Contest earlier this month. The students successfully advanced to
the Finals along with Amy Zhou who will advance to the finals in the Heritage group. The Finals will
take place remotely on April 9th. Additionally, four CRLS Seniors were named as 2022 National Merit
Scholarship Finalists. Christopher Dante Ashih, Felix S. Prasanna, Pratyush Saahil Venkatakrishnan, and
Claire Wang were selected among 16,000 Semifinalists based on their academic performance. They will
now go on to compete for 7,500 National Merit Scholarships worth nearly $30 million.
The next regular School Committee meeting is on Tuesday, April 5. Please do not hesitate to reach out
with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.

Communicating a Report from the Climate Crisis Working Group

To the Honorable, the City Council,
Please see the attached final report from the Climate Crisis Working Group (CCWG). The CCWG was
convened by Mayor Siddiqui, with Councillor Nolan as chair, to build on Cambridge’s climate work, with
the goal of increasing the urgency and impact of that work and providing policy guidance on how
Cambridge can better address this crisis. From September through December 2021, the CCWG convened
to discuss Cambridge’s citywide climate goals, projects, and plans, and ultimately decided on several
recommendations for the City to increase the impact of certain environmental initiatives.
The CCWG identified the need for a culture shift across the city in order to be more effective at
addressing the climate crisis and achieving our goals. We are extremely appreciative of the members of
the working group for their support, time, and thoughtful suggestions on how we can make Cambridge a
climate leader. Our hope is that this document is not just another report; rather, that these
recommendations will spur meaningful and radical change as the climate crisis grows more urgent each
day.
For next steps, it is expected that the Health and Environment Committee will call a meeting soon to
present this report to the public and move this conversation forward. Thank you all for your time and
efforts toward this endeavor.
Sincerely,

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui

This report is dedicated to the hundreds of Cambridge residents who have
worked over the years to push Cambridge to address the climate crisis in a
meaningful way. From convening climate congresses and plenaries and seminars
to volunteering hundreds of hours engaging in thoughtful comprehensive
educational efforts to strong and forceful advocacy, these residents have
consistently worked to make the city a leader. Some people have been writing
and speaking for decades, others for far shorter. All share a passion for change,
a conviction that Cambridge must stand up and be a role model, and a deepseated and growing concern about the implication for our city (and the world)
of our lack of progress in reducing emissions and mitigating the impact of the
already changed and changing climate. The crisis is with us; it is accelerating.
The CCWG seeks to accelerate Cambridge’s effectiveness in climate action and
become a leader in impact, not only intent. The CCWG honors all the work that
has been done and the people who demand greater urgency and bold action.

5.3.a

The Climate Crisis Working Group was
convened by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui
with Councillor Patty Nolan to build on
the city’s work on climate. The main
goal of the group is to increase the
urgency of our climate actions and
the impact of that work by providing
guidance on how Cambridge can better
address the climate crisis. The need for
greater urgency was made exceedingly
clear by the recent Net Zero Action
Plan 5-year Impact Evaluation Report,
released in December of 2020, which
concluded that the City will have to
accelerate emissions reductions
twentyfold over the next ten years in
order to meet our goals. That sobering
assessment means immediate action
is needed. Despite more than twenty
years of climate efforts, with multiple
worthy initiatives, citywide greenhouse
gas emissions have remained relatively
unchanged since 2003. Though
some of this can be accounted for in
Cambridge’s growth, other entities
with similar expansion have had some
success in reducing emissions. It was
time to take stock and see if a group
of relative outsiders - most of whom
had not been directly involved in city
climate efforts - could come up with
some useful ideas.

2

Our goal was to provide input and
guidance to the City Council and the
administration by reviewing climate
work within the city, building on existing
efforts, consulting with community

advocates, and soliciting input from the
group members. The working group
sought to identify ways to accelerate
progress and develop a list of targeted
actions for the City to implement. From
the beginning, the goal was to make
sure the output of the group was not
a report to put on a shelf, but a guide
for a new approach to climate work.
The city has enough reports and lists
of actions to take. We need a culture
shift, and financial investment to match
the need. We see the value added of
the CCWG to the stellar climate work
done over the last two decades is our
willingness to call out and identify
lapses in program implementation,
effectiveness and the general lack
of progress. In response a key
recommendation is to propose a
culture shift.
The CCWG met six times during the
fall of 2021, all remotely due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Find short
meeting summaries below, with
full meeting slides available in the
appendix.
Meeting 1 - September 1, 2021
The first meeting started with a
welcome message and an introduction
of the members. Meeting discussion
covered: an overview of the CCWG’s
goals, a quick review of the City’s
previous climate actions, successes,
and failures, and a discussion of future

Meeting 2 - September 15, 2021
The meeting began with a review of the
CCWG work plan and discussion of any
necessary edits. Then, the rest of the
meeting was devoted to identifying key
actors in Cambridge’s climate goals,
actions they may take, and discussion
ended up centered on the concept
of focusing on potential barriers to
carrying out climate actions.
Meeting 3 - October 13, 2021
During this meeting, the CCWG
reviewed the City’s past and current
climate actions, focusing on where they
succeeded or failed to meet the goals.
The CCWG then reviewed why certain
initiatives succeeded or failed, which
barriers they faced, and brainstormed
ideas to overcome these barriers.
Meeting 4 - October 27, 2021
At this meeting, the discussion started
with a review of the recently released
Net Zero Action Plan 5-Year Report,
then summarized the CCWG’s top
ideas to date. The group discussed and
narrowed down feasible goals to 3-5
ideas, then broke into smaller groups to
create action plans for these ideas.
Meeting 5 - November 17, 2021
At the beginning of this meeting,
the Group reviewed the goals that had
been established at Meeting 4, then
reviewed the Building Energy Use and
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) draft
amendments (with presentations by
city staff and CCWG members) and
discussed reactions. The meeting
3

concluded with compiling a list of
smaller, simpler action items to
complement the main goals.
Meeting 6 - November 30, 2021
The last meeting was largely
devoted to discussing and refining
some recommendations with
acknowledgement that the work was
not done, but that the conceptual
framework of barriers and focus on
ensuring impact was helpful. There was
some discussion of the final product
and next steps.

Cambridge declared a climate
emergency over a decade ago and
has been actively working to address
the climate crisis for more than
twenty years. The city has taken
some important steps, yet is behind
on overall climate goals and has
consistently missed the mark on both
citywide goals and deadlines. CCWG
group members, all of whom have a
strong awareness and understanding
of the climate crisis, believe Cambridge
can and should be a leader on climate
action and climate justice. And the city
is not living up to its potential.

5

Over the course of six meetings,
the CCWG covered a lot of ground
and wrestled with the question of
how to make the extensive climate
work in the city more effective. The
starting point and inspiration for
the CCWG was a sense that the city
is underperforming in terms of its
climate goals, but has the potential to
be a climate leader. Reviewing the data
on citywide climate goals, projects,
and plans leads to the conclusion that
despite a lot of good work, Cambridge
is not doing enough and is not working
effectively or smartly. To date, the city’s
impact on the reduction of citywide
emissions has not been sufficient;
therefore, a critical review of the overall
body of work is warranted, with an
attempt to understand the necessary
change for greater effectiveness. Our
goal was to review the major areas

for potential impact, seek to affect
the sense of urgency, and produce
recommendations for the City.
During the course of our work, three
questions guided our thinking: What
are the city’s greatest successes and
what facilitated them? Where is there
a lack of progress or unmet goals
and how can our understanding of
certain barriers help re-shape the city’s
actions, policies, priorities, and culture?
What can the city do to make more
progress?
The CCWG was formed and members
agreed to serve because of a shared
belief that the city’s efforts have
not been effective enough. The city
administration has many sound plans
and has committed substantial talent
and resources to them. However, we
are still falling behind our targets and
failing to reach our goals. Our central
question asks why, and is there some
way to address that shortcoming - or
is it inevitable given the scope and
scale of the challenge? In some areas
Cambridge has been a leader and used
as a model by other cities and towns. In
other areas other cities and towns are
ahead of Cambridge and can serve as
a model for our future actions.

Cambridge Climate History & Next Steps

The consensus of the group is that
in order to make progress - and for
the CCWG to deliver on the promise
of positive impactful disruption - it is
Packet Pg. 153

critical to avoid the trap of collecting
ideas and creating yet another plan
that, although solidly full of good
ideas and intentions, still does not
move the needle. Cambridge has
many reports and plans related to
climate action including many with
specific action steps and deadlines.
Based on our discussions and work,
the recommendations come at
two levels. First, an overarching
primary recommendation is to
address barriers to success. These
barriers are: the cultural mindset
around climate, lack of funding, an
aversion to mandates, and structural
challenges. The second level of
recommendations are specific
recommendations for actions to take,
many of which are already underway
in the city.
The seven identified recommended
action areas build on existing work
and urge more decisive action, with
accelerated timelines. To sum up the
approach that needs to be taken:
Cambridge - all parts of the city and the
community - needs to act as though
the climate crisis is the emergency
the city declared a decade ago. The
COVID-19 response showed that
rapid change can happen when facing
an emergency, and the city’s recent
response to the affordable housing
situation also provides a model:
direct funding for affordable housing
doubled to over $30 million in the last
two years and almost tripled over the
last decade. It is in keeping with these
6

models of how to act in the face of
an emergency that we present these
recommendations to the City Council.
Without addressing the barriers that
have stymied effective action, progress
will continue to be slower than what
is possible and desired. That means
working to change a mindset that has
contributed to slower progress than is
possible and desired, use mandates
- along with stronger incentives - to
achieve results, and fund climate
efforts commensurate with the need.
The recommended actions to be
taken are feasible, although some
will engender pushback (especially in
terms of timelines and breadth). The
City - both the City Council and the
administration - will have to stand firm if
Cambridge’s climate leadership is to be
asserted.

The original goal of the CCWG was to
be bold and disruptive in coming up
with an action plan which could lead to
impact on the city’s multifaceted and
deep work on climate issues. It was
clear from the first meeting that many
climate actions and steps were already
underway, being discussed, studied,
proposed and/or prioritized by several
groups. For the last twenty years. So
why hasn’t there been more progress?
Of course there are many reasons
that are real: the issue is daunting, the
challenge great and moving the needle
on reducing emissions and changing
the trajectory of climate disaster is
monumentally difficult. However, there
are signals and some evidence that
more progress could have been made
- based on the experience of some
players, notably the city itself in its
operations and two major institutions in
the city - Harvard and MIT. All three of
those entities have reduced emissions
and made more progress towards
meeting climate goals than the city as
a whole.

7

There is something the CCWG
identified that could help: our
value added from our work is a
recommendation to put as much focus
on WHY things haven’t panned out - as
on identifying and prioritizing actions
to take. That approach of directly
addressing the roadblocks and barriers
- in order to understand and remove,
not to dwell on them - has not been

as central to climate work as we think
it should be. The CCWG kept coming
up against the need to identify and
directly address barriers if the city is
to successfully meet the climate crisis
challenge. There are structural barriers
that limit ability to make changes many of which can only be resolved
at the state or even federal level. The
CCWG acknowledges those and
encourages the City administration
and City Council to push for changes
whenever possible to address the
structural barriers at those levels. In
addition to recognizing the importance
of addressing structural barriers, the
CCWG identified three other sets
of barriers that collectively inhibit
effective climate action.
At the heart of the discussions were
two themes: Cambridge needs tangible
results with a focus on environmental
justice, since the climate crisis in all its
manifestations most adversely impacts
vulnerable populations. And a key to
success over the next few years is to
consciously and intentionally address
the barriers the City can affect directly:
Mindset, Mandates and Money.

Identifying & Addressing Barriers to Success

Packet Pg. 155

5.3.a

◊ The acknowledgement of failures is as important as the celebration of
successes.
• Too often, failure to meet goals is not acknowledged, leading to
continuation of a status quo which hasn’t worked.
• Not communicating lapses leads people to not knowing that change
is needed and thus less urgency to adjust actions.
◊ Accountability and oversight are needed. And full transparency.
• Timelines - the City must create a mechanism to monitor deadlines
since climate deadlines have been consistently missed. Adjusting
goals is sometimes necessary, yet deadlines should not be ignored.
And when a goalpost is adjusted, it should be public, which builds
trust.
• Implementation - there should be a way to measure if
implementation occurred as planned, so we can celebrate the
climate successes and adjust when off course.
• Results/outcomes measuring - there should be a centralized system
to monitor and measure results of climate initiatives in more depth
than the Sustainability Dashboard, which has few goals and outdated
results. Limitations in data access and measuring outcomes should
be fixed. Responsibility for results must be clear. Outcomes must
be consistently reviewed and updated.
• Openness - A lack of transparency has hindered progress and
participation.
◊ Inclusive open process of gathering and using input from all stakeholders
must become standard - required.
• The Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) has been
underutilized, left out of key discussions and has no authority to
effectively oversee the areas it is charged with overseeing.
• Engage and use community experts - respecting, listening to, and
following advice from a larger group will improve outcomes.
• The authority of certain groups, like the Net Zero Action Plan Task
Force (NZAPTF), activists, and residents should be better defined
◊ Evaluation of program design and effectiveness needs to be clear, timely,
open and honest. Many programs have been started and time spent on
climate initiatives which then fade away with not even a report that can
inform future work [Example: the Georgetown Climate Prize effort.]

Attachment: Climate Crisis Working Group_March2022 (COF 2022 #39 : Climate Crisis Working Group Report)

Mindset: A culture change is needed.

Packet Pg. 156

Mandates: Carrots need to be bigger and more flavorful AND used with sticks
to get the desired results.
◊ BEUDO is a prime example of how there was not much incentive to
change behavior, or direct support in the form of funding or recognition.
And exposure of emissions wasn’t sufficient - and climate leaders were
not recognized. Now requirements are needed and should be enforced
through rules and regulations along with strong incentives. Effort went
into the collection of data and time spent by the city and property owners
to report, with BEUDO itself having little impact on reducing emissions those property owners working on reduction were already engaged. [See
below for update to BEUDO.]
◊ Examples of necessary mandates include:
• Transition point electrification: This could be a game-changer and
should be developed as soon as possible.
• EV use and charging, bicycle, and public transit infrastructure should
be required more widely.
Money: Investment needs to match the challenge.
◊ Major investmentment is needed to make the city an environmental
leader
◊ Ideas with potential for meaningful impact:
• Fund and leverage Eversource programs to create a GeoGrid
demonstration in Cambridge. Cambridge should explore how to
be a pilot site by partnering with Eversource or outside funders.
Perhaps use a third-party installer who funds the project and
owns the infrastructure. HEET is hosting a meeting with interested
municipalities in April or May to allow them to consider both options.
Invest in a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA, as MIT did in
2016).
• Use PACE or another mechanism to enable financing for heat pumps
and/or solar panels for residents, especially low income residents. If
city funding mechanisms cannot be used, pursuing outside funding
should be a priority.
• Invest in EV, bicycle, and public transit infrastructure and incentives
across city operations and for all residents, visitors and employees.

Below are seven recommendations which are appropriate areas of focus
for and action by the city in the near
term. These actions are mostly items
drawn from the work of other city
climate groups, notably CPAC and the
offshoots of NZAP and CRZTF and
Mothers Out Front, Green Cambridge
and 350MA Cambridge. Some actions
were identified through the CCWG
and have not been part of the CPAC
work - although the city has worked on
some items outside of CPAC and other
climate groups. There are many other
ideas, actions, and initiatives identified
by CCWG members as worthy of effort
and pursuing which could be included
in future climate work. The CCWG could
not cover them all in the short amount
of time. There may be some possibility
for group members to continue the
work in some form. It is important to
note, though, without the changes
in mindset, mandates and money
summarized above, these actions are
not likely to yield the desired impact.
1. BEUDO Amendments Performance
Requirements: strengthen,
implement:
In the City of Cambridge, energy use
in buildings accounts for the majority

10

of greenhouse gas emissions -- about
80%, compared to most cities where
buildings represent about half of
emissions and less than half nationally
and globally. In response to growing
concerns about energy use and climate
change, the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
enacted by the Cambridge City Council
on July 28, 2014. This ordinance
requires owners of larger buildings to
monitor and report annual building
energy use to the City. This data is then
categorized and made available on the
Cambridge Open Portal. The intention
of this ordinance was to make energy
and water use data publicly available,
so that various users such as potential
property buyers, tenants, realtors, and
others can make informed decisions,
hopefully incentivizing building owners
to reduce energy usage in their building
stock. However, it is now clear that
energy use disclosure is not enough,
and ordinance amendments1 to
introduce performance requirements
are currently under consideration by
the City Council as contemplated in the
original ordinance.
The proposed ordinance amendments
require not only disclosure of building
energy use, but establish a schedule

Attachment: Climate Crisis Working Group_March2022 (COF 2022 #39 : Climate Crisis Working Group Report)

Recommendations

1 See appendix for ordinance amendment text
Packet Pg. 158

for reductions in GHG emissions.
As written the CCWG believes the
draft recommendations fall short
of the actions necessary to meet
the challenges of the climate crisis.
Currently, the amendments require
each BEUDO property to comply
with Greenhouse Gas Emissions
requirements over a course of 6
compliance periods, resulting in net
zero emissions in 2050. The CCWG
recommends that this timeline be
accelerated, with net zero reached
by 2040 at the latest. And that all
new buildings within the scope of
BEUDO be required to be net zero
immediately. This goal is in line with a
policy order passed by the City Council
in 2017, calling for 100% clean and
renewable energy in the building and
transportation sectors by 2035.
Additionally, the amendments should
be changed to add a requirement that
outliers which use significantly more
energy than other buildings must
reach a certain baseline within the
first few years. In other words, there
should be a threshold that all BEUDO
covered buildings must meet by 2025,
then start their emissions reductions
plans from there. This would ensure
that buildings which already meet
the threshold are not exempt from
reducing emissions -- they will still stick
to the emissions requirements under
the compliance period schedule -- but

11

large emitters will need to catch up to
them.
RECOMMENDATION: Amend BEUDO
along the lines of the city proposal,
with stronger elements: Shorten
the timeline for net zero, ensure
the highest alternative payment is
required, bring outliers’ emissions
down faster.

2. CCE Changes: higher RPS for
the standard offering, including
community shared solar:
The Cambridge Community Electricity
Program (CCE) is an electricity
aggregation program authorized under
MGL XXII, Ch. 164, §164 that opts-in
residents to electricity supply selected
by the City via City procurement
process. CCE provides consumers
with two options:, Standard Green
and 100% Green Plus. Residents
and businesses on Basic Rate are
automatically enrolled in Standard
Green, which meets the minimum
Massachusetts renewable energy
requirements, including 20% from
“premium” renewable energy sources
in New England (MA Class I RECs).
In contrast, 100% Green Plus offers
100% of electricity from “premium”
renewable energy sources in New
England (MA Class I RECs), while also
purchasing MA Class I RECs to achieve
100% renewable energy. Customers
can also choose not to participate in
the CCE program and opt down to
Eversource basic service or dozens of
other suppliers.
Cambridge CCE participation rates
show that most people stay in the
default program option - Standard
Green. Very few people opt out of the
supply selected under CCE by the City.
One issue is that for all new accounts,
it takes a while for the account to be
part of CCE. Only about 5% opt up to
100% Green Plus. Given inertia and the
fact that it takes action, no matter how
12

easy, that low percent is not surprising.
However, since Cambridge perceives
itself as a climate leader and enormous
effort went into trying to get people to
opt into 100% Green Plus, this program
is an example of a communication and
action strategy that did not achieve the
desired result. The communications
efforts on this have yet to be evaluated
and assessed, which might help guide
future efforts in other areas.
Other cities and towns have different
program offerings; conversations
with representatives from the cities
of Somerville, Natick, Newton and
Boston have documented that
most customers stay in the default
option, while a small number opt up
or down. The difference, though, is
that Cambridge’s default option has a
low percentage of renewable energy
compared to other municipalities (see
Fig. 1, Fig. 2 in Appendix B). The city
touts that the number opting in to
100% renewable option has doubled,
but with only 5% participating, the
city’s use is not significant enough to
be making as much difference as other
municipalities with a much higher RPS.
Cambridge’s current standard offering
is the minimum percent renewable
energy required by law. While there
is an addition of 0.2¢ (2/10 of a cent)
that goes to onsite renewable energy
in Cambridge, this adder generates
relatively little funds - about $650K/
year. RECs in New England are
priced at the point where they make a
difference to the greening of the grid -

Attachment: Climate Crisis Working Group_March2022 (COF 2022 #39 : Climate Crisis Working Group Report)

5.3.a

Packet Pg. 160

which is the point of RECs. Collectively
the community aggregation programs
in municipalities across Massachusetts
are affecting the addition of renewables
onto the grid. Cambridge can and
should do more to contribute to that
effort. In fact, Cambridge’s first CCE
plan was described as greenwashing
in a report published by the Green
Energy Consumer Alliance review
in 2020 of community electric
aggregation in Mass[ page 19]:
The CCWG recommends that the
CCE program amend the default
program option and follow the lead
of other cities and have three tiers. A
standard offering (“Standard Green”)
which is the default with a much
higher RPS than the minimum, a
basic offering meeting the minimum
Massachusetts renewable requirement,
and a 100% renewable offering. The
Standard Green should at least match
surrounding municipalities. Standard
(default) offers for other cities as of
summer of 2021 are as follows:
●
Lexington - 100% renewable
●
Newton - 80% renewable
●
Watertown - 53% renewable
●
Worcester - 38% renewable
●
Natick - 31% renewable
●
Boston - 28% renewable
●
Somerville - 28% renewable
●
Cambridge - 18% renewable =
state minimum required
In addition to being able to opt-in
residents to City-selected electricity
supply, state rules governing CCE
13

also allow the City to opt-in residents
to Community Shared Solar (CSS)
under the Solar Massachusetts
Renewable Target (“SMART”) program.
The CSS program delivers electricity
to the grid from solar farms across
Massachusetts creating new sources
of clean electricity and supporting
development of the solar industry
in Massachusetts. CSS reduces
electricity costs and the SMART
program makes additional savings
available to low income households.
LICSS is currently operating and details
are being worked out with DPU on
including in aggregation programs. It
is expected that soon the City can
opt-in low income households without
any outlays on the part of the City
or residents, no use of space within
the City, no use of City land, and no
installation on the property of the
City or its residents. City of Boston
is working with DOER and DPU to
use its CCE program to enroll 20,000
low income households in Boston in
CSS. CCWG recommends that City
of Cambridge join with City of Boston
working with DOER and DPU to take
advantage of this opportunity provided
to municipalities under state law (M.G.L
Title XXII Ch. 164 §134).
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) For
Cambridge to be a climate leader,
we must offer a higher percentage
of MA Class I RECs in our Standard
Green option. The CDD should either
increase the default (standard) RPS to
80% renewable or copy Lexington’s

model of a standard offer at 100%
renewables not in New England
which is very close to Cambridge’s
18% renewable price, and an opt-up
option of 100% Renewables in New
England. 2) Follow Boston’s example
by using CCE to opt-in low income
households to develop new clean
energy sources and simultaneously
reduce energy burden for low income
households without outlay on the
part of the City.

3. Solar: City should invest in a VPPA,
expand community solar:
The Cambridge Community
Development Department is currently
exploring the possibility of signing a
Virtual Power Purchase Agreement
(VPPA) as a way to off-set the city’s
emissions. With a VPPA, Cambridge
would invest in a distant, off-side
solar installation that reduces carbon
emissions by displacing dirty energy
in the host region, and may result in a
positive economic return to its owners/
financers from the sale of electricity.
MIT and many other institutions have
done VPPAs - even if a VPPA is just one
step towards 100% renewable energy,
it is a proven way to move the needle
and contribute to a greener grid. The
CCWG enthusiastically supports this
idea.
The CCWG notes that on-site solar
generation for all city properties residential and commercial - is an
important way every resident can be
part of the solution. The CEA has been
working to make headway in getting
1-4 family homes to install solar, and
a report on the CEA’s effectiveness
is underway and could be valuable in
determining how to ramp up those
efforts. The installation of solar
is challenging, and those homes
collectively generate less 15% of
citywide emissions. However, with the
need for electrical capacity and the
inevitable huge increase in demand for
electricity, every possible clean-energy
addition to the grid, including small15

scale onsite solar should be pursued.
And, it is a solid way for those residents
to contribute to solutions. Cambridge
should support the development
of clean energy and reduce energy
burden on low income households
at no cost by enrolling low income
households in community solar. By
having all low income households be
automatically enrolled, all would benefit.
RECOMMENDATION: For City
properties, the CCWG recommends
that all City properties utilize on-site
solar power generation. Additionally,
City meters should be enrolled in
the Community Shared Solar (CSS)
available across the State since 2014
and now operated under the State’s’
SMART program - this would both
save money and increase energy
efficiency of municipal properties.
Additionally, the City should optin low income households to CSS
under CCE as described above...
This way, Cambridge would benefit
from facilities that have already been
built by private companies under the
State’s SMART program without any
investment or installation.

4. Transportation: incentivize nonauto transportation and EVs and
accelerate adoption:
Transportation is the second largest
source of emissions in Cambridge
and the largest source statewide.
In addition to emissions reduction,
reforming transportation in Cambridge
would reduce noise and air pollution
(which has a disproportionate impact
on low income neighborhoods),
congestion, and deaths and injuries

resulting from crashes. It is critical to
expand mobility options for all citizens
of Cambridge to promote alternatives
to private vehicles. While Cambridge
does not control every road within the
city limits and many commuters simply
travel through Cambridge, there are
concrete steps that can be taken in
the immediate term that would reduce
transportation emissions and make
Cambridge a safer, greener, healthier,
and more equitable City.

RECOMMENDATIONS: See below for a list of actions that were discussed by
transportation experts within the CCWG:
Transition to an all electric municipal fleet with an aggressive timeline.
◊ Strengthen and codify the current Green Fleet Policy in ordinance.
◊ As soon as an EV is available, all new purchases should be EV - with
an expected complete replacement for passenger vehicles and light
commercial vehicles by 20302; the city’s medium and heavy duty fleet
should transition by 2035. Ensure that all leased and owned school buses
are electric vehicles are EVs.
Electrification
◊ Create an aggressive plan for the expansion of EV charging infrastructure.
• Build off of other cities with EV goals, like Boston.
◊ Utilize all existing options - light pole charging, public lot chargers, right to
charge, allow private residences to lease their chargers to the public.
◊ 100 more publicly available EV chargers should be installed in the next 5
years and goal established for next 5 years
• Create a comprehensive plan with community input.
• Require consideration of equity in terms of the placement of
chargers.
Reduce vehicle traffic and expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure to
ensure safe cycling and walking for citizens.
◊ Bike parking infrastructure that provides bikes protection from elements

enables more residents to own bikes.
• Public bike parking should be installed in residential neighborhoods.
• Explore options like secure bike parking pods.
◊ Provide options including rebates and funding to make bikes, e-bikes,
and bike shares more affordable to low income residents
• Include concrete initiatives for expansion of e-bike use
• Review bike-share use and expand access and establish targets to
serve all residents with station proximity
◊ Bus and bike lane infrastructure - work with city and MBTA to expand past
efforts and provide a fare free transit pilot by the summer of 2022.
Engaging all stakeholders, explore vehicle free and low and zero emission
zones to reduce emissions and inequity in air quality; make this a priority in
working with the state to move forward and seek funding to implement
◊ Example3: delivery and curb management. Heavy duty vehicle Deliveries
increases air pollution, traffic, safety risks, and idling, - consider if there are
emission free ways to deliver, like the utilization of cargo bikes, increase
anti-idling efforts
Fare free transit: support city efforts to expand on pilot and work with state
to extend to more public transit, including microtransit, and enhancing
pedestrian and cycling opportunities connecting with transit.
End parking minimums and encourage parking maximums.
◊ End parking minimums and institute parking maximums to move

5. GeoGrids: Cambridge should
actively pursue and install a
demonstration:
The transition to electrification is an
urgent need to meet climate goals.
Currently the only way to decarbonize
is to electrify and have renewable
electricity. With buildings the largest
contributor to GHG emissions, heating
and cooling buildings have been a
focus of efforts. The Cambridge-based
Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET),
led by co-executive directors Audrey
Schulman and Zeyneb Magavi, has
provided a potential way to accomplish
this goal. HEET proved its capability by
mapping thousands of dangerous gas
leaks across the state, highlighting that
the need to move away from natural
gas as quickly as possible is both a
matter of climate emergency as well as
public safety.
Networked ground source heat pumps
represent a viable path towards
transitioning away from natural
gas. HEET’s GeoGrid4 : a system of
networked ground source heat pumps,
structured like a gas system to provide
heat to an entire district, was reviewed
by the CCWG. The infrastructure is
installed in the street, with pipes going
into every building. The only emissions
come from electricity used, so any
building connected would immediately
reduce emissions and as the grid

18

was greener, get to net zero or zero
emissions. This type of system could
meet 100% of energy needs - in some
cases, even resulting in excess energy
the initial results of installations show
where it has been installed the system
is cleaner, cheaper in the long-term,
and healthier for residents.
The impact of implementing wide scale
GeoGridsis potentially monumental.
The CCWG asked Councillor Nolan and
the Mayor to push for Cambridge as
a pilot site for Eversource to install a
GeoGrid, and a policy order resulted.
RECOMMENDATION: Since
Cambridge was not selected for
the first Eversource demonstration
installation, the city should find a way
to do a pilot installation, either using
city funds for one or more sites in
Cambridge or having a third party
company install, own, and maintain
the system. A pilot site should be
chosen to maximize impact and
equity - the densest parts of the
city deserve the potential financial
savings and health benefits of
eliminating gas with its attendant
adverse health effects. The idea is
to work with Eversource and HEET to
structure a pilot.

6. Use all means possible to limit new
fossil fuel infrastructure:
The CCWG has endorsed an idea to
amend the special permit process in
Cambridge, making it more difficult
for new construction to use fossil
fuel infrastructure. Since the CCWG
concluded this work, the Attorney
General has opined that this approach
was not in line with the state building
code. The question is whether there is
any path for Cambridge to incentivize
developers and builders to have
no new fossil fuel in their buildings
through the special permit process.
This proposal from Brookline activists,
who had tried to institute a ban on all
new gas or fossil fuel connections
in 2019, appeared feasible until very
recently when the AG ruling was issued.
Despite a well reasoned, clear legal
rationale that it could work, in light of
the AG ruling, Cambridge would need
to file a home rule which may or may
not be approved.
Attention on this question of requiring
no new fossil fuel infrastructure is now
directed to the stretch energy code
update in draft [straw] proposal form.
The current climate actions as written
into ordinance and the Net Zero Action
Plan are not sufficient to reach our

19

emissions reduction goals, and new
buildings are in planning now, making
new and more aggressive plans crucial
in the climate emergency. The state
has released the net zero stretch
energy code draft, and it will not do
enough. The City Council and the City
have advocated for a better code and
should encourage all stakeholders to
follow suit.
RECOMMENDATION: Pursue the
Special Permit route to ending new
fossil fuel infrastructure in large
buildings, and work with the legal
department on whether there is a
way to craft an incentive system
that could pass legal review. And
advocate at every level for a strong,
true net-zero stretch code that would
allow municipalities to mandate all
new buildings and major renovations
decarbonize.

7. Other Action Items: implement
when feasible https://docs.google.

KMJ8/edit#gid=534731909:
●
Major Outreach Campaign on
MassSave programs - for all residents
including renters and low income
homeowners; use MSYEP and all
means to have more people participate
●
Identify City-owned land that
could be used for a “Green the Small
Spaces” program, where small plots
of land (i.e., too small for building
affordable housing units) could be
turned into community gardens
or small parks (e.g., more Miyawaki
Forests).
●
Ban gas-powered leaf blowers
and lawn mowers and other small two
cycle engines, since there are long
term public health costs to workers
and quality of life benefits, mostly
vulnerable communities
●
Adopt a food purchasing
program in line with public health and
environmental concerns [Sample
policy exists in other cities]
●
Enforce existing idling laws and
increase anti-idling efforts: campaign
for all drivers to stop idling the engines
on their vehicles while making a pick-up
or delivery.
●
Consider purchasing e-bikes
including e-cargo bikes for use by city
employees
●
Create incentives for landlords
to put solar panels on building roofs
and improve energy efficiency of their
buildings
20

●
Expand compost program to
large buildings and require all residents
and businesses to compost
