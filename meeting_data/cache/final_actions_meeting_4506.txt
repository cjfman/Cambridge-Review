IN CITY COUNCIL
March 6, 2024
I am pleased to recommend the re-appointment of Elaine DeRosa to the Cambridge Housing Authority
(CHA) Board of Commissioners for a term of 5 years.
Ms. DeRosa spent four decades working at Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, Inc. (CEOC)
and retired after 30 years as the CEOC’s Executive Director. Elaine provided individual tenant advocacy
and developed and advocated for public policy for the preservation and development of affordable
housing in Cambridge and statewide.
Since her retirement from CEOC, her commitment to the development of affordable housing has
continued. Elaine is currently a member of the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust and the Trust’s
appointee to the Community Preservation Act Committee. Elaine has played a critical role on the CHA
Board of Commissioners focusing on the development and preservation of affordable housing.
Ms. DeRosa brings decades of commitment and passion to the necessity of insuring affordable housing
for low-income individuals and families throughout Cambridge. Therefore, in accordance with M.G. L.
Chapter 121B, Section 5, I am submitting Ms. DeRosa’s name for City Council confirmation as a
Commissioner of the Cambridge Housing Authority. I am further requesting that this recommendation be
forwarded to the Housing Committee for a public hearing as outlined in City Council Rule Number 32C.

March 6, 2024
I am hereby recommending the reappointment of Victoria Bergland as a member of the Cambridge
Housing Authority (CHA) Board of Commissioners as the resident Representative for a term of 5-years.
Ms. Bergland was first appointed to the CHA Board of Commissioners in 2013. Her reappointment is
also supported by CHA Executive Director Michael Johnston.
Ms. Bergland is a longtime resident and has over the years been very involved with various aspects of
CHA. As a resident who has gone through construction at her site, she has a very healthy knowledge of
the effects of development on CHA residents as well as employees. Ms. Bergland has participated in the
CHA budget process with Agency staff and regularly attends public and resident meetings sponsored by
the CHA. Ms. Bergland is an active member of the Board and is committed to serving the tenants of
CHA properties. She has completed the online board member training required by Chapter 235.
In accordance with M.G.L. Chapter 121B, Section 5, I am submitting Ms. Bergland’s name for City
Council confirmation as a Commissioner of the Cambridge Housing Authority. I am further requesting

Repsonse to Policy Order POR 2024 #9 dated January 29, 2024
regarding the definition of “Family” in the Zoning Ordinance

Last year, Community Development Department (CDD) staff met with members of the
LGBTQ+ Commission to discuss their concerns about how “Family” is defined in the
Zoning Ordinance. We support their effort and agree that the wording of the Zoning
Ordinance should be amended to be inclusive of different family and household types.
There are three definitions in the Zoning Ordinance that refer to “four or more persons
who are not within the second degree of kinship.” In addition to the definition of
“Family,” which determines the makeup of a “Dwelling Unit,” the definitions of “Lodging
House” and “Group Quarters” are both defined in terms of the residents’ degree of
kinship.
Definitions are interconnected, and clear definitions are essential to having effective
regulations without unintended impacts. This issue was discussed at a hearing of the
Ordinance Committee in November, 2023, related to the Pierson, et al., Zoning Petition.
Some current definitions are outdated and not well aligned with other applicable state
codes or case law. As a result, it can be difficult to distinguish among “dwellings,”
“lodging houses,” and “transient accommodations,” which has become problematic
with the rise of short-term rental platforms.
CDD staff, in consultation with the Law Department, Inspectional Services Department,
Licensing Commission, and others, have developed the attached proposal to update
residential use definitions in the Zoning Ordinance. The intent is to:
•

Delete references to “degree of kinship” in favor of more inclusive standards to
determine how a residential use is characterized.

•

Update definitions to be more consistent with state sanitary code, building
code, and other state law.

•

Clarify distinctions between different types of “residences” and differentiate
them from “transient accommodations” such as hotels.

We look forward to discussing this proposal with the Housing Committee.

●

Zoning regulates the use of land, not personal relationships or family
composition

●

Property owner is responsible for compliance

●

Most zoning enforcement happens when a building permit or
certificate of occupancy is being sought – based on plan review and
inspection

●

Zoning enforcement can be requested if someone thinks there is a
violation (e.g., residents, neighbors, abutters)

State sanitary code (regulates
number of people who can occupy a

○

State licensing law (regulates
lodging houses, hotels)

favor of more inclusive standards to determine
how a residential use is characterized.

●

Update definitions to be more consistent with
state sanitary code, building code, and other
state law.

●

Are the units being offered based on a rental agreement (e.g., a monthly lease) or
by a nightly fee?
