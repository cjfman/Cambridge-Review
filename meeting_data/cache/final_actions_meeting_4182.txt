Upcoming policy orders at Monday's meeting

I write as a longtime resident of Cambridge and homeowner (and taxpayer) for nearly 30 years.
I am in support of Policy Order 2022 #267, Charter Right #1: It is important for the City to look at
Cambridge as a whole and determine how individual policy orders effect each other and the health of
the City including Businesses and Residents. The City is rapidly changing with important decisions to be
made concerning Affordable Housing, Labs, Legalized Pot Shops, and changes to combat Climate
Change and more. There needs to be oversight to look at how all these changes ;affect the City as a
whole.
I am opposed to Policy Order POR 2022 #19. Parking spots are being removed throughout the city. It's
getting more and more difficult to find a parking space in Cambridge. If new developments are allowed
to be built without providing new parking, there will be more cars competing for the limited residential
parking spots. All this policy will achieve is more development and higher profits for developers.

Comment, 10.24.22

Hi,
I'm writing to support:
- Calendar #1: as articulated last week, our development policies should be evaluated, though not at the expense of
continuing to move forward
- Calendar #3: parking minimums.
- Communication 4.10(a) from Hasson Rachid – this funding and support should be looked into carefully and should be
applied for
- Communication 4.22(a) from Hasson Rachid – it is imperative that these boards, among others, include representation
from unhoused residents.

Policy Orders

Dear City Council Members, City Manager, and City Clerk,

As a long-term resident, taxpayer, and homeowner, I write to express my strong support of Policy
Order 2022 #267, Charter Right #1: It is important for the City to look at Cambridge as a whole and
determine how individual policy orders interact with one another as well as the sum of their effects on
the health of the City— including its local Businesses and Residents. Cambridge is changing so rapidly
that enacting policy changes piecemeal does none of its constituents a service, with decisions about
such vital topics as Affordable Housing, Bio Tech/Life Science Labs, Legalized Pot Shops, and changes to
combat Climate Change and more. There needs to be oversight to look at how all these changes affect

In addition, I write to express my strong opposition to Policy Order POR 2022 #19. Parking spots are
being removed throughout the city. It's getting more and more difficult to find a parking space in
Cambridge for the few times I need to use a vehicle rather than walk. If new developments are allowed
to be built without providing new parking, there will be more cars competing for the limited residential
parking spots. All this policy will achieve is more development and higher profits for developers.
Thank you for your consideration.

Those on the council who realize what a drastic measure this is and say "I support it anyway" should take a long look at
all the multi-car households in Cambridge. These are usually owners who have driveways, but also have 4 cars, so 2 are
on the street. If you really want to eliminate cars in Cambridge, start with taxes on multi-car households.
This will be the issue that changes the makeup of the council on election day.

End parking minimums

Hello,
I'd writing to show my support for the proposal to remove off-street parking minimums from the city zoning code.
As a user of on-street parking, I see dozens of my Cambridgeport neighbors with plenty of off-street parking not even
*use* their off-street parking because street parking permits are so cheap (which should be fixed, in my opinion - people
with private parking shouldn't be incentivized to take up shared public space on-street). It's clear that off-street parking
is underutilized and not needed.
Not to mention how many friends and coworkers I have who don't have a car, for whom an off-street parking space is a
complete waste of space. One of my neighbors has a neurological disorder that makes it unsafe for him to drive, so
biking and walking are his only option. Making the city less dependent on cars will only help people with a wide variety
of disabilities like this, as well as the elderly who can't drive, contrary to the notion that less-able people are reliant on
cars.
As a car owner myself, I can say I would be happy if parking were harder to come by. It would disincentivize driving,
making walking and biking (my main modes of transit) safer and more pleasant. And if it were hard enough, I wouldn't
even mind getting rid of my car. I only use it once a week or so because the city is already so dense and walkable, and I
only have it because:
a) street parking is way below market price due to heavy subsidies, and the costs externalized to taxpayers who don't
drive (raise the price!)
b) public transit and bike infrastructure aren't quite good enough to get me everywhere I need to go (please keep
working on this too!)
Please remove parking minimums and make Cambridge a more vibrant, safer city.
Best,
Oliver Newman

Understanding the impact of policy changes

I write in support og Policy Order 2022 #267, Charter Right #1: It is just a hallmark of good government
for the City to look at Cambridge as a whole and determine how individual policy orders affect each
other and the health of the City including Businesses and Residents. The recent policy concerning
bicycle lanes, etc. is a good example of what happens when policy decisions are made with little
attention to the impact on businesses, residences, and neighborhoods. That decision has been a serious
setback to confidence in City government. However, it has created an opportunity to put
review systems and communication systems in place that are exemplary and reflective of the excellence
you all represent.

Parking Minimums

Hello,
I support Policy Order# 267 because I think a lot is being done in Cambridge based on assumptions about the outcomes
and we need to monitor and measure them.
I oppose Policy Order POR 2022 # 19
I believe this is a giveaway to developers. They save and still will charge the same prices. And cars will park on already
dense side streets because the assumption that people will not have cars if they don't have parking is a questionable
one. Sidestreets like Goldster near where I live are already very congested. The effect on climate change is a
hypothetical.
"All seven supporters have off-street parking at home and dedicated parking at City Hall, except Azeem, who
bikes." This is in the literature about opposing this. If it is true, then you should really look at this double standard.
It reminds me of how we lost rent control by taking stands that seemed extreme and alienated lots of people in
Cambridge.
I have very rarely over the years been in opposition to your policies, but this seems to benefit only developers. You
should think twice about why you are alienating so many folks and think of compromises

Support for removing parking minimums

Dear Cambridge City Council,
I recently moved to Cambridge in June after graduating from college, and have already fallen in love with the city and
the strong community. This community, I’ve noticed, is bolstered by the infrastructure in and design of the city. I am
forever grateful for the amount of accessible public transit that lets me reach neighbors and friends all over the city.
Riding my bike in one of our many protected (and unprotected) bike lanes is one of my favorite ways to become better
acquainted with the city. I especially enjoy being able to walk around the city with relative ease, a sense of freedom and
mobility that I have never experienced before. I know that this infrastructure is the result of your (and your
predecessors’) hard work as city councilors, and I am grateful.
I am writing to urge you to make another infrastructural decision that will better our community. I believe that it is
essential to remove parking minimums and make it legal to build less parking. As a Cambridge resident who doesn’t have
a car but *does* have a parking spot associated with my apartment, I honestly feel somewhat resentful of this unused
spot. When I pass by it, I imagine all of the other ways that it could be used: re-purposed into green space, a wider bike
lane, or congregated with other unused parking spots (given that I am among 30% of Cambridge residents who don’t
have cars) into a home for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. The presence of parking minimums makes
Cambridge a hostile community; it sends the message that this is a city designed for cars not people and invested in
exacerbating the affordable housing crisis.
Rather than continuing to invest in infrastructure that divides our community and harms the environment, I urge you to
end parking minimums.
Thank you,
Shreya Chowdhary

Support for Abolishing Parking Minimums

I support the plan to abolish parking minimums.
I own one unit in a triple-decker in North Cambridge, and I currently regularly park my car in one of our three off-street
parking spaces. However, I may not need this space in the future, and my neighbors often don't use their spaces today.
It is rare for all three spots to be occupied. If I were to eventually move, I would prefer the flexibility of being able to
either own a space or not own a space.
Many buildings on the street I live on do not have off-street parking. There has not been a shortage of on-street parking,
even when an emergency street repair removed several spots. The curb directly in front of our building often does not
have a car parked at it.
Many of my neighbors' yards are green space, and some include large trees. The current parking minimums would
prevent my neighborhood from being constructed today. If a similar neighborhood were to be built, I think the new
owners would appreciate being able to choose what they do with their plots, whether it be more housing, green yards,
or parking spaces.
Thank you,

Parking Minimums

Hello,
I am writing to you as a Cambridge homeowner, and car owner, that I support keeping car minimums for new
construction relating to off-site parking. Street parking is dangerous, and developers can continue to put parking below
ground or at ground level. It is naive to think that everyone in Cambridge can rely on public transit to get to work, an
affordable grocery store, or to seek medical care.

Re: Policy Order POR 2022 #19

Dear City Councillors,
I am unable to attend Monday night's meeting so am writing to express my support for Policy Order POR 2022 #19.
•
•

In 2022 the Boston-Cambridge-Newton conurbation has the third lowest rate of car ownership in the US
(87.13% of households)
This trend is exacerbated by the so-called Millennial generation who are less inclined to own a car than previous
generations. Given that 38.7% of the population of Cambridge is between the ages of 26-44 years*, it makes
sense that the parking requirements for housing should reflect the trend.

The most recent draft amendment to the code seems eminently sensible in that it is flexible and pragmatic, putting the
onus on developers to justify parking provision with relevant statistics.
The strongest arguments against this amendment are firstly, that excess parking will spill out onto the street, increasing
competition for spaces; and that self-employed tradesmen (particularly in construction) will need off-street parking in
order to remain viable. These arguments are answered in the flexibility of the proposed amendment and the need to
make a case.
The overall goal of reducing car ownership is consistent with the City's policy of promoting walking, biking and public
transportation and should therefore be supported.
I urge you to vote in favour of the amendment.
*54.6% between the ages of 20-44 makes the case even stronger.

In SUPPORT of removing parking minimums

Dear City Council,
I am writing in support of removing parking minimums in the city of Cambridge. There are many, many reasons -- the
prohibitive cost that they add to the construction of new units, the fact that 40% of cambridge households don't own
cars and therefore are only punished through increased rents/mortgages, the addition of new vehicles to the city with
each parking spot built, and the slowly increasing number of parking spots rather than homes and parks in the city.
Cambridge is special because it has resisted becoming a sea of parking lots -- but with these parking minimums, we can't
even build homes.
Please remove the parking minimums,
Cheers,

End Parking Minimums

Dear Councillors,
I am excited you will be voting on removing parking minimums. I hope you will remove these minimums and this
mandate for required parking spaces
My family's single detached home in Cambridge demonstrates the cost requiring parking minimums has on green space
and creating more homes in Cambridge. Years ago my parents looked into turning the third floor into an apartment
but parking minimums meant to do that they would have to pave over our small backyard.
We live within easy walking distance of Porter Sq and a supermarket, do most errands on foot, and walk or bike to work.
We are fortunate to live in Cambridge and be in a place in our lives where having a car is a perk, not a necessity. While I
realize some people must rely on a car, ending parking minimums will not take parking away from them. Rather it would
provide flexibility to choose more green space, more homes, or more parking. I believe this is a choice we should have.
Our house is a clear case where the desire to keep some green space conflicted with required parking minimums and
prevented the creation of another home in Cambridge. Consider similar trade-offs happening thousands of times over
across Cambridge, one of the best places to live without a car in this country.

Consider removing parking minimums

My partner and I share one car for our two-person household in Cambridge. We rely on street parking everywhere we
go, including at home. Sometimes this means parking a little further away from our destination and then walking, and
we recognize that this is part of the reality of living in an urban setting. We are fortunate enough to live near several bus
lines and often take the MBTA instead of driving. We also live very close to a supermarket (with an overly-large parking
lot) and I sometimes walk to get groceries. One thing I love about Cambridge is how bikeable it is, and when my bike is
out of commission (or if I have guests who want to join me by bike), I can use Blue Bikes and take advantage of the
wonderful bike infrastructure Cambridge has been working on. I also love walking around the vibrant, pedestrian-scale
neighborhoods and commercial areas of Cambridge and would love to see more such areas (and less space taken up by
parked/unoccupied cars.
Please keep in mind that there are plenty of Cantabrigians like us who would like to see our city become LESS carfocused (even if we ourselves have a car without off-street parking). This will also help with housing affordability (which
will help others) and environmental sustainability (which will help everyone). Consider lowering or removing parking
minimums.

Support for ending minimum parking requirement

Dear City Council,
I'm writing to express support for removing the parking mandates (calendar item 3) from Cambridge zoning rules at
tomorrow's Council meeting.
Many people rely on cars, but just as many don't want or need a car to get around, especially in Cambridge. However, by
requiring parking in new buildings, it becomes more likely that people will get a car even when they wouldn't have
otherwise. This contributes to traffic, increases air pollution, and makes the streets less safe for families and seniors.
My fiancée and I don't own a car. When we need one, we borrow a car from friends or family, or rent it. But for us, being
able to find housing in Cambridge (maybe someday being able to buy an apartment) and having a clean, green city and
planet is a much higher priority than buying a car and finding parking.
Thank you for bringing forward this progressive, common-sense change!

Policy Orders

Dear Councilors I am opposed to Policy Order POR 2022 #19 related to new developments having no minimum required parking. It is all
well and good to pursue - at a reasonable rate - policies that incentivize fewer cars. However, there is an aging
population in Cambridge and a subset of residents who will always need to rely on cars for transportation. To ignore
this reality is ridiculous. Developers should be required to provide some parking... perhaps fewer than in the past but
SOME. The competition for residential parking will of course increase. Don't think it won't. One side effect of this policy
would be greater profits for developers. I urge you to reject this policy order.
I am in complete support of Policy Order 2022 #267, Charter Right #1: It is important for the City to look at Cambridge
as a whole and how individual policy orders impact each other and the City overall including businesses and residents.
The City is rapidly changing with important decisions to be made concerning Affordable Housing, Labs, Legalized Pot
Shops, and changes to combat Climate Change and more. A wholistic approach is not only needed, it is the intelligent
way to prepare this city for a sustainable and vibrant future.

Council,
I am extremely excited about the council moving forward with eliminating parking minimums throughout the city. As a
dense urban city, where a third of households don't own cars, mandating parking minimums is raising costs for
development and inducing car ownership and usage throughout the city. By passing the improvement to our zoning
code, we will lower housing and commercial costs, while continuing to act on our environmental and safety goals.
I urge the council to unanimously pass this common sense policy order.

Writing in support of removing parking minimums in Cambridge

Hello,
I am writing as a Cambridge resident in support of the agenda item on the council meeting of October 24th to remove
residential parking minimums in the City of Cambridge. As someone who currently owns a car and uses street parking,
but primarily travels to work and elsewhere via bicycle, I believe that removing the requirements for new residential
development to have requirements on per-unit parking will have drastic benefits for Cambridge's current and future
residents -- allowing for an increase in the housing supply, encouraging a mode shift to walking, bicycling, and public
transportation, and reducing car dependency in Cambridge. I fully support the measure on the agenda to remove these
requirements and hope that the Council will vote in support of moving this change forward.
Thank you very much,

Dear Cambridge City Council,

I have lived in Cambridge for about 7 years now. If I ever leave, it will likely be due to the rising cost of rent and

Dear City Manager, Mayor Siddiqui, Cambridge City Councilors, and Cambridge City Traffic, Parking, and Transportation
Director,
1. We are writing in support of Policy Order 2022 #267, Charter Right #1. It is important for the City to look at Cambridge
as a whole to determine how individual policy orders impact each other as well as the health of the City including
Businesses and Residents. The City is rapidly changing with important decisions to be made concerning Affordable
Housing, Labs, Legalized Cannabis Shops, and changes to combat Climate Change and more. There must be oversight to
examine how all these changes affect the City as a whole.
2. We are opposed to Policy Order POR 2022 #19. Parking spots are being removed throughout the City. It is getting
more and more difficult to find a parking space in Cambridge. If new developments are allowed to be built without
providing new parking, there will be more cars competing for a very limited number of residential parking spots. All this
policy will achieve is increased development and larger profits for the developers.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Anna Spera

I support abolishing parking minimums

Hello,
I am a Cambridge resident of 7 years, a homeowner here, and a car owner. I am writing to say: I fully support
abolishing parking minimums from our zoning code.
Removing parking minimums frees developers to build housing that makes the most sense for residents. My
building in Mid-Cambridge does not have off-street parking, and this makes sense: most of my neighbors do
not have or need cars. We live in a part of the city where most trips are easier by walking, biking, or transit. But
my building would not be legal to build today because of parking minimums.
Instead, parking minimums force developers to build expensive parking even in parts of the city where few
people need or want it, and this unnecessarily raises the cost of housing. Abolishing parking minimums would
remove this gross inefficiency, while still allowing developers to build parking in parts of the city where it is
more logical.
Best,
Matt Staib, Ph.D.

Cambridge Zoning Reform

Dear City Council,
As a Cambridge resident, architect and local small business owner, I support sensible zoning reform for Cambridge.
It's disheartening that so many hard working people, even upper middle-class families and individuals, cannot afford to
own their homes here in Cambridge. Meanwhile, developers are reducing our housing stock by converting 2-family and
multi-family buildings into single family homes. This zoning-approved development only benefits a few wealthy
individuals.
Please support sensible zoning reform that responds to our ongoing housing disparities and climate emergency, and
please do not be swayed by the boisterous NIMBY-ism that seems too content with the current housing crisis in
Cambridge.
I am optimistic that the City Council will support the much needed zoning reform that will provide long term benefits
and overall fairness to our city.
Thank you,
Dave

Parking and Judiciary Boards

Honorable Mayor, Cambridge City Councillors, and City Manager
On ending parking minimums: Recent studies of Portland, Oregon and Buffalo, New York with regard to the
impacts of removing parking minimums make it clear that this effort will likely fail to remove vehicles or
driving demands on our streets. Indeed, for both commercial developments and residential units the number
of vehicles increased. No doubt this will also add to divisions in the city between wealthy and poor, as new
wealthier residents moving into the city (or investing here) will insist on parking because the financial return is
far better. And if new market rate infill housing results from this move this will drive up housing costs even
more as property values increase – also removing critical green areas and trees. I urge you to vote no.
Our Envision goals never called for this except along the major corridors. This did not work elsewhere (in
progressive cities) and is very poorly thought through – including no parking maximums.
On our judiciary boards: While providing general overviews to the selection is important, it was disturbing to
read that no professional criteria are being asked for the upcoming BZA positions. Since CDD chose NOT to do
a City Plan for Cambridge, increasingly it is these Boards, coupled with neighbors and neighborhood groups
who are having to address all these new developments in their neighborhoods on an ad hoc basis. Until we get
a City Plan we need real professionals on these board, not just “friends” of Councillors, who are urged to apply
and who may then owe them fealty. In recent years and months the personal attacks of individual members of
our various boards by Councillors, Councillor Aides and by political affiliates on social media has become
deeply disturbing and suggests potentially serious problems ahead, particularly as more and more
development is rushing to our already dense city with no end in sight and with serious potential harm to our
neighborhoods, environment, and livability. Professional, non-partisan judiciary boards are critically important
for the city to go forward in a reasonably responsible way.
The CHC needs architects, landscape architects, preservation experts, historians, builders, and people
with deep knowledge of Cambridge neighborhoods. The BZA needs architects, lawyers, developers, builders,
and people with a deep knowledge of our very complex zoning situation. The Planning Board needs architects,
landscape architects, lawyers, builders, people knowledgeable in the environment, historians, urban planners,
and people with a deep knowledge of the city’s neighborhoods and history. We are a dense and well-educated
city with people who work professionally in nearly all the requisite areas. Finding diversity within this core
group of professionals and maintaining some who already have many years of working on these commissions
is key. In some cases, 15 years of experience is the smart way to do this. Please do not turn these committees
into political footballs, promoting a given political agenda focused in part on Council reelection efforts. Now
that they will be paid, the political consequences are even more potentially serious. Our city deserves far
better.
What we ALSO must require now is for CDD to finally do a City Plan (we paid for this but instead got
Envision soft goals that do none of the hard work). We also need CDD to finally do the needed design
guidelines for various kinds of developments in different neighborhoods, so that our Boards (and residents)

Parking minimums and political appointments

To the City Council, City Manager and City Clerk,
Re: Parking minimums: I am a long-time resident of the City. Our family has one car that we can park off-street. What you do
on parking minimums is unlikely to affect me much.
Nonetheless, I am against getting rid of any parking for new projects and I want to share the experience my husband had as a
developer of a newly permitted 81 unit apartment building in South Boston.
My husband’s family bought this parcel in 1953 and for the last nearly 30 years it has been a fish processing plant. Much of the
other light industry there has or will be converted to housing. The neighborhood was behind my husband’s project from the
get-go - not hard to understand why they might want a fish processing plant to go away.
It took 2 plus years and massive amounts of money (architect fees, attorneys, consultants of all types) to get through the
planning agencies of Boston. They are highly professional and demanding. My husband was always open to meeting what the
neighborhood wanted. But one sticking point was the parking: City Planners wanted none and the neighborhood wanted one
per unit.
The Boston City Councillor who represented the neighborhood stood with his constituents and an agreement was worked out
that there would be 60 spaces, a .75% ratio. Perfectly fine with my husband and his investors even though no parking would
have been been less expensive for them.
SO my question is: Why don’t Cambridge Councilors stand with their constituents?
People who have cars (68% of households) but don’t have off-street parking have to park on the street. Big new developments
will bring more cars and they need to go somewhere. I don’t think making life hell for people who already live here is a sound
policy move under any scenario.
Re: Board appointments: I believe that there is a place for political influence - my husband’s experience in Boston is a great
example of when politicians can come into the process on behalf of residents. But what a nightmare if the whole process
becomes political and professional expertise gets thrown out the window.
We live in a historic district and have dealt with the Historical Commission on several occasions. I always trusted that the
process was above board and about following the rules. To have boards become overtly political and experience in the
subject at hand trashed seems pretty Trumpy.
I don’t think the Council’s goal in either of these proposals is to make life harder in the City. But I do think good intentions can
pave the road to hell. And I urge you to use your common sense (and look at examples from other cities and eras) to do what’s
best for the City and its residents.
Thank You.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Houghteling

Please Abolish Parking Minimums

Dear Council
I am a North Cambridge Resident and am writing in strong support of abolishing parking minimums in Cambridge. We
are a city with great transit connections, uniquely walkable neighborhoods, and a generally young student population
who do not own cars. We find ourselves in a current housing crisis and will soon find ourselves in a climate crisis. It is
time we abolish zoning laws such as parking minimums that exacerbate these crises and entrench car-centric urban
design. Of course any changes to how a city is designed and built will involve trade offs, but I am certain the benefits to
affordability, sustainability, and general wellbeing to all city residents will outweigh the potential inconvenience for a
fraction of city residents that feel entitled to cheap, off street parking.
I look forward to seeing the city continue to be leaders in urban design, climate, and equity this evening in abolishing
parking minimums!

Parking Minimums (strong support for removing),

To the Council:
I am very much in favor of removing mandatory parking requirements throughout the city.
I live at 8 Newport Road, a 9-unit address that was built before parking requirements, and thus has none. My verdict: it's
fine! Some people in my building don't have cars, like myself, and we benefit from not having to pay for building parking.
Some people in my building use street parking, and some purchase off-site parking nearby. This is an example of a
market working: those who want or need a service pay for it, and those that don't do not.
When the zoning code requires parking for every unit - or multiple spots per unit - it is effectively requiring those
without cars to subsidize those who do own cars. That is neither kind nor good market set-up, especially since
households without cars are more likely to be lower income than those with one or multiple cars.
Zoning can also be seen as a statement of values. Requiring parking says: parking is more important than anything else
that could go here. Trees. More housing. A garden. A birdfeeder. A swingset. I don't really think we should say parking is
more important than any of those. Individuals can decide for themselves if they want a parking spot or a garden or a
granny flat - and I would appreciate the city allowing for that freedom of choice. Especially because I don't think
everyone will choose parking, because their values are more like mine, and want more trees and units of housing more
than they want more asphalt.
Finally, multiple cities have recently removed mandatory parking requirements. Their skies have not fallen - or, more
realistically, their streets have not turned into unending gridlock of residents or visitors looking for a place to park. Trust
me, I've driven in Ann Arbor without issue. And despite the recent passage of AB 2097 in the California state legislature,
removing all parking minimums within 1/2 a mile of transit throughout the state, my family has not complained to me of
changes and there's still plenty of parking available for my rental car when I visit them next month.
Cambridge should join the list of cities (and states!) getting rid of this antiquated, one-size-doesn't-fit-all zoning. We'll be
behind Fayetteville, Arkansas, but not by that many years.

Re: Curb Cut 52 Standish Street
2022-09-29_-_response_to_neighbor_questions_Thu_Sep_29_2022_10-25-58.pdf

Importance:

High

Dear Councilors,
We are writing today in regards to a curb cut application on tonight’s agenda for the
development project located at 52 Standish Street. Specifically, we wanted to take a minute to
respond to the letter submitted by Mr. McArthur (attached to this email and also included in
your agenda packet) in regards to his application and in response to our letter seeking more
details from him.
First, let us state that we take no position in this matter. In our opinion, curb cuts are a matter
for neighbors to discuss directly with each other, not for outside bodies to rule on in isolation.
This is especially true in cases such as this when abutters disagree on a matter. Only direct
dialogue between neighbors can achieve an amicable solution. As a neighborhood
organization, we are simply interested in ensuring that all relevant questions are answered
satisfactorily by the proponent, and that all parties have worked hard to seek common ground
in the matter, before a curb cut permit is issued.
However, we do believe that in this case the City may not have fully vetted this application for
compliance with Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance (Off-Street Parking & Loading
Requirements). In his letter, the developer claims that Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance
doesn’t apply to him. On that claim, we must object. Article 6 applies to the design of all
parking facilities:
6.13 Scope of Off Street Parking Regulations. All accessory parking facilities shall
conform to all regulations set forth in this Article governing the use, design and
operation of such facilities.
The Zoning Ordinance goes on to define a “parking facility” as the following:
Parking facility. A portion of a building or a lot which is located off-street and contains
one or more motor vehicle parking spaces and access thereto including driveways. A
parking facility may be a garage, an area of a lot or a parking lot. A parking facility may

Attachment: Mike Nakagawa Ann Sweeney Doug Brown Re Curb Cut 52 Standish Street (COM 836 #2022 : A communication was received from

4.33.a

Packet Pg. 165

be an accessory use or a principal use or any combination thereof. For the purposes of
this definition a parking facility shall include parking required by Section 6.30and any
other off-street parking provided.
In short, driveways are expressly considered parking facilities, and therefore are subject to the
design rules of Article 6. The specific design rules we asked for clarification on are as follows:
6.45 Drainage, Surfacing, and Maintenance. All sections of off street parking facilities
which are not landscaped according to the requirements of Subsection 6.48 shall be
graded, surfaced (preferably with durable pervious paving materials such as modular
paving blocks, bricks or similar materials), and maintained to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent of Buildings to the extent necessary to prevent nuisance of dust, erosion,
or excessive water flow onto any public way or onto another lot.
6.46 Lighting. Off street parking facilities which are used at night shall be provided with
adequate lighting installed and maintained in such a manner so as not to reflect or cause
glare on abutting or facing residential premises nor to cause reflection nor glare which
adversely affects safe vision of operators of vehicles moving on nearby streets. A
recommended standard for lighting is a minimum intensity of one (1) foot candle on the
entire surface of the parking facility.
6.47 Screening. Off street parking facilities containing five or more spaces and not in a
structure shall be effectively screened from abutting streets and lots. However, such
screening shall not obstruct vehicle sight distances, entrances and exits.
In light of this, could the developer please provide more complete answers to our questions?
For example, the proponent failed to address the issue of light trespass onto neighboring
properties. Similarly, he ignored our concerns regarding use of the driveway as a pass-through
to his other property, even though such use would potentially eliminate any benefit to the
neighborhood of creating dedicated off-street parking. In general, more transparency from
this developer would help alleviate many of the neighbors’ concerns around lost street parking
and other direct impacts.
Finally, we would note that The Fresh Pond Residents Alliance has been the City’s recognized
neighborhood organization for West Cambridge since at least 2014. We maintain a website, a
Facebook page, a Twitter account, and an active email listserv with over 200 members,
including past and current members of this City Council. Our contact info and officer names
can be found on the City’s website. A statement of our purpose can be found on our website.
Our members have voluntarily served on numerous local boards and commissions, including
the Fresh Pond Advisory Board, Envision Cambridge, Envision Alewife, CPAC, the Transit
Committee, the Climate Zoning Task Force, and many other local civic efforts. If the

developer’s 20+ year history of development in our neighborhood didn’t help make him aware
of our work, perhaps a simple Google search would have sufficed.
Going forward, we would ask that the developer focus on answering the neighborhood
association’s legitimate questions, rather than questioning the clear and longstanding
legitimacy of the neighborhood association itself.

1) Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance states that lighting shall be provided to properly illuminate
parking areas. What will be done to satisfy this requirement, while also minimizing light
trespass towards the neighboring properties?
We do not see anything in Article 6 that pertains to illumination of a single parking space for a 12 family house. Please provide the exact section and wording to which you are referring.
That said, we plan to illuminate this parking space with a single exterior wall sconce similar to a
typical porch light.
2) Article 6 also specifies requirements for the screening of parking areas. The application shows
only a plan view of the curb cut and driveway, but says nothing about the plans for screening.
Can the applicant provide more details regarding their intentions as relates to screening?
Again, we don’t believe the screening requirement in Article 6 applies to a single space driveway
for a 1-2 family house. References to screening in Article 6 seem to apply to parking facilities of
five or more spaces. Please provide the exact section and wording to which you are referring.
3) Flooding, both surface and sub-surface, is a major concern in our neighborhood, and the
abutting foundation at 56 Standish Street is located only a few feet away from the proposed
driveway. Beyond using porous paving, what else does the applicant propose in order to
control runoff from paved areas?
Permeable pavers to be pitched toward the street and not toward abutting properties. We are also
installing gutters that did not previously exist on the house which will directly empty to the city
storm drain. We are, therefore, improving the water management on the lot overall.
4) As a part of the just-begun renovation efforts at 52 Standish Street, the developer recently
installed new storm water and sewer lines to the street. This required excavation within the
public way, resulting in Standish Street being closed to through traffic, including City garbage
trucks, for over a week. These closures were not announced in advance to the neighborhood, nor
was a police detail ever present to redirect traffic. Now that the street has been reopened and the
excavations covered with steel plates, what assurances does the community have that street
closures will be announced in advance in the future? Also, will the developer pay for a fullwidth repaving of the excavated section of roadway, or will the neighborhood now be forced to
deal with steel road plates and potholes forever?
We have done everything required in line with our permit with DPW, including requesting police
details. Unfortunately, requests are not always fulfilled and we have no control if the police
department sends a detail or not. Our work has been completed and the street patched according
to DPW requirements.

5) Since the applicant also owns 201.5 Lakeview Avenue, a landlocked property now under
construction immediately to the rear of 52 Standish Street, conversion of the driveway at 52
Standish Street into an access corridor for 201.5 Lakeview would eliminate any potential parking
benefits of the curb cut to the Standish Street neighborhood, as well as increase car noise to the
immediate abutters at all times of the day. As such, we would request that the applicant be clear
and honest with all concerned parties regarding his true intentions for this curb cut. In short,
what are the applicant’s long-term intentions as relates to a potential driveway easement
servicing the rear parcel?
We are asking for one parking space for 52 Standish Street only. That is the intent of this
application. We have no plans to create an “access corridor” through to 201.5 Lakeview Avenue
and have no idea where this idea is coming from. 201.5 Lakeview is not landlocked and already
has its own access through a private way and its own driveway.
6) And regarding the matter of concerned parties itself, under state law “Parties in Interest” to be
notified in matters related to land use include “owners of land directly opposite on any public or
private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line
of the petitioner.” Rather than using this higher standard of public engagement, the applicant
instead chose to restrict his notifications to the much narrower definition of abutters used in the
Cambridge curb cut guidelines, meaning that few if any neighbors were informed of his plans.
This has been a continuing issue with this applicant. Going forward, we would ask that he
explain how he intends to better inform neighbors of his intentions.
We have fulfilled the city guidelines and curb cut application requirements by notifying all
required abutters. The comment about a “continuing issue with this applicant” is inflammatory
and wholly untrue.
7) Finally, we would also note that this proposal received a letter of disapproval from abutters on
both sides of the property. It is a general policy of the FPRA to support the amicable settlement
of disputes and disagreements among neighbors. As such, we believe that the applicant must
negotiate further with his abutters in order to reach an agreement on the matter, and that
unless the applicant and his neighbors are able to amicably resolve their current differences, that
you as the governing authority should deny approval of this proposal.
It's true that we received letters of disapproval from both 48 Standish and 56 Standish. They
were attached to the permit application along with six approval letters from the remaining
abutters. After receipt of the negative responses, we reached out on August 9, 2022 via email to
Christine McEvoy of the trust that owns 56 Standish. Their property is most directly affected by
this proposed work. We asked that she share her specific concerns about the project so that we
could attempt to resolve them but received no response back.

Hampshire Street Safety Improvement Project

Andreas,
It is a relief to see the written communication for the next CSO project on Hampshire Street has
improved, although marginally. The notices still fail to clearly spell out one of the most important
impacts for residents and businesses... street parking is going to be removed.
While the city is now including language that says the project will 'make changes to parking and
loading' and will `Retain parking and loading zones wherever possible', the language is still
somewhat oblique.(I acknowledge it is better language than used in all prior safety improvement
project notices which had no reference to the removal of parking or relocation /reduction of loading
zones.) Why not clearly state 'Some street parking will be removed and Loading Zones will be
impacted'?
Thank you.

Parking minimums

To the council:
I'm writing today in support of removing mandatory parking minimums. For the last 10 years, I've rented an apartment
in Cambridge without a car and without a need to buy one. All of my jobs have been in Boston or Cambridge and served
well by our public transportation system. Lately I've been telecommuting.
Please don't ask my landlord to claim a parking spot for me, that's not what I want. I'd rather have more neighbors or a
larger apartment or pay less in rent.

Dear Madam Clerk:
Could you kindly include this letter and attachments to Neighborhood & Long Term Planning,
Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration Committee in opposition to Petition to Amend the
Conservation District Ordinance? I submitted this over a year ago. I will not be available to
speak at the meeting today. My submission below is precisely what I offered last year.

Dear Council Members and City Manager:

As many of you know, I am fourth generation Cambridge resident. My family has paid
taxes to this city for over a century. My parents and grandparents worked in the factories here. I
say this to emphasize my breath of interest in preservation of our history, whether it be our
immigrant industrial history; our African American history; or, yes, even the history of our
privileged West Cambridge landed gentry. Based on this appreciation and full well having
experienced the razing of Boston's West End, along with the unbridled development in
Kendall, I rallied some neighbors to study the possibility of establishing a Conservation District
in East Cambridge. We were not a group of old white privileged wealthy people. We were a
group of serious-minded residents who were truly motivated by an appreciation of the value in
our history and architecture. We met almost weekly for about 9 months in the St. Francis of
Assisi Church Hall, a notable Landmark itself. We spent much time establishing boundaries,
looking at other guidelines employed around the country and within Cambridge, taking walking
tours of the boundaries; and researching the history of this great neighborhood.

Recently I note that Conservation Districts in Brookline have been struck down as
unlawful. Why?? Because they did not mirror the process or requirements set forth in MGL. C.
40(C). Our Conservation District ordinance and process up to now is absolutely faithful to
40(C). The Citizen Petition now presented as a Proposed Ordinance, masquerading as Policy
Order 35, is devoid of any foundation in law to be presented as a variation of any Conservation
District composition or process. The Policy Order creates some kind of land use system, not
zoning and not preservation, premised on equity and diversity and business interests. It
completely alters the rigors of standing which are as old as property law itself and
violates 40C. It rejects any notion of professional or academic qualifications likewise in
violation of 40C. And in doing so, this proposal insults the lawyers, architects, real estate
professionals, urban planners and historians who have always comprised the Commission and
the Neighborhood Conservation Districts and most have been uncompensated volunteers.
I am attaching here two cases for your review and suggest that the City Solicitor be
contacted before the Council descends further down this road. The Brookline case clearly
provides that even with a Neighborhood Conservation District, the strictures of MGL c. 40C
apply. You simply cannot ignore state law. And, I am attaching here a Cambridge case
involving our Avon Hill Neighborhood Conservation District in which the Superior Court found
that :

“The Commission incorrectly argues for a "supported by substantial evidence" standard.
Cambridge Municipal Code, 2.78.240 ("The superior court may reverse a determination if
it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record"). To the extent such section of the
Municipal Code seeks to alter the statutory standard of review as set out in G.L.c. 40C,
§12A, such section violates state supremacy, and is therefore void.”

I also note that in violation of Plan E, one City Councilor intervened with the Cambridge
Historic Commission, personally attempting to stop the process and promote her constituents’
position. I have a letter she authored attesting to this and there is also a recorded meeting of the
Conservation District in which she demanded that the entire process be stopped. As this is a
flagrant violation of Plan E, I am requesting that City Councilor refrain from any further
participation, including discussion at Council, and any vote or decision that may result.
I am attaching here a wonderful resource compiled on the history of preservation in this
Commonwealth. It is not a tool we suddenly discovered so as to become rich overnight. I also
note that our Historic Commission, and especially the Neighborhood Conservation Districts, are
often cited nationally as a kind of gold standard.

Attachment: Marie Saccoccio Fwd Letter in response to Amendment to Chapter 2.78 entitled Historical Buildings and Landmarks.

Once the petition for establishing a Conservation District was filed we were pilloried all
over social media. Audrey Vetrano Cunningham and I were mocked incessantly with video clips
posted to twitter even ridiculing our "Italian accents." Bill Dines was portrayed as an out of
control privileged old white man. John Whisnant was mercilessly described as an old greedy
white man. Truly the basis was absurd since the positions we were taking were absolutely
supported in law. Our MGL c. 40(C) provides standing to owners. It is the law. There is no
value judgement we were making. It is the law.

Avon Hill Neighborhood Conservation
District Commission et al.[1]
No. 0304830
Superior Court of Massachusetts
November 22, 2004
Opinion No.: 86756
As-is Docket Number: 03-04830
Venue: Middlesex
Judge (with first initial, no space for
Sullivan, Dorsey, and Walsh): Houston, J.
Opinion
Title:
MEMORANDUM
OF
DECISION AND ORDER ON PLAINTIFFS'
MOTION
FOR
JUDGMENT
ON
THE
PLEADINGS
This is an appeal from a decision of the Avon
Hill
Neighborhood
Conservation
District
Commission ("Commission") denying plaintiff's
application for a certificate of appropriateness to
build a garage in the front setback of their
property. This appeal is pursuant to G.L.c. 40C,
§12A. Plaintiff moves for judgment on the
pleadings pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c).[2]
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs, John and Julia Bagalay, submitted
an application for a certificate of appropriateness
to the Commission to construct a 21' x 22' garage
within the front setback of their home. It is
undisputed that the proposed design was by the
original architect of the Bagalay's home, was
consistent with the historical and architectural
character of the home, and was consistent with
the historical and architectural character of the
entire neighborhood. After two public hearings
and a site visit, the Commission voted
unanimously to deny the application. The

Bagalays appealed to the Cambridge Historical
Commission.
The
Cambridge
Historical
Commission failed to act on the appeal within
thirty days from the date of filing, thereby
entitling the Bagalays to an appeal before this
court, pursuant to G.L.c. 40C, §12A and
Cambridge Municipal Code, 2.78.240.
DISCUSSION
The superior court may only annul a decision
of a historic district commission if: (1) the
decision exceeds the authority of the commission,
or (2) the decision is unsupported by the
evidence. G.L.c. 40C, §12A. Two courts have
refined this standard using somewhat similar
language. In Marr v. Back Bay Architectural
Comm'n, the court stated that a historic district
commission decision may be annulled if: (1) the
reasons given on the face of the decision are
insufficient in law to warrant the commission's
decision, or (2) if the reasons given on the face of
the decision are unwarranted by the evidence. See
23 Mass.App.Ct. 679, 683-84 (1987). In Gumley
v. Board of Selectmen of Nantucket, the court
stated that a decision may be annulled if: (1) the
decision is based on legally untenable grounds, or
(2) the decision is "unreasonable, whimsical,
capricious or arbitrary." See 371 Mass. 718, 724
(1977) citing MacGibbon v. Board of Appeals of
Duxbury, 356 Mass. 635, 638-39 (1970).[3]
The plaintiff attempts to argue that the
Commission fails both prongs of the inquiry. As to
the first prong, plaintiff claims that the
Commission failed to consider the statutory
criteria of "appropriateness,"[4] specifically,
"architectural value and significance," and instead
denied plaintiffs' application based solely on a
legally untenable valuation of public space over
private space.
The certified record clearly reveals that the
Commission considered the "architectural value
and significance" of the proposed garage as well
as its "relation to the land area... and to
buildings... in the vicinity..." G.L.c. 40C, §7.[5]
Furthermore, the Commission's consideration of
the relative value of public space, on a case by

(Mass. Super. 2004)

Packet Pg. 176

case basis, clearly falls within the specific
statutory
mandate
for
Historic
District
Commissions. G.L.c. 40C, §2 ("The purpose of
this chapter is to promote the educational,
cultural, economic and general welfare of the
public through the preservation and protection of
the distinctive characteristics of buildings and
places significant in the history of the
commonwealth... through the maintenance and
improvement of settings for such buildings and
places...") (emphasis added). The protection of
historically significant public space is also
included among the statutory criteria of
appropriateness. See G.L.c. 40C, §7 ("[T]he
commission shall consider, among other
things[6]... the building... in relation to the land
area upon which the building... is situated... and
the commission may in appropriate cases
impose... set-back requirements...") (emphasis
added); see also Cambridge Municipal Code,
2.78.220.
Therefore, to the extent the application was
denied based upon the incongruousness of the
front setback garage to the public's enjoyment of
the "place" of Avon Hill, and the incongruousness
of the front setback garage to the "setting" in
which Avon Hill's historic houses reside, such
basis for decision was entirely appropriate under
the law.
Turning to the second prong of the inquiry,
the court will not intrude upon the discretion
granted the Commission by the legislature to
make such a determination of incongruity unless
such
determination
was
"unreasonable,
whimsical, capricious or arbitrary" in light of the
evidence before the court.[7] Gumley, 371 Mass. at
724. The evidence before the court is the certified
record dated March 25, 2004, and upon this
record, the Commission's determination that the
proposed siting of the garage was incongruous to
the historic character of Avon Hill is entirely
reasonable and cannot be said to be whimsical,
capricious, or arbitrary.
Plaintiffs' assertions to the contrary are
meritless: (1) that the Commission ignored the
unanimous support of neighbors for the plaintiffs'

project is of no momentùthe Commission is
tasked by c. 40C with promoting "the general
welfare of the public" and not simply the interests
of a few abutters; (2) that there exists a maximum
30% lot coverage cap in the applicable zoning
ordinance does not mean there exists a
"certificate of appropriateness by right" for all
projects falling below the maximum; (3) the
Commission agreed that the garage's architecture
was significant, beautiful, and congruous to the
neighborhood, but nowhere in the statute does it
state that architectural factors are more
important than the physical siting of the garage or
the siting's effect on the public's enjoyment of an
historic streetscape; and (4) any concern
expressed by the Commission about setting
unfavorable precedent is a mere statement of the
consequences the Commission believed in good
faith would attend the improper granting of a
certificate of appropriateness. That the certificate
would be improper was based upon a careful and
reasoned judgment in light of the statutory
criteria of appropriatenessùa judgment which the
court may not replace with its own.
ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby
ORDERED that judgment enter AFFIRMING the
decision of the Avon Hill Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission denying
Plaintiffs' application for a certificate of
appropriateness.

Some examples of the Commission's
consideration of the statutory criteria are as
follows: "Mr. Irving said... the proposed garage
worked with the main house and was subsidiary
to it." C.R. at 101; "Ms. Norfleet commended the
applicants for the original drawings... [S]he
disagreed that the garage would not detract from
the pedestrian experience of the street." C.R. at
101; "[Ms. Born] said the information and design
were very good." C.R. at 102; "Ms. Born
recommended that the motion deny the
application based on the proposed siting of the
garage but not on the architectural design of the
garage building." C.R. at 118.
[5]

"Among other things" are several "General
Conservation Standards" as set forth in the "Avon
Hill Neighborhood Conservation District Order
(June 15, 1998)." C.R. at 79. The general
conservation standards are to "conserve the
historic
development
patterns
of
the
neighborhood, including its green space, open
vistas, generous setbacks, and predominantly low
density lot coverage [and to] enhance the
pedestrian's
visual
enjoyment
of
the
neighborhood's buildings, landscapes and
structures..." These standards permissibly expand
upon the statutory criteria of appropriateness and
conform to the explicit purpose of c. 40C as
delineated in §2.
[6]

Plaintiffs urge this court to rule that the
Commission did not give "sufficient weight to the
statutory factors and criteria of 'appropriateness,'
" specifically, the architectural significance of the
garage and its relation to surrounding buildings
and the land. Plaintiffs' brief at 3-4 (emphasis
added). The amount of weight to grant the various
[7]

pieces of evidence before the Commission falls
solely within the discretion of the Commission.

The TOWN OF BROOKLINE, Defendant.
PERMIT SESSION CASE No. 18

Dated: September 4, 2019

DECISION ON CROSS-MOTIONS
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Howard P. Speicher, Associate Justice
INTRODUCTION
*1 “You call this a barn? This looks like a stable.”

“Well, if you look at it, it's a barn; if
you smell it, it's a stable.”

“Well, let's just look at it.” 1
Sometimes one's perception of the nature of a thing (or in this
case, a law) depends on one's perspective or on the context
in which it is perceived. In the present dispute, plaintiff
Hancock Village I, LLC (“plaintiff”) perceives Brookline's
Neighborhood Conservation District Bylaw as a zoning
bylaw illegitimately masquerading as a general bylaw in order
to stymie the redevelopment of the plaintiff's property. The
town of Brookline (“Brookline” or “the town”) perceives
the same bylaw as a legitimate exercise of its home rule
powers to enact a general bylaw. According to the plaintiff,
however, Brookline has chosen to view the bylaw from a
perspective that willfully and conveniently ignores its true
substance and nature. In short, the plaintiff contends that the
town has elected not to smell the stable so that it might insist
that it is a barn.

4.36.c

In 2011, the town of Brookline adopted a “neighborhood
conservation district” bylaw. This bylaw would serve to create
local commissions with the ability to regulate the dimensions,
layout, and design of construction in designated districts.
Brookline adopted the bylaw not as an amendment to its
zoning bylaw pursuant to G. L. c 40A, or as a historic district
bylaw pursuant to G. L. c. 40C, but as a general town bylaw
pursuant to its general home rule powers.
The first district established under the bylaw comprised
solely the entire Brookline portion of the 70-acre property
of plaintiff. 2 Plaintiff filed this action seeking to invalidate
both the bylaw establishing the framework for the creation
of neighborhood conservation districts in the town, as well
as the particular section of the bylaw creating the district
encompassing the plaintiff's property. It contends that the
bylaw was not a proper exercise of Brookline's general police
power, as its subject matter falls squarely under the purview
of G. L. c 40A and G. L. c. 40C, and must therefore have been
enacted pursuant to the procedures provided in those statutes,
and with the substantive protections and mechanisms required
by those statutes.
For reasons discussed below, I find and rule that although the
Neighborhood Conservation District Bylaw and the related
Hancock Village Neighborhood Conservation District Bylaw
were in the form of general bylaws, they are both properly
characterized as zoning bylaws that fail to comply with
the procedural and substantive requirements of the Zoning
Act, G. L. c. 40A, and that further, to the extent they are
characterized as historic district bylaws, they fail to comply
with the procedural and substantive requirements of G. L. c.
40C. Accordingly, they will be declared to be invalid and of
no force and effect.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
*2 On April 13, 2018, plaintiff Hancock Village I, LLC
filed a six-count complaint against defendant the town of
Brookline seeking declarations to the effect that Section 5.10
of the Brookline General Bylaws was invalidly enacted and
is of no force and effect. Counts I through IV seek declaratory
judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231A. Count I requests a
declaration that the bylaw in question was enacted without
compliance with the procedures of

Brookline filed an Answer on May 14, 2019, and an
Amended Answer on May 21, 2019. The parties attended a
case management conference on May 29, 2018. In accordance
with an agreed-upon schedule, on February 15, 2019 the
parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and
responses to each other's motions. A hearing was held before
me on the parties' respective motions on May 7, 2019, after
which I took the motions under advisement.

The following material facts are found in the record for
purposes of Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, and are undisputed for the
purposes of the pending motions for summary judgment:
1. Hancock Village is a 70-acre mixed-use development
consisting of 789 garden-style apartments, 530 of which are
in Brookline, with the remainder in the 20-acre portion of
the property that lies over the city line in Boston. Hancock
3

2. The vast majority of the Brookline portion of Hancock
Village is located in the M-O.5 (Apartment) zone,
Brookline's lowest density apartment house district. 4 The
remainder is in a single-family district.
3. In August, 2011, the plaintiff submitted an application for
“Major Impact Project Review” to the Brookline Building
Commissioner, which is a preliminary step in applying
for a special permit under the Brookline Zoning Bylaw.
The application was for the development of thirty-one
detached single-family homes and 162 dwelling units in a
multifamily building. 5
4. In the fall of 2011, two warrant articles – Article 5
and Article 6 – were proposed, and were scheduled for
consideration at a November 15, 2011 Special Town
Meeting. 6

Conservation Districts (“NCDs”) in Brookline. 7
6. The petitioner's description of the NCD Bylaw that
accompanied the warrant for Article 5 described NCDs as
a tool “designed to be more neighborhood specific than
the Town's Local Historic District (LHD) By-Law ... The
guidelines for a particular NCD, unlike an LHD, can be
focused less on preservation of the specific details of each
structure and more on preserving the general character
of a neighborhood, by ensuring that the general scale,
composition, massing and design is compatible with the
site as well as other existing structures in the surrounding
area.” It stated that “the guidelines for an NCD could
address landscape and urban issues such as protection of
landscapes, open spaces, viewsheds and paving without
grade changes.” 8

UNDISPUTED FACTS

Village is owned by plaintiff Hancock Village I, LLC.

5. Article 5 would insert Section 5.10 into Brookline's
General Bylaws; this section, titled “Neighborhood
Conservation Districts” (the “NCD Bylaw”), set out
the framework for the operation of Neighborhood

7. Article 6 would insert Section 5.10.3.d.1 into this section,
creating the Hancock Village Neighborhood Conservation
District (“Hancock Village NCD”), which was to be an
NCD applicable solely to the plaintiff's property. 9 This
was the first time an NCD had been on the warrant for any
town meeting in Brookline. 10
*3 8. These articles were proposed as general town bylaws
under the town's home rule power, rather than as zoning
bylaws adopted pursuant to the procedures in G. L. c. 40A.
9. Articles 5 and 6 were discussed and debated at seventeen
meetings of various town boards and committees. 11
10. Article 5 and Article 6 were approved by Town Meeting in
November 2011. Article 5 was passed by a recorded ballot
vote of 183 in favor, 35 opposed, with 5 abstentions. Article
6 was passed by a counted vote of 200 in favor and 24
opposed. 12
11. On May 30, 2012, the Attorney General approved the
adoption of Article 5 and Article 6; however, she noted that
the “question is close” as to whether the proposed bylaw
should have been adopted as a zoning bylaw. 13

comprehensive permit approvals pursuant to G. L. c. 40B
for the further development of Hancock Village. The

March 11, 2015. That appeal was dismissed by order of the
Land Court (Piper, J.) on July 17, 2018. 15
13. Plaintiff has made at least six applications to the Hancock
Village NCD Commission for work on existing homes.
None of these have been denied. 16
14. On April 3, 2018, plaintiff filed the present action seeking
to invalidate the NCD Bylaw contained in Section 5.10 as a
whole, including both its establishment of the general NCD
framework as well as the particular Hancock Village NCD
contained in Section 5.10.3.d.1. 17
The NCD Bylaw
15. Section 5.10.1 of the NCD Bylaw, which sets forth the
bylaw's purpose, states, in part:
This by-law is enacted for the purposes of preserving
and protecting groups of buildings and their settings that
are architecturally or historically significant; preserving
and protecting the layout of neighborhoods or historical
subdivisions of neighborhoods, vehicular and pedestrian
circulation patterns, green spaces, landscapes, and
viewsheds that are historically significant or significant to
the character of the town or its neighborhoods; preserving
and protecting distinctive features of the architectural,
cultural, economic, political, or social history of the town
and its neighborhoods, and limiting the detrimental effect
of alterations, additions, demolition and new construction
on the character of the town and its neighborhoods.
Through this by-law, alterations, additions, demolition,
and new construction may be reviewed for compatibility,
including without limitation design, massing, topography,
scale and materials with the existing buildings, green
spaces, open spaces, courtyards, landscapes, neighborhood
and subdivision plans and layouts, circulation patterns,
viewsheds, settings, and neighborhood character. 18
16. Pursuant to Section 5.10.4 of the NCD Bylaw, each
NCD is to be overseen by a commission (“NCD

“exercis[ing] its powers in administering and regulating
the alteration of buildings, other structures and natural and
manmade elements within such NCD as set forth under
the procedures and criteria established in this by-law,”
and “review[ing] all Reviewable Projects in the NCD,
including without limitation new construction, demolition
or alterations that affect the landscape of topography,
the exterior architectural features of buildings and other
structures, or the mass and siting of buildings and other
structures.” 20
*4 18. Section 5.10.2 defines “Reviewable Project”
as including “(i) a change to a building or
other structure or part thereof such as removal,
construction, reconstruction, restoration, renovation,
replication, rehabilitation, addition, partial or total
demolition and other similar activities, or the construction
of a new building or other structure or part thereof ...
(iii) addition or replacement of doors or windows ... (iv)
a change to a site that includes constructing, placing,
erecting, installing, enlarging, or moving a building or
other structure or similar activities; (v) the removal or
addition of streets, driveways, parking areas, walkways, or
paved surfaces...” 21
19. Section 5.10.5 provides that “a building permit (which
shall include permits for demolition) or an occupancy
permit may not be issued for an altered building, structure,
site or property or other Reviewable Project without the
prior issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.” 22
20. Section 5.10.7 states in part: “The Commission shall
determine whether the proposed alteration or other
Reviewable Project, including any modification thereof
agreeable to the applicant, is compatible with the specific
design guidelines of the applicable district and the purposes
of the bylaw.” It further states that a Certificate of
Appropriateness will be issued if the Commission deems it
compatible, and denied if it is deemed incompatible. 23

character of the NCD.”

24

22. Section 5.10.3.d.1 establishes the Hancock Village
NCD, and provides a number of specific “design
guidelines” for the NCD. Per these guidelines, elements
that “shall be compatible with the existing buildings
in the district” include: “[t]he architectural design and
building materials” (Section 5.10.3.d.1.i); the elements of
the façade, such as windows, doors, and trim (Section
5.10.3.d.1.iii); the “shape, pitch, style, and type of roof
(Section 5.10.3.d.1.iv); and “[t]he size, height and massing
of a building or other structure.” (Section 5.10.3.d.1.ii). 25
23. As to this final category, Section 5.10.3.d.1.ii of the
Bylaw goes on to state: “Compatible building size, height
and massing shall include, but not be limited to limited
to [sic]: (a) No building over 2 ½ stories in height ...
shall be constructed. (b) In relation to any abutting single
family, detached homes, any new single-family homes shall
be similarly oriented, have similar rear yard depths, and
similar distance between dwelling units.” 26
24. Section 5.10.3.d.1.v also states that the project shall
“maintain the spatial organization of the district,” and
shall not have a “significant negative impact on historical
architectural or landscape elements ....” It further provides
that “[s]ignificant negative impacts shall include, but not
be limited to: ... (d) Addition of new impervious surfaces
within 100 feet of abutting properties, and (e) Loss of open
space through building coverage exceeding 20% of the area
of the district ....” 27
The Zoning Bylaw
25. As provided in Section 1.00, the purposes of the
Brookline Zoning Bylaw (the “Zoning Bylaw”) include
“(b) preventing overcrowding of land ... (e) preventing
undue concentration of population ... (j) encouraging the
preservation of historically and architecturally significant
structures; ... (l) providing for adequate open space,
including landscaped and usable open space, public shade
trees and other landscape and natural features.” 28
*5 26. Sections 5.00 – 5.92 of the Zoning Bylaw comprise
extensive dimensional regulations imposed on districts
throughout the town. Table 5.01, in particular, provides
specific height maximums, minimum lot sizes, open

space requirements, minimum setback requirements,
and floor area ratio maximums. 29
27. Section 5.06 of the Zoning Bylaw provides “Special
District Regulations” for certain areas of the town on the
basis that “unique land use, environmental, architectural
and other physical conditions present within the Town
require detailed neighborhood, district or site planning
and design review to insure: orderly and planned growth
and development; [and] historic and natural resource
conservation; residential neighborhood preservation ....”
These Special District Regulations are to be established
by Town Meeting “from time to time, in accordance with
M.G.L. Chapter 40A.” 30
28. Special District Regulations established under Section
5.06 impose dimensional requirements, such as maximum
height, minimum open space, and maximum floor area
ratio, which differ from those which would otherwise be
required by Table 5.01.
29. Section 5.09 of the Zoning Bylaw, which is applicable
in a number of designated areas in the town, establishes a
“Design Review” process with the purpose of “provid[ing]
individual detailed review of certain uses and structures
which have a substantial impact on the character of the
Town and upon traffic, utilities and property values therein,
thereby affecting the public health, safety, and general
welfare thereof.” 31
30. This process allows the Planning Board and Zoning Board
of Appeals to review proposed construction for, among
other things, “consisten[cy] with “use, scale, yard setbacks
and architecture of existing buildings and the overall
streetscape of the surrounding area” (Section 5.09(4)(c));
“the location and configuration of open space” (Section
5.09(4)(d)); the impact of layout on vehicular circulation
(Section 5.09(4)(e)); and consideration of “historic,
traditional or significant uses, structures or architectural
elements ....” (Section 5.09(4)(k)). 32

JURISDICTION
*6 The Land Court has exclusive jurisdiction over actions
brought pursuant to G. L. c. 240, § 14A for the determination
of the validity of an ordinance “adopted under the provisions
of chapter forty A or under any special law relating to zoning,
so called, which purports to restrict or limit the present

This court likewise has jurisdiction over the plaintiff's counts
for declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A. Under that
statute, the Land Court may “on appropriate proceedings
make binding declarations of right, duty, status and other legal
relations sought thereby ... in any case in which an actual
controversy has arisen and is specifically set forth in the
pleadings.” G. L. c. 231A, § 1. “A landowner who seeks to
challenge the validity of a zoning by-law where there is an
actual controversy may bring a proceeding in the Land Court
under G. L. c. 231A or under G. L. c. 240, § 14A.” Mantoni
v. Board of Appeals, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 273, 275, 609 N.E.2d
502 (1993).
Construing the plaintiff's constitutional claims as a subset of
its G. L. c. 240, § 14A claim, they may properly be heard
in the Land Court as well. Typically, a plaintiff must notify
the Attorney General of constitutional claims pursued within
the context of a declaratory judgment action. See id., quoting
Gamache v. Acushnet, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 223, 438
N.E.2d 82 (1982) (“If the party seeks to involve a question of
constitutionality in the declaratory judgment proceeding, ‘the
attorney general shall also be notified of the proceeding.’ ”).
The record reflects the plaintiff's previous communications
to the Attorney General strenuously objecting to the passage
of the Warrant Articles; however, there is no indication one
way or the other whether the plaintiff has indeed notified the
Attorney General of the present action. Nonetheless, no notice
to the Attorney General is required for an action under G. L.
c. 240, § 14A. Id. Accordingly, the Land Court may maintain

jurisdiction over the plaintiff's constitutional claims insofar as
they are considered to be incorporated into its G. L. c. 240,
§ 14A action.
The Land Court independently has jurisdiction over the
present action because it was properly filed in the Permit
Session. Pursuant to

G. L. c. 185, § 3A:

The permit session shall have original
jurisdiction, concurrently with the
superior court department, over civil
actions in whole or part: (a) based
on or arising out of the appeal
of any municipal, regional or state
permit, order, certificate or approval,
or the denial thereof, concerning the
use or development of real property,
including without limitation appeals
of such permits, orders, certificates or
approvals, or denials thereof, arising
under or based on or relating to
chapter ... 40A to 40C, inclusive, ...or
any local bylaw or ordinance; (b)
seeking equitable or declaratory relief
(i) designed to secure or protect the
issuance of any municipal, regional or
state permit or approval concerning the
use or development of real property
or (ii) challenging the interpretation or
application of any municipal, regional
or state rules, regulations, statutes,
laws, bylaws, ordinances concerning
any permit or approval; ...and (d) any
other claims between persons holding
any right, title or interest in land

board, authority, commission or public
official based on or arising out of
any action taken with respect to any

such land.” G. L. c c. 240, § 14A. “The primary purpose
of proceedings under § 14A is to determine how and with
what rights and limitations the land of the person seeking an
adjudication may be used under the provisions of a zoning
enactment in terms applicable to it, particularly where there

relief.” Hansen & Donahue, Inc. v. Town of Norwood, 61
Mass. App. Ct. 292, 295, 809 N.E.2d 1079 (2004). There is
no dispute that plaintiff is the owner of the land which is
subject to the challenged bylaw, and the nature of its challenge
– contending that the bylaw should have been, but was not,
enacted pursuant to G. L. c. 40A – falls within the purview of
the statute. See G. L. c. 240, § 14A; Valley Green Grow, Inc. v.
Town of Charlton, 27 LCR 99, 103 (2019) (Foster, J.) (“The
court sees little distinction between determining the validity

*7 Although not a direct appeal of a denial of a permit,
the plaintiff alleges in its complaint, and the record supports
the claim, that the adoption of the NCD Bylaw is a direct
response to, and improperly impacts plaintiff's efforts to
develop additional housing – both single-family units and
multi-family units – as well as other improvements on the
Hancock Village property. 33 In August 2011, the plaintiff
proposed a “major impact project” to add additional housing
at Hancock Village. 34 It is not in dispute that the proposal
to adopt the NCD Bylaw and the Hancock Village NCD
Bylaw was a direct response to this proposal. 35 Under
these circumstances, the Land Court's jurisdiction is properly
grounded in G. L. c. 185, § 3A, in addition to G. L. c. 240,
§ 14A and G. L. c. 231A.

Ng Bros. Constr., supra, 436 Mass. at 644, 766 N.E.2d 864.
In determining whether genuine issues of fact exist, the court
must draw all inferences from the underlying facts in the
light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. See

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS
The crux of this case is whether Brookline has impermissibly
circumvented G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40C by utilizing its
general home rule power to pass a bylaw that is, in truth,
either a zoning bylaw, a historic district bylaw, or both.
Plaintiff argues that the NCD Bylaw replicates the manner
of regulation governed by these two statutes, but evades
their mandatory procedural and substantive requirements
for enactment and administration. It also argues that the
provisions governing an NCD commission's power to impose
requirements are too vague to pass constitutional muster, and
deprive an applicant of due process. Brookline contends that
the effect of the NCD Bylaw is not to amend the Brookline
Zoning Bylaw, but rather to supplement it through land use
regulation not the exclusive domain of zoning. Similarly,
it argues that the NCD Bylaw differs from historic district
bylaws, and that G. L. c. 40C does not govern all bylaws that
happen to fall within the broad field of historic preservation.
Therefore, it contends, the NCD Bylaw was properly enacted
pursuant to the town's general police powers, and did not need
to adhere to the procedural requirements of either G. L. c. 40A
or G. L. c. 40C. Alternatively, it argues that, even if the NCD
Bylaw does fall under the ambit of these statutes, Brookline
substantially complied with the procedural requirements of
both. Brookline also repeatedly draws attention to the fact
that Neighborhood Conservation District bylaws have been
adopted in other Massachusetts municipalities as general
town bylaws, as they are seen as an effective alternative to
more traditional means of regulation. 36
I. THE NCD BYLAW IS PROPERLY CHARACTERIZED AS
A ZONING BYLAW AND WAS INVALIDLY ADOPTED AS
A GENERAL BYLAW
*8 Towns may enact “by-laws as an exercise of their
independent police powers but these powers cannot be
exercised in a manner which frustrates the purpose or
implementation of a general or special law enacted by
the Legislature in accordance with ... [art. 89, § 8, of
the Amendments to the Constitution].” Board of Appeals
of Hanover v. Housing Appeals Comm. in the Dept. of
Community Affairs, 363 Mass. 339, 360, 294 N.E.2d 393
(1973). A municipality's zoning power is “one category of the
more general police power, concerned specifically with the
regulation of land use,” and an exercise of its zoning power
must adhere to the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 40A.

implementation of the statute. See
id. As previously noted
by this court, “[t]he reason for this is that zoning bylaws have
different, stricter requirements for enactment than general
bylaws. A zoning bylaw must be reviewed by the planning
board in a public hearing and then reported on by the board,
and, crucially, may only be enacted by a two-thirds vote of
town meeting. General bylaws have no such requirements
—they may be enacted by a majority vote.” Valley Green
Grow, Inc. v. Town of Charlton, 27 LCR supra, at 105 (internal
citations omitted).
Brookline impermissibly evaded these stricter requirements
in a circumstance where they were necessary. Brookline's
NCD Bylaw is, in its fundamental substance, a creature of
zoning. It regulates subject matter falling within both the
traditional definition of zoning as well as the existing purview
of the Brookline Zoning Bylaw. Despite this, Brookline
enacted the NCD Bylaw as a general town bylaw, and made
no attempt to follow the particular procedures laid out in G. L.
c. 40A. Accordingly, having failed to strictly comply with the
requirements for enactment of a zoning bylaw, Section 5.10
of the Brookline General Bylaws is invalid, and of no force
and effect.
A. The NCD Bylaw Addresses Subjects Traditionally
Classified as Zoning Under Chapter 40A
The NCD Bylaw has the purpose and effect of regulating
subject matter traditionally falling under the ambit of zoning.
This is a significant factor indicating that a bylaw is governed
by G. L. c. 40A, and must be enacted pursuant to its
procedural requirements. In
Rayco Inv. Corp. v. Bd. of
Selectmen of Raynham, supra, 368 Mass. at 391, 331 N.E.2d
910, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that a bylaw
limiting the number of trailer park licenses that the town
could issue was not a proper exercise of the town's general
police power, as the “nature and effect of the ... bylaw is that
of an exercise of the zoning power.” It noted that “similar
by-laws have been adopted in the past by municipalities as
zoning by-laws,” and that “[t]here seems little doubt that the
1971 by-law could be viewed within the scope of the town's
zoning power.”

Id. On the opposite side of the same coin,

in Lovequist v. Conservation Commissioner of Dennis, 379
Mass. 7, 13, 393 N.E.2d 858 (1979), the court held that it

was not improper for the town of Dennis to enact a wetlands
bylaw through its police power rather than as a zoning bylaw;
and like in
Rayco, the court's analysis looked in part to
the universe of subject matter conventionally regulated by
zoning. It noted that the bylaw was not a “zoning measure
for the reason that [it] manifests neither the purpose nor the
effects of a zoning regulation. The Dennis by-law does not
prohibit or permit any particular listed uses of land or the
construction of buildings or the location of businesses or
residences in a comprehensive fashion. On its face it does
not deny or invite permission to build any structure. It does
not regulate density.” Id. The Court further elaborated that
the wetlands values protected by the bylaw (such as water
supply, groundwater, and flood control) were not “typical
of the concerns usually reflected in the zoning process,”
which instead included such things as “the character of the
community and compatibility of nearby land uses.”

Id.

Brookline relies heavily on
Lovequist, citing to the
proposition therein that “[w]e do not consider all ordinances
or by-laws that regulate land use to be zoning laws,” and
arguing that the NCD Bylaw regulates land use in a manner
that need not be classified as zoning. It is true that the court
in
Lovequist recognized that “municipal regulations that
simply overlap with what may be the province of a local
zoning authority” do not necessarily need to be “treated as
zoning enactments which must be promulgated in accordance
with the requirements of G. L. c. 40A.”
Id. at 14, 393
N.E.2d 858. However, the court made clear that such overlap
was permissible in circumstances where “we think it manifest
that [the bylaw] is not a zoning regulation.”
Id. Cf.
American Sign & Indicator Corp. v. Framingham, 9 Mass.
App. Ct. 66, 69, 399 N.E.2d 41 (1980) (sign bylaw's “overlap
with what may be the province of a local zoning authority”
did not require it to be enacted as a zoning regulation where
it “ ‘manifests neither the purpose nor the effects of a
zoning regulation’ and does not involve most of the typical
concerns reflected in zoning laws”);
Hamel v. Bd. of
Health of Edgartown, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 422, 664 N.E.2d
1199, (1996) (board of health sewage flow regulation which
overlapped with zoning's use regulations was permissible
where the purpose and effect was “the maintenance of safe
drinking water in the geographical area concerned.”). Here,
the NCD Bylaw does not incidentally overlap with the domain
of zoning while embodying a different purpose and effect.

Mass. 385, 392 n.4, 331 N.E.2d 910 (1975). A municipality

to G. L. c. 40A; doing so would frustrate the purpose and

4.36.c

Packet7Pg. 185

Instead, the NCD Bylaw usurps that domain wholesale,
purpose, effect, and mechanisms all.
*9 All that the Dennis bylaw in
Lovequist was not, the
NCD Bylaw is. The essential focus of the NCD Bylaw's
purpose clause is the protection of the “character of the
town and its neighborhoods” as established by the physical
and aesthetic characteristics of its structures and layout.
This loudly echoes the central objectives of zoning. Zoning
primarily operates to “balanc[e] rights or privileges of use
with the character of neighborhoods, a task which necessarily
calls into play issues of size, location, setback, traffic, and the
sundry other matters addressed in local land use and zoning
bylaws and ordinances.”
Rogers v. Town of Norfolk, 432
Mass. 374, 382, 734 N.E.2d 1143 (2000). Protecting the
character of the neighborhood as reflected in its physical
structures is indeed a familiar refrain in the context of zoning.
See
Lovequist v. Conservation Com. of Dennis, supra,
379 Mass. at 14, 393 N.E.2d 858 (“[T]he character of the
community and the compatibility of nearby land uses” is a
“typical concern[ ] usually reflected in the zoning process.”);
Trustees of Tufts College v. City of Medford, 415 Mass.
753, 758, 616 N.E.2d 433 (1993) (“[P]reserving the character
of an adjacent neighborhood” is one of the “purposes sought
to be achieved by local zoning”);
Emond v. Board of
Appeals of Uxbridge, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 632, 541
N.E.2d 380 (1989) ( “[T]o preserve the character of ... the
neighborhood is one of the ‘broad purposes of zoning’ ”);
Fabiano v. City of Boston, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 286, 730
N.E.2d 311 (2000) (the goal of “preserv[ing] within reason the
historic residential character of the [neighborhood] ... is a goal
surely within the purview of the [Boston zoning] enabling
act.”).
The NCD Bylaw's mimicry of conventional zoning is likewise
apparent in the content and effect of its substantive provisions.
“[Z]oning ordinances or by-laws govern ‘the use of land
and the size, location and use of buildings.’ ”
Hamel v.
Bd. of Health of Edgartown, supra, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at
422, 664 N.E.2d 1199, quoting
MacGibbon v. Board of
Appeals of Duxbury, 356 Mass. 635, 636, 255 N.E.2d 347
(1970). As provided in the Act of the Legislature revamping
G. L. c. 40A, St. 1975, c. 808 § 2A, zoning bylaws achieve
the purposes of zoning by regulating such subjects as “size,
height, bulk, location, and use of structures ...; areas and
dimensions of land ... to be occupied or unoccupied by uses

4.36.c

and structures, courts, yards and open spaces; ... and the
development of the natural scenic and aesthetic qualities of
the community.” The court in
Lovequist itself helpfully
identified a number of characteristics of conventional zoning,
including regulation of density, uses of land, construction and
location of structures, as well as provision of a means to
apply for permission to build structures. See
Lovequist v.
Conservation Com. of Dennis, supra, 379 Mass. at 13, 393
N.E.2d 858.
Here, the NCD Bylaw's definition of “Reviewable Project”
itself makes clear that the NCD Bylaw is indeed almost
entirely concerned with the construction and siting of
buildings. Its provisions go on to provide for regulation of
the dimensional characteristics of such reviewable projects
in order to manage the neighborhood's density and physical
character: at the heart of the NCD Bylaw are the NCD
Commission's powers to regulate “alterations, additions,
demolition and new construction, and its powers to consider
“without limitation” features including “design, massing,
topography, scale and materials ... green spaces, open spaces,
courtyards, landscapes, neighborhood and subdivision plans
and layouts” among others. 37 The Hancock Village NCD
even raids the traditional zoning toolbox for particular
dimensional controls, such as the delineation of specific
height, setback, and open space regulations. 38 There can
be no question that, unlike the bylaw in
Lovequist, the
NCD Bylaw has “the purpose [and] the effects of a zoning
regulation.”

Lovequist v. Conservation Com. of Dennis,

supra, 379 Mass. at 13, 393 N.E.2d 858. 39
B. The NCD Bylaw Addresses Subjects Already Governed
by the Brookline Zoning Bylaw
*10 The second factor compelling the conclusion that the
NCD Bylaw falls within the scope of Chapter 40A is the fact
that its subject matter has, in fact, been previously regulated
in Brookline by the Zoning Bylaw. “If the municipality
has a history of regulating that subject matter through its
zoning bylaw, then it can only be further regulated through
the zoning bylaw, not through a general municipal bylaw.”
Valley Green Grow, Inc. v. Town of Charlton, supra, 27
LCR at 105. In
Rayco, the court considered it “significant
that prior to the adoption of the 1971 by-law the town's
zoning by-law dealt specifically with the subject of trailer
parks,” and that “the zoning by-law purported to cover
this subject in a comprehensive fashion and it follows that

the 1971 by-law necessarily modified the earlier by-law.”
Rayco Inv. Corp., supra, 368 Mass. at 393, 331 N.E.2d
910. Similarly, in Spenlinhauer v. Town of Barnstable, 80
Mass. App. Ct. 134, 140, 951 N.E.2d 967 (2011), the town
adopted a general ordinance, not a zoning bylaw, regulating
the subject of parking. The Appeals Court noted that the
town had “historically regulated off street parking through
its zoning bylaws, not its general ordinances or bylaws,” and
did indeed have a “comprehensive bylaw regulating parking”
enacted through its zoning power. Id. The new parking bylaw,
by comparison, was intended to address the impact of parking
on the “character and quality of the town's neighborhoods,
precisely the target at which the town's zoning ordinance
is so thoroughly and comprehensively aimed.” Id. at 141,
951 N.E.2d 967. Accordingly, the court concluded that “the
challenged ordinance is a matter for regulation through
the town's zoning power, not through its use of a general
ordinance.” Id.
Given the above conclusion that the NCD Bylaw regulates
subject matter conventionally at the heart of zoning, it
is unsurprising that those subjects are, in fact, already
comprehensively governed by the Brookline Zoning Bylaw.
The Zoning Bylaw's stated purposes reflect those expressly
outlined in the NCD Bylaw – of particular note are the
purposes of “encouraging the preservation of historically
and architecturally significant structures” and “providing for
adequate open space, including landscaped and usable open
space, public shade trees and other landscape and natural
features.” 40
The mechanisms by which the NCD Bylaw sets out to achieve
these objectives replicate, and indeed replace, those already
present in the Zoning Bylaw. Table 5.01 of the Zoning Bylaw
contains the typical dimensional controls, common across
all zoning ordinances and bylaws, which regulate height,
setbacks, open space, and density of construction in the
town. These provisions are intended to control the massing,
scale, and siting of structures and buildings. The NCD
Bylaw displaces the Zoning Bylaw by generally empowering
the NCD Commission to set its own requirements related
to precisely these same categories. Section 5.10.3.c allows
the Commission to “impose dimensional requirements that
further the purposes of this by-law, including without
limitation preventing Reviewable Projects inconsistent with
the historic or architectural aspects, scale or massing,
neighborhood or subdivision plan or layout, circulation
patterns, or green space, open space, landscape, vegetation

4.36.c

or viewshed character of the NCD.” 41 Section 5.10.3.d.1
goes even further to impose its own version of particular
dimensional controls already expressly provided in the
Zoning Bylaw: it requires 80% open space, a 100 foot
setback, 42 and a maximum building height of two and
a half stories, 43 thus baldly supplanting the dimensional
requirements set forth in Table 5.01 of the Zoning Bylaw. The
NCD Bylaw's usurpation of the Zoning Bylaw's domain is
made expressly clear by the concluding statements in both
Section 5.10.11 and 5.10.3.d that, where the NCD Bylaw
imposes stricter requirements than other bylaws, the NCD
Bylaw shall prevail. 44
In fact, in replacing baseline dimensional requirements for
a designated locale, the NCD Bylaw appears to operate in a
similar manner to a mechanism already contained with the
Zoning Bylaw – the creation of Special Districts. Pursuant to
Section 5.06 of the Zoning Bylaw, the town may establish
Special Districts encompassing certain areas of the town;
these are meant to address “unique land use, environmental,
architectural and other physical conditions” of certain
neighborhoods which require particularized regulation. To
address these factors, Special Districts are subjected to
dimensional requirements which differ from those otherwise
imposed by Table 5.01. Thus, not only is the imposition of
generalized dimensional controls the province of the Zoning
Bylaw, but even the act of designating special areas for
particularized regulation is as well. The NCD Bylaw cannot
usurp this power by filling geographic holes which have
purposefully been left free of such particularized regulation.
Brookline's argument that its NCD districts “supplement”
the Zoning Bylaw is no different from the town's unavailing
argument in Spenlinhauer that, because the “detailed and
extensive” parking regulations in the zoning bylaw did not
apply to single family homes, parking for that use could
be properly regulated by a supplementary general bylaw.
The court in Spenlinhauer rejected this, holding that the
framework's inapplicability to a particular use “does not
create a hole the town can fill through enactment of general
ordinances.” Spenlinhauer v. Town of Barnstable, supra, 80
Mass. App. Ct. at 140, 951 N.E.2d 967.
*11 In sum, the NCD Bylaw's imposition of its own
dimensional requirements – whether discretionarily crafted
by the Commission, or delineated by the bylaw itself –
regulates a field already comprehensively addressed by the
Zoning Bylaw, and for precisely the same purpose. Though
Brookline contends that the NCD Bylaw's regulation of these

then consider those recommendations as an additional factor
when reviewing special permit applications. This design
review includes consideration of “historic, traditional or
significant uses, structures or architectural elements.” For one
particular district, it provides that “any new structure shall
be harmoniously related to nearby pre-existing structures and
the street façade in terms of color, texture, materials, scale,
height, setbacks, roof and cornice lines, signs, and design
elements ....” 45
Plaintiff nonetheless agrees that the preservation of historic

II. THE NCD BYLAW IMPERMISSIBLY INVADES THE
PROVINCE OF CHAPTER 40C
Brookline next points to the fact that, apart from its
dimensional regulations, the NCD Bylaw also regulates
aesthetic architectural and landscaping elements through
“design guidelines.” It contends that design has been
traditionally regulated through Brookline's general bylaws,
rather than the Zoning Bylaw, as the latter only regulates such
aesthetic and design elements for certain uses or structures or
in certain areas of the town. Therefore, it argues, the subject
matter regulated by the NCD Bylaw does not overlap with
that of the Zoning Bylaw. Nor does it, Brookline contends,
improperly overlap with G. L. c. 40C's regulation of historic
districts, but instead acts as a permissible alternative to
the manner of regulation envisioned by that statute. Even
assuming that the NCD Bylaw's “design guidelines” could
be practically severed from its dimensional regulations – a
highly unlikely proposition, given the manner in which they
are closely intertwined – the town's contention that they are
permissible subjects of the town's general police power is still
unavailing, as they do indeed intrude upon the domain of G.
L. c. 40C.
First, it should be noted that the Zoning Bylaw does
itself regulate design to a certain degree. Section 5.06 of
the Zoning Bylaw imposes Special District Regulations
on certain designated Special Districts in the town; these
address “unique land use, environmental, architectural and
other physical conditions” of particular neighborhoods which
require further regulation. Not only do these Special District
regulations alter the dimensional requirements to which the
district would otherwise be subject, but they also subject
an applicant to design review pursuant to Section 5.09 of
the Zoning Bylaw. Section 5.09's Design Review Guidelines
provide for “individual detailed review of certain uses and
structures which have a substantial impact upon the character
of the Town....” This requires the Planning Board to submit
design recommendations to the Board of Appeals, which must

architectural design elements is indeed “more definitively” 46
regulated under Section 5.6 of the town's general bylaws,
titled “Preservation Commission and Historic Districts
Bylaw,” 47 than by the Zoning Bylaw. Brookline likewise
points to this section as proof that the NCD Bylaw's proper
place is amongst the town's general bylaws. 48 However, the
appearance of historic district regulation in the town's general
bylaws does not open the door to unrestrained regulation
of the subject under the town's home rule power, because
Section 5.6 was enacted pursuant to and is governed by G.
L. c. 40C. The NCD Bylaw's regulation of historic design
mimics that statute, and must likewise follow its necessary
procedures. Brookline, contending that it did not have to
follow the procedural requirements for adoption of a historic
district bylaw as provided by G. L. c. 40C, §§ 3 and 4, does
not argue that it has complied with those requirements.
*12 G. L. c. 40C pursues the “preservation and protection
of the distinctive characteristics of buildings and places
significant in the history of the commonwealth and its cities
and towns or their architecture....” G. L. c. 40C, § 2. Similar
to G. L. c. 40A's mandate allowing towns to establish zoning
districts only pursuant to specified procedures, G. L. c.
40C states that “[a] city or town may, by ordinance or bylaw adopted by two-thirds vote ... establish historic districts
subject to” a number of procedural requirements that must be
followed “[p]rior to the establishment of any historic district.”
G. L. c. 40C, § 3. (emphasis added) It is true that “[Chapter
40C] gives municipalities unfettered discretion whether to
establish a historic district and, if so, what lands, buildings,
and structures to include in that district.”
Springfield
Preservation Trust, Inc. v. Springfield Library & Museums
Ass'n, 447 Mass. 408, 419, 852 N.E.2d 83 (2006). However,
if a municipality does choose to establish a historic district, it
must follow the statutory procedures for doing so. 49

subjects permissibly supplements the Zoning Bylaw because
it is tailored to specific neighborhoods, this argument employs
“supplement” as a euphemism for “supplant.” They expressly
regulate the same subject matter, and the NCD Bylaw serves
to effectively replace the Zoning Bylaw's requirements. As

4.36.c

The practical framework of G. L. c. 40C provides that no
building permit shall issue in a historic district “for alteration
of an exterior architectural feature” without a certificate of
appropriateness, certificate of non-applicability, or certificate
of hardship. G. L. c. 40C, § 6. In determining whether an
alteration is historically appropriate,

the commission shall consider, among
other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance
of the site, building or structure, the
general design, arrangement, texture,
material and color of the features
involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of buildings
and structures in the surrounding
area. In the case of new construction
or additions to existing buildings
or structures the commission shall
consider the appropriateness of the
size and shape of the building or
structure both in relation to the land
area upon which the building or
structure is situated and to buildings
and structures in the vicinity, and
the commission may in appropriate
cases impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to those
required by applicable ordinance or
by-law.

G. L. c. 40C, § 7.
The regulation of architectural design for the purposes of
historic preservation under this framework, and under the
comparable framework provided in Brookline's Preservation
Commission and Historic Districts Bylaw, is no different from
the regulation of design provided by the NCD Bylaw. Section
5.10.3.d.1 begins by articulating the history of the Hancock
Village neighborhood, and describes the particulars of its
historic architectural design. In addition to the dimensional
requirements described above, the NCD Bylaw's substantive
design guidelines govern the same exterior design features
covered by G. L. c. 40C, § 7; and, like the statute, the NCD
Bylaw requires evaluation of those features for compatibility
with the surrounding neighborhood's historical character. It

4.36.c

provides for this evaluation with the aim of “preserving
and protecting groups of buildings and their settings that
are architecturally or historically significant,” which again
directly mirrors the purpose set forth in G. L. c. 40C, § 2. It
even calls for the same manner of approval – a “Certificate
of Appropriateness” – as appears in the statute. Although
Brookline contends that the NCD Bylaw differs in that it
“allows Brookline to address issues beyond the scope of
M.G.L. c. 40C,” the additional issues it lists – “landscape and
urban issues such as protection of landscapes, open spaces,
viewsheds” 50 – are simply the very same issues which
themselves improperly fall within the purview of the Zoning
Bylaw and G. L. c. 40A, as described above. A bylaw cannot
escape categorization under either statute by packaging the
content of one along with the other.
*13 The unavoidable conclusion is that, with regard to
exterior design elements, the NCD Bylaw establishes a
historic district of the type specifically envisioned by G.
L. c. 40C. Accordingly, by purporting to enact the NCD
Bylaw pursuant to Brookline's general home rule power,
but without following the procedural requirements G. L. c.
40C, Brookline has frustrated that statute's purpose. See
Board of Appeals of Hanover v. Housing Appeals Comm.,
supra, 363 Mass. at 360, 294 N.E.2d 393. Brookline contends
that G. L. c. 40C does not occupy the field of historic
preservation, and that the NCD Bylaw may therefore regulate
historic preservation without conforming to the requirements
of the statute. As support for this contention, Brookline cites
no applicable authority other than the Attorney General's
memorandum, which itself concluded without citation to any
precedent that G. L. c. 40C “neither explicitly or implicitly
preempts other types of by-laws aimed at architectural
or historic preservation.” 51 There is no apparent reason,
however, why the interaction between a municipality's
general home rule power and the statutory scheme provided
in G. L. c. 40C should differ in any way from the interaction
between that power and the statutory scheme of G. L. c.
40A. The principles articulated in Rayco and Spenlinhauer
apply just as much in the context of the former as they do
in the latter. It might be so that the entire field of historic
preservation, speaking broadly, is not preempted by G. L. c.
40C; however, it is not so difficult to determine that a town
bylaw which singles out a district for historic preservation,
utilizes a mechanism identical to that of G. L. c. 40C, does so
for the same professed purpose, and does so in a town that has
already accepted G. L. c. 40C, has trespassed on the purview
of the statute. Were it otherwise, the statute's provision of

Accordingly, even if the NCD Bylaw's regulation of historic
architectural design does not fall under the umbrella of G.
L. 40A and the Zoning Bylaw, it is functionally identical to
the historic districts governed by G. L. c. 40C, and would
therefore in any event be required to follow that statute's
procedural requirements for enactment.
III. THE ENACTMENT OF THE NCD BYLAW FAILED TO
COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE
REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER 40A AND CHAPTER 40C
Because the NCD Bylaw's dimensional regulations are, in
purpose and effect, an amendment to the Brookline Zoning
Bylaw, the bylaw can only be valid if enacted pursuant to the
procedures of G. L. c. 40A. It was not. Brookline argues that
the process “substantially complied” 52 with the provisions
of G. L. c. 40A, and that this is sufficient to sustain the bylaw.
It is not. In Canton v. Bruno, 361 Mass. 598, 603, 282 N.E.2d
87 (1972), the Supreme Judicial Court expressly rejected
this same argument, then advanced by the town of Canton,
that “substantial compliance” was sufficient to satisfy the
procedural requirements of the predecessor statute to G. L.
c. 40A, § 5. Interpreting the same language that now appears
in the current text of
§ 5, it held that “the Legislature
mandated a rule of strict compliance by the plain language
‘[Zoning] ordinances or by-laws may be adopted ... but only
in the manner ... provided’ ....” Canton v. Bruno, supra, 361
Mass. at 598, 282 N.E.2d 87. See Penn v. Town of Barnstable,
26 LCR 215, 217 (2018)Penn v. Town of Barnstable, 26
LCR 215, 217 (2018) (Vhay, J.). Cf. McIntyre v. Selectmen
of Ashby, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 735, 739, 584 N.E.2d 1137
(1992) (noting that G. L. c. 40, § 21(17), which authorizes
earth-removal ordinances, was enacted “to avoid the involved
and strict procedural requirements for adopting or amending
zoning ordinances and by-laws ....”).
Brookline asserts that the numerous town and board meetings
held concerning the NCD Bylaw were more than sufficient
to provide notice and procedural protection equivalent to that
available under Chapter 40A. Strict compliance, however,
brooks no equivalence. It is not in dispute that Brookline
failed to strictly comply 53 with the provisions of
G. L. c.
40A, § 5; accordingly, Section 5.10 of the Brookline General
Bylaws, as enacted by the passage of Warrant Articles 5

and 6, cannot stand. Similarly, the NCD Bylaw failed to
comply with G. L. c. 40C's procedural requirements for
enactment. These failures include, among others, the failure
to give written notice of the public hearing on the required
report of a study committee at least fourteen days prior
to the date of the required hearing. G. L. c. 40C, § 3,
¶ 1. Brookline's contention, repeated once more, that it
“substantially complied” with the requirements of G. L. c.
40C is just as unavailing the second time as the first. Thus,
even if Section 5.10's regulation of historic exterior design
in Hancock Village were severable from its dimensional
regulations, the bylaw still could not survive.
*14 Of course, even had the town complied with the
procedural requirements for the adoption of a zoning bylaw
in G. L. c. 40A, § 5, the bylaw as passed is invalid because
it fails to include or incorporate (as was the town's apparent
intention) the many substantive protections and mechanisms
of G. L. c. 40A. The NCD Bylaw, purporting to be a general
bylaw, provides no protection for prior nonconforming uses
or lots as required by
G. L. c. 40A, § 6; it does not
recognize the zoning freeze provisions of the same section; it
does not provide for zoning relief to be granted in the form
of special permits or variances, but instead substitutes types
of approvals and relief not sanctioned by G. L. c. 40A; it
institutes as the local board granting approvals a commission
composed in a manner not recognized or sanctioned by G.
L. c. 40A; it does not provide for the notice or hearing
requirements required by G. L. c. 40A, §§ 11 and
15; and
perhaps most egregiously, by providing no specific avenue of
appeal, it provides for what is only a limited record review by
an action in the nature of certiorari instead of the more robust
de novo review required by

G. L. c. 40A, § 17.

IV. THE NCD BYLW VIOLATES THE UNIFORMITY
PROVISIONS OF G. L. c. 40A, § 4
Aside from its invalidity for failure to utilize the procedural
requirements for adoption of a zoning bylaw, and its failure
to include the substantive protections, noted above, required
to be included in every zoning bylaw, the NCD Bylaw is also
invalid because it violates the uniformity principles that are
fundamental to the validity of any zoning laws, and which
are required by G. L. c. 40A, § 4. Pursuant to that section,
“[a]ny zoning ordinance or by-law which divides cities and
towns into districts shall be uniform within the district for
each class or kind of structures or uses permitted.” G. L. c.
40A, § 4. A bylaw fails to provide uniformity where it is so

requirements on an ad hoc basis. See SCIT, Inc. v. Planning
Bd. of Braintree, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 108, 472 N.E.2d
269 (1984);
Fafard v. Conservation Comm'n of Reading,
41 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 572, 672 N.E.2d 21 (1996). Such an
improper delegation of legislative power results in a scheme
in which criteria are “devised for the occasion, rather than of
uniform applicability.”

Id. at 572, 672 N.E.2d 21.

The seminal example of a violation of uniformity is provided
by
SCIT v. Planning Board of Braintree, where a
town's zoning bylaw rendered every use in a particular
district subject to a special permit, with the only rubric
for consideration being the bylaw's general purpose clause.
See
SCIT, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Braintree, supra, 19
Mass. App. Ct. at 103-108, 472 N.E.2d 269. The Appeals
Court found this to be invalid, holding that § 4 “does not
contemplate ... conferral on local zoning boards of a roving
and virtually unlimited power to discriminate” between
different applications.
Id. at 108, 472 N.E.2d 269. The
bylaw violated the uniformity requirement of § 4 because “
‘[i]t attempted to delegate to the board ... a new power to alter
the characteristics of zoning districts, a power conferred ...
only upon the legislative body of the city to be exercised
only in the manner prescribed by [G. L. c. 40A] ... and
it attempted to do this without furnishing any principles
or rules by which the board should be guided, leaving the
board unlimited authority to indulge in ‘spot zoning’ at its
discretion or whim.’ ”
Id., quoting
Smith v. Board
of Appeals of Fall River, 319 Mass. 341, 344, 65 N.E.2d
547 (1946). Cf. Salvadore v. Town of Westborough, Case
No. 97-0547, 2002 WL 1554586, at *4, 2002 Mass. Super.
LEXIS 199, at *3 (May 22, 2002) (bylaw which provided
for adoption of dimensional requirements on a case-by-case
basis for municipal structures was valid; though “structures in
other zones, such as single-family residences, commercial or
industrial structures” are amenable to uniform requirements,
municipal uses – such as water towers and fire stations – are
not).
The requirement for uniformity is not limited to zoning
bylaws subject to G. L. 40A, § 4, but extends to other
exercises of the police power as well. “In the administration
of controls limiting the use of land – as with any exercise of
the police power – uniformity of standards and enforcement

are of the essence.”
Fieldstone Meadows Dev. Corp.
v. Conservation Comm'n of Andover, 62 Mass. App. Ct.
265, 267, 816 N.E.2d 141 (2004), quoting
Fafard v.
Conservation Comm'n of Reading, supra, 41 Mass. App.
Ct. at 569, 672 N.E.2d 21. For example, in
Fieldstone
Meadows, supra, 62 Mass. App. Ct. at 267 n.5, 816
N.E.2d 141, a conservation commission administering a local
wetlands bylaw employed a policy prohibiting construction
within twenty-five feet of bordering vegetated wetlands. This
requirement was, however, not specifically laid out within the
actual regulatory framework; moreover, it “provide[d] that
‘special justification’ could be advanced for proposals for
building within the twenty-five foot zone.” The court held that
this policy did not provide uniformity of application, and was
a legally insufficient basis for the commission's denial.
at 270, 816 N.E.2d 141.

Id.,

*15 Nonetheless, discretion in applying dimensional
requirements is not per se delegation of authority resulting
in a violation of the uniformity principle; it is only when
a board's discretion is truly unrestrained that uniformity is
threatened. In
Emond v. Board of Appeals of Uxbridge,
supra, 27 Mass. App. Ct. at 632, 541 N.E.2d 380, a provision
of the bylaw permitted the board to grant special permits
for lots with less frontage or area than required by the
bylaw's dimensional requirement, as long as the lots were
“in neighborhoods where there is a general pattern of house
lots that deviate similarly ....” The court found no violation
of § 4: “The by-law does not give the board unlimited
discretion.... Adjustments to conform zoning standards to
the circumstances of particular fact situations need not, we
think, be made exclusively by establishing zoning districts
on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. Authorizing
adjustments by special permit, subject to clear and uniform
standards, does not violate the uniformity requirement of G.
L. c. 40A, § 4.”
Id. See also
MacGibbon v. Board of
Appeals of Duxbury, supra, 356 Mass. at 638, 255 N.E.2d
347 (“The by-law confers a measure of discretionary power to
the board, but it does not confer unrestrained power to grant
or withhold special permits by the arbitrary exercise of that
discretion.”).
Here, the NCD Bylaw goes too far in delegating what is,
in effect, an unrestrained power to legislate ad hoc zoning
requirements. In particular, Section 5.10.3.c missteps in
affording the Commission the general power to conjure up
whatever dimensional requirements it sees fit on a case-by-

case basis. Section 5.10.3.c states, “The Commission may
impose dimensional requirements that further the purposes
of the by-law, including without limitation preventing
Reviewable Projects inconsistent with the historic or
architectural aspects, scale or massing, neighborhood or
subdivision plan or layout, circulation patterns, or green
space, open space, landscape, vegetation or viewshed
character of the NCD.” Like the bylaw in
SCIT, this
provides virtually unlimited discretion, guided only by very
general statements of purpose, to create dimensional zoning
requirements from whole cloth, and to do so on a caseby-case basis, resulting in the very antithesis of uniform
application. 54 See SCIT, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Braintree,
supra, 19 Mass. App. Ct. at 108, 472 N.E.2d 269. And,
it provides not just the power to tweak the numerical
element of a set dimensional constraint – such as
Emond's
downward adjustment of the frontage requirement – but
also the power to create whatever new categories and
types of dimensional constraints the Commission might
imagine. Unlike
Emond, the ability of the Commission
to discretionarily create and impose its own dimensional
requirements deprives the bylaw of the “clear and uniform
standards” which must necessarily be articulated in the bylaw
itself.
Emond v. Board of Appeals of Uxbridge, supra, 27
Mass. App. Ct. at 632, 541 N.E.2d 380. The NCD Bylaw
suffers from this deficiency whether it is classified as a zoning
bylaw (as concluded above) or a general bylaw (as contended
by Brookline).
V. THE NCD BYLAW CONSTITUTES IMPERMISSIBLE
SPOT ZONING
*16 A variant of violation of the principle of uniformity
required by G. L. c. 40A, § 4 is spot zoning. “Spot zoning
involves the singling out for disparate treatment of one parcel
of land from similar parcels in the same zoning district.”

“ ‘Spot zoning’—singling out a parcel of land for special

Canteen Corp. v. City of Pittsfield,

a single parcel is re-zoned at the behest of citizens objecting
to a particular proposed use of the parcel, such re-zoning
violates the uniformity principle and is invalid spot zoning.

A zoning amendment “will be sustained unless there exists

reasonableness of a zoning regulation is fairly debatable,
the judgment of the local legislative body (here the zoning

court should not substitute its own judgment. Nevertheless,
a zoning ordinance or by-law will be held invalid if it
is unreasonable or arbitrary, or substantially unrelated to
the public health, safety, convenience, morals or welfare.”

The re-zoning of a single lot of land “at the instigation of
citizens who objected to a particular proposed business use,”
setting it apart from other similar adjacent uses, “constitute[s]
arbitrary and unreasonable action.”
Schertzer v. City of
Somerville, supra, 345 Mass. at 752, 189 N.E.2d 555. This
is so even if the target site of the re-zoning is large enough
that it would not ordinarily be unreasonable for it to be treated
as a subject of re-zoning. In National Amusements, Inc. v.
City of BostonNational Amusements, Inc. v. City of Boston,
the Appeals Court upheld a judgment of the Land Court
invalidating the re-zoning of a 13.8-acre parcel from business
use to residential, holding that zoning changes, “which have
no better purpose than to torpedo a specific development on
a specific parcel are considered arbitrary and unreasonable.”
National Amusements, Inc. v. City of Boston, supra, 29 Mass.
at 312, 560 N.E.2d 138.
There is no doubt that Brookline's purpose in adopting the
NCD Bylaw and the Hancock Village NCD Bylaw was
the same purpose deemed invalid in Scherzer and National

appeals. 56
The proposal to adopt the NCD Bylaw and the Hancock
Village NCD Bylaw followed directly, with, as noted
above, an explicit written acknowledgment by the Brookline
Advisory Committee Subcommittee on Planning and
Regulation that “[t]he impetus for [Article 6 of the Town
Warrant adopting the Hancock Village NCD Bylaw] comes
from the proposals by [the owner of Hancock Village] to
add as many as 466 new housing units to Hancock Village
... [the owner's] most recent proposal (August 2011) is a
major impact project that includes 31 detached single-family
houses and 162 units in a multi-family building. The Planning
Board, Building Commissioner, Preservation Commission,
Department of Public Works (Traffic and Engineering),
and Housing Advisory Board all have begun to review
the proposal.” 57 The Board of Selectmen also made it
abundantly clear that the town's intention in adopting Article
6 was to force Hancock Village to remain the quaint gardenstyle apartment complex it has been since first built in 1949. In
the Board of Selectmen's “Supplemental Recommendation”
to the Town Meeting on the subject of Article 6, the Selectmen
wrote:
*17 Hancock Village was designed and constructed in
accordance with commitments made by the developer
John Hancock Insurance Company, including not only a
commitment that there would be a buffer strip along the
side of the land facing Russett and Beverly Roads, but also
an agreement that the area would be a “garden village type
of housing” development, with horizontally divided (as
opposed to vertically divided town-house type units) not
exceeding 25% of the units, with flat roofs not exceeding
25% of the buildings, with building coverage not exceeding
20% of the area, and with no building over 2 stories in
height.
...
The design guidelines in Article 6 are intended to ensure
that the development and alterations within the Hancock
Village area are compatible with the existing neighborhood
and abutting properties ... to provide “an additional layer of
protection for existing residents of Hancock Village and
its immediate surroundings.” 58

These explicit acknowledgments of the purpose of the
proposed warrant articles, coming from the committee
charged with reviewing the proposed warrant articles
prior to their consideration by the town meeting and
from the board of selectmen, in combination with the
surrounding undisputed circumstances of the adoption of
Warrant Articles 5 and 6, including their timing in light
of Hancock Village's submission of its development
proposal, 59 compel the inference that in adopting the two
NCD bylaws, “the town was concerned only with blocking
the plaintiff['s] development.”
Pheasant Ridge Associates
Ltd. Partnership v. Town of Burlington, 399 Mass. 771, 779,
506 N.E.2d 1152 (1987). Where the undisputed record allows
the court to draw such an inference, the town's action, even
adopted by town meeting, may be invalidated. Id. (facially
valid eminent domain taking for park purposes invalidated
where undisputed record allowed inference that true purpose
was to block proposed G. L. c. 40B development).
The NCD Bylaw and the Hancock Village NCD Bylaw,
although facially not adopted as zoning amendments, were,
for the reasons stated above, bound to comply with the
principles governing the adoption of zoning amendments, and
also for the reasons stated above, violated the requirements
for uniformity that prohibit spot zoning.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment is ALLOWED, and the defendant's Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED. The court need not address
the plaintiff's arguments as to the unconstitutional vagueness
of the NCD Bylaw, as it invalid for the independent grounds
articulated above. Because it failed to adhere to the procedural
and substantive requirements of G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c.
40C, and fails to provide for uniformity of application, the
enactment of Warrant Articles 5 and 6 was beyond the scope
of the town's power and authority, and Section 5.10 of the
Brookline General Bylaws, in its entirety, is accordingly
invalid and of no force and effect. 60 Judgment will enter in
accordance with this decision.

to be adopted as zoning by-laws. Portions of the amendments reflect the ‘nature and effect’ of a zoning bylaw, but other portions do not. Therefore, based upon the Attorney General's limited scope of review and
the presumption of validity of municipal by-laws, we must approve them, as we have in the case of two
other towns' general (not zoning) by-laws creating NCDs. However, we have concerns regarding various
provisions of the amendments, as detailed below .... In sum, our review of the amendments adopted under
Article 5 reveals that they carry many of the features of a zoning by-law, and an argument could be made that
the Town has frustrated the purpose of the Zoning Act by not adopting them as such. However, based on
the Attorney General's limited standard of review, and because there is no Massachusetts case establishing
that such by-laws must be adopted as zoning by-laws, we are constrained to approve them.” Joint Appendix

Complaint ¶ 24 (NCD Bylaw will prevent development of 28 lots assessed as single-family lots in singlefamily zoning district because of imposition of “greenbelt” setback buffer by NCD Bylaw); Complaint ¶ 27
(NCD Bylaw would impact ability to build proposed community center otherwise allowed by local zoning).
Joint Appendix, p. 1179.
“The impetus for [the warrant article imposing a Neighborhood Conservation District on Hancock Village]
comes from proposals by [the owner of Hancock Village] to add as many as 446 new housing units
to Hancock Village/// “Report on Article 6: Hancock Village Neighborhood Conservation District.” Joint
Appendix pp. 1296-1297.
In the face of Brookline's repeated references to comparable bylaws in other municipalities, the court is
compelled to note that its decision in the present case invalidates a section of Brookline's bylaw, and
Brookline's alone; the court passes no judgment on the validity of any other municipality's bylaw, no matter
how similar. Those other bylaws are not before the court. The validity of each depends on an analysis of its
particulars, and the court is neither inclined nor empowered to undertake such an analysis within the context
of the present dispute.
Section 5.10.1, NCD Bylaw. Joint Appendix p. 875. Although not discussed by the parties, it appears that by
purporting to give NCD Commissions the power to regulate “subdivision plans and layouts” the NCD Bylaw
also impermissibly invades the exclusive province of the Brookline Planning Board under the Subdivision
Control Law, G. L. c. 41, §§ 81K, et seq. This is another basis of the invalidity of the NCD Bylaw.
The NCD Bylaw gives the Commission the unfettered discretion to “impose dimensional regulations that
further the purposes of this by-law...” Section 5.10.3.c, NCD Bylaw. Joint Appendix p. 879.
It must be recognized that such regulation of dimensional characteristics is not always a function purely
of zoning; though zoning must be the default classification of such ordinances, comparable regulation may
appear in a non-zoning context when specifically provided by statute.
G. L. c. 40C, § 7, for example,
does specifically allow a historic commission to “in appropriate cases impose dimensional and set-back
requirements in addition to those required by applicable ordinance or by-law.” However, as discussed further
below, the NCD Bylaw was not passed pursuant to G. L. c. 40C or any other particular statute specifically
authorizing this manner of regulation.
Joint Appendix p. 694.
Joint Appendix p. 879.
As the plaintiff correctly points out, the provision prohibiting the “[a]ddition of new impervious surfaces within
100 feet of abutting properties,” though unusual in its wording, operates identically to a traditional setback
requirement.
Sections 5.10.3.d.1.ii.a; 5.10.3.d.1.v.d and e. Joint Appendix pp. 881-882.
Joint Appendix pp. 891, 899.
Joint Appendix p. 789, “Specific Standards for Beacon Street and Coolidge Corner General Business District.”
Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, p. 55.
Joint Appendix pp. 851-859.
Brookline points to a number of other general town bylaws for the same proposition, but none contain any
comparable regulation of architectural design, and need not be addressed in depth. The other general bylaws
cited as ostensibly similar to the NCD Bylaw's design regulation include Section 8.26, which regulates storm
drains for the purpose of “eliminat[ing] non-stormwater discharges”; Section 8.27, which governs wetlands
protection; Section 5.1, regulating the connection of an alarm to a police station; Section 5.2, regulating
condominium health and safety; Section 5.4, which governs refuse pick-up; Section 5.8, which regulates
signs; and Section 5.9, which adopts the provisions of 780 CMR 120.AA for the construction of energyefficient buildings.
That is, provided that the municipality has accepted the provisions of the chapter and it has thereby become
effective in the municipality. See Allen v. Old King's Highway Reg'l Historic Dist., 2000 Mass. App. Div. 330,
332 (2000). It is clear that Brookline has done so, as it has a historic preservation bylaw passed expressly
under G. L. c. 40C.

Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Response, p. 22.
Joint Appendix p. 385.
Brookline's Memorandum in Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 14.
There appears to be some dispute as to whether the plaintiff complied with a number of
§ 5 requirements.
For example, the plaintiff contends that the Planning Board held a meeting concerning the NCD Bylaw, but
it did not hold a “public hearing” as required by
§ 5, and did not provide proper notice that the meeting's
subject matter would be the consideration of a zoning ordinance; Brookline, on the other hand, contends that
two public hearings were indeed held. A Planning Board memorandum states that “The Planning Board held
two meetings on Articles 5 & 6, one of public testimony ... and one for board discussion.” Joint Appendix p. 203.
There is also no indication in the record of precisely when Articles 5 and 6 were first submitted to the Board
of Selectmen, for the purpose of evaluating compliance with the requirement that a Planning Board hearing
be held within 65 days of the Articles' submission. Regardless, it has never been in dispute that Articles 5
and 6 were not specifically noticed as an amendment to the Zoning Bylaw; a failure to specifically identify a
bylaw as Chapter 40A zoning (let alone what appears to be Brookline's concerted effort to emphasize that
the NCD Bylaw was not zoning, but instead an alternative to zoning) is necessarily a “misleading” defect for

the purposes of
G. L. c. 40A, § 5 ¶ 2. Moreover, as discussed below, the bylaw likewise fails to comply
with G. L. c. 40A's substantive requirements.
Brookline asserted at oral argument that Section 5.10.3.d.1's provision of particular dimensional
requirements for Hancock Village meant that the Commission could not craft its own additional dimensional
requirements through Section 5.10.3.c, and would be limited to those contained in Section 5.10.3.d. This
reading does not comport with the plain meaning apparent in the text. Section 5.10.3.c generally empowers
the Commission to “impose dimensional requirements that further the purposes of the by-law” and provides
examples of the types of requirements it may impose. Section 5.10.3.d.1, applicable to Hancock Village
in particular, states that structures “shall be compatible with the existing buildings in the district,” and shall
not have a “significant negative impact on historical architectural or landscape elements.” Although it then
provides a number of specific requirements within each of these categories, it states that the categories “shall
include, but not be limited to” those specifically-provided requirements. Both 5.10.3.c and Section 5.10.3.d.1
provide the Commission with the discretion to impose its own requirements which do not specifically appear
in Section 5.10.3.d.1.
Joint Appendix pp. 1169-1170.
Joint Appendix pp. 127-129.
Joint Appendix p. 1297.
Joint Appendix, pp. 632-633.
At a public hearing on the proposed warrant articles on September 20, 2011, a member of the Board of
Selectmen expressed concern that the NCD might not be passed in time to stop the approval of Hancock
Village's major project impact review application: “Is any understanding or concern about when this – the –
NCD would have to be passed in relation to the building application – the building permit application or the
approval of that application? Is there – is there a point at which the fact that we've – declared a NCD is too
late in the process?” Joint Appendix p. 136.
It must be noted that the Hancock Village NCD is not the only NCD to exist as a subsection within the
overall framework of Section 5.10: enacted as Section 5.10.3.d.2. is the “Greater Toxteth Neighborhood
Conservation District.” While the validity of this other NCD was not directly at issue in this case, the necessarily
wholesale invalidation of the enabling sections of Section 5.10 for the reasons enumerated above logically
precludes the independent survival of that other NCD.

Introduction
For over 10,000 years, human activity has shaped the landscape of this Commonwealth. Today,
this landscape has stories to tell everywhere we look. Whether they are archaeological sites
associated with Native American inhabitants, wood framed structures from early European
settlement or factory villages adjacent to water powered sites, the landscapes of Massachusetts
offer variety and interest that enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors alike. Today,
the Massachusetts landscape is multi-layered as human activity on the landscape has shifted and
shifted again.
The buildings, bridges, parks,
burial grounds, agricultural
landscapes, mill housing,
industrial complexes,
archaeological sites and the
many other historic and cultural
resources found in the cities and
towns of Massachusetts are
significant to our understanding
of our past. They establish our
sense of connection to our
communities and they are the
very reason people choose to
live, work, and visit here.
As irreplaceable significant
historic and cultural resources
have been threatened or
destroyed, advocates for their preservation have organized, voiced their concern, and worked
tirelessly to protect them. Today, a network of local commissions, local and state non-profit
organizations and state government agencies work to assure that historic resources remain an
integral part of our cities and towns while still allowing growth, change, and new patterns of
development.
The Paul Revere House located in the North End, Boston

This State Historic Preservation Plan for 2011-2015 offers the chance for all of us to recognize
our past accomplishments, view the challenges ahead, and see how we can all work together
towards a Commonwealth that continues to reflect the stories of everyone in the historic
landscape around us.
The Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Plan 2011–2015
As the State Historic Preservation Office, the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) is
responsible for taking the lead in preparing the five-year state historic preservation plan. The
MHC is responsible for ensuring that its programs and activities further the broad goals,
objectives, and priorities outlined in this plan. While the Massachusetts Historical Commission
is the primary user of the plan, it is meant to be a plan that will be useful for all preservation

partners at the local, state, and national levels. The preservation community in Massachusetts
includes well over 500 organizations as well as many more organizations directly involved with
historic resources or with the management of historic resources. At over 450, local historic
district commissions and historical commissions make up the majority of the preservation
organizations statewide. In reviewing this plan, local historical commissions and historic
district commissions will note their own goals, challenges, and accomplishments. Likewise, so
will the many other organizations highlighted in this plan. Unlike previous state historic
preservation plans, the goals section of this plan includes the organization responsible for
carrying out each objective.
This plan reflects the input, discussion, and hard work of many individuals representing many
different agencies and groups. Its goal is to provide all of the preservation partners, including
municipal governments, state agencies, regional and statewide organizations and the
Massachusetts Historical Commission with a clear direction on how best to protect the
irreplaceable historic and cultural resources of Massachusetts.
For the Massachusetts Historical Commission this plan has particular importance. Each year, the
Massachusetts Historical Commission develops an Annual Work Program, based on the State
Plan, that describes the implementation priorities and the specific tasks necessary to accomplish
the goals of the State Plan within existing legislative, funding, and staffing opportunities and
constraints.
Creating the 2011-2015 Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Plan
The development of the 2011-2015 State Historic Preservation Plan began in late 2009 with a
review of the content of the previous 2006-2010 State Historic Preservation Plan for
accomplishments, outstanding goals, and remaining challenges. Following a review of current
state historic preservation plans from other states, a general outline for a new state historic
preservation plan began taking shape.
During December 2009 and January 2010, a list of Advising Organizations was developed. This
list included over 80 organizations representing historic preservation
partners at the local, regional, and state level as well as state agencies
and non-profit organizations involved with historic resources.
During early 2010, MHC staff compiled a revised Municipal Status
Database that compiled information on preservation activities for the
351 cities and towns in Massachusetts during the previous five-year
planning cycle. Information included the general level of preservation
activity, historic property surveys undertaken, new National Register
listings, and local bylaws or ordinances that were established.
At the end of January 2010, MHC contacted all of the Advising
Organizations to introduce them to the state historic preservation
planning process, to ask them if they thought other organizations should be on the Advising
Organizations list and to seek their input regarding recent major accomplishments. Local

commission members were involved in this process through the MHC Local Preservation Update
e-newsletter.
MHC followed up with requests for additional comments during the Spring of 2010 through the
Masshistpres listserve and e-newsletter. For the Advising Organizations that had not responded
at that time, MHC followed up directly either in person, by phone, or by email.
Public meetings began in Spring 2010 with a western Massachusetts meeting in Holyoke at
Wistariahurst Museum, hosted by the Holyoke Historical Commission. An additional eastern
Massachusetts public meeting was held in Duxbury in June. At each of the meetings, MHC staff
discussed MHC and its programs, previous state preservation planning efforts, and the outline for
the current preservation plan. A discussion, facilitated by MHC staff, followed that considered
accomplishments, challenges, and goals for the coming five years.
By the Fall of 2010, a draft document was ready for distribution to the Advising Organizations.
During October and November 2010, comments from the Advising Organization members, local
commission members, and the general public were received, reviewed, and incorporated where
appropriate.
The result of this planning process is the Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Plan 20112015.
For the Massachusetts Historical Commission, accomplishments for this plan cover the following
federal fiscal years:
Fiscal Year 2006 – October 1, 2005 to September 30 2006
Fiscal Year 2007 – October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007
Fiscal Year 2008 – October 1, 2007 to September 30, 2008
Fiscal Year 2009 – October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009
Fiscal Year 2010 – October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010

A Statewide Overview of Historic Preservation in Massachusetts
Historic preservation in Massachusetts today includes a broad range of organizations at the state,
regional, and local level consisting of all branches of government, advocacy, and educational
organizations as well as the many citizens that deeply value the historic and cultural resources
present in this state. This section of the state historic preservation plan describes these
organizations and their critical role in historic preservation efforts. The table of over eighty
Advising Organizations demonstrates the breadth of organizations involved with historic
preservation in Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts Historical Commission
The Massachusetts Historical Commission was established in 1963 by the State Legislature to
identify, evaluate, and protect the important historical and archaeological assets of the
Commonwealth. Preservation programs at the Massachusetts Historical Commission include the
Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth, the National Register of
Historic Places, Local Government Programs, Survey and Planning Grants, Massachusetts
Preservation Projects Fund Grants, reviews of state and federally funded or licensed projects,
federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits, annual preservation awards, and archaeology
month. The Massachusetts Historical Commission is also the office of the State Historic
Preservation Office and the State Archaeologist. The Commission, which is also the State
Review Board, consists of eighteen members appointed from various disciplines. Professional
staff includes architectural historians, architects, archaeologists, and preservation planners.
The Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth has been compiled
and maintained by the MHC since MHC’s creation in 1963 and has grown to include records on
an estimated 200,000 properties and sites. The inventory includes buildings, structures, sites,
objects, areas, parks, landscapes, and burial grounds. Inventory
information is recorded on MHC inventory forms, following
standards and guidelines set forth in the MHC’s Historic Properties
Survey Manual.
The National Register of Historic Places is a program of the
National Park Service administered in Massachusetts by the
Massachusetts Historical Commission. Properties listed in the
National Register include districts, sites, structures, buildings, and
objects that are significant in American history, architecture,
archaeology, engineering, and culture. The National Register of
Historic Places is the official list of the nation’s cultural resources
worthy of preservation.

Through Local Government Programs, the Massachusetts
Historical Commission provides assistance and advice to local
commissions through publications, compiled resource material, regional workshops, listserve
monitoring, DVDs, and answering daily inquiries.

The annual MHC Survey and Planning Grant program is utilized primarily by local commissions
for historic property survey, national register nominations, design guidelines, and educational
outreach materials. Depending on funding availability, these grants are sometimes limited to
Certified Local Governments.
Administered by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, the Massachusetts Preservation
Projects Fund supports the preservation of historic properties, landscapes and listed, or in certain
circumstances, eligible for listing in the State Register of Historic Places. Properties must be in
municipal or non-profit ownership and can include pre-development and development projects
consisting of stabilization, protection, rehabilitation and restoration.
The MHC is authorized by state and federal law to review and comment on certain state and
federally licensed, permitted, or funded projects to determine whether the proposed project will
have an impact on historic or archaeological properties. Through review and compliance, if it is
determined that the project poses a threat to a historic property within the project area, then
project proponents and the MHC jointly explore alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any
damaging effects.
The Federal and State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits are also administered through the
Massachusetts Historical Commission. These tax credits are available to certified rehabilitation
projects on income-producing properties.
The State Archaeologist, whose permits ensure that important archaeological resources are
properly conserved, oversees archaeological excavations on public lands or on lands in which the
Commonwealth has an interest. The State Archaeologist also reviews development projects that
affect archaeological properties and negotiates solutions to protect the sites.
Preservation Massachusetts, Incorporated
Preservation Massachusetts, Incorporated is the statewide non-profit advocacy organization for
historic preservation. Preservation Massachusetts (PM) advocates for historic resources at the
local level through such initiatives as the Endangered Historic
Resources List and the Circuit Rider program. At the state
level, PM advocates for policies, funding and tax incentives
that help to preserve historic and cultural resources.
Municipal Governments
Local Historical Commissions and Historic District
Commissions, part of municipal government, constitute the
bulk of historic preservation efforts statewide. Together, local
commissions are responsible for updating and expanding their
historic property survey, nominations to the National Register
for eligible properties, educating the public about historic
resources, advocating for significant historic resources and
establishing and/or administering local bylaws and ordinances that protect historic resources.
Local Historic District Study Committees investigate the establishment of local historic districts.

Tribal Historic Preservation Officers
The Tribal Historic Preservation Officers are responsible for historic preservation on tribal
property. This may include identifying significant properties, nominating properties to the
National Register and consulting directly with federal agencies in a government-to-government
relationship regarding potential project effects to sites of traditional and religious significance to
the tribes.
Regional Planning Agencies
The regional planning agencies provide planning assistance in their region on economic
development, community development, land use, transportation, mapping, housing, historic
preservation as well as other areas. There are thirteen regional planning agencies in
Massachusetts with two regional planning agencies having professional preservation staff.
Local and Regional Organizations
A wide variety of local and regional organizations
exist in Massachusetts. Many of these
organizations are advocacy organizations for their
locality or region. Others are museum
organizations focusing on a particular locale or
period. There are also five National Heritage
Areas. Together, these organizations offer
expertise and insight on a diverse range of historic
resources.
State Agencies
Besides the Massachusetts Historical Commission, there are many state agencies that play a role
in historic preservation. Many state agencies are owners of historic properties including open
spaces, buildings and archaeological sites. Other state agencies administer funds, develop
polices and regulate projects that could impact historic resources.
Degree Programs
The degree programs include certificate, bachelor and post-graduate education in historic
preservation. Each program provides a unique level of expertise for understanding, informing
and preserving our significant historic resources.
Creating the Advising Organizations List
As the Massachusetts Historical Commission developed this state historic preservation plan,
efforts were made to reach out to the great variety of organizations, governmental bodies and
individuals involved in historic preservation.
The result was the list of over eighty Advising Organizations found on the next page. These
organizations participated in the development of this state plan from its earliest stages through to
the completion of a final version in the Fall of 2010.

Major
Accomplishments
The preparation of this 2011-2015 State Historic Preservation Plan offers a unique opportunity
to acknowledge the many accomplishments of the past five years. The Massachusetts
preservation community has had many great successes. While not a comprehensive list, this
section of the plan takes a look back over the past five years to reflect on these achievements.
1. Identifying and Documenting Historic and Archaeological Resources
Additions to the Statewide Inventory
MHC’s Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth continued to
grow largely as a result of ongoing community efforts to update and expand documentation of
historic properties and sites. Over 5000 inventory forms were added to the statewide historic
properties inventory from 2006 to 2010. Many local historical commissions continued to update
their surveys incrementally at a modest rate through their own documentation efforts or through
contracted consultant services. Through much of the period, funding for surveys through MHC’s
Survey and Planning Grant program was limited to Certified Local Government (CLG)
communities. With the limited availability of this traditional funding source for professional
surveys, Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds became a key source of support for
professional historic properties surveys in municipalities that have adopted the Act. Among
towns who used CPA to fund surveys, at least seven, Carlisle, Dartmouth, Groton, Norwell,
Northborough, Randolph and Salisbury undertook multi-year or multi-phase, comprehensive
communitywide surveys. Statewide, at least a dozen communities undertook substantial,
professionally-completed communitywide or neighborhood survey projects. Among the CLG
communities that received Survey and Planning Grant support, Boston completed a multi-year
survey of Beacon Hill, and initiated a multi-year survey update of the Central Business District,
Lowell surveyed its Acre and Pawtucketville neighborhoods, Plymouth updated the survey of its
local historic district, and Quincy updated the survey of Quincy Center. Interest in documenting
mid-20th century resources grew, and the towns of Lincoln and Brookline undertook thematic
surveys of their mid-20th century resources, the latter with Survey and Planning grant support,
and Boston’s CBD survey included a reevaluation of mid-century buildings as a key component
of the project.
Electronic Submissions and Inventory File Scanning
MHC continued to update its survey program to develop standards for digital photography and
the use of digital mapping resources, and to provide guidance on web-based research methods.
It also developed standards for receiving and processing electronic version submissions to
supplement hard-copy inventory forms. MHC also developed and tested a working prototype
online inventory form mapping tool, as a first phase in the development of a web-based interface
for completing inventory forms.

Packet Pg. 224

The addition of over 10,000 records to the MACRIS database over the period reflected both the
growth in the inventory and the addition of new National Register designations. More
significantly, MHC made major steps toward its long-held goal of making digital images of its
paper inventory files and photographs accessible through the MACRIS interface. MHC staff
developed and tested a work-flow strategy for digital scanning of its inventory files, and
succeeded in obtaining the support of a Preserve America Grant from the National Park Service
to support its digitization efforts. With this work ongoing, MHC developed and launched an
updated MACRIS interface on its web site, allowing users to search, view, save, and print digital
images of inventory forms as they are converted in the ongoing scanning project.
Historic Property Survey Planning
MHC continued its pilot project to assist select communities in western Massachusetts prepare
historic property survey plans. In 2007, a historic property survey plan was completed for the
Town of Heath. While directly useful to the town of Heath, the model has been distributed
widely around the state for use by other communities. Additionally, this pilot project provided
recommendations for the next phase of survey plans, the survey planning website. As an
outgrowth of its western Massachusetts initiative, MHC developed a Reconnaissance Survey
Planning Website to provide local historical commissions with an online interface for entering
and uploading street addresses, digital photographs, historical information and notes. Building
on the survey plan methodology developed by MHC Staff for the towns of Granby and Heath,
the website offers local historical commissions a method of organizing and reviewing basic
property by property survey information. After the website was developed, two interns assisted
with community-wide digital photography in select communities. The website is available to
any community with survey needs interested in planning a survey project.
Mid 20th Century Resources
In the town of Lincoln, Friends of Modern Architecture (FoMA) has funded a project to survey
the town’s significant collection of mid-20th century modernist residences and is working with
the Lincoln Public Library to begin the process of providing archival material to the library.
FoMA has also been in touch with the neighboring towns of Lexington and Concord, and with
Historic New England (which has also initiated information gathering on modernist architecture
throughout the region) to provide or share historical information. Elsewhere, the Cape Cod
Modern House Trust was incorporated in 2007 to promote the documentation and preservation of
significant examples of Modernist architecture on the Outer Cape. In the City of Boston, the
Boston Preservation Alliance and the New England
Chapter of DoCoMoMo have advocated for the reexamination of important local mid-century buildings, and
the Boston Landmarks Commission undertook such a
review as part of the first phase of its survey update of the
city’s Central Business District.
2. Evaluating and Registering Historic and
Archaeological Resources
Listings During the Last Planning Cycle
The number of nominations completed and properties
listed in the NR diminished since the publication of the last Leverett Center National Register
District listed in 2008.
State Plan, but there were nevertheless a number of major
achievements. More than 165 nominations were completed, documenting the significance of

more than 4,700 contributing resources. Ten communities saw their first National Register
listings ever during the 2006-2010 period, and almost all were achieved with local funding.
These included: districts in Brimfield, Boxborough, Heath, Holbrook, Leverett, and Plympton;
individual properties in Rochester, Shutesbury, and Southwick; and a municipal park in West
Bridgewater. Large districts in several communities contributed to the high volume of listed
properties, including town center districts in Brimfield, Dedham, Leicester, Millville, Medway,
Winthrop, secondary areas of development in Marshfield, Middleborough, Sandwich,
Westborough, and Weymouth and sizable expansions of early listings in the centers of Sandwich
and Shelburne Falls. In all, some 56 districts were listed during the period since the last State
Plan. Most were initiated by local historical commissions and were funded with largely local
resources. Community Preservation Act funds aided district nominations in two communities
(Dedham and Marshfield) and individual nominations in several others (including Duxbury,
Groton and Wellesley).
Middlesex Canal
One of the most significant accomplishments was the listing of the Middlesex Canal, a linear
district of some 225 contributing resources in nine municipalities, primarily archaeological sites.
The 2009 designation, the result of collaboration between the MHC, the Middlesex Canal
Commission, and the Middlesex Canal Association, updated and expanded a very early
nomination that had listed only a portion of the canal’s 27-mile-long route; the revised
nomination incorporated recent scholarship on the canal, one of the most significant engineering
achievements of the early Republic.
National Register and Federal Investment Tax Credits
While many National Register nominations were primarily for honor and recognition, incentive
programs prompted a sizable number of listings, another major accomplishment. National
Register listings in support of federal investment historic rehabilitation tax credits comprised a
significant portion of the nominations completed since the last plan—almost fifty professionally
prepared nominations were listed as part of a certified rehabilitation project.
National Register and Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund
Seventeen nominations for properties owned by municipalities or private nonprofits resulted in
applications to the Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund during the period.
Under-Recognized Property Types Listed
During the period since publication of the last plan, interest in listing previously underrecognized property types continued to grow. Three individual properties were added to the
National Register through the Underground Railroad context. Other properties associated with
African Americans in Massachusetts were added to the National Register, including one district,
the Myrtle Baptist Church Historic District in Newton, that is comprised of the remnants of a
largely African American neighborhood that was partially lost in the 1960s with the construction
of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Other properties included: the Samuel Harrison House in
Pittsfield, the home of Rev. Harrison, chaplain for the 54th “Glory” Brigade, former slave and
eloquent spokesman for racial equality; and two churches, the Bethel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Plymouth and the Clinton African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in
Great Barrington. Long overlooked, historic properties associated with Native Americans were
also of considerable interest during the period since the last state plan. The Vanderhoop
Homestead, Aquinnah, and the Sachem Rock Farm, East Bridgewater, both listed in the National
Register in 2006, hold associations with the Wampanoag Tribe, while several pending
nominations are significant for their associations with the Nipmuc Tribe. The MHC has

collaborated with the State Department of Conservation and Recreation on a nomination, still
pending at the time of the publication of the State Plan, for the Wachusett Mountain Historic
District, a state-owned property with numerous areas of significance, including associations with
the Nipmuc Nation. The nomination supports the significance of Wachusett Mountain as a
Traditional Cultural Property. Another pending nomination, for the Hassanamisco Reservation
in Grafton, also documents the significance of a property associated with the Nipmuc tribe.
20th Century Properties
Interest in mid 20th century resources grew considerably during this period. National Register
staff at the MHC participated in an ongoing National Park Service project to develop a context
for modernist residential buildings of the outer Cape Cod. The context will lead to the National
Register designation of a number of architecturally significant modernist properties in the region,
including several located within the Cape Cod National Seashore.
Survey and Planning Grants for National Register Nominations
The MHC’s Survey & Planning grant program funded five communities’ National Register
nominations during the period. The New Bedford CLG significantly revised and updated an
early nomination for the County Street Historic District, originally listed in 1976, to more fully
address the area’s economic, social, and ethnic history, and nominated an important city
property, Hazelwood Park. The town of Bedford’s CLG prepared nominations for two districts
and a town-owned cemetery. More recently, the Oxford Center Historic District (NR listing
pending) adds some 220 contributing resources to the National Register. And in Lexington, a
context for mid-century modern residential buildings, to be accompanied by one National
Register district nomination (NR pending), will lay the groundwork for additional nominations
of eligible properties in a community that grew enormously during the decades following the
Second World War.
Cumulative Listings
At the end of 2010, Massachusetts remained a national leader in the NR program, with more than
3,800 listings since the start of the program in 1966, including close to 1,700 National Register
Historic Districts and approximately 77,000 contributing resources.
3. Protecting Historic & Archaeological Resources through State & Federal Regulations
State and Federal Reviews at the Massachusetts Historical Commission
MHC continued its extensive review of projects under state and federal law. The federal law
most widely employed to help protect historic resources is Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act. Similar to Section 106 for federal projects, state funded, licensed, or permitted
projects or projects undertaken by a state agency are reviewed by the Massachusetts Historical
Commission through State Register review regulations. Under Section 106, MHC reviewed
approximately 2,000 projects each year. Under State Register review, MHC reviewed
approximately 10,000 state projects each year. Through additional programmatic agreements
with other agencies, review commitments for some projects were minimized. Additionally,
MHC has developed historic covenant language for disposition of historically significant state
properties. MHC responded to issues of historic gravestone and permit applications for stone
conservation.
The vast majority of projects reviewed by the MHC do not result in adverse effects to historic
and archaeological properties. For instance, in 2009, the MHC reviewed 2,932 federal projects,
only 56 or 2.3% of which had adverse effects on historic resources. Similarly, in 2009, MHC
reviewed 9,087 state projects, 148 or 1.6% of which had adverse effects. Thus, roughly 98% of

4.36.d

19
Packet Pg. 227

projects MHC reviewed have not impacted significant historic
resources. In cases where there is no feasible alternative to avoid a
significant site, MHC has overseen archaeological data recovery
efforts, which has resulted in the preservation of archaeological data
and proper curation of artifacts and records. Data recovery efforts
also include disseminating information to the public. An excellent
example is the African Meeting House on Beacon Hill with its
report, lectures, exhibit and MHC Archaeology Month poster for
2006.
Preservation Restrictions under MGL Chapter 184
MHC continued to fulfill its statutory review and approval role for
preservation restrictions held by qualified organizations and
governmental bodies under M.G.L. Chapter 184, sections 31-33.
Perpetual preservation restrictions remain an important and effective
African Meeting House, Boston
protective mechanism. The requirement of preservation restrictions
as a condition of local Community Preservation grants, and the
continued interest in the available federal tax deduction for the donation of perpetual
preservation restrictions on qualified properties have meant that the volume of restrictions
coming to MHC for statutory approval has continued to grow significantly. Adding to this
volume has been an increased use of preservation restrictions in planning contexts as a condition
for the issuing of zoning variances, special permits, subdivision approvals or land transfers
related to historic properties. MHC continues to administer preservation restrictions that it holds,
responding to an average four to five requests per month for review and approval of proposed
activities. Among local preservation organizations, the Nantucket Preservation Trust has
developed an active preservation restriction program, to date covering fourteen properties,
including eight with interior protections.
State Building Code
MHC continued providing technical assistance regarding partially preserved and totally
preserved status relative to the Massachusetts Building Code Section 3409. These designations
provide some exemptions from the state building code in order to meet the needs of historic
preservation coupled with public safety.
4. Protecting Archaeological Sites
MHC reviews
In MHC review of projects, MHC has consulted with developers and project proponents to
consider ways to avoid and protect significant sites. There have been many cases of project redesign to avoid impacting sites and to protect the sites from construction-related impacts. In
addition, a number of sites have been placed under a preservation restriction for permanent
protection such as at the Grafton State Hospital. The MHC has advocated for the acquisition of
archaeological sites by towns or non-profit land trusts. Numerous sites and archaeologically
sensitive areas have been purchased for conservation. In consultation with the Commission on
Indian Affairs, Tribes, and Wampanoag Confederation on Repatriation, the Massachusetts
Historical Commission upheld the State Unmarked Burial Law.

State Archaeologist Permits
Approximately 100 state archaeologist permits were issued each year for archaeological
investigations.
Bibliography of Archaeological Survey and Mitigation Reports
MHC updated the bibliography of archaeological survey and mitigation reports. This is available
for distribution on a CD and by paper copy.
Archaeology Month
In cooperation with many local
organizations hosting events, MHC
publicized statewide archaeology month
events through an event calendar brochure
and the distribution of an archaeology
month poster. In 2008 alone, there were 69
events in 35 communities.
5. Protecting Historic Resources through
Financial Support
Federal Investment Tax Credits and State
Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit
Massachusetts continues to rank in the upper third of states in terms of number of dollars spent
on rehabilitation projects under the Federal Investment Tax Credit program. The State Historic
Rehabilitation Tax credit, although capped at $50 million, has resulted in a significant increase in
federal investment tax credit applications. Staff at MHC presented the tax credit program at the
Traditional Building Conference and at Department of Housing and Community Development
Conferences. Set to expire in 2011, the state historic rehabilitation tax credit was recently
extended until 2017. The State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit program has grown in
popularity, especially during the past few years of economic downturn. In the calendar year
2009 alone, 76 projects were awarded historic tax credits. Of those, 54 projects created a total of
701 residential rental units, 46% of which were affordable housing. There is considerable
partnering with the state’s low-income housing tax credit and new market tax credits. Over
5,000 temporary and 9,000 permanent jobs were created in 2009. For every dollar awarded in
state historic tax credits, private investment has been leveraged at ten times that amount.
Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund
The Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund (MPPF) is a 50 % matching grant reimbursement
program established in 1984 for the preservation of historic properties, landscapes, and sites
(cultural resources) that are listed in the
State Register of Historic Places which are
either under municipal or nonprofit
ownership. Since the reinstatement of the
MPPF program in August 1994, sixteen
grant rounds have been administered and
nearly $42 million has been awarded in the
form of 657 grant actions. Grants for predevelopment, development, acquisition,
and emergency work have been awarded to
503 historic resources in 190 communities

within the Commonwealth. This represents an estimated total investment (with matching funds)
of roughly $84 million. During the most recent 5-year period, $5.65 million has been awarded in
the form of 142 grant actions. The majority of grantees request funding assistance for the
stabilization, repair, and restoration of the exterior building envelope typically involving roofing
repair/replacement, foundation rebuilding, masonry repointing, carpentry repairs, window
restoration, drainage systems repair/replacement, and painting. As a condition of funding,
property owners must execute and record an interior and exterior MHC Preservation Restriction
on the property’s deeded parcel of land. This ensures that the resource will retain its historic
character and integrity—long after the MHC-funded project is complete—through a formal
design review and approval process by MHC staff. The MPPF is a highly recognizable and
popular grant program frequently resulting in dramatic, visible improvements to historically and
architecturally significant resources throughout the Commonwealth.
Community Preservation Act
Since its passage in 2000, 147 communities have adopted the Community Preservation Act. The
CPA is a local option state law that helps communities preserve their open spaces and historic
sites, create affordable housing, and develop outdoor recreational facilities. CPA allows

Historic agricultural landscape in Groton protected through community preservation act funds.

communities to create a local Community Preservation Fund with money raised through
a surcharge of up to 3% on local property taxes. The state provides guaranteed annual CPA
matching funds based on these local surcharge collections,
providing a significant incentive to communities to pass the Act.
These combined funds are then available for use by adopting
municipalities on community projects in open space protection,
historic preservation, and the creation of affordable housing and
outdoor recreation. Within these 147 communities, historic
preservation is by far the most popular category of possible uses
of CPA - over $200 million in CPA funds have been appropriated
for use on more than 2,083 Historic Preservation projects. CPA
funds have been used to provide accessibility to historic buildings,
protect historic landscapes, restore farmhouses, churches, and
town halls as well as preserve historic documents. In some
communities, historic preservation and affordable housing have
been combined into one project. In other places, historic
preservation and open space preservation have resulted in preservation of a farmhouse with the
accompanying agricultural open space.

MHC Survey and Planning Grants
The MHC Survey and Planning grant program has very successfully provided CLGs and local
commissions with matching grants for historic property survey, national register nominations,
preservation plans, and public education projects. Over the past five years, MHC allocated
$651,540 to this program. With the local matches, the figure grows to $1,094,800 in funding for
historic preservation projects. During FY 2007, the survey and planning grant program was open
to all municipalities not just certified local governments. During this year, 19 projects received
funding.
National Trust for Historic Preservation Grants
Since 2005, the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) has awarded $1,485,096 in grants to 74
non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and public agencies in the state of Massachusetts.
Grantees are located in 47 municipalities within the state. Funds were used to support a variety of
planning, educational, and construction projects. In 2009, the Partners in Preservation Program, sponsored
by American Express in cooperation with NTHP, provided $1 million in preservation funding and greatly
raised the profile of preservation needs statewide.

Preserve America Grants
This federal program provides grant funding for projects that focus on economic and educational
opportunities related to heritage tourism. Examples of funded projects in Massachusetts included
promotional and marketing strategies for Gloucester and Lowell.
Save America’s Treasures Grants
Administered by the National Park Service, the Save America’s Treasures grant program
provides funding for nationally significant structures and sites. This matching grant program has
funded projects including the Colonel James Barrett House in Concord, the United First Parish
Church in Quincy, the Frederick Ayer Mansion in Boston, and Old Ship Meetinghouse in
Hingham.
Regional Grant Programs
John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor Commission–Heritage
Partnership Grant Program and the Essex National Heritage Area - Essex Heritage Partnership
Grant Program offered grants to member communities for historic preservation purposes.
6. Protecting Historic Resources through Assisting Local Governments
Historic Preservation E-mail List
Administered by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, masshistpres is a statewide listserve
with over seven hundred subscribers across the state. It remains a very active list made up of
local preservation commission members, preservation professionals, architects, consultants,
archaeologists, planners, and many others. The opportunity to learn, discuss, and offer advice in
a statewide digital format made up of volunteers and professionals provides a rich environment
for networking and information sharing.
New Outreach Material for Local Preservation Commissions
Over the past five years, the Massachusetts Historical Commission completed two DVDs for
local commission members. Local Historical Commissions in Massachusetts is a 50 minute
DVD covering all the basics of historic preservation planning. Local Historic Districts in
Massachusetts is a 1 ½ hour DVD covering how local historic districts protect historic resources,
the history of local historic districts, how to establish local historic districts, design review in
local historic districts, and proper administration of local historic districts. In 2008, MHC started
the Local Preservation Update E-Newsletter, a brief newsletter for local commissions covering
grant opportunities, upcoming workshops, new national register listings, websites to visit, and

other pertinent information for local commission members. Distribution of the electronic
newsletter has grown to approximately 2000 people. Preservation through Bylaws and
Ordinances – Tools and Techniques Used in Massachusetts was thoroughly revised with many
new case studies from around the state.
Local Commission Training Workshops
Over 70 MHC On the Road workshops were offered to local historical commissions, historic
district commissions, local historic district study committees, and the general public during this
planning cycle. The MHC On the Road Program includes modules on Introduction to Historic
Preservation Planning, Demolition Delay Bylaws, Establishing Local Historic Districts, and the
Certified Local Government Program. A workshop on the Secretary of the Interior Standards,
prepared by MHC staff, was also delivered at several conferences. The Historic
District/Historical Commission Committee of Preservation Massachusetts also developed and
delivered modules on Preparing MHC Inventory Forms and The National Register of Historic
Places.
Circuit Rider Program
The Preservation Massachusetts Circuit Rider Program, in partnership with the National Trust
for Historic Preservation, has funded three part-time circuit riders that have provided assistance
to local commissions, property owners, and concerned citizens regarding historic preservation in
their community. Services have included advocacy letters, grants, and access to information on
a wide range of topics. The three circuit riders are regionally focused with one circuit rider for
western/central Massachusetts, the greater Boston region, and Southeastern Massachusetts/Cape
Cod/Islands.
Department of Conservation and Recreation Heritage Landscape Inventory
During this planning cycle, the Department of Conservation and Recreation continued its
successful partnership with cities and towns in preparing heritage landscape inventory
reconnaissance reports. These reports identified valued heritage landscapes, discussed issues
with their preservation, and provided recommendations for their protection. During this
planning cycle, the program worked with 63 communities to identify 3,941 heritage landscapes
in the Freedoms Way, Blackstone/Quinebaug-Shetucket, Upper Quaboag/North Quabbin and
Connecticut River Valley areas.
Regional Planning Agency Preservation Planners
The Cape Cod Commission and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission have staff preservation
planners that assist local governments. At the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission,
preservation planning staff has completed inventory forms, national register nominations, local
historic district planning, tax credit application assistance, and public education projects such as
tours and booklets. In addition, PVPC reviewed housing rehabilitation projects under Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Local Archaeological Review
As requested, MHC was able to provide technical assistance to local governments on how to
develop archaeological reviews in local regulatory programs.
7. Protecting Historic Resources through Local Government Actions
Local Regulations
Historic preservation bylaws and ordinances at the local level increased during the past five
years. There are now 127 municipalities with a demolition delay bylaw or ordinance, an increase
from 108 five years ago. While most delay periods remain at 6 months, there are now twenty-

Local historic districts continue to increase more modestly
with most additions in communities with existing local
historic districts. The city of Holyoke established their first
local historic district on Fairfield Avenue. Several
communities established architectural preservation districts
including North Andover and Wellesley.
Public Education and Advocacy
Many local historical commissions recognized that public

success in preserving threatened resources by speaking out
and mobilizing residents.
Reactivated Local Historical Commissions
Several communities with inactive local historical commissions were reactivated during this
period such as Alford, Athol, Leyden, Richmond, and West Stockbridge. Most notable is Athol
which applied for and received a survey and planning grant for survey work in their downtown.
New Certified Local Governments
As the survey and planning grant program was largely limited to certified local governments,
interest in the program grew. Many communities inquired about the process of becoming a
certified local government. The town of Lexington submitted the application material and
became a Certified Local Government in 2009.
8. Protecting the Rural Historic Landscape
Agricultural Lands
Between 2002 and 2007, the number of farms and farm revenue increased dramatically in
Massachusetts, up over twenty seven percent. Amazingly, there was no net loss of farmland
during this time period. With
special assistance programs such
as the Farm Viability program,
the Department of Agricultural
Resources directly assisted many
farmers while at the same time
protecting farmland for the future.
In 2009, the Agricultural
Preservation Program recorded its
750th restriction. Over the past 30
years, more than 63,000 acres of
farmland have been protected.
Barns Program
Agricultural land located in the town of Gill
The Preservation Massachusetts
Preserve Mass Barns Program held three successful regional conferences for owners of historic
barns. In addition, information and resources for barn owners was placed on the Preservation
Massachusetts website.

Agricultural Commissions
From its introduction ten years ago, there are now over 100 cities and towns with an agricultural
commission. Through representing the agriculture community, agricultural commissions have
provided an advocacy voice for farmers, helped resolve conflicts, offered new markets for
products, put forward right-to-farm bylaws, and held educational workshops. All of these efforts
help to protect farmland and preserve rural landscape.
Massachusetts Land Trust Coalition
The Trustees of Reservations opened their 100th property, Cormier Woods, in 2008. Located in
Uxbridge, Cormier Woods is a 175-acre rural farmstead dating back to the early eighteenth
century.
Scenic Byways Projects
Scenic byway projects during this planning cycle included 6 corridor management plans and 3
land protection projects.
9. Protecting Historic and Archaeological Resources from Detrimental Natural Processes
MHC represented the historic preservation perspective on the advisory committee for a
significant, ongoing statewide disaster planning project to develop an Emergency Management
Framework for Cultural Resources – Coordinated Statewide Emergency Preparedness
(COSTEP), a significant pilot project led by the Northeast Document Conservation Center, the
Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, and the Massachusetts Archives. The pilot has
successfully raised the profile of cultural resources and their special needs in disaster planning
among the emergency management community, and has also brought greater understanding of
the emergency response framework to the cultural resources community. Participants in the
COSTEP project have included state and federal level emergency managers, and representatives
of the museum, library, archives, and records management communities.
10. Revitalizing and Protecting Historic Urban
and Industrial Areas
Federal and State Tax Credits
The federal and state tax credits provided
financial incentives to rehabilitate sites throughout
Massachusetts particularly in urban and industrial
areas. A study in 2009 by Preservation
Massachusetts concluded that the credits had a
catalyzing impact on many communities across
the Commonwealth.
11. Encouraging Historic Preservation through
Heritage Tourism
Visitors to Massachusetts
Massachusetts remains a very popular destination for heritage tourists due to its history,
significant historic sites, interpretation and access. According to the Massachusetts Cultural
Council, historic/cultural tourism generated nearly $2 billion in 2006. Tourism is the third
largest industry in Massachusetts supporting 120,000 jobs. Findings by MCC conclude that tax
dollars in Massachusetts when invested in historic/cultural travel have a more than 5:1 return on
investment. Cultural tourism includes arts, heritage, recreational, and natural resources. It is the

fastest growing sector of the travel industry. Cultural tourists spend considerably more per day
than other tourists and stay one half day longer at each destination.
Preserve America Communities
There are now twenty Preserve America Communities in Massachusetts. These are Blackstone,
Douglas, Falmouth, Gloucester, Grafton, Holyoke, Hopedale, Leicester, Lowell, Mendon,
Millbury, Millville, Northbridge, Plymouth, Salem, Springfield, Sutton, Upton, Uxbridge,
Worcester. Preserve America designations provide recognition for local efforts in the
appreciation and protection of historic resources and offer new avenues for enhancing heritage
tourism.
Distinctive Destinations
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has now recognized five communities in
Massachusetts as distinctive destinations. These are Chatham, Lowell, Northampton,
Provincetown, and Salem. This program recognizes both the preservation efforts of the
community and the memorable experiences for the visitor.
Heritage Areas and Corridors
The Blackstone River Valley, Quinebaug/Shetucket, Housatonic, Essex, and the newest heritage
area, Freedoms Way all marketed interesting events that highlighted the resources in their region.
Historic Places for Historic Parties
The Massachusetts Historical Commission began revising the popular handbook, Historic Places
for Historic Parties. This booklet lists the many venues around the state for hosting an event.
Scenic Byways
Administered by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the number of scenic byways
around the state increased to fifteen with Battle Road: The Road to Revolutions Scenic Byway
and Route 116 Scenic Byway established during this planning cycle. All fifteen scenic byways
offer marketing opportunities that encourage heritage tourism with their
interesting places to visit. Specific heritage tourism projects included
the western MA byways promotional campaign and the interpretive
signage and wayfinding on Jacob’s Ladder Trail.
12. Strengthening the Stewardship of Historic and Archaeological
Resources
Local and State Funding Programs
As mentioned previously, the Massachusetts Preservation Project Fund,
the Community Preservation Act, and the tax credit programs have
greatly assisted in the rehabilitation of significant historic resources
throughout the state.
Historic Curatorship Program
A window removed for

and Recreation (DCR) has generated over $10 million in private
investment at sixteen properties. Through this program, DCR partners with curators who agree
to rehabilitate, manage, and maintain historic properties within the state park system in exchange
for long-term leases.
Public and Private Property Owners
Often unrecognized are the many public and privately owned historic resources where
stewardship is ongoing and where annual funding is allocated for proper maintenance. Whether
it is a municipality diligently maintaining their town hall year after year, a homeowner reglazing
a wood window, or one of the thousands of historic property owners statewide with a plan in

place to care for their own resource, each one constitutes a stewardship success worth noting
here.
13. Protecting Historic Resources through Education and Public Awareness
Statewide Preservation Coalition
Organized by Preservation Massachusetts, the preservation coalition is made up of state,
regional, and local partners. It continues to serve the preservation community by providing a
strong collective voice when needed.
Homeowner Education
The membership based Historic Homeowner Program at Historic New England provides
homeowners with individualized assistance through the expertise of HNE professional staff on
paint colors, maintenance, design, and construction. The Springfield Preservation Trust offers a
list of contractors on their website.
Contractor Education
The Nantucket Preservation Trust Apprenticeship Program provides funds and educational
programs geared to contractors, builders, preservationists, and students to learn traditional
building methods.
Most Endangered Program of Preservation
Massachusetts
Over the past five years, this annual program
has provided a venue to recognize significant
historic resources threatened by demolition,
development, neglect or policies. As was the
case with the threatened Ames Shovel Shop in
Easton listed in 2008, the accompanying
publicity was a contributing factor in saving
this property from demolition.
Plaques and Marker Programs
Over 60 communities have a historical plaque
program with many communities such as
The Ames Shovel Shop in Easton

Lowell, Salem, and Nantucket actively using plaque
programs to recognize historic preservation activities,
increase owner appreciation and educate visitors.
Preservation Awards
Organizations such as the Massachusetts Historical
Commission, Preservation Massachusetts, Boston
Preservation Alliance, the New England Chapter of
The Whitin Mill complex in Northbridge was the the Victorian Society all have developed annual
recipient of an MHC Preservation Award.
Preservation Award programs to recognize projects
and people that have contributed to historic
preservation. In addition, many local commissions or non-profit organizations also have
preservation award programs. Together, the awards and events provide excellent opportunities
for education through the local media.

Walking and Driving Tours
Many local commissions, societies, and groups organize walking tours to highlight interesting
architecture, neighborhoods or sites. Tour topics offered in the city of Boston included
immigration, industry, archaeology, burial grounds, and many more. Technology is providing
new methods of offering on demand tours through hand held devices. The city of Lowell has
offered a very successful annual program, Doors
Open Lowell, which provides access to many
buildings and sites not typically open to the
public.
DCR Terra Firma Bulletins
The Department of Conservation and Recreation
(DCR) prepared a series of six educational
bulletins on preservation topics such as historic
roads, farms and town commons.
Modern Architecture
In order to raise awareness of modern
architecture, organizations such as the Friends of Modern Architecture/Lincoln, DOCOMOMONew England Chapter, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the Cape Cod Modern
House Trust have organized lectures, tours, forums, and symposia. FOMA/Lincoln offered a
panel discussions regarding the repair and upkeep of Modern houses allowing opportunities for
participation by attendees and the sharing of information.
Historic Property Survey Forms on the Massachusetts Historical Commission Website
Historic Property Information on the MHC website improved greatly with the introduction of the
first set of scanned inventory forms uploaded to the website. This project began with a scanning
plan and a pilot project to test methodology and technical standards. With support from a two
year Preserve America grant, scanning of MHC inventory forms began in 2009. In early 2010,
the first set of inventory forms with photographs were available on the MHC website.
Scanning National Register Nominations
The Massachusetts Historical Commission developed protocols for scanning National Register
nominations for posting on the website. The nominations from 1999 to the present have been
scanned and new nominations are scanned as they are completed. Posting these National
Register nominations on the website has been completed.
Massachusetts Historical Commission Publications
Numerous MHC publications were distributed during this planning cycle such as the annual
State Register of Historic Places, Preservation Planning Manual, Preservation through Bylaws
and Ordinances, Establishing Local Historic Districts, A Guidebook for Historic District
Commissions, and Archaeology Month calendars.
Press Releases
The Massachusetts Historical Commission issued press releases following each quarterly State
Review Board vote on national register listings. Additionally, MHC issued press releases for
annual Preservation Award winners and Archaeology Month.
Statewide Consultants Directory
The consultants directory found on Preservation Massachusetts website has provided an
excellent source for local commissions, municipalities, and citizens to find professional expertise
on a variety of preservation related topics.

14. Sustainably Rehabilitating Historic Properties
Greening the Older Home Workshops
During 2009, Historic New England, the Massachusetts Historical Commission, and the National
Trust for Historic Preservation-Northeast Office began offering a workshop on Greening the
Historic Home. Overall themes in the
workshop included windows, insulation, and
renewable energy. The workshops were well
attended and presented in Salem,
Newburyport, Medford, and Harwich.
Preservation and Sustainability Forum
During 2010, The Boston Preservation
Alliance convened a focus group to
investigate new methods of collaboration
between the historic preservation and green
building community on research methods,
marketing, and education.
15. Including diverse cultural and ethnic
communities in historic preservation.
Neighborhood Preservation Partnership
An exciting initiative over the past two years has been undertaken by the Boston Preservation
Alliance and Historic Boston Incorporated. Working in the neighborhoods of Boston, efforts
have included supporting historic property owners with technical assistance, offering a forum to
discuss what the neighborhood needs regarding historic and cultural resources and fostering
connections between the neighborhoods and city government. This has been accomplished
through two circuit riders dedicated to providing preservation assistance.

The Challenges Ahead
While the past five years has brought many accomplishments, challenges remain in the
preservation of the historical and cultural resources of Massachusetts. Utilizing the same
categories from the Major Accomplishments section, this section focuses on where those
challenges remain.
1. Identifying and Documenting Historic and Archaeological Resources
Survey Activity
While survey activity during the 2006-2010 period increased over that reported in the last 5-year
plan, survey activity is still much reduced from the 1990s. This appears largely the result of
state-level budget constraints that greatly limited the amount and availability of MHC Survey
and Planning grants during much of this time, though this was partially offset by the increased
availability of Community Preservation funds to support survey projects.
Communities with Outstanding Survey Needs
There remain 128 communities identified by Massachusetts Historical Commission as having
specific outstanding survey needs.
Many Community-wide Surveys Are Not Up-to-date
There are many communities that have not revisited their surveys in 25 or 30 years. The
documentation on the existing forms may be inadequate for current standards and coverage may
be insufficient. The development of a communitywide survey plan would be a particularly
important first step for communities with little or no survey. Plans are needed that target priority
properties for survey, identify significant historic themes, and establish a phased approach to
completing the identified goals. Plans and surveys need to address the full range of local
resources by type, period, theme, and location.
Local Historical Commissions
It is essential that local historical commissions develop plans for an active and ongoing program
to initiate, maintain, update, and expand their communitywide inventory of historic and
archaeological resources using MHC guidelines and inventory forms in accordance with NPS
standards for the identification and evaluation of cultural resources. As the local organization
responsible for historic preservation planning, the inventory should be the local historical
commission’s highest priority.
Funding Survey Projects
The major impediment to increasing the level of survey statewide is the lack of funding. While
many communities that have passed the community preservation act, have hired a professional
consultant directly or used CPA funds for a matching survey and planning grant, numerous
towns have struggled to find the funding for professional survey assistance. Over the past few
years, MHC grants have been typically limited to CLGs leaving non-CLG communities with no
grant opportunities. During the upcoming planning cycle, it is hoped that the survey and
planning grant program can be opened to non-CLGs.
Technical Assistance, Training and Support
In particular for those local historical commissions interested in preparing a survey plan or
completing survey forms themselves, there is a great need for additional technical assistance and

training. In cooperation with the Massachusetts Historical Commission, Preservation
Massachusetts prepared a powerpoint presentation on preparing inventory forms. Plans to
continue offering this useful workshop statewide are needed. At the Massachusetts Historical
Commission, a new and updated Historic Property Survey Manual is needed that reflects changes
in survey methods and technologies, including digital photography, GIS mapping, and internetbased research.
Professional Survey Contractors
With the majority of inventory forms submitted by professional historic preservation consultants,
it is essential that training and support is offered that sustains an active community of
professional survey contractors that can maintain high standards of field documentation and
research.
Public and Non-Profit Owned Resources
Municipal, state and federal agencies, non-profit land holding organizations, including regional
and local conservation land trusts own many historic and archaeological resources. In many
cases, these properties do not have adequate survey. New methods of encouraging survey of
public and non-profit owned resources are greatly needed.
Thematic Surveys
Under-represented in the historic resource inventories statewide are certain thematic resource
types including historic industry-related resources, agricultural resources and rural historic
landscapes, transportation and service infrastructure, commercial properties, designed
landscapes, resources with ethnic associations, properties associated with African-American
history, properties associates with Native Americans, and mid-20th century resources. While
several municipalities have initiated reconnaissance-level surveys of ancient and historic
archaeological resources in their communities, most statewide lack this level of information.
While particularly useful, challenges to completing thematic survey include multiple
jurisdictions as one thematic survey may include numerous municipalities.
2. Evaluating and Registering Historic and Archaeological Resources
Every year, MHC evaluates some 110-120 properties for their National Register eligibility. And
every year, MHC’s NR staff reviews, processes, and moves toward completion on average about
35 nominations, while double that number comprise a backlog of nominations awaiting review,
editing, additional research, and/or final processing. Funding
at both the local and state levels is a factor in the
considerable backlog. At the local level, commissions do not
have the funds necessary to hire a professional preservation
consultant to prepare the nomination, meaning more time
must be spent at the state level to produce a final nomination
that meets the NPS’s standards. At MHC, staff and funding
constraints both limit the number of nominations that can be
reviewed annually and brought to the State Review Board.
Nevertheless, interest in the National Register program
Maritime resources in Fairhaven
continues to grow, since the program is central to
preservation planning activities statewide and the access
point for limited protection and grants opportunities for historic and cultural resources. While
the volume of National Register nominations continues at a high level, a remarkable number of
cities and towns in Massachusetts have yet to see listings of any of their historic resources in the

Packet Pg. 240

National Register. Among the two dozen communities still without any NR listings since the last
plan, several have expressed interest in designation of one or more of their town’s historic
resources, even if those nominations have yet to be developed. These include the towns of
Bellingham, Carver, Chilmark, Oakham, Otis, and Wales. The MHC remains committed, where
possible, to facilitating nominations in such communities.
Older Nominations
With National Register listings as far back as 1966, Massachusetts has many early nominations.
While national and state standards for registration have changed, nominations from the mid
1980s and earlier need improved documentation to meet current preservation planning needs and
updated information to reflect current conditions. In addition, extending the period of
significance for early nominations is needed which will recognize many more contributing
resources.
Additional Education is Needed
There remains a need for additional training for local historical commissions and the general
public on the benefits and the process of listing properties in the National Register of Historic
Places. Designation in the National Register provides recognition, increases awareness of
historic and cultural resources, provides limited protection, and access to grant and funding
opportunities. Therefore, it is essential to provide access to the National Register listing process
through venues such as the Preservation Massachusetts training module.
Modernism
The resources of the mid 20th century, including suburban neighborhoods, commercial,
institutional, and civic structures, individual residences, and mid 20th century landscapes are
among the region’s least appreciated and most threatened historic resources. Expressions of
modernism are found in
Massachusetts as early as the
1920s, and examples continued
into the 1970s. Interest is
growing across the state in
recognizing these now-fragile
resources. Context studies are
presently in development for midcentury modern residences of the
Outer Cape, and for individual
houses and subdivisions in the
An example of modernist residential housing located in Lincoln
town of Lexington. It is expected
that over the next five years, a number of National Register nominations for modern residential
properties in these and other communities will be submitted. Other property types associated
with rapid postwar development—for example, schools, commercial buildings, defense-related
resources, transportation-related resources—also would be well served in terms of the National
Register program by increased context development to allow for more informed evaluations and
the protective and recognition opportunities that can come with National Register eligibility. One
very common property type will present a particular challenge in upcoming years—the 20th
century apartment building. In urban areas such as Boston and Springfield, thousands of
apartment buildings were erected in the early 20th century. With incentive opportunities for
historic rehabilitation, more examples of this property type are being presented for evaluation
and registration. Without context development, evaluation is challenging. The MHC expects to

collaborate with consultants and communities in development of context that will help
understand the significance and registration requirements of this common property type.
New or Little Recognized Property Types
There is additional need to evaluate properties associated with Native American tribes, AfricanAmerican, Portuguese, and other ethnic groups for whom few historic and cultural resources are
presently designated.
3. Protecting Historic & Archaeological Resources through State & Federal Regulations
Review and Compliance at the Massachusetts Historical Commission
The review and compliance program is difficult to predict since it depends on many factors
including the economy, finances, real estate market conditions, state/federal/local budgets,
investments as well as others. For instance, the federal economic recovery and stimulus
programs resulted in a 25% increase in MHC project reviews in 2009-2010. MHC responded
quickly to recovery project reviews, in order to assist with the stimulus programs. However,
there was no supplemental funding for hiring additional staff. In fact, the state budget decline
has further exacerbated MHC’s limited staffing problem. Even with these challenges, MHC
continues to use federal and state reviews as effectively as possible to result in preservation and
protection of historic resources.
Monitoring Existing Preservation Restrictions
MHC now holds over 600 preservation restrictions on grant-assisted properties. Updating owner
information, communicating with owners, and monitoring the restrictions on-site all require staff
committed to these tasks. This remains very challenging with limited staff availability at MHC.
Establishing Additional Preservation Restrictions
The demand for preservation restriction technical assistance remains very high as CPA related
preservation restrictions are implemented, as property owners seek to take federal tax deductions
and as organizations expand their easement holding activities. In addition, the resources
proposed for protection with a preservation restriction is highly varied. As each preservation
restriction must be reviewed individually based on the significant features of the resource,
processing the high volume of preservation restriction submittals remains challenging.
4. Protecting Archaeological Sites
Lack of Archaeological Survey
Only a very small percentage of the state has been subjected to an archaeological survey. As a
result, perhaps only 3-5% of the number of
archaeological sites expected to exist are
recorded in MHC’s inventory. Given the lack
of systematic archaeological survey across the
state, identification surveys are a priority
planning activity.
Archaeological Awareness
The general public has a lack of awareness
when it comes to archaeological resources.
Below ground resources may even be
overlooked by those in the preservation
community. Additional public education is

needed on the archaeology of Massachusetts.
Regulations Protecting Archaeological Sites
While MHC may reviews impacts to significant archaeological sites in Massachusetts through
review and compliance activities, most archaeological sites are on privately owned land. When
development does not meet a review and compliance threshold such as federal or state funding,
permitting or licensing, MHC review may be non-existent. Additional planning, education, and
local review are needed to better protect significant archaeological sites.
5. Protecting Historic Resources through Financial Support
Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund
Aside from the challenge of maintaining funding for this program, current challenges for the
MPPF program include developing a revised preservation restriction agreement which will
require a standard of baseline documentation in the form of existing conditions, photographs, and
other record documents. Similarly, the nearly 600 MPPF preservation restrictions, currently held
by the MHC, require the development of a more active covenant monitoring program. Presently,
MHC Grants Division staff is in the midst of notifying all owners of properties with MPPF
preservation restrictions to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities and to update the
MHC with current contact information as well as anticipated project plans.
Community Preservation Act
While the participation in the community preservation act continues to grow, challenges remain
for increasing statewide revenue and increasing local participation from economicallychallenged communities. During the economic downturn, real estate filings dropped
considerably resulting in far less revenue into the community preservation trust fund. From a
100% match several years ago, the average statewide match dropped to 31% in 2010.
Meanwhile, although 147 communities have passed CPA, passage by large, urban communities
as well as less affluent communities has lagged. Stimulating broader participation in CPA
remains critical to extending the preservation benefits of the Act to communities statewide.
Survey and Planning Grants
Due to budgetary constraints, the Survey and Planning
grant program operated at a minimal level during the
2006-2010 period. Except for FY 2007, only Certified
Local Governments were eligible to apply. As a result,
many worthwhile local projects could not be funded.
State and Federal Tax Credits
The state historic preservation tax credit was recently
extended until 2017. Maintaining this tax credit is
essential as the loss of this tax credit would be
devastating. Meanwhile, efforts to remove the $50
million annual cap have been unsuccessful.
20th Century Buildings
Funding challenges will also be present as recent past
buildings from the 20th Century age. Transitional
masonry buildings consisting of structural steel frame,
masonry walls, cast stone, and terra cotta are facing
Financial challenges face many historic

6. Protecting Historic Resources through Assisting Local Governments
Technical Assistance to Local Historical Commissions
While technical assistance to local governments is available through many different avenues
such as MHC guidebooks, handouts, DVDs, phone/e-mail responses, and on-site workshops, the
need for assistance remains greater than what is currently offered through commission training.
Too often, the bar remains high for volunteer commission members to accomplish essential tasks
such as survey, national register nominations, establishing local historic districts or mobilizing an
effort to save a threatened historic resource.
Circuit Rider Program
Although the circuit rider program is providing expertise and information to many local
communities, this program was funded for only a three-year period. Additional funding will be
needed to sustain this assistance program.
Heritage Landscape Inventory Program
The Heritage Landscape Inventory Program, administered through the Department of
Conservation and Recreation is on hold due to state budget cuts. This successful partnership
program between local communities and a state agency was a great loss with its abrupt
termination. Without it, many communities will be unable to identify important landscape
resources
7. Protecting Historic Resources through Local Government Actions
Local Historical Commissions
Historic preservation efforts statewide remain largely at the local level through historical
commissions and historic district commissions. Very few commissions have staff assistance and
so rely almost exclusively on the volunteer efforts of commission members themselves. Local
commissions face many challenges as they remain on the frontline of preservation efforts.
Among their challenges are recruiting new members, assuring adequate municipal funding, and
finding time to accomplish their goals. Many of the all-volunteer, local commissions are
overburdened and unable to establish a strong, effective, and
long-lasting presence in their community. Even though there
are nearly 3000 members that make up the commissions,
they are not well represented.
Inactive Local Historical Commissions
While almost every municipality in Massachusetts has
adopted a local historical commission, it is estimated that 15
% of commissions statewide are not currently active. In
these communities, there may be no one that can advocate for
a threatened resource, recognize the need for preservation
planning, or understand that preservation options and

strategies are available.
advocacy efforts to preserve it.
Demolition Delay Bylaws
An impressive number of communities established a
demolition delay bylaw over the past five years. Yet, there remain 224 cities and towns without
this basic level of regulatory protection. Additionally, most demolition delay bylaws remain at
only six months. This is often an inadequate period of time to seek alternatives to demolition.

Packet Pg. 244

Additional demolition delay bylaws are needed and with lengthier delay periods of twelve to
eighteen months.
Local Historic Districts
While 120 cities and towns now have a local historic district, that leaves 231 without the
protection of a local historic district. Furthermore, only a very small geographic area of the state
is actually protected by a local historic district. Most of the historic areas of Massachusetts
remain unprotected. Establishing additional local historic districts and enlarging existing local
historic districts is essential. While local historic districts remain the most effective preservation
tool available, passage of additional local historic districts remains very challenging. It is
estimated that only 10% of appointed local historic district study committees successfully pass a
local historic district through their local legislative body.
Local Historic District Commissions
With the vast majority of the local historic district commissions consisting solely of volunteers
without municipal staff support, district commissions struggle with design review,
administration, public education, and enforcement.
Volunteers Needed
Although not the case in all communities, local historical commissions and historic district
commissions are often facing difficulties in finding qualified, energetic volunteers to serve on
their commissions. As our culture increases its mobility, fewer people have a connection and
commitment to their hometown.
Other Regulatory Tools
While tools such as Architectural Preservation Districts remain an excellent option for cities and
towns interested in protecting neighborhood character without the more stringent design review
regulations of a local historic district, few communities have opted to establish architectural
preservation districts.
8. Protecting the Rural Historic Landscape
Development Trends
A report issued in 2009 by the Massachusetts Audubon Society found that 22 acres of land is
developed each day in Massachusetts with some areas particularly threatened by sprawl
development. While the report found good news that between 1999-2005 Massachusetts
protected more land than it lost to development, the threat to the rural historic landscape is clear.
As the report notes, agricultural land is highly threatened as we continue to build farther from
metropolitan areas. 87% of the development was for residential construction accounting for a
loss of 10,000 acres of agricultural land between 1999 and 2005. Without its agricultural
landscapes, Massachusetts loses a key piece of its character.
9. Protecting Historic and Archaeological Resources from Detrimental Natural Processes
Although Coordinated Statewide Emergency Preparedness (COSTEP) has made excellent
progress in integrating cultural resources into emergency management, they recognize that the
majority of cultural heritage institutions do not have an emergency plan with staff trained to
carry it out. With several recent floods in Massachusetts impacting historic museum collections,
the need for quick action through an emergency plan was acutely noted.
10. Revitalizing and Protecting Historic Urban and Industrial Areas
Urban and Industrial Areas

The majority of residents of Massachusetts live in urban areas. In many ways, the future of
historic preservation in Massachusetts rests with the urban
areas of the state. Large cities, medium sized cities, and
the small industrial villages scattered throughout the state
have the abundance of irreplaceable historic resources. As
manufacturing practices adjust to modern requirements,
many of these places face challenges in funding large-scale
rehabilitation projects and maintaining vibrant
neighborhoods. While urban revitalization success stories
abound, decades of job losses and disinvestment are the
common theme. The result is that many Massachusetts
Multi-family housing in the City of
residents choose new housing constructed on former

agricultural fields or woodlands while opportunities for
infill housing and rehabilitation are unmet. A report by
MassInc and the Brookings Institution released in 2007 focused on 11 historic mill cities and
found many concerns regarding their economic status compared to other areas of the state.
11. Encouraging Historic Preservation through Heritage Tourism
Drawing Additional Heritage Visitors to Massachusetts
There are numerous challenges regarding heritage tourism
particularly during the economic downturn. The state
budget crisis has greatly impacted the funding available to
draw visitors to Massachusetts. In many cases, state
funding for visitor centers has been eliminated. All of the
Visitor Centers on the Massachusetts Turnpike have been
closed. Publication of the Getaway Guide magazine has
Shaker Village, Hancock
ceased. Additionally, grants that encourage visitation to
area attractions have declined or been eliminated. At the
same time, discretionary income has declined bringing fewer travels. Museums have noted that
visitation by school groups has dropped off. All this could have long-lasting implications as the
next generation will have less interest in historic preservation and heritage tourism sites face
increased competition from other recreational venues.
Economic Impact Study
The economic impact study from 2002 clearly demonstrated the enormous impact of heritage
tourism on the economy of Massachusetts. This study is now almost ten years old and more
recent statistics are needed to encourage policies that protect historic resources.
12. Strengthening the Stewardship of Historic and Archaeological Resources
State Government Property
While the Massachusetts Historical Commission does not own any property in the state, many
state agencies do. These include the Department of Conservation and Recreation, Massachusetts
Department of Transportation, and the university system. State owned historic properties include
archaeological sites, buildings, bridges, landscapes, and structures. For properties in the DCR
system, one of the major issues remains deferred maintenance and the lack of funding to properly
maintain buildings and structures. At the MA DOT, challenges include the many historic
bridges in need of rehabilitation or upgrade. An additional concern of note is the need to make

Packet Pg. 246

certain that significant state surplused property is only sold with an appropriate preservation
restriction.
Local Government Property
Many of the same concerns noted for state property are also true for
property owned by municipal government such as deferred
maintenance, lack of funding, and disposition of surplus property.
State Government Policies
While most state policies and regulations consider their impacts to
significant historic resources, some state policies remain that do not
adequately take into account historic resources, community character,
and neighborhood revitalization. Of particular concern to many

Building Authority’s Model School Program which encouraged
Lawrence
demolition and new construction over additions and rehabilitation.
Historic Homeowners
Although historic homeowners own the vast majority of the historic resources statewide, there
are few resources to assist them with the stewardship of their property. There are currently no
statewide tax credits, loans or grants available to assist private residential historic homeowners.
Even more troublesome is the fact that finding qualified contractors sensitive and knowledgeable
regarding best practices may be hard to find or entirely unavailable in their geographic area. As
a result, homeowners may be left with few preservation options regarding maintenance of their
property. Aside from efforts at Historic New England, there is essentially no training in
Massachusetts directed to historic homeowners. This is a huge constituency that is not being
reached. Additional training for homeowners including
topics such as lead paint abatement, window repair, energy
efficiency, water infiltration, moisture, architectural details
and local history would be highly beneficial.
13. Protecting Historic Resources through Education
and Public Awareness
Statewide Preservation Coalition
The Statewide Preservation Coalition, made up of
preservation partners around the state, was particularly
effective at advocating for the Massachusetts Historic
Preservation Tax Credit. This broad coalition of local,
regional and state preservation partners could achieve
additional successes.
Utilizing the News Media
While the news media will often publish or broadcast
stories related to historic preservation, the news media is
not effectively utilized by the historic preservation
community. Particularly at the local level, commissions
need training and expertise that can help them develop relationships with news media, prepare
press releases, and respond to inquiries on historic preservation topics. While MHC prepares
press releases for preservation award winners and national register nominations, there are many
additional topics that would appeal to news media outlets and their consumers. The fiftieth

anniversary of the Massachusetts Historical Commission in 2013 offers unique opportunities for
publicizing statewide historic preservation efforts.
Additional Training Needed
There is a great need for additional historic preservation training. Besides local commissions,
other groups that would benefit from targeted training include realtors, contractors, and
developers.
Plaque Programs, Walking Brochures, and Other Local Education Efforts
Challenges related to funding are even impacting such local efforts as plaque programs and
walking tour brochures. During this economic downtown, the Bostonian Society was forced to
temporarily suspend any additional historical plaques.
Municipal Websites
Over the past five years, most municipalities now have an official city or town website.
However, a review of municipal websites demonstrated that many do not include a webpage for
the local historical commission or the historic district commission even when other boards and
commissions are listed. A local commission webpage is a valuable tool for education, outreach,
and strengthening historic preservation efforts and needs to be a local commission priority.
Massachusetts Historical Commission Website
Improvements to the Massachusetts Historical Commission website are needed including a more
user-friendly format for the citizens of Massachusetts. The website as currently constructed
assumes a level of historic preservation knowledge most visitors are unlikely to have. While
great progress has been made in accessing digitally converted text and photo files of historic
property inventory files through the MHC website, this remains a multi-year project to complete
the state.
Statewide Historic Preservation Conferences
Although annual statewide historic preservation conferences were held from 1999 to 2005, MHC
has been unable to maintain this event due to staffing issues. Yet, there is a great need for
bringing the volunteer and professional statewide preservation community together for training,
networking, and inertia. The continued success of other annual conferences for the land trust
community, planning boards, and conservation commissions demonstrates that an annual historic
preservation conference for the state would be a great benefit.
Massachusetts Historical Commission Newsletter
Staffing changes at MHC have presented numerous challenges to publishing a timely hardcopy
newsletter. It has now been several years since the Preservation Advocate, MHC’s newsletter
has been published. While the e-newsletter has helped fill this gap, there remains a need for a
more in-depth bi-annual SHPO newsletter.
Basic Historic Preservation Inquiries
Despite educational and outreach efforts, continued confusion over the National Register of
Historic Places and Local Historic Districts remains.
14. Sustainably Rehabilitating Historic Properties
Historic Buildings are Green Buildings
Historic buildings remain under great threat with the recent focus on green energy-efficient
buildings. Yet, new construction built in a completely car dependent outer suburban area will
likely be considered a green building. Yet, the historic building located in an urban setting is
seen as an energy waster. With the advertising and misinformation about how best to
accomplish energy-efficiency, the general public has an imbalanced perspective regarding

2/14/2011

State Historic Preservation Plan 2011-2015

historic buildings. This is particularly true for window replacements, deep energy retrofits and
where insulation is appropriate. Historic buildings are most often inherently green through their
embodied energy, walkable locations, quality construction, and natural materials. By upgrading
mechanical systems, sealing air infiltration and insulating appropriate areas, historic buildings
can outperform many new buildings. Yet, this message is not getting through effectively by the
preservation community even though energy auditors are stating similar conclusions. While the
rating system for sustainable buildings, LEED, is now recognizing the inherent sustainability of
historic buildings compared to new construction but there is a long way to go towards making
the point system an even playing field.
Window Replacements
The replacement of historic windows remains a great concern as old growth wood windows,
fully capable of rehabilitation and weather sealing, are removed and discarded. With the
financial incentives and extensive marketing, property owners will continue to purchase
replacement windows even when other strategies have a much better cost benefit analysis for
saving energy and money. The preservation community needs a vocal, proactive, and broader
message regarding the benefits of retaining original windows.
Deep Energy Retrofits
Other concerns include deep energy retrofits. Better documentation and monitoring of the
impacts of deep energy retrofits are needed. Some deep energy retrofits are clearly not
preservation friendly and do not meet the Secretary of the Interior Standards. Other energy
retrofit techniques may be acceptable. However, further research is needed into what short and
long-term damage may result as well as simple
cost/benefit analysis.
Alternative Energy Systems
Guidelines are also needed regarding alternative
energy systems such as accommodating solar panels
on historic buildings. The historic preservation
community needs to recognize that new installations,
while visible, can still meet the Secretary of the
Interior Standards.
Collaboration with the Energy Community
Too often, historic preservation is pitted against green
energy. Yet, recent discussions suggest that there are
many common goals and much that can be learned from each other. The historic preservation
community must reach out to the green energy community to clarify common ground and then
how best to market this message out to the public and policy makers collaboratively.
15. Including diverse cultural and ethnic communities in historic preservation.
Native American
With a past stretching back 10,000 years in Massachusetts, Native Americans have a distant past
and a recent past that offers perspectives for all residents of Massachusetts to learn and
appreciate. Yet, additional efforts are needed that can help to identify, document, and educate
regarding the Native American historic and archaeological resources present statewide.
Demographics
Massachusetts remains an immigrant state. In fact, if not for the additional immigrant
populations entering and residing in Massachusetts, the state would be losing population. In the

last federal census, the percentage of foreign-born persons residing in the state was 12.2%. This
offers both opportunities and challenges for historic preservation efforts. As the history of the
state is directly tied to immigrant populations arriving here, historic preservation can be brought
right into the present. However, while there are some exceptions, the historic preservation
community is in general not reaching out to new arrivals. Additional materials and methods are
needed that engage specific audiences.

Statewide Goals and Objectives
After reviewing the major accomplishments over the past fiver years, considering the current
challenges we face, this section looks ahead to the next five years for what needs to be done, who
is best suited to accomplish it, and a benchmark for how to reflect on the status of historic
preservation five years from now.
These Statewide Goals and Objectives can only be accomplished through the commitment of
many local, regional, and statewide organizations involved in historic preservation. Partnerships
are essential. So, too, is the recognition that each organization has unique strengths that will
collectively bring us closer to reaching these goals. For the first time, this State Historic
Preservation Plan identifies the organization(s) responsible or best-suited to accomplish each
objective.
It should be noted that some of the Massachusetts Historical Commission objectives found here
represent core responsibilities of the Massachusetts Historical Commission. These are included
here because the Statewide Goals and Objectives are referred to regularly and, most importantly,
form the basis of our Annual Work Programs. Each task included in our Annual Work Program
must refer back to the Goals and Objectives of this State Historic Preservation Plan.

Neighborhood Conservation Districts - On Looking etc.

Honorable Mayor, Cambridge City Council Members, Cambridge City Manager, and Members of the Cambridge Historic
Commission.
I write with respect to the citizen petition regarding Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCDs) that is
coming up for review in the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee. The petition seems to have emerged
from disgruntled individuals upset with the process underway to create a NCD in East Cambridge. This part of the city is
an area of critical historic importance to Cambridge and our vital immigrant and factory history. The timing of this
petition on the eve of the city’s celebration of its 400th birthday is also unfortunate. A study of existing NCDs in our city
and others indicates that NCDs are either neutral with respect to rising housing costs or tend to keep such price rises
lower than in non-NCD areas. The main petitioner’s social media posts have unfortunately confused NCDs with Historic
Districts which follow completely different sets of rules. The petition before the committee would have the added
impact of further increasing labs in the city (which take up critical housing space and make the city far less livable) – all
at the expense of housing.
I support the proposed changes by Mr. Sullivan to this petition. Specifically:
• On looking for more diversity: This is positive. Perhaps the CDC could provide CHC with the affiliated
neighborhood demographics (age, gender, and race) as a partial model or goal for new NCD members on each
local NCD from the recent U.S. census reports. Currently NCD members tend to be older due to fewer time
constraints and a desire to “give back” to the community as family and career commitments decrease, but if
younger people, especially renters, are willing to serve, they should be encouraged.
• On adding (where possible) renters to NCDs. This makes sense, providing such renters can be located and are
interested in serving. Sociological studies indicate that renters generally are less supportive of residential
building alternations in their neighborhoods than property owners, so this would encourage proponents of
major changes to get even more support from adjacent residents. In short, this move may make NCDs more
conservative than they tend to be in the city currently. Some will see this as a plus; others as a minus.
• On maintaining professional expertise on the NCDs: This is important (particularly architects, preservationists,
landscape architects). Most NCDs already have a healthy mix of professionals and non-professionals serving on
them.
• On adding a commercial property owner to the NCD. Many NCDs have very few commercial properties in them,
much less commercial properties owned by people who reside in Cambridge, but again CDD could be asked to
provide data on the percentage of Cambridge-residing commercial property owners to Cambridge-residing
residential property owners in a given proposed NCD in the assessment of what percentage each might have if
this is viewed as a critical need.
• On changing current NCD filing requirements: Eliminating existing rights of citizens – nationally or locally – is
not something we should be doing, and the same is true of this petitioner’s desire to eliminate the ten-citizen
petition for a NCD study. If it is eliminated for NCDs, what would stop the city from limiting other citizen rights
for other Cambridge petition forms?
• On requiring the CHC to identify all the opponents of a proposed district: This would be impossible, and it also
would make it much harder for renters to participate on such commissions because of potential competing
views by property owners.

Further re. opponents: I am one of a number of Cambridge residents who has continued to be harassed and
attacked by several of the petitioners of this anti-NCD group on social media - in part because of my early
support for the East Cambridge NCD effort and the East Cambridge Planning Team as a leader of another city
neighborhood group, the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association. Volunteer members of the CHC have
also been personally attacked by these same individuals on social media and in at least one case at their homes,
merely for participating in this process. Sometimes of those attacked have been members of underrepresented
minorities, precisely the group of people we are trying to bring into these boards. Freedom of speech is one
thing, but uncivil and unruly behavior on the part of those pushing for what seems to be largely a political
agenda should never be allowed much less encouraged.
On adding secondary criteria such as affordable housing and environmental criteria. This is a plus. NCDs
generally have the highest percentage of naturally occurring affordable housing. Recently in my NCD, a fourapartment rental building was demolished and replaced by two luxury condos (one still empty, several years
later). If affordability is brought into play, it is possible that this demolishment and repurposing would have been
viewed more negatively and not allowed. Adding environmental considerations is positive too, and may help to
stop the increasing McMansionizing by outside investors for far wealthier individuals seeking to purchase added
investment homes here. This might also prevent the new generation of housing investors and others from trying
to use every possible inch of green space for housing additions or infill that drive up housing costs for everyone,
destroy trees, and make our neighborhoods and city less livable.
On regular reviews of NCDs. This is positive. The Harvard Square Conservation District was recently reviewed
this way, thanks to a 10 person citizens’ petition, and this led to more collaboration and a recent re-zoning
petition.
On the proposed decadal sunsetting of NCDS. This would be onerous for CHC staff – as each renewal would
involve a multi-year process. Moreover, we do not do this for other ordinances and there are many residents
who would like to see sunsetting on a number of new changes from bicycle lanes to parking issues.
On limiting set back and dimensional requirements. Not only would this negatively impact the environment
(green spaces and trees - one of the factors now proposed to be considered with NCDs), but this also would
likely lead to more discord among neighbors.
On replacing a CHC member on the NCD after three years: It is not clear why one would want to replace the
CHC member on an NCD by a local resident after three years. I have found it helpful to have someone
knowledgeable about CHC historic decisions on the local NCDs, although presumably if CHC staff is present some
of this would be in place.

Cordially,
Suzanne Blier

City Manager Agenda item #4 (CC meeting 10/24)

City Clerk - Please include in the public record
I was pleased to see the inclusion of the Traffic and Parking Commission also known as a
Traffic Board on the Boards and Commission list developed by the city manager. This is an
important Board embedded in both state legislation and city regulation as an independent body
that provides an important check on the decisions of the Traffic Director and for citizens to
appeal decisions of the Traffic Director through a well-publicized public hearing process. It has
been inactive far too long
The Traffic Board needs to be reactivated so it can hear two citizens petitions signed by almost
200 persons living on and around Brattle St and Garden Street. Each petition asks for the City to
revoke actions taken by the Traffic Director that will have profound long-term impacts on their
neighborhoods and surrounding side streets. The law requires the Traffic Board to hear the
petitions within 2 weeks of of the date the petitions were filed.
The reactivation can be done quickly. Due to the “holdover” rules in Massachusetts its 3
members continue to be legal appointees to that board. I urge the city manager to reactive the
board with its current members so the petitions can be heard without further delay.

Bike Lanes, Parking, and the rapid deterioration of Central Sq

After 25 years, the Central Sq Starbucks is set to close due to crime. Bank of America will soon follow. Homeless people
occupy and run amok in Central Sq. Larceny attempts and stolen packages are daily occurrences in the neighborhood. All
you see on Mass Ave are more marajuna dispensaries.
Yet, all the city council does is to install these ill-conceived bike lanes (the madness of the spider web in Inman Sq, and
the one-two punch of bike/bus lanes in North Cambridge Mass Ave is truly breathtaking). You disregard the
transportation need and the concern of the elderly and the disabled, the safety of the pedestrian and the livelihood of
local businesses. I have a hundred more chances of getting run over by bikes and scooters that abuse the use of
bike lanes than cars that actually stop at the light. Adding insult to injury, you are now taking away the parking
mandate.
I have not been involved in local elections and politics for years, but it is about to change. What transpired in Cambridge
the past three years since the pandemic is a result of unchecked power. As a 25 plus year resident, home owner, tax
payer and a MIT/Harvard alum, I urge all of you to pause and reverse your position on bike lanes and parkings, and make
an active effort to clean up Central Sq. I am reflecting these concerns of many of my neighbors in mid-Cambridge and we
will soon communicate as a group. More emails will follow.
Thank you for your attention.

The Item for the agenda is as follows:The Trashing of CCTV's Citizen Journalist Blog!
Peace Be Unto You,
This information is intended for the City Council Person(s) that is assigned to CCTV, and the Committee/Board he/she is
on at City Hall, that relates directly to CCTV?
I think that trashing the CCTV Blog without letting any of the founders,contributors, and stakeholders know that CCTV
was ending it, is not just. The founders of the NeighborWorks Citizen Journalist class, put a lot of time and effort into
creating the blog, so that its members, contributors, and stakeholders could commit and submit local community
news,etc., and coverage. What about others from the old CCTV staff, board, and stakeholders that also contributed to
the blog existence, and making it popular in the Cambridge area and beyond. Ending it I feel was a dis-service to CCTV's
diversity, CCTV's strongest element. There should be some talk initiated to bring CCTV's Blog back. Can you set a date to
initiate a discussion at the CCTV Board of Directors,etc., meeting? Again, it is a crying shame that the CCTV Blog was
trashed the way it was.

Cambridge Local First's letter in support of the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning
Amendment
CLF Support Letter for Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment.pdf

Hi Cambridge City Clerk,
Good afternoon, I hope this email finds you well!
Cambridge Local First writes in support of the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment.
We are concerned about the continued expansion of biotech laboratories into Cambridge’s vibrant squares and
neighborhoods. While we are proud of the innovation that biotech laboratories have contributed, we fear that
excessive biotech expansion will continue to worsen the city’s staggering affordability crisis for locally- and
independently-owned businesses. The looming threat of such an expansion threatens locally-owned,
independent businesses across the city, as the profitability of biotech labs outcompete other uses wherever it
is allowed.
Please include the attached letter on the agenda, on the record.
Thank you!

Cambridge Local First writes in support of the Cambridge Lab Regulation Zoning Amendment.
We are concerned about the continued expansion of biotech laboratories into Cambridge’s
vibrant squares and neighborhoods. While we are proud of the innovation that biotech
laboratories have contributed, we fear that excessive biotech expansion will continue to worsen
the city’s staggering affordability crisis for locally- and independently-owned businesses. The
looming threat of such an expansion threatens locally-owned, independent businesses across
the city, as the profitability of biotech labs outcompete other uses wherever it is allowed.
We are grateful for a zoning change that defines the lab use by explicitly carving out similar but
non-threatening uses like dentist offices and academic research buildings, as these business
types can constitute local businesses. This language reads as:
"Technical office for research and development, laboratory & research facility. Any
laboratory engaged in research, experimental and testing, including but not limited to the
fields of biology, chemistry, electronics, engineering, geology, medicine, and physics,
including activities that require additional air exchanges over and above a regular office
use, or require the use of chemical hoods, biosafety cabinets, regulated chemicals, or
dangerous substances. This definition does not include laboratories primarily used for
educational purposes, medical and dental offices, including medical and dental offices
providing laboratory services to patients such as blood tests, stool sample analysis and
other similar services, innovation spaces, maker spaces, or other similar uses, or any
purely software based activities."
Lab spaces are estimated at around twice as profitable as other commercial office space.
Research shows that these lab spaces have an inflationary impact on rents and an adverse
impact on locally- and independently-owned businesses. Given natural profitability incentives
within our market economy and also historical evidence, we are concerned that if Cambridge
does not exclude labs from retail areas, we will end up with much less locally-owned retail, and
far more biotech laboratories, in the years ahead.
We encourage you to review the work of the Small Business Anti-Displacement Network
(SBAN), which is combating conditions that make neighborhood small businesses vulnerable to
displacement, particularly those owned by immigrants and people of color.
We at Cambridge Local First are eager to support policies that will advance the welfare of our
local, independent business community. Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let
me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Communicating Information from the School Committee

On Tuesday, October 18th, 2022, the School Committee held a roundtable discussion about the
Rindge Technical School of Arts review findings. A full report of findings will be available on
Monday, October 31st. A representative of Mass Hire presented on the metro north labor market
data to provide context for top growing industries in Massachusetts. The presentation highlights
job posting trends and the average salaries for positions within each top industry in the metro
north area and Cambridge. This data will help align which RSTA programs are represented
within the region.
This week, I visited the kindergarteners at the Fletcher Maynard Academy to read “Grace for
President” by Kelly DiPucchio and talk about the importance of running for office and voting in
elections. I also visited the kindergarteners at Peabody School to read “Abuelita and Me” by
Leonarda Carranza in honor of Hispanic Heritage month. It was a wonderful time to meet
students and answer their questions about being mayor.
Julie Craven has announced her retirement as Principal of the Rindge Ave. Upper School
(RAUC) at the end of the school year. Julie has been an educator for 30 years in which 28 has
been in CPS; 7 of which she has served as the Principal of RAUC. Please join me in wishing her
well in retirement.
Flooding occurred at the Fletcher Maynard Academy on three of the 4 floors due to a broken
water pipe that was impacted by the pipe replacements happening on Windsor St. Students were
able to remain in the building and affected classrooms were relocated to other parts of the
building that were not affected. Mr. Tynes and his team acted and responded quickly to this
situation to ensure no learning time was lost.

Superintendent Greer is working with Vedad Konjic, Tiffany Robinson, and Alicia Bairos to
review the school safety protocols and measures including but not limited to our active shooter
protocols, district preparedness for varied natural emergencies (i.e., fire, medical, etc.), and
facility vulnerability. As a result of this work, the district will launch a safety analysis of our
district facilities and safety practices/processes. CPS is working on the scope of services to put
this out for bidding.
Courageous Conversations, a CPS caregiver-led group, invites school staff, caregivers, and
community members to a workshop next week to examine how race and oppression shape
American society, from jobs and healthcare to neighborhoods and school communities. Register
