COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
MAYOR SIDDIQUI
COUNCILLOR TONER
WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Wage Theft Ordinance was previously introduced on September 20,
2021; and

WHEREAS:

Wage theft is a pervasive issue across many industries in Cambridge and traditional
law enforcement agencies lack the resources to address it effectively; and

WHEREAS:

Wage theft takes on many forms including the illegal misclassification of employees as
independent contractors, and is often accompanied by employer tax and insurance
fraud, with employers failing to pay their payroll taxes and workers compensation
premiums; and

WHEREAS:

Wage theft disproportionately impacts people of color and undocumented immigrants
who already face significant economic disparities in Cambridge and regionally; and

WHEREAS:

Wage theft is so prevalent in Cambridge’s construction industry that significant
financial incentives are necessary to motivate property owners and their general
contractors to take steps sufficient to ensure that wage theft does not occur on their
projects; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council is resolved to ensure that wage theft is prevented by ensuring that all
employers including subcontractors comply with state laws governing the payment of
prevailing wages and other wage and hour laws, the provision of workers
compensation coverage, the proper classification of individuals as employees versus
independent contractors, as well as state law concerning health insurance coverage;
and

WHEREAS:

Establishing a Wage Theft Complaint Process, a representative Wage Theft
Enforcement Committee, and a required annual report will improve enforcement of
wage theft across a wide range of industries, enhance communication with the
Attorney General’s Office, and ensure transparency and accountability; now therefore
be it

ORDERED:

of amending the Ordinance of the City of Cambridge to insert the language below:

2) Designees of the wage theft advisory committee shall be appointed for a term of
three years, notwithstanding initial appointments, and must be appointed no later than

or assistance or the granting of relief to said individual.
