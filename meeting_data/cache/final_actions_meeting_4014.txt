COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY
WHEREAS:

In the more than two years since the City Council first adopted the Cycling Safety
Ordinance, it has become apparent that there is a need to improve the process for
notifying residents and businesses in a more timely manner of forthcoming changes to
Cambridge’s transit and road infrastructure, and for a mechanism through which the
public can register their thoughts, ideas, and concerns about the new bicycle safety
infrastructure, and through which the City can utilize this feedback to improve upon
how this process is being conducted; and

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: To that end, it would be wise to ask the City Manager to convene a
standing Citizen’s Advisory Committee to provide pre-implementation input and post
implementation feedback; and

WHEREAS:

There are already many existing boards and commissions made up of Cambridge
residents who hold relevant expertise to review plans and offer improvements,
including the Pedestrian Committee, the Council on Aging, the Transit Advisory
Committee, the Vision Zero Advisory Committee, the Commission for Persons with
Disabilities Advisory Board, the Bicycle Committee, the Small Business Advisory
Committee, the Interfaith Community, and others who could all be asked to participate
to ensure that all the major stakeholders have an equal voice in receiving and
reviewing concerns and making recommendations to mitigate these concerns, and to
strengthen the City’s implementation of the bicycle safety infrastructure; and

WHEREAS:

On December 6th, 2021, the City Council requested that:
ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with
appropriate departments on what the standard public process will be prior to
implementing new sections of bike lanes consistent with the Cycling Safety Ordinance,
and what general evaluation process will take place post-installation, and to report back
to the City Council on these matters.
ORDERED: That the City Manager report back to the City Council on these matters by
January 31, 2022;
now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on the feasibility of
convening a Cycling Safety Ordinance Implementation Advisory Committee of the

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY
WHEREAS:

In recent months, North Cambridge residents, small businesses and other stakeholders
have raised significant concerns about the impact of the recent implementation of
protected bicycle infrastructure and priority bus lanes; and

WHEREAS:

The concerns have focused upon the loss of available parking spaces near their homes,
local businesses and medical offices; and

WHEREAS:

Based on feedback that was heard during meetings with northern Massachusetts Ave
residents, business owners and stakeholders, there are several approaches that could
address concerns of certain aspects of the bike and bus lane implementation along
Massachusetts Ave., north of Dudley St., that have not yet been implemented; and

WHEREAS:

Many residents, small business and stakeholders have offered solutions to these
concerns, including adding directional signage to indicate metered parking on side
streets, longer parking periods on some blocks, currently limited to 15 minutes, and
others; and

WHEREAS:

These solutions should be considered and communicated to the public on a possible
implementation schedule, or their infeasibility, in a timely manner; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to convene a meeting between the
Traffic and Parking Department, the Department of Public Works, the Fire Department
and any other relevant department to meet with the impacted residents and businesses
on northern Massachusetts Avenue to discuss their ideas and suggestions for
addressing their concerns, and others that have been put forward; and

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Department to prepare a formal response on the feasibility of
implementing the above-mentioned strategies; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
these matters as soon as possible.

Close encounter of snow kind observing impact of bike safety measures during
snowstorm

Dear City Manager, Director Barr and City Clerk
This morning, I drove an 86 year old, legally blind friend to Kenmore Square for a doctor's appointment because he
insisted on walking to Davis Square and taking the T. In a snowstorm like this morning, I would have had trouble walking
myself. On the way home, my system engineer's antenna was way up with curiosity. So I decided to drive on Mass Ave
from Harvard Square to Arlington line to see first hand the effect of the bike safety measures from Dudley Street to
Arlington line. From Porter Square on, the outbound of Mass Ave was still covered with hard packed snow so I switched
my 4 wheel mode on (and turned off electronic stabilization as required). Mass Ave from Dudley Street to Arlington was
totally covered so you couldn't see any lane markings and couldn't tell where the bus lane and where the general vehicle
lane were. I made an u-turn at Columbus Ave and headed south. On the southbound side, the snow plow must have
recently made a pass as the bus lane paint was faintly visible. .As I approached Cedar Street contemplating going
through the intersection and making a right onto Harvy then left onto Cedar Street or waiting for the right turn at Cedar
Street, the light turned red. I must have hit the brake a tad too hard. The car veered left and left front tire hit and
jumped the median but stopped an inch or less before hitting the sign post. Only damage is a punctured front tire and a
big bruise on my driving skill!
Other observations are
1) the bike lane appeared to have been plowed from what I could see from the left lane sitting higher in a SUV
2) while waiting for the signal to turn green at Cedar street intersection, I saw a plow coming down the outgoing
lane. Hopefully that made the lane markings more visible
This incident proved that sudden lane shifts and a very short distance to switch over lanes is a very dangerous situation
especially in a snowstorm like this morning. We already had two car accidents since the separated bike lanes were
installed on Mass Ave from Cedar Street to Alewife Brook Parkway. I am sure this rate of accidents is highly unusual.
I beg you to take immediate steps to mitigate the dangerous consequences of Cycle Safety Ordinance
implementation. And please note that I am not asking for you to remove the separated bike lane. I am asking for
remedial measures for business losses due to lack of parking, dangerous traffic patterns, increased traffic congestion to
name a few negative impacts.
Thank you for your attention and consideration
Young
Norris Street

Fwd: Writing in Support of Policy Order #1 and Policy Order #2 Around the Cycling
Safety Ordinance

Greetings,
I am sending this email, urging you each to support Policy Order #1 and Policy Order #2 around the Cycling Safety
Ordinance.
"When the Beginning is Right, the Ending is Right."
--- Ancient Chinese Proverb.
We want to keep Cyclists safe but not at the expense of all the other stakeholders involved in this issue. We want a
solution that is both inclusive and correct for everyone involved. One that does not discriminate or has to be redone in
time due to lack of proper consideration, planning, and execution.
My name is Lisa Bernazani and I am the founder / owner of Middle Path Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine in
North Cambridge. Over the past 23 years I've provided quality healthcare services to Cambridge residents and residents
in neighboring communities. I serve many elderly, disabled, injured, and pregnant Cambridge residents.
95% of my clients are Cambridge residents. 90% use their cars to come to my office. Removing / reducing parking for all
the Cambridge businesses will disable my business and likely the other businesses in our building and along Mass Ave.
I will be notifying my Cambridge clients of the these two policies and of the council members involved.
I support Policy Order #1 as there has been no Community Process / Democratic Process around this action. Many
business owners. patrons and residents learned about the removal of parking meters along Mass Ave. just before it
happened or as it was happening. Surely the Council Members are aware of this.
I also support Policy Order #2 as the current action discriminates against several groups of people including the
elderly, the disabled, the injured and business owners. It is not inclusive. It will also likely eliminate the livlihoods of
many small business owners, and will completely change the fabric of Cambridge and the kinds of services and products
available.
Best Regards,
Lisa Bernazani

WHEREAS:

In the more than two years since the City Council first adopted the Cycling Safety
Ordinance, it has become apparent that there is a need for a mechanism through which the
public can register their thoughts, ideas, and concerns about the new bicycle safety
infrastructure, and through which the City can utilize this feedback to improve upon how
this process is being conducted; and

WHEREAS:

To that end, it would be wise to ask the City Manager to convene a standing Citizen’s
Advisory Committee, similar to the “Implementation Advisory Committee” that was
established when the City enacted the 2003 ban on smoking in restaurants, to bring
together a panel of representative stakeholders to review, assess, and make
recommendations on the feedback received from the public on this matter; and

WHEREAS:

Such a committee could be comprised of two members from the Bicycling Committee,
two members from the Pedestrian Committee, two members from the Small Business
Community, two members from the Senior Community, two members from the Interfaith
Community, two members from the Disability Commission, and so forth, to ensure that
all the major stakeholders have an equal voice in receiving and reviewing concerns and
making recommendations to mitigate these concerns, and to strengthen the City’s
implementation of the bicycle safety infrastructure; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to appoint a 20-25 person Cycling
Safety Ordinance Implementation Advisory Committee to advise and improve upon the
implementation of the citywide bicycle safety infrastructure and to establish
recommendations on mitigating any concerns raised in regard to this infrastructure, with
the appointments to be announced no later than January 31, 2022.

That the City Manager is requested to convene meetings between his office, the Director
of the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department, and with the heads of the
Neighborhood Business Associations, with the Neighborhood Associations, and within
each of the Cambridge Housing Authority’s senior buildings, to ensure that these
stakeholders are given the opportunity to collaborate on devising new plans that will

infrastructure that works for bicyclists, motorists, pedestrians, seniors, those with
mobility impediments, the local business community, and all our residents.

WHEREAS:

In recent months, Cambridge residents – primarily senior citizens and those with mobility
impediments – as well as representatives of the local small business community have
grown increasingly vocal in citing significant concerns about how the City has gone about
erecting 25 miles of protected bicycle infrastructure; and

WHEREAS:

The concerns from seniors have largely focused upon the loss of parking spaces near their
homes, which has led to numerous cancelations from visiting home health aides who have
been unable to find nearby parking spots, as well as the loss of parking spaces near local
businesses and medical offices, which creates a significant barrier to patronizing these
establishments and offices by those unable to walk more than very short distances; and

WHEREAS:

The concerns cited by small businesses include: lamenting the loss of critical loading
zones near their establishments, the loss of parking spaces which is creating a hardship for
some employees, and the loss of metered parking which is creating new barriers to
potential patronage of these establishments (most of which are already desperately
struggling to survive the worst fiscal impacts of the pandemic); and

WHEREAS:

Those reaching out to the City Council have not suggested that the City should reverse
course and abandon plans to make our roadways safer for bicyclists – rather, they are
urging that the City reconsider how it goes about this process, and that the City abandon
the “break it now/fix it later” approach that appears to have been taken; and

WHEREAS:

The requirements and timelines laid out in the 2020 amendments to the Cycling Safety
Ordinance state that the City must erect 25 miles of interconnected bicycle infrastructure
in the coming years – yet nowhere in those requirements is it stated that this infrastructure
must remove parking or potentially come at the expense of those who rely upon motor
vehicles to move about the city and patronize our local businesses; and

WHEREAS:

The method of implementing this critically necessary bicycle-safety infrastructure was a
choice made by the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department, and it is becoming
evident that this particular choice placed expedience above the kind of methodical,
holistic planning that is required to ensure that in solving one problem, the City does not
inadvertently create two new ones; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Department to prepare a formal response to the above-cited concerns
raised by local senior citizens and local business owners outlining how the City can and
will thoughtfully address these concerns in the already impacted areas of the city and all
new areas going forward; and be it further

public testimony for January 10, 2022 Cambridge City Council meeting item re Cycling
Safety Ordinance

Dear Cambridge city councilors and city staff,
I am writing to thank you all for your efforts to create and expand Cambridge's network of protected bike lanes (PBLs),
and to encourage you to continue developing a transportation network that meets the needs of all users, without
unduly privileging the convenience of any one group over the safety of other groups.
I live in Somerville but regularly travel through Cambridge for work (Kendall Square) and shopping + entertainment
(Central Square, Harvard Square, Porter Square). I own a car, but whenever possible, I always prefer to travel in
Cambridge by bicycle or public transit, rather than using my car.
There are of course users who prefer to travel by car, some of whom have been vocal in their opposition to the PBLs. It is
natural and expected that when an existing system that privileges one group (e.g., a Cambridge street network that
privileges the convenience of car owners) is changed, that group will be upset at any loss of their privilege. However, any
backsliding on the PBL network will effectively constitute a restoration of city-subsidized privilege for car owners,
which we have seen from recent history is a subsidy that costs the lives of bicyclists.
Introducing PBLs on streets formerly designed solely for motor vehicle use is a highly effective way to incentivize bike
usage while disincentivizing motor vehicle use. As both a car owner and a bicyclist, I am happy to sacrifice a small
measure of my convenience as a car owner in exchange for making the streets safer for bicyclists, and PBLs make it even
more likely that I will choose to make any given trip by bicycle. I hope the city council and city staff will continue to
create and expand the PBL network.
Thank you for considering my comment.

Public comment on bike safety

My name is Jane Hirschi. I reside at 39 Rindge Avenue in north Cambridge. I own a car even though I mostly get places
by walking. I also regularly use my bicycle to commute to work and to shop at businesses throughout Cambridge. I was an
irregular bike rider 15 years ago but have increased my bicycle riding as I’ve felt Cambridge roads become safer over the
past few years. I feel safer and much more comfortable riding on protected bike lanes and I am grateful to the city for
extending protected bike lanes to North Cambridge. It has without a doubt increased my mobility. As a senior, I rely on
protected bike lanes to give me a small but significant buffer from car and bus traffic. I know it makes me more visible to
car drivers as well. I have experienced that myself when I’ve been on the other side: driving a car and trying to see
bicyclists. I am an enthusiastic patron of businesses in my neighborhood: my dentist Dr. Bane, Pemberton Market,
Spindler, Spice Curio and Greek Corner to name a few. I’m grateful that these wonderful establishments are increasingly
accessible to people on foot and by bike. I want to thank city workers for their efforts to create new protected bike lanes
and protected bus lanes, and hope that the city will continue to support North Cambridge businesses by considering ways
to keep our streets safe for all types of transportation.

Bicycle safety comment

My name is Tom Hirschi and I reside at 39 Rindge Avenue.I am a 68 year-old resident of North Cambridge who works in
Central Square. I have ridden my bicycle through the winter for the last three years, and plan to continue to do so as
long as I am able. I’m deeply appreciative of the protected bike lanes on Beacon Street that I use on my daily ride to
work. My wife and I share a car that I drive about once a week.
My desire is for the city to privilege mass transit, so that it becomes the easy, convenient, inexpensive (if not free) first
choice for everyone. Continuing to expand the bicycle infrastructure until it becomes a connected network you can use
to ride anywhere in Cambridge/Somerville/ Boston is the next priority.
I’ve noticed in cities that have moved in this direction for a sustained period, that small businesses thrive with improved
biking infrastructure, as folks make more frequent trips to business areas by bike than they do when confined to a car. It
is a fact that you can park ten bikes in one car parking spot!) When biking infrastructure reaches a certain point, it can
become the preferred mode of getting around, including for children and more senior people like myself. Nothing new
and positive comes without significant growth pains. Let’s not let those growth pains retard the great progress we’ve
already made.

Massachusetts Avenue Bike Lanes

Cambridge City Counselors, appointed City Officials, and Elected City Officials:
We write this letter as a desperate plea and a summation on how the installation and
implementation of bike lanes along Massachusetts Avenue have devastated our once relevant
business and countless others along this main retail lined commercial thoroughfare. Let’s start
by letting you know our names are Brian Lesser and Michael Scelfo, current owners and
operators of Waypoint restaurant located at 1030 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge. We
have been open for a little over 5 years and have invested over $2,000,000 in the construction
and operation of our fine dining establishment. We’ve received numerous local and National
accolades and have been a viable and supportive neighbor to existing residents in our
area. We have employed over 70 employees during our peak in operations prior to the start
of the pandemic, and we have fought tooth and nail to keep our doors open during these most
difficult of times.
We apologize for what’s to come, but someone must hear these logical and rational points and
the affects they have on the already beat up retail operators along this commercial
stretch. No input, dialogue, discussion, notice, or even process was given to us, business
owners, prior to this costly and dramatic disruption to our already fragile business. We not
only rely on the ability for patrons and employees to park along this commercial street, but
also receive deliveries, have employees, customers, and commercial ride share operators drop
off as part of the natural course of our workday. The installation and implementation of the
bike lanes outside and along both sides of Mass Ave, up and down our corridor, have made
any stopping or drop off of any type impossible. There are no legal driving means to stop, and
the safety of all involved is considerably compromised if anyone tries to do so.
Here are our facts. Sales are off 40% or greater since the installation of these bike
lanes. Customer complaints and reviews on restaurant accessibility are at an all-time high, and
for the first time we have heard from long standing customers letting us know it is just too
difficult to patronize the restaurant due to these direct changes. We also no longer attract any
last minute or impulse patrons due to the fact you can’t stop or pull over.

At some point, you just have to ask if anyone really weighed the impact or considered possible
solutions before implementing such a disruptive and permanent option. Like, why do bike
lanes on both sides of the most commercially dense retail corridor of Mass Ave have to be on
Mass Ave? (The most commercially traveled also is the most dangerous to pedestrians and
bikers.) Why can’t the bike lanes be on any of the streets which run parallel to Mass Ave
either North or South of Mass Ave? Why not ask for input, or have an inclusive discussion with
the actual businesses which will be directly impacted by the implementation of these bike
lanes along the retail corridor? Why was the erection of the bike lanes rushed to open at the
beginning of November just in time for the winter season? Is the winter season the most used
cycling time, or based on what we know probably the most impactful season on retail
businesses due to Covid? Does anyone really think cyclist using the bike lanes on Mass Ave
stop and patronize the retail businesses along the route? How difficult will it be to plow
during snowstorms and what affect will it have on the direct businesses along the bike lane
route?
The simple fact is we are a restaurant open for dinner 7 nights a week. The bike lanes are
mostly unoccupied during our normal evening hours especially when it is dark, which is even
earlier during the winter season. Since the beginning of November, we have seen a dramatic
decrease in sales and have heard countless complaints from patrons on the difficulty to
patronize our restaurant. For all of the good the City of Cambridge has done with different
programs and grants geared to assist small businesses during the past two years as a direct
result of the pandemic, it’s hard to believe that such a drastic implementation of bike lanes, of
all things, will probably be the final nail in many retail operators coffins. It’s a shame to think
we could make it through the pandemic, but the simple implementation of bike lanes will kill
small business. Very harsh, but very real.
Sincerely,
Brian Lesser & Michael Scelfo

Letter to Cambridge City Council re: Tenant Protection act

January 10, 2022
To Cambridge City Council,
As a positive and flexible way to join the effort to challenge the income inequity that is running rampant
throughout the country, we write to support, the Tenant Protection Act legislation which would end the
current ban on rent control and offer one piece of a comprehensive solution to the affordable housing
emergency by enabling local rent stabilization and tenant protections. It does not require these protections or
prescribe the details of these protections for any given community — instead, it repeals the preemptive
provisions of Ch. 40P, allowing our municipal officials to bring everyone to the table — renters, homeowners,
and landlords alike — to consider tenant protections that make sense on the local level.
We cannot continue to allow run-away real estate speculation define who can afford to live in our community.
We need to find a way to regulate prices and encourage rental opportunities so that our adult kids and longterm residents can afford to continue to live in Cambridge.
The Tenant Protection Act gives us a flexible process to move ahead, a step at a time, to solve one of
the great inequity problems in our society. It brings key stakeholders to the table to challenge one of
the major causes of the destruction of our communities.
The Tenant Protection Act does not solve the housing crisis problem in Cambridge, but it sets us a
positive course to do so by ending the ban on rent control and allowing us to move ahead to find
equitable solutions. Please do not let this opportunity get away. Support The Tenant Protection Act.

Bike lanes from perspective of North Camb cross street
Trucks coming from Mass Ave..jpeg; Trucks on Walden middle of road.jpeg

Dear Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,
Happy New Year, and congratulations on starting a new term! Thank you for continuing the dialogue over street safety
on North Mass Ave. I live one house down from the corner of Mass Ave. and Walden street. I do not own a car and bike
everywhere, but I also feel that Walden and other cross streets like Rindge have not been adequately prepared to
absorb the additional trucks and traffic. Removing one lane of traffic on a major corridor has not only created backups
and speeding elsewhere, but created serious problems during traffic incidents. One example is the car accident on
December 27 on Mass Ave. by Cottage Park. Traffic was gridlocked on Sherman and Rindge for over an hour as the
seriously damaged SUV blocked the single travel lane on Mass Ave.
Before we build protected lanes further, we need to ensure that turn signals and road infrastructure properly manage
increases in traffic flows onto streets like Walden, Cameron and Rindge. CDD predicted increases in traffic volume
during the project proposal stage. Now, we have to act. We cannot protect bike safety in one place and compromise it
elsewhere.
Thinking of Walden, a few interventions would be helpful prior to the implementation of the protected lanes. There are
certainly others based on the relevant cross street. For Cameron, for example, anything to slow traffic before the bike
path crossing would be welcome. I have witnessed some very close calls.
• A "your speed" speed reading sign on Walden. Both sides would be helpful but the sign is most needed heading

away from Mass Ave.

• Updated speed limit signs that show the current citywide speed limit (replace the one near the four-way stop at

Walden and Richdale) and add speed limit signs on both sides of Walden heading down towards Mass Ave., as
this is where speeding starts. I imagine more speed limit signs would be valuable further up Walden, but I am
less familiar with the traffic situation up there and assume that the four-way stop at Raymond and the light at
Sherman help to slow traffic. People are going way above the speed limit on Walden, which is dangerous
considering how narrow the street is and that it's a residential area with elder housing and kids.

• Enforcement of trucks turning left onto Walden. According to signage, trucks are not allowed to turn left on

Walden from Mass Ave. or drive at Richdale and Walden. Trucks slow traffic significantly when they turn.
They then speed up Walden, which is dangerous due to visibility issues and the location of crosswalks. Trucks
also lead to long backups on trash day, as trucks can't go around DPW vehicles.

• Stop allowing turns onto Walden from Mass Ave. when the walk sign is on across Walden. This occurs when the

yellow, blinking left turn light is on at Mass Ave. It seems every day a car quickly turns across Mass Ave.,
nearly missing oncoming traffic and then coming close to hitting pedestrians crossing when they have the
walk light. Traffic does not seem to back up too much at the left turn lane on Mass Ave., so why not do away
with the flashing yellow left-turn light? Only allowing left turns when the green appears (and pedestrians are
no longer being told that it's okay to cross Mass Ave) would stop pitting cars against pedestrians and
oncoming traffic at the intersection.

Speaking for people who are not in this room, but do live in Cambridge MA, a reminder of

The demographics of your constituents
•
•
•
•

40% of households do not own a car at all
~35% of people commute with public transportation
7-15% of people commute by bike (depending on neighborhood)
There are 6600 school children who live in Cambridge, ages 5 to 19, don’t we wish more safe

Pedestrians and cyclists:
•
•
•
•

Spend more seconds and minutes passing retail stores
Have greater knowledge about what individual stores sell
Find local stores the most convenient and obvious when searching for a product/service
Can stop immediately for impulse purchases

Drivers in cars cannot do this.

This policy order – creating a committee of 25 people -- is a red
herring, seeking to slow down the pace of reclamation of public

Despite longstanding popular belief, bicycle lanes can actually improve business. At worst,
the negative impact on sales and employment is minimal, according to a new study.
Researchers studied 14 corridors in 6 cities -- Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Memphis,
Minneapolis and Indianapolis -- and found such improvements had either positive or nonsignificant impacts on sales and employment. Essentially, adding improvements like bike
lanes largely boosted business and employment in the retail and food service sectors.

STUDIES
A NYC, 2012 study, following the construction of a bike lane on 9th Avenue, found local
businesses saw an increase in retail sales of up to 49 per cent, compared to a three per
cent increase in the rest of Manhattan.
A broader evaluation of bike lanes in the Big Apple conducted by municipal officials in
2014 indicated that streets with protected bike lanes experienced retail sales spike by
up to 24 per cent compared to streets without protected lanes.
In Salt Lake City, 2015 sales tax statistics also noted a sales bump with new bike lanes.

Positive results have been seen in San Francisco too; after bike lanes and wider
sidewalks were installed, two-thirds of merchants reported that increased levels of
bicycling and walking improved business, only four per cent said the changes hurt
sales.

Please Support Transit and Safe Streets

Dear Cambridge City Council and City Manager,
I am a resident of North Cambridge. I live and work in Cambridge. My children go to school in Cambridge public schools.
I am writing again after discussion was tabled during the previous meeting.
First, I am writing to thank the Traffic Parking and Transportation Department for implementing the Cycling Safety
Ordinance and prioritizing transit over automobiles. As a result, the traffic in North Cambridge is adjusting to the new
layout, and it is much safer (and a bit slower) during rush hour. Claims of dire consequences and gridlock have not
proven to be true. I appreciate this difficult work and hope to let you know that is it appreciated even as a vocal minority
complains loudly. The 77 is a much better ride. Thanks!
City Councilors, I urge you to vote against Policy Order #277. It makes the case that parking is more important than
safety. I'm afraid I have to disagree. I also cannot agree that the current approach of prioritizing safety and transit needs
to change. Moving forward with the quick build projects should be a priority. We know, and I know personally, that near
misses and crashes are far too common on streets with poor infrastructure, and have a lasting impact on those involved.
Meetings with stakeholders are already occurring. There are plenty of ways to contribute to the holistic redesign of Mass
Ave taking place on a longer timeline. Asking the Traffic Department to create a formal response to the concern that
parking must be removed for safety is just a distraction and not a good use of city resources. This order makes it seem
that the Traffic Department has not made efforts to accommodate the needs of businesses, people with disabilities, and
residents or non-residents who currently use parking. They have, but every parking spot cannot be preserved and this
policy order should not move forward stating that avoiding parking loss is the goal of future projects. Safety and transit
should be prioritized and impacts to parking minimized.
I also urge you to reject Policy Order #276. I do not believe this committee is needed to advise and improve upon bicycle
safety infrastructure. There are existing mechanisms for the public to register their thoughts, ideas, and concerns. We
have seen that the public is quite happy to register their concerns. Recommendations regarding this infrastructure
should come from qualified city engineers who incorporate feedback, freely and abundantly given through current
channels, while balancing the city's safety and transit forward goals.
All the best,
Tim Russell

Our Covid quagmire

To the city council:
There is much I would like to see you accomplish this term, but there is no doubt what your priority must be: helping to
lead us out of our Covid quagmire.
Cambridge in 2020 was a depressing place to live. In 2021, it was maddening. Despite the widespread availability of
miraculous vaccines, the message coming from the City was that the public was still at great risk. A mask mandate was in
place for all but two and a half months. Even then, public health officials told people that masking would be wise. The
result: a populace living in unnecessary fear of a virus that put the overwhelming majority of them at an extraordinarily
low risk for severe illness. Despite the incredible effectiveness of these vaccines, the message the City sent has been
clear: the vaccines don't really work.
To be clear, this wasn't just coming from Cambridge. Much of Blue America has been misled into believing the vaccines
aren't especially effective. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation Poll said that 52 percent of vaccinated people are
personally worried they will get seriously ill from Covid. It's no wonder that this city has turned into a zombie land
where most people wear masks outside, even though outdoor transmission is extremely unlikely when not in a densely
packed crowd.
I'm writing this to you from WeWork even though maybe I shouldn't be here. But I can't bear the prospect of working
from home after my mental breakdown over the summer that was the result of many months of near-solitude. In
retrospect, I should have ventured out into the world more when rates of transmission were low in preparation for a
winter wave that actually would present a genuine community risk. Hindsight is 20/20, but I sure wish our leaders hadn't
been at DEFCON 1 this whole time.
Now is clearly not the moment to lift the mask mandate, but once the omicron wave passes, it will be time to ditch the
masks, accept endemicity, and move on from this pandemic. Everybody over the age of four has had ample opportunity
to get vaccinated. The very young children who haven't been vaccinated are at a *very* low risk of severe illness. And
let's face the uncomfortable truth that masks and mask mandates are not especially effective at slowing the spread.
If everybody in a given space is wearing a good mask properly, then they can provide some protection. But we know that
many people don't follow the best mask practices.
And even if they do properly wear masks when they go to, say, Trader Joe's, there are many times during the day when
they aren't masked. We know that households are among the most common, if not the most common, places where
Covid is transmitted. Cambridge has had a mask mandate in place since early September and our cases are soaring, up to
an average of 272 per 100,000. Boston is averaging 343 per 100,000. Would the numbers be worse without a mask
mandate? It feels likely, but there isn't clear evidence. In California, mandates were enforced at the county level for six
months and there was no evidence that the mandates made a difference. Evidence in schools is inconclusive. At best,
mask mandates are marginally effective. So we need to consider whether they are worth the tradeoff.

Attachment: Dan Eisner Our Covid quagmire (COM 30 #2022 : A communication was received from Dan Eisner)

Perez, Lori

There is no question they are absolutely not worth the tradeoff. The thing that has driven me most up the wall during
this pandemic has been the insistence that wearing masks aren't a big deal—that in fact, they're good and show a
dedication to working together toward a common purpose. Somehow, we're supposed to believe that hiding our smiles

Packet Pg. 146

3.30.a

We need to get back to normal as soon as possible. The toll the pandemic has taken on mental health and the business
community is severe. Nationwide, murder, reckless driving, drug overdoses, drinking, and unruly airline behavior are on
the rise. People are lashing out because they are fed up. I fear that another winter of disruption and instability will
convince our restaurant owners, who have fought so valiantly to keep their businesses afloat, will finally give up and
conclude it's simply not worth it.
Finally, please do what you can to dial down the fear. Saying that omicron is a dangerous variant, despite all the
evidence that it's less dangerous than previous variants, isn't helpful. Nor is it helpful to say that we are back in some
ways to where we were a year ago. Comments like these make people fearful. Fear contributes to anxiety and impairs
healthy decision-making and making sensible risk assessments. It's why we have mistreated children, keeping them out
of school and forcing them to wear masks, unlike much of Europe, even though Covid is no worse than the flu for kids
under 12. Fear is why we don't recognize the damage our monomaniacal focus on Covid has done.
Thank you for your time,
Dan Eisner

and most of our emotions from one another brings us closer together. It's facially absurd. I feel the need to drive this
point home since these obvious truths seem to have been lost on so many people: Masks make it difficult to
communicate, obstruct our emotions, cover our smiles, and interfere with our ability to form human connections. Smiles
don't just express our own happiness and joy, they spread happiness and joy to others. I sometimes think about all the
smiles I have not been able to see during the pandemic. It's so depressing. And masks contribute to the general sense
that Cambridge is a dangerous place to be. There's a push from national public health figures as well as at least one
member of this Council to make masks a permanent feature of our landscape. I find the prospect odious and will fight it.

Residents Alliance urges support for PO 4, Alewife development moratorium

Dear Mayor and City Councilors,
The Cambridge Residents Alliance urges you to vote in favor of PO. #2, which calls for a moratorium on development of
lab and office space in the Alewife Quad until the end of 2023.
We were very involved in the Envision planning process for Alewife and the whole city. We would like to see the
Envision goals for Alewife enacted into zoning, and we think the moratorium should give you the needed time.
The 2019 Envision Alewife plan visualized the Alewife Quad as a mixed-use district, with development promoting the
creation of good-paying, low barrier-to-entry light industry jobs, additional housing, a bridge over the railroad tracks,
and a pond or water retention system and green corridor. The plan included no labs.
Low barrier-to-entry jobs will help preserve economic diversity, which in turn will help to preserve racial diversity. We
also need to ensure that a range of housing is built, as well as open space.
Let’s take the time to zone for what we want, instead of taking whatever we can get out of developers. We saw with
CCF that approach does not work. Let’s try creating zoning that follows the plan laid out by Envision.
Thanks,

due to Omicron. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/08/business/omicron-whips-through-workforce-pushingoverstretched-staffs-brink/ Taking away parking is the nail in the coffin.
The special interest bike groups have done an excellent job of developing partners in City Council and at the Cambridge DOT.
For 50 years, national and international bike groups have been pushing this bike agenda to remove parking (and cars) from
cities in favor of bike lanes. City Council needs to remember, that the rest of us don’t do this advocacy as a living, and are
already overwhelmed with our work, families and lives. So there is an unfair imbalance between the tightly coordinated
efforts of bike organizations, and the general public. Additionally, one only needs to cross out “bike” and write, any number
of other special interest groups: guns, pharma, coal, and so on, and one is forced to remember, that the public doesn’t like it
when elected officials prioritize the wishes of special interest groups. City Council is well aware that the last city poll clearly
showed that Cambridge residents (as opposed to bike special interest groups) were highly satisfied with the ease of biking in
the city, going back to 2018. City biking has significantly decreased since then, according to the State DOT website.
I cannot buy eight bags of groceries at Whole Foods in Alewife and travel with them to Violette Bakery on public
transportation. It would take at least 2 buses and I could walk faster than those bus routes take. Ironically, I personally dislike
driving. I’ve lived in European cities with good public transportation, where it is easy to jump on and off clean, modern trams
and trolleys, and ample parking is provided at the city outskirts for those who live in the suburbs/country. Cambridge has a
long way to go before getting to that level of widespread use of excellent public transportation. No one other than special
interest cyclist organizations, argue that bikes can replace cars. They cannot. Only when a robust public transportation system
that is clean, easily accessible to everyone regardless of the neighborhood, easy to enter and exit, and inexpensive, will public
transportation began to replace cars in cities. An article highlighting this was recently published in the Wall Street Journal.

I urge you to support these policy orders. And further to address the real safety issues involving bikes (lack of helmets, running
red lights, the mistaken belief that the bike has the right of way 100% of the time, etc.). The rage of residents, drivers and
walkers against cyclist is obvious on Next Door. This is what needs to be addressed. We need solutions that will dial down the
anger. The DOT quick build has only done the opposite.

comments on bike safety hearing

Hello,
I am writing to express my strong support of improved bike infrastructure in Cambridge and neighboring
community.
I am a daily bike commuter, riding between my house and Boston and job in Central Sq. I greatly appreciate
the protected bike lanes that now exist on Mass. Ave. As a very fortunate survivor of a malicious driver who
intentionally ran into me as we both traveled along Mass Ave, I know that these protected lanes save lives and
prevents serious injuries. In the context of COVID, where people are reluctant to use the subway to travel,
more commuters could take advantage of our expanded bike infrastructure.

I am writing to you again to urge you all, as I did at December 20th City Council meeting, to pass Policy Order 276
& 277 by merging them together with all the previously approved Policy Orders related to the Cycling Safety
Ordinance implementation into a single, comprehensive Policy Order and request the City Manager to conduct a
review of measures already implemented on Mass Ave from Dudley Street to Alewife Brook
Parkway independently from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department (TP&T). In addition, I urgently
request the city to convene a task force to mitigate all the negative impacts of the implementation.
Let me stress that the problem is not the protected bicycle lanes. I fully agree that the bicyclists should be
protected but so should the survivability of local businesses and safety of users of all modes of transportation
too. It is not a mutually exclusive issue but rather an inclusive one.
The negative economic impact of the implementation has been immediate and devastating as evidenced by the
statements from local business owners in Appendix 1. The environment is suffering from traffic congestion
during the rush hours. And motor vehicle accidents are mounting with the accidents on December 17, 2021 and
on January 5, 2022. Details of these two accidents, obtained from the Police Public Information Office is in
Appendix 2 and are directly attributable to the changed traffic pattern recently implemented.
I, too, had a minor skidding incident during the snowstorm of January 7, 2022 around 9 AM on my way home
from taking my friend to a doctor’s appointment. I drove down Mass Ave to Arlington line and back to see
firsthand the effect of the bike safety measures in bad weather. Mass Ave from Dudley Street to Arlington line
was totally covered with packed snow so you couldn't see any lane markings and couldn't tell where the bus
lane and the general vehicle lane were. The southbound lane was a bit better with the red bus lane paint faintly
visible. In a split-second indecision to decide whether to turn right at Cedar Street (crossing over the short,
dashed lane marking into the bus/turn lane) or go through the intersection and making a right onto Harvey (less
complicated intersection) then left onto Cedar Street, the light turned red. I must have hit the brake a tad too
hard as the car skidded left and the left front jumped the median, ending up on the median and going flat. This
experience showed me how daunting it must be for elderly or out-of-town visitors unfamiliar with the new
traffic pattern to maneuver through zig zagging and sudden lane shifts and a very short distance to switch over
lanes.
Some mitigating measures have already been installed thanks to efforts of city agencies. So, I am sure more
mitigating measures could be worked out through a joint task force of TP&T, DPW, Police and Fire Departments
while the Policy Orders go through their normal cycle of execution. DPW and TP&T changed trash pickup
schedule along affected section of Mass Ave to early afternoon to avoid creating congestion during the morning
rush hour. The loading zone regulations were clarified with small signs attached to the flexi-post clearing up a
lot of confusion. And Police Department instituted a "Directed Patrol", i.e., the traffic unit prioritized patrol, in
this area to mitigate the congestion and to educate/cite violators of the newly changed traffic regulations. But
their efforts were hampered by lack of safe but visible places to park their patrol cars and to pull over offending
drivers. I am sure these departments working together could resolve the parking issue as well.
Thank you for your considerations,
Respectfully,
Young Kim

Sandy McCullough, Joe Sent Me; Waltham / Cambridge
Joe Sent Me’s business in December was down considerably from 2020. We had much fewer holiday parties and
the ones that did continue their traditional gathering had a huge drop off in guests attending. All who I spoke to
said it was because of lack of parking and fear of being ticketed or if using a parking lot, fear of being towed. It’s
also stressful to our staff who drive from other towns from day jobs or homes. And knowing they are making
less money because of the lack of guests coming is making it difficult to retain good workers. The bike/bus lane
is having a negative snowball effect.
Misrak Gandi, Cafe Ethiopian restaurant, 2376 Mass Ave; Misrak Beauty Salon, 2370 Mass Ave; and soon to be
open Sheger Ethiopian Market, 2368 Mass Ave
I immigrated from Ethiopia in 2001 and started Misrak Beauty Salon in 2013 followed by Café Ethiopian
restaurant in 2018, managed by my sister. Due to the bike safety measures recently implemented on Mass Ave
starting in front of my stores, my business revenues decreased due to the customers not having enough parking
space while dining, picking up takeout orders or getting hair done. During the busy December holiday season,
we hardly had any customers at Café Ethiopian. I am so afraid of what will happen when our Sheger Ethiopian
Market opens later this month with inadequate parking spaces for customers to shop and load up their
purchases.
I, together with my husband and my sister and all our employees, ask you to help us continue to thrive in this
neighborhood by solving this parking issue.

December 17, 2021: Two inbound cars crashed at 10:11 AM at the corner of Mass Ave and Cottage Park Ave.
Driver 1 in a Volvo, was attempting to switch over to the left lane when the right lane she was driving on became
dedicated bus lane but was unable to do so due to traffic flowing on that lane. A bus arrived behind her and the
driver waved her over and Driver 1 assuming that meant it was safe to merge into the left lane crossed over and
collided with Vehicle 2. The Volvo ended up being totaled.
January 5, 2022, 9:58 AM: Outbound Driver 1 was making a left turn from Mass Ave towards Tyler Court.
Inbound Driver 2, saw a car stopped (presumably waiting for Vehicle 1 to make the turn), passed the stopped car
by moving into the dedicated bus lane and continued to proceed colliding with Vehicle 1. Driver 2 was cited to
traffic lane violation.

Monday January 20, 2022 – City Council - Cycling Safety Policy Orders

Monday January 20, 2022 – City Council - Cycling Safety Policy Orders - PUBLIC COMMENT
Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street - Dear Councilors –
Please register my strong support for passage of Calendar Items 1 and 2 to improve Cycling Safety in
Cambridge by enlisting the wisdom, experience and major concerns of the full range of Cambridge
residents – and voters.
A week ago tonight, you swore an oath to represent the interests of ALL residents of
Cambridge. These Policy Orders instruct the City Manager to do exactly that; they should pass
unanimously. And the Manager should take your mandate as a call to action.
We all remember the first time we rode off on a bicycle, suddenly freed from the slow pace of our
young feet. So there is a special place our hearts for bicycles and those who ride them. But there is
also a special place in our hearts for those who cannot ride at all, and those who can’t walk at all.
The average person walks at 3 miles per hour; physically-challenged walkers move at a third of
that. Imagine how a handicapped person feels crossing a street when bicycles are going by ten or
fifteen times that fast.
We can’t focus on the handicapped or we would have to reduce legal speeds drastically for all
vehicles. And if we focus on bicycles, we have to build overpasses so bicycles can move rapidly
without killing pedestrians – or themselves. The only practical solution is to plan together.

for their customers. That requires nearby loading zones, brief parking for pickups, longer parking for
restaurant customers. But those are being replaced in Cambridge by bike lanes dedicated
exclusively - 24-hours-a-day - to bicycles. We need to make room for each other. But so far, the
bicycle safety implementation is all bicycles. That’s just thoughtless planning – or no planning at
all. If the City Manager listens to the full range of Cambridge residents – and voters - the result will
be a safer and far more equitable system than the program currently being bulldozed across
Cambridge.

maintenance of over 1,700 affordable housing units through both rehab and new
construction; and

robust resident service programs; and

WHEREAS:

Peter Daly has also served on multiple boards and committees at the local, state, and
national levels, he has served as an invaluable partner to City leaders working to
preserve the affordability and socio-economic diversity of this community, and his
work has positively impacted the lives of thousands of Cambridge residents, and it

The City Council is saddened to learn of the death of Cambridge resident Janet
Axelrod, who passed away on December 26, 2021, after a long courageous battle with
cancer; and

WHEREAS:

Throughout her life of activism, caring, and impact, friends and colleagues appreciated
and valued her wise counsel, her steadfast commitment to integrity, her trenchant
analysis of issues and situations, using words like “fearless,” “supportive,” “awesome,”
“profound,” “deep,” “powerful,” and “no-nonsense” to describe her, all the while Janet
was someone who enjoyed life, invoked laughter, and greeted all with a smile; and

WHEREAS:

Janet exhibited a lifelong commitment to social justice, culminating in her service on
the Board of Grassroots International, a non-profit dedicated to funding social
movements for global change, and worked for many other social, racial, and economic
justice-oriented groups and causes; and

WHEREAS:

She was extraordinarily progressive from her first jobs, including work at the startup Lotus where she established one of the country’s first human resources policies
protecting the rights of LGBTQ employees; and

WHEREAS:

Janet also co-founded South Africa Partners, an organization dedicated to providing
equitable access to healthcare and education in South Africa, and worked at the
progressive Haymarket fund in an early foreshadowing of what became a lifelong
commitment to justice, equity, racial reckoning, economic opportunity, and disruptive
social change; and

WHEREAS:

Janet also showed tremendous service to the City of Cambridge, advising countless
organizations and working for many years on behalf of the Cambridge Public Library,
through a strategic plan, and spearheading efforts to re-invent the main library with a
major reconstruction project and eventually chairing the board; and

WHEREAS:

Janet will be sorely missed by all, especially her partner and spouse Tim Plenk who
was a stalwart activist in Cambridge Public Schools for decades; her children Eli and
Stella Plenk who carry on her spirit in their own actions to better the world and insist
on just, righteous action, her siblings; and a large network of other family, friends, and
colleagues in Cambridge and beyond (with special note of Sheboom, a drumming
group which brought Janet joy and love); now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record extending its deepest sympathy to Janet’s family

WHEREAS:

The City Council was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legal scholar, civil
rights champion, and Cambridge resident Lani Guinier on January 7, 2022 at the age of
71; and

WHEREAS:

Lani Guinier achieved so much during her lifetime, including becoming the first
woman of color appointed to a tenured professorship at the Bennett Boskey Professor
of Law at Harvard Law School, being nominated by President Bill Clinton to serve as
United States Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in 1993, and tirelessly
working to create a fairer, more equal, more inclusive country; and

WHEREAS:

The Boston Globe recently characterized Lani Guinier as “…an attorney and scholar
who envisioned creative ways to make elective politics and admission to top
universities more welcoming and inclusive,” and this succinctly captures her life’s
work and legacy, which shall continue to yield positive ripple effects for generations to
come; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

As of January 2022, the City of Cambridge continues grappling with the rapid spread
of the Covid-19 virus, and particularly with the extremely contagious strand known as
Omicron; and

WHEREAS:

While early reports suggest that the Omicron variant may be slightly milder than past
strains, and while a significant majority of Cambridge residents have received at least
one of their vaccination shots, we know that this illness could still be quite dangerous
to the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, and it is critical that every
member of this community do their part to slow the spread of this virus; and

WHEREAS:

A key part of that effort is for individuals to remain vigilant in knowing whether or not
they are infected, so that they can isolate themselves during their period of
contagiousness – yet even with the City’s efforts to increase testing options to seven
days a week, widespread reports of excessively long lines at testing locations and
difficulties making testing appointments are unquestionably hampering this process;
and

WHEREAS:

Lines of up to two hours or longer have been reported at testing locations like the
Galleria Mall and St. John’s the Evangelist Church, and particularly for seniors and
those with mobility impairments or difficulty standing, these lines can serve as a
deterrent to getting tested, leading many to abstain from testing and quite likely
continuing to unknowingly spread the infection throughout Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

Early in the pandemic’s run, many grocery stores and banks established regular
“senior’s hours” to cater to the population that was viewed as most vulnerable to the
deadliest impacts of Covid-19, and these carve outs provided opportunities for seniors
to conduct critical transactions and purchase provisions with a lowered risk of being
exposed to significant crowds, and such a model may be wise for the City to adopt for
its Covid-19 testing locations; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Chief Public Health
Officer, the Cambridge Health Alliance, and other relevant City staff to create a
“priority line” and/or establish “senior hours” at the City’s Covid-19 testing locations,
and to explore additional strategies to ensure that seniors and those with significant
mobility impairments are not forced to have waiting in hours’ long lines be their sole
option for being tested, and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely
manner.

WHEREAS:

In 1979, the City of Cambridge Community Development Department created the
Alewife Revitalization plan, intended to fill the Fresh Pond - Alewife area with a mix
of residential, business, and industrial structures (as shown in the attached graphic);
and

WHEREAS:

Forty years later, the 2019 Envision Alewife plan still visualizes Alewife as a mixeduse district, with development promoting the creation of good-paying, low barrier-toentry jobs, and additional housing with no lab uses (as shown in the attached graphic);
and

WHEREAS:

Over two years the City Council debated an up-zoning petition for part of the Quad
area that included some housing, some retail, and some office/lab space which was
voted down out of concerns that it was not aligned fully with the areawide vision as
articulated in the plans, and a commitment to connections was uncertain; and

WHEREAS:

The climate resiliency issues in this district are important, and this area is the subject of
discussions by various departments, committees and task forces, with increasing
urgency due to the rapid changes in climate leading to a need for more urgent and
aggressive actions in this flood prone area with the visions consistently showing the
need for a pond or water retention system/green corridor; and

WHEREAS:

In the past two months, Denver real estate investment firm Healthpeak Properties has
spent close to $400 million in this part of Cambridge, purchasing to date 19 separate
parcels as outlined in the attached chart; and

WHEREAS:

All of these purchases are located in the Alewife “Quad” area, where Cambridge has
planned a variety of different developments. Future purchases from HealthPeak
Properties are expected since an additional LLC, LS Alewife IV, was created and has
not yet acquired property, while LS Alewife V has; and

WHEREAS:

HealthPeak is known for owning and developing real estate mostly in the healthcare
industry, including medical offices and labs; and

WHEREAS:

The original plan for Alewife included some office space and labs, though expected a
wide variety of development; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge continues to struggle with housing affordability and availability, and
therefore housing must be an integral part of all future development; and

WHEREAS:

Long-needed public infrastructure, including pedestrian and bicycle connections
through and across the district, a rail stop for those commuting to and from the area,
publicly accessible open spaces, and urgent municipal needs such as DPW and Fire
Department facilities, remains lacking; and

WHEREAS:

City staff has not produced new zoning for the district in line with the plans, including
the recent Alewife Envision Plan; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council passed a Policy Order asking for a moratorium on development in
the Alewife Quad area on November 18, 2021, yet an Ordinance Committee meeting
was not scheduled in time to meet the legal timeline; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That Article 20.90- Alewife Overlay Districts 1-6 of the Cambridge Zoning
Ordinance be amended to insert a new section entitled Section 20.94.3- Temporarily

“No Office or Laboratory Uses as listed in Table 4.34- Office and Laboratory Use shall
be permitted within Alewife Overlay Districts 1-6 until December 31st, 2023, or until
such time as new Alewife District zoning is ordained by the Cambridge City Council,
whichever shall be sooner.
“Such new district zoning shall be created in consultation with neighborhood residents
from throughout the Alewife District and from each bordering district, including
Cambridge Highlands, North Cambridge, Neighborhood Nine, and West Cambridge.
“Specifically, such new district zoning shall be guided by the vision, goals, existing
studies, and recommendations contained in the City publications Alewife District Plan:

Despite these efforts, those being tested often have to wait in line for over 2 hours,

On Monday, January 3, the School Committee inauguration was held at 6pm and the 2022-2023
Committee members were sworn in. The School Committee this term includes the following
members: Sumbul Siddiqui (Chair), Rachel Weinstein (Vice-Chair), Akriti Bhambi, Alfred B.

congratulating the Committee.
On Tuesday, January 4, the Committee held its first meeting of the new term. The Committee
spent a large portion of the meeting discussing the Covid testing that took place on Monday
while all schools were closed. CPS had made the decision with Cambridge Public Health
Department to delay the return to school until Wednesday, January 5 for staff and student
COVID testing. The plan was to test on Monday, receive results on Tuesday, and ensure that no
one with a positive Covid test reported to school when classes resumed on Wednesday.
However, after facing extremely long lines on Monday (in sub-freezing weather), most families
did not receive all their results due to a variety of factors at the lab. Please see this statement
from me and Vice-Chair Rachel regarding the challenges learned from this experience. We will
be conducting an action review.
The CPS team sent out an email with information about the current Covid testing situation, as
well as the plan moving forward. Here is what was families received:
• The vast majority of results will not be not be available due to a variety of factors at the
lab. We are not the only district experiencing this challenge. This is incredibly
disappointing to everyone involved, especially the many families and students who
changed work and childcare plans at the last minute and stood in long lines to get tested.
The lab has taken full responsibility and, with the support of the state, are providing
additional testing teams from the National Guard to conduct rapid tests for us today.
• We prioritized the National Guard to the sites that had the largest number of students in
the positive pools, beginning with CRLS. There they tested the 123 students who were in

Monday’s positive pool samples, any close contacts identified through contact tracing
and anyone who wanted to be tested.
• The team split and then went to the next group of schools with a large number of students
in a positive pool: CSUS/KO and RAUC/Peabody. At these schools they are also testing
the students who were in Monday’s positive pool samples and any close contacts
identified through contact tracing.
• All other schools have worked to identify as many students as possible who were in a
positive pool. They are doing regular surveillance testing and testing unvaccinated close
contacts through Test and Stay.
• On Monday, we will resume our robust testing schedule of weekly testing for all students
and staff. Hundreds of additional students will be included in this plan due to the
additional consents collected on Monday.
At the meeting, we also discussed revising the quarantine policy to 5 days to 10 days with a
negative test. More details will be coming for families from Cambridge Public Health. Our next
school committee hearing will be January 18. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any
questions, suggestions, or concerns.

contacts through Test and Stay.
On Monday, we will resume our robust testing schedule of weekly testing for all students
and staff. Hundreds of additional students will be included in this plan due to the additional
consents collected on Monday.

At the meeting, we also discussed revising the quarantine policy to 5 days to 10 days with a
negative test. More details will be coming for families from Cambridge Public Health. Our next
school committee hearing will be January 18. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any
questions, suggestions, or concerns.
Respectfully,

Mayor Siddiqui

Re: Update on the City Manager Search Process
Dear Mr. Wilson:
I am submitting this letter as a late communication for inclusion on the January 10, 2022 City
Council meeting agenda. This letter is meant to inform my colleagues on the City Council and the
public that last month, Naomie Stephen, Executive Secretary to the City Council, was appointed to
serve as the City’s liaison with Randi Frank Consulting, LLC. as the process for choosing our next city
manager gets underway. Ms. Stephen and representatives of Randi Frank Consulting, LLC., shall be
looking to meet in the coming days to flesh out a timetable for determining what the next steps in this
process shall be, and I anticipate that further updates will be made in the Government Operations
committee once those discussions have taken place. I thank my colleagues for their attention to and
consideration of this matter.
Sincerely,

__________________________
