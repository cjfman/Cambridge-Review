1.1.b

•

Polity Research Consulting conducted the 2023
resident satisfaction survey from September 18 –
September 23.

•

Mix of landline and cell-phone households included
in the survey sample.

•

Random telephone survey of 400 adult residents.

•

Margin of error: ±4.90% at a 95% confidence
interval; that is, when conducting 100 such surveys,
95 of them will yield results that fall—at worst—4.9
points on either side of a given percentage.

•

Sample represents the Cambridge adult population,
but does not perfectly match all demographic
segments as we only balance on gender.

•

31 questions were benchmarked with the
Polco/National Research Center database of
comparative resident opinion surveys from over 500
communities nationwide.

The second type of question asked the respondents directly for their opinion about a decision the city will need to make,
namely should the street cleaning pilot continue.
As you may know, the City implemented a street cleaning pilot program that replaced towing associated with
street cleaning with a $50 fine. Thinking about the current level of cleanliness of our streets, do you favor or
oppose this pilot program becoming permanent?

2023 marked a significant transition for our survey program as we move to an annual survey format, allowing us to stay
more closely attuned to evolving community dynamics.

•

Moving forward, we will continue to refine
our questions for more actionable insights
and to better align with emerging issues
and priorities within Cambridge.

•

The rating for “overall City government
performance” in the 2023 survey fed into
the City Manager’s annual performance
review and the survey results can provide
valuable input for the City Council’s goal
setting.

•

The City’s survey program aims to
capture insights from randomly selected
residents, offering valuable perspectives
from our community.
