COUNCILLOR AZEEM
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

The Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) has so far generated a healthy pipeline of six
projects since it was first ordained in 2020; and

WHEREAS:

Though there is much to celebrate about the work that has been done, two years of
implementation have also revealed that the somewhat inflexible dimensional
requirements of the AHO have proven to be more of an obstacle than expected; and

WHEREAS:

The recent annual report revealed ten instances where affordable housing providers
“decided not to pursue” and four instances where they actually made an offer but it was
rejected; and

WHEREAS:

The proposal to build 49 affordable units at 2072 Mass Ave was not able to take
advantage of the AHO and was withdrawn in August 2021 after it became apparent
that a feasible version of the project wouldn’t be approved under 40B; and

WHEREAS:

It is clear that some refinements to the AHO would result in more new affordable
housing and fewer missed or stalled opportunities; and

WHEREAS:

Offering substantially relaxed dimensional requirements on a citywide network of
corridors and squares will allow more projects to advance, especially considering the
recent linkage fee increase; and

WHEREAS:

Permitting additional height when green area open space is protected or expanded will
add flexibility and expand options around providing such space without sacrificing any
affordable housing production; and

WHEREAS:

The active affordable housing developers in Cambridge are in agreement that these
changes will make a big difference; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council refer the attached zoning petition to the Housing and
Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration
Committees

the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement, or may be reduced
to the average of the front yard setbacks of the four (4) nearest pre-existing principal buildings
that contain at least two Stories Above Grade and directly front the same side of the street as the
AHO Project, or may be reduced to a minimum of ten (10) feet in the case of an AHO Project on
a corner lot. Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth different requirements for
residential and non-residential uses, the non-residential front yard setback requirement shall apply
to the entire AHO Project if the Ground Story contains a non-residential use as set forth
in Section 11.207.4 Paragraph (b) above; otherwise, the residential front yard setback shall
apply.no minimum front yard setback requirement.
(c) Side Yards. An AHO Project shall have a minimum side yard setback of seven and one-half (7.5)

derived by formula if it is less restrictive. For all other AHO projects, no minimum rear yard
setback is required.
(e) Projecting eaves, chimneys, bay windows, balconies, open fire escapes and like projections which
do not project more than three and one-half (3.5) feet from the principal exterior wall plane, and
unenclosed steps, unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet
beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above Grade, may
extend beyond the minimum yard setback.
(f) Bicycle parking spaces, whether short-term or long-term, and appurtenant structures such as
coverings, sheds, or storage lockers may be located within a required yard setback but no closer
than seven and one-half (7.5) feet to an existing principal residential structure on an abutting lot.
11.207.5.2.4 Open Space
(a) Except where the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement or as
otherwise provided below, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area for an AHO Project
shall be thirty percent (30%). However, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area may be

(b)

(c)
(d)

(e)

(f)

reduced to no less than fifteen percent (15%) if the AHO Project includes the preservation and
protection of an existing building included on the State Register of Historic Places.
The required open space shall be considered Private Open Space but shall be subject to the
limitations set forth below and shall not be subject to the dimensional and other limitations set forth
in Section 5.22 of this Zoning Ordinance. Private Open Space shall exclude parking and driveways
for automobiles.

accessible to all occupants of the building.
For the purpose of this Affordable Housing Overlay, area used for covered or uncovered bicycle
parking spaces that are not contained within a building shall be considered Private Open Space.
In any AHO project where pre-existing contiguous Green Area Open Space will be preserved
and/or expanded, or new Green Area Open Space will be created, in excess of what would
otherwise be required for the project, including through consolidation and/or relocation of some
portion of the Green Area Open Space to another part of the lot, without reducing the size of any
contiguous portion, the project may exceed the applicable height limit without restriction,
provided that the maximum possible FAR for the lot shall not be exceeded. If the AHO project is
not subject to an FAR restriction, the effective FAR not to be exceeded under this provision shall
be calculated using the dimensional requirements that apply to the AHO project, including the
original height restriction and open space requirements.

Space as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
The required open space shall be located at Grade or on porches and decks that are no higher than the
floor elevation of the lowest Story Above Grade, except that up to twenty five percent (25%) of the
required open space may be located at higher levels, such as balconies and decks, only if it is
accessible to all occupants of the building.
For the purpose of this Affordable Housing Overlay, area used for covered or uncovered bicycle
parking spaces that are not contained within a building shall be considered Private Open Space.
In any AHO project where pre-existing contiguous Green Area Open Space will be preserved
and/or expanded, or new Green Area Open Space will be created, in excess of what would
otherwise be required for the project, including through consolidation and/or relocation of some
portion of the Green Area Open Space to another part of the lot, without reducing the size of any
contiguous portion, the project may exceed the applicable height limit without restriction,
provided that the maximum possible FAR for the lot shall not be exceeded. If the AHO project is
not subject to an FAR restriction, the effective FAR not to be exceeded under this provision shall
be calculated using the dimensional requirements that apply to the AHO project, including the
original height restriction and open space requirements.

Supplemental Information Regarding Proposed Affordable Housing
Overlay Amendments

Deputy Director
Chief Planner

The Community Development Department (CDD) has put together the following
information in response to questions raised during recent discussions of the
Housing Committee on the proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing
Overlay (“AHO”) zoning.
1) What is the justification or documented developers’ need for 13-25 story
building heights?
[Alternate question]: What is the need for the height and density in the
proposed amendments? Based on the examples given of recent projects
in previous meetings, the need seems to be for the flexibility for several
additional feet or at the most 1-2 floors, and some open space issues
which is inconsistent with the amendments requested.
The proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay initiated from a
Council zoning petition. This question relates more to the Petitioners’ intent, and
we would not be able to speak to it directly; however, developers of affordable
housing may provide additional information related to development and cost
constraints that may necessitate a taller building in specific areas of the City.
In the initial AHO proposal, staff did not specifically study building heights over
seven (7) stories, but the AHO is designed to accommodate taller heights if the
underlying zoning permits it.
2) What is the current total available financing for Affordable Housing from
all sources?
The Affordable Housing Trust Fund (AHTF) began FY23 with a balance of
$111,778,914. In FY23, the AHTF has received $5,040,627 in Incentive Zoning
Contributions and $38,705,750 in funds from the FY23 City budget and

1

Community Development Department

Community Preservation Act funding, bringing the total amount to $155,525,291
available in FY23.
Of this balance, approximately $2 million has been expended as of December 31,
2022. An additional $99 million is committed to current affordable housing
developments and programs. These include several developments where
construction is now or will soon be underway, including 116 Norfolk Street
(CHA), Jefferson Park (CHA), 52 New Street (JAS), 49 Sixth Street (POAH) and 35
Harvey Street (HRI). This also includes funds committed to the City’s
HomeBridge and other homeownership programs.
Additionally CDD is currently reviewing requests for more than $34 million for
funding from the AHTF, and also anticipates requests of approximately $75
million for funding needed to complete financing for:
• Sites in the development pipeline, including 1627 Mass. Ave (HRI), Rindge
Commons Phase 2 (JAS), and 35 Cherry Street; and
• New development opportunities where affordable housing providers are
now making offers.

3) How is a developer paid for developing Affordable Housing? (i.e. Base Fee +
fee per unit?)
Affordable housing builders are paid fees through their developments.
Developer fee and developer overhead, are capped by affordable housing
funders, most often by formula based on overall costs.
Developer fees, including overhead, for affordable housing developments in
Cambridge range between 6%-9% of total development costs, or roughly
$35,000 to $45,000 per unit.
The amount fee and overhead actually received by affordable housing
developers in Cambridge during a development is often lower than what might
be allowed by funders, as affordable housing developers often defer or forgo
altogether a portion of their “allowed” developer fee in order to reduce
development costs.
The amount of developer fee collected by affordable housing builders (including
overhead but excluding any amounts deferred), has averaged around 6.3% of
total costs in recent years, and has been as low as 2-4% of total development
costs, or $15,000-25,000 per unit.
4) What is the average cost per unit of affordable housing, and the range
among projects?
Cost per unit varies depending on the type and complexity of the housing
development project, and on external factors such as interest rates, and costs for
material and labor.
A development with a large number of family-sized units will be more expensive
on a per-unit basis than a comparably sized building with a greater number of
smaller units. In recent years, the average total development cost (TDC) per-unit
in Cambridge has been in the low to mid $600,000s, with some outliers.
For instance, the TDC per-unit at the Finch building at 675 Concord Avenue and
for new units at SquirrelWood on Market Steet and Broadway in the Port were in
the $500,000s, while more recently the redevelopment of Jefferson Park State
will be more than $900,000. In recent years, costs have been increasing due to
significant increases in labor and materials and more recently increases in
borrowing and financing costs. We would expect the per-unit TDC for new
developments getting underway now to range from the low/mid $600,000s into
the $700,000s and possibly higher for developments with unique attributes such

as high acquisition costs for sites in more expensive areas of the city, and
developments which involve expensive historic preservation or the inclusion of
expensive amenities.

5) Are mixed-use projects eligible for the AHO? (For example Rindge
Commons, a 40B)
The AHO standards are primarily for residential uses, but there is an allowance
for affordable housing developments to have non-residential uses at the ground
floor, as long as the non-residential uses are allowed under the base zoning. This
is the current zoning text:
11.207.4 Use
(a) In all zoning districts, an AHO Project may contain single-family, twofamily, townhouse, or multifamily dwellings as-of-right. Townhouse
and Multifamily Special Permit procedures shall not apply.
(b) An AHO Project may contain active non-residential uses on the ground
floor as they may be permitted as-of-right in the base zoning district or
the overlay district(s) that are applicable to a lot, which for the
purpose of this Section shall be limited to Institutional Uses listed in
Section 4.33, Office Uses listed in Section 4.34 Paragraphs a. through
e., and Retail and Consumer Service uses listed in Section 4.35 that
provide services to the general public.

6) What is the status of the Walden 2 project? (Developer has paused activity
for a year)
Winn Residential proposed an AHO development to add approximately a
hundred units of infill housing at the Walden Square complex. They held several
meetings with staff and the community to discuss the proposal, with their last
community meeting in February 2022.
We understand that Winn has spent the last year working to address issues and
make improvements to the existing housing at Walden Square, and that Winn
plans to restart the planning process for Walden Square II to create new
affordable housing at the site. Given the time that has passed since the last AHO
community meeting over a year ago, Winn will restart that process with a new
set of community meetings.
7) Should the AHO revision include a provision for flood zones, where if you
have to raise the bottom floor by 5ft due to flood regulations, you can

a

extend the upper limit of the building by the same amount? (would help
New Street)
The Climate Resilience Zoning Amendment adopted by the City Council on
February 27, 2023, contains a provision to allow an as-of-right increase in height
when the ground story of a building is raised to provide greater resilience from
predicted future flooding, based on the City’s projections. The increase in height
is equal to the distance between the site grade and the ground floor, with a
maximum increase of 4 feet. The rationale for the 4-foot limitation is to provide
flexibility without effectively increasing the number of stories above grade that
can be built.
This provision applies to all buildings, including AHO developments. This is the
current zoning text:
5.23.2 If the Ground Story of a building is elevated to meet the Flood Resilience
Standards in Section 22.80 of this Zoning Ordinance, then the allowed
height of buildings and structures as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance
may be increased as-of-right to compensate for the difference between
the Ground Story finished floor elevation and the Grade elevation.
However, the allowed increase in height shall be no greater than the
difference in elevation between the 1%-Probability Long-Term Flood
Elevation as described in Section 22.80 and the Grade, or four (4) feet,
whichever is less. The City Engineer shall certify that the Flood Resilience
Standards in Section 22.80 are met prior to issuance of a building permit
for a building or structure utilizing the provisions of this Section 5.23.2.

8) What are the costs per unit of market rate housing over the last five
years and how does that compare to AHO projects?
We do not have access to information about the total cost of creating
market housing units as market-rate developers do not typically share
cost data publicly. We can say that most affordable housing
developments involve use of funding from multiple public sources
including local, state and federal agencies. Each funding source has its
own constraints and requirements, which can add cost and complexity.
Market-rate developers may also have other costs for materials, finishes,
and amenity space which differ from affordable housing buildings.
9) What are the costs per unit for construction based on number of stories?
There is not a simple way to estimate the per unit cost per number of stories as
there are many variables at play, but we can outline how we expect different
5

Attachment: Housing Committee Memo_ AHO Amendments Questions_20230412 (COF 2023 #67 : Supplemental Information Regarding

a

types of costs to interact as building heights change. Unit size will have an
impact on unit cost, as three-bedroom units have more floor area, and are thus
more expensive than one-bedroom units. Construction type will also affect cost.
The components which make up most of the cost of an affordable unit are:
acquisition costs, soft costs and fees, and construction costs. Acquisition is a
fixed cost so the addition of more stories will reduce the cost per-unit as the
fixed acquisition cost is spread across more floor area and units. The impact of
more stories on soft costs and hard costs is more complicated as some soft costs
are fixed and some are not, such as design, engineering, permits, borrowing
costs, etc. The extent to which an increase of economies of scale offsets other
increases in soft costs will depend on the specific attributes of the project.
Construction costs are also site-specific and will vary based on factors such as
site constraints and the size, shape and efficiency of the building’s floorplate, as
well as construction method. Holding site characteristics constant, we would
expect a comparison of the per square foot construction cost across different
heights to follow a curve whereby a building becomes more cost-efficient as the
design maximizes the advantages and economies of scale which different
construction techniques can provide. For example, the incremental cost of
triggering a more expensive construction method might be cost prohibitive until
enough additional floor area is achieved to average the higher cost over enough
floor area to provide a benefit. Examples include going from all wood-frame to
wood-frame over steel podium where 7 stories may be more cost effective than
5-6 stories, to going from wood-over-steel to light gauge steel where 10-11
stories may be more cost effective than 8-9 stories, and to all steel buildings
where 16 or more stories may be more cost-feasible than 12-15 stories.

10) What is the capacity in a sample of 3-5 parcels along a major corridor if
built to 6 or 8 stories? I know we can’t do the capacity of the whole length
of corridors, but to assess a few would give us all a sense of what is
possible.
The Petition refers to a “Major Corridor” as Albany Street, Alewife Brook
Parkway, Bishop Allen Drive, Broadway, Cambridge Street, Concord Avenue, First
Street, Fresh Pond Parkway, Massachusetts Avenue, Memorial Drive, Mount
Auburn Street, Prospect Street, and Sidney Street.

a

Many of these corridors run from one side of the City to the other, and consist of
hundreds of parcels. These corridors also consist of multiple zoning districts –
sometimes as many as ten or more districts in a single corridor – that each have
unique dimensional standards. One challenge here is how to determine what
might be considered a representative parcel in a corridor given how diverse the
corridors are.
The City has previously utilized 3D modeling to illustrate the potential build-out
of representative parcels as part of a zoning change under consideration. In this
case, similar modeling could be done but would require additional time and
discussion so that there is a clear understanding of what staff might produce that
would be helpful to the Committee.
11) What are the most recent and complete information on wait lists? The
numbers cited were at odds with a CDD presentation from a few years ago,
which showed about 1500 people living in Cambridge on housing waitlists.
[Alternate Question]: What is the most accurate waiting list
information? The waitlist should indicate the number of people on
waitlists who live in Cambridge, those who work in Cambridge (not
double counting – so only those who work and are not already included
in the live in Cambridge list). Also, of those who [work] in Cambridge
where they are currently living.
[Alternate Question #2]: For the waitlists, there should be a waitlist for
inclusionary, and for other affordable housing – and if people are on
both, that should be noted – so we know how many unique individuals
are on each list. Also, confirm if waitlists are individuals or households –
meaning if a family of three people is on the waitlist, that is 3 not 1
person, correct? Which means it would be helpful to know the number
of households on the waitlists.
Wait list information cited most frequently comes from the Cambridge Housing
Authority. CHA maintains wait lists for CHA-owned housing as well as CHA
housing voucher programs. Many affordable units in all-affordable buildings
owned by non-profit and private affordable housing providers are accessed via
CHA’s wait list for vouchers.
CHA regularly provides information about unduplicated applicants across all its
waiting lists. The most recent data wait list data CHA has shared show that there

7
Packet Pg. 24

Attachment: Housing Committee Memo_ AHO Amendments Questions_20230412 (COF 2023 #67 : Supplemental Information Regarding

a

are 22,537 unduplicated households on CHA wait lists. Of these, 6,501
applicants have CHA’s local preference, which gives priority to applicants who:
1. live in Cambridge; or
2. work in Cambridge; or
3. are veterans.
Separately, CDD maintains waiting pools for inclusionary rental housing. There
are currently 3,772 total unduplicated households who have applied for
inclusionary rental housing, including 1,283 applicants who live in Cambridge,
and an additional 461 applicants who work but do not reside in Cambridge.
Almost half of non-resident Cambridge workers in the inclusionary rental waiting
pool live in Boston (149) or Somerville (60).
This combined total of 1,744 inclusionary rental housing applicants who live or
work in Cambridge compares to CHA’s 6,501 applicants with CHA’s local
preference.
CHA’s wait list numbers are most frequently referenced as CHA programs include
applicants across all CHA programs including applicants seeking housing
vouchers and to be housed in affordable units in all-affordable buildings.
Both CHA and CDD maintain distinct applicant pools. We would expect that
there is some overlap between rental applicants but cannot say to what extent.
We cannot fully analyze overlap due to limitation in sharing personally
identifiable information about applicants.
Other non-profit and private affordable housing providers also may have
separate and distinct wait lists for their buildings. However, as noted above,
many units in all-affordable buildings are accessed through CHA.
Wait list data reflects applicant households, not individual household members.

What are unit costs as you go taller?
At greater heights builders change to different building codes and
construction becomes more expensive, but the land cost is divided by
more units and so total unit costs still go down.
CDD Statement: “Examples include going from all wood-frame to
wood-frame over steel podium where 7 stories may be more cost
effective than 5-6 stories, to going from wood-over-steel to light gauge
steel where 10-11 stories may be more cost effective than 8-9 stories,
