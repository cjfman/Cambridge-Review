December 7, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am forwarding for your consideration a Home Rule Petition seeking special legislation from the
Legislature which would authorize the City of Cambridge to provide police, fire and other
emergency services (“Emergency Services”) to portions of the Cambridge Crossing project that
are partially located in the cities of Boston and Somerville, with one such property wholly
located within Somerville. As you know, Cambridge Crossing is a large mixed-use project
situated on over 45 acres of land located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston and Somerville, and
containing residential, office, laboratory and retail uses (the “Project”). Portions of the Project
are not accessible by streets located in either Boston or Somerville and are only accessible by
emergency responders by streets located in the City of Cambridge.
The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts generally prohibit municipalities from
providing emergency services to properties located outside of their municipal boundaries. While
there are certain exceptions for instances of mutual aid, the municipality in which a specific
parcel of real estate is located is generally responsible for the provision of police, fire and other
emergency services to such parcels and the buildings located on the parcels and the occupants of
those buildings.
In addition, Massachusetts law prevents municipalities from assessing taxes or other municipal
charges against properties not situated within its municipal boundaries. Therefore, the special
legislation that is enclosed here also would authorize the City to impose fees on the owner of any
parcel located within the Project for the provision of these Emergency Services.

EMERGENCY AND OTHER MUNICIPAL SERVICES TO CERTAIN PROPERTIES IN
THE CITY OF SOMERVILLE AND THE CITY OF BOSTON.
Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the City of Cambridge is
hereby authorized to provide police, fire and other services and the City of Somerville and the
City of Boston are authorized to acquiesce in the delegation of such services to the City of
Cambridge relative to the certain identified portions of the City of Somerville and the City of
Boston and to take such other actions as are provided for in this Act.
SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
WHEREAS, Cambridge Crossing (also known as North Point) is a mixed-use, smart
growth master plan development containing 20 separate and distinct building parcels and
comprised of approximately 45.37 acres of land, situated in the Cities of Cambridge, Boston and
Somerville (the “Development”) or (“Cambridge Crossing”); and
WHEREAS, the majority of the Development, (approximately 38.77 acres), is situated in
the City of Cambridge, with the balance of the land located in the City of Boston, (1.29 acres),
and the City of Somerville, (5.28 acres), with the majority of the buildings constructed or to be
constructed (with the exception of one building which is wholly situated in the City of
Somerville) to be located in whole or in part in the City of Cambridge (collectively, the
“Serviced Parcels”, and each individually, a “Serviced Parcel”); and
WHEREAS, emergency access to the Serviced Parcels is only feasible by public ways
situated in the City of Cambridge and the City of Cambridge will be providing the water, sewer
and other municipal services to the entirety of Cambridge Crossing and neither the City of
Boston nor the City of Somerville will be providing those municipal services to Cambridge
Crossing; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement between the City of
Cambridge and the current owner of the Cambridge Crossing, the roadway network and
municipal infrastructure being (or to be) constructed therein by the current owner, will be
conveyed to the City of Cambridge and become part of the City of Cambridge municipal system;
and
WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston each desire to enter into
agreements with one another to have the City of Cambridge (i) provide police, fire and other
emergency services, including but not limited to, emergency communication and ambulance
services (“Emergency Services”), and (ii) offer and provide such other municipal services to the
Serviced Parcels as may be reasonably required and/or requested from time to time as a result of
the Serviced Parcels being accessible solely from roadways situated in the City of Cambridge
and the utilities owned, or to be owned, by the City of Cambridge located therein, including,
without limitation, the provision of water, storm sewer and sanitary sewer (and the ability to
charge normal and customary fees associated therewith) and services provided by the fire
department (such services, “Other Municipal Services”); and

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston agree that having
Cambridge provide the above services to the entirety of Cambridge Crossing will enable
increased efficiency in, and the expeditious delivery of, public safety responses; and
WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston agree that the City of
Cambridge requires the authority to assess any unpaid fees for Emergency Services to a Serviced
Parcel. Specifically, the Cities seek authority to allow the City of Cambridge to (a) assess any
unpaid fees for these services that are attributable to (i) a Serviced Parcel situated partially in the
City of Cambridge to the real estate tax bills of such Serviced Parcel issued by the City of
Cambridge and (ii) the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of Somerville against tax
parcels located in the City of Cambridge containing only the common open space areas of
Cambridge Crossing, but not any tax parcels containing occupiable buildings (collectively, the
“CX Open Space Parcels”), and to issue a real estate tax bill to such assessing parcel(s), and (b)
make such assessments, pursuant to its assessment and collection authority contained in Chapters
59 and 60 of the Massachusetts General Laws.
THEREFORE, the purposes of this Act are to:
1. authorize the City of Cambridge (a) to provide Emergency Services within the
Serviced Parcels as if such parcels were entirely situated within the City of
Cambridge; (b) to make assessments against any Serviced Parcel to reimburse the
City of Cambridge for the provision of such services to such Serviced Parcel, against
only the portion of such Serviced Parcel situated in the City of Cambridge; (c) to
make assessments against the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of
Somerville to reimburse the City of Cambridge for the provisions of such services to
such Serviced Parcel, against one or more of the CX Open Space Parcels; (d) to
collect and enforce, including, without limitation, the rights to pursue takings for nonpayment of such assessments allocable to (i) a Serviced Parcel, against the owner of
such Serviced Parcel, or (ii) in the event of the Serviced Parcel situated entirely
within the City of Somerville, against the owner(s) of the CX Open Space Parcels;
and (d) to offer and provide the Other Municipal Services as if the same were situated
entirety within the City of Cambridge; and
2. authorize the City of Somerville and the City of Boston to delegate the Emergency
Services and Other Municipal Services related to the Serviced Parcels to the City of
Cambridge.
SECTION 2. The City of Cambridge is hereby authorized to provide the Emergency
Services to the Serviced Parcels, specifically including, but not limited to, authorizing
Cambridge Police Officers with full arrest powers, as if those parcels were wholly located in the
City of Cambridge.
SECTION 3. The City of Cambridge shall have the right to provide such Other
Municipal Services as are reasonably necessary to be provided to the Serviced Parcels and as are
otherwise agreed to with any other municipality in which a particular Serviced Parcel may be
located.

Re:

Awaiting Report 20-12 dated February 10, 2020 regarding feasibility of adding bike
parking rings to parking meters.

Date:

December 2, 2020

This response addresses the request to examine the feasibility of adding bike parking rings to
automobile parking meter poles in order to increase the availability of bike parking without
having to add stand-alone bike parking infrastructure.
The demand for bike parking continues to rise as the city grows and more people are
choosing to bike. The City of Cambridge allocates funds in its capital budget to install up to
150 new post and ring bike racks each year, in addition to providing some larger bike shelters
at public facilities and providing seasonal bike parking corrals in priority locations in place of
car parking spots. The racks and corrals are placed in places of high demand for bike parking,
such as in the city’s main squares, along retail corridors and near educational facilities and
high-density housing districts. Racks are also installed upon request from residents or
business owners. New development projects are required to provide bike parking on their
property not only for employees but also short-term visitor parking, which adds significant
numbers of new bike parking spaces throughout the city each year. In combination, these
different approaches to increase the availability of bike parking in the city each year are
intended to address the growing demand.
We recommend not adding bike parking rings to active automobile parking meter poles for
several reasons. First, meters are placed closer to the curb than the typical standard for bike
racks. This could mean, if one or more bikes are parked at a rack, that vehicles would end up
being parked further away from the curb, intruding into bike or travel lanes and reducing
overall travel safety. In addition, accessing the meters to empty the coin compartment and
service the meters could become more difficult. A larger bike, a badly parked bike, or a
tipped over bike would impede the collection of coins or maintenance of the parking
meter. However, there are some “orphaned” meter poles where curbside parking has been
removed to install bike lanes for other reasons. These poles might be good candidates for
attaching rings as they do not affect how cars would park or coin collection/meter
servicing. These empty poles will be examined and bike parking rings, or replacement racks,

December 7, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-134, regarding increasing funding to the City's
HomeBridge program, Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq reports the
following:

The City has worked with the Affordable Housing Trust to plan for expanding the HomeBridge
program to serve homebuyers earning between 100% and 120% of area median income (AMI).
The Affordable Housing Trust recently approved changes which will allow for this program
expansion.
HomeBridge is a component of the City’s homebuyer assistance programs which offers direct
funding to homebuyers purchasing homes on the market. Through HomeBridge, the City
provides buyers with between 40% and 50% of their home purchase price. HomeBridge, and
similar prior assistance programs, have been funded by the Trust with Community Preservation
Act (CPA) funds. CPA funds can be used to assist households whose incomes are less than
100% AMI. Homes purchased with HomeBridge funding become part of the City’s stock of
deed-restricted affordable housing.
At its meeting on November 19th, the Trust approved measures needed to expand HomeBridge to
households earning up to 120% AMI. The Trust also approved $3 million in funding for
households earning between 100% and 120% AMI, which is expected to serve at least 8 to 10
homebuyers. CDD is now planning for the launch of this new program component which is
expected to be available in January.

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of Federal CARES Act funds in the amount of
$1,256,118 to the Public Investment Fund Community Development Department Extraordinary
Expenditures account.
This is the second round of funding that the City has received through The Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act; a law intended to address the
economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The City plans on using the
funds to assist residents and small business owners who are impacted by the virus, and to support
emergency housing assistance efforts.
Half of the funding ($628,059) will support the Small Business Relief Grants program. Funding
will provide short term financial assistance to approximately 100 eligible businesses impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic. The program provides grants of up to $6,000 and may be used for
commercial mortgage/rent, inventory, payroll, or purchase of Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE).
The other half of funding ($628,059) will support the continuation of the City of Cambridge
COVID-19 Housing Stabilization program which provides up to 6 months of housing assistance
to eligible Cambridge residents. These additional dollars will support approximately 150
households who have not already received 6 months of assistance through this program.

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall
13.201
Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use

among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the Broad
Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and
future open space west of Third Street; and to provide unique community
benefits through community arts and public gathering spaces. The PUDCDK District creates incentives to (A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and
culture facility within the district that will further diversify the mix of
uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade
utility and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station
on Third Street to enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street
and provide an attractive connector corridor between the district and the
East Cambridge neighborhood. The parcel on which the existing gas

Transfer Station Parcel; or otherwise enhances ground floor connectivity
to open space areas proximately located to the Development Parcel (e.g.,
Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, or the Broad Canal)
by use of publicly accessible interior ground floor areas or spaces if the
Development Parcel does not include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel.
(g) Fostering a spirit of inclusiveness and diversity, particularly
in the planning and programming of the publicly accessible ground floor
elements, community gathering and other open spaces, to draw users and
visitors from across the city.
(h) Demonstrates a commitment to seeking high quality, locallybased retail and restaurant owners or operators where such uses are part
of the Final Development Plan, and promotes collaboration between any
retail component and the Arts and Culture Uses that are part of the Final
Development Plan, taking into consideration to the extent feasible
applicable components of the Arts Task Force Recommendations with
respect to the Arts and Culture Uses.
(i) Sensitively interfacing with adjacent land uses with respect to
use scale, density, setback, bulk, height, landscaping, and screening,
while providing integrated pedestrian circulations systems with
particularly strong linkages between Broad Canal, Third Street, and
Termeer Square.

constitute a violation with respect to any other individual PUD-CDK lot
or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A PUD-CDK special
permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final Development
Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall be
considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning
Ordinance subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the
developer demonstrates that such modification(s): (i) constitute a
reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross Floor Area among uses in the
Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the PUD-CDK District,
(ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the categories
of relief previously granted for the proposed development project,

Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements
within the PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in
approving a Final Development Plan may specify a minimum parking
requirement based on review and analysis of Transportation Impact
Studies and other relevant information on parking demand provided in
application documents, and with the guidance of City agencies.
13.205.2.2
Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a Development Parcel
within the PUD-CDK District shall be limited by applying the rates set
forth below to each use within a Development Parcel subject to PUDCDK and taking the summation of the result for all uses. For any use not
listed below, the maximum parking ratio set forth in Article 6.000, to the
extent provided, shall apply. Exceeding the maximum allowed parking
shall require a waiver of maximum parking required under the general
provisions of Article 6.000.
i.
Maximum of 0.8 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor
Area for office and laboratory uses.
ii.
Maximum of 0.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor

Development Plan.
Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to
Development Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK
District.
Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s)
shall remain valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with
respect to, all remaining land of the PUD-3 District outside of a
Development Parcel, including without limitation with respect to a
rebuilding due to casualty, provided that the terms of such PUD-3 special
permit(s) shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any
rights granted to a Development Parcel pursuant to a PUD-CDK special
permit. For the avoidance of doubt and subject to this Section 13.206.1,
the Planning Board shall administer the applicable PUD special permits
in accordance with the applicable PUD overlay zoning provision that
govern such special permits (e.g., PUD-3 or PUD-CDK, as the case may
be).
Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit to a Development
Parcel shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD3 special permit to that Development Parcel, and the PUD-CDK zoning
shall govern with respect to such additional rights. A PUD-CDK special
permit application may request that the Planning Board simultaneously
issue a minor amendment to any special permit under PUD-3 covering
such Development Parcel, including to establish that the Development
Parcel is no longer subject to such special permit, so long as such minor
amendment does not alter the remainder of the development that is
subject to such special permit under PUD-3.
To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued
prior to the issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted
hereunder and the provisions of such existing approval(s) conflict or are
inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special permit, the provisions of the
PUD-CDK special permit shall govern.
Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District
shall comply with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section
22.20 of this Zoning Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain
documentation showing how the development at an aggregate level will
comply with the requirements of Section 22.20. The conditions of a PUD
special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the requirements of
Section 22.20.
The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development
Proposal shall describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will
incorporate a comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best
practices for meeting sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero
Action Plan, Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and
other sustainability plans and guidelines promulgated by the City at the
Packet Pg. 72

2.3

time the Development Proposal is submitted. The conditions of a PUD
special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be reviewed as
part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings
shall incorporate best practices in the following areas:
(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve
building energy and, to the extent practicable, reduce
carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new building within
the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for
implementation of net zero ready measures and on-site energy
generation (which may include rooftop solar pv) within the
PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a
greenhouse gas emissions analysis for such new building and
will implement energy efficiency mitigation for such building to
achieve the maximum energy reductions possible identified in
such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial
building shall include a study, prepared by the developer,
considering the feasibility of connecting the proposed building to
the existing district steam system, if available.
(b) Urban Site and Landscaping; Water Management. The
developer of a new building must explore opportunities for
potable water use reductions and the ability to enhance
indigenous plantings in and around the development site.
(c) Cool Roofs. All new buildings approved in the PUD-CDK
District must employ Functional Green Roofs (as such term is
defined in Article 22.000 of this Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo
“white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing system.
(d) Monitoring. All new buildings in the PUD-CDK District
shall be required to conform to the requirements of the
Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance, Chapter
8.67 of the Municipal Code.
(e) Healthy Living and Working. All new buildings in the PUDCDK District shall provide people with access to daylight and
enhance the visual and thermal comfort of people living within
the PUD-CDK District.
(f) Transportation. A Final Development Plan within the PUDCDK District shall encourage multimodal transportation, provide
facilities for cyclists and provide an infrastructure to support
alternative energy vehicles.
(g) Flood Resiliency. All new buildings must incorporate the
City of Cambridge’s most up-to-date standards to address
projected future flooding impacts.
(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the
PUD-CDK District shall incorporate measures to reduce urban
heat island effects and identify interior and exterior spaces in
designated locations to act as cooling areas.
13.206.3
Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment date ____________
by _____________ is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the Cambridge
Zoning Ordinance and shall be binding upon ______________ and its successors and
assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of Commitment are inconsistent with
the provisions of this Section 13.200, the more stringent provisions shall govern.

Re: Re-Submission of Zoning Amendment Petition
Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey,
and Zondervan:
On behalf of BMR-Third LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., we are pleased to resubmit for your review the enclosed rezoning petition for a proposed amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance and the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, which, upon adoption, would result in
a new Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District CDK. As you know, on March 11, 2020 we
submitted the enclosed rezoning petition to the City Clerk, and the City Council referred the
rezoning petition to the Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee at the March 16, 2020
City Council meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Planning Board cancelled its
meetings for the months of April, May and early June, and has since re-commenced remote
meetings on June 16, 2020. Accordingly, in July we re-submitted the PUD-CDK rezoning
petition but due to certain scheduling constraints we are re-submitting the enclosed rezoning
petition. The enclosed rezoning petition is exactly the same as the March and July petitions other
than any revised dates or references to this re-submission, as the case may be.
As you know, we have worked closely with the City to see to the stewardship of what is
now branded as Canal District Kendall (formerly Kendall Square and Cambridge Research Park)
since completing the acquisition of the former Lyme Properties portfolio in 2007. Specific
stewardship projects include ongoing improvements to the public realm (including renovation of
the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the introduction of public art, improvements to the ice

2.3.a

skating rink and boat launch, a commitment to local retail, and the on-going redevelopment and
dedication of Termeer Square) and the development of 450 Kendall Street. We now come to you
with what we hope is the final step in finishing what Lyme Properties started in 1999 by
realizing on the longstanding goal of having a significant arts and culture facility in the
neighborhood. At the same time, we hope to replace the Eversource gas facility located along
Third Street to make way for an iconic architectural building that enhances the public realm and
the connections among surrounding open spaces. As you will see in the enclosed proposed
Zoning Map amendment, the new overlay district covers the portion of the Canal District
Kendall that was originally developed as Kendall Square plus the Eversource site (referred to
here as the gas transfer station site, or “GTS Site,” for ease of reference).
A. Background. We submit this petition after soliciting extensive public feedback
through community open houses, surveys, deeply engaging with the arts community, and other
means to determine what type of arts and culture facility the City wants to see at 585 Third
Street, the former Constellation Center site (also known as “Parcel C”). As you know,
Constellation acquired the site in 2002 and spent over 15 years trying to raise the capital for a
theater complex at the location. In the interim, the rest of the area within the proposed PUDCDK has been improved to now include approximately 757,970 square feet of office and
laboratory space, 75,500 square feet of retail and restaurant uses, and 465 residential units.
Unfortunately, a standalone theater proved not to be economically viable on Parcel C. We
acquired Parcel C in 2018, and have subsequently entered into an option agreement with
Eversource that creates the possibility of combining Parcel C with the abutting GTS Site. The
finite duration of the option agreement and the unique ability to relocate the GTS in
coordination with a development spanning both parcels makes this a one-in-a-generation
opportunity. We continue to work diligently on establishing a new location for the GTS facility,
and are nearer than ever to achieving our goal, but have not yet completed that effort.
We and our affiliates are the owners of abutting first class laboratory facilities that serve
as key locations for companies like Takeda, Alnylam, and Eli Lilly; the success of development
on Parcel C was and is highly important to us and our shareholders. As majority owners in the
association that manages the public realm of the Canal District Kendall, the public realm is also
essential to us and to our tenants – both biotech and retailers alike. We are convinced that we can
make a significant impact with an arts and culture facility in a way that fits into the
neighborhood, is attractive to a diverse set of Cambridge residents and visitors, enhances the
public realm, is economically viable, and otherwise furthers the development goals of the
community, while being within the guidelines of our mission as a real estate investment
company focusing on high quality life sciences space.
B. Summary of Petition. Our zoning petition memorializes the previously approved and
constructed density at each site within the proposed PUD-CDK, and allows for additional
development on Parcel C and the GTS Site to achieve the project concept described below. The
proposed amendment permits a mixed use development project that is a new building containing
an arts, culture, and public space component that complements the existing 465 apartments and
commercial space, and, as noted above, creates incentives for incorporating the GTS Site by
allowing for greater bulk and height, and public realm amenities, if the GTS Site is included. The
height and floor area, under a scenario where the GTS facility is removed from Third Street,

2.3.a

would be 250 feet and up to 550,000 gross square feet, respectively. The proposed amendment
does not grant further development potential to the existing buildings constructed within PUDCDK.
C. Project Concept. Since acquiring Parcel C, we have worked tirelessly with our
consultant team to unlock the full potential of the site. The renderings enclosed show the fruits of
our labor. To accommodate the building and concepts shown, the proposed PUD-CDK allows us
to combine Parcel C with the GTS Site and construct mixed use laboratory and office above
approximately 40,000 square feet of arts, culture, and public space, all in a striking 21st-century
building consistent with existing and other proposed building heights in the vicinity. This
building will significantly enhance the open spaces surrounding it, and will help strengthen the
pedestrian corridor that ties together Termeer Square to the north, the Broad Canal and Broad
Canal Way retail to the south, and the future Volpe Center project to the west (across Third
Street). All of this can be done in a manner that meets the sustainability practices of modern
construction and caters to a community as economically and culturally diverse as Cambridge.
Compare the renderings of our proposed project to the existing condition, also shown in
the enclosed renderings. Parcel C is the “missing tooth” in the Canal District Kendall, and the
location of the GTS Site (the last remnant of an industrial zone on Third Street) exacerbates the
problem from an urban planning perspective. We believe that the project facilitated by the
enclosed rezoning is a massive improvement, and a welcome addition, to the Cambridge
pedestrian environment.
We note that we have every intention of including the GTS Site in our proposed project.
Although the ability to move the GTS facilities is not entirely within our control, we have been
working continuously with Eversource and others to reach agreements that are necessary for the
exercise of our option to acquire the GTS Site and move its facilities to a non-residential
location. However, some details remain to be worked out and, out of an abundance of caution,
we have drafted the petition allowing for the possibility that the project might not include the
GTS Site by providing for a more limited scope of improvements utilizing only Parcel C to
advance the vision of a community arts facility on the ground floor of a mixed use building.
While not our preference because its impact would be less transformative and enriching for the
neighborhood, we believe it is a viable alternative project.
D. Benefits. Our preferred proposed project, utilizing the GTS Site, will result in many
benefits for the East Cambridge community, and the community close to PUD-CKD in
particular. Those benefits, many of which will be memorialized in a commitment letter to be
submitted to City Council, have an approximate value of at least Sixty Million Dollars
($60,000,000), and include the following:




A commitment to use reasonable efforts to relocate the existing utility facilities
from the GTS Site to a non-residential location.
An arts and culture component of 30,000 square feet, inclusive of a 250-300 seat
state-of-the-art theater, if the GTS Site is included (and, in any event, arts and
culture space of at least 15,000 square feet).
10,000 square feet of indoor all-season public space.

emissions, water, materials, urban site reuse, and landscaping.
No new gas connection.

Our proposal is the end result of many community meetings and public presentations
with neighbors, neighborhood stakeholders, and with stakeholders at City Hall, including three
open houses, multiple meetings with an Arts Advisory Committee comprised of community arts
advocates, a public survey, and solicitations for public comment on presentation boards that we
displayed at our open houses. Key takeaways from the public process included a focus on the
need for flexible performing arts spaces for small and larger productions, community arts spaces
(such as classrooms for leaming art and exhibit space), public gathering spaces available across
all four seasons, and relocating the GTS facility away from Third Street. Our proposed zoning
overlay text and map encourages achievement of these goals, with the publicly accessible
facilities within and commanding the lower levels of a unique and beautiful commercial building
that will provide over an acre of new landscaped area (indoors and outdoors), subject to further
detailed review by the Planning Board under the contemplated special permit process.
We are excited to work with you in the formal review process for the zoning amendment
and again upon submission of an application for a PUD-CDK special permit. We are committed
to East Cambridge and to doing all that we can to make Canal District Kendall a shining example
of the best of mixed-use transit-oriented development for the 21st century.

Very truly yours,

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall

13.201

Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”.

(a) If Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires a
Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, such Community Arts
Facility or Arts and Culture Center (i) takes into consideration the orientation of the
uses, location of building entrances, pedestrian connectivity between such uses and
adjacent open space areas, and the ability of such uses to promote diversity and serve
all residents of the City of Cambridge; and (ii) creates a facility available for the
neighborhood that supports or promotes small arts or theater organizations,
independent artists, art co-working opportunities, or partnerships among the
foregoing and the local community. Furthermore, the developer of such Community
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center shall have demonstrated a commitment to
establishing an arts and culture operational plan for space within the new building
that will be made available for teaching, learning, rehearsing, or idea exchange.

visible activity and publicly accessible elements within and adjacent to the ground
floor if the Development Parcel includes the Gas Transfer Station Parcel; or otherwise
enhances ground floor connectivity to the adjacent streetscape by use of publicly
accessible interior ground floor areas or spaces if the Development Parcel does not
include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel.
(d) Integrates development with new and existing open spaces physically and
functionally.
(e) Enhances the pedestrian connections among Termeer Square, the plaza
abutting the Broad Canal, the Broad Canal, and Third Street, and creates publicly
accessible interior ground floor pathways to such areas to the extent feasible if the
Development Parcel includes the Gas Transfer Station Parcel; or otherwise enhances
ground floor connectivity to open space areas proximately located to the
Development Parcel (e.g., Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, or the

Broad Canal) by use of publicly accessible interior ground floor areas or spaces if the
Development Parcel does not include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel.
(f) The developer shall have demonstrated a commitment to seeking solutions to
relocate applicable above-grade utility infrastructure on the Gas Transfer Station

Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. A violation, with respect to an
individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any
provision of this Section 13.200 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any
other individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A
PUD-CDK special permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final
Development Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall
be considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance
subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the developer demonstrates
that such modification(s): (i) constitute a reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross
Floor Area among uses in the Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the
PUD-CDK District, (ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the
categories of relief previously granted for the proposed development project, whether
by existing PUD special permits or otherwise), and (iii) maintain the same percentage
of Minimum Open Space as approved by the PUD-CDK special permit.

13.202.7

Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a development proposal for a
Development Parcel, the developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD
Pre-Application Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance.
The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site
arrangement, building massing, and public space arrangement, as well as general
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the Planning Board to
provide the developer informal feedback prior to preparing the Final Development
Plan materials. As set forth in Section 12.33.2 of this Zoning Ordinance, any
statement made by the Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application
Conference shall not be legally binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3 of this
Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall present graphic and written materials as
needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development alternatives.

13.204.5.1

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center,
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center,
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan,

13.206

Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District.

13.206.1

Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain
valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit,
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights, and any
associated outstanding obligations with respect to such rights, under a previously
issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished as of the
date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and effective, and
such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor amendment of such
previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 12.37.2 of this Zoning
Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the
issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted hereunder and the provisions of
such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special
permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit shall govern.

13.206.2

Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply
with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the
requirements of Section 22.20.
The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall
incorporate best practices in the following areas:
(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building energy
and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new
building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for implementation
of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include rooftop
solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas
emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency

mitigation for such building to achieve the maximum energy reductions possible
identified in such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial building
shall include a study, prepared by the developer, considering the feasibility of
connecting the proposed building to the existing district steam system, if available.
(b) Urban Site and Landscaping; Water Management. The developer of a new
building must explore opportunities for potable water use reductions and the ability to
enhance indigenous plantings in and around the development site.
(c) Cool Roofs. All new buildings approved in the PUD-CDK District must
employ Functional Green Roofs (as such term is defined in Article 22.000 of this
Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo “white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing
system.
(d) Monitoring. All new buildings in the PUD-CDK District shall be required to
conform to the requirements of the Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance, Chapter 8.67 of the Municipal Code.
(e) Healthy Living and Working. All new buildings in the PUD-CDK District
shall provide people with access to daylight and enhance the visual and thermal
comfort of people living within the PUD-CDK District.
(f) Transportation. A Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK District shall
encourage multimodal transportation, provide facilities for cyclists and provide an
infrastructure to support alternative energy vehicles.
(g) Flood Resiliency. All new buildings must incorporate the City of Cambridge’s
most up-to-date standards to address projected future flooding impacts.
(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK
District shall incorporate measures to reduce urban heat island effects and identify
interior and exterior spaces in designated locations to act as cooling areas.
13.206.3

Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated _________ by
____________ is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the Cambridge
Zoning Ordinance and shall be binding upon __________ and its successors and
assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of Commitment are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Section 13.200, the more stringent provisions shall govern.

WHEREAS:

The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ripple across our

VICE MAYOR MALLON
MAYOR SIDDIQUI
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

As the pandemic has caused widespread layoffs and business closures, food insecurity
has skyrocketed, with Massachusetts experiencing the highest increase in food
insecurity of any state across the country, rising from 1 in 13 Massachusetts residents
being food insecure pre-pandemic, to 1 in 7 residents currently, a 59% increase; and

WHEREAS:

Food insecurity has drastically increased within the two Congressional districts
Cambridge is a part of as well, with the Seventh Congressional District rising from
13.7% in 2018 to 18.8% in 2020, and the Fifth Congressional District rising from 6.9%
in 2018 to 12.0% in 2020; and

WHEREAS:

Food insecurity in Cambridge is currently estimated by the Greater Boston Food Bank
to be 13% of all residents, or approximately 15,000 residents; and

WHEREAS:

With community need soaring, especially around the holidays, food pantries are
struggling to keep up; and

WHEREAS:

The Greater Boston Food Bank, for example, currently distributes 2.5 million pounds
of food to 660,000 people each week, significantly more than the 1 million pounds of
food they distributed to 415,000 people each week before this public health crisis
began, and the numbers have only been growing; and

WHEREAS:

Anecdotally, food pantries in Cambridge are reporting a 10-15% increase in food
pantry usage in recent months, and use has been increasing steadily as we head into
what is likely to be another COVID-19 surge, with many unemployment benefits due
to expire on December 31, 2020; and

WHEREAS:

In order to meaningfully intervene and help fight food insecurity in our community
during this critical time, we must learn more about what our local food pantries are
experiencing and how the City can support them as they fill in this critical resource
gap; and

WHEREAS:

7,338 residents are impacted by the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program) Gap, which is the difference between the number of low-income residents
receiving MassHealth who are likely SNAP eligible and the number of people actually
receiving SNAP, creating a City-wide SNAP Gap of 46%; and

WHEREAS:

One way the City may help alleviate the skyrocketing burden on local food pantries is
by launching an educational outreach campaign to close the SNAP Gap in Cambridge
and encourage more low-income residents to take advantage of long-term, sustainable
government assistance programs; now therefore be it
Packet Pg. 262

6.3

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of
Human Service Programs, Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC),
local food pantries, and food access organizations to gain firsthand insight on what
these organizations are seeing on the ground, and to develop ways to provide increased
support for the food pantry network; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of
Human Service Programs, the Public Information Office, and other relevant City
departments to develop a comprehensive outreach campaign centered on closing the
SNAP Gap in Cambridge, and educating low-income residents on how they may
access government assistance benefits; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on this matter by the
December 21st regular City Council meeting.

WHEREAS:

Across Massachusetts and in the City, food insecurity has skyrocketed amid mass
layoffs and business closures, and 15,080 Cambridge residents, or 13% of all
Cambridge residents, are currently experiencing food-insecurity; and

WHEREAS:

Of these residents, 7,338 are impacted by the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program) Gap, the difference between the number of low-income residents
receiving MassHealth who are likely eligible for SNAP, and the number of people
actually receiving SNAP; and

WHEREAS:

The SNAP Gap places an immense burden on our local food pantries, who have,
anecdotally, seen a 10-15% increase in pantry use during the past few months, and who
are struggling to keep up with the growing need in our community; and

WHEREAS:

Government food assistance programs, like SNAP, serve as a longer-term, more
sustainable intervention to hunger that also accommodates recipients’ cultural and
medical dietary needs more easily and provides economic stimulus in the communities
they are used in, but many residents may not fully understand how to access the
benefits they are eligible for, or may struggle to complete the tedious process of filing
an application for SNAP; and

WHEREAS:

On December 4th, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Conference report passed in the
Massachusetts Legislature, which would authorize the Baker administration to use
$5,000,000 to develop a ‘common application’ that would allow MassHealth
applicants and recipients to submit an application for SNAP at the same time they are
applying for medical assistance, and which is currently awaiting approval from the
Governor; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts Legislature also authorized the Executive Office of Health and
Human Services to use $5,000,000 to create such a common application system
enabling MassHealth applicants to simultaneously submit a SNAP application in An
Act Financing the General Governmental Infrastructure of the Commonwealth (“IT
Bond Bill”); and

WHEREAS:

By streamlining the application process and making it easier for residents to access
critical food assistance benefits, a common application would help support our lowincome, food-insecure residents during their time of great need; now therefore be it

2021 Budget Conference report and move forward with creating a streamlined
“common application” to help expand access to and participation in SNAP; and be it

Subject:

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, December 1st, the School Committee had its last Regular Meeting and both motions that
I mentioned in the last communication—exploring the implementation of a pool testing strategy as
well as determining when the Field House can be made for school use—were adopted.
While the recommendation for approval regarding the winter sports guidelines for CRLS remote
learners was withdrawn by the Superintendent at the December 1st meeting to allow for a discussion
with the Health and Safety Committee prior to a School Committee vote, CRLS Athletic Director Tom
Arria still gave his presentation on the proposal for winter sports. The sports that are being considered
for this year’s winter season are basketball, ice hockey, swim and dive, alpine and Nordic skiing, and
gymnastics and will follow all state and district guidelines. The recommendation will be placed on the
agenda for the next Regular Meeting on Tuesday, December 15th.
On Wednesday, December 2nd, the School Climate Subcommittee convened to discuss revisions to the
elementary school check-in policy that the School Committee passed in June with educators and
caregivers.
Following the implementation of this policy, which required weekly individual relationship-building
check-ins between school staff and scholars and families, several concerns had been raised by
elementary school principals. While some schools implemented with success, others reported that the
requirement felt more like a compliance exercise than a value-add and they did not have the bandwidth
to deliver.
We had an important conversation about these challenges with some educators and caregivers of
varying perspectives at this meeting and discussed alternative approaches to effectively building
relationships between families and schools without losing sight of the emphasis on anti-racism.

CPS has also updated their “What Should I Do?” document, which outlines that students and staff
should not come to school if they:
• Have symptoms of COVID-19
• Have tested positive for COVID-19 and have not yet been cleared from isolation to return
• Had close contact with a confirmed case within the past 14 days
• Have symptomatic household relatives or housemates that have not yet received a negative test
• Have traveled to high-risk states within the past 14 days and have not yet received a negative
test
This month, CPS will be engaging with families through feedback surveys and listening sessions
(focused on different groups, including grade bands, in-person and remote learning families, different
language communities, special education families, etc.) to hear their perspectives on the student
learning experience thus far, as well as to discuss possible expansion of in-person learning. A link to a
survey as well as invitations to the listening sessions will go out soon.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has provided districts with the option to
decide locally whether snow days will be complete closures that are made up later in the school year,
or remote learning days. CPS has decided to treat “snow days” as remote learning days for the 202021 school year and those who would normally attend school in-person will continue to learn remotely
on those days.
We have begun our free virtual winter programming with Elevate Youth and are seeing excellent
engagement in the first week. The winter programming will continue until at least mid-February,
before we launch our free in-person spring cohorts again, so we are continuing to accept applications
for 4th, 5th, and 6th graders. Please share this link with any families you know who may be interested!
Weekly themes this winter will include learning about wildlife in our neighborhoods, cooking and
eating new and interesting foods, participating in group yoga and exercise classes, learning tips and
tricks to getting outside during the winter months, and much more.
Our upcoming meetings are as follows:
•

Friday, December 4th, 2020
o Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee Meeting | 4:00 PM
▪ To discuss safety policies and the health metrics to ensure they reflect the
disproportionate risk of COVID-19 to some communities and as part of the plan
to expand in-person learning

•

Tuesday, December 8th, 2020
o Roundtable Meeting | 6:00 PM
▪ With upper and high school principals

•

Tuesday, December 15th, 2020
o Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM

Please visit the new CPS COVID-19 Data Dashboard for up-to-date information on the risk of COVID19 transmission in our schools. The data is reviewed daily by our Department of Public Health and we
plan to re-evaluate our metrics again next month.
