To the Honorable City Councilors of Cambridge City Council
City Hall, 795 Massachusetts Avenue
Cambridge, MA 02139
Dear Council Members:
I am writing to respectfully request your permission to hang a banner to celebrate and promote the launch
of the Community Development Department’s Food Truck Pilot, which is designed to support women
and minority owned businesses and new entrepreneurs. The banner would be hung for the month of
March 2018, in advance of the start of the vending season (April to October 2018).
The request includes one banner (240 inches by 42 inches) to be hung across Massachusetts Avenue in
front of Cambridge City Hall (795 Massachusetts Avenue). The banner will be double sided so it will
look the same from both sides.
Enclosed is the design for the banner.
Thank you so much for your consideration of this request, and for the Council’s support of the Food
Truck Pilot.
Sincerely,
Lisa Hemmerle
Director, Economic Development Division
Community Development Department

WHEREAS:

Jerry’s Pond is an artificial pond created in 1870 from a disused clay pit, named for
Jeremiah McCrehan (1824-1907) who lived on Rindge Avenue and worked as a
laborer and teamster; and

hole under the purview of the Cambridge Parks Department from 1913 to 1961; and

WHEREAS:

Jerry’s Pond is a historically significant and culturally important body of water to
North Cambridge and Cambridge residents, and is currently under ownership of GCP
Applied Technologies; and

WHEREAS:

Jerry’s Pond is the closest green space to the three Rindge Towers, Jefferson Park and
additional units along Rindge Avenue representing approximately 3,500-4,000
affordable housing residents in total; and as residents do not have access to this large
area of green space, its restoration is an issue of public health, environmental justice,
and social equity in Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

A community group, Friends of Jerry’s Pond, has held community meetings to discuss
support for the restoration of Jerry’s Pond to once again be a community asset for the
thousands of Cambridge residents who live nearby as well as the many people who
commute through the area each day by the adjacent Red Line, Minuteman Bikeway,
Rindge Avenue and Alewife Brook Parkway; and

WHEREAS:

Further action towards the restoration of the Jerry’s Pond area will proceed most
expeditiously with current, accurate and comprehensive data on the environmental
hazards on the site given that prior studies are dated and incomplete and that such
study can be undertaken via a Targeted Brownfields Assessment (TBA) funded by the
Environmental Protection Agency, the goal of which is to “minimize the uncertainties
surrounding the actual or perceived contamination associated with these sites”; and

WHEREAS:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has offered the City of Cambridge the
opportunity to apply for a Targeted Brownfields Assessment Grant and requires access
to the site before determining whether an application can be made, and will ask the
