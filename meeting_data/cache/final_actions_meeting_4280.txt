This memo contains the following information requested by Policy Order 2023 #7 at the
City Council meeting on January 9, 2023, regarding the Blier, et al., Zoning Petition.
•

That the City Manager is hereby requested to direct the CDD and the Law
Department to examine the Citizen’s Petition submitted by Suzanne P. Blier, et.
al on the Harvard Square Zoning Petition Modification regarding Frontage of
Financial Institutions and make recommendations for any amendments that are
needed.

The staff suggested revisions included in this memo are primarily intended to respond to
the Planning Board Recommendations made in their December 14, 2023 memo to the
City Council (attached) and to clarify the following aspects of the text that seemed
ambiguous:
•

•

There was some uncertainty in the original text about whether the limitation is
meant to apply to a single establishment or to all establishments within the
building. For example, could two banks each occupy 25 feet of ground story
frontage in the same building? The alternative text clarifies that the limitation
applies to the entire building, which would not allow multiple banks to
collectively exceed the limitation.
There was concern about banks avoiding the frontage limitation by setting back
behind a narrow section of the building façade. The alternative text clarifies that
any bank use within 20 feet of the exterior ground story façade would be
considered to “occupy” that frontage. The concept is that if the bank use is set
20 feet back from the façade, another principal use could reasonably occupy
that space.

Additionally, Council Members at the January 9, 2023 meeting requested that the
petitioners work with the Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) and other local
stakeholders to develop consensus on proposed zoning revisions. The petitioners have
subsequently notified CDD staff of ongoing discussions with HSBA and possible
amendments to the proposal.

Original Petition Text
The following is a markup version of the Petition that compares it to the current zoning (additions are underlined, deletions in strikethrough):
“20.54.9 Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as identified in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than
twenty-five feet (25’) of the ground-floor level frontage of a building facing any a street, aggregated over one or more streets and measured
horizontally parallel to the that street and wall faces. This limitation shall apply to the sum of all ground-floor frontage to a depth of 20 feet
measured from the street. In addition, such uses shall not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s total horizontal ground-floor
building frontage aggregated over one or more streets. The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted
frontage upon finding that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique conditions of a particular building or site
and that the criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are met.”
Alternative Zoning Text
The text suggested by staff below would better match the intended outcomes as discussed at the Planning Board
hearing.
20.54.9 No more than 25 feet of the ground story street frontage of a building may be occupied by banks, trust
companies, or similar financial institutions. The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor
increase in the permitted frontage upon finding that such increase would create a result that is more compatible
with the unique conditions of a particular building or site and that the criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above
are met.
(a) For the purpose of this Section 20.54.9, a building’s ground story street frontage shall mean the cumulative
length of all exterior building façades fronting all abutting streets, measured parallel to the street lines.
(b) A bank, trust company, or similar financial institution shall be considered to occupy ground story street
frontage if it is contained within any portion of the ground story that is within 20 feet of the exterior building
façade, measured perpendicular to the street line.

Date:

December 14, 2022

Subject:

Blier, et al., Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board recommends ADOPTION, with additional
considerations.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On December 6, 2022, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss a
Zoning Petition by Suzanne Blier, et al., to amend Section 20.54.9 of the Zoning Ordinance (the
“Petition”). The Petition would modify the current limitations on the street frontage of banks,
trust companies, or similar financial institutions in the Harvard Square Overlay District. The
Board heard a presentation from Suzanne Blier, representing the petitioners, and received written
materials from staff in the City’s Community Development Department (CDD).
Following the presentation, public comment, and discussion among Board members, the
Planning Board voted to transmit a favorable recommendation on this Petition to the City
Council, with some additional suggestions.
The Board was generally supportive of limiting the frontage of banks in the Harvard Square
Overlay District and agreed that some recent as-of-right bank proposals had outcomes that did
not reflect the intent of the current zoning (see the attached Planning Board staff memo for
additional context). Board members agreed that the limitations in zoning should promote the
following outcomes:
•

The frontage of a bank should be limited across all streets on which it has frontage. For
example, a corner bank location should count its total frontage across both streets.
Likewise, if a bank has multiple entrances on different sides of a building fronting
different streets, the total frontage should be counted across all streets.

•

Frontage should include space occupied by a bank that is blocked by a sort of “veneer” or
other design that superficially blocks the frontage of the bank. For example, if a bank use
is behind a blank brick wall or a narrow buffer space, then that length should count
towards total frontage. The Board agreed that the goal is to promote transparency and
activation at the ground level, consistent with the unique character of Harvard Square.
Board members acknowledged that if there are site-specific scenarios where it would be
acceptable to have a bank use located behind a “blank wall” or similar screening
treatment, that proposal could seek a special permit from the Planning Board so that it
does not lead to unintended outcomes.

1.a

•

The limitation should apply to the cumulative frontage of banks along an entire building,
and not just to each individual bank establishment. Some Board Members noted that it
might be acceptable to have multiple banks within a building so long as each bank is
limited in frontage. However, Board members also recognized that there might be too
many opportunities for unintended outcomes if a single bank entity attempts to
differentiate its functions to be considered separate “establishments” in order to occupy
more frontage than desired.

Board members acknowledged that it will be difficult to draft zoning language that minimizes
unanticipated workarounds, and therefore recommends that CDD and Law Department staff be
asked to review the Petition text and suggest changes that will ensure the intended outcomes as
much as possible. Board members also acknowledged that because it is difficult to apply uniform
requirements to many different types of conditions, making the rules more restrictive might
prompt a large number of special permit applications from proposed bank uses in the future.
The Planning Board voted with 8 members in favor of transmitting the above recommendation.

Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

Key Points
Original intent: to limit bank frontage (problem with non-transparent windows and lengths).
• We are simply seeking to realize original intent of petition and already approved twice.

Attachment: HSNA zoning petition - Ordinance Committee 12.14.22a

Harvard Square Advisory Committee met on this Nov. 16, 2022

• No vote taken. Comments forwarded to the Planning Board.
At the Dec 8, 2022 meeting of the Planning Board, they voted unanimous support for HSNA petition amendment
• They opposed banks on corner locations
• They do not support brick walls or other non-transparent wall-window changes to enable banks to expand beyond the 25 linear
ground floor length on street visible sites
• They do not support adding multiple banks on the same property
• They urged CDD and the legal department to provide the clearest and best language possible to achieve these ends.
• Harvard Square property owner Raj Dhanda was at the Planning Board and voiced support.
In January 2023, HSNA leaders met twice with HSBA Executive Director and a property owner, proposing further edits.
• These proposed revisions were not supported.

(COM 328 #2023 : A

Here is the CDD proposed language (our edits in blue):

Attachment: HSNA zoning petition - Ordinance Committee 12.14.22a

20.54.9 No more than 25 feet of the ground story street frontage of a building may be occupied by banks, trust companies, or similar
financial institutions. The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted frontage upon finding
that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique conditions of a particular building or site and that the
criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are met. (a) For the purpose of this Section 20.54.9, a building’s ground story street frontage
shall mean the cumulative length of all exterior building façades fronting all abutting streets, measured parallel to the street lines. (b) A
bank, trust company, or similar financial institution shall be considered to occupy ground story street frontage if it is contained within
any portion of the ground story that is within 20 feet of the exterior building façade, measured perpendicular to the street line building
façade.
Jeff Roberts’ proposed language changes make sense, except we hope that you will consider changing the measurement of interior
setback (where “faux galleries” can be created) from 20 feet to the street (as we had originally written, and CDD supported), instead to
measure this 20’ setback perpendicular to the facade as our architect advisor has proposed.
One of the issues in Harvard Square with its many plazas is that often streets can be a sizable distance from the facades (over 20’in some
cases) and/or with corner properties there is a significant difference between the distances to the two streets. If the original petition
language is kept, it is important that any additional frontage beyond the 25 feet allowable ground floor frontage have transparent
windows and be delimited as “active use.”
If there are further amendments, we hope they will include the following:
Frontage shall not include street-facing separate use space within the tenant’s property unless it qualifies as “Active Use” with
independent signage, transparent windows, and a separate handicapped-accessible exterior entry. “Active Use” in this context refers to
cultural, entertainment and recreation use, or “retail” and “services” (insurance, real estate services; barber and beauty shops;
photography studios; shoe repair, and travel agencies).
