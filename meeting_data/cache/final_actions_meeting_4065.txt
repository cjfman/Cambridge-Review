CBAC Subgroup Meetings With Each Partnership: Share back, process reflection, and discussion
Families Moving Forward
Just-A-Start Corporation (JAS - Lead Organization), Cambridge Family & Children’s Service (CFCS), Cambridge Health
Alliance, Cambridge Housing Authority, Community Action Agency of Somerville (CAAS), Institute for Health and Recovery
(IHR)
Feb 23 – Partnership members present: Gerry Zipster (Just-A-Start), Ian Davis (Just-A-Start), Selma DeCastro (Just-A-Start),
Lori Segall (Just-A-Start); Courtney Gomez (Cambridge Family & Children’s Service), David Gibbs (Community Action Agency
of Somerville); John Lindamood (Cambridge Housing Authority); Katharine Thomas (Institute for Health and Recovery)
CBAC members present: Amal, Ellen, Geeta, Kim, Rowan (notes: Daniel)
Process reflection:
• More intimate opportunity – we gained insights about how they go about doing their work, how they collaborate,
how they are getting work done

Liked the informality, more conversational, interesting anecdotes – especially about the strength and resilience of
families; it made me think how powerful stories are, to really know about families, their strength and resilience
As a larger Partnership, the CBAC members were the minority
Case managers were there – so important to hear from them directly
They learned from each other – e.g., CAAS learning about Head Start families that are participants, IHR shared
about seeing the on-the-ground application of the trauma-informed approach it provides training on
Just-a-Start articulated its role as quarterback of the Partnership

Partnership discussion:
• Mentoring and developing trust very important with their participants, and offering tangible supports related to
housing and financial stability
• Participants have a much easier time talking about their children rather than their own needs
• Setting little goals easier than setting longer-term goals
• Even in a virtual environment, participants really helping each other, sharing peer learning; they are hoping for
more of that as in-person opportunities increase
• Connecting with participants is hard work, takes a while to connect
• Partner organizations are very helpful in terms of identifying services that will help the participants
• Benefits of large partnership – means that each organization is less insular
• Looking for additional funding for a Mother’s Day event for participants
• Considering cohort approach: tracking and evaluation is easier with cohort model; a drawback is not touching a
large number of people, and fewer big wins – the work takes longer and is deeper – it takes longer to realize
measurable accomplishments
• Considering Year 4: Partnership reiterated that their program was 6 months delayed in getting started – they
really have figured out the adaptation of a 5-year model to a 3-year model, so the 4th year would mean
completion of the full 3 years that was offered to participants, with a few month tail; and developing connections
with participants took longer than anticipated
• We asked them about scalability and replicability – they have things they think are replicable, and think they may
need help in terms of scaling; they are starting to notice things that could be repeated, and they would like CBAC
to help with that
• One challenge – the matched savings program that is part of their model, that money does not come from CBAC
given City restrictions, and having to raise that money separately is a challenge
• Considerations for CBAC in 3-year and beyond:
o What is the long-term/ replicable model coming out of this, and what are the elements of that?
o It is so interesting that we have these four different models, and what do four approaches have in
common? What is working? With this Partnership, hypothesis is that it is case worker that is significant
o And, if we are able to identify what the Partnership means in helping families, what is value of the
Partnership itself?
• So many partners, and they are able to provide resources and services within their network – they are able to
come up with solutions, and avenues of help very quickly; with the depth of Partnership, they are able to link
people so quickly and provide a really warm handoff
o How the Partnership understands families differently as a result of their Partnership – establishing
rapport is key to help people enhance their readiness for opportunity
• May be useful to deepen CBAC’s understanding about what makes the Partnership work and what makes it work
for families – build their resiliency, etc. – what are the things they could codify
Family Stability Project
De Novo, Inc. (Lead Organization), Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, Inc. (CEOC), Transition House, Inc.
Feb 28 – Partnership members present: John Froio (De Novo); Ronit Barkai (Transition House), Mojdeh Rohani (De Novo),
Amanda Becker (De Novo), Tina Alu (CEOC)
CBAC members present: Geeta, Paul, Sandra (notes: Lev)
Process reflection:
• Process worked really well: Free flowing conversation, group got along, great environment for sharing and
learning; the questions flowed well, gave different speakers opportunity to say things in different ways; prompted
us to do lots of listening, gave them great opportunities to speak in different ways about benefits of their project
and the struggles

Rethink our questions going forward – felt like they had already said a lot when we got to the third and fourth
questions
Great environment – hearing what they learned from each other, great example of organizations working
together, directors working together, and what it might look like if they work together at different levels
Format lent itself to reflection – freeness to step back, think about it; it is in those spaces that we found some
really interesting nuggets

Partnership discussion:
• Partnership has made shift from 3 Executive Directors working together to 3 organizations working together
• In addition to a common intake form, lots of other things they were sharing – e.g., joining around purchasing
• A lot of cross-training – more focus on trauma, deepened training for and understanding of their staff, intending
to continue for their organizations and other organizations
• Spirit of collaboration versus. competition among the organizations – leaning on each other for different things
• Considering approach: they are dealing with things as they come in, responding to needs of individual families as
they come in – it didn’t lend itself to cohort model; and, given sensitivity of the individual cases, it didn’t lend itself
to collective cases
• Important realization of how we approach these issues with families – start with immediate needs, and then move
toward how they work together; they are trying that – e.g., CEOC, starting to bring together groups of similar
languages
• With focus on stability, families starting at different points, moving ahead at a different pace
• For families, things have become much more work – if it was taking 6 to 8 hours pre-Covid, now taking 10 to 12
hours; people’s problems are more complex, more deeply rooted, everything harder to do
• There is a lot to learn from families and their stories – Partnership is starting to think about mechanisms to relay
stories of their clients, their issues, ideas, stories, solutions
• Their approach is very helpful – clients are coming in through one door and then accessing different services,
rather than a piecemeal approach
• The virtual environment actually increased access for some families – families are seeking social connections
• Each org in slightly different place – De Novo mostly remote, Transition House in person, CEOC hybrid; and if
remote connection is going to be important – need for tablets, and having access to technology made it easier for
clients to prepare for hearings
• Evaluation: HRiA has been very accommodating, very helpful; concern about evaluation timelines given that
clients came in at different times, and they didn’t have cohort – made it hard to launch family survey
• Considering year 4: they are interested in help from other Partnerships; it is important for Partnerships to come
together and learn from each other
• There are reasons for the different ways Partnerships do their work – e.g., given domestic violence and legal
issues, privacy is a really a priority with this Partnership
• For CBAC, collaboration has been foundation of our efforts from the beginning – we really promoted
collaboration; there are a lot of nonprofit organizations in Cambridge, focus on effort to address top tier needs in
Needs Assessment, and getting nonprofit organizations to work together was something we prioritized; seeing this
collaboration is a great plus for this Partnership – they worked together previously, and not in such a meaningful
way as they are now; they have learned a lot about each other as organizations and colleagues
• Consideration for CBAC: Sense of mismatch between what Partnership is thinking and what evaluator is thinking –
we want to make sure that everyone is on the same page in how that moves forward; challenge with family
survey, collecting data – initially and at various intervals, and the amount of time that it takes
• Families have had a really significant backslide, and the need for cash is very important – especially as families lost
unemployment benefits they had been getting
• How Partnership is structured for Family Stability Project: Equal partners in decision-making and De Novo has
taken lead in evaluation; it feels like they are equal, collaborating on operational things; equal say, equal pride –
sense that it is a group of people that respect and value working with each other in a different way
o Different from Family Moving Forward model – and even that model is more of a backbone approach, as
described in Collective Impact literature; having a backbone/ lead organization works well with many
partnerships, and it may be something we want to keep track of
o CBAC may want to look at a matrix of different ways nonprofit organizations collaborate
• In their written submission, Family Stability Project also mentioned that CBAC requirements felt onerous – that
didn’t come up in conversation

Port Arise Institute
Community Art Center (Lead Organization), Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House, Tutoring Plus
Mar 1 – Partnership members present: Erin Muirhead McCarty (Community Art Center), Dr. Kimberly Massenberg
(Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House), Kosar Mohamed (Port Arise/CAC), Jacey Buel (Tutoring Plus)
CBAC members present: Amy, Liz, Sandra (notes: Lev)
Process reflection:
• So glad we did these meetings, opportunity to connect, know who they are, their experiences
• One of our objectives was to build better relationships – they thanked us, knew it was a lot of work, appreciated
the opportunity to tell us about fabric of their program, meet us
Partnership discussion:
• Initial proposal included the arts, teaching families about possible employment through the arts as a way to
support themselves, and lifting up Community Advisory Council to lift up community leadership – they emphasized
how much the context has changed their plan, and it is a whole different team of Executive Directors than that
which proposed the plan; they are very intentional about going deep versus wide, and currently working with two
cohorts of 10 families each
• Role of Family Advocate: It is clear how essential the role is in providing support in non-judgmental way, providing
tangible help with many situations – e.g., people being on hold for hours for benefits, challenges for families with
children with special needs, tech issues and getting families connected, etc.
• Family Advocate is setting goals with families – and meeting and setting one goal creates momentum toward
other goals
• Family Advocate shared what it takes for her to do the work – every week, she is in touch with all families; I
appreciate that they were able to be nimble, adjust to family’s changing needs, and figure out who was going to
do what
• Partnership had to pare down – they had planned to offer arts-based internship, and pivoted, now offering free
art classes for credit through Montserrat College
• Partnership structure: Each Partnership playing different roles: Community Art Center is supervising family
advocate, Tutoring Plus is developing Advisory Committee, Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House has primary role
of offering different community-wide workshops
• This turnover in the Executive Director staff could have been a total disaster – none of the current EDs wrote the
proposal, and have had to figure out how to move forward with what was originally intended; the new ED at
Tutoring Plus just figured out what it was about – in Cambridge, there about 70 educational orgs geared toward
kids, families, that have a set of classes/ curriculum, but have not asked about family’s individual needs, and yet
they get exposed to families with pressing and complex needs with no way to do anything about it; with this, now I
can help my families get to someone or get them the help that I would have sort of had in periphery
• Partnership is slowly adding back things that they had to scale back due to Covid – more in-person activities– e.g.,
getting families to attend in-person workshops, getting some part of cohort on Community Advisory Committee,
and expanding the Committee to include organizations beyond these three, to help give input about what
community’s needs are
• CBAC will have a lot to watch about how they develop, and they are not totally bought into quantitative piece;
they haven’t been brought into what value of evaluation is; they really wanting to beef up qualitative piece – and
saw our meeting with them as part of that
o Thinking about qualitative versus quantitative – what are the outcomes, what are the right questions to
ask and outcomes to look for? Then qualitative and quantitative overlap
• As funders – look at what happens when you are funded to work together and the power of partnership – e.g., art
classes and tutoring as venue to understand what families’ needs are
• They have very small cohort – work is very intense with families – and they are adding a second cohort, and are
starting to track the interactions with these folks; they have a cohort model and then a more emergency model of
people coming in with needs, and the Family Advocate said it hasn’t been overwhelming yet – will that remain
true?
• The case manager role is key – and she talked about what it is like working for three bosses – at first confusing/
conflicting, and has found out how closely they all work together, and feels supported by each; part of what makes
the Partnership great is the case manager – as the one real staff person – delivering direct services, the
Partnership has made her feel supported; part of it related to geographical location of the partners – they are all
in close physical proximity

This group had a wonderful jump start on their partnership as part of their participation in the Kendall Community
Group – they have a strong history of working together, and it gives me a good feeling to know that it is still alive;
they really built that geographic base of being a partnership, working together in the Port in a powerful and
positive way
Related to that – they really want to work with CBAC and HRIA, and build bridges to continued funding beyond
CBAC – how can we help each Partnership move forward?
They started out with a model that was focused on building self-efficacy of families to advocate for themselves
and their community, and the model has shifted to a service provision model – and what does case management
really mean for each Partnership given different models and approaches?
o The piece around building efficacy of families is still part of the Community Advisory Committee – and the
Partnership is hopeful that that as things open up more, they will build on it more; another piece of it is
building intra-cohort leadership

Strengthening Families Together Project
Cambridge Community Center (Lead Organization), organization formerly known as Agassiz Baldwin Community, East End
House
Mar 1 – Partnership members present: Darrin Korte (Cambridge Community Center); Michael Delia (East End House)
CBAC members present: Caleb, Ellen, Michelle (notes: Daniel)
Process reflection:
• Maria unable to be there – big loss
• Small group format really important – the more that we could do this, and do it even in person, the better – there
is a lot of unbelievable work going on from organizations that are experts in their neighborhoods and fields; it
helps to have these conversations in small groups – it is a big improvement
Partnership discussion:
• Partnership experienced and navigated significant impact of Covid – work supporting each other in providing
everything to their respective communities, e.g., food pantries, setting up internet for kids to be Zooming at the
same time; they addressed real world problems as they are really happening
• Food insecurity a huge problem – food pantries and getting food out a very helpful service
• This group initially integrated at Executive Director level – support each other, call each other, all in this together,
have frank conversations about everything from air filters to best internet access; the collaboration between staff
members is developing in the second year, and has been productive – all the groups really liked PEAR, the
professional development group that came in; the Partnership has been able to tailor professional development to
their needs and they are excited and enthusiastic to see how that moves forward in the future
• They have all had challenges, to differing degrees, with hiring case managers; for all three, the goal continues to
be to hire a case manager – Cambridge Community Center was able to find someone through their grassroots
effort; East End House had someone that was not able to stay; organization formerly known as Agassiz Baldwin is
still looking for one; there is a challenge with staffing in these organizations and across the sector
• Challenges they see moving forward include mental health for youth and teens – they are really trying to figure
out what they can do to work together to address the crisis in Cambridge, to see what they can do to be proactive
– and impending housing insecurities
• There may be opportunities for Partnerships to reach out to CBAC to connect to City and other resources that are
available to families
• Data collection and reporting – was mentioned that it was onerous, and don’t want to be putting more work on
these organizations that are doing so much
• Family surveys – they are starting to do some of them, and the lack of and/or newness of case managers has been
a constraint, as there is a need for relationships with families before asking for survey completion
• The three organizations were able to come together as Partnership to navigate Covid, and the organizations were
differentially impacted by Covid
• They are talking about moving toward a semi-cohort model, though they have not reached a decision about that
• This is a Partnership that has such an interesting foundation, and, from the beginning there were some challenges
about the way they talked about how they would do the work, and Covid has amplified that; many things that
were different about this Partnership from the beginning that this pandemic made even more challenging
• They included language in their written report that they had toxic relationship with HRiA, and when we asked
about it, they indicated that they are not standing on that language exactly

And CBAC helping to support them as they move to Year 3, and they have ideas, and their focus on mental health
support – the ways in which they hope to continue in that direction is useful for CBAC and for them – how do we
support their Partnership as part of Partnerships overall?
Focus on mental health is impressive and this Partnership is most affected because they deal with school-age
children – so much has been up in the air for them; two things that came up in their written response – I am
impressed by the amount of work they have done with PEAR, and confused by how that is translating into their
work with children and families; I don’t understand how that model is being used in the individual programs with
children and families they are serving
From the beginning we asked about a case manager across the three organizations, and they said no, and two
years in they are still having issues with case management piece – it has been frustrating for them, and impacted
their ability to capture what they are doing; without staffing there, there are some real challenges, and I would
like to know more – let’s see if we can come up with a positive plan about how we can move forward, and with
staffing deficit, it presents a little bit of a hurdle

CBAC Recommendation
• CBAC unanimously approved (with Kim M abstaining from Port Arise Institute approval, Maria L abstaining from
Strengthening Families Together approval) to recommend Year 3 funding for each Partnership, which will include
reaching agreement about and documenting with each Partnership their evaluation activities during year 3, and
attending to some of the other considerations that emerged as part of the renewal process
• Some things we will work on with Partnerships entail responsibilities from both Partnerships and CBAC to make
sure evaluation works
