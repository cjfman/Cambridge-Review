PLANNING BOARD
CITY HALL ANNEX, 344 BROADWAY, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139

Date:

December 21, 2022

Subject:

Callender, et al., Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board does NOT RECOMMEND adoption.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On December 20, 2022, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss a
Zoning Petition by Duane Callender, et al., to amend Article 2 and Article 4 of the Zoning
Ordinance (the “Petition”). The Petition would create a new definition for “Technical office for
research and development, laboratory & research facility” (4.34(f) in the Table of Use
Regulations) and prohibit said use in all office and business zoning districts, with exceptions for
certain special districts and overlay districts and subject to additional considerations. The Board
heard a presentation from Duane Callender, Lee Farris, and Kavish Gandhi, representing the
petitioners, and received written materials from staff in the City’s Community Development
Department (CDD).
Following the presentation, public comment, and discussion among Board members, the
Planning Board voted to transmit an unfavorable recommendation on this Petition to the City
Council.
Board members generally agreed with the petitioners’ goal to promote new housing
development. Board members also recognized the issue that commercial lab development may
outcompete other land uses in the City, such as housing. However, Board members agreed that
this Petition takes too blunt an approach to addressing this issue, and that a more nuanced
approach that incorporates more study and more input from stakeholders would be preferable.
Board members acknowledged that there are many different types of lab facilities throughout
Cambridge, and that commercial research and development generates distinct benefits for the
City, such as jobs, tax revenue, and contributions to affordable housing development through
requirements such as incentive zoning. Some Board members emphasized that labs have been an
important part of the City’s identity and ethos, and that research done in Cambridge labs
addresses many global problems. New restrictions on lab uses could potentially have the
deleterious effect of stifling innovation and harming smaller property owners. Board members
also remarked that lab development and housing development are not necessarily mutually
exclusive, and there may be other ways to regulate the specific differences between labs and
other types of commercial development.

a

While some Board members noted that certain areas of the City may benefit from protections
from large-scale lab development, Board members agreed that the Petition was not structured
properly to achieve the outcomes desired. The majority of Board members agreed that the best
way to proceed would be to engage in a collaborative planning process involving the Petitioners,
property owners, businesses, City staff, City Council, and other stakeholders before advancing
this initiative. One Board member agreed that more work should be done but suggested that it
could be done by amending this Petition within the current timeframe for consideration.
The Planning Board voted with 6 members in favor of transmitting the above recommendation,
and one member voting against. One member was absent.

Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Mary Flynn, Vice Chair.

Summary of Petition Effects
The stated intent of the Petition is to prevent an unfettered expansion of biotech laboratories in
Cambridge, in order to minimize competition with other land uses such as housing and retail.
The Petition creates a new definition for the existing use category Technical office for research and
development, laboratory & research facility. The proposed definition focuses on a range of potential labrelated activities, while also specifically excluding educational institutions, medical/dental offices,
innovation/maker spaces and pure software-based activities.
The Petition amends the current use table for technical office uses such that they would no longer be
permitted in any Business or Office district, with modifications contained in two proposed footnotes:
•

The first footnote states that any pre-existing technical office use in existence or permitted prior
to January 1, 2023 in a Business or Office district shall be considered a conforming use under
auspices of modifying an existing building or relocating the use within an existing building.

•

The second footnote states that technical office uses will be permitted in any Planned Unit
Development (PUD), Alewife Overlay District (AOD), Special District (SD), Mixed-Use
Development: Kendall Center (MXD) district, or other “special zoning district” that already
permitted the use prior to January 1, 2023. The footnote continues that technical offices are no
longer permitted in Special Districts 2, 9, and 10, or any Overlay Districts with a base zoning of
Residential, Business or Office.

Background
Defining Lab Uses in Cambridge Zoning
Cambridge’s current system of zoning puts all commercial research and development (R&D) uses under
the umbrella of the Technical office for research and development, laboratory & research facility
definition in the Table of Permitted Uses. These commercial lab uses can range from software
development and engineering to life science research and development, medical research, chemical
testing, and robotics. One feature that differentiates “technical office” from “general office” is that the
former can include limited manufacturing of products, such as prototyping. There is currently a separate
land use category for academic and non-commercial research (Noncommercial Research Facility) in the
use table.
Commercial Labs in Cambridge
Commercial R&D activities exist within a wide variety of built contexts throughout the City, from
sprawling, low-scale developments (e.g., in the Alewife Quadrangle), to more mid-rise mixed-use
developments along the City’s commercial corridors, and in new high-rise developments in the densest
parts of the City. Companies engaging in R&D in the City can be smaller, start-up operations all the way
to major, international technology corporations. Because the range of lab types and entities can widely
vary, so too do the building needs and physical space requirements. Certain types of facilities, such as
biosafety labs, have specific needs for larger mechanical arrays to accommodate requirements for
specialized piped utilities and air handling. Conversely, a computer-based research facility may not have

a

building requirements that differ much from general office uses. Lab facilities are found in newer
buildings that are specifically built to accommodate them, as well as in older commercial buildings that
might be retrofitted to support different R&D activities.
Cambridge has one of the largest and densest clusters of commercial R&D activity in the country and is
regarded as a worldwide leader in fields such as commercial life science. “Spin-off” commercialization of
research from MIT, Harvard, and affiliated institutions is often cited as an explanation for Cambridge’s
status. Cambridge’s regulatory environment is also regarded as a factor. Cambridge has allowed
“technical office” in all commercial districts since the 1970s. Also in the 1970s, Cambridge established
public health regulations for biosafety that became a model for other cities.
Where Lab Uses are Generally Permitted
Technical office uses are generally permitted in all office, business and industrial districts in the City as
well as some overlay districts and PUD’s (see Figure 1 below). These uses are primarily concentrated in
the East Cambridge and Alewife areas, as well as along some of the City’s commercial corridors (Mass
Ave, Cambridge Street, Alewife Brook Pkwy) and the City’s major squares (Kendall Square, Porter
Square, Central and Harvard Square), subject to additional requirements and review (detailed below).

Current Regulatory Framework
Lab development in Cambridge generally follows the review thresholds for other types of development
in the City. Development of at least 50,000 square feet requires a Project Review Special Permit (or

a

20,000 square feet in Business A, A-1 and A-2 districts). The Planning Board must make findings of
approval based on environmental impacts, including potential visual and noise effects from mechanical
equipment, loading and deliveries, and lighting. Development of at least 25,000 square feet requires
compliance with the City’s Building & Site Plan requirements in Article 19.50, which includes prescriptive
design requirements for the location and screening of mechanical equipment and solid waste, as well as
noise regulations supported by acoustical studies from a professional engineer. Additional requirements
may need to be met depending on the specific zoning requirements for a district.
There are also applicable non-zoning regulations for lab uses, such as laboratory safety requirements
(administered by the Cambridge Public Health Department), state environmental compliance
(Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection), building codes, and noise requirements
(License Commission or the Inspectional Services Department (ISD)).
Current Lab Locations in Cambridge
There is no definitive list of all “technical office” uses in Cambridge. Figure 2 maps locations based on
data available from ISD, the Public Health Department, the Assessing Department, and the Special
Permits Database. Labs are generally clustered in higher-density office and industrial districts. There are
rare instances of labs being located in higher-density Business districts such as Harvard or Central
Square. Labs are even more rare in lower-density office and business districts. Although they are
allowed by zoning, they are more difficult to establish due to smaller building and lot sizes, limits on
allowable height and density, and physical constraints on activities like loading and deliveries.

Considerations
Policy Discussions
The Petition would effectively prohibit technical office uses in most commercial districts of the City,
including areas that have strong R&D clusters and are outside the squares and neighborhood-scale
commercial corridors that are cited in the Petition’s stated intent. Figure 3 (below) illustrates the net
effect the Petition would have on where new lab uses are permitted. In addition to Central and Harvard
Squares, Cambridge Street, and the Mass Ave corridor, new lab uses would be restricted along some
parts of Memorial Drive, First and Second Streets in East Cambridge, many parts of Cambridgeport, parts
of Kendall Square, and other areas. As explained below, the regulations in some areas would be
ambiguous.

Figure 3: Illustration of effects of Petition on permitted lab locations. Source: City of Cambridge, 2022.

In addition to the substantive planning issues raised by the Petition, there are issues with the form of
the Petition that are described below.
Definitions
The proposed definition for technical office uses specifically excludes labs primarily used for educational
purposes, medical and dental offices that provide accessory lab services, innovation spaces, maker
spaces and similar uses, and software-based laboratories. Some of these are uses already listed
elsewhere in the Table of Use Regulations in Article 4.

a

However, “innovation space,” “maker space,” and “purely software based” (for instance) are undefined
terms, which could create confusion in determining what uses would fit those terms and how they
would be classified in the Table of Use Regulations. If a use is not expressly permitted in Article 4, then it
is prohibited, pursuant to Section 4.13 of the Zoning Ordinance. The effect of the Petition could be that
many types of facilities which are currently permitted throughout the City would not be permitted
anywhere in the City.
The Zoning Ordinance should define uses comprehensively, so that any use that is intended to be
allowed in any zoning district is listed in the Table of Use Regulations. The proposed definition attempts
to describe what is included or excluded in this one definition, but as a stand-alone definition, it does
not provide clear guidance on how to classify and regulate the various uses that might exist now or in
the future.
Proposed Footnotes
The first proposed footnote attempts to create an exception for lab uses in existing buildings to be
considered “conforming uses” in districts where the Petition would prohibit them. This is a confusing
usage of the term “conforming,” which normally means “meeting current zoning standards.” This
footnote applies the term “conforming” to uses that would be considered “legally preexisting
nonconforming.”
Legally preexisting nonconforming uses can be maintained but cannot be enlarged or replaced by
another nonconforming use. The City’s provisions for nonconforming uses are in Article 8 of the Zoning
Ordinance. If the intent of the Petition is to create additional protections for legally preexisting
nonconforming technical office uses that are not otherwise applied to all legally nonconforming uses,
then a better approach would be to propose including those protections in Article 8.
Additionally, the first proposed footnote may create confusion as there is a distinction between a legally
preexisting nonconforming use and a legally preexisting nonconforming structure. A legally preexisting
nonconforming use does not provide protections for dimensional alterations of structures. If the intent
here is to do so, those additional protections would need to be included in Article 8. Also, the first
proposed footnote seems to provide protections for technical offices uses that are in existence or
permitted prior to January 1, 2023, but under the state Zoning Act, a use that is in existence or has a
building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing is protected
from amendments to the zoning. There may be confusion caused by the discrepancy in these dates.
The second footnote attempts to maintain the permissibility of lab uses in the City’s overlay and PUD
districts. Again, the effects of this footnote are somewhat unclear because the footnote contradicts
itself. For example, the footnote expressly permits technical office uses in PUD and AOD districts, but
goes on to say that technical office uses in overlay districts with base office or business districts are not
permitted. Many PUD and AOD districts contain base office and business districts, in some cases
containing multiple underlying zoning districts that may or may not permit lab uses.
The purpose of overlay districts (which include PUD and AOD districts) is to modify the provisions of the
base district. Many base “special districts” use a similar approach of referencing another base district
and listing specific modifications. Attempting to modify overlay district requirements through a footnote

in the base zoning creates a circular logic that will likely cause problems in application. The base zoning
should be as clear and simple as possible, and any desired modifications to an overlay district or special
district should be made within the provisions of that overlay district or special district.
