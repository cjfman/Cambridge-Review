City of Cambridge Employee Manual (issue 7/30/2001)

The purpose of this manual is to provide general guidelines for all City employees. It does not constitute
an agreement or contract with respect to your employment. The City also has employees whose
conditions of work may vary according to the provisions of their respective union contracts. To the
extent that provisions of specific union contracts differ from the corresponding provisions outlined in this
manual, those specific contractual provisions will supersede the provisions of this manual.
This manual has been prepared to introduce you to the City of Cambridge's history, philosophy,
employment practices, and policies, as well as the benefits provided to you as a valued employee and the
conduct expected from you.
No employee manual can answer every question, nor would we want to restrict the normal question and
answer interchange among us. It is in our person-to-person conversations that we can better know each
other, express our views, and work together harmoniously.
We hope this manual will help you feel comfortable with the City. We depend on you — your success is
our success. Please don't hesitate to ask questions. Your supervisor will gladly answer them. We
believe you will enjoy your work and your fellow employees. We also believe you will find the City of
Cambridge a great place to work.
We ask that you read this manual carefully, and refer to it whenever questions arise. We also suggest
that you take it home so your family can become familiar with the City and our policies.
Should any provision in this employee manual be found to be unenforceable and invalid, such finding
does not invalidate the entire employee manual, but only the subject provision.

RIGHT TO AMEND MANUAL
The City's policies, benefits, and rules, as explained in this manual, may be changed from time to time as
circumstances, employment legislation, and economic conditions dictate. If and when provisions are
changed, you will be notified. A copy will also be placed on our bulletin boards and on our intranet site.
The policies in this manual are to be considered as guidelines. The City of Cambridge, at its option, may
change, delete, suspend or discontinue any part or parts of the policies in this manual at any time without
prior notice. Any such action will apply to existing as well as future employees with continued
employment being the consideration between the employer and employee. No one other than the City
Manager may alter or modify any of the policies in this manual. No statement or promise by a
supervisor, manager, or department head may be interpreted as a change in policy nor will it constitute an
agreement with an employee.

INTRODUCTION

You're Part of Our Team
Whether you are a new hire or a former employee returning to the City, the City Manager and the entire
City administration welcomes you to employment with the City. As an organization committed to
excellence in public service, we are pleased you have joined us in our continuing efforts to improve the
quality of life for residents of our city.
Beginning a new position is an exciting challenge. Your fellow employees, especially your supervisor,
want to help you get off to a good start and can provide support to ensure your success. Feel free to ask
them for help about anything you don't understand. The City is successful because of the contributions of
our employees; we are counting on you to uphold this tradition of providing excellent service to the
public and your colleagues.
One of the first things you should do is carefully read this manual. It is designed to answer many of your
questions about the policies and practices of the City of Cambridge, what you can expect from the City
of Cambridge, and what the City of Cambridge expects from you.
No manual can attempt to answer every question. Certain practices or policies may vary from
department to department, and if your employment is covered by a union contract. If you are unsure,
please consult your supervisor.

ABOUT THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE
The City of Cambridge is a public agency and a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. It is one of forty cities among the three hundred fifty-one (351) cities and towns within
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
History
Planned as the capital of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the settlement northwest of the Charles River
was founded in 1630 and named Newtowne. In 1634 the colonial government was moved across the
river to Boston. Four years later the village was renamed Cambridge after the English university where
many of its leading settlers had been educated.
From colonial times, when it was a center of New England patriot activity, and up to the present,
Cambridge, its people, and its institutions have had a major influence in the region and beyond.

WELCOME TO THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE

2.1.b

Government Structure
The structure of Cambridge City government is controlled by the City Charter. Since the 1940's
Cambridge has been governed by a Charter providing for a Council/Manager form of government,
known as “Plan E”. Cambridge was the first city in the Commonwealth to adopt this form of
government.
Legislative authority in Cambridge is exercised by a nine member City Council, elected at large through
a system of weighted voting known as proportional representation. The Council is responsible for the
enactment of municipal laws called ordinances and for determining the general governmental policies of
the City. All funds expended by the City must be appropriated by the Council after being recommended
by the City Manager. The City Council also establishes the taxing policies for the City. Members of the
Council are elected for a term of two years. One member of this body is elected by the nine councilors
for a two-year term to serve as Mayor. In addition to chairing Council meetings, appointing committees
of the Council, and serving as the ceremonial head of the City, the Mayor also serves as chair of the
City’s School Committee, a separate elected body overseeing School Department policies.
The executive power of the City rests with the City Manager, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the
City and Appointing Authority for all but four city positions. The City Manager is appointed by the City
Council and serves at their pleasure. The City Manager is responsible for managing the City’s
administrative affairs and for recommending an annual budget for the Council’s consideration. Serving
under the City Manager are the heads of the various departments of the City. Currently there are over
forty (40) separate departments, some large and some small, with their own particular area of
responsibility. Typically a new employee will be hired to work in a particular department. Department
heads are responsible to the City Manager for the efficient and effective administration of the
department. The City is also served by a number of Boards and Commissions, most of whose members
serve on a voluntary basis, providing policy guidance to particular departments and/or decision-making
in particular areas, such as zoning appeals.

Cambridge is today the fifth (5th) largest city in Massachusetts with approximately one hundred and five
thousand (105,000) residents concentrated in six and one quarter (6¼) square miles. It is a thriving city
that values its diversity and rich multi-cultural heritage. It is made up of at least thirteen distinct
neighborhoods, many with strong ethnic roots and traditions. It is the home of world-renowned
educational institutions, and has a strong economy that includes manufacturing, retail services,
biotechnology, and other high technology industries.

2.1.b

EXPECTATIONS

The City of Cambridge is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer committed to promoting a
multi-cultural work force representative of the diverse community we serve. It is our established
employee relations policy to:
1. Provide necessary and desired services to our residents and visitors in an effective and efficient
manner that is fair, honest, and sensitive to individual and community needs.
2. Select employees on the basis of skill, training, ability, attitude, and character without discrimination
with regard to age, sex, color, race, creed, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, religion,
marital status, political belief, Vietnam era veteran status, or any disability that does not prohibit the
performance of essential job functions.
3. Pay all employees fairly and in recognition of their efforts and contributions.
4. Dedicate ourselves to improving services and quality on an on-going basis.
5. Enhance the development of staff who understand and meet our objectives, and who accept with
open minds the ideas, suggestions, and constructive criticisms from fellow employees.
6. Provide employees with the opportunity to discuss any problem arising out of work with supervisors
in the department and, if still unresolved, with a representative or designee of the City Manager.
7. Make prompt and fair adjustment of complaints that may arise in the everyday conduct of our service
to the community, to the extent that is practicable.
8. Respect individual rights, and treat all employees with courtesy and consideration.
9. Maintain mutual respect in our working relationships.
10. Promote employees on the basis of their ability and merit.
11. Make promotions and fill vacancies from within whenever possible consistent with departmental
operating needs.
12. Deal with labor unions or employee organizations in a fair and respectful manner, meeting our
obligations to bargain in good faith towards the establishment of wages, hours of work, and working
conditions that promote departmental effectiveness and positive employee morale.
13. Administer our employment programs consistent with state and federal law and City policy.

What You Can Expect from the City of Cambridge

2.1.b

14. Do all these things in a spirit of friendliness and cooperation so that the City of Cambridge will
continue to be known as "a great place to work!"

Your first responsibility is to understand your duties and how to perform them promptly, correctly and
pleasantly. You are also expected to cooperate with management and your fellow employees and to
maintain a positive team attitude. How well you perform your job, how well you interact with fellow
employees and with those the City serves, and how you accept direction can affect the success of your
department and your future within the City. In turn, the performance of one department can impact the
entire service offered by the City. Consequently, whatever your position, you have an important
assignment: perform every task to the very best of your ability. The result will be better performance for
the City overall and personal satisfaction for you. Finally, you can contribute only if you are here.
Regular, dependable attendance is critical to your on-the-job success.
You are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities for personal development that are offered to
you. This manual offers insight on how you can positively perform to the best of your ability to meet
and exceed the expectations of the City and the people it serves.
We strongly believe you should have the right to make your own choices in matters that concern and
control your life. We believe in direct access to management. We are dedicated to creating a working
environment where you can approach your supervisor or manager to discuss any problem or question.
We value your input and believe that your experiences and insight can improve the City's performance if
you are willing to voice your opinions and contribute your suggestions to improve the quality of our
services.
Remember, you help create the healthful, pleasant and safe working conditions that the City intends for
you. Your dignity and that of fellow employees, as well as that of the people we serve, is important to
the City.

PUBLIC/CUSTOMER RELATIONS POLICY
Members of the Public Are Our Customers
The success of the City depends upon the quality of our interactions within the City, with our employees,
with the residents and visitors we serve, other public and private organizations, and the general public.
Because we are a public agency, dedicated to public service, all members of the public are our customers.
Our salaries are paid by taxpayers. The public’s impression of the City and the public’s willingness to
support us is greatly dependent on you and the quality of the services you provide. Regardless of your
position, you are an ambassador for the City of Cambridge. The more goodwill you promote, the more
the public, our customers, will respect and appreciate you, the City, and the services we provide.

What the City Expects from You

2.1.b

Here are several things you can do to help give these public customers a good impression of the City of
Cambridge:

2. Communicate pleasantly and respectfully with other employees and members of the public at all
times.
3. Follow up on requests and questions promptly, provide businesslike replies to inquiries and requests,
and perform all duties in an orderly manner.
4. If you do not have the necessary information to answer a question, find the appropriate employee
who does, and refer the individual to that person.
5. When members of the public are waiting for service, make sure you are providing services as
professionally and efficiently as possible.
6. Take great pride in your work, thank others for assistance, and enjoy doing your very best. Take
pleasure in leaving our customers satisfied.

WE NEED YOUR IDEAS
Ask any of our employees who have worked with us for a long time and they will probably tell you of
the many changes and improvements that have come about in their departments since they first joined us.
We believe the person doing the job is in the best position to think of ways to do it more easily, more
efficiently, and more effectively. If you think of a better way of doing your job, discuss it with your
supervisor, who will welcome your suggestions and ideas.

1. Act competently and deal with individuals in a courteous, helpful, and respectful manner.

2.1.b

WORKLIFE

The normal workweek consists of five (5) days, seven and one-half (7.5) or eight (8) hours long, Monday
through Friday. Employees should contact their supervisor and/or union contract to verify their work
schedule. Department heads, managers, professionals, and many others may be required to work
significantly greater hours from time to time in order to fulfill their responsibilities. Limited
compensatory time is available in recognition of that effort (see section on Compensatory time).

BUSINESS HOURS
Regular office hours at City Hall and most other municipal buildings are 8:30 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.,
Monday through Friday. Your particular hours of work and the scheduling of your lunch period will be
determined and assigned by your supervisor or department head. Most employees are assigned to work a
thirty-seven and one half (37.5) hour work week, with one (1) full unpaid hour for lunch. Depending on
your individual schedule, union contract, and/or flex time arrangements, you are required to take either a
one (1) hour or a one half- (1/2) hour paid or unpaid lunch period daily; please understand that you may
not "work through lunch" in order to arrive late or to leave early or to work extra time. Some
departments and those working in forty (40) hour positions may have different starting and ending times.
Check with your supervisor or department manager to be sure you understand the exact starting and
ending time and departmental policy on lunch and breaks.
The City reserves the right to change starting and ending times with reasonable notice and after fulfilling
any collective bargaining obligation we may have.

EMPLOYEE BREAKS
Full-time office and administrative staff may take up to two (2) fifteen (15) minute breaks during their
workday. These breaks should be scheduled with their supervisors, one for each half of the workday.
Breaks may not be accumulated or accrued for use in one day or toward their use on any future day.
Other than the two (2) fifteen (15) minute breaks and during the lunch period, employees are not
authorized to take any additional time off, for example, to smoke. Employees are also not authorized to
"break up" their two (2) fifteen (15) minute break periods into smaller increments of less than 15 minutes
apiece in order to have more breaks during the course of the work day. For employees who are
considering quitting smoking, the City offers smoking cessation programs through their health insurance
plans; interested employees are encouraged to take advantage of these.

WORK SCHEDULE

2.1.b

The City presently offers employees the opportunity to request flexible hours within parameters defined
in the Flex Time Policy. A flexible work schedule (flex time) is available to regular full and part-time
employees in good standing, as well as temporary workers, and it is contingent on the operational and
business needs for the Department. Flex time schedules are normally for a fiscal year, but arrangements
can also be made for intermittent and temporary situations. Individuals seeking flexible work
arrangements must submit a written flex time request to their supervisor and department head, explaining
how the change will affect the delivery of services, access by the public, and impact on co-workers.
Requests are reviewed by the City Manager, who will make a final determination of flex time approval.
Please contact your supervisor or department head for more information.

JOB DESCRIPTIONS
We maintain a job description for each position in the City. When your duties and responsibilities are
changed, your job description will be updated. If you wish to see your job description, please ask your
supervisor or call the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY).

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Supervisors are expected to help employees perform their jobs as expected by providing clear direction
and meaningful feedback on their performance. Performance management includes defining work
responsibilities and setting goals, providing opportunities for employees to develop skills, coaching
employees, and providing feedback both in discussions and through performance reviews. These
activities should continue throughout the employee’s employment with the City.
Generally, supervisors will conduct a performance review at or near the end of the first six months of
employment. The goal of the introductory performance review is to ensure a high level of performance
by promoting meaningful communication between the supervisor and the employee at first hire. In the
event that the employee is rated as needing improvement or unsatisfactory in one or more categories at
any time during the initial six-month period, the supervisor may either recommend the release of the
employee from employment with the City or an extension of the employee's introductory period.

ATTENDANCE
You are expected to be at your work station and ready to work at the beginning of your assigned daily
work hours, and you are expected to remain on the job until the end of your assigned work hours, except
for approved breaks and lunch. When your work takes you away from your work station, please let your
supervisor know where you are going and how long you expect to be gone.

FLEXIBLE WORK HOURS

2.1.b

Absence or Lateness

If you are unable to report to work or if you will arrive late, you are required to contact your supervisor
by the regular starting time. However, if you know in advance that you will need to be absent, you
should seek your supervisor's approval beforehand.
When you call in to inform your department of an unexpected absence or late arrival, ask for your
supervisor directly. For late arrivals, please indicate when you expect to arrive for work. If your
supervisor is not available when you call, you should leave the information with another supervisor.
Notifying a receptionist or another employee is not sufficient. Some departments maintain a “sick call”
telephone line for this purpose. It is our policy that you are to call in yourself unless you are physically
unable to do so because of an illness or emergency.
Employees should also consult with their supervisor and/or their union contract for departmental or union
procedures.
Excessive Absenteeism or Lateness
In general, five (5) absences in a 90-day period, or a consistent pattern of absence, may be considered
excessive, and the reasons for the absences may be reviewed. Coming in late or leaving early is as
detrimental to the City as a full day's absence. Three (3) such incidents in a 90-day period will be
considered a pattern and will carry the same weight as a full day's absence and may be reviewed as well.
Record of Absence or Lateness
Your attendance record will be considered when evaluating requests for promotions, transfers, leaves of
absence, approved time off, and other personnel actions. Be aware that excessive absenteeism, lateness
or leaving early may lead to disciplinary action, including possible dismissal.

EMAIL AND INTERNET USE
The City of Cambridge's computer networks are connected to the Internet and other on-line services in
order to allow City government to serve the public more efficiently and effectively. Accordingly, various
on-line capabilities are made available to designated City employees for legitimate, work-related
purposes.
Use of these capabilities is subject to the same management oversight and supervision as any other
employee activity. Failure to comply with defined policies on internet and on-line computer services use

From time to time, it may be necessary for you to be absent from work. We appreciate that emergencies,
illnesses, or pressing personal business that cannot be scheduled outside your work hours may arise.
Sick days and personal days have been provided for this purpose.

2.1.b

may result in termination, suspension, or other limitation of an employee's privileges for access to
Internet-related capabilities, and may be the cause for further discipline up to and including discharge.
For more specific information about what is permitted and what is prohibited, see your supervisor and
read the Computer Services Use Policy.

While it is sometimes necessary to conduct personal business during work hours, calls should be kept
short and to a minimum. Whenever possible, employees should make any personal calls during
designated break or lunch times.

DRESS AND APPEARANCE
The City of Cambridge expects its employees to dress in a manner appropriate to their profession. While
there is not one specified code of dress for the City, each department or union may have guidelines
stating what is acceptable. Ask your supervisor for specific requirements for your department.

DRUG/ALCOHOL POLICY
Being intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or any controlled substance while at work or on City
property is dangerous and grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. The use,
possession, or sale of alcohol or a controlled substance, in any quantity, while at work or on City
property is similarly grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
Counseling and Treatment
All employees who are, or feel they might be at risk for misuse of alcohol or controlled substances are
encouraged to make full use of the confidential counseling treatment and referral services of the City's
Employee Assistance Program (1-800-451-1834) and/or get help through his/her health plan.
Disciplinary Process
Disciplinary action taken by the City will be commensurate with the level of intoxication or impairment,
the individual employee's prior substance use history and/or employee record, and with the City's
commitment to the successful rehabilitation of employees who are also resolved to correct any substance
abuse problems they may have.
The City may exercise its right to test an employee for drugs and/or alcohol where the employee is
noticeably impaired in his or her job performance and/or where the facts are sufficient to constitute
reasonable suspicion of unauthorized use of alcohol and/or a controlled substance. Refusal to submit to
such testing will be considered insubordination, and grounds for discipline, up to and including
discharge. If you are a member of a union, please consult your union contract for more specific details
on reasonable suspicion testing.

DRIVER'S LICENSE AND DRIVING RECORD
Employees whose work requires operation of a motor vehicle must present and maintain a valid driver's
license and a driving record acceptable to the City. You will be asked to submit a copy of your driving
record to the City from time to time.
Any changes in your driving license status must be reported to your supervisor immediately. Failure to
do so may result in disciplinary action, including possible dismissal.

tobacco products during their designated breaks and/or lunchtime may not do so near entrances to City
buildings. Smokers must dispose of smoking materials properly.

2.1.b

EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Some rules of conduct are needed in any workplace in order to help everyone work together efficiently,
effectively, and harmoniously. Because our mission is to serve the public and because we are
empowered with substantial governmental authority to achieve that mission, we must hold ourselves to
high standards of quality service and ethical conduct.
By accepting employment with us, you have a responsibility to the public, to the City and to your fellow
employees to adhere to certain rules of behavior and conduct. The purpose of these rules is not to restrict
your rights, but rather to be certain that you understand what conduct is expected and necessary to fulfill
our mission, responsibilities, and duty to the public. When each person is aware that he or she can fully
depend upon fellow workers to follow the rules of conduct, then our organization will be a better place to
work and a more effective servant of the people.

MEETING JOB EXPECTATIONS
In addition to maintaining appropriate standards of conduct, it is the responsibility of employees to fulfill
the essential functions of their positions in an acceptable manner. Depending on the position, these
measures may be both qualitative and quantitative. Job requirements and qualifications are listed on job
postings/descriptions. Your supervisor will discuss and clarify the expectations and standards of your
position. Employees who are having difficulty meeting job standards should discuss the issue with their
supervisor. In turn, it is the supervisor's responsibility to monitor employee performance and provide
counseling, support, and assistance to employees in helping them meet job expectations.
Ultimately, if employees are unable to meet job requirements, corrective action may include
reassignment, transfer, demotion or other disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR UNACCEPTABLE ACTIVITIES
Generally speaking, we expect each person to act in a mature and responsible way at all times. However,
to avoid any possible confusion, some of the more obvious unacceptable activities are noted below.
Your avoidance of these activities will be to your benefit as well as the benefit of the City. If you have
any questions concerning any work or safety rule, or any of the unacceptable activities listed, please see
your supervisor for an explanation.
We list these standards for the guidance of all employees and supervisors. We do not expect anyone to
engage in these activities, but we believe everyone is served by our being clear as to what is not
acceptable.

Unacceptable behavior or unsatisfactory work performance that does not lead to dismissal may be dealt
with in any of the following ways:
Oral or Written Warning;
Unpaid Suspension;
Demotion; Reduction in Pay; Delays or Cancellations of Pay Increases
Oral warnings serve as notice to the employee that certain inappropriate behaviors have been observed
and/or that work performance does not meet expectations. Employees are strongly encouraged to pay
close attention to such warnings and to behave and perform in a manner consistent with their supervisor's
expectations and which conforms with the City's standards of appropriate work conduct.

8. Creating or contributing to unsanitary conditions.

2.1.b

In any interview where discipline of the employee is contemplated as a possible result, a unionized
employee may request the presence of a union steward or other union representative. Non-union
employees may request the presence of another non-union employee.
Department heads and certain designated supervisors have the authority to suspend an employee for up to
five days without pay. Discipline in excess of a five-day suspension (including demotion) may only be
taken by the City Manager.
Before any disciplinary action is taken, all pertinent facts will be carefully reviewed. If circumstances
warrant, and consistent with civil service law where appropriate, the employee will be given an
opportunity to explain his or her conduct before any final decision is reached. The City Manager or
designee will provide an employee in a budgeted position an opportunity to be heard concerning the
unacceptable behavior before contemplated dismissal occurs.
The City recognizes the value of obtaining the commitment of employees to work to correct any
disciplinary/behavioral problems that are interfering with their performance. Therefore in many
circumstances the City will seek to reach agreement with the employee as to the appropriate level of
discipline, the expectations for the employee for future behavior, and the consequences of meeting or
failing to meet those expectations. In the unlikely event that you have violated any of these standards of
conduct, we encourage your willingness to settle the matter, including a real commitment to correct the
problem.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Most union contracts provide for a grievance procedure to resolve disputes arising out of interpretation or
application of the collective bargaining agreement. Non-union employees may also air grievances and
are encouraged to do so in order to resolve disputes, clarify work practices and benefits, and bring to the
attention of management any problems that need to be solved.
A non-union employee who feels aggrieved should raise the matter first with his or her direct supervisor.
If, after a thorough discussion, the problem remains unresolved, the employee may pursue it by filing a
written summary of the problem and a request for a meeting with the department head. If the problem
remains unresolved after meeting with the department head, the employee should file a written request
for a meeting with the Personnel Department, outlining the problem. A representative from the
Personnel Department, acting as the designee of the City Manager, will meet with the employee and
representatives of the department together or separately as appears most appropriate to help solve the
problem. Although it is clear that not all such disputes will be resolved in favor of the employee, every
effort will be made to reach a fair and equitable result that can be understood and accepted by all parties.

Written warnings will include the reasons for the supervisor's dissatisfaction and any supporting
evidence. You will have an opportunity to defend your actions and rebut the opinion of your supervisor
at the time the warning is issued. You may also submit a written statement for your personnel files.

2.1.b

Allegations of violations of the Affirmative Action Plan, Equal Employment Policies, and/or the Sexual
Harassment Policy should be submitted for resolution according to the terms of those policies.

As a public agency, it is very important that City employees take extraordinary care to be sure that they
do not take official actions that either are or may give the appearance of being improperly influenced by
personal gain or benefit. Personal or business transactions with outside individuals or organizations with
whom you conduct business on behalf of the City create the potential for such conflict. Accepting gifts
or gratuities from persons who do business with the City is always inappropriate. Accepting gifts in
excess of $50 value has been determined by the State Ethics Commission to violate the State Ethics Law.
If you are concerned about whether a particular course of action may generate such a conflict or the
appearance of one, consult with your supervisor or the Law Department at (617) 349-4121 or (617) 3494242 (TTY).

OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
What you do on your free time is generally your own business. However, if you are employed by the
City of Cambridge in a full-time position, the City will expect that your position here is your primary
employment. Any outside activity must not interfere with your ability to properly perform your job
duties for the City of Cambridge, or present a conflict of interest.
If you are thinking of taking on a second job, or doing private consulting, confer with your supervisor
before doing so. He or she will thoroughly discuss this opportunity with you to make sure that it will not
interfere with your job for the City nor pose a conflict of interest.

HARASSMENT POLICY
It is essential that the City of Cambridge provide a work environment that is pleasant, healthful,
comfortable, and free from intimidation, hostility or other offenses that might interfere with work
performance. Harassment of any sort — spoken, written, physical, visual — will not be tolerated.
What Is Harassment?
Harassment can take many forms. It may be, but is not limited to: words, signs, jokes, pranks,
intimidation, physical contact, or violence. Harassment is not necessarily sexual in nature. Any action
which is verbally or physically intimidating, coercive, or creates a hostile work environment will be
viewed as harassment. If you believe you have been subject to harassing behavior, contact your
supervisor immediately. If you are reluctant to discuss the matter with your supervisor, you may refer
the matter to any of the individuals or departments outlined in the Reporting section below.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment is of particular concern in the work place. Not only is it destructive of workplace
harmony and teamwork, it is discriminatory and will not be tolerated. Sexually harassing conduct may
include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any other verbal or physical contact of
a sexual nature that prevents an individual from effectively performing the duties of his/her position or
creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment, or when such conduct is made a
condition of employment or compensation, either implicitly or explicitly. Sexually harassing conduct
may be harassment by a man towards a woman, a woman towards a man, or between persons of the
same sex. The harasser does not necessarily have to be the victim’s supervisor. The victim does not
necessarily have to be the one to whom the remarks or conduct are directed, but may be someone whose
ability to work is adversely affected by an intimidating or hostile working environment created by the
behavior of others. The harasser or the victim could be a member of the public who comes in contact
with a City employee.
Reporting Responsibility
You should be provided with a copy of the City’s policy on dealing with sexual harassment shortly after
being hired. If you have not received it, ask your supervisor to supply it to you. All City of Cambridge
employees, particularly managers, have a responsibility for keeping our work environment free of
harassment. Any employee who becomes aware of an incident of harassment, whether by witnessing the
incident or being told of it, must report it to their immediate supervisor or any management
representative with whom they feel comfortable. When management becomes aware that harassment
might exist, it is obligated by law to take prompt and appropriate action, whether or not the victim wants
the City of Cambridge to do so.
Reporting Process
Any incident of harassment must be immediately reported to your supervisor or special management
representative. Each Department in the City has a Sexual Harassment Coordinator with responsibility for
handling an investigation or referring it to the Human Rights Commission of the City for investigation.
You may ask that person for assistance. Appropriate investigation and disciplinary action will be taken.
All reports will be promptly investigated with due regard for the privacy of everyone involved. Any
employee found to have harassed a fellow employee or subordinate will be subject to disciplinary action
including possible discharge. The City of Cambridge will also take any additional action necessary to
appropriately remedy the situation. No adverse employment action will be taken against any employee
making a good faith report of alleged harassment. If, for any reason, you are uncomfortable or reluctant
to raise a matter of harassment within your department, questions or complaints may also be directed to
the Women’s Commission (617) 349-4697 or (617) 492-0235 (TTY); Affirmative Action Director (617)
349-4331 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY); City Manager or Deputy City Manager (617) 349-4300 or (617)
349-4242 (TTY); or to the Personnel Director (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY).
The individual who makes unwelcome advances, threatens, or in any way harasses another employee
may be personally liable for such actions and their consequences.

2.1.b

2.1.b

All complaints will be handled by City employees in confidence in a manner which respects your
wishes for confidentiality, consistent with the City's need to investigate, and, if warranted, take
corrective action. All complaints need to be investigated, thus complete confidentiality cannot always
be assured. Any complainant concerned about confidentiality should discuss that matter with the
individual with whom the complaint is filed. If you believe that you have been the victim of sexual
harassment, then you owe it to yourself and to your co-workers to report the matter and to allow the
City to ensure that the working environment of the City is free from sexual harassment.

EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
The City of Cambridge has a long standing record of nondiscrimination in employment and providing
equal opportunity without regard to race, color, sex, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, disability, Vietnam era veteran’s status, marital status or age. The City is an Affirmative
Action/Equal Opportunity employer. The City regularly updates its Affirmative Action Plan for
compliance with state and federal regulations and to articulate and communicate its strongly held
commitment to Affirmative Action.
This policy applies to all areas of employment, including recruitment, hiring, training and development,
promotion, transfer, termination, layoff, compensation, benefits, and all other conditions and privileges
of employment in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws.
Equal employment opportunity notices are posted on appropriate employee bulletin boards as required
by law. The notices summarize the rights of employees to equal opportunity in employment and list the
names and addresses of the various government agencies that may be contacted in the event that any
person believes he or she has been discriminated against.
The City’s Director of Affirmative Action is available for consultation regarding Affirmative
Action concerns. The telephone number for the Director of Affirmative Action is (617) 349-4331
or (617) 349-4242 (TTY).
Management is primarily responsible for seeing that the City's affirmative action and equal employment
opportunity policies are implemented, but all employees of the City share in the responsibility for
assuring that by their personal actions the policies are effective and apply uniformly to everyone.
Any employee, including managers, involved in intentionally discriminatory practices will be subject to
discharge.

DIVERSITY
The City places high value on diversity and on ensuring that City employees are representative of the
multi-cultural community we serve. We provide support and encouragement to employees interested
in exploring diversity issues. The City and the services we provide are strengthened by a diverse
workforce. Appreciating and celebrating that diversity is important to our collective success, as we
discover our similarities and differences. The City provides diversity training for all employees.
There are several committees that provide leadership in diversity awareness efforts. The Employees
Committee on Diversity, a volunteer group open to all City employees, meets regularly to discuss
ways we can recognize, enhance, and celebrate the diversity of the City's employees and our
community. Through its Educational Subcommittee it encourages all City employees to engage in
informal dialogue and structured activities to expand awareness, sensitivity, and acceptance of

It is the policy of the City of Cambridge to:

2.1.b

diversity within our work force. All employees are encouraged to participate. Call the Personnel
Department at 349-4332 to find out more about upcoming activities.

Job Posting
The City posts virtually every job opening we seek to fill in order to give internal candidates the
opportunity to be considered. Job postings are available for your review on bulletin boards located in the
City Hall lobby, outside the Personnel Office, all Cambridge Public Libraries, and in most City
buildings. The postings are also listed on the City's internal website.

Internal Transfers, including promotions
We encourage you to pursue transfer and/or advancement within the City by responding to job postings
that may be of interest to you. Meet with your supervisor, department head, and/or representatives of the
Personnel Department to discuss what steps you can take to improve your opportunities for job growth
and promotion. Of course, in filling all positions, managers look for an excellent work history, good
attendance, and a positive record of cooperation and teamwork.
Special Guidelines
The City Manager reserves the right to issue special employment guidelines as the need arises for
such guidelines, based on organizational priorities. Department heads will be issued these guidelines
as they are developed.

PROOF OF U.S. CITIZENSHIP OR RIGHT TO WORK
Federal regulations require that all new hires complete and sign Federal Form I-9, Employment
Eligibility and Verification Form and present documents of identity and eligibility to work in the U.S.
As noted on the I-9 Form, this information must be supplied within three (3) days of hire.

INTRODUCTORY PERIOD
For most civil service or unionized employees your first six (6) or, in limited cases, twelve (12) months
of employment with the City of Cambridge are considered a Probationary Period. For “at will”
employees this is generally regarded as an “Introductory” Period. At will employees are those who serve
at the pleasure of the City Manager. Absent civil service status or other specific procedural protections
(such as a "just cause" clause in a union contract ), at-will employees serve without tenure, and the City
reserves the right to terminate their services with legal reason or for not reason at all.

THE HIRING PROCESS

2.1.b

This Introductory Period is considered a try-out time for both you, as an employee, and the City of
Cambridge, as an employer. During this Introductory Period, your supervisor will evaluate your
suitability for employment in your position. At any time during this first six (6) months, you may resign
without any detriment to your record. If, during this period, your work habits, attitude, attendance or
performance do not measure up to our standards, we may release you, or extend the probationary period
for up to two months. If you take approved time off during this period, the Introductory Period may be
extended by that length of time.
Near the end of the Introductory Period, your supervisor will discuss your job performance with you.
This review will be much the same as the normal job performance review that is held for many regular
full-time or part-time employees on an annual basis. During the course of the discussion, you are
encouraged to share your comments and ideas as well.
Please understand that completion of the Introductory Period does not guarantee continued employment
for any specified period of time, nor does it require that an employee be discharged only for "cause." If
you have further questions concerning the Introductory Period, contact the Personnel Department at 3494332.

JOB DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER PLANNING
The City recognizes that many employees want to experience growth and change in job
responsibilities, even within a current position. Dialogue between supervisors and subordinates
regarding skill development for one's current position and future career interests, is strongly
encouraged. The City has a number of programs in place to assist employees in gaining access to
resources designed to help meet their career development goals.
Mandatory Training
There are some courses that all new employees are required to attend within one year of their hire date.
Presently, these courses are "Preventing Sexual Harassment" and "Diversity Training." The City may
add to the required training list as business or environmental needs dictate. Also, many departments
require additional training for their staff. Your supervisor will advise you regarding training required for
your position.

22

Packet Pg. 32

Attachment: employee_orientation_manual_w_Feb_2020 (COF 2020 #69 : Materials for discussion)

The Introductory Period is a time for getting to know your fellow employees, your managers and
supervisor, the tasks involved in your job, as well as becoming familiar with the City's procedures and
services. Your supervisor will work closely with you to help you understand the needs and processes of
your job.

2.1.b

The City encourages employees to improve their job-related skills by attending in-service training
programs that are offered periodically on or off site. Courses are offered regularly in the areas of
general business skills development, computer skills, management training, and health and lifestyles.
These are listed in the City's monthly Training Calendar. If there are particular areas in which you
believe you would benefit from additional training, discuss the matter with your supervisor. Although
not all requests can be accommodated, every effort will be made to tailor training to particular
departmental and individual needs.
Tuition Assistance
The City sponsors a limited tuition assistance program for full-time employees and those working in
regular positions budgeted at twenty (20) hours per week or more. Each fiscal year managerial and
non-union employees may receive tuition reimbursement or advance payment up to $1000 for
courses taken at any accredited college or university that are job or degree related, pre-approved for
payment, and successfully completed. This program may be different or not available to some
unionized employees. Contact the Personnel Department at 349-4338 for more details.
Scholarships and Additional Resources for Education
Several local colleges offer special programs to aid City of Cambridge employees in furthering their
education:


Harvard University provides three scholarships per term to City employees to attend the Harvard
Extension School, in memory of the late Mayor Leonard J. Russell. Applications for the program
are made directly to Harvard University. The Personnel Department sends out notifications when
applications are available.



Lesley College offers a 10% reduction in tuition rates for City of Cambridge employees.



A partnership between the City of Cambridge, the Cambridge Public Schools, and Bunker Hill
Community College brings affordable college level courses to the City. Courses are offered at
Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School.

EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES OR PARTNERS
If you and members of your immediate family are employed by the City of Cambridge, one may not
supervise the other. If the employees and the department head are unable to develop a workable solution,
the City Manager will decide which employee may be transferred in such situations. For purposes of this
section, your immediate family includes your spouse or domestic partner, your children, your siblings,
your parents, your grandparents, and your spouse's or domestic partner’s children, siblings, parents and

grandparents. Should two current employees, one of whom supervises the other, enter into a personal,
non-work related relationship, one or both employees may have to be transferred.

A central file for each employee is maintained in the Personnel Office. Information in the files is
considered and treated as confidential. An employee has the right to examine his/her own file, upon
request and after reasonable notice to the Personnel Department.

SEPARATION FROM EMPLOYMENT
If you decide to resign, you are expected to give notification to your manager in a time frame that allows
for a reasonable transition. Non-exempt employees generally should give at least two week's notice,
exempt employees should give at least four weeks. Non-exempt employees are those employees subject
to the wage and hour conditions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Exempt employees are those
employees not subject to the wage and hour conditions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (see section on
Overtime Pay for more details on exempt versus non-exempt status). You will be paid through your last
day worked and will be paid any accrued vacation, personal, administrative, compensatory time,
overtime and any other miscellaneous payments or deductions. You will also be mailed pertinent
information regarding insurance continuation through COBRA.
Exit Interviews
All employees who voluntarily leave City employment, whether through resignation or retirement, are
asked to participate in an exit interview with a member of the Personnel Department. We do this
because we want to hear from you and about your experience working for the City. Please arrange an
interview before your last day worked by calling the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or
(617) 349-4242 (TTY). Departments also may request that you have a final interview with a
department representative.
Requested Resignation or Discharge
If you fail to meet the City's standards for work performance, attendance, behavior, or fail to follow the
City's policies, you may be asked to resign or be discharged. Nothing in this section concerning
requested resignation or discharge should be construed to alter, amend or modify the at-will employment
relationship.
Death
If an employee dies while employed with the City, his or her family and beneficiaries are entitled to
collect earned salary and certain accrued benefits. In addition, an employee's surviving spouse and other
dependents who are covered under the City's health insurance plans may elect to continue their coverage
under the plan, through COBRA, for up to 36 months.

PERSONNEL FILES

2.1.b

Absent a signed release form from an employee, the City will respond to requests for employment
information by giving dates of employment only. Should you want your supervisor or other individuals
to provide a professional employment reference, prior to your leaving the employ of the City, you will
need to sign a release form authorizing the City to provide more detailed performance information.
Please see your supervisor or contact the Personnel Department to secure copies of the form.

COMPENSATION
WAGE AND SALARY POLICIES
To the extent permitted by the City’s fiscal condition, it is our desire to pay fair and equitable wages and
salaries that are competitive with other employers in the marketplace and that recognize group and
individual performance, in compliance with all applicable statutory requirements.
You are employed by the City of Cambridge and will be paid directly through our payroll. No person
may be paid out of petty cash or by vendor check. The only exception to this policy is where a contract
relationship exists with a bona fide contractor.
Basis for Determining Pay
Each City position has a pay range; the range has from one to ten steps depending on the position and
whether a union contract is involved. The rate of pay is determined based upon the nature and scope of
the job, length of service, experience, the pay of comparable positions within and outside the City, and
through collective bargaining for unionized positions.
Annual Increments
Generally new employees start at the first step of the pay range and move to the next step after one year
of service or, for part time employees, after they have completed the equivalent of one year of full time
service (1950 hours for 37.5 hour/week employees, 2080 hours for 40 hour/week employees). Based
upon experience or other special factors, the City Manager may approve a starting rate above the first
step. The City Manager also reserves the right to withhold a step increase based upon unsatisfactory job
performance. Some unions have slightly different increment rules.

PAY PERIOD AND CYCLE
Our payroll workweek begins on Sunday at 12:00 midnight and ends on Saturday at 11:59 p.m.

Release of Information and Employment References

2.1.b

Payday is normally on Thursday or Friday (depending on your department) for services performed for
the one (1) week period ending the previous Saturday at 11:59 p.m. Paychecks are usually available by
noon on your pay day.

Virtually every department has designated one or more persons as that department’s payroll
representative. The payroll representative is responsible for preparing the payroll and making any
adjustments that are required on a weekly basis. This representative can answer many questions that may
arise concerning pay. You should check with your supervisor to be clear whether the supervisor prefers
you to resolve payroll matters through the supervisor or directly with the payroll representative.

MANDATORY DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYCHECK
The City of Cambridge is required by law to make certain deductions from your paycheck each time one
is prepared. Among these are your federal and state income taxes. You will need to complete state and
federal tax forms, declaring your withholding status (e.g., married/single), and number of dependents for
withholding purposes. Under current law, new employees who qualify for membership in the Cambridge
Retirement System, also contribute 9% of regular wages to that fund (plus an additional 2% for wages in
excess of $30,000).
Any other mandatory deductions to be made from your paycheck, such as court-ordered attachments or
IRS liens, will be explained whenever the City is ordered to make such deductions.
Deductions are itemized on your check stub. Any change in name, address, telephone number, marital
status or number of exemptions must be reported to your supervisor immediately to ensure proper credit
for tax purposes. The W-2 form you receive for each year shows your taxable earnings, the amount of
taxes withheld, any taxable non-cash fringe benefits you have received, and any deductions that are tax
deferred.
Social Security, Medicare, and Mandatory Deferred Compensation
The City of Cambridge does not currently participate in the federal Social Security system for any Social
Security benefits except Medicare for those employees hired on or after April 1, 1986.
Employees hired on or after April 1, 1986 are required to contribute 1.45% of wages to Social Security as
a contribution to future Medicare eligibility. The City makes a matching contribution.
Employees who, by nature of their employment, (seasonal, emergency, under 20 hours per week), do not
qualify for membership in the Retirement System and are required to make a 7.5% contribution to a
mandatory deferred compensation plan, as an alternative to Social Security (FICA) contributions. You
may obtain more information about this program from your department payroll representative or the
Personnel Department.

2.1.b

Union Dues

ELECTIVE DEDUCTIONS / DIRECT DEPOSIT
It may be possible for you to authorize the City to make additional deductions from your paycheck, such
as for health and life insurance, charitable contributions, Cambridge Municipal Employees Credit Union,
a voluntary deferred compensation plan, flexible spending account, MBTA pass purchase, etc., and to
deposit your paycheck directly into your savings or checking account at a participating bank. Contact
your department payroll representative or the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 3494242 (TTY) for details and the necessary authorization forms.

TIME REPORTING
Many departments require employees to report on the time that they have worked in the previous
week, noting also time taken for vacation, personal, administrative, compensatory, or sick time. Your
supervisor will instruct you on the procedures for your department. In all cases, you are responsible
for accurately reporting time on your time sheets.

ERRORS IN PAY
Every effort is made to avoid errors in your paycheck. If you believe an error has been made, tell your
supervisor immediately. He or she will take the necessary steps to research the problem and to assure
that any necessary correction is made properly and as promptly as possible. If at all possible, do not cash
or deposit your paycheck if you find an error. Corrections can be made much more quickly if the check
has not been cashed.
Your pay stub also includes your current balances for vacation, sick, personal, administrative, birthday,
and compensatory time. If you believe these balances are not correct, contact your supervisor so the
records can be reviewed.

OVERTIME PAY
From time to time, it may be necessary for you to perform overtime work. All overtime must be
approved in advance by your supervisor. When it is necessary to work overtime, you are expected to
cooperate as a condition of your employment. Overtime pay is available only pursuant to union contracts
or Fair Labor Standards Act requirements. Those not eligible for overtime may be eligible for a limited
27

Packet Pg. 37

Attachment: employee_orientation_manual_w_Feb_2020 (COF 2020 #69 : Materials for discussion)

Union dues, or an agency fee, if you decide not to join the union, are deducted if you are hired into a
unionized position. Failure to agree to pay these fees can lead to the loss of employment.

2.1.b

If you are a "non-exempt" employee (that is, in a position subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act) and
you perform overtime work, you will be paid one and one-half (1½) times your regular hourly wage for
any time over forty (40) hours per week that you work. Certain union positions provide for overtime for
hours worked beyond the standard work day or after 37.5 hours per week.
Generally overtime will be paid in the paycheck following the pay period in which it was earned. Any
additional overtime pay owed as a result of differences in how the City computes standard overtime and
the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act will be paid quarterly.

COMPENSATORY TIME ACCRUAL AND USE
It is expected that managerial employees and many of those exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act
will be required to work significantly more than a “regular” 37.5 hour work week during much of the
year as part of their job responsibilities. In recognition of that, employees exempt from or not eligible for
overtime may be eligible for up to thirty-seven and one half (37.5) hours of compensatory time per
calendar year, on an hour for hour earnings basis. Extra hours worked beyond that time are not subject to
additional compensatory time, except to the extent that a supervisor may adjust an employee’s work
schedule during a particular week. The City Manager reserves the right to make exceptions to the thirtyseven and one half (37.5) hour limitation in special circumstances where, because of a particular project,
extraordinary additional work is required without the opportunity to use the compensatory time
accumulated. Compensatory time may not be carried over from one year to the next. Please review
compensatory time policies with your department supervisor. If you have additional questions, contact
the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY).

WORKERS' COMPENSATION
The Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Law is a no-fault insurance plan that is supervised by the
state. Costs for City employees are paid entirely by the City of Cambridge. This law is designed to
provide you with benefits for any injury that you may suffer in connection with your employment. If you
are injured at work, you are eligible to apply for Workers' Compensation.
You should notify your supervisor immediately if you are injured, no matter how minor the injury may
seem.
There is no accrual of vacation, sick, personal, administrative, or birthday time, or service time towards
increments, and employees are not eligible for holiday pay while you are on Workers' Compensation. To
supplement Workers' Compensation payments (60% of regular pay), employees may use sick time, up to
the level of full regular salary.
No deductions, including taxes, union dues, credit union contributions, and medical insurance, are taken
from Workers' Compensation payments. Employees are offered the opportunity to continue medical

amount of compensatory time during the calendar year. Check with your supervisor if you have
questions about your eligibility.

2.1.b

coverage at 12% of the full monthly cost. Because no deductions can be made from a workers’
compensation check, it is the employee’s responsibility to maintain separate, up to date insurance
payments to the City’s Personnel Department.

UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION
The City of Cambridge is an employer that participates in the Massachusetts Unemployment
Compensation system. If you become unemployed, you may be eligible for unemployment
compensation, under certain conditions, for a limited period of time. Unemployment compensation
provides temporary income for workers who have lost their jobs. To be eligible you must have earned a
certain amount and be willing and able to work. You should apply for benefits through your local State
Unemployment Office (the Department of Employment and Training). If you have questions, contact the
local office of the State Department of Employment and Training at (617) 626-6800.

BENEFITS
In addition to receiving an equitable salary and having the opportunity for professional development and
advancement, you may be eligible to enjoy other benefits that will enhance your job satisfaction. The
benefits program described here represents a very large investment by the City of Cambridge, and adds
substantially to the cost and value of your employment with the City.
A good benefits program is a solid investment by the City in its employees. It not only ensures the
loyalty of long-time capable employees, it also helps to attract talented newcomers who can help the City
grow and evolve to meet changing needs in the community. The City will periodically review the
benefits program and will make modifications as appropriate to the City's condition.

ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS
If you are a regular full-time employee in a budgeted position, you will enjoy all of the benefits described
in this manual as soon as you meet the eligibility requirements for each particular benefit.
Part-time employees in positions budgeted for at least twenty (20) hours per week are eligible for a
variety of benefits, on a pro rated basis.
Temporary, seasonal, and emergency employees and those in positions budgeted for less than twenty
(20) hours per week are not eligible for benefits. Some union contracts may have slightly different rules
regarding temporary, seasonal and emergency employees.

If you have questions, consult your supervisor, the Workers' Compensation Claims Manager (617) 3494125 or the Personnel Department (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY)) for assistance.

2.1.b

The City has a very generous sick leave program, compared to many employers. However, it is very
important for employees to carefully monitor sick leave use and to be sure they are using it only when
truly disabled from working because of sickness or injury. Because the City does not provide any short
term disability insurance, the only short term disability coverage many employees have is their
accumulated sick leave. Should an employee face catastrophic illness, a significant sick leave bank, built
up over years by avoiding casual sick leave use, can prevent significant financial hardship. All
employees are encouraged to remember that sick leave is only to be used under circumstances when the
employee is truly unable to come to work, as more fully described below.
To qualify for sick leave you must be a full-time employee or part-time employee in a position budgeted
for at least twenty (20) hours per week and have worked for six months. Time taken off before this will
be without pay.
At the completion of six months you are credited with seven and one half (7.5) days of sick leave for
future use. You then earn 1¼ sick days per month until you reach the following January 1. After that
point you will be credited with fifteen (15) sick days per calendar year, pro-rated for unpaid leave of
absence, no pay status, or time on workers' compensation.
For non union employees, sick days accumulate from year to year to a maximum of four hundred
(400) days. You are encouraged to accumulate your sick leave days for use in case of major or
catastrophic illness. If you have unused sick days available at the time of retirement, death, or loss of
employment due to layoff or elimination of position without fault on your part, up to four hundred
(400) of those days may be converted to cash. For non-union employees, the first 100 days are eligible
for buy-back at $50 per day. Days 101-200 are eligible for buy-back at $80 per day. Days 201-300 are
eligible for buy-back at $100 per day or 50% of the current daily rate, whichever is smaller (but no less
$80) and Days 301-400 are eligible for buy-back at $130 per day or 50% of the current daily rate,
whichever is smaller (but no less than $100). Employees may elect to receive these funds over three
years after retirement. This benefit does not apply to persons who leave employment voluntarily
before retirement or as a result of disciplinary action. Some union contracts provide different
benefits. Consult your supervisor or the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242
(TTY) for more information.
Sick leave is to be used for the following reasons only:


Personal illness or non-job related injury which leaves you unable to perform your work duties



To supplement workers' compensation payments up to the level of full regular salary



Attendance upon members of the employee’s immediate family whose illness requires the care of
such employee, provided that no more than seven (7) working days with pay will be granted to such
employee in any one calendar year, not to exceed earned sick time available. A doctor's note may be
required.

SICK TIME AND RETURN TO WORK



Enforced quarantine



Doctor’s visits which cannot be scheduled during off duty hours. A doctor’s note may be required.

If the absence is greater than five (5) successive days, or if there are repeated absences of shorter
duration, a statement from the employee's physician is required. Subsequent physicians' statements
may be required at the discretion of the Department Head. If the employee fails to submit a
physician's statement when requested, he/she will not receive sick pay for the days in question,
whether or not the employee has accumulated sick leave to his/her credit and may be subject to
disciplinary action.
Employees are also required to provide similar documentation when using sick leave to provide care
for an ill family member. Employees are allowed to use sick time for up to seven (7) working days
per calendar year for the unexpected, short-term care of a family member. If an employee requires
more than this allotted time, they may use vacation time or other accrued time, apply for a flexible
work schedule, or take a personal leave to attend to a long-term care situation, in compliance with the
Family/Medical Leave Act.
Consult your supervisor or the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for
more information.

Christmas Day
Floating Holiday (actual day determined each year)

The City follows the state calendar for holidays. Each fall the Personnel Department issues a list of
the specific dates each holiday is observed in the next year. Holidays that fall on Saturdays are
observed by the City on the proceeding Friday. Holidays that fall on Sunday are observed on the
following Monday.
If a holiday occurs during your scheduled vacation, the Holiday time will not be deducted from your
vacation entitlement.
In order to qualify for holiday pay, you must work or be paid standard hours (i.e. vacation time, etc)
for the scheduled workday immediately before and after the holiday. Only excused absences will be
considered exceptions to this policy.
You are not eligible to receive holiday pay when you are on no pay status, on an unpaid leave of
absence or on workers' compensation.
Part-time employees who are in positions budgeted for twenty (20) or more hours per week are
entitled to a pro-rated Holiday benefit. If the holiday is observed on a day they do not normally work,
part-time employees will receive extra pro-rated pay for that time.
Other Religious Observances
You may take time off to observe your religious holidays. If available, a full day of unused time (a
personal day, administrative day, a vacation day, or compensatory time) may be used for this purpose.
Otherwise the time off is without pay. Sick leave is not to be used for these purposes. You should
notify your supervisor as far in advance as practical.
Vacation
Vacation is a time for you to rest, relax, and pursue special interests. The City of Cambridge has
provided paid vacation leave as one of the many ways in which we show our appreciation for your
loyalty and continued service.
Regular full-time employees and part-time employees in positions budgeted for at least twenty (20)
hours per week are eligible for paid vacation. You are not eligible for paid vacation during your
Introductory Period. Nor are you eligible for paid vacation if you are a temporary, seasonal, or
emergency employee.

Holiday Policies

2.1.b

Every eligible employee will receive a vacation of not less than two (2) weeks with pay based upon
twelve months service. New hires in non union positions will be awarded one week of vacation leave
after six months of service, and earn a monthly accrual of .83 days for each month of work thereafter,
until the subsequent January 1, when they will be awarded two weeks of vacation time. Employees
are entitled to three (3) weeks vacation after five (5) years of service; four (4) weeks vacation after ten
(10) years of service; and five (5) weeks vacation after twenty (20) years of service. In each instance
the additional week is awarded upon attaining the fifth, tenth, or twentieth year anniversary of service,
taking into account any periods of unpaid leave, no pay status, or Workers' Compensation.
There is no accrual of vacation, sick, or personal time, or service time towards increments for periods
of no-pay status or time on Workers' Compensation. In computing vacation time, employees shall be
credited for all continuous time worked, including temporary service, during which they worked a
minimum of twenty (20) hours per week.
Vacation Scheduling
Every effort will be made to grant you your vacation at the time you desire. However, vacations
cannot interfere with your department's operation and therefore should be requested and approved by
your supervisor at least one (1) month in advance. Some departments may require more advance
notice for scheduling purposes. If any conflicts arise in requests for vacation time, department
managers will attempt to resolve the conflicts in an equitable manner.
Accumulation Rights
Because vacations are intended for rest, relaxation, and the opportunity to regenerate, they are meant
to be taken during the year they are credited. Vacation time may not be carried over and accumulated
in subsequent calendar years except in unusual circumstances. Under such circumstances, the City
Manager may authorize the carryover of some unused vacation to the next calendar year. Only the
City Manager has the authority to approve such carryover. Vacation time that is not used or approved
for carryover will be forfeited.
Some union contracts provide a somewhat different eligibility formula and accumulation system.
Contact the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) if you have questions.
Personal Days
As a regular full-time employee, or a part-time employee in a position budgeted at twenty (20) hours
a week or more, you are eligible, after 6 months of service, for two (2) days of paid personal leave
during each calendar year. You may use your personal leave in units of no less than two hours at any
one time. Personal leave time is intended to be used to accomplish personal business that cannot be
accomplished during time other than your normal working hours. You are required to request

Amount of Vacation

2.1.b

personal leave time from your supervisor in advance and obtain his or her approval. Personal time
must be used in the year it is awarded. It is not eligible for carryover to the next year.
You are not eligible for personal days if you are a temporary, seasonal or emergency employee.

Regular full-time and part time employees in positions budgeted for at least twenty (20) hours per
week are entitled to one Administrative Day after a six month period in which they had no incidents
of no pay status and missed no work for illness, or job related injury, up to a maximum of two (2)
such days in any twelve (12) month period. Administrative days must be used within six (6) months
of being earned and cannot be carried over or converted to cash. Some union contracts provide a
slightly different benefit.
You are not eligible for administrative days if you are a temporary, seasonal or emergency employee.
Bereavement Leave
Employees who suffer the death of a close relative or household member may be granted a leave of
absence with pay for a limited number of days. Most employees receive up to five calendar days
leave in the case of the death of a spouse, child, a parent, or domestic partner. They also qualify for
up to three days for the death of a grandparent, brother, sister, grandchild, son or daughter-in-law,
parent-in-law, or any other relative who was a permanent member of the employee’s household or
with whom the employee made his or her home. A one day leave is also granted to attend the funeral
of a first cousin, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, or a spouse’s grandparent,
brother-in-law or sister-in-law. If an employee needs additional time beyond that which is allowed for
bereavement leave, other leave time may be made available and used. Some union contracts provide
a slightly different benefit. Consult your supervisor, or the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332
or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more information.
Jury Duty
We recognize it is your civic duty to report for jury duty whenever called. If you are called to report
for possible jury duty, notify your supervisor immediately. We will authorize you to take the
necessary time off and we wish to help you avoid any financial loss because of such service. The
City will reimburse you for the difference between your jury pay and your regular pay for each day of
Jury Duty that prevents you from reporting for a regularly scheduled work day.
Emergency Weather Conditions
Many City employees are essential to provide public services during periods of severe weather or
other emergencies. The need for such employees at work under these conditions is most urgent and it
is required that every effort be made to report for duty. Occasionally the City Manager may authorize

Administrative Days

skeleton staffing for part of or, more rarely, a full day. Such a skeleton arrangement is only for office
workers and other non-essential personnel, to ease transportation difficulties in the City and
surrounding areas. Department managers should rotate these skeleton assignments equitably among
staff. Without a special determination by the City Manager that you are not required to come to work
on a particular day because of weather related difficulties, your absence from work on that day will be
without pay, unless vacation or personal leave is available to cover the absence. Use of sick leave in
these circumstances is not appropriate.

UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Occasionally, for medical, personal, or other reasons, you may need to be temporarily released from
the duties of your job with the City, but may not wish to submit your resignation. Under certain
circumstances, you may be eligible for an unpaid leave of absence. There are several types of unpaid
leave for which you may be eligible.
Family/Medical Leave of Absence
In general, a leave of absence is an official authorization to be absent from work without pay for a
specified period of time. Eligible employees may be entitled to job-protected family or medical
leaves of absence if they are unable to come to work due to pressing family or medical concerns as
described under the following Family/Medical Leave Policy, which will be administered in
accordance with applicable State and Federal laws:
1. Employees are eligible if they have been actively employed for 12 months, and worked at least
1250 hours (an average of 25 hours per week) during those 12 months.
2. Each eligible employee may use up to a total of 12 weeks of family leave during any one calendar
year period.
3. A family leave will be granted upon the serious illness of the employee's child, spouse, domestic
partner, or parent.
4. While on a leave of absence to care for a family member as provided for under this policy, we will
continue your group health and life insurance benefits under the same terms as provided to other
employees, for up to a maximum of 12 weeks leave time during any one year period. If your
leave extends beyond 12 weeks, you will be offered the opportunity to purchase continuing
coverage at 100% of the monthly premium cost.
5. A medical leave will be granted upon the employee's own disabling serious illness after paid sick
leave is exhausted. The City reserves the right to limit this leave consistent with federal and state
law.
6. For medical leaves of absence due to the employee’s medical condition, group health and life
insurance coverage will continue on the same basis it is provided to other employees (e.g., with
35

2.1.b

2.1.b

12% employee share of health insurance premiums) for so long as the employee remains disabled
from work and on approved leave.

Employees who do not meet the criteria set forth in Number 1 above but who have completed their
Introductory Period and who are in positions budgeted at twenty (20) or more hours a week, are also
eligible for leave under slightly different terms. Consult the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332
or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more information and/or to obtain further information on the paperwork
needed for leave approval.
Personal/Educational Leave
Depending upon the work record of the requesting employee and its impact on the department, the
City may be willing to consider a limited leave of absence for employees for personal or educational
reasons. Such leaves are not routinely granted because of their impact on departmental operations.
Thus they may be limited to employees with exemplary work records. If you are planning such a
request, discuss it with your supervisor. All leave requests must be approved by the department head
and the City Manager.
Small Necessities Leave Act
Eligible employees may be entitled to twenty-four (24) hours of unpaid leave per calendar year to
attend school appointments for children and medical and dental appointments for children and elderly
relatives, or other professional services related to elder care, in accordance with State and Federal
laws:
1. Employees are eligible if they have been actively employed for 12 months, and have worked at
least 1250 hours (an average of 25 hours per week) during those 12 months;
2. Each eligible employee may use up to 24 hours of leave during any one calendar year period;
3. A "child" is a biological, adopted, or foster child, or a stepchild or legal ward or a child of a
person standing in loco parentis to the child. The child must be under 18 years of age or over 18
years but incapable of self-care;
4. An "elderly relative" is someone at least 60 years old who is related by blood or marriage to the
employee;
5. An employee is required to provide certification for leave requested under this Act. Certification
forms are available from the personnel department.
36

Packet Pg. 46

Attachment: employee_orientation_manual_w_Feb_2020 (COF 2020 #69 : Materials for discussion)

7. Other accumulated fringe benefits such as seniority, retirement, service credits, sick pay, vacation
pay, etc., will be preserved at the level earned as of commencement of the leave, but will not
accrue further during any such unpaid leave period.

2.1.b

Consult with the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more
information and/or to obtain information on documentation procedures needed for Small Necessities
Leave.

MILITARY LEAVE
The City grants Military Leaves of Absence pursuant to the provisions and requirements of federal
and state law to employees who are ordered to military service for either Military Training Leave or
Military Service Leave. The Military Training Leave normally should not exceed 17 days annually.
The Military Service Leave generally does not exceed four years. Contact the Personnel Department
if you are interested in more details about this program.

MATERNITY/PATERNITY LEAVES OF ABSENCE
It is the policy of the City of Cambridge to grant a leave of absence for pregnancy, childbirth, and
parenting to its eligible employees in order to continue the employment relationship through a period
of pregnancy, recovery from childbirth, care and nurturing of the newborn and upon adoption. In
order to encourage the continuation of the employment relationship and assist the family, the City has
established the following policies:
1. All employees actively employed for twelve (12) months who have worked at least 1250 hours
(an average of twenty-five (25) hours per week) are eligible for a maternity/paternity leave of up
to six (6) months after childbirth or adoption.
2. Upon expiration of said leave, the employee will be reinstated to the former job title held so long
as that position still exists. Depending upon the circumstances, the particular assignment cannot
be guaranteed.
3. Such leave may be taken any time following the sixth month of pregnancy, or at any time as
specified by the employee’s physician.
4. The prospective mother may use accumulated vacation and personal leave time during such leave.
In the case of pregnancy she may also use up to eight (8) weeks of accumulated sick leave, during
the disability portion of maternity leave, i.e. the first eight (8) weeks. If the disability portion of
the leave is longer than eight (8) weeks, then a physician’s statement certifying continuing
disability must be submitted, and additional accumulated sick leave may be taken. In the case of
adoption, up to seven (7) days of sick leave may be taken.
5. The prospective father may use accumulated vacation and personal leave time and up to a
maximum of seven (7) accrued sick leave days during the leave.
37

Packet Pg. 47

Attachment: employee_orientation_manual_w_Feb_2020 (COF 2020 #69 : Materials for discussion)

6. Small Necessities Leave time is in addition to time provided by the Family/Medical Leave Act. If
available, and with the approval of your supervisor, personal or compensatory time may be used
for these purposes in blocks of two (2) hours or more.

2.1.b

7. Similar to other leaves, failure to return to work upon the expiration of a maternity or paternity
leave will be considered to be a voluntary termination severing employment and benefit rights,
unless the employee has received a written extension prior to the expiration date.
8. Other accumulated fringe benefits such as seniority, retirement, service credits, sick pay, vacation
pay, etc., will be preserved at the level earned as of commencement of the leave, but will not
accrue further during any such unpaid leave period.
Employees who do not meet the criteria set forth in Number 1 above but who have completed their
Introductory Period and who are in regular positions budgeted for at least twenty (20) hours per week
are also eligible for a maternity or paternity leave of up to six (6) months under slightly different
terms regarding health and life insurance. Consult the Personnel Department at 349-4332 for more
information and/or to obtain further information on the paperwork needed for leave approval.

REINSTATEMENT AFTER LEAVES OF ABSENCE
If you fail to return to work on the designated date, your employment will be ended as an employee
initiated separation.

HEALTH CARE COVERAGE
The City offers very comprehensive health coverage benefits to qualified employees, at very
competitive rates. Questions about the plans and procedures should be directed to the Personnel
Department at (617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY).
New employees have thirty (30) calendar days from their date of hire to sign up for health insurance
benefits, which may be either a health insurance plan or the health insurance waiver if eligible.
Failure to do so will make you ineligible to enroll for health coverage until the next open enrollment
period.
The City will pay 88% of the cost of the City health coverage for you, and 88% of the cost of
coverage of your eligible dependents. You pay 12% of the cost through payroll deduction. Your
payments toward your health insurance premiums are made on a pre-tax basis, and thus do not count
toward taxable income.
Dependents are covered by signing up for a family plan. Dependents include your spouse and
children who are under age nineteen (19) and full-time students under age twenty-five (25). Adding
38

Packet Pg. 48

Attachment: employee_orientation_manual_w_Feb_2020 (COF 2020 #69 : Materials for discussion)

6. The employee will be responsible for the regular employee share of any health and life insurance
plans during the disability portion of the leave and the first twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave.
For leave in excess of twelve (12) unpaid weeks the employee will be responsible for 100% of the
cost of the plans.

2.1.b

The City currently offers several Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) as our primary health
coverage options. These plans provide comprehensive, first dollar coverage (i.e., no or low
deductibles and co-pays) through special networks of some of the finest doctors, hospitals and other
providers in the state and region, without waiting periods or pre-existing condition limitations.
We also offer, as a health insurance option, a policy of major medical and surgical coverage.
Although this plan is less expensive to the employee, coverage is very limited, compared to coverage
provided by the HMO’s. We do not recommend this coverage except for someone prepared to pay a
significant amount of money out of pocket for health care.
Detailed information about each of the offered plans is available from the Personnel Department, at
(617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) or the Payroll Representative in your department.
Payments in Lieu of Health Coverage
Some employees may have health insurance coverage through another employer, spouse, or other
means. If you have alternative coverage, not paid or sponsored by the City, and you wish to waive
City coverage, we will pay you a stipend (non-union stipend is $1000, unionized employees should
consult their collective bargaining agreement for current amount), as a payment in lieu of health
coverage. This allows you more flexibility in selecting the benefits you need and may prevent the
City from wasting money on unnecessary, duplicate coverage. Should the alternative coverage be lost
through no fault of your own during the year, you may elect to join one of our plans, without waiting
for open enrollment, and without waiting periods or preexisting condition limitations to the maximum
extent allowed by law.
Employees whose alternative coverage is paid through the City of Cambridge are not eligible for the
waiver.
Open Enrollment
Once you select a health carrier, you keep that coverage until the next open enrollment period,
generally in late January or early February. At that time you may decide to switch to another plan,
drop coverage if appropriate, or enroll for coverage if not currently covered. If you are satisfied with
your coverage, you need do nothing; coverage will continue. Changes are effective April 1.
Continuation of Coverage (COBRA)
In the event of termination of your employment with the City or loss of eligibility to remain covered
under our group health insurance program, you and your eligible dependents may have the right
(under federal COBRA legislation) to continued coverage under our health insurance program for a
39

Packet Pg. 49

members to the plan can be done by notifying the Personnel Department of the change within thirty
(30) days of the event (e.g., the birth of a child, marriage)

2.1.b

limited period of time at your or their own expense. (This does not affect any conversion to nongroup coverage that may be provided under your health policy). Consult the Personnel Department at
(617) 349-4337or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for details.

The City provides Long Term Disability (LTD) insurance to most managerial and non-union
employees budgeted for 20 or more hours per week. The coverage is provided at no cost to the
employee and provides a 60% wage replacement benefit (up to $6000 per month) for employees
totally disabled from work due to a non-job related disability, after a minimum six month waiting
period and after sick leave benefits are exhausted. Benefits end upon recovery, retirement, or upon
reaching age 65. Consult the Personnel Department for more information about the coverage.

DENTAL AND VISION
Dental and Vision benefits are available though the City’s Public Employees Dental and Vision Fund,
with some exceptions. The City provides insurance for routine dental care and subsidizes more
extensive services such as orthodontics through Guardian Dental Insurance, in cooperation with a
joint labor management trust plan. Limited reimbursement for vision examinations, lens, and frames
is also available through the Dental and Vision Fund. Eligibility is restricted to regular full time
employees and their families. The City currently pays $14 per week, and employees pay $1 per week
for the cost of coverage. Employees must complete enrollment forms within 30 days of hire.
Eligibility, employee cost, and plan coverage may be different for employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Please contact the benefits office at (617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242
(TTY), or the Plan Administrator of the Public Employees Dental & Vision Fund at (617) 354-1110 if
you have questions about your dental and vision coverage.
Employees who receive benefits through a Teamsters collective bargaining agreement should call
TeamstersCare at (617) 241-9220 for an explanation of benefits.

EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The City sponsors an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for full-time employees and their
families. This is a program of confidential, (to the extent permitted by law), professional short-term
counseling and referral for employees and family members who are experiencing difficulty in their
personal or work lives. Counseling is available for a wide range of problems including addictions,
alcohol, anxiety or depression, child care/elder care issues, domestic violence, family conflicts,
financial difficulties, gambling, grieving, stress, work conflicts, and other personal problems.
Counseling is provided by outside professionals who contract with the City to provide confidential
assistance. The EAP and the City regularly send out information about our program so that you can
contact them confidentially. The EAP can be reached on a 24-hour basis at 1-800-451-1834. You can

also call the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) with questions
regarding the EAP.

The City offers most regular employees the opportunity to set aside a limited amount of money each
calendar year on a pre tax basis, to pay for medical expenses not covered by health insurance (e.g.,
co-payments, glasses, hearing aids, etc.), or for qualified expenses in dependent (e.g., child or elder)
care. For employees who can anticipate and plan for such expenses annually, this plan allows
reimbursement for those expenses from wages, which are not subject to taxation after being set aside
through payroll deduction for this purpose. Employees are cautioned to make a realistic assessment
of expenses anticipated for reimbursement each year, because, pursuant to federal tax rules, any funds
set aside for which there is no expense to qualify for reimbursement may not be refunded to the
employee. Those monies are lost to the employee and revert to the City. Contact the Personnel
Department at (617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more details.

LIFE INSURANCE
If you are a regular full-time employee of the City, or a part-time employee in a position budgeted for
twenty (20) or more hours a week, you are eligible to be covered by our Group Life Insurance. This
insurance is payable in the event of your death from any cause, at any time or place, while you are
insured. Payment will be made in a lump sum or in installments to the beneficiary, as designated by
you. You may change your beneficiary whenever you wish by submitting the appropriate documents
to the Personnel Department.
The City offers a $5,000 Basic Group Term Life Insurance plan for which the City pays 75% of the
premium. New employees must enroll within thirty (30) days of hire. The City also offers Optional
Term life insurance coverage up to your base salary minus $2,000 with a maximum of $74,000, at
100% employee pay. This plan is not portable and terminates at age 75. Contact the Personnel
Department at (617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more information.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The City provides employees with access to a Deferred Compensation Plan which allows employees
to invest a portion of their wages through payroll deduction on a tax deferred basis in a variety of
investment vehicles such as stock and bond mutual funds, guaranteed accumulation accounts, and
money market funds. The purpose for this plan is to provide supplemental savings for retirement
only. The plan should not be used for general savings or as a reserve against unanticipated expenses,
as there may be significant restrictions as well as tax and other penalties for premature withdrawal.
You can generally enroll or change your level of contribution at any time. Contact the Personnel
Department at (617) 349-4337 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more information.

GETTING TO WORK

In order to reduce auto use in Cambridge, the City subsidizes the cost of “T” passes by reimbursing
full-time employees and those in positions budgeted for at least sixteen (16) hours per week for 65%
of the cost of a monthly “T” pass, up to $100 per month, for passes purchased through payroll
deduction. See your departmental payroll representative to participate. Some unions provide a
somewhat different benefit. Consult your supervisor, or the Personnel Department at (617) 349-4332
or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more information.
Parking Garage
For those who cannot use the “T”, subsidized parking is available at a municipal parking garage in
Central Square, several blocks from City Hall. Please contact the Traffic department at (617) 3494700 for more information.

CAMBRIDGE MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION
After six (6) months service, regularly budgeted employees are eligible to join the Cambridge
Municipal Employees Credit Union. The credit union is a cooperative organization operated by
members for their mutual financial assistance. Deposits and payments to the credit union can be
made by payroll deduction. To learn more about the program, contact the Credit Union at (617) 5471900.

RETIREMENT PLAN
The City of Cambridge has a mandatory retirement plan for nearly all public employees who are
regularly employed on a permanent full-time basis and part-time (20 hours or more) basis. This plan
is portable amongst all government (municipal) employment in the State of Massachusetts. The plan
affords a lifetime benefit to employees, once vested and upon attaining the acquired age. Options at
retirement allow for a continued benefit for certain beneficiaries.
The plan includes provisions for vested minimum retirement as early as age fifty-five (55) with ten
(10) years of creditable service. Benefits improve at later ages and with more service. Disability
retirement benefits are also available for permanently disabled employees meeting certain other
qualifications.

Training Opportunities

The City encourages employees to improve their
job-related skills by attending in-service training
programs that are offered periodically on or off
site. Courses are offered regularly in the areas of
general business skills development, computer
skills, management training, and health and
lifestyles. These are listed in the City's monthly

which you believe you would benefit from
additional training, discuss the matter with your
supervisor. Although not all requests can be
accommodated, every effort will be made to tailor
training to particular departmental and individual
needs.

Tuition Assistance

The City sponsors a limited tuition assistance
program for full-time employees and those
working in regular positions budgeted at twenty
(20) hours per week or more. Each fiscal year
managerial and non-union employees may
receive tuition reimbursement or advance
payment up to $4,000 for courses taken at any
accredited college or university that are job or
degree related, pre-approved for payment, and
successfully completed. There is also a $300
book reimbursement available. This program may
be different or not available to some unionized
employees. Contact the Personnel Department at
349-4338 for more details.

Scholarship Opportunities

Several local colleges offer special programs to
aid City of Cambridge employees in furthering
their education:
Harvard University provides three scholarships
per term to City employees to attend the Harvard
Extension School, in memory of the late Mayor
Leonard J. Russell. Applications for the program
are made directly to Harvard University. The
Personnel Department sends out notifications
when applications are available.

Workers’ Compensation

No deductions, including taxes, union dues, credit
union contributions, and medical insurance, are
taken from Workers' Compensation payments.
Employees are offered the opportunity to
continue medical coverage at their typical
contribution level of the full monthly cost.
Because no deductions can be made from a
workers’ compensation check, it is the
employee’s responsibility to maintain separate,
up to date insurance payments to the City’s
Personnel Department.

Sick Time and Return to Work

For non-union employees, sick days accumulate
from year to year to a maximum of four hundred
fifty (450) days.
You are encouraged to
accumulate your sick leave days for use in case of
major or catastrophic illness. If you have unused
sick days available at the time of retirement,
death, or loss of employment due to layoff or
elimination of position without fault on your part,
up to four hundred fifty (450) of those days may
be converted to cash. For non-union employees,
the first 100 days are eligible for buy-back at $55
per day. Days 101-200 are eligible for buy-back at
$95 per day. Days 201-300 are eligible for buyback at $125 per day or 50% of the current daily
rate, whichever is smaller (but no less $105) and
Days 301-450 are eligible for buy-back at $145 per
day or 50% of the current daily rate, whichever is
smaller (but no less than $125). This benefit does
not apply to persons who leave employment
voluntarily before retirement or as a result of
disciplinary action.
Some union contracts
provide different benefits.
Consult your
supervisor or the Personnel Department at (617)
349-4332 or (617) 349-4242 (TTY) for more
information.
Non-union employees may use up to twenty (20)
working days of their earned sick leave per
calendar year for attendance upon members of the
employee’s immediate family or household whose
illness requires the care of such employee or for the
care of a newborn or newly placed child pursuant
to the City’s Parental Leave policy. A doctor's note
may be required.

personal or work lives. Counseling is available
for a wide range of problems including
addictions, alcohol, anxiety or depression, child

2.1.b

While the City has a very generous sick leave program, it is expected that employees will use
accrued sick leave for reasons that are appropriate. Should an employee face catastrophic illness, a
significant sick leave accrual balance, built up over years by avoiding casual sick leave use, can
prevent significant financial hardship. All employees are encouraged to remember that sick leave is
only to be used under circumstances when the employee is unable to come to work, as more fully
described below.
Reasons for Use
Sick leave is to be used for the following reasons only:
•

Personal illness or non-job related injury which leaves you unable to perform your work duties

•

To supplement workers' compensation payments up to the level of full regular salary

•

Attendance upon members of the employee’s immediate family (child, parent, spouse or parent
of spouse) or members of the employee’s household whose illness requires the care of such
employee, provided that no more than twenty (20) working days with pay will be granted to
such employee in any one calendar year, not to exceed earned sick time available. A doctor's
note may be required.

•

To care for and bond with a new child or children, pursuant to the City’s Parental Leave
Policy

•

Enforced quarantine.

•

To address effects of domestic violence, pursuant to the City’s Domestic Violence Leave Policy.

•

Medical and dental appointments which cannot be scheduled during off duty hours. A doctor’s
note may be required.

Accrual Rules
A.) Nonunion benefit eligible employees in a regular position budgeted twenty (20) hours or
more per week
Accrual of sick leave begins on the employee’s first date of actual work, but employees may not use
earned sick leave until they have completed three months of service. At the completion of three
months employees will be credited with 1 ¼ sick days for the each of previous three months,
totaling 3.75 days. Employees will then earn 1¼ sick days per month until they reach the following
January 1. After that point employees will be credited with fifteen (15) sick days per calendar year,
pro-rated for unpaid leave of absence, no pay status, or time on workers' compensation.

Attachment: employee_orientation_manual_w_Feb_2020 (COF 2020 #69 : Materials for discussion)

City of Cambridge Sick Leave Policy (Effective JULY 2015)

2.1.b

Accrual of sick leave begins on 7/1/2015 or the employee’s first date of actual work whichever is
later, but employees may not use earned sick leave until they have completed three months of
service. At the completion of three months employees will have been credited with 1 hour of sick
leave for every thirty hours worked in the previous three months. Going forward, employees will
continue to accrue one hour of sick leave for every thirty hours worked.
Exceptions to this policy include youth employed in a city, state or federally funded program
during the summer or as part of a school to work seasonal/part time program; work-study
programs; trainees who are given a stipend or wage as part of a job training program, individual
employees whose employment is intended to provide a benefit or subsidy, and retirees of the
City who work under GL Chap 32, Sec. 91.
Sick leave will carry over from year to year. For purposes of this policy, a benefit year is a
calendar year. If an employee separates from service, accrued time will remain on the books
though December 31 of the following calendar year. If the employee returns to city service prior
to December 31 of the following calendar year, the previously earned time will be available for
use. Sick leave will be available for use in increments of one (1) hour.
Documentation
If the absence is greater than five (5) successive days, or if there are repeated absences of shorter
duration, a statement from the employee's physician may be required. Subsequent physicians'
statements may be required at the discretion of the Department Head, and may be necessary
before returning to work. If the employee fails to submit a physician's statement when requested,
he/she will not receive sick pay for the days in question, whether or not the employee has
accumulated sick leave to his/her credit, and may be subject to disciplinary action.
Employees are also required to provide similar documentation when using sick leave to provide
care for an ill family member. Employees are allowed to use sick time for up to twenty working
days per calendar year for the care of a family member, or to bond with a new child. If an
employee requires more than this allotted time, they may use vacation time or other accrued
time, apply for a flexible work schedule, or take a personal leave to attend to a long-term care
situation, in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act.

Social media is a tool growing in popularity for
developing direct communications with your
community and creating informal opportunities to
reach out beyond official publications. City policies
should cover the “official” city account, employee
use of social media inside and outside of work, and
elected official use of social media.
The extent to which a jurisdiction or individual uses
social media varies. Before engaging you should
assess your risk tolerance and make sure certain
laws – such as the Public Records Act and Open
Public Meetings Act – are followed.

A few clarifying definitions…
Social media can include websites and applications
that enable users to create and share content or to
participate in social networking.
A social platform is a web-based technology that
enables the development, deployment and
management of social media solutions and
services.
A third-party system is any system maintained by
another entity. This could include Twitter,
Facebook, Wordpress, Google, phone carriers, and
more.

Know when social media is a public record
A recent court decision (Nissen v. Pierce County)
case outlined a test for when a document on a
third-party system is created within the “scope of
employment” and is a public record. Scope of
employment may include elected officials acting
within their capacity as a mayor or councilmember.
This includes when an employee or elected official
is:
• Required by the job duties or
• Directed by the employer or
• In furtherance of the employer’s interests
Retention of documents, including social media, is
based on the content and not the platform. City
policy should consider retention and adopt a
process outlining responsibilities.

Make a clear distinction between official
accounts, campaign accounts, and
personal accounts
One way elected officials and staff can clearly
distinguish private social media accounts is by
adding disclaimers on election and personal
accounts, and not using the account for city
business. City-sponsored accounts may not be
used for campaign-related purposes.
To keep a personal account from becoming subject
to public records, consider some basic precautions.
Do:
• Post a disclaimer on your personal account that
identifies the account purpose and that the
opinions you express are your own.
• Limit the account content to personal use.
• Understand and use privacy settings to manage
the account.
• Have a plan in place to respond to or forward
city-related comments to the city, including how
the record is retained.
Don’t:
• Don’t write posts on personal accounts that
would fit within the scope of employment.
• Don’t discuss your private accounts in public
meetings or documents.
• Don’t link to your private accounts from an
official city account.
• Don’t use city devices to maintain your private
account.

First amendment and employment rights
City policies should strike an appropriate balance
between privacy, liability, and public records
concerns. Employees have first amendment and
employment rights that need to be balanced
against impacts to the image and liability of the city.
City policies should provide clear guidance on use
of official accounts and advice for keeping clear
distinctions between official and personal accounts.
(See precautions noted above.)

Guidelines for elected and appointed officials
using social media

Develop and follow your city policy
City council policies should address situations that
apply to council members and their unique needs.
Specifically, council policies should address open
public meetings implications, the intersection with
campaign rules, impacts on council decision
processes, and public records and retention issues.
• Evaluate how the elected official and city will
respond if an elected official’s personal account
receives a complaint or public records request.
• Establish a process to follow if an elected
official receives a city-related question or
comment on their personal account. Outline
how the question or comment will be
addressed, and how the record will be retained.
• Limit “friending” or “liking” by elected officials or
board members subject to the Open Public
Meetings Act. While court guidance is evolving,
elected officials need to avoid inadvertent serial
meetings that would violate the notice and
public meeting requirements. Courts have
found those to occur when a chain of
conversations involving “action” by a quorum of
the council occurs. Passive receipt of
information is generally not considered to be
action.
• Council may consider adopting rules that
outline usage and etiquette, including use both
inside and outside of meetings.

Establish procedures for approval of official city
social media use that considers retention when the
accounts are created.
• Establish an approval process before a city
account is created.
• Define who is allowed to post.
• Outline processes related to disclosure of
passwords, regular password changes, and
security.
• Know how access will be provided if requested
as part of a public records request.
• Research your third-party vendor’s retention
policy and consider investing in retention
software.
• Consider limiting posts to “secondary copies” of
documents that are already available on a
platform that is more easily retained, such as
the website.
• Consider non-city accounts or websites your
city may or may not link to. Some cities avoid
linking to accounts or websites they do not
control.
• Address when and how accounts could be
subject to search for public records, and require
employees to cooperate in searches and
providing affidavits.
• Prohibit activities that would be prohibited in
other contexts such as: use of public resources
for campaign activities; defamatory,
discriminatory, or obscene language; violations
of intellectual property rights; disclosure of
confidential or HIPAA protected healthcare
information.

SOCIAL MEDIA

The City Council finds that it is necessary to provide a Council Policy to ensure that
City of Newport Beach employees and members of its boards, commissions and
committees utilize social media technologies properly when communicating on behalf
of the City. Social media applications include, but are not limited to, blogs, microblogs,
wikis, RSS feeds, podcasts, discussion forums and social networking websites.
Messages and content posted on social media platforms may constitute speech on
behalf of the City, but such speech takes place on a non-City venue. Therefore, the City
Council finds and intends that speech posted on social media platform venues by City
representatives, and comments by the public posted on social media platform venues in
response, do not create a public forum or limited public forum on any portion of the
City‟s websites, equipment or other such City property.
A.

Usage
The City of Newport Beach‟s website (http://newportbeachca.gov/) shall be the
City‟s primary and predominant internet presence. Use of social media shall

information and communications should be organized in a manner that avoids
the posting of duplicative or conflicting information.
Social media sites created on behalf of the City of Newport Beach must first be
approved by the City Manager‟s Office and appropriate Department Head.
1.

Only those authorized by the City Manager or their Department Head to
speak on behalf of the City and convey information regarding City
programs, projects, policies or any other such City business on social
media platforms may communicate on the City‟s behalf on the subject of

statements on, or responding to comments received from, various social
media outlets in any manner that members of the public might perceive as
a statement on behalf of the City of Newport Beach.

2.

City employees or members of a board, committee or commission wishing
to express their personal points of view on a social media platform may
only do so on their own time and are prohibited from utilizing Cityowned equipment or technology to participate in social media platforms.

RSS Feeds*
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is the acronym used to describe the de facto
standard for the syndication of Web content. Users of RSS content use software
programs called “feed readers” or “feed aggregators.” Users can subscribe to
feeds by entering links to the feeds into a reader program. The reader then
checks the user's subscribed feeds to see if any have new content since the last
time it checked. If so, the content is retrieved and sent to the user.
