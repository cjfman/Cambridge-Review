follow up to work done in a Joint Committee last year. The Chair, Mayor Simmons, also
recognized Councillor Azeem who noted that he is not looking for any dramatic increase in fees
but rather looking to see if what we are charging is covering our costs.
The Chair, Mayor Simmons also recognized Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Toner and
Councillor Pickett for comments and questions. Acting City Solicitor Bayer responded noting
that there is a framework for what can be charged and going over that would constitute a tax.

Pass PO #4 on buying 727 Mass. Ave.

I write in support of passing 727 Mass Ave, also known as the Gas‐Light Building. It is a beautiful building that can be
better protected through city ownership and usage, instead of being turned into a high end hotel as has been proposed.
Purchase would help fulfill the ideas of the Central Sq. Lots Study, where the new building could be used as swing space
while other projects were carried out.
There are many different kinds of space in the building. Longterm, I would like to see affordable housing in the building,
either in the existing upper floors, or possibly added on top. I would also like to see active retail in the front on the
ground floor, rather than city offices.

COUNCILLOR NOLAN
VICE MAYOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge recognizes the importance of Electric Vehicle infrastructure
and acknowledge that electric vehicles (EVs) create less greenhouse gas emissions and
air pollution than traditional gasoline-fueled vehicles and that EV drivers benefit from
better fuel economy and financial incentives and contribute to cleaner air and better
health for the community; and

WHEREAS:

There are over 5,000 EVs registered in Cambridge and the City should continue to
work to expand access to charging citywide and EVs can be cheaper to operate than
fossil fuel cars despite costing more initially; and

WHEREAS:

In response to the work of the Climate Committee, the City Council and the Climate
Crisis Working Group, which recommended taking steps to expand EV charging
options, on July 12, 2023, the City announced a new EV charging pilot program that
will allow residents to apply for a permit to charge EVs across City sidewalks with
proper protections to ensure safety and accessibility; and

WHEREAS:

This charging pilot program supports the City’s continued commitment to increasing
public EV charging access and could act as a transitional piece for meeting the overall
publicly accessible EV charging goals; and

WHEREAS:

To receive a permit, residents have to follow strict guidelines, buy an approved cover,
and have appropriate outdoor electric outlet which can be expensive to install and pay
an annual fee of $200, and live more than half a mile from a public charging station, all
of which make the program less accessible and more costly restricting equitable access
to electric vehicle charging infrastructure for all residents; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has worked to advance city goals of equity and support for residents
and small businesses, and remove financial and other barriers when possible; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with relevant City
departments to review the Across Sidewalk Electric Vehicle Charging (EV) Permit
Pilot Program, consider whether the $200 annual permit fee is appropriate and
determine if any other changes are needed and report back to the City Council in a
timely manner.

3. In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings
for first occupancy after March thirteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-one, a failure to
design and construct dwellings in such a manner that:
a.
The dwellings have at least one building entrance on an accessible route,
unless it is impractical to do so because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of
the site;
b.
With respect to dwellings with a building entrance on an accessible route;
i. The public use and common use portions of the dwellings are readily
accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities;
ii. All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are
sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with disabilities in
wheelchairs; and
iii.
All premises within covered multifamily dwelling units contain an
accessible route into and through the dwelling; light switches, electrical
outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls are in accessible
locations; there are reinforcements in the bathroom walls to allow later
installation of grab bars; and there are usable kitchens and bathrooms such
that an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space. Compliance
with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standard for
Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities ["ANSI's ICC A117.1-2017"]
satisfies the requirements of this subsection.
C. The following practices shall not be deemed unlawful:
1. The leasing, rental, or other provision with or without a fee, of a space within a
church, temple, synagogue, religious school, or other facility used for other than a
commercial purpose, to persons of the same religion, or from giving preference to such
persons, unless membership in such religion is restricted on account of race, color, or
national origin;
2. A private club not open to the public that, as an incident to its primary purpose,
provides lodging that it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose from
limiting the rental or occupancy of that lodging to its members or from giving
preference to its members;
3. The establishment of government-sponsored housing programs operated either
directly by government agencies or indirectly through government subsidization and
regulation, which are determined by the Commission to be specifically designed to
assist elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or economically disadvantaged
individuals, provided that such programs shall not discriminate among elderly persons,
persons with disabilities, or economically disadvantaged on the basis of race, color,
sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation,

income;
4. The establishment of housing set aside for, or limited to, elderly persons or
persons with disabilities, provided that such establishment shall not discriminate
among elderly persons or persons with disabilities on the basis of race, color, sex, age,
religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, relationship
status, family structure, gender identity, marital status, military status, or source of

Council Agenda Item # 3 (POR2024#)

Dear City Councillor:
I am writing about Council Agenda Item #3 (POR2024#5).
Thanks very much to Councillors Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Nolan, Councillor Siddiqui, and Councillor
Wilson for sponsoring this policy order. I urge all Council members to support it.
We all are aware of the urgency and magnitude of the climate crisis and that it will take many coordinated
initiatives to address it, even in Cambridge. Policy order #3 allows us to make some progress on climate with
subsidies from the Federal government’s Inflation Reduction Act. Cambridge can take advantage of funds
previously unavailable to states and local governments to lower the costs of installing clean energy
technologies. In addition, installing these technologies will provide long-term energy savings. The program’s
prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements will also encourage the creation of good jobs.
The Direct Pay Program is a great opportunity to make some progress on clean energy in Cambridge. I hope
for the sake of my descendents and yours that you will take it.
Best regards,
Carolyn Magid

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
RE: POR 2024 #5
As a landscaper I am aware that gardens and greenspace play a role in averting the climate crisis,
yet working to meet clean energy goals is also very important.
Therefore, I urge you to vote in favor of POR 2024 #5, because climate change is the single most
important issue humanity faces. As a result of the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act,
municipalities across the country are now able to take advantage of funds previously unavailable
to states and local governments to help lower the cost of “clean energy” projects.
Not only will passing this Policy Order help our City achieve our clean energy goals, but it will
also help encourage the creation of good jobs due to the program’s prevailing wage and
parentship requirements.
While some City departments are already taking advantage of aspects of this provision,
there are still more departments and other tax-exempt Cambridge organizations that
need to be made aware that they too can take advantage of this cost-saving program.
The Direct Pay program helps lower the upfront cost of installing clean energy
technologies. However, the long-run savings of having geothermal heat pumps, solar panels,
and other technologies installed, as well as the weatherization benefits the City and
other tax-exempt entities can take advantage of under direct pay, should not be
understated.
Thank you for your time .
Sincerely,
Carolyn Shipley

I support city purchase of 727 Mass Ave

To the council:
I’m writing in support of POR 2024 #4. Please ask the city to look into the purchase of 727 Mass Ave
(also known as the Gas-Light Building). I was extremely pleased to see Mayor Simmons submit this
order, and hopefully, some of this context will be helpful as you consider whether to vote for it.
Key recent context: This opportunity is only possible thanks to the dozens of neighbors who spent
years fighting a developer’s proposal to redevelop this property as a luxury hotel. I was proud to have
spearheaded this fight in solidarity with the YWCA and residents of the Temple Place Apartments,
who rightfully objected to the impact that the proposed addition would have had on their quality of life.
As one very poignant example, you can read this letter from Guoxing Luo. It was very easy to take on
this fight because the developer was not proposing housing or anything else that in my view would
have been directly useful to the community. Instead, the boutique hotel was meant to accommodate
wealthy travelers coming from out of town. Many of us argued at the time that by differentiating
between studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom sized units, all of which had kitchenettes, this
“extended stay” model was just an end run around our inclusionary housing requirements. After many
public meetings, a design was approved that reasonably addressed the impact on the tenants. This
culminated in a unanimous council decision to landmark the existing building based on a
recommendation from the Historic Commission. Though the hotel addition was allowed to move
forward, nothing happened for years. Then in December of 2023, the owners listed the building for
sale at $2 million less than they had purchased it for several years earlier.
City offices aren’t sexy, but they make sense here: I was a vocal opponent of the previous
manager’s plan to renovate 105 Windsor Street into municipal offices, but as a former city employee I
do appreciate that we need them somewhere. Locating them in the vicinity of city hall could foster
cross-collaboration between departments while maximizing convenience for residents. I recently
discovered that the Purchasing Department has been moved from city hall to a little house on Bigelow
Street to make way for the manager’s expanded executive team, further highlighting the need for
more space in the area.
Central needs swing space to achieve our bold vision: The recommendations coming out of the
Central Square Lots Study are exciting, but the most transformative concepts could take decades to
execute simply because of a lack of flexible swing space. It is a very complicated puzzle reminiscent
of the children’s logic game “Rush Hour” - and I admit that there are certainly no easy answers. But
office space at 727 Mass Ave could help accelerate the timeline of some of the boldest wishes of the
community, such as relocating the library, by making it easier to move pieces around instead of
having to wait for one project to complete before anything else can happen.
Not necessarily just offices: While I agree with Mayor Simmons that this should primarily be
considered as an opportunity for offices, there are two caveats. First, can we please evaluate the
feasibility of turning that 36-unit hotel addition into 36 units of affordable housing? Maybe the

Packet Pg. 180

numbers don’t pencil out, but it deserves consideration. The building would be more valuable to the
city if an affordable housing addition were to be feasible, so it should be factored into the analysis.
Second, the smaller retail bays could be for active community uses. It would be a shame to deactivate that entire frontage by turning all of the first floor into city offices, and the smaller (currently
under-utilized) bays next to BOA are logical opportunities to create active and engaging community
uses or to support young entrepreneurs of color. I even remember that at one point the hotel
developer had promised the YWCA that they could use one of the bays during construction! Though
that turned out to be an empty promise, the point is that you could utilize the overwhelming majority of
the building as city offices while pursuing a housing addition and activating those storefronts for the
community. So even though this is inevitably a purchase for office space, don’t think of it as being
completely constrained to that. And of course, the low-income tenants next door should be included in
these discussions as much as possible.
You can probably get a good deal: The owner’s finances have run dry and they listed the property
at a loss because they need to get out from under it. Demand for office space is at a historic low
thanks to the cultural shift toward telecommuting. Unless a prospective buyer wants to build the exact
project that was previously approved, they would likely face years of bureaucracy. The city is wellpositioned to get a good deal on this property.
In short, this is a golden opportunity that probably won’t come up again for many decades if it is
passed upon. Also, the building is a beautiful gem of the square. Please vote yes to consider
purchasing it.
Best,
Dan Totten

Jan 22, 2024
Support Policy Order 2024-05 IRA Direct Pay Provision for municipal projects
Dear Councilors: We at Mothers Out Front support Cambridge seeking federal funds for municipal clean and
renewable energy projects.
The federal Inflation Reduction Act gives local governments access to as much as a 30% subsidy for projects
like weatherizing affordable housing, installing heat pumps or geothermal systems in schools, adding solar
panels to municipal buildings, expanding EV charging stations, or developing local microgrids. Many of these
projects can help the city meet its own building emissions reduction targets under BEUDO. Funded projects
can help lower energy costs, provide cleaner air for residents, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.
Due to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship stipulations, these funds will serve to train workers for well-paid
jobs that are very in demand in the growing green economy.
Furthermore, these funds will be available also to tax-exempt entities, including schools, community centers
and hospitals. Let’s not waste this opportunity to make such buildings healthier and greener.
We encourage the City Manager to explore possible projects and report back promptly to the Council. Federal
funds under this program will not be available indefinitely and can make a sizable contribution to our city’s
commitment to reaching net zero.

Respectfully,
Elena Fagotto for the Cambridge Mothers Out Front Leadership Team

Greetings City Councillors,
My name is Ellen, I live at 383 Prospect St, and I urge you to vote in favor of POR 2024 #5. Climate change
is the single most important issue humanity faces. As a millenial, I often wonder about what world I may
leave for the next generation and consider if I want to have children. I think about whether Cambridge
and Boston will be liveable with rising sea levels.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, municipalities across the country can take advantage of funds
previously unavailable to states and local governments to help lower the cost of “clean energy” projects.
Not only will passing this PO help our City achieve our clean energy goals, but it will also help encourage

installing clean energy technologies to invest in underserved communities and those who are being left
behind.

Support for POR #5 & #6

Dear City Council,
I asked about the IRA's direct pay provisioning and how Cambridge can take advantage of those funds,
and now it's on the agenda! Definitely look into how we can utilize the Qualified Commercial Clean
Vehicle & other credits for electrifying municipal fleets, buildings, etc.
Also, POR #6 is a smart idea. For example, everyone pays taxes, a portion of which fund public services.
Car infrastructure (road repair, road deicing, tax base lost to parking lots) is more expensive than bicycle
infrastructure, so car owners should pay the city more for their service (in fees, permits, etc, taxes were just an example).
Sincerely,
Ethan Frank

text of Somerville ceasefire resolution/ call for a cambridge ceasefire resolution

Councilors:
As you know I spoke in favor of a cease fire on Monday, January 22, before the Council, referencing the
financial cost to the City of Cambridge when we unconditionally supply weapons to Israel.
There were four resolutions before the Council last Monday that demanded serious expenditures of tax
dollars, federal, state and local. Due to limitations regarding the topics which I could address, I was only
able to state the fact that the current $3.8 billion given yearly to Israel for military purposes costs
Cambridge approximately $1.7 million in available public funds. The proposed $14.3 billion to support
the war on Gaza, which has already passed the House of Representatives, would cost Cambridge more
than $6 million. These numbers are based on Cambridge related federal tax payments as put forward by
various sources on the internet.
Clearly, from just a financial point of view, a Cease Fire resolution and vote is clearly within the
responsibility of the Council. These are vital tax dollars that are needed for the many human needs which
have been identified by the Council. We need to do all in our power to redirect federal spending away
from war and toward meeting our human needs.
Regarding the moral case for a cease fire, I can only underscore the language of the proposed Somerville
ceasefire resolution as seen below.
I would hope that the Cambridge City Council will vote in favor of a ceasefire resolution at the Council
meeting on January 29.
I am attaching the referenced proposed Somerville resolution.
Thanks for listening.

82 Elm Street

WHEREAS, The Somerville City Council recognizes that all human life is precious,
regardless of race, religion, or nationality;

WHEREAS, Since the horrific Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, in which over 1,200
Israelis were killed and more than 240 taken hostage, over 24,000 Palestinians have
been killed and over 60,000 wounded, including enormous numbers of children; and

WHEREAS, The ongoing military campaign and blockade of Gaza has caused a
catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including the displacement of approximately 1.9 million
people (85% of Gaza’s population), the near total destruction of the healthcare system
and civilian infrastructure, with the World Health Organization reporting that all Gazan
hospitals have been destroyed or seriously damaged, and nearly 2.2 million people at
“imminent risk of famine,” according to the United Nations; and

WHEREAS, Our Federal delegation has been outspoken on this issue, including MA-7
Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley who has been a leading advocate for a ceasefire,
who recently wrote “[L]et us recommit ourselves to the belief that life is precious through
demanding a ceasefire, which is the best way to save lives, return all hostages, and
deliver the humanitarian aid desperately needed in Gaza,”; and

WHEREAS, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey recently wrote “We must also resume
the ceasefire that allowed for desperately needed humanitarian aid to get into Gaza and
that facilitated the release of 105 hostages so that all hostages taken by Hamas on
October 7 are freed”; and

WHEREAS, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote, in response to the
temporary ceasefire of November 2023, that the continuing military campaign “has
resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe, the deaths of thousands of civilians in Gaza,
and endangered the region’s long-term stability…I’ve repeatedly urged the Israeli
government to stop the bombing in Gaza, and I’ve pressed for massive humanitarian
aid for civilians. Hamas must release the remaining hostages and stop its attacks. The
Israeli government should not resume bombing in Gaza, which would be a grave
strategic and moral mistake”; and

WHEREAS, On October 26, 2023, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted
a resolution calling for an “immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce”
between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza, and numerous international
humanitarian organizations have similarly called for a sustained ceasefire; and

WHEREAS, Members of the Somerville community, including Palestinians, Israelis,
Muslims, Jews, and others, are experiencing trauma, grief, shock and fear,
compounded by increased incidents of Islamophobia, antisemitism, and anti-Palestinian
racism, both nationally and locally; now be it therefore
RESOLVED, That the Somerville City Council supports an enduring ceasefire, the
provision of life-saving humanitarian aid in Gaza, and the release of all hostages,
detainees and political prisoners on all sides; and be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Somerville City Council condemns antisemitic, antiPalestinian, anti-Arab, Islamophobic, and all xenophobic rhetoric and attacks; and be it,

Pass PO #4 on buying 727 Mass. Ave.

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I write in support of passing 727 Mass Ave, also known as the Gas-Light Building. It is a beautiful building that can be
better protected through city ownership and usage, instead of being turned into a high end hotel as has been proposed.
Purchase would help fulfill the ideas of the Central Sq. Lots Study, where the new building could be used as swing space
while other projects were carried out.
There are many different kinds of space in the building. Longterm, I would like to see affordable housing in the building,
either in the existing upper floors, or possibly added on top. I would also like to see active retail in the front on the
ground floor, rather than city offices.

Residents Alliance Supports PO #5, access federal funds for renewable energy projects

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
The Cambridge Residents Alliance supports PO #5, which encourages the City to prioritize taking advantage of the 2022
Inflation Reduction Act’s “direct pay” policy to easily access federal funds for renewable energy projects. Doing so will
also set an example for other tax exempt entities in Cambridge, including the universities and non-profits.
We appreciate this policy order means that Cambridge could have a triple win, by saving money on clean energy
projects, creating good well-paid jobs, and reducing carbon emissions going far into the future.
Would it be possible to amend the PO to ask the manager to add a line in the budget that says how much will be spent
each year on qualifying projects, and how much of these federal funds are expected to be received?
As stated, projects could include the installation of heat pumps or geothermal systems in public buildings, the addition
of solar panels to school buildings or affordable housing, the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the
purchase of electrical vehicles, and the weatherization of senior centers.
Thanks,
Lee

PLEASE VOTE FOR Policy Order #2024-05 -- Investigate the "Direct Pay" Provision of the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)

To the City Council,
I am writing to ask you to vote for Policy Order #2024-05, which asks the City Manager to investigate
receiving funding through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) “Direct Pay” provision. This is on the agenda
for tonight’s City Council meeting. January 22, 2024.
This policy order encourages the City to investigate and seek all possible federal funds for municipal
clean and renewable energy projects, available through the “Direct Pay Provision” of the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA). This funding provides access to substantial subsidies for energy efficiency projects
such as building weatherization; non-fossil-fuel energy improvements including heat pumps, solar
panels, and geothermal systems; and support for expanding EV charging stations.
Cambridge has passed many ordinances and invested significant resources that would help us do
projects of this sort. And here is the possibility of getting federal money to help us do them. How could
this possibly be a bad idea?
Please vote in favor of Policy Order #2024-05.

please support POR 2024 #5

I urge the council to support Policy Order #5 on obtaining support through federal funds for potential
public renewable energy projects, Since Cambridge will be investing more in renewable energy in the
future, this is a promising opportunity for the city to save money on the cost of such projects. Projects
initiated with the IRA Direct Pay provision would also be of benefit to Cambridge by providing training
to the workforce employed in renewable energy projects.
Thank you!

Kick Elbit out of Cambridge!

Dear Cambridge City Manager, City Council, and City Clerk,
I am Terence Cawley, a Somerville resident who works in Cambridge, and I am writing to you about Elbit
Systems.
Elbit Systems is Israel's largest weapons manufacturer, providing weapons used to kill many thousands in the
ongoing genocide in Palestine. In addition to providing arms to Israel, Elbit provides technology used to
oppress and surveil people across the US-Mexico Border, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Honduras, Myanmmar,
South Korea, Azerbijan, India, the Phillipines and Australia. It is disgusting that such a repugnant company has
offices right here in Central Square.
As city councilor and manager, you have the power to pressure such companies to leave Cambridge. I
demand that you enact policy that will prevent weapons manufacturers from setting up shop in Cambridge and
encourage you to explore means of acquire the building Elbit Systems is occupying.
By helping remove Elbit Systems from Cambridge you can support ending the ongoing opression and death
that they are enacting, and allow buildings to be used in a way that more actively benefits the Community.
Best,
Terence Cawley

Council Agenda Item # 3 (POR2024#)

Dear City Councillor:
I am writing about Council Agenda Item #3 (POR2024#5).
Thanks very much to Councillors Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Nolan, Councillor Siddiqui, and Councillor
Wilson for sponsoring this policy order. I urge all Council members to support it.
We all are aware of the urgency and magnitude of the climate crisis and that it will take many coordinated
initiatives to address it, even in Cambridge. Policy order #3 allows us to make some progress on climate with
subsidies from the Federal government’s Inflation Reduction Act. Cambridge can take advantage of funds
previously unavailable to states and local governments to lower the costs of installing clean energy
technologies. In addition, installing these technologies will provide long-term energy savings. The program’s
prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements will also encourage the creation of good jobs.
The Direct Pay Program is a great opportunity to make some progress on clean energy in Cambridge. I hope
for the sake of my descendents and yours that you will take it.
Best regards,
Carolyn Magid

Cambridge Residents Alliance asks: Call for a Ceasefire in Gaza!
CResA Letter to City Council on Gaza.docx

Dear Mayor Simmons and Cambridge City Council,
Please see attached (and pasted in below) Letter from the Cambridge Residents Alliance Board of
Directors to the Cambridge City Council about requested action on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Thank you,
Jacqueline King
Board Member of the Cambridge Residents Alliance
January 24, 2024
Dear Mayor Simmons and Cambridge City Council,
We write to urge the new Council to pass a Policy Order calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in
Gaza.
As you know, the previous Council voted not to even discuss the 2023 Ceasefire Policy Order, despite three
and a half hours of passionate and informed public commentary. Most of the councilors did not vote for or
against the Order, but instead voted to dispose of the matter by voting “present” on a motion to end debate.
Some Council members later reported to Cambridge Day that they had come to the meeting with amendments
they wanted to propose and discuss, but that opportunity was not presented.
We believe this outcome was not a fair representation of either the ideas expressed or the urgency of this
deadly matter. As a newly-seated City Council, you have the chance to better serve your constituents by reintroducing the 2023 Ceasefire Policy Order or a similar resolution which calls for a ceasefire. It would show
due respect for the 200+ Cantabrigians who offered testimony and expected Council consideration. Although
such a resolution would not address the underlying causes or present suggested solutions to the
Israeli/Palestinian situation, passing it would recognize that a ceasefire was a crucial step toward stopping the
massive bloodshed, destruction of life, and erasure of medical, educational, religious and cultural institutions in
the Gaza Strip.
The genius of the 2023 Policy Order was its neutrality. It simply called for three things:
1. An immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza.
2. Opening the blockade to allow the massive humanitarian relief required to decrease the
suffering of Gaza’s residents,
3. Communication of the Policy Order to our national elected representatives.
Some argue that the City Council has no power to change U.S. foreign policy, and therefore it should not
consider any issues beyond local control.

This position ignores a long tradition of Cambridge City Council support for global humanitarian causes. Led by
Caroline Hunter and others, the Council joined the campaign to end Apartheid in South Africa; it opposed the
wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua; supported human rights in the Philippines; endorsed Back from the Brink
and divestment from manufacturers of nuclear weapons. The Cambridge sister city initiative with San José Las
Flores, El Salvador was not just a token resolution. It actually ensured protection for people in a country where
70,000 people were killed by a military funded by the United States.
Moreover, this Cambridge human rights tradition is shared by municipalities across the country which have
already passed resolutions supporting an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. This movement
includes the following municipalities, among others: In California: Berkeley, Cotati, Cudahy, Davis, Oakland,
Richmond, San Francisco; in Connecticut: Bridgeport; in Delaware: Wilmington; in Georgia: Atlanta; in Iowa:
Iowa City; in Maine: Portland; in Michigan: Ann Arbor, Detroit, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Hamtramck,
Ypsilanti; in Minnesota: Hastings; in New York: Albany; in Ohio: Akron; in Rhode Island: Providence; in
Washington: Bellingham.
You are Cambridge leaders, elected to represent and be the voice for our city. Our national leaders are failing
us. Though polls indicate that a large majority of the US population favors an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, our
President and Congress have turned a deaf ear to their pleas. The calls for a ceasefire are coming from the
grassroots, from the people whose power comes from collective organizing, from the people who pay tax
dollars that are being used to support the military assault. As local “grassroots” leaders, please help elevate
the voice of local people who want to end the killing in Gaza of both the Palestinian civilian population and
Israeli soldiers.
In conclusion, we urge you to introduce and pass either the 2023 Policy Order or a similar resolution calling for
an immediate and lasting ceasefire. We favor a resolution that does not place blame on either Hamas or Israel,
but simply adds the voice of Cambridge residents to the international community’s call for an immediate,
permanent cessation of the killing and provision of humanitarian relief to the afflicted.
Sincerely yours,

Elbit Systems out of Cambridge now!

To all this may concern,
I am a mom of two young children with long time roots in Cambridge MA. I grew up in Cambridge and am an
alumni of CRLS. I am writing to you about Elbit Systems. Elbit systems is Israel's Largest weapons
manufacturer, providing weapons used to kill many thousands in the ongoing genocide in Palestine. In addition

and Australia. It is disgusting that such a repugnant company has offices right here in Central Square.
As the planning board you have the power to influence how buildings in Cambridge are used. I demand you
explore zoning to prevent weapons manufactures from occupying offices and profiting off of this unique city.
As city council you have the power to pressure such companies to leave Cambridge. I demand that you enact
policy that will prevent weapons manufactures from setting up shop in Cambridge and encourage you to
explore means of acquire the building Elbit Systems is occupying.
By leasing space to Elbit you are directly contributing to the Genocide in Palestine. As Elbit Systems' Landlord
I demand that you terminate its lease and find a more appropriate tenant and use of that space.
By helping remove Elbit Systems from Cambridge you can support ending the ongoing opression and death
that they are enacting, and allow buildings to be used in a way that more actively benefits the Community.

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council recognizes that all human life is precious, regardless of
race, religion, or nationality; and

WHEREAS:

The horrific attacks by Hamas, a terrorist organization, of October 7, 2023, resulted in
1,200 Israelis killed and more than 240 taken hostage; and

WHEREAS:

The Netanyahu Administration responded with disproportionate military force to this
attack, leading to the deaths of over 25,000 Palestinians, including 10,000 children,
and thousands who have been wounded, injured, and millions displaced; and

WHEREAS:

While city councils have no direct influence upon American foreign policy nor any
authority to direct the federal government’s actions, there has nonetheless been a
steady call for municipal bodies, nationwide, to symbolically join the calls for the
freeing of the October 7 hostages and a ceasefire, and such has been the case in
Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

This ongoing conflict has created a severe humanitarian crisis, leaving millions of
people without basic necessities such as food, water, electricity, heat, shelter, and
proper medical care; and

WHEREAS:

This conflict is not only impacting the international community but is also causing
significant trauma, fear, and grief amongst members of the Cambridge community,
including Muslim, Israeli, Palestinian and Jewish residents; now therefore be it

That the Cambridge City Council go on record expressing its support for an immediate,

of all hostages, and calling for the urgent implementation of humanitarian aid; and be it

COUNCILLOR PICKETT
WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts Legislature is considering legislation via S.452 and H.869 which
would establish the municipal reforestation program, which would set up a structure to
provide funding and technical assistance for municipalities to create a robust urban tree
canopy cover, especially in treeless neighborhoods; and

WHEREAS:

For many years, the City of Cambridge has been committed to confronting the problem
of climate change and environmental justice by dedicating expertise and resources to
supporting a dense urban forest and focusing on reducing heat island impacts
throughout the city, but especially in environmental justice neighborhoods; and the
Massachusetts bill would provide numerous benefits related to public health, climate
change, environmental justice, and biodiversity; and would support the ongoing work
of the Urban Forest Master Plan; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts Pollinator Network has worked to support local and state efforts to
improve biodiversity and native planting practices and develop programs and
incentives to grow the urban forest; they have developed a letter in support of S.452
and H.869 with additional recommendations which would support native plantings and
local environmental jobs; and

WHEREAS:

The bill provides support for the urgent socio-economic and environmental needs of
municipalities throughout the Commonwealth by: including training youth and young
adults in urban arboriculture, providing career paths for youth from underserved
communities; prioritizing the use of native trees, which are an essential part of
reversing the rapid decline in insect, bird and other species; and helping communities
invest in the environment in a way that improves natural infrastructure and supports
the health of essential ecosystems; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Urban Forest Master Plan calls on the city to maintain and expand the
urban forest canopy while being more resilient to climate change, reducing the urban
heat island effect, mitigating stormwater runoff, reducing nutrient runoff, and
contributing to community well-being; all goals which can be supported by the
introduction of a state-led municipal reforestation program; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record supporting bill S.452 and H.869, which would
establish the municipal reforestation program and further support our own goals of
maintaining and expanding the urban forest canopy and support our goals of
environmental justice; and sign on in support of the attached letter by the MA
Pollinators Network supporting the bill; and be it further

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER
WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that there has once again been a
traumatic crash at the intersection of Cardinal Medeiros Avenue, Binney Street, and
Bristol Street on January 12; and

WHEREAS:

This intersection has long been dangerous, with near misses almost every day,
particularly because Bristol Street is often used as a cut-through by drivers, visibility
for drivers to anticipate cross traffic is extremely poor, and this section of Cardinal
Medeiros is straight and induces speeding by drivers who are often lacking intimate
knowledge of the particular hazards; and

WHEREAS:

Most of the recent crashes at the intersection have involved cars turning from Bristol
Street or Binney Street onto Cardinal Medeiros Avenue or attempting to cross Cardinal
Medeiros Avenue to go straight on Binney Street; and

WHEREAS:

Limiting cut-through traffic on Bristol Street would improve traffic safety at the
intersection while creating additional opportunities for recreation, pedestrian and
bicycle access, and safe outdoor dining at Vincent’s; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council already passed two policy orders about this intersection on June 14,
2021 and August 1, 2022; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Traffic & Parking
Department to take immediate action and make safety improvements to the intersection
of Cardinal Medeiros Avenue, Binney Street, and Bristol Street as soon as possible.
