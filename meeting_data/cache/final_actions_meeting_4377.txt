Awaiting Report 23-31 regarding potential amendments to the
Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO)

Deputy Director
Chief Planner

The Community Development Department (CDD) has put together the following
information in response to the Council’s Policy Orders related to proposed
amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay zoning.
Review of Proposed Amendments to the AHO and Additional Suggested
Amendments
Attached hereto for the Council’s consideration is a red line of the Council’s
offered zoning language as part of Awaiting Report 23-31, for the purpose of
language clarity and consistency, and to improve the construction of the overall
zoning text.
In consultation with local affordable housing builders, an additional suggested
edit was made to the red lined text which allows particularly small lots (5,000
square feet or less) to waive required open space when the lot abuts a Public
Open Space that consists of at least 1,500 square feet of contiguous area. The
result would allow smaller lots to redevelop under the AHO where providing
open space on the lot itself would be infeasible, while ensuring future residents
would have access to open space resources directly adjacent to the site.
Consultation with Local Affordable Housing Builders on Proposed Amendments
In preparing this response, we consulted with Cambridge affordable housing
builders regarding the proposed modifications to the AHO and confirmed their
support for the amendments being proposed. They expressed broad interest in
exploring ways to maximize the affordable housing benefits of a site by building
taller buildings and welcomed the proposed change to the AHO to allow heights
of 12 stories in the corridors and 15 stories in the squares. Notwithstanding this
interest, builders noted that, for the near future, it is unlikely that many AHO

developments will exceed 11 or 12 stories due to other constraints beyond
zoning:
•

Funding: A fully affordable building of larger size requires substantial
financing subsidies from multiple sources. While local funds are more
readily accessible, it is challenging to secure the amount of state and
federal funding needed to complete a development of that scope.

•

Construction Technology: At this time the most feasible option for
affordable housing construction is light-gauge steel, which has its own
limitations as a construction method. It is expected that building
technology will keep improving and will provide a wider range of options
to make high-rise construction more feasible in the future, including
buildings taller than 15 stories. This includes emerging construction
technologies such as mass timber, that are emerging and should expand
what is feasible, construction-wise, for 100% affordable housing
developments.

Viability of Mass Timber Construction Pathways for Affordable Housing
Mass timber construction, also known as cross-laminated timber (CLT), is
construction that uses multiple thick, compressed layers of wood, either nailed
or glued together, as structural components to a building. This is not to be
confused with heavy timber, which is a traditional construction method using
heavy beams to create a framing system.
Mass timber construction is allowed in jurisdictions that have adopted the 2021
International Building Code (2021 IBC). Under this building code, the use of mass
timber is allowed for buildings up to 18 stories in height. The Massachusetts
Board of Building Regulation Standards (BRRS) is currently considering the
adoption of the 2021 IBC, which would include the new mass timber
construction pathways (types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C). BBRS has been meeting since
2022 regarding this potential change, and a vote is expected in Summer or Fall
2023. If approved, mass timber construction will be permitted use in buildings up
to 18 stories in Massachusetts.

Two buildings in Massachusetts have already been built using mass timber:
UMass Amherst John Oliver Design Building and 201 Hampden Street in Boston.
Though mass timber is not yet allowed in Massachusetts, both projects were
able to obtain a variance that allowed them to do so.
While mass timber is not yet widely available, it is an emerging technology which
could be useful for building affordable housing in the future. We expect that
once approved for use in Massachusetts, there will be some time for builders to
learn about how best to utilize the technology, and to assess its cost in
comparison to other construction types. Staff will continue to monitor the
approval of the 2021 IBC and this new construction approach. When the new
building code is adopted here, staff will work with affordable housing builders to
understand where it might be advantageous to consider this construction
approach to build new affordable housing.

● According to the Cambridge Housing Authority, there are currently over
21,000 people on the affordable housing waiting list. Of those 21,000, over
6,500 of them live and/or work in Cambridge.
● We are nowhere close to being on track to reaching our Envision goals
which state that we need to build 12,500 housing units by 2030.

Affordable housing production (other than CHA) requires new land acquisition
Without higher density affordable housing developers lose out to private
buyers
After buying land (with ﬁnancial help from the city) it takes years to ﬁnance,
design and build a project
Additional density means that each project can produce more homes for people
Additional homes means we can clear more people off the waiting list sooner!
We have millions of $ in the Affordable Housing Trust and this is the best way to
put them to work quickly.

-

Direct transit options and the most plausible/potential “soft” sites

-

Smaller side streets not as
conducive to land acquisition
projects; focus on giving AHO
developers the greatest possible
market advantage where they
need it most

Why we chose corridors & squares
Many recent AHO “missed opportunities” were on main corridors

- Corridor network runs through
every neighborhood

We are proposing a number of changes to the dimensional requirements of the AHO
ordinance.
○

○
○

Building height
■
AHO projects can now be up to 9 stories (up from 6 in the original AHO) or 100ft in areas where the
maximum allowable residential height is between 40 and 65ft or if it is an AHO Corridor project.
■
AHO projects can now be up to 13 stories (up from 7 in the original AHO) or 150ft in areas where the
maximum allowable residential height is above 65ft.
■
AHO projects can now be up to 15 stories near Central, Harvard, Union, and Porter Squares
Density
■
The proposed amendments remove the FAR requirements for an AHO Square/Corridor project.
Setbacks
■
The proposed amendments remove side and front setbacks
■
An AHO Project with a height of less than 4 stories or 45ft, shall have a minimum rear yard setback of 15ft
(down from 20ft in the original AHO).
●
All other AHO projects have no minimum rear setbacks

Overlay Districts, as well as any Lot or
directly adjacent Lots owned by the same
entity, where at least one of the Lot Lines
abuts the northern side of Massachusetts
Avenue or Somerville Avenue between
Davenport and the city border (just west
of Acadia Park), or either Webster Avenue
or Columbia Street, north of Cambridge
Street.
●

An AHO Square Project shall have
a maximum height of twenty-ﬁve
(25) stories, or two hundred and
eighty (280) feet, except as further
limited below.

Street, Alewife Brook Parkway,
Bishop Allen Drive, Broadway,
Cambridge Street, Concord Avenue,
First Street, Fresh Pond Parkway,
Massachusetts Avenue, Memorial
Drive, Mount Auburn Street,
Prospect Street, and Sidney Street.
For the purposes of this Section, the

more directly abutting Lots owned
by the same entity, where at least
one of the Lot Lines abuts an AHO
Corridor.

Open space amendment
More ﬂexibility on building height in
exchange for additional open space
Language allows for more height but
not more density
CHA has analyzed how this would
have impacted their recent projects,
with very positive results

Packet Pg. 23

a

Where an AHO Project may have various applicable Building Height and
Stories Above Grade limitations as speciﬁed in 11.207.5.2.1, the most
permissive height limitations shall generally control. Notwithstanding the
provisions set forth in Section 11.207.5.2.1, an AHO Project may match the
height of an existing building on an adjacent lot.

Highlight from CDD Amendments

Will AHO projects use the great heights & density?
We’ve a shortage of affordable housing in our city and are short of
meeting our goals. Increased heights along corridors will allow us to build
more housing. We can hear directly from CHA, HRI, others here.
● This petition would legalize 2072 Mass Ave
● Cross Laminated Timber allows for affordable construction to 12
stories in MA (18+ internationally)
● Open Space adjustments would make other projects more viable.
● Projects would be viable on smaller lots and be able to preserve
more open space

What are unit costs as you go taller?
At greater heights builders change to different building codes and
construction becomes more expensive, but the land cost is divided by
more units and so total unit costs still go down.
CDD Statement: “Examples include going from all wood-frame to
wood-frame over steel podium where 7 stories may be more cost
effective than 5-6 stories, to going from wood-over-steel to light gauge
steel where 10-11 stories may be more cost effective than 8-9 stories,
and to all steel buildings where 16 or more stories may be more
cost-feasible than 12-15 stories.”

How long is the Affordable Housing Waitlist?
The Cambridge Housing Authority waitlist has 22,537 households with
6,501 applicants have a local preference.
Of these 6501: 4,488 live in Cambridge, 2,912 work in Cambridge, and
327 are Veterans. There is some crossover so these numbers are not
additive.

Are mixed-use projects eligible for the AHO? (For
example Rindge Commons, a 40B)
An AHO can be mixed-use in a mixed use district.

11.207.4 B) “An AHO Project may contain active non-residential uses on
the ground ﬂoor as they may be permitted as-of-right in the base zoning
district or the overlay district(s) that are applicable to a lot…”
