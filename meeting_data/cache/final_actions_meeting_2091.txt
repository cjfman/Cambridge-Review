To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the transfer of $135,000 from the General Fund Library Salary and
Wages account to the General Fund Library Other Ordinary Maintenance account to cover
contract costs associated for the two HVAC maintenance and repair contracts. As has been done
historically, the Department of Public Works put out to bid the expired HVAC contracts in
November of 2017, as part of the City’s three-year bid schedule. To plan for the FY2018 budget,
the Library provided estimates for the contract value in anticipation of the fall 2017 bid process.
As contract rates came in higher than previously estimated in the FY2018 budget, the Library
will need additional funding to cover the increased contract cost for the remainder of the fiscal
year.
The current HVAC contract will now be in place for three years, providing budgeted contract
values through 2021.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale

FINAL
LANDMARK DESIGNATION REPORT
Hovey & Markham Cottages
40 and 44 Cottage Street, Cambridgeport, Mass.

The Hovey & Markham cottages at 40 and 44 Cottage Street are importantly associated with the economic and social history of Cambridge. Architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham’s completion of the cottages, the first homes built in this block, prompted additional high quality development on this street. Their construction in 1839 was the start of a period of rapid development in the
Cambridgeport neighborhood, which was growing and industrializing in the middle of the nineteenth century. The families that resided in these homes were and are leaders in local businesses and social and service organizations. The cottages are also architecturally significant examples of the Greek Revival style.
The pattern of development set by these homes for this side of the block maximized the usable yard space
by positioning the homes on the far west side of the lots.
If implemented by the City Council, landmark designation would allow the Commission to review and
approve publicly-visible exterior alterations with the goal of protecting the historic integrity of the buildings and their setting. The designation would not regulate use, plant materials, or alterations to interior
features.

Address and Zoning

The Hovey & Markham cottages at 40 and 44 Cottage Street are located on the south side of Cottage Street between Pleasant and Magazine streets. No. 40 Cottage Street occupies a 4,846
square foot lot (Map 104/Lot 92) and 44 Cottage occupies a 4,537 (Map 104/Lot 91). The lots
are located in a Residence C zoning district, which allows single to multi-family dwellings with a
0.60 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limit, 35-foot height limit, and a density of 1,800 square feet per
dwelling unit. The houses both have non-conforming west side and rear setbacks due to a historic
pattern of placement of houses on their lots to maximize yard space.

Ownership and Occupancy

The two properties are separately owned. Robin M. Chase and Roy P. Russell, Jr., leased 40 Cottage Street with an option to purchase beginning in June 1989. They completed the purchase of
from William H. Chafe in July 1994. The deed is recorded in the Middlesex South Registry of
Deeds in Book 24,692/Page 516.
Charles E. Allen Jr. became a co-owner of number 44 with Anne M. Strong in December 1994 as
recorded in a deed at Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in Book 25,092/Page 464. Ms. Strong
had purchased number 44 from Georgianna C. Blasi in June 1992 (Book 22089/Page 78).
The assessed value for land and buildings in 2018 was $1,247,600 for 40 Cottage Street and
$1,420,000 for 44 Cottage Street. Both were originally built as single-family houses but 44
Cottage Street is currently assessed as a two-family and the renovation proposal for 40 Cottage
Street would result in a two-family residence.
C.

Area Description

Cottage Street runs one way from east to west. The First Korean Church (formerly the Pilgrim
Congregational Church) anchors the northwest corner of Cottage and Magazine streets. All the
other structures in this block are residential, two-thirds of which were constructed between 1839
and 1846. A few infill structures dating from 1881 to 1914 complete the block. The houses here
are generally in very good condition.

Context of this Designation Report

A demolition permit request for 40 Cottage was received on February 9, 2016 (Case D-1390).
The house was found significant and preferably preserved in March 2016, causing a six-month
delay in issuance of a demolition permit. 1 During the delay period the owners revised their plans
so that only the ell would be demolished, a new ell built, and the front of the house renovated.
The Commission waived the remainder of the delay, subject to receiving the other necessary approvals for a building permit for the replacement project. However, the owners withdrew their
application for zoning relief and the project did not proceed.
In February 2017, a month before the expiration of the demolition delay, abutter Charles Allen
submitted a petition for a landmark designation study of both 40 and 44 Cottage Street. The
Commission voted to initiate landmark study of both properties. Acceptance of the petition initiated a one-year period in which the Historical Commission would regulate the property as if it
were already designated.
In August 2017, the owners of 40 Cottage Street filed an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a project that included renovation of both the existing house and the ell, demolition of
the garage, and construction of a new foundation and an addition on the east side of the house.

1

The owners later explained that the demolition request and replacement project was intended to show the possibilities of a zoning as-of-right project and to encourage their neighbors’ support for a renovation and addition to the existing house that would require zoning relief.

Design refinements were reviewed by the Commission in September and October and the certificate approved at the October 5, 2017 hearing for plans dated September 20, 2017 (see renderings
below). Both a zoning as-of-right design and a preferred design option, which would require a
special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal, were approved by the Commission. The main
differences in the as-of-right and special permit designs are the location of the egress door and
stair for the front unit, number of parking spaces, and window changes on the west elevation.

Architectural Description

40 Cottage Street. North/front elevation (left) and west elevation (right). CHC photos 2017, 2018.

Forty Cottage Street is a 1½-story single-family frame house oriented with its gable end to the
street. The three-bay side hall house was executed in the Greek Revival style with a broad gable,
a temple front porch with four Doric columns, symmetrically placed 6-over-6 windows, a combination of flush board and clapboard siding, wide pilasters, and sidelights flanking the front door.
The large shed roof dormer on the east side is a later addition, as is the rear porch and ell extension.
The main block of the house measures 23’ wide by 28’ deep. The 2-story ell extends another 34’
to the rear of the lot and measures 16’ wide. The house consists of approximately 2, 284 square
feet of living space (per assessment), not counting any finished space in the basement.
The house retains most of its original architectural features. One exception is the front porch
deck and stairs, which were reconstructed in concrete in the early twentieth century. The house
was sided with wood shingles in 1952. The current owners, Robin Chase and Roy Russell, removed the shingles, restored the wood clapboards and flush boards, and reworked the cornice
under the dormer in 1997. They have maintained a garden in the large side yard on the east side
of the house. They installed an array of solar panels on the roof in 2012.

44 Cottage Street. North/front elevation (left) and east elevation (right).

Likewise, 44 Cottage Street has the same placement on the lot, side hall plan, gable orientation,
Doric-columned front porch, and six-over-six windows. It also has a large shed dormer on the
east elevation and additions at the back of the house, both of which are later additions.
The main block of the house measures 23’ wide by 38’ deep. The 2-story ell extends another 18’
to the rear of the lot and measures 15’ wide. The house consists of approximately 2, 288 square
feet of living space (per assessment), not counting any finished space in the basement.
Significant renovations were completed in 1993. A garage on the property was demolished in
1995. Also that year, a two-story addition for a rental unit was constructed at the in the southeast
corner of the house, plans for which received a zoning variance. The staff is not aware of any anticipated alterations to 44 Cottage by current owner Charles Allen. A property sale is anticipated
and the plans of any future owners are not known.

History

The settlement of Cambridgeport was made possible by the construction of the West Boston
Bridge in 1793. Prior to that time, there were only three houses in Cambridge east of Quincy
Street, and the area south of present Massachusetts Avenue was completely unpopulated. Most
of Cambridgeport was controlled by two landowners, Leonard Jarvis and Chief Justice Francis
Dana, while the rest - and all of East Cambridge - fell to Andrew Craigie.
In 1792 Leonard Jarvis acquired the Ralph Inman house and its vast adjoining lands that included most of Cambridgeport north of present Massachusetts Avenue. Justice Francis Dana, a
descendant of an old Cambridge family, controlled land on Dana Hill near his house and also
most of Cambridgeport south of Massachusetts Avenue. Jarvis and Dana worked with the Proprietors of the West Boston Bridge to lay out Massachusetts Avenue and Main Street, but did not
otherwise develop a master plan for the area. Jarvis lost his land in 1801 due to financial reverses

and it passed to Jonathan Austin who divided much of the estate into building lots. Austin was
involved in promoting construction of the River Street Bridge that was completed in 1811.
Dana’s estate south of Massachusetts Avenue remained largely intact until his death in 1811,
when his heirs divided his Cambridge landholdings. They carefully controlled subsequent development. They created parallel streets - Pleasant, Magazine, Pearl, and Brookline - leading from
Massachusetts Avenue toward the river, and laid out and subdivided cross streets, beginning with
Green and Franklin, as demand required.
The only substantial estate south of Massachusetts that was not owned by Francis Dana or his
heirs was an L-shaped parcel of land between Western Avenue and Brookline Street that belonged to William Watson, a glazier who lived at the corner of JFK and Mt. Auburn streets. According to one source, Watson received the Cambridgeport tract as "compensation for maintaining an aged colored woman, formerly a slave, called Venus Whittemore; although by some defect in the written obligations, she finally became a public charge and died in the almshouse May
4, 1825, aged 107" (Paige, 681). Watson’s land ran between Pearl and Brookline Streets from
Massachusetts Avenue to Valentine Street, and along present William and Cottage streets to
Pleasant Street, The complete title to this land has not been searched, but it may have originated
with Deacon Samuel Whittemore (1693-1784), Watson’s maternal grandfather who previously
owned Watson's house in Harvard Square and possibly also Venus Whittemore. Watson died in
1811, the same year as Francis Dana; his son Abraham Watson and other heirs were responsible
for laying out streets and selling building lots.

Part of the development of Watson’s land included Cottage Street, which was laid out in 1816
(five years after the opening of the River Street Bridge), but no buildings were constructed on
this two-block-long street for almost twenty years. The first houses built on the street were the
vernacular workers cottages at 3 and 5-7 Cottage Street built on lots that Charles Valentine, soap
manufacturer, purchased from the Watson estate in 1835. These were followed in 1838 by no. 24
built by Adoniram Wentworth, a Lynn housewright, and sold the next year to Flavel Coolidge.
The first Greek Revival houses on the street were the two 1½ story cottages at 40 and 44 that
were designed by local architect William Hovey in 1839 and have full temple fronts with Doric
columns. (A third Hovey & Markham cottage was built the same year at no. 48 but it has been
more significantly altered and was set apart by an infill three-decker in 1910). Similar 1½ - and
2–story Greek Revival houses with columned porches followed at nos. 8 (1843), 36 (1845), and
6 (1856). The first known mention of Cottage Street by name is in an 1839 deed. A number of
Greek Revival cottages and houses without columned porches were also added in the 1840s.
A woodcut illustration of a typical New England cottage was published in the New England Cultivator, a Boston weekly journal featuring articles about agriculture, horticulture, literature, and
mechanics. The article describes this house form, which had by then become very popular, as
“…a story-and-a-half cottage in one of our suburban towns. The building has a piazza front, contains seven rooms, with pantry, clothes-press, etc., and is a convenient house for a small family.
Its cost is about $2000, the interior finish being very good.”

2.4.b

Cambridge architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham purchased a
parcel of land on Cottage Street measuring 126’ wide by 83’ deep from Abraham A. Watson and
the other Watson heirs. They designed and built two similar Greek Revival cottages at 40 and 44
Cottage Street and sold them later that year to Andrew H. Newell and William Page, respectively. Hovey & Markham had collaborated earlier on houses on Green Street and Austin Street
(demolished), as well as 40-48 William Street nearby. Hovey went on to design several dozen
additional houses in Cambridge, primarily in Cambridgeport, while all of Markham’s Cambridge
work was in the 1830s with Hovey.
Andrew Newell, a Boston merchant, purchased 40 Cottage Street just weeks before marrying
Martha Valentine, the daughter of a local soap manufacturer. They remained in Cambridge for a
number of years and started a family before relocating to Brookline.
Through the years, 40 Cottage Street was owned and occupied by a number of prominent Cantabrigians. Francis Hardy purchased the property in 1868. He had risen through the ranks at Henry
Thayer & Co. (a pharmaceutical manufacturer) and was its owner until falling ill in 1896. Georgiana Robinson, wife of shoe stain manufacturer Fred O. Robinson, was active in the community
including as the president of the local chapter of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and
member of the women’s auxiliaries to the Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., and the Margaret Fuller House.
The property passed via probate to William R. Chafe. There was a family relationship between
the Robinson and Chafe families, with William Chafe being listed as the step-son of Fred Robinson. William R. Chafe was an office manager at the United Farmer Milk Co. of Boston, an active
member of the masons, a vocalist and member of the Handel & Haydn Society.
Prior to the current owners, the last owner of 40 Cottage was William H. Chafe (son of William
R. Chafe). He grew up in the house, attended Cambridge High & Latin, and received a scholarship to Harvard. He attended college while living at home and did very well. He won a fellowship to travel one summer in Europe and then another to attend a year at a seminary. Preferring
history over religious studies, Chafe went on to be a history professor and is currently the Alice
Mary Baldwin Professor Emeritus of History at Duke University. He has written many books on
American history, civil rights, and political figures.
Robin Chase, who leased and agreed to purchase the property in 1989 (with title transfer in
1994), co-founded Zipcar, a car sharing company, in 2000 and served as its CEO until 2003. She
is a co-founder of Veniam, Inc., a network communications company. Her husband and coowner, Roy Russell, was Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer of Zipcar
and is also a co-founder of Veniam.
No. 44 Cottage Street was sold in 1839 by Hovey and Markham to William Page, an iron
dealer. Moses W. Fish bought the house from Charles S. Dudley ca. 1849. Fish was a dealer in
hats, bonnets, and accessories. He had a retail establishment on Hanover Street in Boston and
later sold wholesale millinery goods in New York City. Born in 1813 in Mason, New Hampshire,
Mr. Fish lived until 1893. He retained the home at 44 Cottage Street even while doing business
in New York and was described in his obituary in the Cambridge Tribune as “an old and respected citizen…remembered as a peculiar and interesting figure on the streets and was one of
the old landmarks which one is apt to find sunning on Main street pleasant afternoons.”

2.4.b

Fish’s son, Charles C. R. Fish, sold the property in 1905 to William H. Chafe (father of William
R. Chafe and Georgianna Chafe Blasi). Georgianna Blasi inherited the property from her mother,
Annie Greelaw Chafe, and retained it until 1992 when she sold it to Anne M. Strong. Anne
Strong and Charles E. Allen became co-owners of the property in 1994.
William H. Chafe was a sales manager for a sandpaper company in Boston and was an active
Mason in Cambridge’s Royal Arch chapter. His daughter, Georgianna Chafe, was a graduate of
Radcliffe College and Boston University. She taught at Cambridge High & Latin before marrying John V. Blasi, a dentist in Chestnut Hill.
Anne M. Strong was a graduate of Smith College and Suffolk University Law School. She was
the Affirmative Action Officer and the Rent Control Hearing Board Officer for the City of Cambridge. She founded CityKicks, a soccer program for underserved communities. She passed
away in 2013. Charles E. Allen graduated from Harvard College. He founded Charlie Allen Renovations in 1978. The construction company on River Street in Cambridge specializes in historic
renovations and restorations.

Relationship to Criteria

A. Criteria for Landmark Designation
The enabling ordinance for landmark designation states:
The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or object
which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or
social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or architecturally significant (in terms of its period, style, method of construction or association with a famous
architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures . . . (City
Code, Article III, Chapter 2.78.180.A)
B. Relationship of Property to Criteria
The properties at 40 and 44 Cottage Street meet criterion (1) for their associations with the economic and social history of Cambridge. Architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham’s completion of the cottages, the first homes built in this block, prompted additional high quality development on the street. Their construction in 1839 was the start of a period
of rapid development in the Cambridgeport neighborhood, which was growing and industrializing in the middle of the nineteenth century. The families that resided in these homes were and are
leaders in local businesses and social and service organizations.
The cottages also meet criterion (2) as being architecturally significant examples of the Greek
Revival style. The staff considers them eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places. The pattern of development set by these homes for this side of the block maximized the
usable yard space by positioning the homes on the far west side of the lots. Though both homes

11

2.4.b

sat vacant for a time before their purchase by their current owners, they retained their architectural integrity and were successfully renovated by their owners to bring back original features of
the homes.
IV.

Recommendations

A. Article III, Chapter 2.78.140
The purpose of landmark designation is contained in the enabling ordinance, which is to:
preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of the City and to improve the
quality of its environment through identification, conservation and maintenance of . . .
sites and structures which constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural,
cultural, political, economic or social history of the City; to resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to this purpose; [and] to foster appropriate use and wider public knowledge and appreciation of such . . . structures . . .
B. Preservation Options
Landmark designation or donation of preservation restrictions are the two best options for longterm protection and preservation. With property values continuing ever upward, lots such as
these with potential for denser development will remain at risk of demolition or inappropriate development. The demolition delay ordinance does not provide permanent protections.
C. Staff Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission find that the Hovey & Markham cottages are eligible
for landmark designation as defined in the ordinance for the reasons stated above. The designation should incorporate the renovations and additions that were approved on October 5, 2017 as
shown on plans by Boyes Watson Architects titled, “40 Cottage St., Cambridge, MA,” and dated
September 20, 2017.
If implemented by the City Council, landmark designation would allow the Commission to review and approve publicly-visible exterior alterations with the goal of protecting the historic integrity of the buildings and their setting. The designation would not regulate use, plant materials,
or alterations to interior features.
V. Standards and Criteria
Under Article III, the Historical Commission is charged with reviewing any construction, demolition or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features (other than color) of a designated
landmark. This section of the report describes exterior architectural features that are among the
characteristics that led to consideration of the property as a landmark. Except as the order designating or amending the landmark may otherwise provide, the exterior architectural features described in this report should be preserved and/or enhanced in any proposed alteration or construction that affects those features of the landmark. The standards following in paragraphs A

Packet Pg. 49

Attachment: 40 and 44 Cottage St FINAL designation report (002) (CMA 2018 #56 : 40 Cottage Street landmark designation report)

12

2.4.b

and B of this section provide guidelines for the treatment of the landmark described in this report.
A. General Standards and Criteria
Subject to review and approval of exterior architectural features under the terms of this report,
the following standards shall apply:
1. Significant historic and architectural features of the landmark should be preserved.
2. Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced.
3. When replacement of architectural features is necessary, it should be based on documentary evidence. Restoration of missing architectural features should be considered
when non-original fabric is proposed for alteration or replacement.
4. New materials should, whenever possible, match the original material in physical
properties, design, color, texture, and appearance. The use of imitation replacement
materials is generally discouraged.
5. The surface cleaning of a landmark should be done by the gentlest possible means.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that damage exterior architectural features
shall not be used.
6. Additions should not destroy significant exterior architectural features and should not
be incongruous to the historic aspects, architectural significance, or distinct character
of the landmark, neighborhood, and environment.
7. Additions should be designed in a way that, if they were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the landmark would be unimpaired.
B. Suggested Review Guidelines
1.

Site Development.
Additions to the Hovey & Markham cottages, if allowed, should respect the form,
massing and materials of the original without slavishly imitating it.
Alterations to or additions of publicly visible landscape structures, including walls,
fences, paths, driveways, and the like, should be complementary to the houses. Staff
recommends that fencing and landscape structures behind the front wall plane of the
houses (and not connected to them) be exempted from review.

2. Alterations
a. Exterior surfaces and ornamentation
Traditional exterior materials should be preserved insofar as practicable. Special
care should be taken to protect and maintain the appearance of the wood win-

2.4.b

dows, trim, cladding, and columns. Abrasive cleaning methods such as sandblasting should not be used. Restoration of missing architectural features, though not a
requirement of owners of landmarked buildings, is encouraged and should be
based on documentary evidence such as historic photographs. Where modern materials are proposed for the approved addition at 40 Cottage Street, future alterations should be compatible with those materials and design details.
b. Fenestration
Alteration of existing or introduction of new window openings on the front portions of the buildings should be compatible with the Greek Revival style. More
flexibility should be granted for alteration of window openings on the newer additions. Replacement sash should be compatible in pattern and appearance with the
original. Storm windows may be installed without review, in conformance with
current Commission policy.
c. Secondary Structures
Fencing at the front sidewalk should be kept below 48” so that views of the house
are not obstructed.

VI.

Proposed Orders
A. (40 Cottage Street)

That the Hovey & Markham Cottage, at 40 Cottage Street, be designated as a protected landmark
pursuant to Chapter 2.78, Article III, Section 2.78.180 of the Code of the City of Cambridge, as
recommended by vote of the Cambridge Historical Commission on February 1, 2018. The premises so designated are the land defined as parcels 92 on assessor’s map 104 and the structures
thereon and the premises described in the deed recorded in Book 24,692/Page 516 at the South
Middlesex Registry of Deeds.
This designation is justified by the important associations of the properties with the economic
and social history of Cambridge as well as by the architectural significance of the Greek Revival
cottage.
The effect of this designation shall be that review by the Cambridge Historical Commission and
the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness, Hardship or Non-Applicability shall be required
before any construction activity can take place within the designated premises or any action can
be taken affecting the appearance of the premises, that would in either case be visible from a
public way. Such review and approval shall not be required for the completion of renovations
and additions as described on plans by Boyes Watson Architects titled, “40 Cottage St., Cambridge, MA,” and dated September 20, 2017 which are incorporated into the designation report
and were approved by the Historical Commission at a public hearing on October 5, 2017. In

Re: thank you and further actions

It’s about 3:44 am early Thursday morning March 1st. I was awakened about half an hour ago by the sound of a car crash
outside my building at 1699 Cambridge Street. I dressed and went outside to see if my car had been hit. Luckily it had
not but a driver coming from the direction of Harvard Yard towards Inman Square struck a parked car in front of the
condo building at the corner of Cambridge and Felton Streets (Foxcroft Manor?). That is precisely where the
reorganization of driving lanes on Cambridge Street begins. Instead of beginning the absurd slalom down the street, the
car continued to drive straight into the back of a parked car that likely appeared to him to be in the driving lane because
it was so far from the curb. So much for increasing safety.
I don’t know if the driver was impaired, but in the dark, at that point on the street, and from that direction, it looks like
no one is parked next to the curb and there are simply cars in what is assumed to be a driving lane.
During the last snow storm, the bike lane in front of my building was cleared and the snow was piled high in the only
handicapped parking space in front of my building, rendering it useless for more than a week. The handicapped parking
spaces nearest to Skenderian Apothecary were also used as a dumping spot for the ice and snow removed from the bike
lanes there. Robert Skenderian should be included in the working group. He is well positioned to observe how the city is
mistreating the elderly and the physically impaired.
What the city has done on Cambridge Street is wrong and the proposed working group needs to review this ill-conceived
plan and return Cambridge Street to its original condition.
Cambridge Street should never have been considered for this plan because of the fire department, hospital, and assisted
living facility that are located between Harvard Yard and Inman Square. Too many emergency services vehicles travel
this area of the street. It should remain straight and open for emergency use. Why wasn’t Broadway chosen instead? It’s
mostly residential and not heavily traveled by vehicles. It’s a far better street for bicycles.

Support for P.O. 17: Home Rule Petition for Right of First Refusal

Dear Mayor McGovern, and Esteemed City Councillors,
I am writing to debunk some of the criticisms of Policy Order 17: That the City Manager is requested to direct
the City Solicitor to draft language for a home rule petition for a Cambridge Right of First Refusal Legislation.
There has been criticism of Right of First Refusal by Cambridge property owners. These folks are right to
express concern for their personal property, and what a Right of First Refusal might mean for who they can
sell to, when, and for how much. Several of the argument's I've heard, however, seem to be misinformed.
These arguments are that (1) Right of First Refusal impinges on the abilities for folks to get above-market
value for their property, (2) Right of First Refusal complicates the transfer of property among family members
when a tenant has elected to exercise their Right of First Refusal, (3) Right of First Refusal delays sales. I will
try to debunk these one by one:
(1) Right of First Refusal enables a tenant or tenant's organization with Right of First Refusal worked into the
lease to match the offer presented by another bidder. This does not mean that the tenant's offer is lower than
the other offers, or strictly the market value of the property. What it means is that if the tenant is able to
match the offer being considered by the property owner, the tenant's offer is the one that will be accepted.
This enables the seller to receive a competitive offer and enables the tenant to own the property which
she/he has lived in. Right of First Refusal is a best-case scenario for a City worried about displacement of
current residents and its sustainability as a community. It enables property owners to sell "high", but also
gives tenants a leg-up in a wild, hyper-competitive real estate climate.
Right of First Refusal in the City of Cambridge will not scare off potential buyers. Sellers seem worried that, in
a City with Right of First Refusal, we won't see the bidding wars that often lead to all-cash or half-cash
purchases at far above listing prices. This is supported by some fear-mongering literature on real estate sites
that suggest that if a lease has a Right of First Refusal provision, the seller will not get the highest prices
possible for their home or condo. Again, I would add that the tenant must match the best offer being
considered by the seller. Thus, the tenant's bid may still be far above the property's listing price, as the offer
being matched may very well be. Also--depending on the terms of the provision--tenants with Right of First
Refusal may even need to match other parts of an offer, such as the type of mortgage (30, 15, 10, etc.) and the
amount of the down payment.
(2) Policy Order 17 directs the City Solicitor to draft language for a Home Rule Petition. This means that the
City Solicitor can draft language that enables exemptions from the Right of First Refusal provision. This is
supported by legal experts, including real estate attorney Marsha L. Collett, Esq. As Marsha writes:
•

"Exceptions to the Right of First Refusal: Certain transactions typically may be excepted from a right of first
refusal. For example, an owner should have the ability to sell or transfer property to the owner’s trust or to
family members without first offering it to the holder of the right of first refusal. What happens upon death

Perez, Lori

3.7.a

(3) The only thing the seller might lose is time. And, by time, I mean the time as legally granted to the tenant
to match an offer. This time frame can be negotiated, debated, and worked into the provision, as I understand
it. It needn't be so lengthy as to become a hardship for the seller. A long delay between when the other bid
has been considered by the property owner and when the tenant has put forward her/his offer can be avoided
if the tenant has sufficient notice that the owner intends to sell. Working to make sure that tenants have ample
notice of the property sale prior to putting it on the market gives them plenty of time to seek out a mortgage
pre-approval and move around funds to enable a cash offer and/or the sale of other assets to match the
competitive price.
Right of First Refusal benefits sellers, tenants, and the City. It enables sellers to select the best offer, tenants to
match it, and the City to become a community in which renters can actually become homeowners.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best,

Cambridge City Manager Louis DePasquale

Cambridge City Clerk Donna Lopez
Dlopez@cambridgema.gov
To the Honorable City Council:
On behalf of Green Cambridge, I am writing to express our organization's support for the Envision
Alewife Working Group's letter dated November 29, 2017. That letter requests immediate,
thorough study, including engineering feasibility and cost analysis, of​ a pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle
bridge across the railroad tracks to connect the Quadrangle and Triangle areas and a commuter
rail stop, and evaluation of two additional connections, a rail crossing at Cambridgepark Drive and
a pedestrian/bicycle bridge at the Little River. ​Green Cambridge​ concurs with the Council's Policy
Order directing the City Manager to consult with City staff and respond to the Working Group's
unanimous concerns at a public hearing.
As Cambridge develops a vision for transformative private development in the Alewife area, we
agree with the Working Group that a similar level of attention should be devoted to the public
realm, including transportation infrastructure and open space. Serious analysis and a
forward-looking vision for the public realm are needed immediately, and are critical to create safe,
healthy, sustainable and resilient neighborhoods in the Alewife area.
Green Cambridge is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a more sustainable
city and to protect the environment for the health and safety of all. We have worked in the city for
more than 10 years and have been a driving force on energy use through the Net Zero ordinance,
tree protection with the Tree Task Force, urban farming with our partnerships with DPW on rain
barrels and composting and our new demonstration communal urban farm in East Cambridge, and
our work advocating for sustainable transportation throughout the city.
It is imperative from a climate perspective that Cambridge not only provides but prioritizes
sustainable transportation infrastructure -- anything that stops promotion of the use of single
passenger automobiles. Transportation greenhouse gas emission are now the state’s biggest
contributor to potential climate disaster, and the environmental damage of producing fossil fuels
continues to grow.

when a City can change their bureaucratic culture to meet ambitious goals. Our Working Group has

Alewife in particular is the City’s chance to change course in a big way by building a neighborhood
devoted to green space that mitigates storm water issues, energy efficient buildings, compact land
use promoting wildlife protection, and a 40% tree canopy coverage to match what we see in other
parts of Cambridge. All of this rests with a robust sustainable transportation network, and that
begins with a bridge across the railroad tracks.

The Alewife Bridge: A 21st Century Path!

To Whom it May Concern
I am writing on behalf of thousands of Bay State bicycle riders to support the proposal to construct the bike-Ped bridge
the could connect active users to Alewife, a proposed commuter rail station, commercial centers and a bucolic respite
offered in the area.
During my many talks and presentations around the state, I often tout Alewife as the greatest example of multi-modal
connectivity in America. Commuters can choose between bicycles, cars, trains, subways, buses and even their feet from
that single nexus. The Minuteman Bikeway alone is taking as many as 1,000 cars out of the Route 2 traffic jam every day
as residents from all along that corridor choose to bike.
But there is more to come. With dock less bike share, Hubway, Zipcar, Uber, Lyft and Bridj re-defining the streetscape, we
can reduce that congestion even further. Add to that the extension of the MassCentral Rail Trail, to be extended through
Belmont, Waltham, Weston, Wayland and Sudbury by 2020, Alewife will be drawing even more active commuters out of
their cars and into that transportation processor known as Alewife from the West. The connection from the Mystic River
and emerging community paths of Somerville will also fuel more usage.
The entire 20th Century saw communities building out roadways based on projections of "VMT" increases. We now use
"PMT" (or "People Miles Traveled") to justify the construction of the Alewife Bridge.
We hope the city will support this initiative.

Richard Fries

Inman Square on agenda tonight

Dear Councillor Kelley,
Wayne showed me an email from you which he received (but I did not) concerning the presence on tonight's City Council
meeting agenda of the proposals for altering traffic patterns in Inman Square. I found your email to be excellent and
cogent. I write this to support your position. A prior appointment makes it very unlikely that I will be able to attend the
meeting, unfortunately, but I will do so if I can.
In addition to expressing support of your views, I ask, as a long-time resident of Inman Square and a daily pedestrian
there, that the City Council vote to request two sets of information:
The finished and published report on the bicycle-truck collision which caused the death of the bicyclist in Inman
Square, which event has been cited by planners as an impetus for the proposed changes. I do not think we should
proceed under pressure from this sad fatality until we know, as a city, what the authorities think actually happened.
And recent statistics analogous to the oft-cited five-year statistics which showed Inman Square to be "the most
dangerous intersection" in Cambridge. Important alternations have already been made at small cost and with little
disruption to the traffic flow, changes which locals had been recommending informally for decades; and locals voice the
opinion that the flow of traffic is improved and the danger from left-turning cars to cyclists are much reduced as a result. I
have asked for these new statistics in hearings about the proposals, but I have been told that they have not been
collected.
A vote on the first would bring two benefits: the report would be completed at long last, rather than perhaps held back
because the City does not wish to appear to blame anyone, as some of us suspect; and the discussion of the proposals
would benefit from actual information rather than sotto voce speculation. A vote on the second would help us to determine
whether we should wait on the changes proposed until we know the improvements made already are satisfactory in
practice. Let's remember: we don't know what unforeseen effects would arise from such a big revision of Inman Square.
We should at least know if we have any benefit from the more modest changes already made.
Thank you for your interest in this project. It's much appreciated.
Megan Brook

Re housing: Please support policy orders 17 and 18 on the agenda 2/26/18. These may help Cambridge residents stay in
the city, and 18 obviously would help us fund more affordable housing.
Re #17, I was able to buy my own house, in the early 1980s, because I had been a tenant and the owner gave me first
option. I have been thankful for her consideration ever since. As the owner of the same 2 unit house now, I see no
disadavantage in this. Re #18, We obviously need more affordable housing for all: those who can own and those who
will continue to rent.
Re transportation & development: Please support #7 re transit and safety in the Alewife area -- this situation must be
addressed, it is long overdue.

Policy Order regarding Alewife Bridge/Rail Stop

Hi all,
We (the Cambridge Bicycle Safety Core Team) wanted to write a quick note of support for tonight's policy
order in support of a pedestrian/bicycle bridge and rail stop in Cambridge’s Alewife neighborhood.
It is critical to build connectivity for high quality transit, bicycle, and pedestrian access as soon as possible,
because transportation patterns need to be set now, before the area is totally redeveloped, not afterwards.
Despite its proximity to the MBTA Red Line, the Alewife neighborhood is, in large part, being built around car
travel with a serious lack of safe pedestrian or bicycle infrastructure. Many new developments have large
parking garages because of minimum parking requirements and streets lack appropriate or safe design to
encourage safe walking or bicycling. Alewife Brook Parkway remains dangerous to cross as a pedestrian or
bicycle next to, with many narrow or poorly maintained sidewalks.
The proposed bridge and rail stop would help reverse this trend, setting the tone for a much more livable,
equitable neighborhood that supports the safety of all residents.
Sincerely,
Cambridge Bicycle Safety Core Team

I make the trek across the Trader Joes parking lot (dodging traffic), across the intersection of Alewife Brook Pkwy and
Terminal Rd (where folks turning right off of the Pkwy generally ignore the "no turn on red"), across the bridge (which
ranges from just busy, to an icy or slush/snow mess in the winter) to alewife and back every day.
For how close we are to the alewife T station, it really should not be such an adventure to reach it.

Hi all
I'd like to weigh in on the policy order regarding adding seniors to the re-convened Cambridge
Street Stakeholder Group.
I think that it's good for a broad range of seniors to be included in this conversation. For
example, starting approximately a year and a half ago, Cambridge Bicycle Safety has
repeatedly requested to meet with the Mayor's Senior Advisory Group. This group was started
by Councillor Simmons as Mayor and continued under Mayor McGovern, both of whom are cosponsors of this order. So far that meeting hasn't happened yet, but we remain eager to meet
with the group!
One misperception that is important to correct is that there is a dichotomy between seniors and
bicyclists, with the two groups at odds over street space. I don't think this is true. For example,
many seniors bicycle already, many more would bicycle if the streets were safer. Cambridge
Bicycle Safety includes several seniors as part of our Core Team, and several more as
important advisors. Safer streets benefit all seniors, whether they are driving, walking, bicycling,
or riding the bus.
Sincerely,
Nate Fillmore

Upcoming policy orders

I would like to add my voice to those who support these two policy orders. The first is to begin a discussion of a local Cambridge
policy that would give tenants first refusal to purchase their home if it goes up for sale. The second is to encourage a new Nexus
Study to evaluate the rate for "linkage fees" paid to the Affordable Housing Trust.

Policy Order #17:That the City Manager is requested to direct the City Solicitor to draft language for a home rule
petition for a Cambridge Right of First Refusal Legislation. A number of cities throughout the country are considering or
have enacted similar legislation as a strategy to prevent displacement of residents and allow tenants the first opportunity of
purchase if the home in which they are living goes up for sale. As the state considers enabling legislation, we should be
engaged in the process of designing our own local version of this option for stability for tenants. Once we have draft language,
we hope for a wide discussion of how to tailor our local order to fit local conditions and meet the concerns of tenants and
property owners alike.

Policy Order #18:That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Community Development Department to
develop a timeline for the next Incentive Zoning Nexus Study.The Incentive Zoning Ordinance was first passed by the
Council in 1998 as a “linkage fee” to be paid by large commercial developments to the Affordable Housing Trust to create and
maintain affordable housing. That fee can be recalculated and reset by the Council every three years using an outside
evaluator’s Nexus Study, but it was not until residents urged a new Study be undertaken that the fee was finally raised (more
than doubled) in 2015. Given the massive commercial development that occurred during that 17-year period, untold amounts of
funds were left uncollected for affordable housing. It is now 2018, three years are about to pass, so it is time to conduct a new
Nexus Study to determine whether a new increased rate is justified. We urge you to work with the City Manager and the
Community Development Department to see that the Study is implemented with all deliberate speed.

Thank you,
Ann Fleck-Henderson

Alewife area pedestrian and bike bridge over the rail tracks, commuter rail stop

Dear Councilors
I love the widely-used tunnel under the rail tracks near Pemberton Street, behind the Peabody School and so I am
confident a similar access route west of Alewife is a critical connection for those neighborhoods! The Pemberton tunnel
is widely used and makes it possible for folks to easily walk or bike without having to take a long, crowded, unpleasant
and dangerous route around on Sherman Street. There is no question that because of the tunnel, many fewer cars are
traveling the congested roads in my neighborhood.
I don't know if you've ever walked or ridden a bike along side of Alewife Brook Parkway over the train tracks and by the
strip malls but I have to say it is really unpleasant. If you build a ped/bike route to the train station from the area off of
Concord Ave west of the Fresh Pond rotary there will be a great benefit to the whole community, because fewer people
will drive on that very congested road. In addition it will create a much safer and more pleasant experience for the users
of the ped/bike rail crossing and enhance value of the real estate along Concord Ave by creating a new connection to
Alewife T station.
I hope you'll vote to fund a pedestrian and bike bridge over the tracks!
Thanks
Ruthann

Policy order passed on 2/12 working group

Dear Councillors and Mr. De Pasquale:
I write as a Cambridge resident, voter and taxpayer of 31 years concerning the policy order passed by the Council on
Feb. 12 which included the creation of a working group to, among other other objectives, review the bike lane
configurations that have caused serious controversies in our city.
I testified at the hearing in support of this order and I thank the drafters of the order and the Council for passing it. Its
passage by the council shows that Cambridge is a city where all views and empirical evidence will be taken into account
in public policy decisions. As a former state official under Gov. Patrick (head of his office of consumer affairs and
business regulation), I know first hand how difficult it is for policy makers to fulfill the expectations of diverse citizen
groups affected by government decisions. That is why integrity and public confidence in those shaping such decisions is
all important.
In that vein, first, I would like to urge that the working group be created as soon as possible and second, that Robert
Skenderian be appointed as a member.
Mr. Skenderian is a long time Cambridge resident and family business owner with a record of civic engagement and
personal integrity. His families' apothecary serves generations of Cambridge residents and has been featured on
national news programs as an example of independent pharmacies still serving their communities.
Importantly, Mr. Skenderian is pro-safety for all and believes in safe bike lane configurations that benefit cyclists,
pedestrians, and motorists.
He would bring an independent, rational and balanced perspective to all the issues covered by the policy order.
I strongly urge that Mr. Skenderian be appointed.
All Cambridge residents will benefit.
Thank you for considering my recommendation.
Barbara Anthony.

those (ugh) bike lanes

I continue to be VERY inconvenienced by the bike lanes on Cambridge Street, almost getting hit by a
city bus as I tried to maneuver for the one packing spot left in front of Skenderians. There used to be
at least 15 parking places along that block; now there are 5. They are all on one side of the street, so
someone coming from the Common (West) has to turn around to park. Since they are out in the
middle of the street (while the bike lanes are along the curb) getting in and out of one’s car is
impossible if there is traffic. I think it is pretty dangerous, and I’m waiting for someone to get hit
getting in or out of their car. Especially the patrons of Skenderians, many of whom are old, not in very
good health, probably might not see or hear well. Everybody is in a snit about bicyclists getting hit,
but no care for the rest of the population, especially the old, the lame and the halt.
The bike lanes take public property and give them away, without any vote or discussion, to a minority
of the city’s population and some of the bicyclists might not even be city residents, thus not property
tax payers (as I am).
The whole thing is UNFAIR and makes no sense, if the safety of the ENTIRE population is to be
considered. Cambridge Street has now been narrowed and is much less safe, perhaps even for the
bicyclists. All traffic (except for the favored bikes) is now crowded into the center of the street. And
there is a hospital just up from Skenderians, so emergency vehicles have to weave through this mess.
The bike lobby says that more bikes on the road means fewer cars and thus less traffic. I don’t even
think that is so, but even if it were, the clogging the streets with the bike lanes crowds the traffic —
cars and the huge buses — and thus SLOWS what traffic there is down.
I did see a bike come down Cambridge Street as I was leaving the store. One. The whole street is
clogged and slowed so ONE bicyclist can go down their protected lane.
I feel very sour towards the city about this. I’m 74 and have two replaced hips. I’M supposed to hop
on a bike?!!!!! AND in New England winter (even though we have not had much snow, it DOES SNOW
and even worse, cold, sleety rain.)

City Bike Lanes

To whom it may concern:

I fully appreciate that Cambridge is trying to create a safe lane for biking, but as I mentioned in an earlier email, I feel the
current solution is not working well. It has increased traffic and congestion, created other hazards (extremely narrow
streets, reduced visibility of pedestrians crossing the street), limited parking, and hurt local businesses.
As part of your working group, I think it is important to have representation from all members of the community.
Therefore, I would like to request that Robert Skenderian from Skendarian Apothecary be part of your working group.
Robert and his family have been in Cambridge for decades, running a local family business. They live and work on a
street that is impacted by the current bike lane configuration.
I hope that the working group can quickly come to a better bike lane solution. Thank you very much for your time.

Feb 12 policy order on new expanded bike lane review working group

Good evening, everyone ~~
I want to thank the Council for their recent policy order on the 12th which calls for an all-stakeholder
bike lane review working group.
Under current conditions, incidents still occur. Last week I was crossing Felton St and saw a lady
cyclist coming towards me ON the Foxcroft Manor sidewalk. I also saw a young couple approaching
the same corner on Felton; they were coming from my left. I raised my hand to the cyclist to warn her
of the couple and I told the couple to watch out that a collision was imminent. The couple stopped; the
cyclist continued coming on despite the fact that her corner view to those pedestrians was blocked by
arborvitae trees. Perhaps the cyclist thought I was joking. When she suddenly saw the couple, she
veered towards me. A more surprised individual she could not have been! Had I not done anything,
three people could have been seriously injured. Lesson learned? Pedestrians take direction better
than cyclists.
Anyway, I hail you for agreeing to form a broader working group of stakeholders in this issue. Please
form this group quickly as the Winter has been pretty mild but Spring is quite near on the horizon.
Spring surely will bring out more cyclists but the current problems will still be with us. I am sure
Robert Skenderian would be an asset to this new working group as he has been a long time resident
who has both a business and a family with children and an elderly senior. He wears many hats so
wearing yet one more will not bother him. Please take my email as my nomination of him to represent
the Cambridge St Bike Lane Neighborhood.
Thank you.

Cambridge Street Bicycle Lanes

I applaud the City Council for hearing our voices. The implementation of a policy order to revisit the issue of bike lanes
on Cambridge St. shows a recognition that it is essential to address the diverse needs and safety issues of our entire
community. Our neighbors and businesses are hopeful that an exploratory group can provide us with an expeditious
and global outcome.
I would like to recommend that Robert Skenderian be a representative on the committee. He is an impassioned
supporter of our neighborhood, and he best knows the negative impact that the Cambridge Street bike lane
configuration has had on residents and business owners of our Cambridge Street neighborhoods. We have been deeply
inconvenienced and our safety has been compromised.
With thanks,

Subject: Cambridge Street Bicycle Lanes
I am sending the following observations as an addendum to the letter below.
There are limited transportation resources in Cambridge and the new
configuration on Cambridge Street is favoring the safety and access of
bicyclists over those who rely on cars. This is ironic because roads are
financed by gasoline taxes.
How do we share access for the benefit of the entire community? Perhaps a
plausible alternative is to consider how to make better use of side streets
for bicycles as a way to relieve the demand for safe access for all on the
main thoroughfares. The major problem is that the present situation on
Cambridge Street is a blatant sign that we have failed to design the use of
our streets for the benefit of the entire community. The configuration of
the Cambridge Street bicycle lanes favors safe access of one group over

Perhaps some might look at this as discriminatory...

Attachment: Maria Lindberg Cambridge Street Bicycle Lanes (COM 195 #2018 : Maria Lindberg)

I am a long time Cambridge resident and I applaud the efforts of Cambridge
Officials to rectify the complicated problem of bicycle transportation
safety. However, the new configuration of bike lanes on Cambridge Street
has caused troubling safety issues as well as an access problem for
businesses and their patrons.
This is my neighborhood. I patronize Skenderian Apothecary for my
prescriptions and I also support the other businesses on this block. I have
Multiple Sclerosis and am not able to ride my bicycle anymore or to walk
with ease from my nearby home. I rely on my car for independence, and have
always found comfort in the fact that safe and convenient parking was
available to me on Cambridge Street. Ironically, because of the new bike
lane configuration, my safety is now jeopardized, and my access is severely
limited. The new parking limitations are negatively impacting my life, and
my compromised approach to Skenderian's (a life line for so many of us) is
now stressful and at worst, an insurmountable challenge.
These parking challenges are palpable, and the scenario is this: I hold up
traffic trying to squeeze my medium sized sedan into one of the few tight
spaces now available. If I am lucky (and if drivers are patient), I succeed.
The next challenge is to exit the car. Space is tight and opening the car
door is dangerous unless there is NO oncoming traffic. Trying to re-enter
the car is just as problematic-one has to plaster oneself against the car (
and I am a thin person!) until all traffic is clear-only then is it safe to
open the car door. My safety is in jeopardy each and every time I enter and
exit my car. Rush hour adds even more impediments to safe parking access,
and I now think twice about what time is a safe time to visit businesses on
my block. I love my neighborhood for many reasons, and one is because of the
easy access I have had to amenities, now sadly a thing of the past. Friends
and family visit me on Trowbridge Street with trepidation ("Why don't we
meet somewhere else") as they anticipate traffic nightmares exacerbated by
the Cambridge Street bike lanes.
Here are more examples of the impact of the Cambridge Street
reconfiguration: Rush hour traffic is now prolonged due to limited space
for timely passage. Parking, drop offs and pickups impede traffic flow. I
have experienced ambulances trying to pass but there was no space for cars
to pull over-oh yes, there is a hospital on Cambridge St.! Fire
Engines-again, it is extremely difficult for a motorist to pull over,
especially where Cambridge Street now has curvy lines. Trucks unloading
supplies now completely block lanes, frequently impeding the progress of
drivers. Cambridge Ridge and Latin-morning arrivals and dismissal-I am told
by parents who drive their children that they now must consider the time
factor in anticipation of traffic delays caused by the narrowing of
2

Cambridge Street. I can imagine what the scenario will be if we have a
winter of heavy snow and ice.

Attachment: Maria Lindberg Cambridge Street Bicycle Lanes (COM 195 #2018 : Maria Lindberg)

And...Harvard Square...why make a difficult parking situation worse???
Again, traffic delays are prolonged because of vehicles trying to parallel
park in the now narrowed lane. On trash pickup day one should completely
avoid driving through The Square. It took me 15 minutes (it used to be very
quick) to proceed through Harvard Square because the street is too narrow to
drive past the trash trucks and tow trucks. Why not just make Harvard Square
a pedestrian walkway with bicycle access instead of creating more chaos??
Currently, the word on the street is that Harvard Square as a "go to" is now
a "rethink" for people who rely on driving.
I fully support the need to provide better safety for our biking community,
but this is not an "Us versus Them" scenario. There must be a way that will
result in the safest situation for all members of our community and every
mode of transportation. Safety measures for one group should not compromise
safety and accessibility for others. This is a complicated problem with
many subtleties, and deserves much more thought and the consideration of the
whole community.
Thank you.

Implementation of Working Group re Bike Lanes

Dear member of the council;
I am glad the you are implementing a working policy group for the city, and hope tha tit can happen as soon as possible.
I am suggesting that Robert Skenderian be a member of this policy group as a long time highly respected business owner
who deals with many of issues that need to be heard for out community to serve us all. He has also stepped up to address
the street issues and is knowledgeable about the business concerns and the needs of many us.
I live adjacent to Cambridge Street and am very concerned about traffic issues and pedestrian safety and small business
owners and my own navigation of Cambridge Street. Between the buses, bikes, cars parked and Uber stop and goes, it is
almost impossible to walk and cross this congested street or even be seen doing so. Parking is a nightmare as well as
side streets are more used as there are less spaces on Cambridge Street. The three health facilities on the street as well
need to have more safe access.
Re Uber I have felt for a long time that part of the congestion and traffic issues in the city is due to the number of Uber
cars which are constantly on the street and making sudden stops on many corners by bike and bus lanes. A dangerous
issue that needs attention as well..
Again I appreciate this policy order and hope that other small business owners and diverse members of the community
including older adults will be represented..
Respectfully

policy order and review board

As a Cambridge citizen, I am very pleased to learn of the passage of a policy order to review the bike lane problems in
our city. I hope that the working group doing the review can get started on this issue as soon as possible. Because of my
long-term relationship with Skenderian Apothecary, I strongly recommend that Robert Skenderian be a member of the
working group. He has a clear sense of this particular situation and how recent changes have caused difficulty for small
businesses in the area. Keeping small businesses in our city is something that will keep Cambridge the special place that
it is.

To All,
I’d like to thank the council for passing the policy order..and request quick action in forming the working group. I’d like
to propose that Robert Skenderian be part of this working group. I’d like Lawrence Cetrulo to be a member if I can
suggest a 2nd person (Robert is first choice). Larry really represents the point of view of everyone we know and is very
articulate and good dealing with conflict and compromise.
Thanks, Lynn Cetrulo

Re: proposed landmark designation for 40 Cottage Street

Dear Cambridge City Councilors,
Re: proposed landmark designation for 40 Cottage Street

I am writing to oppose the historical landmark designation of 40 Street. I know the owners well and they are
committed to preserving the historical integrity of this house. They have been working on renovation plans
which will make it much more energy efficient as well as improvements that will ensure that it is well used for
decades to come. We see no reason for the landmark designation.
Cambridgeport has a proud tradition of maintaining our unique character without the need for historic
landmarking of our houses. We are a diverse neighborhood with owners and tenants, full of ethnic, racial, and
socio-economic diversity. Landmarking this house makes it more difficult to maintain this diversity as it makes
the necessary process even of simple repair and maintenance more time consuming and expensive.
We have copied the City Clerk on this message so that it will be included in the meeting record.

entertainment fee

Dear City Councilors, our block of homes on Chilton St. has gathered annually for over 10 years to celebrate the
specialness of living in Cambridge and to help build a sense of community within our immediate neighborhood. Our
Street Party, usually held the second Saturday in September, has garnered a lot of attention from neighboring streets,
thus swelling the gathering, and enabling even more people to make neighborly connections. It has become a wonderful
opportunity for newly arrived residents to meet and greet, especially those with children who might not otherwise have
a chance to connect. It has also become a reunion of sorts for the children of long-time residents who have left the area
but still strongly identify with their Cambridge roots. In addition to the wide array of pot luck offerings, we have been
blessed to enjoy the musical talents of neighbors who live on our street and who graciously entertain us with their lively
and engaging rhythms! It is a delight to see young and old dancing in the street! We do not charge a fee nor do we pay
the musicians for their time. We rely solely on donations from those in attendance. These help to defray the costs of
street closure and various party items and beverages. The extra cost of an entertainment fee puts a major dent in the
money we are able to collect. We understand the City's efforts to contain unnecessary and loud noise, but our party only
runs from 4pm to 7pm and we have never had a complaint from residents not in attendance. We ask you to please help
us to maintain the special energy and sense of belonging that is generated by this party, thanks in great measure to the
band and their enthusiastic efforts to engage everyone. As my conductor/father used to say "Music brings unity to the
community!
Sincerely submitted by, Jana and Peter Dublin, Chilton St. residents since 1973!

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department permits block
parties, which are events hosted by a group of neighbors, a non-profit, or an association
that require the closing of a portion of a City street for part of a day; and

WHEREAS:

As part of the application process, a resident must secure signatures from 75% of
households on the street, submit an application 30 days in advance, and pay a $25 fee;
and

WHEREAS:

The permit fee covers processing of the application, and the Department’s delivery of
plastic orange barrels for use the day of the event, providing that residents still allow
access to emergency vehicles, vehicles of persons with disabilities, and residents
needing to get to and from their homes; and

WHEREAS:

The informational page on the Traffic, Parking & Transportation Department’s website
states that, “providing amplified or acoustical music…at a block party is subject to
approval by Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department and may require approval
by and/or permits from other city agencies”; and

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that obtaining an entertainment permit,
often resulting in an additional $50 fee, can be burdensome to communities, who
finance these events independently; and

WHEREAS:

Often, musicians performing at such events are local and unpaid, making the
possibility of an additional $50 fee appear out of step with the spirit of the event; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge should be encouraging community-building events, such as
neighborhood-organized block parties with local entertainment, but the associated fees
may be too burdensome in certain situations; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Traffic, Parking

departments regarding the possibility of re-evaluating the fees associated with
community block parties, specifically entertainment fees for unpaid, local musicians;
