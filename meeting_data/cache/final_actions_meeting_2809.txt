>> JAMES IS NOT ON THE ZOOM.
>> FRED MYER? YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES. STATE YOUR NAME AND
ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. ONE SECOND. WE HAVE TO TURN ON THE
MICROPHONE. THE GREEN BUTTON.
>> I'M TOTALLY SHOCKED BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR MANY
DECADES. AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE CHAMBERS SO EMPTY AND IF YOU
TOLD ME THAT I WOULD SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND THEIR WOULD BE NO
OTHER CITIZEN IN THE ROOM, I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ARE WRONG. IT IS
TRUE. ISN'T IT WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN PERSON. I'M HERE BECAUSE I
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD.

AND MOST DO FAVOR A NAME CHANGE. MANY, IF NOT MOST OF THEM,
WANT TO SEE A CHOICE OF NAMES ON SOME SORT OF BALLOT. AND THE
PEOPLE WHOSE FIRST CHOICE WAS A MINORITY, WHICH WANTED TO KEEP
THE NAME, ONCE THEY CHECK THAT BOX THEY COULDN'T VOTE FOR A
SECOND, THIRD, OR FOURTH CHOICE. WE ARE USED TO PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION BALLOTING WHERE WE HAVE MANY CHOICES.
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I HEAR COME UP IS WHY THE SCHOOL, WE HAVE
ELIMINATED SCHOOL DISTRICTS LONG AGO. IT ISN'T NECESSARILY WRITTEN
IN STONE THAT THE NEW NAME WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SAME AS THE
SCHOOL. WITH SO MANY PEOPLE NOW BUSSED IN. AND IN ADDITION, I'M
SEEING MORE AND MORE PROGRAMS RIGHTLY BEING NAMED FOR THE
WORTHY MARIA BALDWIN, INCLUDING A NEW ONE BY THE CITY MANAGER. I
LOOKED AT THE NAMES OF THE 13 NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE MAJORITY OF
THEM -- LET'S START WITH THE SCHOOL. OF THE 13, ONLY HALF OF ONE HAS
ANY CONNECTION WITH THE SCHOOL. THAT'S THE
WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON NEIGHBORHOOD. AND MR. HARRINGTON WAS
THE PRINCIPAL AND MR. WELLINGTON HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THE
SCHOOL.
I MIGHT HAVE THE NAMES REVERSED, BUT ONLY 1/2 OF 1 OF THE 13 ARE
NAMED AFTER A SCHOOL. THE QUESTION I HEAR WHY IS IT PRESUMED TO BE
THE SAME AS THE SCHOOL. THE OTHER POINT, THE MAJORITY OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ARE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER GEOGRAPHICAL.
NORTH CAMBRIDGE, EAST CAMBRIDGE, WEST CAMBRIDGE, CAMBRIDGE
HIGHLANDS. THAT'S USEFUL FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW WHERE IT IS. GIVING
ANY PERSON'S NAME AT ALL DOESN'T GIVE ANY INDICATION OF WHERE IT IS.
A NAME LIKE THE GRADUATES SCHOOL NEIGHBORHOOD OR THE HARVARD
AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE HARVARD AND LESLEY NEIGHBORHOOD
WILL SAY WHERE IT IS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP? WE HAVE SASKIA.
>> HELLO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I'M REACHING OUT IN REGARDS TO
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 141, THE CITY MANAGER IS REQUESTED TO DIRECT
THE APPROPRIATE STAFF TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE
ESTABLISHING A PILOT REPARATION PROGRAM THAT WILL TAKE TO
DETERMINE THE REPRESENTATIVE REVENUE FROM THE CANNABIS SALE. AND
MY ORGANIZATION, MASSACHUSETTS RECREATIONAL CONSUMER COUNCIL,
FILED THE EQUITY BILL FOR MASSACHUSETTS. AND WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
LOBBIED FOR GRANTS AND LOAN FORGIVENESS TO BE INCLUDED IN TODAY'S
SOCIAL EQUITY FUND BILL AS WELL AS THE DEMAND FOR MINIMUM OF 25%
IN CANNABIS TAX REVENUE TO GO TOWARD THE FUND. THE HISTORY OF THE
LEGAL LANGUAGE IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS STEMS FROM LOCAL,
BLACK -- FROM OUR CO-FOUNDER. THIS BILL IS ALSO A PARLIAMENT OF
CAMBRIDGE -- PART OF CAMBRIDGE HISTORY WITH OUR CO-FOUNDER, A
GRADUATE OF HARVARD AND MYSELF A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. THE PASSING


PAGE 2

Jun 21, 2021

WILL BE FOR THE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS MASSACHUSETTS. WE ARE HONORED
IN THE WRITING AND EVENTUAL PASSING OF THE BILL. IT IS A LONG-TIME
COMING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT AND CHANGE CANNOT ARRIVE SOON
ENOUGH. THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND THE WAR ON DRUGS IS TWO
SEPARATE POINTS AND SHOULDN'T BE CONFLATED. 2021 MARKS 50 YEARS
OF THE WAR ON DRUGS, CAMBRIDGE DECRIMINALIZE ALL DRUGS OF THIS
YEAR IN 2021. CANNABIS ARREST RATES HAVE INCREASED UP TO 114 TIMES
HIGHER ACROSS MASSACHUSETTS WITH THE MIDDLESEX AT SIX TIMES
HIGHER FOR BLACK RESIDENTS. THE WAR ON DRUG SOCIAL SECURITY
RACIALLY MOTIVATED AND I QUOTE, WE KNOW WE COULDN'T MAKE IT
ILLEGAL TO BE AGAINST THE WAR ON DRUG, BY GETTING THE PUBLIC
TO-ALTHOUGH...
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
DID WE KNOW WE WERE LYING ABOUT THE DRUGS? OF COURSE, WE DID.
WE HAVE FORMER NIXON POLICY CHIEF, IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY
IMPACTED BLACK COMMUNITIES, BUT IT IMPACTS BLACK AND WHITE
COMMUNITIES AS WELL. IN THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM, THE PROGRAM
INCLUDES PEOPLE THAT ARE WOMEN, VETERAN, DISABLED, AND SIMPLY OUR
CASH POOR AND LIVE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS. THIS PROGRAM -SOCIAL EQUITY AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES
WHITE PEOPLE. THE WAY THIS LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN, IT HAS REPARATIONS
GOING TOWARDS WHITE PEOPLE. AS A RESULT, I MAKE SEVERAL
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I HAVE WRITTEN FOR YOU -- TO INCLUDE WHERE
IT IS USED FOR THAT BE STRICKEN AND TO BE USED FOR SOCIAL EQUITY
FUNDS. AND THAT ALL LANGUAGE USED IN REFERENCE TOWARDS SLAVERY...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT. WE'LL SKIP
LEE FERRIS, WHO WILL JOIN IN A MOMENT. WE'LL GO TO CHRIS.
>> HELLO. I'M CHRIS. I'M A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT TUFTS AND I WROTE
AN ESSAY IN THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER REGARDING REPARATIONS. I LIVE
ON ELLIOT -- ON HAMILTON STREET IN CAMBRIDGEPORT. AND SPEAKING TO
POLICY ORDER 141. I COMMEND THIS POLICY ORDER, A STRONGLY BELIEVE
THAT THE CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCILLORS MUST PASS A REPARATIONS BILL. I
THINK THIS WOULD FOLLOW IN THE ESTABLISHED TRAJECTORY OF EVANSTON
AND ASHVILLE AND BEING A POWERFUL STATEMENT OF SOLIDARITY WITH
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AND WITH THE FEDERAL PROJECT OF HR-40.
CAMBRIDGE SHOULD BE A LEADER ON THEIR MATTER, ESPECIALLY GIVEN ITS
HISTORICAL LOCATION AND GIVEN THE WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE
POSSESS IN OUR COMMUNITY.
I WANT TO PRAISE CONGRESS PERSONS SIMMONS FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON
THIS PROJECT. I WANT TO HOLD HER UP AND THANK HER AND THE
COLLABORATORS FOR THE WORK THEY ARE DOING. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
FOUR SHORT POINTS BEFORE MY TIME RUNS OUT. ONE, CAMBRIDGE HAS A
VERY PARTICULAR LEGACY OF BENEFITTING FROM SLAVERY. THIS GOES BACK
TO THE 1600S AND THE ROLL OF NEW ENGLAND AT THE CENTER OF THE
SLAVE TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS IN WHICH NEW ENGLAND CONTINUED TO
BENEFIT ECONOMICALLY ALL THE WAY UP AFTER THE SO-CALLED

PAGE 3

Jun 21, 2021

emancipation, ALL THE WAY TO 1685, THROUGH BUSINESS LINKS. THIS NEED
TO BE REMEDIATED AND WHEN PROCESSES LIKE SLAVERY DO NOT END
PROPERLY, IT MEANS THERE IS AN AFTER-LIFE AND WE SEE THAT IN TERMS OF
SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND INEQUITIES FACED BY THE BLACK CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS UP TO THIS DATE. THIS LEAVES A LEGACY OF HARM TO BE
REMEDIATED. I URGE YOU TO BEGIN THEIR PROJECT OF REMEDIATION.
REMEDIATION IS A PROCESS AND NOT A ONE-OFF EVENT. I WANT TO REALLY
POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROCESS. THE COMMUNITY MUST BE
INVOLVED IN CONSULTATIONS WHILE I RECOMMEND TO SUPPORT THE
PASSING OF THIS BILL, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF IT BE STEP ONE AND STEP TWO
IMMEDIATELY BEGINS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THIS. TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF
CONSULTATION WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS, OLD AND YOUNG, WITH
BLACK LEADERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFITS. AND
WITH BLACK LEADERS OF BUSINESS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP WHAT IS CALLED A
TRULY COMMUNITY-LED TRANSFORMATION MODEL. WE NEED TO HEAR THE
VOICES OF THE COMMUNITY IN STEP TWO OF REPARATIONS FOR
CAMBRIDGEPORT. THIS IS A BEGINNING AND I URGE YOU TO TAKE IT NOW.
MY POINT THREE, MUST BE AN APOLOGY OR ANOTHER APOLOGY AND
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FOR THE DAMAGE DONE BY SLAVERY AND NUMBER
FOUR, I ENCOURAGE THERE BE CONSULTATION WITH THE NATIONAL AFRICAN
AMERICAN REPARATIONS COMMISSION, WHICH IS TAKEN THE LEAD IN
DEVELOPING THE REPARATION PLANS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HASSON. I'M SORRY. LEE FERRIS AND THEN HASSON.
>> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU. I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CHARTER
REFORM POLICY ORDER NUMBER TWO THAT IS ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA.
I'M VERY EXCITED THAT WE ARE FINALLY TAKING A FIRST STEP AT CHARTER
REFORM AND THE CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS ALLIANCE HAS CULTURE CHARTER
REFORM FOR YEARS. I THINK THESE CHANGES ARE A GOOD BEGINNING. THE
COUNCIL CAN APPROVE APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS,
THAT THE COUNCIL CAN ENSURE AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE CITY MANAGER
AND THE COUNCIL DO A COMPREHENSIVE REGULAR REVIEW OF THE CHARTER
AT LEAST EVERY TEN YEARS, STARTING IN 2022, WHICH IS NEXT YEAR. AND I
HOPE THAT NEXT CHARTER REVIEW WILL CONSIDER MORE COMPREHENSIVE
CHANGES. ALL OF THESE ARE CHANGES THAT MANY CITIES AND TOWNS IN
MASSACHUSETTS HAVE ALREADY DONE IN THEIR CHARTERS. SO, I HOPE THAT
YOU WILL PASS THIS PROPOSAL TONIGHT AND THAT THE HOME RULE
PETITION WILL PASS THE STATE HOUSE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING ON
THE CHANGES IN THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER.
I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE HOME RULE PETITION
IS ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT WITH A COMMITTEE REPORT. AND AS YOU
KNOW, IT WOULD PROVIDE MILLIONS IN FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING EVERY YEAR IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M PART OF THE STATEWIDE
TRANSFER FEE COALITION, WHICH IS WORKING FOR STATEWIDE ENABLING
ACT TO ENABLE -- A LOT COMMUNITIES TO ENACT THEIR OWN LOCALLY
DESIGN TRANSFER FEES AND -- MANY CITIES AND TOWNS, SOMERVILLE,
BOSTON, ARLINGTON, BROOKLINE, ET CETERA, THEY HAVE ALREADY PASSED


PAGE 4

Jun 21, 2021

TRANSFER FEE HOME RULE PETITIONS. THE STATE HAS NOT APPROVED ANY
OF THEM YET. CAMBRIDGE PASSING A HOME RULE PETITION FOR A
TRANSFER FEE WOULD ADD TO THE GROWING MOMENTUM TOWARDS
PASSING THAT LEGISLATION. I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL WILL PASS
CAMBRIDGE'S OWN TRANSFER FEE HOME RULE PETITION AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE. IT IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN CALLING
SINCE 2016 FOR A TRANSFER FEE WITHOUT ACTUALLY PASSING A HOME RULE
PETITION. SO, I THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT AND I HOPE YOU WILL MOVE
QUICKLY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HASSON. FOLLOWED BY HEATHER
HOFFMAN.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> I RESIDE 820 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. MY COMMENT TODAY IS
CONCERNING AGENDA ITEM, POLICY ORDER AND RESOLUTION NUMBER ONE.
NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FASHION, CAN AGENDA ITEM POR 1 BE CLASSIFIED AS
UNADULTERATED REPARATIONS. IT IS JUST ANOTHER FULL-HEARTED SCHEME
TO DIVERT PUBLIC MONIES AWAY FROM THE REAL SOCIAL CONCERNS, ISSUES,
AND PROBLEMS. THE PUBLIC MONIES THEY SPEAK OF SHOULD BE GOING
INTO A HOMELESS TRUST FUND.
DISPROPORTIONATELY AND DISTURBING PERCENTAGE OF THE REGION'S
HOMELESS POPULATIONS ARE BLACK MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, IT
MAKES NO SENSE FOR THE MUNICIPAL POLICY-MAKERS TO PARTICIPATE IN
SUCH A VENTURE WHEN THE NEXT BED, MANY OF THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE
WILL HAVE, WILL BE THE CITY'S BRICK AND CONCRETE PAVEMENT. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH JUST A WORD
ABOUT THE PROPOSED STARBUCKS SIGN AT 11 FIRST STREET. IT WOULD BE A
HUGE HELP IF ANYWHERE IN THE ZILLION PAGES OF THAT APPLICATION THAT
IT NOTED IN THE 1 FIRST CONDO FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE IT IS. WITH
RESPECT TO THE ORDER REGARDING TREE CANOPY AT THE TOBIN, I WAS
SURPRISED TO READ IT SINCE I HAD THOUGHT BASED ON TREE REMOVE
HEARINGS I HAVE BEEN TO THAT THE CITY POLICY WAS TO REPLACE CANOPY
INSTEAD OF DIAMETER. IF IT IS NOT, IF I HAVE THE WRONG IMPRESSION, IT
ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE AND I'M GLAD TO SEE IT IS A REQUEST. NO, WE
SHOULDN'T BE CUTTING DOWN TREES, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CUT DOWN.
WITH RESPECT TO CHARTER CHANGE, I SUGGEST THAT YOU DELETE THE
EXTRA BY A SPECIAL ACT IN LINE ONE OF SECTION THREE, AND I WAS STRUCK
BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE REQUEST HERE TO APPROVE THE MEMBERS
OF BOARD AND COMMISSIONS AND THE SOLICITOR'S LEGAL OPINION ON THE
ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE CITY MANAGER TO DO PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING,


PAGE 5

Jun 21, 2021

INCLUDING DECIDING WHETHER TO RENAME A LIBRARY.
I DON'T EXPECT THAT PASSING THIS WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE WHO IS ON THE
BOARDS AND COMMISSION, BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT IT CHANGES THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THE MANAGER. ONE THING
THAT STRUCK ME IN THE SOLICITOR'S OPINION WAS THE APPEAL TO
EFFICIENCY IN CITY GOVERNANCE. I DO BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY IS NOT
EFFICIENT. IT HAS OTHER THINGS TO RECOMMEND IT. I PERSONALLY PREFER
THAT TO EFFICIENCY. AUTHORITARIANISM IS EXTREMELY EFFICIENT. WITH
RESPECT TO THE REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE, I WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND THIS
MEETING AND I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED BY WHAT SEEM TO ME TO BE AN
ABUNDANCE OF MISINFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE COUNCIL
ABOUT HOW THINGS HAPPEN AT THE REGISTRY OF DEEDS AND WHY PEOPLE
CHOOSE PARTICULAR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES. I HAVE BEEN ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT, HEATHER.
YOUR TIME IS UP. NEXT UP, FOR THE REMAINDER, FEEL FREE TO EMAIL US.
NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> THANK YOU. JACKSON PLACE, JEFFERSON PARK, NORTH CAMBRIDGE. ON
CHARTER REFORM, I LISTEN TO A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION FROM THE JUNE
2ND MEETING. AND THERE WAS TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET THE PUBLIC
INVOLVED. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE OBSERVATION, HAVING THE
MEETING AT 11:00 ON A WEEKDAY IS NOT A GREAT WAY TO GET A LOT OF
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. POTENTIALLY, I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY ESSENTIALLY
IMPORTANT EFFORT AND INITIATIVE. I THINK EVERYBODY IN CAMBRIDGE
WHO CARES ABOUT GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNMENT IN
CAMBRIDGE, SHOULD READ AT LEAST THE SECOND MEMORANDUM FROM
THE COLLINS CENTER. I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT AND THE WAY IT LAID
OUT OPTIONS. I WILL MAKE ONE OBSERVATION ABOUT THAT HEARING. MR.
WARD SAID SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING. HE SAID, AT ANOTHER
MUNICIPALITY, THEY WERE HAVING MEETINGS WITH MAYBE 20-30 PEOPLE
AND WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THE TOPIC WAS SHIFTING, WAS GOING TO
SHIFT FROM CITY MANAGER FORM OF GOVERNMENT TO A MAYOR, 150
PEOPLE SHOWED UP. AND I THINK IN THAT STORY IS THE ANSWER, PART OF
AN ANSWER OF HOW TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED. IF THE REFORM IS REALLY
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL AND SIGNIFICANT, ADDRESS
THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT PEOPLE HAD IN THIS CITY FOR DECADES ABOUT THE
LACK OF POWER FOR THE CITIZENRY AND THE COUNCIL... (LOST AUDIO)...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES? WE PAUSED YOU. YOU CUT OFF. CAN YOU
HEAR US?
>> HE IS NOT IN THE ZOOM ANYMORE. MAYBE HE LOST HIS CONNECTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. ANYONE ELSE IN THE ZOOM RIGHT NOW? WHO
SIGNED UP?
>> THERE ARE NO MORE SPEAKERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: M NOBODY IN THE AUDIENCE. WE HAVE A FEW
MINUTES LEFT. PUBLIC COMMENT WILL REMAIN OPEN AND CAN I LEAVE IT


PAGE 6

Jun 21, 2021

OPEN AND SEE IF HE COMES BACK. HE IS BACK?
>> JAMES, UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HELLO. THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE -- TECHNOLOGY AND
HAVING NOT HIGH-SPEED INTERNET. YOU GET DISCONNECTED. I HOPE YOU
RESTORE THE TIME THAT WAS LOST. A LITTLE LESS THAN A MINUTE. IF YOU
MAKE IT IMPORTANT, PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE. AND I THINK YOU ARE
HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I LIKE IT AND THE LIKE THE FACT YOU
WILL START A REVIEW BY NEXT YEAR IF THIS PASSES. ON TREE PROTECTION,
WHICH IS I THINK STILL ON THE AGENDA AS... LEFT OVER FROM THE
PREVIOUS MEETING. TEE PROTECTION IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY IN THE
CITY DESERVES. IF YOU TALK ABOUT EQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION AND
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND RACIAL JUSTICE, EVERYBODY IN THE CITY HAS TO HAVE
THE SAME PROTECTION IN THE TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCE. EVERY SINGLE
HUMAN BEING IN THE CITY. AND FINALLY, ON THE REAL ESTATE TRANSFER
TAX, I HOPE YOU WILL RESTORE SOME OF THE TIME THAT WAS LOST AS NO
FAULT OF MY OWN. THE REAL ESTATE TRANSFER TAX, I THINK BE
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT GIVING MONEY TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST
WHEN MR. COTTER WILL NOT ANSWER EMAILS ASKING FOR AN EXPLANATION
OF WHAT IS THE PROJECT REVIEW COMMITTEE, HOW IT IS CONSTITUTED,
HOW THEY MAKE THEIR DELIBERATIONS TO DISTRIBUTE ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE PAUSED YOU AND SO YOU HAD REMAINING TIME. I
APOLOGIZE. YOUR TIME IS UP. THAT DOES CONCLUDE PUBLIC COMMENT.
WE'LL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT REMAIN OPEN FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES.
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAS JOINED US AND WILL BE RECORDED AS
PRESENT. WE HAVE SUBMISSION OF THE RECORD FOR THE REGULAR CITY
COUNCIL MEETING HOLD ON APRIL 26, 2021. MOTION BY VICE-MAYOR
MALLON TO SEPT MINUTES, ROLL CALL.

AGAINST.

COUNCIL? I SEE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
VICE-MAYOR MALLON, COUNCILLOR CARLONE. GO AHEAD, COUNCILLOR

Manager, relative to an update
on COVID-19 vaccination
rollout.

COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN ASKED, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT RECENT ACTIONS BY
THE GOVERNOR AND HOW THEY IMPACT CAMBRIDGE. LAST WEEK A BILL
WAS SIGNED THAT EXTENDED COVID PROVISIONS. I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED
SOME OF THE ONES WE BELIEVE MOST IMPACTFUL ON CAMBRIDGE. I
WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASK THE CITY SOLICITOR TO EMAIL ANY COUNCILLOR
WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LIST AFTER THE MEETING. THE BILL SIGNED LAST
WEEK WILL ALLOW FOR RESTAURANTS LICENSE TO CELL ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGES OR PREMISE CONSUMPTION THROUGH MAY 1, 2022. AND
EXTENDS THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH LANDLORD SERVING A NOTICE TO QUIT
HAVE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO A TENANT TO BE TRUE TO
TERMINATION -- WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED TO

TENANTS.
EXTEND THE TIME IN WHICH COURT CAN GRANT A CONTINUATION AND A
SUMMARY PROCESS CASE FOR NONPAYMENT DUE TO FINANCIAL HARDSHIP
THROUGH APRIL 1, 22. EXTENDS ABILITY TO APPROVE AND EXPANSION OF
PERMISSIONS FOR OUTDOOR DINING THROUGH APRIL 1, 2022. WITHOUT
HAVING TO GO A FULL LICENSING PROCESS AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND
CAN BE NEW REQUEST FOR EXPANSION OF PREMISES. OR AN EXTENSION OF
AN EARLIER GRANTED APPROVAL UNDER THE -- IT ALSO SUSPENDS THE
REQUIREMENT FOR THE OPEN MEETING LAW AND A MEETING BEING
CONDUCTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACE THAT IS OPEN PHYSICALLY ACCESSIBLE IF
THERE IS ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESS AND SUSPENDS THE
REQUIREMENT THAT THE QUORUM OF THE PUBLIC BODY SHALL BE PRESENT.
THIS SECTION MIRRORS THE LANGUAGE IN THE ORDER CONCERNING OPEN
MEETING LAW. IT RATIFIES REMOTE MEETINGS HELD BEFORE THE ACT IS
SIGNED. IN FOLLOW THROUGH APRIL 1, 2022. SOME HAVE RAISED
CONCERNS ABOUT MASKS NOT BEING REQUIRED IN THE LIBRARY. THIS IS
CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY FOR CHILDREN UNDER 12 WHO CANNOT BE
VACCINATED AND OTHERS WHO MAY BE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED. ARE
THERE PLANS TO IMPLEMENTED LIMITED MASK POLICIES OR BROWSING TIME
TO IMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS AT THE MAIN LIBRARY AND THE
CPL BRANCHES? AS WE DID THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND WILL
CONTINUE TO DO MOVING FORWARD, WE'LL PUT IN PLACE GUIDANCE,
POLICIES OR RECOMMENDATIONS AS NEEDED BASED ON THE STATE DATA IN
CAMBRIDGE AND RESEARCH RELATED TO CORONAVIRUS. I HAVE BEEN IN THE
DISCUSSION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF LIBRARIES AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH
OFFICERS REGARDING THIS TOPIC. WE DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED
MASK POLICIES. UNTIL THEN, THE LIBRARY LIKE OTHER DEPARTMENTS WILL
STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT UNVACCINATED PEOPLE OF ANY AGE WEAR
MASKS INSIDE OF THE CITY BUILDINGS. FREE MASKS ARE AVAILABLE AT ALL
LIBRARIES AND THE LIBRARY WILL SUPPLY A YOUTH-SIZE MASK.
MASKS ARE BEING OFFERED TO PATRONS AT THE START OF IN-PERSON
PROGRAMMING. ANY PATRON WHO HAS CONCERNS ABOUT ENTERING THE
BUILDING DUE TO MEDICAL REASON OR DISABILITY, SUCH AS
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED, SHOULD CONTRACT THE ADMINISTRATION. YOU
CAN DISCUSS POSSIBLE ACCOMMODATIONS AND CLAUDE WILL DISCUSS THIS
QUESTION IN MORE DEPTH DURING THE REMARKS AS WELL. AND THIS
INCLUDES MY RESPONSE TO THE COUNCIL QUESTIONS AND I WILL TURN IT
OVER TO CLAUDE TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING QUESTIONS. CLAUDE?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CITY
MANAGER AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL TO PROVIDE THIS WEEK'S COVID
REPORT. HOLDING ON TO THE SLIDE, AS THE CASES CONTINUE TO FALL AND
VACCINATION RATES CONTINUE TO RISE, I WANT TO EXPRESS HOW PROUD I
AM TO THE RESPONSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THE BEST OF THE CITY CAME
TOGETHER AND WORKED TIRELESSLY AND SELFLESSLY AND THE EFFORTS ARE
PAYING EFFORT. BEFORE I BEGIN MY FINAL REPORT TO THE COUNCIL, I DO
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW ACTIVITIES THAT ARE --

THEY WERE UNDERTAKEN TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IN THE
CITY IN THE PAST YEAR. IN CASE YOU WONDER, THE DECLARED EMERGENCY
LASTED ABOUT 450 DAYS. THERE ARE MILESTONES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE
ILLUSTRATION AND RESOLVE OF THE COMMUNITY. CAMBRIDGE IS THE FIRST
CITY IN THE STATE TO PROVIDE ON-SITE -- WE BEGAN TO TEST IN ELDERLY
HOUSING IN MAY OF LAST YEAR AND WE TESTED OVER 700 RESIDENTS. AND
WE LAUNCHED I MOBILE TESTING PROGRAM IN THE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE WE SAW HIGHER RATES OF COVID-19 INFECTION FOR BLACK, ET
CETERA, AND WE SUBSEQUENTLY STOOD UP FOUR OTHER SITES OPERATING
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK UNDER THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE.
THIS GROUP HELP TO LAUNCH THE DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING SITE ON
NOVEMBER 1 OF LAST FALL.
WE OFFERED VOLUNTARY TESTING TO ALL RESIDENTS EXPERIENCING
HOMELESSNESS AND SHELTERS AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF PARTNERS,
PROVIDED FIRST AND SECOND DOSES TO THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY.
OVER 400 INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF MODERNA OR THE
SINGLE DOSE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. SINCE LAST FALL, THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY CORPS MEMBERS, C3, HAVE BEEN GOING DOOR-TO DOOR,
CONDUCTING OUTREACH IN THE HARD TO REACH NEIGHBORHOODS AND
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET TESTED. C3 MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED
TO THE LOW-INCOME SENIOR BUILDINGS TO PRE-REGISTER RESIDENTS FOR
THE VACCINE AND TO LOW-INCOME BUILDINGS IN NEIGHBORHOODS
HARDEST HIT, WHICH WE REPORTED OUT, FOR EXAMPLE 362, 364, ET
CETERA.
LAST APRIL OF 2020, THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND WE BROUGHT IN
RECRUITS FROM OUR NURSING CORPS, OUTSIDE STAFF, AND WE
AUGMENTED THE STATE'S COMMUNITY CHOICING COLLABORATIVE, THE CTC,
TO ASSIST WITH CONTACT TRACING AND CASE INVESTIGATIONS. JUST KNOW,
OUR STELLAR HEALTH NURSES AND THE STAFF REACHED OUT TO EVERY
INFECTED RESIDENT AND PROVIDING THEM WITH SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE
IN HOW TO ISOLATE AND TRY TO IDENTIFY AND CONNECT WITH EVERYBODY,
THE PERSON WAS IN CONTACT WITH WHILE INFECTIOUS.
THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES AND THEY SPEAK TO THE AGILITY,
COMPASSION, AND COMMITMENT OF CITY PARTNERS. THE LOGISTICAL
CHALLENGES ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO LIST AND I APPLAUD THE TENACITY OF
THE STAFF AND ANCHORED TO THE STEADY AND STRONG GUIDANCE
PROVIDED BY THE CITY MANAGER AND DR. ASSAAD SAYAH DR. ASSAAD
SAYAH. GO TO THE FIRST SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, FOR THE WEEK ENDING JUNE 19, TWO NEW CONFIRMED CASES, AS YOU
HAVE HEARD, TRANSLATES TO 2/10 -- THIS IS BY FAR THE CITY'S LOWEST
WEEKLY CASE TOTAL SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. AND CAMBRIDGE
CONTINUES AND HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF TESTING IN THE
COMMONWEALTH WITH VERY FEW TESTS COMING BACK POSITIVE. YOU
HAVE HEARD -- CAN YOU MOVE THE SLIDE.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE. AS WE HEARD, THE CURRENT POSITIVITY RATE IS
0.11%. AND THIS CONTINUES TO BE GREAT NEWS AND WE SHOULD BE SO

PAGE 11

Jun 21, 2021

PROUD OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WITH REGARD TO VARIANTS, AS OF
JUNE 18, 52 TOTAL VARIANTS REPORTED AMONG CAMBRIDGE, INCLUDING 41
CASES OF THE ALPHA. 3 CASES OF BETA. AND SEVEN CASES OF THE GAMMA.
AND WE HAVE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED.
WE PUSH THAT MESSAGE OUT AND THE VACCINATION RATES COMPARED TO
OTHERS IS STRONG AND WE WANT TO KEEP THEM STRONG.
AND GO TO TESTING. NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS A CONSISTENTLY WE HAVE SEEN
VOLUMES TO DECLINE. THIS SAY DOWNWARD TREND AS EXPECTED, WHICH
IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS MORE TEENS AND ADULTS ARE VACCINATED
AND THE INFECTION RATES ARE LOW. COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER
ASKED, WHAT ARE THE PLANS FOR THE CITY'S FREE TESTING PROGRAM FOR
THE SUMMER AND THE SECOND QUESTION, CAN THE CHANGES TO THE
LOCATION AND OTHER LOCATIONS BE CLARIFIED?
YOU HEARD FROM THE CITY MANAGER, THE THREE SITES ARE PROVIDING
FREE TESTING FOR RESIDENTS FOUR DAYS A WEEK WITH MODIFIED HOURS
UNTIL JUNE 30. JULY 1, WE'LL HAVE ONE TESTING SITE AT THE MALL, IT WILL
BE A WALK-IN SITE AND NO MORE DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING. THE
COMPLEMENT TO THAT STATIC SITE IS OUR MOBILE TEAMS, WHICH REMAIN
AT THE READY AND PROVIDE VACCINATION CLINICS ACROSS THE CITY. I WILL
THANK CAMBRIDGE FIRE, PRO-EMS AND THE NURSING STAFF TO HELP
CONDUCT THE CLINICS.
THE TESTING SITES AT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE MALL IS FROM 11-3 EVERY
THURSDAY DURING JULY. AS WE REPORT, LAST WEEK IS THE FINAL WEEK OF
COVID SURVEILLANCE TESTING FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS. SINCE IT BEGAN
LAST OCTOBER 15, AND FOR OTHER STUDENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT ON
BOARD AS OF MARCH 1, CPH -- SCHOOL NURSES, ADMINISTERED OVER 40,000
TESTS TO STAFF AND STUDENTS. AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE THE POOL
TESTING. IF YOU INCLUDE IT, JUST KNOW OUR SCHOOL NURSES CONDUCTED
OVER 3,400 POOL TESTS.
POOL TESTING WILL CONTINUE FOR SUMMER PROGRAMS AT 11 SCHOOL
SITES AND THREE OR FOUR YOUTH CENTERS WILL PARTICIPATE. THIS WILL
COMPRISE OF FOURTH HEALTH AIDES AND ONE NURSE AND A TESTING TEAM
WHICH WILL BEGIN ON JULY 6, AFTER THE HOLIDAY, AND CONTINUE
THROUGH AUGUST 20. NEXT SLIDE.
SO AGAIN, OVER 4,300 INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF
MODERNA OR SINGLE SHOT OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON THAT IS ACCOUNTING
FOR OVER 6,700 DOSES AT THE CITY-RUN CLINICS. AS YOU HEARD, TO DATE
WE HAVE 64% OF RESIDENTS FULLY VACCINATED AND 71% OF RESIDENTS
THAT RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE.
WE DID HOLD A CLINIC AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AT -- THERE ARE AND ONE
SECOND DOSE OF PFIZER VACCINE THAT WERE ADMINISTERED. AND LAST
WEEK, ON JUNE 16, 150 SECOND DOSES ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCATION.
AND JUST KNOW, OUR TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE MOBILE
VACCINATION CLINICS AND OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, BETWEEN JUNE 4
AND THE 14, YOU HAVE MOBILE CLINICS IN HARVARD SQUARE, RIVERBEND


PAGE 12

Jun 21, 2021

PARK, ALEWIFE, MICRO-CENTER PARKING LOT, AND THE MBK AND
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER EFFECT THAT WAS HELD AT CCC. 45 FIRST
AND SECOND DOSES OF MODERNA AND ONE SHOT OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON
WAS ADMINISTERED. WE SEE A DECLINE IN FOLKS THAT ARE SHOWING UP
FOR THE CLINICS, BUT WE REMAIN AT THE READY AND THE MOBILE TEAM IS
OUT AND ABOUT TO GET THE DESIGNATED GROUPS.
WITH REGARD ONGOING VACCINE UPDATES, THEY HAVE WILL THE CLINIC FOR
MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND THE PARENTS. THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ANYONE WHO CAN MAKE ARE INVITED TO
ATTEND. JULY 14, WE'LL HAVE DOSE ONE AND AUGUST FOUR, ADMINISTER
DOSE TWO.
AND EMAIL BLAST WENT OUT EARLIER TODAY AND THE LINK FOR THE
REGISTRATION AND WE WORK HARD TO ENCOURAGE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS TO
BE VACCINATED. BUT THEY ARE OPEN TO ANYBODY IN CAMBRIDGE WHO IS
ELIGIBLE. COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS. THIS ONE, WHAT
ARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES, CURRENT AND UNDER INVESTIGATION
RELATED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF REQUIRING VACCINATION FOR CERTAIN
ACTIVITIES ONCE THE VACCINES ARE BEYOND EMERGENCY APPROVAL AND
AGE ELIGIBILITY IS EXPANDS.
KEEP IN MIND, THE AUTHORITY OF STATES AND LOCALITIES TO MANDATE
VACCINE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IS WELL ESTABLISHED. IN PRACTICE,
THE STATE VACCINATION MANDATES HAVE GENERALLY BEEN LIMITED TO THE
LAW REQUIRING CHILDREN TO RECEIVE SPECIFIED VACCINE AS A CONDITION
OF SCHOOL ENTRY. WITH ADULTS, SOME STATES MANDATE HEALTHCARE
WORKERS BEING VACCINATED AGAINST DISEASE, THE VACCINATION
REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. STATES DO NOT USE
MANDATES FOR ADULT VACCINATION AND HAVE THUS FAR SAID THEY ARE
NOT MANDATING COVID-19 VACCINATION.
AGAIN, DR. DOBBERTEEN, THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS HERE WITH ME AND
DURING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD, SHE CAN ELABORATE. IF IN
THE FUTURE MASSACHUSETTS DOES REQUIRE A COVID-19 VACCINATION AS A
CONDITION FOR SCHOOL ENTRY OR OTHER ACTIVITIES, CAMBRIDGE WOULD
COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE. OF COURSE, WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY
ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE RESIDENTS TO GET VACCINATED BECAUSE IT IS THE
BEST WAY TO PREVENT DISEASE AND DEATH.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO, WE PROVIDE THE NEXT TWO SLIDES TO CONTINUE
TO SHARE NOW CAMBRIDGE COMPARES TO THE COMMONWEALTH.
CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO OUTPACE THE STATE FOR PERCENTAGE OF
BLACK, LATINX, HISPANIC, AND WHITE RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVED AT LEAST
ONE DOSE. CAMBRIDGE SIGNIFICANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY OUTPACE THE
STATE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS WHO ARE VACCINATED. AN
INDICATION THAT THE OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION EFFORTS IS
SUCCESSFUL. THIS SLIDE DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC
CATEGORIES PROVIDED IN THE STATE'S VACCINE DATA. WE HAVE CAPTURED
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE, WITH REGARDS TO THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE
COMMONWEALTH, WE HAVE SEEN BETWEEN 5-8% OF THE POPULATION

PAGE 13

Jun 21, 2021

THAT HAVE SELF-REPORTED AS EITHER OTHER OR UNKNOWN.
NEXT SLIDE. SO, WITH REGARD TO AGE AND GENDER. CAMBRIDGE
CONTINUES TO OUTPACE THE STATE IN ALL, BUT ONE CATEGORY. THEY
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE. WHEN LOOKING AT VACCINATION RATES
AMONG ELIGIBLE CHILDREN, WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE PROPORTION OF
YOUNGER CAMBRIDGE TEENS, AGES 12-15, WHO ARE VACCINATED EXCEEDS
THAT OF THE PEERS STATEWIDE. AND THE RATE OF VACCINATED
16-19-YEAR-OLDS LAGS THAT OF OLDER TEENS STATEWIDE. WE'LL CONTINUE
OUR OUTREACH TO GET THE NUMBERS UP, INCLUDING HOLDING A SUMMER
VACCINATION CLINIC, WHICH I MENTIONED AT THE KING OPEN SCHOOL.
AGAIN, DURING THE Q&A, DR. DOBBERTEEN CAN ELABORATE ABOUT THE
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TO FOCUS ON THIS AGE GROUP. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, WITH REGARD TO ONGOING GUIDANCE. THESE ARE JUST REMINDERS
THAT THE STATEWIDE EMERGENCY WAS LIFTED LAST WEEK AS OF JUNE 15.
YOU HEARD FROM THE CITY MANAGER, BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS
CAN SET THEIR REQUIREMENTS FOR MASKING AND VACCINATIONS. STRICT
RULES ON MASK WEARING OR OTHER MEASURES MAY BE CONSIDERED,
DEPENDING ON FACTORS SUCH AS INDOOR AIR EXCHANGE, RISK TO
UNVACCINATED OR IMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS, OR THE
INFECTION RATES IN THE COMMUNITY. MASK WEARING GUIDANCE AND
SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDANCE WERE AVAILABLE ON THE CITY AND THE CDC
WEBSITE, WHICH WE SEND OUT EACH EVENING.
MAYOR SIDDIQUI ASKED A QUESTION, REGARDING THE REOPENING OF THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCHES, SOME RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT
MASKS NOT BEING REQUIRED. THIS IS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY FOR
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 WHO CAN'T BE VACCINATED AND OTHERS
WHO MAY BE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED. ARE THERE PLANS TO LIMIT MASK
POLICIES OR SPECIAL BROWSING TIMES FOR INDIVIDUALS AT THE MAIN
LIBRARY OR CPL BRANCHES. AS YOU HEARD, WE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER
AND DISCUSSING WITH THE STAFF AND THE LEADERSHIP AT THE LIBRARY.
THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECOMMENDS THAT THE
CONTINUED USE OF WELL-FITTING FACE MASKS FOR CHILDREN TWO AND
OLD AND NOT VACCINATED. THE USE OF THE MASK SHOULD CONTINUE
UNTIL CHILDREN OR ADOLESCENTS IS FULLY VACCINATED, WHICH IS TWO
WEEKS AFTER THE FINAL DOSE IS ADMINISTERED. YOU HAVE HEARD WE
ENCOURAGE THE USE OF FACE MASKS BY CHILDREN UNDER 12 YEARS OF AGE
AND BY ANYONE WHO IS NOT YET VACCINATED. THOSE WHO ARE
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED, WHEN INDOORS AND WHEN SOCIAL DISTANCING
CANNOT, BE MAINTAINED. THIS IS THE OPTION OF WEARING A MASK BASED
ON THE POTENTIAL RISK OF EXPOSURE AND HEALTH CONDITIONS AND
OVERALL HEALTH CONCERNS.
JUST A REMINDER I WILL SHARE ABOUT THE WORK BEHIND THE SCENES THAT
WILL CONTINUE AS WE ASSESS COVID INFECTION RATES AND DEATHS IN THE
CITY. WE ARE APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST 16 MONTHS, THE
DEPARTMENT USED A VARIETY OF TOOLS ON THE SLIDE. WE USE STATE AND
LOCAL CASE DATA TO MONITOR RATES AND LOCALIZE OUTBREAKS. LOOK AT


PAGE 14

Jun 21, 2021

THE OVERALL POPULATION AND DIG DEEPER AND LOOK AT HOW COVID-19
HAS IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS BY AGE, RACE, ETHNICITY, AND NEIGHBORHOOD.
IN ADDITION, OUR STAFF HAVE USED THE DATA TO CREATE INNOVATE TOOLS,
THAT HAVE HELPED TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF HIGHEST NEED. THIS
ACKNOWLEDGE HELP GUIDE THE OUTREACH EFFORTS AS WELL AS LOCATION
FOR VACCINATION SITES IN HARDER-HIT NEIGHBORHOODS. AND CAMBRIDGE
IS ONE OF THE FEW COMMUNITIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH THAT
CONTRACT WITH BIO-BOT TO GET MUNICIPAL LEVEL WASTE WATER DATA
WHICH IS YIELD DECLINING OR RISING RATES IN THE CITY. EFFORTS SHIFTED,
WE HAVE TRACKING VACCINATION RATES AMONG CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS BY
AGE, RACE, ETHNICITY, AND GENDER, AND USING THE INFORMATION TO PLAN
ONGOING TARGETED OUTREACH EFFORTS. WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING
VARIANT CASES IN CAMBRIDGE AND ESTIMATES IN THE COMMONWEALTH.
NEXT SLIDE.
WITH REGARD TO COMMUNICATION, WE CONDUCT DATA-DRIVEN TARGETED
OUTREACH USING ZIP CODE DATA TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH LOWER
VACCINATION RATES AS WELL AS AGE DEMOGRAPHICS WITH LOWER VACCINE
UPTAKE. WE CONTINUE THE MESSAGE WITH MASK AND GUIDANCE FOR
UNVACCINATED, THOSE YOUNGER THAN 12 AND THOSE
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE JUNE 15 DECLARED
EMERGENCY IS LIFTED. AND AS OF NOW, WE HAVE PUT OUR CLINICIAN
SPEAKER BUREAU ON HIATUS, BUT WILL RESPOND IF AND WHEN NEEDED.
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND I THANK
YOU FOR HELPING TO MANAGE THAT PROCESS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE AND THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE. AND AS A WAY TO
INCENTIVIZE THOSE AGES 12-17 YEARS OLD TO GET VACCINATED, YOU MAY
HAVE HEARD THE ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM THE GOVERNOR BAKER, THE
GIVE-AWAY AND OFFER PRIZES FOR THOSE 18 AND OLDER AND 5300000
SCHOLARSHIP GRANT TO A COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN. LAST SLIDE.
THIS IS REALLY IN THANKS IN CLOSING. I WILL THANK ALL OF THE PARTNERS
WHO CAME TOGETHER IN THE PAST 16 MONTHS TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY
SAVE AND RESILIENT. WE SAY THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. KEEP IN
MIND, WE HAD CITY EMPLOYEES, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, NONPROFIT,
UNIVERSITIES, COMMUNITY GROUPS, FAITH-BASED, ET CETERA, TO HELP
ILLUSTRATE WHERE CAMBRIDGE TAKES A VILLAGE -- WE HAVE TARGETED
THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN
NEIGHBORHOODS HARDEST HIT. WE ADMINISTER VACCINES VIA THE MOBILE
TEAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN CAMBRIDGE SENIOR HOUSING,
INDIVIDUALS WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS, FOCUS ON STUDENTS AGE
12-17 AND MORE ISOLATED PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE CLINICS HAVE
BEEN OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC REGARDLESS OF IDENTIFICATION OR
HEALTH INSURANCE STATUS AND LAUNCHED WHEN WE HAD VACCINES IN
HAND AND CONTINUE TO BE IN OPERATION. WITH OUR PARTNERS, WE HELP
RESIDENTS LOCATE AND ACCESS FOOD RESOURCES, DISTRIBUTE FACE
COVERINGS AND SUPPORTING REQUEST FROM SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS
WITH DISABILITY. AND THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP, WE ESTABLISHED TWO
EMERGENCY TEMPORARY SHELTERS AND YOU REMEMBER AT THE WAR


PAGE 15

Jun 21, 2021

MEMORIAL AND NOW THE TRANSITION WELLNESS CENTER FOR THOSE
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT CAMBRIDGE IS A
MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF THE ROBUST PARTNERSHIP.
SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR THE PLAYER COACH. HE IS
ENGAGED, NOT JUST FROM THE SIDELINE. IT IS AN HONOR TO PROVIDE THIS
JOINT REPORT EACH WEEK AND ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS POSED BY THE
COUNCIL. THERE'S BEEN ANNOUNCED INTERIM PUBLIC CHIEF OFFICER, I WILL
THANK HER TO COMING BACK AND TO LEAD THIS ON THE INTERIM BASIS.
THIS CONCLUDES MY REPORT AND DR. DOBBERTEEN AND I HERE TO RESPOND
TO MY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL START FOR QUESTIONS WITH THOSE WHO ARE
HERE TONIGHT. ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR THOSE IN THE CHAMBER
AND THEN I WILL START WITH THOSE ON THE ZOOM. VICE-MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I DOES SEND A QUESTION IN EARLIER
TODAY TO BOTH MR. JACOB AND THE CITY MANAGER, I DIDN'T GET THE
QUESTION IN ON THURSDAY BECAUSE THE DATA HAD NOT BEEN PUT OUT. I
KNOW YOU SPOKE TO THIS, THE LOWER VACCINATION RATES FOR THE 16
AND 19-YEAR-OLDS IN THE CITY. I'M CURIOUS WHAT WE'LL DO AROUND
GETTING THE WORD OUT AND VACCINATING THIS GROUP. I HAVE HEARD
ANECDOTALLY, I HAVE A CHILD IN THE AGE GROUP, THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER
OF YOUNG MEN IN THE AGE GROUP WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN GETTING
THE VACCINE AT CRLS. I'M CURIOUS IF THAT IS PLAYING OUT IN THE DATA OF
WHAT YOU SEE AND IF SO, WHAT IS THE DATA TELLING US ABOUT THE
GROUP? BY GENDER? BY ETHNICITY? AND HOW ARE WE REALLY WORKING
TO ADDRESS THIS. I THINK IT WILL BE AN ISSUE.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I'M ACCOMPANIED BY
DR. DOBBERTEEN, WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY.
THIS IS NOT A MANDATE. WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST WITH THE MOBILE TEAM
TO PROVIDE VACCINES IN THE CITY. WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL AND WHILE
THERE IS A LAG FOR THAT AGE GROUP, 16-19, WE APPLY EVERY BIT OF THE
CREATIVITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT
DEMOGRAPHIC. I'LL STOP THERE AND ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN TO ELABORATE
ABOUT OUR EFFORTS UNDERWAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE MICROPHONE BUTTON IS BELOW.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. I HAVE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF
THOUGHT SINCE THE DATA CAME OUT. I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE
COVID ITERATION OF THE TYPICAL UNVULNERABILITY OF TEAMS. THEY DON'T
THINK IT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. THEY DON'T THINK THEY NEED IT. THEY
HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT SO FAR. I HAVE SEEN IT ANECDOTALLY IN MY OFFICE AS
WELL AS IN THE DATA. I'M NOT SURE, WE'RE PARSING IT OUT, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY CLEAR THINGS THAT JUMP OUT IN TERMS OF EITHER
BACKGROUND OR SEX DIFFERENCE AMONG TEENS. I THINK FOR THOSE
OLDER KIDS, WE NEED TO DO MORE TARGETED OUTREACH, EXPLORE
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE MAYOR'S PROGRAM TO SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT
WITH THEM.


PAGE 16

Jun 21, 2021

MAYBE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO WITH SOME OF THE OTHER OUTREACH
PEOPLE IN THE CORPS AND PLACES THAT KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS, OLDER
TEENS, TEND TO GATHER OVER THE SUMMER. WE'RE GIVING IT SOME
THOUGHT, BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING, TEENS STRUGGLE WITH SEAT BELT
WEARING, TEENS STRUGGLE WITH TEXTING AND TEEN BEHAVIORS, AND NOT
GETTING VACCINATING IS A BEHAVIOR WE NEED TO ADDRESS HEAD-ON.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. LIKE I SAID, I HAVE ONE OF THESE
AGE GROUPS AT HOME AND I KNOW THAT IT BE A TRICKY ONE. IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR DATA IS 10% LESS THAN THE OVERALL STATE DATA FOR THE AGE GROUP.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING OUT TO THE MAYOR'S
SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM. I KNOW THERE'S A FINANCIAL LITERACY PIECE
TO THE MAYOR'S SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM AND IF IT CAN BE ADDED INTO
THE SUMMER LEARNING, IT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO GO, THINKING
ABOUT SPORTS TEAM, SOCIAL MEDIA. I HEAR ANECDOTALLY, IT IS I SPECIFIC
AGE GROUP AND GENDER. I WONDER AROUND THE SOCIAL MEDIA THEY SEE
AND CONSUME AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT PLAYS INTO THIS ABOVE AND
BEYOND THE RISK FACTOR YOU DESCRIBED, DR. DOBBERTEEN. I'M GLAD TO
HEAR YOU ARE WORKING ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, I THINK IT IS ALARMING
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND I -- YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER AGE
GROUPS, CAMBRIDGE IS WELL AND BEYOND. IT REALLY DOES STICK OUT AS
SOMETHING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. THAT IS MY ONLY QUESTION. SORRY
FOR NOT SUBMITTING IT EARLIER, BUT THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WANT TO ADD, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH
THE MBK GROUP ABOUT THE CAMP THEY WILL RUN, AND THIS IS ON THEIR
AGENDA TO WORK ON GETTING MORE CHILDREN GOING AND THEY WILL
WORK WITH US TO GET THE WORD OUT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND GOING TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND THEN COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION
AND VALIDATE HER INSIGHT. WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I WAS OPPOSED TO
WEARING A SEAT BELT. YOU KNOW WHAT FIXED IT? THE STATE REQUIRED IT.
IT IS THE LAW. YOU GOT TO DO IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE NOT
REQUIRING THE VACCINE FOR OUR ELIGIBLE YOUTH TO RETURN TO SCHOOL,
PAYMENT IN OUR SUMMER PROGRAMS. I UNDERSTAND IT IS UNDER
EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION. THE COURT CASES I SEE IN THE NEWS ARE
FINDING THAT IT IS NOT A LEGAL REASON NOT TO REQUIRE THE VACCINE.
WHAT IS OUR REASONING FOR NOT REQUIRING THE VACCINE AT THIS TIME?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: I WILL TAKE THAT. I THINK WE HAVE MADE A
QUALITATIVE DECISION THAT IT IS BEST FOR US TO WARMLY ENCOURAGE
OUR RESIDENTS, OUR STUDENTS, OR EDUCATORS, OUR PARENTS, TO GET
KIDS VACCINATED. WE HAVE ALSO MADE A QUALITATIVE DECISION NOT TO
MANDATE IT. I'M NOT AWARE OF DATA THAT SHOWS THAT A MANDATE
INCREASES -- EXCUSE ME. I'M NOT AWARE OF DATA THAT SHOWS A
MANDATE DECREASES VACCINE HESITANCY AND MY OWN CONCERN WOULD
BE THAT WE'D BE HEIGHTENING VACCINE HESITANCY BY MANDATING THE
VACCINE. AT THE MOMENT, WE ARE DOING AS MUCH OUTREACH AS WE

PAGE 17

Jun 21, 2021

CAN. WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND CONTINUE TO WARMLY
ENCOURAGE OUR RESIDENTS OF ALL AGES TO BE VACCINATED AS THE
VACCINE BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR THE YOUNGER AGES.
WE HAVE MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO THINK THROUGH THIS AND HAVE
IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CITY MANAGER ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, CAN YOU PLEASE MUTE. GO
AHEAD.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: TAKING INPUT FROM ALL TO NOT PUT IN A
MANDATE AT THIS TIME.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WANT TO ADD. WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
TALKING TO DR. ASSAAD SAYAH ON THIS. AS JUST A FOLLOW-UP.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: MY THANKS FOR THE ANSWERS. WE DO
REQUIRE A LOT OF OTHER VACCINES FOR OUR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN. I
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WE COULDN'T OR SHOULDN'T ADD THIS ONE. I
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS, BUT AT THIS POINT, SIX MONTHS INTO A
ROBUST NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAM. WE DON'T HAVE ANY REASON
TO NOT REQUIRE THE VACCINE. OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS EXPLAINED EARLIER,
THERE ARE EXCEPTION MECHANISMS THAT CAN BE ADDED AS THE CASE FOR
OTHER VACCINES. I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY STRONGLY CONSIDER
REQUIRING THE VACCINE, CERTAINLY BY THE FALL AS OUR KIDS RETURN TO
SCHOOL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I APOLOGIZE FOR THE NOISY BACKGROUND.
SOMETHING TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE
HARD-TO-REACH TEENAGER POPULATION. I DID HEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO
WORK WITH MBK THROUGH THE NYSEP PROGRAM. I THINK THE
PEER-TO-PEER IS ALMOST MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MANDATING. SOMETIMES
TEENAGERS ARE STILL YOUNG -- DEPENDING. THIS IS RALLYING AGAINST MY
SORT OF AUTHORITY. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING THROUGH MBK AND I WANT TO SEE HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE
AND CONTINUE THAT. IT IS -- SUMMER IS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. LOOK,
AT ALL OUR YOUTH RESEARCH, WHERE THEY MAY BE -- TO ENCOURAGE THAT
TYPE OF OUTREACH. AND THE LAST THING I WILL SAY, I KNOW YOU ARE
GOING TO HOST SOMETHING FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER, CLAUDE
JACOB, I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE THEIR. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND
WISH HIM WELL IN THE ENDEAVOR IN THE FUTURE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED THIS IN
THE PRESENTATION. IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN STUCK AT 71% FOR FIRST
DOSES FOR A WHILE. DO WE HAVE A SENSE AS TO WHY THAT IS? WHAT
WE'RE DOING -- I ASSUME WE'D HAVE -- WHEN I GOT MY VACCINATION, I
HAD TO GO IN REGISTER, GIVE MY INFORMATION. MY GUESS IS WE
PROBABLY HAVE SOME RECORD SOMEWHERE OF WHO GOTTEN IT AND WHO
HAS NOT. ARE WE REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T DONE THIS OR
DOING THIS BROAD BRUSH AND WHY ARE WE STUCK AT 71% FOR THE LAST


PAGE 18

Jun 21, 2021

WEEK.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL GIVE MY ANSWER AND I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE
WILL LIKE IT. IT IS REALITY AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CLAUDE. REALITY IS, I
THINK WE HAVE DONE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB MAKING THE VACCINE
AVAILABLE TO THE RESIDENTS WHO WANT TO TAKE IT. WE ARE KNOW
LOOKING AT A PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS WHO DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT.
TALK TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS, TALKED ABOUT PRO
AMBULANCE ABOUT THIS, TALK TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS,
THE CLINICS WE OFFER NOW, EVEN WITH ALL THE PUBLICITY, WORKING WITH
HEART AND WALKING AROUND MALLS AND ASKING PEOPLE, WE AVERAGE
ABOUT 1-2 VACCINES AT THE SITES. I THINK YOU WILL SEE AND IT IS STILL
WORTH DOING A 1% GROWTH AT A TIME AT MOST RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO GET THAT OTHER GROUP TO TAKE THE
VACCINES, BUT I THINK YOU ARE FACING A GROUP THAT HAS SIMPLY DECIDED
THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE A VACCINE. I THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO
WORK WITH THEM, BUT LIKE I SAID, IN TALKING TO POLICE, FIRE, PRO
AMBULANCE, HEALTH DEPARTMENT, I THINK IT IS NOT FROM LACK OF
AVAILABILITY, NOT FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE, IT IS JUST A
GROUP THAT IS NOT INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. I WISH WE COULD SAY THAT
WASN'T THE CASE AND I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO CLAUDE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S
WHAT WE ARE FACING NOW. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK AND WE'LL
CONTINUE TO OFFER THE VACCINES. I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING AT A 1%
GROWTH AT BEST MOVING FORWARD WEEKLY.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: JUST A COUPLE OF REGIONAL COMPARISON AND I WILL
ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN IN CASE SHE WOULD LIKE TO ADD. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE
ARE HOVER AT 71%, WE ARE 5% POINTS ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE.
THE 71% IS 63% IN BOSTON, IF YOU COMPARE US TO WORCESTER, 71% IS
56% IN WORCESTER. AND COMPARES TO SPRINGFIELD, 71% TO 46% IN
SPRINGFIELD. I SAY THAT TO SAY, FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE, WE HAVE DONE BETTER THAN LARGE CITIES IN
THE COMMONWEALTH. I PUT US UP AGAINST ANY OTHER CITY.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: IT IS NOT A CRITICISM. I KNOW WE ARE DOING
BETTER AND I SAY THAT EVERY WEEK AND TO EVERYBODY. I WAS JUST -- I
FIGURED THAT WAS THE ANSWER. I'M SURPRISED THERE ARE 29% OF PEOPLE
IN CAMBRIDGE THAT WOULDN'T WANT THE VACCINE. I WAS WONDERING IF
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE. NO MEANS A CRITICISM. I HAVE BEEN
CHAMPIONING THE WORK WE HAVE BEEN DOING TO EVERYBODY. AND YOU
MAY NOT HAVE THIS, I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU TO HAVE THIS PERCENTAGE
OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. I ASKED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, THAT 71% IS
71% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, NOT 71% OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION. IN
TERMS OF FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE, 12 AND UP, IT IS PROBABLY A HIGHER
PERCENTAGE THAN 71% THAT ARE VACCINATED. WE INCLUDE THE 11 AND
UNDER IN THAT PERCENTAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS FOR
KIDS IN THE AGE GROUP.
OF THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED, ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINATION, IS PROBABLY
HIGHER THAN THE 71%. IS THAT ACCURATE OR AM I... DOES THAT MAKE


PAGE 19

Jun 21, 2021

SENSE?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: I THINK SO. I HAVE TO DOUBLE-CHECK THAT. I
THINK IT IS 71% OF THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I THOUGHT WHAT I ASKED THE LAST TIME, I
COULD HAVE MISHEARD IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS 71% OF THE POPULATION,
WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN 71% OF THE ELIGIBLE. I COULD BE WRONG
ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: WE DON'T WANT TO COUNT THOSE WHO ARE NOT
YET ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE. THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD ADD THAT
FACTORS INTO OUR STATISTICS IS THAT THE STATE RECORDING SYSTEM, THE
MASS IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION SYSTEM, THERE'S A LAG-TIME AND
VACCINES THAT ARE GIVEN FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, FROM CVS,
WALGREENS, THE DIFFERENT SITES, THERE'S LAG TIME IN REPORTING INTO
THE SYSTEM. FOR THE OWN CHPD CITY-WIDE CLINICS, IF WE RUN A SECOND
DOSE CLINIC AND PEOPLE HAVE NOT SHOWN UP, WE CALL THEM. WE GET
THEM IN. WE WAIT. WE KEEP THE CLINIC OPEN FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES
UNTIL THEY COME IN. WE HAVE A VERY TINY HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE NOT COME BACK FOR THE SECOND DOSE AND USUALLY BECAUSE THEY
GOT THEIR SECOND DOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE. I THINK THAT 71% REFLECTS
SOME LAG IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. BUILDING ON WHAT COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS SAID ABOUT HAVING EQUAL TEENAGERS TALKING ABOUT GETTING
THE SHOT, I THINK IT IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY WHAT I HAVE FOUND
CURIOUS, WE STILL SEE ANTI-TOBACCO COMMERCIALS OF SADLY PEOPLE
ABOUT TO DIE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO NOT SMOKE AND YOU RARELY
SEE THAT ABOUT THE VACCINE.
AND COVID-19. I'M SURE THERE ARE COMMERCIALS SOMEWHERE ON THIS
AND I'M SURE THE STATE WOULD SPONSOR IT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL
THING TO PURSUE IN ANY WAY WE CAN. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, ALTHOUGH I
WILL BE BRIEFLY AT THE EVENT, I WANT TO THANK CLAUDE AND DR.
DOBBERTEEN AND THEIR STAFF FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE DONE. THE ONE
THING ABOUT CLAUDE THAT ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME, ALTHOUGH HE IS BUILT
TO TAKE ANYBODY DOWN, HE ALWAYS WAS A GENTLEMAN, ALWAYS IS A
GENTLEMAN IN ANY DISCUSSION AND ANY PROGRAM PROPOSAL. IT IS A
RARE COMBINATION TO BE IN ANY PUBLIC SERVICE -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE WONDERFUL THIS WAY -- BUT CLAUDE IS AT THE TOP OF
THE LIST AS FAR AS BEING A GENTLEMAN AND PRESENTING ISSUES AND
TAKING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IN A POSITIVE WAY.
I JUST HOPE THAT SAN ANTONIO REALIZES HOW LUCKY THEY ARE IN GETTING
YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR ALL SERVICE. IT IS A PLEASURE EVERY TIME I SEE
YOU. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I APOLOGIZE.
COUNCILLOR NOLAN?

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WILL BE QUICK. FIRST, I DO BELIEVE
TO ANSWER COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S QUESTION, THE STATE RECORDS
THAT WE HAD -- TOTAL BASIS OF 79,701 DOSES ARE BASED ON THE
POPULATION OF 111,998. YIELDING 91% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, AS
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SAID, LIKELY TO BE 76 OR 77% OF THE ELIGIBLE
POPULATION. MAYBE CLOSER TO 80%. THAT IS REAL KUDOS TO EVERYBODY.
AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS, AS DIRECTOR JACOB MENTIONED, THAT
LOTTERY HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT KIDS WILL BE ALL OVER. WHEN I TOLD
MY KIDS THEY WERE NOT SAD THEY -- THEY WERE SAD THEY WERE NOT IN
THE AGE GROUP. AND LET PARENTS KNOW, THEY WILL THEN TELL THE KIDS
ALSO. IT IS A HUGE BENEFIT, I THINK, TO TRY TO UP THAT VACCINATION
RATE. TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON'S AND OTHER POINTS ABOUT THE -- MAKE
SURE WE GET THE 16-19-YEAR-OLDS, $300,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY AND I'D
GUESS IF WE COMMUNICATE THAT, WE'LL SEE THE RATES NOT JUST MATCH
THE STATE BUT GO AHEAD. I HOPE THERE'S A PLAN IN PLACE TO DO THAT.
GET THAT WORD OUT THERE AND TALK ABOUT IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WAS THINKING LUNCH OR DINNER WITH THE MAYOR.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: 300,000 OR LUNCH WITH THE MAYOR. HMM?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE US. ONE
POINT I WANT TO BRING UP, IT IS AROUND THE LIBRARY AND POTENTIALLY
LOOKING AT MASK S. IF YOU CAN LET US KNOW AS SOON AS -- AS THE
THINKING EVOLVES, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I WILL GO TO YOU IN ONE
SECOND, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. FOR THE PUBLIC, WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO AFTER THE QUESTION, WE'LL SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING
FORWARD A RESOLUTION FOR MR. JACOB AND I WILL READ THAT
RESOLUTION AND THEN THE COUNCIL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOME
REMARKS AS WE WRAP UP AND THEN GO TO THE REST OF THE CITY
MANAGER'S AGENDA. I WANT TO TELL FOLKS THAT. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN? CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO CLARIFY AND GET A
FINAL ANSWER ON THE 71%. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS BASED ON
THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION, NOT THE TOTAL POPULATION. I JUST HEARD
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT, IT IS OF THE ELIGIBLE
POPULATION HERE OF THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED. WE
REPORT OUT EACH WEEK AND I GAVE A COMPARISON FOR OTHER CITIES.
THAT'S OUR INTERPRETATION. THAT'S WHAT WE REPORT OUT EACH WEEK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS
FROM THE BODY. I DON'T SEE ANY, WHAT WE'LL DO IS THE ITEM -- THE
RESOLUTION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE TABLE, BUT SOMETHING
HAPPENING. WE'LL BRING IT FORWARD AND SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING
IT FORWARD AS A LATE ITEM. CLEAR WILSON.

>> MR. CLERK: BRINGING FORWARD THE LATE RESOLUTION: (ROLL CALL).
NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: (READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
CONGRATULATIONS CLAUDE. ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THE RESOLUTION
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. ON BEHALF OF ME AND MY OFFICE, IT IS A PLEASURE
WORKING WITH YOU AND REALLY WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. AND I KNOW CITY
MANAGER, YOU HAVE A FEW WORDS TO SAY. I WILL GO TO YOU AND THEN
THE COUNCIL.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND
CLAUDE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE, I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH
PERSONALLY I WILL MISS CLAUDE. HE REALLY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE AND
VALUABLE MEMBER OF MY TEAM SINCE I WAS CITY MANAGER FOR THE LAST
FOUR AND HALF YEARS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN
INCREDIBLY STRONG FRIENDSHIP. BEFORE COVID AND DURING COVID, WE
GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT SOCCER, LITTLE LEAGUE, FAMILY OR
BUSINESS, AND SOMETHING THAT MEANS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT TO ME.
CLAUDE PERSONALLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD HAVE GOT THROUGH THE
LAST 14 MONTHS WITHOUT YOUR GUIDANCE, YOUR FRIENDSHIP, YOUR
LEADERSHIP, YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE CITY, NO MATTER WHEN I CALLED
OR WHAT THE SITUATION WAS, I KNOW I ASKED YOU SILLY QUESTIONS OVER
THE LAST 14 MONTHS, YOUR PATIENCE WITH ME, JUST KNOWING YOU IS AN
INCREDIBLE FACTOR. AND I WANT TO SAY, CLAUDE, THE CITY AND
EVERYBODY IN IT WILL OWE YOU A TREMENDOUS DEBT OF GRATITUDE AND
KEEPING US SAFE DURING THE PANDEMIC. YOU ARE DEPARTING KNOWING
YOUR LEADERSHIP PUT CAMBRIDGE IN A VERY SAFE POSITION AND A VERY
SAFE COMMUNITY. I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU AND WE SAID THIS
EARLIER, BUT THE FACT THAT 71% OF OUR RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED THE
FIRST DOSE, 64 HAVE RECEIVED A SECOND DOSE, WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO
YOU IS THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU TAKE THE BLACK, HISPANIC, AND LATINX
COMMUNITY, WE HAVE OUTPACED THE STATE ABOUT APPROXIMATELY 17%.
THAT IS NOT AN ACTION -- THAT IS THROUGH YOUR LEADERSHIP AND HARD
WORK. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST SEVEN DAYS, WE HAD FIVE DAYS WHERE
WE HAD ZERO POSITIVE CASES. AND I THINK IT IS ONLY FITTING IN YOUR LAST
WEEK WE CONTINUE THE ZERO TRENDS, AS I SAID, IT IS NOTING AN
ACCIDENT, IT IS THROUGH YOUR LEADERSHIP, YOUR GUIDANCE AND
WISDOM, WORKING WITH YOUR TEAM AND WORKING WITH DR. ASSAAD
SAYAH AND WE CAN SAY THERE'S NO CITY IN A BETTER PLACE THAN THE CITY
OF CAMBRIDGE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE HANDLED COVID. AND YOU
ARE THE LEADER OF THE SHIP. I SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE RESIDENTS,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT, MY FRIEND. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO THE ZOOM. STARTING WITH COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN AND THEN COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: CLAUDE, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE MONTREAL, MY
FRIEND. FROM OUR TRIP UP THERE, LOOKING AT SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES.
I THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK FOR THE CHIP, EVERYTHING

PAGE 22

Jun 21, 2021

THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE ORDER. REALLY FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT
WE HAVE HAD AROUND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND HOW TO MOVE THE
CITY FORWARD. I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES I TRIED TO MAYBE -- MAYBE I
DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLICATED SOME THINGS WERE THAT I
WANTED TO DO AND YOU WERE VERY GOOD AT PUTS THE BRAKES ON ME A
FEW TIMES, WHICH I DON'T THINK I ALWAYS APPRECIATED IN THE MOMENT,
BUT I DO.

Motion to Suspend the Rules
for a Late Resolution on
Claude Jacob

I THANK YOU FOR THAT, FOR GETTING NARCAN BOXES IN CITY BUILDINGS
AND TRAINING THROUGHOUT CITY EMPLOYEES, TO THE OPIOID TASK FORCE,
AND TO THE WORK -- THE MOVEMENT WE HAD AROUND SAFE
CONSUMPTION SITES FROM WHERE WE STARTED THAT CONVERSATION AND
WHERE IT PROGRESSED. I APPRECIATE THE OPEN-MINDEDNESS AND THE
WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.
I APPRECIATE DESPITE MY SAYING TO YOU IN MY LATE NIGHT EMAILS AND
THE EMAIL ON THE WEEKEND, DON'T RESPOND UNTIL THE NEXT WORK DAY,
YOU ALWAYS RESPONDED RIGHT AWAY OR AS SOON AS YOU COULD. AND IT
WAS A SIGN OF YOUR COMMITMENT. I KNOW THAT WE DEMAND A LOT OF
THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE CITY AND SOMETIMES THE
CONVERSATIONS GET INTENSE, I ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR
PROFESSIONALISM. COULD USE A BETTER INTERNET CONNECTION OUT
THERE IN WHERE YOU LIVE, BUT THAT'S OKAY. YOU ALWAYS HANDLED
YOURSELF PROFESSIONALLY WITH YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH EVERYBODY
AND THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO AND I APPRECIATE THAT ABOUT YOU. SAN
ANTONIO IS GETTING A GOOD GUY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE CITY AND GOOD LUCK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER AND
THEN COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE PAST YEAR AND HALF. IT HAS
BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING YEAR AND HALF TO BE A CITY
COUNCILLOR, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT SOMETHING LIKE TO BE THE
PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR OF THE CITY LIKE CAMBRIDGE. AND I HOPE YOU
ARE GETTING TIME OFF BEFORE YOU START THE NEW JOB. YOU HAVE
DEFINITELY EARNED IT AND STEPPING INTO BIGGER AND MORE CHALLENGING
AND I'M SURE REWARDING POSITION. THANK YOU AGAIN AND BEST OF LUCK
IN TEXAS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. AND VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO
YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF
AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN NAVIGATING AND GUIDING US THROUGH THIS
INCREDIBLE PERIOD IN ALL OF OUR LIVES OVER THE PAST YEAR AND HALF.
WITHOUT YOUR STEADY HAND AT THE HELM WITH THE STAFF AND CITY
STAFF SAID A LOT ABOUT HOW COMMITMENT TO OUR RESIDENTS AND
WHAT WE FORTUNATELY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO ALL OF THE RESIDENTS.

Jun 21, 2021

CLAUDE, A FRIEND FOR MANY YEARS, WE SERVED TOGETHER FOR A LONG
TIME, I HAVE ALWAYS APPRECIATED YOUR DELIBERATION, ESPECIALLY YOUR
PATIENCE IN RESPONDING TO ALL OUR COUNCIL QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS
OVER THE YEARS. IT TOOK -- AS COUNCILLOR CARLONE SAID, IT TAKE ACE
SPECIAL PERSON TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I'M SURE THERE ARE TIMES
WHERE YOU ARE EXHAUSTED SITTING WHERE YOU ARE NOW OVER THE PAST
YEAR AND HALF. THANK YOU FOR GETTING US THROUGH THE WORST OF THE
PANDEMIC AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN SAN ANTONIO. IT IS A GREAT
CITY. RIVERWALK IS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT AND I WISH -- WISH YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY GREAT HEALTH AND HAPPINESS THERE.
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU APPRECIATE YOUR FAMILY AND THE CITY THANKS
YOUR FAMILY FOR MANY -- THERE ARE 20-HOUR DAYS WHERE YOU WERE
AWAY FROM THE FAMILY. THANK YOU TO YOUR FAMILY FOR THEIR SHARING
YOU WITH ALL OF US. I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ALL THE BEST AS YOU
GO ON TO THE NEXT CHAPTER IN SERVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS OF
OUR COUNTRY AT THIS POINT. GOD SPEED. THANK YOU, CLAUDE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. AS THE MAYOR SAID, SO MUCH IS IN
THE RESOLUTION AND THEN SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN. I WILL BE
BRIEF AND THANK YOU. IT HAS BEEN REALLY A JOY TO GET TO KNOW YOU
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. PLAIN ENGLISH SO EVERYBODY CAN
UNDERSTAND... I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST
ACKNOWLEDGE, IF IT WASN'T SO HARD, EVERYBODY WOULD DO IT. YOU
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW JUST HOW HARD THIS JOB -ANY JOB WHERE YOU ARE PUBLIC FACING IS VERY DIFFICULT AND WHAT YOU
GIVE UP TO DO THAT. IN ACKNOWLEDGING YOU AND I WANT TO PAUSE AND
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FAMILY. I THANK THEM FOR SHARING YOU WITH US.
THEY MADE THAT SAME SACRIFICE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CONFERRED WITH
THEM AND SAY SHOULD I TAKE THIS JOB OR HOW IT FELL OUT, YOU TOOK THE
JOB, YOUR WIFE AND KIDS CAME WITH YOU, WHETHER THEY WANTED TO OR
NOT AND SERVED THIS TIME WITH YOU. A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO
THEM FOR THAT.
I ALSO WANT TO JUST MENTION, I THINK YOU HAVE UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP
WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL. EVERYONE FEELS THAT YOU FEEL
AND TREAT THEM EQUALLY TO HOW YOU TREAT THE OTHER AND THAT
CERTAINLY TAKES A VERY SPECIAL SKILL. WHAT PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T
KNOW IN THE LITANY OF THINGS YOU HAVE DONE, IS THE WORK WHEN WE
WENT TO NEW YORK AS THE GUEST OF THE MAYOR. AND WE SAT WITH THE
FIRST LADY AND TALKED ABOUT HER THRIVE PROGRAM AND HOW SHE WAS
IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK THAT WE DID HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. IT WAS
TWO THINGS, WE GOT A LITTLE INFORMATION FROM THEM, BUT THEY GOT A
LOT OF INFORMATION FROM US IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DID. I HEARD A LOT
OF KUDOS AND THANK YOU AFTER WE LEFT. IMPORTANT TO KNOW, IS THE
WORK YOU DID WITH ME, ESTABLISHING THE SISTER CITY IN HAITI. AND HOW

PAGE 24

Jun 21, 2021

DEEPLY THAT WORK WAS APPRECIATED IN WAYS THAT WE'LL PROBABLY
NEVER KNOW. THAT WAS GROUNDBREAKING WORK THAT YOU WERE ON
THE BOTTOM LEVEL, THE FIRST FLOOR OF GETTING THAT STARTED. IF THAT
WASN'T ALL, THEN COMING TOGETHER, I THINK, AT LEAST ONCE OR TWO
YEARS WITH THE BLACK MARATHON RUNNERS. PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T
KNOW -- HE DIDN'T RUN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW. HE DID NOT RUN, BUT HE
WAS THERE IN SUPPORT -- AS WAS I, I DIDN'T RUN EITHER. WITH THE 40 OR
50 BLACK MARATHONERS THAT COME TO MASSACHUSETTS EVERY YEAR AND
HAVE THIS EVENT. THERE WAS CLAUDE, SUPPORTING THE RUNNERS,
SUPPORTING A RUNNER, JUST AS BEING THERE -- WHEN YOU SERVE AS A
PERSON OF COLOR, YOUR COMMUNITY IS MUCH BROADER THAN JUST THE
JOB. AND PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS PICK THAT UP AND KNOW THAT.
THEN HAVING THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE RICH
CULTURE AND COMMUNITY OF HAITI IS EXTRAORDINARY, BUT IT DOES MEAN
THERE'S AN ADDED AMOUNT OF WORK THAT COMES WITH. AND I DON'T
KNOW WE'RE MAKING THE 100 EMAIL, PHONE CALL, TO BE BY YOUR OFFICE,
GRABBED YOU IN THE STREET, RELEASE THE BOUNTY, IT IS HARD WORK, BUT
GOOD WORK THAT COMES WITH THAT. SAN ANTONIO -- YOU TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE SHOULD NOT HOLD YOU
BACK FROM THAT. I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE. I HOPE
THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME WE SEE YOU IN PERSON -- NOT IN ZOOM.
WE ALL HAVE ZOOM FATIGUE AND IF I NEVER DO ANOTHER ZOOM AGAIN, IT
WILL BE TOO SOON. THAT ASIDE, IT IS INTERESTING. WE HAD THE BATTLES
AND WE GOT BY IT. WE WORKED TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY AND I THINK
THE SUM TOTAL OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE WILL LEAVE CAMBRIDGE
FOREVER CHANGED AND A BETTER PLACE THAN IT WAS. I'M GLAD YOU TOOK
A TIME TO STOP BY. PAUSE WITH US AND SHARE YOUR RICHES, YOUR
TALENTS AND YOUR UNIQUE ABILITIES WITH OUR CITY. I KNOW YOU WILL DO
A LITTLE OF THAT OR A LOT OF THAT IN SAN ANTONIO. I HOPE YOU
REMEMBER US FONDLY AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I SPOKE EARLIER AND I WON'T
REPEAT ALL THE PRAISE THAT I SAID. COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, A FRIEND AT A
NONPROFIT IN ANOTHER CITY ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY WAY THEY COULD
SPEAK TO THE HEAD OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. I SAID, ABSOLUTELY. I
KNEW CLAUDE WOULD ACCEPT JUST BEING CLAUDE. I SENT AN EMAIL AND
LITERALLY WITHIN TWO MINUTES THERE WAS THE RESPONSE. THAT'S PART
OF CLAUDE'S SUCCESS -- HIS OPENNESS. I HAVE ONE LAST MEDICAL
QUESTION, HEALTH QUESTION TO ASK... WILL YOU RECONSIDER YOUR
MOVE? THANK YOU, IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAMBER.
VICE-MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THE RESIDENTS OF CAMBRIDGE ARE
LUCKY TO HAVE YOU FOR THE 14 YEARS. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE
RESIDENTS AND THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE BEEN SO BLESSED TO HAVE YOU FOR
THE LAST 450 DAYS AS WE WEATHERED THIS PANDEMIC TOGETHER WITH
YOU AT THE HELM OF OUR CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, I'M


PAGE 25

Jun 21, 2021

SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU OR YOUR TEAM THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH. HERE WE ALL WERE AND I THINK IT IS
ONLY FITTING THAT WE ARE BACK IN THE CHAMBER TONIGHT TO HAVE THE
CELEBRATION OF YOUR TIME HERE IN CAMBRIDGE WITH THE ENTIRE CITY
DEPARTMENT HEAD STAFF BEHIND YOU, WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE
PAST 16 MONTHS BEHIND YOU, BEHIND YOUR TEAM AND MAKE SURE THAT
WE MADE THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. I DON'T THINK
WE'LL EVER BE ABLE TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE ENOUGH TO YOU. SO,
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, THANK YOU FOR DEALING WITH THIS COUNCIL
EVERY SINGLE MONDAY NIGHT AS WE TRIED TO TELEGRAPHIC THE FEAR AND
ANXIETY WE'D HEAR FROM THE RESIDENTS DIRECTLY. AND THANK YOU FOR
BEING PATIENT WITH US. I UNDERSTAND THAT SAN ANTONIO IS THE LUCKY
RECIPIENT OF THE JACOB FAMILY AND THE NEXT STEP ON YOUR JOURNEY AS
YOU MOVE THROUGH THE LIFE. I HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL, THE RESIDENTS ARE
CAMBRIDGE ARE GRATEFUL EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND
THE JOB YOU HAVE DONE HERE. I WILL SAY THANK YOU AND THE BEST OF
LUCK TO YOU IN YOUR NEXT ENDEAVORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK
YOU HAVE DONE AND YOUR FLEXIBILITY, YOUR PATIENCE AS NOTED. I HAVE
TESTED IT A FEW TIMES MYSELF AND HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY YOUR
WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN AND ACCOMMODATE OUR REQUESTS,
PARTICULARLY MY OBSESSION WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF DATA AROUND COVID
AND YOU WENT THROUGH GREAT LENGTHS TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE
THAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AS A FELLOW CARIBBEAN, MOST HAVE A
CREOLE LANGUAGE AND HAITI DOES AND SURINAME. I WISH YOU WELL. I
HOPE YOU WILL KEEP IN TOUCH AND SEND US AN OCCASIONAL POSTCARD
FROM TEXAS. ALL THE BEST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL, I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN,
IT IS QUITE A JOURNEY AND ONE OF THE MOMENTS -- THERE'S MOMENTS
FROM THE PANDEMIC YOU WON'T FORGET AND ONE OF THEM IS WITH YOU
IN THE PARLOR, SITTING AND TALKING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH STUFF
WE CAN COLLABORATE ON AND GETTING EXCITED ABOUT IT. WE STARTED
TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S SOMETHING HAPPENING IN CHINA. WE ARE -- THE
FLU IS MORE SERIOUS AND THEN LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. SO, IT HAS BEEN A
LOT OF TENSE MOMENTS, A LOT OF GREAT MOMENTS, SO WE'LL MISS YOU
HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: SIMPLY, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CITY COUNCIL
FOR THIS RECOGNITION. ON BEHALF THE JACOB HOUSEHOLD, THANK YOU
ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE, NICOLE, AND OUR THREE KIDS. THAT'S WHY I GET
UP EACH DAY THINKING ABOUT FAMILY FIRST. I HAVE TO SAY AT MY CORE,
I'M A PROUD PUBLIC SERVANT. SO, IT IS AN HONOR TO SERVE HERE, HANG
OUT HERE WITH COACH, TO REALLY LEARN FROM DR. ASSAAD SAYAH AND
OTHERS AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE. AT
THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS BECAUSE OF MY FANTASTIC TEAM. I SAID IT FROM
THE FIRST DAY I STARTED, I TRY TO LEARN NAMES, TRY TO CONNECT, BUT


PAGE 26

Jun 21, 2021

REALLY THEIR PASSION FOR THE WORK, IT WAS CRYSTAL-YEAR TO ME FROM
DAY ONE. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING, I'M AN AMPLIFIER OF WHAT IS EMBEDDED
IN THE DEPARTMENT. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE AN AMBASSADORS FROM
COAST TO COAST, IT IS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE TALENT IN THE CITY. EACH
YEAR WHEN WE HAVE THE CITY MANAGER'S AWARD CEREMONIES, I LOVE TO
HEAR STORIES FROM COLLEAGUES THAT TALK ABOUT WHY THEY LOVE
WORKING FOR THE CITY. FOR ME, THESE 14 YEARS, IT HAS ADDED TO MY
REPERTOIRE AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY. I'M
BATTLE-TESTED. I'LL SAY THAT. I'M BRINGING THE CAMBRIDGE WAY TO THE
ALAMO, WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES OVER. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WANT
TO SAY THANK YOU. TOO MANY NAMES TO GO DOWN THE LIST TO SAY
THANK YOU. I REALLY DIDN'T GET HERE ON MY OWN. I THINK ABOUT
PROJECTS AND PARTNERS, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS TALKED ABOUT SISTER
CITY, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE STORY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PRO-EMS,
EACH TIME GOING DOWN THERE, DO TRAININGS. I BRING SOME LANGUAGE
AND SOME LOGISTICAL SKILLS, REALLY THEY BRING THE BRAWN AND THE
LABOR. WHETHER IT IS HAITI OR EAST CAMBRIDGE, I WILL APPLAUD AND
THANK PARTNERS. I CAN'T SAY THANKS ENOUGH TO THE STAFF. DR.
DOBBERTEEN, MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, SHE IS BEHIND ME. AS POINT OF
FACT, SHE HAS A PRACTICE, SHE SEES PATIENTS AND DOESN'T MISS A
MEETING NOR A SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING OR A LEADERSHIP TEAM
MEETING NOR HOT WASHES -- I DON'T KNOW WHEN SHE SLEEPS. I SAY -- IT IS
BECAUSE OF THE TALENT AND THE PASSION OF THE DEPARTMENT. I SAY
THANK YOU, I BID YOU FAREWELL. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY, AT THE END OF
THE DAY, IT IS MY UTMOST HONOR TO SERVE HERE IN THE MAGICAL
KINGDOM. I HEARD OF CAMBRIDGE, LANDED HERE AND FELT LIKE A
MARTIAN, BUT THE COVID EXPERIENCE BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND I
APPRECIATE WHAT I CAN LEARN AND BRING TO SAN ANTONIO. LOOK
FORWARD TO STAYING CONNECTED AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ON
BEHALF THE OUR HOUSEHOLD, BEHALF OF MY EXTENDED FAMILY, PARENTS
AND FOLKS WHO HAVE POURED INTO ME, MENTORS AND CLASSMATES, IT IS
REALLY BEEN AN HONOR TO SHARE AND TO BE WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF YOU. WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. I SAY THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR AND
RECOGNITION AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING GREAT THINGS IN YOUR
CONTINUED SUCCESSES. YOU ARE IN GREAT SHAPE, I LEAVE YOU IN GOOD
HANDS AND I WISH YOU WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING
THE RESOLUTION. CAN WE DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE?
>> MR. CLERK: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLACING THE COMMUNICATION ON FILE ALONG WITH
THE COMMUNICATION AND OTHER REPORTS. CLOSING PUBLIC COMMENT.
AND ADOPTING THE RESOLUTION.

Motion to Adopt the Late
Resolution for Claude Jacob,
Close Public Comment, place
City Manager’s Agenda #1 on
file, and place Communications
and Reports from other
Officers #3 on file

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, WE'LL MOVE TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM
ONE. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER THREE). I WILL THANK

PAGE 27

Jun 21, 2021

DAVID ON THIS. I BUGGED HIM FOR A BIT AND THE CITY MANAGER ON THIS.
I APPRECIATE SEEING IT BEFORE US. GOING TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK AND
MAKE SURE THIS IS ON THE AGENDA WITH THE CITY STAFF. I'M CURIOUS, I'M
GLAD TO SEE THIS ON THE AGENDA. IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT OVER THE LAST 16 MONTHS. I'M CURIOUS, WHO DOLL THIS WORK,
HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE AND WILL THERE BE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE
NEXT FISCAL YEAR FOR US TO CONSIDER IN THE BUDGET?
>> CITY MANAGER: I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MR. KALE. AND I
RECOGNIZE MR. MALONEY IS ON THE LINE AS WELL. IF WE NEED JIM, WE'LL
LET HIM JUMP IN. DAVID?
>> DAVID: WITH THE APPROPRIATION TONIGHT, WE'LL BEGIN THE PROCESS
OF SELECTING A VENDOR TO BEGIN THE PROCESS AND SCOPE IT OUT. WE DO
HAVE A SCOPE OF SERVICES ALREADY PREPARED. THEY WILL REVIEW THAT
USING THE HOUSE PROCESS AND GIVE US A PRICE AND THEY WILL INCLUDE A
TIMELINE AND THE LIKE. I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER
ABOUT THE TIMELINE. I THINK IT WILL DEPEND ON THE VENDOR OR THE
ARCHITECT. I SUSPECT SOMETHING OF THIS COMPLEXITY WILL TAKE AT LEAST
A YEAR, MAYBE LESS OR MORE. JIM MAY HAVE ANOTHER OPINION ABOUT
THAT. WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE EXPANSION CAPABILITIES OF
SOME OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND DOING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE
MAJOR SYSTEM. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO DO THE SURVEY AND PROVIDE
INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW IF JIMMY HAS ANYMORE TO ADD.
>> I THINK YOU SAID IT QUITE WELL.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THE SCOPE OF SERVICES, IT DOESN'T HAVE A
TIMELINE IN IT?
>> WE HAVE NOT SOLICITED THAT TO OUR HOUSE DOCTORS. THAT WILL BE
THE NEXT PIECE, WHICH IS FOR THEM TO DEFINE WHAT THE TIMELINE TO DO
WHAT WE'RE ASKING WILL BE.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THE LAST TIME WE HAD A
CONVERSATION ABOUT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, I THINK IT WAS AT A
NEIGHBORHOOD LONG-TERM COMMITTEE PLANNING THAT COUNCILLOR
NOLAN CHAIRED, THERE WAS A MEMBER OF THE NEWTON SCHOOL
COMMITTEE AND SHOWED THE SPREADSHEET OF ALL THE BUILDINGS THAT
HAD A TIMELINE WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ON
IT. IT WAS VERY CLEAR. I THINK WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO
VISUALIZE WHAT EXACTLY THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS NEED. AND WHEN THEY
NEED IT BY, KNOWING WHICH PROJECT WILL COME NEXT. I HOPE THAT -- I
LIKED THERE WAS GOING TO BE TIMELINE FOR EACH SCHOOL AND I HOPE WE
CAN VISUALIZE IT ON THE WEBSITE OR IN THE CAPITAL SECTION OF THE
WEBSITE SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IF AND WHEN THOSE IMPROVEMENTS
WILL HAPPEN FOR THEIR SCHOOLS.
I THINK THE OTHER THING I WANT TO BRING UP IN THIS MEETING AS WE ARE
CONSIDERING AN RFP AND THE PROCESS, WHICH I AGREE, I THINK


PAGE 28

Jun 21, 2021

EVERYBODY AGREES NEEDS TO HAPPEN, BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS
THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS AND WHICH SCHOOLS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
FIRST. FMA AND (INAUDIBLE) NEED TO BE ADDRESSED FIRST. THEY SERVE
THE MOST AMOUNT OF THE LOW-INCOME KIDS. KLO HAD AN INTENSE
AMOUNT OF WEAR ON IT, BEING A SWING SCHOOL, EACH FOUR YEARS THEY
HAVE A NEW GROUP OF KIDS IN. THE WEAR AND TEAR IS INTENSE, BUT IT
WAS IN NEED OF A LOT OF UPGRADES PRIOR TO THAT ON THEIR MAJOR
SYSTEMS. I THINK WE FOUND OUT WE LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF
VENTILATION, THE WINDOW DIDN'T OPEN ON THE FIRST FLOOR. I THINK
THERE NEEDS TO BE COSMETIC UPGRADES. IT SHOULD FEEL LIKE THE REST OF
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHEN YOU WALK IN. THERE ARE BRICKS ON THE
GROUND WHEN YOU WALK IN. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT REALLY NEEDS TO SO
WHEN FAMILIES ARE MANDATORY ASSIGNED EACH YEAR. WE WANT IT TO BE
FEEL BRIGHT, WELCOMING, AND I DON'T WANT US TO DISCOUNT THE
COSMETIC UPGRADES WHEN WE LOOK AT UPGRADES WHILE THINKING
ABOUT ROOFS, VENTILATION, AND WINDOWS AND SOME OF THE STUFF YOU
DON'T SEE. I THINK FOR KLO AND FMA, WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
PRIORITIZING THE SCHOOLS, BUT DOING THOSE COSMETIC UPGRADES.
THE LAST THING I WILL SAY, I KNOW A GROUP AT MIT GOT TOGETHER AND
REALLY LOOKED AT SEVERAL OF THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS OR A PROJECT WITH
MR. MALONEY AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. FMA WAS ON THE LIST OF JUST
LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTIONS WITHOUT A
COMPLETE RENOVATION OF THE SCHOOL. THE STUDENTS THAT DID THAT
SCHOOL REALLY LOOKED AT IT THROUGH A NEURO-DIVERSITY LENS. FMA
SERVES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KIDS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM
DISORDER, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE THINK ABOUT SOCIOECONOMIC
DIVERSITY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE UPGRADES. THAT'S A LOT TO SAY
AND I'M EXCITED WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND PLOTTING OUT WHERE
WE MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES TO THE SCHOOLS. I WANT TO SAY I
HOPE THAT WE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT, THINKING ABOUT EQUITY AND
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT EQUITY IT CAN'T JUST BE SOCIOECONOMIC EQUITY,
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BEEN THAT NEURO-DIVERSITY EQUITY WHEN WE
THINK ABOUT THE FMA. I WILL YIELD BACK BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OTHER
COLLEAGUES HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL SAY COLLEAGUES ON THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE
HAVE RAISED SIMILAR -- THEY HAVE RAISED SIMILAR COMMENTS AND SO
FORTH. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND
THEN COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS FOR THIS. I AGREE
WITH EVERYTHING VICE-MAYOR MALLON SAID. DO WE HAVE A LIST OF
WHICH SCHOOLS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS TIME?
>> JIMMY MAY HAVE ONE OF THE TOP. BASICALLY, THE NEWER SCHOOLS,
SUCH AS THE KING OPEN IS NOT INCLUDED AND THE OTHER SCHOOLS ARE
INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. AND OBVIOUSLY THE TOBIN WOULDN'T BE PART
OF THE PROCESS EITHER. JIMMY, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD.
>> NO. THAT'S CORRECT. THOSE THREE SCHOOLS -- THREE BUILDINGS. THEY

PAGE 29

Jun 21, 2021

HOUSE TWO SCHOOLS. BUT THE HIGH SCHOOL WOULDN'T BE PART OF THE
STUDY. THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DONE COMPLETELY IN THE LAST TEN
YEARS OR NEW IN THE TEN YEARS WILL BE EXEMPT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. EVERY SCHOOL EXCEPT THOSE
FOUR ARE GOING TO BE LOOKED AT?
>> YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GREAT. THANK YOU. WILL YOU MAKE SOME
TYPE OF REPORT BACK TO US THAT SAYS WE LOOKED AT ALL OF THE SCHOOLS
AND THEN FOR EACH ONE, HERE'S WHAT WE THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN?
>> DAVID: I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO
DETERMINE WHICH SCHOOLS MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR EXPANSION
OPPORTUNITIES TO DEAL WITH INCREASING ENROLLMENT. AND OBVIOUSLY,
LOOKING AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND SEE HOW IT FITS INTO
THE OVERALL CAPITAL PLAN AND/OR THE APPLICATIONS FOR ACCELERATED
MAINTENANCE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK EVENTUALLY ONE OF THE DECISIONS THAT WILL
HAVE TO BE MADE IS WE HAVE DONE THREE SCHOOLS COMPLETELY OVER.
THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU DO A FOURTH SCHOOL OVER, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE OTHER SCHOOLS. DO WE TAKE A DIFFERENT
APPROACH. I THINK WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH MR. MALONEY IN THE
PROCESS OF DOING THE THREE SCHOOLS TO TRY TO PUT AS MUCH
ADDITIONAL MONEY AS WE COULD INTO THE OTHER SCHOOLS, BUT IT IS
SIMPLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU INVEST THIS TYPE OF MONEY. IT MAY BE A
TIME TO LOOK AT A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHERE YOU TAKE ON TWO OR
THREE SCHOOLS WITH A SMALLER AMOUNT AND GETTING THEM READY
VERSUS JUST ONE. HOPEFULLY THE STUDY WILL GET THAT CONVERSATION
GOING AND SEE WHERE WE END UP.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. AND THEN ARE YOU LOOKING AT
WHEN YOU SAY EXPANSION DUE TO ENROLLMENT, WE ALSO LOOK AT PRE-K
OPPORTUNITIES?
>> MR. MALONEY?
>> I LOST THE LAST QUESTION. CAN YOU REPEAT IT, PLEASE?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES. ARE YOU ALSO LOOKING AT PRE-K
OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF SPACE?
>> YES, THAT CAN BE LOOKED AT AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO
HAVE SPOKEN AND ASKED A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I HAD. I WANT TO ECHO
WHAT VICE-MAYOR MALLON SAID ABOUT THE NEWTON PLAN, WHICH WE
PRESENTED A YEAR AGO. IT IS A GREAT PLAN, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, CAN I
FORWARD THE INFORMATION. IT WILL LAY OUT THE DISTRICT WITH A


PAGE 30

Jun 21, 2021

20-YEAR PLAN. I RECOMMEND -- I KNOW DURING MY MEETING, WE HAD
SEVERAL DIFFERENT REVIEWS OF ALL OF THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS, THE STATE
DID ONE, THEY RENT ALL THE BUILDINGS, WE HIRED CONSULTANTS TO LOOK,
IS THIS ALONG THE LINES OF THOSE STUDIES THAT WERE DONE IN THE PAST
AND ARE THEY BUILDING ON THE STUDIES.
>> SO, IF I MAY, WHAT THE STATE DID IS A CURSORY REVIEW. I DON'T KNOW
IF IT IS ANYTHING THAT IS IN DEPTH THAT WOULD BE OF SIGNIFICANT VALUE
TO US. CERTAINLY DID IDENTIFY THE BUILDINGS WE ALSO THOUGHT WERE IN
THE WORST SHAPE AND THOSE ARE THE ONES IDENTIFIED BACK AT THE
CREATION OF THE INNOVATION AGENDA BACK IN 2012.
PRIOR TO THAT, GOING BACK TO SOMEWHERE IN THE EARLY 2000S, MAYBE
2005 OR SO, THERE WAS AN OUTSIDE REVIEW THAT LOOKED AT THE
LIFECYCLE OF THE EQUIPMENT. NOT AN -- WE LOOK AT THIS AS BEING MORE
IN DEPTH STUDY THAN ANYTHING WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THE
INNOVATION AGENDA IDENTIFIED THE BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN
DOING, NOW THAT WE COME UP ON THE END OF THAT AND FACING -- UNTIL
THIS YEAR -- SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT PRESSURE FOR MORE SPACE. WE
EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. IT IS LITTLE EARLY TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN. YOU
LOOK AT THE PROJECTS UNDERWAY FROM A HOUSING STANDPOINT, YOU
HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THEY WILL CONTINUE.
THIS STUDY WILL BE MORE IN DEPTH THAN THE STUDIES YOU HAVE SPOKEN
ABOUT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN? I'M SORRY. COUNCILLOR
NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I REMEMBER THOSE STUDIES. I
PROBABLY HAVE THEM IN MY FILE. THEY WERE THE REPLACEMENT COST,
BUT SEEK TO IDENTIFY THE SCHOOLS IN THE CITY. I BELIEVE SOME OF THE
DIFFERENCE, THE TOBIN WASN'T ON THE INITIAL LIST TO BE REPLACED. I
HOPE THAT PART OF THIS PROCESS IDENTIFIES THOSE SCHOOLS, WHICH I
BELIEVE YOU REFERENCED, SO WE CAN SPEND LESS MONEY NOW SO WE
DON'T DELAY THE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF THE BUILDINGS SO IN TEN
YEARS WE FIND WE HAVE TO REBUILD THEM. ESPECIALLY WITH THE CITY
TURNING INTO -- LOOKING AT EMBODY ENERGY AND THE BUILDINGS
EXISTING AND WE SHOULD WALK THAT TALK WITH ENSURING EVERYTHING
WE CAN DO -- MAKE SURE THE EMBODY ENERGY IN THE BUILDING DON'T
HAVE TO LEAD US TO... SPEAKING OF EMBODIED ENERGY AND THE
QUESTIONS ON DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN RAISED. WE HAVE THE SWING
SPACE. THAT WOULD BE LOOKED AT BECAUSE THAT WASN'T LOOKED AT THE
PRIOR TIME.
>> YES, THAT'S PART OF THE INVENTORY.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: WILL THIS INCLUDE WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE ANY
BUILDING FULLY ELECTRIFIED? AGAIN, THE CITY HAS A GOAL TO MOVE
TOWARDS FOSSIL FREE AND MOVE TO SCHOOLS BEING NET-ZERO, WITHOUT
TEARING THEM, MAKE SURE THEY ARE GREATER ELECTRIFICATION, IS THAT


PAGE 31

Jun 21, 2021

PART OF THE RFP STUDY?
>> ALL OF THE UNDERLYING POLICIES THAT THE CITY COUNCIL AND SCHOOL
COMMITTEE ARE PART OF THE REVIEW.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SPECIFIC TO ELECTRIFICATION OF THE ENTIRE
BUILDING?
>> I THINK IT COULD BE. IF THAT IS -- THE COUNCIL POLICY I'M NOT SURE IF
IT SPECIFIES ELECTRICITY. I THINK IT TALKS ABOUT NON-FOSSIL FUEL. WE
CAN MAKE IT HOWEVER IT IS. WE HAVE TO COME BACK FOR FUNDING. WE
WON'T COME BACK IN VIOLATION OF ANY POLICY.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YOU ARE RIGHT. FOSSIL-FUEL FREE. TO GET
THROUGH FOR ENERGY IS THROUGH PASSIVE USE OR ELECTRIFICATION.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I THANK FOR TO THAT REVIEW AND I'M GLAD THOSE
ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED. IF YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION FROM
NEWTON, I'M HAPPY TO FORWARD IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE BRIEF
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION ON THE PRE-K PIECE SINCE UNIVERSAL PRE-K IS ON
THE COUNCIL FOR A LONG TIME. AND IT IS GREAT TO HEAR THE EXPANSION
STUDY IS INCLUDING THAT AS A PIECE OF IT. I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT
THE ENROLLMENT INCREASE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT NEW
CAPACITY WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO ENCOMPASS THE PROJECTED INCREASE
IN STUDENTS VERSUS WHAT WE THINK OF FOR NEW USES. DO WE HAVE A
SENSE OF THE PROJECTED INCREASE FOR THE BUILDINGS? I KNOW IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR SURE, BUT TRYING TO GET A SENSE.
>> YES, WE DO AS PART -- I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME. I BELIEVE MS.
SEMONOFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS ACCESS TO THIS. PART OF THE PRE-K, WE
WORKED WITH A CONSULTANT TO DEVELOP A LONG-RANGE ENROLLMENT
PROJECTIONS THAT LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF PIECES THAT ARE ONGOING IN
THE CITY, CERTAINLY THE -- THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THAT ARE
ONGOING IN THE CITY. I WAS LOOKING AT THAT THIS AFTERNOON. THAT
WOULD DEFINITELY BE PART OF IT. WE HOPE TO BUILD ON THAT. VERIFY
AND NOT SPENT A LOT OF TIME OR MONEY ON THOSE SINCE THEY ARE FAIRLY
RECENT. I THINK WHAT WE'LL LOOK AT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IS WHAT
KIND OF A BLIP THE PANDEMIC RESULTED IN. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN A
UPTICK IN REGISTRATION SINCE -- AND RETURNS SINCE THE SPRING AND THE
VACCINE ROLLOUT. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC IT WILL BE A RETURN TO NORMAL
THERE.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. THAT'S IS GOOD TO
HEAR AND GOOD TO HEAR IT IS HAPPENING. SPACE CAPACITY ISSUES IS A BIG
CONSTRAINT OF THE PRE-K ROLLOUT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I YIELD BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I THINK THIS IS EXCITING. I THINK
THIS IS CLEARLY NEEDED AND I GREATLY LOOK FORWARD TO IT. AS A PRE-K


PAGE 32

Jun 21, 2021

ENTHUSIAST, THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THE PROGRAM AND YOU ALREADY
DISCUSSED THAT. WHEN WE THINK OF EXPANSION, IF THAT IS WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO LOOK AT IN ADDITION TO MAINTENANCE AND HOPEFULLY MAKING
THE PUBLIC SPACES OF THE SOME OF THE SCHOOLS MUCH MORE INVITING,
EVEN WITH PAINT, LIGHT COLORS, GETTING THE RIGHT CONSULTANTS TO DO
THAT AND FLOORING, IF WE'RE GOING UP, THAT RAISES CODE ISSUES. IT
WILL MEAN GREATER IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LOWER FLOOR OR FLOOR S TO
MEET PRESENT-DAY CODE. THAT'S A SERIOUS TIME ISSUE. I'M ASSUMING
THE CONSULTANT WILL LOOK ON BUILD-OUT AND WHAT THAT MEANS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF THE 50-YEAR-OLD PLUS SCHOOLS. I THINK THE
UNINTENDED GOAL OR THE UNSTATED GOAL IS TO MAKE ALL OUR SCHOOLS
EQUAL IN QUALITY. NOW, OBVIOUSLY THREE NEW IMPRESSIVE SCHOOLS ARE
GOING TO BE HARD TO MATCH. WE HAVE TO TRY TO BE AS CLOSE TO THAT
AS POSSIBLE. WE'VE SET, MAYBE IN A PLAN WAY, A STANDARD FOR SOME OF
OUR KIDS. I'M THRILLED THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT, BUT I THINK WE
HAVE TO APPROACH THAT STANDARD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING. THE REALLY UNKNOWN QUALITY HERE IS SOME OF THE
SCHOOLS HAVE VERY LITTLE OPEN SPACE. SOME HAVE MORE.
THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH OPEN SPACE, I GREW UP IN NEW YORK
CITY, AT LEAST A FEW YEARS, OUR OPEN SPACE WAS ON THE ROOF. THAT
WAS WHERE THE BASKETBALL COURT AND WAS THAT'S WHY GYM TOOK
PLACE ON GOOD DAYS. I HOPE WE LOOK BEYOND THE BUILDING PER SE AND
LOOK AT WHAT A FULL EDUCATION IS. I'M SURE WE WILL, I'M JUST HOPING
WE DO THAT.
I THINK THE COMMENTS BY ALL THE COUNCILLORS ARE RIGHT ON TARGET
AND TRULY MAKES WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING BOTH THE SCHOOL
DEPARTMENT AND THE MANAGER'S OFFICE, VERY EXCITING AND WE ALL
LOOK VERY FORWARD TO THIS. A YEAR'S TIME TO DO THIS STUDY RIGHT IS
ABOUT -- GOT TO BE DARN CLOSE GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. I THINK
THE TIMING IS RIGHT AS WELL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO
MUCH TIME ON THIS. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES, PARTICULARLY
AROUND THE EARLY CHILDHOOD PIECE. AND I WANT TO THANK VICE-MAYOR
MALLON FOR TALKING ABOUT FMA AND KLO. MY TWINS WENT TO KLO AND
WE TALKED A LOT AND WE HEARD FROM PARENTS THERE AND FROM STAFF
AND PRINCIPAL, ISSUES WITH THE CONDITION OF THE BUILDING. ONE OF
WHICH BEING -- TO THE POINT AROUND NOT JUST THE FINANCIAL
INEQUITIES, BUT THE CAFETERIA THERE HAS NO SOUND-PROOFING. A LOT OF
KIDS HAVE TO EAT WITH HEADPHONES ON BECAUSE OF SENSORY ISSUES. IT
WAS REALLY HARD FOR A LOT OF KIDS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS ALL BEING LOOKED AT. AND CERTAINLY
SUPPORT WHATEVER WE HAVE TO DO TO RENOVATE OUR BUILDINGS. AS
COUNCILLOR CARLONE POINTED OUT, THERE ARE BUILDINGS WHERE WE CAN
EXPAND MORE BECAUSE THE FOOTPRINT IS LARGER, SUCH AS WE ARE DOING


PAGE 33

Jun 21, 2021

AT TOBIN. THERE ARE OTHER BUILDINGS THAT ARE LANDLOCKED AND TELL
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR DOING
IT. AND LET'S -- WHILE DOING THIS STUDY AND IT WILL TAKE TIME TO DO IT
AND GET THIS WORKED OUT, I ASSUME WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THE
ONGOING RENOVATIONS AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE NEED TO DO. WE
WON'T PUT THINGS ON HOLD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WHILE TRYING TO
FIGURE THINGS OUT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUFF STAYS ON OUR
DOCKET AS WELL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S ALL WHO SIGNED OR WHO
RAISED THEIR HANDS. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION?
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION OF THE APPROPRIATION.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
#3
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of $1,000,000
from Free Cash, to the Public
Investment Fund School
Department Extraordinary
Expenditures account to
conduct a comprehensive
review and assessment of our
older elementary school
buildings in the City.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: ABSENT.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM SIX.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 6).
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND STAFF FOR THIS AUTHORIZATION. I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO -- I WAS SPENDING THIS MONEY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT
AWARE, MONEY THAT IS BEING COLLECTED FROM OUR COMMUNITY CHOICE
AGGREGATION ELECTRICITY PROGRAM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE SPEND
THIS ON SOLAR PANEL PROJECTS, SO DO WE HAVE ANY LIST OF PROJECTS
THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED SO FAR? AND WHAT WAY WE ARE PLANNING TO
IMPLEMENT SOLAR PANELS?
>> THE FIRST PROJECT IS THE ONE THAT IS UPCOMING AND GOING INTO
CONSTRUCTION THIS SUMMER. IT IS THE GRAHAM AND PARKS SCHOOL.
THAT PROJECT IS INTENDED TO BE EXECUTED LAST SUMMER, BUT DUE TO
COVID, IT HAS BEEN DELAYED. THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED AND HAS
A CONSTRUCTION DATE OF THIS SUMMER. IT WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE
EARLY FALL. AND THEN WE LOOK TO USE THE REMAINING FUNDS AND PLUS
THE FUNDS ACCUMULATING BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT CONSTRUCTION
SEASON ON OTHER MOST LIKELY SCHOOL PROJECTS. WE HAVE BEEN
LOOKING AT -- THEY INCLUDE PEABODY AND MORRIS. WE DON'T HAVE A
FINAL CANDIDATE FOR THOSE YET. THERE ARE CERTAINLY PLENTY OF


PAGE 34

Jun 21, 2021

OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEND THE FUNDS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. DO WE LIMIT IT TO SCHOOL
BUILDINGS OR THOSE THAT ARE JUST LOW HANGING FRUIT RIGHT NOW?
>> NO, IT IS NOT A PURPOSEFUL LIMIT. ONLY SCHOOL BUILDINGS, IT CAN BE
ANY BUILDING. THEORETICALLY, IT COULD BE A PRIVATE BUILDING BECAUSE
THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT GO TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE
AGGREGATION. I DID WANT TO JUST ADD ONE ADDITIONAL THING BECAUSE
THE WAY THE AGGREGATION WORKS, IT ALLOWS US TO INVEST THE ADDED
FUNDS WE COLLECT FROM ALL THE PARTICIPANTS, BUT ONCE THOSE
PROJECTS ARE UP AND RUNNING, THEY GENERATE NET METERING CREDITS,
WHICH WILL THEN BE DEPOSITED INTO THE REVOLVING FUND. AN
INVESTMENT MADE IN YEAR ONE WILL DERIVE BENEFITS FOR
APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS, BUT BUILD UP ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE
CREDITS THAT WE ARE OWED. IT IS AN EXPAND ING PIE OVER TIME.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. WHO DO WE SELL THOSE NET
METERING CREDITS TO?
>> SO, THEY CAN BE SOLD ON THE MARKET. IT IS USUALLY NOT HARD TO
FIND AN OFF-TAKER. LIKE OURSELVES, WE HAVE BOUGHT NET METERING
CREDITS TO LOWER OUR UTILITY BILLS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP ON THIS MATTER.
WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING THE ORDER.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 8.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 8). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR? COUNCILLOR SIMMONS? (SILENCE). COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS, ARE YOU THERE?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS IS THE AGENDA
NUMBER EIGHT?

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
#6
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to a request
for authorization of a spending
limit of $1,900,000 for Fiscal
Year 2022, for the Renewable
Energy and Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) Reduction revolving
fund (Revolving Fund),
pursuant to Chapter 3.24 of the
Municipal Ordinance titled
“Departmental Revolving
Funds”.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WANT TO THANK THE -- SORRY, MY AUDIO IS
NOT THE BEST. I WILL THANK THE CITY MANAGER FOR BRINGING THIS ITEM
FORWARD ABOUT THE PEARL STREET LIBRARY. COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT
TO SAY BRIEFLY. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LIBRARIES IN CAMBRIDGE AND
MY RESEARCH MAY NOT BE ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE, BUT THIS IS WHAT I
BELIEVE. I THINK WE HAVE SEVEN BRANCH LIBRARIES. SEVEN LIBRARIES. THE
BRANCH AND SIX OTHERS. I BELIEVE THEY MAY ALL BE NAMED AFTER MEN,
BUT I'M NOT SURE AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM ARE NAMED FOR
PEOPLE OF COLOR, WHICH IS PART OF THE REASON WHY I BROUGHT IN THE
POLICY ORDER THAT ASKS FOR THIS. I'M HAPPY WE'LL STUDY THIS, I HOPE IT


PAGE 35

Jun 21, 2021

DOESN'T TAKE SO LONG WE DON'T GET A RESPONSE IN A REASONABLE TIME.
IN TERMS OF THE PEARL STREET LIBRARY, IN PARTICULAR, IT DOES HAVE THE
LOUIS MEETING ROOM, IT IS NAMED AFTER THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN,
MAYBE THE ONLY ONE IN AN EXECUTIVE POSITION IN THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM. HE WAS THE ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN, I THINK, FOR THE MAIN
BRANCH.
WE HAVE A ROOM TO THAT TESTIFIES TO THAT AND THAT'S VERY GOOD AND
I'M PROUD OF THAT. WE ALSO HAVE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF LEROY
CRAGWELL, SERVED ON THE COUNCIL OF AGING BOARD, MAYBE SAT ON A
FEW ADVISORY BOARDS, ONE OF THE CAMBRIDGE SENIOR ADVISORS, DID A
LOT OF WORK FOR THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY
ACTIVISM AND PARTICIPATING ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THEY
ACKNOWLEDGED HIM AT THE CENTRAL SQUARE BRANCH LIBRARY BEFORE HE
DIED. AND OF COURSE, YOU HAVE THE BLACK HISTORY COLLECTION. I THINK
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE AS WE -- WE JUST CAME OFF OF
AND STILL CELEBRATING JUNE JUNETEENTH AND LIFT UP AND MANY
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY. JUST
TONIGHT, I HEARD THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY MENTION BY
SEVERAL CITY COUNCILS, ALL FOR GOOD REASON AND ALL IMPORTANT.
IT SEEMS TO ME EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR MIDST
THIS LIBRARY THAT SPEAKS TO EDUCATION AND VARIED OTHER THINGS
NAMED IN AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE MARIA BALDWIN... AND THE STATEMENT
ABOUT GETTING INTO GOOD TROUBLE.
I HOPE THAT MY -- TO BRING THIS FORWARD, I'M CONCERNED THIS DOESN'T
GET BOGGED DOWN THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I KNOW WE ARE
LOOKING FOR -- WE VOTE FOR THE WHOLE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND WE
THINK THAT WILL TAKE TWO YEARS. LASTLY, IN TERMS OF THE
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE LISTED THAT WILL PARTICIPATE, IT HAD THE
PORT, IT DIDN'T LIST RIVERSIDE. MOST OF US STUDY THE BLACK COMMUNITY
IN CAMBRIDGE, RIVERSIDE IS ONE OF THE LARGER COMMUNITIES, ALONG
WITH THE PORT AND WITH -- THE PORT, FORMALLY CALLED AREA 4,
CAMBRIDGEPORT, VERY STRONG COMPONENT OF NORTH CAMBRIDGE, AND
THEN RIVERSIDE, WHICH STILL HAS A SIGNIFICANT AFRICAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITY THERE. YOU DO LIST IN THE ASK -- IN TERMS OF
REPRESENTATION, YOU MENTIONED THE FAMILY POLICY COUNCIL, WHICH I
ASSUME MEANS THE YOUTH COUNCIL. MAYBE IT DOESN'T. THAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE CHANNEL YOUTH VOICES. I ADDED TO THE LIST,
REPRESENTATIVES FROM MBK OR A LIKE ORGANIZATION OR THE GOLD
PROGRAM OR A LIKE PROGRAM SO WE HAVE THE YOUTH VOICES.
WE WANT TO HEAR THEIR OPINION, BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE
PARTICIPATION AS WE LOOK AT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND ALWAYS
HAVING A HARD TIME TO FILL SLOTS. EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THEIR INTERESTS AND APPRECIATION IN
PARTICIPATING. IT IS JUST IMPORTANT THOSE TWO THINGS I WANT TO SAY.
ONE, I'M ASKING FOR THIS AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE WHO SUPPORT THE
ORDER, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TWO PEOPLE AND

PAGE 36

Jun 21, 2021

FOR ANYONE THAT MAY SAY, MS. BALDWIN, WE HAVE NAMED A SCHOOL
AND NOW TALK ABOUT CHANGING THE NAME OF THE COMMUNITY, I'D SAY
MY RESPONSE WOULD BE, PEOPLE LIKE TIP O'NEILL HAVE A LIBRARY, GOLF
COURSE, AND TIP O'NEILL DID INCREDIBLE WORK. THAT'S ONLY TO SAY WE
HAVE BUILDING S AND PLACES NAMED AFTER THE SAME INDIVIDUALS. THE
LAST PERSON I WOULD LIFT UP IS YOU THINK OF -- WE HAVE WASHINGTON
ELMS, WASHINGTON STREET, WE HAVE WASHINGTON AVENUE. THIS MAN
OWNED SLAVES, WE CAN HAVE FOUR OR FIVE FACILITIES NAMED AFTER A
SLAVE OWNER, WE CAN HAVE THIS BUILDING PERHAPS WITH THE LIBRARY
SEES THE WAY THROUGH, SEES ITS WAY ON THIS, NAMED AFTER MS.
BALDWIN BECAUSE SHE DID EXTRAORDINARY WORK. IT SHOULD BE THE CASE
THAT THE LIBRARY FINDS FIT NOT TO DO THIS I WON'T STOP SEEKING A PLACE
OR INSTITUTION THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THIS. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: I WAS GLAD TO SEE THIS ON THE
AGENDA. I WAS GLAD TO SPONSOR THE ORIGINAL ORDER. I HAVE ONE--I
WAS CURIOUS, I DIDN'T ASSUME THIS NEEDED A LEGAL OPINION AT THE
BEGINNING, THE LIBRARY BOARD REQUESTED THE LEGAL OPINION.
>> CITY MANAGER: WHEN IT COMES TO NAMING BUILDINGS, I HAVE TO BE
HONEST, I WANT TO MAKE SURE WHOSE AUTHORITY IT WAS SO I ASKED THE
CITY SOLICITOR BEFORE A CREATE A COMMITTEE I KNOW WHOSE STANDING,
THE MANAGER, THE LIBRARY BOARD. IN THE PAST THERE WAS CONFUSION.
IT WAS ME TRYING TO SAY, IF WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS, LET'S GET IT
OUT FRONT ON EXACTLY THE STRUCTURE AND THAT'S WHY I DID IT, TO BE
HONEST.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THAT'S HELPFUL. I YIELD BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO
RENAME THE LIBRARY AND TO CREATE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURAL
CENTER. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE PROGRAMMING AND IF WE HAVE
THOUGHT MORE ABOUT THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF TALK IN THE COMMUNITY
ABOUT A MUSEUM OR CULTURAL CENTER OR SOMEPLACE WHERE AFRICAN
AMERICAN AND BLACK CULTURE CAN BE HOUSED AND CELEBRATED IN THE
CITY. WHETHER IT IS IN THIS BUILDING OR ANOTHER BUILDING, IS THERE
THOUGHTS OF WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF PROGRAMMING AND
THE SPACE THAT COULD BE UTILIZED FOR THAT. I KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO
THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO HAVE A STEEL BAND AND THERE WERE
CHALLENGES WITH BOTH STORING THE EQUIPMENT AND HAVING SPACE TO
PERFORM MUSIC. WHAT ARE WE THINKING ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
SETTING UP A CULTURAL CENTER IN THE LIBRARY OR SOMEWHERE ELSE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN I THINK IT IS BEYOND THE
SCOPE OF WHAT IS BEFORE US. I WANT TO MOVE THE MEETING ALONG. I
WILL LET -- I SAW YOU TRYING TO RESPOND, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. I WANT
TO KEEP IT TO THE ACTUAL MEMO.
>> THANK YOU. WITH THIS PROCESS, WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THE
RENAMING. THE LIBRARY BUILDING PROGRAM WILL BE STUDIED THROUGH
THAT PUBLIC PROCESS RELATED TO THE DISCUSSION LAST WEEK. THANKS.


PAGE 37

Jun 21, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I GUESS, AS PART OF THIS STUDY,
REALLY THINK ABOUT NOT JUST THE NAME, BUT WHAT IMPLICATIONS IT HAS
ON PROGRAMMING THE BUILDING. IF WE JUST NAME IT AN AFRICAN
AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER, BUT IT DOESN'T EMBODY THAT, THEN WE
HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED THE GOAL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DO NOT SEE ANYONE ELSE'S HANDS UP. SO, WE CAN
DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING THE MATTER ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON PLACING THE COMMUNICATION ON FILE: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 10.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 10).

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
#8
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 20-37,
regarding renaming the
Central Square Library

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ON THIS. I
WAS GLAD TO SEE THE MEMO FROM THE CITY MANAGER RELATED TO THIS
VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDS. THE $65 MILLION RELATED IS LAID OUT IN
THE MEMO FOR A RANGE OF USES. WHAT IS NOTED IN THE MEMO, THE CITY
COUNCIL HAD ASKED FOR A MEETING TO DISCUSS HOW IT IS THE FUNDS ARE
DEPLOYED. I WAS GLAD TO SEE AT THE END THE CITY MANAGER INDICATED
HE WOULD WORK WITH THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO
METE AND DISCUSS THE SPENDING. MY QUESTION IS WHETHER WE HAVE A
SENSE OF THE TIMING OF THE MEETING GOING FORWARD?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL TURN IT OVER TO DAVID AND MICHELLE. RIGHT
NOW, DAVID AND MICHELLE ARE TRYING TO FULLY GRASP THE
RAMIFICATIONS. I'M NOT SURE HOW QUICKLY IT WILL BE, BUT I KNOW THEY
HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL SAY, COUNCILLOR CARLONE DID REACH OUT
ABOUT -- THERE WAS A THOUGHT ABOUT A ROUND TABLE. I THINK WE'LL
HAVE A BUNCH OF MEETINGS ON THIS, WHICH WILL HAPPEN. AND I THE LET
DAVID TAKE IT FROM HERE.
>> YOU HAVE SAID IT BEST. WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH AND THEY PLAN TOP
SCHEDULE A MEETING TO HAVE A DETAILED CONVERSATION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THAT'S MY QUESTION. I'M GLAD TO
SEE THAT IS IN THE WORKS AND VERY GLAD TO SEE WE'LL HAVE THE FUNDS
AVAILABLE TO DEPLOY AS NEEDED ACROSS THE CITY.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DISCUSSION AS
WELL. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION. WILL THE MONEY
BE SPENT FROM HERE ON OUT WITHOUT FURTHER APPROPRIATION REQUEST
OR COME BEFORE THE COUNCIL EACH TIME YOU SPEND THIS PARTICULAR
MONEY?
>> DAVID: THE APPROPRIATION BEFORE YOU IS TO APPROPRIATE THE FULL
AMOUNT. WE HAVE RECEIVED A PORTION OF THE FUNDS ALREADY. AND
AGAIN, THERE ARE LISTED IN THE MEMO SEVERAL ITEMS THAT WE'RE STILL
REVIEWING AND DIGESTING AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY MEET THE
COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING GUIDANCE THAT IS RECENTLY ISSUED BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT, FOR


PAGE 38

Jun 21, 2021

EXAMPLE, ADDITIONAL TESTING HAS A COST THAT CLEARLY WE HAVE SOME
BILLS AND THAT WE WOULD CHARGE AGAINST THIS. AS I SAID, DRILL DOWN
WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEADS AND COME UP WITH DETAILED PLANS THAT
ADHERE TO THE COMPLIANCE IN THE REPORTING AND TO MAKE SURE
WHATEVER WE SPEND IS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES, YES, THE ANSWER IS THE
MONEY WOULD BE ABLE. AGAIN, I THINK WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES
OF EXPLORING HOW WE'D SPEND THIS MONEY AND CLEARLY THE MANAGER
HAS INDICATED THAT, THE CO-CHAIR OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WILL
SCHEDULE MEETINGS TO GET INPUT FROM THE COUNCIL TO LISTEN TO IDEAS
YOU HAVE AND SEE HOW THEY FIT WITHIN OUR ABILITY TO SPEND THE
FUNDS.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK DAVID SAID IT BEST. THIS IS AN UNUSUAL
SITUATION. WE HAVE $65 MILLION. WE NEED TO APPROPRIATE IT FOR SOME
ACCOUNTING REASON. WE KNOW THE COUNCIL HAS ISSUES AND CONCERNS
WHERE THE MONEY IS SPENT. RIGHTFULLY SO. ONCE WE GET TO THE
MEETINGS, WE CAN COME UP WITH A SYSTEM HOW WE'LL REPORT AND
DISCUSS. THIS IS NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM A PROCESS, ONCE WE
APPROPRIATE IT WE'LL SPEND MONEY. WE WANT THE COUNCIL
INVOLVEMENT. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE
JUST HOW IT WILL ALL WORK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT DOES
FEEL STRANGE TO ME. IT IS MORE A KIN TO FREE CASH. YOU COME TO US
AND SAY WE NEED $2 MILLION FOR THIS AND $3 MILLION FOR THAT. NOW IT
SEEMS LIKE WE ARE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON $65 MILLION TO BE SPENT
WITHOUT ANY REAL CONTROL OVER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW IT WILL BE
SPENT.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE TRIED TO PUT AS MUCH SPECIFIC IN THE LETTER TO
GIVE YOU IDEAS OF WHERE WE ARE GOING AND THAT'S WHY WE
COMMITTED -- TO GO TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. YOU ARE RIGHT, IN
TERMS OF THE $65 MILLION, THE AUTHORIZATION ONCE THE
APPROPRIATION COMES IS THE CITY'S AUTHORIZATION. IN ORDER TO ACCEPT
THE MONEY, START MOVING FORWARD, THIS IS THE WAY WE FELT WE HAD
TO DO IT. IT IS UNUSUAL SITUATION. I ASSURE YOU, WE PLAN TO WORK
CLOSELY WITH THE FINANCE CHAIRS AND THE COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE WE
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE OR AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TOGETHER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: NO OTHER WAY TO DO THIS? WOULD YOU
TREAT IT MORE LIKE FREE CASH OR HAVE SOME OTHER WAY TO DO THE
INDIVIDUAL APPROPRIATION?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LET ME JUMP IN HERE. I SEE WHERE COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN IS COMING FROM. ON THE SCHOOL SIDE WITH THE FUNDS, THE
FINANCE -- THEY HAVE USED OUR COMMITTEE PRIORITIES AND BUDGET
PRIORITIES TO SET UP A PLAN. THERE IS A TIMING TO IT AND THE SCHOOL
COMMITTEE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT. IT IS OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD. I
GUESS TO MAYBE MICHELLE AND DAVID, THE AMERICAN RESCUE ACT, IT IS A
LITTLE DIFFERENT.


PAGE 39

Jun 21, 2021

>> I WILL LET MICHELLE COMMENT. TO REMIND EVERYBODY, WE HAVE UNTIL
2024 TO INCUR THE EXPENSES AND WE HAVE UNTIL 2026 TO SPEND THE
FUNDS. THIS IS NOT GOING OUT THE DOOR NEXT WEEK. THIS IS GOING TO
BE -- THERE IS A REPORTING AND PROJECT PLANNING PROCESS THAT WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW TO MAKE SURE THAT -- AS WE MENTIONED IN
THE LETTER -- WHEN WE DO OUR QUARTERLY REPORTING AND INTERIM
REPORTING, BASICALLY THE IDEA IS WE MEET THE REGULATIONS AND THE
COMPLIANCE OF THE GRANT. AS THE MANAGER MENTIONED, THIS IS NOT
GOING OUT THE DOOR IN HUGE AND FAST SPURTS. I THINK WE HAVE A
GOOD GAME PLAN AND SOME THINGS THAT WERE LISTED, CLEARLY WE HAVE
BEEN LISTENING TO THE COUNCIL ABOUT THEIR PRIORITY AREAS AND WE
HAVE INCLUDED THEM IN THE LISTING. WE JUST GOT MORE DETAIL
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS NEEDS TO BE REPORTED AND HOW IT
NEEDS TO BE RECONCILED IN TERMS OF REGULATION. WE'RE JUST
BEGINNING AND TO GET THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SPEND, WE NEED TO BE
APPROPRIATED.
I THINK THAT IS OUR TYPICAL PROCESS. IT IS REALLY NOT A FREE-CASH
ENVIRONMENT. IT IS A GRANT TO THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE THAT THE CITY
COUNCIL ROUTINELY APPROVES. KNOWING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING
PROVIDED TO THE CITY AND SOME OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE COUNCIL, WE
CLEARLY PLAN TO PARTNER WITH THE COUNSELS TO SOLICIT THEIR FEEDBACK
AND DO THE ANALYSIS WHETHER THINGS CAN OR CAN'T BE DONE. AS THE
MANAGER MENTIONED, IF WE DON'T DO THAT DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS AND
WE SPEND FUNDS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE REJECTED BY THE FEDS, WE'LL BE
BACK TO YOU FOR THE APPROPRIATION TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. WE'LL
BE PRUDENT AND THOUGHTFUL AND THERE IS A LEVEL OF TIMING HERE THAT
IS FAIRLY LONG. AGAIN, WE'RE NOT SPENDING $65 MILLION NEXT WEEK, I
ASSURE YOU THAT.
>> CITY MANAGER: IT IS DIFFERENT, BUT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WITH
THE COVID RELIEF FUND. WE DETERMINE ELIGIBLE EXPENSE. WE HAD THE
APPROPRIATION AND ALLOW US TO CHARGE THE EXPENSES AND WE HAD A
CATEGORY EXPENSE THAT WE PUT IN. MICHELLE HAS TO BE CAREFUL IN
WHAT TERMS OF EXPENSES ARE ELIGIBLE AND SHE HAS PLAYED AN
INCREDIBLE ROLE. IF YOU MAKE AN EXPENDITURE, IT IS DETERMINED NOT
ELIGIBLE, THAT'S A PROBLEM. WE ARE NOT GOT INTO FULL SPECIFICS
BECAUSE WE WANT MICHELLE TO HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS
ELIGIBLE. IF WE DETERMINE SOMETHING IS AND IT IS NOT, WE HAVE A BIT OF
A PROBLEM. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MICHELLE, WHO HAS SPENT TIME
GETTING INTO THE SPECIFICS HERE.
>> MICHELLE: THIS GRANT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COVID RELIEF FUND
GRANT. THE COVID RELIEF FUND GRANT WAS BASED -- WE WERE GIVEN THE
FUNDS IN A DIRE EMERGENCY. WE WERE GIVEN THE FUNDS AND WE WERE
TOLD WHAT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
FOR THIS, WE ARE IN A RECOVERY PERIOD. THE WAY THEY LAID THIS FEDERAL
GRANT OUT, WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN. WE NEED TO GO THROUGH AND
TWO MAIN COMPONENTS WOULD BE TWO INCLUDE -- TO INCLUDE


PAGE 40

Jun 21, 2021

EXPENDITURES WITHIN THE GUIDANCE. AND THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT BEEN
FULLY DECIDED YET BECAUSE IT IS STILL OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT UNTIL
JULY 16, 2021.
THEY HAVE GIVEN US SOME REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE TYPE OF
INFORMATION. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE REPORTING FOR THE CARES GRANT
COMPARED TO THIS ONE IS THAT WE HAVE TO REPORT ON PROGRAM AND
PERFORMANCE REPORTING. IF WE DECIDE THAT WE WILL USE MONEY FOR
CERTAIN PROGRAM, WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT THE MONEY IS
ACTUALLY DOING ITS JOB.
THAT'S WHY IT IS GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME, TAKE TIME TO SIT WITH EACH
DEPARTMENT. GO THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT WE HAVE OUT
THERE AND VET THEM AND ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A PROGRAM FOR EACH
ONE OF THE PROJECTS. THEY HAVE TO BE REPORTED BY PROJECT. THEY HAVE
TO BE REPORTED BASED ON, NOT ONLY WHAT WE SPENT, BUT ALSO ON THE
PERFORMANCE GOALS. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE. IT IS SIMILAR TO THE GRANT
BACK IN 2011. I KNOW -- YOU PROBABLY... THAT WAS A GRANT GIVEN FOR -TO BOOST UP THE ECONOMY. IT TOOK A GOOD FOUR OR FIVE YEARS TO
REPORT ON AND SPEND. WE WERE ALWAYS REPORTING THROUGH THE
PORTAL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT WE WERE SPENDING AND
WHAT THE PROGRAMS WERE.
IT IS HIGHLY REGULATED. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE
DEPARTMENTS AND WITH THE COUNCIL ON COMING UP WITH SOME
EXPENDITURES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL, THE TIMELINE
PIECE IN THIS OF WHEN WE HAVE TO USE THEM BY. AND THE YEARS -- I'M
GLAD ABOUT THE EXPLANATION. AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT THE
FINANCE COMMITTEE WILL SCHEDULE MEETINGS AS IT SAYS IN THIS, TO
DISCUSS WITH THE CITY COUNCIL SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT COULD BE
FUNDED THROUGH THIS -- THROUGH THESE MONIES.
>> THIS IS A GRANT AND NO DIFFERENT THAN OTHER GRANTS THAT THE
COUNCIL APPROPRIATES. I THINK THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS WE UNDERSTAND
THE COUNCIL WOULD LIKE INPUT AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IDEAS VETTED
AND CLEARLY I THINK THE MANAGER AGREED TO DO THAT. THIS REALLY IS
SORT OF LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT NOT REALLY. THE DIFFERENCE IS WE HAVE
$65 MILLION WE NEED TO SPENT THOUGHTFULLY AND LEGALLY AND IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS. I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
GOOD IDEAS, BUT WE NEED TO VET THEM ALL. AGAIN, THIS IS A COURSE OF
ACTION WHAT WE NORMALLY DO, WHICH IS APPROPRIATE GRANT FUNDS
AND IN THIS CASE THE ACTUAL SPENDING THE BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WANT TO ADD BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. AS
WE DID WITH THE MONEY WE RECEIVED EARLIER, IT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT
DEAL OF MONEY AND IT WAS. ONCE WE PUT ALL OUR EXPENSES THAT WE
ALREADY MADE, THAT MONEY WENT QUICKLY. THIS IS A DISCUSSION, $65
MILLION, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE ITEMS IN THE EMAIL ALONE, IT CAN GO
RELATIVELY QUICKLY. THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION TO


PAGE 41

Jun 21, 2021

MAKE SURE -- WE'LL HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO
EVERYTHING, DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT IS A WELL-APPRECIATED $65
MILLION, BASED ON THE NEEDS, IT COULD GO PRETTY QUICKLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN ONCE MORE AND
COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE REPORTING
AND THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES. I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER
GRANTS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS A MULTI-YEAR EXPENDITURE, IT SOUNDS
LIKE. IT FEELS VERY STRANGE TO ME THAT WE'D APPROPRIATE THE FULL
AMOUNT TONIGHT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNCIL
AND DIFFERENT CITY MANAGER YEAR AND HALF OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW
MAKING EXPENDITURES THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY DECIDE ON OR AGREE
ON AHEAD OF TIME.
I'M QUESTIONING THAT PROCESS A LITTLE BIT. IT DOES FEEL TO ME
CONCEPTUALLY -- I UNDERSTAND LEGALLY IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FREE
CASH. CONCEPTUALLY, IT SEEMS TO ME IT SHOULD BE TREATED IN A SIMILAR
WAY, IT IS SITTING THERE, BUT TO SPEND IT ON ANYTHING THE COUNCIL
SHOULD HAVE A VOTE TO DECIDE YES WE WANT TO SPEND IT ON THIS OR NO
WE DON'T. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE RIGHT PROCEDURE IS TO HAVE THAT
DISCUSSION, WHETHER WE NEED TO TABLE THIS OR CHARTER RIGHT IT. I
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THE
MECHANICS OF THAT COULD WORK. IT DOES FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO ME
THAT WE'D VOTE SPENDING ON THIS $65 MILLION. I GET WE'LL HAVE
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT, BUT IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE WE'LL HAVE
FURTHER VOTES.
>> IN TERMS OF NUANCES HERE, YOU ARE NOT REALLY VOTING TO SPEND
THE MONEY. YOU ARE VOTING TO APPROPRIATE SO THE FUNDS ARE
AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT. I THINK WE HAVE JUST -- THIS IS NOW EVERY DAY
WE GOTTEN GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO BOOK
THIS ON THE BOOKS. WE HAVE GOTTEN GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDS IN THE
LAST DAY OR TWO. THERE ARE WEBINARS WE ATTEND. I DO THINK -- I
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID, AGAIN, I THINK THE MANAGER MADE A
COMMITMENT, ONCE IT IS APPROPRIATED AND ON THE BOOKS, HOW IT GETS
SPENT AND ON WHAT TOPICS IS A CONVERSATION WITH THE COUNCIL. I
THINK COUNCILLOR CARLONE MAY HAVE MORE THINGS TO ADD WITH THAT,
AS WELL AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, THE CO-CHAIRS OF THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL JUMP IN, I CAN UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONS. WE
HAD THEM WHEN WE HAD THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THIS IS UNUSUAL.
BASED ON THE ADVICE OF DAVID AND MICHELLE AND THE FINANCIAL, HOW
THIS WILL WORK, THEY FELT THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO GO. THAT'S ONE
REASON WE SPECIFICALLY WANT TO PUT IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND
WORK WITH THE COUNCIL. YOU ARE RIGHT, WE ARE DOING THIS
DIFFERENTLY. BASED ON THE GUIDELINES WE GET, THIS IS THE WAY IT SEEMS


PAGE 42

Jun 21, 2021

LIKE IT HAS TO WORK. I CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE, COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS, AND THEN VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I'M SURE MY CO-CHAIR WILL HAVE
SOME GOOD COMMENTS AS WELL. WE DID TALK TO STAFF TODAY ABOUT
THIS PROCESS AND WE RAISED SIMILAR QUESTIONS. I THINK THE LAST
COMMENT THIS IS NOT $65 MILLION THAT THE STAFF CAN DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT WITH IT. WE WILL BE DISCUSSING ALL OF THIS IN GREAT DETAIL.
I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL, MR. MANAGER, IF ON A MONTHLY BASIS, IF
NOT MORE FREQUENTLY, AS YOU LEARN, YOU, DAVID, AND MICHELLE, WHAT
CAN BE FUNDED, WHAT CAN'T BE FUNDED, THE ACTUAL PROCESS, IF WE CAN
HAVE UPDATES -- EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A FINANCE MEETING THAT
MONTH, SO IT MIGHT INDICATE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A FINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING. I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL SO THAT
WE'RE ALWAYS IN THE LOOP AS FAR AS WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED AND
WHAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON, RESTRICT WHERE WE SPEND FUNDS, WHAT IS
ELIGIBLE, WHAT ISN'T. I THINK WE EACH HAVE IDEAS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT
COVID RELATED THAT ARE NOT ON THE LIST SO FAR, UNDERSERVED
NEIGHBORHOODS COULD CERTAINLY UTILIZE.
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU WOULD AGREE TO UPDATE US AS YOU LEARN
ALONG THE WAY WITH THE SIMPLE MEMO. THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK THAT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION. WE ARE LEARNING
THIS AS WELL. AS WE LEARN THINGS, WE CERTAINLY WANT THE COUNCIL TO
KNOW WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS. WE'D BE HAPPY TO SEND EMAILS,
THOUGHTS AND ONCE WE FEEL LIKE WE REACH A POINT WHERE WE NEED TO
HAVE ANOTHER FINANCE MEETING TO DISCUSS IN DETAIL, WE'LL BE HAPPY
TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRS TO SAY THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. IF THE
CHAIRS THINK IT NEEDS TO BE EARLIER, WE'LL HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND DO
IT EARLIER.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I'M DONE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. TO MY CO-CHAIR, THANK YOU FOR
MAKING THE POINTS. HE HIT ON MOST POINTS I WAS GOING TO MAKE. THE
ONLY THING TO ADD, AS WE HAVE THE MEETINGS, AS THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE, WE'LL TRY TO MAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEM IN
THE EVENING SO IT IS PUBLIC-FACING. THERE'S MISINFORMATION AROUND
THIS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO, WE'LL HAVE AS MANY -- TRY TO MAKE AS
MANY OPPORTUNITIES AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK WITHOUT ENGAGING
MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT WHEN AND HOW TO HAVE THE PUBLIC-FACING
CONVERSATIONS SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS IS $65 MILLION THAT IN SO
MANY WAYS MAY BE ALREADY SPOKEN FOR BECAUSE, AS YOU SAID MR. CITY
MANAGER, THERE IS MONEY THAT WE HAVE SPENT WELL, BUT WOULD BE
IMPORTANT TO BE REPLENISHED FOR THE BOND RATING AND A NUMBER OF
OTHER THINGS AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE ROAD


PAGE 43

Jun 21, 2021

THAT NOW WITH DISABILITY -- TO BE REPLENISHED WILL MAKE THE ABILITY
TO HAVE THOSE PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD. I DON'T
WANT ANYBODY TO THINK THAT THE COUNCIL -- I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO
THINK THIS IS MONEY WHERE WE GO OUT AND SPEND WITH A WISH LIST AND
PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT ON THE TABLE. AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO
REPORT OUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOME SOUTH OF PUBLIC-FACING PROCESS
THROUGH THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OR SOME OTHER FORM AND I'LL TALK
TO MY CO-CHAIR ABOUT THAT TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC IS ENGAGED AND
IT IS IMPORTANT THROUGH THE PROCESSES THAT WE INFORM THE
COMMUNITY -- TO USE THE WORDS, MR. KALE, WE HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL
ABOUT HOW THE MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT, AND HAS TO BE LEGAL AND IN
COMPLIANCE. THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS
GET THE SUBTLE NUANCES. I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING THIS ON AND
WORKING WITH MY CO-CHAIR. I'M GLAD THIS IS COMING OUR WAY. IT IS AN
IMPORTANT PROCESS THAT IS COMING BEFORE US. I WILL YIELD. THANK
YOU.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: (ECHO).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT WAS ME. SORRY.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE BEING CONTEMPLATED. IN THE MEMO FROM THE
CITY MANAGER AND THE STAFF, BUT I DO HEAR SOME OF THE CONCERNS BY
MY COLLEAGUE THAT -- I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL
CONVERSATION WITH THE COUNCIL AND THE MANAGER'S OFFICE SOONER
THAN LATER. I THINKS THERE A LOT OF ANXIETY AROUND THIS MONEY HOW
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT AND WHAT WE'LL SPEND IT ON. I THINK IT WAS
SAID EARLIER, SOME OF THE MONEY IS ALREADY GONE. IT WOULD BE
HELPFUL TO HAVE INITIAL CONVERSATION ABOUT SAYING IT IS NOT $65
MILLION IT IS $40 MILLION. HAVING A BASELINE CONVERSATION, MAYBE IN
THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE WE REALLY -- JUST TO HAVE A QUICK
CONVERSATION WITH THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. AND REALLY DECIDE ON
THE BROAD STROKES WHERE THE COUNCIL WANTS TO DIRECT SOME OF THE
EFFORT AND ENERGY. WE HAVE TALKED IN THIS COUNCIL SO MUCH ABOUT
EQUITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE AND BROADBAND. I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY
GOOD TO HAVE THAT INITIAL BROAD-BASED CONVERSATION WITH THE
MANAGER'S OFFICE AND WITH THE COUNCIL.
>> CITY MANAGER: I DON'T WANT TO PROMISE IN TWO WEEKS. I WANT TO
MAKE SURE THEY ARE READY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. TRUST ME, AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE WE'LL WORK AND SET IT UP. IT WON'T BE LONG -- TOO
LONG. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE TO HAVE A GOOD
DISCUSSION.
>> AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE NOT COMMITTED ANYTHING. THE ONLY THING
I'D SAY, HONESTLY, WE WILL HAVE SOME TESTING BILLS THAT WE KNOW ARE
CLEARLY OKAY. IF WE CAN'T USE OUR CARES FUND, THIS MAY BE A FUNDING.
IT WILL BE A SMALL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T
COMMITTED OR SPENT ANYTHING. MAYBE INVOICES FOR THINGS THAT ARE
CLEARLY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE GRANT THAT IS NO QUESTIONS.

PAGE 44

Jun 21, 2021

THOSE ARE SMALL DOLLARS AND ONLY IF WE CAN'T USE OUR CARES FUNDING
TO DID THAT. WE ARE STARTING FROM THE POSITION, THESE ARE THINGS
THE STAFF THOUGHT OF AND IN SOME CASES WITH SOME COUNCIL
PRIORITIES IN MIND, I THINK THAT IS WHY WE LIST THEM. THEY NEED TO BE
FLUSHED OUT AND AS MICHELLE SAIL, WE HAVE GOT OUR GUIDANCE. NOW,
WE CAN REALLY ONCE WE DIGEST THE SEVERAL PAGES OF GUIDANCE ON TOP
OF 150 PAGES OF GUIDANCE, WE CAN SAY CLEARLY THIS IDEA -- WE CAN
REPORT, WE CAN JUSTIFY, WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE SO WHEN
WE SUBMIT AN EXPENDITURE REPORT, IT WON'T BE REJECTED. AGAIN, I
THINK CLEARLY AS COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID,
CLEARLY, GETTING IDEAS FROM THE COUNCIL. THIS WASN'T MEANT TO BE
THE ONLY THINGS WE'LL CONSIDER. WE CLEARLY KNOW YOU HAVE IDEAS
AND THAT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM AND WE CAN GET THE IDEAS
VETTED IN A WAY TO HAVE AN ANSWER OF YES AND NO. WE CAN TAKE THE
TIME TO DO IT. AGAIN, AS I SAID, THIS ISN'T SPENDING THE MONEY, THIS IS
JUST GETTING THE MONEY ON THE BOOKS SO WE CAN RECEIVE THE
REVENUES AND BASICALLY IT IS AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT ONCE IDEAS ARE
VETTED AND READY TO GO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE-MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE
WAY IT IS BEING PRESENTED TO US IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATING THE
FUNDING. I THINK WHAT YOU JUST SAID, MR. KALE, THERE'S SMALL DOLLARS
IN TESTING, IF IT IS NOT PAID FOR BY CARES ACT MONEY, THAT'S THE BULK OF
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT HERE. THE COUNCIL AND THE RESIDENTS DON'T
KNOW WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT $20 MILLION. IF IT IS A PRELIMINARY
CONVERSATION TO GET FACTS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND TO US, I
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SO MANY
THINGS ON THIS LIST, I THINK IT SPEAKS TO A LOT OF THE COUNCIL PRIORITY.
AS SOME OF THE OTHER COUNCILLORS HAVE MENTIONED, WE SHOULD HAVE
A BROAD-STROKE CONVERSATION AND MAKE SURE WE DON'T LEAVE OUT
SOMETHING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I WOULD -- I KNOW IN A WEEK AND
HALF, IT WILL BECOME SUMMERTIME AND VERY DIFFICULT TO PULL
TOGETHER A MEETING AND MAYBE WITH ZOOM IT MAY BE EASIER. I THINK
PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR FAMILY THIS SUMMER.
GETTING SOME ON THE BOOKS SOONER THAN LATER WOULD BE
PREFERABLE. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. LOOKING AT THE MEMO THAT THE
CITY MANAGER SENT TO US, IN TERMS OF THIS APPROPRIATION THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE RECEIVING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, ABOUT $61
MILLION, IT IS REALLY FANTASTIC. RECEIVING THIS AND I KNOW SOME
PEOPLE WANT US TO SPEND THIS IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS CRITERIA THAT
HAS TO BE FOLLOWED. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DAUNTING TASK. AS IT IS LAID
OUT IN THE MEMO, THE LIST OF THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT
COULD BE EXPLORED IN -- I LOOK AT THIS AS 29 ELIGIBLE PROJECTS, BUT
THAT'S NOT LIMITED TO THE 29. CATEGORY OF PUBLIC HEALTH, FREE


PAGE 45

Jun 21, 2021

TRANSPORTATION ACCESS, UPGRADE PLAYGROUNDS, JOB TRAINING,
SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS, GRANTS FOR TOURISM, OUTDOOR DINING,
STOREFRONTS, PUBLIC PATIOS, NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, EXPANSION OF
FOOD DELIVERY FOR RESIDENTS. RENT AND MORTGAGE SUPPORT.
BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. DIGITAL EQUITY. IN FRONT OF US NOW IS
AROUND 30 POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. EACH ONE OF THESE ON THE LIST
HAS THEIR OWN CONSTITUENCY THAT WILL BE VERY ACTIVE IN ADVOCATING
FOR THEIR PROJECT. THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK FOR THE COUNCIL AND THE
CITY ADMINISTRATION.
THE FINANCE COMMITTEE, I BELIEVE THE TWO CO-CHAIRS HAVE DONE A
GREAT JOB AND HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT ON THIS. WE HAVE AN ACTIVE
CONSTITUENCY, THE PUBLIC, ALL THE THINGS LAID OUT. $61 MAY SEEM A
LOT. IF YOU GIVE JUST THE 29 THAT ARE LISTED, NEVER MIND THE OTHER
ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT WILL COME BEFORE US FROM OTHER DIFFERENT
CONSTITUENCY, IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US. I THINK WE
DO -- AS THE CITY MANAGER AND THE CO-CHAIR OF THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE SAID, WE HAVE TO TREAD SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AS WE
PROCEED ON THIS. EVERY ONE OF THE 29 IN FRONT OF ME, I WOULD FUND
IMMEDIATELY TOMORROW. LIKE I SAID, TO THE CO-CHAIR OF THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE AND I ANTICIPATE A LOT OF FINANCE COMMITTEE MEETINGS
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. CLEARLY, THE RESIDENTS NEED A LOT
OF THE FUNDING AND WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS IN A TIMELY MANNER, BUT
ALSO IN A WELL THOUGHT OUT WAY AND MAKE SURE WE ARE COMPLYING
WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY NOT FORMULATED. HOW AND
WHERE WE CAN SPEND THE MONEY. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH
MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS. YOU LOOK AT EVERY ONE OF THESE ELIGIBLE
PROJECTS AND THEY ARE ALL INCREDIBLE THINGS WE SHOULD DO. EARLY
CHILDCARE, PRE-K PROGRAMS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YOU GOT MY POINT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ON THIS?
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, I SEE YOUR HAND. WE HAVE TO MOVE ALONG. IF
THERE IS A QUICK QUESTION, GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I HAVE HEARD THE COMMENTS AND I
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. I FEEL LIKE MAYBE I DIDN'T GET MY POINT
ACROSS, THE DISCUSSION IS FINE. IT DOESN'T GIVE US A VOTE ON HOW THE
MONEY IS SPENT. THAT VOTE APPARENTLY IS HAPPENING TONIGHT. I'M
GOING TO EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT AND HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION
ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VOTE ON THIS MONEY IS
SPENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN EXERCISED HIS CHARTER
RIGHT. MOVING TO THE CALENDAR.

TONIGHT. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR WITH THE LIVE ACOUSTIC ENTERTAINMENT
ORDINANCE.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO
VICE-MAYOR MALLON FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS AND COUNCILLOR
CARLONE AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN FOR CO-SPONSORING IT. I'M GLAD
THIS IS UP FOR ORDINATION AS THEY HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE, MUSICIANS
AND RESTAURANTS IN CAMBRIDGE ARE IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND
THIS IS A SMALL WAY TO SUPPORT THEM. ALLOW BUSINESSES TO HAVE
ACOUSTIC PERFORMANCE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF
OBTAINING A LICENSE FIRST. WE WOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF BOSTON,
WHERE THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED A SIMILAR ORDINANCE IN 2016 AND BEEN
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THERE FOR FIVE YEARS. AND WHILE IT DOES
MAKE IT EASIER FOR ARTISTS -- IT TAKES OUT RED TAPE AND IT DOES HAVE
REGULATIONS AND PERFORMANCES FROM 10-10 P.M. NO MORE THAN FIVE
PERFORMERS AND ONE MICROPHONE ALLOWED. I'M HAPPY TO ALLOW
OTHERS TO SPEAK ON THIS. ONE SMALL AMENDMENT TONIGHT, YOU CAN
SEE ON THE VERSION ONLINE OR IN THE PACKET. IT IS A PLACE HOLDER FOR
THE ORDINANCE NUMBER. I WILL ASK THE CLERK -- NUMBER FOR THE
MUNICIPAL CODE. THE COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED IT AND I'M HAPPY
TO GO TO THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THE AMENDMENT AND ORDINATION.
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE THAT AMENDMENT FOR THE NUMBERING.

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. IT DOES SEEM TO BE A LITTLE
UNUSUAL OF A COMMUNICATION. THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE UNHOUSED
COMMUNITY, WHO WAS REPORTING AN INCIDENT THEY REPORTED TO THE
POLICE ABOUT AN ALLEGED PROPERTY THEFT. IT HAS A HANDWRITTEN NOTE,
BUT IT WASN'T READABLE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS PART OF THE

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL PULL 4. I WAS GOING TO BE ADDED TO THIS.
WE'LL PULL ALL OF THEM. GOING TO NUMBER ONE. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 1).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE
FOR CO-SPONSORING THIS ORDER. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS BACK AND
FORTH FOR A WHILE. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME ON
THE -- HAVING CELEBRATED JUNETEENTH, CAMBRIDGE CHOSE IT AS A
HOLIDAY. AND JUST RECENTLY MADE A FEDERAL HOLIDAY, SO THIS IS AN
APPROPRIATE POLICY ORDER TO BRING FORWARD AND I HOPE MY COUNCIL
MEMBERS WILL STAND BEHIND AND SUPPORT. I THINK IT IS QUITE
SELF-EXPLANATORY WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO
CONSIDER THIS. IT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT THE COMMUNITY OF COLOR,
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY, HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY IMPACTED BY THE
WAR ON DRUGS, PARTICULARLY THE WAR ON DRUGS IN RESPECT TO
MARIJUANA. THAT HAS NOT STOPPED. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR
THAT DAMAGE, TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DAMAGE, AND TO MAKE A WAY
FOR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY TO HEAL AND REPAIR THEMSELVES
AND HAVE AS A COMMUNITY COME FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT
THE COMMITTEE WOULD SUPPORT THIS ORDER, BUT AND IN ADDITION, THE
YOUNG MAN THAT SPOKE, MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY POINT ABOUT HAVING
THIS BE A PUBLIC-FACING PROCESS. IF THIS IS ADOPTED, MYSELF, WITH THE
CITY MANAGER, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND ANY OTHER COLLEAGUE, WE'LL
MAKE SURE WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE THE COMMUNITY IS ENGAGED IN
THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER A REPARATIONS PROGRAM. I YIELD THE
FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND
NECESSARY CONVERSATION. AND IT IS PASS TIME TO DISCUSS REPARATIONS
AND I HOPE CAMBRIDGE CAN BE A LEADER AMONG THE MUNICIPALITIES


PAGE 49

Jun 21, 2021

THAT TAKE LOCAL ACTION. A COUPLE OF THINGS. SO MUCH LAID OUT IN THE
POLICY ORDER. THE SCALE AND MAGNITUDE, WE RECOGNIZE CAN ONLY BE
ACHIEVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS
ON A NATIONAL SCALE. NO LOCAL OR -- FOR FULL RESTITUTION FOR SLAVERY
AND THE -- THAT IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO TAKE ACTION. OTHER LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS STARTED THE CONVERSATION AND HAVE -- (AUDIO
BREAKUP). WE CAN SHOW WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND NECESSARY. AS WE
HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENT, CAMBRIDGE HAS THE LEGACY OF BENEFITTING
FROM SLAVERY, ANYONE WHO VISITED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN -- IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. UNDERSTANDS THAT SO MUCH OF MASSACHUSETTS AS A
STATE, THE ECONOMY DEPENDED ON THE LABOR OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND
RIGHT THROUGH ADHERING TO FEDERAL POLICIES IN THE 1950S THAT
BARRED BLACK RESIDENTS FROM -- (AUDIO BREAKUP).
I SEE THIS POLICY ORDER AS A FIRST STEP AND AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
INDICATED, WE'LL INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS WILL BE A
LARGER CONVERSATION AND I HOPE WE CAN SUPPORT THIS AND BE A
LEADER IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU AND I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I CERTAINLY SUPPORT
REPARATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THIS ORDER COMING BEFORE US. AS WE
HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENT, THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME CONCERNS AND
SOME WAYS CO-MINGLING OF REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY AND RESTITUTION
FOR THE WAR ON DRUGS. OF COURSE, THE NEED TO HAVE A REAL PUBLIC
PROCESS AND A REAL COMMUNITY CONVERSATION.
SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM VICE-MAYOR MALLON, I WILL EXERCISE MY
CHARTER RIGHT AFTER THAT TO HAVE SOME MORE DISCUSSION WITH THE
MOTION-MAKERS ABOUT THIS ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: SINCE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN EXERCISED HIS
CHARTER RIGHT, I WILL YIELD BACK AND I WILL HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION
WHEN THIS COMES BACK NEXT WEEK.
>> WE GO TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER TWO. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 2).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M VERY EXCITED TO HAVE A HOME RULE PETITION
IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT AFTER MANY DISCUSSIONS AND HEARINGS ON THE
TOPIC OF CHARTER REVIEW AND REFORM. THE POLICY ORDER LAYS OUT, WE
HAD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS ON THE TOPIC, THIS PROCESS STARTED MORE
THAN A YEAR AGO WHEN WE STARTED TO TALK TO THE COLLINS CENTER
ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW WE MAY CHANGE THE OTHER CHARTER -- IT
LAYS OUT THE MEETINGS WERE HAD BEFORE THE POINT, INCLUDING THE
MEMOS WITH THE COLLINS CENTER, THEY WERE PRODUCED AFTER
INTERVIEWING EACH MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL, BUILT ON THE CHARTER
REVIEW AND THE RESEARCH ON THE POSSIBILITIES FOR CHARTER REVIEW
AND REFORM -- (AUDIO BREAKUP).

MANY CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE COMMONWEALTH. AND ALL OF WHICH
ARE LAID OUT IN THE MEMOS. THE CHANGES ARE NOT MAJOR ONES, THEY
ARE IMPORTANT. EACH ASPECT OF THE HOME RULE, REGULAR CHARTER
REVIEW... CITY MANAGER REVIEW PROCESS, AND COUNCIL CONFIRMATION
OF BOARDS, COMMISSIONS AND APPOINTMENTS IS INCLUDED IN CHARTERS
IN THE STATE. IF WE PASS THIS TONIGHT, AND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES,
IT WILL BE EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PROCESS SINCE THE CHANGES WOULD BE UP TO
THE VOTERS AND WOULD BE ON THE BALLOT. THIS WOULD BE THE START OF
THAT PROCESS AND JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE
GET IT TO THE LEGISLATURE RELATIVELY SOON IF WE WANT TO BE PASSED IN
TIME FOR US TO HAVE THE PREPARATION NECESSARY FOR A FULL PUBLIC
PROCESS AND ALSO FOR THIS TO APPEAR ON THE BALLOT. THANK YOU FOR
CO-SPONSORING THIS AND WORKING SO CLOSELY AND FOR A LONG TIME

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY EXERCISED THE CHARTER RIGHT.
GOING TO POLICY ORDER THREE. (READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER THREE).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS POLICY ORDER STEMS FROM A
REPORT FROM THE TOBIN SCHOOL RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT. IT SHOWS
HOW MANY OF THE TREES WILL BE TAKEN DOWN DURING CONSTRUCTION.
WE KNOW THAT HAS TO HAPPEN DURING CONSTRUCTION, AND
UNFORTUNATE AND SOMETHING WE LIVE WITH. OF THE 129 EXISTING
TREES, 94 ARE SLATED TO BE REMOVED. 73% OF ALL THE CURRENT TREES.
THERE IS A PLAN TO PLANT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT
TREES UNDER THE ORDINANCE, WE KNOW FROM THE NUMEROUS
DISCUSSIONS THAT REPLACING LARGE TREES WITH THE NUMBER OF SMALLER
NEW ONES WILL NOT COME CLOSE FOR DECADES TO MAKE UP THE CLIMATE
RESILIENCY, HEAT ISLAND, AND AIR POLLUTION MITIGATION EFFECT. THIS
POLICY ORDER IS CONFERENCING THREE OF THE LARGEST TREES. THE THREE
THAT ARE SLATED TO COME DOWN BECAUSE THEY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE
NEW BUILDING FOOTPRINT AND PUT IN A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT TO PRESERVE
THEM NOW WILL HAVE MASSIVE IMPACT. WE BELIEVE THERE MAY BE A WAY
TO SAVE THE TREES. I WANT TO THANK DOUG BROWN, WHO LOOKED INTO
THIS, CALCULATED THAT JUST THE THREE OAKS MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY
25% OF THE CANOPY PROPOSE FOR REMOVAL. ONLY 3% OF THE TREE, 25%
OF THE CANOPY. THIS CITY WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THEM WITH 23 NEW
TWO-INCH TREES ON THE SITE AND TELL TAKE DECADES FOR THEM TO
PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF THE OLD. AND NO GUARANTEES THEY WILL
SURVIVE. AS THE FORMER VICE-MAYOR WROTE, THE STUDENTS ATTENDING
THE NEW SCHOOL WHICH WON'T OPEN UNTIL 2024, WILL BE PARENTS
THEMSELVES BEFORE THE TREES ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE
SIGNIFICANT SHADE. WITHOUT ALTERING THE PLANS, I THINK THEY CAN BE

SAVED AND IT IS IMPORTANT WE ASK FOR THE CURRENT PLAN TO BE
CONSIDERED. WE HAVE EMAILS FROM PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
ELSEWHERE URGING US TO PASS THIS AND I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL AND I
HOPE THE CITY, IF SO, WILL BE ABLE TO -- THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES
WHO BRING THIS FORWARD. I KNOW THEY ARE THOUGHTFUL IN AND
AROUND THIS ISSUE, BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN SUPPORT THIS. I NEED MORE
INFORMATION. I WILL EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER FOUR. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER FOUR). I PULLED IT TO ASK TO BE ADDED TO AS I
BRIEFLY TALKED TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT HAVING
YOU ON THE ORIGINAL ORDER. IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT ON OUR PART. YES,
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU CO-SPONSOR. I DID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH
THE CITY MANAGER ABOUT THIS. HE IS IN FAVOR OF THE WORDING. HE IS
FINE WITH THIS MOVING FORWARD AND AGREEABLE. AND WE'D LIKE TO GET
THIS IN THE PROCESS AND IN THE QUEUE TO GET THIS MOVING FORWARD SO
IT CAN HAPPEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RFP FOR THE LIBRARY AS WE
REMEMBER FROM LAST WEEK, THE MANAGER HAD SAID, THAT HE WANTED
THAT OTHER RFP TO GO FORWARD AND WAS OPEN TO A SECOND RFP IN
TANDEM, BUT FELT IT NEEDED TO BE A SEPARATE DISCUSSION OR SEPARATE
RFP. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN GET THIS PASSED
TONIGHT AND GET IT MOVING. YES, WE SHOULD AMEND TO ADD MAYOR
SIDDIQUI AS WELL.

POLICY ORDER #3
That the City Manager is
hereby requested to work with
the appropriate departments
and building contractors to
reconsider the current plan
which eliminates many trees
including large old growth trees
that are not part of the new
building footprint and
specifically do everything
possible to save the three Oak
trees on the west side of the
property and any other large
trees on the site

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WAS GOING TO SAY, OF COURSE, YES, WE WANT
YOU TO HAVE YOU JOIN US. WE KNOW HOW YOU SUPPORT THIS IDEA. IT IS
AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AS WE LOOK AT CENTRAL SQUARE. I HOPE
MY COLLEAGUES WILL STAND WITH US AND SUPPORT THIS POLICY ORDER TO
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS PARCEL OF THE BUILDING, ALL OF IT IN TOTAL.
THANK YOU. I YIELD.
