WITH THAT, ALL OF TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL BE ROLL CALL. WE'LL NOW OPEN
PUBLIC COMMENT. FIRST PERSON WHO SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IS
JUSTIN... ACTUALLY. CLERK, MY PUBLIC COMMENT KIND OF DISAPPEARED
ON ME. (PLEASE HOLD CAPTIONING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY)

>> I SUPPORT THE EXEMPTION OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY
PROJECTS FROM THE ORDINANCE. AS MANY OF US HAVE LEARNED OVER THE
COURSE OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, FINANCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS
COMPLEX, AND WHILE THE PROJECTS FREQUENTLY INCLUDE ROOF TOP
SOLAR AND COMPLY WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE ORDINANCE, THIS
REQUIREMENT MAY MAKE THE FINANCING MORE DIFFICULT, REDUCING THE
AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED IN LIGHT OF THE SKY
ROCKETING HOUSING COST. I SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT TO SATISFY THE
REQUIREMENT. WITH STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT FOR SOLAR POWER. THEY
WILL GENERATE SOLAR POWER AND HAVE MORE IMPACT THAN THE GREEN
ROOF. WE'LL ENCOURAGE UTILIZATION OF ROOF TOP SOLAR. THE

CLARIFICATION AROUND CALCULATING EXEMPTION AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
THAT WOULD CONFORM THE LANGUAGE TO THE INTENT OF THE SPONSORS,
SO I SUPPORT THAT CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, JUSTIN. JONATHAN BEHRENS.
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAS JOINED US.
>> MELISSA, GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. 30 BUENA VISTA PARK AND HERE TO SPEAK ON THE
SOLAR AMENDMENT THAT WAS PUT FORTH BY VICE MAYOR MALLON IN
TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE. I'M GOING
TO START OFF THIS WAY, FOR TWO MINUTES, MAYBE THREE, IMAGINE THAT
WE ARE ROOF TOP SOLAR PANELS. OKAY. WE ARE UP ON THE ROOF.
NOTHING BETWEEN US AND THE SUN. BELOW US IS THE ROOF. FROM IT THE
HEAT IS RISING, BOUNCING US TO SLAP US ON THE BACK SIDE WHILE THE SUN
ROASTS ON THE OTHER. A FEW THINGS HAPPEN. FIRST, WE ARE ADDING TO
THE CITY'S HEAT ISLAND AND FOR US, SOLAR PANELS, WE DON'T WORK ALL
THAT WELL. YOU KNOW WHY? OUR EFFICIENCY IS CRASHING. EVERY
DEGREE THE TEMPERATURE GOES OVER 77 DEGREES, OUR ABILITY TO
PRODUCE ENERGY IS GOING DOWN. IT MIGHT BE 90 DEGREES ON THE
SIDEWALK, WE'RE GUARANTEED TO EXPERIENCE MORE OF SUMMER
TEMPERATURES LIKE THAT, ON THE ROOF, WHERE WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE
DO BEST, IT CAN BE 100 DEGREES 120 DEGREES OR HOTTER. LIKE HUMAN
BEINGS, WE'LL SLOW DOWN. IN FACT, WE ARE GOING TO RUN ABOUT 10
25% LESS EFFICIENTLY ON DAYS THAT REACH 90 DEGREES OR HIGHER. AND
THE HOTTER THE AIR, THE LESS EFFICIENT WE'LL BE. 2030 WE PREDICT TO
HAVE MORE DAYS THAT ARE OVER 90 DEGREES, I BELIEVE, THEY ARE SAYING
THE CITY'S OWN ESTIMATE, THERE MAY BE UP TO 30 MORE DAYS OVER 90
DEGREES FROM WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WHAT WE HAVE NOW, WHICH IS 11.
AND BY 2070, THAT IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO QUADRUPLE. WE ARE
HEATING UP AND SO THE CURRENT WE PUT OUT IS INCREASING
EXPONENTIALLY. THE VOLTAGE, OUR EFFECTIVE WE'RE DOING OUR JOB, IT IS
REDUCED. SO WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING A SOLAR PANEL ALL ALONE ON THE
ROOF TOP? IT IS LONELY. LIKE HUMANS. WE WANT COMPANY. TO COOL US
WHEN WE GET HOT. SO, THE PARTNER THAT WE SWIPE RIGHT TO MEET, IT IS
VEGETATION. BY COOLING THE SURROUNDING AIR, SHE'LL HELP US PERFORM
THE BEST WE CAN. SHE'LL ALSO FILTER STORM WATER, ALSO REDUCE THE
DUST AND THE AIR POLLUTANTS FOUND ON THE ROOFS. THIS IS GOING TO
INCREASE AND IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE. IT WILL REDUCING OUR
UPKEEP. PLANTS FIT WITH US. SOLAR PANELS, LIKE A PESTLE FITS TO A
MORTAR. EACH OF US WANTS THE FIERCEST CLIMATE RESILIENCE WE CAN
BUILD AND THE MOST POWER POSSIBLE FROM THE RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
ENERGY. DO NOT PASS THIS SOLAR AMENDMENT. DOING SO PUSHES US
BACKWARDS AT A TIME WHEN OUR FORWARD VISION AND BOLD
DETERMINATION ARE WHAT WE NEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING BACK TO JONATHAN, FOLLOWED BY SAL.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. I WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDER EIGHT TO
GET A DEDICATED FUNDS FOR HIRING LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE COUNSEL.

PAGE 2

APRIL 12, 2021

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA. I ENCOURAGE BROADENING THE SCOPE THAT
CAN BE USED FOR. I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UPCOMING IN
THE NEXT TERM, NEGOTIATION FOR A NEW CITY MANAGER. HOPEFULLY,
THIS BUDGET CAN BE USED TOWARDS COUNSEL TO ADVISE ON THAT AND
ANYTHING RELATED TO THE CHARTER AS WELL.
AS FAR AS THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION, I ENCOURAGE THE I'M IN FAVOR OF
THE PETITION, BUT ONLY IF WE CAN GET THE EXEMPTION FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING AND ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF
HAVING SOLAR ROOFS. GETTING THAT AMENDMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO SAL.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO COMMENT ON CITY
MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 12. APPROPRIATION OF $25,000 GRANT
FROM THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION TO BE USED FOR THE
PURCHASE OF CHROMEBOOKS, HOTSPOTS, AND WEBCAMS. I WILL THANK
THE FOUNDATION FOR THE GIFT. AND NONE OF WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY
SHOULD BE TAKEN AS CRITICISM OF THEM. LAST WEEK'S AGENDA HAD AN
APPROPRIATION OF A THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION TO REPAIR CITY POOLS.
ON ITS FACE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE THE CONCLUSION THAT WHILE THE
CITY CONSIDERS AQUATIC RECREATION A CITY RESPONSIBILITY TO BE PAID
OUT OF CITY TAX RECEIPTS, IT THINKS DIGITAL EQUITY SHOULD BE LEFT TO
CHARITY. THE CITY TELLS YOU WHO IT IS, BELIEVE IT. IN GENERAL, THE CITY
HAS EARNED A PRESUMPTION OF NORMALITY FOR ALL THE AD HOC
FINANCIAL APPROPRIATIONS THAT OCCUR EVERY MONDAY NIGHT. DIGITAL
EQUITY, THE COUNCIL SHOULD ASK QUESTIONS.
THE CITY HAS FORFEITED THAT PRESUMPTION OF NORMALITY WHEN IT
INSTALLED WI FI FOR NEWTOWN COURT AND TWICE ABANDONED IT. IT
FORFEITED THAT PRESUMPTION OF NORMALITY WHEN FOR YEARS IT DENIED
THERE WAS A DIGITAL EQUITY PROBLEM UNTIL THE PANDEMIC LAID IT BEAR.
AND IT FORFEITED THE PRESUMPTION OF NORMALITY WHEN FOR THE PAST
TWO YEARS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR STATUS REPORTS ON THE SO
CALLED DIGITAL EQUITY STUDY AND YET TO BE DELIVERED TO THE COUNCIL
OR TO RESIDENTS.
THE COUNCIL SHOULD ASK EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUYING, WHETHER THIS IS A
ONE TIME PURCHASE, WHETHER THERE ARE THIS IS A LONG TERM
PURCHASE FOR STUDENTS, WHAT THE MAINTENANCE IS FOR THE ITEMS,
WHO PAYS THE OPERATIONAL COSTS, WHO IS PAYING FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION
FEES FOR THE WI FI HOTSPOTS. IT SHOULD ASK WHETHER IT IS ALIGNED WITH
THE CITY'S STRATEGY FOR DIGITAL EQUITY SHOULD ONE COME OUT OF THE
STUDY IT IS DOING. IT SHOULD ASK WHETHER THIS PURCHASE IS INCOMPASS
THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT'S EARLIER
PURCHASE OF THE ITEMS.
THIS IS NOT A BAD THING, BUT THE CITY SEEMS TO BE EXECUTING DIGITAL
EQUITY STRATEGY WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OR ANY DIRECTION DESPITE
HAVING YEARS TO STUDY AND COME UP WITH BETTER ANSWERS. THANK
YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP. WE'LL GO TO BILL... FOLLOWED BY CHRIS.
>> PARTICIPANT: MAYOR AND COUNCILLORS, I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR
OF POLICY ORDER 7. ONE THING THAT BETTERS ME, TENANTS THAT APPLY
FOR INCLUSIONARY ZONING HOUSING, THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO GO
THROUGH A CREDIT CHECK. AND TO ME, THAT'S LIKE ASKING AN AMPUTEE
WHO LOST AN ARM, YOU ARE OFFERING THEM AN ARTIFICIAL ARM, ONLY
AFTER THEY SHOW THEY CAN ROW A BOAT A HUNDRED YARDS. IT IS LIKE IT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. PLEASE PASS THAT.
SECOND, SPEAKING AS A GREEN ROOF ZONING PETITION, I LIKE GREEN ROOFS
AND I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH PUTTING THE COST BURDEN ON THE
BACKS OF THE ALREADY FINANCIALLY BURDENED NEIGHBORS, WHO ARE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING APPLICANTS. THE COST, IF IT IS BORNE BY THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS, ALL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE, IT WILL
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNITS AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.
PLEASE EXEMPT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FROM THIS. ALSO,
REMEMBER THAT ANY PROJECT BEING DONE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING OVERLAY, IT WON'T BE ABLE TO SEEK AN EXEMPTION WITHOUT
FORFEITING THE PROTECTION OF THE AHO PROVIDES AGAINST PRIVILEGE
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. THIRD, ON THE DIFFERENT NOTE, I'D LIKE THE
EXEMPTION FOR PARKING TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GREEN ROOFS
PETITION FOR IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE, AT LEAST TO INCLUDE SOLAR AS AN
OPTION. IT IS A FALSE EQUIVALENT TO SAY YOU CAN DO BOTH SOLAR AND A
GREEN ROOF. THAT WILL COST ROUGHLY TWICE AS MUCH. REASONABLE
EQUIVALENCE IS PARKING WITH SOLAR PANELS ABOVE. I'M NOT LOOKING
FORWARD TO SEEING HEADLINES THAT SAY, FOSSIL FUEL, YES. CLEAN
ENERGY, NO. IN CAMBRIDGE. PLEASE EITHER REMOVE THE PARKING OR ADD
SOLAR. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE WILL GO TO DIANE MARTIN. AND THEN
JOHN.
>> NEXT IS CHRISTOPHER. GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. 17 LAUREL STREET. I SUPPORT THE IDEAS
BEHIND THE GREEN ROOF PETITION. THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT
SEEM TO A LAYMAN'S READING TO BE CLEAR DRAFTING ISSUES. I KNOW THE
PETITIONER IS QUESTIONED ABOUT THEM AROUND MECHANICALS AND ROOF
AREA AND GREEN AREA. AND THE ANSWERS FRANKLY DON'T JIVE WITH THE
TEXT AS WRITTEN. I HOPE IT IS SOMETHING TO BE REVIEWED AND UPDATED,
SPECIFICALLY AROUND MECHANICALS. CALLING LARGE AIR CONDITIONERS
GREEN ROOF AREA SEEMS COUNTER TO THE INTENT. CALLING THEM WHEN
THEY ARE LESS THAN FOUR SQUARE FEET IN AREA DOESN'T MAKE MORE
SENSE TO ME. I'M SURE SMART PEOPLE ARE ON THIS, YOU READ AND KNOW
IT. IT SEEMS TO NEED MORE WORK. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THE I'M
WILLING TO BE CONVINCED THAT VEGETATION PLUS SOLAR IS A GOOD IDEA.
I THINK IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA, PRODUCES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PAYS
FOR ITSELF, AS HAPPENS, IT IS SOMETHING THAT DEVELOPERS WILL DO ONCE
THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO SOMETHING ON THE ROOF. YOU WILL HAVE
SOLAR AND GREEN MAKES MORE SENSE WITH IT, PEOPLE WILL BUILD IT. I

PAGE 4

APRIL 12, 2021

REALLY DO THINK WHEN PEOPLE BUILD ONLY SOLAR AND TELL YOU THEY
WILL BUILD ONLY THAT, THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS
A BETTER IDEA.
AS MUCH AS I MIGHT NOT BE A SOLAR PANEL, I ADMIT, I DO FEEL THAT
THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE EVIDENCE BASED DECISION MAKING HERE. NOT
BASED ON A COUPLE OF CLAIMS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF
THE PETITION OR AGAINST IT. ON THE ISSUE OF CREDIT CHECKS FOR
INCLUSIONARY UNITS, THIS IS AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW
INCOME TENANTS HAVE OFTEN POOR CREDIT. THAT'S A REALITY. WE NEED
TO DO BETTER BY THEM. AND IF THAT MEANS THE CITY NEEDS TO BACK UP
THE TENANTS WITH MORE FUNDS INSTEAD OF HAVING MARKET RATE
DEVELOPERS FEEL THEY ARE EXCLUDING PEOPLE FAIRLY, THAT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO. I'M NOT SURE I SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AS THE ONLY WAY
WE GET HOUSING IN A LOT OF WAYS, GIVEN WE HAVE THE THOUSAND UNITS
THAT ARE MANAGED BY TRADITIONAL PROPERTY OWNERS, WE DO NEED TO
FILL IN THE GAPS WHERE THESE THINGS DON'T FIT. FINALLY, I WILL
COMMENT ABOUT THE ONGOING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. VIA ZOOM AND
ZOOM IS NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL, THE BEST FORM OF DEMOCRACY WE
WANT TO ENGAGE IT, IT HAS BEEN A BOOM TO HAVE THIS ONLINE ACCESS.
ONE KEY THING WE SHOULD DO IS HAVE A LIST OF WHO IS GOING TO SPEAK,
WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. ALSO, I'M SURE THERE
ARE MANY THINGS TO EXPLORE AS WELL. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. HAVE A
GOOD NIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DIANE MARTIN. FOLLOWED BY JOHN.
>> DIANE MARTIN, UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> TWO PLUS YEARS AGO WHEN I JOINED MOTHERS OUT FRONT CAMPAIGN
TO REVISE THE 2012 GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE, I KNEW LITTLE ABOUT THIS
WAY TO COVER THE ROOF WITH PLANTS AND LESS ABOUT BIOSOLAR ROOFS.
MOST OF US HERE TONIGHT COULD SAY THE SAME THING. WE HAVE
LEARNED A LOT DURING THIS TIME, MOST OF IT FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING
AND MANY AMERICAN CITIES THAT HAVE VEGETATIVE AND BIOSOLAR ROOFS.
AND EUROPE, ASIA, AND CANADA, VEGETATIVE AND BIOSOLAR ROOFS ARE A
ROUTINE TOOL TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE, CREATE A HEALTHY
ENVIRONMENT FOR RESIDENTS, AND BEAUTIFY SPACE. WE KNOW GREEN
ROOF POLICIES ARE PART OF STORM WATER ABATEMENT IN CITIES, SUCH AS
MILWAUKEE, WHERE THEY ARE MONITORED BY THE SEWAGE DEPARTMENT.
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE FLOOD MITIGATION, SOMETHING A SOLAR
ONLY ROOF WON'T DO. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE SOLAR AND HAVE
THEM, I NOW KNOW THAT FOR A CITY CLIMATE RESILIENCY, VEGETATIVE IS
NEEDED. LIKE ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY, IT IS EVOLVING AND GIVING
BUILDERS MORE CHOICES FOR CHEAPER PRICES AND WITH GREATER
EFFICIENCIES. THE CONSTANT IS THAT BIOSOLAR ROOFS OFFER A RANGE OF
MEANINGFUL BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED MANY TIMES BEFORE.
DO NOT TONIGHT TURN AWAY FROM THE RESILIENT BENEFITS THAT ONLY
GREEN ROOFS AND BIOSOLAR ROOFS OFFER OUR CITY IN THIS TIME OF
CLIMATE EMERGENCY. ROOFS WILL BE SOLAR READY SINCE STATE LAW

PAGE 5

APRIL 12, 2021

REQUIRES THEM. BUILT FOR THE CHILDREN'S FUTURE AND FOR THE HEALTH
AND WELL BEING TODAY. I DO NOT SUPPORT VICE MAYOR MALLON'S
PROPOSED AMENDMENT FOR SOLAR ENERGY AS A THIRD OPTION TO THE
GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE. I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS JOHN. JOHN RATLIFF.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, AND MEMBERS OF THE
COUNCIL. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR BRINGING BEFORE
THE COUNCIL RESOLUTION NUMBER THREE. IT CALLS ON THIS COUNCIL TO
TAKE A POSITION ON AN ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE
BUDGET AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR THAT IS A MAJOR BENEFIT
TO SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY.
A LOT OF US WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MASSACHUSETTS IS ACTUALLY
50TH, LAST AMONG THE STATES IN AFFORDING ECONOMIC SECURITIES TO
SENIORS. NOT THAT THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE
REACHED THE AGE OF 65 AND HIGHER EARN LESS THAN THOSE IN OTHER
STATES, IT IS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE
AREA, THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING, AND THE HIGH COST OF HEALTHCARE.
SENIORS DO HAVE QUITE A PRICE TO PAY IN HEALTHCARE. THIS COUNCIL
TOOK THE LEAD IN 2018 BY PASSING UNANIMOUSLY A RESOLUTION TO
SUPPORT EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY OF A FEDERAL PROGRAM, THE
MEDICARE SAVINGS PLAN, THAT OFFERS SUBSIDIES TO COVER THE PREMIUM
COST FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS.
IN 2019, THE STATE LEGISLATURE DID INTRODUCE THAT AND OFFER RELIEF TO
SENIORS WHO MAKE UP TO 165% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. BUT
STILL THERE ARE MANY, MANY SENIORS WHO DO NOT EARN ENOUGH TO
COVER THE BASIC COSTS OF LIFE IN THIS AREA, WHO ARE ABOVE THAT CUT
OFF POINT AT THIS TIME. AND THIS YEAR'S LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE ASKING
YOU TO SUPPORT WOULD RAISE ELIGIBILITY TO 200% OF THE FEDERAL
POVERTY LINE, ABOUT $2,000 A MONTH. MANY SENIORS WHO EARN THAT
ON MEDICARE SPEND A THIRD TO A HALF A QUARTER TO A THIRD OF THE
INCOME JUST COVERING THE PREMIUMS FOR MEDICARE. WE ASK YOU TO
SUPPORT IT AND SEND US ON OUR WAY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF
CLOSE TO 40% OF THE SENIORS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. KRISTINE JELSTRUP. FOLLOWED BY
NICOLE WILLIAMS.
>> HEATHER HOFFMAN, GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. FIRST, I LIKE TO AGREE THAT
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY HIRE YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL AND YOU
SHOULDN'T LIMIT IT TO DRAFTING ORDINANCES. YOU NEED RESEARCH, YOU
NEED OTHER THINGS. SO, DON'T LIMIT YOURSELVES. WITH RESPECT TO
CONTINUING REMOTE PARTICIPATION, INDEED THIS HAS MADE IT BETTER
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. I WILL POINT OUT AS I HAVE MANY TIMES IN THE
PAST, YOU STILL HAVE NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF LETTING THE PUBLIC
SEE THE STUFF THAT YOU GUYS SHARE AMONG YOURSELVES AND THEN VOTE

PAGE 6

APRIL 12, 2021

ON. WE NEVER GET TO SEE OR COMMENT ON IT.
WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED NOTICE ABOUT HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT
WITH THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT, I'D SAY THAT BASED ON MY
EXPERIENCE, THOSE COMPLAINTS WILL GO DIRECTLY INTO THE CIRCULAR
FILE. WHY DON'T YOU FIX THAT FIRST? WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY ON
BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AND OTHER SUCH BODIES, ABSOLUTELY. I WANT TO
POINT OUT A FEW ISSUES HERE. FIRST, BASED ON THIS, APPARENTLY WOMEN
ARE NOT EVEN CHOP LIVER. WE COUNT FOR NOTHING. ONE THING I HAVE
NOTICED IS INCREASING PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN ON THESE BODIES AND I
THINK IN GENERAL, THAT IS A GOOD THING. WOMEN AND MEN HAVE
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN LIFE. THEY OFTEN MATTER WHEN YOU MAKE
GOOD DECISIONS.
TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPERTISE IS IMPORTANT, WHY WOULD IT BE
SURPRISING WE HAVE OLDER PEOPLE ON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS?
ONE OF THE COMMON WAY TO GET MORE EXPERTISE IS GETTING OLDER,
LIVING MORE, HAVING MORE EXPERIENCES. WITH RESPECT TO OTHER TYPES
OF DIVERSITY, I'D SAY, IF ALL WE DO IS CHECK BOXES AND SAY WE HAVE ONE
OF THESE, ONE OF THESE, AND ONE OF THESE, WE SOUND LIKE A BAD
REPUBLICAN JOKE. AND SECOND, WE ARE SHORT CHANGING OURSELVES.
ONE THING THAT COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SAID TO ME SEVERAL YEARS AGO
HAS STUCK WITH ME AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HIM. THAT IS... WE
NEED DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINTS. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
ALREADY PLEDGED TO VOTE WHATEVER THE COMPANY LINE IS. THAT IS A
SAYING THAT HAS GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE IN THE CITY AND WE SHOULDN'T
CONTINUE IT. HAVE DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINTS, DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE,
BOTH LIFE AND EXPERTISE. AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE BETTER BOARDS AND
COMMISSIONS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO LAUREN CURRY.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. LAUREN CURRY. WORK WITH JUST A START. WE DO
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WILL COMMENT ON THE GREEN ROOF PETITION. I
THINK WE HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED A BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE
IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE ON SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE
WORKING ON. I THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD GOAL AND I THINK IT HAS BEEN
HELPFUL TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE INTERACTION OF THE SOLAR AND THE
GREEN ROOF IDEAS.
AT THIS POINT, IT IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO US THAT ANY PARTICULARLY
WITH REGARD TO THE 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER THE OVERLAY,
THERE BE ANY REQUIREMENT INTRODUCED, WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE SPECIAL
PERMITS AND HEARINGS, IN ADDITION TO THE THE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS
AND THE TWO PLANNING BOARD HEARINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY.
WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD EXCLUDE THE PROJECTS
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY FROM THE GREEN ROOF
ORDINANCE AS IT IS NOW PROPOSED. AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS
THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE HISTORY, IT HAS INCREASED FROM A PERHAPS


PAGE 7

APRIL 12, 2021

ATTAINABLE 60% TO THE 80% REQUIREMENT, WHICH GIVEN THE
COMPLEXITY OF THE MECHANIC S AND TECHNOLOGY THAT NEEDS TO BE
INCLUDED IN MODERN HIGHLY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS, JUST THE MECHANICAL
REQUIREMENTS AND THE SOLAR REQUIREMENTS TO MEET SOME OF THE
STANDARDS FOR GETTING YOUR SECTION 22 APPROVAL, THAT CAN'T REALLY
BE MET WITH AN 80% REQUIREMENT.
SO, I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT THAT IS GOING INTO THIS AND THE CARE
BEEN GIVEN TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. JACKSON PLACE AT JEFFERSON PARK. COUPLE OF
THINGS. ON THE DIVERSITY ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I THINK WE
NEED CHARTER REFORM AND I THINK WE NEED IN SOME CASES ELECTED
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. NANTUCKET HAVE AN ELECTED HISTORICAL
COMMISSION. I THINK THAT IS THE WAY TO ACTUALLY RESTORE POWER TO
THE CITIZENRY. SO, WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER DECISIONS MADE BY
OUR GOVERNMENT. INSTEAD OF APPOINTED INDIVIDUALS, BUT I THINK
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS, FRAMEWORK OF THE POLICY ORDER,
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE TOUCHED ON THE
WAY IT IS PHRASED. ONE IS, IN MANY CASES, THEY SEEM TO BE LIFETIME
APPOINTMENTS. WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST,
WHO HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE ITS FOUNDING. OVER 30 YEARS. AND WE
DON'T HAVE A SINGLE TENANT. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
BUT THEY DON'T LIVE IN IT AND THEY DON'T LOBBY TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO
ACTUALLY LIVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISIONS
THAT AFFECT OUR LIVES. WHY AREN'T THERE TENANTS ON THE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING TRUST? WHY AREN'T THERE PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME,
DEMANDING THAT? IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME.
I HEARD THE OTHER DAY, A CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR IN NEW YORK TALK
ABOUT PUTTING THE PUBLIC PUTTING THE PUBLIC IN PUBLIC SAFETY. I
THINK WE NEED TO PUT THE COMMUNITY AND PRESERVATION BACK INTO
THE COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT, FOR EXAMPLE. AND I THINK, IF I
UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING THAT HEATHER HOFFMAN SAID, I AGREE WITH
WE NEED A DIVERSITY NOT JUST OF THE USUAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE TALK
ABOUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY, WE NEED CLASS DIVERSITY, WE
NEED ETIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, PEOPLE WHO AREN'T JUST GOING TO ROLL
OVER FOR EVERY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE CITY. PEOPLE WHO ARE
GOING TO BRING A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE WHO CARE ABOUT PRESERVATION,
WHO CARE ABOUT THE HABITABILITY OF THE CITY. AND I DON'T SEE THAT. I
DON'T SEE THAT IN THIS POLICY ORDER. I THINK IT IS SORT OF SURPRISING
THOSE CONSIDERATIONS ARE NOT PART OF IT.
ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THING, I THINK IT IS INTERESTING, I WONDER
HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT BIKE STORAGE IS MANDATORY. THERE
SEEM TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO NOT HAVE TREE PROTECTION
BE INCLUDED FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR GREEN
ROOFS, BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO MIND BIKE STORAGE BEING MANDATORY.

PAGE 8

APRIL 12, 2021

I WONDER IF ANYBODY WILL CARE TO LOOK AT THAT TONIGHT. I AGREE
WITH SAUL, I CAN'T GET THE AGENDA BECAUSE I USE A MOBILE HOTSPOT. IT
TAKES TOO LONG TO DOWNLOAD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE ADRIAN SERVETNICK.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. KINNAIRD STREET. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE
GREEN ROOFS PETITION. I THINK THIS PETITION IS VERY THIS ADDRESSES A
REAL KEY NEED, WHICH IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM
THE BUILDING SECTOR OUTSIDE OF TRANSPORTATION. THIS IS GOING TO BE
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT SECTORS TO DECARBONIZE, BUT ONE OF THE
MOST ESSENTIAL. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS
PETITION ON SOLAR BUILD OUT ON ROOFS. RIGHT NOW, THERE IS BUILDING
OUT SOLAR ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS FINANCEABLE, EFFECTIVE, AND
BENEFITS THE PROJECT ON ONE OF THE PROJECTS I WORK ON, WE REDUCE
THE OVERALL ELECTRICITY USAGE BY 50% THROUGH ROOF TOP SOLAR.
BIOSOLAR SEEMS POTENTIALLY INTERESTING, BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME
THAT IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE U.S. AND THE POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS
ARE RELATIVELY SIGNIFICANT. IN MY MIND, IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PURSUE
MANDATORY SOLAR BUILD OUT, WHICH WE KNOW IS EFFECTIVE, WE KNOW
IT IS FINANCEABLE. AND WE KNOW IT IS USEFUL FOR REDUCING OVERALL
BUILDING EMISSIONS AS A PATHWAY TO DECARBONIZING THE BUILDINGS. I
THINK THERE ARE SOME OTHER ISSUES WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THIS
PETITION. NUMBER ONE, THE MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT
BEING LIMITED TO ONLY 20% OF THE BUILDING WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO
FULFILL THE OVERALL GOALS OF THE PETITION. I THINK EXEMPTING
MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL FROM THE 80% COVERAGE OR FIGURE OUT
ANOTHER WAY TO MITIGATE THAT ISSUE WOULD BE IMPORTANT. AND I
SUPPORT ANY EFFORTS TO EXEMPT AHO PROJECT FROM THIS PETITION.
MORE BROADLY, I THINK THAT WILL HELP TO SOLVE ISSUES THAT WILL
IMPACT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING AN
UPDATED VERSION OF THE PETITION IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, CHRISTINE.
>> CHRISTINE, UNMUTE YOURSELF AND GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: SORRY ABOUT THAT. HONORABLE MAYOR AND
COUNCILLORS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY CONCERNS. I
WILL ADDRESS THE GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE. I AM THE MOM OF TWO
TEENAGERS ENROLLED IN CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. A SMALL BUSINESS
OWNER AND MEMBER OF MOTHER S OUT FRONT. ALL OF THIS I'M SURE YOU
HAVE HEARD BEFORE, THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED WILL LOTS
OF (INAUDIBLE)... LOWER ENERGY COST AND INCREASE THE PRODUCTION
OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. GREEN AND BIOSOLAR ROOF, COOL HEAT ISLANDS,
IT IS A CONCERN AS THE INDEXES RISES, THE VEGETATION OF GREEN AND
BIOSOLAR ROOF WILL HELP CLEAR THE AIR. GREEN AND BIOSOLAR REDUCE
FLOODING ON THE GROUND BY ADDING WATER ABSORBING SPONGE ON THE
ROOF, WHICH WILL FILTER STORM WATER. ROOF TOP VEGETATION CAN
HAVE SPACE FOR GARDEN, COMMUNITY FARMS WITH PRODUCE, AND
MEADOWS WITH POLLINATOR HABITATS. SEEING VEGETATION ON NEARBY

PAGE 9

APRIL 12, 2021

ROOF TOPS WILL IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. WITH OUR SHRINKING TREE
CANOPY, VEGETATIVE ROOFS COOL HEAT ISLANDS. BIOSOLAR WILL INCREASE
THE LIFESPAN OF ROOFS. IN CONSIDERING AMENDMENTS TO THE REVISED
GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE, PLEASE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE
IRREPLACEABLE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM VEGETATIVE AND BIOSOLAR ROOFS.
SOLAR PANELS CAN'T PROVIDE THE VITAL BENEFITS TO THE CITY OF MY
CHILDREN'S FUTURE. AS THEIR MOM, I WOULD ASK YOU TO BUILD FOR THEIR
FUTURE, BASED ON THE SCIENCE AIMED AT CLIMATE RESILIENCY. DON'T
TURN BACK FROM DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ALL THE CITY'S CHILDREN.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. IS NICOLE WILLIAMS ON? PETER ELLIS?
>> THAT CONCLUDES EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED UP. I'M SORRY. MELISSA IS

CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. TODAY WE ARE REPORTING
20.8 CASES. ALSO, SINCE MY LAST REPORT, PERCENTAGE POSITIVITY SLIGHTLY
INCREASED TO POINT 059. 0.59. OVER A HALF PERCENT AS REPORTED ON
APRIL 8 IN THE COMMONWEALTH'S WEEKLY REPORT. AS OF TODAY, THE
SEVEN DAY AVERAGE OF PERCENT OF POSITIVITY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH,
SLIGHTLY DECREASED TO 2.3%. THE COVID 19 VACCINE IS FREE. ONE OF THE
BEST WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND THOSE AROUND YOU FROM GETTING
SICK, WE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO GET VACCINATED.
BEGINNING NEXT MONDAY, ALL MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS, 16 AND OVER,
WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE. ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S LATEST
WEEKLY MUNICIPALITY VACCINATION REPORT, 34% OF CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE, UP 21% FROM
THE PREVIOUS WEEK. 19% WERE FULLY VACCINATED, UP 11%. I'M PLEASED
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE VACCINATED CONTINUES TO GROW. I'M PROUD OF
THE CITY'S OUTREACH EFFORTS TO DATE. ON SATURDAY, THE CITY HAD A
VACCINATION CLINIC IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE AND ADMINISTERED 250
VACCINES TO RESIDENTS. CLAUDE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THIS DURING HIS
COMMENTS. I WANT TO THANK THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE
FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND THE LEADERSHIP OF MAYOR SIDDIQUI. AS
VACCINATIONS ARE ADMINISTERED, WE STILL NEED TO REMAIN VIGILANT,
ADHERE TO PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES AND BE TESTED REGULARLY.
I WILL NOW ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND CLAUDE WILL ADDRESS THE BALANCE
OF THE QUESTIONS. COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE CITY
DOING TO ENSURE THAT OUTDOOR LEARNING SPACES, INCLUDING TENTS
WHERE NEEDED ARE POSSIBLE, ARE IN PLACE FOR STUDENTS. THEY ARE
EXPLORING USE OF TENTS THIS SUMMER IN CONJUNCTION WITH SUMMER
CAMPS. STAFF EXPECT TO USE TENTS SO PARTICIPANTS CAN BE SHELTERED
FROM SUN FOR ACTIVITIES AND BE ABLE TO EAT OUTSIDE. THE CITY IS
WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THEY ARE HAVE PERMITS
NEEDED FOR THE PLANS.
SINCE THIS IS PRIMARILY A SCHOOL RELATED QUESTION, MAYOR SIDDIQUI
WILL PROVIDE THE RESPONSE. MAYOR SIDDIQUI, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
ANSWER THE QUESTION NOW OR WAIT UNTIL MY COMMENTS ARE OVER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I CAN ANSWER QUICKLY. I WILL SEND AN EMAIL. WE
INSTALLED OR ORDERED 18 TENTS OF VARIOUS SIZES AT THE HAGERITY,
TOBIN, KENNEDY LONG FELLOW, KING OPEN, MORRIS, ET CETERA. TENTS
HOUSE TWO SCHOOLS CAN BE USED BY SCHOOLS, SPACE LIMITATIONS AT
SCHOOL SITES AND PROGRAMS. AND PROGRAM CONFLICTS RESULTED IN
SOME SCHOOLS NOT ASKING FOR TENTS. THE COST THIS YEAR FOR THE
TENTS THAT THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE APPROVED AMOUNT TO ALMOST
$400,000. CPS HAS LOOKED AT TENTS FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL. TENNIS
COURTS FOR THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THAT OPTION REMAINS A
POSSIBILITY AS THERE'S DISCUSSIONS WITH CRLS CONTINUES. TONIGHT,
RIGHT NOW, THE CURRICULUM AND ACHIEVEMENT SUBCOMMITTEE IS
WORKING ON PROPOSALS FOR OUTDOOR LEARNING FOR FUTURE YEARS.

THERE WILL BE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF TONIGHT AND I'LL
FORWARD THOSE AS WELL.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER'S
QUESTION IS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, CAMBRIDGE HAS SEEN 22
EVICTION FILINGS AT NORTH POINT DEVELOPMENT. THEY HAVE A NUMBER
OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THROUGH THE CITY'S INCLUSIONARY ZONING
ORDINANCE AND ANOTHER 23 FROM OTHERS. LANDLORDS CAN CONTINUE
TO FILE PAPERWORK, CAMBRIDGE EVICTION MORATORIUM REMAINS IN
EFFECT. DOES THE CITY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVICTIONS IN
THE FILINGS, HOW MANY FOR NONPAYMENT, LEASE VIOLATIONS, DO WE
KNOW IF ANY CASES ARE AIMED AT TENANTS IN AFFORDABLE UNITS. THE
STAFF FROM THE LIAISON OFFICE, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
AND MULTISERVICE CENTER, ARE AWARE OF THE COURT FILINGS AND
MONITOR FILINGS WEEKLY. THEY MEET REGULARLY WITH LEGAL SERVICE
PARTNERS FOR THE NOVA AND CAMBRIDGE LEGAL SOMERVILLE LEGAL
SERVICES. THEY HAVE A STAFF PERSON ASSIGNED TO MONITOR FILINGS AND
CONDUCT OUTREACH TO TENANTS TO OFFER SERVICES AND RESOURCES.
THIS PRACTICE WAS IN EFFECT BEFORE THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC AND WILL
CONTINUE AS A REGULAR ONGOING OUTREACH PRACTICE.
THE TEAM HAS PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE FILINGS SINCE THE END
OF THE STATE'S MORATORIUM IN OCTOBER TO ASSESS THE IMPACT AND
EVALUATE RESOURCES AND INTERVENTIONS. TO DATE, WE BELIEVE
CAMBRIDGE AVOIDED THE ONSLAUGHT OF EVICTION FILINGS. THIS IS A
RESULT OF IMMEDIATE AND EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES PROVIDED BY
TOO MANY DEATHS. ASSISTANCE HAD MONEY FROM THE MAYOR'S DISASTER
RELIEF FUND, HOUSING STABILIZATION PROGRAM, MULTISERVICE CENTER,
RENTAL FUNDS, PROVIDED FINANCIAL AID TO QUALIFIED RESIDENTS.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE STRONG EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT PREVENTION
PRACTICES IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH MANY OTHER MANAGEMENT
COMPANIES, HAVE TO ENSURE TENANTS ARE OFFERED SERVICES AND
RESOURCES. THE CITY WILL CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO TENANTS AND
OWNERS TO ENSURE WE PREVENT RESIDENTS FROM BEING EVICTED,
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FACE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. I WILL THANK THE
LANDLORDS AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES FOR WORKING WITH THE
CITY AND WORKING TO ASSIST THE RESIDENTS OVER THE YEAR. REGARDING
THE 45 EVICTION FILINGS, APPROXIMATELY HALF ARE FOR CAUSE. THE
MAJORITY ARE FROM SINGLE BUILDING IN NORTH PONT. WE CANNOT
PUBLICLY SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, THE
ACTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN GENERALLY AIMED AT TENANTS IN AFFORDABLE
UNITS. FOR THE MOST PART, FOR COST SITUATIONS, THE FILINGS INVOLVED
MARKET RATE PAYING TENANTS. HOUSING LIAISON REACHED OUT TO THE
MANAGEMENT TEAM TO SET UP MEETINGS. MOVING FORWARD, STAFF WILL
CONTINUE TO WORK TO GAIN MORE INFORMATION, IT WILL WORK WITH ALL
PARTIES INCLUDING THE MANAGEMENT TEAM TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND
ENSURE THE WELL BEING OF ALL. THIS CONCLUDES MY ANSWERS TO THE
QUESTIONS. AS WE HAVE DONE, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR DATA COMING
FROM THE COMMONWEALTH AND WORK WITH THE EXPERT ADVISORY

PANEL, CITY DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, AND COMMUNITY
PARTNERS, TO ENSURE WE SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY
OF THE COMMUNITY. AS STATED EACH WEEK DURING THE UPDATES, WITH
EACH DECISION I MAKE, I WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH MY TEAM, PUBLIC
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AND THE STATE REGIONAL PARTNERS.
AS A REMINDER, THE CITY WILL OFFER FREE COVID TESTING TO OUR
RESIDENTS, WE HAVE NUMEROUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN PLACE
TO HELP RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE EVICTION
MORATORIUM REMAINS IN PLACE. I ENCOURAGE ALL TO RECEIVE A COVID 19
VACCINE WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE AND WE CONTINUE TO CONDUCT
OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO THE COMMUNITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
THE VACCINE IS FREE OF CHARGE TO ALL. ONCE AGAIN, I ASK OUR RESIDENTS
TO REMAIN VIGILANT, NOT LET THEIR GUARD DOWN, WEAR HIGH QUALITY
MASKS, WASH YOUR HANDS, PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND LIMITING
THE SIZE OF GATHERINGS. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CLAUDE.

>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CITY MANAGER, DR.
ASSAAD SAYAH, AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO
PROVIDE TONIGHT'S UPDATE. CAN YOU HEAR ME? EXCELLENT. BEFORE
DIVING IN, I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE SPRING IS IN THE AIR, FOR THE PAST YEAR,
WE HAVE USED DATA AT THE CORE OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES.
HERE IN THE DEPARTMENT AND ACROSS THE CITY, BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU
WILL SEE THE EVIDENCE OF SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUND.
KEEPING IN MIND, IT IS OUR ROBUST DISEASE SURVEILLANCE EXPERTISE THAT
INDICATED EARLY ON THE NEED FOR TESTING AND LONG TERM CARE AND
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS TESTING AMONG OTHER
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH A
DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF ILLNESS AND DEATH FROM COVID 19.
THE SAME DATA TRACKING APPROACH IN OUR AREA OF ZIP CODES,
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND SENSE OF TRACK LEVELS, IT CONTINUES TO INFORM
OUR DECISIONS REGARDING CONTINUED OUTREACH ABOUT TESTING AND
VACCINATION AND WHY WE HELD A CLINIC IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE THAT WAS
PILOTED THIS PAST WEEKEND. IT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE
STATE IN THE VACCINATION RATES FOR BLACK AND HISPANIC COMMUNITY
MEMBERS AS WE MAKE PROGRESS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VULNERABLE
POPULATIONS IN THE CITY.

Suspension of rules to bring
forward Communications from
other City Officers #2

NEXT SLIDE. SO, THIS IS A SNAPSHOT WHICH I PROVIDE EACH WEEK. THE
CASE DATA REFLECTS AS OF 5:00 THIS PAST FRIDAY, THE MOST UP TO DATE
STATS ARE REFLECTED IN THE DATA CENTER. WE SHOWED OVER 5700 CASES.
STILL HOLDING STEADY AT 121 REPORTED FATALITIES, VERY SADLY. IT
OCCURRED AMONGST CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS REPORTED TO OUR
DEPARTMENT. KEEPING IN MIND, 16% OF THE CASES ARE ACTIVE. AND YOU
HAVE HEARD THE UPDATED FIGURE ABOUT THE CURRENT NEW CASES, WE
ARE AVERAGING NOW OVER 28 NEW CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE
STILL REMAIN A MODERATE RISK LEVEL COMMUNITY AND AS THE CITY
MANAGER MENTIONED, WE ARE AT 0.59% OVERALL POSITIVITY. IN THE
COMMONWEALTH, NEW INFECTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO RISE SINCE EARLY


PAGE 13

APRIL 12, 2021

MARCH. WE MAY START TO SEE SOME LEVELLING OFF AND WE REPORTED
OUT WE HAVE SEEN DAILY AVERAGES BETWEEN 2,000 AND 2,300 CASES A
DAY. AND STATEWIDE, NEW INFECTION RATES CONTINUE TO BE THE HIGHEST
AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN THEIR 20S, FOLLOWED BY TEENS, 15 19, AND
INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR 30S.
HERE IN THE CITY, FOR THE PAST WEEK, WE HAD 178 NEW CONFIRMED
CASES. TRANSLATES TO AN AVERAGE ABOUT 25 NEW CASES PER DAY. OR
21.5 PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT BEING SAID, WE STILL REMAIN A
MODERATE RISK LEVEL COMMUNITY. ABOUT 40% OF THE CASES IN THE LAST
TWO WEEKS HAVE BEEN AMONG RESIDENTS IN THEIR 20S. WE ARE SEEING
INFECTIONS INCREASING AMONG RESIDENTS, 10 19 AND 30 39 YEAR OLDS.
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS DRIVING THIS, WE CAN SHARE SOME CASE
INVESTIGATION DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US BY THE STATE'S
COMMUNITY TRACING COLLABORATIVE. IN BROAD STROKES, THE CTC, AS IT
IS CALLED, THEY HELP US HANDLE THE LION'S SHARE OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS
AND CONTACT TRACING. 80% OF THE CASES NOW 97 CASES INVESTIGATED
DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF THE MONTH, 11% WERE ASSOCIATED WITH
WORKPLACE TRANSMISSION. 5% WERE LIKELY TRAVEL RELATED. 3% WERE
CONNECTED TO RESTAURANTS. 15% INVOLVE CLOSE CONTACTS AND ONE
AND FIVE OR 20%, WERE HOUSEHOLD TRANSMISSIONS.
THAT'S TO GIVE A CONTEXT OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE CITY. WE'LL
MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AS I QUEUE THIS UP, I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE
BEFORE GOING INTO THIS. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE TWO QUESTIONS FROM
ONE QUESTION FROM COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. HE ASKED THE
MOST RECENT EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL NOTES FROM MARCH 24, IT SAYS
THAT COLLECTION OF CONTACT INFORMATION FROM RESTAURANT PATRONS
SPECIFIED IN THE STATE'S MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE SECTOR POSTED
AS A SAFETY STANDARDS AND CHECKLIST FOR RESTAURANTS. ACCORDING TO
THE CTC STAFF, COLLECTION OF THE INFORMATION AMONG RESTAURANTS IS
NOT VERY CONSISTENT AND COULD BE IMPROVED. SO, COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER, YOU ASKED IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT
INFORMATION MAY HAVE BEEN MISSING AND WHAT HOW WE CAN DO A
BETTER JOB AT SUPPORTING RESTAURANTS. THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE
HAS BEEN DILIGENT WITH WORKING WITH AREA ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGH
THE LINKAGES, THROUGH THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY. CONCERNS
ABOUT RESTAURANTS ARE NOT COLLECTING CONTACT INFORMATION FOR
INDOOR DINERS HAS RESULTED IN FOLLOW UP COMMUNICATION TO FOOD
ESTABLISHMENTS FROM THE INSPECTIONAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT TO
HIGHLIGHT THE REQUIREMENT IN THE STATE'S REOPENING PROTOCOL. OUR
DEPARTMENT, WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED ABOUT 17,000 MASKS THROUGH OUR
OUTREACH BY THE CAMBRIDGE CORPS MEMBERS DIRECTLY TO AREA
MARKETS, RESTAURANTS, AND THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AND FAITH
ORGANIZATIONS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT QUESTION FROM
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
TRANSITION TO THE SLIDE. TAKING ABOUT VARIANTS. MAYOR SIDDIQUI
ASKED, GIVEN THE INNOVATIVE TOOLS ON THE GROUND TIED TO MAKING


PAGE 14

APRIL 12, 2021

BETTER DECISIONS USING DATA, THE MAYOR ASKED, IS THE BIOBOT
SURVEILLANCE ABLE TO PICK UP THE VARIANTS. IF NOT, WHAT ARE THE
OPTIONS FOR SURVEILLANCE. BIOBOT IS A MAIN PARTNER THROUGH A
SUBCONTRACT. THEY DEVELOPED AN ANALYTICAL METHOD TO DETECT NEW
VARIANTS IN MARCH. BIOBOT BEGAN TO SHARING WITH CAMBRIDGE
SCREENING RESULTS FOR THE VARIANT B.1.1.7 VARIANT. THE PROCESS
DETECTS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THE VARIANT B.1.1.7. BUT DOESN'T
SHOW THE LEVELS OF THE VARIANT IN THE WASTEWATER. THIS WEEK, THE
FOUR WEEK PILOT PROGRAM THAT WILL END LATER THIS WEEK, WE LEARN A
COUPLE OF THINGS. MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIANT B.1.1.7
WERE DETECTED AT ALL FOUR CAMBRIDGE SITES DURING THE FIRST THREE
WEEKS OF THE PILOT. AND THE VARIANT B.1.1.7 IS LIKELY ALREADY
CIRCULATING IN CAMBRIDGE BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY DATA PROVIDED
BY BIOBOT.
WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE IS BENEFICIAL FOR DETECTING NEW VARIANTS.
BUT MAYBE LESS USEFUL ONCE THE VARIANT IS CIRCULATING IN THE
COMMUNITY. AND LASTLY, THE CITY IS CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSION WITH
BIOBOT ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN A MERGING VARIANT DETECTION SERVICES,
IF AND WHEN THE SERVICES BECOME AVAILABLE. WE'RE AT THE READY. I
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH BIOBOT AND ANALYTICS.
THIS IS A COMPOSITE REGARDING VARIANTS AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER
THE COURSE OF TIME. THIS TABLE SHOWS THE NUMBER OF VARIANT CASES
DETECTED IN MASSACHUSETTS, CAMBRIDGE, AND ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES THROUGH GENOMIC SEQUENCING. THE COMMONWEALTH HAD
SOME OF THE HIGHEST COUNTS FOR VARIANT B.1.1.7 AND VARIANT P.1 P,
JUST THOSE ARE AREN'T DETECTED THROUGH RANDOM SAMPLING, BUT
THROUGH TARGETED SEQUENCING OF SPECIFIC CASES. GIVEN ALL THIS AND
WHAT IS IN THE NATIONAL NEWS, GOING FORWARD, TO GET A TRUER SENSE
OF THE PROGRESSION, THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND
PREVENTION WILL NO LONGER UPDATE VARIANT CASE COUNTS BY STATE.
INSTEAD, THEY WILL FOCUS ON THE ESTIMATED PREVALENCE OF THE
VARIANTS IN EACH STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION.
THE PREVALENCE IS ESTIMATED FOR PORTION OF RECENT COVID 19 CASES
CAUSED BY THE VARIANTS OF CONCERN. THE CDC PREVALENCE DATA WILL
LAG BEHIND BY A MONTH. WE EXPECT THE ESTIMATED PREVALENCE IN
MASSACHUSETTS IS HIGHER THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY SHOWN IN THE
TABLE. I WILL MENTION, THE CAMBRIDGE WASTEWATER DATA AND CASE
DATA FOR THE VARIANT B.1.1.7, INDICATE THE VARIANT IS MORE WIDELY
CIRCULATING AND THAT A HANDFUL OF CASES WOULD INDICATE. WITH
THAT, AS YOU HEARD, WE MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE TO TAKE
MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACHES THAN THE REST OF THE
COMMONWEALTH WHEN IT COMES TO OUR BROADER CITY WIDE
MITIGATION STRATEGIES.
NEXT SLIDE. REGARDING COMMUNITY TESTING. WE SHARE THIS EACH WEEK.
THIS SHOWS THE TREND DATA SINCE LAST SUMMER. IN EARLY APRIL OF THIS
YEAR, CAMBRIDGE LAST YEAR. WE CELEBRATED AN ANNIVERSARY WHEN


PAGE 15

APRIL 12, 2021

WE LAUNCHED THE UNIVERSAL TESTING PROGRAM. KEEP IN MIND,
CAMBRIDGE WAS THE FIRST MUNICIPALITY IN THE STATE TO PROVIDE ON SITE
SURVEILLANCE TESTING TO RESIDENTS IN ALL SKILLED NURSING AND
ASSISTIVE LIVING FACILITIES. WE KICKED IT OFF APRIL 9 OF LAST YEAR.
RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTY OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING, THE CITY OFFERED
VOLUNTEER TESTING TO ALL HOMELESS RESIDENTS IN SHELTERS AND THE
WARMING SHELTER. WHEN DATA DEMONSTRATED HIGH RATES OF
INFECTION FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS, THE
MOBILE TESTING PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED IN THE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD
AND ALL CHA AUTHORITY SENIOR BUILDINGS. WE DID THAT LAST YEAR. WE
ARE ABLE TO AUGMENT THAT TESTING THROUGH THE SCHOOL BASED
PROGRAM, WHICH WAS LAUNCHED LAST OCTOBER. AND TO DATE, WE ARE
CLOSING IN ON NEARLY 200,000 TEST THAT RESULTED FROM THIS CITY WIDE
PROGRAM.
FOUR TESTING SITES, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, FREE OF CHARGE. I CAN'T THANK
ENOUGH THE CITY MANAGER AND OUR PARTNERS FOR SUPPORTING THIS
AND I WILL APPLAUD THE TEAM AT THE ON THE GROUND HELP US TO PIVOT
AND IDENTIFY SITES. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE PARTNERS, THE
CAMBRIDGESIDE MALL, ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, 85 BISHOP ALLEN DRIVE,
ANCHORED TO ST. PAUL, AND HARVARD SQUARE LOCATION. THANK YOU.
EACH WEEK, WE PROVIDE A COMPOSITE. IN TERMS OF THE ELIGIBILITY OF
THE RESIDENTS TO GET VACCINATED. WE CLOSING INTO THE FINAL PHASE
NEXT WEEK. IT IS PHASE THREE, INDIVIDUALS 16 AND OLDER, STARTING ON
THE 19TH, ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE. WE DO BELIEVE THIS WILL
BE THE GAME CHANGER IN SLOWING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS ACROSS THE
COMMONWEALTH. WHEN YOU TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT, THE NUMBERS
ARE STAGGERING. THERE ARE 620,000 CASES IN THE COMMONWEALTH AND
OVER 31 MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES. AS YOUNGER AMERICANS BEGIN
TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE, WE SHOULD SEE AT LEAST THE PANDEMIC YEARS
COME START TO WIND DOWN, AS THEY SAY. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, REGARDING HERE IN THE COMMONWEALTH, LAST WEEK, A THIRD OF
RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE. JUST NOTE,
WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF SHIPMENTS THAT COME
FROM THE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO OUR PARTNERS HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL
AGENCIES. THE SUPPLY COMING INTO THE COMMONWEALTH CONTINUES TO
INCREASE WITH MUCH OF THE ADDITIONAL SUPPLY GOING TO THE
FEDERALLY RUN PROGRAMS IN THE AREA, AREA PHARMACIES, AND THE
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, FEMA, THE PROGRAM
ANCHORED AT THE HEINZ CONVENTION CENTER. RESIDENTS CAN PRE
REGISTER TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT ONLINE. NEXT SLIDE. SO, I HAVE
TALKED ABOUT THE EFFORTS OF OUR INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP AND THANK
YOU TO THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE, THIS WAS LAUNCHED
ON NOVEMBER 1. IN TERMS OF SHOTS IN ARMS, WE HAVE THROUGH THE
CITY RUN PROGRAMS, CLINICS, OVER 3,200 ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS HAVE
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF MODERNA OR A SINGLE DOSE OF JOHNSON
& JOHNSON. WE ANCHORED A LOT OF EMOTIONAL EFFORTS TO THE


PAGE 16

APRIL 12, 2021

CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO GET TO THE SENIOR AND DISABLED.
WE HAVE OVER 300 INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF
MODERNA OR A SINGLE DOSE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. HOMEBOUND
INDIVIDUALS, APRIL 9, 91 HOMEBOUND RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED A SINGLE
DOSE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. ADDITIONAL CLINICS BEING SCHEDULED
THIS WEEK.
WITH THAT, JUST NOTE, ON APRIL 7 AND 8, THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY
CORPS CONDUCTED OUTREACH TO WASHINGTON ELMS AND NEWTOWN
COURT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME TO THE CAMBRIDGESIDE MALL
THIS PAST FRIDAY FOR THE VACCINES GIVEN THE PROXIMITY TO THE CLINIC.
MANAGEMENT WAS SENT OUT AN EMAIL TO INFORM RESIDENTS THAT THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CORPS MAY HAVE MISSED MAKE AN
APPOINTMENT AND WILL WE PROVIDED THE PHONE NUMBER. OUR
DEPARTMENT AND OUR CITY PARTNERS ADMINISTERED A TOTAL OF 295
VACCINES AT THE MALL THIS PAST FRIDAY.
WITH THAT, THE VICE MAYOR MALLON HAD TWO QUESTIONS. TWO SETS OF
QUESTIONS. ONE FROM VICE MAYOR MALLON, CAN YOU GIVE AN UPDATE
ON THE HOMEBOUND VACCINE PROGRAM. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SIGNED UP? HOW ARE YOU CONTACTING RESIDENTS WHO MIGHT BE
ELIGIBLE? AS YOU SEE ON THE SLIDE, WE BEGAN VACCINATING HOMEBOUND
INDIVIDUALS IN EARNEST BEGINNING APRIL 6. THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH
THE COUNCIL ON AGING AND THE SOMERVILLE CAMBRIDGE ELDER SERVICES
PROGRAM, WHICH MAINTAINS A LIST OF ROUGHLY ABOUT 150 HOMEBOUND
INDIVIDUALS, WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINATION. AS I SHARED AS OF LAST
FRIDAY, TOTAL OF 91 HOMEBOUND RESIDENTS RECEIVED A SINGLE DOSE OF
JOHNSON & JOHNSON. WE DO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL DAY THIS WEEK TO
ACCOMMODATE INDIVIDUALS WE MAY HAVE MISSED OR WHOSE
APPOINTMENTS WERE CANCELLED AND WE'LL VISIT ALL ELIGIBLE
HOMEBOUND FOLKS UNTIL THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEIR VACCINES.
THE SECOND QUESTION BY VICE MAYOR MALLON, CAN YOU GIVE AN UPDATE
ON THE METRO NORTH VACCINE PARTNERSHIP NOW THE STATE RECEIVES
MORE DOSES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AS OF APRIL 19
RAPIDLY APPROACHING. THE SITE IN SOMERVILLE THAT IS OPEN FOR CHA
PATIENTS AND OTHER IDENTIFIED LOCATIONS BE OPENING SOON TO NON
CHA PATIENTS AS PART OF THE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP? AS WE SHARED
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND THANKS AGAIN TO THE SUPPORT BY THE
CITY MANAGER AND OTHER PARTNERS, THE METRO NORTH VACCINE
PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE STATE AND WE ARE WAITING ON
THE STATE FOR SUPPLY TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL. WHILE THE SOMERVILLE
SITE IS UP AND RUNNING AND PLANNING IS UNDERWAY FOR THE OTHER TWO
SITES THAT HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, TUFTS UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND AS
WELL AS THE ENCORE IN EVERETT. WE HAVE CONFIRMATION OF THE
VACCINE SUPPLY, BOTH TIMING AND ARRIVAL AND QUANTITY, WE'LL DO
OUTREACH TO ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO USE THE REGIONAL SITE TO GET
THE VACCINE AS WELL AS TO HELP THEM REGISTER AND ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS.


PAGE 17

APRIL 12, 2021

BEFORE THE NEXT SLIDE, I HAVE ONE QUESTION FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN
ON THIS NOTE. COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASKED, DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF
WHETHER SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, AT ANY LEVEL, WILL BE REQUIRING
VACCINATIONS WHEN THEY OPEN THIS FALL? SO, WE HAVE A ROBUST
PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERS IN THE CITY. WE REACHED
OUT TO THE FIVE UNIVERSITIES AND HIGHER EDUCATION SCHOOLS,
HARVARD, MIT, LESLEY, ET CETERA, THEY HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION
WHETHER THE VACCINE WILL BE MANDATED FOR THE FALL. THE
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL HAS DECIDED NOT TO MANDATE
VACCINATIONS. REGARDLESS OF THE MANDATES, ALL HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH ARE PLANNING TO STRONGLY
ENCOURAGE STUDENTS AND STAFF TO GET VACCINATED. I WANT TO KEEP
THAT IN MIND.
REGARDING NORTH CAMBRIDGE. I CAN'T SAY THANKS ENOUGH, YOU HEARD
FROM THE CITY MANAGER AND I WILL THANK THE MAYOR FOR HER SUPPORT,
ADVOCACY TO HELP DRAW ATTENTION HERE, BUT ACROSS THE DIFFERENT
AREAS OF HIGH NEED IN THE CITY. THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT TO LAUNCH,
THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE STATE FOR COMING THROUGH WITH THE
VACCINES THAT WE NEEDED. AS I NOTED AT THE TOP OF THE PRESENTATION,
DATA HAS BEEN DRIVEN HELPED US TO DERIVE THE DECISION MAKING
REGARDING MITIGATION AND OUTREACH STRATEGIES. OUR DISEASE
SURVEILLANCE ABILITY AND THE TALENT AND THE PARTNERSHIPS ON THE
GROUND HAVE BEEN SUPERB. I ARGUE THE BEST ACROSS THE
COMMONWEALTH. CAREFUL TRACKING LED US TO BEGIN VACCINATING IN
NORTH CAMBRIDGE AND WE HELD A CLINIC THIS PAST SATURDAY, AT THE
RESERVOIR CHURCH, AND WE VACCINATED 250 ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS LIVING IN
LOW INCOME HOUSING. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PARTNERSHIP, IT
WAS A HEAVY LIFT FOR THAT DAY. WE CANVASSED OVER A COURSE OF
WEEKS AND MONTHS, WE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TOWERS, 362, 364
AND 402 RINDGE AVENUE. AND KNOW, THE OUTCOME OF THAT BLITZ
CONTINUES THROUGH THE WEEK. I WILL PROVIDE A COMPOSITE OF WHAT
WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH THE EFFORT THIS PAST
SATURDAY. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, OF THE 250 SINGLE DOSE JOHNSON & JOHNSON ADMINISTERED DURING
THIS CAMPAIGN, IT WAS LAUNCHED THIS PAST SATURDAY, WE FOUND
NEARLY HALF OF THE VACCINATED LIVED IN ONE OF THE THREE BUILDINGS.
362, 364 OR THE 402 RINDGE AVENUE. OVER HALF, 53% OF THOSE, LIVE IN
LOW INCOME HOUSING OR OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY. WE
FOUND THAT 2/3 OF THE VACCINATED ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE FOUND
THAT THE LION SHARE LIVED IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE, OVER 90% OF RESIDENTS
WERE CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS. WE FOUND THERE ARE FOLKS THAT LITERALLY
WORKED IN THE TOWERS, ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED, MET THE CRITERIA,
SO JUST NOTE THAT WE DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB, THANKS TO THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT, PRO EMS, OUR OUTREACH STAFF, CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY
CORPS, CLINICAL TEAM, PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. THEY ALL WEAR A CAPE
AND I THANK AND APPLAUD THE TEAM FOR BEING THIS HEAVY LIFT. DR.
DOBBERTEEN CAN ATTEST AND COMMENT FURTHER ABOUT THE WORK IN


PAGE 18

APRIL 12, 2021

THAT CAMPAIGN. BY DESIGN, WE LAUNCHED IT AND HAVE A SCHEDULE FOR
THIS WEEK AND OUR PLAN IS TO GET TO THE OTHER POCKETS OF THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY THAT WE IDENTIFIED TO BE HIGHER NEED TO
MAKE SURE WE GET FOLKS VACCINATED, ESPECIALLY BLACK AND BROWN
FOLK IN THE CITY.
WITH THIS, THE STATE HAS BEEN PROVIDING THIS COMPARATIVE DATA. EACH
OF THE 351 CITIES AND TOWNS CAN COMPARE OUR MAKING SURE,
LOOKING AT RACE AND ETHNICITY, WE LOOK AT BLACK, LATINX,
MULTIRACIAL, AS OF LAST WEEK, AT LEAST 34% OF THOSE THAT RECEIVE ONE
DOSE OF VACCINE WERE BLACK INDIVIDUALS OR THOSE THAT IDENTIFY BLACK
OR AFRICAN AMERICAN. 19% OF THE IF YOU COMPARE OUR RATE TO
CAMBRIDGE TO THE COMMONWEALTH, WE ARE OUTPACING WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN THE COMMONWEALTH. LATINX, 22% COMPARED TO 18%
ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH. AND THIS IS REALLY THANKS IN LARGE PART
TO THE PARTNERSHIP ON THE GROUND. WE BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE
DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF COVID HERE IN THE CITY SINCE LAST SPRING.
WE HAVE BEEN STEADILY MAKING DECISIONS ON THE DATA AND THANKS TO
THE PARTNERSHIP ON THE GROUND. THIS IS A WAY TO COMPARE APPLES TO
APPLES NOW THAT THE STATE PROVIDES THIS DATA.
NEXT SLIDE. REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS. OUR COMMUNICATION
EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE CLINICIAN SPEAKERS BUREAU, CONTINUING AND
WILL PICK UP AS APRIL 19TH APPROACHES. 16 AND OLDER ARE ELIGIBLE TO
BE VACCINATED, THE MESSAGING AND OUTREACH STRATEGIES ARE
INFORMED BY THE AUDIENCE RESEARCH WE CONDUCTED IN FEBRUARY AND
APRIL. IT INCLUDES INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY
LEADERS AND MEMBERS AS WELL AS A SURVEY. THE AUDIENCE RESEARCH IS
DESIGNED TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATTITUDES, TRUSTED
MESSENGERS, AND THE BEST MEDIUM TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE. THE TOP
OF MY FINDINGS, YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE REFLECTED IN THE
COMMUNICATION OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING VACCINE HESITANCY,
THERE WERE CONCERNS VOICED ABOUT THE SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND THE
SPEED IN WHICH THEY WERE DEVELOPED, THE SENTIMENT IN THE
COMMUNITY SEEMS TO SHIFT AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SEE
IN THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE OR SOCIOECONOMIC
STATUS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW THEY CAN GET
VACCINATED.
KEEP IN MIND, VACCINE AVAILABILITY AND SCHEDULING, LACK OF A LOCAL
CAMBRIDGE SITE, INCLUDING OUR OWN INCLUDING THEIR OWN PRIMARY
CARE PROVIDER AND TRANSPORTATION OR THE INABILITY TO TRAVEL TO GET
A VACCINE. THOSE ARE THE THINGS FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS IS
WHY SO MUCH OF THE COMMUNICATION TO DATE HAS FOCUSED ON WHEN
RESIDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE, HOW TO REGISTER, AND WHERE TO RECEIVE THE
VACCINE. WITH THAT, KEEP IN MIND, TRUST IS FUNDAMENTAL TO PEOPLE'S
WILLINGNESS TO GET VACCINATED. Mobilizing PEOPLE TO REACH OUT TO
CONSTITUENTS AND CLIENTS, THIS IS VERY EFFECTIVE. THIS IS A MULTIPRONG
APPROACH. WE HAVE WRITTEN MATERIALS THAT ARE SIMPLY AND CLEARLY


PAGE 19

APRIL 12, 2021

WRITTEN. AS WELL AS TRANSLATED IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AS WELL AS
PUTTING AT THIS TIME VIRTUAL COMMUNITY FORUMS AND PERSON TO
PERSON OUTREACH TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE VACCINATED. THIS IS
REALLY MADE POSSIBLE BY THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CORPS, FIRE
DEPARTMENT, OTHER STAFF IN OUR DEPARTMENT WHO HAVE GONE DOOR
TO DOOR AT THE CHA SENIOR HOUSING, FOCUSSING ON THE
NEIGHBORHOODS HARDEST HIT, AND OUR CLINICIANS IN THE CAMBRIDGE
HEALTH ALLIANCE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE
VIRTUAL FORUMS. SKEPTICISM STILL EXISTS AMONG SOME AND THE
FORUMS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVALUABLE IN REACHING
THOSE WHO MAY STILL HAVE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS IN THE MIDST
ABOUT GETTING VACCINATED.
WITH THAT, I HAVE A QUESTION AS I WRAP UP THE REPORT. I HAVE A
QUESTION FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN. WHAT ARE WE COMMUNICATING
ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND TRAVEL MAY BE PLANNED AFTER
VACCINATIONS? FIRST, THE PRIMARY MESSAGING IS ON VACCINE UPTAKE
AND ASSISTING THEM WITH QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE.
WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR IN LETTING OUR COMMUNITY KNOW THE
IMPORTANCE OF VACCINATION IN MITIGATING THE PANDEMIC. WE
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATING TO RESIDENT WHO
ARE FULLY VACCINATED ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITY AND TRAVEL THEY
CAN PLAN.
WE HAVE DISSEMINATED THIS MESSAGE TO THE CITY'S ROBUST WEBSITE AND
EMAILS AS WELL AS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. WE HAVE PLACED EXTRA
EMPHASIS ON ACTIVITIES AND CELEBRATIONS WE ANTICIPATE WHERE FOLKS
WILL WANT TO GET TOGETHER, SUCH AS OVER EASTER, PASSOVER, AND
UPCOMING APRIL BREAK. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE FROM THE
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AS WELL AS FROM THE
STATE LEVEL PARTNERS IN WHAT WE COMMUNICATE. KEY GUIDANCE AND
MESSAGING IS FULLY VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS, PERSON IS FULLY
VACCINATED TWO WEEKS AFTER RECEIVING THE LAST RECOMMENDED DOSE
OF VACCINE. FULLY VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS CAN TRAVEL WITHIN THE
UNITED STATES AND DO NOT NEED COVID 19 TESTING OR POST TRAVEL OR
SELF QUARANTINE IF THEY TAKE THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS WHILE
TRAVELLING. WEARING MASK, MAINTAINING SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND
WASHING HANDS FREQUENTLY. AND FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE CAN VISIT
WITH OTHER FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE INDOORS WITHOUT WEARING A
MASK OR PHYSICAL DISTANCING.
SO, THERE'S A LOT WE'RE TRYING TO SHARE AND COMMUNICATE. JUST
KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ASK PEOPLE TO REMAIN VIGILANT. WE
REMIND PEOPLE ABOUT MASK WEARING, MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCE AND
PRACTICING GOOD HAND HYGIENE. WE ARE ASKING FOLKS TO GET
VACCINATED. NEXT SLIDE.
I BELIEVE THIS IS MY LAST SLIDE. REGARDING SCHOOLS. SINCE LAST FALL, WE
HAD A STRONG ROBUST PRESENCE. THANKS TO LEADERSHIP OF THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IN TERMS OF STAFF, WE HAD OVER 1,400


PAGE 20

APRIL 12, 2021

UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS TESTED. WE ADMINISTERED OVER 24,000 TESTS.
STUDENTS WE HAD OVER 1,300 UNIQUE STUDENTS AND ADMINISTERED
OVER 5,600 TESTS. SINCE LAST OCTOBER, WE IDENTIFIED 59 POSITIVE CASES
THROUGH THE SCHOOL BASE PCR TESTING. WITH REGARD TO POOL TESTING,
ON MONDAY APRIL FIVE, ADMINISTERED POOL TESTING TO 274 POOLS AND
APPROXIMATELY 1,500 CHILDREN WERE SWABBED. I'LL ADDRESS ONE LAST
QUESTION, WHICH IS POSED BY COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
THERE'S A LOT OF NEWS AROUND THE VARIANT B.1.1.7 SPREADING THROUGH
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES, AS WE REOPEN THE CITY AND MAKE SPORTS AND
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AVAILABLE, HOW DO WE ENSURE EVERYBODY'S
SAFETY IS PROTECTED. KEEP IN MIND, THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT AWARE OF
YOUTH SPORT CLUSTERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFINITIVELY LINKED TO THE
VARIANT B.1.1.7 THROUGH GENOMIC SEQUENCING. BACK TO LAST FALL,
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ATHLETIC RELATED CAUSES WHICH PRE DATE THE
EMERGENCE OF THE VARIANT B.1.1.7. THE MAJORITY OF THE CLUSTERS IS IN
YOUTH ATHLETICS, SPORTS WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES, HAVE
BEEN HOCKEY, BASKETBALL, DANCE, AND SOCCER. BUT THERE ARE CLUSTERS
LINK TO LACROSSE, GYMNASTICS, BASEBALL, AND OTHERS. WE DEPEND ON
THE ROBUST PARTNERSHIP THAT ANCHORS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, BUT
THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS. I THANK ADAM, ELLEN
AND HER TEAM TO HELP US MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE THE MESSAGING TO
OUR COACHES AND PARTNERS.
AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PARENTS, WE DO URGE PARENTS, WHOSE
CHILDREN PARTICIPATE IN YOUTH ATHLETICS OR SPORTS ON THE
PLAYGROUND, WEAR A MASK, IF THE CHILD DOESN'T FEEL WELL, WE URGE
YOU SKIP THE PRACTICES OR GAMES UNTIL THE SYMPTOMS HAVE RESOLVED.
AND THE SAME GOES FOR UNVACCINATED ADULT RESIDENTS, WHO MAY BE
IN LIMBO OR WAITING THEIR TURN AND MAYBE PLAY ON TEAMS OR ON
PICKUP GAMES IN THE PARKS. PLEASE, WEAR THE MASK AND DON'T PLAY IF
YOU ARE SICK.
WITH THAT, I SAY THANK YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR HIS SUPPORT,
THANKS TO DR. ASSAAD SAYAH FOR THE ADVOCACY, AND I APPLAUD MY
TEAM. LAST WEEK, WE DID CELEBRATE NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK, IT
LITERALLY WAS A FEATHER IN THE CAP TO HAVE THIS EVENT TAKE PLACE THIS
PAST SATURDAY. AND IT CONTINUES THIS WEEK. I THANK THE CITY
MANAGER AS WELL AS THE MAYOR, WHO RACKED UP FREQUENT FLYER MILES
AT THE SITE. THAT CONCLUDES MY REPORT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS? I WILL GO TO VICE
MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. TWO QUICK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
ONE, REGARDING TARGETED OUTREACH. I KNOW THAT MONDAY IS A BIG
DAY IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, EVERY RESIDENT IS AVAILABLE 16
AND UP. WE KNOW FOR 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS, ONLY THE PFIZER VACCINE IS
APPROVED. HOW ARE WE DOING TARGETED OUTREACH TO FAMILIES WITH
16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS AROUND THAT BEING THE ONLY VACCINE THAT IS
APPROVED AND SITES THAT MAY BE ADMINISTERING THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF

PAGE 21

APRIL 12, 2021

PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS ON MONDAY LOOKING FOR THE VACCINE
APPOINTMENTS. A LOT OF SITES DON'T TELL YOU WHICH VACCINE THEY ARE
ADMINISTERING. CURIOUS ON THE OUTREACH?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU. I WILL DEFER TO DR. DOBBERTEEN TO FIELD
THAT QUESTION.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU, CLAUDE AND THANK YOU VICE
MAYOR MALLON. IT IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION BECAUSE MOST VACCINE
PROVIDERS DO NOT KNOW WHAT IF THEY WILL HAVE A SUPPLY OF PFIZER
UNTIL PERHAPS THE WEEK PRIOR TO. ALL THE PROVIDERS ARE GETTING
WORD THIS WEEK OF WHAT VACCINE THEY WILL HAVE NEXT WEEK. IT IS
DIFFICULT TO BOOK AHEAD OF TIME APPOINTMENTS. I'D SAY THE BEST
OPTION FOR PARENTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE, 16 AND OLDER, TO CALL THEIR
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER'S OFFICE AND SEE ABOUT GETTING THE VACCINE
THROUGH THAT ROUTE. THAT'S THE MOST DIRECT WAY DO TO MAKE SURE
THEY GET PFIZER.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. DOES THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH
ALLIANCE RECEIVE PFIZER VACCINES?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: WE DON'T KNOW YET. THEY HAVE IN THE PAST.
WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO THINK WE WILL IN THE FUTURE. FOR ALL THE
REASONS WE MENTIONED, WE ARE NOT BOOKING AHEAD APPOINTMENTS
FOR 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS UNTIL WE HAVE THAT VACCINE IN HAND.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS,
A HUGE CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND TO
THE MAYOR FOR PUTTING AT THIS TIME THE NORTH CAMBRIDGE
VACCINATION CLINICS THIS WEEKEND. IT CAME TOGETHER FAST AND IT
LOOKS SUCCESSFUL. THERE ARE 3,000 DOSES AVAILABLE FOR THAT VACCINE
CLINIC AND 250 WERE TAKEN UP. WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE OTHER 2750
DOSES. ANOTHER CLINIC THIS WEEKEND, IF SO, STILL IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE
OR MOVING AROUND?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: I'M GOING TO ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN TO GIVE HIGHLIGHTS
OF WHAT WE HAVE SCHEDULED ALREADY THIS WEEK. LISA?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. THE VACCINE PLAN IS TARGETED FOR
THE NORTH CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS, WHICH IS OUR HOTSPOT. SIMILAR
NUMBERS TO OTHER PLACES IN THE COMMONWEALTH THAT HAVE SUCH
RATES OF COVID AMONG RESIDENTS. I'M CURRENTLY BROADCASTING TO
YOU LIVE FROM THE NORTH CAMBRIDGE VACCINATION SITE AS WE SPEAK.
WE VACCINATED PEOPLE THIS MORNING HERE. WE'LL BE HERE UNTIL 8:00
TONIGHT. I'LL VACCINATE TOMORROW FROM 4 8. WEDNESDAY FROM 4 8.
THURSDAY WE'LL VACCINATE FROM 4 8. NOT ON FRIDAY, NOT ON SATURDAY.
AND AGAIN ON SUNDAY FROM 11 7. THE RESERVOIR CHURCH
CONGREGATION HAS BEEN MOST GRACIOUS AND A WELCOMING HOST. I
CAN'T THANK THEM ENOUGH. AND OUR PARTNERS WITH THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, PRO EMS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH
STAFF, THEY ARE ALL DOING AN AMAZING JOB. THIS IS A GREAT SITE. I DON'T
WANT TO SKEW ANYONE'S PRIVACY OR TAKE PICTURES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

PAGE 22

APRIL 12, 2021

NOT EXPECTING TO BE SEEN TONIGHT, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE BACK AND
FORTH AND HUM OF ACTIVITY BEHIND ME AS THE VACCINATION CLINIC IS
ONGOING RIGHT THIS VERY MOMENT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU, DR. DOBBERTEEN. YOU THINK
THROUGH THE CLINICS, THROUGH FRIDAY, ALL 3,000 DOSES WILL BE GOING
TO THE NORTH CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: I THINK WE'LL DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF GETTING
ALMOST ALL, IF NOT THE ENTIRE LOT OF 3,000 DOSES IN ARMS THIS WEEK. I
HAVE EVERY REASON TO THINK WE WILL.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT'S WONDERFUL. AND THANK YOU TO ALL
INVOLVED IN PUTTING THAT TOGETHER. I YIELD THE FLOOR. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANKS TO THE CITY MANAGER
AND STAFF. I WANT TO QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON WHAT I HEARD DR.
DOBBERTEEN SAY JUST NOW. DID YOU SAY THAT THE RATES IN NORTH
CAMBRIDGE, PARTICULARLY IN THE RINDGE TOWERS, ARE THE HIGHEST THAN
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COMMONWEALTH?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: I SAID THIS IS A HOTSPOT AND THAT'S WHY WE
TARGET THIS AREA. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT PERCENTAGE. THEY ARE HIGH
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SET UP THIS INITIATIVE WITH HELP FROM THE
STATE TO VACCINATE RESIDENTS IN THE AREA.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: I WOULD JUST ADD, USING THE DATA, WE HAVE ACCESS
TO CENSUS LEVEL, CENSUS TRACK DATA. WE KNOW THE FIVE
NEIGHBORHOODS OF HIGHEST NEED IN THE CITY THAT INCLUDE THE
WELLINGTON, HARRINGTON, EAST CAMBRIDGE, THE PORT, AND THE
PATTERNS HAVEN'T CHANGED OVER THE COURSE OF THE MONTHS. WE HAVE
GOOD REASON TO LAUNCH THIS PILOT IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE AND I'M
PLEASED BY THE COLLABORATION. I CAN'T SAY THANKS ENOUGH FOR THE
EFFORT ON THE GROUND TO FOCUS ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS. MORE TO
COME AND WE'LL REPORT BACK TO THE COUNCIL AS WE MAKE PROGRESS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANKS. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND
CLARIFICATION. I CAN'T SEE ON THE CITY'S DASHBOARD, NORTH CAMBRIDGE
IS THE FOURTH HIGHEST RATE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS EVEN MORE
CONCENTRATED IN THE TOWERS. WE CAN'T SEE THAT THROUGH THE
PORTAL. THAT IS VERY CONCERNING. I WAS READING EARLIER TODAY, THE
CDC DIRECTOR, CALLED ON MICHIGAN TO CLOSE THINGS DOWN. SHE STATED
WE CAN'T VACCINATE OUR WAY OUT OF THE SURGE BECAUSE IT TAKES SO
LONG FOR THE VACCINES TO FULLY VACCINATE PEOPLE. LIKE SIX WEEKS OR
SO BEFORE SOMEONE IS VACCINATED FULLY. THE SURGE CAN GROW RAPIDLY
DURING THAT TIME. WE HAVE TO BE CAUTION. WE ARE GETTING SO CLOSE
TO THE END WITH THE VACCINE BEING DISTRIBUTED WIDE AND FAR, BUT WE
ARE STILL SEEING HOTSPOTS AND SURGES. IT IS QUITE CONCERNING TO HEAR
THAT FROM THE CDC DIRECTOR TODAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU AND


PAGE 23

APRIL 12, 2021

YOUR EFFORT IN SUCCESSFULLY GETTING 3,000 SHOTS INTO A HIGH RISK
AREA. THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE TO THE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT HAD A HAND. ONE THING WE
KNOW ABOUT IN THE NORTH CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY, THERE ARE A LOT OF
BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE THERE. AND I WAS HOPING WILL THERE BE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO EITHER REACH OUT TO SOME OF THE OTHER HIGHLY
IMPACTED AREAS, THE PORT, WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON, RIVERSIDE, WHERE
THERE ARE CONCENTRATIONS OF BLACK AND BROWN MEMBERS, WHO HAVE
SOME LEVEL ACCESS, IF THEY CAN'T GO TO NEW YORK EXCUSE ME. CAN'T
GO TO NORTH CAMBRIDGE BECAUSE IT WAS FOCUSSED ON NORTH
CAMBRIDGE. IS THERE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PIVOT TO THE OTHER
COMMUNITIES THAT STILL HAVE AS I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, THE HIGH
NUMBER OF INFECTION RATES?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: WE LAUNCHED A PILOT THIS PAST WEEK. IT WAS VERY
SUCCESSFUL AS YOU HAVE HEARD. OUR INTENT IS TO GET TO THE AREAS OF
HIGHEST NEED, INCLUDING THE PORT, EAST CAMBRIDGE,
WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON NEIGHBORHOOD. LOOK AT THE DATA, PAY
ATTENTION, WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DRILL DOWN NOT JUST FROM THE
FIVE ZIP CODES AND ACROSS THE 13 NEIGHBORHOODS, LITERALLY THROUGH
THE CENSUS TRACK AND THE BLOCKS. THAT IS BY DESIGN. I CAN'T THANK
ENOUGH, THE DIRECTOR OF DATA SERVICES, SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE
RESOURCE. IN CONCERT WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. DOSES IN HAND
SO WE CAN ENSURE TO GET SHOTS IN ARMS, ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK AND
BROWN. WE'LL REPORT BACK. THAT'S THE PLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I WANT TO
THANK THE TEAM, DR. DOBBERTEEN, ANNA, PAULA, AND EVERYBODY, AND
CFD, WE ARE SO INCREDIBLE. THE TOWERS, WALDEN SQUARE, JEFFERSON
PARK, JACKSON PLACE, IT IS A BIG EXPANSIVE AREA. TO THE POINT,
OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE GREAT TO DO THE SURROUNDING CITY. THAT IS
THE GOAL. IN THIS PARTNERSHIP, I WILL LIFT UP A STATE REP DECKER AND
HER SUPPORT ON ALL THIS AS WELL. SHE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE
ADVOCACY. I WANT TO MENTION THAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
MORE TO COME ON ALL OF THAT. A BIG THANK YOU FROM ME AS WELL.
THANK YOU FROM ME ON EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON. THE ONE ON
SATURDAY AND HAPPENING THIS WEEK. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
MORE DATA NEXT WEEK AS WELL. THANK YOU TO CPH. WE'LL DO A ROLL
CALL ON PLACING THIS COMMUNICATION ON FILE ALONG WITH THE
COMMUNICATION AND REPORT FROM OTHER CITY OFFICERS. CLERK
WILSON?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM THREE.
READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER THREE. PULLED BY COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WAS WONDERING IF THE

rollout.
COMMUNICATIONS FROM
OTHER CITY OFFICERS #2

APRIL 12, 2021

COMMISSIONER COULD EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE
PROGRAMS ARE DOING. I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE FUNDING FOR THE ARTS
PROGRAM. I'M NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ON WHAT THE HOTSPOT PATROL,
METRO GANG TASK FORCE AND WHAT THE PROGRAM WILL DO. AND HOW
MUCH OF THE FUNDING IS WHAT IS THE FUNDING IN COMPARISON TO THE
TOTAL AMOUNT WE SPEND ON THE PROGRAM.

A communication was received
from Mayor Siddiqui,
transmitting questions for the
COVID-19 Update.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COMMISSIONER?
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION. I WILL
BACK UP AND START WITH THE SHANNON GRANT IN OF AND ITSELF.
REMEMBER, THE FULL NAME IS SENATOR CHARLES SHANNON JUNIOR
COMMUNITY SAFETY INITIATIVE. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO
COMMUNITY SAFETY AND AS MUCH AS IT LOOKS AND SEEKS TO PREVENT
GANG AND YOUTHFUL VIOLENCE. WHEN I SAY COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH,
NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT, IT IS SOME OF THE MONEY, I BELIEVE, 2020
ALLOCATION WAS $650,000 TOTAL FOR THE EIGHT COMMUNITIES LISTED.
FOR POINT OF REFERENCE, EIGHT COMMUNITIES, CAMBRIDGE, CHELSEA,
EVERETT, MALDEN, REVERE, QUINCY, AND SOMERVILLE. AND WINTHROP.
AND THAT MONEY IS DIVIDED UP THROUGH THE EIGHT MUNICIPALITIES.
ABOUT 42% OF IT IS FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT. THERE'S AN
EMPLOYMENT COMPONENT. A RECREATION COMPONENT. YOUTHFUL
MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT. I'M MISSING SOMETHING. MUSIC AND ARTS.
AND ONE OTHER THING. COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION.
THAT MONEY IS DIVVIED UP FOR ALL. THE PART THAT IS PASSING THROUGH
US AND COMING TO US FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT FOR
CAMBRIDGE IS THE $25,800. IT REQUIRES A THIRD MATCH FROM THE CITY.
THAT BUMPS THE NUMBER UP TO ALMOST $34,000 WHEN WE PUT OUR
$8,000 CONTRIBUTION.
THE $7700 LISTED, THAT IS A PASS THROUGH THAT GOES TO THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY ARTS PROGRAM. THE MONIES ARE ALLOCATED SPECIFICALLY TO
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO OUR DEALING HOTSPOT AREAS. AREAS WHERE
VIOLENCE HAS BEEN PLAGUE AREAS PLAGUED BY VIOLENCE OR WE EXPECT
VIOLENCE POPS UP, A HOTSPOT WHERE DATA SHOWS VIOLENCE IS. METRO
GANG THE TASK FORCE, WE UNDERSTAND VIOLENCE TO BE A REGIONAL
PROBLEM IN AS MUCH AS VIOLENCE ANYWHERE IN THE REGION CAN AFFECT
AND CAUSE VIOLENCE IN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE REGION. WE DEAL WITH
IT THROUGH THINKING OF IT IN THOSE TERMS.
FOCUS DETERRENCE, HARM REDUCTION THEORY, WE ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO
OPT INTO THE PROGRAM. IT IS ABOUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OVERALL
HARM IN THE COMMUNITY. AND ANTIGANG IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS
WHAT THE METRO GANG TASK FORCE DOES. I KNOW YOU FREQUENTLY
ASKED ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF GANGS AND WHAT CONSTITUTES A GANG,
RATHER THAN RELY ON A FORMAL DEFINITION OF GANG, I FOCUS ON THAT
BEHAVIOR. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, TEND TO BE PROTECTIVE TO BE ONE
ANOTHER. FAMILIES ARE PROTECTIVE OF ONE ANOTHER. WITH A GANG OR
YOUNG FOLKS, IT MEANS RETALIATION IS A POSSIBILITY.


PAGE 25

APRIL 12, 2021

THE SHANNON GRANT, THE COMMUNITY SAFETY INITIATIVE, IS THIS
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. IT DOESN'T JUST USE LAW ENFORCEMENT, IT
WILL USE ALL THINGS I SPOKE OF TO ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE. LAST
YEAR, THE CULMINATING, TWO EVENTS, THE SHANNON ON THE HILL DAY
AND THE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT, WERE TURNED INTO VIRTUAL EVENTS
AND VIRTUAL DISCUSSIONS. THEY WERE PRETTY POSITIVE. AND I DON'T
THINK A DECISION IS MADE AS OF THIS YEAR WHETHER THOSE WILL BE
EVENTS HELD IN PERSON YET. NOT JUST THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER.
WHEN YOU SAY THE METRO GANG TASK FORCE, CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT
WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US TO PARTICIPATE
IN THAT? WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT GANG VIOLENCE?
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: IT MEANS ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. IT MEANS
WE'LL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT GANG VIOLENCE THROUGH
WHETHER IT IS INTERVENTIONS THROUGH STREET WORKERS, COUNSELORS,
FOR INDIVIDUALS WEARING OTHER FORMALIZED PROGRAMS. WE DO
WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH THE VIOLENCE. ONE
BIGGEST PART IS SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE OTHER REGIONAL
PARTNERS THAT ARE INVOLVED WE KNOW WE'RE NOT INSULATED. WE
KNOW THINGS THAT HAPPEN HERE IMPACT WHAT GOES ON IN SOMERVILLE
AND MALDEN. WE HAVE THE OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER
JURISDICTIONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE AMOUNTS SEEM QUITE
SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE OVERALL POLICE BUDGET. ARE YOU
SUPPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS WITH INTERNAL FUNDS?
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: VIOLENCE REDUCTION STRATEGIES. SURE. MOST
OF THE BUDGET IS MEANT TO PREVENT VIOLENCE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. IT CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE TO ME TO
HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. IT FEELS LIKE WE NEED TO DO MORE
OF THAT. CERTAINLY NOT JUST A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM, AS YOU
PLAINED. I AGREE WITH THAT. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH AS
A COMMUNITY OR AS A SOCIETY TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE. VERY
RECENTLY, UNFORTUNATELY EXPERIENCED A SHOOTING DEATH IN
CAMBRIDGE, AS YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE INVEST MORE IN THESE TYPES OF
PROGRAMS. IS THIS GRANT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT IT IS SUCH A DROP IN THE
BUCKET COMPARED TO THE CHALLENGE WE'RE DEALING WITH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE DISCUSSION IS GREAT. I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE
APPROPRIATION AT HAND. ALL FINE IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
COMMISSIONER BARD ABOUT LONGER THIS QUESTION ON HOW TO
PREVENT IT. THAT'S FINE. WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATION BEFORE US.
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: THE COUNCILLOR SAID IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT
DOING ENOUGH, IT IS NOT OUR WHOLE ENTIRE EXISTENCE, WE HAVE A
WHOLE ENTIRE SECTION. FAMILY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE SECTION, WHICH IS


PAGE 26

APRIL 12, 2021

DESIGNED TO TAKE THAT PUNITIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROACH OUT OF
CAMBRIDGE POLICING AND PROVIDE A SOCIAL JUSTICE APPROACH TO
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BETTER SERVED. THAT ENTIRE SECTION, DEVOTES
RESOURCES OUT OF THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET TO
PROMOTE AND DIVERT INDIVIDUALS AWAY FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM OR GET INDIVIDUALS SERVICE. IT DOESN'T PROVIDE SERVICES, LIKE
MENTAL HEALTH, IT ALLOWS US TO PUT INDIVIDUALS, WHO WE COME IN
CONTACT WITH, WOULD HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE APPROACH, AND DIVERT
THEM TO OTHER SERVICES IN THE CITY AND REGION. I WOULD BALK AT THE
FACT THAT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH OR WE DON'T SPEND ENOUGH OF OUR
BUDGET ON THOSE THINGS.
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO POLITICIZE THE TRAGIC DEATH. WE
HAVEN'T HAD A GUN DEATH IN MORE THAN THREE YEARS IS A BIT WOULD
YOU SAY TO ME.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I DON'T THINK THIS IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT
ONLY PROBLEM. WHEN I SAY WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH, I MEAN AS A
SOCIETY. WE DON'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT THIS VIOLENCE. A LOT OF THE
PROGRAMS THAT YOU REFER TO, WE CAN SEND PEOPLE TO, THEY ARE
UNDERFUNDED AND NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH RESOURCES. I DON'T EXPECT
AN ANSWER, BUT THINK HARD ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO MORE TO PREVENT
THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE APPROPRIATION? I
SEE NONE, CLERK WILSON, ROLL CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ADOPTION OF THE APPROPRIATION: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM SIX.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 6).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: HAVING SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT
THE VEHICLE FLEET. I BELIEVE THAT THE CITY WILL NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN
I ASK WHETHER THERE IS AN EV OR HYBRID ALTERNATIVE TO THE VEHICLES
OR IF THEY ARE EV OR HYBRID FOR THE GREEN FLEET POLICY FOR ASSESSING
EVERY VEHICLE WE CAN FOR THE MOST REDUCTION IN GREENE HOUSE GAS
EMISSIONS AND FUEL EFFICIENCY?

CITY MANAGER AGENDA
#3
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of the Shannon
Grant received from the
Metropolitan Mayors
Coalition’s Community Safety
Initiative through the Executive
Office of Public Safety and
Security, in the amount of
$33,585.19, to the Grant Fund
Police Department Salary and
Wages account ($25,875.19)
and the Grant Fund Police
Department Other Ordinary
Maintenance account
($7,710.00) which will be
dedicated to hot spot patrols,
Metro Gang Task Force
participation, and the Focused
Deterrence program.

>> OWEN: THANK YOU. INDEED, WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT EV AND HYBRID OPTIONS FOR VEHICLES IN PUBLIC WORKS AND
OTHER DEPARTMENTS OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF WEEKS. SO, WHAT WE'RE
PROPOSING TO PURCHASE WITH THIS MONEY IS TWO SMALL TRACTORS.
THEY ARE UNIQUE VEHICLES. THEY HAVE MAXIMUM SIX FOOT WIDE BLADES
THAT ALLOW US TO PLOW EFFICIENTLY THE BIKE FACILITIES. THEY ARE A
EUROPEAN MANUFACTURE. THERE ARE TWO TYPES. WE HAVE SEARCHED
HIGH UP AND LOW DOWN TO SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER MODELS AVAILABLE.
THEY ARE ARTICULATED VEHICLES THAT CAN HOLD A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF SALT, AND PLOW AND PROVIDE BOTH OPERATIONS: PLOW AND SALT.
NEITHER OF THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY ELECTRIC THEY ARE NOT A TYPE OF
VEHICLE YOU CAN USE IN THE COLD WEATHER GIVEN THE FACT THE BATTERY
POWER WON'T SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH AND GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF

PAGE 27

APRIL 12, 2021

TORQUE REQUIRED, YOU WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY VERY
QUICKLY IN THAT BATTERY.
IN TERMS OF HYBRID, THERE ARE NO HYBRID OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT THIS
POINT FOR EITHER OF THE TRACTORS. AGAIN, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR
OTHER OPTIONS HERE. QUITE FRANKLY, THEY ARE SOMEWHAT FINICKY IN
TERMS OF BREAKING DOWN. WE'D LOVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS TO
USE SOMETHING THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELIABLE ON OCCASIONS.
IN TERMS OF THE LARGE SALTER, THE LARGE VEHICLES THAT WE USE, JUST
PRIMARILY DURING THE WINTER MONTHS FOR SNOW AND SALT
OPERATIONS, ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THIS INSTANCE IS NOT SOMETHING WE
RECOMMEND GIVEN THE COLD WEATHER. AND THE FACT THE VEHICLE STAY
ON THE STREET FOR MAYBE 12, 16, OR 30 HOURS AT A TIME. DURING ANY
GIVEN OPERATION.
WE ARE NOT PROPOSING AT THIS POINT USING A HYBRID OPTION. WE HAVE
THREE PACKERS COMING IN WITH HYBRID OPTIONS. THEY ARE CLASS SEVEN
VEHICLES. WE'LL LOOK AT THEM TO MAKE SURE HYBRID OPERATION IN THIS
CAPACITY WILL WORK PROPERLY. WE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH ONE
HYBRID TRUCK OF THAT CLASS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE CONTINUE
TO INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGY, IT IS TECHNOLOGY THAT WORKS FOR US.
WE'RE NOT IN THE POSITION AS WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION. WE ARE NOT
IN THE POSITION TO PILOT VEHICLES THAT COST THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHICH WE INVEST IN WILL WORK.
WE WILL LOOK AT USING A POWER TAKE OFF ASSIST FOR THE SALTING
OPERATION WITHIN THE LARGE SALTER ITSELF. AND THIS ALLOWS US TO USE
A SMALL BATTERY TO POWER THE SALTING OPERATION, WHICH IS
INDEPENDENT PIECE OF OPERATION THAT IS GENERALLY POWERED OFF THE
FOSSIL FUEL. THAT'S SOMETHING WE ARE EXPECTING TO LOOK AT. I'M NOT
SURE IF I FULLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMISSIONER. YOU DID
ANSWER IT. AS YOU KNOW, I THINK IN THE FUTURE, ANY VEHICLE PURCHASE,
IT IS HELPFUL TO PROVIDE THE BACKUP SO NOT THAT I DON'T LOVE
HEARING FROM YOU, I RECOGNIZE IF THAT WAS PROVIDED, YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO GO INTO DETAIL. I DO LIKE THE FACT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD
AS WE DISCUSSED TODAY, WE DO NEED TO UPDATE SOME OF THE
PROCEDURES. I WILL TRUST THAT I TRY TO LOOK AND I DIDN'T SEE A HYBRID
OPTION FOR THOSE SMALL VEHICLES. IT IS A $650,000 PURCHASE. WE
EXPECT IT TO BE HERE FOR 10 20 YEARS. WE REPLACE THE ONE THAT IS 19. IT
IS INCUMBENT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN AND WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES,
THEY ARE NOT YET OF THAT SIZE. HYBRIDS ARE PRETTY OLD KNOWN
TECHNOLOGY AROUND FOR 20 YEARS.
THANK YOU. YOU DID ANSWER THE QUESTION AND GIVEN WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT NOT EVEN A HYBRID BEING AVAILABLE, I WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT
THIS ONE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO MOVE SUSPENSION

PAGE 28

APRIL 12, 2021

TO BRING FORWARD CALENDAR ITEM NUMBER 1, IT WAS CHARTER WRITTEN
LAST WEEK. SIMILAR TO THE EXPENDITURE FOR NEW BUCKET TRUCK. I
KNOW COUNCILLOR NOLAN HAD QUESTIONED AND CHARTER WROTE IT. I
FIGURE MOVE SUSPENSION TO BRING IT FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION
RIGHT NOW. ALONG WITH THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL ON SUSPENSION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION AND MOTION TO SUSPEND RULES TO BRING
FORWARD CALENDAR ITEM ONE. (ROLL CALL).

Suspension to bring forward
Calendar Item #1

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCILLOR NOLAN HAS
QUESTIONS OR MY COLLEAGUES. I'M PREPARED TO VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT
ALONG WITH THE OTHER APPROPRIATION THAT IS BEFORE US TONIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, FOR BRINGING
IT FORWARD. I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS. UNLIKE THE OTHER ONE, I WILL
NOT SUPPORT THIS PURCHASE. I DID HAVE A MEETING WITH THE CITY STAFF
TO GO OVER IT. I THINK WE ARE TRYING VERY HARD AND YET, WE DO HAVE A
GREEN FLEET POLICY THAT REQUIRES THAT WE NEED REQUIRES REACH
VEHICLE REQUEST IDENTIFY THREE OPTIONS AND COMPARE THEM. THERE IS
A HYBRID OPTION FOR A BUCKET TRUCK THAT IS ON THE MARKET FOR MORE
THAN A DECADE. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE STARTING AS EARLY AS 15 YEARS
AGO ABOUT HOW UTILITY TRUCKS ARE PROMISING APPLICATION FOR HYBRID.
WE WENT OVER THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER OPTIONS FOR IT. I RECOGNIZE
THE STAFF IS WORKING HARD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED THIS
YEAR. I HEARD THAT. I UNDERSTAND IT.
IT IS UNFORTUNATE, WHICH WE DISCUSSED, WE NEED TO GET INTO A PLAN
SO THAT WHEN WE ANTICIPATE THAT A VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED A
YEAR FROM NOW, IF THAT WHAT IT TAKES. THEY ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER
VEHICLES THAT ARE USUALLY HYBRID. IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD
ASSESS THIS. WE ARE NOW IN THE POSITION, WE REALLY DO NEED THIS
SOONER. AND ALSO, TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, IF YOU LOOK IT UP, IT IS NOT
JUST ABOUT SAVING ON GREENE HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, IT IS AMAZING, IF
YOU LOOK AT THE OLD TIME GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN TESTING OUT THE
HYBRID, IT IS FOR WORKER PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU JUST DON'T HAVE A DIESEL
ENGINE TO LIFT YOU UP ON THE TRUCK. IT WILL REDUCE THE NOISE AND
ELECTRIC MOTOR IS QUIETER. LOTS OF PLACES, IF YOU BRING IT OUT AT
NIGHT, YOU WON'T WAKE PEOPLE UP. I RECOGNIZE THE DPW INDICATED
THEY WORKED HARD TO CHANGE THEIR OWN PROCEDURES SUCH THEY ARE
NOT IDLING THE CAR MORE THAN NECESSARY. THEY USE THE ENGINE AS
LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. I RECOGNIZE THAT. IT MAYBE BROUGHT DOWN THE
EMISSIONS QUITE A BIT AND THE FUEL USE.
I THINK IN MY JOB, AS MONITOR AND OVERSIGHT AND PUSHING US TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF THAT BACKUP, IT IS HARD
FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE PURCHASE OF THIS VEHICLE RIGHT NOW WHEN WE


PAGE 29

APRIL 12, 2021

DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE BACKUP AND I RECOGNIZE THEY COULDN'T
PROVIDE IT IN TIME FOR TONIGHT'S MEETING. I LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING ON THE POLICY, THE PROCEDURE, SO WE ARE NOT IN THE
POSITION AGAIN AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND FOLLOW OUR OWN GREEN
FLEET POLICY, WHICH IS IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. AND NEEDS
US TO STEP UP AND RAMP UP. AND GET MORE CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT
WHAT OUR TARGETS AND GOALS FOR THAT.
>> CITY MANAGER: CAN I JUMP IN FOR A SECOND? I APPRECIATE
COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S CONCERNS. I WANT TO SAY, PERSONALLY, I HAVE
WORKED WITH OWEN AND JOHN FOR A LONG TIME AS BUDGET DIRECTOR,
FINANCE DIRECTOR, AND CITY MANAGER. THERE ARE NO TWO MORE
COMMITTED PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO VEHICLES. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO
DO WHAT THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE WE BUY AS GREEN AS VEHICLE AS
POSSIBLE. THEY TAKE THIS SERIOUS. WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO IN A
DIFFERENT DIRECTION, IT HURTS THEM TO SAY IT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE
TAKE IT SERIOUS. THEY ARE TWO LEADERS WHO ARE COMMITTED. THERE
ARE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I WANTED TO
LET PEOPLE KNOW BE AWARE, YOU CAN'T BE IN BETTER HANDS THAN OWEN
AND JOHN IN MAKING THE DECISIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I KNOW YOU EXPLAINED TO US
LAST TIME, IF YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND AGAIN, WHY IT IS THAT WE
CAN'T GO WITH A BETTER GREENER OPTION IN THIS CASE? AND ALSO, IF
THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF DELAYING THIS OR PRODUCING ADDITIONAL
OPTIONS TO CONSIDER?
>> OWEN: I DIDN'T SPEAK TO THIS THE LAST TIME WE DISCUSSED IT. I'M
HAPPY TO START THE CONVERSATION HERE. AND I KNOW THAT THE CITY
ELECTRICIAN AND JOHN, AND THE CITY TREASURER, THEY ARE HERE TODAY,
THEY ARE ONLINE AND CAN ADD TO WHAT I WILL SAY. I RESPECTFULLY
DISAGREE WITH I WOULD SAY WE HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF
THE EXISTING POLICY IN TERMS OF CREATING FLEETS. I RECOGNIZE SHE
READS WHAT IS ON THE WEBSITE DIFFERENTLY TO WHAT WE DO.
THE GREEN FLEET POLICY, FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, IS FOR SMALLER
VEHICLES AT THIS POINT. AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY LOOK AT THE LARGER
VEHICLES. I'D SAY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE, WHAT THE CITY
ELECTRICIAN HAS DONE, HE DOWNSIZED THIS VEHICLE FROM SOMETHING
PREVIOUS TO THIS THAT WAS 16 AND HALF TON DOWN TO A NINE AND HALF
TON. THEREBY, REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF FUEL THIS VEHICLE WILL USE. I
SPEAK TO THE FACT AND THEY CAN SPEAK MORE ELABORATELY, STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF THE BUCKET HERE,
THEY ACTUALLY TURN OFF THE ENGINE WHEN IT IS ELEVATED AND TURN IT
ON AGAIN WHEN THEY REDUCE IT. THEREBY, REDUCING THE ENERGY THAT IS
CONSUMED. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, GIVEN THE MORE SIGNIFICANT
INVESTMENT REQUIRED, WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH TO MAKE
THAT INVESTMENT. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT BATTERY SIZE AND SPACE

ALLOCATION FOR THE TRUCK.
PERHAPS IF JOHN OR OTHERS WANT TO SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE
ADDITIONAL CONCERNS.
>> JOHN: I'M NOT SURE IF MARK IS ON. I ECHO WHAT OWEN SAID. TO
UNDERSTAND THE WAY THEY OPERATE THAT TRUCK, TYPICALLY USED WHEN
THEY CHANGE OUT BULBS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WHEN THEY GET TO THE
JOB SITE, THEY DRIVE TO THE SITE, THE TRUCK ITSELF IS NOT HYBRID. GET IN
THE BUCKET, RAISE UP TO MAINTAIN LIGHT. ONCE THEY ARE UP, THEY CAN
SHUT THE TRUCK OFF. THE TRUCK IS NOT RUNNING WHILE DOING THE
WORK. AND WHEN THEY ARE FINISHED, COME BACK DOWN. HYBRID BUCKET
SYSTEM WILL SAVE SOME FUEL. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU START
TO LOOK AT THE PROCEDURES THEY HAVE PUT IN PLACE, COMPARED TO
OTHER THINGS, I THINK THEY ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT TRYING TO
BE AS GREEN AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, BUT WE FELT
THIS IS THE BEST COURSE BASED ON THE WAY THEY OPERATE THE VEHICLE.
>> DAVID: MARK CAN JUMP IN. THIS TRUCK IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WE ARE
STARTING OUR PHASE TWO OF THE STREET LIGHT REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.
BASICALLY, WE ARE TRYING TO REPLACE COMPONENTS THAT ALLOW US TO
DO THE DIMMING OF THE LIGHTS, WHICH STARTED TO FAIL. THAT WILL SAVE
US A LOT OF ENERGY IF WE CAN GET THE COMPONENTS REPLACED. AND
MARK IS ON THE LINE AND CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. THIS HYBRID ASSIST
COMPONENT, TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO GET. IT WILL DELAY OUR ABILITY TO
START THE STREET LIGHT REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.
>> MARK: THAT'S CORRECT. WE HAVE A VERY PRISTINE OPERATION
PROCEDURE WITH THE VEHICLES. WE HAVE TWO VANS EXISTING NOW THAT
HAVE HYBRIDS. THE KEY THING, SHUTTING THE ENGINE OFF AT THE
CONSTRUCTION SITE AND ON THE JOB SITES. WHEN WE PULL UP TO THE JOB
SITE, WE SHUT THE ENGINE OFF. SET UP THE WORK ZONE. GEAR UP WHAT
WE NEED TO DO AND START UP THE ENGINE. MINIMIZING THE ENGINE RUN
TIME AND THE EXHAUST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANKS. IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE
SAYING, THROUGH THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE, YOU ARE
MANUALLY REPLICATING ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE HYBRID BUCKET TRUCK
WOULD DO. IS THAT CORRECT?
>> MARK: THAT'S CORRECT. THE CHASSIS DOESN'T OFFER A HYBRID, IT
WON'T BE THE LIFT PART OF THE TRUCK. WHERE WE SHUT THE TRUCK OFF,
WE ELIMINATE THE IDLE TIME ON THE TRUCK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YOU ARE SAYING THE HYBRID, FOR THIS TYPE
OF TRUCK, DOESN'T AFFECT THE DRIVING. ONLY LIFTING THE BUCKET?
>> MARK: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: BUYING AN ACTUAL HYBRID TRUCK WOULD BE
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE ONE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT? IS THAT


PAGE 31

APRIL 12, 2021

RIGHT?
>> MARK: THEY DON'T MAKE ONE IN THE HYBRID DIESEL TRUCK. ONLY FOR
THE LIFT OPERATION PART OF THE TRUCK WILL BE HYBRID.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: RIGHT. THAT TYPE OF TRUCK, HYBRID TRUCK,
IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE ONE YOU LOOK TO BUY?
>> MARK: THAT'S CORRECT. IT WILL TAKE ABOUT 12 MONTHS TO GET IT.
>> JOHN: I'M SORRY. SO, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING, WE HAVE DONE A
BUNCH OF VANS WITHIN THE CITY, AFTER MARKET PRODUCTS, WE WORK
WITH EXCEL HYBRID. WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO TRY TO GET SOME
OF THE F250 TRUCKS AS WELL, THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY. THIS IS AN
F550. IT DOESN'T COME FROM THE FACTORY AS A HYBRID. IN THE FUTURE,
IF POSSIBLE, WE CAN SEE IF IS WORTHWHILE TO ADD ON THE TECHNOLOGY.
THE TYPE OF TRUCK DOESN'T COME FROM THE FACTORY HYBRID.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANKS. WITH THIS ORDER YOU PLACE OUT,
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET THE TRUCK?
>> MARK: ABOUT FOUR MONTHS TO GET.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. BUYING THE TRUCK,
NOT LEASING IT?
>> MARK: CORRECT. BUYING IT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THERE'S A LIFETIME HOW LONG DOES IT
LAST?
>> MARK: TYPICAL TEN YEARS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS. I'M
COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR THIS. I APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S
CONCERNS, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS THE BEST AVAILABLE SOLUTION AT
THE MOMENT. AND CERTAINLY, AS THE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO
IMPROVE, ENSURE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AND BUYING BETTER OPTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE BODY. I
SUGGEST WE TAKE EACH OF THE ROLLS SEPARATE. FIRST, WE CAN DO A ROLL
CALL ON THE $650,000 ALLOCATION FOR USE FOR THE SNOW AND ICE
OPERATIONS. THEN WE CAN DO THE CALENDAR ITEM. CLERK WILSON?

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THIS CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A
GREAT PROGRAM. I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT. I WANT TO TAKE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF WE CAN GET ANY UPDATE ON THE DIGITAL EQUITY
STUDY. AS WAS MENTIONED IN PUBLIC COMMENT, IT DOES FEEL LIKE A PART
OF THE DIGITAL EQUITY STRATEGY. WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE RESULTS OF
THE STUDY. THERE'S CERTAINLY MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE
COMMUNITY, UNHOUSED, PUBLIC HOUSING TENANTS, OTHERS WHO ARE
NOT STUDENTS OR NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE COMMUNITY LEARNING
CENTER WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY.
DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATES ON THE DIGITAL EQUITY STUDY? TRYING TO
ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, IF YOU WANT TO GET AN
UPDATE ON THE DIGITAL EQUITY STUDY, YOU ARE WELCOME TO PUT IN A
POLICY ORDER. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION
ITSELF. THE GRANT AND THE AMOUNT OF $25,000, THAT'S WHAT
APPROPRIATE PER THE RULES. TO TALK ABOUT AND GETTING AN UPDATE ON
DIGITAL EQUITY STUDY, THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. DO YOU HAVE A
QUESTION?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I DO. THANK YOU. I'M NOT ASKING FOR THE
DIGITAL EQUITY STUDY RESULTS, JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY DATA OR
ANY ASPECT OF THE DIGITAL EQUITY STUDY THAT INFORMS THIS DECISION
AND A QUESTION OF WHEN WE'D SEE THE FULL RESULTS OF THE DIGITAL
EQUITY STUDY SO WE CAN MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE RULED THAT IT IS NOT GERMANE TO WHAT IS
BEFORE US. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE GRANT, THE AMOUNT,
THAT'S RELATED. THE UPDATED QUESTIONS, YOU ARE WELCOME TO PUT IN
A POLICY ORDER AROUND IT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY WHETHER
WE HAVE ANY PROGRESS OR ANY UPDATES? JUST SILENCE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I APPRECIATE AND I AGREE WITH YOU. WE DID PUT
SOMETHING IN THE WEEKLY DIGEST FRIDAY TO SAY WHERE WE WERE. I WILL
REMIND THE COUNCIL OF THAT. WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE. I GO WITH THE
MAYOR AND THAT'S ALL I SAY. WE DID HAVE SOMETHING IN LAST WEEK'S
WEEKLY DIGEST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE HAVE QUESTIONS? QUESTIONS RELATED
TO THE APPROPRIATION ITSELF? AND THE UPDATE IN THE DIGEST, THERE IS
INFORMATION ABOUT IT. YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO TAKE THAT AND SHARE IT
WITH THE PUBLIC. WE'LL DO AN APPROPRIATION ON THE ROLL CALL ROLL

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL ON SUSPENSION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRING THEM FORWARD
TO DISCUSS WHILE THE CITY MANAGER AND THE TEAM ARE HERE SO WE CAN
HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND SOME AMENDMENTS THAT CAME FORWARD
FROM THE BODY TODAY.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THAT YES I UNDERSTAND AND
DEEPLY KNOW WE'RE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND WE NEED TO MOVE AT
TOP SPEED TOWARD THE CLIMATE GOALS. TO THAT END, I WANT TO THANK
THE MOTHERS OUT FRONT FOR PUTTING FORWARD THIS PETITION AND FOR
THE COMMITMENT TO MEETING THE EMERGENCY HERE IN OUR
COMMUNITY. I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PETITION HAS LOFTY GOALS AND I'M
GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.
HOWEVER, AS I STATED, I DIDN'T PERSONALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING
FORWARD WITH THE PETITION KNOWING THE PLANNING BOARD VOTED
AGAINST IT 8 1. ZONING IS COMPREHENSIVE IS DIFFICULT, MESSY, AND
KEEPING THIS PETITION IN COMMITTEE AND REFILING IT TO HAMMER OUT
DETAILS WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE. THAT IS NOT THE WILL OF THE
COMMITTEE. HERE WE ARE TONIGHT TRYING OUR BEST TO WORK OUT
ISSUES. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I MET WITH BUILDERS,
COMMERCIAL AND AFFORDABLE, AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING


PAGE 34

APRIL 12, 2021

BUILDERS IN OTHER CITIES AND THE OWN SUSTAINABILITY TEAM ABOUT THIS
PETITION AND THE VIABILITY. THEY HAVE ALL SAID THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT
CONCERNS ABOUT THE PETITION AND THE FACT IT LACKS THE OPTION FOR A
FULL SOLAR ARRAY.
EVERYONE AGREES TO MEET THE LOFTY AND CLIMATE GOALS IT IS CRITICAL
TO INCLUDE THAT AS AN OPTION. I SHARE CONCERNS AND TO ADDRESS
THEM, I PUT FORWARD AN AMENDMENT TONIGHT TO THE PETITION THAT
ALLOWS FOR A FULL SOLAR OPTION IN ADDITION TO THE GREEN ROOFS AND
BIOSOLAR. AT THIS POINT IN THE TIMELINE, IN THE INFANCY, UNTESTED IN
THE NORTHEASTERN CLIMATE OFFERING THAT FULL ARRAY OF SOLAR ENERGY
OPTION IS CRITICAL. IF WE DON'T, WE'LL HAVE BUILDERS CHOOSING
BETWEEN FULL GREEN ROOFS OR PAY THEIR WAY OUT. BOTH SCENARIOS
WILL LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ON SITE RENEWABLE ENERGY OPTION,
WHICH IS ROOF TOP ARRAY OF PANELS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPACE
THAT BIOSOLAR MAY TAKE UP AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PANELS ON A
ROOF.
ACCORDING TO JUST A START, ONE OF THE LOCAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
THEY DID RESEARCH ON THE BIOSOLAR SYSTEMS THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND
ONLINE WHICH EXIST IN EUROPE. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID, THIS PARTICULAR
BIOSOLAR SYSTEM REQUIRES FOUR FEET, NINE INCH SPACING BETWEEN
PANELS. A TYPICAL INSTALLATION WILL SPACE THE PANELS ABOUT ONE FOOT
SIX INCHES APART. MY TAKE IT WILL REDUCE ROOF TOP CAPACITY BY 40%.
40% IN REDUCTION IN PANELS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED AS A ZONING TOOL.
IF YOU REMOVE THE OPTION FOR A FULL ARRAY THROUGH THE ZONING
MANDATE OF GREEN OR BIOSOLAR ROOFS ONLY. IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE
THE FULL SOLAR ARRAY IS AN OPTION AS WE MOVE CLOSER TO BIOSOLAR IN
THE FUTURE. WE CAN REVISIT THE ZONING ONCE IT IS A MAINSTREAM
OPTION AND REEXAMINE THE FULL SOLAR ARRAY OPTION AND WHETHER OR
NOT TO REMOVE IT. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES CAN SUPPORT THIS
AMENDMENT, WHICH I SEE AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE
GREEN ROOF PETITIONS AS ONE OF THE GREENEST THINGS WE CAN DO AS
THE CITY TO MANDATE ON SITE RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPTURE AND THE
URBAN CONTEXT THROUGH PANELS. I WANT TO SAY, WE HAVE HEARD
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PETITION, PARTICULARLY ABOUT EXEMPTING
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHICH MY COLLEAGUES WILL SPEAK TO THEIR
AMENDMENT SHORTLY AFTER THIS.
ALSO, ABOUT ROOF TOP MECHANICALS, PENTHOUSES, AND INTRUSIONS
THAT ARE REFERENCED BEING EXEMPTED, ONLY FOUR FEET SQUARE. IT IS
TWO FEET BY TWO FEET AND ONLY ENCOMPASS A SMALL VENT STACK, LIKE
THE ONE I HAVE FOR MY STOVE, NOT THE MECHANICALS FOR A 25,000
SQUARE FEET AND ABOVE BUILDING. THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT
MAINTENANCE PATHWAYS ARE NOT EXEMPTED. THERE ARE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE ALLOWANCES FOR THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT IS NEEDED
BETWEEN ROOF TOP MECHANICALS AND OTHER ITEMS, LIKE PV PANELS, OR
THE VEGETATION GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF HEAT THEY MAY THROW. THIS IS
NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF THE ISSUES THAT COME UP, SPEAKS TO THE


PAGE 35

APRIL 12, 2021

MANY ITEMS THAT HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT FROM ANGLES AND FROM OTHER
CITY DEPARTMENTS.
SO, I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IS WHY I PULL THIS FORWARD WHILE
THEY ARE HERE. I HOPE THE CITY MANAGER, HIS TEAM, CAN ANSWER THE
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY, THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH
BUILDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ONE ITEM THAT HAS COME UP IS THE
EXAMPLE THAT IS IN DENVER, COLORADO. THEY HAD A GREEN ROOFS
ORDINANCE BY REFERENDUM, PUT INTO PLACE AND A YEAR LATER HAD TO
REVISIT THE ORDINANCE AND GO BACK AND ADD IN SOLAR ARRAYS BECAUSE
OF THE IT WASN'T IMPLEMENTABLE WITHOUT THE SIMPLY SOLAR OPTION.
TO THE CITY MANAGER AND CDD, IS THAT RESEARCH CORRECT? IF SO, DO
YOU HAVE ANYMORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DENVER, COLORADO,
EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE INSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL AS WE MOVE
THROUGH A POSSIBLE AMENDMENT TO THE GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE?
>> MS. FAROOQ: YOU ARE INDEED CORRECT IN TERMS OF THE DENVER
ORDINANCE. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS SIMILAR. SOME OF OUR STAFF
ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THEM EARLIER TODAY. THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW
THE GREEN ROOF MANDATE WAS PASSED BY REFERENDUM. BUT IT
CONFLICTED WITH THE BUILDING CODE AND WITH STATE OF COLORADO'S
WATER LAW. THERE WERE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF REAL ESTATE
INDUSTRIES FEEDBACK, AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THERE BEING
INEQUITABLE BURDEN IN COMPLYING WITH THE MANDATE. SOME
BUILDINGS WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A GREATER INVESTMENT OPPOSED TO
OTHERS.
THEY FORMED A TASK FORCE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM STAKEHOLDERS
AS WELL AS REFERENDUM SPONSORS. GOT A CONSULTANT ON BOARD TO
STUDY ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED ELEMENTS THAT THE ORDINANCE WAS
TRYING TO IMPACT, SUCH AS URBAN HEAT ISLAND. THEY LOOKED AT ALL THE
DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES TO GREEN ROOFS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE SIMILAR
FUNCTIONALITY. BASED ON THE DISCUSSION OF THE TASK FORCE, THE
ORDINANCE WAS MODIFIED TO INCLUDE SEVERAL OPTIONS TO MEET THE
REQUIREMENTS. ONE OPTION IS TO INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY A
PERCENTAGE ABOVE WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE CODE. BY CREATING ON SITE
OR OFF SITE SOLAR IN GROUND VEGETATION, PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF
INSTALLATION, IN ADDITION TO ACTUAL GREEN ROOF INSTALLATION.
THE ORDINANCE IS MORE EXPANSIVE THAN WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED
BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO EXISTING BUILDINGS WHEN THE ROOF IS BEING
REPLACED. THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR THE TYPES OF SOIL, THE
TYPES OF PLANT THAT NEED TO BE PLANTED. IN TERMS OF RESULTS, WE
LEARNED THAT ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS THE MEASURE THAT IS BEING MOST
OFTEN PURSUED. SOME PROJECTS INSTALL GREEN LEVEL VEGETATION
INSTEAD OF GREEN ROOFS, THIS IS CERTAINLY MORE BENEFICIAL FROM
HEAT ISLAND PERSPECTIVE. THEY HAD ONLY A COUPLE OF GREEN ROOF
INSTALLATIONS UNDER THAT ORDINANCE AND NOT OFTEN SEEING PAYMENT
IN LIEU OF INSTALLATION.


PAGE 36

APRIL 12, 2021

I THINK THAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE FEEDBACK I HAVE FROM STAFF WHO
SPOKE TO THE FOLKS IN DENVER.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY
HELPFUL AS YOU MOVE THE CONVERSATIONS AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THEM
WITH THE FOLKS IN DENVER AND OTHER PLACES TO PUT TOGETHER SOME
KIND OF MEMO FOR US OR A PLACE THAT GATHERS ALL OF THAT
INFORMATION AND DISSEMINATE IT TO THE COUNCIL FOR THE 26TH WHEN
WE POSSIBLY WILL PASS THIS OR ORDAINING IT.
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD WAS GIVEN ALL OF THE CALL OUTS FROM
THE COMMUNITY, WE HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENT, WE GET FROM THE
BUILDING COMMUNITY, AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDING COMMUNITY, ON
ROOF TOP MECHANICALS, MAINTENANCE PATHWAYS AND SPACING. IN
TERMS OF GETTING SOME INFORMATION BACK FROM CDD ON THOSE AND
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES RAISED AND THE
MULTIDEPARTMENTAL CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE TO
WORK THEM OUT, CAN CDD WORK WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT AND
INSPECTIONAL TO HELP US HAMMER OUT THE DETAILS THEN RATHER THAN
THE NINE OF US TRYING TO HASH OUT THE LANGUAGE ON THE FLOOR
WITHOUT THAT STAFF MEMO AND THE GUIDANCE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A
REAL COMPREHENSIVE MEMO FROM CDD AND LANGUAGE TO BE VOTE ON
OR NOT VOTING ON FOR THE 26TH?
>> MS. FAROOQ: YES. ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS OUR INTENTION. AS WE HAVE
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH ISD AND THE COLLEAGUES IN THE LAW
DEPARTMENT, WE ARE FINDING THERE ARE CERTAIN PIECES THAT WOULD BE
CHALLENGING TO INTERPRET. THEREFORE, ENFORCE AND SO WE'LL PLAN TO
BRING FORWARD SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD CLARIFY WITHIN THE
INTENTION NOT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE SUBSTANCE THAT IS IN THE
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU, BUT TO CLARIFY AND PROVIDE TO THE COUNCIL
SOME ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME ENDS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: WE'LL HAVE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE AND IN
PARTICULAR, I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, THE
DENVER EXAMPLE, GETTING SOME INFORMATION THAT YOU FIND OUT
THERE. AND ALSO A RESPONSE TO THE ASSERTIONS MADE BY JUST A START
THAT I QUOTED ON THE DECREASE SOLAR CAPACITY. THAT WAS SOMETHING
THAT CAME UP IN OUR EMAIL TODAY. I CERTAINLY WOULD WANT US TO DO
OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND RESEARCH AND SEE IF THAT IS THE CASE SO WE
CAN MAKE AN INFORMED JUDGMENT THEN. I THINK HAVING THAT MEMO
AND THE SUGGESTED CLARIFYING LANGUAGE WILL MAKE THE AMENDMENT
PROCESS EASIER FOR THE 26TH AND THE SMOOTHER PROCESS ON THE
FLOOR.
THE CLERK HAS PASSED AROUND THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE, ADDING A
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AS A THIRD OPTION INTO THE GREEN ROOFS
AMENDMENT. HE IS SHOWING IT ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW. I REALLY DO
HOPE MY COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS TO ADD SOLAR
ENERGY OPTION TO THE PETITION TO MAKE IT STRONGER. ALLOW FOR THAT
CAPTURE OF ON SITE RENEWABLES AND HELP US REACH OUR GOALS. I WILL

PAGE 37

APRIL 12, 2021

YIELD FOR DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. PER THE CLERK, HAVE YOU ADVISED TO VOTE ON THE
