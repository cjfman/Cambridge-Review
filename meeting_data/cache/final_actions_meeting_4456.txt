The City of Cambridge’s 2023 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan (NHMP) was adopted by the City
Council on DATE to update and replace the City of Cambridge’s 2015 Natural Hazard Mitigation
Plan. The 2023 NHMP was developed through a collaborative planning process that involved city
staff across multiple departments, numerous stakeholders, and members of the public. We offer a
special thanks to the following individuals and teams who contributed to the NHMP and most of all
to the residents and business owners who contributed their knowledge and time.

1. Introduction
1.1. What is a Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan?
Hazard mitigation planning is an iterative process that seeks to reduce the impact of natural hazards
on people and property. Cambridge has assessed a variety of natural hazards that pose a risk to
the health and welfare of residents, identified specific vulnerabilities associated with those hazards
and climate change, and identified local capabilities and specific mitigation actions to protect
homes, businesses, and the critical infrastructure that keeps the city running. This process is tailored
to address the issues affecting Cambridge residents now and into the future and is crucial to building
community resilience.
What are Natural
Hazards?
Natural hazards are a source
of harm or difficulty created
by a meteorological,
environmental, or geological
event (such as extreme wind
events, tornadoes, winter
weather as well as
earthquakes flooding, and
fires).

Vulnerability is a
description of which
community “assets” (e.g.,
people, structures, systems,
natural resources, cultural
resources, historic
resources, etc.) are at risk
from the effects of a natural
hazard.

Climate change refers to long-term fluctuations in
regional temperatures and weather patterns. These
fluctuations can be natural, due to events such as solar
activity or volcanic eruptions. These fluctuations are also
driven by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels
like coal, oil, and gas, which have been prominent since the
1800s. Increasing global temperatures have resulted in a
multitude of impacts, including but not limited to rising sea
levels, shrinking of the polar ice caps, receding glaciers,
changes in seasonality, and shifting animal and plant
populations (Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment
(CCVA), 2015). Climate change has increased the frequency
and intensity of many natural hazards creating a greater need
for proactive planning. Chapter 3 includes additional
information on natural hazard severity and risk.

City of Cambridge Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan

Hazard Mitigation is the
effort to reduce impacts from
natural hazards through
community planning, policy
changes, educational
programs, infrastructure
projects, and other activities.

Resilience is the ability to
withstand and swiftly recover
from an extreme event. Ideally,
resilient systems “bounce
forward” to create healthier,
greener, and more equitable
systems and spaces.

1.2. Benefits of Natural Hazard Mitigation
Planning
Completing natural hazard mitigation planning provides benefits to Cambridge:
1. Increasing public awareness of natural hazards that may affect the community
reduces overall risk. By providing education and outreach, individuals can
understand how natural hazards may affect their lives and what the region, the
city, and they as individuals can do and are doing to minimize impacts of those
hazards.
2. Proactive planning creates efficiency beyond city limits. Developing a Natural
Hazard Mitigation Plan (NHMP) allows state and local governments to work
together and combine hazard risk reduction with other community goals and
plans.
3. The community’s greatest vulnerabilities can be prioritized to receive resources.
Developing a plan of hazard mitigation measures considers a prioritization
process that reflects the cost and benefit of safety, property protection, technical,
political, legal, environmental, economic, social, administrative, and other
community objectives, quantitatively and/or qualitatively.
4. The implementation of an NHMP saves taxpayer money. According to FEMA, one
dollar spent on federal hazard mitigation grants saves an average of six dollars on
disaster response (NIBS, 2019).
5. Maintaining a FEMA compliant NHMP also makes the municipality eligible for
federal grant funding (FEMA, 2020). Hazard mitigation funding is available through
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). To be eligible for FEMA
Grants, local governments must prepare an HMP that meets the requirements
established in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act, as amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The HMP also ensures
that federally funded projects reflect a community’s priorities and offer solutions
to specific threats. Please refer to Chapter 7 for more information on FEMA grants
and other potential funding sources.

1.3. Organization of the Natural Hazard
Mitigation Plan
The report presents the results of the NHMP planning process, which was informed by data review
and analysis, input received from the Steering Committee during and outside of the Steering
Committee meetings, input from the NHMP stakeholder workshops, and input from public
engagement activities. This report is organized as visualized in the diagram on the following page.

1.4. Natural Hazard Mitigation & Climate
Adaptation Goals
On April 24, 2023, the Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Steering Committee established the goals and
objectives for natural hazard mitigation planning in Cambridge. The committee reviewed and
endorsed the goals at their subsequent meeting on May 22, 2023. This effort included a review and
update of the goals listed in the 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan. The goals were restructured to better
represent the current hazard mitigation efforts in Cambridge, create consistency with other climate
resilience planning processes, and provide simplified messaging to the public. The following
presents the goal, on the left, and the supporting objectives, on the right. Goals are broad, longterm policy and vision statements that explain what is to be achieved by implementing the natural
hazard mitigation strategy described in Chapter 7. Objectives are more specific and are indicators
that a community uses to understand if the goal is being addressed. Objectives are not meant to be
specific mitigation actions. Objectives will be evaluated and tracked as part of the plan maintenance
process described in Chapter 8.

2.1. Plan Updates to Reflect Community
Priorities
Cambridge is a hub for innovation and research that is constantly evolving. The city's technology
market is thriving, leading to an increase in population and invigorating the economy. The
community in Cambridge is becoming more vibrant and diverse with a growing immigrant
population. However, Cambridge is also facing challenges such as economic disparities and a
shortage of affordable housing. Additionally, the changing climate and stresses on aging
infrastructure and natural systems add complexity to the situation. To address these challenges,
the city has undertaken several planning processes and programs that consider economic
disparities, affordable housing, climate change, and the diverse needs of the community.
Since the last update of the Hazard Mitigation Plan, Cambridge released its first climate change
resilience plan in June 2021 called Resilient Cambridge. The plan provided a solid foundation for
the city government and all sectors of the community to do the necessary work to create closer
neighborhoods, better buildings, stronger infrastructure, and a greener city. This NHMP reflects
these considerations and Resilient Cambridge.

2.2. Community Engagement Approach
The goal of public engagement for this NHMP process was to center the experiences of those who
are most vulnerable to natural hazards in Cambridge. To truly mitigate hazards, the city must
develop strategies for protecting and supporting those who are most exposed. In 2023, the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) edited the terminology
and definition of “climate vulnerable populations” to “priority populations.”
In the Commonwealth, EJ populations (or EJ neighborhoods) have been identified as census
block groups (divisions of larger census tracts that are made up of about 600 to 3000 people) that
meet one or more of the following criteria:
•
•

•
•

•

The annual median household income is not more than 65% of the statewide annual
median household income.
Individuals who identify themselves as Latino/Hispanic, Black/ African American, Asian,
Indigenous people, and people who otherwise identify as non-white comprise 40% or more
of the population.
25% or more of households lack English language proficiency.
Individuals who identify themselves as Latino, Hispanic, Black, African American, Asian, or
Indigenous, and people who otherwise identify as non-white comprise 25% or more of the
population and the annual median household income of the municipality in which the
neighborhood is located does not exceed 150% of the statewide annual median household
income; or
A geographic portion of a neighborhood designated by the Secretary as an Environmental
Justice population in accordance with law (An Act Creating a Next-Generation Roadmap
for Massachusetts Climate Policy, Chapter 8 of the Acts of 2021)

a

According to EEA, priority populations also include people or communities who may be
disproportionately impacted by climate change due to life circumstances that systematically
increase their exposure to climate hazards or make it harder to respond. In addition to factors that
contribute to EJ status (i.e., income, race, and language), other factors like disability status,
access to transportation, health status, and age shape whether someone or their community will
be disproportionately affected by climate change. This is because of underlying contributors such
as racial inequality, financial insecurity, or accessibility barriers that create vulnerability. The term
priority populations acknowledges that the needs of people with these experiences and expertise
must take precedence when developing resilience solutions to reduce vulnerability to climate
change and natural hazards. All communities have priority populations even if they do not have a
mapped EJ neighborhood. To better understand the experiences of the residents and businesses
of Cambridge, the engagement strategy included a multitude of approaches including:

The Steering Committee: A group of City staff whose work focuses on
specific related groups and issues and who met regularly to consult on the
NHMP

The Hazard Mitigation Planning Team: A team of representatives of
a wide variety of groups and experiences

Public Engagement: Outreach, public surveys, and public meetings
open to all community members and neighbors

Within these activities, some engagement strategies include:
•
•
•

•

Being intentional about participants in the HMPT so that the group’s participants are more
representative of Cambridge’s neighborhoods, community knowledge, and more.
Tracking information about demographics in public surveys to inform gaps in reach to the
community and use information to inform engagement approach.
Identifying approaches to engage residents with the understanding that already limited
time and resources have been stressed post COVID-19. The team worked with STC and
HMPT to respectfully and meaningfully ask for community input through existing channels
and partnership with the Community Engagement Team.
The team worked to address barriers to participation through translation of surveys and
printed materials, offering interpretation for meetings, and conducting accessibility reviews
of language and visuals.

•

Understanding the community context and local initiatives through interactive engagement
techniques focused on listening and collecting stories, ideas, and input from residents,
businesses, and other stakeholders.
Avoid “planning fatigue” by building on previous and ongoing efforts as well as considering
ways to continue natural hazard preparedness beyond this project.

These engagement activities and the input gathered from the community were invaluable to the
development of the NHMP. The STC, HMPT, and community members helped shape the asset
inventory, vulnerability assessment, mitigation actions, and other elements of the plan.
For the Asset Inventory, community members gave input on assets that are critical to them or their
community. For the Vulnerability Assessment, community members gave feedback on specific
experiences they or others have had in a variety of hazards. They also brought attention to
potential vulnerabilities in the face of a changing climate. Additionally, community members helped
develop specific mitigation actions to address these vulnerabilities and strengthen the resilience of
the community. These assets, vulnerabilities, and actions have all been incorporated into the
NHMP.
Bringing as many people, particularly vulnerable people, as possible into the hazard mitigation
process and implementation will help Cambridge be more equitable and resilient in the future.

2.3. Steering Committee
The City of Cambridge convened a Steering Committee (STC) for the development of the NHMP.
The STC met six times to guide the planning process and make final planning decisions. More
information on these meetings and a list of STC members is included in Appendix A. The STC
played a key role in identifying critical infrastructure, involving key stakeholders, and documenting
the City’s capacity to mitigate hazards alongside ongoing operations. To assist in drafting the plan,
the STC also suggested or made available reports, maps, and other pertinent information related
to natural hazards in Cambridge.

Thirty-seven participants joined the workshop virtually and brainstormed key local assets in
Cambridge, how those assets might be impacted by hazards, and who would be the most
vulnerable to those impacts. A follow-up survey was also sent to participants to capture additional
input. The assets were categorized by people, structures, systems, resources, and activities. The
workshop format started with a presentation of natural hazards, an overview of the Natural Hazard
Mitigation Plan, and an overview of assets. The participants were then broken into four groups to
focus on one of the first four categories. After this exercise, the participants came back together to
consider activities as a group.

Assets in the people category that would be most impacted by natural hazards,
especially for more vulnerable groups (such as people with disabilities, currently
unhoused people, seniors, and low-income families), were shelters, housing, schools,
and food distribution.
Assets in the structures category that would be most impacted by natural hazards,
especially for vulnerable groups, were faith community buildings, grocery stores,
medical facilities, transportation infrastructure, schools, and Fresh Pond Water
Treatment Plant.
Assets in the systems category that would be most impacted by natural hazards were
the power grid, cell towers, transit routes, MWRA facilities, and water/sewer system.
Assets in the resources category that would be most impacted by natural hazards,
especially for vulnerable groups, were parks, open spaces, community gardens, and
arts and cultural facilities.
Activities included several Cambridge festivals and events like Head of the Charles,
Cambridge Science Fest, farmers markets, Honk Fest, block parties, and other
community-building activities that strengthen social capital and resilience.

2.4.2 | HMPT Workshop #2: Mitigation Actions
Sixteen participants joined the second workshop virtually and brainstormed
mitigation actions that would prevent the impacts discussed in Workshop
#1. The mitigation actions used corresponding categories as the assets:
structure, people, systems, and resources. The workshop format started
with an overview presentation of the Natural Hazard Mitigation Planning
process, assets, and mitigation actions. Then, there was a short
introductory presentation on mitigation actions for structures followed by a
brainstorming exercise where participants were assigned groups to create
mitigation actions for structures. This format (presentation then breakout
group brainstorming activity) repeated for all four categories and resulted in
mitigation actions in all four categories.

Some actions are reliant
on staffing a supply
availability which may not
be available. A shortage
was experienced during
the Covid-19 pandemic
and serves as an example
of what could happen in a
global or regional
emergency.

It was noted that
although non-electrical
communications were
utilized successfully in the
past, this process should
not be the only method of
communication as it limits
the experience of those
who are deaf or hard of
hearing.

Key mitigation actions for structures included coordinated emergency planning, an
emergency & extreme weather shelter assessment plan, and back-up power/generator
plans.
Key mitigation actions for people included public campaigns for hazard preparedness,
neighbor buddy system and community connections, and warming/cooling centers or
resources.1
Key mitigation actions for systems included non-electrical communications systems (i.e.,
loudspeaker or door-knocking)2, redundancies in the water supply system, and energy
system flood resiliency.
Key mitigation actions for resources included improving parks and public pools,
incorporating resiliency education into public art projects, and assessing tree vulnerability
to pests.

2.4.3 | HMPT Workshop #3: Mitigation Action Prioritization
Twenty-three participants joined the third workshop virtually and worked on prioritizing the
mitigation actions that were generated in Workshop #2 (along with mitigation actions from other
city plans). The workshop started with an overview presentation of the Natural Hazard Mitigation
Plan, mitigation actions, and the prioritization process. Then, the group was polled on the most
important or critical mitigation actions in eleven distinct categories: communications, drinking
water + snow removal, housing + public health, community facilities + structures, cooling + tree
canopy, stormwater + sewer, energy + back up power, transportation + evacuation,
miscellaneous, and equitable emergency response planning.

2.5. Public Engagement
2.5.1 | Equitable Public Engagement
Equitable public engagement in the planning process is a crucial aspect of ensuring that all
members of the community have a voice and are represented in decision-making. The City of
Cambridge has recognized the importance of inclusive and equitable engagement and has taken
steps to redefine community engagement practices. Elements of this commitment include
dedicated public engagement and community access teams. Leaders of this work were included
in the development process of the Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan by participating on the steering
committee.
To strengthen existing social infrastructure and to support a more equitable and resilient future, the
engagement team prioritized stakeholders, residents, and community organizations early in the
process. The project-specific equity goals include:
•
•
•

Being intentional about the composition of the HMPT so that it better reflected the
communities in Cambridge neighborhoods and community knowledge.
Tracking success metrics such as attendance at meetings, social media engagement, and
participation in surveys.
Identifying approaches to engage residents with the understanding that time and resources
are stressed by other issues. Respectfully and meaningfully asking for community input,
addressing barriers to participation (including technology, time, and language barriers).

Understanding the community context and local initiatives through interactive engagement
techniques.
Avoid “planning fatigue” by building on previous and ongoing efforts, leveraging local
expertise, and empowering residents, and the HMPT, to continue considering natural
hazard preparedness beyond the duration of this project.
Developing accessible engagement materials by using visuals and text, using multilingual
designs, increasing the use of plain language, and providing translation.

2.5.2 | Fact Sheet & Public Survey
The project team developed a visual fact sheet
summarizing project information, along with an
online survey to collect information on the local
experience of natural hazards and needs to
increase resilience.
The Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan public survey
was distributed to community members through
virtual, hard copy, and community outreach network
methods. These included the City Daily Update
email, social media, virtual and hard copy flier
distribution, and promotion in partnership with
Cambridge Community Corp, and the Community
Engagement Team. The survey was also distributed
through the Natural Hazard Mitigation Planning
Team and Steering Committee networks.
The fact sheet, at right, was distributed through
social media networks and aimed at capturing a
snapshot of the project as well as promoting the
public survey.
Over 150 residents responded to the survey in July 2023. All the responses were in English,
although additional languages were provided. All Cambridge neighborhoods were represented
among the Survey respondents. A variety of ages, racial identities, and amount of time spent living
in Cambridge were also represented among the Survey respondents. A full report of survey
responses can be found in Appendix C.
Responses indicated that winter storms/nor’easters were the top hazard of concern for over 90%
of respondents, followed by extreme heat at over 80%.

2.5.3 | Public Meetings
Community input was also collected through a series of three public meetings with the help of the
STC and HMPT. Public Meetings were announced to community members through virtual, hard
copy, and community outreach network methods. These included several notices in the Daily
Update email from the City Manager’s office, posting on Cambridge social media and the project
webpage, virtual and hard copy flier distribution, and promotion in partnership with local networks
and the community engagement teams from various city departments.
The first meeting was held on June 13, 2023, from 6:00 to 7:00 PM, and was primarily focused on
informing the public about the history and purpose of the NHMP update, FEMA mitigation funding
programs, project work plan, and the overall planning process. The meeting included a discussion
of local vulnerabilities, strengths, historic hazard impacts on the community, and potential
adaptation action items.
The second and third meetings were held on October 25, 2023, to present the initial results and
review the draft NHMP Update. The second public meeting was held virtually from 12:00 to 1:00
PM on October 25, 2023, and the third public meeting was held in a hybrid in-person and virtual
format from 6:00 to 7:00 PM on October 25, 2023.

2.6. Local Long-Range Plans Related to Hazard
Mitigation
The City of Cambridge has undertaken significant long-range planning efforts related to hazard
mitigation, climate resilience, and sustainability. Key focus areas of these efforts include reducing
the city’s carbon footprint, preparing the community for extreme events and chronic impacts, and
mitigating risks to the built and natural environments from natural hazards. The following plans,
studies, reports, and technical information were reviewed and incorporated into the update of this
NHMP. Specifically, the information is used in developing portions of Chapter 3 Hazard Profiles,
Chapter 4 Asset Inventory, and Chapter 5 Vulnerability and Impact Assessment.
There are also a variety of ordinances and regulations, as well as committees and task forces, that
further the city’s efforts to proactively address natural hazards and climate change, which are
discussed in Chapter 6 in the Capabilities Assessment.
2015 Cambridge Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan
The City of Cambridge completed a Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2015. This plan was led by the
Cambridge Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee (LHMPC), staff from city departments,
and in collaboration with the Massachusetts Office of Emergency Management (MEMA) and
Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The LHMPC helped determine where natural
hazards most significantly impact the city, developed goals pertaining to hazard mitigation, and
identified strategies and actions to limit the impacts of hazards on Cambridge residents. Primary
goals of this plan include protecting the health and safety of Cambridge residents, protecting
properties and structures, ensuring continuity of essential services, promoting effective
communication, collaborating regionally, and protecting natural resources. The strategies identified
in this plan were informed by a risk assessment of flooding, high winds, winter storms, brush fires,
and geological hazards. The 2023 NHMP update builds on the foundations of this plan with
updated information regarding hazards, capabilities, and actions that have been completed during
the last several years.
Resilient Cambridge Plan
The Resilient Cambridge Plan is a citywide plan to mitigate the impact of potentially devastating
rain fall events, riverine flooding, winter storms, and rising temperatures. The Resilient Cambridge
Plan is organized into four focus areas – Closer Neighborhoods, Better Buildings, Stronger

a

Infrastructure, and a Greener City. Each focus area includes strategies organized by scale
including regional, citywide, neighborhood-level, and property-level actions. These actions are
intended to be implemented by a variety of stakeholders including city departments, agencies,
community-based organizations, and residents. The strategies identified were informed by public
meetings, workshops, focus groups, surveys, and technical studies, including the Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA). The actions presented in Resilient Cambridge were incorporated
into the Mitigation Actions presented in Chapter 7.
Climate Vulnerability Assessment
To establish the technical foundation for the Resilient Cambridge Plan, the city conducted a
climate change vulnerability assessment, focusing on the risks from increasing temperatures,
precipitation, and sea level rise. This assessment focused on Cambridge’s physical and social
vulnerabilities under the future conditions of climate change. This assessment was completed in
two parts in 2015 and 2017 and is accompanied by an online web-viewer for flooding.
Components of this vulnerability assessment are cited throughout the description of natural
hazards presented in Chapter 3 and the vulnerability and impact assessment presented in Chapter
5. In addition, the inventory of assets supported the updated asset inventory prepared in Chapter 4
and used for the NHMP vulnerability and impact assessment.
Neighborhood Climate Resilience Plans for the Port and Alewife
Prior to the development of the citywide Resilient Cambridge Plan, the city created two detailed
neighborhood plans for its most vulnerable areas - the Port and Alewife. These plans were
informed by the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and include strategies to make
infrastructure, natural resources, buildings, and communities more resilient in each neighborhood.
The Port and Alewife are home to many of Cambridge’s priority populations.
Envision Cambridge
The Envision Cambridge Plan is a citywide comprehensive plan focused on the city’s growth and
development through 2030. The Envision Cambridge Plan has a dedicated section on climate and
environment. This section of the plan includes analysis and strategies related to greenhouse gas
emissions reductions and renewable energy, waste reduction, ecological protection, climate
change preparedness, water quality, and environmental justice.
Urban Forest Master Plan
The Urban Forest Master Plan (UFMP) was completed in 2019 and is intended to guide’s the city’s
development of the urban forest into the future and will include a strategic plan to evaluate,
maintain and expand the urban forest canopy while being more resilient to climate change,
reducing the urban heat island effect, mitigating stormwater runoff, reducing nutrient runoff, and
contributing to community well-being.
Net Zero Action Plan
The city’s Net Zero Action Plan was adopted in 2015 and includes detailed recommendations to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment, improve energy efficiency, support
renewable energy generation on and off-site, and employ best practices to engage and educate

residents about occupant behavior. In 2020, the city began a five-year review process to evaluate
its progress on its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, and in 2021 began updating this plan.
Climate Action Plan
The City of Cambridge Climate Action Plan (CAP) was written in 2018 and is based on a
community-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory completed in 2016. Using the GHG inventory,
the CAP identified actions for achieving deep carbon reductions in the buildings, transportation,
and waste sections. The CAP was updated in 2018.
Cambridge also developed a citywide sustainability dashboard to accompany this plan as a way of
interactively tracking its progress on GHG reduction measures. The dashboard tracks progress on
climate, transportation, and energy initiatives. The dashboard is an accessible tool to help
residents get involved and visually comprehend the impact on carbon reductions.
Climate Protection Plan
The Climate Protection Plan was developed in 2002, preceding the city’s Climate Action Plan. This
plan was informed by an inventory of the city’s emissions from 1990 and 1998. The impetus for the
plan was that the City Council voted to join Cities for Climate Protection (CCP), an international
consortium of communities working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 1999.
Climate Resilience Zoning Amendment
Cambridge City Council adopted the Climate Resilience Zoning Amendment on February 27, 2023.
The updates to the city’s zoning regulations were stewarded by a task force appointed by the City
Manager in 2018. The purpose of this task force was to develop recommendations to make
development in Cambridge more resilient to climate change risks. The new zoning includes
regulations related to flooding and heat.

2.7. State Long-Range Plans Related to Hazard
Mitigation
Massachusetts Integrated State Hazard Mitigation & Climate Adaptation
Plan
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a state hazard mitigation and action plan in 2018.
This plan integrates climate adaptation and hazard mitigation into one statewide plan that
complies with FEMA’s federal requirements for state Hazard Mitigation Planning. Adoption and
maintenance of this plan makes Massachusetts eligible for federal disaster recovery and mitigation
funding under the Stafford Act. The state’s Hazard Mitigation Plan (called ResilientMass Plan) fiveyear update was released in the fall of 2023. The ResilientMass Plan is based on the
Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment, a statewide assessment of climate vulnerability,
informed by the best available data and climate science at the time of publication. The
ResilientMass Plan is an important document referenced in this NHMP and many other local
planning efforts.
Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment
The Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment was completed in 2022. The assessment is
organized into seven geographic regions of the Commonwealth including the Cape Islands, and
South Coast, North and South Shores, Boston Harbor, Eastern Inland, Central, Greater
Connecticut River Valley, and Berkshires and Hilltowns. For each region, the assessment includes
an evaluation of thirty-seven impacts on five sectors that include human, infrastructure, natural
environment, governance, and economy. This statewide assessment was the basis for the
SHMCAP.
Massachusetts Climate Resilience Design Standards Tool
The Resilient Massachusetts Action Team (RMAT) created a Climate Resilience Design Standards
tool that is publicly available online to any residents, locality, or agency in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. The tool provides parcel-level climate data for all properties in Massachusetts. The
Tool was created to advance the goals of the SHMCAP. The tool provides climate projections in
addition to a recommended planning horizon and return period for critical assets on a parcel input
into the Tool by a user. This tool is intended to help agencies with state capital planning and make
grants across Massachusetts respond to local climate data. Specifically, the tool provides:
•
•
•

A preliminary climate change exposure and risk rating
Recommended climate resilience design standards for projects with physical assets
Guidance of best practices to support implementation.

The tool was developed with climate science data for Massachusetts and will be updated overtime
to incorporate the best available information.

3. Natural Hazard Profiles

“Natural hazards are a source of harm or
difficulty created by a meteorological,
environmental or geological event.
Natural hazards, such as flooding and
earthquakes, impact the built
environment, including dams and levees”
- (FEMA, 2022)

Natural hazards have the potential to induce damage or loss to physical assets, such as buildings,
infrastructure, or natural, historic, and cultural resources, within the city. Natural hazards also have
the potential to affect people, including underserved communities and priority populations, city
processes and workflows, and activities that have value to the community. Analysis conducted
through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reveals that socially priority populations are
disproportionately affected by the impacts of natural hazards (EPA, EPA Report Shows
Disproportionate Impacts of Climate Change on Socially Vulnerable Populations in the United
States, 2021).
For each natural hazard profile, the following components of the hazard are identified in this
chapter:
I.

Description: A description for each natural hazard stemming from the Massachusetts
2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP) (EEA & EOPSS,
2018) and the existing City of Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan 2015 Update (City of
Cambridge & MAPC, 2015).

The following hazard profiles were developed based on the natural hazards that can affect the

the city or Middlesex County, including the extent, frequency, and location of occurrence,
aids in planning processes.
i.

Extent (Severity or Magnitude): FEMA defines extent, “as the range of anticipated
intensities of the identified hazards” (FEMA, 2022). This can be expressed in
varying scientific charts and scales, as relevant to the hazard and city. Extent can
be summarized as “how serious the hazard event is.”

III.

Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate Change: Climate
projections indicate a change in long-term weather patterns. This section identifies how
climate change may affect the extent, frequency, and location of natural hazard events
occurring, and to what degree in which they change. Future climate change projections for
the city, and climate change preparedness planning, design and engineering that the city
conducted to date have focused on the 2030 planning horizon as defined by the bounding
years 2015-2044, and the 2070 planning horizon as defined by the bounding years 20552084. In 2018, MA EOEEA created ResilientMA, an online clearinghouse for local
governments and the public to explore climate change science and data, information on
community resilience, and decision support tools. The climate change planning efforts that
ResilientMA has undertaken have focused on the 2030, 2050, 2070 and 2090 planning
horizons, which are defined by the bounding years 2020-2039, 2040-2059, 2060-2079 and
2080-2099, respectively. Since there is overlap in years between the city and the state’s
planning efforts for the 2030 and the 2070 planning horizons, we are using these to
characterize future hazards.
i.
Extent (Magnitude/Intensity): Future changes in the extent of a hazard event may
differ from what was previously described.
ii.
Probability: Future changes in the probability of a hazard event may differ from what
was previously described. For example, the intensity and frequency of precipitationbased events are expected to increase in the future.
iii.
Location: Future changes in the location of a hazard event may differ from what was
previously described.

Table 3.1 provides definitions of hazard location, extent, frequency, and probably. The definitions
support the basis of determination in Table 3.2. In accordance with guidance from FEMA,
quantification and definitions are necessary,

3.1. Inland Flooding (Stormwater and Riverine)
3.1.1 | Description

Flooding occurs when normally dry land is inundated by the rising or overflowing of water. Inland
(riverine or stormwater) flooding poses a major threat to the city. Identified as the “most prevalent
serious natural hazard identified by local officials” in the 2015 Cambridge NHMP. The frequency
and severity of flooding from riverine and stormwater sources is expected to increase as the
climate changes. Inland flooding is a result of combined effects of river overbank flooding and
flooding from drainage infrastructure capacity issues. Representation of this hazard is best
understood using the city’s flood model, discussed further in this section.

3.1.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)

The City of Cambridge has experienced ongoing flood hazard events throughout recent history.
For example, during 2010, the months of March and July were some of the most intense rainfall
Cambridge has experienced in recent history. In March of 2010, a ten-day stretch brought torrential
rainfall of over 14.83 inches of rainfall in accumulation and on July 10, 2010 an hour long storm
caused a rainfall accumulation of 3.58 inches in Cambridge (City of Cambridge, 2015). The July
10, 2010 storm corresponds to a 500-yr return period which implies an annual probability of 0.2%
or less based on precipitation intensity data from NOAA Atlas 14 (NOAA-Atlas14, 2015).
The following indicated events represent significant historic flood events in Cambridge, with
widespread flooding.

The City of Cambridge’s flood model, developed in ICM-2D, is a dynamic and integrated flood
model that factors both riverine flooding in the Alewife Brook and Lower Charles River areas, as
well as piped infrastructure flooding from stormwater (in separated areas) and combined sewer (in
combined areas) across the city. The riverine flood model in the Alewife area was built upon and
improved from the original 2010 FEMA HEC-RAS riverine hydraulic model for the Mystic River
basin. The piped infrastructure flooding in the city has been developed by integrating pipes,
manholes, catch basins, outfalls and other drainage/storage structures that already exist or are
currently under construction in the city. The dynamic interaction between riverine flood levels, and
piped infrastructure flooding, results in more realistic and accurate representation of actual
flooding conditions. The city’s flood model is also calibrated to available river stage and flow data
at multiple locations in the Mystic River and the Charles River watersheds, and it is expected that
the models will better simulate the flows and flooding in Cambridge for future precipitation

Extent of flooding can further be measured by the population impacted by the flood events and the
percent of land or properties flooded as a result of the event. Table 3.4 and Table 3.5 demonstrate
the severity of flooding in the City of Cambridge through these metrics.
Table 3.4 is a summary table reporting extent of inland flooding impacts in the Alewife area from

because The Port study area is smaller than The Port neighborhood area. Assumptions were made for this population
analysis because census tract data does not match The Port’s study area boundaries. (Source: 2016 ACS data)

3.1.2.2. Frequency
The 2018 SHMCAP states that the frequency of substantial flood events in Massachusetts is once
every 3 years. Described in Table 3.6, below, are the present day (baseline conditions) for design
rainfall storm events of different frequencies for the city. These present day storm depths are
based on extreme rainfall estimates provided by the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC)
intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) tables and curves.

As defined by FEMA, a repetitive loss property is any NFIP insured property which has been paid
two or more flood claims of $1,000 or more in any given 10-year period (FEMA, 2020). Therefore,
repetitive loss data does not represent all losses due to flooding and the number of buildings that
experience losses due to flooding is likely higher. Uninsured properties do not received any aid
from FEMA, with the exception of during a disaster declaration, when they may be able to receive a
grant for individual assistance. Insured properties can apply for a mitigation grant while uninsured
properties cannot.
The repetitive loss data below was provided by MEMA (MEMA, 2023). The identified repetitive loss
properties have received an aggregated total building payment of $99,769 and contents payment
of $83,900 from FEMA on three properties.

3.1.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.1.3.1. Extent
Climate change projections indicate that extreme weather events are likely become more frequent
and more intense in coming years. Compounding weather impacts may occur that can exacerbate
the impacts of these events. Increases in temperature can lead to greater evaporation, thus
increasing atmospheric moisture, and more intense precipitation events. High-intensity or heavy
precipitation events can lead to flooding, landslides, infrastructure damage, and erosion.
The Fourth National Climate Assessment, Volume I ( (Wuebbles, 2017), states that the observed
changed in heavy precipitation has increased by 74% between 1901 and 2016 in the northeastern
states. Long-term impacts of these changes may involve a change in floodplain boundaries,
leaving areas once safe now vulnerable to flooding. Inland flooding intensity will increase as heavy
rain falls in short periods of time, overloading soil absorption and riverbanks. These events can be
particularly devastating in urban cities like Cambridge, where impervious surface and buildings
can further prevent rainwater from absorbing in the soil. This added runoff may overwhelm
stormwater systems, thus increasing the risk of flash flooding.

3.1.3.2. Probability
According to the latest published data from ResilientMA (MA EOEEA, 2021), the annual total
precipitation in Cambridge area is projected to increase by ~11% with a projected 22% increase in
maximum precipitation by the 2070 planning horizon. Winter precipitation (which includes rain,
sleet, snow, and ice) will also be affected, with an estimated 16% increase in total winter
precipitation by the 2070 planning horizon. The annual number of days with extreme precipitation
is also estimated to increase in the future. Table 3.7 shows the estimated percentage increase in
total precipitation and days with extreme precipitation from ResilientMA (MA EOEEA, 2021).

Changes in precipitation and temperature in Cambridge could lead to modifications in the current
floodplain, putting areas that have not historically flooded at risk. Existing FEMA flood maps utilize
historic flood data and do not provide future floodplains. Future flood data was developed for the
city’s model (Cambridge, 2022) and found that the floodplain expands geographically compared
with FEMA floodplains. This could impact residents and businesses that are located in areas that
have not experienced flooding in the past, which could result in significant economic and social
costs.
Future projections show an increase in intensity and frequency of storm event. Design storms with
higher return periods will become more frequent. Design storms are regularly used by engineers
and planners to evaluate the performance of different systems and structures, such as drainage
systems, flood control structures, and buildings, under extreme weather conditions. A 100-yr
design storm has a 1% chance of occurrence in any given year and a 25-yr design storm has a 4%
chance of occurrence in any given year.

Precipitation data projections developed for Cambridge (from MA EEA’s Climate and Hydrologic
Risk Project (Steinschneider, 2022)) indicate that the frequency of future extreme design storms
will be higher in future. Future projected total precipitation depths over 24-hours were pulled from
this data source and are indicated in Table 3.9. The projections are also plotted with NOAA Atlas
14 present day baselines, for a series of recurrence intervals, as shown in Figure 3.4. This figure
shows the following relationships:
•
•

Rainfall over a 24-hr period that historically had a 1-in-100 year frequency (8.2 inches) is
likely to increase to a frequency of 1-in-10 by 2070.
Rainfall over a 24-hr period that historically had a 1-in-25 year frequency (6.3 inches) is
likely to increase to a frequency of 1-in-10 year by 2050.

3.2. Winter Storms and Nor’easters
3.2.1 | Description
Winter storms in Massachusetts can bring heavy snowfall and below-freezing temperatures. They
can also include blizzards, ice storms, nor’easters, and other extreme forms of winter precipitation.
•
•

•

Blizzards are characterized as snowstorms that reduce visibility to or below a quarter mile,
while also being accompanied by wind gusts of 35 mph or greater (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
Ice storms can also be an issue during winter months, where liquid precipitation falls and
freezes upon contact with the cold ground, creating ice buildups. These instances can
create impaired walking and driving conditions and can also result in damage to power
lines and trees (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
Nor’easters (which get their name from being a northeastern coastal storm) typically
develop as a large counterclockwise wind circulation, around a low-pressure center. These
storms include strong winds that blow in from the ocean, onto coastal areas. They are
typically associated with heavy rains or snow and can cause storm surge of greater than 2
ft, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion (City of Cambridge & MAPC, 2015). Sustained
winds of 20 to 40 mph are also common during nor’easters, even bringing wind gusts up to
50-60 mph.

3.2.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)
The City of Cambridge has experienced a multitude of severe winter storm events since 1978.
These hazard events are indicated in Table 3.10 below.

3.2.2.1. Extent
The severity or extent of winter storm events is characterized by two scales: Northeast Snowfall
Impact Scale (NESIS) and Regional Snowfall Index (RSI).
The NESIS was established by Paul Kocin (The Weather Channel) and Louis Uccellini (National
Weather Service) and is used to classify “high impact northeast snowstorms with large areas of 10inch snowfall accumulations and greater)” (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). The scale has five categories,
which are categorized by impact to an area. The calculated NESIS value is a function of the area
affected by the storm, quantity of snow that fell, and population living within the path of the storm
(NOAA, 2023).

More recently, however, the RSI has become more popular for use in quantifying the impact of a
winter storm event for the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. While the NESIS is calibrated to the
northeast, it has been used more nationally. Developed in 2005, the RSI is a more regional index
that has come to replace the NESIS. The RSI calculates impact of storm based on the spatial
extent, quantity of snow that fell, and population information, tied to societal impacts. It is cited as
better able to “place snowstorms and their societal impacts into a historical perspective on a
regional scale” (NOAA, 2023). Table 3.12 shows the classification of winter storms and nor’easters
by their RSI and respective descriptions.

3.2.2.2. Frequency
Notable winter storms and nor’easters often occur on an annual basis, if not more frequently. The
SHMCAP describes the frequency of Nor’easters as one or two per year, with some years
containing up to four of these hazard events (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). The Northeast generally
experiences one or two major winter storms each year with varying degrees of severity (NESEC,
2017).
3.2.2.3. Location
Winter storms and nor’easters are citywide natural hazards. These events can create issues for
residential, commercial, and emergency operations.

3.2.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.2.3.1. Extent
Winter storms and Nor’easters are powerful storms that can cause significant damage and
disruption to communities. Climate change is expected to cause an increase in precipitation in
Massachusetts over the next 80 years, and the proportion of this precipitation that falls during
extreme events is predicted to increase.
Although rising temperatures suggest that more precipitation will fall as rain than snow, historical
data show that the frequency of extreme snowstorms in the U.S. doubled between the first and
second half of the 20th century (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). With warmer air over the Atlantic Ocean, it
will lead to more moisture laden air causing more intense blizzard events in the winter when they
collide with cold air systems from the north in the NE US including cities like Boston and
Cambridge (MA EOEEA, 2021).
Potential climate change impacts in Cambridge will likely include increased snowfall, sea level rise,
storm surge, and more intense storm events. The projected sea level rise will exacerbate the
impact of severe winter storms, particularly when they coincide with high tides creating higher
coastal erosion and flooding. This could result in substantial damages from future nor'easters.
It is important for cities like Cambridge to prepare for the potential impacts of nor'easters, including
cumulative impact of back-to-back storms. It is crucial that the city considers increasing its
resilience to extreme weather events and investing in infrastructure and emergency management

plans that can help mitigate the effects of these storms. As design wind speeds have increased in
the last few years, it is crucial to consider the safety and stability of buildings and other structures
in the face of stronger winds. By taking proactive steps to prepare for future winter storms,
Cambridge can minimize the damage to their built infrastructure and protect the safety and wellbeing of their residents.
3.2.3.2. Probability
The probability of future winter storms and nor'easters are expected to increase in Cambridge
potentially causing more damage to the city than present day. The future flooding impacts from
winter storms and nor’easters combined with sea level rise and storm surge in the coastal areas
are included in the Massachusetts Coast Flood Model (MC-FRM) that has been adopted by the
City of Cambridge. The MC-FRM is a probabilistic based hydrodynamic flood model that provides
future probabilities of flooding from nor’easters, tropical storms, hurricanes for the 2030, 2050 and
2070 planning horizons. The model also factors respective sea level rise projections for each of the
future planning horizons. Based on the MC-FRM results, both the Amelia Earhart Dam and Charles
River Dam are likely to be flanked and overtopped in the future from sea level rise and extreme
storms, unless mitigation measures are implemented. Flooding may also stem from severe winter
weather including winter storms and nor’easters. The probability of flooding maps from MC-FRM
(final version as published by Woods Hole Group in September 2021) show that portions of
western Cambridge in the Alewife Brook sub-watershed have a likelihood of 50 to 70% annual
probability of flooding by 2070 and portions of eastern Cambridge in the lower Charles River subwatershed have a likelihood of annual probability of flooding between 5 to 10% by 2070.
3.2.3.3. Location
The future flooding impacts from winter storms and nor’easters because of climate change, as
discussed in the previous section, are likely to be citywide, with more frequent flooding expected to
occur in the western portions of the city in the Alewife area. Citywide impacts from winter storms
and nor’easters are also anticipated to cause damages to the built infrastructure.

3.3. Coastal Flooding as a Result of Dam
Failure
3.3.1 | Description
Dams are built structures that serve as artificial barriers for the storage or control of water (EEA &
EOPSS, 2018). The Massachusetts Department of Conservation & Recreation (DCR) defines dam
failure as the “collapse of an impounding structure resulting in an uncontrolled release of
impounded water from a dam” (DCR, 2017). Dam failure can occur in two primary ways;
catastrophic failure (which includes rapid release of the impounded water) or dam overtopping
(“caused by floods that exceed the capacity of the dam”). Dam overtopping is the cause for
approximately 34% of all dam failures in the U.S. (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). Non-breach flood risks
can also occur when downstream flooding occurs although the dam is functioning as designed

a

and does not fail. One example of a non-breach risk is dam flanking, occurring when water
proceeds to go beyond the dam by passing it on one or both sides.
The City of Cambridge currently relies on two dams for protection against coastal flood inundation:
the Amelia Earhart Dam, located along the Mystic River, and the New Charles River Dam, situated
at the head of the Charles River. While these two dams are both owned and operated by DCR,
instead of the city, their proximity and functionality provide key protection to Cambridge. These two
dams serve as vital infrastructure for the City of Cambridge to safeguard the community from the
effects of present-day storm surge and coastal inundation. Dam failure has not occurred
at the Amelia Earhart or New Charles River Dam since their establishment in
1965 and 1978, respectively. However, climate change projections of sea level rise and
storm surge published by the city as part of its Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment
(Cambridge, Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment, February 2017) project that both the dams
are likely to be flanked and overtopped by 2070. Based on this report (Cambridge, Climate
Change Vulnerability Assessment, February 2017), the Amelia Earhart Dam is likely to be flanked
as soon as 2030-2035 by a 500-year water surface elevation and by 2045-2050 by a 100-year
water surface elevation. The probability of complete failure of the Amelia Earhart Dam is unknown.
As a low hazard potential dam, there isn’t a Emergency Action Plan developed for the dam. Further
analysis would need to be conducted on the dam in order to determine the probability of failure.
The Charles River Dam is likely to be flanked as soon as 2045 by a 500-year water surface
elevation and by 2055-2060 by a 100-year water surface elevation. The Charles River Dam is likely
to be overtopped by 2050 by a 500-year water surface elevation and by 2065 by a 100-year water
surface elevation. With the more stringent sea level rise and storm surge projections adopted by
the State (EEA & MEMA, 2023) as part of the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM),
both these dams are likely to be flanked and overtopped sooner.
The salinity associated with these possible coastal flooding scenarios is cause for concern in
regard to Cambridge’s built infrastructure and natural resources (Cambridge, February 2017). If
saltwater moves upstream into the Alewife Brook area, including into the Fresh Pond Reservoir,
there could be significant impacts to the city’s drinking water systems. Above-ground components
of the water / stormwater system such as valves, hydrants, manhole covers, and pump stations
would also be susceptible to corrosion if exposed to salt water for prolonged periods of time
during flood events. Additionally, saline floodwaters may adversely affect the natural habitat and
ecology in Cambridge’s wetlands and natural areas.

Figure 3-6. Locus map of Cambridge and the two dam locations.
3.3.1.1. Extent
The Cambridge CCVA (Cambridge, Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment, February 2017)
states critical infrastructure systems – energy, roadways, public transit, telecommunications,
critical service facilities, and water/wastewater systems – located in the Fresh Pond/Alewife area
and in low-lying areas of the city linked to the Charles River are at increased risk from sea level
rise/storm surge (SLR/SS) driven coastal flooding after 2030. The Fresh Pond-Alewife area is an
area of particular concern due to the high probability of SLR/SS flooding and high depth of
flooding that could significantly impact priority populations, critical infrastructure, and community
resources. The stormwater and combined wastewater systems will likely be significantly impacted
by SLR/SS flooding as there are additional areas that are likely to reach capacity and fail due to
SLR/SS flooding compared to precipitation driven flooding alone.
The impacts of flooding from SLR/SS as a result of the flanking and overtopping of the dams have
significant regional consequences, beyond the city, in terms of disruptions to energy distribution,
transportation, and food services. Critical areas containing key infrastructure, such as the MBTA
Red Line, Alewife Brook Parkway, and subsequent access to Route 2, as well as residential and
vulnerable communities, can be highly impacted from the consequences of either or both of the
dams being flanked and overtopped.
Flooding can cause physical damage to buildings and infrastructure, which could make areas
inaccessible and create public safety hazards. Damages tend to increase with longer duration
flooding, which could occur if the pumps at the Charles River Dam and Amelia Earhart Dam are
not able to function properly during and after a storm. Analysis was done as part of CCVA Part II to
estimate the duration of flooding in the city from flanking and overtopping of the Amelia Earhart

Dam using the BH-FRM data (Cambridge, 2017). Similar analysis using the MC-FRM has not yet
been conducted to date. Saltwater flooding from SLR/SS also has the potential to cause long-term
impacts to vulnerable local and regional infrastructure, such as the MBTA Red Line, due to its
corrosive effects. Contamination from salt water or hazardous pollutants could also cause damage
to water resources, such the Fresh Pond Reservoir.
3.3.1.2. Probability
The coastal flooding results from SLR/SS simulated using the MC-FRM for 2030 (Figure 3.7
through Figure 3.9) show that majority of the areas in the Alewife Brook watershed have a 0.5-1%
annual probability of flooding by 2030, with areas north of the Alewife Brook can experience 1-2%
annual probability of flooding by 2030. Areas adjacent to the Fresh Pond have a less than 0.1%
annual probability of flooding by 2030. There is no coastal flooding in Eastern Cambridge around
the Charles River by 2030. Some locations between the New and Old Charles River dams in the
North Point area can experience less than 0.1% or between 0.1 to 0.2% annual probability of
flooding, as well as at some locations along the Cambridge Somerville border, where there is a 12% annual probability of flooding by 2030.

Figure 3-7: Probability and extent of coastal flooding by 2030, based on results from the
Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model (2021)
MC-FRM results for 2050 (Figure 3.8) shows that majority of the areas in the Alewife Brook
watershed have a 5-10% annual probability of flooding by 2050, with some areas north of the
Alewife Brook can experience as high as 70-90% annual probability of flooding by 2050. Areas

adjacent to the Fresh Pond have between 2-5% annual probability of flooding by 2050. The
Charles River and areas adjacent to the Charles River have 0.1- 0.5% annual probabilities of
flooding by 2050. Along the north bank of the Charles River in some locations and in the area
between the New and Old Charles River dams in the North Point, the annual probabilities of
flooding are as high as 2-5% by 2050.

Figure 3-8: Probability and extent of coastal flooding by 2050, based on results from the

MC-FRM results for 2070 (Figure 3.9) shows that majority of the areas adjacent to the Alewife
Brook have a 50-70% annual probability of flooding by 2070, with some areas adjacent to the
Alewife Brook likely to have 70-90% annual probability of flooding by 2070. The Charles River and
areas adjacent to the Charles River have 5-10% annual probabilities of flooding by 2070. Along the
north bank of the Charles River in locations between the New and Old Charles River dams in the

flooding through piped infrastructure in low-lying areas. Similarly, areas in Eastern Cambridge
neighborhoods are impacted from coastal flooding, with a combination of flooding from the lower
Charles River overtopping and propagated coastal flooding through piped infrastructure in lowlying areas. The extent of the floodplain will expand causing flooding in parcels that have not
experienced flooding in the past.

3.4. Hurricanes / Tropical Storms
3.4.1 | Description
Hurricanes originate from tropical storms, which form rotating cloud systems, developing over
tropical or subtropical waters. There are four classifications of these types of storms (tropical
cyclones) (National Hurricane Center, NOAA):
•
•
•
•

Tropical Depression: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (33
knots) or less.
Tropical Storm: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph (34
to 63 knots).
Hurricane: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or
higher. In the western North Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons; similar storms in the
Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean are called cyclones.
Major Hurricane: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 111 mph (96
knots) or higher, corresponding to a Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane
Wind Scale.

3.4.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)
There have been 57 hurricanes and tropical storms that have passed within 60 nautical miles of
Cambridge between 1851 and 2021. At the time they passed by Cambridge, these storms ranged
from extratropical storms, tropical depressions, and tropical storms, all the way to category 1
through category 3 hurricanes.

74 - 95 mph

Very dangerous winds will produce some damage: Wellconstructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl
siding and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap, and shallowly
rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and
poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several
days.

96 – 110

with outages that could last from several days to weeks.

111 – 130
mph

Devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may
incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many
trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity
and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm
passes.

131 – 155
mph

Catastrophic damage will occur: Well-built framed homes can
sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or
some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power
poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential
areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the
area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.

> 155 mph

Catastrophic damage will occur: A high percentage of framed
homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen
trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will
last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable
for weeks or months.

3.4.2.2. Frequency
According to NOAA’s Historical Hurricane Tracks tool, which is a public interactive mapping
application that displays Atlantic Basin and East-Central Pacific Basin tropical cyclone data, there
are 57 storms (including Extratropical, tropical storms, tropical depression and hurricanes
(Category 1 through 5) that have passed within 60 nautical miles of Cambridge between 1858 and
2021 (NOAA, 2023). The tracks of these storms are shown in Figure 3.11. While many of these
storms have not been direct hits for the city, some of the worst hurricanes that have impacted the
city include Hurricane Bob in 1991; "the twins" from 1954, Hurricanes Carol and Edna; and last but
not least, the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 (CZM, 2023). In more recent years,
Hurricanes Henri (2021), Hurricane Ida (2021) and Tropical Storm Elsa (2021) have caused
significant damage to Cambridge and the surrounding area.

between 1851 and 2021 (NOAA, 2023)
3.4.2.3. Location
Hurricanes have the potential to impact the entire City of Cambridge. During August 2011, Irene's
strong winds swept across Suffolk County, with frequent wind gusts of 35 to 55 mph, along with
locally stronger wind gusts exceeding 60 mph. In the case of Hurricane Sandy, the timing meant
the difference between millions of dollars of damage, as the storm passed by Boston 5 hours from
high tide. A 100-year storm event hitting Boston during the high tide, combined with the 21 inches
of sea level rise predicted for Boston by 2050, could result in $444 million in annual damages and
could put up to 43,000 Bostonians at risk (City of Boston, 2016a). Since 2012, Massachusetts has
experienced impacts from six tropical storms: Arthur, Hermine, Jose, Dorian, Andrea, and Fred.
The hurricane evacuation zone maps published by the Massachusetts Emergency Management
Agency (MEMA) provide an indication of the locations of relative flood risk from hurricanes and
tropical storms in MA. Figure 3.12 shows the hurricane evacuation zone map for the city of
Cambridge. Parts of western Cambridge, including the Alewife area are in Zone A, which includes
areas that, depending on predicted inundation, may flood first from storm surge during a tropical
storm or hurricane. Parts of eastern Cambridge are in Zone B, which includes areas that would
flood after areas in Zone A from storm surge during a tropical storm or hurricane. The cities of
Boston and Cambridge have also designated a third zone, Zone C, which may flood depending on
the track and intensity of the storm.

3.4.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.4.3.1. Extent
Climate change will increase the intensity of tropical cyclones including hurricanes, leading to
increased precipitation and storm surge in coastal communities (Ellen Douglas, 2022). The
frequency of hurricanes is less certain, with some projections indicating a decrease in overall
number but an increase in the proportion of the most intense category 4-5 hurricanes. The tracks
of hurricanes may also shift northward, potentially making the Northeast more vulnerable to higher
intensity storms that could cause a large amount of precipitation.
As a city located near the coast, Cambridge may be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of future
hurricanes. Estimated SLR and higher intensity storms coupled with precipitation will likely result in
damaging flood within the city during and after hurricanes especially if the rivers overflows their
banks or the dams overtop. High winds associated with hurricanes could cause extensive damage
to the city including downed trees and branches, structural damage, and power outages. Impacts
such as these would leave the city vulnerable if emergency routes became blocked, public
transportation was inaccessible, or cell service went down. Damage to infrastructure could leave
much of the population with no housing or means of transportation.
To mitigate the potential impacts of future hurricanes, it will be important for the City of Cambridge
to implement measures such as improving infrastructure, updating emergency response plans and

a

evacuation routes. It will also be important for individuals and businesses to take steps to prepare
for these events, such as developing evacuation plans and ensuring that homes and businesses
are protected against flooding.
3.4.3.2. Probability
As cited in the 2022 Climate Change Impacts and Projections for the Greater Boston Area Report,
while the overall frequency of hurricanes may remain the same or decrease, the impact of
individual storms may increase due to SLR, increased storm surge, wind damage, and extreme
precipitation (Ellen Douglas, 2022).
Future flooding impacts from hurricanes and tropical storms combined with sea level rise and
storm surge in the coastal areas are included in the Massachusetts Coast Flood Model (MC-FRM)
that has been adopted by the City of Cambridge. Based on MC-FRM, both the Amelia Earhart
Dam and Charles River Dam are likely to be flanked and overtopped in the future from sea level
rise and extreme storms, including hurricanes and tropical storms, which may result in portions of
western Cambridge in the Alewife Brook sub-watershed to likely flood between 50 to 70% annual
probability by 2070 and portions of eastern Cambridge in the lower Charles River sub-watershed to
likely flood between 5 to 10% annual probability by 2070.
3.4.3.3. Location
Future hurricanes are anticipated to impact the entire City of Cambridge. While storm winds have
the potential to damage the buildings and infrastructure across the city, flooding will impact
primarily the low-lying areas of the city.

3.5. Tornadoes
3.5.1 | Description
Tornadoes are narrow, violently rotating columns of air that extend from the base of a
thunderstorm to the ground. These windstorms develop when cool air overlays warm air, causing
the warm air to rise rapidly. They are visible when dust and debris are collected in the rotating
column.
Components that induce tornado formation include the following, (City of Cambridge & MAPC,
2015),
•
•
•
•
•

Very strong winds in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere
Clockwise turning of the wind with height (from southeast at the surface to west aloft)
Increasing wind speed with altitude in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere (i.e., 20
mph at the surface and 50 mph at 7,000 feet.)
Very warm, moist air near the ground with unusually cooler air aloft
A forcing mechanism such as a cold front or leftover weather boundary from previous
shower or thunderstorm activity

3.5.2.2. Frequency
Massachusetts has experienced approximately 190 tornadoes from 1950 to 2021, resulting in
about 2.7 tornadoes ever year. However, there has been an average frequency of 2.1 events per
year in the last 20 years (NCEI NOAA, 2023), and Middlesex County recorded 20 tornadoes
between 1950 and 2023 (NCEI NOAA, 2023). Tornadoes most commonly occur in the summer
months of June through August, forming in the afternoon or evening (City of Cambridge & MAPC,
2015).
This hazard is stated as having a 2-20% chance of occurrence per year, or a once in 5-50 years
chance of occurrence (City of Cambridge & MAPC, 2015).
3.5.2.3. Location
Tornadoes are a potential citywide threat to Cambridge. This is a concern as most structures in
Cambridge pre-date current building codes and could be subject to damages (City of Cambridge
& MAPC, 2015).

3.5.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.5.3.1. Extent
Climate change could lead to more frequent and intense tornadoes similar to the trends predicted
with severe thunderstorms (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). Tornadoes are short-lived and relatively smallscale weather events, making it challenging to capture them accurately in global climate models.
Additionally, tornadoes are influenced by many factors beyond just climate, including local weather
patterns, geography, and atmospheric conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to make accurate
predictions about the future frequency of tornadoes.
3.5.3.2. Probability
Based on currently available information, it is difficult to predict the probability of tornadoes in the
future. However, climate change is expected to increase extreme weather events. Therefore,
probability of tornadoes in Cambridge may increase in frequency and intensity under the influence
of climate change.
3.5.3.3. Location
Like other severe storms, tornadoes could impact the whole city and its built infrastructure.

3.6. Earthquake
3.6.1 | Description
Earthquakes originate from a vibration in the Earth’s surface, that results in a release of energy in
the Earth’s crust. This causes movement or trembling of the ground. Earthquakes generally occur
along fault boundaries but can also be induced within interior portions of a plate. Massachusetts
falls on the eastern edge of the North American plate, which is moving due to compressions and
squeezing of global plates (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
In addition to building collapse, earthquakes can cause structural damage to roadways, breakage
of water and gas lines, and flooding and fires. Furthermore, landslides can be triggered by
earthquakes.

3.6.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)
Between 1963 and 2023, approximately 76 earthquakes have occurred in Massachusetts (USGS,
2023). Table 3.18 indicates the earthquakes that have occurred in Massachusetts since 1963, their
depths (radius of impact), and their magnitudes (Richter Scale) (USGS, 2023). No earthquake has
ever been recorded as originating within Cambridge’s boundaries.

3.6.2.2. Frequency
The 2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan states that there is about a 10-15%
chance, over a ten-year period, that a magnitude 5.0 or greater earthquake could occur
somewhere in New England (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). The 2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate
Adaptation Plan further states that earthquake events occur with a 1-2% chance of occurrence per
year, or once in 50-100 years.
Based on the USGS 2014 Massachusetts Seismic Hazard map (Figure 3.13), Cambridge is also
stated to have an earthquake peak ground acceleration (PGA) that has a 2% chance of being
exceeded in 50 years, has a value between 14-20 %g (%g: percent of gravity (or, percentage of the
force we experience from gravity) (USGS, n.d.).

3.6.2.3. Location
Earthquakes are expected to be a citywide hazard event for Cambridge. However, certain areas of
the city are more susceptible to damages and liquefaction than others. Liquefaction is when
loosely packed, water-logged sediments lose strength and shift in large masses. Portions of
Cambridge, particularly the southern end along the Charles River, were built on non-engineered
artificial fill. Other sections of the city subsist on glacial outwash or glacial till. Both these soil types
are highly susceptible to liquefaction, which can be triggered with an earthquake magnitude of 5.0
or greater. Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14 depict the current geology and liquefaction potential.

3.6.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.6.3.1. Extent
Earthquakes are natural hazards that can occur at any time and without warning. While it is not
possible to predict exactly when and where an earthquake will occur, scientists can estimate the
probability of earthquake occurrences based on historical data and geological studies. According
to (NASA, 2019), "induced seismicity" can occur as a result of human water usage, which causes
changes in water levels at fault lines. This phenomenon has been observed in the vicinity of dams
in the United States, particularly when there are rapid fluctuations in the water level behind the
dam.
3.6.3.2. Probability
Although earthquakes cannot be predicted, the USGS 2014 Seismic Hazard Map helps identifying
areas that are more likely to experience earthquakes. For Cambridge, the map predicts moderate
peak gravity acceleration of 14 to 20 percent (Figure 3.13).
3.6.3.3. Location
Earthquakes will impact the entire city . Areas with soft soils or loose sediments and buildings with
weak foundation and poor seismic design are more vulnerable to earthquake damage due to their
tendency to amplify seismic waves.

3.7. Landslides
3.7.1 | Description
The U.S. Geological Survey describes landslides as including, “a wide range of ground movement,
such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows.” While gravity is a primary
instigator for a steepened slope becoming a landslide, other contributing factors exist. When
sloped material is subject to heavy rainfall or over-saturates in another way, debris or mud may
flow. The resultant flow can be dangerous to trees, houses, cars, and built infrastructure. This
effect can be exacerbated when erosion from rivers, glaciers, or waves create over steepened
slopes.

3.7.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)
There are no documented previous occurrences of landslides in Cambridge.
3.7.2.1. Extent
Landslides are measured in terms of intensity and velocity. Factors of landslide vulnerability
include location, type of human activity, use, and frequency of landslides. Hazards can be reduced
by avoiding construction on steep slopes and in locations of existing or known landslides, or by
first stabilizing these slopes. Refer to the table below for a description of the resultant volume of
moving land from the two qualitative measurements. This table can clarify the consequential
destructiveness of a landslide based on the aforementioned characteristics.

3.7.2.2. Frequency
Due to the lack of previous occurrences in Cambridge, landslides have a very low frequency of
occurrence. It is estimated that these events can occur less than 1% per year.
3.7.2.3. Location
Landslides have the potential to be a citywide hazard event, although the overall flat topography of
the city is generally not conducive for a landslide to occur. It is likely that if a landslide were to
occur in Cambridge, it would occur as a slow-moving slide rather than a fast moving rock fall. As
evident in Figure 3.15 below, the City of Cambridge is classified as the green, stable area, with a
very low relative slide ranking.

on factors of safety generated by SINMAP that indicates the probability that a location is stable considering the most and
least favorable parameters for stability input into the model. The breaks in the ranges of values for the stability index
categories are the default values recommended by the program developers.
Factors of Safety - The factor of safety is a dimensionless number computed by SINMAP using a modified version of the
infinite slope equation that represents the ratio of the stabilizing forces that resist slope movement to destabilizing forces
that drive slope movement (Pack et al., 2001). A FS>1 indicates a stable slope, a FS<1 indicates an unstable slope,
and a FS=1 indicates the marginally stable situation where the resisting forces and driving forces are in balance.

3

Probability of Instability - This column shows the likelihood that the factor of safety computed within this map unit is less
than one (FS<1, i.e., unstable) given the range of parameters used in the analysis. For example, a <50% probability of
instability means that a location is more likely to be stable than unstable given the range of parameters used in the
analysis.

4

Possible Influence of Stabilizing and Destabilizing Factors - Stabilizing factors include increased soil strength, root
strength, or improved drainage. Destabilizing factors include increased wetness or loading, or loss of root strength.

3.7.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.7.3.1. Extent
Climate change may lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of rainfall events, which
could cause soil saturation and erosion, potentially triggering landslide events (Gariano, 2016).
Furthermore, rapid snow melt and rain-on-snow events can also increase the risk of landslides.
3.7.3.2. Probability
Although Cambridge has a low frequency of landslides occurrence, climate change may increase
the likelihood of landslides in the area due to more frequent and intense storms, reduced
vegetation cover resulting from increased drought events, or increased urbanization.
3.7.3.3. Location
Landslides will be a citywide phenomenon particularly areas with low vegetation will likely to be
most affected by potential landslides. As can be seen in Figure 3.16 above, all of Cambridge has a
very low risk for landslides.

3.8. Tsunami
3.8.1 | Description
A tsunami is a devastating onshore surge of water or a string of waves created by the
displacement of a large volume of water (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). A tsunami may form following an
earthquake or volcanic activity occurring below or near the ocean floor, but can also be caused by
landslides, glacier calving, and meteorite impacts. Tsunamis can move hundreds of miles per hour
(mph) in the open ocean and can come ashore with waves as high as 100 feet or more (EEA &
EOPSS, 2018). As they approach shallower water and land, tsunamis are often no more than 10 ft
in height, and slow to speeds of 20 to 30 mph (NOAA, 2018).
The previous Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan 2015 Update did not include mention of tsunamis,
likely due to the rarity of occurrence for the city, as the city is located inland of direct coastal
exposure.

3.8.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)
Research conducted by NOAA and USGS, for the United States and Territories National Tsunami
Hazard Assessment, Historical Record and Sources for Waves – Update, indicates that there have
been two occurrences of a tsunami in Massachusetts: one of an undetermined height and one
with wave runup between 0.01 and 0.3 meters. The report indicates the runup event was

earthquake-triggered (NOAA & USGS, 2015). There is no documentation that these events
affected the City of Cambridge.

Figure 3-16: Runup events along the East Coast of the U.S. (NOAA & USGS, 2015)
3.8.2.1. Extent
The severity of these two occurrences in Massachusetts were minimal, with no reported deaths or
damages (NOAA & USGS, 2015). There has been no threat of a significant tsunami for the coast of
Massachusetts in recent history (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
3.8.2.2. Frequency
The frequency of occurrence of a tsunami in Massachusetts is 1 event every 39 years (EEA &
EOPSS, 2018), with 0.01 total events per year and all tsunami runups of less than 1.0 m (NOAA &
USGS, 2015).
3.8.2.3. Location
If a tsunami were to occur, the geographic location of the tsunami could potentially result in an
impact to a significant part of the city, depending on the runup (NOAA & USGS, 2015). It is more
likely that locations within Cambridge likely to experience coastal flooding will be the area
impacted.

3.8.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.8.3.1. Extent
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and landslides can trigger tsunamis. As a
result of melting ice and collapsing glaciers, earthquakes, landslides, and submarine landslides
are expected to increase, potentially leading to more frequent or stronger tsunamis. Additionally,
isotonic rebound and glacier earthquakes caused by a warmer climate could trigger additional
tsunamis in the future (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). Currently, there is no information available about the
likelihood of a destructive tsunami occurring along the Massachusetts coastline. The existence of
two dams may protect Cambridge from some coastal impacts, including the potential to lessen
damage from a tsunami. However, the extent of damage would be dependent on the magnitude of
the tsunami.
3.8.3.2. Probability
Given the infrequency of tsunami occurrences along the East Coast, the probability of tsunamis
affecting Cambridge is very low.
3.8.3.3. Location
Depending on the magnitude of a tsunami, it could have the potential to impact all of Cambridge,
or locations within Cambridge likely to experience coastal flooding.

3.9. Extreme Temperatures
3.9.1 | Description
Temperatures are considered extreme when they extend outside of the typical range of average
conditions for acute or prolonged periods of time. Extremes can vary seasonally and occur in the
form of either extreme cold or extreme heat. These temperature extremes can affect everyday life
for the city and its residents. Hazard events can trigger issues for public and environmental health,
economic activities, electrical grids, and reliable transportation. While Massachusetts has a climate
of four well-defined seasons with varying temperature averages, extremes outside of these
seasonal fluctuations can cause major problems for the city.

3.9.2.3. Extent
Extreme Heat
Relative humidity can worsen human health effects as temperatures increase. The extent of
extreme heat temperatures is generally measured through the NWS Heat Index, which is based
both on temperature and relative humidity, and describes a temperature equivalent to what a
person would feel at a baseline humidity level. Figure 3.19 presents the heat index chart as
published by NOAA National Weather Service. Understanding this relationship is helpful for
measuring or predicting the impact of high temperatures and humidity on human health. Often
coined the “feels like” temperature, the heat index is an indicator of heat stress on the human
body.

Figure 3-17. National Weather Service Heat Index (NWS NOAA)
Heat wave is an extreme heat phenomenon that affects the city. Heat waves are identifiable as 3
or more consecutive days when maximum temperatures greater than 90°F occur. This implies that

there is an extended period of unusually high temperatures, causing stress on everyday operations
and physical health (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
Another extreme heat phenomenon that is relevant for the City of Cambridge is the urban heat
island (UHI) effect. The term “heat island” describes built-up areas that are hotter than nearby rural
or shaded areas. An urban environment like the city also exacerbate the effects of extreme heat
through the presence of impervious surfaces. Increased tree canopy and other engineered green
infrastructure solutions, such as bioretention basins, rain gardens, green roofs, and highly
reflective surfaces, as well as built shade structures have the potential to reduce the UHI effect in
Cambridge. The city’s UHI provides additional detail.
Extreme Cold
Extreme cold temperatures can be exacerbated by factors such as wind and relative humidity. The
extent of extreme cold temperatures is generally measured through the Wind Chill Temperature
Index, and Figure 3.18 shows the Wind Chill Temperature Index. As evident from the figure,
temperatures can feel colder and cause more damage to human health as wind speeds increase.
Wind Chill Temperature is the temperature that people and animals feel when they are outside, and
it is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin by the effects of wind and cold. As wind
increases, the body loses heat at a faster rate, causing the skin’s temperature to drop. The NWS
issues a Wind Chill Advisory if the Wind Chill Index is forecast to dip to –15°F to – 24°F for at least 3
hours, based on sustained winds (not gusts). For example, frostbite can occur in 30 minutes at
warmer than usual temperatures if wind speeds are greater.

3.9.2.4. Frequency
Extreme Heat
The 2018 SHMCAP states that two extreme hot weather events have occurred annually in
Massachusetts (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). Additionally, from 1971 to 2000, there have historically been
an average of 11 days per year over 90O F, and only one day over 100O F every seven years or so
(City of Cambridge and ATMOS, 2015). In 2022, the hottest 30 day stretch on record was recorded
in the Boston metro area with over 26 days of temperatures over the 80O F (Epstein, 2022).
Extreme Cold
The 2018 SHMCAP states that 1.5 extreme cold weather events have occurred annually in
Massachusetts (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
3.9.2.5. Location
Extreme Heat
Extreme heat is often more extreme in concentrated parts of the city that have less tree canopy,
more pavement, and dark surfaces such a roofs that absorb more heat, as evident in Figure 3.20
and Figure 3.21.

A critical measure for temperature is the heat index, which combines ambient air temperature and
relative humidity to determine the “feels-like” or the human-perceived temperature. Heat index is a
key indicator for reporting public health concerns since heat index exceeding 91oF is considered to
be in the “extreme caution” zone from prolonged exposure to heat or strenuous activity.

Figure 3-20. Estimated Heat Index Relative to 93oF under 2018 canopy, impervious surface and cool
roof conditions (City of Cambridge, 2022)
Extreme Cold
Extreme cold can occur city-wide. Extreme cold can disproportionately affect priority community
members through the city, especially for people without shelter, those who are stranded, and those
who live in home that are poorly insulated or without heat.

3.9.3.1. Extent
Extreme Heat
Based on all the recently published reports (IPCC, MA Climate Assessment, GBRAG) temperatures
will continue to increase through the 21st century. Summers are expected to get hotter with a
higher number of days with maximum temperature above 90°F and above 100oF.

The following figure (Figure 3.22) shows the future warming scenarios from Cambridge CCVA (City
of Cambridge and ATMOS, 2015). As shown in the report, annual average temperatures and winter
temperature are projected to increase by 8°F, whereas summer temperature is estimated to
increase up to 10°F by 2070 under high emission scenarios. Both the number of days above 90°F
and 100°F are estimated to increase considerably by 2070. Summer temperature is estimated to
increase up to 10°F by 2070 under high emission scenarios. The graphic from CCVA report (Figure
3.22) shows the relative changes in high heat days over the three-month summer period (June,
July, August) in the future. As depicted in the figure, if the warmest days of the year only occurred
during the summer months of June through August, it is possible that temperatures in Cambridge
could surpass 90°F for majority of the summer.
Figure 31 shows baseline and projected temperature of Cambridge (City of Cambridge and

Figure 3-22: Relative increase in projected days above 90F and 100F over a three-month period as
shown in Cambridge CCVA (City of Cambridge and ATMOS, 2015)
The state has recently published updated climate projections in ResilientMA ( (MA EOEEA, 2021)
from MA EEA’s Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project (Phase 1). The projections in ResilientMA are
based on higher emission scenario (RCP8.5) and the data is available at the HUC-8 basin scale.
The updated numbers are reported in Table 3.23 for heat related climate parameters for the
Charles River Basin. The inference from the data still remains the same as the CCVA report namely
that the annual, summer, and winter average temperatures are estimated to increase by the end of
the century. Summer is anticipated to be hotter by up to 39 more number of days above 90°F by
2070.
Additionally, updated viewer also provide data of heat stress events which is defined as a number
of instances when a 3-day moving average of temperature is above 86 °F (MA EOEEA, 2021). Heat
stress event is an indicator of extreme heat events that cause heat-related illnesses (Department of
Health, New York State, 2020). Number of heat stress events is projected to increase up to 6
events per year by 2070 and 11 events per year by 2090. The impact of heat stress will be more
pronounced in cities like Cambridge where built infrastructure dominates the landscape and lower
amounts of shade is available.

In Massachusetts, the winters are projected to get warmer with a smaller number of sub-zero days.
As shown in Figure 3.22 above, annual average temperatures and winter temperatures are
projected to increase by 8°F. The winter is estimated to become warmer, and we may see up to 57
fewer days below sub-zero.
3.9.3.2. Probability
Extreme Heat
Extreme heat is highly probable to impact the city in the future. The urban environment of
Cambridge with higher impervious surfaces and lower canopy coverage and shade structures is
particularly responsible for high heat impacts.
Extreme Cold
Although extreme cold weather events are predicted to decrease in frequency, the city should
remained prepared to respond to these events.

Although high heat is anticipated to impact the entire City of Cambridge, parts of the city are more
vulnerable than others. Figure 3.23 (top) shows the urban heat island (UHI) variability in the city
when the average temperature for that day is 95oF, which is a scenario that is likely to occur more
frequently by 2030 and 2050. Figure 3.23 (bottom) also shows the UHI variability in the city when
the average temperature for that day is 100oF, which is a scenario that is likely to occur more
frequently by 2070 and 2090 (City of Cambridge, 2015). As illustrated in the figures, the heat
impacts will be more concentrated in the NW and SE corners of the city.

Drought

3.10.1 | Description
Drought is an extended duration of time characterized by below normal levels of precipitation. The
duration of drought can vary widely and can occur in virtually all climatic zones, with different
conditions based on the region-specific precipitation normals. Drought differs from aridity, in which
a region experiences low precipitation as a typical or permanent characteristic of the climate (i.e., a
desert).
Drought is classified in Massachusetts by the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA),
through recommendations provided by the Drought Management Task Force (DMTF). The DMTF
is comprised of members of EEA and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency
(MEMA). The DMTF gathers information about current drought conditions, makes
recommendations to governing officials, and manages responses. To aid in understanding and
disseminating information about drought across the State, the Massachusetts Drought
Management Plan (MA DMP) was adopted in September 2019. The plan states that its goal is to
“minimize drought impacts to the Commonwealth by improving agency coordination; enhancing
monitoring and early drought warning capabilities; and outlining preparedness, response, and
recovery activities for state agencies, local communities, and other entities affected by drought”
(EEA & MEMA, 2019).

3.10.2 | Previous Occurrences of Hazard Event(s)
3.10.2.1. Extent
The MA DMP classifies drought into five levels, based on six drought indices.

Frequency
The US Drought Monitor (USDM) defines the frequency of occurrence of a drought event in
percentiles, “relative to all historical measured events… to gage the severity of a measurement at
individual stations and to gage the severity of overall drought” (EEA & MEMA, 2019). Percentile
ranges are therefore assigned for each drought level, allowing for the comparison of data across
locations. Described in Table 3.24 are the percentile ranges, as classified by the MA DMP and
USDM. Table 3.25 and Table 3.26 indicate the drought status for Massachusetts since 1929.

3.10.2.2. Location
Drought is classified by the Drought Management Task Force of the EEA Water Resources
Commission. The Drought Management Plan (EEA & MEMA, 2019) divides the state into seven
regions: Western, Central, Connecticut River Valley, Northeast, Southeast, Cape, and Islands. The
City of Cambridge is located within Middlesex County, and therefore, the Northeast Drought
Region. The city’s drinking water supply sources including the Hobbs Brook Reservoir Subbasin
and the Stony Brook Reservoir Subbasin are located outside of the city in Lexington, Lincoln,
Weston, and Waltham, which are also part of the Northeast Drought Region. In addition, the city
has the ability to pivot between city sources and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
(MWRA) water supply as a source, of which many reservoirs are outside of the Northeast Region,
and therefore drought status may be different than the status within Cambridge.

3.10.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.10.3.1. Extent
Climate change is anticipated to intensify drought conditions due to rising air temperatures and
changes in precipitation patterns. Although overall precipitation is predicted to increase, the
frequency of rain events is expected to decrease, leading to prolonged dry periods that elevate the
likelihood of drought conditions (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
2022 Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment uses projected number of events of
consecutive dry days and projected annual total number of days without rain as the two primary
indicators for future drought predictions. The following table (Table 3.27) shows the projected
change in these two parameters over time (MA EOEEA, 2021). Both parameters indicate that
number of dry days (annual and consecutive) will increase by three to six percent (3-6%).

3.10.3.2. Probability
Predicting the probability of drought in the future can be complex and uncertain, as it depends on
a variety of factors, including the climate conditions, land use practices, and geographic location.
However, with climate change resulting in a higher number of dry days, the probability of drought
is projected to increase. The likelihood of droughts lasting one to three months could increase by
up to 75% by the end of the century in Northeastern States under a high emissions scenario (EEA
& EOPSS, 2018).
3.10.3.3. Location
Cambridge will continue to be impacted by drought on a citywide scale. In addition the public
water supply for Cambridge is located outside jurisdictional boundaries and has the potential to be
impacted by drought.

3.11.

Wildfire / Brush Fire

3.11.1 | Description
A brushfire is considered an uncontrolled fire in vegetative wildland areas primarily burning
underbrush, such as grass, shrub, leaf litter, and downed limbs.
Wildfires, or expansive fires burning large swathes of forested land, are considered an indirect
hazard to Cambridge. A wildfire is not likely to occur within Cambridge, but impacts from wildfires
including air quality decreases, have been experienced in recent years.
Note that Cambridge is also susceptible to urban conflagrations, which are large building to
building fires that spread over a relatively large urban area. This type of fire is not considered a
natural hazard but can be ignited by a natural hazard event.

3.11.2.1. Extent
Wildfire and brushfire data for Cambridge was collected from the LANDFIRE program, which
provides information on vegetation, wildland fuel, and fire regimes across the United States
(LANDFIRE, 2020). This dataset represents different types of fuel sources for wildfires and is based
on 13 Anderson Fire Behavior Fuel (FBF) Models, with each value representing a different type of
fuel. The FBFM 3, 11, 12, and 13 values represent fuel for rapidly spreading, high-intensity fires,
while FBFM 4, 7, and 10 represent fuel for moderate to quickly spreading intense fires, and FBFM
2, 6, and 9 represent fuel for low flame, moderately paced spreading fires. The values of FBFM 1,
5, and 8 represent fuel for very low-intensity fires that are not easily spread.

Most of Cambridge is not exposed to landfire, with FBF 1, 2, and 8 types being the most common
types of fire in the city (Figure 3.25). The data shows that the areas along the bank of the Charles
River, Alewife Brook, and Fresh Pond Reservation are more prone to fire than the rest of the city.
The marshy land in the Alewife brook area is prone to FBF 3, 8, and 10 fires, while Fresh Pond
Reservation is prone to FBF 1 fires. The Cambridge Cemetery is also prone to FBF 1 fires, while
Danehy Park is prone to FBF 2 fires. Harvard University Law School and surrounding areas are
prone to FBF 3 fires, and the MIT campus area is prone to FBF 2 fires.

3.11.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.11.3.1. Extent
As has already been seen in the western United States and Canada, increased temperatures
coupled with longer periods of drought causes larger and more destructive wildfires. Increased
temperatures due to climate change can create drier conditions, promoting evaporation of
moisture from vegetation and soils. This can result in more frequent and intense wildfires and the
fuel becomes more susceptible to ignition. An increase in fuel, including dried brush and dead
vegetation, will allow for fire to spread more rapidly. As discussed previously, climate change can
alter precipitation patterns, leading to more prolonged droughts. Drought reduces water supply,
which may impact firefighters’ ability to respond to fires. Increased hot temperatures in summer
months will cause the power system to become overloaded and more likely to start a fire, while
other changes in atmospheric circulation patterns have the potential to spread wildfires more
quickly due to higher wind speed (EPA, 2022).

3.11.3.2. Probability
The probability of land fires is anticipated to increase due to climate change. As described in the
SHMCAP, rising temperatures and changes in precipitation may lead to increased risk of seasonal
drought during summer and fall in the Northeast. In addition, higher temperatures lead to greater
evaporation and earlier winter and spring snowmelt. Drought and warmer temperatures will
increase the risk of wildfire and brush fire, by causing vegetated areas to dry out and become
more flammable. Research has found that frequency of lightning strikes could increase 12 percent
for every degree of Celsius of warming, further increasing the probability of brush fire due to a
lightning strike. (EEA & EOPSS, 2018)
3.11.3.3. Location
The location of potential landfires within the City of Cambridge is only anticipated to change if
extent of the city’s urban forest, parks, gardens, and natural areas, change, as these are the areas
likely to be impacted by the increased potential for brush fire.

Pests and Invasive Species

3.12.1 | Description
The term invasive species can apply to both flora and fauna. This section will focus on plants and
insects (referred to as pests) specifically. The Massachusetts Invasive Plant Advisory Group
(MIPAG) was founded in 1995 by the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to
inform the Commonwealth about the presence and management of invasive species. MIPAG
defines invasive species as meeting the following four base criteria (MIPAG, 2022):
•
•
•
•

non-indigenous to Massachusetts,
demonstrates the potential for rapid and widespread dispersion and establishment,
has the potential to disperse over spatial gaps,
exists in high numbers in natural habitats.

Often invasive species cause harm to local ecosystems, as they develop self-sustaining
populations that become dominant and disruptive to native species. Invasive species often do not
have natural predators and therefore are not restricted in their new habitat – monopolizing natural
communities and causing economic and environmental damages (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
Pests exacerbate the problems that invasive plant species pose. Pests often prey on native plant
species, causing pre-mature death and creating gaps in the eco-system for invasive species to fill.
Certain pests, while not necessarily detrimental to the environment, can pose a threat to public
health.

The City of Cambridge completed a citywide urban forest master planning effort in 2019 that
reviewed existing species composition and diversity and examined potential changes to the
canopy over time as a result of various climatic factors including heat, drought, and introduction of
new pests (CUFMP, 2019). This plan provides specific species composition recommendations for
future plantings to help achieve species diversity goals in the city through minimizing the potential
impacts of pests. It also outlines pest management strategies for both plants and insects, with the
ultimate goal of eradicating many invasive species from Cambridge’s ecosystem.
Ticks and mosquitos are not generally harmful to the environment, but instead pose a risk to
human health. Rather than eradicate these pests entirely, close monitoring and public awareness
campaigns can be an effective protection strategy for the public.
Deer ticks, dog ticks, and Lonestar ticks are species of ticks found in Massachusetts that attach to
animals or people that come into direct contact with them (MA DPH, 2023). Deer ticks are
responsible for spreading Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, Borrelia miyamotoi, and
Powassan virus. Dog ticks are responsible for spreading Rocky Mountain spotted fever and certain
types of tularemia. Lone star ticks are not a significant source of human illness in Massachusetts at
this time but are capable of spreading tularemia, ehrlichiosis and southern tick-associated rash
illness. One of the most important forms of prevention is checking for ticks once a day on your
body.
Mosquitos can spread diseases to humans, including West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) in Massachusetts (MA DPH, 2023). Only a small number of mosquitoes are
infected at any given time, so being bitten by a mosquito does not mean you will get sick.
However, the best way to avoid both of these illnesses is to prevent mosquito bites using insect
repellent, wearing full coverage clothing, and removing standing water from areas around your
home. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has released a Risk Map and Reporting
form for EEE and WNV that residents can use to live track positive samples over time (MA DPH,
2023). Several counties in Massachusetts show Low or Moderate Risk for both diseases.
Additionally, the CDC has identified malaria cases in Florida and Texas (CDC, 2023). While no
malaria cases have presently been identified in Massachusetts, potential spreading of the disease
is being closely monitored by CDC.
3.12.2.1. Extent
The damage rendered by pests and invasive species can be significant. Invasive species can
trigger a wide-ranging cascade of lost ecosystem services and can reduce the resilience of
ecosystems to future hazards by placing a constant stress on the system. (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).
Increased spread of disease through ticks and mosquitos can also be a significant detriment to
public health across the city, particularly if residents are discouraged from being active outdoors.
3.12.2.2. Frequency
It is difficult to quantify the frequency of invasive species occurring because their presence is
ongoing rather than a series of discrete events. Invasive species have the ability to travel long
distances (either via natural mechanisms or accidental human interference), which allows these
species to propagate rapidly and therefore has increased the frequency of threat over the years.
(EEA & EOPSS, 2018) In water systems, invasive species can quickly spread once introduced, as
there are generally no physical barriers to prevent establishment, outside of physiological
tolerances, and there are many opportunities for transport to new locations. (EEA & EOPSS, 2018)

3.12.2.3. Location
Invasive species are a widespread problem throughout Massachusetts and are a citywide issue for
Cambridge. The geographic extent of invasive species varies greatly depending on the species in
question and other factors, including habitat and the range of the species. (EEA & EOPSS, 2018).

3.12.3 | Probability of Future Hazard Events due to Climate
Change
3.12.3.1. Extent
Invasive species distribution and migration will be impacted by climate change. Climate change
may increase the growing season and growth during spring and fall, which typically favors invasive
species and generalists over native species, reducing biodiversity. In urban areas like Cambridge,
invasive species could cause damage to infrastructure and impact human health by outcompeting
native species for resources. The warming climate may also accelerate the movement,
consumption, dispersion, and generation time of pests, pathogens, and invasive species,
benefiting their proliferation (Dukes, 2009). Global trade and travel have created pathways for
exotic species to spread, and non-native species accustomed to warmer climates may proliferate
northward as the climate warms.
Changing climatic conditions could shift suitable habitats for native species, increase the risk of
new species introductions, create competition from established invaders, and lengthen the peak
periods for tick and mosquito activity, potentially resulting in losses in native biodiversity and
culturally important species as well as increasing risk to public health. Increased presence of
pests, invasive species and land use change may also harm native aquatic species and
ecosystems, alter water quality, and impact recreational activities.
3.12.3.2. Probability
Estimated increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may impede the recovery of ecosystems
after significant disruptions, increasing the likelihood of successful establishment or expansion of
invasive species (EEA & EOPSS, 2018). As a result, probability of damage caused by pests and
invasive species is likely to increase in the future.
3.12.3.3. Location
Pests and invasive species will continue to be a citywide issue for Cambridge. The citywide urban
forest, parks, gardens, natural areas, and waterbodies are particularly likely to be impacted by the
increased populations of pests and invasive species due to climate change.

4. Inventory of Community Assets
This section provides an inventory of the community assets that are important to the City of
Cambridge and paints a picture of a vibrant community with diverse people, buildings, structures,
systems, and important resources which make Cambridge unique. Reducing the vulnerability of
these assets to natural hazards is critical to the city’s neighborhoods, businesses, operations, and
economy, and to ensure its longevity. Assets discussed in this chapter are further assessed for
their vulnerability to natural hazards in Chapter 5. Actions the City intends to take to mitigate the
impacts from natural hazards are discussed in Chapter 7.

4.1. Categories of Community Assets
Assets are defined broadly as anything that is important to the character and function of a
community (FEMA, 2023). These can be built, natural, or non-physical elements. They range from
emergency facilities and critical infrastructure to community events that help shape collective
identity and social cohesion. Below are asset categories, community lifelines, and the list of
assets. This analysis is the first step in identifying who or what is vulnerable and developing a plan
for future resilience.

4.1.1 | Overarching Categories
Assets are organized into the following categories which represent the wide variety of
perspectives, purposes, and goals that asset categories can include and are based on the
categories outlined in FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Handbook.

Critical Facilities

People

These facilities are critical for life safety and the economy. The operation
of these facilities during and after a disaster is crucial. Their ability to
keep functioning affects both the severity of the impacts and the speed
of recovery.
Assets that serve populations that are more vulnerable to disaster (e.g.,
elderly, children, visiting populations) and/or serve densely populated
areas. Areas with greater population density, or populations less able to
respond and/or recover during a natural hazard. This includes priority
populations, such as people of color, tribal and Indigenous
communities, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people
experiencing homelessness, the elderly, underserved communities, or
those without access to transportation. In Cambridge, this category
includes many of the aforementioned groups, in addition to a large and
transient student population. Cambridge is also mindful of those with
disabilities, those with limited proficiency in English, those living below
the poverty line, and those with low educational attainment (Cambridge,
Resilient Cambridge, 2021; Cambridge, Resilient Cambridge, Resilient
People, 2021).

a

4-3
Packet Pg. 138

Structures

New and existing buildings, as well as built facilities that provide
community lifeline services which help the community respond to and
recover from natural hazards. Consider the type of building (residential,
commercial, industrial, etc.) as well as the age and construction type of
the structure. In Cambridge, important structures include the hospitals,
fire stations, police stations, schools, and universities.

Systems

A collection of components that perform a critical service for the
community. These are networks and capabilities of the community. The
loss or breakdown of these components due to a natural hazard could
increase community vulnerability and damage. Common systems
include roadways or transportation systems such as subways or bus
routes. In Cambridge, important systems include the MBTA, drinking
water, stormwater, and wastewater systems.

Natural, Historic,
and Cultural
Resources

Features that add value to the community through education,
community connection, sense of belonging, connection to nature, and
community protection through natural systems. These assets enhance
the quality of life in a community. They also help the local economy
through agriculture, tourism, and recreation. They support ecosystem
services and build the economy. These assets include places of
worship, places of recreation, public art, and open space areas. In
Cambridge, examples of these include Harvard Square and the
Memorial Church of Harvard University.

Economy

Activities that
have value to the
community

After a disaster, economic resiliency is one of the major drivers of a
speedy recovery. Economic assets can have direct or indirect losses.
For example, building or inventory damage is a direct loss. Functional
downtime and loss of wages are indirect losses. Economic assets are
defined as entities that produce a financial benefit for the community.
Assets in place that benefit the community by increasing community
morale and well-being. In Cambridge, these include community events,
such as the Cambridge Arts Council Dance Party and the River Festival,
the Cambridge Jazz Festival, Harvard Square’s May Fair, Danehy Park
Day, and the Boston Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival. These also
include long-standing traditions such as the Head of the Charles and
other activities such as the City of Cambridge Farmers Markets or
Community Garden Program.

4.1.2 | FEMA’s “Community Lifelines”
“Community Lifelines” is FEMA’s term for assets that the community cannot survive without. “A
lifeline enables the continuous operation of critical government and business functions and is
essential to human health and safety or economic security” (FEMA, 2020).
For the purposes of hazard mitigation planning and the asset inventory developed for this plan,
community lifelines are used to categorize all assets in terms of these critical functions. Not all
assets are community lifelines.
A subset of the City of Cambridge’s Assets falls into one of eight lifelines that have been classified
and described as follows (FEMA, 2019)

Law enforcement and government services, as well as the associated assets
that maintain communal security, provide search and rescue, evacuations, and
firefighting capabilities, and promote responder safety.

Support systems that enable the sustainment of life, such as water treatment,
transmission, and distribution systems; food retail and distribution networks;
and wastewater collection and treatment systems.

Infrastructure and service providers for medical care, public health, patient
movement, fatality management, behavioral health, veterinary support, and
health or medical supply chains.

Service providers for electric power infrastructure, composed of generation,
transmission, and distribution systems, as well as gas and liquid fuel
processing, transportation, and delivery systems. Disruptions can have a
limiting effect on the functionality of other community lifelines.
Infrastructure owners and operators of broadband internet, cellular networks,
landlines, cable services, satellite communications services, and broadcast
networks (radio and television). Communications systems encompass a large
set of diverse modes of delivery and technologies (e.g., translations and
meeting accessibility standards, etc.), often intertwined but operating
independently. Services include elements such as alerts, warnings, and
messages, as well as 911 and dispatch. Also includes accessibility of financial
services.

Multiple modes of transportation often serve complementary functions and
create redundancy, adding to the inherent resilience in overall transportation
networks. Transportation infrastructure includes highways/roadways, mass
transit, railway, aviation, maritime, and intermodal systems.
Systems that mitigate threats to public health/welfare and the environment. This
includes assessment of facilities that use, generate, and store hazardous
substances, as well as specialized conveyance assets and efforts to identify,
contain, and remove incident debris, pollution, contaminants, oil, or other
hazardous substances.
Systems for Potable Water and Wastewater Management. This includes
potable water intake, treatment, storage, and distribution. It also includes
wastewater collection, storage, treatment, and discharge (EPA, 2023).

4.2. City of Cambridge Assets
Community assets were identified for the City of Cambridge using the city’s most recent
geographic information system mapping available publicly on the City’s website, assets identified
in the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment work completed in 2015 and 2017, assets
identified as critical for continuous power needs, and the latest U.S. Census. Appendix E includes
maps showing city assets.

4.2.1 | Critical Facilities in Cambridge
There is a list of critical facilities within the City of Cambridge to which Eversource prioritizes
providing electrical power. This prioritization of service includes restoring access to the grid as fast
as possible and, when delays are considered too significant, providing emergency on-site backup
power in the form of mobile generators. The list of critical facilities may adjust from year to year but
as of 2023, includes 32 locations that consist of:
• Major transportation facilities and structures.
• Utility facilities related to gas and telecommunications.

City buildings such as City Hall, emergency response buildings for police and fire and
emergency operations, including public works.
Public health facilities such as hospitals, assisted living, and rehabilitation.
Emergency shelter locations.
Public water supply facilities and structures.

All these assets are considered community lifelines.

4.2.2 | “People” Assets
“People” assets include be populations in that may be less able to prepare, respond and/or
recover before, during and after a disaster, and the facilities that serve populations that are more
vulnerable to disaster (e.g., elderly, children, visiting populations) and/or serve densely populated
areas. Section 4.2.2.1 discusses the populations in Cambridge that are considered “people”
assets. Section 4.2.2.2 discusses the physical facilities that serve these populations.

4.2.2.1. Populations
According to the latest U.S. Census, the City of Cambridge has a population of just over 118,000
people, which is a 12.5% increase since the year 2010. The 2020 Census recorded 49,564
occupied housing units, with an average household size of approximately 2.1 persons. Cambridge
has a population density of over 18,500 people per square mile and 7,500 housing units per
square mile. According to the 2017-21 American Community Survey, as of 2021, Cambridge is the
tenth most densely populated city in the United States.
Priority populations are more vulnerable to natural hazards due to factors such as mobility
restrictions, emergency communications language barrier, and existing health conditions. It is also
more challenging for priority populations to recover from disastrous scenarios due to economic
limitations. Examples of priority populations in Cambridge include (United States Census Bureau,
2023):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Youth (just over 4% of the population is under 5 and just over 12% of the population is
under 18, per the 2020 U.S. Census)
Persons 65 years and older (just over 11 percent of the city’s population falls into this
category)
Veterans (approximately 1,500 veterans in the city)
Foreign born (almost 30% of the population)
Those who speak a language other than English at home (approximately 35% of the
population over 5 years old)
Renters (almost 2/3 of the population rent)
Those who do not have a computer (4% of households) and those who do not have an
internet subscription (almost 10%)
Persons in poverty (just over 12%)
Persons with a disability, under the age of 65 (almost 5%)

The Resilient Cambridge plan included a study of some of the priority population characteristics
per neighborhood of the city (Cambridge, 2021). Neighborhoods are shown in Figure 4.1. Table
4.1 summarizes the percentage of the population with a specific population characteristic for each
city neighborhood based on the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates for 2018.

Figure 4-1: Map of Cambridge neighborhoods, by Cambridge CDD
These populations might not be able to recover from one hazard, or might just barely recover from
one when there's another, setting them back again, with follow on impacts for ability to remain or
be secure in retirement, afford healthcare, age in place, etc.

4.2.3 | “Structure” Assets
“Structure” assets are built facilities including residential, commercial, and industrial facilities that
may be in harm’s way during a hazard event. Many of these structures provide community lifeline
services. Cambridge is a highly urbanized and densely developed community where much of the
land area is occupied by existing residential neighborhoods, commercial corridors, and districts,
open space, and recreational spaces. Some land is protected as conservation land and
undevelopable wetlands. Development occurring now and in the future in the city is largely infill
development and redevelopment (City of Cambridge & MAPC, 2015). Appendix E includes maps
showing city assets.
4.2.3.1. Development Since Previous Hazard Mitigation Plan
While the city is built out, there has been some development since completion of the previous
Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2015. Development is tracked for the City of Cambridge to identify
buildout trends and determine where new development is feasible, which was identified during the
City’s planning process called Envision Cambridge, which provides a guide for sustainable
development in the city. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council tracks development statistics
using its Massbuilds database. Since the end of 2014, 191 buildings were completed across the

multi-family housing units.
(b) Commercial square footage includes, but is not limited to, general commercial, retail,
industrial, hotel, research and development, office space.
In addition to housing, the development of the commercial and retail sector has grown.
Neighborhoods such as Kendall Square have experienced a tremendous amount of technology and
R&D growth during the last few years. However, small businesses in Cambridge and the region were
deeply impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. In neighborhoods such as the Port, there are
food deserts with limited eating options and no grocery stores aside from small corner shops. Other
areas are more saturated with food options. In addition, the two largest food stores are Whole Foods,
which is not affordable for many residents. The city’s Food Action Plan provides additional detail.

4.2.3.3. Dams
Critical infrastructure like dams and levees provide recreation, water supply, floodplain management,
energy, and other essential functions. Dam owners and operators can be private, non-profit, or
public. These structures and their owners are a vital component of local hazard mitigation.
The Hazard Potential Classification System for Dams provides an indication of the consequences of
failure of a dam in the United States. This system contains three classes I – Low, II – Significant, and
III – High, each representing the degree of potential damage to downstream life and property (FEMA,
2004).
The Amelia Earhart dam and the New Charles River Dam have the potential to impact the City of
Cambridge in the event of a breach or overtopping. These dams are not owned or operated by the
City of Cambridge.
•

The Amelia Earhart (NID# MA01088) is classified as a Low Hazard Potential Dam (Class III).
This dam was last inspected in March of 2017 (USACE). Low Hazard Potential Dam
classification signifies that no loss of human life is expected with failure, and there is low or
limited economic, environmental, and lifeline losses probable (FEMA, 2004). The top of the
Amelia Earhart Dam is 11.76 ft-NAVD88.

•

The New Charles River Dam (NID# MA01092) is classified as a Significant Hazard Potential
Dam, which was last inspected in February of 2022 (USACE). Significant Hazard Potential
classification indicates possible loss of life due to dam failure. Furthermore, dam failure may
cause damage to homes, industrial or commercial facilities, secondary highways or
railroads, and potential interruption of relatively critical facilities (MA DCR, 2017).

For these two dams, Cambridge staff are in ongoing communications with the dam owners and the
region related to planning for potential flanking and overtopping under future climate conditions, as
well as potential upgrades and enhancements to minimize impacts due to coastal flooding. Section
3.3.1 of the Natural Hazard Profiles discusses coastal flooding because of dam failure.
The City of Cambridge owns and operates two dams, both located outside of the city limits. These
include the Stony Brook Reservoir Dam and the Cambridge Reservoir Dam, both of which create
reservoirs for the city’s water supply.

•

The Stony Brook Reservoir Dam (NID# MA00293) is classified as a High Hazard Potential
Dam. This dam is in Weston. This earthen dam is 32 feet tall and over 1,200 feet long. The
dam is inspected every two years in compliance with state requirements and as of the last
inspection was in satisfactory condition.

•

The Cambridge Reservoir Dam (NID# MA00750) is classified as a High Hazard Potential
Dam. This dam is in Waltham. This earthen dam is 31 feet tall and over 1,600 feet long. The
dam is inspected every two years in compliance with state requirements and as of the last
inspection was in satisfactory condition.

Both dams are assigned the high hazard potential classification, which means failure or misoperation will cause loss of human life.
4.2.3.4. Potential Future Development
The City of Cambridge’s Community Development Department (CDD) tracks larger-scale
residential and commercial developments. Its Current Development Log database is updated on a
quarterly basis and provides detailed information on each of the developments and overall trends.
As of October 2023, Cambridge currently has 77 projects anticipated for future development.
These projects are at various stages in the development process, including projected, planned,
and already under construction. These projects total more than 16 million square feet and provide
an additional 5217 residential units. Most projects are in East Cambridge and consist mainly of
office and research and development. However, overall in Cambridge, residential development is
slightly more prevalent than office/R&D with approximately 39% of projects being primarily
residential and 25% categorized as office/R&D (Cambridge, 2023).

4.2.6 | Economic
Economic assets are defined as entities that produce a financial benefit for the community.
As described in the Envision Cambridge Economy Plan, the city envisions a more equitable city,
where all people, regardless of their background or identity, have access to opportunities. This
Plan outlines strategies and actions to create a more inclusive labor market and regulate
development to create an environment that will serve the city’s economic goals. The city has been
working towards the goals of:
1. Shared Community Prosperity: Ensure access to job opportunities and living wages, as
well as access to robust education, training, and support services.
2. Equity: Eliminate racial, gender, and other disparities in economic opportunity.
3. Global Economic Center: Maintain Cambridge’s centrality in the global knowledge
economy.

4. Employment Diversity: Diversify employment opportunities beyond high-skill work in a few
industries.
5. Business Diversity: Ensure local businesses of diverse types, sizes, and growth stages are
able to start, grow, and remain in Cambridge.
6. Great Commercial Districts: Preserve and enhance the distinctive character of Cambridge’s
commercial districts, especially its major squares and mixed-use corridors.
The City of Cambridge has twelve vibrant commercial and development districts that offer a
healthy retail and services mix to residents, workers, and visitors. These districts provide diverse
amenities, commercial spaces, and employment opportunities that play a key role in the city’s
economic performance and its success. Cambridge’s compact geography and population density
allow businesses to thrive. Central Square, Alewife/Fresh Pond, East Cambridge, Harvard Square,
Huron Village/Observatory Hill, Inman Square, Kendall Square, Lower Massachusetts Avenue,
North Point, Osborn Triangle, and Porter Square/North Massachusetts Avenue are the 12
commercial districts in the city (CDD, 2023) – some create arts and cultural hubs and provide
diverse nightlife, while others consist of innovation spaces with a mix of small and large retail and
service businesses. All these commercial districts bring vibrancy to surrounding neighborhoods.
Figure 4-3 shows these districts.

Figure 4-3: Image Cambridge’s Commercial Districts (GIS, 2023)
The Cambridge Top 25 employers list provides insight into the overall economic climate in
Cambridge. Since the mid-1980s, the Community Development Department (CDD) has collected
employment data annually. According to the CDD, Table 4.7 lists the top employers in 2022 (City
of Cambridge, 2023).

5. Vulnerability & Impacts Assessment
5.1. Introduction & Overview
In hazard mitigation planning, risk is the potential for damage or loss when natural hazards
described in Chapter 3 interact with assets described in Chapter 4. For Cambridge, assets include
people, structures, systems, natural, historic, and cultural resources, the economy, and valued
activities. The risk assessment looks at two key factors: vulnerability and impact.
•
•

Vulnerability is a description of which assets within locations identified to be hazard
prone are at risk from the effects of the identified hazard(s) (FEMA, 2022).
Impacts are the consequences or effects of each hazard on the city’s assets identified in
the vulnerability assessment (FEMA, 2022).

For each natural hazard described in Chapter 3, this chapter presents an overview of which assets
are most at risk from the effects of that hazard and describes the consequences of that
vulnerability.
Starting in 2015, Cambridge undertook a detailed climate change vulnerability assessment which
evaluated the city’s critical assets and infrastructure for the present day and anticipated future
climate risks. The vulnerability assessment included inland/riverine flooding, sea level rise, extreme
heat, and provided a robust economic analysis. Following the vulnerability assessment,
Cambridge developed the Resilient Cambridge Plan which identified broad resilience strategies
and actions for neighborhoods, buildings, infrastructure, and overall creating a greener city. The
vulnerability assessment in this plan builds upon Cambridge’s previously released reports.

5.2. Methodology
5.2.1 | Vulnerability Assessment Overview
Natural hazard profiles presented in Chapter 3 were used to determine which assets identified in
Chapter 4 are located within hazard prone areas, presently or in the future. For inland flooding and
coastal flooding, GIS mapping of assets and of areas of flooding were utilized as further described
in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.3. For all other hazards, the identified hazard is not mapped or cannot
be mapped and therefore a qualitative analysis that relies on local knowledge and rational decision
making was used to identify vulnerability. Because Cambridge has a considerable number of
assets that are present city-wide, vulnerability discussions focus on specific assets that are most
important and most susceptible to damage or loss from hazards.

5.2.2 | Identification of Potential Impacts
There are three ways to analyze impacts:
•

Historical Analysis: Historical analysis uses data on the impacts and losses of
previous hazard events to predict the anticipated impacts and losses for a similar future
event.

•

Exposure Analysis: An exposure analysis identifies the existing and future assets in
known hazard areas. GIS is often used for this analysis and to make maps to visualize the
risk. An exposure analysis can quantify the number, type and value of structures,
community lifelines and other assets in areas of identified hazards. It can identify any
assets exposed to multiple hazards. Exposure analysis can also help a community
understand areas that may be vulnerable if and when buildings, infrastructure and
community lifelines are built in hazard-prone areas. For Cambridge, an exposure analysis
was used for inland and coastal flooding.

•

Scenario analysis: A scenario analysis asks "what if" a certain event occurs. This kind
of analysis uses a hypothetical situation to think through potential impacts and losses. A
scenario analysis can be completed narratively by walking through a scenario with the
planning team and documenting what could happen. It can also be completed using
modeling. FEMA’s Hazus program is one of the most common scenario analysis tools for
hazard mitigation. For Cambridge, FEMA’s Hazus-MH Version 2.2 SP1 was used to
estimate potential losses from earthquakes and hurricanes.

Table 5.1, below, discusses general impacts that can be the result of natural hazards affecting
Cambridge’s assets. These impacts are discussed throughout this chapter.

Approximately one third of households in Cambridge do not own cars and rely on public
transportation. The city has one of the highest walkability scores in the region. It is important to
identify support services and assets within reasonable walking distance of owners, renters, and
students. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, . “most people are willing to walk for
five to ten minutes, or approximately ¼- to ½-mile to a transit stop.” Figure 5.1 demonstrates that
some areas of Cambridge are well supported by services during or after a natural hazard event but
there are areas of Cambridge that are not as accessible due to their distance from services.
Proximity to these assets has a significant impact on Cambridge’s people and their ability to adapt
to and respond to flooding, winter storms and Nor’easters, hurricanes and tropical storms, and
extreme temperatures, as well as other natural hazards encountered less frequently.

5.3. Assessment
5.3.1 | Inland Flooding (Stormwater and Riverine)
The impacts of flooding in Cambridge can include injury or death, property damage, and traffic
disruptions. Erosion can also occur due to flooding events, which can compromise water quality,
slope stability, and the stability of building foundations. Erosion puts current and future structures
and populations at risk if they are in areas near steep slopes and embankments.
Inland flooding includes both stormwater and riverine flooding. Riverine flooding is most likely to
impact areas closest to bodies of water, while stormwater flooding can occur all over the city.
Property damage, public health hazards, and impacts to transportation networks are the primary
concerns surrounding inland flooding. Stormwater flooding is often concentrated in smaller areas
including parking lots and roadways, hindering emergency access, and leaving communities
isolated.

My basement has flooded twice when we had
storms that dumped 7-8 inches in 48 hours.
- Survey Respondent
Much of the infrastructure in Cambridge, including bridges, tunnels, stormwater systems,
roadways, and the subway system, were designed based on historical rainfall events. With
increased frequency and severity of storm events, inland flooding could become an increased
vulnerability for the city to manage. Noted recently, more frequent occurrences of flood events
larger than the historic normal have occurred and put this vital infrastructure at risk. Much of the
community in Cambridge relies heavy on the public transportation system and road networks to
get from place to place, and damage to any of these systems could impact thousands of people
and result in inability for them to get to work, appointments, and other essential locations.
Hazard locations and extent of riverine flooding were determined using the FEMA FIRM for Zone A
(100-year floodplain) and Zone X (500-year floodplain). A flood exposure analysis was conducted
for assets throughout the city utilizing the most recent assessor’s database, FEMA flood maps,
and the city’s flood viewer. Table 5.2 shows the number of assets likely to be impacted by inland
flooding for a variety of flood scenarios. Table 5.3 lists the total number of buildings anticipated to
be impacted by inland flooding for a variety of flood scenarios, and their associated assessed
value based on the most recent assessor’s database.

5.3.2 | Winter Storms & Nor’easters
Cambridge is often subjected to harsh winters. Winter storms and Nor’easters bring with them
heavy precipitation, ice, and below freezing temperatures. These storms can immobilize a city and
cause significant disruptions to daily life. A citywide event shutting down Cambridge is estimated
to cause at least $43 million (in current dollars) in daily economic losses (Cambridge, February
2017). Heavy precipitation and ice can cause road closures, travel delays and cancellations,
business and school closures, and generally dangerous conditions. These storms also bring
intense winds. High winds can cause structural damage to the built environment and bring down
trees and power lines. This can cause severe and lasting power outages, which are especially
dangerous during severe winter conditions as citizens may be unable to heat their homes. Below
freezing temperatures can cause pipes to burst. Those without shelter or heat are especially
vulnerable during these situations and are susceptible to severe life safety issues such as frostbite
and hypothermia.
As described in Chapter 3, the City of Cambridge has experienced several severe winter storm
events in recent years, most recently in January 2015 (Winter Storm Juno), March 2018 (3
nor’easters within two weeks), and January 2022 (blizzard with high winds). During these winter
storm events, the City of Cambridge experienced a multitude of impacts, including a state
shutdown, parking bans, closure of the MBTA and cancellation of flights at Logan International
Airport, school closures, and loss of power.

Major blizzards have disrupted daily life and
work, with power outages, mountains of snow
to shovel, digging out the car, difficulty
navigating on foot due to relentless ice that is
never fully addressed by the community.
- Survey Respondent
Furthermore, these storms can cause dangerous disruptions to emergency operations. First
responders may be unable to respond to emergency situations due to adverse travel conditions.
First responders themselves are potentially vulnerable to injury due to dangerous travel conditions
such as icy roads or low visibility. Evacuation routes may be impassable.

Though nor’easters may not always bring snow, they bring heavy precipitation. Such intense
rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding. They also have the potential to
create storm surge. Flooding impacts from these storms become particularly dangerous when
storms occur during high tide; the combined effect of heavy precipitation, storm surge, and high
tide can be extremely severe. The flooding impact from nor’easters is further exacerbated by sea
level rise, and the frequency of such storms is expected to increase with climate change, with the
potential for more frequent, more intense winter storms in the future.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on the most vulnerable assets due to
winter storms and nor’easters. Table 5.5 lists these assets and the likely impacts.

5.3.3 | Coastal Flooding as a Result of Dam Failure
The Charles River and Amelia Earhart Dams provide coastal defenses between Cambridge and
Boston Harbor. As discussed in Chapter 3, there have been no previous occurrences of dam
failure at the Amelia Earhart or New Charles River Dams since their establishment in 1965 and
1978, respectively. However, continued increases in sea level rise may result in compromised
infrastructure, leading to coastal flooding in previously inland areas which was studied in the
Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and in the Resilient Cambridge Plan. (Cambridge,
February 2017). Coastal flooding as a result of dam failure could result in catastrophic impacts to
Cambridge and the surrounding area. Cambridge’s infrastructure, economy, and the well-being of
the community would be at risk. Many of the same risks exist for coastal flooding as they do for
riverine flooding, described in Section 5.2.2. For example, both types of flooding may block
roadways and cause property damage. As sea level rise and other climate change impacts
continue, this infrastructure will be at an even greater risk. A major storm surge, while not
something that Cambridge currently experiences due to the existence of the Amelia Earhart and
the Charles River dams, would have the potential to inundate multiple modes of transportation,
rendering the system unusable for days at a time if either of the dams were to fail.

Hazard locations and extents of coastal flooding were assessed using the Massachusetts Coast
Flood Risk Model (MC-FRM) for future flooding extents. The MC-FRM utilized inundation
predictions based on a combination of sea level rise and storm surge. The model dynamically
includes impacts of tides, waves, and storm surge, as well as other parameters in a range of storm
conditions to best assess impacts from coastal flooding. The flood analysis was conducted for
assets in Cambridge utilizing this model in addition to data provided by the city. The number of
assets impacted by coastal flooding due to dam failure was estimated using the predicted extent
of flooding and mapped assets. Table 5.6 shows the number of assets likely to be impacted by
coastal flooding under 10 year and 100-year storm events by 2070. Table 5.7 lists the total number
of buildings anticipated to be impacted by coastal flooding for these two flood scenarios, and their
associated assessed value based on the most recent assessor’s database.

include Hurricane Henri (2021) Hurricane Ida (2021) and Tropical Storm Elsa (2021). These storms
caused significant impacts to Cambridge, including loss of power, downed trees, and flooding (the
impacts of which are discussed in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.3).
Due to the large spatial extent of hurricanes and tropical storms, Cambridge’s population and
existing infrastructure, including critical facilities, are at risk. Potential impacts may include damage
to buildings from both wind and water, business interruptions, loss of communication, damage to
transportation networks, impairment of water supply and wastewater systems, and power failure.
Flooding is a major concern during a hurricane, and slow-moving storms can discharge
substantial amounts of rain over an area. Storm surge is also a risk that accompanies hurricanes
and tropical storms.

After damage from Hurricane Sandy, I installed
a generator running on city gas. Also, my car
has been damaged twice by falling tree limbs.
- Survey Respondent
To provide City of Cambridge decision-makers with the best available information for estimating
losses from Hurricanes, our team conducted a scenario analysis and utilized the Hazus Hurricane
Loss Estimation Methodology to assess the potential impacts of a Category 2 and a Category 4
Hurricane. We used Hazus-generated probabilistic Category 2 and 4 storms to understand direct
physical damage (essential facilities, transportation, utility systems, general building stock),
induced physical damages (debris), and direct economic/social losses. Hurricane features used in
this analysis include wind pressure, windborne debris, rainwater penetration, tree blowdown, and
storm surge. Table 5.9 highlights the impacts from Category 2 and 4 storms on assets in the City
of Cambridge, and Table 5.10 discusses general impacts that can be the result of hurricanes and
tropical storms affecting Cambridge’s assets.

5.3.5 | Tornadoes
Chapter 3 outlines the previous occurrences of tornadoes impacting Middlesex County. In recent
years, three tornadoes have touched down in the county, with the severity of EF1 occurring in 2016
and two EF0 tornadoes occurring in 2021. While there has yet to be a tornado that has touched
down in Cambridge, the 2016 tornado in Middlesex County hit near the Cambridge Turnpike in
Concord, MA, and headed northeast. This tornado caused roughly $1 million in property damages
and one house suffered significant structural damage (NOAA NCEI, 2016).
During a tornado, debris becomes windborne and can cause extensive damage to people and
property. If a tornado were to touchdown in or pass through Cambridge, damage would occur
both in the tornado path and in the surrounding areas. Due to the high prevalence of older
construction and the density of development that exists within the city, the community would be
highly vulnerable to impacts, with structures built before current building codes likely more
vulnerable. Evacuation, sheltering, debris clearance, distribution of food and emergency supplies,
search and rescue, and emergency fire and medical services would be required as part of the
emergency response to a tornado event. Critical evacuation and transportation routes may be
impassable due to downed trees and debris, and recovery efforts may be complicated by power
and communication outages.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on the vulnerable assets due to
tornadoes. Table 5.11 lists these assets and the likely impacts.

5.3.6 | Earthquake
As discussed in Chapter 3, no earthquakes have ever been recorded as originating within
Cambridge’s boundaries. Although earthquakes are not common in Cambridge, the historical
architecture of the city leaves many assets vulnerable to impacts of earthquakes if one were to
occur, although the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake would determine the extent
of the impact.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on the vulnerable assets due to
earthquakes. The Hazus Earthquake Loss Estimation Methodology was used to assess the
potential impacts of a Magnitude 5.0 and a Magnitude 7.0 Earthquake. Specifically, Hazusgenerated Magnitude 5.0 and 7.0 Earthquakes were evaluated to understand direct physical
damages (essential facilities, transportation, utility systems, general building stock), induced
physical damages (debris), and direct economic/social losses. Tables 5.12 and 5.13 show a
summary of the likely impacts due to a Magnitude 5.0 and a Magnitude 7.0 earthquake.

Earthquakes also have the potential to cause structural destruction. There are an estimated 19,000
buildings within the Cambridge city limits. Approximately 76% of the buildings are associated with
residential housing. According to the Hazus model, a Magnitude 7.0 Earthquake has the potential
to completely destroy almost 11,000 buildings and create 4.8 million tons of debris. Thousands
more buildings would experience extensive or moderate damage. Even a Magnitude 5.0
Earthquake has the potential to destroy more than four hundred buildings. Table 5.14 shows the
likeliness of structural damage on critical facilities from a Magnitude 5 and a Magnitude 7
earthquake.

5.3.7 | Landslides
As discussed in Chapter 3, there are no documented previous occurrences of landslides in
Cambridge. In addition, the overall flat topography of the city is generally not conducive for a
landslide to occur. The City of Cambridge is classified as a stable area with an exceptionally low
relative landslide ranking. It is likely that if a landslide were to occur in Cambridge, it would occur
as a slow-moving slide rather than a fast-moving rock fall and impact a small area. Climate change
has the potential to increase the risk of landslides due to an increase in the frequency and severity
of precipitation events, rapid snow melt, and rain-on-snow events.
Depending on the location of a landslide, the assets that could be most vulnerable are roadways,
buildings and structures, emergency response systems, the MBTA, the power grid, tree canopy,
and people.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on the vulnerable assets due to
landslides. Table 5.16 lists the most vulnerable assets and the likely impacts.

5.3.8 | Tsunami
As discussed in Chapter 3, there is no documentation that either of the previous two tsunamis that
occurred in Massachusetts affected the City of Cambridge. If a tsunami were to occur, the
geographic location of the tsunami could potentially result in an impact to a significant part of the
city, depending on the runup (NOAA & USGS, 2015). It is more likely that locations within
Cambridge likely to experience coastal flooding will be the area impacted. Given the infrequency of
tsunami occurrences along the East Coast, the probability of tsunamis affecting Cambridge is
exceptionally low. Climate change has the potential to increase the risk of tsunami due to an
increase in natural disasters such as melting ice and collapsing glaciers, earthquakes, volcanic
activity, and landslides, which trigger tsunamis.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on vulnerable assets due to tsunami.
Table 5.17 lists the most vulnerable assets and the likely impacts due to a tsunami. Note that
Hazus-MH can run a tsunami model to estimate economic loss and physical damage to buildings
due to depth and force of tsunami waves. However, FEMA’s model is only set up to run in five
elevated risk states: California, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and Alaska.

5.3.9 | Extreme Temperatures
As discussed in Chapter 3, it is well documented that extreme heat and extreme cold has occurred
within the City of Cambridge. Extreme heat is often more severe in concentrated parts of the city
that have less tree canopy, more pavement, and dark surfaces such as roofs that absorb more

heat as shown in Figure 5.3. Extreme cold can occur city-wide. Climate change has the potential to
increase the extent (severity or magnitude), probability, and location of extreme temperatures.

Figure 5-3: 90-degree day relative to streetscape. As the tree canopy increases, the “feels like”
temperature decreases - Resilient Cambridge Heat Risk Storymap -2021
A historical analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on the vulnerable assets due to
extreme temperatures. Table 5.18 lists the most vulnerable assets and the likely impacts due to
extreme heat or extreme cold.
Temperatures are expected to become more extreme as the climate continues to change. Given
Cambridge’s distinct four-season climate, it is expected that Cambridge will experience extreme
temperatures on both ends of the spectrum, with extreme heat events in the summer and extreme
cold events in the winter. Extreme temperatures can have far reaching impacts on infrastructure,
transportation, public health, water resources, and energy.
Extreme cold events can create dangerous conditions and are sometimes accompanied by
precipitation. They can impact daily commutes and transportation infrastructure. Cold events
accompanied by extreme amounts of snow can cause public transportation closures and
dangerous driving conditions, resulting in accidents, injuries, or even loss of life. In addition to
transportation infrastructure, water infrastructure also has the potential to be severely disrupted
during extreme cold events. Power outages can result in loss of heat, causing pipes to freeze and
burst. Ground freezing can also result in buried pipes freezing and bursting. A broken water main
can have devastating impacts on a large metropolitan area like Cambridge. Furthermore, power
outages during wintry weather may result in inappropriate use of combustion heaters, cooking
appliances, and generators in poorly ventilated areas, which can lead to increased risk of carbon
monoxide poisoning and fires.
Extreme cold also has detrimental impacts on certain vulnerable populations. Those without
homes or shelter are susceptible to hypothermia and frostbite. Those with insufficient resources to
heat their homes are exposed to the same risk.

- Survey Respondent
Though perhaps less obvious in a place like Cambridge, extreme heat events can and do occur.
By 2030, annual days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit (90°F) may triple compared to the 1971-2000
baseline. By 2070, Cambridge may experience nearly three months over 90°F, compared with less
than two weeks in the present day (Cambridge, February 2017). Heat waves in Cambridge are
expected to be more frequent and of longer duration in the future. The duration and intensity of
heat waves have significant public health implications- each passing day of extreme heat
decreases a person’s ability to cope with the heat stress, thereby making instances of heat stroke
or heat-related death more likely (Cambridge, February 2017). Certain populations, such as
homeless community members some people with disabilities, and community members without air
conditioning are increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat impacts such as heat stress and heat
stroke. The City of Cambridge Vulnerability Assessment found that portions of North Cambridge,
the Port, and Riverside are more vulnerable to heat impacts than other parts of the City
(Cambridge, February 2017) . Even young and healthy individuals can succumb to heat if they
participate in strenuous physical activities during hot weather. This is especially true for those with
jobs that involve physical labor outdoors, such as landscapers or those who work in construction.
Impacts from heat stress can also exacerbate pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular
conditions. Extreme heat has been the number one weather-related cause of death since NOAA
began reporting data for heat in 1988 (Cambridge, 2021).
Extremely hot summer days can also worsen air pollution, especially in urban areas. In areas of the
Northeast that currently face problems with smog, inhabitants are likely to experience more days
that fail to meet air quality standards. This can be especially problematic for individuals with certain
respiratory issues, like asthma or allergies. Furthermore, warmer weather can also support the
migration of invasive species and lead to an increase in vector-borne diseases. It can also
increase the chance of infestation by pests in general, such as the Asian Longhorned Beetle,
which could have a significant impact on the City’s urban forest (City of Cambridge, 2015).

5.3.10 | Drought
Chapter 3 discusses the drought levels and previous occurrences of drought in Cambridge. Since
2020, there have been two consecutive months with a critical drought status, and eight months
with a significant drought status. Higher drought status and longer time periods will have the
greatest impact on the city, and these events are expected to increase into the future with climate
change.
Cambridge’s main potential vulnerability to a severe long-term drought would be a reduction in the
availability of water from the City’s local water supplies. The city owns and operates a separate
water system, with storage reservoirs on Hobbs Brook and Stony Brook in the towns of Lexington,
Lincoln, Waltham, and Weston. In a severe multi-year drought, the yields from these reservoirs
would be sharply reduced. This could result in the implementation of water restrictions and use
recommendations by the City. However, the City is also a member of the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority and has access to MWRA’s regional water supply in the event of an
emergency.
Drought also has the potential to increase the risk of brush fires. Increased dry conditions provide
the perfect scenario for brush fires. Accidental human ignition or ignition by lightning are especially
concerning during times of drought. Firefighting efforts can be impacted during drought conditions
due to the low water supply, which can increase the risk of and damage from brush fires.
Other impacts from drought can be felt in aquatic or wetland ecosystems, such as Cambridge’s
rivers and streams. Drought can severely impact stream flow which can have adverse impacts on
wildlife.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on vulnerable assets due to drought.

5.3.11 | Wildfire/Brush Fire
As discussed in Chapter 3, there have been previous wildfires/brushfires reported in Cambridge that
the Fire Department responded to. Since 2017, 83 fires have impacted a total of 109 acres in
Cambridge. Depending on the location of the fire and how quickly it spreads, wildfires and bushfires
have the potential to devastate a community like Cambridge.
Wildfires and brushfires can lead to injury, death, property damage and impacts to natural resources.
Smoke and air pollution can be a health hazard, especially for those with respiratory conditions such
as asthma or allergies. Structures located in brush fire hazard areas are at risk, and closely situated
buildings, especially those without fire barriers, increase the risk of brush fires spreading. The most
vulnerable members of the population are those who would be unable to evacuate quickly, including
the elderly, households with young children, people with mobility limitations, people with limited
English proficiency or communication-related disabilities, and people with low socioeconomic
status. First responders and firefighters are also at risk.

Recent wildfire smoke affected my health.

Secondary effects from brush fire include contamination of reservoirs and destroyed power, gas,
water, broadband, and oil transmission lines. Brush fires can also contribute to erosion and
flooding. They strip slopes of vegetation, thereby decreasing soil stability and exposing the slopes
to higher rates of runoff which can cause severe erosion, ultimately increasing the chance of
flooding. Subsequent rains can worsen this erosion as vegetation and ground cover has been
severely reduced and soils remain unstable.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on the vulnerable assets due to a
wildfire or brushfire. Table 5.20 lists the most vulnerable assets and the likely impacts.

5.3.12 | Invasive Species
As discussed in Chapter 3, there are numerous invasive plants, insects, and fungi species that
persist in Massachusetts. The extent and growth of these species is predicted to increase in the
future with climate change, thus increasing the impact on a community. Invasive species persist
town-wide, and it is difficult to predict where they may spread to within the city.
Invasive species pose a great threat to native ecosystems and ecosystem services. Invasive
species can often outcompete native species as they have no natural predators in their new range.
This allows invasive species populations to grow unchecked, leading to a decrease in biodiversity
as the invasive species becomes the dominant species in the area. A decrease in biodiversity also
decreases the resilience of the ecosystem; ecosystems depend on a diverse range of organisms
carrying out their roles to remain stable. A disruption in diversity can lead to the collapse of the
ecosystem or lost ecosystem services. A warming climate adds cause for concern as warmer
temperatures may allow for longer breeding seasons or further expansion for some invasive
species.
A scenario analysis was utilized to assess potential impacts on vulnerable assets due to invasive
species. Table 5.21 lists the most vulnerable assets and likely impacts due to invasive species.

6. Capability Assessment
The City of Cambridge has a unique set of capabilities, in the form of laws, policies, programs,
staff, funding and other resources, to carry out the NHMP and increase resilience. This chapter
reviews the City’s capabilities and describes which resources Cambridge has available to
accomplish hazard mitigation and reduce disaster losses now or in the future. An aspect of
capability is compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program. This program is described in
Section 6.1. There are many other capabilities that Cambridge has which are described in Section
6.2

6.1. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
Compliance
Communities across the country build their flood management capabilities by participating in the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP supports flood risk reduction before and after
disasters. It helps reduce the socioeconomic impact of floods. The NFIP allows property owners
and renters in participating communities to purchase federal flood insurance policies to recover
financial losses after a flood. To participate in the NFIP, communities adopt and enforce floodplain
management policies to reduce the effects of flooding. The NFIP is a key capability for Cambridge.

6.1.1 | Staff Resources
The City of Cambridge has one Certified Floodplain Manager (CFM) on staff who acts as the
Floodplain Administrator. This staff member also serves as the Director of the Conservation
Commission and as a Senior Engineer. Staff have been adequately trained through FEMA
programs, state programs, and courses from the Association of State Floodplain Managers. The
Floodplain Administrator also tracks and compiles any Letters of Map Changes that affect the
Cambridge area. Staff adhere to FEMA guidelines regarding matters of substantial damage and
substantial improvement.
The City of Cambridge is looking to expand their staff capacity for floodplain management.

6.1.2 | Regulation
Cambridge entered the NFIP on June 21, 1974. The first Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) were
effective on July 5, 1982 (FEMA, Community Status Book Report, 2023). The current FIRMs for
Cambridge are effective as of June 4, 2010. These FIRMs are available digitally in a variety of
locations in city mapping, including the Flood Viewer.

City of Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan

Attachment: 2023NHMP_ChaptersCompiled (COF 2023 #222 : A communication was received from Climate Resilience Project Planner, Leila

a

6-2
Packet Pg. 198

Preliminary FIRMs are available on FEMA’s Map Service Center and are dated August 13, 2021.
These FIRMs are not yet effective. FEMA will notify the city as soon as those maps go from being
“preliminary” to “effective.” Once FEMA notifies these FIRMs are effective, the city Ordinance and
maps need to be updated locally and all new and re-development will be held to the new flood
map standard as soon as the new maps become effective.
The city maintains elevation certificates in accordance with Community Rating System
requirements and tracks the number of buildings located in the special flood hazard area and
reports this number annually during the annual CRS certifications. Staff are working toward a
digital database for elevation certificates. There are currently 184 buildings in the Special Flood
Hazard Area in Cambridge. The City of Cambridge issues development permits in the SFHA
through the Conservation Commission (310 CMR 10.00) in accordance with the Wetlands
Protection Act. The Commission and the Floodplain Administrator are responsible for issuing
permits in the SFHA. This is a transparent and public process, where the application is publicized,
and a public hearing is held on the matter.
After a permit is issued, the Floodplain Administrator is responsible for monitoring and compliance
throughout the construction phase and through the end of the project. The Floodplain
Administrator ensures there is proper signage, and erosion and sediment control measures, and
conducts a site visit at least every other week. At the end of the permitting process, an Order of
Conditions is issued and recorded with the property deed at the Middlesex South Registry of
Deeds.
In addition, DPW has a permitting process separate from the Conservation Commission. This is
the Stormwater Control Permit, which is related to predicted flooding in the years 2050 and 2070,
not FEMA FIRMs. There is coordination between DPW and the Floodplain Administrator in these
permits, as well.
The City of Cambridge’s largest barrier to an improved floodplain management program is the lack
of technology and digital record-keeping. The city is working toward digital record-keeping while
keeping accessibility in mind. The city is moving toward a simple and streamlined electronic
permitting process. An additional barrier identified by the City is staff capacity. The City is working
to expand their floodplain management staff capacity.

6.1.3 | Community Rating System
Cambridge is a participant in the Community Rating System (CRS) as of October 1, 2015 (FEMA,
Community Status Book Report, 2023). The Community Rating System is an incentive-based
program that rewards communities for exceeding the minimum standards of floodplain
management set by the National Flood Insurance Program. The CRS has 19 creditable activities
for which communities can obtain points. These activities include but are not limited to public
education and outreach, mapping standards, higher regulatory standards, open space
preservation, and stormwater management regulations. Communities that exceed minimum NFIP
standards in these 19 activities are rewarded with a discount on flood insurance premiums for
citizens of that community. Cambridge’s CRS Class Ranking is a 9, which is almost the lowest (10

is the lowest) (FEMA, Community Status Book Report, 2023). This means that citizens of the City
of Cambridge will receive a 5% discount on their flood insurance premiums. This discount will grow
as the City of Cambridge continues to improve in the program. The city is looking to improve their
rating to an 8 but must meet the pre-requisite of adopting a one-foot freeboard requirement within
the Special Flood Hazard Area.

6.1.4 | Insurance Summary
There are three repetitive loss properties within the city, which is an increase from the two
structures identified in the 2015 HMP. FEMA defines a repetitive loss property as “an NFIP-insured
structure that has had at least 2 paid flood losses of more than $1,000 each in any 10-year period
since 1978.” (FEMA, Repetitive Loss Structure, 2020) As of May 15, 2023, building losses have
totaled $99,768.39 and contents losses have totaled $83,899.91, totaling $183,668.30 in losses, an
increase over the $168,421.73 documented in the 2015 HMP.
The staff is also responsible for conducting public outreach with regard to flood insurance. A
paper/physical flyer is distributed annually to each structure in the Special Flood Hazard Area that
describes the importance of flood insurance, especially for properties within a flood zone. There
are two flyers; one is specific to repetitive loss properties, and one is for all other structures located
in the SFHA.

6.1.5 | Compliance History
There are no outstanding compliance issues for the City of Cambridge. The next Community
Assistance Visit for the review of Cambridge’s Community Rating System participation is
scheduled for 2024. Community Assistance Visits occur every five years for the City of Cambridge

6.2. Mitigation Capabilities of Cambridge
There are four key types of mitigation capabilities in accordance with FEMA’s Local Mitigation
Planning Handbook:

6.2.1 Planning and regulatory capabilities are the codes, ordinances,
policies, laws, plans and programs that guide growth and development.

6.2.2 Administrative and technical capabilities are the city’s staff,
skills and tools.

City of Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan

Attachment: 2023NHMP_ChaptersCompiled (COF 2023 #222 : A communication was received from Climate Resilience Project Planner, Leila

a

6-4
Packet Pg. 200

6.2.3 Financial capabilities are the resources to fund mitigation actions.

6.2.4 Education and outreach capabilities are programs and methods
that can communicate about and encourage risk reduction.

Many of the capabilities or gaps in capabilities identified in this chapter are anticipated or have
been observed while preparing for, responding to, or recovering from local hazards, which have
been identified and outlined in Chapter 3. The capability gaps identified in this chapter were used
to inform the development of the mitigation actions in Chapter 7.

6.2.1 | Planning and Regulatory Capabilities
Planning and regulatory capabilities encompass a wide range of tools such as codes, ordinances,
policies, laws, plans, and programs that guide growth and development. These capabilities play a
crucial role in either supporting risk reduction or creating areas that are more vulnerable to
disasters. These strategies are aimed at breaking the cycle of disaster damage and
reconstruction. Additionally, effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction are critical in
shaping choices for sustainable development and building resilience to disasters. The following
strategies outline the planning and regulatory capabilities to address hazards in Cambridge.

6.2.1.1. Building Code
Cambridge has a multi-century history of development and building throughout many eras of trade
practices and editions of codes. A challenge for the capabilities of a community or region can be
the use of an updated building code which reflects industry best practices and standard of care.
Currently, the City of Cambridge utilizes the latest Commonwealth of Massachusetts Building Code
(Ninth Edition), which is Code of Massachusetts Regulations 780. According to the mass.gov
website, “the Massachusetts State Building Code includes international model codes and state
specific amendments adopted by the Board of Regulations and Standards (BBRS). The BBRS
regularly updates the state building codes as new information and technology becomes available
and change is warranted.”
The Massachusetts building code addresses natural hazards through elevation requirements
aligning with guidance from FEMA, hazard-resistant standards from ASCE 24 and ASCE 7,
recognition of floodplain overlay districts, and enforcement.
In addition to the building code, Massachusetts also has the Massachusetts Stretch Energy Code,
adopted by Cambridge in 2009, which requires enhanced energy performance above the

City of Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan

Attachment: 2023NHMP_ChaptersCompiled (COF 2023 #222 : A communication was received from Climate Resilience Project Planner, Leila

Packet Pg. 201

mandatory base building code. Cambridge adopted the Specialized Stretch Energy Code which
builds upon the 2023 Stretch Energy Code update with more restrictive use of fossil fuels and
additional net-zero ready requirements for new buildings and qualified renovations. The
Specialized Stretch Code went into effect on July 1, 2023, and is aligned with Cambridge’s Net
Zero Action Plan. On August 7th, 2023 the City adopted an ordinance that will require future
buildings to be fossil fuel free as part of the Fossil Fuel Free Demonstration Project, driven by state
legislation. Effective date pending state approval. The Stretch Energy Code and Specialized
Stretch Energy Code provide Cambridge with additional capabilities to withstand the impacts of
extreme temperatures.

6.2.1.2. Land Use / Development Ordinances and Regulations
The following discusses various municipal codes related to natural hazard mitigation and climate
change resilience. (City of Cambridge, 2023)
Tree Protection
The City of Cambridge Commissioner for Public Works adopted a Tree Protection Ordinance to
regulate removal of “significant trees”. Significant trees are identified as trees with a diameter at
breast height (DBH) of six inches or greater at four and a half feet above the ground. A Tree
Removal Permit is required to remove a significant tree and the city has identified specifications for
replacement trees. Trees play a critical role in hazard mitigation and provide cooling through
shade and evaporation, help with erosion control, and management of stormwater. Trees also
sequester carbon helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (Cambridge, Climate Resilience
Zoning, 2023)
Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO)
The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was enacted by Cambridge City Council
on July 28, 2014. The ordinance supports the city’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Energy use in buildings accounts for approximately 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in
Cambridge, particularly large buildings such as commercial, institutional, and mixed-use buildings.
The BEUDO ordinance requires owners of large buildings to track and report their annual energy
usage. In 2023, Cambridge passed an amendment to this ordinance which requires large nonresidential buildings to be net-zero by 2035, and medium-sized non-residential buildings to be netzero by 2050. (Cambridge, Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance, 2023)
Wastewater and Stormwater Drainage System
Cambridge regulation Chapter 13.16 addresses maintenance and management of the wastewater
and stormwater drainage systems. The City Engineer is ultimately responsible for construction and
administration of activities pertaining to the system.
The city has also adopted a stormwater management program that includes mitigation actions to
help control stormwater runoff volume and quality. Guidelines through this program are based on
the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) EPA National pollution Discharge Elimination
Program.

6.2.1.3. Zoning Code & Local Plans
The following discusses zoning code related to natural hazard mitigation and climate change
resilience. (Cambridge, The Zoning Ordinance, 2023)
Climate Resilience Zoning and Building Requirements
The City Council adopted new zoning requirements in February of 2023 that address the long-term
impacts of increased flooding and heat from climate change. These requirements apply to new
buildings that are over 25,000 square feet, new additions to buildings that increase the square
footage by 50%, the creation of occupiable or habitable space in basements that is exempt from
Gross Floor Area (GFA) requirements, and surface parking lots. The new zoning uses 2070
projections as a milestone since buildings constructed today are expected to have at least a 50year lifespan.
Flood Resilience Standards require new developments to protect vulnerable spaces that have a
likelihood of flooding based on future climate projections. The city is referring to its elevation
requirements for these spaces as “Long-Term Flood Elevations” which are based on 2070
projections. Applicants must review the elevations for precipitation and sea level rise and use the
higher of the two. Elevations are accessible on the City’s flood viewer website.
The Green Factor Standard is a new performance-based standard that encourages heat mitigation
through site and landscape designs that have a cooling benefit. Sites will need to achieve a “Cool
Score” by including features like trees (both preserving mature trees and planting new trees),
shrubs and other plantings, green roofs, shade canopies, and cool pavements. Applicants must fill
out a “Cool Score Sheet” based on the elements included in site and building design. (Cambridge,
Climate Resilience Zoning, 2023). Many of the practices in the Green Factor Standard will also
contribute to the reduction of stormwater run-off and flood prevention.
Article 22 Green Building Requirements promotes sustainable and energy efficient design. This
article applies to buildings that are 25,000 square feet or more, including new construction and
some types of substantial renovation. These requirements include demonstration that the design
meets the standards of a Green Building Rating System such as USGBC LEED – Gold Rating,
Passive House Institute, or Enterprise Green Communities. While an official rating is not required, a
green building professional must verify that the standard has been met. (Development C. o.,
2023)These green building requirements increase the capabilities of occupants to withstand
extreme temperature changes and disruptions in power.
Local Plans
There are a variety of local plans that informed the NHMP, as previously discussed in Chapter 2.
In addition to those plans, several departments have plans to build the capabilities and capacity of
the staff to respond to emergencies. These plans include:
•

6.2.2 | Administrative and Technical Capabilities
To assess the City’s administrative and technical capacity, the STC identified several departments
which play a key role in preparedness, response, and recovery to be surveyed, and key staff
provided input on capabilities to prepare for and respond to natural hazard events. Cambridge has
over 45 offices, departments, and commissions, all with varying degrees of involvement in natural
hazard and climate change planning, mitigation, and adaptation actions. In addition to the
capabilities under the purview of the city, Cambridge is also home to non-governmental
organizations which provide support to the residents of Cambridge. Representatives from many of
these departments were invited to participate in the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team
workshops to provide input on capabilities of the city. The following sections summarize input from
city staff and community members on the administrative and technical capabilities of Cambridge.
The feedback provided in the survey demonstrated that Cambridge has well-rounded departments
and has invested both time and funding into addressing natural hazard concerns. Some staff
identified that there can be silos of information developed or understood throughout the city and a
central person or office should be identified for leading such efforts.
Throughout engagement on this topic, capabilities were identified which reflect the city’s robust
resources and identified gaps which could be addressed by mitigation actions.
6.2.2.1. Staff Capacity and Training
City staff are often considered to be first responders during an emergency event. From police to
public works staff, resources are called to action to protect the assets described in Chapter 4.
However, these resources are only as good as the preparedness training and capacity of the staff
to respond.
Existing Capabilities: Due to the wealth and resources in the city, the feedback provided by staff
and other stakeholders in the process was that Cambridge was well positioned to respond
appropriately to most hazard events which the majority of respondents identified as flooding and
extreme heat. Departments including but not limited to Emergency Communications, Fire, Police,
Public Works, Water, Inspectional Services, Information Technology, and Historical Commission,
have trained staff on hazard mitigation.

City of Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan

Attachment: 2023NHMP_ChaptersCompiled (COF 2023 #222 : A communication was received from Climate Resilience Project Planner, Leila

a

6-8
Packet Pg. 204

Capability Gaps: Staff expressed the city’s need for more structure to be able to provide clear
command and control, well-articulated roles and responsibilities, disaster scenario planning,
interdepartmental training, and drilling. This includes a need for expanding training on hazard
mitigation to more departments and staff.

6.2.2.2. Internal and External Communications
Communication during a disaster is crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of the affected
community. Effective communication can include alerts and warnings to the public, but also the
ability to effectively message expectations and roles internally amongst city staff.
Existing Capabilities: Several departments within the city have Communications Managers, who
meet weekly with the Public Information Office to do resource and info sharing. Information from
those meetings is sometimes shared with the Language Access Manager and Community
Engagement Teams. In addition to internal communications coordination, the Language Access
Manager and Community Engagement have developed mechanisms and relationships to convey
information to the public through trusted channels of communication.
Capability Gaps: To further enhance hazard mitigation capabilities, departments recognize the
need for organizational coordination policy and cross agency training on disaster and resiliency
efforts. In addition to information sharing, hardening communication infrastructure was identified to
provide continuity of communication during an event.

6.2.2.3. Regional Coordination & Collaboration
It is crucial for the city to maintain close relationships with regional partners to ensure effective
communication and coordination. The city contributes to building regional resilience against
natural hazards through collaborating with external partners, stakeholders, organizations, and
residents.
Existing Capabilities: Examples of collaboration efforts include the Community Development
Department (CDD) and the Public Works Department (DPW) working with the Mystic River
Watershed Association to develop a proposal for a needs assessment and implementation plan
for communicating with frontline communities during climate emergencies. The DPW is also
leading regional work to identify and further the implementation of 9 coastal flood pathways from
the Mystic and Charles rivers. The team identified nine flood pathways and secured a FEMA grant
to further the development of the coastal intervention plans.
And CDD also works with partners in Cambridge to provide access to cooling shelters during heat
waves and implemented the “shade as social justice” project working with artists and communities
in three neighborhoods to design and deploy shade structures.
The Department of Human Service Programs has supported community partners by providing
space when flooding has impacted their programs. The Traffic, Parking, and Transportation
Department works with parking garage owners to make parking available to residents during snow
emergency parking bans. The Commission for Persons with Disabilities has an advisory board
consisting of people with disabilities, family members of people with disabilities, and

representatives of city departments. The Cambridge Water Department is a member of the
Massachusetts Water Resource Authority with interconnections to their system as a backup water
supply. Several departments, including the Fire and Police departments have mutual aid
agreements or MOUs to utilize other agencies’ resources in times of need to address various
hazards and support other communities. The Cambridge Public Health Department is a member
of the state-funded Metro Regional Preparedness Coalition, which fosters regional health and
medical readiness for emergency events in 60 communities, including Cambridge.

6.2.2.4. Local Committees and Task Forces
Cambridge has an engaged population focused on climate resilience. There are many subgroups
within departments, independent community organizations and over 50 commissions and boards
with diverse goals and purposes that directly or indirectly contribute to the capabilities of the
community to adapt or respond to natural hazards.
Existing Capabilities: Robust interest in the topic of climate change in recent years has led to the
development and prioritization of this topic for many organizations. The following provides some
examples of the committees and task forces involved in natural hazard planning and response:
•

The Cambridge Climate Committee (formerly the Climate Protection Action
Committee) is composed of community members who take an active interest in
climate change issues in Cambridge and who live or work in the city. The City

Manager appoints the standing committee as an advisory committee to assist in the
implementation of greenhouse gas reduction and climate change preparedness and
resilience plans. The Committee serves as a conduit between community members and
the city, reviews policy and program proposals, and develops recommendations to the City
Manager. (Committee, 2023)
•

The Cambridge Community Corps (C3) is a program led by the Cambridge Public
Health Department. Ambassadors inform the public and answer questions on public health
messaging topics such as staying safe during a pandemic, vaccines, safety during periods
of extreme heat, mosquito-borne diseases and emergency preparedness.

•

The Community Engagement Team at the Community Development Department
is a multi-lingual team of outreach workers. The team represents the American Born Black
community and underserved linguistic communities. The team builds deep relationships

with communities who are underserved, underheard, and historically excluded to do
outreach and engagement within their communities on hazard mitigation and climate
change preparedness.
Gaps: The city has worked hard to develop materials to educate and inform the community. There
is still work to be done to make materials more accessible and understandable by all community
members.

6.2.2.5. Assistance from Non-Governmental Organizations
Nongovernmental organizations including community-based organizations, educational, faith, and
cultural institutions, and health and safety services help support the needs of residents and priority
populations facing the impacts of natural hazards and climate change. Community organizations
and institutions play a role in emergency response and recovery; for example, after a storm a church
might collect needed items for residents with damaged homes or provide places for people to stay.
Existing Capabilities: Cambridge is fortunate to be the home of many non-governmental
organizations providing support to the community at large. A primary way in which the city utilizes
the services of these organizations is to disseminate information to communities who are hard to
reach or have a lack of trust in information provided by the government. Social capital, or community
resilience, is a key indicator of an individual’s ability to prepare, respond, or recover from an adverse
event.
•

•

Community-based organizations (CBOs): Community resilience if often reliant on
the connectedness of community members such as those who have friends or family that
can check on them during an extreme event may be safer or recover more quickly.
Community organizations, community centers, non-profits, community development
corporations, job training centers, art centers, and other CBOs provide the venue for
residents to build essential bonds and fill the gaps in feeling connected during a time of
crisis. They also may provide financial assistance, educational or material resources, and
support related to adverse events.
Educational facilities and places of faith: Educational facilities are often the
backbone or heart of a community. They are places to meet friends and neighbors and
receive information about what is happening in the community. Pre-schools, elementary
schools, high schools, colleges, universities, adult learning centers, tutoring centers, and
childcare centers provide spaces to enhance the opportunity to meet other Cambridge
residents. These spaces also often play roles in disaster relief providing emergency shelter,
supplies, or food to those impacted by storms or other events.

Capability Gaps: Distribution of information to these organizations can be difficult. There are many
of these entities in Cambridge and it can be challenging to reach all of them. Additionally, materials
have not been developed to reflect the needs of each of the organization’s constituents.

6.2.3 | Financial Capabilities
The City of Cambridge has invested in the development of resilient infrastructure and programs in
the city through a variety of avenues. The following funding sources are identified in Chapter 7
Mitigation Strategy.
Existing Capabilities: Cambridge manages two primary types of budgets: the operating budget and
the capital budget. These budgets serve different purposes and cover distinct types of expenses.
•

•

The operating budget covers day-to-day expenses required to deliver services to residents.
It includes costs such as staff wages, office supplies, utilities, and other recurring expenses.
Some of this money is typically set aside to provide funding for planned events, such as road
salt for winter storm response.
The capital budget is used for long-term investments in infrastructure and facilities, such as
road repairs, machinery, and maintenance. It funds major improvements to city facilities and
infrastructure and is based on the first year of needs in the five-year Capital Improvements
Program (CIP) Plan. An example of how Cambridge has used this money is to make
improvements to the city’s stormwater infrastructure.

Capability Gaps: The City is unable to always cover the expenses needed to address climate
mitigation due to the competing needs to fund other important initiatives in the city. To supplement
this need, the city has applied for grants from the state or federal government. Examples of grant
programs which have explicitly address climate resilience and hazard mitigation include EEA’s
Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Program and MAPC’s Accelerating Climate Resilience Grant
Program.

6.2.4 | Education and Outreach
Education and outreach capabilities are essential programs and methods that play a crucial role in
communicating about and encouraging risk reduction. By providing people with the knowledge,
skills, and values needed to understand and address the impacts of natural hazards, education
empowers individuals and communities to act. It helps eliminate fear and facilitates preparedness
by providing information. Education can also promote climate-smart behaviors, adaptation, and
mitigation, making it essential in creating a more resilient Cambridge.
Existing Capabilities: The city has made a concerted effort to develop public education and
materials about climate resilience and hazard mitigation. One example of the city’s education and
outreach effort is a climate focused public health training curriculum and outreach plan that is
currently in development for the Cambridge Community Corps and other partners to use. The city
has also developed a flood viewer for residents to look up their risk to flooding and homeowner
and small business toolkits provide guidance on how to adapt to flood and extreme heat.
Capability Gaps: One of the challenges for Cambridge is providing emergency response to
priority populations before, during, and after natural hazard events. The intent of the city is to
provide access to emergency management resources and enhance the education of first
responders to provide services to persons with disabilities and those with language barriers.

7. Mitigation Actions: Past, Present, and Future
7.1. Overview of Mitigation Actions
The mitigation actions are among the most important components of the Hazard Mitigation Plan.
They serve as the blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the risk and vulnerability
assessment. They can be a measure, project, plan, or activity proposed to achieve the city’s
mission and goals and reduce current and future vulnerabilities described in the risk assessment
(Chapter 5).
There are many distinct types of hazard mitigation actions that generally fall into the following four
categories (FEMA, Local Mitigation Planning Handbook, 2023):
Local Plans and Regulations: These actions include government
authorities, policies or codes that influence the way land and buildings are
developed and built.
Structure and Infrastructure Projects: These actions involve
modifying existing structures and infrastructure to protect them from a hazard
or remove them from a hazard area. This could apply to public or private
structures as well as critical facilities and infrastructure.
Natural Systems Protection and Nature-based Solutions: This
type of action can include green infrastructure and low impact development,
and bioengineering to incorporate natural features or processes into the built
environment to reduce, treat and store rainwater.
Education and Awareness Programs: These types of actions keep
residents informed about potential natural disasters. Many of these types of
actions are eligible for funding through the FEMA HMA program.

Through a stakeholder and community engagement process discussed in Chapter 2, mitigation
actions and an action plan for implementation were developed to help achieve the mitigation goals
(See Chapter 1 Section 1.4). This provides a framework to prioritize and implement actions to
reduce risks during hazards. Section 7 reviews the mitigation actions created in 2015 and outlines
mitigation actions for Cambridge for the next five years.

7.2. Status of 2015 Mitigation Actions
At the April 24, 2023, meeting of the Steering Committee, city staff reviewed the mitigation
measures identified in the 2015 HMP and determined whether measures identified in that plan had
been implemented or deferred. Implemented projects were categorized as either complete or in
progress, with the latter referring to projects still under development or begun but not yet
completed. If measures had been deferred, the STC evaluated whether the measure should be
deleted or carried forward into this 2023 NHMP Update. The decision on whether to delete or
retain a particular measure was based on the STC’s assessment of the continued relevance or
effectiveness of the measure and whether the deferral of action on the measure was due to the
inability of the city to take action on the measure because it is outside of the city’s control. Table
7.1 lists all mitigation actions from the 2015 HMP and their current status.

7.3. Mitigation Action and Adaptation Strategy
for 2023-2028
The Planning Committee developed an updated natural hazard mitigation action and adaptation
strategy for the 2023 NHMP. There are 46 actions developed from a multi-faceted approach,
including the following:
•
•
•
•
•

The goals and objectives endorsed by the Steering Committee; more detail about this is
available in Chapter 1.
Input from stakeholders through the HMPT workshops and the community through public
meetings and survey input; more detail about this is available in Chapter 2.
A hazard and climate change risk and vulnerability assessment; more detail about this is
available in Chapter 3.
The City’s capacity to mitigate and respond to hazard events as described in Chapter 6.
The progress of actions from the 2015 HMP; more detail about this is available in Chapter
7 Section 7.2.

•

Actions included in related plans and reports; more details about this is available in
Chapters 2 and 6.

The actions in Chapter 7 include both specific projects and broader results to be achieved by
implementing a project. The level of specificity differs based on the input received and the currently
available data associated with the mitigation action. In some cases, actions are broader because
the specific steps to accomplish the result may not be determined at this point in time. These
actions will all be tracked and updated during the quarterly plan maintenance and review,
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8.

7.3.1 | Overview of Mitigation Action Characteristics
Based on each mitigation action characteristic, the city will be able to complete the following:
• assign a lead in-house entity.
• understand general cost and benefit of an action, location, and extent of the action’s effort.
• understand available funding source(s).
• determine if the action should start in the short, mid-, or longer portion of the 5-year
update.
• tie the action to goals and natural hazards.
• confirm consistency with other local plans.
• and consider equity and inclusion co-benefits.
See definitions as follows.
Lead Department: Many hazard mitigation actions and climate adaptation
measures will require a multi-department strategy where several departments
share responsibility. The designation of implementation responsibility was
assigned based on general knowledge of the responsibility of each department.
Additionally, some mitigation actions may require cooperation with outside
entities, such as Massachusetts state departments, neighboring communities,
regional organizations, or private entities. In those cases, the relevant entities are
included in additional to the city department.
Cost: Costs listed in the mitigation action spreadsheet are estimated and are
based on the cost of similar projects and professional estimates. Actual costs
may vary based on the specific site, project, and scope of work. Cost estimates
should be verified during the financial planning stage of a project. For the
mitigation action spreadsheet, cost was classified into one of four categories:
•
•
•

High = Over $1M
Medium = Over $100 - $1M
Low = Up to $100K

Geographic Coverage: This column pertains to the geographic area over
which a mitigation action will be carried out. Geographic coverage can be
classified into one of four categories•

Regional: a regional mitigation action would extend beyond the city limits
of Cambridge and involve regional partners

•

City-wide: a city-wide mitigation action pertains to the entire City of
Cambridge

•

Neighborhood specific: a neighborhood-specific mitigation action applies
only within the boundaries of a certain neighborhood or smaller area
within the city.

•

Site-specific: a site-specific mitigation action applies on the smallest,
most localized scale at a specific point within the City of Cambridge

Funding Source: The City’s general funds or capital budgets are considered
a default potential funding source unless the City pursues additional funding. The
identification of potential funding sources is preliminary and may vary depending
on numerous factors. These factors include but are not limited to changes in
grant eligibility criteria, program objectives, and funding availability. The funding
sources identified are not a guarantee that a specific project will be eligible for or
receive funding. Upon adoption of this plan, the local representatives responsible
for implementation should begin to explore potential funding sources in more
detail. Potential grants were assigned based on eligibility and competitiveness,
but the recommendations may not be comprehensive. Please note that grant
eligibility and scoring criteria should also be reviewed prior to applying. Grants
may also only be a source of funding for a single stage of a project. In many
cases, the actions will require a combination of funding sources.

Associated Goals: This column lists which goals the mitigation action aims
to accomplish. Some actions contribute toward more than one goal. The five
goals of the Hazard Mitigation Plan are as follows:
•

Equitably protect health and safety

•

Communicate

•

Coordinate and collaborate.

•

Sustainably invest.

•

Monitor and respond

Hazards: Actions may mitigate a single or multiple hazards, which will be
indicated for each action. All the hazards discussed in Chapter 3 were
addressed when developing the priority list, and there is at least one action
associated with each hazard. Some actions address all hazards and are listed as
such.
Consistency with Other Plans: It is crucial that the Hazard Mitigation Plan
be aligned with other long-range planning documents for the City of Cambridge.
This column demonstrates areas where mitigation actions overlap with the intent
of other planning documents.
Inclusion and Equity/Co-Benefits: The City of Cambridge recognizes the
importance of equity in hazard mitigation planning. Inclusion and equity are vital
so that all voices are heard during the planning and implementation processes.
Actions were developed with equity and inclusion in mind. Some actions also
have indirect benefits associated with them, also known as “co-benefits.” There
are many co-benefits associated with the City of Cambridge’s mitigation actions.
Some include:
•

A positive impact on students

•

A positive impact on priority populations

•

Enhances community education.

•

A positive impact on renters

•

Equitable implementation

7.3.2 | Prioritization
Actions were prioritized based on based on staff capacity and available funding. Staff capacity was
assessed in Chapter 6 – Capabilities Assessment. Priority was given to actions which also have a
high likelihood of receiving federal, state, or local funding. The questions to assess likelihood of
funding were:
• Does this action contribute to regional resilience?
• Is the action part of other plans?

Does the action positively impact residents of Low to Moderate Income (LMI) or
Environmental Justice (EJ) census block groups (based on EEA’s viewer)?
Is this action a nature-based solution?
Would the action mitigate economic loss/damage?
Will the action reduce risk to life/safety?
Does the action address future climate change projections?
Does the action leverage innovation/technology?

7.3.3 | Funding Sources
Traditional funding sources within the City of Cambridge, such as funding from capital budgets,
operating budgets, municipal bonds, and staff time, should cover the majority of costs associated
with the mitigation action items detailed in Table 7-2. This has been noted in the funding source
column in Table 7-2.
Grant funding is another option. There are a variety of funding sources available for Massachusetts
municipalities, both through the state and federal governments. A full list of funding opportunities
can be found on the Community Grant Finder webpage: https://www.mass.gov/lists/communitygrant-finder#community-development-. The Community Grant finder provides a streamlined
interface where municipalities can easily learn about grant opportunities. Table 7-2 notes where
grant funds are a desired source of funding for a mitigation action.

8. Plan Maintenance
Hazard Mitigation Plans are intended to serve as living documents. To be impactful, they must be
regularly updated to reflect the current state of hazards, vulnerabilities, goals, strategies, and
public sentiment. The three main components of plan maintenance are: monitoring, evaluating,
and updating the plan.
Included in this chapter is a multi-pronged strategy to always keep the city’s Natural Hazard
Mitigation Plan as effective as possible. Monitoring, evaluating, and updating the plan will be
intertwined with public engagement, integration with other local, regional, and state planning
mechanisms, and plan implementation. These processes will all run on an ongoing basis with the
expectation there is coordination and collaboration between monitoring, evaluating, and updating
the plan.
A representative from the City Manager's Office will take ownership of monitoring, evaluating, and
updating the plan.
The representative from the City Manager's Office will:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Track the progress of the NHMP Mitigation Actions (see Section 8.1).
Reconvene the Steering Committee annually to monitor, evaluate, update, and integrate
the plan (see Section 8.1, 8,.2, 8.3, and 8.4).
Share NHMP progress with the public, every thirty months. (See Section 8.5).
Make all monitoring information publicly available (see Section 8.1).
Notify the public when added information has been posted or updated (see Section 8.5;
and
Provide the public opportunities to give input on this information (see Section 8.5).

8.1. Monitoring the Plan
According to FEMA, monitoring means tracking the implementation of the NHMP over time.
Who: The representative from the City Manager's Office will take ownership of monitoring the
plan.
How: The representative from the City Manager’s Office will monitor the status of mitigation
actions (Chapter 8) through an internal tracking system using Excel. This documentation should
be made publicly available on a website.
When: Monitoring will take place on an ongoing basis with annual meetings of the Steering
Committee to formally update the status of Mitigation Actions. In advance of this meeting, the
representative from the City Manager's Office will send out notices to the Steering Committee that
will include a shared document where all Committee members can collaborate to review status
of mitigation actions and identify any new mitigation actions that may be under consideration or
in progress as part of ongoing City efforts.

a

8-2
Packet Pg. 229

8.2. Evaluating the Plan
According to FEMA, evaluating means assessing the effectiveness of the plan at achieving its
stated purpose and goals.
Who and When: The Steering Committee will meet annually, ideally before the budget season,
to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan. The Steering Committee may also be called to meet after
a major event or storm to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan.
How: The Steering Committee will:
•
•

Review the 2023 NHMP Goals and Objectives presented in Chapter 1; and
Discuss how mitigation actions are or are not meeting 2023 NHMP Goals and where
improvements or adjustments may be needed (e.g., re-prioritization of projects, integrating
with other planning processes more effectively, adding new data to climate projections,
etc.)

8.3. Updating the Plan
8.3.1 | Plan Updates to Maintain FEMA Funding Eligibility
According to FEMA, updating means reviewing and revising the NHMP at least once every five
years.
Hazard Mitigation Plans expire five years from the date approved by FEMA. To maintain eligibility
for certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance from FEMA, an entity such as the City of
Cambridge must have an approved active Hazard Mitigation Plan.
Hazard Mitigation Plans should be reviewed and updated at least every five years. The
representative from the City Manager's Office will initiate the process to complete a comprehensive
update to the NHMP. As a best practice, the comprehensive update should be initiated at least 18
months prior to this NHMP’s expiration. This process includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Re-engaging the Steering Committee.
Considering expansion of the Steering Committee.
Confirming FEMA’s and MEMA’s most recent requirements and guidance.
Gathering updated information and relevant documents.
Defining a list of stakeholders (such as the HMPT discussed in Chapter 2).
Initiating an outreach and engagement process, as appropriate.
Undertaking the planning steps to prepare required Plan sections; and
Completing and reviewing the draft Plan and submitting for approval.

The city may elect to complete this process in-house or with guidance from an outside contractor.

a

8-3
Packet Pg. 230

8.3.2 | Plan Updates Due to Major Disaster Events or New
Conditions
FEMA recommends that NHMPs also be revisited and updated after a major disaster event (a
State or Federally declared disaster) or if new conditions significantly change risk (such as new
climate projections or local risk and vulnerability assessment efforts). The representative from the
City Manager's Office will initiate the process to complete any updates needed in these
circumstances. The decision to update the plan will be based on the annual monitoring and
evaluation process.

8.4. Integrating the NHMP
To be impactful, the NHMP must be effectively integrated into other City planning mechanisms.
This will increase co-benefits of hazard mitigation projects, streamline planning and
implementation activities, and help secure funding for NHMP projects.
Integrating the ideas, information, and strategy of a mitigation plan into other planning
mechanisms can be achieved through plan integration. Plan integration involves a two-way
exchange of information and incorporation of ideas and concepts between hazard mitigation plans
and other planning mechanisms. Some ways Cambridge will integrate the ideas, information, and
strategy of a mitigation plan into other planning mechanisms are:
Building and Zoning Regulations: The local hazard mitigation plan can
integrate with building and zoning regulations to ensure that new construction and
development are designed to withstand potential hazards.
Community Plans: Community planning mechanisms can be integrated into
hazard mitigation plans to ensure that community needs and concerns are
considered when developing hazard mitigation strategies. As other local plans,
such as Envision Cambridge, Resilient Cambridge, the Urban Forest Master Plan,
and the Parks & Open Space Plan, are reviewed and updated, relevant information
from this NHMP will be incorporated. Funding to undertake mitigation actions
described in Chapter 7 will be included in the city’s budget process.
Emergency Management Plan: The local hazard mitigation plan can
integrate with the relevant emergency management plans led by staff in the Police,
Fire, and Health Departments, to ensure that hazard mitigation strategies are
coordinated with emergency response efforts. In addition, mitigation actions
included in Chapter 7 will be incorporated into the budgeting process for Police,
Fire, and Health Departments.
Partnerships: Developing strong partnerships between planners and emergency
managers can help to fully integrate land use and hazard planning efforts. For
example, staff from CDD work collaboratively with the Cambridge Public Health
Department to plan for and employ public health emergency response.

City of Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan

Attachment: 2023NHMP_ChaptersCompiled (COF 2023 #222 : A communication was received from Climate Resilience Project Planner, Leila

a

8-4
Packet Pg. 231

Integration will be a topic of discussion at each annual update meeting. NHMP goals and
mitigation actions will be integrated into other City planning mechanisms. At each annual Steering
Committee meeting, there will be an update on the progress of integration of mitigation actions
into relevant planning mechanisms and a discussion of other planning mechanisms that should be
integrated into the next five-year NHMP update.

8.5. Public Participation throughout Plan
Maintenance
Public engagement is a critical part of the plan maintenance process. Public input, education, and
support are crucial to ensuring that the plan is effective, equitable, and impactful. During this
project, a StoryMap was prepared to document findings and can be updated as a reference point
for the public.
A coordinated public engagement effort will be led by the representative from the City Manager's
Office, however, should be coordinated or delegated to community engagement staff to ensure
alignment with other City outreach efforts.
Below are four categories of engagement activities that will solicit diverse types of results.
•

•

•

•

Public Education activities are solely focused on transparency and providing the
public with information regarding the monitoring, evaluation, and implementation of the
Plan. Additionally, providing supporting general education on how to make individualized
hazard preparedness plans for households.
Public Input activities are focused on soliciting feedback, ideas, concerns, and other
input. These activities will aim to be as inclusive and accessible as possible. Public input
intends to gather feedback from all communities, particularly those who are:
o most affected by hazards
o underheard
o underserved
o historically excluded.
Active Engagement refers to the steering committee’s role to continue monitoring and
adjusting to the effectiveness, performance, and equity of the NHMP as it goes through
maintenance, implementation, and integration with other planning mechanisms.
Reactionary Engagement refers to activities that directly follow a large storm or
event. These activities will be particularly concerned with the safety of residents,
performance of projects, and impacts on priority populations.

Below are activities in each of these categories that the City may undertake, as appropriate for the
situation, at the discretion of the representative from the City Manager's Office, and the Steering
Committee:

This is defined by FEMA as a facility
where even a low risk of disruption
would constitute a severe threat. FEMA
includes hospitals, fire stations, police

Resilience

The ability to withstand and swiftly
recover from an extreme event. Ideally,
resilient systems “bounce forward” to
create healthier, greener, and more
equitable systems and spaces.

Options or Examples

Annual probability of occurrence of an
event. Also known as recurrence interval.
Used in design based on risk tolerance
of the asset.

For example, a critical
building, such as a hospital
that needs to be functioning
at all times, has a lower risk
tolerance and hence the
0.1% (or 1000-year)
recurrence interval is
recommended for design.
However, a recreational
facility, such as a recreation
center, has a higher risk
tolerance and hence the
20% (or 5-year) recurrence
interval is recommended for
design.

Risk

According to SHMCAP, risk is defined as
“the potential for an unwanted outcome
resulting from a hazard event, as
determined by its likelihood and
associated consequences; and
expressed, when possible, in dollar
losses. Risk represents potential future
losses, based on assessments of
probability, severity, and vulnerability.” 28

For example, if a state
highway is flooded that also
serves as an evacuation
route, it will have a high
probability of flooding and
its consequence of flooding
(as measured by its
severity, with respect to
geographic area and
people affected, economic
impacts and cascading
impacts to other
infrastructure) will also be
high, which would lead to a
high risk rating.

Risk

For the purpose of hazard mitigation
planning is the potential for damage or
loss created by the interaction of natural
hazards with assets, such as buildings,

For example, a lower
severity Public Health and
Safety Impact would be that
loss of building may result
in minor injuries. A higher
severity would be that loss
of life is expected as a
result of loss of building.

strategies with hazard mitigation
planning, also complies with current
federal requirements for state hazard
mitigation plans and maintains the
Commonwealth’s eligibility for federal
disaster recovery and hazard mitigation
funding under the Stafford Act. 33

Steering
Committee (STC)

A designated group of representatives
responsible for guiding the development,
implementation, and oversight of the
hazard mitigation plan. Members may
include key stakeholders, agency
officials, and community leaders.

Storm Surge

An abnormal rise in sea level
accompanying a hurricane or other
intense storm, whose height is the
difference between the observed level of
the sea surface and the level that would
have occurred in the absence of the
cyclone. 34

Stormwater
Flooding

Stormwater flooding can be caused by
excessive rainfall that overwhelms
drainage systems and leads to water
accumulation in low lying areas. It can
also be caused or exacerbated by
snowmelt. More frequent and intense
downpours, projected for all regions of
the country, can overwhelm the design
capacity of municipal stormwater
management systems. Overwhelmed
stormwater management systems can
lead to backups that cause localized
flooding.

Stormwater
Management

Strategies and techniques to control the
quantity and quality of stormwater runoff,
mitigating flooding and pollution impacts
on local water bodies.

Storm surge is usually
estimated by subtracting
the normal or astronomic
tide from the observed
storm tide.

Description

Tree Canopy

Tree canopy refers to the part of a city
that is shaded by trees.

Underserved
Communities

Options or Examples

Populations sharing a particular
characteristic, as well as geographic
communities that have been
systematically denied a full opportunity
to participate in aspects of economic,
social and civic life. The barriers to
opportunity and participation these
communities face have been occurring
throughout history and continue today. 35

Urban Heat Island
Effect (UHI)

Vulnerability

Dark, paved, and impervious surfaces,
such as asphalt roads and buildings with
black roofs, contribute to the urban heat
island effect. These surfaces absorb
more heat than vegetated or light
colored surfaces, and they release this
heat back into the surrounding
environment.
A description of which assets, including
structures, systems, populations and
other assets as defined by the
community, within locations identified to
be hazard-prone, are at risk from
the effects of the identified hazard(s). 36

Water Surface
Elevation

35
36

Water Surface Elevation is the projected
elevation for a specific future flood event,
considering storm surge, tides, and
wave setup. This is provided as a data
value output of the Tool from the
Massachusetts Coastal Flood Risk
Model (MC-FRM).
