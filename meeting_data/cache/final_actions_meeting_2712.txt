the area immediately in front of the facility and the
parking lot. It is downcast and will not project on
to abutting properties. Security cameras have
infrared capabilities and do not require light for
full functionality.

Standard 11.805(d): In retail areas, the location and design of the Cannabis
Use will not detract from the sense of activity with opaque, unwelcoming
façades at the ground floor. Where interior activities must be screened from
public view, such areas should be screened by transparent, publicly
accessible active business uses where possible. Opaque façades should be
minimized, and where they are necessary they should include changing
public art displays or other measures to provide visual interest to the public.

Rotating, quarterly public art demonstration in first floor windows along Third Street and
Monsignor O’Brien Highway through partnership with the Cambridge Arts Council.
As demonstrated on floor plan, the interior displays are offset from the window by
approximately 24 inches, providing a sense of depth. Inverted windows are proposed to
allow light to flow into the facility at the tops of the windows without allowing visual
access within the facility.

• 59 adult use marijuana retailers had opened;
• 163 adult use marijuana retailers had a provisional or final license and were preparing
to open; and
• 105 adult use marijuana retailers were pending in Massachusetts.
APPOINTMENT ONLY OPERATIONS ALLOW US TO PACE CUSTOMER ACCESS.
For the first three months of operation , customers will be required to make an
appointment using Nuestra’s website and indicate the means by which they seek to
access the facility, allowing us to ensure that we can accommodate them without
causing unintended nuisance. Under no circumstances will we overbook our parking
lot.
Up to 50 customers can safely be accommodated inside at any time (10 in vestibule, 40
in sales area) based on building code in addition to staff. We do not anticipate reaching
that occupancy. Recent traffic studies conducted by Hayes Engineering of high density
dispensaries indicate that approximately 20-30 customers visit during peak hour.
Please see the Opening Day Plan in Nuestra’s special permit materials.

Security

• Perimeter security, including motion sensors, alarms, and video surveillance, will be
installed to protect the site from unauthorized intrusion. Intrusion detection sensors will be
placed on all exit and entry points, including windows. Extensive video surveillance will be
placed on the exterior of the facility and all interior locations that may contain cannabis.
Duress, panic, and hold-up alarms will be located strategically throughout the facility.
• Multiple redundant alarm systems will be operating to ensure that the system does not fail
in the case of power outage.
• Live security guards will monitor camera feeds on site during all hours of operation.
Additionally, feeds will be remotely monitored by offsite 24/7 dispatch team at all times in
addition to looping in to the Cambridge Police Department if desired.
• Products will be located in locked, secure vaults under video surveillance. Only
designated staff will have access to the vault, with layered access badges prohibiting free
staff movement throughout the building. No more than the anticipated inventory required
18
for two days will be stored on site.
Packet Pg. 19

Communication: 200 Monsignor HW_20200908 (PB-366)

• Stringent access control procedures maintain strict control over who is in the facility at any
given moment. Security agents will monitor the interior and exterior of the facility on alert
for suspicious behaviors. They will be trained on Standard Operating Procedures to
respond instantly in crisis situations.

Nuisance
Absolutely NO public consumption is allowed on site or in adjacent areas. If City
officials express that there are any areas of concern nearby, we will offer to install
video surveillance at any location.
Customers visiting the facility for the first time will go through an intake process where
they receive a primer on regulations surrounding cannabis; how to safely consume,
store, and transport their product; and information regarding strains, dosage, and
desired effects. All customers will be required to review and sign a community
norms agreement, in which they certify that they understand that the ability to
utilize Nuestra’s store is contingent on respect for the surrounding
neighborhood. Public consumption, diversion, exterior queuing, loitering, littering,
and other behaviors are not tolerated and practicing them will eliminate the
opportunity for future store visits.
Nuestra’s Chief Engagement Officer will attend all meetings of the East Cambridge
Planning Team to solicit feedback and remain aware of neighborhood issues and
happenings.
Products will arrive pre-packaged, limiting odor impacts. Carbon scrubbers will 19
be
installed within the vault and fulfilment areas.

Packet Pg. 20

Communication: 200 Monsignor HW_20200908 (PB-366)

Nuestra will provide a 24/7 contact phone number to the East Cambridge Planning
Team, interested abutters or nearby residents, and the City.

Although Nuestra does not currently propose an RMD at the site, it will nevertheless
provide programs to assist qualifying patients within the city or neighborhood who
are registered through the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program in
obtaining services under that program.
In Massachusetts is that based on existing state laws, medical marijuana operators are
required to grow what they sell (a term called “vertical integration”), which means that
any company looking to sell in the medical program must undertake a significant
investment to build out a marijuana cultivation and product manufacturing facility as
well, which typically runs between $5m-$10m. While this is an investment that could
be considered over time, it would require the revenues from adult use sales to fund.
The Cannabis Control Commission recently deferred action on any amendments to
this rule during its September regulatory changes, but will seek to review it during its
2021 regulatory session. In the instance that the vertical integration law changes,
Nuestra will seek an additional Special Permit for the RMD use at the site.

BRIDGE

City should study bridge FAR
bonus section further (pg. 8-9)

PETITION

FAR bonus achievable by
(a) Construction of bridge
(b) Design buildings
incorporating bridge
structural elements
(c) Conveyance of property
interests
(d) Contribution of significant
funds

FEEDBACK

Intent was to create a
mechanism where the Planning
Board could make a finding that
future development proposals
are facilitating one or more
bridge connections from
Quadrangle to Triangle in a
manner that takes into
consideration the physical
limitations of each specific
property.

COMMENT

CDD MEMO Aug. 28, 2020 / CLARIFICATIONS

PARKING

• Authorize Planning Board to
establish parking maximums
(pg. 5)
• What is the intended effect
of eliminating max height of
off-street parking facilities?
(pg. 6)
• Cover parking with
landscaping to minimize
urban height island effect.
(pg. 6)

PETITION

• Parking minimums shall not
apply.
• Maximum height of offstreet facilities shall not
apply.
• Parking covering not
specifically mentioned but
included by reference to
Alewife District Plan.

FEEDBACK

• Intent was for TP&T and
Planning Board to determine
appropriate parking given (1)
the proposed uses, in
particular the ground-floor
uses, and (2) the adequacy of
the existing local public
infrastructure in area.
• Intent was to maximize offstreet shared parking in a
centralized location, which
could necessitate taller
garages.
• Agree that covered parking
could be included
(landscaping & solar).
