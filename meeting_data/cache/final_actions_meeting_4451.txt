Executive Summary
Project Overview

Current Climate Conditions

Extreme heat and air pollution are recognized as two of the most significant
impacts of climate change facing many cities, especially in urban areas where the
dense built environment absorbs and retains heat, resulting in higher temperatures
(known as the urban heat island effect). Urban heat island and air pollution effects
often disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, low-income communities
and people of color.

The assessment considers the current climate in the Boston metropolitan area with
accommodations for changes in wind speed and solar irradiance due to localized site
conditions.

In order to better understand the potential for mitigating extreme heat impacts and
air pollution along Rindge Avenue as part of the proposed development for the
area, community group Friends of Jerry’s Pond (FOJP) asked Arup to perform a
high-level thermal comfort and air pollution analysis along Rindge Avenue,
adjacent to Cambridge’s most vulnerable environmental justice community
FOJP requested an analysis to compare two landscape designs proposed for the
redevelopment and restoration of Jerry’s Pond and its public access ways and
spaces:
1. A plan proposed by FOJP, which presents an expanded, gradually sloped,
landscaped pond bank with a significant new tree canopy.
2. The current plan proposed for the Rindge Avenue embankment by the site
owners, IQHQ, which calls for a boardwalk and a small number of new trees
planted in a steep bank.
The developer, IQHQ, supports renewed access to the pond and proposes a
boardwalk and planting of ~12 new trees along Rindge Avenue, abutting Jerry’s
Pond. FOJP proposes a greater number of trees (~165) and vegetation in a
landscaped park on the southern end of Jerry’s Pond along Rindge Avenue. The
focus of this analysis is comparing the effects on pollution and thermal comfort
between these two plans.

The site experiences cool winters and hot summers with winds that typically blow from
the southwest to northwest. Particularly in the warmer spring and summer months, the
presence of the surrounding built area and the proposed trees and vegetation in FOJP’s
proposal provide additional shade from sunlight and shelter from the prevailing wind
directions, reducing the proportion of time that pedestrians and occupants will experience
uncomfortable wind speeds and higher levels of thermal stress. In addition, air pollution
is reduced by greater distances between the road and sidewalk in FOJP’s proposal.

Future Climate Conditions and City Climate Goals
By 2070, the City of Cambridge is projected to experience as many as 68 days over
90°F (compared to a historic baseline of approximately 11 days) and an average summer
heat index as high as 110°F. As a result, extreme heat is one of the primary hazards
addressed in the Resilient Cambridge Plan and the City's Urban Forest Master Plan,
Healthy Forest Healthy City.
The City's vision for resilience and a healthy urban forest include significant goals to
increase urban tree canopy, provide improved vegetation and green space, reduce urban
heat island impacts, and ensure an equitable canopy distribution. The FOJP proposal will
help advance these efforts and provide an example of how ongoing development can
contribute to the City’s goals of reducing urban heat island impacts and enhancing tree
canopy coverage throughout the city.

Executive Summary
Observations
Thermal Comfort

Air Pollution

Increasing extreme temperatures are a recognized symptom of climate change that is
exacerbated within densely built environments due to the urban heat island effect. To
better understand this impact along Rindge Avenue, Cambridge-based community
group Friends of Jerry’s Pond (FOJP) requested Arup conduct a high-level thermal
comfort assessment comparing present-day conditions with future climate projections.

The pandemic has highlighted the importance of maintaining outdoor spaces for
people to gather and breathe fresh air. Reducing air pollution will offer significant
benefits to public health in an overburdened community. Trees are one means to
reach this goal of cleaner air. They have a complex impact on urban air quality
that often results in a net reduction in pollution concentrations*. They remove
gaseous pollutants via absorption through their leaves which can also intercept
airborne particles. Their effects on wind flow can carry the toxic contents of
vehicular exhausts (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons from unburnt fuel, nitrogen
oxides, and particulate matter including soot) toward or away from a location,
while also promoting turbulence that increases the rate of exhaust dilution
(mixing with air).

Arup projected climate data over the next several decades based on WeatherShift
predictions. Arup evaluated the changes in feel temperature (Universal Thermal
Climate Index, or UTCI) and the increase in the number of days with heat discomfort
conditions. The comparison was performed for the two landscape designs proposed for
the redevelopment and restoration of Jerry’s Pond and its public access ways and
spaces:
1. A plan proposed by FOJP, which presents an expanded, gradually sloped,
landscaped pond bank with a significant new tree canopy.
2. The current plan proposed for the Rindge Avenue embankment by the site owners,
IQHQ, which calls for a large boardwalk and a small number of new trees.

FOJP requested Arup conduct a high-level assessment of the effect that future
climate conditions and planted trees will have on vehicular pollutant
concentrations along Rindge Avenue. Arup employed a simplified methodology
to model the spread of exhaust plumes from nearby vehicles and applied a
reduction factor to consider the general impact that trees and vegetation will have
on vehicular pollutant concentrations.

Executive Summary
Observations
Thermal Comfort

Air Pollution

The analysis, summarized below for annual changes across two future projection
periods, shows an increase in the amount of time that pedestrians within the spaces
around Jerry’s Pond will experience heat discomfort conditions due to climate
change. The added shade provided by the additional trees in the plan proposed by
FOJP will mitigate this effect on thermal comfort.

The design by FOJP, compared to the landscape design by IQHQ, lowers a
pedestrian’s exposure to vehicular emissions and results in a net decrease in
pollutant concentrations along Rindge Avenue. The placement of
pedestrians farther away from the street plays a key part in this reduction.
Other mitigation measures that aim to improve air quality within urban
environments will have additional impact on vehicular pollutant
concentration levels as climate conditions change in the coming decades.

City of Cambridge Climate Planning and Goals
Cambridge Climate Change Planning
The City of Cambridge is a recognized leader on climate change, proactively addressing
both the causes and the impacts of the climate crisis. While increased flooding and extreme
storm events are often the most recognized climate change impact, increases in extreme
heat are a significant risk to the City of Cambridge and its residents. Extreme heat events
present a significant public health impact and are one of the leading causes of weatherrelated deaths in the country. They can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and contribute
to pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. The City's recently released Resilient Cambridge
Plan and Urban Forest Master Plan both demonstrate a strong commitment to enhanced
open space and increased tree canopy coverage Citywide, which can help alleviate extreme
heat impacts and provide positive health benefits for the residents of Cambridge.

Furthermore, the City's Urban Forest Master Plan, Healthy Forest Healthy
City, demonstrates how vital a healthy urban forest is to the livelihood of the
City. The vision the City lays out includes cool corridors for residents to
walk, bike, and run in more comfortable and shaded environments; a need for
collective action where residents, developers, business owners, property
owners, and the City work together to create and maintain a strong urban
forest; improved urban habitats; reduced heat island impacts driven by a 30%
increase in canopy cover; and an equitable canopy distribution.
Implementation of the Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal along Rindge Avenue
can demonstrate clear action to support the strong vision and goals presented
by the City through its recent planning efforts.

Extreme Heat Projections
According to Cambridge's Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Resilient
Cambridge Plan, the City could experience as many as 68 days over 90°F by 2070 with
approximately 16 of those days experiencing temperatures above 100°F. Furthermore, the
average summer heat index may be as high as 110°F by 2070.

Advancing Cambridge's Climate Change Goals
The Resilient Cambridge Plan lays out four key focus areas to reduce the risks associated
with climate change: Closer Neighborhoods, Better Buildings, Stronger Infrastructure, and
Greener City. The Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal fits squarely within these overarching
resilience focus areas: it will indirectly support a more connected Alewife/North
Cambridge neighborhood by providing enhanced open space and strong connections to
nature that is likely to encourage community gathering and social cohesion; and it will
directly support the City's plans to "make improvements to public spaces like street
corridor parks and support increasing tree canopy and plant cover on private properties"
(Resilient Cambridge Plan).

Arup used the online tool WeatherShift to gather hourly weather data for expected,
future climate conditions. To generate this data, WeatherShift applied projected
changes from an ensemble of global climate models (GCMs) to transform monthly
averages of climatic variables describing current-day conditions. These GCMs were
run for Assessment Reports (AR) prepared by the United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and evaluated for several future time periods.
As indicated to the right*, among the atmospheric and weather phenomena that are
impacted by climate change, extreme heat and hot conditions are best understood by
the climate modeling community. The impact to precipitation (or lack of) can be
predicted with moderate confidence, while the most uncertainty lies within changes
to mechanisms that control atmospheric weather systems that can affect local wind
speeds. Because of this inherent uncertainty, along with the modeling differences
among the GCMs, a level of variability exists for the projection of each weather
parameter. To account for this, WeatherShift provides a range of data predictions
from which a statistical position (i.e., percentile) can be selected.

Wind Speed

Atmospheric systems and wind speeds are particularly challenging systems to model for future climate impacts and changes, especially when trying to downscale to local
climate conditions; therefore, the data is coarser and more variable. The projected wind speeds evaluated from WeatherShift reflect the challenges of this type of
modeling, which results in some inconsistent trends. When averaged over the month for the future climate scenarios, the wind speeds will not change significantly
enough to alter the wind comfort conditions around Jerry’s Pond. However, these relatively smaller changes in wind can have a greater impact on air quality, affecting
how far away emission plumes travel and how they dissipate and mix with the ambient air.

Methodology
The Science of Thermal Comfort Analysis
Outdoor spaces are used for many purposes. Arup takes a holistic approach to
microclimate analysis that considers various built and natural environmental
factors that affect comfort for activity types such as sitting, strolling, and
general walkability.
Four environmental factors based on recorded weather data are collated into a
typical year’s profile:
• Dry Bulb Temperature (commonly called air temperature)
• Relative Humidity
• Solar Radiation
• Wind Speed
Two personal factors affect individuals’ comfort:
• Activity determines metabolic rate and sensitivity to some environmental
factors
• Clothing insulates against temperatures and reduces sensitivity to
temperature changes

Sit and meet

Stroll and play

These six factors affect thermal comfort (our perception of the space we
occupy; often referred to as “feels like” temperature in weather apps) and
usability (our likelihood to remain in a space to perform some activity).

Thermal Comfort Metrics
Wind
The Lawson Criteria are used to describe the windiness around
the site in terms of acceptable activity in that area. Typical
wind speeds in miles per hour (mph) in each space are lower
than the threshold ranges specified for each activity (shown to
the right). The wind climate around the Boston metropolitan
area, including Cambridge, shows a predominance of winds
arriving from the Southwest to Northwest directions.

Cambridge

Solar Radiation
Solar gains describe the total heat energy from the sun
available over the course of a day over an area. Increased solar
gains may be desired in winter, when shorter days and lower
sun angles naturally reduce the availability of sunlight.
Shading in summer can mitigate heat from direct sunlight.

Cambridge
Feel Temperature / Universal Thermal Comfort Index
(UTCI)
Outdoor thermal comfort is described by the “feels like”
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). This feel temperature
is estimated using the Universal Thermal Climate Index
(UTCI), which considers local climate parameters (air
temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed) and
correlates them with different physiological responses, from
comfortable to extreme heat/cold stress. In the Boston
metropolitan area, conditions can reach close to 100°F in the
summer and fall below freezing in the winter.

represented typical conditions for the current day and for the years 2030 and 2070.
The number of hours between 8am – 8pm, the occupiable period of the spaces around
Jerry’s Pond, above UTCI thresholds for two levels of heat discomfort (moderate and

Climate change increases the frequency that pedestrians will be exposed to thermal conditions inducing heat discomfort. This increase is seen with both proposed landscape
designs, approximately doubling or tripling from current-day conditions.
The shade provided by the additional trees proposed by FOJP reduces the occurrences of experiencing heat discomfort, compared against the IQHQ design. Across the two
projected future climates, the landscape design proposed by FOJP will result in 85 – 112 fewer hours with moderate or greater heat discomfort or 14 – 18 fewer days with at
least one hour of these conditions. The occurrences of strong or very strong heat discomfort (UTCI > 90°F) sees a greater increase relative to current-day climate conditions.
In the future climate scenario, the landscape design by FOJP will result in 35–77 fewer hours of strong or very strong heat discomfort and 4 – 17 fewer days with at least one
hour of these conditions.

In the summer, both measures of heat discomfort occurrence reflect the same trend as the annual increase due to climate change. Over the two future climate
conditions, moderate or greater heat discomfort occurs at a reduced frequency between 59 – 64 fewer hours in the FOJP landscape design compared to the IQHQ
design, and between 5 – 11 fewer days with at least one hour of these feel temperatures. Strong or very strong heat discomfort conditions occur at a reduced
frequency between 23 – 64 fewer hours or between 2 – 16 fewer days with at least one hour of these feel temperatures.

Methodology
Time Frame of Analysis

Hourly basis

Temperature of Vehicular Exhausts

122°F*

As an exhaust plume is emitted from a source, it will mix with the surrounding air.
Concentrations of particulate matter within the exhaust will vary over time
depending on a number of factors including the distance away from the release
point, wind speed, and the difference between the exhaust and ambient
temperatures. To consider this dispersion mechanism, the spread of particulate
matter released from vehicular exhausts pipes is evaluated with a model developed
for simplified assessment of buoyant pollution plumes†. The model assumes that
the plume takes on a conical shape as it flows away from its release point and that
the pollutant concentrations are normally distributed. Pollutants from multiple
sources can be accumulated together to obtain a total concentration for a point
location. We compare the change in concentration between the two landscape
designs and across the future climate scenarios.

Current-day
2030
2070

With the FOJP landscape design, the pollutant concentrations will decrease in the warmer months due to the added trees and the mechanisms by which their leaves can
remove air pollutants. In the winter, when the leaves on deciduous trees have fallen, the warmer ambient temperatures generally result in slightly higher pollutant
concentration at pedestrian level for future climate scenarios. Vehicular exhaust plumes will be less buoyant due to their smaller temperature difference with their
surroundings and will fall to a lower elevation, slightly closer to the pedestrians’ respiratory intakes when they are positioned 20 feet away from the street.
Pollutant concentrations show greater changes with wind speed than with ambient temperature, varying more significantly month by month and with the future climate
scenarios. Higher wind speeds can cause more mixing of the vehicular exhausts with ambient air while also carrying the plumes away or toward the pedestrian. The
combination of these effects, interacting with the change in temperature by month and the trees’ pollutant removal mechanisms, results in lower pollutant concentrations
observed at ground level during the warmer months.

Air Pollution
Climate Change and Landscape Impacts
The position of the walkway farther from the street in the landscape design
proposed by FOJP lowers a pedestrian’s exposure to vehicular emissions. This
results in a net decrease of vehicular pollutant concentrations that pedestrians
are exposed to when compared to the design by IQHQ. The average reduction
throughout the year with current-day and future climate conditions is
approximately 84%.

Current-day
2030
2070

The changes in the wind speeds cause the variability in pollutant concentration
across the months and the future climate conditions. Wind speed has a greater
effect on the amount of pollutant concentration calculated at the pedestrian
location compared to the rise in ambient temperatures. As winds pass through
an area, they will carry away air pollutants that are close to pedestrians and
introduce more mixing with the surrounding air.
The overall impact to air quality from the FOJP landscape design can be
examined in context with other mitigation measures that aim to reduce air
pollution within urban environments. For example, policy changes over the
next several decades can gradually reduce the number of gas-powered cars and
replace them with all-electric vehicles that produce no direct emissions,
addressing the source of the vehicular pollutants at least within the local
boundaries around Jerry’s Pond.

Observations
Heat Discomfort & Air Pollution Effects around Jerry’s Pond
Arup conducted a high-level thermal comfort and vehicular pollutant assessment for
the public spaces around Jerry’s Pond, including Rindge Avenue comparing two
landscape proposals.

Transforming Jerry's Pond and Rindge Avenue from this...

Analysis shows that periods of heat discomfort measured through hours of heat
discomfort and through days with at least one hour of these thermal conditions will
increase due to the rise in ambient temperature associated with climate change. The
cooling and shade provided by the additional trees in the landscape design by FOJP
will reduce the frequency of these occurrences of heat discomfort through the year
between 15% and 64% as the climate warms.
In the landscape design by FOJP, the placement of pedestrians farther away from the
street and the removal of air pollutants via the additional trees will lead to an overall
decrease of approximately 84% in pedestrian exposure to vehicular pollutants around
Jerry’s Pond, compared to IQHQ’s design. These reductions change by month and
across the future climate conditions due to the variability in wind speeds.

...to this!

Under current-day and projected future climate conditions, the FOJP proposed
landscape design demonstrates a more positive impact on thermal comfort and air
quality than IQHQ’s design. It aligns strongly with the City's climate change goals and
is a great example of the type of public, private, and government collaboration that is
needed to advance the City's climate change goals and take meaningful action.

Executive Summary
Project Overview

Current Climate Conditions

Extreme heat is recognized as one of the most significant impacts of climate change facing
many cities, especially in urban areas where the dense built environment absorbs and
retains heat, resulting in higher temperatures (known as the urban heat island effect).
This urban heat island effect often disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations,
low-income communities and people of color.

The assessment considers the current climate in the Boston metropolitan area with
accommodations for changes in wind speed and solar irradiance due to localized
site conditions.

In order to better understand the potential for mitigating extreme heat impacts along Rindge
Avenue as part of the proposed development for the area, community group Friends of
Jerry’s Pond (FOJP) asked Arup to perform a high-level thermal comfort analysis
along Rindge Avenue, adjacent to one of Cambridge’s environmental justice
communities.
FOJP requested an analysis to compare two landscape designs proposed for the
redevelopment and restoration of Jerry’s Pond and its public access ways and spaces:
1. The current plan proposed for the Rindge Avenue embankment by the site owners,
IQHQ, which calls for a large boardwalk and a small number of new trees.
2. An alternative plan proposed by FOJP, which presents an expanded, gradually sloped,
landscaped pond bank with a significant new tree canopy.
The developer, IQHQ, supports renewed access to the pond and proposes a boardwalk and
planting of approximately 12 new trees along Rindge Avenue, abutting Jerry’s Pond.
FOJP proposes a greater number of trees (~165) and vegetation in a landscaped park
on the southern end of Jerry’s Pond along Rindge Avenue. IQHQ is willing to
consider FOJP’s alternative proposal and understanding the impact on thermal
comfort from the additional trees and landscaping along Rindge Avenue, as proposed
by FOJP, is the focus of this analysis.

The site experiences cool winters and hot summers with winds that typically blow
from the southwest to northwest. Particularly in the warmer spring and summer
months, the presence of the surrounding built area and the proposed trees and
vegetation in FOJP’s proposal provide additional shade from sunlight and shelter
from the prevailing wind directions, reducing the proportion of time that
pedestrians and occupants will experience uncomfortable wind speeds and
higher levels of thermal stress.

Future Climate Conditions and City Climate Goals
By 2070, the City of Cambridge is projected to experience as many as 68 days over
90°F (compared to a historic baseline of approximately 11 days) and an average
summer heat index as high as 110°F. As a result, extreme heat is one of the
primary hazards addressed in the Resilient Cambridge Plan and the City's Urban
Forest Master Plan, Healthy Forest Healthy City.
The City's vision for resilience and a healthy urban forest include significant goals to
increase urban tree canopy, provide improved vegetation and green space,
reduce urban heat island impacts, and ensure an equitable canopy distribution.
The FOJP proposal would help advance these efforts and provide an example of
how ongoing development can contribute to the City’s goals of reducing urban
heat island impacts and enhancing tree canopy coverage throughout the city.

Executive Summary
Observations
Compared to the less vegetated environment in the current proposed design, the Friends of
Jerry’s Pond proposal for increased canopy and extensive landscaping along Rindge
Avenue is expected to improve thermal conditions for various activities:
•

•

•
•

•

Annually, there will be about a 16% increase in the amount of time where the most
comfortable wind conditions will be experienced within this area; days with
comfortable wind conditions are likely to increase from 266 days to 325 days
annually.
The expected number of summer days when users will experience moderate heat
(universal thermal comfort index (UTCI), or “feels like” temperature > 80°F) will be
reduced by the equivalent of 1.5 weeks each summer, from approximately 31 summer
days with moderate heat to 20 summer days.
High heat discomfort (UTCI > 90°F) is reduced from the equivalent of 5.5 days to 1.8
days in the summer months.
There is a tradeoff of reduced heat discomfort in the summer months compared to
increased minor cold sensation in the shoulder seasons: while increased shading
improves heat discomfort in the summer months, it will also lead to slightly cooler
sensation in the morning hours (9am-noon) during the spring and autumn. The
benefits from the reduction in moderate heat and high heat discomfort outweigh the
negatives of the increased minor cool sensation.
Transient thermal comfort analysis determines periods of comfortable or
uncomfortable journeys for pedestrians and users in the proposed landscaping design
for various activities. There is an improvement in the transient comfort due to the
added landscaping in the FOJP proposal, extending the usability of the space for
populations across the site.

Coupling this analysis of current conditions with the projected future changes in extreme
heat due to climate change, we can anticipate that the Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal
will have even greater impact in the future as we start to experience higher
temperatures and more extreme heat conditions.

City of Cambridge Climate Planning and Goals
Cambridge Climate Change Planning
The City of Cambridge is a recognized leader on climate change, proactively addressing
both the causes and the impacts of the climate crisis. While increased flooding and
extreme storm events are often the most recognized climate change impact, increases
in extreme heat are a significant risk to the City of Cambridge and its residents.
Extreme heat events present a significant public health impact and are one of the
leading causes of weather-related deaths in the country. They can lead to heat
exhaustion, heat stroke, and contribute to pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. The
City's recently released Resilient Cambridge Plan and Urban Forest Master Plan both
demonstrate a strong commitment to enhanced open space and increased tree canopy
coverage Citywide, which can help alleviate extreme heat impacts and provide
positive health benefits for the residents of Cambridge.

Furthermore, the City's Urban Forest Master Plan, Healthy Forest Healthy City,
demonstrates how vital a healthy urban forest is to the livelihood of the City. The vision the
City lays out includes cool corridors for residents to walk, bike, and run in more
comfortable and shaded environments; a need for collective action where residents,
developers, business owners, property owners, and the City work together to create and
maintain a strong urban forest; improved urban habitats; reduced heat island impacts driven
by a 30% increase in canopy cover; and an equitable canopy distribution. Implementation
of the Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal along Rindge Avenue can demonstrate clear action
to support the strong vision and goals presented by the City through its recent planning
efforts.

Extreme Heat Projections
According to Cambridge's Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Resilient
Cambridge Plan, the City could experience as many as 68 days over 90°F by 2070
with approximately 16 of those days experiencing temperatures above 100°F.
Furthermore, the average summer heat index may be as high as 110°F by 2070.

Advancing Cambridge's Climate Change Goals
The Resilient Cambridge Plan lays out four key focus areas to reduce the risks associated
with climate change: Closer Neighborhoods, Better Buildings, Stronger
Infrastructure, and Greener City. The Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal fits squarely
within these overarching resilience focus areas: it will indirectly support a more
connected Alewife/North Cambridge neighborhood by providing enhanced open
space and strong connections to nature that is likely to encourage community
gathering; and it will directly support the City's plans to "make improvements to
public spaces like street corridor parks and support increasing tree canopy and plant
cover on private properties" (Resilient Cambridge Plan).

Methodology: The Science of
Thermal Comfort Analysis
Outdoor spaces are used for many purposes. Arup takes a holistic approach to
microclimate analysis that considers various built and natural environmental factors
that affect comfort for activity types such as sitting, strolling, and general
walkability.
Four environmental factors based on recorded weather data are collated into a
typical year’s profile:
• Dry Bulb Temperature (commonly called air temperature)
• Relative Humidity
• Solar Radiation
• Wind Speed
Two personal factors affect individuals’ comfort:
• Activity determines metabolic rate and sensitivity to some environmental factors
• Clothing insulates against temperatures and reduces sensitivity to temperature
changes

Sit and meet

Stroll and play

These six factors affect thermal comfort (our perception of the space we occupy;
often referred to as “feels like” temperature in weather apps) and usability (our
likelihood to remain in a space to perform some activity).
Note that equivalent days are calculated by summing the total hours above UTCI
thresholds during a specific time frame and converting to days by dividing by 12
hours, which is based on the occupiable hours during the daytime (defined as 8am8pm).

Methodology: Thermal Comfort Metrics
Wind
The Lawson Criteria are used to describe the windiness around
the site in terms of acceptable activity in that area. Typical wind
speeds in miles per hour (mph) in each space are lower than the
threshold ranges specified for each activity (shown to the right).
The wind climate around the Boston metropolitan area, including
Cambridge, shows a predominance of winds arriving from the
Southwest to Northwest directions.

=

Cambridge

Solar Radiation
Solar gains describe the total heat energy from the sun available
over the course of a day over an area. Increased solar gains may
be desired in winter, when shorter days and lower sun angles
naturally reduce the availability of sunlight. Shading in summer
can mitigate heat from direct sunlight.
Feel Temperature / Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI)
Outdoor thermal comfort is described by the “feels like”
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). This feel temperature is
estimated using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI),
which considers local climate parameters (air temperature, solar
radiation, humidity, and wind speed) and correlates them with
different physiological responses, from comfortable to extreme
heat/cold stress. In the Boston metropolitan area, conditions can
reach close to 100°F in the summer and fall below freezing in the
winter.

Under the current design, users would experience moderate heat along Rindge Avenue (UTCI > 80°F) approximately 10% of the time, or 36 days per year (between 8am-8pm). With the
FOJP proposal, a user is likely to experience moderate heat only 6% of the time, or 22 days per year, an equivalent of an additional 2 weeks per year with improved heat conditions. The
number of days with at least one hour of the day where moderate heat is experienced (UTCI > 80°F) will decrease from 67 days to 42 days, a decrease of more than 3 weeks annually.
The added shading along Rindge Avenue under the FOJP proposal also reduces the yearly number of days when users would experience high heat discomfort (UTCI > 90°F) by the
equivalent of 4 days, from 5.5 days (1.5% of the time) to 1.8 days (0.5% of the time). The number of days with at least one hour of the day where high heat is experienced (UTCI > 90°F)
will decrease from 14 days to 4 days, a decrease of approximately 1.5 weeks. This helps to minimize more extreme heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, that typically occur during
temperatures above 90°F.
As a tradeoff, the increased shade along Rindge Avenue will slightly increase minor cold sensation (32°F > UTCI < 50°F) during the spring and autumn seasons. This increase in minor cold
sensation is likely to occur 3% of the time annually, or an equivalent of 11 days per year, less than the 4% expected reduction in moderate heat. The periods of cool sensation occur mostly
in the morning (9am-noon) and taper off throughout the day.

summer days with at least one hour of the day where moderate heat is experienced (UTCI > 80°F) will decrease from 51 days to 36 days, a decrease of approximately 2 weeks.
The added shading along Rindge Avenue also reduces the expected time during occupiable hours with high heat discomfort (UTCI > 90°F) by 3% from an equivalent of 4.5 days in the
current design to 1.8 days under the FOJP proposal. The number of summer days with at least one hour of the day where high heat is experienced (UTCI > 90°F) will decrease from 11 days
to 4 days, a decrease of approximately 1 week. This helps to minimize more extreme heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, that typically occur during temperatures above 90°F.
As a tradeoff, the increased shade along Rindge Avenue will slightly increase minor cold sensation (32°F > UTCI < 50°F) during the spring and autumn seasons by about 7.4%, for an
equivalent of an additional 14 days of cold sensation annually. This is less than the potential benefit that the shading can provide during the summer months. The periods of cool sensation
occur mostly in the morning (9am-noon) and taper off throughout the day.

The journey in this proposed design will be comfortable for most body types
because of the overall protection provided by the landscaping throughout the
walking paths. However, near the entry of the parking lot, thermal conditions
increase because of the more exposed pathway. They will then lower slightly
during the sitting break as the pedestrian is now shaded and sheltered from the
wind and sun. Near the end of the journey, thermal conditions increase again
due to the pathway’s elevation difference with Alewife Brook Parkway which
can limit cooling air flows.

more comfortable earlier in the journey since the exposed portion of the path
comprises a smaller proportion. Most joggers along Rindge Avenue will feel

Observations
Compared to the less vegetated environment in the current proposed design, the Friends of Jerry’s
Pond proposal for increased canopy and extensive landscaping along Rindge Avenue is
expected to improve thermal conditions for various activities:
•

•

•
•

•

Annually, there will be about a 16% increase in the amount of time where the most
comfortable wind conditions will be experienced within this area; days with comfortable
wind conditions are likely to increase from 266 days to 325 days annually.
The expected number of summer days when users will experience moderate heat (universal
thermal comfort index (UTCI), or “feels like” temperature > 80°F) will be reduced by the
equivalent of 1.5 weeks each summer, from approximately 31 summer days with moderate
heat to 20 summer days.
High heat discomfort (UTCI > 90°F) is reduced from the equivalent of 5.5 days to 1.8
days in the summer months.
There is a tradeoff of reduced heat discomfort in the summer months compared to increased
minor cold sensation in the shoulder seasons: while increased shading improves heat
discomfort in the summer months, it will also lead to slightly cooler sensation in the
morning hours (9am-noon) during the spring and autumn. The benefits from the reduction in
moderate heat and high heat discomfort outweigh the negatives of the increased minor cool
sensation.
Transient thermal comfort analysis determines periods of comfortable or uncomfortable
journeys for pedestrians and users in the proposed landscaping design for various activities.
There is an improvement in the transient comfort due to the added landscaping in the FOJP
proposal, extending the usability of the space for populations across the site.

Transforming Jerry's Pond and Rindge Avenue from this...

...to this!

•
Coupling this analysis of current conditions with the projected future changes in extreme
heat due to climate change, we can anticipate that the Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal will have
even greater impact in the future as we experience higher temperatures and more extreme heat
impacts.
The Friends of Jerry's Pond proposal aligns strongly with the City's climate change goals and is a
great example of the type of public, private, and government collaboration that is needed to
advance the City's climate change goals and take meaningful action.

Presentation to NLTP Committee
December 12, 2023
Ingeborg Hegemann Comments: NLTP Meeting Dec. 13, 2023
Photo 1.
Hello, my name is Ingeborg Hegemann. I am a Professional Wetland Scientist with
many years of experience in wetland ecology and wetland creation/restoration. I
recently retired from an engineering firm and am now an adjunct professor at the
University of MA/Lowell, where I had been teaching Wetland Ecology for the past 20
years. I currently teach environmental lab and engineering ethics and practice.
My experience with the Alewife Area is long. I was on the Board of the Mystic River
Watershed Association with its founder, Herbert Meyer, when the organization was
opposed to the "Interim Access Ramp" to the MBTA garage. I was fortunate to be on
the consulting team for the restoration and redevelopment of the former ADL office park,
including the small stormwater wetland pond on the site. I have been involved in
floodplain restoration projects, including the Neponset River floodplain restoration at the
new DCR Farnham-Connolly State Park in Canton, which was contaminated by PCBs.
I have been in touch with Eric Grunebaum of Friends of Jerry’s Pond for several
months, I have walked the site and learned about their and the many community
members’ goals for the partial restoration of Jerry's Pond. When I lived in Cambridge,
the pond was partially hidden behind the old Music Complex recording studio in the
Lehigh Metals building where it appears a basement/wetland remains to this day!
The history of the pond is a reflection of North Cambridge's history: from a marshy
estuary with the Alewife Brook extending to Fresh Pond, to its industrial heyday creating
bricks and employing a large diverse population. The remaining pond, excavated from
marshy, clayey soils, is now a regulated wetland within the city's large Mystic River
floodplain.
I have a few photos I’ll present as I speak.
Photo 2.
There are opportunities to restore portions of the pond, and to create a more wildlife
friendly and ecologically diverse community. Friends of Jerry’s Pond has been fortunate
in coordinating with IQHQ to come up with information on the pond and to debate
creative ideas on restoration options. Enough data has been collected to actually have
me thinking about permitting strategies and evaluating constructability options. To me,
this is a unique opportunity for the city to help create both an ecologically diverse area
that also reflects on the city's industrial history and make the fields an educational and
local destination area, along with the proposed Audubon EcoCenter described to me by
Eric Grunebaum, which can then serve as a gateway to the Alewife Reservation.
Photo 3 and 4.
With its variable water levels reflecting seasonal conditions (drought, flooding), the pond
provides an opportunity to incorporate climate resiliency goals, including development of

emergent marsh communities, floodplain wetlands, bank restoration with plants capable
of withstanding variable water levels, and promoting flood storage capacity.
I understand there is concern that bank restoration and constructed wetlands “may not
be feasible due to unstable urban hydrology” – meaning variable water levels. However,
fluctuating water levels are expected along pond and river banks, as is flooding. This
type of fluctuation, aka, the hydroperiod, defines the type of wetlands associated with a
waterway. Ecological restoration includes an evaluation of appropriate plant species
which can thrive in exactly these variable conditions.
As I shared by my quote for the first half of this committee meeting on Sept. 27th,
“Regarding wetlands at Jerry’s Pond: Floodplain species thrive in certain conditions,
while wetland species grow in others. A study would select appropriate species and
design shoreline profiles so habitat can thrive as water level varies.”
Photo 5.
Further study could refine the ideas that have been raised to date and produce an
ecologically sustainable outcome based on site conditions, community goals, and
funding opportunities. There is a unique opportunity to improve habitat, climate
resilience and aesthetic beauty along the shoreline of Jerry’s Pond which would not be
possible if only constructed solutions such as boardwalks and decks are built on and
suspended over the pond edges.
Photo 6.
Additional restoration opportunities exist around Jerry’s Pond, which could include the
removal of old pavement around the pond and creating bank habitat by the Lehigh
Metals basement. Removal of pavement is a well-documented opportunity to implement
more sustainable conditions, allowing more and larger trees to grow around the pond,
providing greater habitat, along with additional cooling and flood resilience.
Thank you for your consideration.

Observations

Thermal Comfort

Air Pollution

The analysis, summarized below for annual changes across two future
projection periods, shows an increase in the amount of time that
pedestrians within the spaces around Jerry’s Pond will experience heat
discomfort conditions due to climate change. The added shade provided

The design by FOJP, compared to the landscape design by IQHQ,
lowers a pedestrian’s exposure to vehicular emissions and results in a
net decrease in pollutant concentrations along Rindge Avenue. The
placement of pedestrians farther away from the street plays a key
part in this reduction. Other mitigation measures that aim to improve
air quality within urban environments will have additional impact on
vehicular pollutant concentration levels as climate conditions change
in the coming decades.

INTRODUCTION
Great Accomplishments and A Final Hurdle Along Rindge Avenue
Community groups and IQHQ, the owners of Jerry’s Pond, have engaged in a fruitful collaboration over
the past two and a half years.
This work has helped refine plans for IQHQ’s 27-acre development site: a world-class laboratory
campus on the northern section of the site and a strong package of community improvements just
south of the laboratory campus around Jerry’s Pond.
This has been a historic community process—with only one substantial remaining task—to plan a
public realm waterfront and new green-space along Rindge Avenue equal in stature and vision to the
laboratory campus and other community benefits already finalized.
In many ways this is the most important task of all.
The Rindge Avenue public realm and waterfront is the critical interface with the community. It borders
on major City and regional thoroughfares, it is adjacent to a Red Line stop and important pedestrian
and bicycle commuting paths, and it lies across the street from the largest environmental justice
community in Cambridge—one of the largest such communities in Metro-Boston. What happens here
will have a lasting impact and resonance on the community for generations.
Plans proposed thus far are a substantive improvement from current conditions. They include a
boardwalk, a “multi-use” bicycle/pedestrian path, decks and other amenities generously offered by
IQHQ, which has committed to providing $2.2mm in “Rindge Avenue Related Scope.”1
Friends of Jerry’s Pond is pleased to see plans to improve the narrow public way and waterfront that
has been fenced in and largely neglected for over 62 years—however, we don’t believe these plans go
far enough to address the many important community needs along this vital city crossroads and front
yard for the approximately four thousand affordable housing residents of Rindge Avenue.
A new planning process is warranted for this vital community crossroads. The current process has
been short-circuited and will not get us there.
We respectfully offer a more comprehensive vision, in sync with Cambridge’s stated goals for equity,
climate resilience, public health, canopy expansion, ecological restoration and complete streets. And
we believe the City of Cambridge must play a leading role in this plan, which this community deserves,
for it to become a reality.
We call our vision the Rindge Avenue Community Greenway (or simply Rindge Greenway) as depicted
on the cover illustration. More than incremental improvements such as hard-scape decks and a

boardwalk, a multi-use bike/pedestrian pathway, and few trees, the Rindge Greenway offers a
transformation of the Rindge Avenue public ways and waterfront, a refashioning of its relationship to
adjoining communities as well as a beautiful new entryway into Cambridge.
Where the IQHQ plan offers modest improvements and viewing areas, the Rindge Greenway proposes
a reimagining of the Jerry’s Pond waterfront from a narrow and dysfunctional place that people avoid,
into a spacious, attractive, forested, parkland avenue akin to the edge of nearby Fresh Pond—with 150
to 175 new trees, separated bike lanes and a chance for residents to be in nature rather than observe it
from man-made structures. The benefits to climate resilience, health, ecology and equity go well
beyond what decks and approximately 12 trees planted into a steep embankment can offer and
require municipal and public participation for this most public of avenues.
New Planning Process for Rindge Ave.
In this paper we offer a beginning for that new planning process. We take a comprehensive look at this
section of Rindge Avenue—the current dysfunction, the need for City participation, environmental
justice, flooding, transportation and green infrastructure and we make the case for a new and visionary
Rindge Greenway.
We believe the future of Rindge Avenue cannot be left to a developer no matter how well intended
and collaborative they may be. New ideas and new plans need to be explored. A full partnership
between the IQHQ ownership, the City and the community is required, and the City of Cambridge
ought to be the leading steward for these public realm improvements.
To begin this process, we urge the City of Cambridge to reinstate funding for a Comprehensive
Design & Engineering Study. Our vision is for the community to achieve substantial benefits
along the south, southeast and southwest edges of Jerry’s Pond, including Rindge Avenue, the
city parking lot and bus turnaround. This study should delve into urgent topics including
environmental justice, climate resilience, complete streets, tree canopy expansion and green
infrastructure.
We look forward to continuing our work with IQHQ, the City of Cambridge, our fellow community
groups, and the broader community to develop and implement comprehensive plans for the Rindge
Avenue public realm and waterfront that are of equal stature to those for the laboratory campus and
other community benefits. The plans for the northern parts of this development site have benefited
from a strong partnership with community groups. We are confident we can do the same along Rindge
Avenue and more, with the City’s participation.
In the Appendix we provide a detailed analysis to the City’s Design Review comparing the schematics
for the Rindge Greenway and IQHQ boardwalk and deck proposals, and we respond to critiques
presented in the Review. Upfront we note that the Design Review did not address equity, climate
resilience, public health and complete streets; it narrowly focused on two schematic plans both of
which were at the earliest stages of development.

The stretch of Rindge Avenue along the Jerry’s Pond waterfront and bus turn-around is a dysfunctional
community crossroads.

Rindge Ave at Jerry’s Pond is currently a dreary and undesirable location

A chaotic narrow roadway with unmarked lanes. No room for bicycles, people or trees.

Thousands of Cambridge residents and thousands of automobiles and bicycles converge here in a
confusing and often dangerous mix of cars, buses, pedestrians, children, and bicycles all fighting for the
same small piece of real estate. The result is unpleasant. Most people avoid the area if they can.
For the ~4,000 Cambridge residents of affordable housing who live across the street in the Rindge
Communities, there is no option for avoiding these public ways—this is their front yard and a primary
way out of their homes to the T, the playing fields, DCR pool, playground or simply for a walk (or

perhaps in the future, a rest among the trees!) Behind them is a high-speed rail line, and to the sides, a
cemetery and highway embankment.
This has long been a poorly planned area of our City. Rindge Avenue is an undersized roadway with
undersized sidewalks (with almost no space for bikes or trees), filled with cars day and night, often
backed up along what has become an on-ramp to Fresh Pond Parkway, Alewife Brook Parkway and
Route 2 (with two of the state’s top five traffic periods2.) Idling cars line up, sending pollution into the
neighborhood while Rindge residents must traverse a line of traffic to get to their destinations.
Once across the street, pedestrians—mostly from Rindge communities, some from other areas coming
to use the Little League fields, Russell Field, the pool, the pathways and other attractions—are greeted
by a narrow, uninviting sidewalk hard up against a chain link fence. The sidewalk disappears
completely at the parking lot, where residents, many of them children and elderly, dodge City buses
attempting a turnaround in an inadequately sized space. Buses sometimes jump the curbs while
attempting this maneuver. While a proposed “multi-use path” may be an improvement, there is still
almost no space for trees, and no separation of bicycles, pedestrians and busses.

Pedestrians, backed-up cars and buses jammed together in a dangerous mix

At a time when so many other sections of Cambridge have been uplifted and revitalized—why has the
Rindge Avenue waterfront and Russell Field parking lot remained in such a dysfunctional state for over
62 years?

The type of dysfunction found along Rindge Avenue is all too familiar across our country. Poorer
neighborhoods have historically been concentrated in marginalized areas of cities and towns with far
fewer amenities and basic infrastructure enjoyed by wealthier neighborhoods.
These communities are often situated near industry and exposed to more pollution than wealthier
neighborhoods; they’re also hotter and have less access to the green spaces that make cities cooler
and livable.
For the ~4,000 residents of Rindge communities, this legacy is all too familiar. The Rindge Towers,
three of the largest affordable housing buildings in Metro-Boston, were very deliberately situated in an
outlying and isolated section of North Cambridge in the 1960’s amidst the remnants of manufacturing
plants and other dying industries across the tracks from the City Dump.

Cambridge City dump ca 1950’s, and other industrial areas near Rindge Ave. (now Danehy Park!)

Poor people, people of color and new immigrants were deliberately housed in such places, in a
communal act of neglect continuing to the present. Ironically the City Dump was long ago repurposed
as the award-winning Danehy Park while Rindge Ave. remains largely the same, decades later.
Redressing these historic wrongs through the lens of Environmental Justice is one of the top priorities
of the Biden administration. At his Earth Day 2022 address, President Biden stated, “We’ve put
environmental justice at the center of what we do, addressing the disproportionate health,
environmental, and economic impacts that have been borne primarily by communities of color — places
too often left behind.”3

2. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND APPROPRIATE REDRESS

Packet Pg. 120

Cambridge is well versed on the issue of Environmental Justice. Environmental Justice is listed as a top
priority by the City and Rindge communities have been recognized as the largest EJ community in
Cambridge and the only one to meet all three criteria: “Minority, Income and English Isolation.”4
Despite these national, state and local campaigns, the Rindge public ways, adjacent spaces and
waterfront remain in an unsightly and dysfunctional state. Why is this?
There are plenty of reasons and many excuses, but one thing is clear. We cannot continue to do the
same things we have done in the past and expect things to improve along Rindge Avenue. New
thinking and new actions are required. As the Cambridge Urban Forest Master Plan, “Healthy Forest –>
Healthy City” report states, “In some cases, making space for new trees will require rethinking our
street and sidewalk design…. It is critical that we design our sidewalks to support the growth of large
canopy trees.”
Friends of Jerry’s Pond has dedicated itself to Environmental Justice in the land along the Rindge
waterfront and adjacent public spaces. We continue to invite the City and community to join us in this
effort. Together we must find the resolve, creativity and funding to solve this problem once and for all.
What we do along Rindge Ave. will forever ring as perhaps our loudest statement about Environmental
Justice in the City of Cambridge. Is this something we are committed to—or only words in our policy
statements?
Recently, the City produced a flyer touting the fact that no city moneys would be contributed towards
the Jerry’s Pond waterfront revitalization plans.
This is old thinking that harkens back to an era of neglect we must extricate ourselves from. We need
new thinking and new planning.

VISIONARY PLANNING

a. CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PLAN 2009-2016:
“Environmental impacts…affect the entire Cambridge population…The environmental issues that have a greater
impact on neighborhoods with lower-income, foreign-born, or minority populations are largely the result of building
and development practices that were common at the time when the city’s dense, working-class residential
neighborhoods were developed. For instance, there tends to be less recreational open space available in
neighborhoods that have historically had higher housing densities, because little land was reserved for open space
during development, and parks have had to be developed by acquiring and converting developed land over time.”
b. “The Cambridge Life” Fall 2021:
"We will examine our open space system through an equity lens to assess priorities based on multiple criteria,
including distribution and access, park conditions, and environmental and public health benefits."

meeting with hundreds of residents including many living in the Rindge Communities—FOJP has
concluded the only way to seriously address needs along this vital crossroads is by expanding the pond
edge.

No space currently along the Jerry’s Pond Edge. Note proximity to Rindge Communities across street

The same conclusion was reached by the year-long City Envision planning process which examined the
Jerry’s Pond area in 2018:

City of Cambridge Envision Plan, 2018. Note widened pond edge, walking path & reshaped pond.

Expanding the Pond edge is a straightforward earthworks project accomplished by extending the
embankment along Rindge Ave. and reshaping other parts of Jerry’s Pond to end up with the same
amount of water and flood storage. Projects of similar scale and scope have been successfully
completed in the nearby ‘Constructed Wetlands’ in the Alewife Reservation and at Blair Pond. Indeed,

Expanded Jerry’s Pond Edge. Proposed Schematic Section View.

There are many options and uses for an expanded Jerry’s Pond edge. The Rindge Greenway is a
preliminary schematic proposal—not a final one—and it is meant to spark new ideas and visions for a
reimagining of this vital city crossroads.
We include the City owned parking lot and bus turn around in this planning process. It is a key part of
the community crossings directly abutting Jerry’s Pond. New visions and new ideas are urgently
needed for this parking lot and bus turn around as well.
A newly funded Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study with a public component should be tasked
with an exploration of the many options for an expanded Jerry’s Pond frontage and redesign of the City
parking lot, and it should include review of the options in the context of our equity, climate resilience,
complete streets, ecological restoration and public health goals.

TREE CANOPY AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE
The opportunities for improvements to the tree canopy and green infrastructure along the Jerry’s Pond
frontage are immense. The Rindge Greenway proposes a new forest of 150 to 175 trees along a newly
created pond edge that will expand community space in this area.
Compare this to the current boardwalk and deck plan to plant approximately 12 trees along a steep
embankment where they are unlikely to thrive.5 One plan offers modest improvements, where the
Greenway offers a generational opportunity to improve life for our largest EJ community with
improved tree canopy, improved health and bike/pedestrian safety and improved climate resilience in
the City.

A new forest would have significant and measurable effects on quality of life and health for all
Cambridge residents, especially for Rindge community residents living across the street. In our Urban
Forest Masterplan, the City of Cambridge describes these positive effects, especially for people
vulnerable to heat stress .6
FOJP worked with ARUP, a multinational engineering and consulting firm, to provide estimates of heat
discomfort and air pollution relief along Rindge Avenue if the Greenway plan were implemented.
Significant reductions were found in both areas.7
It’s not surprising. People feel healthier and have better health outcomes in green environments. This
is particularly true in the age of Covid, a pulmonary disease, and other emerging climate threats.
Green spaces are known to decrease stress and provide much needed escape for urban residents.
There is also an opportunity to plant another Miyawaki Forest similar to the one planted at Danehy
Park. The organizers of the Danehy Miyawaki Forest have stated they support one along Rindge Ave.

City of Cambridge Urban Forest Master Plan “Healthy Forest -> Healthy City”: “Tree canopy is not evenly
distributed: Areas of the City with more closely spaced buildings, more paved areas, less green space and fewer
trees are more likely to suffer from heat extremes. Many of these neighborhoods also have a higher-than-average
number of people most vulnerable to heat stress – those with lower incomes, minorities, the elderly, and non-native
English speakers. Planting trees cools the City: Planting more trees in neighborhoods with low canopy cover can
reduce heat stress for the people who live and work there. Existing low canopy areas tend to be the most densely
populated and more challenging to plant. In some cases, making space for new trees will require rethinking our
street and sidewalk design.// Because shade is so important to cooling our public realm — the shared spaces
where our community gathers and the corridors along which people move throughout the city — it is critical that
we design our sidewalks to support the growth of large canopy trees.”

along Rindge Ave., and to further explore the health and wellness ramifications of these plans.

HABITAT AND WETLANDS
Despite a healthy appearance at a distance, Jerry’s Pond and its pond edges are an extremely disturbed
environment. Most of the land surrounding the pond, 2-3 acres, is paved just below the surface and
the pond edges, especially those near Rindge Avenue, are nearly vertical walls excavated by previous
ownership for the rich clay deposits found in this area. There are crumbing concrete retaining walls and
large stone and concrete blocks along much of the south and west sides of the pond.

Asphalt hindering and limiting tree growth throughout lands adjacent to Jerry’s Pond

The Rindge Greenway will naturalize thousands of square feet of pond edges with new floodplain
wetland plantings and greatly improve the ecology of Jerry’s Pond. Similar to the Alewife Constructed
Wetland a half mile away, and as advised by ecological scientist Ingeborg Hegemann, the wetland
edges and species selection will be designed for variable water levels (described in the Design Review
flyer as “unstable urban hydrology.”) Habitat areas will be created that are attractive to Great Blue
Herons and other birds as well as aquatic plants, turtles, frogs and fish.
Our schematic plans have been vetted by numerous environmental experts and can continue to be
refined and we hope improved through a design and engineering study to provide optimal conditions
for the natural environment around Jerry’s Pond.

The Rindge Greenway offers an opportunity to repair the damaged natural environment around Jerry’s
Pond and de-pave acres of land that are currently covered by asphalt and concrete. The boardwalk
and deck plan leaves the pond in its disturbed state perhaps forever, and in many ways will further
degrade the pond by adding man-made structures that will shade large areas of the pond’s edges.
Mass-DEP has noted that casting the pond edges into shade may require “mitigation.”8
We are pleased that many environmental advocates strongly support our efforts to revitalize the
natural environment around Jerry’s Pond–turning a pit into a pond–and look forward to a
Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study to further flesh out the potential for environmental
improvements along Rindge Ave.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND FLOODING
The impacts of Climate Change need no introduction. These are urgent matters that require
immediate action. Cambridge has taken a strong position in its efforts to combat climate change and
in its Climate Vulnerability Assessment specifically mentions the possibility of severe flooding in this
neighborhood. The Rindge Greenway would play a vital role in mitigating these effects by directly
addressing climate impacts.
Added tree canopy, improved wetlands and de-paving will have a profound effect on heat impacts and
flooding—two of the major effects of climate change. These outcomes are at the heart of, and are the
end goals for our strong municipal efforts to reduce fossil fuels and decarbonize. Newly restored soils,
trapped under pavement for ~70 years, will have an increased ability to absorb carbon and to cleanse
contaminants from runoff and have the critical ability to absorb and hold more water during predicted
future flood events.
We look forward to a Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study that can take a deeper dive into the
urgent issues of climate change and determine how improvements along Rindge Ave. can contribute to
solutions in compliance with City objectives for Climate Resilience.

TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
An expansion of the Jerry’s Pond edge offers tremendous opportunities for improvements to
transportation infrastructure, particularly non-vehicular transportation. These improvements are in
sync with the City of Cambridge “Complete Streets” initiative9 to improve sidewalk infrastructure as
well as the “Vision Zero” initiative to eliminate pedestrian and bicycle deaths.10

users. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportation users of all ages and abilities are able to safely
move along and across a complete street…” Complete Streets have been a key component to City infrastructure
projects and have been a commitment in the City’s Five-Year Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan

Currently there is no room for bicycles along Rindge Ave. as traffic is funneled into two undersized
lanes with no room on either side for bicycles. Cars are typically backed up, in two haphazard lanes,
along this roadway during rush hours. And the boardwalk and deck proposal would force bicycles and
pedestrians into the narrowest possible multi-use path.
A widening of the Jerry’s Pond edge offers an opportunity to construct spacious and safe pedestrian
pathways as well as separated and safe pathways for bike, e-bike, scooter, and other non-vehicular
traffic along the Rindge Ave. waterfront.

Expanded Pond Edge and potential Bike Paths, Walking Paths and other Public Usage

Separated bike lanes are a significant improvement to the ten-foot wide, multi-use pedestrian/bicycle
pathway proposed in the boardwalk and deck schematic. Such a pathway does not meet Mass DOT
recommended widths of 12 to 14 feet and cannot possibly handle anticipated numbers of bikers,
scooters and pedestrians along this key community crossroads, particularly with the new development.
Separated bike paths are the best long-term solutions to creating safe passage for both bikers and
pedestrians, especially along Rindge Ave. where significant bike commuting can be anticipated after
Jerry’s Pond improvements are completed and the labs being built are filled with new employees.
New bike paths along Rindge would provide access to the regional network of commuter pathways
now taking shape in and around Rindge Ave. with connections to five major commuting pathways that
converge here.

5 Regional Bike Paths Converge at Rindge Ave

Separated bike lanes provide Rindge Ave. residents with first class access to the commuter path
network at a time when demand for non-vehicular transportation is exploding throughout Cambridge
and the Boston metropolitan area. Separated bike paths along Rindge Ave. are recommended by
Cambridge Bicycle Safety and noted on the City of Cambridge Bicycle Network Vision.
In addition, pedestrian crossings need to be widened and improved and there may be room to expand
the Rindge Avenue roadway a few feet allowing safer passage for two lanes of vehicles as the roadway
widens and enters the Parkway, potentially alleviating some of the haphazard traffic which regularly
backs up Rindge Ave. past Sherman St.
All these transportation improvements and many more need to be fully explored before plans move
forward. We look forward to further analysis of transportation options along Rindge Avenue informed
by a Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study.

RISK/REWARD ANALYSIS NEEDED
The Design Review performed by the City takes great pains to describe the Rindge Greenway plan in
terms such as, “Significant disturbance” and “Significant impacts” and the IQHQ boardwalk plan with
terms such as “Minimal disturbance” and “Minimalist approach.”
We think these characterizations are inaccurate—however we acknowledge that issues of disturbance
and cost need to be discussed by the City and Community. How much disturbance are we willing to
tolerate along Rindge to gain public benefits?
The City and community have already held this discussion for one portion of the IQHQ development
site—the 735,500 square foot laboratory/office development being constructed just north of Jerry’s
Pond. After an extensive community process, it was determined that risks and impacts of a
development slated to disturb more than 100,000 tons of contaminated soils, were outweighed by the

a

addition to the tax base of an estimated $1.1 billion, the safe capping or removal of hazardous soils and
a generous set of community benefits that included the noted work around Jerry’s Pond.
It should be mentioned that among those impacts approved for the laboratory campus was the
excavation of 1,100 cubic yards of soils from the Jerry’s Pond site as compensatory flood storage for
the excavations required by the lab development. Both leading community groups, Friends of Jerry’s
Pond and Alewife Study Group, and the Cambridge Conservation Commission approved these impacts
in order to move the project forward, to save trees and dig in an area less likely to be contaminated.

IQHQ’s commitment to excavation for water storage (orange colored kidney bean shape on lower left)

The question arises. If the community is willing to accept these impacts for a lab campus—why
wouldn’t we be willing to do the same thing to achieve substantial public benefits possible along the
Jerry’s Pond public waterfront? Friends of Jerry’s Pond believes we should be. These are much smaller
disruptions along Rindge Avenue, in areas of the site not thought to be contaminated and well worth
the rewards. These disruptions are a one-time event, and the community will benefit for generations.
In addition, work on the lab/office development has provided a blueprint for how excavations and soil
disturbance can be performed on this site in a safe manner and in full compliance with the Activity and
Use Limitation and Cambridge Asbestos Ordinance. This methodology significantly reduces risks.
Equally important—the cost of doing nothing must be factored in. Leaving the Rindge Ave. public
realm and the land around the pond in its current dysfunctional state and not improving wetlands,
flood capacity, heat and air pollution and health impacts, tree canopy, transportation or green
infrastructure leaves us with less community and ecological benefit forever.
We look forward to a robust public discussion of these risks and rewards and further analysis in a
Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study.

WORKING WITH PRIVATE OWNERSHIP
There is a current of opinion that the City of Cambridge cannot get involved in private ownership issues
such as those posed at Jerry’s Pond. This position is hinted at in the Design Review and has arisen in
public meetings.
One of the primary roles of government is to fill in gaps that cannot be addressed by private ownership
and interests and Rindge Avenue is in exactly that situation. The ownership is simply unable to address
the full range of community needs and requires assistance, support and stewardship from the City.
Nor is it their duty.
IQHQ ownership has demonstrated its willingness to provide for the needs of the community
throughout the planning process. There is reason to believe IQHQ would respond positively to joint
efforts between the City and community to improve plans along Rindge Avenue. The City’s flyer notes
there are “Possible Project Enhancements” on IQHQ’s private land which include excavation and
“remov[al] of asphalt paving” around the pond and restoration of a “degraded wetland on former
Lehigh property,” which appears to be a left-over concrete basement. This kind of collaboration
between the City and IQHQ ownership is a good model for other improvements.
A full examination of public/private partnership options should be further explored in a Comprehensive
Design & Engineering Study. The City will need to play an important stewardship role in the future of
Jerry’s Pond and participate in coordination between various stakeholders including FOJP, ASG, Mass
Audubon, DCR, DOT, MBTA, the Rindge Ave. neighborhood and wider community.

THE RIGHT PLANNING PROCESS
The IQHQ boardwalk and deck plan is a relatively quick solution that requires almost no participation
from the City. Some people have suggested that the community should accept these limited
improvements and move on. After 62 years of neglect, FOJP does not favor a quick solution—we hope
to see the best solution, and we believe it is worth waiting a bit longer if that is what it takes.
And although we unequivocally support it, we do not subscribe to the idea that a railroad crossing
behind the Rindge communities makes up for deficiencies along Rindge Ave. We think Rindge
communities deserve world-class plans in their front yard as well as in their back yard. We note that in
1994 the City studied a rail crossing and recommended it.11 By delaying this effort for almost three
decades and now swapping it for a restoration along Rindge Ave., sadly, the City would further
impoverish this neighborhood.
The community has waited more than sixty years to regain access to the Jerry’s Pond. We are happy to
wait a bit longer to make sure everything is done up to the highest standards and with careful review
through an iterative design and engineering process in view of the public.

We ask the City, owner and community to go back to the drawing board and start over on Rindge Ave.,
asking only one question: What is the best and most comprehensive plan for the Rindge Avenue
waterfront and adjacent areas and how do we make it a reality?
The City of Cambridge may feel this kind of comprehensive planning is not within its purview. If so, we
should consider working with an outside design team to bring in fresh new ideas–as the Urban Forest
Master Plan suggests: Our sidewalks and street designs “will require rethinking.” We offer our
Greenway concept plan and the City’s own Envision plan as a good starting point for this design team,
but would look forward to any new ideas that arise from such a process.
We would expect a well-run community process to take place during which time plans would be honed
and improved. And that would be the time when a continuing City Review process would be
appropriate and welcomed.
The Rindge Avenue waterfront ought to be a showcase for the very best design and community
building we are capable of. Environmental justice, climate resilience and public health demands
nothing less.
The Friends of Jerry’s Pond are dedicated to helping make that dream a reality.

CONCLUSION
The partnership between IQHQ and the community has forged first-class plans for the laboratory
campus and public commitment areas around Jerry’s Pond—but is unable to meet the design and
funding needs required along Rindge Avenue.
Meeting community needs along a major public thoroughfare across the street from the City’s largest
Environmental Justice community is simply beyond the scope of what can be expected from a private
company focused on completing their project on time and on budget.
A world-class redevelopment of the Rindge Ave. waterfront and adjacent areas, as well as removal of
impervious surfaces and afforestation of the land around the pond requires a three-way partnership
between IQHQ, the community and the City of Cambridge. This process may take a little more time.
The community has waited 62 years for Jerry’s Pond to be reopened to public access. Waiting a bit
longer to get it right, is the correct path.
We have outlined urgent community needs along Rindge Avenue, Jerry’s Pond and the adjacent lands,
including lack of space and other historic dysfunctions that have plagued this area for more than half a
century and we have noted the Environmental Justice, health and climate resilience dimensions to this
problem, increasing the urgency and raising the bar on solutions.
We have suggested ways forward that aspire to our City’s highest aspirations for Climate Resilience,
Tree Canopy, Flooding, Green Infrastructure and Transportation improvements. We have proposed an
initial conceptual plan, the Rindge Greenway, that checks all these boxes and we are open to seeing it
evolve to achieve an even better outcome if possible.

We call on the Community, City and IQHQ ownership to go back to the drawing board, together, and
sharpen our pencils. We can all do better.
To jumpstart this new process, we urge the City of Cambridge to reinstate funding for a Comprehensive
Design & Engineering Study as soon as possible. Information (including additional soil testing) obtained
in this Study will be vitally important in these efforts.
We look forward to improving Rindge Avenue plans together!

ANALYSIS of CITY OF CAMBRIDGE DESIGN REVIEW

Jerry’s Pond Improvements City of Cambridge Design Review & DPW Flyer

Introduction
The April 2023 Design Review and DPW Flyer offer strong critiques of the Friends of Jerry’s
Pond, Rindge Avenue Community Greenway Proposal.
According to statements in these two documents, the Rindge Greenway would cost too much, expose
the community to contamination risks, harm significant amounts of the tree canopy, create wetlands
with little chance of survival, damage Heron nesting sites, require thousands of truckloads of
contaminated soil be shipped through the city, and violate environmental restrictions and laws.
We find many flaws and inaccuracies in these critiques.
Before we go into great detail—it should be clarified that the Rindge Ave. Community Greenway
Proposal (hereafter called the Rindge Greenway) is not a finished plan (a “Design” ready for critiquing)
and was not at a stage to be reviewed as one. Instead, the Rindge Greenway is a concept or schematic
proposal and we expect these schematic designs to evolve with thoughtful input from stakeholders
through an open and iterative engineering and design process.

APPENDIX

Packet Pg. 135

Given that some of these preliminary plans have already changed, the information provided in the
Design Review is premature and we would prefer not to respond. However, critiques have been made
and distributed to the community, so herein is our response.

Commentary & Analysis
I. Overall Scope and Structure of Design Review
The scope and structure of the Design Review is flawed. No consideration is given to the community
context—and no assessment of community needs is provided. There is no discussion of Environmental
Justice and no mention of the fundamental community planning framework in which Jerry’s Pond
improvements fall.
There is little, and in some cases no discussion of Climate Resilience, Green Infrastructure, Ecological
Restoration, Transportation, Complete Streets, and many other issues of vital importance for any
significant planning initiative in the City. Importantly there are precious few sites in Cambridge that
equal the potential of the Jerry’s Pond waterfront for providing significant new green-space without
costly land acquisition. It’s difficult to understand why a design review for a major project, conducted
in 2023, at public expense would not include these considerations.
The Design Review is also flawed in its scope. Jerry’s Pond improvements are an integral part of an
overall development plan for the entire 27-acre former W. R. Grace site—and yet there is no mention
of this other work. Analysis is confined exclusively to the Jerry’s Pond improvements without
consideration of one of the largest active construction sites in Cambridge just a few yards north, with
dozens of trucks coming and going on a daily basis.
This lack of context is a substantive flaw particularly for analysis of site impacts.

II. Contaminated Wastes
The Design Review lists the “Disturbance of Potentially Contaminated Soils” as “Minimal” on
the IQHQ boardwalk plan and “Significant” for the FOJP plan12. The usage of the word
‘contaminated’ is a fraught word. These soils may not have any contamination at all—or may
have typical contaminants found on urban fill soils throughout the City as the Haley & Aldrich
LSP conjectured.13 The Design Review itself concurs with this assessment: “The limited soil data
suggests that contamination, common in historic fill material, is present in this area”14. And yet
the words “potentially contaminated soils” appear on the public-facing flyer without
explanation.
12

Design Review, p.3.
150 years of photos and maps FOJP has collected, along with testing in the 1980s and in 2021 which are aligned with this,
despite many decades of concerns that results would be otherwise. The Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission
called the “gross pollution” of Jerry’s Pond “urban legend”, ascribing it to “the actual pollution discovered nearby during
construction of the Red Line Extension combined with W.R. Grace’s terrible environmental reputation.”

These words, without contextualization, create undue anxiety in the public and do not reflect the
reality of the situation.
Regarding contamination, FOJP has unequivocally asked for more testing as part of the Comprehensive
Design & Engineering Study and proposes nothing less than strict adherence to the AUL and Asbestos
Ordinance as IQHQ is doing steps away at the development site. The retraction of study funding in
April 2022 has delayed efforts to further characterize soils in areas that would be excavated for the
Rindge Greenway—and also for IQHQ’s co-located and required storm water storage area as well as for
the City’s proposed “Possible Project Enhancements” including de-paving and restoration of the Lehigh
site.
Until soil tests are performed, it would be more accurate to characterize soils as having insufficient
testing, but that there is no history of industrial usage as LSP, Haley & Aldrich described the site and as
maps and photos of the site from 1870s to the present demonstrate. And this is consistent with recent
sediment testing for IQHQ in the adjacent areas of the pond.

III. Trucking of Contaminated Wastes
The Design Review makes the alarming claim the Rindge Greenway will require “2,220 truckloads” of
“potentially contaminated soil” to be trucked off site. We believe these words are constructed to
create anxiety in the public. Without further explanation, readers of the DPW flyer would imagine that
thousands of truckloads of highly contaminated soils will be trucked through their neighborhood. We
have already addressed the question of contamination.
The Design Review appears to have based its numbers on smaller trucks and estimated that half the
excavated soils would need to be trucked off site. We believe these assumptions are premature and
should occur after testing, design and engineering, rather than before.

There is a possibility excavated soils may test clean. Second, the soils may test slightly contaminated
and be available to be used as fill along Rindge Ave.15 Thirdly, soils could be formed into berms,
capped with clean fill, and left around the perimeter of the newly shaped pond. Capping is currently
being used on the lab/office construction site where tens of thousands of tons of highly contaminated
soils are being capped with clean fill and left onsite.
There is no reason to create anxiety in the public mind regarding the final disposition or condition of
excavated soils required for the Rindge Greenway prior to a study. In the event contaminated soils do
need to be trucked offsite, these truckloads are likely to be significantly less than those estimated by
the Design Review and will never be traveling through Cambridge neighborhoods. There is direct
access onto Alewife Brook Parkway, Route 16 and Route 2 from an existing curb cut at the southwest
corner of the Jerry’s Pond site. Trucks can exit directly onto highways and out of the city.

Design Review p.38: “In accordance with MassDEP policy, soil would not be able to be reused on site unless it
contains similar OHM and asbestos concentrations as the re-use area or was determined to be clean. Additional
soil assessment is required in both the western and southern areas of jerry’s Pond to determine if soil re-use is
possible.”

In addition to generating unnecessary fears of trucks and contamination, the Design Review neglects to
put the construction work required for the Rindge Greenway into context. No mention is made of
construction work at the lab/office construction site just yards away. The soil excavations and trucking
of contaminated soils currently happening at this site, are orders of magnitude larger than those
proposed for the Rindge Greenway and are being safely managed without endangering the public.
The lab/office project estimates they will be trucking between 100,000 to 130,000 tons of potentially
hazardous and contaminated soil offsite by the completion of the project.16

Photo of soil pile at Whittemore Ave. construction site.

The city has raised no alarms regarding this significant trucking of contaminated soils, nor has it printed
a flyer for public distribution related to this project site. Why is there suddenly an alarm being raised
for Rindge Greenway excavations?
Trucking of soils, even highly contaminated soils, is performed safely all the time and under careful
monitoring, all over Massachusetts and indeed, IQHQ is obligated to excavate “potentially
contaminated” soils to create a storm water storage facility in the same area proposed for the Rindge
Greenway’s compensatory wetlands. Further, the DPW flyer suggests the City of Cambridge itself is
considering “Possible Project Enhancements” including excavation by removing asphalt and concrete in
areas that include the former Lehigh Metals site. All this work would require testing and excavation of
potentially contaminated soil and possible disposal offsite. It appears inconsistent for the City to raise
an alarm for trucking of contaminated wastes and then propose the same for its own Project
Enhancements.
We presume Cambridge and/or IQHQ would be able to accomplish this excavation and disposal as
safely as is being done on the lab/office site now and in a similar fashion as proposed for the Rindge
Greenway.

IV. Excavation and Impact
The Design Review describes the Rindge Greenway plan as a “major earthworks” project excavating
thousands of truckloads of soil while the boardwalk plan is portrayed as a minor project
involving “minimal soil disturbance” and “low-impact” to the environment and neighborhood. This is
misleading.
The Design Review notes over 1,100 cubic yards of excavation will be required for the compensatory
storage area which IQHQ is required to construct. This disturbance is on essentially the same footprint
as would be for soils excavated in the proposed Rindge Greenway compensatory wetlands.
Given the two excavations are occurring on nearly identical footprints and both with heavy machinery,
the impacts attributed to the Rindge Greenway and boardwalk plans are closer in scale than as
characterized, particularly as compared with the lab development. They are both “major earthwork”
projects.
The boardwalk and deck project is also a “major construction” project involving the engineering and
construction of hard-scape structures along Rindge Ave. overhanging the pond edges. There is a
significant likelihood that to support the multi-use path and tree plantings in the boardwalk plan, bank
stabilization17 and/or retaining walls will be required along an embankment that is nearly vertical.
Heavy equipment will be required for pile-driving and other structural work.
There are many environmental risks associated with this type of construction. For example, piles and
boardwalk structures may contain materials impregnated with highly toxic chemicals to prevent rot
and decay. These chemicals can leach into the environment. There are also significant environmental
issues created by the shading of large portions of the shoreline.18
There are no low-impact options currently on the table. Both plans require soil disturbance (though at
a fraction of the lab development site), and the boardwalk and deck plan will also require major hardscape construction. The Design Review makes no mention of this wider context.
In a significant sense, the Rindge Greenway plan will require less disruption than other improvements
to the 27-acre IQHQ development site (planned or currently underway). It is primarily an earthworks
project requiring only pathways and seating. No toxic materials will be used. And the natural
environment will be improved through ecological restoration.

V. Environmental Impacts
17

Arup engineering: “Trees planted along a steep embankment will require embankment stabilization and complex
maintenance procedures.”
18
Boardwalks and bank stabilization may require compensatory wetlands themselves; MassDEP noted in their ENF
reply on Dec. 21, 2021 to the MA Executive Office of Energy & Environmental Affairs, that “shading impacts to
Bank and Land Under Water are likely to be deemed alterations and should be evaluated in the NOI. Mitigation
may be required.”

a

26
Packet Pg. 140

The design review states that the boardwalk plans, “will limit ecological and environmental
disturbance”19 with the implication that Rindge Greenway plans will not do so. This is misleading.
The Jerry’s Pond site is one of the most ecologically disturbed ‘green’ areas in the City, with paved
areas below most of the soils—approximately 2-3 acres are paved around the pond—a nearly vertical
embankment along Rindge Avenue artificially created by brick companies which dug the pond out for
its clays along with crumbling retaining walls, concrete and stone debris along much of the pond’s
edges.

Debris and crumbling concrete edges of Jerry’s Pond

A key aspect of the Rindge Greenway is to establish new and improved green infrastructure that has
long been absent since its prior life as a part of The Great Swamp. By retaining the pond’s paved,
degraded land and pond banks as it is today, the boardwalk and deck plan preserves current ecological
and environmental disturbance in perpetuity and adds new disturbances in the form of man-made
structures that will deprive large portions of the pond edges and earth around the pond of sunlight,
ventilation and recovery. To suggest that locking in permanent site degradation causes less ecological
disturbance than short-term earthwork, asphalt and concrete removal to accomplish long-term
restoration has it exactly backwards.
Where FOJP proposes ecological restoration, the boardwalk and deck plan proposes hard-scape, and
keeping the pond in a perpetually degraded state.
The City of Cambridge has expressed support for small-scale initiatives to improve habitats and urban
ecology as at the Miyawaki forests and notes the benefits at one such project at Flagstaff Park.20

19

Design Review, p.6.
In describing improvements to Flagstaff Park, Cambridge acknowledges an interest in “allow[ing] more open areas of the
City to be more natural” and that “Adding natural areas to our parks and streetscapes will encourage a greater diversity of
plant and insect species. Flowering plants and native grasses are needed to create the habitat required by pollinating
insects. A healthy urban ecology will support food sources for birds, bats, moths, flies, and native and non-native bees.”

One of the keystones of the Rindge Greenway plan is of course to have significant impacts on Jerry’s
Pond; positive impacts—removing acres of pavement, foundations, retaining walls and blacktop and
creating new and better habitats that have not existed here since the Alewife wetlands were drained.
Ecological restoration requires disturbance in the short term to create long-term ecosystem and
biodiversity improvements, along with benefits to people in cooling, better air quality, flood relief and
the social, emotional and physical health improvements which time spent in nature provide.

VI. Tree Canopy
The Design Review makes significant efforts to portray the Rindge Greenway concept plan as
destructive to trees and in violation of City tree ordinances. The topic is listed at the top of the
summary page, then explored in detail early in the Design Review. Potential lost trees are
painstakingly itemized along with penalties owed for violations of the City tree ordinance21.
These detailed efforts are premature since as noted above, there is no fixed design for the Greenway
yet—and the conclusions challenge common sense.
The boundaries of the compensatory wetlands shown on the Rindge Greenway concept plans are an
initial and arbitrary shape and can easily be moved so that many fewer trees are lost. Below is one
potential re-shaping to significantly reduce the number of trees removed:

Packet Pg. 142

The design review notes that about a third of the trees slated for removal in the Rindge Greenway plan
are “invasives” and eleven of them are “considered in poor health due to vine strangling” and “2 of
these trees are listed as dead.”22 This may further reduce the number of trees lost.
With appropriate adjustments, the number of mature trees that need to be removed for the Rindge
Greenway’s expanded wetlands can be reduced to a number perhaps 25 more than those required to
be removed in the IQHQ storm water plan and many of those trees slated for removal are likely to be
invasives, in poor health or possibly dead. The ultimate plan can and should be designed around
preservation of the healthiest and highest quality, non-invasive trees through an iterative process
rather than treating a schematic shape as a design.
FOJP sees every tree as important, however the larger picture must be maintained. The chance to
plant 150-175 new trees in public areas that will be frequented by the adjacent communities along
Rindge is of much greater human value than the loss of 25 trees, possibly invasive or in ill health, at
inaccessible locations of the site. In addition, the de-paving proposed in the Rindge Greenway around
the new wetlands will allow many more larger trees to grow throughout the site adding significantly to
the tree canopy, more than making up for any trees lost. Full de-paving of the site is of course
desirable for many reasons, as the Design Review notes, but has not been the primary focus of our
proposal.
In contrast, the boardwalk and deck plan proposes approximately 12 trees planted in a nearly vertical
embankment that will likely require structural support.23 In contrast, the Greenway proposes an order
of magnitude more trees, planted in a new park, in the portion of the site most heavily traveled by the
Rindge community, neighbors and visitors.
Given the size and quality of the Rindge Greenway’s proposed new tree canopy and public location, its
value to the urban environment and benefits provided for people, there is little doubt that the Rindge
Greenway proposal is a stronger option for improving health, heat, air quality and flood relief by
providing new green infrastructure along Rindge Ave.

The discussion of negative impacts to Great Blue Heron nests is given high visibility in the Design
Review and flyer24. The point is made (and backed up with a photograph) that Great Blue Herons are
currently nesting at Jerry’s Pond—and that the Rindge Greenway would harm these nesting habitats.
This suggests a lack of careful study. There are currently no Great Blue Herons nesting at Jerry’s Pond
and there have been no nests there since spring of 2020. There have been winter colonies resting at
Jerry’s Pond, but no nesting for three seasons. We shared the photo with an expert in bird
conservation at Manomet, a 54-year-old conservation organization located in Massachusetts, and he
stated after reviewing the photo that this was a winter resting area rather than a nesting area.

Design Review, p.11.
Arup engineering notes that “Trees planted along steep embankment will require embankment stabilization and
complex maintenance procedures” and several landscape architects we have consulted with have stated that trees
planted in these conditions will not thrive.

We are told by experts in this field that Great Blue Herons come and go from nesting areas and that
habitat created by the Rindge Greenway will be very attractive to nesting Herons and other birds since
it will provide more sources of food; aquatic plants which support macro-invertebrates at the base of
the food chain which in turn supports fish, reptiles, amphibians and birds.
It’s unfortunate that what appear to be inaccurate field observations are included in the Design
Review.
We look forward to further investigation of options for attracting Great Blue Heron nesting activities
along with other wildlife in a Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study.

VIII. Wetland Restoration and Habitat
Regarding wetlands, the Design Review expresses doubts that improved habitats and wetland
shorelines proposed in the Rindge Greenway, can be established.25 26 The flyer states that
“constructed wetlands…and bank restoration…may not be feasible due to unstable urban hydrology.”27
This appears to be essentially a semantic and design difference. Less than a half mile away in the very
same watershed, with similarly varying water levels, the beautiful Alewife Constructed Wetlands have
been built and currently thrive with a new ecosystem of wetland plants, birds, and animals.

Alewife Constructed Wetland. This area shows low and variable water levels yet a thriving floodplain wetland.

25

Design Review, p4, “the long-term establishment of a healthy and functioning aquatic shoreline will be difficult to
ensure based on an unstable and highly fluctuating urban pond that is underlain by clay and has small
subwatershed and no controlled outlet. Greater fluctuations in water levels caused by predicted future increases in
the frequency and intensity of rainfall events will also have a negative effect on long-term aquatic plant
establishment…”
26
Design Review, p15, “Habitat creation projects are difficult to guarantee and overall quality does not always
meet the value of diverse, healthy plant communities; habitat creation also requires long-term monitoring and
management to control invasive species from becoming dominant”
27
By “unstable hydrology” we understand that the Design Review is referring to varying water levels.

Packet Pg. 144

Ecological scientists have questioned the conclusions of the Design Review and believe that species of
plants could be selected to survive and thrive in the conditions at Jerry’s Pond.28 The wetland expert
we consulted, Ingeborg Hegemann, who has worked in the Alewife area previously, suggested that the
shoreline profile and selection of species should be designed to create a “floodplain wetland” rather
than an “emergent wetland” as our initial schematic and proposal suggested. The design of the
shoreline and plantings should be intentional in support of an appropriate wetland rather than
critiqued on the basis of a schematic design.
FOJP has had the Rindge Greenway conceptual plans vetted by numerous environmental organizations,
all of whom have stated in varying ways that the restoration of wetlands on the banks of Jerry’s Pond
will provide new and improved habitats for birds and animals as compared with the boardwalk and
deck hard-scape design—a plan that would leave degraded, and crumbling concrete, stone and nearly
vertical pond banks that are permanently cast into shade.

IX. Project Costs and Appropriate Expenditures
The Design Review suggests that costs for the Rindge Greenway will be $19.7-23 Million. We believe
this to be an inflated range and actual costs may be about one half that amount. We also believe there
is significant state and federal funding available to reduce costs.
Using the Design Review’s figure of $19,721,771 for total costs assumes no more than 50% of soils can
be reused on site. We have provided scenarios where all soils remain on site, however, to be
conservative, we accept this estimate. We suggest the following adjustments to the top-line:
•

•

•

Subtract the $5M line item for burying overhead utility lines. We have not included this work in
our planning and sent a letter to the DPW on this topic in September 2021.29 The utility poles
are shown in our schematic section which was included in Appendix-D of the Design Review (p.
374).
Subtract the $2.2M IQHQ has allocated for commitments to Rindge Ave. related scope. We
believe that IQHQ would honor this commitment and contribute those moneys towards
improvements along Rindge Ave. also funded by the City (see letter to DPW dated Sept 7,
2021).30
Subtract a significant portion of the $772,600 City penalties for removing trees as many fewer
these trees are likely to be removed in a reworked excavation plan as described above. Further,
many are in poor health and some are already dead.

28

Ingeborg Hegemann, an ecological scientist with deep wetland expertise who has consulted in Alewife, visited
rd
Jerry’s Pond on May 3 , 2023 and noted that floodplain plants will work here, as they do at the nearby Alewife
Constructed Wetland. She noted that this is “essentially a semantic difference; floodplain species will thrive in
certain conditions, while wetland species grow in other conditions and pond banks can be designed accordingly. An
iterative design process and feasibility study would select appropriate species and design the shoreline profile
so the habitat can thrive as water level varies, similar to the conditions at the Alewife Constructed Wetland.”

This leaves $11,749,171 as the estimated costs (with half of excavated soils trucked offsite). This
number can potentially be further reduced. For example, the work IQHQ is budgeting for the
construction of their flood storage swale would be subsumed into a larger earthworks project and
some portion of that may be credited towards overall costs. However, we accept the number of $12M
as a reasonable preliminary estimate prior to a comprehensive Design & Engineering Study.
The question may then be asked, is it worth $12M of Cambridge funding to construct a world class
transformation of the Rindge Ave. waterfront and adjacent land such as that envisioned by the Rindge
Greenway? We think a thoughtful review of recent expenditures in the City justifies this cost.
The city has recently allocated substantial sums towards water storage in gray infrastructure
projects in several locations around the City—12 so far including at the Tobin School, Parking Lot 6,
Port area. Our understanding is that these come at a cost of about $25M each31. These concrete
cisterns for water storage are necessary for flood prevention, but offer no co-benefits to people in
shade, heat relief, and other positive impacts of green infrastructure on health, relief from stress and
biodiversity. At a cost of approximately half of one cistern, the Rindge Greenway would provide
substantial flood storage benefits as well as multiple community benefits outlined in this paper.
A Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study can examine in more detail, the costs and benefits of the
Rindge Greenway in comparison to other infrastructure improvements in Cambridge to help the City
and community decide whether funding is appropriate and investigate sources of state and federal
funding (particularly for environmental justice, climate resilience, ecological restoration and/or
complete streets projects).

X. Activity and Use Limitation (AUL)
The Design Review asserts the Rindge Greenway Plan is not consistent with the AUL. This would
appear to be an overly narrow interpretation given the large amount of soil disturbance which IQHQ is
undertaking currently just north of Jerry’s Pond in the development site. All activities required during
construction and use of the Rindge Greenway would appear to be exactly those currently being
performed on the IQHQ lab construction site north of Jerry’s Pond and similar to those required during
construction of IQHQ’s compensatory storage swale along Jerry’s Pond in the same location as the
proposed Rindge Greenway’s compensatory wetland.
North of Jerry’s Pond at the development site, soils are being excavated, removed when contaminated
and covered with clean fill, exactly as proposed for the construction of the Rindge Greenway. We note
however that areas north of Jerry’s Pond are known to be highly contaminated, while those on the
south side of Jerry’s Pond have a different history suggesting far lower, or no hazardous contamination
as the Design Review itself notes.

XI. Support of the Property Owner

gallon stormwater holding system…”

32
Packet Pg. 146

The design review asserts the Rindge Greenway Plan is “not supported by the property owner” and
cites private ownership as a reason the City cannot get involved in the project.
The IQHQ ownership has publicly stated they might support the Rindge Greenway proposal if funding
and public support were available—and said they would consider delaying work on the Rindge Ave.
commitment area until the issue was resolved. It’s self-fulfilling for the City to retract funding allocated
15 months ago and then suggest that IQHQ does not support the Rindge Greenway proposal because
there is no funding for it!
With regards to City involvement on private land, the City has proposed “Possible Project
Enhancements” in the Design Review flyer which are described as including excavation and “remov[al]
of asphalt paving” on the west side of the pond and restoration of the “degraded wetland on former
Lehigh property”—which appears to be a basement—on the northwest side of the pond.
These significant earthwork projects indicate the City is willing and able to work with IQHQ to excavate
these paved and highly degraded areas on privately owned land on the west side of the pond.

XII. Review Process
The Design Review states, “The IQHQ plan has been refined by multiple rounds of feedback from the
public, local stakeholders and the City.” This is inaccurate—essentially one plan was presented and has
had minimal revisions. FOJP stated its opposition immediately and has been granted time to seek
funding and support for a more comprehensive plan.
We look forward to a Comprehensive Design & Engineering Study and iterative design process between
the community, local organizations, IQHQ and City of Cambridge to fully vet a new and better plan for
Rindge Ave.

XIII. Miscellaneous Inaccuracies in Design Review
1. Design Review (p.13) states that Rindge Greenway requires removal of the 7 volunteer trees
along Rindge Ave. Experts including Ingeborg Hegemann, have stated that these trees need not
be removed and FOJP has not called for their removal.
2. Design Review (p5) states that the “The construction of three new paths (sidewalk, bicycle, and
nature trail) along Rindge Avenue increases impervious surfaces and runoff into Jerry’s Pond.”
This is inaccurate. FOJP suggests a sidewalk of 6’ in width (as we understand it, required to be
impervious) and we propose a pervious nature path and a pervious off-street bicycle path (in
consultation with Cambridge Bicycle Safety and as used on Western Ave.) The boardwalk and
deck proposal suggests a 10’ wide multi-use path of indeterminate nature, but likely impervious
given its use as a sidewalk. In the current schematic phase, the FOJP proposal appears to have
4’ less impervious material than the boardwalk and deck proposal.
