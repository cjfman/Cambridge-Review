and a quorum was present, and the hearing was clearly audible to all participants.
Councillor Nolan read prepared written Opening Remarks (ATTACHMENT A).
Iram Farooq introduced the CDD team who led the Envision Cambridge process. She stated that the team
has been central to the Alewife planning process but also working with the Ordinance Committee and
City Council on implementation and looking at evaluating zoning that has come forward subsequently
that was impacting a large section of the quadrangle area which is the area with perhaps the largest
amount of remaining development potential in this district.
Melissa Peters gave an overview of a PowerPoint presentation (ATTACHMENT B) of the Alewife
District Plan including background and process and existing conditions to set the foundation for the plan’s
vision and recommendations.
Noah Sawyer, Just-A-Start, stated that first as a developer and implementer, they are applying the
recommendations of Envision Alewife to two sites: Rindge Commons and 52 New Street. He stated that
the plan has been great to work with and provides a great template to consider as they develop sitespecific approaches it gives good guidance to help add units and affordable housing to this district. He
said that the Envision Alewife study area does not include some of the land that Just-A-Start owns. He
appreciates the outreach to the Fresh Pond Towers and 402 Rindge Avenue as part of the planning
process but they were not included in the Alewife study. He recommended that we as we think about
Alewife holistically, it is important to find ways to engage more closely with those residents in those
communities. He said that Just-A-Start owns and manages and is a steward to the 402 Rindge community.
He said that when talking with their managers and site team, one thing that was consistent from everyone
who lives and works with the community at 402 Rindge Avenue is that residents rely on pedestrian and
bicycle access. He said that anything that improves safe, pedestrian access would be helpful. He said that
one of the things that the residents value is the privacy and security that comes from being in the towers.
He said that if there is discussion about trying to split up these sites or think about ways to add
accessibility through them, it is important that it balance the concern about safety and privacy with the
concerns about access. He said those two pieces really do go together. He said that they appreciate the big
thinking around connecting the north side of the tracks with the rest of the Alewife area. In regards to
creative options, he suggested creative thinking about how the existing resources may be better used. He
said that the existing bridge and overpass is not especially inviting to the residents. He said that the
current plan with the DCR is that biking occurs in Alewife Brook Parkway and he feels that many would
not choose not to do. He spoke about the pedestrian ramp and access that exists on DCR land next to 402
Rindge Avenue that is poorly designed and underutilized. He said that making the best use of the existing
infrastructure would make huge steps forward in connectivity and accessibility.
Mike Nakagawa gave an overview of a PowerPoint presentation (ATTACHMENT C) regarding the
current conditions and connectivity problems in the Alewife area along with demographics regarding
population, housing units and jobs by census block

Doug Brown encouraged the City and the City Council to pursue a document, plan and set of urban
design guidelines that go with it and update the zoning. He said that was always assumed to be part of the
working group’s effort. He encouraged the City Council to pursue holistic zoning for this area. He said
that this area is facing an onslaught of individual zoning proposals by individual owners and developers.
He encouraged all to look for the easy wins, such as in areas of connectivity. He said that historically,
there was an underpass that was used by the brickyard. He stated that it is important to think about how
the City wants to use the Route 2 bridge which is proposed to be redeveloped and rebuilt in 2025. He said
that another easy win is around Terminal Road and how it can enable connectivity on the other side of the
tracks in the same way as an underpass would on the north side. He said that we need to think about
rebuilding Smith Place in the same way that New Street was built. He said that behind Whole Foods, the
City already owns the railroad Right of Way and the City has set aside money via the CPA to design a
path there. He asked for completion of this design. He talked about a rail stop and he said that is not
beyond us to come up with a solution to crack that issue. Mr. Brown pointed out that the City owns a
number of easements, right of ways and pieces of land throughout this district and we have negotiated
$1.7 million dollars in contributions from developers for the design of a bridge. He asked what is being
done with that money.
Councillor Nolan said that by focusing on the zoning and public spaces, the City cannot control totally
what a developer will build but the City can control the zoning throughout the area and make decisions
around the public spaces and connectivity.
Councillor Nolan opened the hearing to Public Comment.
Ann Steward, 31, Wheeler Street, read from a prepared written statement (ATTACHMENT D) regarding
the need for an Implementation Plan and zoning guidelines and proposed three infrastructure
improvements.
James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that he is tired of being ignored. He said that he initiated
the process for a Tenant Council. He said that he has put a tremendous amount of time and effort in
advocating for things that are important and matter. He said that regarding transit, the only bus that
services this area is the 83 bus. He said that it cannot make it around the rotary next to the baseball field.
He said that somebody decided to put fake boulders in the rotary. He said that is not a solution to the
problem. He said that another issue is that the bus goes over the raised sidewalk and on the Rindge
Avenue side there is a divot. He said that bus is nearly tipping over. He said that he has advocated for
restoring the duration of the opening of the DCR owned and managed pool.
John Chun, 48 Loomis Street, stated that he did submit written comment to the City Council and City
Clerk for consideration (ATTACHMENT E). He said that there are very good elements that he would
like to see be enforced by zoning and the City. He said that one example is a recent development proposal
by Cabot, Cabot & Forbes to build lab buildings along Mooney Street. He said that they picked up some
elements of the Alewife District Plan but cherrypicked what would give them advantage while hiding
things they did not want to share. He said that clear guidance on the strategic development of the area, the
plans need to be made into zoning.
Lee Farris asked City Councillors to ask CDD staff why the City has not prepared zoning for Alewife.
She asked if there have been impediments to doing so. She said that it would be good if there was a list
and map of all current development proposals so that they could be compared with Envision. She strongly
agrees that we need actual zoning because otherwise developers will pick and choose which elements of
Envision they want to follow. She said that it looks like we will be getting $25 million back from the
MBTA for the Green Line. She asked if this money could be used to build a bridge at Alewife that we
want.

Vice Mayor Mallon made a motion to close Public Comment.
The roll was called and resulted as follows:

and Public Comment was closed.
Councillor Carlone stated that in the mapping that the CC& F site had two different codes, one purple and
one yellow. He asked which it is – or is it both? Melissa Peters responded that the map she showed was a
land use map that showed the predominant or likely or desirable land use for that area. It shows that the
northwest part of the quad would allow residential near the highlands which was preferential from the
community perspective. Councillor Carlone stated that regarding mode share, Ms. Peters stated less than
40%. He asked 40% of what? Ms. Peters stated 40% car trips from developments. Councillor Carlone said
that this has to be highly reviewed by Planning Board and staff on each project. Councillor Carlone said
that he knows why the City Manager’s administration wants a high percentage of commercial
development but he feels that you will find that a vast majority want residential development. He said that
this will be a big issue for the rest of his lifetime in Cambridge. He said that regarding connections, he
agrees that they are critical. He asked how a very large block will be prioritized when only a portion of
the block is being developed at one time. He asked how that will be done. He said that if we don’t look at
property lines and don’t show where it should be, you will never have the two connecting. He asked how
this will be done if only part of a block is being developed at a time. Ms. Farooq said that she agrees that
the ultimate urban fabric that we want to see in the area is not one that appears like superblocks. She said
that one of priorities that emerged through this process was a desire to see light industrial in this area. She
said that this would help with economic empowerment and help provide good jobs that have low barrier
to entry. Ms. Farooq said that from a planning perspective, we would not want blocks to be superblocks.
She said that regarding how to make that happen if only part of the block is being developed, none of
those intermediate block connections are prescriptive that they must be in an exact place but they would
want to see this happen. She said that on the eastern part of the quadrangle in the past, even it is a smaller
building or part of a block that is being developed, they have, through the Special Permit process, asked
developers to build in connections or retain space for connections. This happened on Fawcett and New
Street. She added that the existing zoning creates an incentive to make that happen. There is bonus GFA
that a developer would get if they build in desired connections as referenced in the plan. That means that
there is an incentive for developers to do what the plan asks them to do and it is easier for the Planning
Board then to require that through the Special Permit conditions.
As it relates to open space, Councillor Carlone stated that he feels that the plan is very deficient. He said
that he has heard from two commercial land owners that the City proposed open space is for sale and has
been for over two months. He said that the City has not moved on this. He asked how can we be confident
that that that purchase is going to happen. He said that the whole project is based on that spine working as
an urban design element. He said that we know that the city is less than ½ of the average city. He said that
this neighborhood community will be less than half of that, about 1/3 of what an average city is. He asked
when we are going to move on this. He said that we do not have an implementation process going on that
counts. He said that what is proposed is absolutely not sufficient and Fresh Pond is not going to balance it
given that it is primarily pedestrians walking the length. He said that it is absolutely key. Councillor
Carlone talked about access. He said that this is miserable from a car point of view and with 40% being

car oriented, he does not believe that it can work. He said that he would love to see a traffic study that
says that it will. He added that the bridge at the future commuter station will not happen until there is a
commuter station. Councillor Carlone said that you have to test the zoning before you do the zoning.
Mr. Nakagawa stated that regarding the residential area in the northwest corner of the quad, it is an
isolated place that takes away from the industrial use. He said that it was not part of the original
discussions and just showed up initially the day CC& F presented at the Planning Board. He said that we
should not shortchange light industrial and use the definition that is in the plan. He said that there have
been 4,000 new units of housing developed in the area or permitted who have come on board since 2010.
Councillor McGovern stated that he agrees with the need for the rail station. He said that there will be a
need for multiple bridges. He said that all things being equal, we would love it if someone else paid for
these bridges. He said that the City should pay for it if we want it. He said that we need to step up on this
issue as soon as possible. He said that in terms of zoning changes and clarification of zoning, he cautioned
that whatever zoning that is passed, it will not do away with individual petitions being filed. He said that
developers will always try to improve their situation. He said that he is pleased to see the focus on light
industrial. He said that he would like to see some sort of Station Landing model as we are building more
residential housing. He asked if there have been discussions with Economic Development to attract
businesses to this location. Ms. Farooq said that the Economic Development team was a big part of
working on this plan. She said that light industrial, while challenging, with enough critical mass, would
be able to draw folks. She said that the neighborhood serving retail is a lot more challenging. She said that
is why the plan talks about aligning that along the main streets than further in the back. She said that it
has been said that retail is the most delicate flower in the garden and it is true. She said that retail will
always follow the population and it needs people to support it. She explained that the margins are very
narrow. She explained that they have to think through where it is most likely for it to be successful.
Councillor McGovern asked if there is any talk around City functions such as a fire station, library,
schools. He said that a fire station is vital in his opinion. Melissa Peters responded that they did not
preclude the siting of public facilities but they also did not identify locations for them. She said that
certainly if there is a need for a public facility, that is an opportunity for a city investment and they would
defer to the City Council and the City Manager. Councillor McGovern said that the City needs to
accumulate property if it is available so that we have control over what goes at that location. Lastly,
Councillor McGovern asked what are the next steps? Ms. Farooq responded that this conversation is
helpful because in prior conversations, CDD has not felt a clear sense of whether it has the City Council’s
endorsement on this plan. She said that zoning is hard because it is so detailed. She said that in some
ways the easiest part is to write the zoning and the harder part is knowing what you are trying to make
happened through the zoning. She said that CDD would want the blessing of the City Council before they
embark on the large task like translating the plan into zoning. She said that CDD is ready but they want to
know if it is a priority for the City Council because it will take up a lot of the Zoning and Development
staff time in terms of what they are able to focus on in terms of the zoning tasks that the City Council
would like them to focus on. Councillor McGovern said that the City Council cannot begin to discuss the
zoning until CDD writes it. He said that there is a great starting point. He said that CDD has a lot on its
plate and if help is needed, please ask for it.
Councillor Nolan looked to CDD for guidance in how to move forward. Ms. Farooq stated that it would
be helpful to know that the City Council feels that this is a good starting point because it will take a lot of
work. She said that if the City Council feels that some basic concept doesn’t make sense, it would be
good to know before the team spends weeks putting together the zoning.

Councillor Zondervan stated that while he feels that the plan is well-intentioned and he likes the idea that
we would have light industrial at this location, he does not understand how to make these things happen.
He asked how to do we get what we want. He said that the pull that we have that we are refusing to use is
that the City build these things. He said that doesn’t seem to be an option. He said that he is frustrated. He
said that he does not understand how zoning would lead to the outcome that is desired. Ms. Farooq stated
that zoning is not an ideal tool to develop infrastructure. She said that we have found a way to make it
happen but it is a slow tool. She said that it takes time to manifest itself. She said that in terms of the land
uses, that is something that zoning can influence more strongly. She said that when framing the zoning
they are always trying to tilt the incentives in such a way that they are in favor of the outcome that is
desired the most. Councillor Zondervan said that the only conclusion that he can draw is that we are using
the wrong tool. He said to get what we want, we need to build it ourselves.
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that she is agnostic to the idea of light industrial use and the amount that we
have envisioned in this district because there was a zoning petition before the City Council that used the
light industrial to force a lab use. She said that to keep the two uses that they wanted as light industrial,
they used it as a level to build labs in the Alewife district. She said that you can zone for what you want
but there will be developers who ask for different things. She said that the City Council needs to prioritize
this and the City Council needs language before it. She said that we need to think about a 5-year
connectivity plan. She said that she is curious about the easements that the City has along the railroad
tracks. In terms of open space, Vice Mayor Mallon said that she is curious about the opportunity to
purchase the open space in the district. She said that there are parcels of land that the City could think
about to prioritize for a fire station, library, or community space so that we are not reliant on giving away
larger amounts of FAR to get a library. She said that the one thing that has frustrated her with the Alewife
process is that the City was about to give away the store to maybe get a bridge. Vice Mayor Mallon then
asked how the City is reaching out to property owners who are selling to do land transfers so that we can
start building what we really want to see in this district. Ms. Farooq said that it would be easier to create a
map of where the easements are located. She said that CDD does not have the full accounting of that and
they would need to consult with the City Solicitor and DPW to ensure that they have a comprehensive
list. She said that just because the City does have an easement does not mean that it is something that can
be made into a connection because sometimes the easements are very specific and for a specific purpose.
She stated that CDD can research this topic. In terms of acquiring land for open space and other
amenities, Ms. Farooq said that that is a question that is best directed to the City Manager. Vice Mayor
Mallon said that this is where some type of plan that comes along with this zoning is important so that it
doesn’t feel like it is happening in a vacuum. She said that some kind of accounting of easements and
what they are purposed for could be part of a connectivity plan. She said that it is clear that a path forward
is needed. She said that we should move forward with the zoning and work out the case in details through
the Ordinance Committee process.
Robert Reardon, consultant to the City Manager, stated that one of the things that he has been tasked with
is to find available open space. He said that the City is always on the look out but the opportunities are
not very forthcoming. He noted that the City did purchase a BBN site earlier in the year.
Councillor Carlone asked if the City is still pursing the site that was drawn on the City’s Master Plan. Mr.
Reardon stated that they are always looking for available sites and they are trying to make as many
inroads as possible. Councillor Carlone stated that CDD cannot study every part of the whole area to
understand how each district is zoned but he would like CDD to look at one of the blocks and study it so
that the City Council can see what the new zoning would mean.

Councillor Nolan stated her hope that the City staff is getting the sense that the City Council is united
with the idea that they are ready to stand poised to support you as you approach the next area of the city in
a broad thinking way to bring together this part of the city with a range of uses that are knitted together in
a more comprehensive fashion that is currently on the table. She reminded all that this is the entire area.
Regarding the Alewife Plan, she supports many elements of it but it is anticipated that there might be
some public use but it is important that that be clear. She said that as it relates to the location of a school
in that area, if we look at our anticipated population, it is clear that we will need infrastructure. She noted
that it is important to ensure that there is a water retention infrastructure. She said that she supports the
plan as long as it does include attention to public spaces because climate mitigation is just as important as
planning for a school, library or community center. Councillor Nolan asked if there is a better way than an
underpass to connect the whole section on the east side of the parkway from Rindge Towers and Jefferson
Park to the Tobin/Vassal Lane school to knit large green spaces together. She called attention to the report
that was done for the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority on connectivity. She urged all to take a look
at this report.
Councillor McGovern stated that during the course of this evening’s meeting, he did receive an e-mail
from Mike Johnston about the underpass and specifically about some concerns that he has about that. He
said that moving forward it is important to ensure that there are no adverse effects to the development of
affordable housing. Councillor Nolan stated that when she spoke with Mr. Johnston a month ago that the
CHA would not pay for it and it is important for it to fit in line with existing plans that the CHA has. She
said that the CHA has reserved some space for a multi-modal path along the railroad tracks but this needs
to be worked out and now is the time to do it.
Councillor Nolan stated that next steps are to communicate with CDD about this plan. She stated that it is
important for the City Council to know what CDD needs. She stated that her understanding is that Ms.
Farooq needs to know that the City Council wants this to happen and that the City Council is endorsing
the plan. She said that there is definite interest in this plan yet there is some question about what the
balance is. She said that part of the issue is that the zoning does not have a category for labs, only light
industrial, manufacturing or office.
Ms. Farooq stated it is always beneficial to receive from the City Council a Policy Order asking CDD to
embark on translating this plan into zoning. She said that this would be helpful. Councillor Nolan stated
that a Policy Order will be worked on after the hearing.
The Deputy City Clerk received one electronic communication (ATTACHMENT F) from Hannah and
Kristen Chun to be made part of the permanent record of the hearing.
