III. From June 7 Meeting – Future Gazing into 2032: Celebrating 15 Years of CBAC!
CBAC has articulated as its longer-term vision for Community Benefits Funds within the Overarching Logic Model:
Robust, widespread coordination and integration between non-profits, service providers, and other partners, including public
and corporate sectors, is used to deliver services to vulnerable families across Cambridge
• The system-wide capacity is sufficient and successful in meeting needs of vulnerable families
• Innovative and/or successful practices are readily adopted across the system in Cambridge
• Broad cross-sector collaboration is the norm in Cambridge
Cambridge families are satisfied and resilient in their housing, economic, and behavioral health status and are successful in their
work, school, and family lives
• Families have the ability and resources to maintain affordable and safe housing that meets their needs and desires
• Families are economically autonomous and mobile
• Families have the capacity to sustain and build upon on their own welfare

Families are empowered to self-advocate for themselves and their communities in city-wide planning processes and policy
change

Brainstorming what outcomes 15 years of CBAC could bring
CBAC’s role
• Collaborating in strengthening partnerships to provide supports for residents, with CBAC supporting, guiding, and being a
resource and collaborator in bring resources to partnerships
• CBAC able to sponsor and bring in additional resources for multiple rounds of funding – variety of partners for funding and
advocacy… CBAC as start-up for integrated system, basically a one-stop system that is transparent and easy for people to
find help that they need to advance self-sufficiency, intergenerational wealth transfer, and housing stability
• CBAC made the choice to focus first round of funding on families and not individuals
Impact on residents
• Systems streamlined to support housing stability, people stay in housing
• People accessing services in more timely way – mental health/ counseling, food, housing, financial insecurity – help match
people with help, better and easier help, leading to better pathways
• Housing issue is intractable – requires combined effort of government and partners
• Strengthening of partnerships between education and nonprofits – smoother and more seamless to make progress in fields
that schools have not moved the needle
• Race matters – e.g., math scores in CPS show consistent disparities
• Results – family-level data/ experience… CBAC heard in the beginning income level, consistency of 15% living at or below
poverty – say we have moved the needle on 15%...
• Partnerships having holistic approach – no wrong door
• A closely knit system/ network of nonprofits is great to have – and don’t want that as key goal, that people find resources;
services are not sufficient
Focus on systems change
• Build a deeper understanding of systems in place that impact people in different ways
• It is greater than system-wide capacity – is it perpetuating inequality that we have?
• Let’s build system vs. reflecting on systems we have
• Embrace antiracist approach to our work and push forward at systemic level – many things we could do in current context
• We wouldn’t have be having this conversation in the same way if not for Covid pandemic that is novel and racial pandemic
that is not… bringing heightened awareness to CBAC – and wanting to applaud us for moving forward, being resilient and
having to do work through Covid and other systemic issues – yet issues of systemic racism persist
Community Benefits Funds and funding
• With regard to other funding, other actors, corporate sector and public sector – momentum towards more holistic change
– create opportunities for investment, increased resources, and advocacy
• System in place that is clear and transparent for how to deal with mitigation funds that come in
• Increased perspective on tradeoffs and benefits of development
• Diversifying funding sources – where does this fit within the rationale/ charge/ scope of CBAC’s work?
• Shift our thinking that the solution about services/ capacity to provide services; it is about systems change
o Bullet 1 (The system-wide capacity is sufficient and successful in meeting needs of vulnerable families) – the
system is built on racism
• What are ways to think about advocacy, which is not what we were set up to do, and ways to reflect back to City Council?

IV. Evaluation: Reviewing Implementation Year 1 Evaluation Report with HRiA
Questions for discussion
• Communication remains an issue – what do you think can be done to address the disconnect?
• How can the Committee work to build relationships with grantees?
• Given the information shared in the report, what should the Committee focus on for Year 2?
• How can the evaluator role and the Committee role be better communicated?

Discussion
• Relationships require trust
• Not hearing conviction from grantees – questions related to process and relationships among Partnership organizations
feels mechanical and not relational; make sure this is meaningful for grantee organizations – holding this as opportunity to
do whatever is takes to realize outcomes with families
• Not surprised by findings – we are still operating in this model in which funder is saying to the grantees, “Here is the
funding, and here is what you need to do to get this funding…”
• Need trust – big systems change takes time, need to patient with each other
• I did not ever believe that expectation for systems change fell on Partnerships; with the Logic Model, the idea was that if
we deeply support Partnerships to deliver services, what could CBAC and the City learn about what systems change could
look like, and how could that inform city-related and state-related policies – not the idea that Partnerships were
responsible for systems change, but that the work that Partnerships did and barriers faced by the nonprofits and the
families they serve would be things that would help us collectively see the things that need to change over time toward
what we wanted
• And a challenge we face is relationship-building – coming to public meetings, with all of us present, some of the challenge is
tied to being a public body –how might we work to build individual relationships with Partnerships when connection is in
public with 11-12 Committee members
• Really this is a learning agenda, we are trying to learn; we need to separate out the heavy language related to systems
change – relationships are personal, and require space for introspection; we should strive to ensure that the relationship
between grantees and evaluator is closer and that there is a higher level of trust from CBAC; and we should think a little
harder about what we want to learn so that we get what we are looking for out of this
• With regards to systems-level change not being responsibility of Partnerships, from conversations HRiA has had with
Partnerships and data we have collected, I don’t think Partnerships saw themselves as responsible; rather, when we are
getting feedback about more communication, better relationships, along with COVID, all are contributing to Partnerships’
sense that they are not seeing CBAC’s or the City’s efforts to make changes
• I hope that this builds opportunity for discussion between Partnerships & CBAC – from the outset, we said, “This is an
experiment, we are all going to learn from this…”, and then Covid came; this is great learning opportunity, and if
communications are better and expectations are clearer, we can improve relationships
• A couple of things that resonated – I appreciate the framing of an overarching tone/ tenor – it doesn’t feel as collaborative
as we want it to be, and that came through in slides and the report; another thought, I don’t know about Open Meeting
Law parameters, and wonder about more frequent and different types of communication, that are not one-directional, but
that allow for more authentic communication over time
• I second the above comment that Partnerships don’t feel like the responsibility for systems change is on them, and the
frame that this is a learning opportunity to lead to systems-level change is great; where there is a gap is around how does
what we, as Partnerships, are learning influence policies and practices?
• A lot of important insights, so what are we going to do with this information right now? There is a sense of urgency given
the needs of nonprofit organizations and families are so great, and so how do we have that space and time to make good
use of these insights? There is a tension there – the necessity to keep moving forward and learn as we go, take time for
reflections; systems-level stuff is always a huge question in my mind – we are not set up nor is it fair to think that
Partnerships could be responsible; it needs to be collective effort, and I am not sure that we have all of those inputs;
similarly, I don’t think that CBAC can do systems-level change; rather, where in Cambridge are we having systems-level
discussion with the City, nonprofits, residents, developers, City Council, etc. about housing? I don’t see that as a
responsibility for this group and CBAC could play a part; as others said, it is really difficult to do relationship-building when
it is the whole group meeting together, and are there different models we can think about? For example, Massachusetts
Cultural Council sends peers to look at each other’s sites/ projects; could we do something similar?
• This information is very timely – help us consider what is it that we ask, what is it that we need to know? We also need to
consider how we approach Partnerships, and be mindful of the ways we are communicating with them and the ways
communications are going so that it is not one-sided – their learning agenda is really an important part of this; so that
means if processes around service delivery or innovation need to be redesigned, we should be open to that – processes
need to be successful for families, and the services that are being delivered; we need to be listening to Partnerships, and
pushing further down into Partnerships about how processes could be improved, not just services
• With communication – I don’t think we have ever asked Partnerships how they want to be communicated with, and with
what frequency; we as CBAC think about it, but not eliciting that perspective from Partnerships themselves
• Good/ concise slideshow; evaluation is on the process, which may be separate from what Partnerships are necessarily
doing

Many interesting and important ideas for mid-course corrections; one of the things that hangs over us is the Logic Model –
could we think of it as iterative model such that we are thinking about what Logic Model looks like over time? Is there some
way to shift Logic Model as well along the way?
I like that way that of thinking – our ultimate goal is to find the solutions and then we were hit with the Covid pandemic
that changed everything – it is a conversation CABC should have or HRIA should have with grantees; what we are trying to
do is learn from the ground

V. Partnerships: Looking Ahead to Fall 2021 Check-Ins
Where we are: Implementation Phase – 3 years (March 2020 – March 2023)
Year 1 (March 2020 – March 2021)
• April 2020: each Partnership submits revised a Scope of Services for Year 1
• October 2020: CBAC check-in with each Partnership
• February 2021: Partnerships submit Year 1 review & Year 2 intentions
• March 2021: CBAC decides to advance Year 2 grant extensions to all Partnerships, and meet with two Partnerships in 3
months to check in on progress
Year 2 (March 2021 – March 2022)
• June 2021: CBAC decides to meet with all 4 Partnerships for 6-month check-in
• September & October 2021: CBAC check-in with each Partnership
Year 3 (March 2022 – March 2023)
Looking ahead to Fall 2021 check-ins with Partnerships
Proposed process for Fall 2021 check-ins with each Partnership:
• CBAC begin discussion and idea generation for questions to ask now, and then delegate to ad hoc group to finalize
questions before end of August
• CBAC chair invite Partnerships and send questions in advance
• CBAC meet with each Partnership – anticipated dates:
• Monday September 20, 4pm – 6pm
• Monday October 4, 4pm – 6pm
Looking at the October 2020 questions CBAC asked of each Partnership…
• What of the October 2020 questions do we definitely want to ask?
• What of the Oct 2020 questions do we definitely not want to ask?
• What other question(s) might we want to ask of each Partnership?
• What (else) might CBAC do to support successful check-ins?
Discussion:
• October 2020 meetings seemed positive, very much a learning moment
• One meeting won’t solve all of the issues – by making check-ins more informal, we can lower stakes
• Focus on basic set of questions – e.g., Where are you in Implementation? What is working? What is challenging? What
would be helpful to your Partnership?
• What happens to the Partnerships’ answers to the questions CBAC poses?
• Be clear up front what we want to learn
• Rather than ask specific questions, invite Partnerships to speak to certain themes
• Considering what CBAC might do after the check-in meetings, what other modalities can we use that may not require
bringing all members of a Partnership in front of all members of CBAC? Are there ways to bring smaller groups of partners
and CBAC members together?
• Considering what is possible with CBAC information sharing and other methods of support – it could be that 2-3 CBAC
members go to meet with partners/ each Partnership and then share back with full CBAC
• Next steps: Ad hoc group will meet in August to develop approach to check-ins – including process, questions, and
communications

Encouragement to CBAC to share all evaluation reports with Partnerships and community – transparency can help build
trust
Conversation about learning process for all involved – making something about learning can change processes, and may
make check-ins less high stakes; and consider how learning from Partnerships could shape CBAC and City policies and
practices – could help nonprofit leaders see CBAC and Community Benefits Fund as an aspirational opportunity
Intrigued by level of openness, and what is possible with focus on learning
