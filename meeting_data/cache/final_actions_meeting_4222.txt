•

•

•

Update requirements so all development meets Alewife District Plan recommendations and other standards seen in recent
projects in the City:

•

Increased open space

•

Parking maximums

•

Larger range of permitted uses

Gradate heights so taller heights and densities are achievable along the railroad tracks and further east.
•

To take advantage of increased heights and densities, provide one or more defined public benefits

•

Require ground-story neighborhood uses along priority “main streets”; incentivize elsewhere

•

Minimum residential development required to balance new commercial development; residential development incentivized
by taller heights and densities compared to commercial development

For largest landholders/developers, provide a pathway for a flexible development approach that results in the delivery of specific,
prioritized public benefits.
