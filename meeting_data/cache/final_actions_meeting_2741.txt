The first Annual Surveillance Report was submitted on December 9, 2019 and referred to the
Committee on Public Safety. That report is still before the Committee, see January 22, 2020 Committee
Agenda <http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_Meeting.aspx?ID=2605>, and is available here:

The second Annual Surveillance Reports include any updates regarding the use of Departments’
