Research Project Objectives and Goal
Project Objectives
• To understand the prevalence and types of bias experienced by residents in
Cambridge Inclusionary Housing Program (IHP)

those in market-rate IHP units or all-affordable developments
Overall Project Goal
• To inform the City’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the Inclusionary Housing
Program and advance a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community

Overview of Findings and Presentation
• IHP participants (renters and owners of affordable IHP units)
– Comparison to Residents in IHP Market-rate Units and
– Comparison to Residents in All-Affordable Developments

• Experiences with the IHP program and staff were generally positive
• Strong ties to Cambridge, high levels of satisfaction with neighborhoods
• Overall, 49% of residents in affordable IHP units did not experience bias
• 40% of residents in affordable IHP units did experience bias
• Main reasons: race, living in an affordable unit, income, having children, gender
• Main sources (who was committing bias against residents): Property Management and
market-rate residents
• Residents of affordable IHP units experienced significantly greater frequency-exposure to
bias than residents of market-rate IHP units

Social Exclusion: How We Measured Bias

a

The Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) measures 8 types of bias
(e.g. lack of respect, being treated differently than others; called names or insulted)

• For each of the 8 types of bias, people are asked:
– Frequency
•
•
•
•
•
•

Almost every day (6)
At least once a week (5)
A few times a month (4)
A few times a year (3)
Less than once a year (2)
Never (1)

Total EDS scores range from 8 to 48

– Reason (e.g., race, gender, age, income)
– Source (e.g. building resident, property management)
