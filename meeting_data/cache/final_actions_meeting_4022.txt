To the Honorable, the City Council:

The State’s Conflict of Interest Law at General Laws Chapter 268A, Section 29 requires that
each municipality designate a “senior level employee of the municipality” to serve as its liaison
to the State Ethics Commission. The statute requires the State Ethics Commission to disseminate
information to the designated liaison and conduct educational seminars for designated liaisons on
a regular basis. Deputy City Solicitor Arthur Goldberg has been serving in this function since
2009, when Section 29 first took effect. Because of his impending retirement from the City, it is
necessary for the City Council to designate a new liaison to the State Ethics Commission.
In accordance with the requirements of the law, I am requesting that the City Council designate
First Assistant City Solicitor Megan Bayer as the City of Cambridge liaison to the State Ethics
Commission effective April 1, 2022.

March 21, 2022
To the Honorable, The City Council:
The setting of the Water/Sewer rate occurs each March. As the City continues to be impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked hard to provide relief to residents and businesses as well as limit
increases in taxes, fees, and rates where possible.
The establishment of the FY23 Water/Sewer rates remains challenging with consumption still lower than
pre COVID levels, which impacts water and sewer revenues. We have been able to adjust some
expenditures to offset lower revenues projected for FY23 based on FY22 estimates to allow for a modest
increase in rates. Operating and capital expenditures have been modified and reduced for FY23 from what
was projected in last year’s letter. The FY23 Sewer Budget reflects savings resulting from reduced bond
issuance and receiving a low interest rate (1.9%) on sewer bonds sold earlier this month. It should be noted
that the Sewer Budget is comprised mostly of fixed costs such as debt service and the MWRA assessment,
which totals 88% of the total Sewer Budget.
The Water/Sewer bills that will be issued in July will be for the usage period April-June 2022 and will
reflect the new sewer rate. The water rate reflects a minimal increase from FY22.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The City administration and City Council continue to recognize the importance of minimizing increases in
water and sewer rates. I recommend that the City Council approve a 1.96% increase in the water
consumption block rate and an 8.0% increase in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 6.7% increase in
the combined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2022, and ending March 31, 2023. The water rate
increase has been consistent for over a decade in which the water rate has increased by a very small
percentage or not at all. In last year’s recommendation, the projected FY23 rate increases for water, sewer,
and combined were 1.98%, 8.0%, and 6.7%, respectively, based on March 2021 consumption rates and
projected budgets, which is essentially identical to this year’s actual recommended increase.
In March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates, which determine water and sewer
revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of the timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set prior to
the adoption of both the Cambridge budget and Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA)
budget; therefore, revenue needs are based upon estimated expenditures. Generally, water and sewer rates
have been established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other related revenue
sources, cover projected annual costs.

1.7.a

WATER

The planned FY23 capital allocation is $5,997,000 using pay-as-you-go capital funding based on current
revenues. FY23 capital projects consist of significant improvements to our water system including water
mains; upgrading the treatment plant’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which
is the software and hardware that enables the Operators to operate, control and document the operations of
the treatment plant; Fresh Pond Master Plan implementation and reservation projects; and reservoir gaging
station maintenance. In FY22, $1.8 million from the Water Fund balance was used to support phase one of
the SCADA implementation. For FY23, that amount will be increased to $3.51 million.
Water and sewer revenues are generally linked to water consumption, with sewer costs comprising
approximately 79.7% of total water and sewer expenditures. As a result of the gradual easing of COVID19 pandemic related shutdowns, billed water consumption has remained approximately even in the first
half of FY22 as compared to the first half of FY21.
Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of Water Fund projected revenues and expenditures for FY22-27.
Table 7 on page 8 shows actual Water Fund balances for FY17-21 and the projected balance for FY22.
SEWER
The FY23 Sewer Budget reflects a $1,507,357 increase from the FY22 Projected Budget. This includes the
MWRA assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public Works budget. Debt
service on sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for 88% of the total FY23 Sewer Budget.
The preliminary FY23 MWRA assessment is scheduled to increase by $1,031,971 or 3.7% from the final
FY22 assessment. The MWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the MWRA
budget, which is adopted later in spring 2022. These changes have typically been minor in past years. Unlike
the water budget, sewer revenues are credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary fund that
can be drawn upon if the need arises.
Included in the sewer budget are debt service costs attributable to the $12,260,000 general obligation bonds
(net of premium) issued in March 2022, used to fund sewer projects in Alewife, and Harvard Square, as
well as capital repairs and climate change projects.
The FY23 capital allotment of $2,500,000 in sewer revenues will continue to finance the remedial
reconstruction program.
The City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer systems to ensure
Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and environmentally sound water and sewer system. In
addition to the projects currently under way, the City’s five-year capital plan (FY23-27) calls for an
additional investment of approximately $189,463,729 (primarily sewer, $173,518,729) in the water and
sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the issuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and takes
advantage of State MWRA interest free loans and grants to ensure that debt service cost increases, which
impact the sewer rate, remain moderate.
Subsidies from the State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan program will cover only $44,641 or 0.17% of the total
debt service of $26,491,458 for all FY23 sewer projects. The FY23-27 capital plan includes other projects
that may be eligible for subsidized loans from the state. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects

to salary costs and chemical costs.

will receive state subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated based on funding
through general obligation bonds. If state subsidies become available to the City, they will be used to lower
the sewer rate in future years. Table 5 on page 6 shows the detail of sewer-related expenditures and revenues
for FY22-27.

granted the Clause 41C elderly real estate exemption. For FY22, the income guidelines are as follows:
single, income of $28,250 with assets of $56,498 or less; married, income of $42,377 with assets of $77,685
or less.

Overall, the City has been extremely successful over the past five years in producing minimal water and
sewer rate increases. The average annual increases for the FY19-23 period are as follows: water, 0.6%;
sewer, 7.4%; and combined, 5.8%. The average annual increases for the FY14-23 period are as follows:
water, 0.3%; sewer, 6.4%; and combined, 4.8%.
Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain five-year forecasts for water, sewer, and combined revenue estimates as well
as Water Fund balances for the past five years and the projected FY22 Fund Balance. The City will continue
to review appropriate use of Fund Balance for a specific project, or to lower the rate.
As can be seen in Table 6, the annual combined water/sewer rate is projected to increase by an average of
approximately 6.3% for FY23-27. The projected increase is the result of the City’s commitment to bonding
sewer infrastructure improvement projects and increases in the MWRA assessment. If the increases in
MWRA assessment are moderate, the rate increases that are shown will be lowered. Conversely, if
consumption decreases, there will be a negative effect on water and sewer revenues.
Our water and sewer program is structured to produce reasonable rate increases in the future. The goal of
the City Administration and City Council is to minimize the effects of water and sewer rate increases on
residents as much as possible, while continuing to provide major investment in our infrastructure.

Very truly yours,

March 7, 2022
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of the Emergency Management Performance Grant
(EMPG) from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) in the amount of
$39,600.00 to the Grant Fund Fire Extraordinary Expenditures account.
The funds will be used to support the purchase of a new vehicle to support the Emergency
Preparedness and Coordination office. This vehicle, a Ford Interceptor Utility 3.3L Hybrid, will
replace a 2007 8-cylinder gas vehicle currently in use, has been approved by Green Committee,
meets the Massachusetts Green Communities criteria, and is one of the most efficient SUVs
available for public safety purposes.
In addition to being more efficient the new vehicle will improve logistical capabilities and
provide increased capacity to transport greater quantities of equipment.
This request has been reviewed and approved by the Green Fleet Committee.
Very truly yours,

March 7, 2022
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to forward the attached request from the Massachusetts Department of Conservation
(DCR), regarding the reactivation of the parking meters installed last year on segments of
Memorial Drive near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and along Cambridge Parkway.
Based on state legislation passed last year (Chapter 70 of the Acts of 2021), in order to reactivate
these parking meters, DCR must have “…received prior approval from the local appropriating
authority, as defined in section 21C of chapter 59, of the municipality in whose boundaries such
charge or fee is collected on or after January 1, 2021.” In the case of the meters installed in
Cambridge, this means receiving approval from the Cambridge City Council.
As described in DCR’s request, these meters were originally installed in May 2021, but
payments and enforcement were suspended in October 2021. The meters installed in Cambridge
did not generate any significant feedback or concerns; the suspension of meter payments and
enforcement was based on concerns expressed in the City of Revere regarding meters on Revere
Beach Parkway, which led to passage of the state legislation.
The meters installed in Cambridge are consistent with other parking meters operated by the
Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department, in terms of location, pricing, and payment
options-including the ability to use the Passport mobile payment application. In addition, they
are consistent with our overall transportation and parking policies, which aim to promote the use
of sustainable transportation and limit the availability of unrestricted parking, particularly in
dense areas where they could be used as free commuter parking by non-residents. As noted in the
attached request, DCR has made adjustments to the program to accommodate the needs of users
loading and unloading at Poorman’s Landing along Cambridge Parkway.
I hope that you will allow DCR to move forward with reactivating these parking meters and
recommend that you approve this request.

City of Cambridge, On-Street Parking Fee Collection Proposal

CC:

FROM:
DATE:
RE:

DCR is seeking approval from the City of Cambridge to resume year-round on-street parking fee
collection on Memorial Drive and Cambridge Parkway. (Collection was suspended on October 1, 2021.)
Proposal Summary
If approved, parking fee collection and enforcement operations would resume on Memorial Drive and
Cambridge Parkway. The operation would be essentially the same as it was from May 1 through October
1, 2021, with 1 minor change on Cambridge Parkway, as noted below**.
Fee collection for all Cambridge on-street meters would be Monday through Saturday, excluding
Holidays, with an hourly parking rate of $1.25/hour.
•

Memorial Drive would charge a parking fee from 8AM-8PM daily. Spaces would have no
maximum time limit EXCEPT for the small section immediately west of the main entrance to
MIT’s Killian Court, which is designated 1 Hour Limit.

•

Cambridge Parkway would charge a fee from 8AM-6PM daily**.
➢ **Prior to October 1, all DCR on-street meters were active 8AM-8PM. The change to
an 8AM-6PM operation on Cambridge Parkway would mirror the operational hours
of nearby First Street, and intersecting streets from Linskey Way to Thorndike
Street.
➢ Note: In June, 2021, 2 parking spaces in the vicinity of Poorman’s Landing were
designated as 30-Minute Parking, 8AM-8PM, at the request of the Friends of
Poorman’s Landing. These spaces would remain as-is, providing free short-term
parking for boaters needing to load/unload.

Options for vehicle operators:
•
•

Pay with credit card or quarters at multi-space parking meters (IPS MS-1 pay stations)
Pay with Passport or ParkBoston mobile payment app. (Additional payment apps could be
added in the future.)

payment starting at 7am (same day).
No Parking is allowed during declared snow emergencies, or during street sweeping
operations. (Parking meters and mobile apps will reinforce the parking restriction message,
and will not accept payment during parking bans.)

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS

COUNCILLOR TONER
COUNCILLOR AZEEM
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

At least seven Economic Empowerment (EE) and Social
Equity (SE) applicants in Cambridge have so far
received their business permits, and Cambridge is
poised to soon have one of the highest concentrations
of equity adult use cannabis retail establishments in the
state, yet to date, only one business has been able to open their doors; and

WHEREAS:

A variety of factors have contributed to the slow start of establishing local
recreational dispensaries, including but not limited to procedural delays
caused by the pandemic, litigation, and the significant costs associated with
obtaining licenses, securing product, securing and holding retail space during
an international pandemic, and the hiring and training of staff; and

WHEREAS:

The two-year delay caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has presented a particularly
difficult challenge for local Equity Empowerment (the “EE”) and Social Equity (the
“SE”) applicants to navigate, as those who secured retail space two or more years ago
in anticipation of offsetting their monthly rent with their monthly profits have instead
had to absorb two years’ worth of rent without any sales to offset these costs,
threatening the fiscal viability of some these fledgling enterprises; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s pioneering exclusivity period has built a
strong foundation for equitable development of the
emerging adult-use cannabis industry, but it is
imperative to consider additional ways to assist EE and
SE applicants through the immense challenges they
face; and

WHEREAS:

Another significant cost will be the local “Impact Fees,” which the City defines in all
its HCAs as “…the amount of three percent (3%) of the Applicant’s gross revenues
derived from the Cannabis Business’ sales…[because]…[t]he Parties anticipate that, as
a result of the Applicant’s operation of the Cannabis Business, the City will incur
additional expenses and impacts upon its road system, law enforcement, inspectional
services, permitting services, administrative services, educational services and public
health services, in addition to potential unforeseen impacts upon the City,” and these
fees must be paid to the City on an annual basis; and

Packet Pg. 61

2.10

WHEREAS:

Massachusetts has collected $74.2 million from cannabis sales as of December
2021, the excise tax of 10.75% on recreational cannabis comprising less than
half of the total tax revenue being collected for cannabis, as there is also a
6.25% state sales tax, plus the local tax of 3% and the Impact Fees
of up to 3% of gross revenue, which all added up to $208 million in total tax
revenue last fiscal year; and

WHEREAS:

Due to substantial and negative impact of the 3% local tax (Impact Fees) on the
viability of these EE and SE Cannabis Dispensaries, and in light of the supporting
evidence from other Massachusetts municipalities that the removal of these Impact
Fees would not have any appreciable impacts upon the community or add significant
additional costs to the City, it would be a small but significant action if the City were to
remove or reduce this additional financial hurdle for local EE and SE applicants, in an
effort to support the viability of these businesses during such uncertain times for brick
and mortar businesses; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has repeatedly declared its strong support for creating
favorable conditions that would provide EE and SE applicants with the
greatest chances for success, and to that end it would be just and equitable for
the City to conditionally waive impact fees for all Cannabis Businesses
until and unless the city is required to expend funds to mitigate specific
impacts from Cannabis Businesses, and to exempt EE and SE applicants
from any such charges to the maximum extent permissible ; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to amend all existing Community
Host Agreements previously issued by the City by reducing the Impact Fee to 0.05%
of Gross Revenue and to refrain from placing this burden upon any future HCAs that
may yet be issued, unless supporting evidence is provided by the City showing a
finding that it incurred additional expenses and impacts upon its road system, law
enforcement, inspectional services, permitting services, administrative services,
educational services and public health services greater than the .05% of Gross Revenue
collected from all the EE and SE dispensaries annually; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with relevant staff
to provide a comprehensive, data-driven update on Cambridge’s emerging
cannabis industry at a future hearing of the Finance Committee, including (but
not limited to):
•
•

Information on the number of EE and SE applicants seeking to open in
Cambridge and where they stand in the process

Cambridge to date
A legal opinion on the possibility of completely exempting EE and SE
applicants from impact fees that may be assessed, or to charge them
proportionally less than other applicants, as a matter of equity
An itemization from the City Manager listing all the fees imposed
upon EE and SE applicants from the issuing of the special permit to the
issuing of the Certificate of Occupancy
An accounting of the approximate amount of time, on average, it takes an
applicant to progress from expressing an interest in opening their business in
the City to being issued the Certificate of Occupancy; and be it further

Mass. Ave. Redesign for Bike/Bus Lanes Porter Square

I have lived in Cambridge for 40+ years and was a former small business owner of two stores on Mass. Ave., City Lights
and Lamp Glass. The proposed ordinance to remove most parking on Mass. Ave. would have put my husband and I out
of business. People do not use a bike or bus to come and buy a dining room chandelier, floor lamp, or fragile glass lamp
shades.
I am now almost 75 years old and unfortunately for physical reasons, cannot ride a bike. Although I walk and use
public transportation, I also use a car to do errands, shop for groceries, etc. We need a comprehensive plan that
addresses the needs of all Cambridge residents, and improve safety for everyone, regardless of mode of transportation,
age, or physical disability. The current bike ordinance does not do that and seems to discriminate against older or
disabled residents as well as the small businesses along both sides of Mass. Ave. Directing more traffic into densely
populated side streets does not make sense. Making Mass. Ave. a one-lane street in either direction does not make
sense either as evidenced by the traffic jams between Dudley St. and Alewife Brook Parkway that have resulted from the
changes made in that area.
If the majority of cyclists are using Mass. Ave. as a way to get in and out of Cambridge, how does that serve Cambridge
residents? Has the median strip been investigated to serve as a bike lane and at the same time, add more stop lights
along Mass. Ave. to create safe pedestrian cross walks?
Clearly the City has to do something so that traffic fatalities and bike accidents do not happen. However the current
bike ordinance is not the solution and should be revised with more input from all Cambridge residents and business
owners.

Proposed Safety Plan

Dear City Councilors and Officials:
I support bike lanes but I do not approve of the proposed plan to remove the parking on Mass Ave, and the proposed
changes to the traffic patterns. I support the businesses and neighborhoods that rely on Mass Ave as a major roadway
for our city. We need a plan for the city that will Improve Safety for everyone, will help Traffic flow, preserve Parking
and support Public Transportation and Businesses. If the Bicycle Safety Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets
those goals, the ordinance needs to be changed.

rely on Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a plan for the city that will Improve Safety for everyone, will

I am a biker, an eighty-year-old pedestrian, a driver and a public transit traveler. I get all of it, for every constituency. But
these changes suit no one, and in the end, will cause chaotic walking, driving, bus riding and biking. PLEASE DO NOT
make these changes. We need a better plan.

3/07/22

I moved from New York to Boston in the early seventies. At the time Cambridge had a
wealth of independent small shops. I felt it was a safe place to put down roots and run
my own business.
Due to the progression of events of the past eight months I no longer feel that this is
true. There is a striking absence of compassion for small business owners.
This is not a game. Our businesses are fragile at this stage of the pandemic.
Shop owners have been working 50 hour weeks to keep things going.
Many have had to deplete their savings and take out loans to stay solvent. Now those
loans are coming due, and customers are returning, but plans to recover will be
crushed by the removal of a key element for our survival, ADEQUATE PARKING.
I ask the Council to please slow down the bike safety ordinance plans so that they
can review the extent of the damage already done to the small businesses it has
impacted. These consequences may have been unintended, but they have caused
hardship to many still reeling from the pandemic.
Any plan that comes at such an uneven high cost to one sector of the population is
deeply flawed.
Mass Ave is dotted with many specialty businesses. These are carefully curated
enterprises that attract loyal followings, many from beyond a bike-able radius. My
business has a broad customer base. It depends on this extended fan base to make
our premium rent. Over 60% of our business comes from outlying communities and
out-of-state. This is even higher during the summer months when locals are away on
vacation. Our outlying visitors want to support our stores. Where are these key
customers going to park if the already scarce street parking is further limited?
Parking space in my neighborhood below Porter Square is already at a critical stage.
There are no public parking lots, and residential parking, requiring permits, has been
further impacted by the new condos recently built. Retail tenants will hesitate to
renew leases without reasonable customer parking and loading zones, because it
doesn’t make sense.
Please take the time to weigh the consequences before continuing this project.
Moving up deadlines, without a re-think of this plan, is tone-deaf in this era of Covid
recovery.
Thank you,

I Support Porter Sq. Bike Lakes

I am resident of Newport Rd., two blocks south of Porter Square. My wife and I are regular bike riders and bike
commuters. We support the installation of separated bike lanes in Porter Sq. 100%. I consider it one of the most
dangerous intersections in the city because of the number and complexity of lights, lanes, entry and exit points; and
because it is a traffic hub for commuters and trucks which pose the highest threat to bikes. We both attended the
ceremony for Joe Lavins (sp?) who was killed there a couple of years back because a colleague of his is a close friend.
In addition, we have seen and read the objections stating that local business will be hurt. I am certain the council has
also seen the data that completely disproves that argument. Pedestrians and cyclists window shop and stop at local
stores much more frequently than people driving through in their cars.
We are unable to make the public hearing due to work commitments, but we STRONGLY urge the city council
PS - while building the lanes also think about pedestrians because people running in front of cars to get to the T is a huge
danger in Porter.
Thank you.

ARPA funding for Cambridge HEART

Hello,
My name is Hope Turner. I am a Cambridge resident and a social worker. I live in Strawberry Hill.
I want to urge the city council and City Manager of Cambridge to use 5.5 million of the 88 million dollars in ARPA funding
to support the Cambridge HEART program. I support the ARPA funding going to the HEART program, as HEART is the
recovery program we should invest in as a pandemic recovery support and the kind of community based alternative public
safety program that will help build a better Cambridge.
Please consider the HEART proposal for ARPA funding. One specific component to the request is to spend $5.5 million
over 2 years, to cover the costs that the anti-aid amendment will not cover. I have learned that the City of Cambridge
spends $630 per resident per year on the Police Department. By contrast, Cambridge HEART is requesting an amount
that is $23 per resident per year. This will be a much better use of public funding to support ALL Cantabrigians.
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Hope

Support for Mass Ave bike lanes, Harvard Sq to Fresh Pond

I reside near Mass Ave, just uptown from the Common.
I wish to register my support for bike lanes. I applaud the City for its commitment to make a bike-friendly and ecological
Cambridge, despite NIMBY opposition. As a cyclist, I very much appreciate the new bike lanes. We are not the first city in
the world to do this.
* Almost everywhere protected bike lanes have been installed, studies have shown that they help or are neutral towards
adjacent businesses. They improve the urban environment, and save energy.
* After a period of adjustment, opposition almost always dies down and the vast majority of people become supportive.
* Cambridge needs to walk the walk on climate, not endless studies and debate over objections, process, and plan
details. I urge the City to hold fast to its commitment to quickly building out a robust and continuous network of
protected bike lanes.

Dear City Clerk, please add the following item to the upcoming City Council Agenda?
Yours In Peace,

Cambridge,MA
Was the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Minimum Standards for Fair and Frequent Elections at the Alliance of
Cambridge Tenants (ACT) Violated or NOT, By Whom ACT or CHA or Both?

What is Happening at the Cambridge Housing Authority that is Causing ACT's Election
Backlash and Delays?
Peace Be Unto You,
According to Human Services and Media Ethics advocacy, I'm within my universal rights to report the truth as a citizen
journalist. The story that I'm reporting on today, concerns the Alliance of Cambridge Tenant's (ACT) Board of Directors
ongoing elections, as they relate to Cambridge's low income federally subsidized renter households, the Cambridge
Housing Authority(CHA), tax payers, and the general population of citizens and residents at large. The question is pending,
"if a resident/tenant council fails to satisfy minimum standards for fair and frequent elections or fail to follow its own
procedures as adopted in its By-Laws, I ask, where does ACT stand concerning its board of directors election?
According to ACT's Bylaws, the next ACT election is supposed to take place in April/ May of this year (2022). The election
committee has to be set up nine months before the election, which means September 2021. It's now March 2022 and
nothing has been done to start the election process.The current ACT Board's term ends on April 21, 2022. The current
Board's term expires in less than six weeks. What will happen to ACT if this happens without an election to renew the
Board.?
When looking at ACT's current board election dilemma, one must also look at the Cambridge Housing Authority's role in
helping low income subsidized renters, members of the citywide resident/ tenant organization to form and maintain a
jurisdiction-wide board of directors. According to the Federal Code of Regulations CFR 24, and dictates within it, the CHA is
mandated to do all it can, if it has the resources to make resident/tenant elections possible. Now current low income
renters are faced with the dilemma of who's responsible for the delay in their federally mandated resident/ tenant board
of director's election, ACT or CHA or both.
Finally, I say to the guilty ones, come clean, stop hiding the truth.

mass ave bike lane construction

I have been a resident of Cambridge, MA for thirty years, work at a clinic that has been providing care to the community
of Cambridge for over fifty years, and these parking changes will not only greatly hamper the business but also directly
prohibit access to care for so many of our pediatric population patients.

I believe any changes to Porter Square should be delayed until the economic impact studies are complete, the
MBTA takes down the trolley wires and we can remove the median strip and build a full permanent bike
infrastructure that mitigates negative impacts to residents and businesses.
I am not opposed to a network of safe bicycle infrastructure, but we want it to be built based on actual data, in a
thoughtful manner that takes into account the needs of residents, businesses, pedestrians, cyclists, and
the mobility impaired. We do not need to rush the installation of a bad plan only to re-visit it and build again in the
near future. Let's get it right the first time.

To whom it may concern,

February 8, 2022

I participated in last Monday’s webinar and came away with the impression that the importance and effectiveness of the
code under consideration is being short-changed. The full potential of the proposed “stretch code” has NOT been
sufficiently appreciated or required.
Isn’t the immanent purpose of advancing this code at this time to make it more possible to meet the goals of the Global
Warming Solutions Act and the Roadmap in reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions to by 2050?
To wean ourselves off fossil fuels as quickly as possible it is imperative to STOP the provision of fossil fuel hook ups in
any new and renovated building. The Governor’s proposal fails muster in that it allows continued reliance on fossil fuels
and their GHG emissions. This is just high level greenwashing.
It is simply counterproductive and wrong to allow a policy which clearly ADDS to our emissions profile. To fully realize
the potential of the reworked stretch code the Commonwealth must not allow installation of fossil fuel appliances in
new and renovated buildings.

Endorse the BluePrint for Peace

Dear Mr. Wilson,
We face staggering levels of violence in America and around the globe. The personal, social and economic costs to
individuals, families, and our communities can be overwhelming, and yet we have far more effective root cause
solutions available than we are currently employing. We must implement policies and invest in programs, both
domestically and internationally, that are proven to work, and bring them up to the scale needed to turn this
devastation around.
As a constituent, I am urging you to endorse and sign-on to this broad framework of the ” BluePrint for Peace” in
support of positive solutions to all types of violence.
These proven effective solutions should be robustly implemented at local, state, federal and international levels,
lowering the financial and emotional cost to our country and world while building social resilience. They include:
Humanize Justice Systems: Move away from overly punitive policies toward healing-oriented, rehabilitative-focused
criminal and juvenile justice approaches that address underlying root causes.
Empower Community Interventions: Comprehensive activities and strategies working to address such challenges as nonviolent crime, domestic violence, gang violence, etc. as well as healing trauma and other broad prevention-focused
supports, particularly for marginalized communities.
Practicing Peace in Schools: Conflict resolution curricula in our schools, using neuro-regulatory strategies and tools such
as social-emotional learning, empathetic and nonviolent communication techniques, restorative processes, mindfulness,
and other proven peacebuilding skills/modalities to increase graduation rates and transform violence, bullying, truancy,
and other challenges facing youth.
Enhance Personal and Interpersonal Supports: Robust resources addressing mental health, trauma, PTSD, suicide
prevention, domestic violence, workplace violence, life skills, parenting skills, and related areas.
Foster International Peace: Peacebuilding approaches to international conflict and atrocity prevention in global hotspots
through mediation, diplomacy, and effective on-the-ground programs. Led on the ground by diverse and representative
local stakeholders.

Please revise the Bike Safety Ordinance

Dear City Clerk,
I am writing as a concerned resident and business owner in Cambridge.
While I do hope for a solution that allows everyone to feel safe on the roads, and helps reduce the environmental
impact of transit around and through cambridge, I do NOT approve of the proposed plan to remove the parking on
Mass Ave, or the proposed changes to the traffic patterns. I support the businesses and neighborhoods that rely on
Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a plan for the city that will BALANCE the needs to improve
safety, traffic flow, public transportation AND preservation of badly-needed parking. If the Bicycle Safety
Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the ordinance NEEDS to be changed. As it is currently
structured, the Ordinance really puts all the cost of these changes on vulnerable businesses and vulnerable
communities (like the elderly, disabled, and low-income families who NEED free accessible parking for their cars—
otherwise, this policy will essentially be pushing those families OUT of Cambridge).
I appreciate your efforts, and I hope you will heed a broad spectrum of needs across the City, and look to revise the
Ordinance in a more balanced way.
Thank you!

Re: Tremont Street Neighborhood Association opposition to proposed curb cut at 221 Columbia Street at the
southwest corner of Market Street. APP 2022 #12
Dear City Councillors,
The Tremont Street Neighborhood Association opposes the proposed curb cut at 221 Columbia Street at
the southwest corner of Market Street, Cambridge, MA 02139 in conjunction with developer’s plans to
demolish the two family property at 221 Columbia Street at the southwest corner of Market Street and replace it
with two townhouses.
As grounds for this opposition, the Association states that the developer planned addition of two
townhouses will add even more to the rapid develop of many new units in this already dense, overcrowded
neighborhood. Three new townhouses have just built on Tremont Street and Murdock Streets within the last
two years alone. The many, many recent additional units added to the neighborhood should be limited.
Also this will also take away a valuable on-street parking place from the neighborhood
Further, the valuable community member Kingdom Empowerment Center (formerly First Holiness
Church) at 211 Columbia Street opposes the curb cut and has concerns about the project. The church does the
Port Back to School Festival and the backpack giveaways.
We request that the city not allow this curb cut associated with new development. Thank you for your
consideration.
Very truly yours,

Opposition to proposed Mass. Ave/Upland Road Traffic Changes

Dear City of Cambridge Officials:
I am writing as a concerned resident that has resided in the city of Cambridge, on Upland Road for 64 years. Rarely have
I seen a project such as the Mass Ave/Transportation proposals, which have cost taxpayers probably close to
1,000,000.00 in planning and consulting costs, be conducted in such a vacuum and with complete lack of transparency.
Having worked in Senior Executive levels of both Federal and Municipal government, the approach the city has taken is
clear that the process was to approve first, then hope for the best when it cam time for community feedback and
implementation.
What do I use to base my opinion??? Economic impact study, Business owner input, Neighborhood input, Impact study
on the outliers impacted by the changes in traffic flow, especially with the design plan for Upland Road and one way
access. How could the city not address the increased traffic flow to Walden street and Linneaen street, which are packed
with children waiting for their school bus, walking to the Graham school and frequenting Raymond parkI, all which will
be impacted by the rerouting suggested. The city may assume there was transparency in the process with the "Virtual"
meetings, but the lions share of time was devoted to the city officials and contractors ((some that couldn't even figure
out how to work their powerpoint) that spewed the same misinformation and allowed little time for public discussion. I
am also really quite concerned that the public forum does not require individuals to either register prior to the
discussion, and verification of their city affiliation (residence/work/business etc.) before allowing them an opportunity
to impact the livelihood and community of those in the area impacted. I know many of the individuals from Arlington
and Somerville that called in during the virtual meetings to support these changes, without any connection to the city--except they lobbied for the Bicycle Committee.
The proposed changes, similar to the complete failure of "livable streets" that never seemed to take route, does not
represent my lack of commitment to a concept of shared streets for all, and climate change, which is desperately
needed. However, like any change it must be built from the synergy of all impacted to be sustainable. The proposal by
the city is far from achieving this goal.
I, along with my neighbors, family, residing at 230 Upland Road, and my business associates do not approve of the
proposed plan to remove the parking on Mass Ave, and the proposed changes to the traffic patterns. I support the
businesses and neighborhoods that rely on Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a plan for the city that
will Improve Safety for everyone, will help Traffic flow, preserve Parking and support Public Transportation and
Businesses. If the Bicycle Safety Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the ordinance needs to be
changed.
Please feel free to contact me if I can provide any additional clarification to my concern.

I've been following the Porter Square redesign as I live a few blocks away. While I have happily supported much of the
work being done, I have become concerned with the proposal to move metered parking to the residential side streets.
The residential side streets already do not have enough parking for residents and their personal guests, and by removing
their parking and turning them into paid parking spots you are decreasing the quality of life for the residents near Porter
Square.
Before the City Manager is allowed to make this move I believe further thought needs to be put towards this plan. I
believe there are better solutions to the problems the city faces, and this situation shows that there appears to be little
to no concern by the city for the citizens that live here.
The beginning of this lack of concern for the citizens of the city seems to be the changes being made to meet the poorly
conceived Bicycle Safety Ordinance. Both the ordinance and the plans being made to meet the requirements of the
ordinance show a clear failure to logically and systematically address the issues and balance the needs of the city. I
believe the ordinance and plans for followthrough need to be revisited, the poorly conceived requirements changed,
and the poorly conceived solutions cancelled and a better conceived solution devised.
Thanks,
Steve Adeff

City Clerk
Regarding changes to Mass Ave

Dear City Clerk

I am writing because I was unable to attend the meeting this past Tuesday. I am going to try to attend this coming Saturday but if I can
’t, I want to be on the record as adamantly opposing these changes you are making to Mass Ave.
I am deeply sympathetic to and support a more bike friendly environment. I believe in bike lanes and making it as safe as possible for
people who choose that mode of transportation.
However I do not approve of the speed with which this is being done. I attended the first meeting and people kept referring to these
changes having to be made immediately due to some up and coming deadline which didn’t frankly make a whole lot of sense to me.
When you are radically altering the way a city operates, you need to make sure that everyone is on board. Certainly compromises need
to be made but I don’t feel like that has been the process so far.
Instead, it feels like a small but strong bike lobby has pushed this through at a time when everyone was distracted by COVID. I
attended the first meeting and there were definitely voices more aligned with my perspective making their views known but I suspect
that there are many out there who want our city officials to make sure that we take the time to make sure this is done right.
After losing so many small businesses to the virus, it is heartbreaking to think about what will happen if you go through with this plan
along the remaining stretch of Mass Ave. It is disingenuous of those in favor of this restructuring to claim that it won’t make any
difference to businesses and people who shop to not be able to park near by. WALK they say! Or BIKE! That’s all fine except if you
have shopped for items that weigh a lot or require a car to move them. Sadly, we are not all in the prime of our lives and this presents a
huge hardship. And what about families with kids?
I would suggest that there be some way for bikes to share lanes with the buses. I was driving along Mass Ave in North Cambridge the
other day and the number of buses that went by was negligible. It seems crazy to devote that much space to so few vehicles. OR…
what about putting bike lanes in areas where the sidewalks are extra wide? Also, during the first meeting there was some talk about the
difficulty of saving parking due to the overhead wires. I just read that the wires are coming down so that shouldn’t be an issue.
There are many possible solutions but of one thing I am sure. Ramming this through at lightning speed is irresponsible and unfair to a
large percentage of us who do not want this…business people and citizens alike.
I would suggest going back to the drawing board and coming up with a better plan where all constituencies are considered. The world
will not explode if this isn’t done by April.

Thank you. Shellburne Thurber/ Riverside resident

City Clerk; City Council; CDDat344; Assessors; Lipson, Sam
FOR THE RECORD re: the Appropriateness of Laboratories in Neighborhood Retail
Districts (+ 271 Cambridge Street Rebuttal)

To the City Clerk, Members of the Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration
Committee, and City Council:
My name is Sharmil Modi and I am one of the owners of 271 Cambridge Street (formerly owned by the
Hastings-Tapley Insurance Company), a three-story office and lab building in East Cambridge totaling ~20,000
SF. Note: as our building received a lot of air time at last night's committee meeting, for those
interested in further details, I provide them as a postscript to my letter below. If our building is being
held up as the crux of the concern with respect to this matter, then I encourage each of you to pay us a
visit for a tour and open Q&A session; individual invitations will be forthcoming.
Let me start by thanking Councillor Carlone for initiating this important conversation and state upfront as I did
when he and I first spoke on this issue last September, I support more definition around what is and what
is not permissible under the technical office/laboratory designation, specifically as it relates to
business districts. Like all business owners and investors in this City, my partners and I value clarity,
consistency, and constancy, all of which I hope this process will finally provide, especially after having lived
and operated under this uncertainty now for almost a year. Further, I would like to say that I also believe that
large Kendall Square-style lab buildings do not belong in our retail/business districts.
However, as last night's public commentary highlighted, large Kendall Square-style lab buildings are not really
what are at issue in this discussion. As this committee and City Council debate "the appropriateness of
laboratories in neighborhood retail districts," I urge its members to consider the following:
•

What is the definition of "laboratory" and what all does it encompass? As it currently stands, laboratory
is broadly defined in the CZO under Section 4.34 ("Office and Laboratory Use"), sub-section f
("Technical office for research and development, laboratory & research facility subject to the
restrictions in Section 4.21m") and encompasses a broad variety of uses, buildings of all sizes and
scale, and perhaps most importantly, the full spectrum in terms of intensities of use. As
highlighted at the meeting last night by Jeff Roberts, this designation also includes many nonbio, "dry lab" uses such as software development, engineering, product
development/prototyping, 3D printing, and robotics. How will you define and delineate what stays
and what goes?

•

Even within "wet lab" or "bio lab," there is a full spectrum of uses, scale, and intensity. For example,
the average doctor's office, dentist's office, urgent care clinic, hospital, and high school
chemistry department - all of which have a long history of being located in neighborhood retail
and business districts in Cambridge - currently fall (or at least should fall) under the technical
office/lab designation. Would those now also be banned or restricted from the proposed areas?

•

What are the characteristics of laboratory usage that are of specific concern (e.g., light pollution, noise
pollution, odors, 24/7 deliveries, 30-foot mechanicals)? Instead of restricting a very broad category
of use, I urge the committee and Council to highlight these specific areas of nuisance/concern
and provide tighter guidelines or guardrails around those. As Sam Lipson and even Councillor
Zondervan seemed to indicate, lab use and safety is tightly regulated and overseen by the City and
State, does not pose risks for the surrounding neighborhood, and is not in and of itself a concern.

•

What will any potential changes to the zoning mean for existing properties and lab space that are no
longer conforming? As mentioned by others in the meeting, if the ability to make any future changes to
the building - even minor changes - are now to be constrained, then tenants in an existing,
grandfathered building are still likely to leave upon lease expiration, while new tenants are
unlikely to consider these buildings in the first place. In line with Councillor Toner's comments
at last night's meeting, we have invested millions of dollars to upgrade our building to
accommodate tenants/uses that were 100% allowable under the CZO as it was written at that
time.

These are just a few of the important questions and nuances that I hope this group addresses as a part of this
process.

As far as my perspective as an owner of a existing lab building (and thus arguably the most impacted
constituency by this proposed legislation), while I may be biased, personally, I believe the continued
allowance of the technical office/lab uses (with the proper aforementioned guidelines/guardrails) within
the business/retail districts is not only unharmful to neighbors, but actually a net positive for all
constituents. My argument is straightforward and supported by the economic reality my business faces at
this very moment:
•
•

•

•

•

As we all know, property prices in Cambridge are astronomically high; especially on our major
commercial thoroughfares like Cambridge Street or Massachusetts Avenue.
And yet, a key objective of all constituents (myself included) - as evidenced by the public meetings
around the Our Cambridge Street planning study - seems to be to encourage more local and
neighborhood facing retail and restaurant uses at the street level.
Unfortunately, these tenants, by their very nature, are the riskiest for property owners - especially for
those of us who have purchased our buildings more recently - to lease to. Why? Because they tend to
have little to no credit, pose the highest risk of going out of business, possess the least ability to pay,
and yet often require the highest costs to fit out.
However, if given the ability to populate our above-ground, upper floors with those tenants with the
highest ability to pay (i.e., technical office/lab tenants), it would allow us to take a chance on the street
level space and help bring the neighborhood's vision for Cambridge Street closer to reality.
Further, the presence of a strong day-time customer base upstairs increases the overall demand, and
thus likelihood of success for these street-level tenants, beyond what the surrounding residential
catchment alone can provide.

To repeat, I'm not at all suggesting that large, Kendall Square-style bio labs be allowed on Cambridge Street or
Massachusetts Avenue. However, there is no reason why small, low-intensity, lab space like ours cannot co-exist on
these thoroughfares alongside other commercial and residential uses. Stated differently, my three-story 20,000 SF
building (and that's with the basement included) on Cambridge Street, with a total of less than 5,000 SF of actual lab
space within it, is in no way comparable to a 1MM SF life science complex on Binney Street with 50,000 to 100,000 SF
floor plates, 30-foot plus mechanicals, and 24/7 operations and deliveries.
Further, I think it goes without saying that life science and technology companies are the economic lifeblood/golden
goose of Cambridge and particularly East Cambridge. While Kendall Square is synonymous with big pharma and biotech,
those same companies, along with MIT, Harvard, and the unique ecosystem of venture firms that have grown up around
them are also an unrivaled engine of new business formation, globally. However, these small, new businesses (say 5100 employees) face an acute shortage of space in Cambridge to grow. For a small firm that requires access to
technical office/lab space (e.g., 2,000 - 15,000 SF), their options are increasingly limited: hang on for as long as
possible in university space, take on a short term sublease space where they do not have any control over expansion
and renewal, find space at an incubator and pay 2-3x the market rate for shared space, or ultimately, leave Cambridge
and go to Boston, Somerville, Watertown, Waltham, Burlington, or any other place that offers them adequate
space. Instead, why not encourage these start-ups to stay in Cambridge and continue to benefit our City,
neighborhoods, and tax base instead of those in surrounding areas?

In sum, while I whole-heartedly support better identifying and mitigating specific nuisances that are of concern with
respect to technical office and lab use in retail/business districts, I believe that allowing (and even promoting) the
continued uses of technical office, light lab, and incubator spaces within our business districts will achieve the twin
community goals of promoting and fostering a vibrant, neighborhood-facing streetscape while also keeping
Cambridge on the bleeding edge of global innovation. Based on her comments at the meeting last night, I suspect that
Gayle Willett would concur.
Thank you,
Sharmil Modi

271 Cambridge Street Postscript
When we purchased the property in 2018 it was an office building whose largest tenant was the Middlesex County
Sheriff's Department. Upon their departure in early 2020, we sought to reposition the building via a
significant renovation, both to the interior and exterior of the building, the latter of which was both unanimously
approved and applauded by the Cambridge Historical Commission, the ECPT, the ECBA, and our neighbors (including at
least one that spoke in opposition at Thursday evening's meeting).
Our intention was always to keep the building as office (i.e., a cost-competitive alternative to Kendall Square) and we
presented this to the aforementioned parties and marketed it as such. However, the Covid-19 pandemic struck just
after we commenced interior demolition and our project was immediately halted. Upon restarting our construction
several months later, the only tenant that showed any significant (and unsolicited) interest was a microbiome (i.e., gut
bacteria) therapeutics company called GoodNature (by Seres Therapeutics), currently headquartered in
Cambridgeport. This is not surprising as the entire office market remains shell-shocked from the changes to working
patterns ushered in by the pandemic.
GoodNature was initially looking for ~7,500 SF of office space and as our conversations evolved, their interest in the
building grew to over 13,000 SF to include a patient/donor site in addition to the office space as well as a small amount
of lab space (again less than 5,000 SF). And naturally as GoodNature's plans changed, so did their requirements of the
building, in particular its HVAC systems and power supply.
GoodNature, which is in the business of developing therapies for gut diseases like c. difficile, ulcerative colitis, and
Crohn's disease, was interested in 271 Cambridge Street for its patient/donor facility due to the property's visible onstreet location on Cambridge Street (i.e., it is much more inviting to donors from the community than a large,
anonymous, sterile building in Kendall Square or Cambridge Crossing and much easier to go in and out of), proximity to
the Lechmere Green Line stop, and our ability to provide both on- and off-site parking. While not a retail space,
GoodNature's occupancy and use certainly makes the ground level space on the east side of the building more open to
the public than were it to be occupied by a traditional office user.
As far as the specific lab use at 271 Cambridge Street, it may help to hear directly from GoodNature re: what they do on
site:
GoodNature™ Cambridge is a new community partner committed to transforming the lives of
patients by building a dedicated donor community whose gut microbiome fuel revolutionary
therapeutics. Our state of the art facilities currently operate in Irvine, CA and our Cambridge
location will be the second of three to open in the U.S. this year.

The GoodNature facility is similar to a medical office with an in-house testing operation. Donor
community members participate in health interviews, physical exams as well as blood and stool
collections in the office. It is important to note that we do not grow or manipulate any biological
pathogen in the office. We simply collect blood and stool from donors, measure what is in it and
ship it off to a manufacturing facility.
Because we collect stool, safety cabinets (what people think of as a “hood”) have been installed
so that the collected stool can be divided into smaller containers before we ship it. The safety
cabinets protect the stool from the air and help keep our staff safe (as required by law).
Regarding specific comments and accusations that were made by two of our neighbors during last night's meeting, I
believe that several liberties were taken with the truth. Please note that both of these individuals have been invited to
meet with us to discuss their specific concerns on multiple occasions and have repeatedly either ignored or outright
rebuffed our offer. To set the record straight (both for our reputation and for the benefit of the broader discussion at
hand):
•

Rooftop Mechanicals - the "monstrous" equipment referenced at last night's meeting
are actually high-efficiency make-up air units that have been engineered for
sound attenuation and energy efficiency, hence the size (i.e., the larger, more
aerodynamic fans and coils make less noise and require less power to operate);
while they service GoodNature's aforementioned safety cabinets, they also provide
continuous fresh air to GoodNature's offices, reception area, and restrooms, and are
actually consistent with what would be used in a modern office building of this
size, especially in a post-Covid environment. This last point is an important one
and was underscored by Jeff Roberts at last night's meeting: that any
commercial building (lab or otherwise) that upgrades its HVAC to meet current
regulations and post-Covid standards will likely see a similar increase in the
size of their rooftop mechanical footprint. Note also that all the new rooftop
equipment is in accordance with Cambridge sound requirements and is actually
quieter (and more energy efficient) than the equipment that was previously on
the roof during the last 20+ years (and we are aware of zero noise complaints with
respect to the previous equipment). I will further point out that our rooftop
mechanicals top out at just under 8 feet (7'9" to be exact vs. the 30+ feet
mechanical penthouses that we are being compared to) with two exhaust stacks
(the so-called "phalluses") that top out around 12 feet (12' 4" to be exact) and
are minimally impactful as viewed from the sidewalk across Cambridge Street
(of course, if you live one street over and look out your fourth floor dormer, you will be
able to see more of the mechanicals). This is demonstrably verifiable. Finally, while
we are under no obligation from the City to do so, we are in fact evaluating ways to
further mitigate the visual impact (i.e., screening) of our rooftop mechanicals at
substantial additional cost to us (~$200K).

•

Power Upgrade - the "buried room" referenced at last night's meeting was actually the
underground duct banks (basically conduit runs encased in concrete) that Eversource
ran to feed the (above-grade) equipment necessary to meet GoodNature's power
requirements. To be clear, there is no new "room" buried on
our property. Furthermore, this work was sufficiently far enough away from,
and in no way damaged or necessitated the replacement of, the retaining wall
that was also referenced at the meeting. This is also demonstrably verifiable.

in the lives of patients who suffer with debilitating disease. The donations are the raw material of
our products, and are collected on site, but are manufactured at another location.

•

Retaining Wall - our property at 271 Cambridge Street sits ~6-10 feet above the
abuttinnig property to the north (60 Gore Street, currently owned and occupied by the
non-profit, Cambridge Family and Children's Services or "CFCS") and thus was
separated by a so-called "ancient retaining wall," with portions made of different
materials built-up at various times over the populated history of this site. This wall ran
most of the length of our property and extended ~40 feet further behind the property of
our neighbor to the east. Shortly after our acquisition of the property, we had a parked
car behind our building sink ~12 inches into the parking lot due a sink-hole that
appeared over the course of one afternoon. Upon further investigation by multiple
civil engineers, it became apparent that the wall was compromised (it was
bowed out several feet in its oldest section, had significant soil erosion/run-off
from behind and under it, and was held up by "load bearing trees" in multiple
locations) and would need to be replaced. This issue became all the more
urgent as CFCS employees regularly parked their cars right at the base of
it. Thus, as a part of our renovation, we coordinated with our neighbors and
replaced the entire wall under an emergency permit from the City and brought it
up to current engineering standards. Importantly, we did this 100% at our cost
(~$400K), thus sparing both CFCS and our residential neighbor to the east a
significant and unbudgeted cost. To be clear, we would have loved to have been
able to preserve this old wall as we derive zero benefit from having a new wall in lieu
of the old one; it was purely something we had to do for safety purposes and one for
which we are unlikely to derive a single penny of additional rent.

•

Other Nuisances - regarding the other concerns that are typically associated with lab
buildings re: traffic, deliveries, light pollution, noise, biohazards, etc., I believe we - and
most other lab buildings of our size and scale - can address each of these to your
satisfaction. In particular, I would like to highlight that there are no biological
pathogens grown, added, or manipulated, no dangerous chemicals or
gasses used or stored, and no manufacturing that occurs on this site.

If you have made it this far, I thank you. Once again, for any decision makers or influencers
(i.e., City staff) in this debate, I encourage and welcome you to visit with us at 271 Cambridge
Street to assess for yourself the actual impacts - both negative and positive - that we have had
on our neighborhood vis-a-vis the impacts that this proposed amendment would have on us and
on the good work our tenants are doing in this community.

Mass Avenue

I thought that the Cambridge city government cared about and supported local businesses but apparently I
was wrong as you plan to destroy their business by removing parking. How can you do this to them? To remove the
parking on Mass Ave will kill small businesses. I am all for improving bike lanes but not at the expense of people's
income.

Porter Square redesign: concerned citizen

Hello,
I am writing as a concerned resident; I do not approve of the proposed plan to remove the parking on Mass
Ave, and the proposed changes to the traffic patterns. I support the businesses and neighborhoods that rely on
Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a plan for the city that will Improve Safety for everyone,
will help Traffic flow, preserve Parking and support Public Transportation and Businesses. If the Bicycle Safety
Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the ordinance needs to be changed.
These proposed changes also do NOT make cycling safer in our city; I already see the result of
similar changes on Beacon Street and on Mass Ave down by Waypoint restaurant. So many cars still park on
the bike lanes, and park more dangerously than before because there is no other place to pull over.
As someone who also commutes to work, driving down Mass Ave toward Arlington in the morning has always
been a disaster, but now it is absolutely heinous. The designated bus lane only gives other car drivers a better
opportunity to speed past traffic and cut other drivers off - and there is never a cop there to pull anyone over.
Again, these changes have only made driving and cycling in our city more unbearable and more dangerous for
all.
Thank you,

Please stop and reverse the Quick Build of separate bike lanes on Mass Ave (and other
commercial corridors)

I wrote you all last month and I am writing again to reiterate that I do not approve of the proposed plan to remove the
parking on Mass Ave, and the proposed changes to the traffic patterns. I support the businesses and neighborhoods that
rely on Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a plan for the city that will Improve Safety for everyone, will
help Traffic flow, preserve Parking and support Public Transportation and Businesses. If the Bicycle Safety Ordinance will
not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the ordinance needs to be changed. And you must evaluate the impact on
the areas already altered by your current approaches.
I also want to encourage you all to step back and consider the following.

If the Cambridge Police Department incident database is accurate, Mass Ave north of Harvard Square has
never been the location where accidents involving bicycles are most frequent. Even if it were, it is illogical
to suggest that separate bike lanes will cure the problem if the lane structures do not change behaviors at
intersections. How will separate bike lanes encourage cyclists to stop at signals or stop signs, or to be
more cautious when crossing intersections? On a recent walk from my residence on Mt Vernon to visit
friends on Oxford Street (a sunny Saturday afternoon, total walk time about 10 minutes) I saw no less than
a dozen cyclists fail to observe signals or fail to yield to pedestrians.
An obvious solution to make Mass Ave safer for all and to not degrade the prospects for successful
commerce would be to eliminate bike travel on Mass Ave, not encourage more. But if you’re going to
encourage more, why is that? Is it because you think cyclists will flock to the commercial areas and
replace shoppers and visitors who travel by motor vehicles? Dream on. But, if that’s the goal, where are
you adding parking for bicycles?
Finally, in walking around the other day I was really struck by how much more Cambridge (like most of
metro Boston) really resembles a suburb more than a city. In that light, one sees that population density
is rather low, and that viable commercial districts must include convenient parking, as must residential
areas (so that residents may travel, commute, shop, and accomodate vistiors and service
providers). Again, Car-free Cambridge? Dream on. Until the day when Mass Ave is entirely abutted by
large, multi-story apartment buildings at least 3 or 4 blocks deep, along it's entire length, population
density will never be sufficient to provide a customer base in reasonable walking (or biking) distance to
sustain a comprehensive set of goods and service providers that are convenient to and desired by most
current or future residents.
Obviously, my thinking not in line with that driving the BSO parameters or Traffic Dept interpretation of
feasible implementation. But if you are hell-bent on proceeding according to current plans, it is not
unreasonable to conclude that your desire is to turn Cambridge’s commercial corridors into deserts and to
degrade the quality of life for the majority of Cambridge residents.

Porter Square Quick Build Bike Lanes

Good Afternoon,
My name is Mark DerKazarian. I am a dentist practicing at 1692 Massachusetts Avenue in my own
private specialty practice and I also am a co-owner of Dental Services PC, which is a full service
dental clinic at 1696 Massachusetts Avenue. The buildings also house another dental office, an
Edward Jones branch as well as a group of clinical mental health therapists.
All of these businesses rely on the ability for clients/patients to be able to access our location. This
includes public transportation, walking/bicycle AND automobiles. The current city plan to remove
parking on Massachusetts Avenue is short sighted and, frankly, a potential death blow to many of the
small businesses along Mass Ave (mine included). As a dentist performing surgery, many of my
patients are objectively unable to walk or ride a bike home and need the use of a private automobile
to get the proper care and treatment.
I hope a sensible solution this problem can be reached, for the sake of all involved (pedestrians,
bicyclists, residents and business owners).
Thank you,
Mark DerKazarian DMD

On Porter Square Redesigned and the Biker Lobby

I am writing as a concerned resident of Cambridge on the plan to modify Porter Square in favor of bike lanes.
I do not approve of the proposed plan to remove the parking on Mass Ave, and the proposed changes to the traffic
patterns. I support the businesses and neighborhoods that rely on Mass Ave as a major roadway for our city. We need a
plan for the city that will Improve Safety for everyone, will help Traffic flow, preserve Parking and support Public
Transportation and Businesses. If the Bicycle Safety Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the
ordinance needs to be changed.
Moreover, said ordinance does not require bikers to behave responsibly, respect traffic lights installed for them at the
expense of all citizens. I have been nearly run over twice in this past year by bikers who do not respect traffic lights, and
blaming me for their recklessness.
The biking population is one group being benefitted to the disadvantage of all those unable to bike. I agree with the
need of safety but said safety is needed for all citizens, not just bikers. If we truly want to decongest Cambridge, we

Dear Council Members:
I'd like to register my opposition to approving the extra curb cut for the private use of this project removing it
from public use by the community living in the neighborhood and people attending the Kingdom
Empowerment Center.
The elderly, for one group, in Cambridge are losing more and more parking spaces that allow them to remain
engaged in the life of the community and to have care givers and visitors reach them.
Thank you,

To Cambridge City Councilors,
I think the City Council should vote « no » on the developer’s application for a second curb cut at the property at 221
Columbia Street. I see nothing good for the neighborhood and the city in the tearing down if an 1856 house. I think it is
urgent that the neighbors have more time to consider the second curb cut, which would be on Market St.
Vote « no » on APP 2022 #12 today.
Thank You.

Dear City Official,
Hello. My name is Debra Wood and I run Acupuncture Wellness at 1798 Mass Ave, Porter Sq.
Please do not remove accessible short-term parking. My business depends on it. Please do not shorten remaining
parking meters to 30 minutes. This will be the same as removing all parking.
Please support small businesses.
We need a plan for the city that will improve safety for everyone, will improve traffic flow, preserve parking, support
public transportation and restore the city's relationship with you - their elected official.
If the Bicycle Safety Ordinance will not allow for a plan that meets those goals, the ordinance needs to change.
Don't you think?
You may not even be aware of the type of work I do in service of our community. Please respond if you would like to
pay my clinic a visit.
Please respond if you read this.
Sincerely,
Debra Wood, Lic Ac

NO TO PROPOSED CHANGES TO UPPER MASS AVE!!

Dear City Manager, City Mayor, Cambridge City Councilors, and other City Officials:

I am writing as a very frustrated Cambridge resident who lives near Porter Square.

I do NOT approve of the proposed plan to remove the parking on Mass Ave, and the proposed changes to the traffic
patterns. I am a shopper at and a supporter of the businesses that rely on Mass Ave – and that make Porter
Square/North Cambridge unique.

Despite being an avid cyclist, I do NOT support the Bicycle Safety Ordinance as it currently stands and I oppose the
constant rollout of such arbitrary plans. Shared Streets was an example of a failed initiative that led only to
disorientation on the part of cyclists, walkers, and drivers. The Mass Ave Bus Lane recently implemented also seems to
lead only to confusion, danger, and more clogged streets – and never have I seen an actual MBTA bus in the bus lane!!

PLEASE listen to the long-time residents and taxpayers!! STOP rolling out ill-conceived plans that cause all sorts of
pedestrian, cyclist, and traffic confusion and hurt our businesses!

Regards,

Anne Holtzworth

The city and community have already put in many years of discussion,
research, planning, and rezoning through the Alewife Revitalization Plan of

of the current Concord Alewife Overlay District Zoning by the City Council in

WHEREAS:

Outdoor swimming pools in Cambridge are typically open from mid-June through
Labor Day, but residents have long desired an expanded outdoor swimming season;
and

WHEREAS:

June 2021 was the warmest June in recorded history, September 2021 was the fifthwarmest September on record, and nine of the ten warmest Septembers on record have
occurred in the past decade; and

WHEREAS:

Staff have explained that a shortage of lifeguards largely caused by the unavailability
of college students at both ends of the season is the primary reason why outdoor
swimming cannot be extended; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council is committed to figuring out a sustainable solution to this quandary
so that residents of all ages have access to an affordable and safe way to cool off and
recreate during the entire period of seasonable weather each year; and

WHEREAS:

In addition to passing a rigorous swim test, prospective applicants for this important
role must be at least 16 years old and hold current certification in lifeguarding and
CPR/CFR from the American Red Cross; and

WHEREAS:

Skilled applicants who lack proper certification must pay out of pocket for the required
courses in order to work for the City of Cambridge in this capacity, which can cost as
much as $400 and may not be conveniently accessible; and

WHEREAS:

Establishing a workforce development program to offer free certification and
recertification courses throughout the year would eliminate some existing barriers,
increase the number of qualified applicants for the position, and expand economic
opportunity for young people; and

WHEREAS:

The American Red Cross requires lifeguarding students to be “at least 15 years old by
the last day of class” in order to participate in training programs that lead to required
certifications, including through Licensed Training Providers and Authorized
Providers; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the appropriate city
departments and the American Red Cross to establish a workforce development
program for lifeguarding in Cambridge that includes free certification and
recertification courses throughout the year for anyone who can pass the swim test; and

WHEREAS:

Idling of vehicles is known to be harmful to public health and contribute to the climate
crisis; and

WHEREAS:

At the start and end of the school day, cars often fill the streets near Buckingham
Browne & Nichols (BB&N) school, an independent school situated in a residential
area near Buckingham Street, Buckingham Place, Parker Street, and Craigie Street
with parents waiting to drop off or pick up their children; and

WHEREAS:

Neighbors who reside in this area have noted several issues, including idling beyond
the five-minute legal limit, stalled traffic, blocked driveways, and a forced one-way
path up Buckingham Street toward Concord where drivers face the risk of coming
head-to-head with a vehicle trying to bypass the pickup line; and

WHEREAS:

Neighbors have long advocated to the City Council for a solution to this issue that
would end long lines of idling cars and provide benefits such as fewer greenhouse gas
emissions, more foot traffic, improved health for those in the area, and less stress for
both neighbors and drivers; and

WHEREAS:

The City’s police and traffic and parking departments have worked to alleviate the
idling which has had some limited success, but a more permanent solution needs to be
developed; and

WHEREAS:

BB&N is planning some major changes to its campus, such as removing two buildings,
constructing a new one in another part of the campus, and making renovations in the
present buildings, which lends to possible internal drive-through solutions, as stated in
previous neighborhood communications; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the appropriate City
departments and staff of the BB&N school to provide a solution to this issue, such as a
tiered drop-off system, a parking area for parents, or more drop-off and pick-up
locations; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager report back to the City Council no later than May 1, 2022.

WHEREAS:

The use of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, continues to grow rapidly across the United
States year after year as the electric motor used on these bicycles expands accessibility
of biking to new audiences - particularly seniors, people with disabilities and people
traveling with children or large loads; and

WHEREAS:

E-bikes are shown to reduce dependence on single occupancy vehicles, reduce overall
vehicle miles traveled, and lower aggregate carbon emissions in the transportation
sector; and

WHEREAS:

Under Massachusetts state law there is no legal designation for e-bike riders, leaving
ambiguity in where people are allowed to ride electric bicycles, ultimately preventing
their use in bikeshare systems; and

WHEREAS:

Incorporating e-bikes in the BlueBikes system would make it more equitable and
reliable, particularly in low-income communities that could rely on it as another mode
of public transportation; and

WHEREAS:

Several other major US cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago,
Philadelphia, Seattle and Los Angeles, have introduced e-bikes in their respective
bikeshare systems with great success; and

WHEREAS:

There is proposed legislation on the state level in Massachusetts that would grant ebikes the legal classification necessary for implementing them in BlueBikes
municipalities, including Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

H.3457/SD.2309, An Act Relative to Electric Bicycles, submitted by State
Representatives Dylan Fernandes and Steven Owens and State Senator Sal
DiDomenico would:
• Define e-bikes under three different categories based on power, top speed, and
method of electric assist (pedal vs throttle)
• Grant e-bike riders the same rights, privileges and duties afforded to other
bicyclists
• Ensure that a municipality, local authority or state agency having jurisdiction
over a bike path or shared-use path may prohibit the operation of class 1, class
2, or class 3 electric bicycles on that path if they choose to do so; now
therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record supporting H.3457/SD.2309 in the 192nd Session
of the Massachusetts General Court.

Dear City Council colleagues,
I am pleased to share the following updates on the City Manager search. We have since moved on from
the community engagement portion of the search timeline, which culminated in the creation of the
leadership profile, or job description. (As discussed at last week's Government Operations meeting, we
have made a slight adjustment to the timeline, but are still on track to complete our search by mid June.)
During the month of February we received community and employee feedback through:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Employee Town Hall
Employee Survey
Department Head Meetings with Randi Frank
15 minute Employee drop-in sessions with Randi Frank
Resident Town Hall
20 focus groups through Cortico
Over 4,000 unique pieces of feedback from 700+ residents and stakeholders on the
coUrbanize site

A first draft of the leadership profile was presented to the (gov ops committee members?) and public at
the March 2nd Government Operations, Rules, and Claims committee meeting, where committee
members suggested feedback and edits. To allow enough time for these edits to be made, a follow-up
committee meeting was scheduled for March 9th and the final leadership profile was presented and
approved. This editing process ultimately moved the timeline back by one week, but we are currently in
the process of recruiting applicants with the profile. To capture a wide variety of applicants, both with
traditional and non-traditional experience, Randi Frank LLC is distributing the leadership profile to a
wide array of organizations around the country and world. For a complete list, click here.
While Randi Frank and her team receive applications, we need to identify an Initial Screening Committee
to review candidates during the first round of interviews. The (Initial) Screening Committee will be made
up of 15-19 individuals who are interested in playing yet another vital role in the City Manager search
process, and ultimately help decide who moves on as a finalist. For those who need it, financial
assistance, language translation (ESOL/ASL), and a brief interview skills workshop will all be available
through our search partner, Randi Frank LLC. Those who are interested will need to be available from
9am – 5pm on the following dates:

OUR
COMMUNITY
Cambridge is a unique urban community with a vibrant mix of culture, social, and
economic diversity. As a rapidly growing city with a diverse population, Cambridge
is a hub of innovation and opportunity, with over 80 languages spoken by students
in the public schools.
With 118,403 residents counted in the 2020 census, an increase of 12.6% since 2010,
Cambridge is the fourth largest city in the Commonwealth and the second most
densely populated with 18,529 persons per square mile. The 2015 - 2019 American
Community Survey found that 66.1% of Cambridge residents identify as White,
10.7% as Black, 16.8% as Asian or Pacific Islander, 9.5% as Hispanic, and 6.4%
identified another race or a member of two or more races. Approximately 34% of
residents’ home language is a language other than English. Cambridge is also an
economically stratified city and becoming more so; a 2021 report showed that
residents in the top quintile earn on average $343,000 each year, while the bottom
quintile earn an average of $13,000. Additionally, 41% of the children in the
Cambridge public schools were eligible for free or reduced lunches in 2021.
As a dense city with 13 distinct neighborhoods, Cambridge has an intimate,
personable feel and the city has worked to prioritize connectivity. Public transit
includes six subway stations, one commuter rail stop, and 29 bus routes.
Cambridge is also home to a variety of green spaces, with over 5 miles bordering
the Charles River, a 50-acre park built on top of a former landfill, a 9-hole public
golf course, and its own reservoir. Cambridge is a walkable city and currently
undergoing an expansion of its protected bike network.
Home to Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lesley
University, and an increasing number of research laboratories and incubator
facilities, Cambridge is one of the world's most important biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, and high-tech hubs. The biotech corridor in Kendall Square has
been called “the most innovative square mile on Earth,” and has led the country in
everything from the invention of rubber hoses to the development of a Covid-19
vaccine. With hundreds of start ups and dozens of global tech leaders, Cambridge
attracts the brightest minds and ideas. Furthermore, unique business districts and
associations help to represent and grow the small business community that
thrives in Cambridge.

GOVERNMENT
STRUCTURE
The City of Cambridge has a Council-Manager form of government as
detailed by its Plan E Charter. Under the Plan E Charter, the City Council
serves as the City’s legislative body made up of 9 members, including a
Mayor and Vice Mayor who are directly elected by their City Council
colleagues.
The City Council is responsible for hiring a City Manager with the expertise
to oversee and direct the day-to-day activities of the City within broad
functional areas including Finance, Public Safety, Human Services,
Community Development, Traffic and Parking, Public Works, and more. The
City Manager provides leadership on all of the City’s strategic initiatives
including equity and inclusion, economic development, redevelopment,
and organizational improvement. The City Manager is responsible for
hiring, removing and overseeing all City employees (with the exception of
School Department employees). The City Manager serves as a liaison and
financial officer to the City schools (Elementary, Upper and High Schools
are a department of the City, however, they are overseen by an elected
School Committee and appointed superintendent). In addition to the City
Manager, the City Council hires the City Auditor and the City Clerk.
Under the November 2, 2021 voter-approved charter amendments, all
appointments to Boards and Commissions made by the City Manager must
be approved by the City Council, the City Council must conduct an annual
evaluation of the City Manager, and the City Council will appoint a Charter
Review Commission by July 2022 to review the current Charter (a standard
practice for municipalities across Massachusetts that Cambridge has not
done since 1940).

The City of Cambridge has an annual budget that
confirms its vast financial resources of close to
$750 million dollars annually (not including
Capital Budget items). The infographic to the left
describes the breakdown of that annual funding
for Fiscal Year 2022. The full adopted budget for
FY22 is here.

The City of Cambridge provides all the traditional
municipal services such as Police, Fire, Public
Works, Community Development, Human
Services and more. Cambridge currently employs
over 1600 full time employees, and serves a
diverse constituency. The City Manager needs to
embrace the diverse community and personally
interact with all segments and understand their
needs.

ARPA Funding & AAA Bond Rating
Cambridge received over $88 million dollars in
American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, and is
currently in the midst of a public process to
determine how best to allocate these one-time
funds. There is a tremendous opportunity for the
next City Manager to work with the City Council
and the community to target this funding to
address the challenges and opportunities
identified through this community engagement
process.
There is also a desire from many stakeholders to
use the city’s AAA bond rating and surplus funds
to provide expanded services and programs
while being mindful of the need to maintain
Cambridge’s financial integrity.

CAMBRIDGE ANTI-RACISM, EQUITY, AND
INCLUSION POLICY

Attachment: 2022cambridgecitymanagerleadershipprofile_final-2 (COF 2022 #30 : A communication was received from Vice Mayor Mallon,

CAMBRIDGE CITY MANAGER

The Cambridge Anti-Racism, Equity and Inclusion Initiative is directed from the City Manager’s Office
and has a committee of employees that meets regularly. This initiative is more than just words,
it’s a philosophy that guides the staff and all services provided by the City. These diversity efforts
were started in 2017 and have continued to grow. The City has conducted skill-building and
development of all City employees to cultivate an environment which reflects values of antiracism, equity and inclusion. This effort has focused on a review of all City policies to ensure they
are aligned with the purpose of equity and inclusion. It is also focused on recruitment, hiring,
retention, succession planning and promotion practices that incorporate anti-racism, equity and
inclusion. All of this has provided a commitment by City leaders, managers, and employees to
lead a thriving diverse workforce that is anti-racist, equitable, and inclusive. In a recent survey,
over 50% of employees report that it’s important the new City Manager must “demonstrate a
commitment to, and an accomplished record of, anti-racism, diversity and inclusion.”
The committee members of this initiative are ready to assist the new City Manager to continue
and deepen this effort.

WE LISTENED TO OUR RESIDENTS & STAKEHOLDERS

Listen to the focus groups here, and see the over 4,000 unique pieces of feedback received by Cambridge
residents and stakeholders here.

The following are some examples of direct quotes from residents and stakeholders who participated in the
community engagement process. All views are based on personal experience and reflect the individual respondent.
“If you get the best and the
brightest and people are excited
and engaged and feel like they
are empowered to make change
that’s responsive to the
community. I think creating
a really good culture is really
important... a more responsive
culture that’s engaged and
excited for the opportunity to
make the city a better place.”
-Rachel

“I’m hoping that the city
manager will hear my voice. It’s
important that seniors, who are
homeowners get a chance to be
heard, that we need help, that
we need a group, or an agency,
or a program, that if something
should happen, there’s an
agency we can call ”
-Pearl

“We need someone progressive
and policy oriented, someone
with a vision for how the city
needs to change to adapt to the
challenges of the next couple
decades. Between climate change
and the housing crisis, Cambridge
cannot and will not look the same
a decade from now, and the City
Manager needs to be someone
actively interested in driving that
change”
-Aaron

“The number one priority should
be housing. If you can’t afford to
live here, it doesn’t matter much
to you what the second priority
is, because you won’t be here to
benefit from it.”
-Jess

“I would like to see a city
manager who is a synthetic
thinker. In other words,
somebody who can take
multiple perspectives and pull
them together into a final
decision and somebody who
can execute. Somebody who
has expertise operationally,
who can execute amongst the
myriad of departments that
exist in Cambridge.”
-Steve

“The next City Manager should
have a vision that makes
Cambridge a leader in policy,
rather than following trends.
They should be extremely
progressive and dedicated to
upzoning, building housing, and
safer, more inclusive streets.”
-Kevin

“There’s the practical issue of
limited opportunities for a city
that is so well-known across
the nation. We attract from
outside, but what about those
that are right here within the
city? What can be done to
broaden the educational skills,
internships, mentorships, so
that our own children and
teenagers, young adults, can
have greater access to what is
in their backyard?”
-Marilyn

“I think in Cambridge, we can
get sidetracked with all the
noise that’s out there. I think
it’s very important to stay very
focused and to take new
approaches to doing things”
-Peter

“I would hope that the new City
Manager could consider all points
of view. How do we reach the City
Manager? How do we make
change? I’d like them to try to
reach out more to the residents”

"I’d like to see a City Manager who
has a vision that extends beyond

money is not an end in itself. Too

different ways, through
gentrification, and
overdevelopment, loss of open
space, and many other things in
order to have a too conservative
approach to protecting the City
Finances. I think the finances can

it's not 100% amazing out of the

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
The City of Cambridge, while prosperous, grapples with similar urban challenges as its larger peers. The
successful candidate will be prepared to take fresh approaches and to leverage the City’s resources to
effectively address these challenges. Access to housing, especially affordable housing, is the number one
concern among residents and has proven to be a consistent challenge over the past decade as Cambridge
continues to attract young professionals, students, and families. Both market-rate, and below-market rate
housing stock are under insurmountable pressure, evidenced by the rapidly rising rents and the over 20,000
individuals (6,530 with a Cambridge preference or Veteran status) on the Cambridge Housing Authority’s
“Can’t Wait List.” The City Manager will need to look to creative and unconventional methods to address the
current housing crisis and Cambridge’s stratified economic makeup. Balancing the tension between
development, tax revenues, jobs, and housing will be critical.

Attachment: 2022cambridgecitymanagerleadershipprofile_final-2 (COF 2022 #30 : A communication was received from Vice Mayor Mallon,

CAMBRIDGE CITY MANAGER

The next City Manager must understand the importance and urgency of the climate crisis and embrace the
challenge of making Cambridge a climate leader. While Cambridge has taken steps to reduce local emissions
and build climate resilience, citywide emissions have increased and projections show Cambridge will miss its
internal 2030 climate goals.

Cambridge has long been a pioneer in alternative transportation methods that seek to alleviate congestion
and environmental impact. The City has installed electric vehicle charging stations, partnered with the MBTA
and the City of Somerville on the Green Line Extension Program, and committed to building 26.2 miles of
protected bike lane infrastructure by 2026. The City Manager must find a way to successfully introduce and
implement much-needed climate-friendly transportation infrastructure while listening to all stakeholders,
including the disability community, residents with limited mobility, seniors, and business owners.

THE NEXT CITY MANAGER WILL :

Communicate equitably with constituents and engage with all stakeholders equally
Address the connectivity gap and respond to the City Council request to complete a municipal
broadband study
Implement Universal Pre-Kindergarten
Promote small and diverse businesses for economic stability and support a strong post
COVID19 return of Cambridge businesses of all sizes
Work with an active and committed Arts and non-profit community to develop a deeper
understanding of collaborative goal setting to meet service needs and understand how arts
and non-profit groups enhance the community's quality of life.
Address social justice with community and police with alternative methods to respond to nonlaw enforcement calls for service (such as mental health, unhoused, language barriers)
Prioritize opportunities for additional, needed open space in the City
Manage and maintain a large per capita municipal budget, and leverage the City’s AAA bond
rating to provide expanded services and programs

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, March 15, the School Committee held its Regular Meeting. At this meeting, we heard an
update from Dr. Greer and from members of the Health, Safety, and Facilities Group. The presentation
laid out goals, and recommended changes to current policies around 1) Guest access & parent meetings,
2) Before/after school events, 3) In school staff & student events, 4) Spectators/audiences, 5) Field trips,
and 5) Meals/snacks. We also heard from the Director of ELL and Bilingual Programs, Beth Kirshner. At
Cambridge Public Schools, there are 75+ Home languages and 40+ Countries represented. About 30% of
students have a home language other than English, and there are multilingual learners in all schools and
all grade levels in CPS. The top languages: Amharic, Arabic, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Bengali/Bangla,
Chinese. In our dual language immersion programs, there are 78 Students in the Ola Program, JK-5, 100
students in Chinese Immersion Program, JK-5, and 406 students in Amigos JK-8. School Committee
members expressed interest in expanding the dual immersion programs. The full presentation can be
found here. There is a March 17 Special meeting to review the Superintendent's FY23 Proposed Budget
and ESSER III Plan. We will also have a presentation of the FY23 Budget on Tuesday, March 22, 6pm
FY23 Budget Workshop and a Thursday, March 24, 6pm Public Hearing on the FY23 Budget.
The Mayor’s Office is holding a creative art contest this month in honor of Women’s History Month for
all students in 6th to 8th grade. We will choose three winners who submitted visual or written artwork
with the artist’s interpretation of the Women’s History Month theme. Each winner will receive a gift card
and an invitation to meet with Mayor Siddiqui for a show-and-tell! The winning three submissions will be
displayed at City Hall, and all submissions will get a chance to be displayed in the city’s Main Library.

Submissions are now open, and we will be accepting submissions through March 28th. Submissions can
be sent to Subu Karmacharya, our Community Outreach Manager, at skarmacharya@cambridgema.gov.
CRLS has been selected as the recipient of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association’s
(MIAA) District 4 Sportsmanship Award! CRLS was selected for this honor by the schools we compete
with, and we are incredibly proud of our students, coaches, and entire staff for how they represent CRLS,
CPS, and our City and emphasize sportsmanship on and off the field. The award will be presented on
Friday, March 25 at the Annual MIAA Sportsmanship Summit at Gillette Stadium.
Finally, I am excited to report that CRLS was one of four schools designated as “Early College” this week
by the Board of Education. This designation will allow for students to more easily earn college credits
while attending CRLS, which has been shown to have a huge impact on continuing education and college
graduation rates. This designation follows the successful start of the Early College Pilot earlier this year.
My office worked closely with Lesley University, School Committee Member Fantini, and the District to
get this Pilot underway and the initial feedback has been promising.
Respectfully,

Mayor Siddiqui
