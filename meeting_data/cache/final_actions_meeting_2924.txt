Variance: The CHA is requesting to amend Putnam School's existing Variance (Case No. 4817) to increase
the number of dwelling units, increase the Floor Area Ratio (“FAR”), decrease Lot Area for Each Dwelling

the proposed renovations at Putnam School, which include reconfiguring 9 congregate units to 7 onebedroom units and 1 two-bedroom unit and converting unproductive common space to provide 2 onebedroom units and to expand 1 one-bedroom unit into a two-bedroom unit. At the end of the renovation, the
unit mix will consist of 32 one-bedrooms and 2 two-bedrooms for a total of 34 dwelling units with a net add of
3 bedrooms (currently, there are 24 one-bedrooms and 3 congregate units for a total of 27 dwelling units but
