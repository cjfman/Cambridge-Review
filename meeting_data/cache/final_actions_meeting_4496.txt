The Cambridge office market continues to feel the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic which is
still impacting companies’ ability to increase occupancy and fully utilize their office space as
employees continue to prioritize hybrid work schedules. The office market has historically been
one of the tightest in the country with an average vacancy rate of 5.4% from 2011 through 2019
and an average sublease rate of 2.6% during that same time period. The office market in
Cambridge ended 2023 with a vacancy rate of 12.8% and a sublease rate of 9.1%, which is the
highest across all of Greater Boston for major markets. Cambridge isn’t just home to the most
innovative life science and big pharma users in the country, but it is also home to the most
advanced artificial intelligence, engineering and technology titans mainly domiciled in Kendall
Square. The utilization of AI has exploded not just in the tech industry but biotech’s are using AI
to target diseases and develop therapeutics. With all of that said, the current market conditions
are proof that even a city like Cambridge, known as an epicenter for innovation, is not immune
to the macro-economic environment or the impact that the Covid pandemic had on the broader
work from home movement and the slowdown in technology hiring.
The Cambridge vacancy rate increased 30 basis points (bps) since last quarter and is up 220
bps since the end of last year. Availability has seen a steep increase as well, up 400 basis points

Cambridge’s office market saw close to 500,000 sq. ft. of negative absorption in the quarter,
bringing the 2023 total to over 820,000 sq. ft. of negative absorption. Asking rents saw a slight
artificial increase, up to $79.43 per sq. ft. gross due to the higher quality, direct space that
became available at One Memorial Drive. Asking rents are down 8.1% from their peak at the end
of the first quarter last year. Although asking rents haven’t seen as steep a decrease as Class A
and B downtown Boston office product, an increase in concessions being offered by landlords in
the form of free rent and TI dollars is an attempt by owners to increase tour velocity and
transaction count. These concessions are affecting the net effective rent, but are not yet
impacting quoted asking rents.
Demand for office space has remained subdued across the entire urban market and Cambridge
is no exception. At the end of 2019, there was over 1.25 million sq. ft. of office demand, but that
number has decreased by more than 70% and ended the year at 360,000 sq. ft. Demand from
technology companies has contracted by over 85%. Tech companies were the main driver of the
demand in 2019, but today biotech firms are the main source of office demand in Cambridge.
The sublease rate in Cambridge increased 200 bps since last quarter, reaching 9.1%, but is still
down from its peak in the first quarter of 2023 when it reached 9.9%. Along with Biogen’s new
sublease, several other subleases became available throughout the quarter in excess of 45,000
sq. ft, including the addition of 60,000 sq. ft. from Microsoft. In total nine companies in
Cambridge are looking to sublease at least 45,000 sq. ft. Of the available sublease space in
Cambridge, 80% is concentrated within East Cambridge which is home to 74% of the overall
office inventory in the city.
East Cambridge recorded nearly 568,000 sq. ft. of negative absorption in Q4. This caused
availability to increase 620 bps to 25.8%, while vacancy increased 100 bps to 13.0%. Asking
rents in the prime submarket of East Cambridge saw a slight increase, ending the year at $85.57
per sq. ft. gross. Leasing activity in East Cambridge remained muted as many companies closely
monitor where office utilization trends will shake out and remain vigilant regarding conserving
capital in these uncertain economic times, similar to the behavior seen amongst lab users in and
around Kendall Square.

since last quarter. Intersystems made their long-awaited move to One Congress in Boston’s
Central Business District leaving behind nearly 240,000 sq. ft. of available space at their former
home at One Memorial Drive. Biogen continues to re-evaluate their real estate needs in an effort
to cut costs by subleasing additional office space at their corporate headquarters at 225 Binney.

Market Area Overview
Definitions
AVERAGE ASKING LEASE RATE: Rate determined by multiplying the asking gross lease rate for each building by
its available space, summing the products, then dividing by the sum of the available space with net leases for all
buildings in the summary. GROSS LEASES: Includes all lease types whereby the tenant pays an agreed rent plus
estimated average monthly costs of the operating expenses and taxes for the property, including utilities, insurance
and/or maintenance expenses.NET ABSORPTION: The change in available sq. ft. from one period to the next, as
measured by available sq. ft. NET RENTABLE AREA: The gross building square footage minus the elevator core,
flues, pipe shafts, vertical ducts, balconies and stairwell areas. OCCUPIED AREA (SQ. FT.): Building area not
considered vacant. UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Buildings that have begun construction as evidenced by site
excavation or foundation work. AVAILABLE AREA (SQ. FT.): Available building area that is either physically vacant
or occupied. This includes future availability in actively under construction properties. AVAILABILITY RATE:
Available sq. ft. divided by the net rentable area. VACANT AREA (SQ. FT.): Existing building area that is physically
vacant or immediately available. VACANCY RATE: Vacant building feet divided by the net rentable area.
NORMALIZATION: Due to a reclassification of the market, the base, number and square footage of buildings of
previous quarters have been adjusted to match the current base. Availability and vacancy figures for those buildings
have been adjusted in previous quarters.

Survey Criteria
Includes all competitive buildings in CBRE’s survey set for the Cambridge Office Market.
