Update on Discussions of Allowing Multifamily Housing Citywide

To the Honorable, the City Council,
Since January, 2022, the Planning Board has held three discussions on the topic of allowing
multifamily housing in all zoning districts of Cambridge. These discussions were initiated by a
City Council request made on November 16, 2021, for “CDD to work with the Planning Board to
develop concepts and principles to eliminate single family and two family only zones in the City
of Cambridge, and to report back to the City Council as soon as practicable.”
Over the course of these discussions, staff from the Community Development Department
(CDD) presented information about Cambridge’s current zoning requirements and the specific
ways in which those requirements prevent multifamily housing in different parts of the city.
CDD also presented information about the issues and goals articulated in the Envision
Cambridge comprehensive plan and how they relate to the subject of restrictive single-family
and two-family zoning districts.
After the most recent discussion, the Board voted to send a report to the City Council with an
update on its process so far and a request for further guidance from the Council on the intended
policy goals and outcomes of a zoning change that would eliminate single and two-family only
zoning and permit multifamily housing citywide.
Below is an update on the Board’s discussion to date.
Zoning Principles
The Board’s discussion raised several important planning issues, which highlight the need for
clear policy guidance in order to evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of different zoning strategies.
They reflect the range of viewpoints expressed by Board members.
•

Zoning should allow for an equitable range of housing types and unit sizes in all
residential districts. In other words, some neighborhoods should not be exclusively
limited to large, single-family and two-family homes while other neighborhoods allow
more variety in housing types. There is no compelling reason to prohibit multifamily
housing and townhouses throughout the city.

PLANNING BOARD

•

More housing opportunities could be created in restrictive zoning districts, which
currently do not support as much housing as other neighborhoods of the city. New
housing opportunities in residential neighborhoods should be viewed in the context of the
City’s overall strategy for housing growth, as articulated in Envision Cambridge.

•

Residential neighborhoods should have open space for children and families, as well as
tree canopy and other features that have a larger environmental benefit to the public as
well as residents. However, that should not necessarily be a justification to oppose the
creation of any new housing opportunities.

•

Neighborhood streets should not be overburdened with parking. Although there is a
desire to plan for a future that is less reliant on private automobile use, the impacts on
public resources, including on-street parking, need to be considered.

•

Housing costs are a major concern. Some Board members noted that new market-rate
housing units are likely to be very expensive and accessible only to wealthier households,
and that a change to allow multifamily housing throughout the City, in isolation, would
not produce new affordable housing units. Other Board members noted that housing is
already expensive, whether it is existing or new, and that retaining the current restrictive
zoning in some neighborhoods would result in fewer units that will still be out of reach to
all but the wealthiest households. Board members also acknowledged that demand for
housing has led to increased property values, placing pressure on longtime residents.

•

Opportunities to create affordable housing are desired. Changes to zoning should be
carefully assessed for how they might affect the viability of opportunities pursued under
the Affordable Housing Overlay.

•

It is worthwhile to identify and preserve building exteriors that contribute positively to
the architectural character of a neighborhood. However, there can be flexibility to make
changes within the interiors of buildings and develop complementary infill.

Concepts for Amending Zoning
Board members agreed that in order to enable multifamily housing citywide, it would be
necessary both to increase the allowed range of housing types in Residence A-1, A-2, and B
districts, and to amend the “minimum lot area per dwelling unit” requirements which currently
limit housing in those districts to fewer, larger-sized units.
•

Allowing More Housing Types: There is broad support for allowing multifamily and
townhouse development in Residence A-1, A-2, and B districts. Planning Board members
discussed the following specific options:
o Allow the same range of uses as in Residence C and C-1 districts. These would
include multifamily, townhouse, and some group housing such as elderly
congregate housing and lodging houses. Board members had differing views on

whether to allow group housing, noting that they can provide more affordable
alternative housing options, but can also have parking impacts.
o Allow a broader range of uses, but with limitations on building size. This would
allow for additional unit types while keeping building sizes consistent with the
prevailing neighborhood patterns.
o Allow multiple buildings on a lot. Currently, only a single principal building is
allowed per lot in Residence A-1 and A-2 districts, and there are some limitations
on detached buildings on a lot in Residence B. Allowing more flexibility would
allow for different building and site development options that could be tailored to
different sites.
•

Recalibrating Unit Density: Residence A-1, A-2, and B districts have higher ratios of
allowed floor area to allowed number of units than other zoning districts. There is broad
support for changing the limitations so that more units could be allowed in those districts
within the same amount of floor area. Planning Board members discussed the following
specific options:
o Reduce the minimum lot area per dwelling unit in those districts so that, when
combined with floor area ratio (FAR) limitations in that district, it results in a
consistent average unit size across neighborhoods. Some Board members
suggested that an average Gross Floor Area per dwelling unit of 1,200 square feet
could be a consistent standard across neighborhoods.
o Instead of lot area per dwelling unit limitations, rely on other limitations such as
allowed building types (such as three-unit, four-unit, six-unit buildings) without
specific limitations on unit density.

Board members discussed other zoning requirements that could be changed, but would likely
require more extensive study that could delay the implementation of the immediate objective of
allowing multifamily housing citywide.
•

Parking: The requirement to provide parking affects the feasibility of housing
production, but also impacts the availability of public on-street parking. Board members
are aware that the City Council and CDD are studying parking policies more broadly, and
the outcome is likely to affect any discussions related to housing.

•

Dimensional Standards: Dimensional requirements such as height, setbacks, and open
space can affect housing development. Because they interact in complex ways, it would
require exhaustive study to evaluate options for changing them and what outcomes would
likely result. Overall, Board members were supportive of retaining requirements for
setbacks and open space, though the specific requirements could be studied further and
adjusted if desired. Some Board members discussed whether changes in allowed height
could provide more open space, while others appreciated the consistency of the 35-foot
height limit across neighborhoods.

•

Affordability: It is very difficult to create affordability requirements that are both
effective and legally enforceable. However, Board members emphasized that it is
important to continue working toward possible strategies that could increase the supply of
affordable housing in all neighborhoods.

•

Broader Housing Production: Some Board members suggested taking a more holistic
view of the housing goals of Envision Cambridge, such as looking at whether more
housing can be permitted in transit-served areas. These ideas may be worthwhile to
discuss, but would be somewhat different than the current discussion, which is focused
on a citywide approach to eliminating zoning that restricts certain types of housing in
certain areas. If the Council’s policy goal is to create new housing opportunities more
broadly, it may be worthwhile to look beyond only the most restrictive residential
districts.

Next Steps
The Board welcomes input from the City Council on specific policy objectives that would help
to further refine the zoning concepts under discussion. With that guidance, CDD and the
Planning Board can further pursue options for zoning changes that would meet the stated
objectives.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

Planning Board Discussion
Preferred Approaches

• Change standards in current districts, rather than a complete
rezoning
• Aim for incremental, not wholesale change
• Advance some things sooner (e.g., more use types, housing units);
others will need more study and discussion (e.g., setbacks, parking)

• Non-zoning strategies are also needed – e.g., affordability will need
subsidies, &c.

Planning Board Discussion
Policy Considerations: What are the Council’s priorities?

• Equity – should the City allow the same types of housing across the
City, or different types in different neighborhoods?
• Housing production – is more housing density desirable in some areas
compared to others?
• Housing costs – is it a priority to allow more market-rate units, even if
they are higher-priced?
• Neighborhood impacts – how to balance housing priorities with
needs for open space, trees, and parking?

Options for Further Study
These would not change under the concepts presented:
Zoning Requirements Issues and Considerations
FAR and Height
Setbacks and Open
Space

• More FAR could raise land values, result in larger units
• 3-story height is typical across neighborhoods; more
height could promote open space
• Takes more study to know how requirements interact
with each other and with existing conditions

Parking

• Zoning petition currently in review
• CDD study to hear community views, review regulations

Affordability
Requirements

• Current zoning has “mandatory inclusionary” at 10+
units, “voluntary inclusionary” at < 10 units
• Changes need careful legal and economic study
