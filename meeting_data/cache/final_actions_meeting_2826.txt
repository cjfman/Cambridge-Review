Guiding Principles
Communication: Retail_20210309 (Public Hearings)

• Regulate “like” uses (e.g., food service, entertainment, recreation)
in a more consistent way throughout City
• Fill “gaps” where retail is present or desired but is more restricted
in zoning
• Where plans call for ground floor activation, recognize that retail
has moved beyond “shops” – it will require a broader range of uses

Part 5: Special Permit Criteria

Special permits will normally be granted where specific provisions of this Ordinance are met, except when
particulars of the location or use, not generally true of the district or of the uses permitted in it, would
cause granting of such permit to be to the detriment of the public interest because:

General SP Considerations (current)

Retail Considerations (proposed)

Zoning requirements

Delivery and loading operations

Congestion, hazard, or change in neighborhood
character due to traffic

Environmental nuisance to neighbors – dust, odors,
smoke, noise, light

Adverse effect on adjacent uses
Nuisance or hazard to occupants or citizens

Compatibility of façade with visual character of the
area

Integrity of district, intent of zoning

Meeting objectives in citywide or area plans

• Use table complicated to read – too many footnotes, too many categories,
definitions not up-to-date
• Food entrepreneurs face difficulties – e.g., commercial kitchens, fast order food
requirements
• Too much time to resolve zoning issues and obtain variances, costly for small
businesses having to carry rent
• Parking requirements
• Non-conforming uses
• Allowing mixed uses in one space, different revenue streams
