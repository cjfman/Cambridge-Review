COMPARING BUSINESS MODELS TO OBJECTIVES
We revisited the specific goals developed by the City’s Broadband Task Force and
assessed how the choice of business model affects meeting those goals.
• We concluded that three of the City’s goals (#1, #3 and #4) can
be achieved regardless of the business model chosen.
• Equity is one of the City’s most important policy objectives.
Extending high speed affordable broadband to all can be achieved
through means testing, which can be incorporated into contractual
provisions even in models with private investment.
• Irrespective of the business model chosen, entrepreneurs and
small businesses will benefit greatly from symmetrical gigabit
connectivity, and the project will spur innovation and excellence.
• In addition to the Broadband Task Force’s goals, we found it
necessary to add two additional goals that are important to the
City: Public ownership and minimizing (the City’s) financial risk.

Broadband Objectives:
1. Affordability and Equity
2. Choice and Competition
3. Supporting Entrepreneurs
& Small Business
4. Innovation & Excellence
5. Local Control

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF BUSINESS MODELS
Based on the Cambridge Broadband Objectives, we developed the following criteria to
evaluate the various business models proposed
• Public Ownership: Does the business model allow the public sector to retain long-term
ownership of (at minimum) the Passive Infrastructure?
• Local Control: Does the business model allow the City to incorporate key public policy goals
into contracts with private partners (e.g., price benchmarking rather than setting rates)?

• Choice & Competition: Does the business model lend itself to increased choice and
competition for subscribers?
• Minimizing Financial Risk: Does the business model serve to minimize the long-term
financial risk to the City as the owner of (at minimum) the Passive Infrastructure?

PUBLIC FUNDING OPTIONS
Municipal broadband networks have been funded and financed in many different
ways across the U.S. and internationally.
Some networks may be able to be funded entirely through subscription fees (revenue
collected from subscribers), but public funding is often required to make the project
financially feasible. Come common public funding sources for municipal broadband include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

General property tax
Dedicated sales tax or sales tax increment
Utility fee (charge for services)
Special assessment districts
Existing budget/capital funds
“In-kind” support (e.g., access to rights-of-way, data, or tax breaks)
Grant funding (federal/state)

Some of these sources can be used to repay financing for the upfront capital investment.

Muni ISP

❑ Pros: A City funded and operated network is the only business model in which the City will have full control
over all aspects of the broadband network construction and operations, including the phasing and
prioritization of digital equity sites. A municipally-owned and operated fiber to the premises network will
provide a meaningful alternative to Comcast.
❑ Cons: The City is missing out on opportunities to transfer risks to a private sector party that may be better
equipped to manage those risks (including interfaces between scope elements). The City is fully retaining the
risk on subscriber take rates and long-term subscriber revenues. In addition, the City is responsible for the
day-to-day operations and retains the risk associated with operation and maintenance costs.
❑ Options/Alternatives: The City could decide to outsource Active Infrastructure and Service Provision to a
private company, without transferring revenue risk to that entity. Under this model, the City would not be
responsible for day-to-day operations of the network although it would continue to be exposed to long-term
risks associated with operation and maintenance costs.

CASE STUDY: WHIP CITY FIBER
This case study highlights an example of a municipally-run ISP delivering services on
municipally-funded/financed infrastructure, right in Cambridge’s backyard
• Whip City Fiber is an ISP operated by Westfield Gas & Electric (WG+E), providing
symmetrical 1GB service to homes and businesses in 20 communities in western MA
through a municipal utility structure called a Municipal Light Plant (MLP).
• Under this model, the local municipalities fund and finance the construction of passive
infrastructure, and Whip City Fiber provides the active infrastructure and services to end
users.
• This case demonstrates how a municipal utility with existing experience in delivering
services to customers can expand into the broadband sector.
• This example is also unique in that WG+E is serving as ISP for many municipalities.
• Some other notable examples of municipal broadband networks delivered under a similar
model include LUS Fiber in Lafayette, LA, Chattanooga, TN, and Deerfield Valley, CO. Packet16Pg. 18

Private ISP(s)

❑ Pros: The City controls the dark fiber and given market characteristics/conditions, can be confident there will
be private ISPs interested in leasing the dark fiber network and providing Active Infrastructure and Service
Provision. City has flexibility to structure combination of lease fees and revenue sharing to potentially
partake in revenue upside scenarios. Private ISP takes revenue risk and is therefore incentivized to provide
high quality service.
❑ Cons: Determining a fair market value for the lease fee can be challenging. ISP(s) may resist constraints on
pricing, thus limiting the City’s influence over affordability. If there is only one private ISP, as opposed to
multiple ISPs (see below), competition/choice will be limited.
❑ Options/Alternatives: Instead of a single ISP for Active Infrastructure and Service Provision, multiple ISPs
could be invited to provide the same. The size of the City’s network could potentially limit the interest of
competing ISPs to operate in the City.

CASE STUDY: COLORADO SPRINGS, CO
This case study highlights a recent example of a private ISP delivering services on
municipally-funded/financed infrastructure
• In Colorado Springs, Ting Internet will provide gigabit Internet service over fiber
infrastructure built by Colorado Springs Utilities.
• In this non-exclusive arrangement, Ting Internet will be the initial anchor tenant on a citywide (not-for-profit) fiber network owned by Colorado Springs Utilities.
• This model leverages the City’s experience in building and managing utilities with Ting’s
expertise in provisioning and marketing fiber services to customers.
• Construction on the fiber network will begin by Q3 2022 and is expected to surpass more
than 200,000 addresses.
• Other notable examples of municipal networks delivered under a similar model include
Westminster, MD, Huntsville, AL, Breckenridge, CO and Fort Morgan, CO

❑ Pros: This model allows the City to transfer revenue risk while achieving meaningful competition for both
Active Infrastructure and Service Provision, even within a small-scale market. Competition for Active
Infrastructure will be achieved through a competitive procurement process; a single Active Infrastructure
contractor reduces redundant cost, reducing overall costs. An open market for Service Provision maximizes
potential for competition, driving affordability.
❑ Cons: Similar to prior model, it may be challenging to determining fair market value for the lease fees and
level of pricing control City can exercise over ISPs can be limited. Interface between Active Infrastucture
contractor and ISPs can be challenging to define.
❑ Options/Alternatives: Competitive selection of, and strict performance requirement regime for Active
Infrastructure contractor is critical for success. There are various options for ensuring competitive tension
and incentivizing performance. There are also various ways to structure the revenue risk allocation between
the Active Infrastructure contractor and ISPS through lease fees or other mechanisms if desired.

CASE STUDY: AMMON, ID
This case study highlights a useful example of the “open access” model layered onto
municipally-funded dark fiber infrastructure
• The township of Ammon, ID constructed a dark fiber network, paid for through a
combination of federal grants, and funds raised through Local Improvement Districts.
Under this model, the network is not built all at once, but is phased with demand; dark
fiber is deployed to a neighborhood only when a sufficient percentage of residents “opt
in” and agree to be part of a new Local Improvement District.
• Ammon partnered with EntryPoint Networks to pilot and launch network virtualization
software, which includes an online portal allowing four different ISPs to lease bandwidth
on the network and offer retail services to customers. This network design is highly
automated and allows for new ISPs to be added to the network, and for customers to
switch ISPs seamlessly.
• This general model is prevalent in Sweden. Another similar, notable US example is
UTOPIA (UT), although here the active infrastructure is provided by the public sector.

Hybrid*

❑ Pros: The City is maximizing its potential for long-term risk transfer through a Project Agreement with a P3 Partner. The P3
Partner has rights of use to the network during the Project Agreement, subject to terms and conditions imposed by the City
(e.g., the City can step in if the P3 Partner consistently fails to deliver quality service). The City is also leveraging private
financing to reduce (but not eliminate) the upfront public contribution needed to build the network.
❑ Cons: Complexity of P3 procurement and contracting process. Higher cost of private financing relative to public financing
may not create value for money for an asset with limited lifecycle optimization potential.
❑ Options/Alternatives: As illustrated on the prior slide, there are various sub-options for structuring the contracting and risk
allocation of a P3. Each sub-option also has its own pros and cons:
❑ Sub-option 4a: City to procure separate ISP (Active Infra + Service Provision) contract(s). Challenging to estimate fair
market value for lease fees from ISP(s) to City.
❑ Sub-option 4b: City to procure separate ISP (Service Provision only) contract(s)/create open market for ISPs.
Challenging to estimate fair market value for lease fees from ISP(s) to City. Interface between broadband SPV (who is
also responsible for Active Infra) and ISPs can be challenging to define.
❑ Sub-option 4c: Single integrated contractor for all scope elements reduces choice for consumers.

CASE STUDY: DUBLIN, NH
This case study highlights a useful example of hybrid financing paired with long-term
public ownership of the network
• Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc (CCI) has partnered with several small, rural
towns in Cheshire County, New Hampshire including Dublin, NH to build out fiber-to-thepremises networks.
• Under these agreements, Dublin and the other towns will sign 20-year contracts with CCI
to run the network (active infrastructure and services), but the towns will retain
ownership of the fiber networks.
• Dublin will finance the construction of the dark fiber with municipal bonds, which will be
repaid through subscriber fees charged by CCI, who will also cover the costs in any
shortfalls in subscriber revenue needed to cover the town’s debt service payments.
• CCI in exchange for its contribution in financing the network will have sole ISP rights.
