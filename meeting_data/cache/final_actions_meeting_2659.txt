MIT / KENDALL SQUARE OPEN SPACE
MIT is excited for the Kendall Square Open Space to become part of the network of Cambridge open spaces. The benefits of the collaboration with city staff
and feedback from the Planning Board have been incorporated into the design and we are pleased to share how this process has benefited the final design.

A broad central east-west open space connection extends the ‘Infinite Corridor’ inside MIT, into the exterior – creating a
civic promenade defined by enhanced paving, feature lighting, flush curbs, and active programming. These features
emphasize the pedestrian-oriented character of the space, while allowing efficient access for cyclists and integration with
on-street bike networks.

Site lighting prioritizes uniformity, with low glare and low contrast, provided by discrete LED full cut-off fixtures. Lighting includes 25’ poles on the streets
and parking lot, with simple 16’ pedestrian poles through the core open space. A simple approach to overall illumination emphasizes the impact of feature
lighting: Infinite Corridor lighting installation, headhouse and building canopies, custom platforms, and seatwalls.

facilitating quiet and intimate conversations or small classes, to impromptu stages for display or events. The freestanding bench is unusual and playful –
while also comfortable, composed of 2 long and distinctive timber-style forms that slip against each other. Moveable chairs throughout the space, all with
backs and many with armrests, will further accommodate flexible use in coordination with movable tables and umbrellas.

10. Gateway / Main Street Paving – Clarify Transition
The project maintains the continuity and precedence of the Main Street public realm (scored concrete and distinctive furnishing strip). The paving interface
has been modified to address Planning Board comments regarding the paving material transition: instead of notching up and running along the property
line as previously shown, the project’s paving material is aligned with the edge of Building 4, marking a crisp transition from Main Street to the ‘Gateway’.
Additionally, paving at the Gateway has is no longer monolithic. Contrasting paving bands break up the ground plane – responding to the architecture of
the headhouse and canopy above, but also importantly mediating the scale from the Main Street edge into the broad central open space.

The trees in the ‘Gateway’ have changed to accommodate the final design of the MBTA Headhouse. By shifting the trees, connections have opened up
between the MIT Forum and the MIT Museum. The trees are are consolidated into a single trench to avoid extensive underground MBTA and garage
structures and utilities. A review of the wind study by the wind study engineer shows no change to wind conditions as a result of the tree relocations and
notes a general improvement in the Gateway as a function of the new MBTA Headhouse and the adjacent development at 325 Main Street.

A 42” tall concrete guardwall is located along the Amherst Street garage

guardwall from sidewalks along Hayward Street. The addition of a
guardrail as suggested by city staff on top of the ramp guardwall will
further prevent sitting or propping objects on the wall. We are currently
investigating options, including a rail constructed of flat steel members, in
order to achieve a visually-unobtrusive feature in the public realm.
