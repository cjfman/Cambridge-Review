How "Local Approvals" work with
State

Applicant submits
complete
application for a
Marijuana
License to the MA
CCC.

MA CCC notifies
City of application
and provides 90
days for City to
certify that
applicant is
compliant with all
ordinances (a.k.a.
“local
approvals”).

Upon certification
from City,
applicant secures
Provisional
License from MA
CCC and submits
a copy to the
City.

City reviews
Provisional
License to ensure
information is
consistent with
City records from
Local Approvals.

Pending approval,
applicant is
issued the
Cannabis
Business Permit
from Cambridge
Inspectional
Services
Department (ISD).

Applicant allowed
to apply for
Construction
Permit from ISD
and then
pursue Certificate
of Occupancy.

Once complete,
applicant can
pursue Final
Marijuana
License from the
MA CCC.

MA CCC
performs on-site
inspection of
premises and
then issues
"Commence
Operations"
designation.

Problem / Limited Access

While cannabis still lies
outside mainstream
medicine, 90% of us want it
as a medical option.
