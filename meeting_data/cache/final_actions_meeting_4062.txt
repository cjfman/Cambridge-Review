DEFINITION OF
NET ZERO

Net Zero Emissions are defined in the Net Zero Action Plan as a
community of buildings for which annually all greenhouse gas emissions
produced through building operations are offset by carbon-free energy.

Packet Pg. 7

Net Zero Action Plan 5-Year Review
•

•

The Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP) was adopted by the City
Council in 2015 following an 18-month stakeholder
process to identify a phased set of actions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing buildings
and develop a renewable energy supply strategy for
Cambridge buildings.
As part of the original NZAP, the Task Force proposed that
the whole suite of actions be reviewed every five years to
allow for the overall strategy to adjust based on changing
economics, technology, and stakeholder needs.

Why Net Zero Buildings?
• 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in
Cambridge are from building construction
and operations. Since the original NZAP was
issued in 2015, more than 8 million square
feet of buildings have been added. If the city
can get to net zero in the building sector, we
will have made major progress toward
achieving our carbon neutral commitment.

Science

a

• Since the adoption of the Net Zero Action Plan in June 2015,
the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body
responsible for assessing the science related to climate
change, has issued special reports on the impacts of global
warming.
• The latest gap report indicates that to keep to within 1.5 deg
C above pre-industrial levels, emissions need to be reduced
45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and 100% by 2050 maintain
the ability to reach this target1.
• With every passing year, there is more urgency in the
scientific imperative, the years since 2015 have been the
hottest on record

Policy

a

• At the Federal Government Level:
• A slowdown in federal policy under the Trump administration
for energy efficiency, especially for plug loads created a gap in
behavioral energy use reductions
• Federal pollution regulations and tax credits will play a role in
clean energy procurement for the City
• National building codes such as the 2021 IECC set the
baseline for state code updates
• Whether policy objectives under the Biden administration are
realized could have a large impact on GHG emissions, though
they may have less of a direct impact on local building sector
emissions

Attachment: Exec Summary_Cambridge NZAP_Final (15788 : A communication was

Policy (continued)

a

• At the State Level:
• The current Three-Year Energy Efficiency Plan for gas and
electric utilities expires in 2021 and may shift to focus
more on GHG emissions. Although the Plan is
implemented at the state level, the City can advocate for
alignment with local objectives and advance programs for
hard-to-reach sectors like multifamily buildings.
• Recent State Legislation:
― An Act Setting Next Generation Climate Policy
(S.2477) sets statewide net-zero emissions limit for
the year 2050: It also sets sub-limits for specific
sectors
― An Act Relative to Energy Savings Efficiency (S.2478)
that enacts appliance efficiency standards
Packet Pg. 15

Attachment: Exec Summary_Cambridge NZAP_Final (15788 : A communication was

Policy (continued)

a

• At the Local Level:
• Cambridge has now committed to achieving carbon neutrality by
2050. The faster Cambridge can reduce emissions within its
borders, the more the City can lead by example in the global
effort to combat climate change
• Cambridge voted on the proposed changes to the IECC in
December 2019 that would advance EE in new construction.
• The City will continue to advocate for a net zero stretch code at
the state level
• A fossil fuel ban was considered, however, Brookline’s effort to
ban on fossil fuel was struck down by the State Attorney General.
Still other pathways are open for consideration.

Dimensions

Social equity cuts across many
dimensions, each of which requires
consideration.

Pitfalls

Each equity dimension has
common equity pitfalls that should
be acknowledged, addressed, and
intentionally mitigated should they
arise.

Housing cost and rental cost increases,
Energy cost increases,
Inequitable program participation, and
Inequitable distribution of benefits and burdens.

Potential equity pitfalls can be avoided by incorporating
specific policy language that targets equity and builds in
flexibility so that policies can be adjusted if inequitable
impacts arise.

Analysis of GHG Emissions Trends
The inventory data shows that although emissions fluctuate year to year, the general building
sector emissions trend has increased slightly since 2012. A regression analysis of possible
contributing factors was performed by DNV which considered degree day data, policies
enacted during this time, and commercial and residential floor area data and found that
overall:
• The commercial sector has twice the impact on emissions trends as the residential sector.
• More cooling degree days (an amount of time during the year when cooling is in demand in
buildings) correlates with higher GHG emissions.
• Floor area added within the City from new construction projects was not statistically
associated with changes in total emissions, as emission increases from new buildings were
balanced out by increased efficiency and renewable electricity supply to the existing
building stock.

Net Zero Action Impacts To-date
Comparison of Recent Trends to the 2030 UNEP Aligned Emissions Target

Packet Pg. 31

Net Zero Action Impacts To-date
The impact assessment involved a review of community-wide emissions trends in recent years in relation
to future goals as well as a bottom-up assessment of the NZAP actions adopted in 2015. The combination
of these two approaches helped determine the overall impacts of the NZAP since 2015. The review of the
original NZAP actions found that:
•

The 2015 NZAP has laid the groundwork to reduce emissions from the City of Cambridge
building stock with quantifiable impacts from five strategies aimed at increasing the energy efficiency
of buildings, improving the performance of new construction, and providing more renewables in the
energy supply.

•

Nearly 1,100 buildings in the City now report their energy and water usage to the City
annually through the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO), providing valuable
information for planning and with future performance requirements currently being planned.

•

Of the five NZAP Actions that were identified as contributing to measurable results to-date; there are
improvements needed in data collection and program tracking. The emissions savings could
only be calculated for four of those actions based on availability of data, representing only 1% of the
of the total buildings sector emissions in 2015.

Projects that align with these standards include:
• The King Open School (2019) – Fossil fuel free
• 859 Mass Ave (2017) – Deep energy retrofit with GSHPs
• Martin Luther King School (2016) – 69% energy performance improvement
Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO)
• Enacted in 2016 has led to nearly 1,100 buildings in the city that now report
their energy and water usage to the city annually
• While no emissions savings are currently attributed at this time, we
anticipate that the addition of the performance improvement requirement
will result in significant impacts in the coming years

Overview
The intent of this action is to ensure that small-med
residential and small commercial buildings are operating
optimally and, where possible, are retrofitted to maximize
efficiency and GHG reductions. In addition to these
requirements, other tools and policies will be directed
broadly across all building types, where appropriate, in
order to achieve the necessary emissions savings.
This Action will have 3 areas of focus:
•

Multifamily Custom Retrofit

•

LMI Multifamily Engagement

•

Small Commercial Custom Retrofit

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
The custom retrofit programs are instrumental for engaging
residents and small business owners in the implementation
of the NZAP. They align well with the principles of the NZAP,
in particular: engaging affected stakeholders; developing
informative and replicable models; and demonstrating
commitment to equity and social justice.

a

This Action aims to enable retrofitting of existing
homes and businesses in Cambridge to achieve
more efficient operations and energy savings. It
has positive equity impacts because more energy
efficient homes and businesses improve indoor
comfort and air quality and lower energy bills,
with particular benefits for vulnerable
populations.

Cross-cutting Issues

1.2 BEUDO Requirements
Overview
The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance covers
commercial buildings >25,000sf and residential buildings
>50 units. While a small proportion of the total number of
buildings in Cambridge, these largest buildings account for
over 50% of the square footage and approximately 80% of
building-generated GHG emissions in Cambridge. By
targeting these buildings for improvement, Cambridge will
see significant progress in GHG emission reductions. This
Action has two tracks:
1.2.1 Performance Requirements
1.2.2 BEUDO Resource Hub

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
1.2.1 – Performance Requirements: The BEUDO
Performance Requirement is essential for meeting the
City’s net zero emissions goal. By adopting performance
standards, owners (or real estate managers) of buildings
that make up the largest source of emissions in the City will
be required to find ways to reduce their emissions to net
zero over time.

Equity: Flag
While this action places the greatest amount of
responsibility on the largest emitters in the City to
assist in the transition to a net zero emissions city, it
must be noted that the costs of building upgrades may
get passed on to tenants and for large multi-family
buildings subject to BEUDO increase housing costs,
creating a potential equity pitfall for vulnerable
residents and businesses. The current BEUDO
performance requirement proposal would give
increased flexibility to affordable housing and allow
affordable housing developers to access financial
support to meet their upgrade requirements.

At the same time, transaction points may provide
access to financing, such as mortgages, which can
make energy upgrades more accessible to building
owners.
Upgrades at the time of building transaction points
also have the potential for equity benefits. Building
upgrades will result in more energy efficient homes
and businesses, which improve indoor comfort and
air quality, and lower energy bills.

Overview

Key Activities

The initial net zero new construction targets
developed for the NZAP are considered outdated and
require alignment with current standards practices,
state-level code initiatives, and the urgency of
addressing climate impacts from new construction
activities. These original targets can be used as a
reference point but should be adjusted as more
information becomes available.

Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Advocate for a state-level net zero stretch code
approach that aligns with Cambridge’s net zero
emissions priorities
2. Compile net zero resources and templates for
the building community to achieve net zero
standards by construction type
3. Adopt state net zero stretch code
4. Revisit and assess timeline for net zero new
construction by building type based on state
code structure
5. Monitor and assess opportunities to avoid
fossil fuel use in new construction

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
The originally recommended targets were intended to
show leadership and create an environment of
innovation, yet regardless of how the state stretch
code for net zero new construction affects the target
years, this action is anticipated to contribute to the
net zero goals by avoiding emissions that would
otherwise be added by new buildings.

Equity: Flag

Although recent experience shows that the cost of
constructing net zero roughly aligns with the cost of
traditional construction for many building types, in
adopting the new code, the City must consider any
incremental cost of net zero buildings – that is,
costs above and beyond non-net zero buildings –
that may be passed on in the form of increased
housing or rental costs, creating a potential equity
pitfall.
Net zero buildings also entail potential equity
benefits. Net zero buildings are more energy
efficient, improve indoor comfort and air quality,
and can lower building operational costs.

Cross-cutting Issues

Renewable Thermal: Fossil fuel free new
construction should be considered as part of net
zero design
Climate Change Preparedness / Resilience: Ensure
that NZE aligns with all-electric construction with
resilient design strategies. Consider requiring a
resilience narrative as a part of permit process
Electric Transport: Consider requiring charging
station access or charging station ready design
Capacity / Local Carbon Fund: For any building
unable to achieve ZNE, contributions should be
made to the carbon fund; will need to determine
what those contributions are and when the
fund/CCA will be able to accept payments

2.1 Net Zero Requirements for New Construction

a

Overview
The Zoning Ordinance is a regulatory tool that
Cambridge can use to incrementally require higher
standards of green building and energy efficiency for
large commercial projects. Large buildings, subject to
Special Permit requirements, are currently required
to design to a certain LEED or other similar green
building standard. As a result, project developers are
delivering buildings that are higher quality. This
action also provides the opportunity for the City to
address another not previously considered but highly
impactful source of carbon emissions: embodied
carbon
Contribution to Net Zero Objective
This regulatory approach is a strong tool to
demonstrate the City’s commitment and leadership
on sustainable new construction. Going forward, Net
Zero projects should consider the impact of both
embodied carbon and operational carbon. Including
embodied carbon neutrality in the NZAP is an
important step in the pathway to achieve a net zero
carbon future.

Equity: Flag
A potential equity pitfall would occur if the incremental costs of
either the green building requirements or materials with lower
embodied carbon content are passed on to tenants and increase
housing or rental costs.
Lower embodied carbon buildings may also provide benefits beyond
emissions, including site sustainability, indoor environmental
quality, non-toxic building materials, reductions in waste generation
and water use, and increasing access to alternative transportation

2.3 Net Zero Requirement for New Construction + Deep Retrofits of
Municipal Buildings
Overview

To demonstrate leadership, the City has for several
years been designing and constructing new municipal
buildings to be fossil fuel free and, since 2020,
required to be net zero . This also applies to “gut
renovations” where a building is being completely
renovated with new electrical, mechanical, interior,
and envelope systems. This commitment to the net
zero and renewable thermal objectives will become a
formal policy and provide a showcase for others for
new technologies
Contribution to Net Zero Objective

There is significant benefit to the City demonstrating
leadership by committing to achieving net zero
emissions in its own building stock. This shows the
City’s commitment, demonstrates that net zero is
achievable, will generate savings and chart a path to
net zero for private industry.

3.1 Carbon-free Energy Supply
Key Activities

Overview
Achieving net zero emissions and improving climate
resiliency will require a significant shift from fossil fuelbased heating and hot water to low-carbon, renewable
thermal systems. Specifically, this action will include
continuing to support the electrification of individual
buildings’ heating and hot water systems, as well as
enabling low-carbon district energy systems where suitable.
In addition, the transition to renewable thermal will
translate to changes in grid infrastructure and the gas
network, and Cambridge should engage and lead on
planning for an equitable, effective transition to renewable
thermal energy supply.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
About half of the emissions attributed to the building sector
are from fossil fuel use. Accordingly, transitioning buildings
to renewable thermal systems will be an important part of
achieving progress on Cambridge’s Net Zero goals.
Electrification, using heat pumps and heat pump water
heaters, enables buildings to eliminate fossil fuel use,
instead using electric systems that can be powered by
renewable electricity. District energy will continue to play an
important role in commercial and institutional hubs.

13. Work with district energy system operators and legacy
utilities to plan for decarbonized transition

Equity: Flag

The City must take into account that the cost
of district energy and renewable thermal
energy systems may get passed on to
consumers in the form of increased energy
costs, creating a potential equity pitfall for the
most vulnerable residents. There might also
be inequities in access to renewable thermal
technologies.
Equity benefits could come from lower or
more stable energy costs. The City also has
the potential to take advantage of positive
equity impacts because district energy
systems enhance localized, more reliable
energy resources, which is of the greatest
benefit to vulnerable households.

3.2 On-site Renewable Electricity Access (Part 1)
Overview
On-site renewable energy access is intended to promote
on-site renewable energy systems and provide support to
building owners who may install these types of systems.
This may include rooftop photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal,
battery storage or fuel cells – systems capable of supplying
renewable electricity to the host building. This Action will
have two tracks:
3.2.1 Rooftop Solar Requirements
3.2.2 Community Solar Access

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
3.2.1 Rooftop Solar Requirements - The purpose of this
requirement is to ensure that all new buildings, and in the
future, existing buildings have access to on-site solar
generation or could easily be retrofitted at a later date
where feasible.

Anticipated Annual GHG Reductions by 2050
While the installation of renewable electricity systems such
as rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels produces emissions-free
electricity, emissions reductions from such projects are not
included as contributing to the goals of the NZAP, as the
RECs from these systems are likely to be traded and counted
as emissions reductions elsewhere.

Key Activities
Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Study the potential to integrate a solar
installation requirement with existing
green roof requirements in collaboration
with universities
Medium Term (3-5 Years)
2. Adopt a solar PV or solar thermal
installation requirement for new buildings
based on the feasibility study
3. Consider expanding solar ready
requirement to existing buildings by
applying the requirements for solar ready
to major roof replacements.
Long Term (5+ Years)
4. Enhanced solar requirement: Determine
means to increase on-site renewable
generation requirements on existing
buildings.

Equity: Flag

The City must take into account that the costs of
rooftop solar energy sources could get passed on
in the form of increased energy and/or housing
costs, creating one or more potential equity
pitfalls.
The operational costs of renewable electricity are
very low and can result in energy cost savings for
vulnerable Cambridge residents, depending on
the ultimate distribution of program costs and
benefits. When paired with energy storage,
rooftop solar is also more reliable.

Cross-cutting Issues

Renewable Thermal Systems: Improved the
costs-effectiveness of renewable thermal options
Climate Change Preparedness / Resilience:
Strong overlap, enables greater access to on-site
back-up power supply for when larger grid is
down
Electric Transport: On-site renewables may serve
as a source of energy for charging electric
vehicles
Capacity / Local Carbon Fund: Carbon fund may
be used to offset costs of solar installations.

3.2 On-site Renewable Electricity Access (Part 2)
Overview
Community Solar Access: building off the solar
initiatives undertaken to-date, Cambridge should
pursue implementing a third-party administered
on-site solar action initiative. The primary aim of
this program will be to enable the installation of
solar on underutilized existing roofs and to give
more residents access to the economic and
resilience aspects of solar electricity.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
3.2.2 Community Solar Access- The purpose of
this action is to use market forces to add solar
photovoltaics to existing buildings connecting
developers to consumers who cannot add solar
themselves.

Anticipated Annual GHG Reductions by 2050
While the installation of community solar projects
produces emissions-free electricity, emissions reductions
from such projects are not considered to be contributing
to the emissions reductions goals because it is uncertain
where ownership of the RECs will lie.

Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Further design of solar administrator
program, including function, structure,
and funding
2. Implement community solar program
based on program design
Medium Term (3-5 Years)
3. Continue to expand access to on-site
solar for all populations
4. Integrate program with virtual microgrid
concepts
Long Term (5+ Years)
5. Integrate with the enhanced community
aggregation program

Equity: Positive
The City has the potential to take advantage of
positive equity impacts because community
solar programs have the potential to reduce
energy costs for participants who are unable to
install solar on their own homes, and the
customer receives a bill credit for the energy
generated by their share. Access to community
solar projects should be prioritized for
vulnerable populations.

Cross-cutting Issues
Renewable Thermal Systems: Improved the costseffectiveness of renewable thermal options
Climate Change Preparedness / Resilience: Strong
overlap, enables greater access to on-site back-up

3.3 Off-site Renewable Electricity Access
Key Activities

Overview
While energy efficiency and on-site renewable
generation will contribute to buildings achieving net
zero emissions, they are not enough on their own to
achieve the net zero goals of the City. The dense urban
context in Cambridge requires that off-site renewable
electricity access be a part of the mix. Not all off-site
renewable contracts have the same impact, however.
When seeking to procure off-site renewables, it is
necessary to adhere to certain criteria to have a
positive impact. Under this action, criteria will be
adopted more formally so that corporate entities and
others have the guidance they need to enter into
renewable power purchase agreements.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
This action is considered enabling and is designed to
facilitate access to renewable energy resources when
demand reduction, on-site renewables, and
improvements to the state electricity grid are not
adequate for meeting NZE performance targets.

to get passed on in the form of increased energy
costs, creating a potential equity pitfall.
Alternatively, the low operational costs of
renewable electricity can result in energy cost
savings and less price volatility for vulnerable
Cambridge residents. As the state-wide, regionwide, and nation-wide share of renewable
energy grows, there is less need for existing or
new fossil fuel resources which often
disproportionately impact vulnerable
populations.

Action 4.1 Local Carbon Fund (Enhanced
Community Aggregation)

Packet Pg. 59

Overview
For Cambridge to become a net zero community, it will
require an annual emissions balance across the entirety of the
City’s building stock. The primary goal of this action is to
create a single point from which financial and technical
resources may be deployed in order to support the emissions
reductions in the other actions, thereby creating greater
flexibility and coordination of compliance with those actions.
The new approach to Community Choice Aggregation
recommended here, also known as Aggregation 3.0, moves
away from the boilerplate green energy business products of
deregulated energy retailers and utilities towards a local
ownership pathway allowing for widespread local deployment
of DERs, and energy improvements including efficiency
improvements and electrification.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
This action is considered essential for increasing the number
of energy efficiency and electrification projects completed. To
date the City, CEA, and Energy Advisor programs have had
good results in engaging building owners in energy efficiency
programs, but few projects have moved forward through
completion. This action provides a mechanism by which
projects, companies and individuals can achieve net zero
emissions through having better access to energy efficiency
and electrification resources and be able to participate in
renewable energy purchasing programs.

Anticipated Annual GHG Reductions by 2050
This action is considered an enabling action. By implementing
this action and providing access to financing as well as capacity
for building owners to take action on energy improvement
projects, emissions reductions will be realized in Action 1.1,
Action 1.2, Action 1.3, Action 2.1, and Action 3.3.

*Since most on-site solar is incentivized by state programs that re-sell the RECs (renewable energy attributes) to other parties, those emissions savings cannot be attributed to Cambridge

Projected Emissions Reductions by Source
When looking at the project savings potential for the updated set of Actions, we see that while energy efficiency and
demand reduction play a role in achieving the net zero goals, it is the ability of corporate entities, residents, and small
businesses to switch off of fossil fuel-based thermal energy and access enough renewable electricity that will determine
if the net zero goals are achieved.

Key Partnerships
• City staff cannot achieve the Net Zero Emissions goals alone. The City will continue to work with the
Net Zero Task Force members, City Council, and other stakeholders to ensure that the residents,
institutions, and development community in Cambridge are not only consulted, but central to the
implementation and evolution of the project over time. Other Key Partnerships include:
•

Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) – CDD staff will ensure that annual progress
updates proceed and are reviewed by CPAC to ensure accountability and transparency.

•

Resilient Cambridge – The climate adaptation plan resulting from the Climate Change
Preparedness and Vulnerability Assessment with a range of recommendations for buildings in
Cambridge, including energy resilience

•

Envision Cambridge – The citywide plan adopted in 2019 centered on the core values of
livability, diversity and equity, economic opportunity, sustainability and resilience, community
health and wellbeing, and learning, which includes goals, indicators, and targets for climate and
environment

•

City Council Climate Crisis Working Group – A group of community advocates and local and
state climate experts working over the course of fall 2021 to provide a prioritized list of specific
actions the City can take to address the urgent challenge of climate change

Key Partnerships
• The NZAP Actions should also be assessed in regard to City control and where there is reliance on
regional and state actors to achieve the Action goals. Partnerships and advocacy should be
established with the appropriate institutions to accomplish the activities of each Action.
For example:
•

Action 1.1: MassSave provides financial support and technical services for energy efficiency
building and infrastructure improvements to Massachusetts residents and businesses

•

Action 2.1: The state building code regulates energy use in new construction and is
established by the Board of Building Regulations and Standards, building off of the International
Energy Conservation Code

•

Action 3.2: The Department of Energy Resources regulates incentives such as the Solar
Massachusetts Renewable Target based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the
state legislature

•

Action 3.3: The Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the state legislature governs the
amount of renewable electricity which must be purchased by competitive electricity suppliers
