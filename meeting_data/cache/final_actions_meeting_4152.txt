RE:

Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance – Proposed Amendments

SANDRA CLARKE
Deputy Director
Chief of Administration

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Please find attached proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance. The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
adopted in 2014 and requires energy and water reporting from commercial
properties over 25,000 square feet and residential properties over 50 units. This
regulates approximately 1,100 buildings in Cambridge which are responsible for
approximately 75% of the building sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The ordinance has successfully increased transparency and awareness of energy
and water consumption by the regulated buildings. BEUDO includes a provision
requiring that the Community Development Department review the impact of the
ordinance on energy performance of covered properties, and recommend
amendments to improve building energy performance if it has not improved
significantly. Analysis performed in 2018 concluded that energy performance of
covered properties had not improved significantly and therefore CDD initiated a
performance requirement policy development process with participation of over
35 unique entities, representing private commercial and residential building
owners, universities, affordable housing providers, and green building
professionals. The attached proposal is the result of this collaborative process.
These proposed BEUDO amendments are intended to introduce GHG
performance requirements for BEUDO properties and achieve science-based
GHG reductions consistent with other leading cities including Boston, New York,
and Washington D.C. The performance requirements:

Voice: 617 349-4600
Fax: 617 349-4669
TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

Eliminate GHG emissions from regulated properties by 2050, with the
following intermediate targets compared to an individual 2018-2019
baseline for most buildings:
o 20% by 2025
o 40% by 2030

Community Development Department

o 60% by 2035
o 80% by 2040
o 90% by 2045
•

Provide multiple compliance pathways including energy efficiency
improvements, electrification, on-site renewable energy, off-site
renewable energy, electricity grid improvements, and alternative
compliance payments.

•

Provide flexibility including an optional early baseline to account for early
action, alternative compliance timeframes for laboratories and affordable
housing, and portfolio level compliance for campus owners and affordable
housing.

•

Leverage technical support and access to state and federal financial
incentives through the existing Building Energy Retrofit Program.

The attached proposal for amendments to BEUDO represents an essential step in
Cambridge’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. The Net Zero Action Plan
adopted in 2015 and updated in 2021 identifies BEUDO performance
requirements as an integral part of a comprehensive suite of actions which
together will phase out GHG emissions from new buildings, many existing
buildings, and much of the energy supply system in Cambridge. This Plan has
been created and updated by a Net Zero Task Force representing stakeholders
throughout the community and is being overseen by the Climate Protection
Advisory Committee. Both stakeholder groups have urged the prompt
advancement of strong BEUDO performance requirements.
We are pleased to present these amendments to move forward the discussion of
emission reductions from the largest buildings in Cambridge based on a
comprehensive and collaborative stakeholder engagement process.

ORDINANCE NUMBER 1360
Final Publication Number XXXX. First Publication in the Chronicle on XXXX.
City of Cambridge
In the Year Two Thousand and TwentyOne AN ORDINANCE
In amendment to the Ordinance entitled “Building Energy Use,” Chapter 8.67 of the Municipal Code of
the City of Cambridge
Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Cambridge that the Municipal Ordinances of
the City of Cambridge in be amended as follows:

Building Energy Use Disclosure and Emission Reductions
8.67.10 DEFINITIONS

(1)

“Affordable Housing” shall mean Residential Covered Property in which all units are made
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area median income.
(2)

“Alternative Compliance Credit” shall mean a credit obtained by a Covered Property
Owner to offset greenhouse gas emissions from the Covered Property. One Alternative
Compliance Credit shall be equivalent to one metric ton of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
In the first Compliance Period, each Alternative Compliance Credit shall cost $234. The
Department shall promulgate regulations pursuant to 8.67.130 prior to each
Compliance Period to establish the price of the Alternative Compliance Credit for that
Compliance Period, based on review of the average cost of reducing one metric ton of
greenhouse gas emissions in Covered Properties. In lieu of payment, the Department
may accept, upon prior written agreement and at its discretion, until the 2035
Compliance Period but not thereafter, documentation from the Property Owner that
they have paid for the elimination of one ton of greenhouse gas emissions in the same
year in a Covered Property not owned or controlled by the Property Owner, in excess of
the Covered Property's GHG reduction requirements under this ordinance, as
demonstrated by the benchmarking report of said Covered Property. Monies from
Alternative Compliance Credits shall be used by the City for City programs and projects
to support greenhouse gas reduction, including but not limited to, greenhouse gas
reduction projects in Affordable Housing properties, if approved by the Cambridge
Affordable Housing Trust, and funding for Green Jobs training programs.

(3)

“Deferred Alternative Compliance Credit” (Deferred Credit) shall mean Alternative
Compliance Credit that is deferred for up to 5 years against a planned capital expense,
1
Packet Pg. 34

a

(4)

“Verified Local Carbon Credit” (Local Carbon Credit) shall mean a third-party verified,
permanent reduction of one metric ton of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, certified by the
Department, achieved locally to Cambridge, but not in any Covered Property. The
Department shall promulgate regulations pursuant to 8.67.130 to certify Local Carbon
Credits. The Department may decide at its discretion what it considers “local” to
Cambridge, but at no point shall the definition of “local” exceed the generally agreed
upon regional boundaries of New England. The percentage of outstanding Alternative
Compliance Credits for each Compliance Period that can be satisfied through Local
Carbon Credits shall decline at the rate of 5% per year, starting at 100% in 2025 and
declining to 0% in 2045. Up to the allowed percentage for that Compliance Period, a
Covered Property Owner may subtract the cost of one Local Carbon Credit it has paid
for during that Compliance Period from the cost of an Alternative Compliance Credit
prior to obtaining the Alternative Compliance Credit, up to the cost of an Alternative
Compliance Credit. After 2045, no Local Carbon Credits will be accepted.

(5)

“Verified Global Carbon Credit” (Global Carbon Credit) shall mean a third-party verified,
permanent reduction of one metric ton of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, certified by the
Department. The Department shall promulgate regulations pursuant to 8.67.130 to
certify Global Carbon Credits. The percentage of outstanding Alternative Compliance
Credits for each Compliance Period that can be satisfied through Global Carbon Credits
shall decline at the rate of 10% per year, starting at 100% in 2025 and declining to 0% in
2035. Up to the allowed percentage for that Compliance Period, a Covered Property
Owner may subtract the cost of one Global Carbon Credit it has paid for during that

Attachment: 20220520 DRAFT Amendments to BEUDO Amendment Proposals FINAL 11-4-21_Clean (COF 2022 #78 : Suggested amended

and up to 5 additional years for a capital expense actively being executed by the
Covered Property owner. The Department shall promulgate regulations pursuant to
8.67.130 to administer Deferred Alternative Compliance Credits. No new Deferred
Credits will be approved by the Department after 2035, nor shall the Department
approve Deferred Credits against more than one capital project per building. One
Deferred Credit can be granted by the Department against only one future reduction of
one metric ton of GHG Emissions. If the project, or an alternative project approved by
the Department, is not initiated after 5 years, or is not completed within 5 years after it
is initiated, or upon completion does not yield sufficient reductions to cover the total
outstanding Deferred Credits that are expiring in that Compliance Period, the balance of
expired Deferred Credits are due upon their expiration at their original cost, plus 10%
for each year that each Credit was deferred. Deferred Credits may also be paid by the
property owner during any Compliance Period prior to their expiration at their original
cost, plus 10% for each year that each credit was deferred. Any remainder deferral
period shorter than one year shall count as one full year. Deferred Credits may be
credited against the completed project until 2035. For example, if the project is
completed in 2032, and supposing the building reports zero emissions in 2033 and
subsequent years, then an additional 8% of emissions would be available in each
subsequent Compliance Year to credit against outstanding Deferred Credits, so 8% in
2033, 16% in 2034 and 24% in 2035. After 2035, any outstanding Deferred Credits would
be due, plus an additional 10% for each year they were deferred.

utility failure if it meets one of the following criteria:
i. The utility failed to provide an interconnect or other infrastructure required
to electrify the building during the Compliance Period, as agreed to under
contract.
ii. The utility failed to meet its obligations in providing electricity, including
Renewable Electricity to the building during the Compliance Period.
(f) Backup Generators: Documented emissions from on-site Backup Generators will be
exempt and can be subtracted from the emissions calculation if they meet the
following criteria. This exemption will expire after the 2035 compliance period to
encourage shifting to low and no-emissions back-up power sources:
i. Emissions caused by routine testing of on-site back-up generators for
maintenance and repair purposes.
ii. Emissions caused by a Utility Failure, including any power outage requiring
the operation of on-site back-up generators.
(g) Financial Distress: Owners of a financially distressed Covered Property may apply for
an extension until the end of the current compliance period. Owners must provide a
form of third-party verification to substantiate an exemption request due to
financial distress. A building is considered in financial distress if it meets one of the
following criteria:
(i) The Covered Property is qualified for sale at a public auction due to arrears of
public taxes within two years of the start of the compliance period.
(ii) The Covered Property is controlled by a court-appointed receiver due to financial
distress.

default.
The following building type-specific compliance pathways shall be permitted:
(a) Campus:
(i) A Campus may choose to comply with the requirements of Section 8.67.100 at
the level of each Covered Property or at the level of the aggregate Campus
greenhouse gas emissions, provided that the worst performing Covered Property
building on the Campus (the building with the highest value of total GHG
emissions without subtracting Off-site Renewable Electricity, divided by GFA) is
contributing durable GHG emissions reductions during that compliance period.
Campus Owners must determine their Baseline according to the method by which
they intend to comply with the requirements. Owners may request to adjust their
Baseline to include in the aggregate Campus any new buildings that receive their
Certificate of Occupancy after the start of the Baseline years.
(ii) If the Covered Property that is part of a Campus is included in an institutional
comprehensive plan and a corresponding energy management plan, and these
plans have reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions from buildings at the institutional
level by the required amount for that compliance period, then the Covered
12
Packet Pg. 45

Property shall be considered to be in compliance. To show compliance with this
pathway, the Owner must provide copies of the institutional comprehensive plan,
institutional energy management plan, and the completed institution-wide
greenhouse gas inventory for buildings for the compliance period.
(b) Laboratories and Affordable Housing and pre-existing Residential:
(i) Laboratories and Affordable Housing shall have the option to comply with the
following alternative compliance schedule:
1. Compliance Period 1: 2027 to 2033; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 66.7% of the default Baseline
2. Compliance Period 2: 2034 to 2040; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 33.3% of the default Baseline
3. Compliance Period 3: 2041 to 2049; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 16.6% of the default Baseline
4. Compliance Period 4: 2050 onwards; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions are
net zero.
(ii) Laboratory and Affordable Housing owners choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit documentation to the Department showing
that the Covered Property qualifies as a Laboratory or Affordable Housing at the
start of each 5-year compliance period.
(iii) Laboratory and Affordable Housing choosing to follow the alternative compliance
schedule shall submit a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan to the
Department four years prior to the start of each alternative compliance period
detailing how the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirement for that
compliance cycle will be met.
(iv) For newly constructed Laboratories and Affordable Housing that choose to follow
the alternative compliance schedule and receive an initial Certificate of
Occupancy after the start of the default Baseline years, the Baseline shall be the
average Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the first two full calendar years following
the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. Such Laboratories and Affordable
Housing shall be exempt from the requirements of 8.67.100 for the seven years
following the conclusion of this Baseline period. The performance requirements
for each subsequent seven-year period shall be determined by a linear reduction
to net zero emissions by 2050.
(v) For Laboratories and Affordable Housing that request an alternative Baseline
pursuant to 8.67.100 (2), the adjusted performance requirements shall be as
follows; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will not exceed the indicated
percentage of the alternative Baseline:
