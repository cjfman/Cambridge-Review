COUNCILLOR AZEEM

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

The Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) has so far generated a healthy pipeline of six
projects since it was first ordained in 2020; and

WHEREAS:

Though there is much to celebrate about the work that has been done, two years of
implementation have also revealed that the somewhat inflexible dimensional
requirements of the AHO have proven to be more of an obstacle than expected; and

WHEREAS:

The recent annual report revealed ten instances where affordable housing providers
“decided not to pursue” and four instances where they actually made an offer but it was
rejected; and

WHEREAS:

The proposal to build 49 affordable units at 2072 Mass Ave was not able to take
advantage of the AHO and was withdrawn in August 2021 after it became apparent
that a feasible version of the project wouldn’t be approved under 40B; and

WHEREAS:

It is clear that some refinements to the AHO would result in more new affordable
housing and fewer missed or stalled opportunities; and

WHEREAS:

Offering substantially relaxed dimensional requirements on a citywide network of
corridors and squares will allow more projects to advance, especially considering the
recent linkage fee increase; and

WHEREAS:

Permitting additional height when green area open space is protected or expanded will
add flexibility and expand options around providing such space without sacrificing any
affordable housing production; and

WHEREAS:

The active affordable housing developers in Cambridge are in agreement that these
changes will make a big difference; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council refer the attached zoning petition to the Housing and
Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration
Committees

the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement, or may be reduced
to the average of the front yard setbacks of the four (4) nearest pre-existing principal buildings
that contain at least two Stories Above Grade and directly front the same side of the street as the
AHO Project, or may be reduced to a minimum of ten (10) feet in the case of an AHO Project on
a corner lot. Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth different requirements for
residential and non-residential uses, the non-residential front yard setback requirement shall apply
to the entire AHO Project if the Ground Story contains a non-residential use as set forth
in Section 11.207.4 Paragraph (b) above; otherwise, the residential front yard setback shall
apply.no minimum front yard setback requirement.
(c) Side Yards. An AHO Project shall have a minimum side yard setback of seven and one-half (7.5)

rear yard setback set forth in the District Dimensional Standards for residential uses that is not
derived by formula if it is less restrictive. For all other AHO projects, no minimum rear yard
setback is required.
(e) Projecting eaves, chimneys, bay windows, balconies, open fire escapes and like projections which
do not project more than three and one-half (3.5) feet from the principal exterior wall plane, and
unenclosed steps, unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet
beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above Grade, may
extend beyond the minimum yard setback.
(f) Bicycle parking spaces, whether short-term or long-term, and appurtenant structures such as
coverings, sheds, or storage lockers may be located within a required yard setback but no closer
than seven and one-half (7.5) feet to an existing principal residential structure on an abutting lot.
11.207.5.2.4 Open Space
(a) Except where the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement or as
otherwise provided below, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area for an AHO Project
shall be thirty percent (30%). However, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area may be

(b)

(c)
(d)

(e)

(f)

reduced to no less than fifteen percent (15%) if the AHO Project includes the preservation and
protection of an existing building included on the State Register of Historic Places.
The required open space shall be considered Private Open Space but shall be subject to the
limitations set forth below and shall not be subject to the dimensional and other limitations set forth
in Section 5.22 of this Zoning Ordinance. Private Open Space shall exclude parking and driveways
for automobiles.
All of the required open space that is located at grade shall meet the definition of Permeable Open
Space as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.

accessible to all occupants of the building.
For the purpose of this Affordable Housing Overlay, area used for covered or uncovered bicycle
parking spaces that are not contained within a building shall be considered Private Open Space.
In any AHO project where pre-existing contiguous Green Area Open Space will be preserved
and/or expanded, or new Green Area Open Space will be created, in excess of what would
otherwise be required for the project, including through consolidation and/or relocation of some
portion of the Green Area Open Space to another part of the lot, without reducing the size of any
contiguous portion, the project may exceed the applicable height limit without restriction,
provided that the maximum possible FAR for the lot shall not be exceeded. If the AHO project is
not subject to an FAR restriction, the effective FAR not to be exceeded under this provision shall
be calculated using the dimensional requirements that apply to the AHO project, including the
original height restriction and open space requirements.

(b) Front Yards. An AHO Project shall have a minimum front yard setback of 15 feet, except where
the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement, or may be reduced
to the average of the front yard setbacks of the four (4) nearest pre-existing principal buildings
that contain at least two Stories Above Grade and directly front the same side of the street as the
AHO Project, or may be reduced to a minimum of ten (10) feet in the case of an AHO Project on
a corner lot. Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth different requirements for
residential and non-residential uses, the non-residential front yard setback requirement shall apply
to the entire AHO Project if the Ground Story contains a non-residential use as set forth
in Section 11.207.4 Paragraph (b) above; otherwise, the residential front yard setback shall
apply.no minimum front yard setback requirement.
(c) Side Yards. An AHO Project shall have a minimum side yard setback of seven and one-half (7.5)

beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above Grade, may
extend beyond the minimum yard setback.
(f) Bicycle parking spaces, whether short-term or long-term, and appurtenant structures such as
coverings, sheds, or storage lockers may be located within a required yard setback but no closer
than seven and one-half (7.5) feet to an existing principal residential structure on an abutting lot.
11.207.5.2.4 Open Space
(a) Except where the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement or as
otherwise provided below, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area for an AHO Project
shall be thirty percent (30%). However, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area may be

reduced to no less than fifteen percent (15%) if the AHO Project includes the preservation and
protection of an existing building included on the State Register of Historic Places.
The required open space shall be considered Private Open Space but shall be subject to the
limitations set forth below and shall not be subject to the dimensional and other limitations set forth
in Section 5.22 of this Zoning Ordinance. Private Open Space shall exclude parking and driveways
for automobiles.
All of the required open space that is located at grade shall meet the definition of Permeable Open
Space as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
The required open space shall be located at Grade or on porches and decks that are no higher than the
floor elevation of the lowest Story Above Grade, except that up to twenty five percent (25%) of the
required open space may be located at higher levels, such as balconies and decks, only if it is
accessible to all occupants of the building.
For the purpose of this Affordable Housing Overlay, area used for covered or uncovered bicycle
parking spaces that are not contained within a building shall be considered Private Open Space.
In any AHO project where pre-existing contiguous Green Area Open Space will be preserved
and/or expanded, or new Green Area Open Space will be created, in excess of what would
otherwise be required for the project, including through consolidation and/or relocation of some
portion of the Green Area Open Space to another part of the lot, without reducing the size of any
contiguous portion, the project may exceed the applicable height limit without restriction,
provided that the maximum possible FAR for the lot shall not be exceeded. If the AHO project is
not subject to an FAR restriction, the effective FAR not to be exceeded under this provision shall
be calculated using the dimensional requirements that apply to the AHO project, including the
original height restriction and open space requirements.

What the current AHO has accomplished
The current AHO was passed on October 5, 2020. There are currently
596 100% affordable housing units being built under the AHO:
● 107 units at 52 New Street
● 278 units at Jefferson Park
● 103 units at Walden Square
● 46 units at 49 Sixth Street

● 62 units at 116 Norfolk Street

Packet Pg. 19

Isn’t this a “radical” change? Why are these
amendments needed?
● Yes. It is radical in the sense that it is bold. We have a housing
emergency that is not going to be solved by nibbling around the edges.
● According to the Cambridge Housing Authority, there are currently over
20,000 people on the affordable housing waiting list. Of those 20,000,
over 7,000 of them live and/or work in Cambridge.
● We are nowhere close to being on track to reaching our Envision goals
which state that we need to build 12,500 housing units by 2030.

Packet Pg. 20

Attachment: AHO Amendments Presentation (002) (COF 2023

Envision goals include:
● Change zoning to enable more housing, including affordable housing,
to be built along major corridors, squares, and in other areas that have
the capacity to accommodate growth and are well served by transit
● Offer density bonuses and relief from other dimensional regulations
for fully affordable housing developments through a citywide
affordable housing overlay or other regulatory mechanism.
● Act to ensure deed-restricted affordable housing is created to provide
housing options for low-, moderate-, and middle-income household
● Help residents remain in Cambridge in the face of rising costs and
demographic change.

116 Norfolk - CHA
62 units of permanent supportive housing, 3.5 stories tall on addition next to 4story existing building, 44% open space

Under proposed Green Space language, we could have studied two scenarios
that resulted in better design:
● +1 floor, 4.5 stories total on addition, we could have gained 4 units and
increased open space by 4% (+~930 SF) to 48%
● +2 floors, 5.5 stories tall on addition, we could have gained 9 units and
increased open space by 6% (50% open space)
● The added flexibility of the proposed AHO language would increase height
for larger setbacks, more open space, and more units

Jefferson Park Federal - CHA
278 units of family housing, 4 stories tall, all new construction, 31% open space
Under proposed Green Space language, we could have varied the heights in
certain buildings (include one six or seven story building at the back of site) to
result in better design
● Gain up to 16 more units
● Less expensive PSF because fewer elevators would be required across
the property (2 instead of 6) and fewer egress stairs across the property
(shrinking overall SF)
● Increase open space due to smaller building footprints from less
circulation area and/or eliminating a couple of stacks of units with units
made up for in taller, 6-story building

52 New Street - Just A Start
106 affordable apartments and the 1st permitted Affordable Housing Overlay
project

The Resilient Cambridge plan
required that the 1st floor of the
building be raised above ground
level by several feet in order to
be prepared for flood conditions
under the 2070 flood plans. If the
law is updated to raise the height
limit, we could improve the
resiliency of the project without
additional cost and with better
floor-to-ceiling heights.

15 affordable condos
This 15-unit proposed condo
project does not comply with the
AHO (it exceeds the max FAR). It
stalled in the planning and
community process, leading to
the rescinding of a state funding
award. This has left the project in
limbo.

Prospective Just A Start Projects
Increased FAR and height limits of the type included in the proposed AHO
amendment would have enabled Just A Start to be more competitive with
sites we have recently evaluated and pursued. These amendments would
have allowed for more apartments/homes at each of these sites and would
have given us the flexibility to design better projects.

Process thus far
● We are proposing a number of changes to the dimensional requirements of
the AHO ordinance based on feedback we received from affordable housing
developers.
○ We collaborated with CHA, HRI, Just a Start and other affordable
housing developers.
○ One of the main points they brought up was the importance of flexibility
when it came to dimensional requirements within the zoning code.
■ Some sites were too restrictive with height/setbacks/FAR and were
missed opportunities for AHO projects.
