I am hereby recommending that the Cambridge City Council adopt the attached order
authorizing the City Manager on behalf of the City of Cambridge and the Superintendent of
Schools on behalf of Cambridge School Department to enter into a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services
(EOHHS); the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE); and the Department
of Children and Families (DCF) for reimbursement under the Federal Every Student Succeeds
Act (ESSA) through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.
Through the Every Student Succeeds Act, and the Fostering Connections to Success and
Increasing Adoptions Act (Fostering Connections), Title IV-E funding is available to reimburse a
portion of the costs associated with transporting children in foster care to and from their school
of origin.
Students in foster care maintain their right to continue schooling in their home district regardless
of where they may live. The district where the student attends school must provide transportation
from their home community to and from school every day. The reimbursement occurs in the
fiscal year following the year the expense was incurred. In FY20, approximately $25,000 $50,000 was expended for this purpose. The percentage of expenses that will be reimbursed by
the state will likely change from year to year and is unknown at this time.
In order to submit a request for reimbursement for FY20 expenses, the City Council must
authorize the Memorandum of Understanding through a vote and approval, and file an FY20
supplemental cost report with DESE and EOHHS by October 1, 2020

September 21, 2020
Wet-Vacuum Forensic DNA Collection System

1. Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will
collect Surveillance Data.
•

•
•

•

The Wet-Vacuum is a type of DNA collection device. It is proven to collect forensic
evidence when traditional methods (i.e. swabbing, taping, cutting) have failed to
render results. It is advantageous in acquiring touch DNA profiles as well as DNA
profiles from non-traditional porous materials such as paper, clothing, and even
bricks. This method of collection is much more sensitive than swabbing methods and
makes collecting minute amounts of DNA easily feasible.
The Wet-Vacuum is portable to crime scenes and allows for DNA collection from
much larger surface areas than traditional collection methods.
The Wet-Vacuum collection method applies a sterile solution to the surface while
simultaneously vacuuming up the DNA (touch, saliva, urine, blood, and/or seminal
fluid) from the evidence item. Next, the solution and the DNA material are captured
in the attached collection bottle. The collection bottle is filtered and then sent to the
laboratory for processing.
This collection method has proved specifically successful in acquiring DNA profiles
in sexual assault cases that are often difficult by other evidence collection means. For
example, this technology has been successful in obtaining touch DNA from bedsheets
where traditional methods have not yielded viable results. Additionally, revisiting
cold cases where DNA was not deemed suitable in the past, could now be tested
utilizing this system.

2. What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology?
•
•
•

Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative
actions
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders
Evidence collection

3. Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?
•

The Wet-Vacuum DNA Collection Device will be used across the city. The
anticipated deployment date is spring of 2021.

4. What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?
•

This technology is a more efficient and effective means of conducting traditional
methods of evidence collection (i.e. swabbing, taping, cutting), which are already
legally conducted by the Department on a routine basis. Additionally, this technology
is only an evidence collection device, utilized on items that are in lawful police
custody or to which the Department has lawful access. It does not process and/or
analyze any forensic evidence (i.e., generate or compare DNA profiles). As with
traditional methods of evidence collection, any potential forensic evidence is sent to
the state laboratory for criminalistics and DNA testing.

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs,
ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?
•
•
•
•

Initial costs – $41,000
Ongoing maintenance – Collection bottles – $1,000
Personnel costs – Deployment of Crime Scene Services Staff
Source of funds – Department operating budget

In response to the above-mentioned policy orders, the Community Development
Department (CDD) and Department of Public Works (DPW) report the following:
The North Cambridge site containing Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding environs was
recently acquired by IQHQ from GCP Applied Technologies. CDD has reached out
to representatives of IQHQ to schedule a meeting between the new owners of the site
and key City departments. The purpose of this meeting will be to familiarize IQHQ with
the recommendations of the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan;
and to ensure they are aware of the community’s expressed desire to beautify Jerry’s
Pond and improve connections to nearby open spaces and pedestrian and bicycle
facilities, while understanding the environmental hazards and the need to safely
manage the site. The Alewife District Plan outlines recommendations for open space
improvements in the area as well as a zoning framework that could provide incentives
to realize these improvements through development. The Alewife Preparedness Plan
provides strategies to create a prepared and resilient Alewife area that is responsive to
climate change threats including heat, flooding from precipitation and flooding from sea
level rise/storm surge and provides resilience strategies that will need to implemented
with any redevelopment of the site.

Much of the 26-acre site is enclosed by fencing, including Jerry’s Pond (also known as
Jerry’s Pit). Jerry’s Pond is an artificial pond that was created about 1870 from a disused
clay pit. The clay pit was subsequently filled with water and an icehouse was built
around 1907. Though the property was privately owned, Jerry’s Pit was well known as a
neighborhood swimming hole until the Francis J. McCrehan Pool opened in 1961. The
property has housed other uses throughout its history, including manufacturing. Today,
a large portion of the site today is not developed.

Community Development Department

The City anticipates working with IQHQ toward the realization of the vision for the
district at this site. Given the potentially broad scope of open space improvements and
the environmental risks associated with remediation and infrastructure work, discussion
of future improvements would be expected to include property owners, residents, and
other community stakeholders that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.
Over the past two years the City has undertaken numerous improvements to several
areas within its jurisdiction near the Jerry’s Pond site and adjacent to the existing public
recreational open space areas:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Completed significant athletic field improvements at Russell Field.
Designed and worked with the MBTA to address flooding on the pathway to the
MBTA headhouse.
Reconstructed the bus shelter at the Comeau Parking lot.
Cleaned the detention pond and repaired drainage riprap between parking lot
and Jerry’s Pond.
Planted 2 trees in the Comeau Bus Turnaround area. An additional 6 bare root
trees will be planted in this area in the fall.
Planted perennials in the Comeau Bus Turnaround area. Additional spring bulbs
and flowering plants will be planted this fall.
A grove of 20 trees will be planted this fall along pathways and in areas
alongside Jerry’s Pond and playing fields. In addition, an urban
forest reforestation pilot project has been established in Linear Park near the
Harvey Street crossing.
Installed four Big Belly compactors around Comeau Field.
Re-striped crosswalks on Rindge Avenue near the McCrehan Pool to increase
visibility.
Taken additional steps to deter rodent activity, including installation of signage
to discourage feeding of wildlife and work with the Inspectional Services
Department to identify rodent harborage locations and increase rodent control
within the area.

In addition, as initially indicated in the council order response dated August 27th, 2019,
the City has engaged and coordinated with the Department of Conservation and
Recreation (DCR) and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
(MBTA) to encourage improvements to the broader area. The following is an update:
•

DCR agreed to remove a portion of the post fence between the edge of Jerry’s
Pond and Alewife Brook Parkway along Rindge Avenue. This will provide easier
access and facilitate maintenance to this area. The City has indicated to DCR its
willingness to maintain this area.

•

DCR did not support the City’s request to de-pave and plant sections of the
concrete median at the intersection of Rindge Avenue and Alewife Brook
Parkway, due to concerns with sight lines.
The City requested that the MBTA remove the dead Sycamore trees near station
headhouse and consider replanting and establishing maintenance
procedures for new trees. The MBTA indicated that they would work to remove
and replace these trees. We are presently awaiting an update from them and
will forward such to City Council once we receive it.

WHEREAS:

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way that public spaces are
designed and the need for open, outdoor space has dramatically increased; and

WHEREAS:

Local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and it is not clear when restaurants and
retail will be safely able to have close to their full capacity of patrons inside; during
this unknown period, outdoor retail and dining remains an important lifeline; and

WHEREAS:

There have been numerous attempts to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety and slow
traffic in Harvard Square after multiple fatalities have occurred over the past three
years; and

WHEREAS:

Recent studies have shown the myriad benefits that come from the pedestrianization of
city centers, including an increase in commercial activity, and improved street life and
safety; and

WHEREAS:

Cities, including those with a similar climate to Cambridge, such as Burlington,
Vermont and Boulder, Colorado, have permanently closed several blocks of central
city streets creating open spaces for retail, restaurant and resident strolling; and cities
in Europe of all sizes have had success with pedestrianized areas of urban centers; and

WHEREAS:

The Council unanimously passed an order asking for certain streets in Harvard Square
be closed to vehicle traffic on a select number of days during the summer of 2020; now
the idea of having a permanent plan for open space and outdoor dining is appropriate;
and

WHEREAS:

The Envision Cambridge Masterplan states, “By encouraging vibrancy on streets in the
city’s retail districts, Cambridge can ensure these commercial areas continue to meet
the everyday needs of the city’s population. Vibrancy can be fostered both through
street design and retail district programming”; and

WHEREAS:

Moody Street in Waltham has been a vibrant destination over the summer as the entire
street has been closed to vehicle traffic to make space for outdoor dining and retail;
now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Traffic, Parking
and Transportation Department, the Community Development Department, the
Harvard Square Business Association, the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association
and Harvard University on the implementing a pilot program to close some streets on
weekends and possibly weeknights in Harvard Square. Prior to closing, the Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department should conduct extensive outreach to impacted
businesses to ensure that the closures would not prevent deliveries and other essential
operations of those businesses; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager is requested to establish a stakeholder committee to study traffic
impacts of any further to determine if street modifications would work towards
fulfilling city goals; the committee would include representation from Traffic, Parking

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate
crisis; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero
emissions no later than 2050; and

WHEREAS:

In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and

WHEREAS:

All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating,
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor,
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no
later than the end of October.

Curb Cut Application
10 Acorn Park Drive
Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Niranjan:
On behalf of SXC Alewife Hotel, LLC, BSC Group has completed the City of Cambridge’s
online application for a curb cut at 10 Acorn Park Drive to service the AC Marriott Hotel.
The AC Hotel is located within the Cambridge Discovery Park development and currently
has access from Discovery Way, a private way, running parallel to Acorn Park Drive.
The proposed curb cut and driveway have been designed to provide one-way only access
from Acorn Park Drive in accordance with the City of Cambridge requirements and the
comments communicated at our site meetings in order to improve site access for hotel guests
and deliveries, and to provide improved emergency vehicle access to the Hotel.
Visitors to the Hotel exiting Route 2 via the Alewife Station Access Road currently travel
along Acorn Park Drive to Discovery Way in order to access the Hotel. The proposed drive
will have improved wayfinding and access to the Hotel by providing direct access to the
Hotel from Acorn Park Drive, including for ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency
vehicles.
We are available to discuss further at your convenience anytime. Please do not hesitate to
contact our office with any questions or inquiries you may have. I can be reached at
dbiancavilla@bscgroup.com or at 617-896-4347 or my cell phone: 978-857-0513.

Very truly yours,
BSC Group, Inc.

of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or

Formatted: Not Highlight

Requirements

A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment.
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City

Packet Pg. 91

3.6.b

Attachment: Amended Language as of June 10, 2020 (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane
with Adequate Directionality.
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided however, that all such Separated Bicycle
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or
(b) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025.
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a),
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided,
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has
commenced prior to December 31, 2025.
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-byblock analysis determining the impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated
Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.

Packet Pg. 92

Attachment: Amended Language as of June 10, 2020 (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

3.6.b

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a oneyear extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality
along
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street,
within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or QuickBuild Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three
years of the submission of the impacts analysis.
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment.
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound,
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager

Packet Pg. 93

shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year.
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however,
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance
shall also be uploaded to such website.
J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall

3.6.c

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a oneyear extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality
along
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or QuickBuild Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three
years of the submission of the impacts analysis.
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment.
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:

Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year.
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however,
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance
shall also be uploaded to such website.
J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall
vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take place by July
1, 2022.
K. Until July 1, 2022 if the City Manager determines that unavoidable delays in public outreach
activities due to the coronavirus pandemic make the deadline contained in subsection C
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadline by up to four months.
For any such proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the

Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO
Project shall comply with the following procedure, which is
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and
staff input into the design of the project.
(a)
The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance
the City’s desired outcomes for the form and character of
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more
affordable housing units, AHO Projects are permitted to
have a greater height, scale, and density than other
developments permitted by the zoning for a given district.
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that
are compatible with the existing neighborhood context or
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area.
(b)
The City’s “Design Guidelines for Affordable Housing
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines
established for the part of the city in which the AHO
Project is located, are intended to inform the design of
AHO Projects and to guide the Planning Board’s
consultation and report as set forth below. It is intended
that designers of AHO Projects, City staff, the Planning
Board, and the general public will be open to creative
variations from any detailed provisions set forth in such
objectives and guidelines as long as the core values
expressed are being served.
(c)
At least two community meetings shall be scheduled at a
time and location that is convenient to residents in
proximity to the project site. The Community Development
Department (CDD) shall be notified of the time and
location of such meetings, and shall give notification to
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or
private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which
the AHO Project is proposed and to any individual or
organization who each year files with CDD a written
request for such notification, or to any other individual or
organization CDD may wish to notify.
(i)
The purpose of the first community meeting shall be
for the developer to share the site and street context
analysis with neighborhood residents and other
interested parties prior to building design, and
receive feedback from community members.
(ii)
The purpose of the subsequent community
meeting(s) shall be to present preliminary project
designs, answer questions from neighboring
residents and other interested members of the
public, and receive feedback on the design. The

(a)

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance
the City’s desired outcomes for the form and character of
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more
affordable housing units, AHO Projects are permitted to
have a greater height, scale, and density than other
developments permitted by the zoning for a given district.
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that
are compatible with the existing neighborhood context or
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area.

(b)

The City’s “Design Guidelines for Affordable Housing
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines
established for the part of the city in which the AHO
Project is located, are intended to inform the design of
AHO Projects and to guide the Planning Board’s
consultation and report as set forth below. It is intended
that designers of AHO Projects, City staff, the Planning
Board, and the general public will be open to creative
variations from any detailed provisions set forth in such
objectives and guidelines as long as the core values
expressed are being served.

(c)

At least two community meetings shall be scheduled at a
time and location that is convenient to residents in
proximity to the project site. The Community Development
Department (CDD) shall be notified of the time and
location of such meetings, and shall give notification to
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or
private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which
the AHO Project is proposed and to any individual or
organization who each year files with CDD a written
request for such notification, or to any other individual or
organization CDD may wish to notify.
(i)

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be
for the developer to share the site and street context
analysis with neighborhood residents and other
interested parties prior to building design, and
receive feedback from community members.

(ii)

The purpose of the subsequent community
meeting(s) shall be to present preliminary project
designs, answer questions from neighboring
residents and other interested members of the
public, and receive feedback on the design. The
date(s), time(s), location(s), attendance, materials
presented, and comments received at such

Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance
MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER

KEY
Language additions are underlined
Language deletions are shown with strikethrough text.

Introduction:

When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the
City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development
community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by
City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City
and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing “Blue Garage” within
the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site
is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex
technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only
the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing
plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling
interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to
provide financial support for this alternative location.
The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning
Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation
of the Eversource substation to the BXP site. Corresponding changes will also be required to
the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility
infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and
make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site.

1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:
14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility
uses designed primarily to serve development within the District.
2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below:
14.32.1

The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum
of (i) three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred
seventy three thousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000)
square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section
14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed four million, two hundred seventy three
thousand (4,273,000) five million, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty
thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of three million, six hundred seventy

Packet Pg. 153

4.1
three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) in
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to
Section 14.72.
At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses
shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the “Ames Street District”
and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the “Ames Street Residential
Project”). The commencement of construction for the Ames Street Residential Project,
approved by special permit in 2015, shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA in
excess of three million and seventy-three thousand (3,073,000) square feet, other than the
60,000 square feet of commercial space that may be permitted by special permit pursuant to
Section 14.72.3.
Additionally, the commencement of construction of a second residential project of at least
200,000 square feet shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA utilizing Infill GFA
(as defined in Section 14.32.2 below) in excess of three hundred and seventy-five thousand
(375,000) square feet.
Additionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of at least four hundred
thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a
building permit for any project utilizing Substation Commercial GFA (as defined in Section
14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at least four hundred
thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently with, the design
review process for any project utilizing Substation Commercial GFA, in accordance with a
special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below.
3. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2:
Any additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the existing Concept
Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as amended by Amendment #1
(Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the “Existing Concept Plan”) may only be utilized
in conjunction with the development by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its
successors and assigns) of a substation within the District (“the Substation Project”) and only
on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate thereof) that provided the land
on which the Substation Project is to be developed. For the purposes of this Article, the eight
hundred thousand (800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the
subject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as “Substation
Commercial GFA”. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project shall precede
or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing
Substation Commercial GFA.

4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text:
14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements:

coordination and consistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square
Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (“K2 Guidelines”) and the Volpe Working Group’s
Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the “Volpe Guidelines”).
5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text:
14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special permit approving a Concept
Plan upon finding that the new development identified within the plan meets the criteria for
approval of a Planned Unit Development set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning
Ordinance and the criteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section
19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall consider the objectives
set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study ("K2 Plan") K2
Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines and the Kendall Square Design Guidelines. The approval
of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable project review requirements of Article
19.000, and no additional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new
development that is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location
of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of the
Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special permit approving a
Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable regulations governing the construction
of such projects).

6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5:
d) Inapplicability to Substation Commercial GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing
Substation Commercial GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing Substation Commercial GFA
be entitled to utilize Innovation Space in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section
14.32.6(3) below).

7. Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following text:
2) Residential Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi-family
residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the building floor area.
3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty percent (20%) of
the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology Manufacturing Uses or one hundred five
thousand (105,000) square feet. In order for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the
Aggregate GFA limitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space
utilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be set aside as
below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to qualifying tenants for shortterm leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b).

8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection
14.32.6:
7)

Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from Aggregate GFA calculation
as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio. Further, substation construction shall not
constitute Infill GFA (or Substation Commercial GFA).

8)

Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of
educational, health or workforce training facilities operated to provide services to the general
public (as opposed to private facilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of

commercial buildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of right
within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 or may otherwise be
permitted by special permit.
9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33:
Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there shall be no
maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA (including Substation Commercial
GFA). However, the District Development Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply.
10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text:
14.34

Building Height Limitation.
The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet, except
for the area of the District more than four hundred and fifty (450) feet north of the centerline of
Broadway, where the maximum building height for any portion of a building in such area shall
be two hundred (200) feet. Up to two (2) mixed-use buildings may reach three hundred and
fifty (350) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty (250)
feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of
any portion of a building above two hundred and fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve
thousand (12,000) square feet.
The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet.

hundred (12,500) square feet.

11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text:
14.38

Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings utilizing fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where that ground floor fronts onto Main Street,
Broadway or Ames Street, must be occupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as
listed in Section 14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open),
along a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building façade along this
frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty percent (40%) for any building
with a façade length of one hundred (100) feet or less along such frontage onto Main Street,
Broadway or Ames Street. Dimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the
Planning Board upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are consistent
with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively, if a Concept Plan provides for
the redevelopment of existing buildings to include new Retail and Consumer Service uses
along the ground floor of any of the identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may
permit a reduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings for up to
fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage provided in existing buildings and
only if the Board finds that it results in a better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and
financial institutions shall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of
meeting this requirement.

12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text:
14.39 Letter of Commitment.

It is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015
by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby declared null and void and of no
further force or effect, and shall no longer be binding upon Boston Properties Limited
Partnership or its successors and assigns.
13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text:
14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are no minimum parking
requirements for new development in the District. Residential development shall provide at a
minimum 0.4 0.25 automobile parking spaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall
be restricted from constructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District, beyond
the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than one category of use,
then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for
each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number,
only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve
arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or
otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated
parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study.
14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text:
14.52.3

The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between
the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces
in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the
spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand
(1,000) two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being
provided, measured from property edge to property edge). The total number of parking spaces
leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the
maximum allowances provided for in Table 2.

15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text:

14.52.6

Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this
Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept
Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for
individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus
planning approach toward bicycle parking.
14.52.6.1
Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District
while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and
sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2.
Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the substation project, the
bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a
comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space
constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level.
14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following
strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3:
a)

Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle
Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five
hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public
street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement
with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle

Packet Pg. 157

4.1
Sharing Station(s) are provided, each bicycle dock within that station may count for
up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces.
Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system
by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing
system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by
providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage
and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing
storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage
space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space
b)

Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and
commercial uses having different peak parking demand times, multiple buildings
may share parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet from each other. A
shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for
both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a
campus plan.

c)

Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a
valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to
utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board’s
approval a plan describing:

i.

The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be
required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section
6.100).

ii.

The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking
spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other
pertinent information.

When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet
the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must
either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the
bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the
Planning Board for an alternative approach.
The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the
Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of
bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning
Board.

September 17, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council,
The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) Board respectfully submits to the City Council the
attached amendment to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan (KSURP) and accompanying petition
to amend Article 14 of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the
KSURP.
As you know, early last year, Eversource announced plans for a new electrical substation to be located
at 135 Fulkerson Street. The City Council held multiple hearings to learn more about the substation
proposal, wherein the City learned of the significant community concerns regarding the Fulkerson site
for a substation and its proximity to homes, the Kennedy Longfellow Elementary School and its
accompanying playing fields. The City Manager promptly brought together City and Cambridge
Redevelopment Authority (CRA) staff along with representatives from the local development community
to seek alternative sites for the facility. Shortly after these meetings, Boston Properties (BXP)
approached the CRA with a conceptual idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing “Blue
Garage” within the KSURP area. This alternative electrical substation location would move this
regional infrastructure facility out of the residential neighborhood and into the commercial district of
Kendall Square.
Throughout 2020, the CRA, along with BXP and Eversource, have organized multiple virtual community
meetings and discussions, to outline the substation alternative and the accompanying commercial
development proposal required to finance the project. The CRA Board has discussed the project
monthly at its public board meetings, held remotely since April. In addition to the substation’s
conceptual design, the meetings discussed above have involved extensive review of the proposed
800,000 square feet of additional commercial development required to implement the relocation of the
substation to the Blue Garage property, and the changes to the MXD Zoning and KSURP needed to
allow the project to move forward.
This community engagement process, described in greater detail below, led to the public meeting of the
CRA Board held last night on September 16, 2020. At this meeting, the CRA Board voted to file the
enclosed petition to modify Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance - Mixed Use Development
District: Kendall Center (MXD Zoning) for consideration by the City Council in order to implement this
alternative substation location. The CRA Board further voted to approve Amendment No. 11 to the
Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan, and to forward this Amendment to the City Council.
The purpose of this letter is to provide an overview of the alternative substation proposal, summarize
the proposed revisions to the MXD Zoning contained within the petition, and review the KSURP
Amendment.
Alternative Substation Site Project Description
The alternative substation site is located on Parcel Two of the Cambridge Center Development Area,
positioned between Binney Street, Galileo Galilei Way and Broadway. The technical and site feasibility
challenges of the alternative substation location are complex, and for the past year, Eversource and
BXP have been working to confirm that the structural engineering, electrical line routing, existing asset
relocation, and overall site design of the alternate Parcel Two substation location were feasible. The
designs not only require the relocation of existing structures and uses, but also reconstituting the

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Hello!
I am a Cambridge Citizen sending a quick email about the bicycle safety ordinance that will have its final vote on
October 5th. I wanted in particular to vote my support for including Cambridge St within the ordinance to have a
protected bike lane and to support Harvard Square being more pedestrian friendly.
I live two blocks away from Cambridge St (on Thorndike St) and I know that many large trucks, vehicles and buses come
down that street. It is near Lechmere and the highway and is a major thoroughfare for Cambridge commuters. A
protected bike lane would make those commuters much safer, provide pedestrians some space and I think make the
street more friendly overall. In terms of parking there are already many places to park nearby already (like the mall and
galleria). I see people walking around everyday just like me, so I think encouraging the bike and foot traffic would be
beneficial. It would certainly make me feel safer and that is a road I often bike to Inman Square or Union Square.
As for Harvard - I know that there is a struggle to keep some of our local businesses there but what has always made
Harvard Square is it's lively foot traffic and busy days. Empty store-fronts and more large trucks are not the way to go. By
making it more peaceful and safe for pedestrians (and giving them more room and discouraging the somewhat
ridiculous amount of traffic there) would encourage keeping the square the local hotspot we all love (at least in my
humble opinion). I have fond memories of wandering around Harvard Square and the blessed but departed Curious
George Book Store as a child. I hope other family's can make similar memories and feel safe doing so there. Harvard also
has it's large student population - plenty of whom come from out of town. Making the square a welcome, comfortable
and safe area for all would reflect well on Cambridge and preserve a beloved local spot.
Thank you for listening. Also I wanted to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern,
Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan for their continuing support and effort on this ordinance and making
Cambridge safer and friendlier to alternative modes of transportation. We see and appreciate all your efforts!
Best,
Adonica Camp

City Manager

Government Operations Committee:
I understand the current City Manager has requested an extension
to his contract. I do not support an extension or reappointment
because Mr. DePasquale has not fulfilled his fiscal obligations to
the citizens of Cambridge.
I propose offering the current city manager a 6-month extension only so
the Council can implement a thorough, formal and open evaluation
of the Manager, based on the stated goals of the City Council.
Please ensure the City of Cambridge has the best candidate for the City Manager
position. Important factors for consideration before selecting a new (or renew) City
Manager:
1) update the City Council goals
2) establish criteria for success by which to evaluate candidate
3) evaluate manager by using City Council goals AND require public input
4) commence national search for City Manager (have a pool of qualified candidates
instead of just defaulting to the current City Manager); selection committee should include
city employees and Cambridge citizens
5) follow protocol for hiring School Super Intendant (job posting, recruiting, committee
review)
Please confirm receipt of this email.
Thank you,

Dear City Clerk, please add the following item to the next City Council Meeting as a Communication.Thank you.
Yours In Peace

Concerned Cambridge Citizen

"Cambridge Black American Doctor Rev. Dr.
Robert A. Bennett, Jr. Forced Out of His
Home."
"Retired Black American Cambridge Episcopal Divinity School Professor/
Harvard Doctorate is a Victim of Local Systematic Racism!"
What is most amazing about all of this is the multiple and continuing lies – most told under oath by people
working for a state agency; by attorneys; by their clients. Are these called “grifters”.
The elderly are so badly treated in Probate and Family Court that motions are filed in their name – without their knowledge –
without their consent and everyone acting as though this is fine and the way things are and should be done in Court.
It might surprise you, but many elderly people are perfectly able to talk, think, write, walk, dance, run and more and yet they are
portrayed as “incapacitated.” That word is used in many cases to keep the elderly from appearing in Court so they will not
contradict the story line being used to gain access to and spend down their assets.
What follows is a notarized statement by Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett in response to papers he and his family were given by
strangers who got them from someplace – and thank God for such caring people.
These are motions and other such papers filed in Court under Robert Bennett’s name about which he knew nothing, which were
not signed by Robert Bennett, some were undersigned by his Court Appointed attorney who has never contacted him; never
talked to him neither in person nor on the phone nor by email. Their first contact was when Robert Bennett started motioning the
Court for the removal of this Court appointed attorney.
We will let these papers stand on their own because we want you to know what Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett and his wife, Marceline
Donaldson, are going through. We want you to know every detail because others are going through the same thing. We received
calls, and other contacts from people who are desperate and who have been made destitute when they spent their lives
accumulating a “nest egg” for their old age and something to pass along to their children. That “nest egg” seems to be the
reason for all of this. It is no accident that this started against the Donaldson/Bennett’s shortly after they put their house on the
market for sale and they changed their minds and took it off the market. And then all hell broke loose.

5.3.a
_________________________________

I am attaching documents that were filed in my name with Middlesex Probate and Family Court. One claim of these documents
was that I am “indigent”.
1) “Order Appointing Counsel” was filed 3/5/2020 claiming “elder abuse”.
I knew nothing about this document. I did not request an attorney be appointed on my behalf. I knew nothing about this action
and I did not know nor had ever heard of Cheri Myette. Over the months that followed Cheri Myette did not contact me; did not
answer my contact to her which included telephone calls and emails. Nor did she respond to my wife’s telephone calls and
emails to her. She was apparently appointed as a space saver so other attorneys could not represent me and motions I filed on
my own behalf would not be heard by nor taken seriously by the Court because I had a Court appointed attorney.
Attorney Myette was appointed in an “ex parte” hearing on March 6, 2020. She filed motions which claimed many things which
are lies and apparently meant to further the case of Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services’ attempt to take over
my life; to make the end of my life miserable; to incarcerate me in a nursing home with restraints on a steady diet of antipsychotic medications; to make and then keep me “incapacitated” and more – things they have done to other African Americans.
Protective Services Agencies in other areas of Massachusetts besides Boston/Cambridge partnering with attorneys in
Massachusetts have done similar things to Jews, African Americans, immigrants and other minorities.
2) A form entitled ” Motion for Funds for Independent Examination.”
I knew nothing about this motion. This was not done on my behalf by anyone. This was done to further the goals of the “grifters”
trying to strip me of any assets I might have.
I was forced out of my home on March 3, 2020 by the Cambridge police with an order signed by Dr. Rebecca Warner,
psychiatrist who said in the Section 12 she filed against me that “she never met me, never examined me, never visited by home
but was signing a Section 12 to have me picked up, forced into Mount Auburn Hospital to be “sectioned”.
3) I refused to go. The police were very clear, if I did not go I would be picked up by them and forcibly put into the ambulance
waiting outside for me.
4) My wife asked why was I being forced to go to Mount Auburn Hospital when I was just discharged two days prior from MGH.
The police did not know, but if that made a difference they would take me to MGH instead.
5) I was taken to MGH against my will.
6) I was discharged from MGH on March 4th at 3:30am with the Section 12 “lifted” and told I could go home.
7) My wife and I went home.
8. On March 6th I was forced into MGH again by the Cambridge Police and this time supposedly on a charge of “elder abuse.”
The claim included several things which basically said I was being “medically abused” by my wife. It claimed I was the one
making the claim.
This motion says I swore to several things – I did not know anything about this motion and I swore to nothing. What they have
me swearing to is a lie and I believe was conjured up so they could go after my assets as they have gone after the assets of
other African Americans, Jews, immigrants and other minorities, after they have gone through a process of making those
minorities “incapacitated” or as close to “incapacitated” as possible.
They used the charge of “elder abuse” to send the police to take me out of a house I lived in for 36 years with a wife I was
married to for 37 years. They had to get me out of the house “immediately” because my life and health were at stake.
This motion says “In support hereof the Respondent swears and avers that: 1. He is indigent

Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett’s statement – sworn to and notarized

Packet Pg. 266

5.3.a
I am not indigent and I did not swear to any such thing. Yesterday was the first time I saw that motion – dated March 6, 2020.

2. The motion continues: “He has a right under the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions to the services of a clinician
at the Commonwealth’s expense where, as here, the Commonwealth seeks to deprive a Respondent of a substantial liberty
interest as a result of its allegations as to his mental status and need for inpatient psychiatric care and treatment. See, Are v.
Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985).
I knew nothing about this. My liberty was forcibly taken away from me twice by Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective
Services without cause and without a hearing – or rather my liberty was taken after an ex parte hearing requested by Somerville
Cambridge Elder and Protective Services without my foreknowledge and without my request.
I did not contact them nor did I ask for help on any level. I was well taken care of by my wife, adult children and the community
surrounding us. They made allegations as to my mental status without proof of any kind.
SCES did this to promote their services and to force African Americans into their agency forcing me and others to accept what
we did not need nor want.
3. In the alternative, the Court must, pursuant too G.L. c.261, article 27C, authorize the expenditure of funds necessary to
secure such services where, as here, such services are reasonably necessary to assure that Respondent is able to prosecute
this action in as effective manner as would be available to a person of means. Commonwealth v. Lockley, 381 Mass. 156
(1980). In respect thereto, Respondent further asserts that it cannot reasonably be argued that a person of means, facing the
possibility of the involuntary Pilgrim Rehabization, would ever knowingly choose not to expend his funds to secure the
assistance of an independent clinical expert. See e.g. Guardianship of a Mentally Ill Person, Mass. App. Ct. No. 85-0018 Civ.
(Dreben J. 1/28/85).
This was especially amazing since such an independent clinical expert had done such a job and “lifted” the Section 12 and sent
me home. SCES, Attorney O’Sullivan and their group were not going to let go because they thought my assets were too
tempting nor to raid and destroy.
Again I reiterate I knew nothing about this. No one determined that I was mentally ill. In fact, MGH psychiatrists made the
determination that the Section 12 was lifted which was filed by Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services and
Attorney James O’Sullivan – which they have done against African Americans, Jews, immigrants and others in the past. In other
words, MGH psychiatrist found I was not mentally ill and there was no reason for my having been picked up and forced into the
hospital. The motion ends with WHEREFORE it is respectfully requested that the above Motion be allowed. It also says on the
signature lines “Respectfully submitted, Robert Bennett, By his attorney s/s Cheri Myette”
Again, I have never met Cheri Myette. I had never spoken to her. I had no idea these folks were running into Court to get this
motion against me to take away my freedom. This was done in my name without my knowledge or consent and I was totally
capable of giving both.
They took it upon themselves to accuse my wife of abusing me because that allowed them to send the police to take me out of
my home once again and to continue on with what I consider a criminal conspiracy which has been practiced against many by
the same people and others across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
On March 4, 2020 at 3:30 am I was discharged from MGH with “no medicines prescribed” yet as a result of this motion they filed
the abuse charge against my wife. SCES claimed that “It is alleged that Mr. Bennett’s medical needs are not being met in part,
he may not be taking his prescribed medications.
They did not tell the Court that Robert Bennett was discharged with “no medicines prescribed.” So what does all of the above
mean?
The “Temporary Order” also claims Robert Bennett needs “appropriate supervision”. needs rehab; needs medical follow-up; etc.
etc.
What they did not say was the discharge with “no medicines prescribed and all vitals normal including blood pressure made that
a ridiculous decision.

I did not know about this document nor about this motion nor did anyone else in my family know about this or had seen it.

5.3.a

With that choice they sent me to a rehab, nursing home which was under quarantine and did not have the same level of
expertise, etc. that would have been available to me at Spaulding.
Having visited Spaulding when friends were there I was able to see their level of care and rehab that I did not see at Sherrill
House. My choice was taken away from me and my wife, as my Health Care Proxy, was also eliminated from that decision.
When my wife and I visited both places it was clear that Spaulding was white – Sherrill House was brown to black and the way
that was maintained was what I was experiencing with no choice as to which institution I would receive rehab.
I was also forced to accept a visiting nurse/home health care group without having a choice in the matter and in the process of
that I was sexually abused by one of the people who were supposedly giving me better care than my wife could give.
Dr. Rebecca Warner was the psychiatrist who signed the Section 12 which was ‘lifted’ by MGH. That should have settled the
matter. Instead, she continued to be involved pushing the matter and attempting to clearly diagnose me as “incapacitated” and
filling me full of drugs which could have done serious damage to me mentally and physically.
With the Section 12 she was not paid the $2,000 they paid Dr. Rebecca Warner to go to MGH to give me Hallucinatory Drugs,
anti-psychotics with no reason, anti-seizure medications for five weeks on a daily basis which probably has negatively affected
my brain and all the other 8 to 10 drugs I was forced to take. In other words the state paid for Dr. Warner to set me on a program
to incapacitate me so I could then me forced into a nursing home in constraints for the rest of my life.
Dr. Warner’s license should be immediately suspended pending a hearing as to whether her license should be permanently
removed.
That “Temporary Order” is dated March 6, 2020 – the date the police forced their way into my home at 6pm and threatened to
drag my out if I didn’t walk out with them and if they broke anything or had to break the door down they said they had the right to
do that and they would not be financially responsible for any damage done. They also said they had to right to go all through my
home, if that was necessary, to get me to drag me out to put me into the ambulance waiting outside to take me to MGH.
Present when this happened was my wife, Marceline Donaldson. My son, Mark Bennett, his wife Karen Bennett and my
daughter Ann Bennett. But, somehow these African Americans were not adequate to see about my well being and could not
satisfy what the Court thought I needed and forced upon me. What they forced on me were whites replacing the African
American family and community within which I lived.
The person who was supposed to do this “examination of me” was Dr. Rebecca Warner, the psychiatrist who swore out the
Section 12 which put me, against my will in MGH on March 3rd. Dr. Warner is the psychiatrist who said in the Section 12 that
she did not know me, had never met me, had never been to my home yet she forced me out of my home with police and
declared my home of 36 years ‘unsafe’.
To swear this out – to lie under oath saying I requested this motion be allowed when I did not and knew nothing about it violates
every right I have and has destroyed my wife’s reputation.
This has been an unbelievable experience and has shown me clearly one does not have to be involved in claimed criminal
activity to have these horrendous interactions with the police and the Court which were clearly totally unjustified with a clear
attempt to destroy my life, my family, and to see that my assets would be drawn down and turned over to whites instead of being
help in the hands of African Americans. That apparently violates this Court’s ethic. – And yes, I am angry! Wouldn’t you be
angry?
Respectfully Submitted,
s/s Rev. Dr. Robert A. Bennett, Jr.
I did not request, submit, want the above submitted because it is a lie conjured up by Ms. Myette and probably with the help of
Attorney O’Sullivan and Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services. I did not see this document until yesterday when
someone brought it to our house and apparently put it through the mail slot. I had never met Attorney Myette, knew nothing
about her, did not know I needed an attorney.

What the motion also ignored was that SCES was behind forcing me into Sherrill House for rehab as the only place I could go.
My choice was Spaulding, however, I was told Sherrill House was the only place I could go.

When they represented my wife, they omitted crucial facts –
They did not include the fact that the Section 12 had been filed by Dr. Rebecca Warner and lifted because it should not have
been filed in the first place.
They did not let me, my wife nor the Court know the above motion had not been requested, not filed, not wanted by me.

We hired Burns & Levinson to represent me. They did not. They decided on their own to represent my wife instead without our
knowledge or consent. They said they did that because I already had a Court appointed attorney. They did not talk to my wife
about this case except very superficially and they knew they had been hired to represent Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett.

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Good morning, Cambridge City Council,
My name is Grace Wang and I'm a resident on Amory Street. I have just recently started biking around the city, and
have been LOVING this new form of transportation that is energy efficient, COVID-safe, and personally healthy.
As a new city biker, I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form without any changes, and
urge you to please keep protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, including Cambridge St. These
protected bike lanes keep newbies like me feeling safe and secure to bike around.
I'd like to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler,
and Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.
Thanks very much for you time and attention.
Best,
Grace Wang

I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

Hello,
I am writing to voice my support for the full updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form with no changes. For
the past 9 years I've lived in the area and for 7 of those years have utilized Cambridge on my various commutes from
West Medford and Davis Square to downtown Boston. On numerous occasions I've avoided serious injury by being
hyper aware but they were all very avoidable with better bike friendly infrastructure.
As a current resident of Cambridge I am using the streets not only to commute but now to run small errands from the
house. Improved cycling infrastructure makes me feel safer to run these errands and support local business instead of
running out to the suburbs in my car just to find parking.
I would like to voice my deep appreciation to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern,
Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan for their support of the full updated ordinance.
More bike safety means more people on bikes, less traffic, lower CO2 emissions and more pedestrian and bike cycle
traffic in front of small businesses on key streets like Mass ave and Cambridge st.
Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Cambridge City Council,
I am a resident living on Pearl Street, mother of a CPS Kindergartener at King Open, and life-long city bicyclist. We often
bike as a family, and we are encouraged by the continued efforts of the City to support safe, shared roadways for cars,
cyclists & pedestrians. I would therefore like to express my support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its

Cambridge Street - given that it is a busy commercial street with multiple daycares & schools such as King Open &
Cambridge Upper School. I would also like to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone,

Pedestrianize Harvard Square

Dear Councilors,
Our city desperately needs to close the streets surrounding Harvard Square to automobile traffic and promote
pedestrian and bike friendly spaces. I support Policy Order #188 as a first step towards achieving the vision outlined in
the Envision Cambridge Masterplan.
But we need to do more. Precisely the areas where two people were killed in the Square are not slated for
pedestrianization according to the map Attachment A. The entire area around the Kiosk needs to be closed to car traffic
INCLUDING Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle St and JFK (between Mt Auburn & Eliot).

September 14, 2020. AHO Second Reading City Council
As the AHO has its last reading, I hope you- as good stewards and representatives of all citizens,
sincerely read remaining concerns. I wish the council had done a deeper dive into unintended
consequences that could be avoided. Yes, you have the votes, but consideration would signal good
faith instead of impatience and dismissal. The number of meetings (which were a fiasco), and
number of amendments are irrelevant if they enrich the product. This is not death by 1000 cuts. I
also resent being compared to Trump and his suburban fear mongering.
We all want affordable health care but implementation is the conundrum.
There is still no actionable roadmap. How do you implement legislation without knowing how to
measure success and short-comings? We need an INDEPENDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE
at 5 years to review just that. Independent because otherwise, I fear the Council (which may have
changed by then but probably not) and invested organizations may lack objectivity while reviewing
their own potentially entrenched handiwork. Balance between urban form, neighborhood character,
environment and mobility city-wide are mentioned, yet there is impatience with Design details and
architectural context. Details matter.
For example: If a 50 ft building can go to 70 ft “above grade” and go 80 ft as measured from
existing grade, which is it? Developers can’t be left to interpret. There are no checks and balances
and no one is identified as being responsible.
We need to identify building sites, number of units. The City Manager needs to step up with more
money to bridge opportunities. 40- 100 units a year is all that is projected with this blanket bill.
Please consider parking for those working night shifts outside the city; Integrate significant trees into
urban design; Clarify transitions between districts. We need a moratorium on single-family
construction. This particular developer-driven model, complete with potential conflicts of interest is
not the answer especially in a pandemic. There are a number of issues being conflated here and the
AHO can’t remedy them all. What we needed was a broader and smarter analysis of this very real
problem.

I am a Cambridge homeowner and long-time Cambridge resident. I am very much in support of the Affordable Housing
Overlay, as I was last year. I have spent most of my professional life working in affordable housing and I know that
increasing the housing supply in rich communities like Cambridge is one of the only ways to address housing
affordability and income inequality long term. I would be more than willing to see more multifamily housing and more
density in my neighborhood and my city in order to make Cambridge more accessible to people of lesser means. AHO is
a step in the right direction.
I was very disappointed the overlay did not pass last year and I hope it makes it this year.
Thank you,
Jenny Netzer

I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

Hello,
I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form.
I want protected bicycle lanes on all roads in the network. This includes Cambridge St., where I often ride with my
toddler on my bicycle with me. Safety on Cambridge St is critical. I'd travel to businesses on Cambridge St more often if it
had protected bicycle lanes.
I'd also like to thank Mayor Siddiqui and Vice Mayor Mallon for supporting this. Also, I'd like to thank Councillors
Zondervan, Nolan, McGovern, and Carlone for their support of this updated ordinance in its current form.
Thank you,
Eric Silva

AHO follow up - collecting research results

I remain opposed to the AHO as it stands. I am deeply troubled that no amendment was
included, even to protect the rapidly declining Cambridge tree canopy which should not be a
partisan issue.
The community uproar in Roxbury to remove 124 mature trees on Melnea Cass bd was well
justified. Tree removal tends to be associated with low income areas and the densification that
affects them.
Elected officials should be inclusive of ALL voices, beyond the group that elected them.
Giving free rein to developers is extremely concerning. This is not about owners being to do
what they want with their property but about enabling profit making entities.
Beyond this, the pandemic crisis we are experiencing is shaking all our previous assumptions
creating a new framework to address the job and housing challenges.
It would be irresponsible not to take that into consideration.
In researching this I find that the "polycentric" model of urban planning is a viable alternative to
the centralized high rise city that has been touted for a long time as THE solution to energy and
climate crisis as well as the high population growth in parts of the world like India or China.
I am urging you to consider with an open mind the following which looks at including areas away
from the coast, the future of work and a "polycentric" urban development approach. I tried my
best to summarize my findings below in 3 parts: 1) inclusion, 2) COVID-19 and the future of
work and lastly 3) the "polycentric" urban model enabled by a vast array of disruptive
technologies.
1- Inclusion of all at the state level
This country is extremely divided - to say the least - and at the local level we need leaders who
can bring people together.
Would you say no to that?
The 2016 Presidential elections exposed the fact that many living outside cities felt left out. If we
are to define a vision for the future it has to be fully inclusive. Should all the jobs and funds be
limited to the population living by the coast? Should we leave central and western Mass. outside
of the picture while we build urban concentration around Boston itself, essentially expanding
Boston?
Quote from this great article of the rebirth of Lowell:

Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and other Brookings scholars
have observed that a handful of large “techy” metros such as New York, Boston and San
Francisco have flourished in this century, while many, many smaller cities have been left
behind.
He praised Massachusetts — “propelled by its superstar city of Boston”— for pushing against
this problematic divergence and supporting its regional cities. The rationale is fairly obvious: a
state with a Boston and a network of prosperous regional cities will have a stronger
and more equitable economy than one with Boston and struggling mid-sized cities.
Given what Cambridge has to offer it can show leadership in supporting this vision while it still
has the momentum (that may change).
Could we design at the state level an ecosystem that creates hubs so no area will be left out?
2- Impact of COVID-19 on the workplace (and subsequently on housing)
We can't ignore the following in long term planning:
Cambridge growth was fueled by the tech and biotech companies now present in Kendall Sq and
other parts of the city. While biotech requires lab space, employee assigned desks may become
obsolete.
There is a lot of buzz around the future of work as a result of COVID-19 and many tech
companies have already decided to let go of the huge investments in pricey offices (Twitter,
Shopify, Invision, etc). Mark Zuckerberg said that over the course of the next decade half of
Facebook could be working fully remotely.
I visited in January a Boston staffing company (Scout) that was no longer assigning permanent
desks to its employees. Salesforce (over 30,000 employees) has done the same in many offices,
particularly for sales teams (often out visiting customers).
Many US jobs are now tagged as "remote", temporarily or permanently, some require to be in
the same time zone or at least within North America. Global companies may include more as
they have been working multiple time zones.
This vastly expands the talent pool and where you can work from. You could opt for a less
expensive location, thus bringing down prices in previously highly demanded areas where jobs
have been concentrated up until now.
Temporary office space has been around primarily for small businesses and startups but this
could become a standard. A large company could have contracts with a provider across the
country so their employees could meet ad hoc for workshops, and face-to-face syncup with
white boards.
I am old enough to have seen Silicon Valley with empty office buildings after the dot com bubble
burst. I would not be surprised if downtown Boston or Kendall sq buildings would either
experience the same fate or would have to reinvent themselves as "on demand" offices AND
convert some spaces to residential living.
Post COVID McKinsey sees the role of the office as vastly changing: "Currently, the purpose in
most offices—if you look at how much square footage is allocated to different activities—is

Packet Pg. 286

individual work. But if the role of the office is really meant to be about those moments of
collaboration that can't happen remotely, then maybe instead of 80 percent individual work
stations, it should be 80 percent conference rooms."
"Glaeser [Harvard University professor, leading scholar of urban economics] guesses that, at
least in the short run, companies that can survive without offices will continue allowing workers
to work remotely. Freed from having to pay obscene rents in concrete jungles, many of these
workers, Glaeser believes, will move to lower-density college towns like Boulder, Colorado,
or gorgeous vacation destinations like Jackson, Wyoming. There was already an exodus from
increasingly exorbitant big cities to more affordable midsize cities before the
pandemic, and, Glaeser says, if enough remote workers vote with their feet, big companies
may decide to open small offices in such locations once the pandemic is over."
The other critical impact is high unemployment affecting workers who are no longer needed
because the white collar workers are 1) losing jobs as well, 2) moving out or 3) staying home.
[Diane] Swonk [chief economist at Grant Thornton] found that "employment in the information
industry is down 11.4 percent now compared to 7.7 percent during the Great Recession."
"Data suggests that layoffs in white-collar industries are more likely to be permanent than
those in frontline sectors such as restaurants or retail. The so-called core unemployment rate,
which excludes all layoffs that are classified as temporary, has increased more for workers with
more education, even as the unemployment rate has generally increased more rapidly for those
with less education, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by Jed Kolko, Indeed’s
chief economist."
“It’s in those kinds of high-wage cities like New York and San Francisco where low-wage workers
have actually seen the steepest losses, and one reason is because of the decline in
spending in higher-wage households,” Pollak said [labor economist with the job-posting
platform ZipRecruiter].
At the very least we need to pause and consider this landscape before deciding how to invest
and if we give free rein to developers to build what could be increasingly vacant buildings.
Should funding go instead to support those facing eviction and in need of education to adapt to
the jobs that are available.
3- The polycentric urban model and exponential technologies
"To paraphrase Bill Gates: we tend to overestimate the changes that will happen in the short
term and underestimate those in the long term." [World Bank - Top 7 disruptive technologies for
cities]
Advances in information technologies, AI and transportation actually enables a polycentric urban
model that connects urban clusters where social groups develop and where jobs can be more
evenly and equitably distributed across a state or region, relying on a smart, self routing
transportation system that continuously adapts to passengers destinations through a mesh of
smart highways. "
[see the case study for Sydney and other cities] "This de-concentration approach ensured that the cities
could easily access a talented labour pool at universities and other assets located outside the central city."

The high density, high rise, solution is about sharing resources and minimizing energy use but
when self powering buildings and vehicles are within reach and commercial solar windows are
getting to market, the rush to high density loses meaning. Energy is anywhere you need it.
Autonomous trains leveraging this mesh of highways and constantly adapting their routes to the
demand, with a smart AI core to bring people from cluster to cluster is not far fetched at all. The
Travelling Salesman algorithm is an old classic and Uber Pool pretty much works like that only
with a regular car and driver. The subway in Paris has used driverless trains for decades.
This would allow the revitalization of areas inland and more importantly bring housing costs
down where they have increased out of control, thus making it more affordable.
Thank you for reading this far! I hope it helps inform the shifts we are experiencing. I hope to
continue evaluating this approach with experts.

Protected Bike Lanes--Support for the Cycling Safety Ordinance

I am writing in full support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form without any changes. Please
establish protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, including Cambridge St.
I have commuted from JP to Porter Square since 2001 and most days (prior to Covid 19 Working at home), I felt
extremely lucky to have a beautiful commute. I also felt fortunate every time I arrived at my destination unscathed.
Biking in Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville require nerves of steel as cars creep or blast through intersections. It
requires a sixth sense to anticipate and avoid drivers making creative U-turns or last-minute turns without signals.
Anything you can do to make biking a safer experience for novice and experienced riders alike will undoubtedly
save drivers and cyclists from heart-stopping encounters that too often result in near misses, broken bones, missed
work, and sometimes fatal casualties. I thank you so much for taking the well-being of cyclists seriously.
Thank you to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler,
and Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.

Support for updated cycling safety ordinance

To Whom It May Concern,
I am a Cambridge resident and I am emailing to express my strong support for the updated Cycling Safety
Ordinance for protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the bicycle network in Cambridge. As someone who
commutes and exercises frequently by bicycle, good infrastructure is critical to keeping me safe.
In addition, I want to express my general support for pedestrianization of streets in Cambridge. Cambridge has an
enormous density of pedestrians and they are often crammed onto crowded sidewalks while fewer cars occupy the
majority of street real estate. Public spaces should match their use. Specifically, I want to express my strong
support for policy order #4 regarding the pedestrianization of Harvard Square that is on the city council agenda
tonight.
Thank you to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler,
and Zondervan for their support of this proposal.
Best,

Re: September 14, 2020 Calendar Item # 1: Relief Funding for the Arts

Dear Councillors,
I wanted to send my gratitude for the passage of calendar #1 during this week's City Council meeting, allowing arts
organizations to access relief funding. As you know, this funding will be a lifeline both for individual organizations and
for the strong arts culture of Cambridge. It was incredibly powerful to hear artists and patrons from across the city--and
beyond--express the impact of the arts on their mental health, on Central Square businesses, on students in local
schools, and more. Thank you for hearing these voices (truly, it was equally powerful hearing councillors acknowledge
our voices) and thank you for taking action to preserve the arts.

Dear City Council Members,
My name is Bridget Copes and I am writing to urge the Cambridge City Council to allow arts organizations to access the
City's disaster relief fund. I'm a student, performer, and volunteer producer at ImprovBoston. When I moved to
Cambridge amidst the 2015 snowstorms, I didn't expect to stay long. I moved almost every year in my 20s, afterall.
Then I started taking classes at ImprovBoston and this city became my home.
ImprovBoston's teachers gifted me with a creative space that helped me find my voice as an artist and manage my
depression when I was laid off. In the theater community, I found life-long friends and met my partner. While
performing during ImprovBoston's Family Show, I witnessed the absolute joy of our young audience members seeing
their imaginative suggestions come to life onstage...and even getting onstage themselves. It's incredible to watch a
young volunteer go from shy and nervous to speak to beaming as a theater full of families laughs and celebrates their
contribution to the show!
I call Cambridge home because of the arts organizations here and I know I'm not alone. Every arts organization in
Cambridge has created a home for artists and patrons alike. They've created a vibrant city and bolstered patronage at
other small businesses. (I can't count the number of hours I have spent with other performers and students at The
Field, 1360, Veggie Galaxy, Andala, and more.)
The arts need the city's support today to survive. Please provide these organizations with relief funding.
Thank you,

Affordable Housing Zoning Proposal, Nonsensical Report on Transition Requirements,
September 14, 2020 meeting, City Manager Communication 24

Clerk@cambridgema.gov
Mister Clerk:
Would you please transmit this email to the Cambridge City Council in the Communications at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
RE: Affordable Housing Zoning Proposal, Nonsensical Report on Transition Requirements, September 14, 2020 meeting, City
Manager Communication 24
Gentlemen / Ladies:
This communication is simultaneously being provided the Cambridge City Council by email.
Cambridge, contrary to statements from the Development Department, has a district with meaningful protections for neighbors. This
is the Residence C-2B district. These protections were kept secret in this Development Department “Report.”
The following footnote (k) governs in zoning ordinance, section 5.31, providing MEANINGFUL protections. This applies to about
half of Mass. Ave. and side streets between .City Hall and Quincy Square zoned Residence C-2B and to various other locations on
side streets throughout the city zoned Residence C-2B. It is copied, cut and paste, with paragraph indentation. These provisions may
have been modified in the recent Harvard Square upzoning, which of course, has no impact outside of the strikingly large area
included in the Harvard Square Upzoning.
Failure of the Development Department to inform the Cambridge City Council of this responsible part of the Zoning Ordinance is a
distressingly NORMAL failure on the part of the Development Department..
Notice at the very beginning,
In the Residence C-2B District, buildings shall comply with these yard requirements by being set back above and below ground.
This specifically prohibits underground construction to the property line, a highly destructive practice. It was inserted in the Anderson
petition in the late 90's in response to destructive underground construction in the building formerly known as the Inn at Harvard. I
was one of the more visible of the petitioners, and the principle legal draftsman.
The City Council passed the proposal in a manner MORE RESTRICTIVE than we were requesting at the time of the vote. The actual
petition was filed in response to a request by Councilor Duehay during consideration of a typically destructive and, of course,
confusing initiative of the Development Department.
****
(k) Yard Requirements in the Residence C-2B District
1) Setbacks—In the Residence C-2B District, buildings shall comply with these yard requirements by being set back above and below
ground.
2) Green Area—general. Two of the yards on a lot shall consist exclusively of green area as defined in section 2.000. Contrary to the
provisions of said definition, hard surfaced walks and terraces shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the area of each yard. At a
minimum, green area setback shall consist of permanently maintained densely planted trees and shrubs that may be expected to form
within three (3) years after the time of planting a continuous unbroken, year round visual screen. Every effort shall be made to retain
the best existing trees in said setbacks to meet the requirements this section in whole or in part. Plans for landscaping and maintenance

(3) Lots with more than four yards. If the shape of a lot creates a situation where there are more than four yards, this green area
requirement shall apply to half of the yards, rounded up in the instance of an odd number of yards.
(4) Lots in two or more zoning districts. Where a zoning district boundary line or lines split a lot, a lot partially in the Residence C-2B
district shall comply with provisions elsewhere in this zoning ordinance with regard to lots in two or more zoning districts, except that
the setback and green area requirements of this footnote shall apply to all parts of the lot regardless of zoning district.
(5) Lots abutting more restrictively zoned districts. When any lot abuts a more restrictively zoned district or districts, all yards abutting
the more restrictively zoned district)s) shall be designated as yards required to comply with the green area requirements of this
footnote. This provision shall apply to that quantity of abutting yards numbering up to and including the maximum number of green
area yards required by this footnote. The total number of green area yards required on a lot shall not be changed by the provisions of
this subsection (5).
(6) Pedestrian and vehicular access.
(a) When a yard used to satisfy the Green Area Open Space requirement of this footnote is a front yard, the Green Area Open Space
may be interrupted by not more than one path for pedestrian access to the building. Said pedestrian path shall be constructed
perpendicular to the lot line and shall not be more than eight (8) feet wide. The green area yard may also be interrupted by not more
than one driveway constructed perpendicular to the lot line and which is not more than twelve (12) feet wide.
(b) The sum of the width of the said pedestrian path and driveway may not exceed the setback provided by the smallest of the yards
provided on the lot.
(c ) The areas allowed to be used for access under this subsection (6) shall be counted as part of the twenty-five (25) percent of the
total required green area which is allowed to be use for hard surfaced walks and terraces for the front yard in which the access areas
are constructed.
(7) Townhouse Development When a lot is used for townhouse development, the provisions of this footnote shall apply to the lot
before subdivision into townhouse lots. Subdivision into townhouse lots shall be done in such a manner as to not affect the application
of this footnote to the entire unsubdivided lot. In particular, the pedestrian path and driveways allowed.

Dear City Councillors,
We are writing to ask that Cambridge city officials call a halt to the dangerous, unsightly new gas connections installed
up and down the sidewalks on Fifth Street, apparently for Eversource's convenience and some safety. See the attached
pictures. The lack of public process combined to the fact Eversource has not always obtained the homeowner's
permission first, and many homeowners had not understood what the work would look like when completed is wrong.
The outlets take up to 2 sqft of the public way when we have winters like 2015, every square foot of space for piling
snow after shoveling counts! And what about if one slips and falls on one of these. They are a hazard, especially for the
elderly and small children, and are most likely hindering anyone in a wheelchair or mobility issues.
It is not uncommon for cars to end up on the sidewalk when they crash. These relocated gas connections could be right
in the path of one of these cars, which is hazardous.
We also understand that Winter Street will suffer the same faith, and urge you to act so as to correct this untenable
situation.

Harvard square pedestrians/bikers

Hello,
I'm emailing to encourage Cambridge to ensure Harvard Square is more pedestrian and biker friendly. After such a
recent and terrible loss, there's no excuse not to expand access to the area for people without cars. Thank you!

Residents Alliance supports Manager Contract Reconsideration and negotiation

Importance:

High

9/20/20
Dear Mayor and Councilors,
The Cambridge Residents Alliance supports re-consideration of the vote on POR 2020 #198 to extend the city manager’s
contract for 18 months. We note that several councillors, including the Mayor, said publicly that they had never seen
the contract before the city council meeting and had never discussed the terms. The proposed contract was unclear due
to inconsistent wording, cross-outs, and hand-written annotations.
There is no record of an Executive Session being held to discuss potential terms of the contract, which is how the Council
would have been able to learn about, and give input, to any offer that would be extended. In the March 12, 2020
Government Operations meeting, Councilor Simmons, the chair of the committee, made it clear that she was only asking
for authorization to talk with the manager to find out what he wanted, NOT to negotiate on behalf of the Council (see
attached document from 3/12/20 meeting). Despite her commitment to convene the full council, it appears Councilor
Simmons did negotiate on behalf of the Council, without the Council's input. This process was not transparent to the
councilors.
We ask that the Council a) indicate to the manager that they want to extend his contract, and b) that the Council will
meet in Executive Session to discuss the terms of the contract. The Cambridge city manager is already paid $323,000
per year, a salary that is much higher than other similar cities with a AAA bond rating. It is far higher than Gov. Baker’s
2018 salary of $185,000.
We would like the Council to meet in Executive Session to consider not giving the manager an additional 2.5% annual
pay increase upon signing. There is already an existing COLA of 2.5% in the contract. (That COLA greatly exceeds current
inflation, which in August was 1%.) These may not seem like large numbers, but they affect the annual pension for many
years. In fact, many government leaders are forgoing pay increases or even taking pay cuts now due to tighter finances
stemming from impacts from the pandemic, so it seems strange that the manager would insist he must have an
additional 2.5% annual increase beyond his existing COLA or he will not accept the contract extension. We also ask that
the end of the contract term be June 30, 2022 (not July 5, 2022), which will also reduce future costs.
Once the contract is agreed, the Cambridge Residents Alliance would like the Council to conduct a public review of the
manager as soon as possible, so that the public can give input on his performance, and so he and the Council can work
together effectively. We ask that the contract specifically mention that this review will take place.
If the Council does not meet in Executive Session, we ask that these matters be discussed during the 9/21/20 Council
meeting.
Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.

Reconsider City Managers contract

City Council,
Please reconsider the 18-month extension to the city manager’s because the proposed contract was proposed late at
night, with no chance for the Council to review it in advance, was confusing, and it appears to give an unnecessary
additional 2.5% salary increase to the manager, who already earns $325,000.
There is already an existing COLA of 2.5% in the contract (That COLA greatly exceeds current inflation, which in
August was 1%.) Why is the city manager getting such an increase when many government leaders are forgoing
pay increases or even taking pay cuts now due to tighter finances stemming from impacts from the pandemic. His
demands are excessive and inappropriate at this time. And the end of the contract term should be June 30, 2022
(not July 5, 2022), which should also reduce future costs.
Has the Council conducted a formal (thorough) performance review of the performance of the City Manager? It
appears not. Have the citizens of Cambridge been afforded a public review of this manager? It appears not.

The city manager's contract is one of the Council’s most important
responsibilities yet there is no record of an executive session being held to
discuss potential terms of this contract. In my personal opinion, this has legal
ramifications and financial issues that warrants reconsideration.
Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.

POR 2020 #198, City Manager's contract renewal

To the Cambridge City Council, copy to City Clerk:
The Council's action to renew the City Manager's contract, outlined in the Cambridge Residents Alliance letter
to you dated September 20, 2020, is breathtaking even in these extraordinary times.
For those of us still breathing, it is important to retain honest public process when possible. This is one such
moment. Please vote to reconsider this Policy Order, POR 2020 #198 and at very minimum, change the
proposed contract as the CRA letter details.
The poet Robinson Jeffers wrote decades ago, "corruption never has been compulsory"
(https://www.antiwar.com/orig/jeffers1.html. I urge you to revise, as CRA proposes, what's in the current draft
contract rather than approve it tonight.
Yours sincerely,

Manager's contract vote

Dear Councilors,
Given the importance of decisions related to the City Manager’s role and tenure, I ask you to postpone the 9/21 vote on
the manager’s contract in order to give all councilors time to discuss the proposed terms. This would give you time to do
the thoughtful job I believe you all want to do.

Please reconsider POR 2020#198 in accord with Councilor Nolan's motion.
I understand that the Council had not seen the contract before the Council meeting on September 14 and had not had
an opportunity to discuss its terms in Executive Session prior to the Council meeting on September 14. That alone
should be enough for the Council to reconsider the contract. The residents of the city should not bear the costs, financial
and otherwise, of a decision made without the necessary procedural requirements.

Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and City Council, City Manager DePasquale,

Friends of Jerry’s Pond wishes to share the following thoughts in consideration of City Manager Louis A.
DePasquale’s Sept. 9, 2020 communication forwarded from Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for
Community Development and Owen O’Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works related to Report 20-39 and 2040:

1. We are greatly appreciative of the City’s recent consideration of Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding land as a
matter of great importance and concern for the city and to communicate this in a meeting with the new owners,
IQHQ. As is noted in the Sept. 9th communication:

“The purpose of this meeting will be to familiarize IQHQ with the recommendations of the Alewife District Plan
and the Alewife Preparedness Plan; and to ensure [IQHQ is] aware of the community’s expressed desire to
beautify Jerry’s Pond and improve connections to nearby open spaces and pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
while understanding the environmental hazards and the need to safely manage the site. //

5.33.a

2. We thank the City for acknowledging our voice and the community’s desires,
and we also highlight the urgency given the decades of neglect which this area has sustained, the immediately
adjacent and significant environmental justice communities, the extreme climate risk the neighborhood faces in
the future as well as the impacts it faces today including: heat island and lack of tree canopy, poor air quality
from clogged Rindge Ave. (which feeds into major congested auto transit routes) as well as the large amount of
real estate development which has already occurred and is projected for the adjacent areas known as the
Triangle and Quadrangle.

3. With the community’s interests in mind, we request the City identify the stakeholders mentioned in the
communication. These stakeholders should include: Friends of Jerry's Pond, The Alewife Study Group, Alewife
Neighbors Inc., Green Cambridge, Friends of Alewife Reservation, and the North Cambridge Stabilization
Committee at a minimum.

4. The Sept. 9th letter cites the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan, however it does not
reference the critical Activity and Use Limitation which creates permanent deed restrictions on the site and
the City of Cambridge’s Asbestos Ordinance which dictates how any potential re-use of this land can occur.
These protections were hard fought victories by a highly organized community, spearheaded by the Alewife
Study Group, and should not only be defended by the engaged citizens of this community, but with every
resource available to the City’s municipal infrastructure.

5. The communication does not reference the base zoning code which covers the bulk of the IQHQ site which
falls under “Special District 3” and begins with this important preamble:

“It is the intent of this Special District 3 to permit a modest level of residential and nonresidential development
in the District consistent with the public interest in protecting regulated wetlands where they occur within the
district; maintaining flood storage capacity in the district consistent with federal regulations; minimizing the
amount of additional traffic passing through congested intersections on arterial streets, and on local,
neighborhood streets, that could provide access to the district; limiting stormwater runoff onto property located
outside the district ensuring adequate visual buffers and screening of buildings and parking facilities from
adjacent public parks and recreation facilities; minimizing the disturbance of existing soil within the district to
limit dispersal and exposure to possible harmful residual substances in the soil; and in enhancing the parkway
character of the Parkway Overlay District.”

Attachment: Eric Grunebaum_2020_9_21 Friends of Jerry's Pond-Re Report Item #20-39 20-40 (COM 631 #2020 : A communication was

Given the potentially broad scope of open space improvements and the environmental risks associated with
remediation and infrastructure work, discussion of future improvements would be expected to include property
owners, residents, and other community stakeholders that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.”

Packet Pg. 315

6. The communication mentions the history of the site, but does not convey the full nature of events that have
transpired there. The 26-acre site on which Jerry’s Pond sits has been subjected to extensive contamination and
abuse by previous ownership. As a result, neighbors including many Cambridge residents of color and other
marginalized communities have had to live with the fear of exposure to toxic chemicals as well as the loss of
one of their most cherished City amenities at Jerry’s Pond. In light of the above, we believe that development
on this site is a privilege and the burden of proof lies with the owners to demonstrate a lasting benefit to the
public.

7. The communication mentions a “zoning framework that could provide incentives to realize these
improvements through development”. We reject the concept that development incentives must be offered to
achieve the intentions for Special District 3 which are embedded in the zoning code’s language. A full build-out
to current zoning would be immensely profitable for a developer and should require no incentives. [footnotes
below]

To the contrary, given its history, the developer in this district must prove a commensurate public benefit before
a build-out is approved. We support the open space guidelines shown on the Alewife District Plan. We believe
past site history and current realities warrant the preservation of these open spaces and require no further
incentives to be achieved.

8. The list of improvements the City has done and is proposing is a great start, however in a show of good faith
on the City’s recognition of the environmental injustice which has long impacted this neighborhood, we have
asked that a new swale be created adjacent to Jerry’s Pond and the Russell Field parking lot in what is
described in the Sept. 9th letter as a “drainage riprap” area.

This new swale should be equivalent in quality to the swales the city has built in the wealthier West Cambridge
neighborhood at the corner of: 1. Lexington and Brattle streets, 2. Lakeview Ave. and Vassal Lane, and 3. at
Fayerweather and Field streets. Photos below:

Current Conditions at Jerry’s Pond:

Further, Friends of Jerry’s Pond on behalf of the neighborhood asks that the historic fence at the corner of
Rindge and Alewife Brook Parkway not be removed. This fence represents one of the few areas of historical
memory for the site’s more rural parkway history, as inspired by the landscape architect Charles Elliot and as
seen in the 1932 photograph below:

9. Finally, we ask that you review the attached PDF of 90 eloquent letters that neighbors have written on the
subject of the restoration of Jerry’s Pond, and recognize the current effort as a critical initiative to fix nearly 60
years of environmental injustice specifically for the immigrant communities, people of color and poorer citizens
many of whom live directly across the street. We have also collected several hundred signatures on a petition to
“Restore and Revitalize Jerry’s Pond.”

This is not simply a matter of beautification, it can and should be a singular opportunity to create a
transformational new publicly accessible natural reservation, restore a remaining area of The Great Swamp's
historical wetlands and biodiversity, preserve and expand tree canopy, incorporate expansive green
infrastructure, all while providing opportunities for impacted communities to have access to nature across the
street from their homes, in particular for the noted affordable housing facilities. There is ample scientific
evidence of the value to mental and physical health that such access to nature provides and this community
deserves no less, in an era when every remaining parcel is being developed for commercial purposes.

With best regards,

Friends of Jerry’s Pond (names available upon request)

The zoning noted above for Special District 3 dictates that the owner of the site is entitled to develop 782,500
square feet of floor area, and the City’s Envision Alewife plan below suggests that 803,750 square feet (above
the currently allowable square footage) can be built on a quadrant of the site where current buildings and
surface parking lots currently exist without disturbing the currently un-built and green areas of this land area.

Utilizing a recent real estate comparable from across Alewife Brook Parkway, suggests that new lab space in
this neighborhood has an estimated value of ~$1486/s.f. Under the current zoning which allows a total floor
area of 782,500 s.f., and with the comparable noted, the development of the quadrant of the site pictured above
(and on the noted pages of the District Plan) can be estimated at greater than $1.1 billion (not including the
parcels within the residential area.) This is approximately ten times the land cost of $125 million.

Alewife Study Group and Alewife Neighbors, Inc., regarding Jerry's Pond and IQHQ
Policy Order
ANI-JerrysPondOrderResponse-20200920.pdf

Honorable Mayor Siddiqui, City Councilors, and City Manager DePasquale,
The Alewife Study Group (ASG) is writing in regard to the following communications about
Jerry’s Pond and the IQHQ property in North Cambridge:
Cambridge City Council Policy Order POR 2020 #175, as amended and approved on
July 27, 2020
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s response to the above Policy Order, on September
9, 2020, which includes communications from Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for
Community Development and Owen O’Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works
A review of the above two documents, provided by Alewife Neighbors, Inc. (ANI),
which is attached to this letter. ANI is a 501(c)3 non-profit formed by residents of
North Cambridge in 1997, in connection with the Alewife Study Group, which was
formed by residents in 1995.
The Alewife Study Group would like to share the following comments, some of which build
upon the review provided by ANI:
We very much appreciate the work of the City Council, CDD, DPW, and other City
departments, that have led to numerous improvements in the area near Jerry’s Pond, at
Russell Field, and at other nearby locations. For example, the solution to the flooding issue
on the path between Russell Field and the T station head house has benefitted thousands of
residents and other users of the area.
Some of the improvements listed in the City Manager’s response also happened because of
initiatives and work by Cambridge residents and citizen groups, in partnership with the City,
and other governmental agencies, to identify problems and then work together to find
solutions.
The policy order regarding Jerry’s Pond also asked the City Manager to engage citizen
groups such as ASG, ANI, Friends of Jerry’s Pond, Friend of Alewife/Green Cambridge,
resident groups at Fresh Pond Apartments, 402 Rindge Avenue, Jefferson Park, Jackson
Place, and other relevant stakeholders, to work together to address the goals of the policy
order.

The City Manager’s report does not include any steps taken so far to engage any of these
important and knowledgeable stakeholders, and only mentions the possibility of including
these stakeholders sometime in the future.
We ask that the City take steps as soon as possible (and before having a first meeting with
IQHQ or communicating any City positions to IQHQ) to engage the stakeholders listed in the
policy order with the opportunity to have representatives fully involved in the process going
forward with IQHQ.
It is important that representatives of the listed citizen groups (with possible additions as
noted in the policy order) be involved from the very beginning in any discussions of the
future of a highly complex site with multiple environmental justice issues. Although City
planning documents list various options to address these issues, it is the neighbors who will
have to live with the impacts of specific decisions. And, the citizen’s groups have valuable
experience, information and ideas that should be included, and that can lead to better
outcomes for the city as a whole.
We ask that the City Council clarify and emphasize the importance of citizen group
involvement, from the very beginning, in the process with IQHQ. We also request that any
City Council committees that address this situation also include citizen participation in the
manner that the policy order states.
Alewife Study Group and Alewife Neighbors Inc. have been researching, informing, involving
and advocating on issues connected to the 26.5 acre site formerly owned by W. R. Grace
(and now by IQHQ) and Russell Field, since 1995 and 1997 respectively. Over the years, we
have shared important updates, and opportunities to have a voice, with the residents living
in the area, by flyer distributions (usually about 2,500 each time), emails, public meetings,
and more.
ASG will hold a virtual public meeting soon about the development possibilities and
associated issues at the IQHQ property. Our publicity for the meeting will include another
2,500+ flyer distribution to the neighborhood.
For several years, ASG researched the Grace site's industrial history, ultimately presenting
DEP, the City, W.R. Grace, and state senators and reps with solid data that asbestos had
been used in manufacturing on that site for years. W.R. Grace was then required to test the
site for asbestos. ASG, ANI, the City and W.R. Grace tested soil samples at 365 locations.
One in six locations contained loose fiber asbestos, and 75% of the samples with asbestos
had concentrations of greater than 1%. A concentration of 1% represents about 1 pound of
asbestos fibers per cubic foot of soil. According to federal agencies, no level of asbestos is
considered "safe.”
ASG research also established that the Russell Field had been used for the storage of
materials excavated from the Grace site during the construction of the Red Line
extension. Based on this information, the City of Cambridge, ASG and ANI partnered to
design, implement, monitor and assess environment testing of Russell Field prior to the
reconstruction of the field in the early 2000’s. Asbestos was detected at a handful of
locations, and was then remediated.

ASG and ANI also helped establish of an extension of the Public Involvement Plan (PIP) that
continues beyond the end of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
(MassDEP) oversight for cleanup of the still heavily contaminated formerly Grace, now
IQHQ, property. This extension of the PIP has allowed the neighbors to be repeatedly
informed and given the opportunity for involvement as site remediation activities have
continued. ASG and ANI representative have continued to receive and review plans and
maintenance reports over the past 15 years since the end of active state oversight of the
property.
For three years running, ANI applied to Massachusetts DEP for a Technical Assistance Grant
(TAG) to pay for the analysis of soil samples on neighbors' behalf. Each of three years, ASG
received the maximum grant of $10,000. With that data in hand, ASG partnered with the
City Council for the passage of the Asbestos Protection Act, which the Council passed nine to
zero.
We also ask, and think it’s in the best interest of our city, that any discussions of possible
future uses of Jerry’s Pond take into account all relevant issues and possibilities for the
entire 26.5 acre IQHQ property. Any positive or negative impacts from changes to the
entire site will affect residents and users of the area for many years to come. So, any
possible changes should be evaluated as a full package, not just piece by piece.
Thank you for considering all of these comments and requests. We look forward to hearing
your responses, and to working with you in the near future for the benefit of our entire city.
Sincerely,
Joel Nogic, Lisa Birk, Ronnie Millar

Re: City Manager Response to CMA 2020 #200
Dear Alewife Study Group:
Alewife Neighbors, Inc. has reviewed the Cambridge City Council Policy Order
POR 2020 #175, as amended and approved on July 27, 2020, and the response from
the City Manager in CMA 202 #200 dated September 9, 2020.
The POR 2020 #175 has two orders, one of which was to report back by September
14, 2020, which was met, and the other which was to engage the property owner of
Jerry’s Pond, IQHQ, to engage with certain governmental departments and resident
representatives regarding Jerry’s Pond.
Specifically, it was ordered that “the City Manager be and hereby is requested to
contact IQHQ and engage the Community Development Department, the
Department of Public Works, Public Health Department and the Department of
Conservation and Recreation, representatives from Fresh Pond apartments, 402
Rindge Avenue, Jefferson Park and Jackson Place, Friends of Jerry’s Pond, Alewife
Study Group, Alewife Neighbors Inc., Friends of Alewife/Green Cambridge and
other relevant stakeholders regarding next steps for” the site.
The report from the Community Development Department (CDD) and Department
of Public Works (DPW) states, “CDD has reached out to representatives of IQHQ to
schedule a meeting between the new owners of the site and key City departments.”
Later in the report, it is stated that “discussion of future improvements would be
expected to include property owners, residents, and other community stakeholders
that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.”
The City Manager response has excluded the stakeholders mentioned in the Policy
Order, and has made no indication when they will be included during the initial
discussions, if at all.
Additionally, the narrative of history site usage in CMA 202 #200 fails to note the
contamination at Jerry’s Pond. As noted in the Public Involvement Plan for the site,
filed with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP),
“During the time DAXAD was manufactured in Buildings 26 and 27, several
lagoons were used as settling ponds and sources of cooling water.” As shown in the
attached maps from MassDEP, a portion of the DAXAD Process Waste Area is now
part of Jerry’s Pond, and another waste area and the cooling channel are near the
pond. Unfortunately, there has not been extensive testing of Jerry’s Pond to

5.34.b

determine contamination levels in the sediment of the pond. Additionally, asbestos, which
continues to significantly contaminate much of the site, has been found near Jerry’s Pond,
despite more limited testing locations in those areas.
However, there has been extensive testing of much of the rest of the land on the site, which led to
almost 20 years of active investigation and remediation under the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan processes, which has continued at a maintenance level for an additional almost 15 years. In
the end, there were still significant levels of soil contamination, and the mitigation process ended
with an Activity and Use Limitations for the site parcels, which have been filed with the Registry
of Deeds.
Finally, it appears that the City has highlighted that the Alewife District Plan provides a “zoning
framework that could provide incentives to realize these improvements through development,”
indicating a willingness to allow and discuss additional development incentives to build within
the floodplain at the meeting with the new property owner before any plans have been discussed
with residents.
Sincerely,
Michael Nakagawa
Vice President
on behalf of the board of Alewife Neighbors, Inc.

HSNA - support for the Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
I write to you on behalf of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association (HSNA) to encourage you to support
the Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order introduced by Councillors Nolan, Carlone, Mallon, Sobrina-Wheeler.
The principles of this P.O. represent an important re-start of Harvard Square that will add new dynamism and
vitality in the selective closure of certain streets promoting new dynamism, opportunities, and accessibility.
HSNA’s executive committee unanimously supports these principles, recognizing that several Councillors
earlier have proposed changes to Harvard Square and we are in their debt.
HSNA also has explored in detail the earlier multimodal traffic study commissioned by the Harvard Square
Business Association and will meet with them this week. While this latter study was completed well before the
fatalities, new bike lanes, and COVID – the latter leaving severe impacts on local restaurants and businesses,
there are a number of suggestions in this multimodal study that we can get behind. However we find that
closing certain streets to vehicles except for deliveries is an important part of the solution.
Moreover, the time to act is now. HSNA has already begun to meet with stake holders (local property owners,
local businesses, neighbors, and bicyclists) and look forward to our meeting this week with HSBA. As we move
forward, we will bring our shared ideas for the redesign to Councillors, city staff, and others for their
consideration, cognizant that already a number of urban centers have begun to revitalize their older
commercial squares by closing certain streets strategically in a similar way.
We urge you to support the Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order “as written “(without the proposed
substitute language) and also to not create a separate Harvard Square study committee that will take several
years to reach conclusions.
Cordially,
Suzanne Preston Blier
President

Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillors Sobrinho-Wheeler, Simmons, Toomey, McGovern,
Carlone, Nolan, and Zondervan
RE: Harvard Square Redesign Policy
I write to you as a resident of Harvard Square for 32 years, an owner of a business located in Harvard Square
and a member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association. I am also a member of 5 business networks:
Cambridge Local First, Harvard Square Business Association, Central Square Business Association,
Sustainable Business Network of MA, and the newly formed Cambridge-Somerville Black Business Network.
I am really excited about the opportunity to discuss the streetscape in Harvard Square and how we can tweak
it so we can better serve residents, businesses, visitors, students, and all of Cambridge. I appreciate the
process that was started a couple of years ago in October, 2017 by Councillor E. Denise Simmons and, now a
renewed effort by Councillors Nolan, Carlone, Mallon, Sobrina-Wheeler with the Harvard Square Redesign
Policy Order being introduced. I want to acknowledge the work that Councillor Simmons and HSBA Executive
Director Denise Jillson did in raising many valid concerns and challenges stated by HSBA years ago.
I feel that the Harvard Square Redesign policy order before us now goes a little further in recognizing that we
need a safer and more pedestrian friendly square and now would be a good time to act on that. I do see
tremendous value in closing some streets, adjusting delivery times and redirecting flow of traffic. I do think
there is merit in this Harvard Square Redesign policy to help Harvard Square businesses thrive.
In my opinion, this is not an "either or" decision, but an opportunity to come together to make Harvard Square a
better place. I am looking forward to working closely with my neighbors and the Harvard Square Business
Association in coming up with a plan that values and respects the community, and business ecosystem in
ensuring a vibrant, safe and active Harvard Square.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best,
Nicola

WHEREAS:

On September 10th, 2020, Governor Charlie Baker announced he would sign an
executive order allowing municipalities to extend the outdoor dining permitting season
past its original expiration date of November 1st to support struggling restaurants as
the weather turns cooler; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge recently announced it will be extending the outdoor dining
season even beyond the Governor’s executive order, provided restaurants can safely
operate and provide snow removal when necessary; and

WHEREAS:

As residents may feel apprehensive about indoor restaurant dining, and as third party
food delivery service fees present a significant financial burden for restaurants,
encouraging outdoor dining and easing permitting barriers is a crucial way the City can
support local small businesses; and

WHEREAS:

Restaurants will need access to propane heaters in order to attract outdoor diners as we
enter into the colder fall and winter months; and

WHEREAS:

The successful 2018 Patio Heater Pilot Program in Harvard Square, which allows
restaurants to use portable propane heaters outdoors after obtaining the required
permits, was positively received by both the local business community and by the Fire
Department, and was later expanded to include all Cambridge businesses; and

WHEREAS:

To truly support struggling small businesses, the City should remove permit fees for
propane heater applications as they have done in Boston, as well as create an expedited
propane heater permitting process, similar to the expedited permitting process it
previously offered to local restaurants hoping to create or expand outdoor dining space;
and

WHEREAS:

Supplying propane heaters to restaurants free of charge, and providing a centralized
location for them to pick up, refill, or drop off empty propane tanks would help uplift
small businesses that are struggling financially, and protect the vitality of our Main
Street economy; and

WHEREAS:

As this year’s outdoor dining season has been extended, and as outdoor dining will
likely be a popular option next spring since COVID-19 vaccines are not expected to be
widely available until mid-2021, the City must develop clear public health guidelines
for outdoor dining to both protect restaurant workers, and ensure diners feel safe when
supporting local businesses; and

Packet Pg. 350

7.2

WHEREAS:

Expediting permitting, reducing financial barriers, and providing clear outdoor dining
public health guidelines for restaurants aligns with the Envision Cambridge goal of
“[ensuring] local businesses of different types, sizes, and growth stages are able to
start, grow, and remain in Cambridge”; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the License
Commission, the Fire Department, the Small Business Advisory Committee, and the
local neighborhood business associations to determine the feasibility of creating a free
and expedited permitting process to all restaurants to use outdoor heat lamps; and be it
further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of
Public Works (DPW), the Fire Department, the Small Business Advisory Committee,
and the local neighborhood business associations to determine the feasibility of
purchasing propane heaters to loan to local restaurants, and of storing propane tanks at
DPW headquarters at 147 Hampshire Street or another City owned location; and be it

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has employed several strategies to reduce the spread of
COVID-19 through increased testing, contact tracing and mask and social
distancing practices; and

WHEREAS:

Due to these strategies, Cambridge’s COVID-19 positivity rate has dropped
from its peak of a 36.7 cases per day on a seven-day moving average in April,
to now a 4.4 cases per day on seven-day moving average in September; and

WHEREAS:

One strategy to understand the impact of COVID-19 in our community more
comprehensively is to capture the prevalence of antibodies in Cambridge
residents; and

WHEREAS:

Serology testing is the test that looks for proteins in the blood called antibodies,
which are produced in response to the presence of the virus, and the presence of
these proteins indicate that someone’s had the virus in the past; and

WHEREAS:

Serology testing is one part of a strategic, holistic approach to measuring the
impact of COVID-19 in Cambridge, and is critical to inform our efforts to
prevent the spread of the virus, as antibodies might also help us fight infections
in the future; and

WHEREAS:

As we move forward through the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, it
would be prudent to collect antibody information to thoroughly understand
what the virus is doing in our community in order to get ahead and control it;
and

WHEREAS:

Cities like Houston, Texas and Providence, Rhode Island, have launched an
Antibody Testing Program to conduct random surveys and testing of
individuals in their community; and

WHEREAS:

To date, Houston’s Public Health Department and Fire Department have
randomly sampled 420 homes across 60 census block groups with high and low
COVID-19 positivity rates; and

Packet Pg. 352

7.3

WHEREAS:

The levels of antibodies can decrease over time, so antibody testing in multiple
rounds is critical to collect the most accurate data; and

WHEREAS:

Antibody testing programs can become costly, and similar antibody testing
programs have received financial assistance from the CDC to carry out the
labor and testing costs associated with this important data collection; and

WHEREAS:

As we enter the winter months, battling both influenza and COVID-19,
antibody testing for COVID-19 would be pertinent information to use as we
assess our City’s strategies against COVID-19 moving forward; now therefore
be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with Claude Jacob,
Chief Public Health Officer, as to the feasibility of creating such a program and
report back to the City Council on this matter by October 12, 2020.

WHEREAS:

The Charles River is an invaluable regional asset providing a host of benefits to
the City of Cambridge and those who live and work here, including recreational
opportunities, tourism, ecological benefits, and increased climate resilience; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge residents enjoy a multitude of recreational opportunities on and along
the Charles River, including rowing, boating, swimming, fishing, walking, biking,
and running. To be able to engage in all of these activities, Cambridge residents rely on
the Charles River being clean and safe; and

WHEREAS:

These uses and benefits are possible today because significant resources have
been invested over decades in restoring water quality in the Charles River. As climate
change brings more extreme heat to our region, the benefits provided
by the Charles River will only become more critical; and

WHEREAS:

Stormwater runoff, which carries phosphorus pollution, is the most significant
threat to the health of the Charles River today. Phosphorus carried by stormwater
into the Charles River degrades water quality and causes blooms of cyanobacteria,
or blue-green algae; and

WHEREAS:

Cyanobacteria blooms are known to cause health effects including skin rashes,
fever-like symptoms, respiratory or gastrointestinal distress, and in extreme cases,
paralysis leading to death; and

WHEREAS:

Data indicate that cyanobacteria blooms are worsening each year and that the
duration of the blooms is increasing, which threatens safe recreation and public
health along all 80 miles of the Charles River, including the Cambridge section of
the river. In 2020, the Lower Basin, which is adjacent to Cambridge, has had a
public health advisory in place since June 24; and

WHEREAS:

Currently-unregulated commercial, industrial, and large multi-unit developments,
which make up only 20% of the land area in the Charles River watershed,
contribute 50% of the stormwater pollution entering the Charles River. The
ecological health of the Charles River cannot be fully restored unless these
pollution sources are regulated under the Clean Water Act. Requiring large
stormwater pollution sources to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act would
also support the significant investments being made by municipalities to reduce
stormwater runoff and phosphorus pollution; and

WHEREAS:

In 2019, Charles River Watershed Association and Conservation Law Foundation
petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate large
properties polluting the Charles River with stormwater runoff under the Clean
Water Act; and

WHEREAS:

EPA has indicated that it would like to engage with key stakeholders and explore
the development of a workable and practical permitting approach, and has solicited
feedback from relevant parties, including affected municipalities; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in support of requiring large sources of
stormwater pollution in the Charles River watershed to obtain permits under the
Clean Water Act in order to reduce phosphorus pollution and protect the health of
the Charles River and those who use it.

Communicating information from the Regular School Committee Meeting

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, September 15th, the School Committee had a Regular Meeting
<https://cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69673233> where Superintendent Salim
provided status updates <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1coCErK-wwdU_aQ1rSGJRUnEmnzh6xU6uZpw24fA1ig/edit> on the School Committee’s contingencies
<https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/C20243_Proposed_Reopening_Model_2020-2021_school_year.pdf> for the CPSD Reopening Plan. It will be
important for us to consistently examine where we are to adapt our plans as necessary.
In particular, there were many questions raised about the new COVID-19 Testing Program (here is the
latest press release
<https://www.cpsd.us/district_news/cambridge_public_schools__cambridge_public_health_>) that will
be launching for our staff and students, particularly around ensuring that enough people will be tested, if
the program is optional. While there are still many details that need to be ironed out, I am pleased that we
are making significant process on this front. I hope to soon say the same about our progress with
providing childcare options. I am continuing conversations with CPSD and DHSP on this matter and will
share updates with you as they are available.
I want to announce that my Office has partnered with the Work Force Program to bring Elevate Youth to
Cambridge. Elevate Youth is a nonprofit that empowers underserved youth through regular outdoor
experiences with the support of positive adult role models. This fall, we will be providing free and safe
in-person outdoor programming for CPS students in grades 4 and 5 twice a week on Mondays and
Wednesdays from September 23rd to October 28th at Danehy Park in North Cambridge and Sennott Park

in the Port. Our participating youth will be led by older youth instructors, through the Work Force
Program.
We are focusing on 4th and 5th grade students who live close to these parks (or can secure transportation)
and would not typically have the chance to experience the outdoors with a structured and supervised
program. If you know anyone with children in our target population, please share this application
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUP
OeXIuOaqg/viewform> with them ASAP.
As you all know, my Office has been hosting Family Resource Fairs in partnership with CPS and the
School Committee. Our next Fair is Saturday, September 19th, outside the Peabody School from 10am to
12pm, for families of students in grades PK-1. It will be a quick grab-and-go event for answering back-toschool questions and sharing resources.
Our upcoming School Committee meetings are as follows:
• September 18th, 2020
o Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee Meeting | 10:30 AM
▪ Discussing the COVID-19 Safety and Facilities Manual and the ventilation metrics
• September 22nd, 2020

IN CITY COUNCIL
September 21, 2020
Councillor Nolan Memorandum on why I filed for Reconsideration of the contract vote
Arguably the most important vote the city council takes is on hiring a city manager. In my view, the
vote taken earlier this week on the city manager (CM) contract was flawed, unclear, and warrants
discussion with full transparency, which could not happen given the circumstances of a vote taken at
1 am based on a document distributed at that time. I requested an executive session to discuss the
contract terms, and was told that could not happen without reconsideration. The only path to having
a discussion of the terms was reconsideration. I believe and state unequivocally that it is the council,
not the CM, who failed in this situation.
Among the first meetings I attended as a city councillor were Government Operations Committee
meetings where the question of a city manager contract was the agenda. On February 19, the topic
was discussed and a letter from the CM stating that he was interested in a successor contract was
accepted. It was explicitly stated that accepting the letter from the CM simply put on record that the
committee had received it. At that meeting, the question of a review of the CM was mentioned, since
the contract calls for one, led by the Government Operations Committee. I and several councillors
advocated for a goal-setting and review process. It was recognized as good practice, good
governance, and good modeling.
On March 12, the same committee met again to discuss the city manager contract. During that
meeting (full minutes here) there was discussion of what the process would be to move forward and
how to proceed. There was a suggestion that the committee state it was interested in a one-year
extension (that motion failed). There was discussion on what would happen over the next few
months, how to start a search for a new CM, and other items. During that meeting the process
outlined for the committee members, other councillors such as myself and the public was that the
chair of the committee would be authorized “to have a discussion with Mr. DePasquale regarding
that request” of a new contract. After such discussion, there would be an executive session for the
full council to discuss what a contract might include. An “executive session” was mentioned eight
times during the meeting. That is standard practice and in line with my experience on the School
Committee and on other boards - after getting a sense of what is wanted in a contract, the full body
meets in executive session to be apprised of any information relevant to opening negotiations, and
review strategy and/or discuss possible terms that would be offered. The minutes of the March 12
meeting are very clear that the chair was authorized to open discussions only, and not to negotiate.
The minutes of that meeting were on the July 27 council meeting, and presumably that meant that as
of that date the chair was authorized to ask the CM what he wanted.
Based on my own experience, my understanding of proper procedure and the explicit commitment at
that meeting, I expected that before any contract would be offered the full council would weigh in,

Packet Pg. 363

8.2

during an executive session. Instead, on our September 14 meeting agenda was a policy order from
Councillor Simmons asking the council to extend the CM contract for 18 months “with a 2.5 percent
cost of living adjustment at signing.” There are several questions that arise from that
recommendation. The chair was never authorized to engage in negotiations with the CM, only to
discuss what he wanted, so why were we asked to vote on terms? And during discussion of this
policy order, it became clear that the description of the compensation was wrong. A COLA is given
to non-union staff in July of each year, and the CM received a 2.5% COLA adjustment on July 1,
2020. During our discussion, the council was told there were “no changes”, that the contract was an
extension of the current contract, with “what he gets anyway...following what he has in previous
contracts as a cost of living”. Yet the draft contract which was printed and given to council members
after midnight WAS different. It included not just a COLA, but a separate 2.5% raise upon signing.
Any potential contract should have been reviewed, discussed and jointly voted in executive session,
as had been promised earlier in the year. I, as a new councillor, experienced with several contract
negotiations with superintendents, was surprised and taken aback. How did a process which could
and should have been professional and sensitive, become a public mess? Many of us expressed
confusion about what the terms were, and whether they were appropriate. Many of us were
exhausted, and while we wanted to respect the CM also wanted to recognize that the process through
no fault of the CM, was disconcerting at best. The draft had some handwritten notes, some things
scratched out, and an end date that matched with no specific logic. And it wasn’t clear to me if we
were voting on an actual contract or the rough outlines of one that could be finalized later.
I did wonder over the course of August when we would go into an executive session - and I did reach
out to several colleagues about when we would next hear about the contract. I never heard back and
several colleagues also did not know. In retrospect, I should have asked why we hadn’t had an
executive session. We hadn’t had a regular meeting since the July 27 meeting when the committee
report authorizing the beginning of contract discussion was accepted. I know the CM was anxious to
get this done, and he was told the process was fine. In my opinion, the council mishandled this
process, not the CM.
Why bother reconsidering since I am and was prepared to vote a contract for 18 months? I woke up
the next day troubled. Troubled by a deeply flawed process that was undemocratic, unclear and
counter to the good governance I promised to model and practice every day when I took the oath of
office. And floored by the fact that several of us were not entirely sure what compensation package
we were approving. The meeting video shows the confusion. From an assertion that nothing was
different about this contract, that it was just an extension on the same terms with nothing new to an
assertion that it included a double raise to a question on why the end date did not’ match with
anything, it was an embarrassing display that was not something the council should condone or
tolerate or let stand. Especially in one of the most significant votes we take, we should be very clear
that we know what the vote means.
And, I am uncomfortable that it was not clear at that moment that the vote entailed a raise separate
from a COLA. The public should have confidence that we are looking out for their interests and
carefully monitoring spending of every dollar. We are in the middle of a pandemic and the financial
situation of the city almost certainly will deteriorate over the next year or two. We may be asking
our workers, our unions and our residents to tighten their belts, to lower expectations for what the
city can offer. We should be conscious of every dollar. And yet, in these challenging times when
everyone has been working overtime, many have lost their homes, their livelihoods and their savings,
I cannot in good conscience approve a raise even of 2.5% on a salary that in my view is already far
more than it should be. I reviewed the salaries of mayors and city managers of several cities across
Packet Pg. 364

the country which are our size or in some cases a few times bigger and more complex, all of which
have AAA bond ratings. None are paid as much any close to the current $323K (scheduled to go up
to $339K next July 1) as Cambridge’s City Manager. Most are paid much less. Both Mayor Walsh
of Boston (AAA bond rated city) and Governor Baker make far less. I respect the CM and sincerely
hope he will stay for the next 18 months. I wish we’d only been asked to vote on a standard contract
per the policy order as written, without an additional raise. Or that we’d had an executive session.
Then this reconsideration would not have been filed.
Another note: Through my years of service on School Committee, I took the responsibility for
overseeing the superintendent seriously. Many years back, when the School Committee failed to
fulfill its obligation to conduct a review and got appropriate criticism, I vowed never to let that
happen on my watch. I took over the role of ensuring the review of the superintendent happened. It
was always a fruitful and helpful process - an opportunity to reflect on the past year, recognize and
celebrate what went well and discuss how best to approach the coming year. That process is an
essential part of any high functioning organization. I hope that will happen in the future with any
city manager.

8.4

participating student in the Boston University Graduate Program in Urban
Biogeoscience and Environmental Health (“BU
URBAN”). Jessica’s research at BU has focused heavily on natural gas energy specifically how gas leaks affect our urban canopy and research into transitions
off of natural gas. This summer, as part of the URBAN program, she completed
an internship with my office, researching and writing the attached policy briefs on
the public health impacts of natural gas, the job market impacts of natural gas, and
the climate change impacts of transitioning away from natural gas as an energy
source for buildings in Cambridge. I hope you find them helpful and informative
in our ongoing climate and energy policy efforts.
Sincerely,

Electrification & A Move Off of Natural Gas in Cambridge, MA Fact Sheet
An energy transition to electricity and a move off of natural gas will help put
Cambridge, MA on track to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The motivations for
moving off of natural gas are outlined below and include the public health and
safety, job market, and climate change implications of natural gas.

Public Health and Natural Gas:
Natural gas energy poses a threat to public health both by diminishing indoor air
quality and damaging street trees that provide ecosystem services beneficial to
human health.
● Indoor air quality in gas-serviced homes and businesses is degraded by
combustion byproducts released by pilot light and gas stove burner
ignitions. Combustion byproducts are harmful chemicals proven to
increase asthma exacerbations (asthma attacks of coughing, wheezing,
and shortness of breath), increase risk of respiratory infections, and
have been linked to nausea, headaches, and fatigue.
● Outdoor air quality is impacted by leaking natural gas infrastructure, as
leaks and odorant from the aging pipes pollute degrade outdoor air. Gas
leaks are linked to street tree damage and death, which significantly
reduces their ecosystem services, including cleaning the air, providing
shade, reducing the urban heat island effect, absorbing carbon dioxide,
and encouraging recreational activity. Additionally, gas leaks inhibit the
development of Cambridge’s urban forest master plan.

8.4

Job Creation and Natural Gas:
While the job market implications of electrification are challenging to quantify, the
state of the science is encouraging of a multitude of jobs developing from a just
energy transition plan:
● Clean energy jobs are numerous and growing as more demand for
renewable energy develops. Solar and wind installation jobs are
projected as two of the three most rapidly growing job markets in the
country this coming decade.
● Ensuring a just transition for legacy fossil fuel and union workers will
require complex planning. Including these workers and energy
stakeholders throughout the planning and implementation processes of
energy transition will be crucial to successfully address community
needs. Prioritizing and educating low-income and environmental justice
communities throughout the energy transition will ensure a just transition
for all Cambridge residents.
● Providing security, funding, and retraining opportunities for legacy
workers and new employees of the clean energy economy will help
facilitate further support for an energy transition.

Climate Change and Natural Gas:
The climate change impacts of natural gas can no longer be ignored as Cambridge
strives to lower carbon emissions, achieve robust climate goals, and grow their
urban canopy.
● Leaking and aging natural gas distribution infrastructure corrodes and
releases un-combusted natural gas, primarily methane, into the
atmosphere contributing a significant source of greenhouse gas
emissions and exacerbating climate change effects in the city.
● Leaks damage urban vegetation and street trees. Methane from leaks
infiltrate street tree soil pits and push oxygen out, leading to root damage
and tree death, damaging the existing tree canopy.

memos.

Public Health Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo
1. Introduction:
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to
inform decisions regarding a transition away from natural gas infrastructure in new
construction buildings in the city. This memo will convey the state of the science
of natural gas infrastructure and its public health and safety impacts on
communities serviced by this energy type. A review of the science on public health
and natural gas energy would be incomplete without noting the public health and
safety impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing (fracking), the sourcing of
natural gas. Fracking has become increasingly common in residential areas and has
led to an increase in cardiovascular disease in populations near fracking sites, as
well as significantly degraded air quality.1,2 Cambridge is not located near a
fracking site but the health impacts throughout the natural gas lifecycle are
significant, for example in Pennsylvania, Virginia. However, it is important to
remember that our gas habits contribute significantly to public health issues in
states close by. In the Marcellus Shale Region, located throughout western New
Packet Pg. 385

8.4

York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, there is a considerable amount of natural gas
fracking. Research has shown that the chemicals used in fracking can damage the
lungs, liver, kidneys, blood, and brains of people living nearby.3 While these
pollutants are more common in areas of heavy fracking, there is emerging research
suggesting that some of these chemicals, some of which are carcinogens, may find
their way downstream to the distribution network of the Greater Boston Area.4
Below, the public health impacts of natural gas energy in residential households
and municipalities like Cambridge is reviewed.
2. Research Question & Methodology
The goal of the following policy memo is to provide scientific evidence in support
of building electrification with a focus on protecting the public health and safety of
Cambridge residents, both current and future. In addition to protecting the health
and well-being of residents, electrifying new construction buildings will help
Cambridge stay on track to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Data to inform this
policy brief was compiled from published peer-reviewed literature. A keyword
search was completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases, such as
Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the author’s
4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and papers were
selected for their focus on the public health impacts of methane and combustion
byproducts associated with natural gas energy. Additional data was collected
through publicly available databases, including the location of known gas leaks
currently reported in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020.

3. Key Findings
Natural gas extraction and distribution has detrimental effects on both indoor and
ambient air quality, which has direct impacts on public health.5 Natural gas
generation relies heavily on combustion processes, which release particulate matter
and harmful gases, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile

organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon monoxide. Additionally, there are
significant greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas generation that
contribute to global warming and can cause damage
to urban vegetation including the tree canopy.6 Promoting a robust urban tree canopy is
important for
public health because trees in urban areas help to mitigate the urban heat island
effect, lowering temperatures and providing shade while diminishing energy
consumption, and contributing to the community’s well-being.7
Building electrification has the potential to significantly decrease the greenhouse
gas emissions from the city, reducing the climate change impacts associated with
elevated levels of carbon dioxide and methane emissions.8 Methane is a
Packet Pg. 386

8.4

greenhouse gas and a product of natural gas energy, however, there is little to no
research available regarding the direct impacts of methane on human health.
Narrowing the scope to the public health consequences of natural gas in
Cambridge, MA brings attention to two distinct public health concerns: the danger
of combustion byproducts in homes with natural gas powered appliances, and the
loss of beneficial public health ecosystem services like vegetative cooling, as
climate change impacts are intensified in urban areas.9,10
3.1 Natural gas and combustion byproducts
The most significant public health threat from natural gas energy occurs in homes
serviced by natural gas powered appliances, including gas stoves, gas boilers (for
home heating and hot water) and clothes dryers.11 Gas stoves are perhaps the most
common and significant threat to residents because of the
on-site combustion reaction that happens at the burner when the stove is turned on.
These pollutants are referred to as combustion byproducts and are caused by an
incomplete combustion reaction.12 Combustion byproducts include carbon
monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Carbon monoxide is a
colorless, odorless gas that can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Nitrogen
dioxide, another combustion byproduct can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, and
throat, and in high concentrations can lead to an increased risk of respiratory
infections. Particulate matter released during combustion can cause irritation in the
lungs, damage to lung tissue if inhaled, and can lead to an increased risk of cancer.
Lastly, incomplete combustion reactions can create water vapor, which can
increase the humidity in a home, creating an environment for mold or dust mites.13
Combustion byproducts from gas-powered appliances are a serious threat to
human health and serious concerns about outdated and improper use of gaspowered appliances have emerged. A recent report published out of Australia
found that replacing gas stoves in all homes with newer gas models or electric
appliances and encouraging the use of proper ventilation hoods could lower
asthma prevalence from indoor air pollutants nearly 10%.14 Proper ventilation and
newer gas stoves, without a pilot light, have been shown to help reduce the amount
of combustion byproducts from gas stoves and help negate the

effects on gas-powered appliances on indoor air quality.15 Newer gas stoves and
the use of a ventilation hood when cooking can significantly reduce one’s
exposure to combustion byproducts but these best practices are not always
practical in every person’s home environment, especially for renters who do not
have control over what type of appliances are in the unit.16
There are underlying themes of environmental justice issues surrounding gas leaks

Packet Pg. 387

8.4

and their impact on public health. Homeowners have a clear advantage as they
have control over their fuel for heating/cooling and cooking. Renters can struggle
with dictating their fuel type, although even among renters, there is a divide, as
wealthier renters have more options and control over what type of infrastructure
they will choose to live with. This disparity is one example of the disproportionate
effects an energy transition can have on communities. Low-income communities
and communities of color have historically been marginalized and disadvantaged
when it comes to environmental stewardship and sustainable living and the energy
transition case is no exception. Energy transition, if not handled properly, will
negatively affect disadvantaged communities by exacerbating prevalent energy
insecurity and issues of environmental racism.17

3.2 Natural gas and vegetation loss
Additional concerns about natural gas and public health are broader but equally
important. Aging natural gas distribution infrastructure is springing leaks and from
these leaks, uncombusted methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas, escapes into
the urban atmosphere.18 This gas can also escape into street tree pits and damage
urban vegetation. A robust urban canopy has many public health benefits that are
depleted when trees die or are removed due to damage from a gas leak.19
Massachusetts has a significant problem with leaking gas infrastructure because
over 11% of the pipeline distribution network in the state is made of leak-prone
pipe material, like cast iron, compared to only 0.9% of leak-prone pipes across the
country where older infrastructure has been replaced.20 Urban vegetation is
associated with many public health benefits including, improvement to air quality
and associated respiratory outcomes, cooling temperatures in urban areas and
reducing the urban heat island effect, improvement of physical and mental health
through the promotion of recreational activity, and increased perceptions of
personal
safety.21,22 A recent study in Chelsea, MA demonstrated that unhealthy or dying
street trees were 30x more likely to have elevated methane in their soils from a
nearby gas leak than healthy street trees.23
As Cambridge is working to improve their urban forest, considering the effects of
gas leaks on street trees is of the utmost importance. Cambridge has developed a
comprehensive Urban Forest Master Plan with the aim of protecting and
promoting a robust, healthy, and sustainable urban canopy.24 The benefits of

such an urban canopy cannot be overlooked from both an environmental and a
public health perspective. As highlighted by the study in Chelsea, MA from above,

Packet Pg. 388

8.4

gas leaks pose a significant threat to street trees and can seriously degrade the urban
canopy over time.25 Promoting a robust urban canopy can also help to alleviate
environmental and public health stressors, not only related to gas leaks but issues of
air pollution and the urban heat island effect, in low-income environmental justice
communities. To successfully reach the goals outlined in the Urban Forest Master
Plan and to provide street trees for the most dire communities, Cambridge will be
forced to address the issues of aging gas infrastructure lying under the street.
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
Encouraging building electrification will prepare the City of Cambridge to reach
its goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce the public health impacts of
natural gas energy. Improving the indoor air quality of Cambridge residents,
homeowners, business workers, and renters alike, can be achieved by switching
from natural gas to electric appliances and heating. Incorporating electric
infrastructure in new construction buildings from the start of construction will save
health effects, time, and money down the road as Cambridge looks towards a clean
energy future. Additionally, aging natural gas infrastructure will continue to leak
and spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing
to the greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and
street trees. In order to maintain Cambridge’s urban canopy and the countless
public health services provided by these street trees, reducing the mortality of
these trees due to leaking gas infrastructure will be key.
Electrifying new construction buildings is a logical place to start because there will
be no additional reliance on the aged natural gas system moving forward.
Beginning a climate forward development plan for the city, and creating jobs in the
process, will help the city not only achieve its climate action goals but improve the
health and well-being of its residents.

Job Market Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo
1. Introduction:
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts
to help inform decisions regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction
buildings in the city. This memo will convey the job market possibilities from
electrification and a clean energy transition in Cambridge and highlight the
opportunities for job creation. Investing in natural gas energy in any new
construction building will commit the City of Cambridge to further reliance on
fossil fuels and further delay the city from reaching their climate action goals. In
order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with natural gas will need
to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging electrification from the
onset will expedite the city’s climate agenda. Protecting current gas workers and
providing proper training and job security will be crucial in implementing

electrification that services all concerned stakeholders.
Additionally, to ensure a just transition for all communities, incorporating a
commitment to job training and economic development support for those likely
to be negatively impacted by an energy transition is key.
2. Research Question & Methodology
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey the job market growth
opportunities of building electrification in Cambridge. Reducing reliance on
natural gas and promoting electrification throughout the city’s built environment
would diminish greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel energy and
push the city in the direction of carbon neutrality by 2050.26 Data to inform this
policy brief was compiled from environmental economic research, interviews with
industry professionals, and a review of the published peer-reviewed literature. A
keyword search was completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases,
such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the
author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and
papers were selected for their focus on the politics and economic impacts of
electrification and energy transition at the municipal level. Additional data was
collected through publicly available databases.

3. Key Findings
A transition to electrification and a clean energy economy is challenging to
envision because of the variety of jobs that could be created as an outcome. An
energy transition at the municipal level could be associated with dramatic job loss
and an increase in unemployment. However, research has shown that a just energy
transition can occur that maintains well-paying jobs, continues to provide for
workers and their families, and promotes a healthy and sustainable energy future
that is beneficial for all. The key findings from this research included two main
takeaways: 1) how to incorporate and partner with the current gas infrastructure
work force and related stakeholders in creating and implementing an energy
transition plan that works for everyone, and 2) how to retrain workers and create
new jobs to build and manage electrified infrastructure.

However, before diving into the literature of how an energy transition off of
natural gas could take shape, it is important to review the state of the science on
energy equality and just transition from areas around the world in the midst of
transitioning their energy supply. Commonly, when imagining stakeholders who
would be ill-affected by an energy transition, legacy workers from the fossil fuel
industry come to mind. While those legacy workers would be adversely affected, it
is important to realize that energy transition can also affect low-income
communities and communities of color by worsening issues of energy insecurity
and failing to educate and engage these disadvantaged groups in the transition
process.27 Scholars recognize that research on how to address these disparities is
Packet Pg. 392

8.4

generally under-developed but for stakeholders and decision makers planning
energy transitions, incorporating these disadvantaged communities will be integral
in making any energy transition plan equitable.28 A piece published in Nature
argues that decision makers at the forefront of energy transition policies need to,
work to redistribute welfare so as to avoid undue burden on any specific
population and provide sufficient energy services to all, and… provide an
adequate safety net for all populations, especially those most marginalized
or burdened.29
Incorporating these themes of a just energy transition is important when
considering the job market possibilities in a Cambridge energy transition plan.
3.1 Coordinating an energy transition plan
In partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a study out of
the University of California highlighted the importance of protecting gas workers in
a transition off of natural gas energy.30 Important to remember when considering an
electrification plan for the City of Cambridge is that such a transition does not
occur overnight, meaning that for some current gas workers their job requirements
will not change. Gas infrastructure projects will still occur and home service calls
will require expert repair.
However, maintaining the gas infrastructure during a phase of electrification will
not require the full force of the gas workers that exist today, meaning some
workers will face a transition in their career. A major concern for governments
considering an energy transition or electrification plan is backlash from displaced
gas workers. Therefore, a robust municipal plan to transition off of gas must be
created in collaboration with gas workers. This will not only ease the concerns of
the gas workers but ensure that a transition plan will provide the job security and
economic benefits workers deserve.
Key findings out of a report conducted in California, a state considering a gas ban
and push towards electrification, found the following components to be essential to
a comprehensive transition plan:
1. Establishment of a buyout program that could cover the costs of
retirement systems for older workers
2. Establishment of a committee that could address how to best manage a
shrinking gas workforce, while still safely maintaining any existing gas
infrastructure throughout the transition period
3. Wage protection for transitioning workers

4. Provide funding and training/retraining for gas workers looking to
transition to clean energy or electrification positions.31
Prioritizing communication with gas workers throughout the planning and

Packet Pg. 393

8.4

implementation of an electrification and gas transition plan is crucial for
maintaining job security and incorporating the existing skilled workforce into a
clean energy workforce.32 In addition to engaging with gas workers throughout the
planning phase, stakeholder groups such as residents can help develop a transition
plan tailored to tbe communities’ specific needs. A recent study in Michigan found
that when citizens and other stakeholders were involved in the planning process,
they were more likely to perceive the positive benefits of energy transition, in this
case wind turbine installation, than communities not at all included in the planning
process.33
3.2 Job creation in the transition stage
A major component of electrification and energy transition at the municipal level
will be creating jobs and retraining utility workers, often unionized labor, to
provide well-paying career opportunities.34 Researchers and non-profits are
working to develop energy transition plans that not only serve the planet but also
the work force required for such robust implementation. One such organization,
based in Cambridge, MA, HEET (Home Energy Efficiency Team) has been
researching the feasibility of a GeoMircoDistrict project.35 The GeoMicroDistrict
would replace aging natural gas distribution infrastructure with ground-source heat
pumps that could service a small group of homes and businesses in a microdistrict. Installation of the ground-source heat pumps may need specialized skills
but all maintenance could easily be handled by the existing gas workers.
Geothermal infrastructure carries water, not gas, under and through city streets to
deliver heating and cooling services so a switch from natural gas to water
maintenance would not only require minimal training but also promote a healthier
and safer work environment.11 36
Research from around the world suggests that a energy transition and shift towards
renewable and more efficient low-carbon energy will lead to employment
opportunities, ranging from manufacturing, construction, and installation to fuel
extraction, supply, and transmission.37 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
recently reported that solar photovoltaic installers (51%) and wind turbine service
technicians (61%) will be two of the three fastest growing occupations in the
country in the coming decade, trailed only by nurse practitioners at 52% .38
To address concerns about achieving energy efficiency and transitions to
renewable energy throughout marginalized communities, various programs from
municipalities are developing. Some examples include Colorado’s community
solar program that reserved 5% of all projects for low-income residents,

during the community energy project development phase, and the community
programs run by the Inclusive Financing for Energy Savings program which aims
to provide financing and host sessions for community members and utilities to
build demand for energy efficiency and/or renewable energy investments for their
communities.39,40,41
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
While the job market implications of a clean energy transition take multiple forms,
it is crucial to realize that a clean energy economy enables significant job creation,
both directly and indirectly, and may produce more jobs per unit of installed
capacity than fossil fuel based energy.42 Additionally, in a report published by
Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), nationwide clean energy jobs outnumbered
fossil fuel based jobs nearly 3:1 at the end of 2018.43 These numbers are
encouraging and demonstrate the job creation possibilities brought forward by a
just transition to clean energy.
However, at the local scale, there are real and significant fears brought to light by
gas workers and unions concerned about their futures were gas energy to be
phased out. Therefore, incorporating these parties in the decision making process
and ensuring security, retraining, and funding opportunities throughout the
transition will be crucial to success. Implementing clean energy alternatives that
utilize the existing skills of the gas workforce, such as the GeoMircoDistrict
heating and cooling plan, will lower costs and time associated with retraining and
could provide for healthier working conditions.44 Additionally, ensuring an
equitable and just energy transition across low-income and communities of color
by engaging and educating these communities throughout the planning and
implementation processes will be crucial to provide a healthier and more energy
efficient city for all residents.

Climate Change Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo
1. Introduction
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to
help inform decisions regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction
buildings in the city. This memo will convey the state of the science of natural gas
infrastructure and highlight how incorporating natural gas energy into new
construction buildings will have negative environmental consequences for decades
to come.
Investing in natural gas energy in any new construction building will commit the
City of Cambridge to further reliance on fossil fuels and further delay the city from
reaching their climate action goals. Natural gas energy has potential to contribute to
climate change across its lifecycle, from production at the site of hydraulic
fracturing (“fracking”) to distribution under city streets. Natural gas fracking has
potential to significantly damage watersheds and pollute the air and water in nearby
communities, while fugitive emissions from leaking natural gas distribution
infrastructure contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and can lead to street tree
mortality/morbidity. In order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with
natural gas will need to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging
electrification from the onset will expedite the city’s climate agenda.
2. Research Question and Methodology
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey scientific evidence in support
of building electrification and reducing or eliminating natural gas energy in newly
constructed buildings in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Data to inform
this policy brief was compiled from published
peer-reviewed literature dating back to the 1970s, through current research. A
keyword search was completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases,
such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the
author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy.
Keywords and papers were selected for their focus on the climate change impacts
of natural gas energy, both at the site of fracking and at the point of distribution
through infrastructure underneath urban streets. Additional data was collected
through publicly available databases, including the location of known gas leaks
reported by the gas utility company in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020.

3. Key Findings
Three specific climate change impacts of natural gas energy stand out considerably
in the literature including, 1) air and water pollution at the site of fracking, 2)
significant methane emissions from leaking and aging natural gas distribution
infrastructure, and 3) damage and death to street trees serving urban populations.
Although there are serious climate change and environmental justice issues at the
site of fracking for natural gas, no fracking sites are located in Cambridge, MA so
while worth noting, this environmental impact will not be reviewed in this memo.
3.1 Methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure
Important for Cambridge to consider when planning for their energy future is the
age and condition of natural gas distribution pipelines running under the streets
across most of the city. Originally brought onto the energy market as a greener
alternative to coal, natural gas energy had been associated with climate
benefits since its installation decades ago.45 Recently, research has emerged to
show the leakage of methane associated with natural gas sourcing and distribution
infrastructure erases any climate benefits of natural gas.46 Atmospheric methane is
a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 86 times more potent than
carbon dioxide over a 20-year time period and methane is the primary constituent
of uncombusted natural gas traveling through distribution pipelines.47,48 As the
distribution pipelines age underneath city streets, pipes spring leaks. Some pipes
are more leak-prone than others, such as cast iron, wrought iron, and unprotected
steel.49 These leak-prone distribution pipes make up roughly 30% of the
distribution infrastructure in the MA contributing to many gas leaks across the
state.50 Figure 1 shows the location of currently unrepaired natural gas leaks in
Cambridge, MA as reported by the gas utility to the Massachusetts Department of
Public Utilities.

Although pipeline replacement projects have increased in recent years, gas leaks
across municipalities still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Measuring
exact methane concentrations from leaking natural gas infrastructure has proved
challenging, in part due to the outdated standards for estimating

methane emissions from gas pipelines that the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is still utilizing.51 Recent studies have tried to update these methane
emission standards to better understand the contribution of leaking gas
infrastructure to total greenhouse gas emissions. Hendrick and co-authors focused
in the Greater Boston Area and found that not all gas leaks are equal and from their
survey of 100 gas leaks, found that the top 7% of leaks contributed to 50% of the
total methane emissions measured.52 Although the science of methane emissions
from natural gas distribution infrastructure is still emerging, there is consensus that
methane emissions from natural gas leaks cannot be overlooked when making
decisions about achieving carbon neutrality and electrifying Cambridge.
3.2 Natural gas leaks and street trees
Another area of climate change concerns associated with natural gas infrastructure
is the damage to urban vegetation and street trees that results from aging and
leaking distribution pipelines. When methane leaks from a pipe buried underneath
a city street, a path of least resistance for the gas to reach the atmosphere exists in
the soil pits where street trees and other urban vegetation is planted. Studies dating
back to the 1970s characterize the interactions between methane and the soil of
tree pits.53,54 As methane enters the soil, it begins to displace the oxygen in the soil,
leaving less oxygen available for the roots of urban vegetation to take up.55
Additional changes occur in the microbial communities in these tree pits, as the
influx of methane causes a growth in methanotroph populations, which further
deplete oxygen available for the tree.56,57
More recent research conducted in Chelsea, MA aimed to quantify the effects of
natural gas leaks on urban street tree health.58 This study concluded that dead or
dying street trees across Chelsea were 30 times more likely to have been exposed
to methane, compared to healthy control trees. Damage to urban street trees and
vegetation have significant climate change impacts due in large part to the
ecosystem services provided to cities by a robust urban canopy. Street trees have
demonstrated ability to reduce urban temperatures through shading and

dioxide, and provide aesthetic and recreational value.62,63,64 According to the
Cambridge Urban Canopy report from 2016, Cambridge does well at caring for
their tree canopy, compared to estimates in other cities at 96.7% for young trees
and 90.8% for old trees.65 Maintaining current practices for caring for street trees
and removing further threat from natural gas leaks will be crucial moving forward
to promote a robust urban canopy in Cambridge.
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
Promoting building electrification will help to prepare the City of Cambridge to
reach its goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce the environmental impacts
of natural gas energy. Aging natural gas infrastructure will continue to leak and
spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing to the
greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and street
trees. In order to maintain and grow the beauty of Cambridge’s urban canopy and
promote a sustainable and equitable future for the city, transitioning off of natural
gas will be key. Banning natural gas in new construction buildings in favor of
electrification is a logical place to start because there will be no additional reliance
on the aged natural gas system moving forward. Beginning a climate forward
development plan for the city, and creating jobs in the process, will help the city
achieve its climate action goals. A failure to do so could delay achievement of the
city’s climate change goals, continue to damage the environment, and commit the
city to a future reliance on natural gas and fossil fuels that is unnecessary.

An energy transition to electricity and a move off of natural gas will help put Cambridge, MA on track to
reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The motivations for moving off of natural gas are outlined below and
include the public health and safety, job market, and climate change implications of natural gas.

Public Health and Natural Gas:
Natural gas energy poses a threat to public health both by diminishing indoor air quality and damaging
street trees that provide ecosystem services beneficial to human health.
●

●

Indoor air quality in gas-serviced homes and businesses is degraded by combustion byproducts
released by pilot light and gas stove burner ignitions. Combustion byproducts are harmful
chemicals proven to increase asthma exacerbations (asthma attacks of coughing, wheezing, and
shortness of breath), increase risk of respiratory infections, and have been linked to nausea,
headaches, and fatigue.
Outdoor air quality is impacted by leaking natural gas infrastructure, as leaks and odorant from
the aging pipes pollute degrade outdoor air. Gas leaks are linked to street tree damage and death,
which significantly reduces their ecosystem services, including cleaning the air, providing shade,
reducing the urban heat island effect, absorbing carbon dioxide, and encouraging recreational
activity. Additionally, gas leaks inhibit the development of Cambridge’s urban forest master plan.

Job Creation and Natural Gas:
While the job market implications of electrification are challenging to quantify, the state of the science is
encouraging of a multitude of jobs developing from a just energy transition plan:
●

●

●

Clean energy jobs are numerous and growing as more demand for renewable energy develops.
Solar and wind installation jobs are projected as two of the three most rapidly growing job
markets in the country this coming decade.
Ensuring a just transition for legacy fossil fuel and union workers will require complex planning.
Including these workers and energy stakeholders throughout the planning and implementation
processes of energy transition will be crucial to successfully address community needs.
Prioritizing and educating low-income and environmental justice communities throughout the
energy transition will ensure a just transition for all Cambridge residents.
Providing security, funding, and retraining opportunities for legacy workers and new employees
of the clean energy economy will help facilitate further support for an energy transition.

Climate Change and Natural Gas:
The climate change impacts of natural gas can no longer be ignored as Cambridge strives to lower carbon
emissions, achieve robust climate goals, and grow their urban canopy.
●

●

Leaking and aging natural gas distribution infrastructure corrodes and releases un-combusted
natural gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing a significant source of
greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating climate change effects in the city.
Leaks damage urban vegetation and street trees. Methane from leaks infiltrate street tree soil pits
and push oxygen out, leading to root damage and tree death, damaging the existing tree canopy.

1. Introduction:
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to inform decisions
regarding a transition away from natural gas infrastructure in new construction buildings in the city. This
memo will convey the state of the science of natural gas infrastructure and its public health and safety
impacts on communities serviced by this energy type. A review of the science on public health and
natural gas energy would be incomplete without noting the public health and safety impacts associated
with hydraulic fracturing (fracking), the sourcing of natural gas. Fracking has become increasingly
common in residential areas and has led to an increase in cardiovascular disease in populations near
fracking sites, as well as significantly degraded air quality.1,2 Cambridge is not located near a fracking site
but the health impacts throughout the natural gas lifecycle are significant, for example in Pennsylvania,
Virginia. However, it is important to remember that our gas habits contribute significantly to public health
issues in states close by. In the Marcellus Shale Region, located throughout western New York,
Pennsylvania, and Ohio, there is a considerable amount of natural gas fracking. Research has shown that
the chemicals used in fracking can damage the lungs, liver, kidneys, blood, and brains of people living
nearby.3 While these pollutants are more common in areas of heavy fracking, there is emerging research
suggesting that some of these chemicals, some of which are carcinogens, may find their way downstream
to the distribution network of the Greater Boston Area.4 Below, the public health impacts of natural gas
energy in residential households and municipalities like Cambridge is reviewed.
2. Research Question & Methodology
The goal of the following policy memo is to provide scientific evidence in support of building
electrification with a focus on protecting the public health and safety of Cambridge residents, both current
and future. In addition to protecting the health and well-being of residents, electrifying new construction
buildings will help Cambridge stay on track to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Data to inform this
policy brief was compiled from published peer-reviewed literature. A keyword search was completed
using a variety of peer-review journal databases, such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as
citations collected from the author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and
papers were selected for their focus on the public health impacts of methane and combustion byproducts
associated with natural gas energy. Additional data was collected through publicly available databases,
including the location of known gas leaks currently reported in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020.

3. Key Findings
Natural gas extraction and distribution has detrimental effects on both indoor and ambient air quality,
which has direct impacts on public health.5 Natural gas generation relies heavily on combustion processes,
which release particulate matter and harmful gases, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile

organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon monoxide. Additionally, there are significant greenhouse gas
emissions associated with natural gas generation that contribute to global warming and can cause damage
to urban vegetation including the tree canopy.6 Promoting a robust urban tree canopy is important for
public health because trees in urban areas help to mitigate the urban heat island effect, lowering
temperatures and providing shade while diminishing energy consumption, and contributing to the
community’s well-being.7
Building electrification has the potential to significantly decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from the
city, reducing the climate change impacts associated with elevated levels of carbon dioxide and methane
emissions.8 Methane is a greenhouse gas and a product of natural gas energy, however, there is little to no
research available regarding the direct impacts of methane on human health. Narrowing the scope to the
public health consequences of natural gas in Cambridge, MA brings attention to two distinct public health
concerns: the danger of combustion byproducts in homes with natural gas powered appliances, and the
loss of beneficial public health ecosystem services like vegetative cooling, as climate change impacts are
intensified in urban areas.9,10
3.1 Natural gas and combustion byproducts
The most significant public health threat from natural gas energy occurs in homes serviced by natural gas
powered appliances, including gas stoves, gas boilers (for home heating and hot water) and clothes
dryers.11 Gas stoves are perhaps the most common and significant threat to residents because of the
on-site combustion reaction that happens at the burner when the stove is turned on. These pollutants are
referred to as combustion byproducts and are caused by an incomplete combustion reaction.12 Combustion
byproducts include carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Carbon monoxide is a
colorless, odorless gas that can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Nitrogen dioxide, another
combustion byproduct can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat, and in high concentrations can
lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections. Particulate matter released during combustion can cause
irritation in the lungs, damage to lung tissue if inhaled, and can lead to an increased risk of cancer. Lastly,
incomplete combustion reactions can create water vapor, which can increase the humidity in a home,
creating an environment for mold or dust mites.13
Combustion byproducts from gas-powered appliances are a serious threat to human health and serious
concerns about outdated and improper use of gas-powered appliances have emerged. A recent report
published out of Australia found that replacing gas stoves in all homes with newer gas models or electric
appliances and encouraging the use of proper ventilation hoods could lower asthma prevalence from
indoor air pollutants nearly 10%.14 Proper ventilation and newer gas stoves, without a pilot light, have
been shown to help reduce the amount of combustion byproducts from gas stoves and help negate the

effects on gas-powered appliances on indoor air quality.15 Newer gas stoves and the use of a ventilation
hood when cooking can significantly reduce one’s exposure to combustion byproducts but these best
practices are not always practical in every person’s home environment, especially for renters who do not
have control over what type of appliances are in the unit.16
There are underlying themes of environmental justice issues surrounding gas leaks and their impact on
public health. Homeowners have a clear advantage as they have control over their fuel for heating/cooling
and cooking. Renters can struggle with dictating their fuel type, although even among renters, there is a
divide, as wealthier renters have more options and control over what type of infrastructure they will
choose to live with. This disparity is one example of the disproportionate effects an energy transition can
have on communities. Low-income communities and communities of color have historically been
marginalized and disadvantaged when it comes to environmental stewardship and sustainable living and
the energy transition case is no exception. Energy transition, if not handled properly, will negatively
affect disadvantaged communities by exacerbating prevalent energy insecurity and issues of
environmental racism.17

3.2 Natural gas and vegetation loss
Additional concerns about natural gas and public health are broader but equally important. Aging natural
gas distribution infrastructure is springing leaks and from these leaks, uncombusted methane, a highly
potent greenhouse gas, escapes into the urban atmosphere.18 This gas can also escape into street tree pits
and damage urban vegetation. A robust urban canopy has many public health benefits that are depleted
when trees die or are removed due to damage from a gas leak.19 Massachusetts has a significant problem
with leaking gas infrastructure because over 11% of the pipeline distribution network in the state is made
of leak-prone pipe material, like cast iron, compared to only 0.9% of leak-prone pipes across the country
where older infrastructure has been replaced.20 Urban vegetation is associated with many public health
benefits including, improvement to air quality and associated respiratory outcomes, cooling temperatures
in urban areas and reducing the urban heat island effect, improvement of physical and mental health
through the promotion of recreational activity, and increased perceptions of personal
safety.21,22 A recent study in Chelsea, MA demonstrated that unhealthy or dying street trees were 30x
more likely to have elevated methane in their soils from a nearby gas leak than healthy street trees.23
As Cambridge is working to improve their urban forest, considering the effects of gas leaks on street trees
is of the utmost importance. Cambridge has developed a comprehensive Urban Forest Master Plan with
the aim of protecting and promoting a robust, healthy, and sustainable urban canopy.24 The benefits of

such an urban canopy cannot be overlooked from both an environmental and a public health perspective.
As highlighted by the study in Chelsea, MA from above, gas leaks pose a significant threat to street trees
and can seriously degrade the urban canopy over time.25 Promoting a robust urban canopy can also help to
alleviate environmental and public health stressors, not only related to gas leaks but issues of air pollution
and the urban heat island effect, in low-income environmental justice communities. To successfully reach
the goals outlined in the Urban Forest Master Plan and to provide street trees for the most dire
communities, Cambridge will be forced to address the issues of aging gas infrastructure lying under the
street.
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
Encouraging building electrification will prepare the City of Cambridge to reach its goals of carbon
neutrality by 2050 and reduce the public health impacts of natural gas energy. Improving the indoor air
quality of Cambridge residents, homeowners, business workers, and renters alike, can be achieved by
switching from natural gas to electric appliances and heating. Incorporating electric infrastructure in new
construction buildings from the start of construction will save health effects, time, and money down the
road as Cambridge looks towards a clean energy future. Additionally, aging natural gas infrastructure will
continue to leak and spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing to the
greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and street trees. In order to maintain
Cambridge’s urban canopy and the countless public health services provided by these street trees,
reducing the mortality of these trees due to leaking gas infrastructure will be key.
Electrifying new construction buildings is a logical place to start because there will be no additional
reliance on the aged natural gas system moving forward. Beginning a climate forward development plan
for the city, and creating jobs in the process, will help the city not only achieve its climate action goals but
improve the health and well-being of its residents.

1. Introduction:
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to help inform decisions
regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction buildings in the city. This memo will convey the
job market possibilities from electrification and a clean energy transition in Cambridge and highlight the
opportunities for job creation. Investing in natural gas energy in any new construction building will
commit the City of Cambridge to further reliance on fossil fuels and further delay the city from reaching
their climate action goals. In order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with natural gas will
need to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging electrification from the onset will
expedite the city’s climate agenda. Protecting current gas workers and providing proper training and job
security will be crucial in implementing electrification that services all concerned stakeholders.
Additionally, to ensure a just transition for all communities, incorporating a commitment to job training
and economic development support for those likely to be negatively impacted by an energy transition is
key.
2. Research Question & Methodology
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey the job market growth opportunities of building
electrification in Cambridge. Reducing reliance on natural gas and promoting electrification throughout
the city’s built environment would diminish greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel energy
and push the city in the direction of carbon neutrality by 2050.26 Data to inform this policy brief was
compiled from environmental economic research, interviews with industry professionals, and a review of
the published peer-reviewed literature. A keyword search was completed using a variety of peer-review
journal databases, such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the
author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and papers were selected for
their focus on the politics and economic impacts of electrification and energy transition at the municipal
level. Additional data was collected through publicly available databases.

3. Key Findings
A transition to electrification and a clean energy economy is challenging to envision because of the
variety of jobs that could be created as an outcome. An energy transition at the municipal level could be
associated with dramatic job loss and an increase in unemployment. However, research has shown that a
just energy transition can occur that maintains well-paying jobs, continues to provide for workers and
their families, and promotes a healthy and sustainable energy future that is beneficial for all. The key
findings from this research included two main takeaways: 1) how to incorporate and partner with the
current gas infrastructure work force and related stakeholders in creating and implementing an energy
transition plan that works for everyone, and 2) how to retrain workers and create new jobs to build and
manage electrified infrastructure.

However, before diving into the literature of how an energy transition off of natural gas could take shape,
it is important to review the state of the science on energy equality and just transition from areas around
the world in the midst of transitioning their energy supply. Commonly, when imagining stakeholders who
would be ill-affected by an energy transition, legacy workers from the fossil fuel industry come to mind.
While those legacy workers would be adversely affected, it is important to realize that energy transition
can also affect low-income communities and communities of color by worsening issues of energy
insecurity and failing to educate and engage these disadvantaged groups in the transition process.27
Scholars recognize that research on how to address these disparities is generally under-developed but for
stakeholders and decision makers planning energy transitions, incorporating these disadvantaged
communities will be integral in making any energy transition plan equitable.28 A piece published in
Nature argues that decision makers at the forefront of energy transition policies need to,
work to redistribute welfare so as to avoid undue burden on any specific population and provide
sufficient energy services to all, and… provide an adequate safety net for all populations,
especially those most marginalized or burdened.29
Incorporating these themes of a just energy transition is important when considering the job market
possibilities in a Cambridge energy transition plan.
3.1 Coordinating an energy transition plan
In partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a study out of the University of
California highlighted the importance of protecting gas workers in a transition off of natural gas energy.30
Important to remember when considering an electrification plan for the City of Cambridge is that such a
transition does not occur overnight, meaning that for some current gas workers their job requirements will
not change. Gas infrastructure projects will still occur and home service calls will require expert repair.
However, maintaining the gas infrastructure during a phase of electrification will not require the full force
of the gas workers that exist today, meaning some workers will face a transition in their career. A major
concern for governments considering an energy transition or electrification plan is backlash from
displaced gas workers. Therefore, a robust municipal plan to transition off of gas must be created in
collaboration with gas workers. This will not only ease the concerns of the gas workers but ensure that a
transition plan will provide the job security and economic benefits workers deserve.
Key findings out of a report conducted in California, a state considering a gas ban and push towards
electrification, found the following components to be essential to a comprehensive transition plan:
1. Establishment of a buyout program that could cover the costs of retirement systems for older
workers
2. Establishment of a committee that could address how to best manage a shrinking gas workforce,
while still safely maintaining any existing gas infrastructure throughout the transition period
3. Wage protection for transitioning workers

4. Provide funding and training/retraining for gas workers looking to transition to clean energy or
electrification positions.31
Prioritizing communication with gas workers throughout the planning and implementation of an
electrification and gas transition plan is crucial for maintaining job security and incorporating the existing
skilled workforce into a clean energy workforce.32 In addition to engaging with gas workers throughout
the planning phase, stakeholder groups such as residents can help develop a transition plan tailored to tbe
communities’ specific needs. A recent study in Michigan found that when citizens and other stakeholders
were involved in the planning process, they were more likely to perceive the positive benefits of energy
transition, in this case wind turbine installation, than communities not at all included in the planning
process.33
3.2 Job creation in the transition stage
A major component of electrification and energy transition at the municipal level will be creating jobs and
retraining utility workers, often unionized labor, to provide well-paying career opportunities.34
Researchers and non-profits are working to develop energy transition plans that not only serve the planet
but also the work force required for such robust implementation. One such organization, based in
Cambridge, MA, HEET (Home Energy Efficiency Team) has been researching the feasibility of a
GeoMircoDistrict project.35 The GeoMicroDistrict would replace aging natural gas distribution
infrastructure with ground-source heat pumps that could service a small group of homes and businesses in
a micro-district. Installation of the ground-source heat pumps may need specialized skills but all
maintenance could easily be handled by the existing gas workers. Geothermal infrastructure carries water,
not gas, under and through city streets to deliver heating and cooling services so a switch from natural gas
to water maintenance would not only require minimal training but also promote a healthier and safer work
environment.​11​ 36
Research from around the world suggests that a energy transition and shift towards renewable and more
efficient low-carbon energy will lead to employment opportunities, ranging from manufacturing,
construction, and installation to fuel extraction, supply, and transmission.37 The U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics recently reported that solar photovoltaic installers (51%) and wind turbine service technicians
(61%) will be two of the three fastest growing occupations in the country in the coming decade, trailed
only by nurse practitioners at 52% .38
To address concerns about achieving energy efficiency and transitions to renewable energy throughout
marginalized communities, various programs from municipalities are developing. Some examples include
Colorado’s community solar program that reserved 5% of all projects for low-income residents,

Community Energy Scotland which engages and educates affected communities during the community
energy project development phase, and the community programs run by the Inclusive Financing for
Energy Savings program which aims to provide financing and host sessions for community members and
utilities to build demand for energy efficiency and/or renewable energy investments for their
communities.39,40,41
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
While the job market implications of a clean energy transition take multiple forms, it is crucial to realize
that a clean energy economy enables significant job creation, both directly and indirectly, and may
produce more jobs per unit of installed capacity than fossil fuel based energy.42 Additionally, in a report
published by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), nationwide clean energy jobs outnumbered fossil fuel
based jobs nearly 3:1 at the end of 2018.43 These numbers are encouraging and demonstrate the job
creation possibilities brought forward by a just transition to clean energy.
However, at the local scale, there are real and significant fears brought to light by gas workers and unions
concerned about their futures were gas energy to be phased out. Therefore, incorporating these parties in
the decision making process and ensuring security, retraining, and funding opportunities throughout the
transition will be crucial to success. Implementing clean energy alternatives that utilize the existing skills
of the gas workforce, such as the GeoMircoDistrict heating and cooling plan, will lower costs and time
associated with retraining and could provide for healthier working conditions.44 Additionally, ensuring an
equitable and just energy transition across low-income and communities of color by engaging and
educating these communities throughout the planning and implementation processes will be crucial to
provide a healthier and more energy efficient city for all residents.

1. Introduction
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to help inform decisions
regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction buildings in the city. This memo will convey the
state of the science of natural gas infrastructure and highlight how incorporating natural gas energy into
new construction buildings will have negative environmental consequences for decades to come.
Investing in natural gas energy in any new construction building will commit the City of Cambridge to
further reliance on fossil fuels and further delay the city from reaching their climate action goals. Natural
gas energy has potential to contribute to climate change across its lifecycle, from production at the site of
hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to distribution under city streets. Natural gas fracking has potential to
significantly damage watersheds and pollute the air and water in nearby communities, while fugitive
emissions from leaking natural gas distribution infrastructure contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and
can lead to street tree mortality/morbidity. In order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with
natural gas will need to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging electrification from the
onset will expedite the city’s climate agenda.
2. Research Question and Methodology
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey scientific evidence in support of building
electrification and reducing or eliminating natural gas energy in newly constructed buildings in order to
achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Data to inform this policy brief was compiled from published
peer-reviewed literature dating back to the 1970s, through current research. A keyword search was
completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases, such as Web of Science and Science Direct,
as well as citations collected from the author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy.
Keywords and papers were selected for their focus on the climate change impacts of natural gas energy,
both at the site of fracking and at the point of distribution through infrastructure underneath urban streets.
Additional data was collected through publicly available databases, including the location of known gas
leaks reported by the gas utility company in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020.
3. Key Findings
Three specific climate change impacts of natural gas energy stand out considerably in the literature
including, 1) air and water pollution at the site of fracking, 2) significant methane emissions from leaking
and aging natural gas distribution infrastructure, and 3) damage and death to street trees serving urban
populations. Although there are serious climate change and environmental justice issues at the site of
fracking for natural gas, no fracking sites are located in Cambridge, MA so while worth noting, this
environmental impact will not be reviewed in this memo.
3.1 Methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure
Important for Cambridge to consider when planning for their energy future is the age and condition of
natural gas distribution pipelines running under the streets across most of the city. Originally brought onto
the energy market as a greener alternative to coal, natural gas energy had been associated with climate

benefits since its installation decades ago.45 Recently, research has emerged to show the leakage of
methane associated with natural gas sourcing and distribution infrastructure erases any climate benefits of
natural gas.46 Atmospheric methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a ​global warming potential ​86 times
more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time period and methane is the primary constituent of
uncombusted natural gas traveling through distribution pipelines.47,48 As the distribution pipelines age
underneath city streets, pipes spring leaks. Some pipes are more leak-prone than others, such as cast iron,
wrought iron, and unprotected steel.49 These leak-prone distribution pipes make up roughly 30% of the
distribution infrastructure in the MA contributing to many gas leaks across the state.50 Figure 1 shows the
location of currently unrepaired natural gas leaks in Cambridge, MA as reported by the gas utility to the
Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.

Although pipeline replacement projects have increased in recent years, gas leaks across municipalities
still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Measuring exact methane concentrations from leaking
natural gas infrastructure has proved challenging, in part due to the outdated standards for estimating

methane emissions from gas pipelines that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is still
utilizing.51 Recent studies have tried to update these methane emission standards to better understand the
contribution of leaking gas infrastructure to total greenhouse gas emissions. Hendrick and co-authors
focused in the Greater Boston Area and found that not all gas leaks are equal and from their survey of 100
gas leaks, found that the top 7% of leaks contributed to 50% of the total methane emissions measured.52
Although the science of methane emissions from natural gas distribution infrastructure is still emerging,
there is consensus that methane emissions from natural gas leaks cannot be overlooked when making
decisions about achieving carbon neutrality and electrifying Cambridge.
3.2 Natural gas leaks and street trees
Another area of climate change concerns associated with natural gas infrastructure is the damage to urban
vegetation and street trees that results from aging and leaking distribution pipelines. When methane leaks
from a pipe buried underneath a city street, a path of least resistance for the gas to reach the atmosphere
exists in the soil pits where street trees and other urban vegetation is planted. Studies dating back to the
1970s characterize the interactions between methane and the soil of tree pits.53,54 As methane enters the
soil, it begins to displace the oxygen in the soil, leaving less oxygen available for the roots of urban
vegetation to take up.55 Additional changes occur in the microbial communities in these tree pits, as the
influx of methane causes a growth in ​methanotroph​ populations, which further deplete oxygen available
for the tree.56,57
More recent research conducted in Chelsea, MA aimed to quantify the effects of natural gas leaks on
urban street tree health.58 This study concluded that dead or dying street trees across Chelsea were 30
times more likely to have been exposed to methane, compared to healthy control trees. Damage to urban
street trees and vegetation have significant climate change impacts due in large part to the ecosystem
services provided to cities by a robust urban canopy. Street trees have demonstrated ability to reduce
urban temperatures through shading and ​evaporative cooling ​which can help address issues associated
with the ​urban heat island effect​.59,60,61 Additionally, street trees provide flood control, consume carbon

dioxide, and provide aesthetic and recreational value.62,63,64 According to the Cambridge Urban Canopy
report from 2016, Cambridge does well at caring for their tree canopy, compared to estimates in other
cities at 96.7% for young trees and 90.8% for old trees.65 Maintaining current practices for caring for
street trees and removing further threat from natural gas leaks will be crucial moving forward to promote
a robust urban canopy in Cambridge.
4. Recommendations / Next Steps
Promoting building electrification will help to prepare the City of Cambridge to reach its goals of carbon
neutrality by 2050 and reduce the environmental impacts of natural gas energy. Aging natural gas
infrastructure will continue to leak and spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere
contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and street trees.
In order to maintain and grow the beauty of Cambridge’s urban canopy and promote a sustainable and
equitable future for the city, transitioning off of natural gas will be key. Banning natural gas in new
construction buildings in favor of electrification is a logical place to start because there will be no
additional reliance on the aged natural gas system moving forward. Beginning a climate forward
development plan for the city, and creating jobs in the process, will help the city achieve its climate action
goals. A failure to do so could delay achievement of the city’s climate change goals, continue to damage
the environment, and commit the city to a future reliance on natural gas and fossil fuels that is
unnecessary.

To: Cambridge City Council
From: Alanna Mallon, Vice-Mayor
Date: September 17th, 2020
Subject: Universities’ Return to Campus

To the Honorable, the City Council,
At this time in the fall, Cambridge would usually begin the academic year by welcoming in thousands of
college students. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has fundamentally changed each aspect of our lives,
including the ways we educate students, and bring new neighbors into our community. To learn more
about how our local universities are adapting, I chaired an Economic Development and University
Relations Committee meeting on August 11th. Since hearing directly from MIT, Harvard, and Lesley on
their reopening strategies, they have each allowed a small, select number of students to return to the area
for on-campus living, learning, or research experiences.
Students and staff at each university must follow stringent public health guidelines to be allowed to return
to campus, including testing and quarantine on arrival, as well as routine testing throughout the academic
year. To date, 24 MIT community members have tested positive, compared to 54,448 tests that have been
administered; their total positivity rate is just .044%, lower than Cambridge’s .16% two week positivity
rate. The below chart illustrates MIT’s testing and positivity numbers during the past week.

Anyone who tests positive is immediately quarantined and given access to medical care, if needed. Daily
updates on these results are also available online by visiting MIT’s and Harvard’s respective testing
dashboards. Although Lesley’s data is not yet available, they are working closely with the Public Health
Department to track and respond to any cases, and I will share another update when that data is available.
With low numbers like these, it’s clear that the universities’ vigilance and conservative approach is
helping keep Cambridge safe in these uncertain times. As the Chair of the Economic Development and
Universities Committee, I will continue working with each MIT, Harvard, Lesley, and our Public Health
Department on public health strategies, and I look forward to exploring and developing creative ways each
university can support our own public school students as we enter the new school year.

Thank you,

Alanna Mallon
Cambridge Vice-Mayor
