CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - ROUNDTABLE MEETING: CITY COUNCIL + SCHOOL COMMITTEE
November 29, 2021
Roundtable Agenda
The City Council and the School committee will conduct a joint Roundtable meeting to discuss the past
election, including but not limited to new practices and polling locations is Cambridge with the City
Manager, Election Commission, and any other relevant department.
Council Questions
1. Will the precincts be redrawn to ensure no split precincts? It would be very confusing and
challenging for staff and possibly voters to have split precincts.
2. How were the three early voting locations and hours determined for this past election? Are there
other potential sites for early voting in the future?
3. The way the ballot questions were communicated was not best practice. The information brochure
about the questions, including the arguments, was mailed AFTER some of the ballots. And the
arguments did not include the authors which is important information for the voters to know. How
can we ensure these issues are resolved in the case of future ballot questions?
4. Do we have a breakdown of how many residents voted early at each of the three locations? Do we
have any demographic info on residents who voted early at each of the locations to help determine
if the locations were accessible to all residents (ward/precinct, age, etc.)?
5. How can we have different, more diverse geographic early voting locations? The locations that we
had in 2021 may not have been easily accessible to all residents, and I would be interested in being
more deliberate in choosing locations that open early in-person voting to a greater number of
residents.
6. There is a real positive to having voting in schools- has the whole community been involved with the
discussion of whether to use schools as polling places?
7. Can you please provide a general overview of the redistricting maps and what are the next steps in
the redistricting process.
8. Of the 14K mail in ballots that were requested, how many were received by mail/drop box prior to
election day. How many were received ON election day in precinct election locations?
9. How is the EC thinking about social media posts and videos to get the word out about early in
person voting, or mail in voting (if available), polling location changes in future elections? Many
people were unaware we had early in person voting this year.
10. How are we engaging the CHA on early in person location options? There are several locations that
would allow for more representative voting locations if we went beyond municipal buildings.
11. The new map introduces a lot of sub-precincts that could lead to voter confusion and
inconvenience. How can we be sure that this is the best possible solution and if it is, what steps are
being taken to minimize voter confusion and inconvenience?
12. Can we be assured that residents in Washington Elms and Newtowne Court will continue to be able
to vote at the Pisani Center?
