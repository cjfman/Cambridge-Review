To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $9,277,190 from Free Cash to the General Fund
School Department Salaries and Wages account ($7,446,360), General Fund School Department
Other Ordinary Maintenance account ($1,781,455), and General Fund School Department Travel
and Training account ($49,375), to fund additional costs associated with the reopening of schools
with health and safety mitigations related to COVID-19. The School Committee Order is
attached.
Re-opening schools during the COVID-19 global pandemic has required substantial investments
in health and safety mitigations, as well as additional staff, technology and instructional supports.
In total, the estimated costs related to preparing and operating the City’s schools for the 2020-21
school year is $16.3 million. The School Department has identified approximately $7 million to
fund these costs: $5.4 million in federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act funding and other grants; and $1.6 million in reallocated FY21 General Fund
budget line items. In order to finance the balance of the estimated costs, an additional $9,277,190
is needed.
Additional costs ($16.3M total) include:
• Health & Safety Expenses ($5.4 million) - including Personal Protective Equipment for staff
and students; additional sinks for hand washing in school buildings; improvements related to
the ventilation systems including air scrubbers with HEPA filters, box fans, window repairs,
an engineering study and a planned project to implement the recommendations of the
engineering study; on-site COVID-19 testing for staff two times per week;
•

Additional School-based Staff ($6.5 million) - in order to support social distancing of 6 feet
within classrooms and to address additional special education service requirements;

Packet Pg. 39

1.2

•

Instructional Supports ($1.9 million) - including the Extended Learning Time program at the
M.L. King School and Fletcher Maynard Academy; instructional materials sent home to
students who are learning remotely; expanded summer programming; funding for planning
time for teachers and paraprofessionals working in-person;

•

Technology ($1.3 million) - Including additional Chromebooks (to ensure that every student
has one); additional and expanded software licenses to support remote learning; system
upgrades; Hot Spots for families; additional technology staff to support expanded technology
and data needs;

•

Planning & Engagement ($688K) - including educator Collaboratives; task force and
working groups; school planning; principal and summer work;

•

School Lunch Program ($470K) - The USDA has issued a waiver that allows the district to
offer free meals to all students, not just those who qualify for Free/Reduced lunch. The
additional costs in this category primarily reflect the estimated lost revenue from paid
lunches. In addition, the Department has purchased additional equipment, including carts for
transporting meals to classrooms and tablets for meal tracking during distribution.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to ask for your approval to allow members of adjudicatory boards and commissions
such as the Planning Board, the Board of Zoning Appeal, the Historical Commission, the
Conservation Commission and the License Commission, among other adjudicatory bodies, to
vote on a matter before the adjudicatory body of which they are a member if the board member
has missed one of the sessions regarding the matter at issue.
Chapter 39, Section 23D of the Massachusetts General Laws, known as the “Mullin Rule” (see
attached statutory language), provides that members of municipal boards or commissions who
are absent from no more than one session of an adjudicatory hearing may still act on the matter at
a future session, provided that the municipality accepts this section of the law and that the absent
member reviews a transcript or video or audio recording of the hearing and certifies that they
have done so. This statute is known as the Mullin Rule because it overturns in part a court case
which had provided that only members present at all sessions of an adjudicatory hearing on a
particular matter are eligible to vote on that matter. Mullin v. Planning Board of Brewster, 17
Mass.App.Ct. 139 (1983).
On a number of past occasions, hearing sessions have needed to be postponed on short notice
due to a member’s unanticipated absence for illness or other reasons, causing inconvenience to
members of the public and applicants. Acceptance of the Mullin Rule for adjudicatory boards
and commissions in Cambridge would help to forestall some of these issues in the future.
Therefore, I am hereby requesting that the City Council accept the provisions of G.L. c.39,
§23D.
I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

planting, watering and maintaining said Replacement Trees for a period of not less
than five years.
ORDERED

That the city manager communicate this extension to the residents and property owners
of the City of Cambridge as done previously.

Dear Councilors,

The Alliance wants to state its support for the recommendation for the Broadband RFP which
were made by Upgrade Cambridge, see below.

Attachment: Lee Farris_Fwd Broadband RFP suggestions (COM 774 #2020 : A communication was received from Lee Farris)

The Cambridge Residents Alliance is dismayed to hear that the city still has not produced
a municipal broadband RFP, after many efforts by the Council over these past months. I agree
with the Committee Chair, Patty Nolan, that the Council should draft an RFP based on the 2017
draft RFP.

We also want to reiterate the urgency of addressing the digital divide, which requires separate
additional steps. The new study by AG Maura Healey
"called “Building Toward Racial Justice and Equity in Health: A Call to Action,” outlines five steps
to combat medical inequities in Massachusetts that have existed for years and have been laid
bare by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Healey.
Among the recommendations from Healey’s office were calls to improve how the state and its
more than 350 municipalities report on patient race, ethnicity and other demographic
characteristics to identify disparities, reduce patient cost-sharing so underserved patients can get
the services they need and address the divide in digital access among patients by increasing the
availability of free and low-cost internet."
We hope the Council can finalize a strong, effective municipal broadband RFP as soon as possible.
Sincerely,
Lee Farris

Subject: Upgrade Cambridge Newsletter #27: Just what should be in a municipal broadband
feasibility study anyway?
Date: November 9, 2020 at 9:36:51 PM EST

When the City does issue an RFP, this is what Upgrade Cambridge will be looking for:
•

Does the RFP call for an analysis of a fiber optic network that connects to, or
passes by, every premises in Cambridge? If the City is going to do the work of

•

analysis, if shouldn’t be analyzing partial solutions. While there may be small exceptions,
like MIT or Harvard dormitories that are already well connected, this analysis should be of
a network for all of Cambridge. All residences and businesses must be included.
Does the RFP state that Cambridge should own the network it builds? Cambridge
should own the infrastructure that it builds, just as it owns streets, sidewalks, and water
and sewer pipes. This is necessary so that Cambridge can shape policies that protect
network neutrality, privacy, and pricing. This is not something about which Cambridge
should compromise.
Does the scope of work allow for a full cost estimate for building the network? One
of the core weaknesses of the work of the Broadband Task Force was that the scope of
work imposed by the City kept it from providing a reliable cost estimate. Cambridge
shouldn’t make the same mistake twice. A full cost estimate is resource intensive and
necessary. The physical network has to be designed and existing infrastructure like empty
conduit needs to be inventoried. Most important, physical facilities like underground
cables and above ground utility poles need to be inspected so that the real and full cost of
adding fiber optic cabling can be estimated.
Is financing of the network treated as a problem to be solved or a fundamental
obstacle? Cambridge routinely finances capital projects that exceed the cost of a fiber
network and cities with far fewer resources than Cambridge finance their own networks.
There are ways to do this that won’t materially impact our credit rating or financial health
and City financing experts need to engage in a problem solving exercise not a
fearmongering one.
Will the process explore the benefits of a ubiquitous, City-owned network aligned
with the needs and values of the community? Understanding costs and risks is
important but so are the benefits. Everyone in Cambridge can benefit from this
investment, whether they are part of a low income family, or a Kendall Square
entrepreneur. How can the City make an informed decision without knowing the expected
non-financial return on the investment.
Will there be robust engagement with the community? The Broadband Task Force
did little more than check the box for community engagement with two low attendance
meetings. The City knows how to practice broad engagement and those skills should be
applied to municipal broadband.
Will the process to assess how many people will subscribe to a municipal service
be open and fair? The core of a feasibility study is assessing the “take rate”, how many

•

people will subscribe. An underestimated take rate will deem a network unfeasible.
Conversely, overestimating it can lead to financial difficulties.
How is the analysis of a business model framed? Operation of the network - the retail
delivery of services to residents - is one of the more complex questions a feasibility study
needs to answer. Upgrade Cambridge favors a model where a private entity or entities
contract with the City to provide services, with the contract constraining the entity to a set
of practices approved by the City.
Will the process assess City staffing expertise? The City has one staffer, its Chief
Information Officer Pat McCormick, with expertise in municipal broadband. Is that actually
enough to be successful?
Are the deliverables designed to make a decision straightforward and a transition
to a build phase easy? A decision to proceed with municipal broadband should be made
by the Council and the Manager, based on the information delivered in this study. We
really don’t need further delays to digest a hundred pages of dense prose. While that
backup detail is necessary, the core of it must be easy for anyone to understand. And,
should the decision be to build it, we shouldn’t need another extended process to begin.
All that work should be front-loaded in the Feasibility Study.
Does the study conflate digital equity and municipal broadband? The City has a
digital equity problem, one that became critical after the pandemic struck. The City needs
to solve that now and municipal broadband can’t happen fast enough to do it. It can, and
should, become a longer term strategic solution by using subscription fees of those with
the ability to pay to subsidize those who can’t.
Is there any extra baggage in the study? The City started to write this RFP just after
the Broadband Task Force completed its work. That draft included elements such as work
on so-called “smart city” investments. While the study must be full and complete, it should
also be singularly focused on building and operating infrastructure. Anything else is a
distraction.

FW: Potential Closure

Dear City Manager, Mayor Siddiqui, and Honorable City Council:
I write to you in order to express my grave concern to a late policy order brought by Mayor Siddiqui, Councilor
Allana Mallon, and further amended by Councilor Quinton Zondervan attempting to immediately shutter all indoor
business activities in Cambridge.
I am in opposition to closing any business but particularly restaurants and hospitality for the following reasons.
1. The transmission studies for indoor activities do not take into consideration masking, social distancing,
UV light and copper lined HEPA air filtration systems, plexiglass, deep cleaning protocols, and other
measures currently employed at my place of work but also in many other businesses.
2. Restaurants provide the only real social gathering spots in the city.
3. With no Federal Stimulus currently on the table or in the foreseeable future many businesses will not
survive this next closure. Additionally the Council has not defined the length of the closure. Despite this
course of action, we still receive tax bills, licensing fees, with next to zero financial support.
4. Lastly Cambridge’s infection rate is currently .32% our cases have risen from 4-5 in the Summer to 44,
48, &23 over the past couple of days. We should be the envy of the nation with metrics like this and in
fact if the Country had the same metrics the entire US would be fully open for business.
The immediate road ahead in the restaurant and hospitality business is, at best, next to impossible. It will become even
more so if we collectively place the risk and burden onto this one group of people the Council feel is expendable.
Hospitality is the lifeblood of this City.
I ask the Council, our City Manager and Governor Baker to allow us to stay open responsibly in order to meet the needs
of the community and all of our stakeholders – including all of our employees and suppliers.
Thank you.
Sincerely,

Re: Please take action immediately to prioritize schools
Petition to Prioritize Schools - Select Comments.pdf

Dear Mayor, City Manager, Health Commissioner, and City Council Members:
I am writing to update you about the letter below, which I posted yesterday on change .org,
here: http://chng.it/cCgpk6Bq
As of this writing, the letter has 239 co-signers. The number of people signing continues to grow.
As you consider our plea, please keep in mind the importance of creating financial relief for the
businesses and workers who would be impacted by any kind of closure.
We are aware at this point that schools are likely to close. We ask that you prioritize schools when planning reopening, so that schools are first to open, last to close.
As one co-signer notes: ""Education is a greater priority than in-restaurant dining."
Also, please communicate early, often, and with transparency about how community spread is
occurring in our community and the methods used to track spread: Ensure that your decisions and
actions are informed by evidence.
As one co-signer notes: I'm signing because in-person learning has been a lifeline for my two daughters,
and having to return to remote learning full-time would have significant negative impact on their health
and well-being. Activities such as indoor dining increases the risk of COVID spread, as demonstrated by
the recent COVID cluster at BWH, which was due in large part to indoor staff dining."
Choosing to not act is itself both a choice and an act--with very real consequences that affect lives.
As one co-signer notes: "I’m an essential worker and my children need in person school to continue. If
schools close, I will consider leaving my work to care/supervise them. This can be prevented if
nonessential businesses are closed to curb rising covid19 rates."
We urge you to act soon and to prioritize schools in your decision-making.
Sincerely,
Ashley Williams

Dear Mayor, City Manager, and City Council Member for Area Nine:
I am sharing with you a letter (below) that I posted today on change.org, here: http://chng.it/cCgpk6Bq. As of
this writing, this letter is actively accruing signatures in an ongoing manner.
Please accept my gratitude for your service to our community during this difficult time. I am writing to plead
that you prioritize the preservation and/or expansion of in-person learning by partially closing (and
offering relief to) non-essential businesses known to contribute to the spread of COVID, in order to stave off
a rise in cases that would result in school closures, which is fast approaching and will not cease unless action
is taken now.
I listened with great interest to the November 16 meeting, and am writing now to implore you to take
immediate action – as had been proposed at that meeting – to “close indoor dining, gyms, casinos and other
non-essential indoor activities as soon as possible . . . and organize a small business and restaurant relief
program that will assist during this second shutdown.” Please also see the Mayor's Policy Order.
Delaying action with another meeting is not the way to respond in a pandemic. You are not kicking the can
down the road on a street lighting project, or a neighborhood renaming, or a new bike lane.
Allow me to remind you what hangs in the balance:
The city's children. Well over a thousand kids throughout Cambridge came back to life, like plants watered
after a long dry spell, when they returned to in-person instruction last month; many more kids are still waiting
for their turn. Please understand that relegating our kids to indefinite “remote learning”--notwithstanding the
notable, worthy, and commendable efforts of our educators--undermines our children's ability to grow,
flourish, and sustain their emotional, mental, and physical health.
Our economy. It is critical to take action now to address the outbreak in order to keep schools open. Inperson instruction has direct effects on our economy. For example, in order to actively participate in our
economy, working parents rely on children remaining in school. Moving all students to remote learning
adversely affects our economy.
Social Inequity. Students currently attending in-person are doing so thanks to the efforts of many people.
Many of these students depend on in-person school for more than academics. In-person public education
offers mental health benefits, social benefits, social-emotional learning and more. These students depend on
in-person schooling for structure, safety, services, social support, and so much more. By not prioritizing
school over recreational activities such as indoor dining, you deepen social inequality.
Human lives. You are endangering the health of essential (and non-essential) workers who are reporting to
work because they have to, and who are exposing themselves and their families to infection. And by enabling
the spread of this disease through your failure to act, you are imperiling those of us who are most vulnerable
to the vicious assault of this virus.
Our future. Without our health and our children, it is hard to imagine a future at all, let alone one which we
would aspire to experience. We understand and acknowledge that there are no easy answers here. The
absence of a federal (or state) response, inclusive of relief for hospitality, retail, and other businesses that rely
on in-person interaction with customers to exist, let alone thrive, makes the decision to place Cambridge in a

modified lockdown heart-wrenching. But that is why we implore you to BOTH partially shut down these
businesses for now, AND establish an emergency relief fund to sustain as many of them – and their
employees – as long as possible through this pandemic winter that confronts us all. Please call upon us to
assist, especially with the latter effort. Can we raise funds? Can we come up with creative outdoor
marketplaces? Can we donate resources to assist the people and businesses most in need of support? Are
there community projects that can be deferred in the interest of dedicating resources to getting all of us
through this difficult season? Regarding shutting down business, you can take action that is less drastic and
more feasible. You are empowered to partially shut down the types of businesses where we and science and
health experts all know transmission is most likely to occur: Limit restaurants and bars to take-out and delivery
only. Keep businesses where people keep their masks on, like stores and hair salons, open, with reduced
occupancy limits.
The longer you wait to take these needed actions, the more lives you imperil; the more light will fade from our
children’s eyes; the darker the winter will loom.
For these reasons, I ask you to take action immediately--before the next scheduled meeting--to prioritize the
preservation and/or expansion of in-person public education in all of the decisions you make on behalf of our
city.
I will update you as signatures accrue. http://chng.it/cCgpk6Bq

We miss the Sullivan Chamber tables

Remote access has in some ways made it easier for more people to take part in City Council meetings, but it has made
some things harder. Transparency in governance is something we should strive for, and meeting the bare requirements
of the public meeting law should not satisfy us. Back when we still met in person, the City Clerk's office did an excellent
job getting copies of late resolutions, late policy orders, proposed amendments and other materials that didn't make it
into the agenda to the public by putting copies on the tables outside and inside the Sullivan Chamber, depending on
whether they were available before or after the start of the meeting.
As our isolation drags on, Councillors and the Clerk circulate these items among themselves, and the public is left in the
cold. The late policy order from the last meeting is the most recent, and possibly the most consequential, example of
items put before the Council for a vote that not a single member of the public has seen. We're lucky if you remember to
read parts of it to us. You need to come up with a means of replacing the Sullivan Chamber tables that will work with our
new system because the current blackout does not serve us well.

Re. Members of Adjudicating Boards being allowed to miss a meeting (Charter Righted
Nov. 16)

Honorably Cambridge City Councillors,
I write to you about the communication transmitted from Mr. DePasquali requesting an allowance of members of
adjudicatory board and commissions to vote on a matter before the body of which they have missed one of the sessions.
This was granted a Charter Right by Quinton Zondervan. I spoke with several adjudicating body members in the interim.
Here is what I learned.
•
•
•
•

Most meetings of the Planning Board, CHC and BZA are decided the same night due in part to the extensive staff
reviews prior to the meeting so this rarely is a factor.
On the quorum issue raised at last week’s meeting – the adjudicating body would still need 5 votes to decide so
this would NOT help alleviate that problem.
According to G.L. Chapter 39, Section 23D “Before any such vote, the member shall certify in writing that he
has examined all evidence received at the missed session, which evidence shall include an audio or video
recording of the missed session or a transcript thereof.”
Consistent with and amplifying on this part of the Ma. law AND for greater professionalism and transparency –
for any project presented before an adjudicating board that includes visual materials – these meetings should be
required to be video-taped or a zoom-recorded so that the members of the adjudicating body can see the
materials presented. A written transcript is simply not enough.

AND ***For reasons of transparency, equity, and better government, these same tape-recordings or zoom-recordings
should be made available to the public on the appropriate Cambridge City website when then are made available to the
adjudicating body members.
Thank you for your consideration.
I am grateful to Councillor Zondervan for providing us another week to examine this issue more closely.
Cordially,

Dear Cambridge City Councilors,
We write with respect to Policy Order 4. This is our position on the matter:
1) We agree that it is incredibly important that neighborhood associations are inclusive and
representative of their neighborhoods. We believe that the work of building a thriving, bonded, inclusive,
and diverse community association is both challenging and critical. It’s especially important today, since
we know that the primary factor in resilience after a disaster is the connectedness of a community. We see
this in action as we face COVID together; Cambridge’s neighborhoods are providing both emotional
support as well as tangible support from volunteers while neighbors are homebound. It’s imperative that
all of our neighbors feel welcome to participate in and benefit from the work of neighborhood
associations. This is an ongoing goal for the Cambridgeport Neighborhood Association, and there is still
plenty of work for us to do. We are committed to continuing to improve, and we embrace productive
conversations that will help us do better.
2) Please remove the specific references to East Cambridge and past events from the Policy Order. By
focusing on one event, they distract from the systemic issues that we all must tackle together.
3) Members have voiced concern that language in the Policy Order amounts to a form of government
overreach. Our commitment is to welcome the City as a partner in our diversity, equity, and inclusion
work while simultaneously retaining our full autonomy as an independent nonprofit organization.
4) As a small group of volunteers, we know that additional time, money, and/or expertise from the city
would help us make progress much more efficiently than the progress we can make on our own. We want
to have a real conversation with the City about how we could work together, and we have a list of ideas
that we’re eager to share. We would embrace a partnership focused on sharing information, resources, and
best practices.
Sincerely,
The Board of the Cambridgeport Neighborhood Association

comment on motion to shut down small businesses: for the official record

I write to register my objection to the motion to shut down all indoor activities in Cambridge. The cost to small
businesses and their employees would be devastating. The most vulnerable members of our community, those who
work in restaurants and small businesses, some of whom are now only working part time, some who are
undocumented, and many who are without health insurance, will find themselves homeless and food insecure. As
someone who has lived in Cambridge for over 30 years, I have come to appreciate the important role small businesses
and restaurants have in creating and sustaining the diverse and vibrant culture of Cambridge. Closing them will have
disastrous consequences for the most vulnerable members of our community, and for the community at large.
We owe these members of our community our solidarity and support, including a moratorium on their rent and other
critical relief efforts. They need places to live and food to feed their children.
Please include my statement in the official record.
Patricia Illingworth

My Public Comments for 11/19 Hearing with WMBE's
city_of_boston_rfp.disparitystudy_10-09-17 (2).pdf

Dear Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon and City Councillors
Re: 11/19 Cambridge City Council Committee hearing on opportunities for MWBEs and historically
disadvantaged businesses
I write to you as a Cambridge business owner of 25 years, member of Cambridge Local First, Harvard Square
Business, Central Square Business Association and Sustainable Business Network, and the Black Economic
Development Council (BECMA). I am also the facilitator for the newly formed Cambridge-Somerville Black
Business Network, a program of Port based nonprofit, Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts.
First, I would like to share that I appreciate Pardis Saffari and the Economic Development Department for their
unwavering support of small business in Cambridge. Thank you Vice Mayor Mallon and City Councillors for
addressing this issue. I think this is a good start, but just the beginning.
I wanted to share that there it was very challenging for our Cambridge MWBE’s, especially the Back owned
businesses that I work with to sign up for this hearing. The link was advertised to businesses that people can
sign up starting last Friday. That link was not available until a day before the hearing. Additionally, I do not
think we had enough time to review the presentation the City prepared as well as enough time to
inform and gain participation from WMBE business owners. Evidence of that is the fact that I
personally recruited every single speaker for the public comments portion of the meeting. There was
not enough time and proper outreach to WMBE’s. I suggest we have another hearing and provide ample time
for outreach and review as well as fixing the logistical issues and offer the meeting in the evening so it is easy
for MWBE’s to be heard.
In reviewing the presentation document prepared by the Economic Development Department, it was not clear
to me how many MWBE’s the city is trading with and how it is being tracked. Also, on page 8 of the City’s
presentation, the City referenced the Cambridge Minority Business Enterprise Program (CMBE). Is this
program only for construction projects? It appears that way, so I am wondering about goals for nonconstruction business owners.
We need goals and benchmarks for facilitating opportunities for MBE’s and we need it tracked and reported
regularly. From what I can see, there are no set goals beyond the CMBE for construction. If there are no goals,
how do we hold the city accountable for supporting MWBE’s? We also need regular reporting out to the
community of how the city is doing in contracting with MWBE’s.
The initiatives outlined in the City’s presentation are a good start, but they hardly scratch the surface in
supporting MWBE’s. If we are to tackle addressing the wealth gap in minority communities, we should be
setting bolder initiatives with measurements and greater accountability.
A note about the 30B restrictions can be addressed with a Disparity Study which will give the City the data and
the legal justification to set procurement goals for non-construction businesses. Boston is currently in the
process of completing their study.
It is great to certify MWBE’s, but does the city know how many Cambridge businesses will benefit for the
State’s certification program? We need to look at the needs of the WMBE ecosystem. From what we have

3.11.a

Priority Action List for City of Cambridge, Presented at the MWBE Hearing 11/19 at 2pm
1. We Need Data - We need to know the percentage of contracts the city trades with MWBEs. The State
of MA and City of Boston collect those numbers. How are we to know the progress of the City unless
we have a way to measure it? We request that the City conduct a Disparity Study (see attached copy
of Boston’s RFP for their Disparity Study) to access the following:

a. the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified Minority and
Women-owned Business Enterprises (“MWBEs”) and their actual utilization as contractors and
subcontractors on City contracts;
b. the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified female and
minority workers and their actual hours of employment on City construction projects and on
large City-assisted construction projects;
c. the procurement of Construction, Professional Services (including Finance, Architecture and
Engineering), Standard Services, and Goods for the City;
d. the subcontracting practices of prime contractors/vendors who do business with the City
and other related agencies;
e. minority and women-owned business participation in the private sector; and
f. whether race-and gender-conscious remedies concerning the use of MWBEs on City
contracts and female and minority workers on City construction projects and large City-assisted
construction projects are legally sound, and, if so, what specific remedies may be use.
2. Go beyond the Diversity Directory - The Diversity Directory is good to have, but
how is the city using it? Are there any goals for trading with MWBE’s?
3. Understand Why Black businesses are Leaving Cambridge - We need to know
why Black businesses close and move out of Cambridge.
4. Develop Stronger Mandates for Affordable Rentals for Dormant
Commercial Spaces- We need to deal with the land bankers. Why are commercial
rents so high in Cambridge when we have so many empty storefronts? If the
commercial property remains vacant for a certain period of time, how about having
those landlords offer low or free space to MWBE’s while empty or they pay city taxes for
the equivalent that could be collected if rented?
5. Update the Zoning Table of Uses - They are antiquated and have not been updated
for decades. They are impeding the growth of many entrepreneurs, especially retail and
food makers
6. Increase the Number of Black owned Restaurants, Liquor License holders, and
Retailers in Cambridge - There are less than 5 black owned restaurants out of over
475( pre-pandemic) restaurants in Cambridge and only 2 black owned full liquor
licensee holders, and one is owned by a social club
7. Address Lack of Diversity of Businesses in our Squares - High traffic areas are
untouchable for Black business owners
8. Increase Capacity of Commercial Kitchen Space in Cambridge Support permitted Residential Kitchens, offer commercial kitchen space for food
makers, and seasonal caterers--many of whom are women and minority owned
businesses or self employed workers. There are very few places local food makers can
go in Cambridge to start a food business--they have to go to Boston or Somerville for
this support

Attachment: Nicola Williams_My Public Comments for 1119 Hearing with WMBE's (COM 783 #2020 : A communication was received from

gleaned from our work with the Cambridge-Somerville Black Business Network, many of them are selfemployed. Do you understand the universe of business owners? Retailers, food makers, gig workers, livery
transportation companies, seasonal caterers, and self-employed.

9. Provide More Pop-up and Market Spaces - Since commercial rents are
unaffordable, we need to use city property (or private property) for flea markets, pop up
spaces for entrepreneurs in high traffic areas--not a side street with no traffic
10. Offer Access to Low Tech Incubator Space - There are spaces and places for
high tech and biotech. How about supporting low tech?
11. Offer a “Bow Market” Concept in Cambridge - We need small
business community spaces with shared resources.
Thanks for your attention.

Proposal Information, Process and Conditions

1. Introduction
The City of Boston (the “City”), acting through the Chief of Economic Development (the “Official”),
requests proposals from qualified contractors to assist the City in designing and conducting a Disparity
Study or Studies. The project will proceed in two phases. In Phase I, the consultant will conduct a
Utilization Scan to identify data sources relevant to the overall study. Based on these findings, the
consultant will advise the City on designing a disparity study to address one or more of the following areas
of focus:
a) the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified Minority and Womenowned Business Enterprises (“MWBEs”) and their actual utilization as contractors and
subcontractors on City contracts;
b) the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified female and minority
workers and their actual hours of employment on City construction projects and on large Cityassisted construction projects;
c) the procurement of Construction, Professional Services (including Finance, Architecture and
Engineering), Standard Services, and Goods for the City;
d) the subcontracting practices of prime contractors/vendors who do business with the City and
other related agencies;
e) minority and women-owned business participation in the private sector; and
f) whether race-and gender-conscious remedies concerning the use of MWBEs on City contracts
and female and minority workers on City construction projects and large City-assisted construction
projects are legally sound, and, if so, what specific remedies may be used.

3.11.b

If the City decides to proceed within Phase II, a disparity study will be conducted according to the design
and area of focus chosen by the City upon conclusion of Phase I.
The City will procure these services pursuant to M.G. L. Chapter 30B, section 6.
Any supplemental instructions, amendments, or changes to the RFP shall be in the form of written addenda
to this RFP. If issued, such addenda shall be emailed to all firms on record as having downloaded or
otherwise received the RFP. Such addenda, if any, will be sent no later than five (5) days prior to the
deadline for the submission of proposals.
Failure of any Offeror to acknowledge receipt of any such addenda shall not relieve such Offeror from
any obligation under the proposal as submitted. At the time of the opening of proposals, each Offeror
shall be conclusively presumed to have received and understood all RFP documents, including all
addenda, and the failure of any Offeror to examine any form, instrument, or other document which is part
of the RFP shall in no way relieve such Offeror from any obligation arising under law from the submission
of a proposal.

2. Submittal Process for Proposals
The complete RFP response involves a number of subsections, but the two main sections are a Technical
Proposal and a Price Proposal.
In the Technical Proposal, the Offeror presents its experience and approach in response to the project
requirements set out in this RFP. The Technical Proposal will be in large part based on the response to
the Scope of Services in Section 4.1 and will include all information requested in the RFP except for prices
or costs.
The Price Proposal must be submitted separately from the Technical Proposal pursuant to statute.
This is critically important. The Evaluator or Evaluation Committee will complete its evaluation of the
Technical Proposals prior to reviewing the Price Proposals.
Offerors must submit proposals by delivery of two (2) separate sealed envelopes, one containing the
Technical Proposal and the other containing the Price Proposal. Under no circumstance shall any price
information be included with a Technical Proposal. The inclusion of a Price Proposal or other pricing
information in the same envelope as a Technical Proposal may result in the immediate disqualification of
the RFP response.
All proposals must be received no later than 12:00 pm (noon) on Friday, November 3, 2017. NOTE:
Technical or Price Proposals or any parts thereof received by the Official after the time and date stated
above will be rejected as non-responsive to the RFP. Delivery of proposals to any office or location other
than the location specified below will not constitute receipt by the City. It is the sole responsibility of
Offerors to ensure that Technical and Price Proposals are received at the proper location, prior to the stated
deadline. Offerors should plan accordingly for timely delivery. Faxed or emailed proposals will not be
accepted.

II.

unique and particularized capabilities that the Offeror brings to the project that will provide expert
guidance to the City with respect to municipal executive compensation. Include a projected timeline and
a description of each step along the timeline. Past examples of similar successful projects are encouraged.
This section is a critical component of the proposal and should include a detailed description of the

Prime Contractor
The Offeror will be the prime vendor with ultimate responsibility for the services and

entity other than the Offeror, sufficient information regarding such subcontracted service shall be included
to permit evaluation of the proposal as a whole, and delineated in sufficient detail to guide the
understanding and evaluation of such subcontracted components and services. In particular, it is
anticipated that the successful Offeror may address the need to bring sufficient legal expertise to the study

Any subcontractors and outside associates or consultants required by the Offeror in connection with the
services covered by this contract shall be limited to such individuals or firms as were specifically identified
and agreed to as part of the proposal. Any addition to or substitution of such subcontractors, associates,
or consultants shall be subject to prior written approval of the Official.

Proposal Evaluation and Acceptance
Proposals remain sealed until such time as designated for opening.
Technical proposals will be opened in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and date specified.
A register of proposals, with the name of each Offeror and the number of modifications to the proposal,
if any, will be available for public inspection following the opening of Technical Proposals. However, the
contents of the proposals shall remain confidential until the completion of the City’s evaluations, or until
the time for acceptance specified in the RFP, whichever is earlier. Thereafter, all proposals will be public
records. Do not submit any confidential information as part of your proposal.
An Evaluator or Evaluation Committee appointed by the Official shall be provided with Technical
Proposals in closed session. The Evaluator or Committee will examine each proposal to determine whether
it meets all of the proposal submission requirements. A “responsive” proposal is one that contains all of
the forms and information, and offers all of the equipment, supplies, or services requested in the RFP. A
“responsible” proposal is one that demonstrates the capability, integrity, and reliability of the Offeror to
perform under the contract to be awarded. Any proposal which fails to include all of the information
or documentation specified in the proposal submission requirements is non-responsive and may be
rejected.
The Evaluator or Evaluation Committee may contact client references to assess the Offeror’s performance
and responsibility, and to assess and validate the client’s satisfaction with the Offeror’s services. The City
reserves the right to contact additional references or otherwise investigate Offeror’s performance in past
projects to further assess its responsiveness and responsibility.
Based upon the results of the evaluation, the City may in its discretion, identify individual Offerors to
participate in onsite presentations and interviews. Such Offerors will be notified in advance in writing of
the date and time for presentations and interviews, if any.
The Evaluator or Evaluation Committee will evaluate the Offeror’s responses as they relate to the
requirements of the RFP. The Evaluator or Committee will evaluate the proposals and make
recommendations to the Official.
The Official will open and evaluate the Price Proposals so as to avoid disclosure to the individuals
evaluating the technical/non-price proposals until such evaluations are complete.

not like the fact that the ECPT is mentioned

This is I response to your Policy Order POR 2020 #275
I read with great concern the articles about the East Cambridge Planning Team
in the papers. It seems that both parties were on a group email. What was said was
between these two people. The City should not be involved in this. The ECPT should
not be involved in this. It is between the two individuals. They have to settle this
together. Before the ECPT gets a bad name because two people did not like what one wrote
about the other has nothing to do with the ECPT. My question to you is if a Council member
or a member on the City Payroll makes a comment that someone does not like, is the whole
city responsible for this person. Will the city make a formal – city wide – apology to the
person who was insulted. I doubt it. I think it is a disgrace that the City is getting involved
and putting blame on the whole ECPT.

I do not like the way the ECPT is being dragged into this. I hope this letter will help
those of you who do not know anything about the ECPT understand something about
the group as a whole.
I am a second generation member of this organization. It was originally called
The East Cambridge Stabilization Group. My Father was a member of this group
back in the 60-70’s. When he passed I went to a few meetings and have been a member
ever since some time in 1979.
Yes the members do not always agree with one another. Yes someone might say something
that is not appropriate at the time. We have always been able to settle our differences among
our selves without getting the city involved. We always agreed to disagree.
The group email that has been set-up by the ECPT is supposed to be about helping and
discussing what is happening in the area. It is not to attack one another. I did see a comment
once that I felt was inappropriate and replied to the person who wrote it. He apologized and
that was the end of it. It did not make the papers or go viral on any web site.
The East Cambridge Planning Team is a group of residence of East Cambridge. The area
is the Railroad tracks to the West, the Charles River to the East, Broadway to the

South and the City line to the North. Any resident 18 year or older can come done and give
their option on any topic on the agenda. It does not matter if you rent or own a house. No one
ask if you rent or own where you live.
When you start in a new group, most people feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I still feel
uncomfortable at these meeting being one of the oldest member in age and time. For the most
part the members are respectful. Yes things can get hot and heavy at meeting when people
do not give others a chance to get heard. The ECPT is not just for those who have lived
in the area all their lives or for many years. It is for all residents who are concerned in
issues going on in the area. Some members left because they felt they were not welcomed.
I tried to make everyone feel welcomed as most member do. If someone does not agree with
your options, it does not mean you are not welcome. I would have been out a long time ago.
I do not agree with some decisions. I make my feelings heard. If the letter from the ECPT
Is not what I feel about a project, I have the right to write my own letter saying what I feel.
For the record I do write my letter.
The ECPT has always welcomed people from other parts of the city and from other Cities
to come down to our meetings. The ECPT has always asked members of The City Council
down to our meetings. Some members have been down to see how we work with the
Developers and their lawyers. These members of the City Council that came down to the
meetings got the info about a project direct from the members of the ECPT. Many projects
have gone on in this part of the City. Many options are out there. Did I agree with all of them
no. Did I say I did not like them – yes. Was I not welcomed by the ECPT or the Developers in
following meetings no. We welcome all people down to the meetings and listen to all
comments.
Thank you for reading this

Charter Right 3

Dear Members of the City Council
By now you have heard from more small business owners directly than probably at any point in your terms as
councillors. No one can express better than they can the damage a closure that lacks State or Federal aid will bring. I
won’t belabor the point. We cannot shut down on our own. There are many complexities, and our businesses will need a
bailout no municipality can provide, not even Cambridge.
I do want to take the moment to highlight another troubling aspect of the last week, and something we need your help
to fix. It’s a situation we find ourselves in too often. Please stop pitting business realities against other community
interests. This time its businesses vs kids going to school. The responsibility for creating dialog that puts us in these
situations lies squarely on the shoulders of this council. This isn’t the only example.
I have the utmost respect for the 9 seats that you occupy and how challenging your roles have become during the
pandemic. Right now, we need balance. We need thoughtful policy that brings us all along. We need support and
predictability. Instead this has created chaos and a notion that all we care about is making money. Trust me, money is
not being made. This is survival. You need to stop making us the enemy. Business owners are community members. The
chasm you have created between yourself and many of our members since the bike lane conversation is deep, very
deep. You hit them when they were down and didn’t defend them when they were vilified. You could have, but you
chose not to. Now when I ask them to reach out to the council, they think it's “completely pointless”. You have lost
them, and this is the sequel.
Regain their trust. Withdraw this policy order and let the City Manager and our public health department continue to
drive the policies that have produced successful results for the city. Let’s continue to find ways to work together and
support programs that lift up the business community, like the homeless meals program, outdoor dining enhancements,
the reduction of fees, patio heater reimbursements, new grants, low interest loans, bulk purchasing, and multiple
targeted campaigns. Let’s continue to increase access to testing. The list of accomplishments is greater than in other
communities. Let’s build on it.
Let’s continue to encourage safe operations of all of our small businesses and if more resources are needed, let’s help
find them. Business owners are as concerned for the safety of others as you are. They have invested money they don’t
have in order to adapt to new rules, to make their spaces safer. I speak with them every day. They need to be open, they
don’t have a choice. There is no state or federal plan to allow a closure. They have bills and debt to pay and need you to
understand that and not cause strain with other constituencies. They need you to work with the City Manager to help
get independent business owners to the other side of the pandemic as intact as possible.
As always, I'm available to discuss what I see happening in the business community if you are interested. Thank you.

Policy Order 4

Policy Order 4.
I write to oppose this policy order.
This order creates a bar of acceptability over which neighborhood groups, but no others, must jump in
order to participate.
It inserts a standard of purity in representation when such standards are hardly reflected in the City’s
many branches, boards, commissions, agencies, task forces, and more importantly its contracts.
While it lets our checks and balances of governance off the hook for their own due diligence, it seeks to
imposes an “equitable access” to its residents’ group by requiring their participants to be confined into a box
that may or may not fit them,
And let me tell you boxes are always small and leave people disenfranchised.
If we were to operate under the requirement of accurate representation even in volunteer organizations
I wonder how many churches, charities, minority advocacy groups, or cultural identity organizations would feel
such a standard can be met in order for them to matter as a community engagement group.
People have the freedom to participate in any group that does not violate laws, even and especially
when it comes to discrimination. Not all groups have a welcoming environment even when operating under
such laws, and we can only try to see their actions in context.
I stopped attending Catholic churches, except for those turning into condos, because of their virulent
campaign against my legal dignity directly conflicted with my own safety, but I would never question their right
to assemble, pray, and perhaps redeem their own. I would still judge them on the face value of their beliefs in
relation to mine, hoping that, even if not diverse in their formation, they could be as accepting of the diversity of
our public experience.
I am indeed baffled that you do not value rights I do the most, our First Amendment rights to freedom of
speech and freedom to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.
In regards to the comment that is the stated excuse for this order, if we need to acknowledge
homophobia, an actionable act under our constitution, a full and fair review should be offered instead of twitter
gossip resembling the rambles of other twitter legislators and administrators, bringing such degradation of
public discourse into this chamber. Who is really being alienated?
Reflect carefully at the standard you want to cast onto other people, as we are all people at the end of
the day. These purity and perfection tests, I am here to bear witness, I have been failing since birth, and
proudly will fail over and over in my quest to be a better person.
Good for you all to be able to claim such highly polished ground from whose slope not to slip.
Withdraw this order. Posturing Tokenism in policing is within the repertoire of fascist strategy.

You know what it is

PO 4
I know I haven't commented in a while, even about things that are important to me, but this has been blowing up my
inbox and directly addresses organizations in which I'm a part of. So here I am.
I'm on the board in an official capacity of two neighborhood associations and one in an unofficial capacity, and the
current discourse about neighborhood groups personally offends me.
The Inmans Square Neighborhood Association mainly focuses on disseminating information to neighbors. Although we
haven't held any meetings since covid started, the board still meets online to address community issues and concerns
raised by our members and to send out emails. We have no requirements or dues to become a voting member. We
reach out to as many people as we can, including actively postering in low income buildings. I haven't been on the
Cambridge Residents Alliance board very long, but I can affirm that we work to support what we believe are progressive
policies for the benefit of all in our community. The Area 4 Coalision doesn't exist in a formal capacity, but a small team
of leaders including myself have been working all year to get internet vouchers to in need families.
I don't think the city council should be involving itself in a conflict between two private citizens even though it was on a
public email list. The council certainly shouldn't be shaming or calling out a single individual. Yes it still counts if you
don't say the person's name. Everyone knows who it is or can google it. That person resigned in shame from the ECPT, so
the other members shouldn't be implicated at all. Although the 'Ordered' section of PO-4 is reasonable, some of the
'where as' and 'resolved' clauses seem to place blame on neighborhood organizations for things they have no control
over. 'Where as' number seven appears to implicate the ECPT as a whole for the actions of a rogue member and doesn't
make it clear that the member resigned nor does it say that the other ECPT leaders condemned that person's comments.
If this were a news article, it would seriously lack journalistic integrity as it doesn't include comments from those named
nor does it say that you reached out to them. 'Where as' nine suggests that the city does empower biggited groups and
that the neighborhood associations are among them. No, 'where as' clause 2 and the first half of six don't make the rest
of it better. I don't object to 'where as 8' or the two 'resolved' clauses, but the only reason why they're there is because
of 'where as' clause 7.
Please clean this up. Outright removing 'where as' clause 7 would probably be good enough to eliminate most criticisms.
Take out 'where as' 9 and there'd be no legitimate criticisms left. I really like the 'ordered clause'. It's well thought out
and good. Don't cloud the goal or, to use your words, alienate those who would otherwise support this PO.
Charter rights 2 and 3 and all other POs
Yes please
On The Table 4
Also yes please. We are so close to a final solution. Don't let the tree cutters have time to do their dirty work.

Re Policy Order re Nhood Groups…
Dear City Councilors,
Please withdraw the policy order re nhood groups. Of course neighborhood groups and everyone else need to be
inclusive and civil, but do we really need a policy order scolding neighborhood associations, and the East Cambridge
Planning Team in particular, because one very antagonized board member misspoke? My heart goes out to the East
Cambridge Planning Team, which is a model for all neighborhood organizations. They have done such outstanding work
advocating for themselves as they endure an onslaught of never ending development.
Have you visited East Cambridge lately? The neighborhood is full of trucks and noise all week long as building after
building is erected and all their open spaces are being built upon. The ECPT needs support, not to be reprimanded. And
so do our neighborhood groups.
Please withdraw your policy order 0-4. It does more harm than good. All of us must strive to do and be better.

Opposition to Policy Order No. 4, City Council mtg. 11- 23 -2020

To All City Officials,
The proposed Policy Order is offensive to all neighborhood groups whose purpose it is to operate independently
and outside of political control.
Aside from what appears to be a veiled attack on the First Amendment rights of Cambridge neighborhood residents, the
Order is based on misinformation, in part resulting from an unfortunate interchange between two individuals.
And that is my point: Whatever you have been told or believe to be a monumental incident perpetrated by the East
Cambridge Planning Team is totally wrong. The Council seems to have misplaced blame for insensitive comments made
by a single individual to another (for which the former individual apologized) onto a whole neighborhood group. And I
believe the fact that the ECPT, by going the extra mile and issuing an apology simply because the offending individual
was a member, further confused your interpretation of where responsibility lies.
Another point that must be made, particularly about the East Cambridge Planning Team: As far as ECPT members
being 'representative' of the neighborhood, as long as I can remember, anyone who lives in our neighborhood
is welcome to join. Any appearance of a lack of diversity might just be the existing characterization of all
interested residents. I am a second generation member of ECPT. My mother was one of the founding
members of what was formerly known as the East Cambridge Stabilization Committee back in the early 70's. I
can tell you that all views and opinions are welcome. Of course there are sometimes disagreements among the
members, but often airing and discussing opposing points of view help to build a stronger final consensus.
Neighborhood groups need to operate uncensored to secure our neighborhood against large developers who
seek only profit. Big companies have unlimited funds to promote their wishes, while the residents have only
their voices. Don't silence them.
Respectfully,
Audrey A Cunningham

Support for late policy order #10 related to indoor dining

Hello Mayor Siddiqui, other City Council members, and City Manager DePasquale, I am writing to express my support for
the late policy order #10 related to closing indoor dining, gyms, and casinos in an effort to slow transmission in our
community. I am very concerned about the growing number of cases in our community in recent weeks. I
appreciate everything the city is doing to prevent the spread, most importantly expanding testing and offering testing in
public schools to teachers and symptomatic learners.
The reason I support this measure is that testing alone seems to be insufficient to stop the spread.I am deeply
concerned about the suffering and death that could arise if you dont take more aggressive measures to slow the spread
in our city. I also worry about the 1500 children who will soon be forced to switch back from in-person to online learning
when schools close. It seems too late to prevent school closure at this point, but I hope that more aggressive mitigation
measures can bring children back to school quicker/ minimize the length of the closure, as they can return as cases go
down again. (My child is one of the children who has benefited immensely from in-person learning.)
I know this is an issue of critical importance to many Cambridge residents. This is a petition that other community
members and I worked on this summer to encourage the same policy. It received over 600 signatures.
http://chng.it/9HjrHhzB. This is a petition that another neighbor started recently, again to promote the same policy
http://chng.it/SgmG7RNZXz. It has received over 200 signatures.
I appreciate the extreme damage this could cause to local businesses if they were to have to temporarily close; and I
appreciate that you are in an amazingly hard position due to lack of federal and state support. There is no easy solution
here. But I hope you choose saving lives and preventing suffering and supporting the emotional, social, and educational
development of our city's youth. I hope for national relief for local businesses in the new year.
Thank you for reading and be well,
Amanda

Dos and Don'ts before Cambridge City Council today (and so new facts on the Crowe
affair)

Dear Cambridge City Council,
I feel a need to offer a few Dos and Don’ts with respect to today’s City Council agenda since the level of dysfunctionality
seems to be reaching a high pitch. Increasingly we are seeing decisions that seem to be as much about political
gamesmanship as about viable policy. A few examples for today’s upcoming meeting make the point clear.
•

•
•

•

•

Please DO open Memorial Drive to walkers and bicyclists week-ends – the whole way.
o Let everyone enjoy this area. This is NOT about East Cambridge versus West Cambridge or about
walkers/bicyclists versus vehicles but about Council doing the best for its residents no matter where
they live or wish to enjoy their weekends.
Please DO NOT pit restaurants against schools in addressing COVID.
o We are in a crisis. Act responsibly. Don’t push false equivalencies.
Please DO make videos (zoom recordings) of governing committee meetings (Planning Board, Cambridge
Historical Commission, BZA)
o Make these available to committee members – and the public – especially if you plan to allow
committee members to miss one meeting that may have critical visual materials.
Please DO NOT get involved in the Arts Council decision-making.
o Cambridge has Plan E for a reason (separation of powers).
o Those of us who participated in the Women’s memorial decision spent hours on it.
o The winner, selected fairly and democratically, was Azra Akšamija, a Sarajevo born artist. If a problem
exists with the “pool” of initial candidates, the Arts Council can fix it the next time – after consulting
with some of us who are professionals and have lots of contacts. We and our professional organizations
do it for free. You do NOT need to pay for a consultant.
o Backtracking on a democratically selected decision is a VERY bad look, and leaves a bad taste, no matter
what the political reasons.
Please DO stop attacking neighborhood groups who are acting within our first amendment rights to meet and
engage in public issues and are working incredibly hard to help the city.
o Learn the facts: Mr. Crowe, the individual maligned in the ECPT “affair” had posted his photo on Etsy
(the public sales site) posing in the garments he made for sale; this public photo was then posted on the
ECPT list serve inappropriately and with an inappropriate comment.
o However, your one-sided Policy Order on this leaves out this fact and that Mr. Crowe frequently attacks
others who oppose his radical views.
o Although it was inappropriate to post Crowe’s publicity photo on the ECPT list serve (or to comment on
personal matters in that context), Mr. Crowe then went on to publish the same and other similar photos
of himself (and the attire he sells) on twitter and in the Cambridge Chronicle article, monetizing this
situation.
o I don’t care about what anyone does for a living, or what they wear, or whom they love, but to politicize
this with a Policy Order attacking the neighborhood group in question is deeply disturbing because ECPT
did EXACTLY the right thing.
o I know what happened because my discussion of the difference between Conservation Districts and
Historic Districts immediately preceded the post with the photo of Mr. Crowe. It happened on Sunday,

October 18, 2020 at 8:23 PM on a discussion titled “Historic District vs. Conservation District.” I was
responding (as an architectural historian and a resident of a Conservation District) to ABC affiliate Justin
Saif because he was confused by how such districts work and how architectural preservation is done.
The very next post after mine was from ABC spokesman Dan Eisner rightly upset with the attack on
Crowe.
The following post was by an ECPT Board member equally concerned. He wrote ”When one starts off
segregating by race, gender and age, as the neighborhood keeps getting painted as ‘White Old Men,’ it is
easy to slip down many slopes. Career and Body Shaming have no real place in these conversations, or
any conversation in a public realm, really. We should all take a look at our tones, we are not just
neighbors, but people who share in the neighborhood, as such we should respect one another. if what
we do behind our home facades is not dangerous or illegal, it is immoral to judge publicly.”
Ilan Levy, V.P. of ECPT next commented: “First apologies for the late reaction, but let us be clear, these
type of personal attack have no place on this list. It was plain wrong for Chris to write what he
posted. I, talking for myself, condemn in strongest possible the terms the content that was
propagated. Whatever our views it’s inadmissible for us to use such tactics, it’s debasing to each of us
and to our East Cambridge community as a whole. I, personally, extend my sincere apologies to
Mr Crowe. As the Vice President of ECPT, i will also make sure we take the necessary steps to insure this
will not happen again.”
Shortly after, formal apologies were made by both the individual and by ECPT to Mr. Crowe and the list
serve itself was changed from a discussion format to announcements only. This is precisely how such
matters should be handled.
What happened next is just plain wrong. Two ABC affiliated Councillors appear to have approached the
Cambridge Chronicle to run an article on the matter (with lengthy quotes from both), along with another
ABC affiliate, Joe Aiello. Meanwhile a Policy Order was being circulated among Councillors (on this same
matter) one that would be submitted on Thursday to Council. Three of the four sponsors are ABC-slate
Councillors. The aim seems to have been to rile up public support against ECPT and neighborhood
groups more generally even before Council met on this.
Aren’t Open Meeting laws supposed to preclude this kind of politicization effort?
Note - a similar thing happened a few weeks ago with Robin Crowe’s deeply fallacious op-ed in the
Cambridge Chronicle on Conservation Districts. This too was published just prior to a Policy Order
submitted to Council by some of the same ABC Councillors citing the same Crowe source and in support
of this fallacious report.

o Why are ABC and its Council affiliates attacking ECPT in this way? Why are they attacking now
and over this matter as well as the proposed East Cambridge Conservation District? It is hard
NOT to see this as linked to the huge financial impacts of developers on this part of the city and
the effective role that ECPT has played in trying to bring a bit of sanity to all the development
that is happening around them.
o Further exacerbating this problem, today’s P.O. (#4) seeks not only to malign ECPT but also to
go far beyond this in seeking to control ALL of the city’s diverse voluntary neighborhood groups
by insisting that we send in demographic data which we do not keep (and probably should not
keep). This same P.O. is insisting that those people who come to our meetings with disruptive
aims and radicalized views should be allowed to derail the critical work we have before us.
o Let’s try to remember we are a democracy.
o The leaders of Cambridge’s many neighborhood groups have, this weekend, spent cumulatively
hundreds of hours writing and rewriting drafts of a shared letter and getting our Boards or
decision making bodies to approve it - reediting this in turn sometimes as each group came in.
You will be receiving this letter from us shortly. That is how democracy works, and several of
the groups who did not join us in this effort simply ran out of time to bring together their
boards to read and comment on the letter in such a rushed manner. We as leaders hold our
offices as elected officials and this is best practices of how a democracy works.

Neighborhood associations deserve scrutiny

Dear City Councilors,
I can't make tonight's meeting, but I want to express my support for policy order #4.
First off, without getting into the questions of neighborhood association policy: A disgusting incident occurred, in a
public way, to a prominent voice in the Cambridge community. This is the kind of thing that Council expresses
resolutions about, and it deserves to be discussed at a committee hearing - even if the outcome of that committee
hearing is just discussion, that discussion matters. If the Council fails to condemn this kind of behavior, it amounts to the
Council saying "yeah that's just life, we accept homophobia in our public discourse". On this basis alone, PO4 should be
passed.
Second off, while there's plenty of time to talk details later, the outcome of that committee hearing should be more
than just discussion. The fact that the ECPT board member felt he could say what he said, frankly, speaks to a mindset of
entitlement. We have set up a system in this city where certain community members get to act like their opinions
matter more than other people's, by virtue of their entrenched positions in quasi-public, unaccountable groups like the
ECPT. They get to be treated as important people, without any obligation to actually earn that importance through
listening to and facilitating the diverse viewpoints of the neighborhoods they represent. It is no wonder that these
people react in an ugly way when that entitlement is challenged.
As a leader in a community group myself, I am very aware of the ease and temptation of letting your group simply be a
mouthpiece for your own opinions, and the challenges in making sure groups help truly make people more engaged and
empowered. Despite their imperfections, I believe that community groups deserve to be a part of Cambridge politics.
But I wonder if "CDD officially gives deference to these groups and recommends them on their webpage" is maybe going
too far.
Thank you,
Allan Sadun

In favor of P.O. 5.4 re: Neighborhood Associations

City Councillors I am in favor of voting to approve P.O. 5.4 concerning neighborhood associations. In particular, I fully support
the ORDERED section, which includes wording that City hosts a meeting to “ensure equitable access to
neighborhood organization” and “create rules and regulations that ensure greater diversity.” Great idea. To
help expedite how this would be accomplished, the following is a questionnaire I put together to fill out when
interviewing neighborhood association candidates as follows:
Y

N

Race
Sex
Religion
Sexual preference
Gender identity
Home ownership status
Old, white, greedy - or Young, hip, underpaid
Want to walk to work
View on renters (good or bad?)
Value of our architectural heritage
Membership in other organizations
National origin
Vote consistently with ABC
Can recognize when you are being conned
Or are you the mark?
Some might say that having the City extend its jurisdiction over private citizens and their volunteer
associations is in clear violation of our 1st Amendment rights. This sounds very implausible. I say, go for it.

Residents Alliance letter to Council re PO #4

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for Cambridge Residents Alliance to express our concern regarding PO #4. The comment of one ECPT board
member on the ECPT listserve was very offensive and inappropriate. However, the board member apologized and
resigned, and the group changed its email practices to allow only posts approved by the leadership, meaning that it is no
longer a discussion list. We believe this incident was a very rare instance of seriously inappropriate behavior, and the
response to it was appropriate. Therefore we do not think the policy order is needed, and we do not think it should
pass.
Neighborhood groups work hard as volunteers to engage with developers and city staff to try to improve our city. The
policy order brings government into the workings of resident groups. Neighborhood groups should not have
government interference or they cease to be relevant. The Council should not vote to create government mechanisms
that oversee or interfere in resident groups.
We all want resident groups to be as diverse and representative as possible, and we think neighborhood groups do work
toward that goal.
We ask you not to vote in favor of this policy order.
Sincerely,
Lee Farris, President
Cambridge Residents Alliance

Dear Cambridge City Councillors,

We, the governing bodies and leaders of the Cambridge Neighborhood Groups listed below,
write to voice our shared concerns with Policy Order 4.
This policy order sadly is taking a one-sided view of one situation in one neighborhood group
and extrapolating from it. We as neighborhood groups have long underscored the importance of
having inclusive, representative neighborhood associations. We believe that neighborhood
associations are a vital part of city life and have a meaningful role as independent organizations
that build community and advocate for the neighborhoods. We realize that our neighborhood
associations themselves do not always reflect the demographics of the communities they serve,
but as in the past, remain committed to demographic diversity. That said, we hope you
recognize that diversity and inclusion will not appear only because of changes to rules and
regulations, as suggested in this order. This is ongoing work for everyone, and we are small
grassroots organizations run by volunteers.
The references to any neighborhood group, including ECPT, in the policy order are
inappropriate; they distract from the larger issues here. ECPT is the oldest neighborhood
association in the city, and in our observation, it has been fairly and thoughtfully run, including
during the recent events, which are now being mischaracterized. The ECPT board member who
made the offending comment has apologized and resigned, the board has apologized, and
ECPT has taken further action to calm this down, including changing its list serve from a
discussion group to an announcement only platform. All references to the East Cambridge
Planning Team and/or this one specific incident should be deleted from the policy order.
Most leaders of neighborhood groups have no way to provide the City with demographics. Our
work is often on-line and we may never see some of the individuals. We don't know where they
live, their ethnicities, or whether they own or rent. We do not think our members would take
kindly to us asking for those details.
Our meetings are open to all; in fact, we beg folks to come. We spread information far and wide,
try to let folks know what is happening and allow them to comment on those happenings. Some
of us don't even have a formal way to sign a letter saying our membership stands for this or
that. True, we sometimes take an unscientific poll, and many speak up, but at the end of the day
any authority our leaders have garnered comes from being seen as honest brokers. We do not
claim to represent anyone but ourselves, although we do our best to think of the interests of all
of our neighbors.
All of our neighborhood groups would love to attract a wider range of membership, more nonwhite members, more renters, but we cannot force anyone to be interested in what we do or
make the time for it. Alas, it is left to those of us who show up to do this largely thankless work
to improve our neighborhoods, provide a platform for discussion, and help in larger and smaller
ways to make the city more livable.

We hope that you recognize the hundreds of hours of volunteer time it takes to run
neighborhood associations, and that the City will recognize our intention to be positive and
productive partners in the enormous project of community building. We ask that this
conversation stay focused on the work of building exemplary neighborhood associations.
While we may ask for the City's help on occasion, it is important that we be independent of the
City, as we sometimes represent our members against them. We act in the best traditions of our
First Amendment right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of
grievances. It is problematic that the policy order claims the City has the right to tell us
specifically how to do so. We want to come to this conversation as independent city bodies, not
combatants.
The governing bodies (Boards and/or Executive Committees) of each of our Neighborhood
Groups each have voted to support this letter. We and other neighborhood groups may also be
writing to you separate letters of concern.

Cordially,
Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods

comments tonight - 11/23

Since we were cut off at 2min vs 3min. Please find my remarks below. Thanks so much!
Good evening councilors
My name is Luis Mejias of 18 Plymouth Street on the border of Wellington-Harrington and East Cambridge, and I
would like to express my support again of Policy Order #267 and #270.
I strongly encourage the Council to approve working with DCR to keep Riverbend Park open beyond November
29th. As I mentioned last week, I wish the policy order went further to encourage expanding Riverbend Park south
and east of Western Avenue all the way to the Longfellow Bridge and on to the Charles River Dam. I was
encouraged by the vote on the amendment last week to do so, but was extremely dismayed by the request for quote
unquote robust process to study it.
We’ve seen this playbook before: something we know would be good urban policy is subject to a robust process that
is designed to fail change. Look at the shared streets program, which was supposed to be a pilot but which got
mired in an obscure, dysfunctional process that led to what seems an administrative decision to pull the plug. I
attended the public meetings about shared streets, and most of the comments expressed by the public appeared
supportive or had concerns that could be easily addressed without scrapping the program entirely.
Exactly what is the goal of a robust process to implement a weekend closure of Memorial Drive south and east of
Western Avenue? The purpose is to squash to the idea so that people traveling through Cambridge in private cars
are given priority over residents who want to walk or ride a bike socially distant from others.
We also heard last week concern about people being outside maskless, particularly young people. Are we really
going to not provide an amenity to the community by deflecting to a non-issue. Where is evidence of COVID spread
outdoors? Why the mention of young people? This age-ist attitude is detrimental to our discourse, and I urge the
council to reject this conjecture .
I mentioned last week that it’s fundamentally unfair that the shared street program was effectively eliminated before
expansion into east Cambridge, the Port, Wellington Harrington. Why are we being excluded? Why does north and
west Cambridge get to enjoy Riverbend Park, while my south and east side of the city remains cut off from the
riverfront by a 4 lane highway? I urge the council to pass the resolution and work with DCR to close Memorial Drive
on weekends. There’s even enough room to close 1/2 of it and greatly increase the space for pedestrians and
bicycle riders. COVID presents an opportunity to do this as a pilot, miring it down with process is not smart.
Finally, on policy order 270 - I strongly encourage the city to shut down indoor activities. It’s appalling that
we’re being told we can’t be with family this week, but you can go sit in a restaurant and share air with
strangers. I’ve expressed my support for our restaurants and retail in the past with robust outdoor options, but in
this wave it makes no sense to continue non-essential indoor activities. Every day is a lost day to prevent the
spread of COVID. Our priority should be our children - schools should be the last to close and first to open. Not
restaurants and gyms and salons. Why aren’t our children our priority?
Thank you.

Comments on Policy Order #4

Elizabeth Gombosi
42 Irving Street
Speaking on Policy Order #4
As a long-term resident of Cambridge and a board member of the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood
Association for over 20 years, I have learned to value the difficult and time-consuming work that this
and similar neighborhood associations do to benefit the quality of life for residents of this City.
Cambridge is a truly unique city, that includes significant history, valuable architecture, a diverse and
wonderfully complex population, and citizens who are willing to spend countless hours and effort to
have it develop in a manner that will preserve and enhance, for all its residents, those things that
make it such a wonderful place to live.
This policy order should be relegated to the trash without further ado. What makes the neighborhood
associations valuable is their independence from the City. Every association is open to ANY resident
who wishes to join and participate. In Mid-Cambridge we have almost 600 members, most of whom
do not actively participate on a regular basis, but value the time and effort we few contribute and they
know they can bring up ANY issues of concern. We have on occasion had heated discussion, but I
don’t believe ANYBODY has felt attacked or diminished or unwelcome.
One injustice by one member of one association (that, by the way, was dealt with promptly and
commendably) does not begin to justify the attempt to stifle free speech by any other organization or
person in this City.
It would be a real loss to this community if we begin to regulate neighborhood participation in any
form.
The City Council has many serious issues to resolve and this kind of distraction (among other recent
ones) is doing a grave disservice to the citizens you represent.

Policy Order #4 Statement

Councilmembers,
The below text is what I said at Council tonight.
---- When participating in a group, using one's personal associations as a reason to attack them is a cruel and
inappropriate behavior -- but one that is not uncommon in neighborhood mailing lists. I have repeatedly been maligned
by because of my employer--including by board members of neighborhood groups.
- I have participated in online community discussions for more than 25 years. I have been involved in communities with
hundreds, or even thousands of people, and no community compares in the slightest way to the toxicity of groups in
local politics in Cambridge.
- This is not specific to a single group. Board members of at least 3 different neighborhood associations have
commented on my personal life in public in ways that have made me feel attacked and unsafe. I have been forced to
avoid participation in groups, fearing for my personal safety as a result of these attacks.
While Policy Order #4 is *triggered* by one incident, the reality is that this is a widespread and common behavior in
Cambridge politics.
I have spoken of these fears before: I have sent emails to Councillors written in tears, fearful of the attacks against me
from board members of multiple neighborhood associations. And while I acknowledge that these realities are not the
responsibility of the Council or the City Administration, I do believe that when these groups are given an official role in
city affairs as they haveI will never truly feel enfranchised in being allowed to share my opinions more broadly.
I am scared to participate in city politics because I fear retribution from board members of neighborhood groups, who
will use my personal life as a weapon against me and my family. I fear this because it has happened.
I will also say that I have seen this can be better. The Cambridgeport mailing list, with newer board members putting
inclusion as a priority, has become more welcoming and inviting. The board have taken steps to reform and truly taken
steps to create a welcoming community. I want to strongly support Rebecca Bowie's comments earlier this evening,
because I think that the work she has helped spearhead can be a model for the city.
Please support Policy Order #4 tonight.
Thanks,
Chris

Monday 11/23/20 Cambridge City Council Meeting - Public Comment

Fritz Donovan – 42 Irving Street, Cambridge 02138 MA
Madam Chair, Councilors –
Policy Order 4 should not exist. By the end of this evening, if there is any common
sense in Cambridge, Policy Order 4 will not exist.
It claims to be based on one outrageously offensive comment made by one board
member of one neighborhood organization which quickly resulted in the board member
apologizing and resigning from the board, and the board making a formal apology to
the offended person. That is how democracy works.
But as a result of those events, we have before us Policy Order 4 which proposes that
the City of Cambridge establish rules and regulations governing all Cambridge
neighborhood organizations’ board membership, codes of conduct, policies and
practices, and prevention of “elevating certain groups and voices over others.” That is
NOT how democracy works.
We are a nation of laws, the foundation of which is the United States Constitution.
Cambridge has laws based on that Constitution. Nowhere in those laws is there a
provision that the Cambridge City Council can dictate Cambridge neighborhood
organizations’ board membership, codes of conduct, policies and practices, or
prevention of “elevating certain groups and voices over others” to any extent other than
provided in the U.S. Constitution.
Policy Order 4 is wrapped in the language of civil rights in an effort to cloak its reality
as an outrageous over-reach power grab. But that description is an understatement; it
is an insult to every Cambridge Neighborhood organization, to every resident of
Cambridge, and to the U.S. Constitution.
The original offense this Policy Order claims to be based on resulted in the offending
board member’s resignation, apology and formal apology by the board. Withdrawal of
this offending Policy Order will not result in quite such drastic punishment, but a formal
apology would be a good start.

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its
departments, and addressing issues through an equity lens; and

WHEREAS:

Racial bias and structural racism within the Arts have created a long, devastating
history of wrongfully blocking artists of color from accessing funding opportunities
within their communities; and

WHEREAS:

As the City continues to support and fund the Arts in a meaningful way, we must
deeply study where racial bias and institutional racism permeates our practices, and
evaluate how those biases and structures determine funding outcomes; and

WHEREAS:

Other municipalities, including Boston, Indianapolis, Sacramento, and Ontario, have
performed or will perform Equity Audits of their Arts Council policies and procedures
to determine where structural racism exists, and pathways to rectify the historical and
current exclusion of artists of color by creating stronger, more inclusive access to
engagement and funding opportunities; and

WHEREAS:

Hiring a consultant to conduct an equity audit is one of the final recommendations
from the Mayor’s Arts Task Force, which states: “Intentionally examining our
practices and laying the right groundwork will benefit the whole City, by adding
vibrant, diverse art to our public art collection, and by increasing well-funded arts
opportunities for a more representative artist community”; and

WHEREAS:

As the recent selection process for the 19th Amendment Centennial Public Art project
was impacted by institutional, racial bias, performing such an equity audit in
Cambridge would help ensure future selection processes embody Cambridge’s
commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that Cambridge is a welcoming
place for all artists; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to explore the feasibility of hiring a
consultant to perform an Equity Audit on the Cambridge Arts Council, and to report
back to the City Council by January 4th, 2021.

WHEREAS:

Beginning in 2019, the City of Cambridge began internal deliberations on how to
properly commemorate the August 2020 centennial anniversary of the passage of the
19th Amendment, which enshrined the right of women to vote in this country’s
elections; and

WHEREAS:

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic dictated that the City’s efforts would largely focus
upon the establishment of a public arts display as a centerpiece of this commemoration,
this was an idea that was rapidly gaining currency by the Fall of 2019; and

WHEREAS:

While a process was initiated to find a suitable artist to bring forth ideas on what this
public arts display might ultimately look like, it has concurrently been recognized that
an additional public arts display underscoring the fact that for women of color, the
rights enshrined in the 19th Amendment, which are rightfully being recognized for their
centennial anniversary this year, for the most part excluded women of color, who were
forced to wait an additional 45 years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to ensure that
they, too, had a full voice in their democracy; and

WHEREAS:

In establishing a separate public arts display to draw attention to the fact that women of
color were largely denied the right to vote until 1965, the City of Cambridge will once
again show how communities can celebrate our history, in all its complexity, as both a
way of better understanding our past and of engaging us all to think more critically
about how we can work to build a better, more inclusive future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council formally go on record in asking the City Manager to work with
the appropriate City Staff in formulating an RFP for a public arts project that will
acknowledge the unfinished work of the 19th Amendment, the importance of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, and how the two pieces of legislation ultimately
complemented one another in helping to shape a more perfect union, and that the City
Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on this matter in
a timely manner.

WHEREAS:

Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic crisis, the City has taken
measures to assist local businesses in weathering the worst of the storm, including
establishing funds to help businesses pay their staffs, their rent, and other critical
operating expenses as these businesses have been temporarily shuttered or operating at
reduced capacity; and

WHEREAS:

While these measures have helped many local businesses, there have been concerns
raised that these measures have not been reaching and not being applied to all
businesses equally, and that Black and Brown-owned businesses have been particularly
hit hard by the financial impact of this pandemic; and

WHEREAS:

The fact that Black and Brown-owned businesses have been among those hardest hit,
and among those least likely to access financial and other forms of assistance, during
this crisis has been in keeping with the broader experience these local businesses have
had as part of the local economy, and the pandemic has laid bare the need for the City
to conduct a greater level of engagement with representatives of the Black and Brownowned business community to ensure that these entities are not only better positioned
to survive the Covid-19 era, but will be poised to thrive more generally as the City
looks to the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Community
Development Department and other pertinent City staff to establish a Black and
Brown-Owned Business Taskforce, to be focused upon strengthening the City’s
outreach efforts, information-sharing, assistance mechanisms, and overall relationship
with local Black and Brown-owned businesses, and to establish a rolling set of
recommendations designed to ensure the City spares no effort in assisting these
businesses; and be it further

WHEREAS:

These groups provide effective ways for residents to have a voice in the shaping of
their neighborhood and the larger Cambridge community; and

WHEREAS:

These groups are often formed and run by volunteers which have various abilities to
promote, advocate, and forward their positions in aggregate for City planning
purposes; and

WHEREAS:

These groups often have membership and boards that struggle to represent the diverse
demographics of their neighborhood and city at large; and

WHEREAS:

Many of these groups are recognized by the City of Cambridge as the de facto voice of
neighborhoods, and many city boards and agencies seek their input for planning
purposes, and yet the groups may not fully represent the broad spectrum of the
neighborhood; and

WHEREAS:

These groups are important and vital and deserve appreciation for trying to represent
residents and amplify the voice of regular people all on a volunteer basis, and yet
at times, these groups can unintentionally alienate certain voices and residents can feel
uncomfortable taking part in meetings or in online conversations; and

No resident should ever have to expose themselves to bigotry and intimidation based
on who they are in order to participate in community life; and

RESOLVED:

That we condemn homophobic bullying and intimidation anywhere in the city, and we
encourage all neighborhood groups and organizations to enact policies to prevent and
sanction such abusive behavior that serves the opposite goal of these groups and
organizations by alienating; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning Committee of the City Council host a
meeting to discuss ways to strengthen community bonds and ensure equitable access to
neighborhood organizations which could include, but not be limited to:
· How the City of Cambridge can support neighborhood organizations
and other community groups to create rules and regulations that ensure
greater diversity and representation on boards and in membership of
these groups and formal codes of conduct to ensure that these groups
create safe and supportive environments for all participants
· Ensure that the City is not systemically elevating certain groups and
voices over others in what should be equal community discussions and
governing processes
· Developing policies and practices to allow members of neighborhood
organizations to formally file complaints and grievances and seek
assistance from the City when discriminatory incidents take place.

November 5, 2020
Dear Mayor Siddiqui:
The Edward J. Collins, Jr. Center for Public Management is pleased to present this proposal to the
Cambridge City Council for an assessment of Cambridge’s options for a charter review.
The Center was established in 2008 in the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies to
further the public service mission of the University of Massachusetts Boston. The Center provides
technical assistance to municipalities, school districts, regional governments, and state agencies on all
aspects of public management.
The Center is a Massachusetts state government entity. Consequently, the laws of the Commonwealth do
not require the City and the University to engage in a statutory procurement process before executing a
contract.
Please review the proposal that follows, and let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for your
consideration.
Sincerely,

Michael Ward

PROPOSAL TO THE CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL
FOR ASSESSMENT OF CAMBRIDGE’S OPTIONS FOR CHARTER REVIEW
1.

Overview

On September 23, 2020, at the request of the City Council, the Collins Center charter project team
presented at a special Council meeting on charters and charter processes. Cambridge is one of only a
dozen or so Massachusetts municipalities to still retain a Plan form of government, and one of only two
remaining cities with a Plan E. The City has had this Plan E charter since 1940, and, to the Center’s
knowledge, it has been never been the subject of a formal review. Best practices suggest that a charter
should be reviewed once every ten years. (Most charters enacted in the last 30 years include a 10-year
review.)
Following the Center’s presentation, the Council has requested further information about what different
charters and forms of government could look like in Cambridge and what charter review pathways might
make the most sense.

2.

Proposed Deliverables and Workplan

This proposal includes the following deliverables:
1. A memo presenting major options of form of government available to Cambridge and the key
differences between them;
2. A memo summarizing the Cambridge City Council’s feedback regarding the current charter and
form of government, and providing options for pathways the Council could take; and
3. (if requested) A presentation of the memos to the City Council.
In order to complete the noted deliverables, the project team proposes the following workplan:
Step 1: Draft first memo
The project team will draft a memo to the Council presenting major options of form of government
available to Cambridge and the key differences between them.
Step 2: Interviews with City Councilors
The project team will interview each City Councilor individually. These interviews will be an opportunity
for the project team to answer any questions from Councilors about the memo, or charters generally,
and to obtain the perspectives of Councilors on the potential need for and possible scope of a review of
Cambridge’s charter.
Step 3: Draft second memo
The project team will draft a memo that compiles the feedback received during the interviews and
provides recommendations for whether a charter review makes sense for the City at that this particular

If requested by the Council, the project team will present the two memos and be available to answer
questions at a Council meeting.

Subject:

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Thursday, November 12th, the School Committee was joined by Dr. Danielle Allen (Harvard
University), Dr. Mauricio Santillana (Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School), and
Dr. Alisa Khan (Boston Children’s Hospital) for a Special Meeting to engage families and educators
of color in a conversation about the updated metrics recommended by CPS’s scientific advisors, which
was tabled by Member Wilson at the November 5th Special Meeting.
After a long discussion with community members of color (including representatives from the
Educators of Color Coalition (EOCC), Cambridge Families of Color Coalition (CFCC),
Cambridge Special Education Parent Advisory Council (SE-PAC), My Brother’s Keeper Cambridge,
and Cambridge NAACP) the School Committee voted to adopt the recommendations. We are
continuing to plan for all scenarios and engaging with community members to improve our
communication.
We continued this conversation with community stakeholders at a Roundtable Meeting on Wednesday,
November 18th, with a focus on ways that the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities
of color may be factored more explicitly into the metrics. I am glad that we are having these discussions,
in order to take a more holistic approach to community health, informed by the many different
perspectives of our families and educators.
On Tuesday, November 17th, the School Committee held a Regular Meeting, where we received
a COVID-19 update from the Superintendent (please see highlighted slides below) and had a robust
conversation about School Committee Member Ethics stemming from a motion filed by the
Governance Subcommittee (item #20-278 on the agenda), before Member Fantini exercised his charter
right to table the vote and further discussion.

The CPS COVID-19 Dashboard has been updated to include the number of confirmed positive cases
as well as the rates of CPS staff participation in the surveillance testing program. And in addition, CPS
and CPHD are collaborating to streamline the data workflow between agencies and websites—the
City’s Data Center now includes metrics used by CPS.
In the event that a temporary shift to fully remote learning is required, as determined by the CPS
COVID-19 metrics, families can expect to see:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Notification via email, as well as by phone for in-person learners
At least 2 days’ notice before the shift takes place
Remote learning schedules and login information from their school
Phone calls from OSS case managers to discuss expectations and support for students with
special needs
A remote meal plan similar to last spring
A school closure of at least 1 week, with in-person education resuming only after two or more
metrics remain below the thresholds for 7 consecutive days

After an amazing pilot of the Local Parks Program this fall, I’m excited to announce that this
winter, my Office and the WorkForce Program are continuing our partnership with Elevate Youth
to launch a virtual program for 4th, 5th, and 6th grade CPS students to stay connected and engage with
interactive activities and challenges.

Our goal is to promote outdoor education, movement, and wellness in the students we serve,
while maintaining social connection through weekly check-ins.
The fun, project-based curriculum will begin the week after Thanksgiving and will run until at
least mid-February.
Weekly themes will include: learning about wildlife in our neighborhoods, cooking and eating
new and interesting foods, participating in group yoga and exercise classes, learning tips and
tricks to get outside in the winter months, and much more!
There will also be an opportunity to join free in-person outings during the weekends (e.g.
