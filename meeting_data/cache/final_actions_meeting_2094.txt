Report on Polystyrene Ordinance implementation

Compliance:
The City of Cambridge polystyrene ordinance took effect on October 20th, 2016. Prior to the ordinance
becoming effective, staff from the Department of Public Works visited nearly all 500 affected food
establishments to inform them of the new ordinance, advise them about how to come into compliance and
shared with them alternatives vis-à-vis non-polystyrene products.
http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/recyclingandtrash Prior to October 20th, 2016, Twentyfive (25) businesses applied for exemptions to the ordinance to drawdown their stock of polystyrene items
(Section 8.70.060 para 3) and exemptions of various durations were granted in accordance with the ordinance
and reflective of remaining volumes of inventory. All exemptions have now expired.
In conducting additional outreach and inspections during late-2017 and early-2018, DPW staff visited
approximately 125 businesses throughout the City and of those visited 90% were found to be in compliance
with the ordinance. We are presently working with those stores that continue to have difficulties so as to bring
them into compliance as soon as possible. Starting again in April 2018, DPW will continue conducting random
inspections of various food establishment that prepare food and provide such to their customers in various
containers.
Continuing Non-compliance will be enforced under Section 8.70.070, Chapter A: “Any Food Establishment who
shall violate any provision of this Chapter shall be liable for a fine of not more than $300 and each day’s
violation shall constitute a separate offense.”
Feedback from Businesses:
As was indicated previously, the polystyrene ordinance has been met with some confusion, skepticism and
some resistance from various business owners across the city. The confusion, skepticism and resistance are
caused by a number of factors:

Expanded Polystyrene vs Oriented Polystyrene. The Polystyrene Ordinance prohibits food
Most businesses understand what expanded polystyrene is (better known as Styrofoam), but many
don’t understand how to determine if an item is oriented polystyrene (examples include hot cup lids,
cold cup lids, and condiment cups) or not. This continues to be identified as a reason for noncompliance among businesses. While most of the plastics in service ware do have a recycle symbol
with a number to indicate what type of plastic the item is composed of, there are those that don’t and
such continues to cause confusion and frustration. At the outset it was noted that oriented
polystyrene was much more prevalent than expanded polystyrene. Some businesses had more than 5
oriented polystyrene items but no expanded polystyrene.

•

Financial Burden. We have heard from businesses concerning the cost of alternative products. For
example; at a Harvard Square establishment, one service item increased in cost from $0.03/unit to
$0.50/unit. In North Cambridge another retailer indicated that their new containers cost three times
more after the ordinance went into effect.

•

Alternative Products. At the outset a number of businesses found it challenging to source alternative
compliant containers, such as coffee lids etc. DPW has distributed and posted information on the DPW
website of vendors that food establishments may contact to find compliant products. DPW has also
worked with popular food-service vendors for small businesses, such as Restaurant Depot in Everett
who seem to be a commonly used vendor among small businesses and who can supply alternatives for
most items that are sought.

Policy Order 255 of 9/25/17 regarding a report on the status of the all-electric
park pilot, the effectiveness of the battery-operated equipment, the potential
for expanding the all-electric park program, and steps being taken on
enforcement and training and to inquire of the feasibility of requiring or
advising landscape companies to provide or require safety masks for
workers.

DATE:

March 20, 2018

In response to the above referenced Awaiting Report please be advised of the following:

All electric pilot status
During the Summer and Fall of 2017 Public Works established green zones in both Green Rose
Park in the Port and Bergin park in North Cambridge and the Water Department tested out the
electric equipment around Fresh Pond as well. Green zones in this context are areas that are
maintained by non-fossil fuel based landscaping equipment. All the equipment that was utilized
for routine maintenance at these locations was battery operated and consisted of a:
60” Ride-on Lawn mower, 33’ and 20” walk behind mowers, a backpack leaf blower, and a hand
held string trimmer.
Overall the lawn mowers performed well and were much quieter than the gas mowers. They
were able to do all required tasks as well as the gas operated mowers. Operators were
comfortable with the use and safety of the mowers. Run time was not an issue as the large

1.3.a

1.3.a

The backpack and handheld equipment was less impressive. Weight, comfort of operation, run
time and quality of the task that the machine was designed for were all issues. Two different
types of leaf blowers were purchased. While the weight was somewhat comparable to their gas
counterparts, the configuration of the equipment and location of the batteries made them
cumbersome to carry. Run time was also an issue, for both models tested. Run time was between
20-40 minutes with a charge time of up to 4hrs. As a result, the battery powered blowers were
viewed as reasonably satisfactory for minor day-to-day cleanups, but for more extensive
cleanups, crews found these blowers to be less powerful and less efficient and frustrating to use.
The handheld string trimmer worked comparable to gas models, but like the blowers lacked
power and operating time. For all the smaller equipment, the constant swapping of batteries and
the sparse availability of electrical connections lead to a significant amount of down time in
terms of equipment functioning.

Potential for expansion
Public Works and the Water Department intend on continuing the electric program in those areas
where we piloted the program last year and plan to expand the use of this equipment to other area
parks where feasible. The larger equipment performed well during the initial pilot phase and
expanding the program slightly over an entire season will allow as to further test its reliability.
The Water Department also plans on incorporating electric mowers into their landscaping
contract to use on the Reservation in CY2019. The potential exists to incrementally expand this
program over time, but as with any plug in vehicle we need to make sure there is enough
infrastructure in place before expanding too quickly. The biggest concern associated with
expansion being the ability to store and charge a large fleet of this equipment. We will continue
to test and use battery operated blowers in all of our in-house managed parks, and will look at
new advances in this technology that will hopefully make them more efficient and reliable as
their gas counterparts.

Enforcement and Training
In September 2016, The License Commission and The Public Works Department held a Training
for all city landscaping contractors along with City staff from all departments who participate in
landscaping activities. They reviewed what is controlled by the leaf blower ordinance related to
time and noise restrictions. There was also a review of best practices including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Personal Protection requirements
Be aware of where you are (abutters – schools etc.)
Avoid large dust plumes
Use longest nozzle
Stop using leaf blowers while playgrounds are in use
Do not use for construction debris

batteries lasted for 5-6 hours on a full charge. The battery-operated mower was not as powerful
as the gas operated mower when mowing thick stands of grass, and was not able to go as fast and
get a quality cut through a thick stand of grass when compared to the gas operated mower.

1.3.a

Wet where possible

In addition, the Commissioner for Public Works and Chair for the License Commission created
Rules and Regulations which apply to all commercial leaf blower operators in the City of
Cambridge and municipal contractors. These Rules and Regulations are currently available in
both English and Spanish and are distributed to all permitted commercial leaf blower operators
and City contractors. They are also readily available on the License Commission’s website.
The current Rules and Regulations require leaf blower operators to use ear protection while
operating the leaf blower. The ear protection must be provided by the employer at no cost to the
employee. In addition, the Rules recommend that leaf blower operators use respiratory and eye
protection. If the employee requires eye and/or respiratory protection, the employer must provide it
at no cost to the employee. After internal discussions and conversations with operators, the
overwhelming response was that even though employers already provided the protection, the
employees decided not to use it. Notwithstanding, the Commissioner for Public Works and the Chair
of the License Commission will continue to discuss whether these Rules should be amended.
The License Commission has published three legal notices in the Cambridge Chronicle regarding
leaf blowers and the limitations set by the ordinance that apply to all persons using leaf blowers
in Cambridge. The License Commission created a specific email for leaf blower complaints and
questions (leafblowers@cambridgema.gov), a specific category in See-Click-Fix, and have hired
a new investigator to assist in the patrolling of the City to ensure compliance. A draft of a “on
the spot” violation ticket has been submitted to the Law Department and is in the process of
being submitted for Court approval. The Board of License Commissioners holds violation
hearings and issues fines, usually of $300.00 per violation which is the maximum allowed by the
Ordinance.
The License Commission implemented a renewal system for commercial leaf blower operators
which ensures companies continue to annually apply for a permit and reinforces training on the
law with these companies and their employees.

Summary
The overall experience thus far with electric equipment has been reasonably positive. Larger
pieces such as the ride-on and walk behind mowers have performed satisfactorily since their size
allows for batteries that can sustain a days’ worth of work. The primary drawback to further
expansion is space and the electrical infrastructure needed to charge this equipment. Smaller
equipment has been less satisfactory, but we continue to look at ways to make such work. City
forces will continue to utilize battery operated blowers and are exploring ways that we can begin
using them in some of our smaller maintenance contracts.
The License Commission is continuing to aggressively enforce the Leaf Blower ordinance and to
ensure all persons are properly informed with regard to the Ordinance and the Rules and
Regulations regarding leaf blowers.

Awaiting Report 18-19 – Central Square Pedestrian Signals

This memorandum summarizes the analysis of the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue with Prospect
Street and River Street, in response to the request from City Council Policy Order #28, adopted on
February 5, 2018 (Awaiting Report 18-19). The order requested that the Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Department (TPT) consider implementing an ALL WALK pedestrian signal, also known as
an exclusive pedestrian phase, to address concerns about conflicts between right turning vehicles and
pedestrians. We understand that the most significant concerns with vehicle conflicts are between
vehicles turning right from River Street northbound to Massachusetts Avenue and pedestrians crossing
the east leg of the intersection (from Carl Barron Plaza to the corner where Starbucks Coffee is located).
This concern is exacerbated by the volume of trucks making this turn, particularly as this turn is part of a
designated truck route.
City Traffic Signal Policy
TPT follows a standard policy of providing concurrent pedestrian phases with through and right turning
vehicle traffic at all locations where conditions permit safe pedestrian/vehicle interactions.
Considerations as to when to separate the movements include:
• Locations where unusual intersection or crosswalk alignment may result in unexpected conflicts,
• Poor sight distance between pedestrians and vehicles, or
• High volumes of turning vehicles (typically considered to be greater than 250 vehicles per hour).
In addition to the concurrent pedestrian phasing, we typically provide a Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPI)
of three to five seconds during which pedestrians are given the walk signal to begin crossing the
intersection in advance of the vehicle green.
This pedestrian signal policy is considered a best practice for walkability and intersection safety across
the country, and is endorsed by the Cambridge Pedestrian Committee and WalkBoston, the regional
pedestrian advocacy group.

Exclusive pedestrian phases are typically used at locations with lower volumes of pedestrians where
drivers may be less likely to expect a pedestrian in the crosswalk during the green phase. In locations of
high pedestrian volumes, our experience shows that pedestrians will disregard the signal indications to
cross parallel to vehicular movements if concurrent phasing is not provided, which can result in
additional confusion and potentially unsafe conflicts (since drivers have the right-of-way when turning
and may not be expecting pedestrians). Pedestrians waiting for an exclusive pedestrian phase experience
considerably higher delay than in a concurrent system, as the walk signals display DON’T WALK
indications in all directions for the majority of the signal cycle. The full traffic signal policy is available
online: http://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/Traffic/official-Signal-Policy.pdf
Existing Conditions
The intersection of Massachusetts Avenue, Prospect Street, and River Street provides crosswalks on all
four legs of the intersection. The northbound, eastbound, and westbound approaches each provide a
through travel lane and a right turn lane for vehicles, while the southbound approach provides a single
shared through/right-turn lane. Bike lanes are provided on Massachusetts Avenue in both directions. Left
turns are prohibited on all four approaches in order to minimize both vehicle-to-pedestrian and vehicleto-vehicle conflicts.
The signal provides a 5-second LPI for both pedestrian phases. Pedestrians cross River Street and
Prospect Street concurrently with the Massachusetts Avenue through and right turning traffic.
Pedestrians cross Massachusetts Avenue concurrently with the Prospect Street and River Street through
and right turning traffic. The signal provides a 90-second cycle during the peak hours.
TPT staff conducted field observations during both the morning and evening peak periods in order to
observe behavior of pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers and assess opportunities for improvements.
During our field visits, we noted that drivers turning right always yielded to pedestrians in the crosswalk.
During a typical signal phase, right turning drivers generally need to wait at least 15 to 20 seconds to
allow the initial group of pedestrians to clear the crosswalk. At times when Red Line trains had recently
arrived, pedestrian volumes are higher and vehicles may need to wait longer prior to finding a gap in
pedestrian volumes.
Turning Volumes
Right turning traffic volumes on all four legs of the intersection are less than 250 vehicles per hour. The
eastbound, westbound, and southbound right turning volumes are all below 100 vehicles per hour
during the peak periods, while the northbound right turning volume is between 160 and 180 vehicles
per hour during the peak periods. Intersection counts indicate that between 1,800 and 2,000 pedestrians
per hour utilize the crosswalks. The east leg crosswalk is the busiest with 650 pedestrians per hour
during the evening peak period.
Travel Delay
During the peak periods, drivers experience an average delay of 25 seconds per vehicle during the
morning peak hour and 31 seconds per vehicle during the afternoon peak hour due to the traffic signal.
Pedestrians experience an average delay of 16 seconds to cross a single leg, while pedestrians crossing
two legs experience an average delay of 11 seconds. Vehicle queues do not typically extend beyond the
adjacent signalized intersections on Prospect Street at Bishop Allen Drive or on River Street at Green
Street except when downstream congestion from other intersections causes traffic to have to stop on
green lights.

Attachment: Central Square Ped Signals (CMA 2018 #68 : AR Response RE: Central Square Pedestrian Signals)

1.4.a

Crash Data
We obtained crash reports for the intersection for the period including 2015 through 2017 in order to
assess any existing pedestrian crash patterns. Crash data indicate that there were only two pedestrianinvolved crashes during that time period, one involving a pedestrian crossing River Street who was struck
by a turning vehicle and one involving a pedestrian crossing the west leg of Massachusetts Avenue who
was struck by a turning vehicle.
Alternative Pedestrian Phasing Options
Our staff analyzed two options to increase separation between pedestrians and turning vehicles; an
exclusive pedestrian phase (the ALL WALK phase discussed in the Policy Order) and a Super LPI that
involves a significantly lengthened Leading Pedestrian Interval.
Exclusive Pedestrian Phase
Implementation of an exclusive pedestrian phase would reduce the total amount of time for both vehicle
phases and the total amount of time for pedestrians to access the intersection. Under this scenario, the
signal would provide a 10-second WALK phase, 18-second FLASHING DON’T WALK clearance phase, and
a two-second ALL RED phase. The remaining 60 seconds of the 90 second cycle would be divided up
between the Massachusetts Avenue and Prospect Street vehicle phases. We did not consider extending
the overall length of the cycle because our signal policy requires signal cycles of less than 90 seconds
unless there is no other feasible alternative.
Under this scenario, pedestrian delay would be an average of 25 seconds per person, an increase of 56
percent for pedestrians crossing a single leg and 127 percent for pedestrians crossing two legs. Average
vehicle delay would be nearly tripled over the existing condition to 68 seconds during the morning peak
hour and 106 seconds during the evening peak hour. Vehicle queues would increase on all approaches,
with northbound queues extending through the adjacent signalized intersection of River Street and
Green Street, potentially compromising safety and operations at that already-complex intersection.
We expect that with this configuration, many pedestrians frustrated with the additional delay will
disregard the DON’T WALK signal indications and continue to cross the road concurrently with through
vehicle traffic. This is particularly likely given the high volume of pedestrians going to and from the Red
Line station, particularly those rushing to make a train or a bus connection. Low compliance with the
signals can cause unexpected conflicts as drivers assume pedestrians should not enter the intersection
during the DON’T WALK phase, while pedestrians continue to expect drivers to yield.
Super LPI
TPT staff developed another alternative to increase separation for pedestrians while maintaining the
current pedestrian phasing scheme which we are calling a “Super LPI.” This would involve separating the
right turn vehicle movements from the through for the first portion of the cycle. Each phase would start
with a 15-second lead phase during which through vehicles and concurrent pedestrian movements are
able to start moving. During this phase, right turning drivers would see a red right arrow indication
coupled with the existing NO TURN ON RED signs. The 15-second initial phase allows the first wave of
pedestrians to get most of the way across the intersection without any vehicle conflicts. The right turn
signal indication would then transition to a flashing yellow right turn arrow, indicating to drivers that
they may turn but they are required to yield before completing the turn. This Super LPI operation
provides greater protection for pedestrians while retaining the concurrent phasing that minimizes delay
for pedestrians. A similar approach has been employed in other locations, including New York City,
Montreal, and Charlotte.

Page 3 of 4

Packet Pg. 29

Attachment: Central Square Ped Signals (CMA 2018 #68 : AR Response RE: Central Square Pedestrian Signals)

1.4.a

This unique signal phasing scheme is only possible for approaches that provide separate through and
right turn lanes in order to allow through vehicles to pass by stopped right turning vehicles. As such, this
phasing could be implemented on the northbound, eastbound, and westbound approaches. The
southbound approach would not be changed under this scenario, however the right turning volume
from Prospect Street onto Massachusetts Avenue is very low at less than 50 vehicles per hour.
Under this scenario, overall vehicle delay would decrease by 10 to 15 percent for through vehicles, as
they will be able to start moving five seconds earlier on each phase compared to existing conditions
(since through vehicles would no longer have to wait for the LPI prior to moving). Pedestrian delay would
be unchanged, and pedestrian conflicts would be reduced.
Conclusions
Based on the analysis between the two alternatives and the existing conditions, the Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Department plans to implement the Super LPI signal phasing, which provides increased
separation between pedestrians and turning vehicles while maintaining the current favorably low delay
for pedestrians. The flashing yellow arrow indications will reinforce that drivers are required to yield to
pedestrians in the crosswalk.
It is also important to note that the Department of Public Works will soon be beginning the design
process for the reconstruction of River Street, which will extend up to this intersection. Should the
change we are proposing not fully address the current concerns at this location, the River Street project
will provide another opportunity to look at this situation and determine whether additional
improvements are needed.

March 26, 2018
To the Honorable, the City Council:
RECOMMENDATIONS
The City administration and City Council continue to recognize the importance of minimizing increases
in water and sewer rates. I recommend that the City Council approve a 0% increase in the water
consumption block rate and a 7.5% increase in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 5.6% increase in
the combined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2018 and ending March 31, 2019. This is the eighth
consecutive year that the City has been able to produce a 0% increase in the water rate.
In last year’s recommendation, the projected FY19 rate increases for water, sewer, and combined were
1.9%, 7.8%, and 6.3%, respectively, based on March 2017 consumption rates and projected budgets. We
have been able to produce a lower water rate than estimated primarily due to lower operating budget
projections in the Water Budget. The sewer rate is slightly lower than anticipated primarily due to the
City issuing less sewer debt during the March 2018 bond sale than we anticipated at this time last year.
In March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates, which determine water and
sewer revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of the timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set
prior to the adoption of both the Cambridge budget and Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
(MWRA) budget; therefore, revenue needs are based upon estimated expenditures. Historically, water and
sewer rates have been established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other related
revenue sources, cover projected annual costs.
WATER
Two major factors determine the rate necessary to generate sufficient revenues: water consumption and
the budget. The total FY19 Water Budget reflects a slight increase from the FY18 Budget. The Water
Department is able to offset costs related to cost-of-living allowances, pensions, and health benefits in the
salaries and wages portion of the operating budget with decreases in debt service payments and chemical
costs.
The planned FY19 capital allocation is $3,500,000 using pay-as-you-go capital funding based on current
revenues. FY19 capital projects include waterworks construction, water treatment plant equipment and
systems upgrades, reservoir facilities improvements, Fresh Pond Master Plan implementation and
reservation projects, reservoir gaging station maintenance, water meter replacement, watershed consulting
services, and hydroelectric renewable energy generation.
Water and sewer charges are directly linked to water consumption, with sewer costs comprising
approximately 75.1% of total water and sewer expenditures. When consumption declines, revenues are

negatively impacted. In the current fiscal year, water is being consumed at a slightly lower rate compared
to the previous fiscal year.
Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of Water Fund projected revenues and expenditures for FY18-23.
Table 7 on page 7 shows actual Water Fund balances for FY13-17 and the projected balance for FY18.

The FY19 Sewer Budget reflects a $2,693,038 increase from the FY18 Budget. This includes the MWRA
assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public Works budget. Debt service on
sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for 90.3% of the total FY19 Sewer Budget.
The preliminary FY19 MWRA assessment is scheduled to increase by $995,110 from the final FY18
assessment. The MWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the MWRA
budget, which is adopted later in spring 2018. These changes have typically been minor in past years.
Unlike the water budget, sewer revenues are credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary
fund that can be drawn upon if the need arises.
Included in the sewer budget are debt service increases attributable to the $16,590,000 general obligation
bonds issued in March 2018, which include sewer projects in Alewife, Cambridgeport, Harvard Square,
and The Port, as well as capital repairs and climate change sewer projects.
The FY19 capital allotment of $1,250,000 in sewer revenues will continue to finance the remedial
reconstruction program and development.
The City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer systems to ensure
Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and environmentally sound water and sewer system. In
addition to the projects currently under way, the City’s five-year capital plan (FY19-23) calls for an
additional investment of approximately $143.3 million (primarily sewer, $118.1 million) in the water and
sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the issuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and
makes adjustments to ensure that debt service cost increases, which impact the sewer rate, are moderate.
Subsidies from the State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan program will cover only $44,374 or 0.2% of the
total debt service of $23,841,310 for all FY19 sewer projects. The City will continue to receive state
subsidies on existing debt. The FY20-23 capital plan includes other projects that may be eligible for
subsidized loans from the state. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects will receive state
subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated based on funding through general
obligation bonds. If state subsidies become available to the City, they will be used to lower the sewer rate
in future years. Table 5 on page 6 shows the detail of sewer-related expenditures and revenues for FY1823.

granted the Clause 41C elderly real estate exemption. For FY18, the income guidelines are as follows:
single, income of $25,721 with assets of $51,439 or less; married, income of $38,582 with assets of
$70,730 or less.
FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR RATES
Overall, the City has been extremely successful over the past five years in producing minimal water and
sewer rate increases. The average annual increases for the FY15-19 period were as follows: water, 0.0%;
sewer, 6.1%; and combined, 4.4%.
Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain five-year forecasts for water, sewer, and combined revenue estimates as well
as Water Fund balances for the past five years and the projected FY18 Fund Balance. Although the City
currently does not project the use of Fund Balance in the out years, it will continue to review appropriate
use of Fund Balance for a specific project, or to lower the rate.

Our water and sewer program is structured to produce reasonable rate increases in the future. The goal of
the City Administration and City Council is to minimize the effects of water and sewer rate increases on
residents as much as possible, while continuing to invest in our infrastructure.

Attachment: FY19 WATER SEWER LETTER - FINAL (CMA 2018 #69 : FY19 Water Sewer Rates)

As can be seen in Table 6, the annual combined water/sewer rate is projected to increase by an average of
approximately 4.8% for FY19-23. The projected increase is the result of the City’s commitment to
bonding sewer infrastructure improvement projects and increases in the MWRA assessment (based on
estimates received from the MWRA). MWRA increases are projected to be 3.8% in FY20-22 and 3.1% in
FY23. If increases in the MWRA assessment are more moderate, the rate increases that are shown will be
lowered. If consumption increases and therefore revenues increase, rate increases will be affected
positively. Conversely, if consumption decreases, there will be a negative effect on water and sewer
revenues.

bike lanes on the longfellow

Hi all,
Just wanted to write a quick note of support for the policy order asking the Council to go on record supporting protected
bike infrastructure on the Longfellow Bridge.
The policy order lays out the case for PBLs on the bridge with exceptional clarity, so I won't go into too many details.
But, briefly, the Longfellow is a key connection between Cambridge and Boston, and even despite uncomfortable
conditions during construction, it has continued to have very significant and increasing bicycle mode share. Currently
none of the bridges over the Charles have safe bike infrastructure. The state's plans for two lanes inbound on the bridge
don't make a lot of sense, because (1) there is only one lane on the approach to the bridge from Cambridge anyway, and
(2) predictions before construction started of heavy backups with only one lane have not come true.
Sincerely,
Nate

Hi all:
A short note of appreciation for the policy order asking the Council to go on record supporting protected bike
infrastructure on the Longfellow.
The Longfellow redesign is a massive opportunity to demonstrate the benefits that can happen if one bridge between
Cambridge and Boston has safe bike infrastructure. We've already seen the bike modeshare grow despite rough
conditions during the construction -- we can start to imagine how it will be even better if cyclists are protected. The
Longfellow can serve as a model for other bridges -- and hopefully other communities!
Thanks again,

a high school bike crash

I am a teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school, and yesterday morning at 7:30am
(3/15/2018), and student was hit while riding his bike to school on Putnam Ave. The student was
riding in the road, exactly where he should have been riding, and was hit from behind on his left side.
The car sent him flying off his bike. His arm is now in a cast due to a wrist fracture, the entire left side
of his face is cut up and bruised, and he has a concussion. He's 14 years old, a freshman.
The driver fled the scene.
I told him he was lucky because he could have died. Then I almost cried on my way to class, thinking
about how easily this crash could have killed him, and how easily these crashes occur.
The only one to blame for this is the City of Cambridge. There is absolutely no reason we should
have a city that forces cyclists to share the road with 4000-pound motorized hunks of metal. This is
the equivalent of a city without sidewalks, where pedestrians are expected to walk in the road. The
price we way for this lack of attention is people's lives.
Please remember this if you are a decision-maker. And if this letter isn't enough to make you see
what matters, then watch the video of Anita Kurmann's death, which you can see at
http://www.massbike.org/. If you are involved in making decisions regarding road infrastructure, then
it is your duty to face reality and be informed, even if it is inconvenient. Because I can't think of a
greater inconvenience than unexpected death.

POR 2018 #74: Preventive Medicine

Dear Cambridge City Council,
"Preventive medicine focuses on the health of individuals, communities, and defined populations. Its goal
is to protect, promote, and maintain health and well-being and to prevent disease, disability, and death."
(ABPM)
I write to you in support of POR 2018 #74, the policy order to promote safety of community members
traveling over Longfellow Bridge by bicycle, as well as greater peace of mind for those who are traversing
by car.
I see these lanes as an engineering form of 'preventive medicine', or an opportunity to intervene before
incidents occur. I urge the Council to continue its course and make sure the DOT does its due diligence in
separating cars and cyclists during this redesign. It is their duty to protect those who ride this bridge,
many of whom are nurses, doctors, caregivers, and staff who have dedicated their lives to assisting
others.
I am a Harvard PhD candidate based in Kendall Square and I collaborate with doctors at MGH for my
work. I've been over the Longfellow Bridge on bike well over 100 times to collect precious research
specimens from the hospital, and I've had countless near misses/close calls with drivers who edge over
into the bike lane, fail to yield, fail to look, etc. Furthermore, the intersections preceding the bridge on
both sides are fatalities waiting to happen. It is imperative that the DOT put thought into how to make
these transition areas efficient and safe for everyone.
Thank you for your hard work and attention to this matter!

Bicycle safety - scary moment

Hi,
I wanted to share a scary moment I had when biking a few months ago.
Riding into work one morning, I was going north on Mass Ave having just passed Vassar. As I was getting to the Albany
intersection, I saw a long line of cars (3 maybe 4) using the bike lane as a right turning lane. I went to the left (and only
legal) lane to continue riding straight but as I reached the corner, I just barely got missed by a driver who had, ironically,
tried to turn right. While the entire intersection is dangerous at these hours, the fact that the only driver doing the right
thing was the one that almost hit me (because of several others that did not care at all about the bike lane) feels like we
need to do a better job of adding protected bike lanes, thereby avoiding these situations.

Thanks,
Zeke Schmois

Trump's 'Middle School Project-Level'
Posters Reveal Much About America's
Blood-Soaked Backing of Saudi Regime
www.commondreams.org
"We make the best equipment in the world, there's nobody
even close, and Saudi Arabia's buying a lot of this
equipment," the president said.

A preliminary protest is planned at MIT this coming Friday, as the Institute will likely still
be on Spring Break -- conveniently -- during Mr. bin Salman's expected visit. Do human rights
matter? Are all foreign tyrants equally welcome in Cambridge? Should we be worried when
massive oil wealth seems to "Trump" all other values in our city, and in our nation? Are massive weapons sales
the most important thing to all of us? When did Saudi Arabia become a democracy? Are the Saudi

Government singularly responsible for an ongoing human catastrophe in Yemen? Are we to allow
a dictatorial "monarch" to attempt to drag our nation into an unprovoked war with
another sovereign nation?
In my view, MIT -- who, for a supposedly "open" academic institution committed to "free and open
inquiry," have remained suspiciously "silent" about this likely visit -- ought to be embarrassed about
their invitation to this foreign tyrant to what is, after all, our community, too.
Thanks you for your attention and consideration. Sincerely, James Williamson 1000 Jackson Pl. (Cambridge)

Saudi Arabia’s 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, heir to the Saudi throne after eliminating his
rivals, is on a two-week whirlwind visit to the United States starting March 19. He plans to cement his ties to
the Trump administration, shore up support for his war in Yemen while whipping up more opposition to Iran,
and make lucrative business deals. From political meetings with Donald Trump and Congress to cultural events
at DC’s Kennedy Center, a talk at MIT, gatherings with tech leaders in Silicon Valley and oil executives in
Houston, the prince will be selling dolled-up versions of both his repressive kingdom and his favorite product
from the House of Saud: himself. But don’t get sucked into the media hype, seeded by well-paid PR firms, that
the prince is a reformer who is bringing substantive change to the kingdom.
MbS, as he is known from his initials, is really a brutal bully responsible for bombing and starving Yemenis.
He’s also gunning for a war with Iran, blaming Iran for the Middle East turmoil. Meanwhile, he recklessly
imposed a blockade of Qatar that has divided the Gulf States and tried to force a bizarre showdown with
Hezbollah in Lebanon by holding Prime Minister Hariri hostage. Recent reports reveal that he has even been
holding his own mother under house arrest, hidden from her husband King Salman, for fear she would stand in
the way of her son’s ruthless power grab.

3.8.a

Yes, it is true that MbS is making some positive reforms. Women will soon be able to drive and the morality
police are not as repressive. Movie theatres are opening, and more cultural events are allowed (although they
must all pass government muster and most are gender-segregated). But these reforms are minor in the larger
picture of a kingdom that brooks no dissent internally and is committing war crimes abroad. According
to Human Rights Watch, “Mohammed bin Salman’s well-funded image as a reformist falls flat in the face of
Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe and scores of activists and political dissidents languishing in Saudi prisons
on spurious charges. Baby steps on women’s rights reforms don’t paper over Saudi Arabia’s systemic abuses.”
The prince’s most destructive policy is his war on Yemen (bin Salman is head of both the military and the
economy). Started in March 2015 in what the prince thought would be a quick and dirty campaign to defeat
the Houthi rebels, the relentless Saudi bombing campaign and restrictions on humanitarian aid have turned
Yemen into the world’s greatest humanitarian disaster. The US participation in this Yemen war includes selling
the Saudis billions of dollars in weapons (Saudi Arabia is the number one purchaser of US weapons) and
providing in-air refueling of their bomber planes. Bin Salman’s visit is coming at precisely the time when the
Senate is embroiled in a debate over Resolution 54, a bipartisan resolution that would end the unauthorized
US military participation in the Yemen conflict. The prince will certainly use his visit to shore up support for the
war, painting it as a fight against the Iran-backed Houthis rather than Saudi interference in Yemen’s internal
affairs.
"Don’t be fooled. Beneath the veneer of reform is a young man who believes that his bloodline gives him the
right to become the next absolute monarch in a family that has ruled the nation with an iron fist since its
founding in 1932."
To consolidate his power at home before the death of his father, King Salman, MbS has just pulled off a heist
that would make bank robber Butch Cassidy green with envy. He rounded up hundreds of his rival elites and
held them hostage in the gilded Ritz-Carlton Hotel until they turned over billions of dollars, real estate and
shares of their companies to his control. According to a New York Times exposé, some detainees were
subjected to such physical abuse that 17 were hospitalized and one died in custody, with a neck that appeared
twisted, a badly swollen body and other signs of abuse.
The whole affair was framed as a fight against corruption, but all transactions were conducted in secret and
outside the law. Those who have been released are banned from travel and are afraid to denounce bin
Salman for fear of further reprisals. Meanwhile, the prince who is portrayed as a Saudi Robin Hood taking from
the elite to spread to the poor bought a $500 million yacht from a Russian vodka financier, a $300 million
French chateau described as “the world’s most expensive home,” and a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci
painting purchased at a Christie’s auction—the most expensive painting ever sold.
So don’t be fooled. Beneath the veneer of reform is a young man who believes that his bloodline gives him the
right to become the next absolute monarch in a family that has ruled the nation with an iron fist since its
founding in 1932. The Saudi kingdom is still governed by an intolerant version of Islam, Wahhabism, and
spreads that ideology around the world. The government still represses the Shia minority and non-Muslims,
and remains a country where atheism is a capital offense and all churches are banned. Free speech and free
association are forbidden. There are no national elections and political parties are banned, as are unions and
most civic organizations. Criticizing the Saudi regime can lead to flogging, harsh jail sentences or beheading.

3.8.a

While Saudi Arabia will soon lose the distinction of being the only country in the world where women can’t
drive, the regime continues to be the world’s most misogynist, gender-segregated country. The guardianship
system gives men authority over the most important decisions in women’s lives, and women are forced to be
covered in black from head to toe when they are out in public.
A repressive kingdom ruled, de facto, by a cunning, 32-year-old strongman who has made hundreds of internal
enemies among the elite and conducts foreign policy in a more impetuous manner than Donald Trump is a
recipe for disaster. The United States should not be arming and abetting this regime and investors dazzled by
the prince’s charm offensive and gobs of money should take a second look. If Saudi Arabia is indeed to move
into the 21st century, it must stop being governed by royalty.

Subject: Rezoning and Increasing Density in Cambridge, Especially Neigborhood Nine
Good Evening,
It's time for Cambridge to get much more serious about rezoning and increasing density. We cannot continue to be
laggards like the rest of the country when it comes to adding units in areas with amenities where car use is not required.
Failing to up-zone is causing economic hardship, inconvenience, increased carbon emissions and air pollution.
Our lifestyles and those of the workers in Cambridge that fuel the economy are now held hostage by the interests of a
small number of home owners who appear at meetings and complain about tiny problems like shadows and noise.
Meanwhile, the greater number of people would benefit from jobs they can walk or use transit to get to and the planet
would benefit from fewer people being on the road and more efficient use of land.
As a home-owner in Neighborhood Nine, I hope that you can heed this call for a general relaxation of height limits,
parking requirements, and unit numbers per lot. This Area is mostly walkable to Harvard and is one of the few in
Cambridge that is not in a 2070 floodplain. This is exactly where serious development should be occurring. Parking
requirements mean more and more surface is covered by non-porous surfaces, which is also bad for flooding, and ugly.

Just like in San Francisco and so many other places in this country, prices are kept up and progress
is held back by "preserving neighborhood character". I want Cambridge to be at the forefront of
convenient, sustainable development - not to be just another collection of single-family homes tangled
up in overbearing zoning regulations that increase cost and stop improvement.
If you have time, please read this Crimson article by a Cambridge resident and Harvard attendee.
Thank you very much for taking this into consideration! Let's be at the forefront and change the spirit of zoning
regulations so that their purpose is incentivizing more density rather than less!
Regards,
Nels M. N. Frye

WHEREAS:

Intergenerational living is a policy alternative used to combat the affordable housing
crisis in many cities, both nationally and internationally; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge is home to a large number of graduate and post-doc students attending local
universities who compete for market rate housing, which often results in long term
family units becoming short term rentals; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge is also home to a large population of seniors, many of whom want to “age
in place” but face the challenges that come with being “overhoused”, such as high tax
bills, trouble with day-to-day maintenance, and loneliness; and

WHEREAS:

Pilot programs in New York, Cleveland, Boston, and elsewhere have been created to
facilitate intergenerational living arrangements, which involve seniors renting spare
rooms in their homes at below market rates to graduate or post-doc students, and on a
case-by-case basis, these arrangements can include assistance with household tasks for
an even lower rate; and

WHEREAS:

These pilot programs have shown numerous positive benefits of intergenerational
living, particularly for senior participants; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Boston is in the midst of piloting such a program; and

WHEREAS:

Many of the graduate and post-doc applicants involved in Boston’s pilot are attending
Cambridge universities, leading the City of Boston to explore extending an invitation
to participate in its pilot to the City of Cambridge, should Cambridge accept that offer;
now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the Community
Development Department, Council on Aging, community liaisons of Harvard, MIT,
and Lesley Universities, our affordable housing nonprofits, and other relevant parties
to explore the possibility of joining the City of Boston in expanding its
intergenerational housing pilot program to the City of Cambridge; and be it further

The City of Cambridge owns a number of vacant properties, including abandoned or

Cambridge is in need of additional affordable housing units, and to meet this critical

housing solutions; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge does not have a complete inventory of its vacant properties and the City’s

WHEREAS:

Mr. Cato Freeman, a person of color who was born into slavery and who remained
enslaved throughout his life, fought valiantly during the Revolutionary War, helping
this country win its independence from British rule in the late 1700s; and

WHEREAS:

It has recently come to light that Cato Freeman – sometimes identified by his slave
name of “Cato Stedman” – was buried in Cambridge alongside his owner, Captain
Ebenezer Stedman, at the Old Harvard Square Burial Ground, yet he has never been
given a fitting burial marker of his own to note his contributions to this country’s
founding; and

WHEREAS:

Similarly, it has come to light that Mr. Neptune Frost, another person of color who
fought during the Revolutionary War and was buried at the Old Harvard Square Burial
Ground, has nearly been lost to history and has never had a proper memorial marker
noting his presence or his contributions to this country’s founding; and

WHEREAS:

It has also come to light that Thaddeus Kosciuszko, who has a marker on the rotunda
of the historic Cambridge Common to note his critical contributions during the
Revolutionary War era, was accompanied by Agrippa Hull, a person of color who was
born free and who served for six years and two months in General Washington's
Continental Army, ultimately earning the Badge of Honor for his service; and

WHEREAS:

Similar to the cases of Cato Freeman and Neptune Frost, no memorial markers or
plaques have been placed upon the Cambridge Common to note Agrippa Hull’s
contributions during the Revolutionary War era; and

WHEREAS:

There were possibly thousands of cases of men and women of color – some born into
slavery, some who spent a portion of their lives in bondage as slaves, and some who
never lived in bondage – who fought bravely and valiantly alongside the other patriots
in General Washington’s Army, yet the majority of their contributions have largely
been lost to history; and

WHEREAS:

As we strive to shine a bright light to achieve a fuller, more accurate sense of our
history, and as part of our efforts to bring these individuals out of the shadows and into
the proper recognition they deserve, it is only right that the City of Cambridge should
seek to create historical markers that note the brave men and women of color who
walked these streets and gave so much of themselves in order to help give rise to the
greatest democracy the world has ever known; and

Packet Pg. 93

5.3

WHEREAS:

During the course of this process of deepening our historical understanding, we may
well uncover evidence of other unsung men and women of color who contributed to
this nation’s founding, and it would be only fitting to ensure that proper historical
markers are erected in their names as we become aware of them; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to appoint an appropriate City
representative to work with the Historical Commission, the Veterans Services
Department, representatives of the Cambridge African American Heritage Trail,
Cambridge Historian Jon Hill, and any other appropriate parties in an effort to place
markers on the graves of Mr. Cato Freeman and Mr. Neptune Frost at the Old Harvard
Square Burial Ground, a marker for Mr. Agrippa Hull on the Cambridge Common, and
markers for any other early unsung patriots of color that we may yet determine have
been hidden in the shadows of history for far too long.

Dynamic Diversity Development Program Update - CPS District Framework strategic goal of ‘Equity and Access’
includes having a district wide staff of at least 30% people of color. Providing all students with access to a diverse
educational staff and role models has both clear quantitative and qualitative benefits for all. CPSD is on the path to
reaching its goals. Relationships and collaboration at every level (internal, local and national) are key. Below are some
highlights of current and expanding work in this area:
• Creation of the Dynamic Diversity Development Initiative (3-D)
o Focus to yield greater synergy between recruitment, hiring, retention and cultural proficiency programs
• Position of Program Manager for Diversity Development
• Equity Initiatives at CRLS: Level Up and 1:1 Technology
• Leadership for Equity training for Principals and administrators, offered by the Disruptive Equity Education Project
(DEEP)
• Cultural Proficiency Train-the-Trainer Program at Wheelock College: Preparing one educator per school to
provide cultural proficiency training and coaching within their school community.
• Para to Teacher Pipeline Partnership
• CEA Educators of Color Committee and the CRLS Educators of Color
• Students as equal partners
Motions were discussed and passed that acknowledged School Committee members’ value statements on the importance
of looking at the budget from various developmental ages and stages.
The School Committee along with Administration re-affirmed their commitment to previously agreed upon measurable
outcomes and will include these in FY 19 Budget. And, while the current standard curriculum review cycles are being
examined; the Superintendent has shared the goal of growing a culture of continuous quality improvement.
Budget Workshops continue with the School Committee vote to adopt FY 19 Budget slated for April 3 rd.

Respectfully,

Marc C. McGovern
The Mayor’s office shares the goal of creating regular joint City Council - School Committee meetings to
collaborate and support highlighting need to work together on larger issues that impact our students, families and
larger Cambridge community. For an official record, members should continue to refer to minutes prepared by
the Executive Secretary to the School Committee. School Committee summaries represent information that the
Mayor’s Office deems relevant for both bodies, and may not include all actions taken by the School Committee. If
you read anything in these communications that you would like to know more about, please reach out to
Educational Liaison Elizabeth Liss (eliss@cambridgema.gov).
