WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge adopted an Incentive Zoning Ordinance in 1988 and amended
it in 2015 to require that new commercial developments make a contribution toward
affordable housing in Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

The Incentive Zoning Ordinance applies to new commercial developments of more
than 30,000 square feet of gross floor area in Cambridge and requires that they make
an affordable housing contribution linked to their permitted square footage; and

WHEREAS:

The City’s most recent Incentive Zoning Nexus and Jobs Linkage Study completed in
2019 concluded that to achieve the full affordable housing subsidy to create low,
moderate, and middle-income housing in Cambridge, the City should implement a
linkage fee of $33.34 per square foot; and

WHEREAS:

In 2020, shortly before the pandemic was declared, the City Council voted to increase
the linkage fee to $20.10 per square foot to reflect the fact that there had not been an
annual increase the previous year, with an understanding that the Council would soon
meet to examine an additional increase beyond the automatic inflation adjustment
increase to $20.31 per square foot in November of 2020; and

WHEREAS:

Until the City Council adopts an updated linkage fee, the City will not receive the full
the affordable housing subsidy calculated by the Nexus Report from new commercial
developments permitted in Cambridge over 30,000 square feet; and

WHEREAS:

Affordable housing was identified as the single most important issue by the largest
number of Cambridge residents in the City’s most recent Cambridge Resident Survey,
with 89% of residents rating “Access to Affordable Housing” in Cambridge as neither
“Excellent” or “Good” and 50% of all residents rating it as “Poor,” the most for any
issue in the survey; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge continues to face an affordable housing crisis, with the median a 3bedroom unit renting for $2,995/month, the median condo costing more than $800,000,
and the median single-family home costing more than $1,600,000 according to data
provided by the City; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That section 11.202(b) of Article 11.000, entitled SPECIAL REGULATIONS, of the
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge, be amended by substitution with the
following text:
(b) Housing Contribution Rate. The Housing Contribution Rate effective upon
ordination shall be thirty-three dollars and thirty-four cents ($33.34) per square foot of
Gross Floor Area devoted to the uses that qualify the new development as an Incentive
Project. The effective rate shall be subject to annual escalation equal to annual
percentage increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Housing Index for BostonBrockton-Nashua, MA-NH-ME-CT or similar index to reflect changes in dollar values
over time; however, annual decreases in CPI shall not cause the contribution rate to be
decreased. The table below is intended to administratively track changes to the
Housing Contribution Rate as it is adjusted over time.
