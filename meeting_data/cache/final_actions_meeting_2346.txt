February 11, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item No. 19-08 (Council Order No. O-3 of January 14, 2019)
and Council Order No. O-9 of January 7, 2019, please be advised of the following:
A letter was sent on January 17, 2019 (attached) from this office to all property owners affected
by the water main break occurring on December 23, 2018 on Craigie Street, and an informational
meeting was held on February 6, 2019 with some of those affected residents to provide
information about the details of the incident in question. Some residents have questioned whether
the support offered to victims of a significant fire could be made available to residents affected
by significant water main breaks when they occur in the City. The City does have supports in
place to assist victims of fire disasters, and in considering the City’s response to this water main
break, I have met with department heads in order to explore ways in which the City might
improve communications and community outreach in response to events such as this.
In regard to the City’s preventative maintenance, repair and monitoring plans, the City has a
long-standing commitment to managing, replacing, and improving our aging utility infrastructure
through a comprehensive capital program. The Cambridge water transmission and distribution
system consists of about 185 miles of underground pipe, 4,450 valves and 1,800 hydrants (the
“Water System”). All these pipes and appurtenances are documented in the City’s GIS system.
Each water main is defined by its age (date installed), material, size and whether it is cement
lined or not.
Because of the various maintenance, prevention, and replacement programs the City undertakes,
there has been a significant reduction in total breaks/leaks in the Water System throughout the
city. The average annual breaks/leaks have dropped by about 50%, from 90 to 46 incidents per
year over the last 15 years. The annual funding for water main rehabilitation has increased on an
annual basis. As an example, the Cambridge Water Department (CWD) FY19 funding for water
main rehabilitation and other related work is about $5M. CWD has also invested over $2M in
new equipment to expand and make CWD’s operations more effective. In addition to CWD’s

Packet Pg. 23

1.1

efforts, the Department of Public Works (DPW) has assisted in substantial water main
rehabilitation work because of needed sewer and storm water infrastructure improvements.
Overall the City has invested over $95M in water main rehabilitation and maintenance in the
Water System since 1995.
The Water System work includes larger neighborhood-wide infrastructure improvements such as
the Whittemore Avenue Sewer Separation project, the recently completed Alewife Sewer
Separation and the ongoing Port Project. These projects address City utilities including water,
sewer and drainage, as well as full street and sidewalk construction and reconstruction. The
capital program also includes smaller individual projects such as the ongoing water main
replacement on Maple Avenue that is being completed in advance of street and sidewalk
reconstruction.
Although it is impossible to predict water main breaks that may occur in the future, CWD has
developed and maintains a Water System rehabilitation program to reduce the potential for
Water System leaks and breaks and to increase the reliability of the Water System. This program
was created based on the Cambridge Water Distribution System Study, which was completed in
March of 1992. The study prioritized water main replacement/rehabilitation recommendations
based on the specific information for each pipe. This information includes; age (date installed),
pipe material, cement lined or not, the Insurance Services Office (ISO) fire flow requirements,
number of leaks and the elevation of the pipe. Routinely, the 1992 study information is updated
in the City’s GIS system as CWD rehabilitates and improves the Water System.
The initial program has expanded to include: annual leak detection; large valve replacement and
exercising; hydrant maintenance, flow testing, repair and replacement; expansion of water
service replacement programs; coordinating work with other City infrastructure improvements;
and the development and expansion of CWD’s in-house water main replacement capabilities.
Below is a brief summary of programs undertaken by CWD to maintain and improve the health
and reliability of the City’s Water System.
1) Annual system wide leak detection: CWD’s most recent contracted leak detection
testing, which included Craigie Street, was completed in December of 2018, and contained
the following quote: “I found the system to be in excellent condition with only 5 leaks located
throughout.” None of the 5 leaks was located on Craigie Street.
2) Valve replacement and exercising program: CWD has replaced, repaired or added
over 2,730 valves in the Water System since 1980 and has also formalized a valve exercising
program. The major benefit of the valve exercising and replacement programs is to minimize
disruption to the City’s water customers. This is obtained by getting to a full water shutdown
in as short a time frame as possible and smallest area as possible to limit damage, the number
of people affected, and to restore water service more quickly.
3) Hydrant maintenance and flow program: Each year, in cooperation with the
Cambridge Fire Department (CFD), every hydrant is tested mechanically to ensure proper
operation and one quarter of the hydrants are flow tested to properly color code the hydrant.
The color coding allows the CFD to easily select the “Best” flowing hydrant or hydrants. As
an example, over 1,065 hydrants have been replaced and/or repaired since 1994. Cambridge
Packet Pg. 24

1.1

is 1 of 5 ISO Class 1 rated cities in the state and 1 of only approximately 350 ISO Class 1
rated cities in the country. This accomplishment reflects the City’s high-quality Water
System meeting the highest standards possible in all categories, including public safety.
4) Water service replacement program: The entire water service from the main to the
meter is the property owner’s responsibility to maintain and repair as required by City
Ordinance. CWD has been replacing water services for a fee, and in the 90’s CWD initiated
incentives to replace lead water services. Since that program started, the CWD has replaced
about 9,400 lead water services.
5) Watermain rehabilitation program: CWD has replaced/rehabilitated or improved about
43 miles of pipe within the Water System since 1992. The rehabilitation of a water main is
based on the following criteria: ISO fire flow requirements, age, material, lined or unlined,
number of breaks and elevation. CWD has expanded this program by staffing and equipping
the distribution division with the tools needed to perform water main replacement and
repairs. This has occurred through the purchase of specialized equipment and tools, such as a
10-wheel dump truck, specialized valve turning equipment, and a vacuum excavator;
increased annual funding; contracting water main replacement and rehabilitation work and
coordinating many projects with DPW, which allows CWD to expand its rehabilitation
efforts. In the 50’s and 60’s, all of the large transmission mains were cement lined. In the
90’s, about 9,500 feet of pipe were cement lined as well. The benefit of cement lining is that
it eliminates pipe corrosion from the inside.
6) Working jointly with the DPW: CWD has expanded its water main rehabilitation and
lead water service replacement programs significantly by working with DPW to plan their
work together. This cooperative approach is more efficient and less disruptive to the
community. Because of this joint effort, 12 of the 43 miles of water mains have been
replaced since 2013. This work is done in collaboration with smaller street and sidewalk
projects, and more comprehensively in conjunction with the larger sewer and drainage
projects such as the recently completed Alewife Sewer Separation and Western Avenue
projects, as well as the upcoming River Street Project.
7) Work with developers: CWD constantly works with developers to improve the Water
System to meet their water supply needs. A good example is Cambridge Crossing, where all
the water mains and supply infrastructure have been upgraded.
8) System modeling: The CWD has a current hydraulic model of the Water System to
enable it to understand and make recommendations to improve it as CWD continues to
rehabilitate the Water System throughout the City.

Use of Cathodic Protection to prolong water main life:
In regard to whether the City’s preventative maintenance plans include cathodic protection,
cathodic protection is not feasible for most of the City’s Water System. Cathodic protection is
an external corrosion reduction methodology that can be used effectively under specific
conditions. These conditions are: electrical continuity must be present throughout the pipe that
needs to be protected, and CWD must have appropriately sized sacrificial anodes with the space
Packet Pg. 25

1.1

to bury them, insulation of the pipe CWD wants to protect from other areas, and the ability to
force an electrical current through the pipe.
Cathodic protection systems are typically installed on pipe that is subject to external corrosion
and/or is made of a thin walled material. A good example is CWD’s force and supply line to and
from Payson Park, the City’s finished water storage tank. This 40” diameter pipe is 3/8” thick
riveted steel that is continuous, is cement lined, has insulated ends, and has a large sacrificial
anode so that a current in the pipe can be impressed to minimize external corrosion.
Installing cathodic protection on all or most of CWD’s Water System would be very
problematic. Most of CWD’s large transmission mains are cement lined cast iron with a very
thick wall usually over 1” (very resistant to external corrosion), have many sections of pipe with
joints that make it difficult to have electrical continuity and there is very little space to install
sacrificial anodes in most of the City’s streets.
In response to the question asked in Awaiting Report No. 19-08 relative to whether there was a
response to Awaiting Report No. 14-132 of November 14, 2014, attached please find a copy of
that response, which was submitted to the City Council on November 24, 2014.

Dear neighbors,
I am writing to you to provide an update on the December 23, 2018 water main break on
Craigie Street and to share information regarding clean-up and recovery efforts. When 1 visited
the area on the morning of December 23rd, I saw firsthand the physical impacts to the
neighborhood and know that this has been a frustrating event for everyone.
Timelme of Water Main Break: The City was notified of the water main break in the early
hours of December 23rd. Water Department crews were dispatched to investigate the situation
and determined that the water main break was on the 24" main on Craigie St. While the water
main is over 100-years old, it was cement lined in 1954 and had no prior history of leaks. Our
most recent annual Citywide leak detection was completed in December of 2018, which
induded Craigie Street. The report by the outside vendor that completed the work contained
the following quote "I found the system to be in excellent condition wfth only 5 leaks located

throughout^
Crews were able to identify and close isolation valves and get a complete shutdown of the main
by 5:30 am. Crews continued working during the day of December 23rd to restore the pipe and
had the main back in service a littte after 7:00 pm. In addition to the disruption of water
service, Mercer Circle ivas flooded,
Clean up and Recovery: During the flooding on Mercer Circle, Eversource shutdown electric
and gas service to a number of properties to ensure safety and DPW opened manhole covers
and catch basins to allow the water to recede as quickly as possible. After the event, DPW
provided additional street sweeping, and trash pickup to residents to facilitate the cleanup
process. Also, Commissioner O'Riordan visited Mercer Circle on Christmas Eve at
approximately 11 am the day after the flood. He knocked on doors of houses identified as
impacted and spoke with those residents that were around at that time asking them if they had
any immediate needs from a DPW perspective.

Claims: We have received questions regarding how to file a claim with the City for loss and
damage to impacted properties. A daim letter can be filed with the City Clerk at City Hall, 795
Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139. We will review each claim on Its merits, but it
is important to know that because a City water main break occurred does not automatically
mean that the City is legally liable for all damage caused by water leaking from the break.
In terms of process, the claim letter should include the daimant's name and address/ phone
number, a description of She incident causing the damages alleged/ the amount of damages
claimed, and any other documentation that the claimant would like the City to consider,
including photos or videos if available and repair estimates or receipts. After receiving a claim,
the Law Department wi!! investigate all the relevant circumstances to determine the cause of
damages alleged, after obtaining relevant information about the incident from other City
departments and possibly from private parties. The Law Department will then determine
whether the City is legally responsible for the damages. The investigation may take up to a few
months depending on how much investigative work is required. Until the investigation is

completed, the City will not be in a position to determine whether it is legally appropriate for us
to pay out on submitted claims.

If you have specific questions or need additional trash pickup, please contact Owen CVRiordan,
Commissioner, DPW/ 617-349-4800 / ooriQrdan@cambridgema.gov. The City will continue to
provide additional trash pickups and support the neighborhood with recovery efforts.

February 11, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-118, regarding a report on funding additional
summer food sites, Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff reports the
following:
The Department of Human Service Programs working with the City Council’s Human Services
and Veteran’s Committee has been planning for possible expansion of summer food sites for the
summer of 2019. For many years, the City was able to operate summer food sites in a number of
parks around the city adjacent to schools that were deemed eligible based on the percentage of
children in that school eligible for free and reduced lunch. Because our schools are not
neighborhood schools, the State no longer allows the schools to be used to make parks eligible.
The summer food eligibility depends on census tracts. Last summer, the city directly funded two
sites that had previously been eligible but were no longer eligible.
As a part of the 2020 budget process, the City Manager has agreed to include additional funding
in the Department’s budget for summer food sites to expand the number of children and youth to
be served. Our proposal for summer food expansion includes three different expansion efforts:
1. We will be piloting evening meals for the youth Summer Basketball Leagues. The Davonte
Neal league operates two evenings a week at Sennott Park, the Sharif Mustafa League operates
two evenings a week at Glacken Field, and there are leagues at Hoyt field four evenings a week.
The City would be responsible for the food costs for the dinners and for additional staffing of
recreation/summer food staff to manage the sites and serve the meals.
2. We will also be piloting evening meals at the six summer movie nights that the Department
runs as well as offering meals at the evening book bike events that operate near different housing
developments.
3. We will be adding a summer lunch site at the Central Square Library in partnership with the

Packet Pg. 35

1.3

library. That site would not be eligible for federal funding and would need to be funded by the
City.
We estimate that the costs for the pilot expansion would be approximately $22,000 for the food
costs and approximately $15,000 for additional youth recreation staff and a summer lead
manager for the evening weekly sites for the summer.
Finally, with the help of Project Bread staff, we were able to work with our state Department of
Education manager to ensure that we can serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals at the
same sites, giving children and youth greater choice in their meals and to address different
dietary needs.
We look forward to seeing how we can continue to expand our food support to Cambridge’s
children and youth.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale

Awaiting Report 18-111
Re: TNC Vehicles Blocking Travel Lanes

The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report 18-111, regarding the uptick in
Transportation Network Company (TNC) associated vehicles blocking travel lanes to pick up and
drop off passengers, and drivers of these vehicles placing peoples’ safety in jeopardy, as well
as adding to the traffic congestion in The Port neighborhood.
The Police Department and the Traffic, Parking & Transportation Department have been working
together to address these concerns. Director Joe Barr is addressing his department’s efforts to work
with TNC’s to create pickup and drop off zones that are integrated into the various mobile apps.
We have seen an increased willingness from the TNC’s to work with municipalities on creating the
ability to notify both drivers and users on acceptable drop off and pick up locations. While these efforts
should reduce improper stopping, enforcement and education by our officers will be the most visible
and effective tactic to curtail this behavior.
For the past two years, all veteran and new police officers have received a block of instruction on the
city’s Vision Zero efforts. A major point of emphasis has been on addressing bicycle lane violations and
other unsafe operation that puts pedestrians and bicyclists at risk. In addition to the city parking violation
B1 for blocked bicycle lane, the legislature passed a new law (MGL ch. 89 s 4D) at the beginning of
2017 that made it a violation of state law to stand or park in a marked bicycle lane. This is an important
new enforcement tool because the violation is issued to the operator of the vehicle and not to the
registered owner as is the case with the city’s parking ticket. In the past, officers received feedback from
commercial vehicle operators and TNC drivers that parking tickets were viewed as a cost of doing
business and were unlikely to deter behavior. The new statute places responsibility on the operator which
then becomes part of their personal driving history. Drivers of TNC and commercial vehicles are much
more likely to change behavior when the violation attaches to them and not their vehicle.

Two of the police department’s current performance measures are tied to assignments conducted to
monitor for bicycle lane violations and for citations issued for these violations. There has been a steady
increase each year in the amount of time officers spend in addressing these violations. In FY18, 1495
enforcement assignments were conducted citywide for bicycle lanes. Officers are directed to self-initiate
activity and to take action whenever violations are observed. In addition, the department is utilizing
analysis of high crash locations and data on requests from the public for enforcement via applications
like See, Click, Fix and MYPD to direct enforcement activity.
The police department currently has two active traffic safety grants that fund enforcement activity. The
grants allow some local discretion to address community concerns. Officers conducting grant activity
have been encouraged to issue citations for blocked bicycle lanes utilizing the new state statute in
addition to other violations that align with our Vision Zero goals.
Traffic Safety grant activity will be increasing in the coming months as the weather improves. This
funding will allow sustained enforcement through the summer and into the early fall. It is important to
note that the police department’s education and enforcement activity is focused on the violation and not
the type of vehicle committing the violation. It is not always immediately clear if a violation committed
by a passenger vehicle with a passenger registration is operating as a TNC.
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions or information needed
regarding this matter, please let me know. The police department will continue to work to identify and
resolve issues that impact specific neighborhoods, areas, and the City as a whole.
Sincerely,

Branville, G. Bard, Jr.

Awaiting Report 18-113 – Neighborhood Walk on Rindge Avenue

This memo is in response to Awaiting Report 18-113 (Order 12 from the October 29, 2018 City Council
Meeting), requesting that the Traffic, Parking, + Transportation Department (TP+T) organize a
neighborhood walk on Rindge Avenue, to analyze congestion and discuss potential mitigation options.
On Wednesday, January 16th, staff members from TP+T walked along Rindge Avenue with Councillor
Craig Kelley and community members to discuss potential safety improvements. Attendees for the walk
included:
•
Craig Kelley, City Councillor
•
Mark Gutierrez, Council Aide
•
Brooke McKenna, TP+T Assistant Director for Street Management
•
Patrick Baxter, TP+T Engineering Manager
•
Najah Casimir, TP+T Communications Manager
•
Two local residents
The walk primarily focused on the intersections at Haskell Street, at Hollis Street / Yerxa Road, and at
Cedar Street/Middlesex Street (where an all-way STOP control was recently installed). Based on the
concerns expressed by the constituents, TP+T agreed to take the following actions:
At Haskell Street
•
Work to ensure that the flashing school zone sign flashes reliably.
•
Investigate potential pavement marking materials that can be used to put crosswalk lines on
the raised intersection, which is made of concrete pavers.
•
Update the current pedestrian signs to school crossing signs with arrow signs.
•
Add additional school crossing signs and arrow signs on the left side of Rindge Avenue, in
both directions.

•
Add a “New Traffic Pattern Ahead” sign on Rindge Avenue, approaching the intersection
from the east.
•
Research best practices on “Stop Sign Ahead” signs and determine if one should be placed
with the “New Traffic Pattern Ahead” sign.
•
Add a left-side stop sign on Rindge Avenue, approaching the intersection from the east.
There was also a discussion about the intersection of Rindge Avenue and Sherman Street. A request was
made to create a left turn lane in the middle of the intersection to help alleviate some of the delay caused
by drivers waiting to turn left onto Sherman. It was determined that this would not be possible as it is
unsafe to have cars sitting in the middle of an intersection, and there is not sufficient width to create a left
turn lane approaching the intersection.
We expect to install the additional signage noted above through the course of the winter, and will follow
up on other policy and study items this spring.

Awaiting Report 18-112 – Request the Department of Conservation and Recreation Take Measures to
Reduce Vehicles Blocking the Exit from the Fresh Pond Mall to Alewife Brook Parkway

This memo is in response to Awaiting Report 18-112 (Order 8 from the October 29, 2018 City Council
Meeting), requesting that we work with staff from the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)
to determine if there are actions that can be taken to reduce the occurrence of vehicles on Alewife Brook
Parkway blocking the exit from the Fresh Pond Mall.
Based on this Policy Order, staff from the Traffic, Parking, + Transportation Department have consulted
with staff from DCR on this issue, and sent the attached letter to DCR Commissioner Leo Roy on this
issue. Based on these discussions, DCR has indicated that they will try to determine if there are any
actions that they can take to address this situation. However, they did note certain specific challenges
associated with this location:
• Because this intersection consists only of highly channelized right turns on to and off of Alewife
Brook Parkway and a pedestrian crossing, this is not a typical intersection where it is possible to
clearly install the type of “don’t block the box” markings and signs that are often used in these
situations.
• During the peak periods, Alewife Brook Parkway experiences significant congestion in this area,
meaning that the blocking of the exit from the Fresh Pond Mall is often unintentional, since
drivers may realize too late that they will be unable leave the intersection and avoiding blocking
the exit.
Notwithstanding these challenges, DCR has indicated that they will continue to look at this location to
determine if there are any physical solutions to this issue, and to coordinate with the State Police on
potential enforcement activities. Staff from Traffic, Parking, + Transportation will follow up with DCR
staff and provide the City Council with an update if any additional information becomes available.

Response to Policy Order #1, adopted 10/1/18
Excerpt of Order: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Department
of Human Service Programs, the Department of Public Works and the Department of Public Health to
identify ways to raise awareness about the prevalence of food allergies and decrease the level of risk
posed by food remnants left in public parks and playgrounds, and report back to the City Council on
this issue.
(For full text: http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=7695)

In response to Cambridge City Council Policy Order 0-1, adopted on October 1, 2018, the
Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) sought to identify practices that other U.S.
municipalities have used to address food allergies and risk of exposure to food remnants in
public parks and playgrounds. CPHD has concluded the following:


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in every 13 children
is affected by food allergies, but the agency has released no evidence-based guidance
regarding how to protect this population in public parks and playgrounds.



Searching beyond the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CPHD did not discover
any established evidence-based solutions in other U.S. municipalities to address food
allergies in public parks.



An educational approach aimed at park-goers regarding the dangers of food to children
with allergies may help educate the public and let parents of allergic children know that the
problem is recognized. CPHD identified two municipalities, Shoreview, MN and Traverse
City, MI, that have conducted educational campaigns on this issue, using park signs to
inform park-goers regarding the dangers of food to children with food allergies. An article
describing the allergy park signs in Traverse City can be found here.
(https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/moms-initiative-gets-signs-placed-at-parks)



Review of the Participatory Budget for fiscal year 2020 revealed a similar project proposal
to post awareness signs in Cambridge parks. The proposal can be found here.
(https://pbcambridgefy20.herokuapp.com/place/549389)



CPHD is concerned that regulations (e.g., no food on play equipment) and strategies (e.g. ,
limiting food to picnic tables, separated play areas, or regular City cleaning of play
equipment and park infrastructure) would be unenforceable, temporary, and offer a false

In summary, there is a dearth of evidence-based interventions to address safety concerns about
food allergies in public parks and playgrounds. An educational campaign in parks through
posting signs is a feasible effort that could raise awareness among park-goers, but this effort
would not guarantee the safety of vulnerable children. It is vital that caregivers continue to
monitor affected children in public spaces.
As with other signage collaborations between CPHD and the Department of Public Works, staff
from both departments will work together to develop and post educational signage at the
various playgrounds throughout the City starting in spring 2019. These signs will be placed in
the 70 playgrounds throughout Cambridge and will inform playground users about the dangers
to children with food allergies of improperly managing food and food remnants in playground
areas.

at mitigation would be more dangerous than assuming caregivers continue to be vigilant in
protecting their children.

Re:

Awaiting Report 18-124, dated November 19, 2018 regarding construction vehicle
parking on Gore Street and potential use of Twin City Plaza

In response to the above referenced awaiting report, please be advised that both DivcoWest and
City staff have reached out to the owner of Twin City Plaza, Regency Centers, to determine if
parking spaces could be made available to the contractor. Unfortunately, Regency Centers is
unable to provide parking spaces due to their leasing commitments and usage patterns of the
parking by their office and retail tenants.
With the completion of the Eversource Gas work in Cambridge, the overall construction activity
and demand for parking has been reduced. The sewer work is on-going and will continue
through late spring in Cambridge, with the work in Somerville continuing through late June.
The contractor is minimizing the overnight setup and impact on parking spaces, although some
materials and equipment need to remain on site in order for work to proceed in a timely manner.
Much of the equipment is kept in the immediate area of work.
The City and DivcoWest have worked together to provide alternative parking for residents that
are impacted by the construction. The City has reduced the fees for monthly parking in the
City’s First Street Garage for residents impacted by the construction (to the wintertime $50 per
month rate) and DivcoWest has paid the monthly fees. To date, 25 residents have enrolled in
the program. Gore Street residents wanting to park in the First Street garage can contact CSL
Consulting at mitigation@csl-consulting.com or by phone at 617-866-8971.

Re:

Awaiting Report AR-18-131 regarding a report on the use of
the cigarette disposal box program, if the program will be
expanded, and any other relevant program details.

In response to the above referenced awaiting report, please be advised that in the spring of
2017 the Department of Public Works (DPW) began installing cigarette disposal boxes
(Sidewalk Butlers), primarily in the Central Square area, as a
pilot project to help curb the litter problem. Approximately 30
of these boxes were placed from Sydney Street to Inman street.
Boxes are checked on a weekly basis by DPW employees, and
while there has been some use, the emptying of them is
infrequent based on the volume of material deposited.
While there are no immediate plans to expand the program,
DPW did recently walk the square with several representatives
from Cambridge Citizens for Smokers rights who pointed out
currently problematic locations and made suggestions for
disposal boxes in other more strategically placed locations.
DPW will review the information they provided and will move
or add a few additional sites. We will also be replacing some
of the older boxes that have fared less well over time with
newer ones.
At this time, we are not proposing to expand the areas where sidewalk butlers are placed, nor
have not had requests from the various business associations or other community members
relative to such. Historically, the cigarette but litter problem has been more concentrated in
Central Square, primarily due to the nature of the existing infrastructure in the square, i.e.
molded bricks sidewalks with larger spaces between bricks and tree grates where cigarettes
litter gets lodged and is difficult to remove.

“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Councillor Kelley convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing
was being audio and video recorded. He highlighted the format of the hearing.
Councillor Zondervan gave a PowerPoint Presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated that the
current Tree Protection Ordinance was adopted in 2004 but it does not protect trees. It applies to
a limited part of the canopy. It applies to large projects that need to undergo large project
reviews. This is for 25,000 square feet or above projects and does not pertain to affordable
housing projects. The current ordinance is retroactive to one year prior to a special permit
application. If an individual were to cut down trees two years ago and then apply for a special
permit on the property these trees would not be covered under the ordinance. Only trees cut
down within one year of applying for a special permit are covered. This applies to trees over
eight inches in diameter at chest height. He stated that the ordinance has a replacement plan
which allows for a payment, based on a variety of conditions, to be made into the Tree Fund
instead of replanting trees or not cutting them down in the first place. He stated that the
ordinance does not cover any trees cut down outside of large project review projects, any tree cut
down more than one year prior to a special permit application and affordable housing projects.
He outlined the proposed amendment. He explained that the amendment would preserve the
affordable housing exemption. The ordinance also exempts dangerous and emergency situations.
He stated that the amendment does require a permit for significant trees more than eight inches
that are removed and are not part of a large project review, in which case they would already be
covered, or if removed more than one year ago. He stated that the permit would be issued by
Public Works and would be discretionary and would document why the tree was cut down and
the specifics pertaining to the tree being cut down. He commented that no one cuts down their
own large trees. A contractor is hired. He stated that the City would inform the contractors that
a permit is required and that would help compliance. Contractors can obtain permits on behalf of
the property owner. He explained why this proposed amendment is needed now. He stated that
18% of the tree canopy has been lost in the last 9 years based on preliminary data. He stated that
the current data shows that the loss is worse, and the task force analysis is showing that there will
be more loss in the future. He stated that the two solutions to the problem are to stop cutting
down trees and to plant more trees. He acknowledged the work of Urban Forest Tree Task Force
and noted that the Task Force will be making recommendations in the future.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked why this did not include Wheeler Street. Councillor Zondervan
responded because it has inclusionary housing units. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that to her
affordable housing does not include inclusionary housing. This does not apply to Wheeler Street
and does apply to Millers River.
Councillor Kelley stated that the copy of the ordinance he is looking at does not have a
retroactive date of one year. Councillor Zondervan stated that this is in the current ordinance.
Councillor Kelley stated that it would be a retroactive hearing for trees that have already been cut
down. He stated that there would be a violation of cutting down trees within one year of the
special permit application.
Commissioner O’Riordan stated that the existing ordinance applies to large projects and there is
nothing at this time regarding tree removal private property in the City that is not associated with
Packet Pg. 104

2.5

a large project. This does place a burden on the staff with this new amendment and he asked
how this ordinance will be enforced and if a tree is removed without a permit how is this handled
by the City. When legislation has been enacted such as plastic bags or polystyrene there has
been significant outreach and education programs prior to promulgating the ordinance. He stated
that it is custom that the City provides notice and educational documents before implementing a
change in regulations. He stated that his concern is that this is going to take time for the City to
do this. He stated that the Urban Forestry Masterplan has been ongoing for the last eight months
and it will be a while before the report will be ready for consideration by the City Council. He
stated that the integrity of this work needs to be maintained and shared thoughts about changes to
existing ordinances while this work is on-going so that the City Council can be provided with a
thorough analysis of what other communities are doing, how best the City can provide different
ordinances and/or regulations so as to better protect the tree canopy. He wanted to make the City
Council cognizant of the Task Force’s work as the Council considers changes to the existing
ordinance.
Councillor Mallon asked has there been any preliminary discussion with the Urban Forestry Task
Force on this issue. She stated that the draft recommendations will be done in May. She stated
that the goal of this ordinance is to collect data and to have conversations around alternatives.
Commissioner O’Riordan stated that the first few months of the task force was providing
background on the existing urban tree canopy, the loss and where the loss is most pronounced.
He stated that the loss is most pronounced in residential areas in the City. He stated that the
reason for the loss is uncertain at this time. He stated that that are reviewing closer the loss in
residential areas and are looking at the degree to which pervious areas have been lost. He stated
that this may be related to redevelopment or extended development on residential properties. He
stated that the City is also looking at house sales and whether properties have been redeveloped
where trees have been removed as a result of development. He stated that in terms of changing
ordinance and regulations and a meeting held in December looked at changing the definition of
significant tree. He stated that presently a significant tree is an eight-inch tree. He stated that
they are looking at a six-inch tree being a significant tree, and this is consistent with what other
communities are doing. He stated that they are looking at regulating tree loss across the entire
City, looking at changing the way that mitigation costs are proposed and looking a mitigation
when significant trees are cut down and diameter of trees at breast height and the area of a tree
trunk at breast height. He stated that tree species are being reviewed. He stated that there is
details that are been reviewed as to how to protect trees in the community. He stated that it is
important to let this conversation continue. He spoke about the more significant protections for
trees the more onerous it become for homeowners to take down trees. He added people may be
less likely to plant trees in the future as well. He stated that there is a balance needed in
incentivizing planting trees on private property. He spoke about protecting people’s ownership
of property and rights of homeowners to protect their property. He noted that there are five more
meetings scheduled.
Councillor Mallon stated that in May when the draft recommendations from Urban Forestry Task
Force come out will there be something that the City Council can work with from that that
addresses the issues outlined by the Commissioner of Public Works or does the City Council
have to wait for the final recommendations in December. She asked if this ordinance does not
get passed is there a way to have the data collected between now and May. Commissioner
O’Riordan stated that all the presentations, minutes and correspondence from the public are on
line on the Public Works page. He stated that the expectation is that the draft report will also be
on line. The draft report may contain specific recommendations or may be more general. He
stated that the report will be detailed. He is unsure about the successfulness of the data
Packet Pg. 105

2.5

collection. He stated that the University of Vermont is working with the City on this and they
did the 2009 and 2014 studies and they have been asked to look at the current 2018 study for
consistency of the analysis.
Councillor Carlone stated that the proposed ordinance changes are benign. There is nothing in
this proposal that is threatening. He suggested sending out postcards and noted that word of
mouth travels fast. Awaiting the recommendations in May and what might be possibly ordained
in September at the earliest, this proposal is not a terrible thing to have on the books and may not
be enforced immediately, isn’t this a good start to let people know that there is a concern.
Commissioner O’Riordan stated that it is benign from the perspective of the homeowner. He
expressed his concern about enforcement and it is an onerous undertaking from the City’s
perspective. The amendment speaks to emergency circumstances and this is not defined in this
proposal and asked what is considered an emergency. He spoke about the one-year period of
time is defined for significant trees, larger than eight inches. He stated that he does not think the
proposed amendment is applicable for a special permit unless there is a change in the definition
of a significant tree. Councillor Carlone spoke about making the language stronger and clearer.
Commissioner O’Riordan stated that if one is to remove any reference to a period of time does
this mean that a property that lost a tree ten years ago would have to have this mitigated to
develop their property now.
Councillor Siddiqui spoke about urgency and competing with a process and how is this balanced.
There are policy strategies could be considered now or do we or can we wait. She stated that she
is struggling with this with that data before the City, the tree canopy loss and climate change.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that we have already waited; this conversation began early last
term. She stated that the City Council was prodded to start this Urban Forestry Task Force, and
this took six months to get this going. She stated that there is no penalty in this ordinance. She
spoke about the concern with enforcement and used the example of Airbnb which the City is
having trouble enforcing. She stated that this interferes with the work of the Urban Forestry
Task Force and that the City Council acknowledges the urgency of their works and want to
support them. She added that all this is doing is gathering data and it is not imposing any fines
and does no more than allow the arborist to have a conversation to suggest an alternative to the
property owner. The longer before these conversations occur, the more trees will be cut down.
She wanted this proposal approved.
Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the enforcement provisions existing in the ordinance
would apply to this amended provision. He stated that the existing enforcement provisions
mention a stop work order if tree are removed in violation of the chapter and there could be
penalties imposed.
Councillor Zondervan agreed emergency circumstance are not defined and this is on purpose to
give this discretion to the arborist to determine if an emergency exists. He would be fine
adopting this as is and that this does not apply to any trees more than one year. He stated that he
does not believe that this is retroactive from ordination and would not apply to trees cut down ten
years ago.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked why this is worded makes trees not subject to the current ordinance
and if included as proposed a permit request why the other enforcement mechanism apply.
Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that he is not sure that the tree replacement fund
provisions would apply to the mitigation plan. He stated that the enforcement section, 8.66.090,
Packet Pg. 106

2.5

applies to enforcement remedies, including a stop work order, fines of $300 per violation, the
possibility of injunctive relief and alternative penalties for non-criminal penalty. Councillor
Zondervan stated that subsection D does specifically reference the large project and it does not
apply. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg agreed. Vice Mayor Devereux spoke about Councillor
Zondervan’s intent when drafting the proposed amendment. She stated that the City Council can
state that enforcement does not apply to this other type of tree. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg
stated that the ordinance could be written this way but if there is no enforcement provision there
is no incentive to comply with the ordinance. If there is no compliance, there is no penalty for
compliance. This is an ordinance without any teeth. The way the amendment is written and if
this section is being added in it is being put in the context of the ordinance and it does have the
enforcement provision. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that a different approach to enforcement
could be suggested. She stated that a mechanism could be developed that would make the
contractor responsible, such as leaf blower ordinance.
Councillor Kelley stated that if the concern is about retroactivity he suggested language at the
end: This section is only applicable to trees standing as of enactment of this section. He stated
that if someone is cutting down trees not related to a project this is not included in the ordinance.
He asked if this is the intent. Councillor Zondervan stated that this states procedures for other
projects and the language could be changed to all projects or significant trees. He stated that the
intent is that this new section would apply everywhere where the current section does not.
At 6:16 PM Councillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.
Lucas James Gyrator, 225 Brookline Street, spoke about the proposal by Councillor Zondervan
for tree protection. He requested the inclusion and consideration of the following knowledge and
guidelines. He requested that all trees in the City of Cambridge are completely protected by the
City’s systematic processes of protection. He requested that the protection apply to all trees on
public, private, commercial, state and City properties and preservations. He requested that the
implementation of this protection be effective to all trees of any kind. He requested that trees be
protected especially on private land. He stated that trees of this City are beings of this earth and
are to be respected for their life and being. They provide oxygen and are the reason we are
currently breathing. Trees filter the air and contribute to the eco-system of all planetary life. He
noted that trees are not owned by the City or its people even though they may grow on illegally
owned land or the land of private owners or in public space. He stated that the concept of the
ownership of a tree is out of the hands of any one person and thus trees do not fall under the
ownership of people at all. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT C).
Christine Kuta, 7 Fairview Avenue, stated that the permitting process is a burden on the private
land owner. She stated that she has a tiny house on a small lot of land and it is difficult to
maintain. She stated that going through what seems a benign process of a permit is another thing
she has to deal with to get anything done on her land and it is also a burden on the arborist. She
noted that when the street trees around her house needed to be trimmed it took a year to get this
done. She stated that currently there is a public dead tree across the street and has not been taken
down since last year. The Public Works Department is overburdened. She was not in favor of
the permitting to add more work no matter how benign this is. She stated that she does care
about the tree canopy of the City but disagrees with this new policy that is based on maintaining
the status quo. Climate change is here, and the trees planted years ago were planted in a different
climate and therefore they are dying. These trees need to be replaced with trees that are more
resilient to the climate situation of today and the City should not waste resources trying to
maintain trees that are not going to survive.
Packet Pg. 107

Susan Ringler, 82 Kinnaird Street, stated that the proposed ordinance is not nearly sufficient.
She requested the entire City take a brief pause in cutting all trees on public and private land
until the Urban Forestry Task Force can submit their recommendations and until the Tree
Ordinance can be amended to actually give protection to mature trees. She spoke about a
photograph on a news clipping shows residential land and those who cut the trees were not
residents of the City; they were developers who purchased residential land and developed and
sold it. She noted that this is the major problem with tree loss on residential land. She submitted
a document showing the amount of carbon that a large tree takes out of the air is exponentially
essential. She stated that the large trees are extremely valuable, and they need to be protected.
She submitted two documents (ATTACHMENT D-1 AND D-2).
Carol O’Hare, 172, Magazine Street, supported getting a tally on tree removals but more
importantly vigor and rigor are needed to effectively curtail tree removals. The ordinance needs
to be corrected that would require simple tree removals, tree removals that are not associated
with any project, to be covered by this ordinance, which it currently does not do. She gave the
examples of someone who does not like shade or to rake leaves. This individual could remove
the tree without doing anything. She stated that there should be a moratorium with specific
exceptions and a waiver process. She stated that there are other cities that have done this. She
stated that Public Works needs more personnel to monitor and enforcement this proposal. She
submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E).
Richard Krushnic, 20 Oak Street, stated that he supported the proposal submitted by Councillor
Zondervan and some kind of a moratorium. He stated that with the rapid development that the
City is facing it is a given that there would be tree removal without some type of a moratorium.
He stated that the tree loss rate is accelerating. He stated that the Public Works Department
needs more resources. There are 500 empty tree wells that need trees in them. This will provide
information for the task force. He stated that over half of the trees removed are on private
residential land. He stated that the City needs some type of tree regulation on private residential
land. He noted that the accelerated tree loss is due to accelerated development. He stated that
the City needs a tree replacement regulation in place as soon as possible to stop this.
Alison Field-Juma 363 Concord Avenue, stated that she supported the amendment. She stated
that it should require public notice and permitting for the removal of all trees on private property
for whatever the reason is. She added that there should be a justification for the removal and full
mitigation of the negative impacts of any removal where it is shown that it is not essential. She
commented that the City has a long history of restricting what property owners can do on their
own property. She highlighted the benefits of trees. She gave an example of the private
property issue. She used the dormer; she was unable to add a dormer to her roof to add a second
bathroom. She noted that this application was denied. She stated that a large cooper beech tree
was removed and cut down when the property changed ownership. She noted that this tree was a
major asset to the neighborhood. She stated that she does not understand why this change was
allowed when a small ascetic change is not. She acknowledged that there are good reasons to
remove trees; she removed trees on her property but planted more replacement than removed.
She stated that she wanted some aspects of this proposal strengthened. She submitted her
comments (ATTACHMENT F).
Nancy Donohue, Director of Government Affairs, Chamber of Commerce, stated that members
of the Chamber have expressed concern about certain aspects of the proposal and she spoke

Packet Pg. 108

2.5

about unintended consequences. She requested that the Chamber be included in the discussions.
She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G).
Steven Nutter, Executive Director, Green Cambridge, stated that Cambridge is in a tree
emergency and need the leadership of the City Council to plan a better future. He stated that this
urgency means that this cannot wait. He stated that with the good work of the task force, this
amendment sends an immediate communication to all that Cambridge is serious about solving
this problem. He stated that the tree canopy will continue to decrease and will decease to 10%
by 2030. He noted that there are many actions that can be taken, but it is simple plant more trees
and stop cutting down the existing trees. The City Council leadership is needed to make this
change and without your leadership this change cannot occur. He noted that the proposed
amendment is a great first step to fix an outdated regulation, but this is only a first step. He
stated that Green Cambridge will help promote this change and educate residents. He
commented that trees make Cambridge livable and is a social justice and equity issue.
Helen Kobek, 69R Gore Street, spoke about 100-year-old pin oak was destroyed. She wanted
the strongest amendment to the ordinance. She wanted trees protected on private property and
wanted a moratorium with adjustments as needed.
Sylvia Parsons, 22 Hancock Street, stated that she supported the amendment and is in favor of
strengthening it and for some type of a moratorium on the cutting of trees in Cambridge with
necessary exceptions. She noted that the timeline for climate change is unforgiving. She stated
that the concept of replacing trees while planting new trees is a good thing, but a fully-grown tree
cannot be replaced. She spoke about the benefits of trees in terms of carbon sequestration,
mitigating heat wave and flood. She spoke about the life supporting element of trees with moss
growth and supporting insects. She spoke about the complexities of the systems that are being
destroyed.
Marilyn Wellons, 651 Green Street, stated that feelings run high on this topic both pro and con.
There are some that feel that trees are a danger, but others see the benefit of trees. She stated that
this is a matter of life for both humans and mammals and also for plants. She wanted a
moratorium. She stated that anything that the City Council does is necessarily part of the
process. She commented that the need for action is now. She stated that she is concerned with
the countervailing values at stake are embodied in the City’s development strategies. She stated
that the tree loss in residential neighborhoods is infill development in the name of additional
units. She stated that the development in Kendall Square has removed trees. She went to many
tree removal hearings. She wanted enforceable action and protection of trees including invasive
and non-native. All trees sequester carbon and provide benefits regardless of their pedigree.
Jules Kobek, 69R Gore Street, supported the amendment. She stated that it is more important to
protect large healthy tree rather than replace it with small saplings. She noted that a new sapling
may die, and it takes decades for a sapling to grow to a large tree. She stated that there needs to
be protections for trees sooner rather than later and penalties with teeth.
Kelly Dolan, 233 Upland Road, stated that she supported the amendment to the tree ordinance.
She urged that a moratorium be proposed on cutting down any more trees in Cambridge. She
spoke about the importance of trees in mitigating climate change by cleaning the air, shading the
City and managing flood waters. The tree canopy needs to be treated as a valued asset. She
noted that limiting property rights for private property is a difficult discussion, but the collective
well-being of the residents and the tree canopy needs to supersede the personal rights of
Packet Pg. 109

2.5

individuals. She stated that having clean air and water is a social justice issue. She submitted
written comments (ATTACHMENT H).
Franciscan Amedeo, 239 Mt. Auburn Street, trustee of Riverbend Park, stated that she wanted
the City Council to include trees on public land. She stated that the Sycamore trees are in crisis
along Riverbend Park. She supported the amendment as a first step. All possible things need to
be done to mitigate climate change and trees have an important role. She encouraged the City
Council to be more aggressive in addressing climate change. She wanted to see more funding
for planting trees on public land.
Pat Goudvis, 179 Harvey Street, encouraged the City Council to approve the amendment. This is
an emergency and we need something stronger than the amendment. She noted that all benefit
from trees.
John Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, member of the Friends of Inman Square, who are still working to
preserve the trees in the plaza in Inman Square. He stated that he favored the proposed
amendment. He noted that this would enable the City to acquire valuable information on tree
removals from private property on an ongoing basis. This would also provide an opportunity to
educate property owners in a critical moment on the life of a tree. The City needs to
communicate in order to have an impact on property owners’ decisions to cut trees. He stated
that our survival depends on trees; individuals cannot live without trees. He stated that trees are
living beings that take a few hours to kill and a lifetime to regrow. There is no such thing as just
one tree, whether public or private. These concepts are necessary for any voluntary measure to
stop the loss of the tree canopy. He spoke about creating a culture of awareness and stewardship.
He stated that a moratorium on the removal of trees from private land would be a beneficial
measure when the task force makes their recommendations.
Charles Franklin, 162 Hampshire Street, stated that he supported the proposal. He highlighted
the importance of trees and the quality of life. He noted that the City does plant trees but has a
hard time keeping them alive.
Maggie Booz, 27 Lawn Street, spoke about this amendment bringing the tree emergency to the
public floor. She does not support the amendment as it is inadequate, ineffective and it is
premature to make ordinance changes before the work of the Tree Task Force and the consultant
have come to conclusions about how to solve the crisis. What is not premature and is called for
is a complete moratorium on tree cutting in the City until the task force has completed its work.
She spoke about issues introduced by Hildebrand to the monthly meetings of the tree task force.
She stated that by 2030 with the current planting, 600 trees a year, there will only be 1/2 the tree
canopy of what the City has now. She stated that by 2070 there will be 9% of what the City has
now. She stated that this is a big problem.
Elaine Saporta, 102 Ellery Street, stated that she is a landscape architect and a member of tree
task force. She noted that the tree task force is only halfway through the process and the news is
not good. She stated that it is known what is killing the trees. She named development, oversalting, disease and the changing climate pressure and four years of successive drought as some
of the reasons. She stated that this is a state of emergency. She supported a six-month
moratorium on the cutting of all trees in the City.
Florrie Wescoat, 33 Market Street, stated that she is the Co-chair of the Committee on Public
Planting, a member of the tree task force and a member of the Friends of Inman Square. She
Packet Pg. 110

2.5

stated that currently there is no incentive for developers or property owners to preserve trees.
Trees are being removed for development and housing infill. She noted that there is less
permeable space for planting in the City. She stated that individuals want trees to shade them; to
enhance the quality of life and to enjoy. She commented that this is an issue of equity and social
justice. She stated that the notion of a pro-tree stance is anti-development or anti-housing is
false. She stated that the City needs development that respects the trees and to plant more. The
City needs to be leader to protect and preserve public trees. She appreciated the City’s
commitment to an Urban Forest Master Plan but because of the rapid diminishment of the
canopy in Cambridge she urged a moratorium on tree cutting while the Urban Forest Master Plan
is being developed.
Paula Sharaga, 234 Columbia Street, stated that she has seen many trees planted which have
died. She noted that Columbia Street is an area where there is a need for trees to be planted. She
supported the amendment but wanted the proposal to have more teeth, enforceable and a
moratorium until this can be figured out.
Peter Valentine, 37 Brookline Street, stated that he magically intends to grow all the trees. He
added that the money worshippers are killing the trees. They will be completely eliminated from
the earth.
Dick Clary, 15 Brookford Street, Chair, North Cambridge Stabilization Committee, and a board
member of the Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods, stated that he favored a moratorium
and the case for a moratorium has been overwhelmingly made. He spoke about how this issue
developed for him. He stated that 130 years ago Charles Eliot stirred the people up over the
destruction of the Waverly Oaks along the Belmont and Waltham line. He explained that the
citizen involvement that this created ended up with the creation of the MDC. He noted that this
is an example of what can happen when there is a sufficient outrage being perpetrated. He stated
that the present-day Charles Eliot has put together a document, a newspaper, that contains an
enormous amount of information.

Jo Solet, 15 Berkeley Street, spoke about enforcement and was disturbed that in some way the
leaf blower ordinance was considered a model here. She stated that violating the ordinance is the
cost of doing business for landscapers. She spoke about all the violations to the leaf blower
ordinance by contractors hired by the City. She stated that homeowner need to be included in the
enforcement.
Charles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, distributed a list of 27 moratoriums passed by the City
Council (ATTACHMENT I). He stated one moratorium that is not on the list is the bio lab
moratorium and it has shaped Cambridge. He stated that this is not a big a deal and will not take
as long. He stated that the task force has already presented. The consultants, the Conservation
Law Foundation, have presented their nationwide review of tree laws on October 3, 2018 and in
December guidelines were presented to change the laws. He stated that in 2002 the Supreme
Court approved a moratorium for a short period of time, for less than a year. He urged the City
Council to choose a moratorium.
Ronda Massie, 211 Charles Street, spoke about balancing open space with development. She
stated that the City’s record on open space and trees is dismal. She acknowledged that it may be
difficult to encourage homeowners and developers to retain trees, it is disheartening to witness
the number of trees that have disappeared in the last several years. She spoke about the tree loss
Packet Pg. 111

2.5

in the parking lot at the Charter School on Bent Street because of the difficulty of plowing
around trees. She spoke about infill development and the $3 million condos built that made it
imperative that the trees were cut down for these condos. She spoke about trees planted on both
sides of Third Street from Kendall Square to Cambridge Street. She stated that the City planted
trees and did not water and none of these trees survived. She spoke about the loss of open space
and trees at the Volpe Center.
Kate Frank, 53 Crescent Street, stated that all neighborhoods will be affected by the tree
problem. She stated that people are speaking about this because it is our civic responsibility.
She spoke about the Japanese who planted fruit trees so that future generations will have fruit
and wanted Cambridge to have a similar attitude about our trees. She asked the issue of private
property be rethought. She spoke about the need for education and it could be as successful as
the composting program. She stated that it may not move fast enough, but some movement is
better than none.
Ellen Mass, President of the Friends of the Alewife Reservation, spoke about a moratorium and
the awareness about trees were not in front of the public previously. She stated that this would
have been a wonderful hearing to have had before the Silver Maple Forest was taken down. She
stated that most of the discussion has been about the past, but she wants to discuss what is
coming up. There is a situation in North Cambridge where there is a one-acre arboretum of
sixty trees that were carefully planted forty years ago which is a crime waiting to happen because
the two developers have misrepresented their building special permit to the Planning Board in
December 2017 by leaving off the major canopy of these rare arboretum planted trees. There is a
new design map, but it does not go along with what is in the tree ordinance. She stated that the
tree ordinance states that a full display of the entire design must be given twenty-one days before
the hearing by the Planning Board. This was not done. She stated that there was a major
misrepresentation of the design which had a court yard with these arboretums. She noted that the
Public Works Department is going to investigate this situation. She explained that the trees
need to be removed to construct a garage underneath.
Erick Grunbaum, 98 Montgomery street, stated that he supports a moratorium; the tree canopy is
in serious decline. He planted trees in The Port in the l990s where at the time it cost $125 to get
a street tree. He stated that he sought and received a grant to subsidize this for those who could
not afford to plant trees. There are massive opportunities to plant more trees. He spoke about
counting the opportunities in the empty spaces in the sidewalks, not the empty tree wells, the
spaces where trees can be planted. He stated that 2,500-3000 locations had been found in each
of two quadrants of the City. This could yield 10,000-15,000 street trees which are the most
important trees. This is what provides shade and greenery. He stated that the City needs to do a
better job in investing in the canopy. He added that a short-term moratorium in reasonable. He
supported more investment in the canopy, both in staffing and financing.
Councillor Kelley closed public comment at 7:17 PM.
Councillor Zondervan proposed and amendment and stated that Councillor Kelley wanted to
capture the retroactive nature of the tree protection. His amendment was to change the title of
section 8.66.055 to strike out the word “Procedure for Other Projects” and insert in place thereof
the words “Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals.” He further moved to amend the
section by striking out the first sentence and inserting in place thereof a new sentence which
reads as follows: For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, except for
emergency circumstances, a permit request will first be submitted to the City Arborist.
Packet Pg. 112

2.5

He stated that a general moratorium on tree cutting cannot be considered because it is not part of
this proposal. He stated that what the committee could consider is to not issue any permits
proposed in this section until the ordinance is further amended based on the recommendations of
the tree task force. He stated that he wanted the committee to consider this concept.
Councillor Kelley noted that the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan was to bring all
significant trees under this section, not just those trees associated with a project.
The second suggestion was to prohibit the granting of any permits until after the tree task force
finishes its work. Councillor Zondervan added that the ordinance could be amended based on
their recommendations.
Councillor Kelley moved for a recess at 7:22 PM.
Councillor Kelley reconvened the hearing at 7:24 PM.
Councillor Kelley noted that there is a lot of public interest in a moratorium. He stated that
another hearing can be scheduled to discuss the amendments by Councillor Zondervan and does
the committee want to delay the granting of any permits which would be a defector moratorium
or want to discuss a moratorium in some other fashion.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he wanted his clarifying amendments acted upon and can
discuss a moratorium when the ordinance is adopted. He stated that he did not favor having
another Ordinance Committee hearing and wanted this proposal to move forward to the full City
Council.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she would vote in favor of the amendments offered by
Councillor Zondervan and forward this to the full City Council.
Councillor Mallon stated that she was under the impression that regarding ordinance committee
hearings that the committee could make something less restrictive and not more restrictive. She
added that a moratorium seems more restrictive. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg responded that
this applies to zoning provisions where there has been advertised zoning language and the City
Council may be trying to make significant changes to this language and there may be restrictions
based on the language. He stated that this is not a zoning ordinance and the issue of restrictions
does not apply. The City Council can consider something that has been advertised. He stated
that the issue of these amendments has been advertised.
Councillor Kelley stated that he is uncomfortable with passing a moratorium now and does not
understand the implications. He added that the moratorium was not part of the call of the
hearing. He stated that when this was advertised to the public it was if you care about trees and
want public notice about cutting down trees come to this hearing. This was not advertised as if
you care about a moratorium come to this hearing. He stated that he feels that this is a huge
difference. He stated that there can be another hearing scheduled to specifically discuss a
moratorium. He stated that this is a dangerous way to go. He would vote on the amendments
but would not vote to move this out of committee.
Councillor Carlone stated that he supports a moratorium but agreed with Councillor Kelley’s
interpretation.

Packet Pg. 113

2.5

Councillor Zondervan stated that the amendment he forwarded to the City Clerk does not
reference a moratorium; it is just the clarifying language. He moved his amendments and stated
that after amending he would move to refer to the full City Council. He stated that when the
issue gets before the City Council a general moratorium could be discussed or not. Councillor
Kelley stated that discussing a moratorium in the Ordinance Committee is a much better place
for this discussion. He stated that he supported amending the language and keeping the matter in
committee for another hearing and forwarding to the full City Council. He added that the subject
of a moratorium should be the subject of a full hearing. Councillor Zondervan stated that a
more general moratorium is a separate discussion and should not encumber the amendments. He
is asking that the amendments be moved forward and then discuss a moratorium as part of a
separate discussion.
The question now came on the amendments to change the title and the language of the first
sentence in 8.66.055 submitted by Councillor Zondervan - and on a voice vote of six
members the amendments Carried.
Councillor Zondervan now moved that the amended proposal to the full City Council for further
discussion.
Councillor Kelley stated that he thinks that this is a bad idea and would like to explore the idea
of what a moratorium might look like.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked how the Ordinance Committee would discuss having a moratorium.
She asked would there need to be language in front of the committee.
Councillor Kelley noted that it always best to have language before the committee.
He stated that Councillor Zondervan had an idea of making the permitting authority of the City
Arborist start only when the City Council had some type of actionable things from the tree task
force and if the committee met to discuss this Councillor Zondervan or anyone else could
provide language for discussion.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he is suggesting that a moratorium is a general conversation
and may be enacted in the way he proposed or may not, but he would prefer this conversation
with the full City Council and this conversation could always be brought back to the Ordinance
Committee. He stated that he did not want to delay moving this forward since there is consensus
around the clarifying language. The moratorium is a separate question on whether there should
be a moratorium on significant tree removals or for all trees removals. He stated that the full
City Council should be part of this conversation. He stated that rather than keeping this in
committee he would prefer that this amendment be forwarded to the full City Council and then
the City Council can decide whether it wants to have a further conversation about a moratorium
or to adopt this amendment as is or enact a moratorium differently than through this proposal.
He stated that these are broader questions than his amendment which did not include language
for a moratorium.
Councillor Carlone stated that the only way that the City Council could discuss a moratorium if
there is a petition submitted. He asked how this would be discussed at the City Council level.
City Clerk Lopez stated that this is an amendment to the Municipal Code and amendments can
be made at any time. She explained that the Ordinance Committee report would go before the
full City Council who could accept the report and place it on file and pass to a second reading the
original proposal as amended by Councillor Zondervan. Two weeks later the proposal would be
Packet Pg. 114

2.5

before the City Council for ordination and at this point the proposal could be amended on the
floor to add language regarding a moratorium. Then it is up to the full City Council if they
wanted to pass the proposal to be ordained as amended.
Councillor Kelley commented that it is simpler and cleaner to figure what is wanted in the
Ordinance Committee than at a City Council meeting.
Councillor Kelley moved that this be referred to the full City Council and on the motion the
roll was called and resulted as follows:

WHEREAS:

A Policy Order “Advancing Homelessness Issues Docket,” stating the City Council’s
support for various bills before the Massachusetts legislature, was unanimously passed
on June 4, 2018; and

WHEREAS:

The previous legislative session ended without final action on the items listed in the
policy order, and have been refiled by their cosponsors for the current legislative
session, to include those listed herein with their new docket numbers; and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to provide identification to homeless youth and families,” HD.1263 and
SD.667 would make accessing a Massachusetts identification card easier for certain
individuals experiencing homelessness by eliminating fees that some may find
prohibitive; and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to further provide a rental arrearage program,” HD.2395 would reestablish a
rental arrearage program for families, individuals, and unaccompanied youth with
incomes up to 130 percent of the federal poverty guidelines (the Council reaffirmed its
support of this legislative item on January 28, 2019); and

WHEREAS:

An “Act creating a Bill of Rights for people experiencing homelessness,” HD.2776 and
SD. 1952 would prevent discrimination based on housing status, and expand rights to
move freely in public spaces, receive equal access to municipal services, and to vote;
and

WHEREAS:

An “Act relative to the safety, dignity, and civil rights of persons experiencing
homelessness,” HD. 3764 and SD. 1950 similarly declares the right of persons
experiencing homelessness to use public spaces, enjoy a reasonable expectation of
privacy, interact with public officials, and to rest, eat, and pray in public spaces; now
therefore be it

WHEREAS:

Our greatest duty as a progressive society is to ensure that children have equal
opportunity to realize their potential, lessening the burdens that circumstance and
fortune may place upon their journeys; and

WHEREAS:

There are still gaps in meeting the basic needs of Massachusetts’ children, chief among
these are housing security and hunger—that most ancient enemy of children; and

WHEREAS:

There are several bills before the Massachusetts legislature that would help to close
some of those gaps; and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to lift the cap on kids,” HD.3043 and SD. 1452, put forward by
Representative Marjorie Decker and Senator Sal DiDomenico, would expand welfare
benefits to children conceived while, or soon after, the family begins receiving
benefits, correcting a practice that leaves some 8,900 of the most vulnerable children in
Massachusetts without public benefits; and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to lift children out of deep poverty,” HD. 2367 and SD. 1328, also put
forward by Representative Decker and Sen. DiDomenico, would increase state benefits
to children and families to 50 percent of the federal poverty level for household size;
and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to protect families experiencing homelessness from having to sleep in unsafe
places,” HD.2406 submitted by Representative Decker, removes the requirement that
families spend a night in an unsafe place, such as a car, park, abandoned building, bus
or train station, or camping ground before they are eligible for emergency housing
assistance form the Department of Housing and Community Development; and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to end child homelessness,” HD. 1356 sponsored by Representative Denise
Provost, prevents families with children under the age of 18 from being evicted from
public housing, publicly subsidized housing, or a shelter funded in whole or in part
with public funds, unless all children can be suitably housed in a different location;
now therefore be it

children out of deep poverty” HD. 2367/SD.1328, an “Act to protect families

In pursuing its stated goal to “increase access to affordable housing for all income
groups,” the City Council is frequently confronted with the reality that state action is
needed to support and enable the City’s efforts to confront the housing crisis; and

WHEREAS:

Several items currently before the legislature advance key housing policy goals
established by the Council and Cambridge residents; and

$100 million to $130 million, and allow tenants to use subsidies in units at the current
fair market rent rather than at 2005 levels; and

WHEREAS:

An “Act to ensure right to counsel in eviction proceedings,” SD.625 would establish a
right to legal counsel in eviction cases, demonstrated to be a major determining factor
in the outcome of such cases; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record in support of an “Act relative to the Massachusetts
Rental Voucher Program” and an “Act to ensure right to counsel in eviction
proceedings;” and be it further

ORDERED:
