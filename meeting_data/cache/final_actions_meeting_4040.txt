CBAC timeline and process
• January 31: Year 3 Renewal guidance sent to Partnerships – due Friday February 18
• February 7: Finalize CBAC approach to subgroup meetings with each Partnership
• Weeks of February 21 & 28 (dates TBD): CBAC subgroup meetings with each Partnership
• March 7: CBAC discussion and determination about Year 3 renewal

Brief review and discussion of Partnerships’ letter to CBAC
• As Chair, Ellen will send response on behalf of CBAC to make sure all Partnership have same information,
including:
o CBAC is committed to a Year 4 of funding, and has already received approval from City Manager to
develop a process and recommendations for a Year 4
o Community Benefits Fund does not currently contain sufficient resources to fund a Year 5, and it is
unclear when additional funding will be received
o In participating in forthcoming CBAC meetings with each Partnerships – one of the questions we may
want to put toward Partnerships is to elicit their perspectives on how CBAC may approach Year 4
o Per their request, offer that Partnerships come to future CBAC meeting – invite all, and design with
Partnerships if they are interested
• Given that CBAC committed to 3 years of implementation, and Year 1 really cannot be considered Year 1 due to
Covid, and if we don’t know about Year 5, does it make sense to do Y3 and Y4 together to provide organizations
with more stability?
CBAC Subgroup Meetings with Each Partnership
Clarifying CBAC Objectives
• Add texture to written responses in more casual, informal way – including opportunity for more anecdotal/
organic sharing and information
• Listen to learn – including climate in which this work is taking place and perspective of client
• Simplify/ alleviate lift on Partnerships
• Gain better understanding of what work is like on the ground – including experiences of families and opportunities
for Year 4 (and beyond)
• Deepen relationships and goodwill
• Clarify shared expectations

Contextualize/ acknowledge/ attend to depth to which Covid has impacted this work, nonprofits, & families;
understand difference between challenges that are due to Covid and those that are longer-term
Acknowledge newness of this approach for CBAC – start of new way of engaging that will continue to take shape

Questions to ask of all Partnerships
1. What do you want CBAC to know about your project? What do you think CBAC should know that is most
important about your project? For example: the context, what families are experiencing, etc.
2. What are you learning that families need?
3. How has it benefited your Partnership and families to have cohort vs. non-cohort model and what might it be like
if it were the other?
4. How are Partnerships orienting toward when Community Benefits Funding runs out?
5. Given the shift that has happened with and for many families – and nonprofits – what has been arising to new and
different levels of importance – and what solutions are you noticing emerging from the community? How could
your approaches be enhanced or changed to respond to an even deeper crisis?
6. What are 2-3 ways that CBAC can support your Partnership’s efficacy and impact?
7. What ideas does your Partnership have about how CBAC might approach Year 4 funding?

Cambridge Health Alliance, Cambridge Housing Authority, Community Action Agency of Somerville (CAAS), Institute for
Health and Recovery (IHR)
• What are the ways they have used different partners to attend to needs of clients?
• As their model is based on a 5-year approach – how are they thinking about that time frame?
• How does Partnership operate given the number of partners; what are the benefits and challenges of a large
Partnership?
• What will it mean to return to in-person vs. what has worked virtually?
Family Stability Project: De Novo, Inc. (Lead Organization), Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, Inc. (CEOC),
Transition House, Inc.

generally?

Port Arise Institute: Community Art Center (Lead Organization), Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House, Tutoring Plus
• How have leadership changes impacted the Partnership and implementation?
• From Y1 to Y2, there was a removal/ delay of key program feature – what is the thinking now about that piece?
• Model depended on in-person work – how have they come together, what is the model, how has it shifted in
being virtual, and how are they moving forward on model?
Strengthening Families Together Project: Cambridge Community Center (Lead Organization), the organization formerly
known as Agassiz Baldwin Community, East End House
• Partnership has expressed challenge of family-level evaluation, and had not been able to do it – explore more with
them about evaluation and their thinking about participating in family-level evaluation
• Work with PEAR as key partner – how has that gone, worked better/ differently than anticipated?
• As a Partnership, they have been most impacted by school closures and changing dynamics –how that has
challenged model and how have they worked though it? How has that worked in terms of interaction as full
Partnership and ability to implement model?

are they with hiring the Case Managers, and what are their projections going forward as positions are filled?

IV.

Public Comment
•

Encourage CBAC to consider what is possible in response to Partnerships’ letter – make decision as expeditiously as
possible, as organizational leaders are waiting to hear a response; having a meeting with all Partnership
organizations together, or at least a representative from all organizations, would help the group have a common
understanding
