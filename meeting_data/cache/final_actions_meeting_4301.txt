Cambridge Preschool Program (CPP)
Overview

The universal preschool system is a mixed-delivery system, with capacity to serve the entire
eligible population spread across Cambridge Public Schools, Department of Human Services
Program preschools, Head Start, and community based programs.

Attachment: UPK_ Joint School Committee City Council Round Table 02.14.23_ (18373 : A

All eligible children would be entitled to a 6 hour per day/school-year placement, with extended
days and summer available depending on family need and program type (extended days would be
at low or no cost to families who meet certain eligibility requirements).

Funding will be provided to community based programs based on the the number of CPP
seats in each classroom.

Funding would be braided with other funding supports including federal Head Start funds,
state contracted slots and voucher funds, and other state preschool focused early childhood
funding, as appropriate.

years
old

All children who are 4 years
old prior to September 1
of each school year are
eligible to enroll in the

of the aforementioned
programs.

Any child who is 3 years old
prior to September 1 of
each school year may also

a household below a defined
income threshold OR has
other defined risk factors,
placement in a Cambridge
Preschool Program site is
prioritized.

Cambridge Preschool
Program does NOT have

Communication strategy

The Office of Early Childhood
added a Marketing &
Communications Specialist
and UPK Project Manager
positions to its team this year.
We will continue to build
capacity to facilitate the
implementation of the
Cambridge Preschool Program
through the addition of several
key staff positions in FY23
and in FY24.

Cambridge Public Schools
will facilitate the procurement
and acquisition of the
technology used to manage
the CPP application and
matching process and will
work closely with OEC to build
out system requirements.

OEC, CPS, and DHSP will be
developing a shared
communication strategy to
begin informing the public
about the launch of the
Cambridge Preschool Program
and to ensure aligned
messaging as offices begin to
field inquiries from the public.

City Progress
Update

●

●

Estimate of about $20M of additional
funding needed as of FY25. Exact numbers
will be impacted by:
○

How many children are assigned to
different program types (for example,
school vs. community programs)

○

The actual number of children that
apply and are placed across the system

○

What other funding sources are
available to support the children who
are enrolled (for example, Head Start,
state preschool funding, etc.)

$10M will be put into a stabilization fund
in FY24 so that the impact on the budget
is spread out
