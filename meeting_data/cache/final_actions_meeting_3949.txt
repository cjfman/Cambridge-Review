20 OR MORE SPEAKERS SIGNED UP, THE AMOUNT OF TIME ALLOCATED IS

Public Comment

Sept 13, 2021

THIS POLICY ORDER IS PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION DATING BACK TO
APRIL OF 2019 WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL CREATED THE FIRST EVER EQUITY
PRIORITY PERIOD FOR HOST COMMUNITY AGREEMENTS IN THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY. THAT EQUITY PRIORITY PERIOD WAS CHALLENGED ON BAD FAITH
GROUNDS AND CALLED RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY. I'M DISGUSTED BY THAT.
THEY LOST THE CHALLENGE IN COURT. THE PRECEDENT WAS SET... NOW
ALLOWS CITIES AND TOWNS TO HAVE EQUITY PRIORITY PERIOD FOR HCAs
THAT DON'T INCLUDE MEDICAL DISPENSARIES AND I IMPLORE YOU TO
EXTEND THE PERIOD. AND ALSO DOING ANOTHER REVOLUTIONARY FIRST
AND TAKING THE DELIVERY HOST COMMUNITY AGREEMENT PRIORITY PERIOD
AND EXTENDING TO A FOURTH YEAR. THE DELIVERY EQUITY PRIORITY PERIOD
ON THE STATE LEVEL FOR TYPES OF DELIVERY LICENSES, DELIVERY OPERATOR
AND CURRIER, IT IS A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS. AND CAN BE EXTENDED BY
THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION. BY YOU INCREASING YOUR STATE
LOCAL LEVEL PERIOD FOR DELIVERY TO FOUR YEARS, YOU SET THE TONE.
MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO THE RULING CANNOT
ACCOMPLISH ITS EQUITY MANDATE IF THERE IS NO LOCAL LEVEL EQUITY
PRIORITY. YOU SET THE STANDARD, PLEASE VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS
ORDINANCE TONIGHT. PLEASE CONTINUE TO BE A NATIONAL LEADER AND
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'LL MOVE FOR HAVING ONE
TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIX. GIVE ME A MOMENT PLEASE.
>> I APPRECIATE THE TIME BEING TAKEN TO THIS MATTER. I AND MY FAMILY
HAVE BEEN LONG TIME MEMBER OF THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY, OVER 50
SOMETHING YEARS. AS WELL AS PROPERTY OWNERS. I BROUGHT THIS ISSUE
UP TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS WHERE I HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO RENTS AN
APARTMENT NEXT DOOR TO ME. AND I HAVE SEEN HIS BUSINESS GROW
THROUGH YOUR CAR SHARE PROGRAM, THE CITY'S CAR SHARE PROGRAM,
THIS GENTLEMAN HAS APPROXIMATELY 15 VEHICLES OF WHICH SEVEN ARE
PARKED IN FRONT OF PROPERTIES THAT MY PARENTS OWN AND THEY ARE
MULTIUNIT PROPERTIES AS WELL AS HE WILL MOVE CARS WITHIN OTHER
STREETS ADJOINING STREETS. IT NOW LIMITS US WHO HAVE MULTIUNITS
OR PROPERTIES IN OUR TENANTS HAVING THE ABILITY TO PARK. THIS
GENTLEMAN IS ABLE TO BUY A $25 RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT AND ABLE
TO CHARGE UP TO $600 A DAY FOR EACH CAR HE RENTS. I WOULD IMPLORE
THAT THE CITY LOOK AT THEIR RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PROCESS PER
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS PUT FORTH AS WELL AS LOOK AT THE CAR SHARE
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS NOW ENABLING THOSE TO BE ENTREPRENEURS
WITHOUT HAVING ANY CONSIDERATION FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE SHALEEN TITLE.
>> GOOD EVENING. YOU CAN HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT
OF POLICY ORDER NUMBER 13. I SUBMITTED COMMENTS LAST WEEK AND
THE BASIC IDEA IS I HOPE THAT THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES, SOCIAL


PAGE 2

Sept 13, 2021

EQUITY AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT BUSINESSES DON'T PAY THE PRICE
FOR COVID AND THE HOLDUP IT HAS CAUSED FOR SO MANY AND THAT I
THINK IT IS GREAT THAT THE CONVERSATION HAS EXPANDED TO ADDRESSING
OTHER THINGS BESIDES LOCAL APPROVAL, LIKE ACCESS TO FUNDING, THE
MORE BENEFITS, THE BETTER. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT ADDING BENEFITS,
NOT TAKING THEM AWAY.
I ALSO WANT TO ADD NATIONAL CONTEXT THAT BECAUSE CAMBRIDGE'S
POLICY IS SO INTUITIVE AND TRANSFORMATIVE, IN THE NATIONAL CONTEXT,
THERE IS A VESTED INTEREST IN DECLARING IT A FAILURE AND ASCRIBING IT
TO SOME INHERENT FLAW IN SOCIAL EQUITY ENTREPRENEURS OR
GOVERNMENTS SO IT COULDN'T BE REPLICATED. AND SO I'D ASK YOU TO
KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU MAKE A DECISION AND FINALLY, I WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU BECAUSE THIS IS EXHAUSTING WORK AND IT IS REALLY NICE THAT
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, THERE'S BEEN A CITY WHERE YOU LISTEN TO THE
EVIDENCE EACH TIME AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY MADE DECISIONS THAT
BENEFIT THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THAT THE POLICIES ARE MEANT TO
BENEFIT. AND THEY CAN'T ALWAYS COME TO PUBLIC MEETINGS, PEOPLE
WHO FEEL THAT WAY TO EXPRESS THEIR THINGS, I SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ERIC GRUNEBAUM.
>> CITY MANAGER AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, I'M A CO FOUNDER OF
FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND AND THE ADVISORY BOARD. I WANT TO SPEAK
ABOUT THE CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA ITEM 8. IT RELATES TO THE AUGUST 2
POLICY ORDER REQUESTING THAT CITY INVEST IN THE PUBLIC
INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG RINDGE AVENUE, INCLUDING SIDEWALK, TREE
CANOPY AND BIKE LANES. THERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE DESIGN PROPOSAL
ALONG RINDGE AVENUE. THERE ARE GOOD THINGS ABOUT IQHQ PROPOSAL
FOR THE ALEWIFE SET AND WE HAVE ENJOYED GETTING TO KNOW THE TEAM
THROUGH MEETINGS. THERE'S NOT A CONSENSUS AROUND THE RINDGE
AVENUE SOLUTION AND WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THE PROPOSALS ARE THE
BEST LONG TERM APPROACH. IQHQ SENT A LETTER DESCRIBING THE PLANS
AND THIS LETTER INCLUDES BUDGET ESTIMATES COMPARING THEIR
APPROACH WITH THE APPROACH CHAMPIONED BY FRIENDS OF JERRY'S
POND. AND SUPPORTED BY OTHER THE, INCLUDING THOSE CONCERNED
WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, HABITAT, WETLANDS, AND HEAT ISLANDS.
THEY ARE GENEROUS IN SHARING THE LETTER AND WE REVIEW THE BUDGET
ESTIMATES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON OFFICIAL INFORMATION.
WE'LL SEND A NOTE WITH GREATER DETAIL SOON. WE BELIEVE THE
COMMUNICATION WILL SHOW THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IQHQ
CURRENT PLAN IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE ESTIMATES SHOWN IN THE
LETTER TO DPW AND WILL BE MORE ACHIEVABLE. TO NOTE ONE ITEM, $5
MILLION WAS INCLUDED FOR UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND THE IDEA IS
WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION, WE HAVE NOT CHAMPIONED THIS IN THE
PROPOSAL. IT WAS LEFT OUT AS A MATTER OF CONVENES BY THE LANDSCAPE
DESIGNER. THE $5 MILLION CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE ESTIMATE RIGHT
OFF THE TOP OF THE ESTIMATE. LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DETAIL IN A


PAGE 3

Sept 13, 2021

LETTER WE'LL SEND TO DPW SOON AND SHARE WITH YOU. AND THANK YOU
FOR YOUR KIND CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HENRY WORTIS.
>> HI, I'M HENRY, BERKSHIRE STREET AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR
REVOLUTION CAMBRIDGE. I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE ADVANCING OF
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PETITION. IT WILL NOT BRING SIGNIFICANT NEW
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO CAMBRIDGE. THE PETITION WOULD DIRECTLY
AFFECT THE VERY FEW SINGLE AND DUAL FAMILY LOTS IN THE CITY. IT
REQUIRES AN AFFORDABLE UNIT IF AND ONLY IF THE DEVELOPER ADDS THREE
OR FOUR NEW UNITS AND BEGIN THE PETITION REQUIREMENTS THAT NEW
CONSTRUCTION CANNOT ALTER THE EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION OF AN
EXISTING BUILDING, FEW DEVELOPERS WILL BE ABLE TO EXPAND. THUS, IT IS
NOT POSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE
ON THE HOUSING WAITING LIST BY THIS PETITION.
INSTEAD, THE PETITION DISTRACTS FROM THE COUNCIL'S EFFORTS TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE MOST DISADVANTAGED AND MOST IN NEED OF
HOUSING. OVER MANY YEARS, THE COUNCIL HAS AGREED TO SUPPORT
PETITIONS FOR HOUSING THAT CLAIM TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
PRIVATE DEVELOPERS HAVE BUILT THOUSANDS OF NEW UNITS. THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS APPROACH AND THE POPULATION OF AFRICAN
AMERICAN HAS GONE DOWN DRASTICALLY.
IT IS TIME FOR THE CITY TO CHANGE ITS DIRECTION, GIVE UP ON EXPECTING
MARKET RATE HOUSING TO BETTER OUR HOUSING. WE NEED SOCIAL
HOUSING THAT IS PUBLIC HOUSING LIMITED EQUITY CO OPS, AND
NONPROFIT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR
ATTENTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE PHIL WELLONS.
>> PHIL HAS NOT JOINED. DIANE MARTIN, GO AHEAD.
>> HI. I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF NORTH CAMBRIDGE AND I APPRECIATE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT JERRY'S POND, ABOUT MY SUPPORT OF
THE CITY MANAGER'S SEPTEMBER 8TH RESPONSE TO POLICY ORDER 2021
167. AS A MEMBER OF THE ALEWIFE STUDY GROUP I HAVE MET WITH LAP
DEVELOPER SINCE FEBRUARY REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE DEVELOPMENT
ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE IQHQ DEVELOPMENT SENDS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE ACCESS,
OPEN THE CAMPUS FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS AND INSTALL A COMMUNITY
GARDEN, SUPPORT JOB TRAINING AND SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR
LOCALS AND SOCIALLY JUSTICE DRIVEN COMMUNITY BENEFITS.
IQHQ IS A WILLING PARTNER IN THE PROCESS. IT HAS INCLUDED VALUABLE
INPUT FROM ALEWIFE STUDY GROUP, FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND, GREEN
CAMBRIDGE, RESERVOIR CHURCH, AND NUMEROUS OTHER GROUPS AND FOR
RESIDENTS ALONG RINDGE AVENUE AND OTHER STREETS THAT ARE NEAR THE
PARCEL. ASG IS PLEASED WITH IQHQ'S FINANCIAL COMMITMENT AND PLANS
FOR THE AREA. BEFORE THE CITY INVESTS MONEY IN REDEVELOPING JERRY'S


PAGE 4

Sept 13, 2021

POND, WE NEED MORE CONVERSATIONS. IF RESIDENTS WERE GIVEN A
CHOICE OF SEVERAL OPTIONS, SUCH AS AN UNDERPASS CONNECTION
JEFFERSON PARK TO DANEHY, FOR INSTANCE, PEOPLE COULD WEIGH WHAT IS
MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM FROM SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES. ALSO, THIS IS A
COMPLICATED SITE AND THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT WOULD IMPACT
REDOING JERRY'S POND THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO EXPLORE. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, LEE FARRIS.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M LEE FARRIS, SPEAK FOR THE CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS ALLIANCE. IT IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT PROPOSAL THAT WILL
BRING DELIBERATION FROM A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE TO THE QUESTION OF
WHAT CAMBRIDGE SHOULD DO TO IMPROVE RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY
OUTCOMES. AND IT WILL ADDRESS THE RECENT POLICY ORDERS ABOUT
REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY AND RESTITUTION FOR THE WAR ON DRUGS AND
OTHER RACIALLY UNJUST POLICIES IN CAMBRIDGE.
SO WE FIRMLY SUPPORT THIS. WE ALSO SUPPORT POLICY ORDER NUMBER 13
TO EXTEND THE CANNABIS EQUITY PERIOD, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY ALSO A
MATTER OF RACIAL EQUITY AND AS MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ON
THAT ALREADY, I WILL NOT GO INTO THAT FURTHER. THANKS TO THE
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE FOR APPROVING THAT ONE YEAR EXTENSION AND I
OPEN THE COUNCIL PASSES THAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SHANNON CANAVIN.
>> HELLO, I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE FORMATION OF A COMMISSION OF
RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. AND I BELIEVE IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE
COUNTRY GRAPPLE WITH THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY AND ANTIBLACK
DISCRIMINATION AND CAMBRIDGE SHOULD TAKE THE LONG OVERDUE STEP
OF EXAMINING ITS ROLE IN BENEFITTING FROM WHITE SUPREMACY AND
HOW TO OFFER RESTITUTION. I ASK IT IS IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY SO
THE CONVERSATIONS CAN BEGIN AS THEY WILL NO DOUBT TAKE MUCH TIME
TO FLUSH OUT AND PUT INTO ACTION. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE FRANCIS DONOVAN.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> I'M FRANCIS DONOVAN, 42 IRVING STREET. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF
APPLICATION, THE ADVANCING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AHA ZONING
PETITION. THE CITIZEN'S PETITION IS THE PRODUCT OF A WORKING GROUP
ON HOUSING FORMED THIS SPRING BY NEARLY 2 DOZEN CONCERNED
RESIDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF BACKGROUNDS
AND SKILLS. WE MET REGULARLY THROUGH THE SLATE SUMMER AND THE
FINAL PETITION LANGUAGE YOU HAVE ALL IT IS THE GOALS WERE REFINED.
I'M JUST ONE MEMBER AND ONE OF 20 SIGNERS, I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO
SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITION BECAUSE MINE IS THE FIRST NAME BEING
CITED. THE PETITION DEALS WITH THREE ISSUES. FIRST, FUNDAMENTAL
CONTRIBUTOR TO CAMBRIDGE'S TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING, AND


PAGE 5

Sept 13, 2021

INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS, THE ADDITION OF THOUSANDS OF CORPORATE
AND INSTITUTIONAL EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS IN RECENT YEARS WITH NO
REQUIREMENT TO PLAN FOR HOUSING THEM. THIS PETITION PROPOSES TO
REQUIRE ALL ORGANIZATIONS OVER 100 PERSONS TO PROVIDE AREA PLANS
WITH ANNUAL REPORTING FOR 85% OF THEIR FULL TIME EMPLOYEES,
STUDENTS, AND AFFILIATES BY THE YEAR 2040.
A KEY GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW AND MIDDLE
INCOME EMPLOYEES TO BUILD EQUITY BY PURCHASING RATHER THAN
RENTING. SECOND FACTOR IS CAMBRIDGE'S HOUSING SHORTAGE IS THE
RESTRICTION THAT ALL RESIDENTS IN THE SINGLE FAMILY OR TWO FAMILY
ZONED HOMES MUST BE FROM THE SAME ONE OR TWO FAMILIES. MANY
HOMES ARE NOW OCCUPIED BY JUST A SINGLE FAMILY MEMBER, FORCING
OWNERS TO LEAVE ROOMS EMPTY THROUGHOUT CAMBRIDGE OR VIOLATE
THE LAW BY RENTING TO UNAUTHORIZED TENANTS TO SUPPORT THE HOME.
THIS PETITION WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL HOUSING BY ALLOWING CREATION
OF ADDITIONAL UNITS WITHIN THE SHELVES OF SINGLE FAMILY AND TWO
FAMILY HOMES
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, WE HAVE
ELIZABETH.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> I WISH TO SPEAK TO TWO ISSUES TONIGHT. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AND
ADVANCE THE AHA ZONING PETITION. THIS IS THE KIND OF ZONING THAT
LOOKS AT PROBLEMS IN A THOUGHTFUL AND WHOLISTIC WAY. LARGE
COMPANIES AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WILL NEED TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS, BUT ALSO ADDRESS
SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. ASSISTING
WITH DOWN PAYMENTS WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO EMPLOYEES AS THEY
GAIN EQUITY IN THE HOUSING. ALLOWING ADDITIONAL UNITS IN LARGER
SINGLE FAMILY STRUCTURES LEGALIZES A LONG STANDING PRACTICE, BUT
AIDS OWNERS AND RENTERS AND FREE UP WHILE IT WILL HELP TO
PRESERVE THE REMARKABLE HERITAGE WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE IN
CAMBRIDGE.
GIVEN OUR CLIMATE CRISIS, REQUIRING PARKING SURFACES IS TO BE
PERMEABLE IS A EASY STEP TO TAKE. I URGE THE SUPPORT FOR POLICY
ORDER 164, REQUIRING TREES TO BE TREATED AS A ESSENTIAL
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ALL KNOW THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL COST TO
RESIDENTS WHEN WE REDUCE HEAT ISLANDS AND LOW AIR QUALITY FOR THE
SAKE OF CONVENIENCE. EVERY CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT DESERVES AN
ENVIRONMENT WHICH TO DRIVE AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE
THAT ENVIRONMENT.
TREES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SURVIVAL AND WE NEED TO ACT NOW. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CHAUNCY SPENCER.

Sept 13, 2021

>> HELLO. I'M AN ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANT IN SUPPORT OF
THE EXTENSION. AND HOWEVER, I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS IN
REGARDS TO BEING OR EXTENDING IT TO SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS IN
GENERAL SPEAKING.
I SUGGEST THAT THE I KNOW IT IS A BIT LATE FOR THIS DISCUSSION,
HOWEVER, I WILL STATE IT ANYWAY. EXTENDING THE SOCIAL EQUITY
APPLICANTS, WHICH ARE A VERY LOOSE TERM IN THE STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS, THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM WE
TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS BLACK AND BROWN. THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
THE CASE IS THAT THEY ARE OFTEN 50%, THEY ARE WHITE AND THE INCOME
REQUIREMENTS ARE QUITE HIGH FOR THE SOCIAL EQUITY PARTICIPANTS. AS
HIGH AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WHEN WE DO KNOW
THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR SOMEONE WHO IS BLACK AND BROWN IN
THE BOSTON AREA IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT.
YOU KNOW, THE PROGRAM, IN MY OPINION, HAS BEEN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
OF SITUATION. THEY CANNOT MAKE RULES SPECIFIC FOR BLACK AND BROWN
PEOPLE; HOWEVER, THEY WANT TO BE SOMEWHAT INCLUSIVE. HOWEVER,
THE PROBLEM IS THERE ARE A LOT OF WELL... A LOT OF WHITE, RICH
BUSINESSES PUTTING THEIR WIVES INTO THE PROGRAM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE EQUITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS. WE'RE GOING BACK TO PHIL AND THEN JUDY
JOHNSON.
>> HELLO. I'M PHIL, I SUPPORT THE ADVANCING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
PETITION. CAMBRIDGE IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROBLEM HAS MANY
CAUSES, SOME WE CAN WE ENDURE AND OTHERS WE CANNOT. ONE
PROBLEM BEYOND IS HOUSING DEMAND AROUND THE WORLD.
WE NEED SOLUTIONS THAT WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE BASIC COMPLEX
PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CITY STRATEGY INCREASES JOBS WITHOUT
CONCERN FOR HOUSING FOR THE NEW EMPLOYEES AND FOR LOW AND
MIDDLE INCOME RESIDENTS AND NEW WORKERS DISPLACED. THAT'S OUR
POLICY HELP CAUSE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROBLEM. WE NEED
SOLUTIONS THAT RECOGNIZE COMPETING CLAIMS ON LIMITED RESOURCES
AND SPEND THE COST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BETTER. THE AHA
PETITION DOES THIS, AHA EXTENDS BEYOND ZONING TO ADDRESS AREA WIDE
TRANSPORTATION, PARKING, INFRASTRUCTURE. THINK WATER AND POWER,
WE NEED THOSE FOR THE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES. AHA WILL GET BIG
EMPLOYERS TO PLAN HOUSING FOR 85% OF WORKERS. AHA TACKLES A HUGE
CAUSE, NEW JOBS NEED MORE HOUSING DEMAND AND PLACES
RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT BELONGS, ON THE COMPANIES. AHA WILL
EXCLUSIVELY OPEN ONE AND TWO FAMILY ZONES FOR MORE UNITS IN
EXISTING STRUCTURES AND SCALE THE INCREASE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS.
PLEASE SUPPORT THE AHA.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL MOVE TO JUDY JOHNSON.
>> JUDY IS NOT ON THE ZOOM.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU NEED TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> SORRY GO THAT. I'M AMINE. AN ADVISOR TO JSO, ECONOMIC
EMPOWERMENT APPLICANT. I WILL EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THE
COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERING POLICY ORDER 13. IN 2019, THE FIRST TWO
MONTHS OF 2020, STAKEHOLDERS CAME IN FRONT OF COUNCIL IN GOOD
FAITH TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT AND
EQUITY APPLICANTS. NOBODY AT THE TIME IMAGINED THEY SHOULD PLAN
FOR GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND ON THE PROGRESS OF THE BUSINESS AND
APPLICATIONS. COVID 19 HAS IMPACTED THOSE EE APPLICANTS IN THE
EXPECTED WAYS IT HAS IMPACTED ORDER BUSINESSES, SETTING THEM BACK
18 MONTHS. RECLAIMING THAT TIME ALIGNS WITH THE SPIRIT AND
SUBSTANCE OF THE ALREADY MORATORIUM AND PROTECTS THE BUSINESSES
FROM MONOPOLISTIC I END MY COMMENTS HERE AND I THANK YOU FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU IN DEFENSE OF IN SUPPORT
OF POLICY ORDER 13. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL MOVE TO MIKE NAKAGAWA.
>> MIKE, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. PLEASE GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> THANK YOU. HAVING LATINO HERITAGE WITH A FAMILY THAT IS TORN
APART BY RACIAL AND CULTURAL INJUSTICE, BEING A PERSON OF COLOR,
GROWING UP IN A VERY PREJUDICE AREA OF THE COUNTRY, I WILL SUPPORT
MY SUPPORT FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY COMMISSION TO ADDRESS
THE VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT RESULTED FROM SYSTEMIC REPRESSION OF
MANY PEOPLE. I WANT TO GIVE MY SUPPORT TO THAT.
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION JERRY'S POND, PUT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FIRST.
THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF THE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS, PARTICULARLY
ADDRESSING THE SAFETY OF KIDS, WITH REGARD TO TRAFFIC, CROSSING
STREETS AND BIKE USERS. PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AS THE HIGHEST
PRIORITY FOR RINDGE AVENUE. AND TREATING TREES AS VITAL
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CITY HAS A GOAL TO HAVE ABOUT THE SAME SHAPE
OF TREES WE HAD TEN YEARS AGO. IF THINGS CONTINUE, WE'LL HAVE HALF
OF THAT TEN YEARS FROM NOW. REPLACING THE TREES MEANS AN ENTIRE
GENERATION WILL BE DEPRIVED OF THE BENEFIT OF TREE AS WE WAIT FOR
THEM TO GROW. WE NEED TO SAVE THE TREES WE CAN AS WE WAIT FOR
THE NEW ONES TO FILL IN. THE CURRENT WAY WE'RE DOING THINGS, FOR
EXAMPLE, EXCEPTIONAL TREE OF THE TOBIN SCHOOL, ONLY GIVES 1/10 OF
THE SHADING THE OLD TREE HAD. YOU NEED 100 TREES INSTEAD OF 10 AS
REPLACEMENT. THAT'S JUST FOR ONE SINGLE TREE. THE STUDENTS SUFFER
FROM THAT. PLEASE LOOK INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE ASPECT. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO FLAVIA HUNGARO.
>> HELLO. GOOD EVENING. I'M HERE TO THANK YOU FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE, HOW POLICY ORDER NUMBER 13, EXTENDING THE


PAGE 8

Sept 13, 2021

POLICY PERIOD AND THE DELIVERY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO FOLLOW
THROUGH. IT WILL GIVE COMPANIES TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD IN CAMBRIDGE
AND EARN A PLACE IN THE EMERGING INDUSTRY AS WELL AS IN THE
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO
OPEN A CANNABIS BUSINESS, THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN HAVING EQUITY
COMPANIES OPEN UP SHOPS ALONGSIDE PREVIOUSLY MEDICAL COMPANIES
THAT CONTROL THE SUPPLY CHAIN WOULDN'T GO WELL. I APPRECIATE THE
CITY'S CONTINUED EFFORTS TO TAKE ON THIS CHALLENGE, UNLIKE MOST OF
ALL OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN NO STAND FOR
EQUITY. I PERCEIVE THE EFFORTS CONTINUE TO SPEAK UP AND GIVE PUBLIC
INPUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS CAUSE. THANK YOU AND I HOPE IT PASSES
TODAY. HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PETER VALENTINE. PRESS THE BUTTON.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. I CONSIDER CAMBRIDGE A SACRED CITY. I HAVE A SOLUTION
TO THE VIRUS PROBLEM. I PROTECT THE COUNTRY... HOW DO I DO THAT?
BY UNDERSTANDING META PHYSICAL ENERGIES. BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
PHYSICALLY, YOU HAVE TO THINK OF DOING IT THOUGHT OR FEELINGS
THEY COME BEFORE PHYSICAL ENERGY.
TO STOP THE PHYSICAL ENERGY, PHYSICAL THINGS FROM HAPPENING, BY
FEELING THEY ARE GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY PHYSICALLY HAPPEN. SO
THE WAY YOU STOP THE VIRUS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU HAVE TO SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE. THIS IS
RELATED TO THE CITY MANAGER ITEM NUMBER ONE ON COVID?
>> I HAVE COME HERE TO GIVE YOU THE SOLUTION TO THE VIRUS. AND I'M
NOT GOING TO SPEAK FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I'M ALMOST FINISHED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CONTINUED.
>> OKAY. THE WAY YOU SENSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE VIRUS,
YOU FEEL YOURSELF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FEEL GOOD. YOU FEEL
YOURSELF. AND YOU REACH A SENSE OF CONCLUSION. WHEN YOU DO, YOU
STOP. IF YOU FEEL YOURSELF AND YOU FEEL TROUBLE, YOU BREAK IT UNTIL IT
FEELS OKAY. AND YOU STOP THE VIRUS. YOU WILL STOP THE VIRUS. THAT'S
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. IF ANYONE WANTS TO ASK ME QUESTIONS AFTER,
PLEASE DO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LEWIS WEITZMAN.
>> HELLO. HI. I LIVE ON MONTGOMERY STREET. I SPEAK ON JERRY'S POND.
I'M A FOUNDING MEMBER AND I DEVOTED MUCH OF MY FREE TIME FOR THE
PAST FIVE YEARS TO REOPENING JERRY'S POND TO PUBLIC ACCESS. WE ARE
VERY CLOSE TO HAVING THAT HAPPEN. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING IN A
FIRST CLASS MANNER. I'M PART OF A GROUP OF INTERESTED NEIGHBORS,
PART OF FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND, ALEWIFE STUDY GROUP, WE HAVE
WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE OWNERSHIP, I WILL REITERATE THE WORDS OF


PAGE 9

Sept 13, 2021

ASG, THE NEW OWNERSHIP JUMPED INTO THE PROCESS IN GOOD FAITH AND
I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PLEASED WHEN THE PLANS ARE
RELEASED. ONE OF THE FEW AREAS THAT IS NOT FINALIZED IN THE
COMMUNITY MEETINGS IS THE RINDGE AVENUE WATERFRONT. ONE OF THE
MANY REASONS IS THAT THE BEST NEW VISION FOR THIS AREA REQUIRE
EXTRA PLANNING AND POSSIBLY EXTRA MONEY. THIS IS EXACTLY AS IT
SHOULD BE. NOTHING GREAT IS EASY.
WE NEED TO TEST THE RINDGE AVENUE WATERFRONT SITES AND THEN WE
NEED TO BUILD A COMMUNITY CENSUS ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE THERE.
THAT WILL TAKE TIME. THE DEVELOPER AND THE COMMUNITY HAVE
CARRIED THE BALL FOR THE PAST YEAR AND HALF. NOW IS THE MOMENT
FOR CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND HIT A HOME RUN.
WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT, WE'LL BE SETTLING FOR JUST IMPROVEMENTS
ALONG RINDGE AVENUE AND WE DON'T WANT JUST IMPROVES. WE WANT A
WORLD CLASS SOLUTION. FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND HAVE PRESENTED, AND
WE HAVE PRESENTED TO YOU A PLAN. IT IS FEASIBLE AND WE CAN BELIEVE IT
CAN BE DONE AT A PRICE THE CITY CAN AFFORD. THIS IS A ONCE IN A
LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY, WE HAVE THOUGHT A LONG WAY AND LOOK
TOWARD THE LEADERS TO HELP US GET OVER THE FINAL HURDLES. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, EVANGELOS BALAFAS. JUST UNMUTE.
>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> I'M OWNER TWO FAMILY HOUSE IN CAMBRIDGE. 572 PUTNAM AVENUE.
THE PLACE HAS TWO TENANTS AND I HAVE ONE PARK SPACE. ONE OF THE
MY TENANTS HAS THREE KIDS. 1, 4, AND 5. PARK SPACE AROUND THE
HOUSE, I GO TO THE NEIGHBOR AND THEY GIVE ME PERMISSION. SOMEONE
MAKE BUSINESS TO PARK A LOT OF CARS IN THE PUTNAM AVENUE. AND I
DON'T KNOW NOTHING ELSE TO SAY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES GO AHEAD.
>> JACKSON PLACE, IN IS RIGHT ON RINDGE AVENUE. I LIVED HERE FOR 14
YEARS. I JUMP STARTED THE FORMATION OF TENANT COUNCIL AT
JEFFERSON PARK, WHERE I WAS PRESIDENT FOR A PERIOD. I HAVE ATTENDED
EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC MEETING ABOUT THE IQHQ PLANS. EVERY SINGLE
COMMUNITY MEETING THAT IS. THERE ARE ONGOING MEETINGS, PRIVATE
MEETINGS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS THAT HAVE NOT
BEEN INVITED TO ATTEND.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE ON THIS SIDE OF RINDGE AVENUE HAVE
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLANS. NOT WITHSTANDING
THAT. I WAS SHOCKED, AS CLOSELY AS A FOLLOWED IT AND PARTICIPATED, I
WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THIS AGENDA ITEM FOR TODAY. AT NO TIME, AT ALL
THE MEETINGS I ATTENDED AND ALL DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH PEOPLE
INVOLVED WITH JERRY'S POND AND THE ALEWIFE STUDY GROUP, THE TWO


PAGE 10

Sept 13, 2021

GROUPS INVOLVED WITH IQHQ, DID ANYBODY SAY, THIS WAS GOING TO BE A
TWO WAY BIKE LANE AND THEY WERE GOING TO GET RID OF THE SIDEWALK
IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE INTERESTS OF BICYCLISTS OR THE ALLEGED
INTEREST OF BICYCLISTS. I THINK IT IS DEBATABLE. THIS IS INTRODUCED BY
PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, THEY ARE BICYCLISTS,
BECAUSE THEY CONTINUING IS A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T THINK IT IS A GOOD
IDEA TO MOVE TO GET RID OF A SIDEWALK AND PUSH THE PEDESTRIAN OUT
TO THE A BOARDWALK THEY MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA. IT NEEDS MORE
WORK AND YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY, THE REAL COMMUNITY
THAT LIVE ON RINDGE AVENUE AND STOP TALKING ABOUT US. YOU WANT US
TO PARTICIPATE IF WE AGREE...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS FOR THE TESTIMONY. TABASURI MOSES.
>> HELLO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU. GO AHEAD.
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING? THIS IS GOING TO BE SHORT. I THANK YOU,
MAYOR SIDDIQUI, AND THE CITY COUNCIL, FOR REALLY PICKING UP THE
CHALLENGE OF WORKING THROUGH THIS, NOT GIVING UP AND NOT
WAVERING AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR CAMBRIDGE AND THE
COUNTRY AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I HOPE IT PASSES TONIGHT. I
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S EFFORTS. THAT'S IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'LL GO TO JOEL NOGIC.
>> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, CITY COUNCIL, AND CITY
MANAGER. I'M JOEL, LIVE IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE, CLIFTON STREET. BEEN
HERE 29 YEARS AND I'M A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE ALEWIFE STUDY
GROUP 26 YEARS AGO. I HAVE BEEN WORKING MANY, MANY HOURS OVER
THE LAST YEAR ON THE IQHQ PROJECT. I WANT TO SAY THAT THE ALEWIFE
STUDY GROUP DISCUSSED THE RINDGE AVENUE AREA MANY TIMES WITH
FRIENDS OF JERRY'S AND IQHQ AND OTHERS. THE ASG AGREE WITH THE CITY
MANAGER'S CONCLUSION THAT THE IQHQ'S CURRENT PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY
ADDRESS THE KEY GOALS OF THE POLICY ORDER. WITHOUT NEEDING CITY
FUNDING AND WE AGREE AS THE CITY MANAGER SAYS, THE CURRENT PLAN
FOR THE RINDGE AVENUE AREA IS NOT FINAL. IT IS PROBABLY THE FOURTH
OR FIFTH PLAN THEY HAVE COME FORWARD WITH COMMUNITY INPUT AND
CITY INPUT. THERE ARE ISSUES THAT NEED CONSIDERATION, SUCH AS WHAT
JAMES TALKED ABOUT RECENTLY.
AND IF THE CITY COUNCIL IS REALLY CONSIDERING PUTTING MORE MONEY
INTO THE CITY MONEY INTO THE RINDGE AVENUE AREA, ASG RECOMMENDS
THAT YOU HAVE A YOU SEND IT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD LONG TERM
PLANNING COMMITTEE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AS DIANE MARTIN SAID,
THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLICATED ISSUES ON THE SITE REGARDING
CONTAMINATION, FLOOD PLANE, HABITAT, BICYCLISTS, TRAFFIC, POLLUTION,
NOISE, ET CETERA, AND SO THAT ANY PLAN, WHETHER IT IS FRIENDS OF
JERRY'S PLAN, AND OTHERS, IF ANY MONEY IS SPENT, DETAILS NEED TO
EXPLORED FURTHER AS WELL AS OTHER OPTIONS SUCH AS AN UNDERPASS AT
DANEHY PARK. OR COMMUTER RAIL STOP OR OTHER ITEMS THAT WOULD

PAGE 11

Sept 13, 2021

BENEFIT THE RINDGE AVENUE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. FIRST, I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TREES AS
ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH THEY ARE. EVERY DESIGN STARTS WITH
PARAMETERS AND THE CHOICE OF PARAMETERS INDICATES WHAT WE VALUE.
CAMBRIDGE NEEDS TO VALUE TREES. OTHERWISE, WE GET WHAT WE HAVE
SEEN TOO RECENTLY.
WITH RESPECT TO THE AHA, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A REASONED CIVIL
DISCUSSION BASED ON FACT, NOT IDEOLOGY OR CONJECTURE BECAUSE A
GIRL CAN DREAM. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE CITY CLERK, IT
IS SEVERAL MONTHS FROM NOW, I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THE
EXCELLENT WORK THAT HE HAS DONE AND ALSO FOR PROVEN HOW WELL
SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF CAMBRIDGE CAN DO A VERY IMPORTANT JOB. IT IS A
LESSON THE CITY NEEDS TO LEARN.
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE RESIDENT PARKING PERMIT, I'D REALLY HOPE
THAT THE CITY HANDLES THIS BETTER THAN IT DID UBER AND LYFT AND AIR B
AND B. WITH RODENT CONTROL, DON'T IGNORE THE ACTIVITIES THAT
DISPLACE RATS AND BRING THEM INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WITH RESPECT
TO URBAN FARMS, I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE HOST OF AN URBAN FARM.
I THINK IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ADDITION TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD, IT
PROVIDES FOOD FOR MANY PEOPLE, BUT IT TAKES A WHOLE LOT OF WORK.
THAT MEANS THAT IF THE CITY WANTS TO MAKE THIS A WIDESPREAD
PROGRAM, YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE TO DO
THE WORK OR YOU DON'T GET ANY FOOD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO SUZANN?
>> THANK YOU. WELCOME BACK, CITY COUNCIL. I HOPE YOU HAD A
WONDERFUL SUMMER. THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL. I'M
CALLING IN SUPPORT OF THE REAL CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF TREES AS
ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE NEED TO PLAN AROUND THEM GOING
FORWARD. ARCHITECTS DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. I'M VERY THANKFUL
FOR THE WORK PEOPLE HAVE DONE ON JERRY'S POND AND IMPRESSED WITH
WHAT THEY PROPOSE HIM AND SUPPORT HIM ON THIS. I WILL SPEAK ON THE
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PETITION, WHICH A NUMBER OF US WORKED ON
THROUGH SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER ACROSS DIFFERENT POLITICAL LINES
AND LOOK FOR THE VERY BEST WE CAN DO WITHIN ZONING ITSELF. AND
BELIEVE WE HAVE COME UP WITH REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES THAT CAN BE
ADDRESSED HERE.
IN OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY, ON THE WEST COAST FOR EXAMPLE,
FACEBOOK, AMAZON, GOOGLE, AND APPLE, THEY ARE ALL COMING INTO
PLAY IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS THERE IN THE BAY AREA.
FACEBOOK HAS COMMITTED TO OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. I THINK WE NEED
TO GET OUR LARGE EMPLOYERS TO STEP UP HERE, WHETHER IT IS THE
COMMERCIAL OR INSTITUTIONAL ONES. STUDENTS, IF THEY ARE ROUGHLY
18,000, WHO ARE NOT WITHOUT HOUSING ON CAMPUS, ARE TAKING RENTAL
APARTMENTS THAT COULD BE USED FOR LONG TERM RESIDENTS. GET THEM

Sept 13, 2021

INVOLVED IN ADDRESSING THE SITUATION IN AN AREA WIDE PERSPECTIVE
WITH TRANSPORTATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, PARKING, ET CETERA.
THE FOCUS ON THE PETITION ALSO ON USING THE HOUSES THAT WE HAVE IN
ADDING MORE UNITS WITHIN THEM, REALLY SAFE AND THOUGHTFUL WAY
TO ADD MORE UNITS AND HOUSING, INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE
HOUSES WE HAVE. NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION, WE HAVE OTHERS. I HOPE YOU
WILL THINK ABOUT THIS THOUGHTFULLY WITHOUT RHETORIC AND HELP US
GO FORWARD WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. THANKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S ALL WE HAVE WHO SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC
COMMENT. I KNOW THERE ARE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE. I'M NOT SURE IF
YOU ARE HERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT OR NOT. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. ON

ACCESS AT THE DATA CENTER AND SHARE INFORMATION DAILY WITH THE

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #1
A COMMUNICATION
TRANSMITTED FROM
LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE,
CITY MANAGER,
RELATIVE TO A COVID-19
UPDATE.

Sept 13, 2021

COMMUNITY THROUGH THE EMAIL UPDATE. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO
SHARING INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WITH THE COUNCIL IN THE
WEEKLY DIGEST.
CAMBRIDGE SEVEN DAY MOVING AVERAGE FOR CONFIRMED CASE PER
HUNDRED THOUSAND IS 12.1 CASES TODAY. AND THE PERCENT OF
POSITIVITY IS POINT 53, JUST OVER A HALF OF 1% AS REPORTED ON THE
SEPTEMBER 9 IN THE COMMONWEALTH WEEKLY REPORT.
AS OF TODAY, THE SEVEN DAY AVERAGE PERCENT POSITIVITY IN THE
COMMONWEALTH IS 2.22%. COMPARED TO OVER HALF A PERCENT. 75% OF
THE CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE
VACCINE AND 68% ARE FULLY VACCINATED ACCORDING TO THE
MUNICIPALITY VACCINATION REPORT PUBLISHED ON SEPTEMBER 9.
THE CITY'S COVID 19 METRICS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE DATA CENTER. AND
COVID 19 VACCINES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE ABILITY TO DEFEAT AND
MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THE VIRUS. I ENCOURAGE ANY ELIGIBLE RESIDENT
WHO DIDN'T RECEIVE THE VACCINE CONSIDER RECEIVING ONE STRONGLY
PLEASE. IF YOU HAVE QUESTION OR CONCERN SPEAK WITH YOUR PRIMARY
CARE PROVIDER OR SEEK OUT INFORMATION FROM THE CDC OR THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. VACCINES CONTINUE TO BE
OFFERED AT CVS AND OTHER PHARMACY LOCATION AS WELL AS THE STAR
MARKET AND STORE PHARMACIES. LOCATIONS MAY BE FOUND ONLINE. I
THANK THE ORGANIZERS, THE CAMBRIDGE CARNIVAL AND OTHERS FOR
PRIORITIZING THE INCLUSION OF VACCINE CLINICS AS PART OF THEIR
SUCCESSFUL AND ENJOYABLE COMMUNITY EVENT THIS PAST WEEKEND. I
THANK THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE AND THE COMMONWEALTH OF
VAX BUS FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE. ON SEPTEMBER 9, THE PRESIDENT
ANNOUNCED A PLAN REQUIRING LARGE PRIVATE EMPLOYER TO MANDATE
VACCINES OR REGULAR TESTING FOR EMPLOYEES. AS DIRECTED TO DEVELOP
A RULE THAT REQUIRE LARGE IMPLIES TO ENSURE THE WORKFORCE IS
VACCINATED OR REQUIRE ANY WORKERS UNVACCINATED TO PRODUCE A
NEGATIVE TEST RESULT ON AT LEAST A WEEKLY BASIS.
THIS RULE WILL APPLY TO ALL EMPLOYEES UNDER THE AGENCY'S
JURISDICTION WITH 100 OR MORE EMPLOYEES. THE COMMONWEALTH'S
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS, IT IS NOT EXPECT THIS MANDATE TO
APPLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN MASSACHUSETTS. THE REASON FOR THIS
IS THAT THE STATE'S DLS IS THE LEAD AGENCY THAT ENFORCES WORKPLACE
SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN
MASSACHUSETTS.
HOWEVER, FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO UNDERSTAND OUR SIMILAR VACCINATION
OR WEEKLY TESTING PROGRAM CAN WORK FOR THE CITY'S WORKFORCE.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE AND COMPLICATED TOPIC FOR LEGAL, HUMAN
RESOURCES, AND LOGISTICAL PERSPECTIVE AND WE HAVE MORE WORK TO
DO. WE ARE WORKING NOW TO GATHER DATA ON EMPLOYEE
VACCINATIONS, REVIEW TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO USE TO IMPLEMENT A


PAGE 14

Sept 13, 2021

VACCINATION OR TESTING PROGRAM.
WE ARE BEING IN CONVERSATION WITH THE UNIONS REGARDING IMPACT OF
POSSIBLE PROGRAMS ON THEM. WE'LL EXPLORE HOW THIS MAY WORK FOR
CAMBRIDGE EMPLOYEES. ON AUGUST 23, A MASK MANDATE FOR MUNICIPAL
BUILDINGS OF PUT IN PLACE AND AN EMERGENCY ORDER THAT FACE MASKS
AND COVERINGS WILL BE WORN INDOORS IN PUBLIC PLACES. EMERGENCY
ORDER IS APPLYING TO EVERYBODY OVER AGE OF TWO, WITH THE EXCEPTION
IN THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES. THE
CITY EXTENDED THE PROGRAM IN FEEDING THE HOMELESS RESIDENTS
THROUGH OCTOBER 3, 2021 AND WE ARE NOW IN DISCUSSION TO SEND
THAT DATE. IN MARCH 2020, WE LAUNCHED A PROJECT TO CONTRACT WITH
LOCAL RESTAURANTS TO PROVIDE FOOD TO THE CITY'S HOMELESS
COMMUNITY DURING COVID 19. THE CRISIS.
TO DATE, OVER 240,000 MEALS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND MORE THAN 2700
MEALS ARE BEING DELIVERED EACH WEEK TO SHELTERS IN THE CITY. AND
OVER THE LAST 14 MONTHS, CAMBRIDGE SPENT 1.6 MILLION ON MEALS
PROVIDED TO RESTAURANTS. OVER 65 RESTAURANTS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
THE PROGRAM WHERE MEALS ARE DELIVERED TO 16 SHELTERS IN THE
PROGRAMS THAT THE CITY'S DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES AS
IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A STRONG NEED FOR MEALS. AGAIN, RESTAURANTS
INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS INITIATIVE ARE ENCOURAGED TO
CONTACT THE PURCHASING AGENT.
AS A REMINDER, WE OFFERED COVID TESTING FOUR DAYS A WEEK. OUR FREE
WALK IN TEST IS CAMBRIDGESIDE AND EAST CAMBRIDGE. TESTING
INFORMATION, INCLUDING HOURS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE.
I'M PROUD THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER THE SERVICE. WE HAVE A
TALENTED STAFF AND PARTNERS THAT MAKE THE LOGISTICS LOOK EASY.
WE'LL MONITOR THE TESTING PROGRAM AND IF NEED, WE'LL CONTINUE TO
EXPLORE A FIFTH DAY OF TESTING. THE TESTING PROGRAMS PROVIDE TEST
RESULTS ONLY UNABLE TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED DOCUMENTATION FOR
TRAVEL PURPOSES. THE TRAVEL DOCUMENTATIONS, YOU RECEIVE TESTING
THROUGH ANOTHER LOCATION. TO FIND OTHER OPTIONS, VISIT ONLINE.
THE SITE WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW TO SEARCH FOR TESTING BY ZIP CODE.
THE SITE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT AT HOME COVID 19 TEST THAT
CAN BE ORDERED ONLINE.
FINALLY, AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS OPEN SPACE USED BY MANY PEOPLE DURING
THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC. I HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH CITY STAFF AND WITH
THE CONTRACTORS AND BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE COME UP WITH A
POTENTIAL SOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW PARK RENOVATIONS TO CONTINUE
AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING PUBLIC ACCESS TO PARTS OF THE PARK WHILE
RENOVATIONS OCCUR. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR WEEKS AND I
THANK MANY RESIDENTS FOR CONCERNS AND FEEDBACK AND TO HELP US
ADDRESS THE MATTER AS WELL AS THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL FOR
ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS INITIATIVE.
AS WE HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC, WE'LL CONTINUE TO


PAGE 15

Sept 13, 2021

MONITOR DATA COMING UP FROM THE COMMONWEALTH, WORK WITH CITY
DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS, TO
ENSURE WE SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE
COMMUNITY. AS WITH EACH PREVIOUS DECISION MADE, I'LL CONTINUE TO
WORK CLOSELY WITH MY TEAM, PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, THE STATE,
AND THE REGIONAL PARTNERS. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SUE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN YOU PUSH THAT BUTTON.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, AND GOOD EVENING TO
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. I APPRECIATE HAVING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CITY. FIRST, I'D LIKE
TO TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELF. AND WHY I ENDED UP IN THE SEAT. I WAS AN
EMPLOYEE OF THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR 27 YEARS.
WE DON'T NEED TO COMMENT ON THAT.
AND FOR THE LAST HALF OF THAT, IT WAS IN THE COMMUNICAL DISEASE
AREA SO THAT THINKING BACK TO H1N1, EBOLA, MEASLE OUTBREAK, FOOD
BORNE OUTBREAK, THAT'S MY EXPERTISE. AND I WORKED IN SCHOOL
HEALTH SERVICES, WITH THE CLINICAL COMPONENT THAT I BROUGHT, I WAS
RECRUITED AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PULLED OUT OF
RETIREMENT AND SIT HERE AND HELP GET THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE TIME
THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THIS VIRUS COVID. WITH THAT, I'LL TAKE THE
FIRST SLIDE.
SO, AS A SNAPSHOT, YOU CAN SEE, OVER 7,000 TOTAL CASES, WITH 6760 IN
THE COMMUNITY, 300 IN LONG TERM CARE. 124 DEATHS. 332 CASES ARE
ACTIVE AND AS YOU HEARD, FROM THE CITY MANAGER, 12.1 CONFIRMED
CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A POSITIVITY RATE OF POINT 53.
WE HAVE OVER TIME, WE HAVE BEEFED UP THE COMMUNITY TESTING. AS
OF SEPTEMBER 8, THE CITY IS OFFERING COVID 19 TESTING FOUR DAYS A
WEEK AND FOUR HOUR SESSIONS. AS INFECTION RATES ROSE IN MID JULY
DEMANDING FOR TESTING SHARPLY INCREASED. OVER 10,000 TESTS WERE
ADMINISTERED IN AUGUST AT A CITY RUN SITE, THE HIGHEST MONTHLY
TOTAL SINCE APRIL.
CITY RUN TESTING SITES ARE ADMINISTERING ABOUT A THOUSAND TESTS A
SESSION. RESIDENT CAN ALSO GET TESTED AT OTHER PLACES, SUCH AS LOCAL
PHARMACIES, AND SOME PRIVATE PRACTICES AND CLINICS. AND THERE IS A
WEBSITE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND FIND OUT WHERE
SOME OF OTHER WHERE SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES AND LOCATIONS
ARE.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SCHOOL BASED TESTING. RECENTLY, WE HAD A STAFF
MEETING AND I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT
IS HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS TO KEEP OUR STAFF AND STUDENTS SAFE IN
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO DOING THAT. THE FIRST THING
THAT IS HAPPENING IS ROUTINE COVID SAFETY CHECKS. THEY WERE KNOWN
AS POOL TESTING. YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. POOL
TESTING, YOU TAKE ANYWHERE 2 10 SAMPLES OF SPECIMEN AND YOU SHAKE
THEM UP IN A BOTTLE AND SEND IT OFF TO A LAB. IF IT COMES BACK

PAGE 16

Sept 13, 2021

POSITIVE, WHAT THEY WILL DO, COME BACK AND THEN DO A RAPID POSITIVE
TEST ON THE SPOT. AND THEN IDENTIFY THAT PARTICULAR STAFF OR CHILD
THAT CAUSED THAT POSITIVE POOLED RESULT.
THEY HAVE STARTED TO INCLUDE SYMPTOMATIC TESTING WHICH IS OFFERED
ON SITE FOR THOSE WHO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS AT SCHOOL. AND NOW
THERE IS TEST AND STAY. IT IS OFFERED TO UNVACCINATED, CLOSE
CONTACTS, FROM AN IN SCHOOL EXPOSURE. WHERE THEY DO A DAILY RAPID
TEST FOR FIVE DAYS FOR UNVACCINATED PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN
EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS TO AVOID UNNECESSARY QUARANTINES.
IF YOU WONDER WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS IS DISCOVERED ON A WEDNESDAY,
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT PERSON WILL BE TESTED OR CHILD WILL BE
TESTED ON WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, AND FRIDAY. THEY MUST QUARANTINE
ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THEN GO BACK AND BE TESTED AGAIN ON
MONDAY. DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS AND THEN FINISH THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF DAYS TO BE TESTED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
OUR FLU AND COVID VACCINE CLINICS. FLU CLINICS TRADITIONALLY HAVE
BEEN OUR HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR. OFTEN VERY BUSY, WELL ATTENDED.
WE'LL BE OFFERING FLU SHOTS AT HOMELESS SHELTERS, MEALS PROGRAMS,
SENIOR HOUSING, ALL THROUGH OCTOBER. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE LARGE
PUBLIC FLU CLINICS AND COVID 19 VACCINE CLINICS HELD AT SITES
THROUGHOUT THE CITY AS YOU CAN SEE THERE AND ALSO ON THE WEBSITE.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK AND CURIOSITY ABOUT
BOOSTER SHOTS. WE HAVE WE CPHD, HAVE NOTIFIED THE STATE AND
WANT TO KNOW IF WE ARE INTERESTED IN ADMINISTERING PFIZER OR
MODERNA VACCINES. WE ANSWER YES, WE'LL DO THAT FOR OUR
COMMUNITY. ONE OTHER THING THEY WERE INTERESTED IN, IF WE DO IT
FOR OTHER NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. OUR INTENT IS TO FOCUS ON
CAMBRIDGE. AS YOU HEARD, 68% FULLY VACCINATED CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS, 75% CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE
DOSE OF VACCINE.
AND THERE WE HAVE IT. 76,000 PLUS RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED,
WHICH IS UP 9% OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS.
HERE WE HAVE DATA BREAKDOWN. IN TERMS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY. AND
THE PROPORTION OF THE RESIDENTS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WHO RECEIVED
AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT IT, WE OUTDO
THE STATE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. IT IS INTERESTING. WE HAVE A
MULTIRACIAL DISCREPANCY THERE. 68% IN CAMBRIDGE TO 93%. I'M NOT
REALLY SURE WHY THAT IS LIKE THAT. IT COULD BE HOW PEOPLE COLLECT
MULTIRACIAL DATA AND HOW IT'S SET UP. IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED IN
HAVING MORE INFORMATION ON THAT, THEY CAN GET BACK TO ME. I WILL
SEE WHY THAT NUMBER LOOKS LIKE THAT.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AGAIN, THIS IS BY AGE AND GENDER. I THINK THE ONE
THING THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT HERE, YOU CAN SEE KEEPING NECK IN
NECK WITH THE DATA, OUR 55% IN THE 16 19 YEARS OF AGE, IT HAS GONE
UP. IT WAS HANGING IN THE 40S FOR THE LONGEST TIME. WE ARE MAKING

PAGE 17

Sept 13, 2021

PROGRESS IN THAT AREA. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE MORE
PROGRESS.
NEXT SLIDE. WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE. FOUR SAMPLING LOCATIONS
WILL COME ONLINE IN SEPTEMBER. SITES INCLUDE MULTIPLE RESIDENTIAL
BUILDINGS, DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVID 19. AND A
REPRESENTATIVE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY. BY MONITORING THE
TARGETED LOCATIONS, CPHD AND CITY PARTNERS, ONE CAN RESPOND
QUICKLY WHEN HIGHER LEVELS OF VIRUS ARE DETECTED IN THE
WASTEWATER AND REACH OUT TO THOSE IMPACTED TO PREVENT FURTHER
TRANSMISSION. WE CAN ASSESS IF SPIKES ARE EARLY INDICATORS OF
INCREASED RISK CITY WIDE. I THINK THAT'S IT.
AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF OF THE CAMBRIDGE
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS OR PARTNERS, PARTICULARLY THE
NURSING AND THE EPIDEMIOLOGY STAFF WHO CONTINUE TO WORK SEVEN
DAYS A WEEK AND LONG HOURS TO STAY ON TOP OF THE TRACK ING AND
THE DATA AND THE CLINICS AND THE INCREDIBLE WORK THEY DO. I
WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THEM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ABSOLUTELY.
>> I ALSO HAVE WITH US I HAVE DR. DOBBERTEEN WHO IS HERE TO HELP
WITH ANY QUESTIONS.
>> CITY MANAGER: AND ELLEN SEMONOFF WILL COME UP AND WE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL START WITH QUESTIONS ON ZOOM AND THEN
WE'LL GO TO THE REST OF THE COUNCIL. WE'LL START WITH COUNCILLOR
CARLONE AND COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. I SAW COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S
HAND AND THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> AT THIS TIME, I HAVE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR TOOMEY? I DON'T SEE
QUESTIONS AT THE TIME. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND FOLLOWED BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK
AND FOR THE PRESENTATION AND WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> NOT REALLY WELCOME. YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE. BUT
WELCOME IN THE NEW ROLE. MAYBE I SHOULD KNOW THIS, SORRY IF I
SHOULD AND I DON'T. I KNOW CONFIDENTIALITY IS OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS IN
MEDICAL A CONCERN. DO WE KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DATA WE
COLLECT OR THE STATE COLLECTS, DO WE KNOW WHO IS VACCINATED AND
WHO IS NOT. IF WE DO, IS THERE A WAY TO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO
HAVE NOT MORE DIRECTLY TO PROVIDE EDUCATION OR FIND OUT WHY
SOME PEOPLE NEVER WILL. SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE FEARS WE CAN
ADDRESS. I DON'T KNOW. DO WE KNOW WHO HAS BEEN OR WHO HAS NOT
BEEN. I DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO PUT THAT IN THE NEWSPAPER. DO YOU


PAGE 18

Sept 13, 2021

KNOW AND WE CAN DO A MORE TARGETED OUTREACH?
>> THROUGH YOU...
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS STOLE MY SEAT.
>> I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. IT IS A
DIFFICULT ONE TO ANSWER. FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S A DATABASE. A HUGE
DATABASE AT THE STATE. IT IS CALLED MIAS, TRACKING ALL VACCINATIONS
THAT ARE GIVEN. WHAT IS NOT EASY, TO USE THAT DATABASE TO SEE WHERE
PEOPLE ARE. SO WE CAN TARGET OUTREACH. THE EFFORT TO REACH PEOPLE
PRETTY MUCH IS THE SAME THROUGH MEDIA, EDUCATION, OUR PARTNERS
SUPPORTING US IN DOING THE WORK AND GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT.
WE LOOK AT THE DATA. WE HAVE A WONDERFUL EPIDEMIOLOGIST WHO HAS
DONE THE NEIGHBORHOOD TRACKING AND ZIP CODE TRACKING. AND NOW
WITH THE NEW WASTEWATER TESTING YOU CAN SEE THAT CAN GIVE US
MORE OF AN IDEA. THAT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAY TO GET IT. WE
CAN'T GO THROUGH THE DATABASE FOR EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID, HIPAA
COMPLIANCE AND THE LIKES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: MY LAST QUESTION, WE HAVE THIS GAP
BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FULLY VACCINATED AND THOSE WHO
HAVE ONE SHOT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO
THAT 75% WHO HAD ONE SHOT, ARE SOME FOLKS NOT COMING BACK FOR A
SECOND SHOT OR CAN WE ASSUME THEY EVENTUALLY WILL AND A LAG IN
THE DATA OR IN THEIR AVAILABILITY TO GET THE SECOND SPOT AND THE
PERCENT WILL RISE. WE HAVE THE GAP AND I KEEP THINKING, IF 75% GOT
THE FIRST SHOT, SHOULDN'T WE SEE THE OTHER NUMBER RISE WHEN THEY
GET THE SECOND. IT NEVER SEEMS TO. MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
>> I'M GOING TO ASK LISA TO CHIME IN. I THINK THE ONE THING I'D SAY,
THERE'S A ONE SHOT VACCINE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT CLOUDS
THAT NUMBER AND PARTIALLY WHAT YOU SAY. DR. DOBBERTEEN?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. GOOD
EVENING. THAT'S A COMPLICATED NUMBER AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF
FACTORS. RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE,
SINGLE DOSE, ARE IN THE FULLY COMPLETED CATEGORY. THERE'S A FIVE DAY
LOG BETWEEN WHEN SOMEONE GETS THE VACCINE AND GOES INTO THE
SYSTEM. IT IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND IT IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME IN
THAT IF YOU ADD AN EXTRA S, SPELL A NAME WRONG, BOOM... YOU ARE
MISLABELLED AND SHOW UP AS NOT HAVING YOUR SECOND DOSE WHEN
YOU HAVE.
SOME OF IT IS RECORDING. SOME IS A LAG TIME. AND SOME AS MORE AND
MORE PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED, IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET TO THE TO
COMPLETE YOUR INTERVAL BEFORE YOU CAN GET YOUR SECOND DOSE. IT IS
A COMBINATION OF ALL THE FACTORS, I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE GAP
BETWEEN THE TWO NUMBERS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. WE CAN EXPECT WE SHOULD SEE


PAGE 19

Sept 13, 2021

THAT 68% CONTINUE TO GO UP AS PEOPLE
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: AS THE 75%, BARRING THE MISSPELLINGS.
>> WE DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE HANGING AROUND WITH ONE SHOT
AND DECIDING NOT TO GO BACK. WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR
NOLAN, AND VICE MAYOR MALLON. AND THEN COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE
PRESENTATION. THIS QUESTION IS FOR THE CITY MANAGER. AS YOU MAY
KNOW, SOMERVILLE, BOSTON, MALDEN, HAVE PUT IN PLACE EVICTION
MORATORIUMS TO PROTECT THEIR TENANTS. DO WE HAVE ANY PLANS TO
DO THE SAME THING IN CAMBRIDGE? WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
DANGERS AND THE CDC RECOMMENDATION S THAT WE PROTECT TENANTS
FROM EVICTION SO WE CAN PREVENT PROTECT THEM FROM GETTING SICK.
OR CONGRESSWOMAN PRESLEY HAS CALLED ON THE MORATORIUMS.
>> CITY MANAGER: I'M NOT SURE IF MAURA IS ON THE LINE. WE ARE GOING
OVER WHAT WE DO PROVIDE AND THERE IS AN INTENSE LIST OF WHAT WE
SEE AND FACING. I CAN GET THAT INFORMATION IF MAURA IS NOT ON THE
LINE. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE AND WANT TO BE PREPARED IF
THAT CHANGES. I CAN GET THE INFORMATION THAT MAURA IS GOING OVER
WITH. IF THAT IS HELPFUL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TO SHARE, I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO MAURA AND THE
SOLICITOR HAS INFORMATION ABOUT BOSTON'S GUIDANCE AND THERE
WERE QUESTIONS ASKED.
(PLEASE HOLD FOR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES).
>> ... IN DISCUSSION FINDING OUTSIDE SERVICES, WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT
IN CAMBRIDGE, A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ON UNIVERSITY HAVE FOUND OTHER
WAYS TO GET VACCINATED. I THINK WE READ THAT WE ARE PROVIDING AS
MANY TESTS IN CAMBRIDGE AS THE REST OF THE STATE IN A GIVEN WEEK.
WE WANT TO THANK THE RESIDENTS FOR DOING THAT. WE ARE IN THE
DISCUSSION OF HOW TO PROVIDE MORE TEST SITES, WHERE THAT WOULD
BE. WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE EVERYBODY A CHANCE TO GET SETTLED. WE'RE
ON IT. AND IF WE THINK WE NEED IT, WE'RE NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WAYS TO DO IT WITHOUT TAXING THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR THE FIRE.
WE HAD A DISCUSSION ON THAT TODAY. WE MAY HAVE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT SOON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT UPDATE. I
WAS GLAD TO SEE WE'RE DOING RAPID TESTING IN THE SCHOOLS. ARE WE
THINKING ABOUT PROVIDING THAT TO THE GENERAL POPULATION AS WELL?
THE PCR TESTS ARE THE GOLD STANDARD, FOR SURVEILLANCE, WE MAY


PAGE 20

Sept 13, 2021

BENEFIT FROM RAPID TESTING AS WELL.
>> THE RAPID TESTING DOES HAVE ITS PLACE AND IS REALLY USEFUL. THE
ONE THING IT IS NOT GREAT AT IS SURVEILLANCE. SO MANY PEOPLE WHO
TEST IN THE HOME, THERE'S NO WAY TO TRACK. NO WAY TO REPORT WHAT
THE RESULTS ARE. SO, IT IS LIKE A PREGNANCY TEST. YOU TAKE IT. YOU GET
YOUR RESULTS. AND WHEN YOU GET YOUR RESULTS, YOU ARE EITHER HAPPY
WITH IT OR YOU ARE NOT. THAT'S THE END. IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE.
YOU MAY SHARE WITH THE FAMILY, YOU DON'T CALL THE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT AND SAY... BY THE WAY, I HAVE A POSITIVE TEST. THERE'S
ALSO NOT A WAY, EVEN IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT, TO BE ACCEPTED INTO
THE DATABASE BECAUSE NOT THAT THE TEST ITSELF IS NOT RELIABLE, BUT
THERE IS THE PERSON THAT IS DOING THAT. IT HAS TO DO WITH CONTROL.
MAKE SURE THEY DID IT RIGHT. THERE WASN'T ANY CONTAMINATION.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS, NOT IDEAL FOR SURVEILLANCE, BUT
GOOD IN THE MOMENT, UNDER SUPERVISED CONDITION, LIKE IN THE
SCHOOLS, TO FIND OUT RAPIDLY IF SOMEONE IS POSITIVE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M CONFUSED. IT SEEMS TO ME
WITH CAN PROVIDE RAPID TEST IN A SIMILAR WAY WE'RE DOING PCR TESTS
RIGHT NOW. IT WOULD STILL BE SUPERVISED, BUT GET RESULTS MORE
QUICKLY. ALSO, MY WIFE IS A FACULTY AT HARVARD, THEY ARE REQUIRED TO
DO HOME TESTING, BUT THEY SEND IT IN SO THE RESULTS ARE TRACKED THAT
WAY. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE SOME WAYS
>> YES, THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT. FOR US, IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH
THE STATE AND HOW WE TRACK DISEASE FOR A WHOLE COMMUNITY IS
DIFFERENT FOR AN ORGANIZATION OR A BUSINESS. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
HARVARD IS SMALL, BUT YOU KNOW, IT DOES REQUIRE A DIFFERENT
STRATEGY AND A DIFFERENT APPROACH. SO BECAUSE WE REPORT TO THE
STATE, THIS IS HOW WE HAVE TO REPORT. THEY DO NOT ACCEPT RAPID
TESTING.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY LAST QUESTION IS WE HAVE
SEEN OUR VACCINATION RATES HAVE KIND OF STABILIZED. I'M WONDERING
WHAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE THAT AND WHETHER WE ARE CONSIDERING
ANY VACCINE MANDATES, INCLUDING CITY STAFF?
>> WE TALK REGULARLY ABOUT THIS. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE REACHED THE
POINT WHERE AS MUCH AS WE MAKE VACCINES AVAILABLE, THERE'S A
POPULATION THAT SEEMS TO NOT BE INTERESTED. SUE HAS IDEAS ABOUT
WAYS TO REACH. BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO SUE, AS I STATED, WE ARE NOT
READY TO MANDATE VACCINE FOR CITY EMPLOYEES. WE ARE TRYING TO
FIND OUT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT EXACTLY, AS YOU SAID, WHAT
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE, NOT BY NAME, BUT HOW MANY EMPLOYEES
HAVE BEEN VACCINATED AS A PERCENTAGE. WE THINK WE HAVE AN IDEA.
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PUT A TESTING PROGRAM IN PLACE AND HOW
WE'D GO ABOUT DOING THAT AND WE HAVE BEEN HAVING DISCUSSIONS ON
THAT FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS NOW. IT IS COMPLICATED. I THINK IF THE
POINT COMES WHERE WE FEEL WE HAVE TO DO THIS AND WE START TO TALK
TO THE UNIONS, I WANT IT IN PLACE TO SAY TODAY IS THE DAY WE CHOOSE,

PAGE 21

Sept 13, 2021

NOT THE DAY WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO START HOW TO PUT SOMETHING
IN PLACE TO BE MONITORED AND SUCCESSFUL. IT IS COMPLICATED, BUT WE
ARE MAKING PROGRESS. THAT IS THE GAME PLAN. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
WE CAN POSSIBLY GET MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED. LIKE I SAID, IT WAS
GREAT AT THE TWO EVENTS. WE HAD VACCINES AND I WAS TOLD ABOUT
THERE WAS VERY LIMITED. STILL ONE IS A PLUS. IT IS HARD RIGHT NOW.
THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP. SUE HAD
A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
>> YES, WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON TEST STRATEGIES FOR BUSINESSES
AND ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE CITY. I THINK WE CAN DO REALLY I THINK
WE CAN BE CREATIVE GIVEN THE TIME TO MAKE SURE WE EVALUATE THE
NUANCES THAT IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES WHEN YOU TRY TO IMPLEMENT
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'LL TELL YOU, AFTER MANY YEARS OF HAVING DONE
CLINICS, YOU DO REACH A SATURATION POINT.
THE STRATEGIES FOR OUTREACH REALLY ARE THE SAME. I CAN TELL YOU
THAT WE JUST NEED TO BE DILIGENT AND CONTINUING OUR MESSAGING
AND GETTING OUR INFORMATION OUT THERE. REACHING OUT TO
POPULATIONS FROM OUR DATA. WE HAVE A GREAT AMBASSADOR
PROGRAM THAT HELPS US GO TO DOOR TO DOOR, SOME REAL GRASSROOTS
STUFF, STILL THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE. BUT EVEN AT THAT, YOU DO
REACH A STAT SATURATION POINT. I THINK A STRATEGY FOR ORGANIZATIONS
IS THE WAY TO GO AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IMPACTFUL
TO PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AND FAMILIES. IT WILL TAKE TIME. IT IS NOT
ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE HASTILY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN VICE MAYOR
MALLON, FOLLOWED BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I SENT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN
EARLIER TO THE CITY MANAGER. HOPEFULLY, YOU HAVE THEM. THEY
FOLLOW UP ON WHAT COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN SAID EARLIER ABOUT VACCINATION. I'M ON THE RECORD, THE
COUNCIL WANTS 100% STAFF VACCINATION, WHETHER IT IS A MANDATE OR
ANY OTHER WAY. WE HAD ASKED TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR THAT REPORT
ON THAT. IT IS A REPORT, BUT IT IS NOT IN PLACE. I HOPE IT IS IN PLACE
SOON. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS UNDER TURMOIL, BUT THE PRESIDENT
DECIDED TO MANDATE ALL FEDERAL WORKERS, NO TESTING OPTION, YOU
WILL GET A VACCINE. AND I HOPE CAMBRIDGE WILL LEAN THAT WAY. I HAVE
A QUESTION FOLLOWING THE PRESENTATION ON THE PERCENTAGE BY AGE. I
HAD TALKED COUPLE OF PARENTS WERE INFORMED THAT 44% OF THE
STUDENTS ARE vaccinated. WE HAVE SOMETHING BEFORE US THAT SAYS IT IS
55% OF THAT AGE GROUP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS FOR
SPECIFICALLY CRLS STUDENTS. IF IT IS THAT LOW, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO
GET IT UP. 92% FOR THE 12 15 YEAR OLDS. IT SHOULD BE 100% OR 95% AT
THE HIGH SCHOOL. IF IS NOT THAT LOW, STILL PRETTY LOW, LET'S MAKE
SURE PARENTS HAVE THE CORRECT NUMBER. AT SOME POINT, SOME OF
THEM WERE TOLD IT WAS 44%, WHICH IS SHOCKINGLY LOW IN MY VIEW.


PAGE 22

Sept 13, 2021

>> I'M GOING TO LET LISA AS THE SCHOOL HEALTH DIRECTOR ANSWER THIS
QUESTION.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. THE NUMBER OF 44% IS UNOFFICIAL
NUMBER. THE NUMBERS SHOWN TONIGHT ARE THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS OF
STUDENTS IN THE 12 15 AGE RANGE AND THE 16 19 AGE RANGE AND THE
CRLS POPULATION BRACKETS BOTH GROUPS. 12 15 YEAR OLD ARE BROUGHT
BY PARENTS TO GET VACCINATED. THANK YOU PARENTS. 16 19 YEAR OLDS
BRING THEMSELVES. AND TRADITIONALLY, IN PUBLIC HEALTH, THOSE ARE
THE GROUPS THAT ARE MOST THAT IS THE GROUP THAT WEARS THE SEAT
BELT LESS OFTEN AND ENGAGE IN RISKY BEHAVIORS MORE OFTEN. WE LOOK
AT THAT AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC. WE EXPLORE
A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT WILL BE CRLS SPECIFIC, OFFERING VACCINES AT
THE HIGH SCHOOL AS WE DID LAST YEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I HOPE WE DO ALL WE CAN. I RECOGNIZE THE AGE
GROUP IS A CHALLENGE. THEY WANT TO BE SAFE. I'M SURE WE CAN DO A
MARKETING CAMPAIGN. SOME WAY I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE OF THAT. IT IS
STILL VERY LOW AND I HOPE WE GET TO 100% STAFF VACCINATED THROUGH
MANDATES OR ANY WAY WE CAN. MY SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE MASK
MANDATE. WE HAVE REVIEWED, IT CURRENTLY EXEMPTS RESIDENTIAL
BUILDINGS, INCLUDING ONES WITH LARGE NUMBER OF UNITS WITH
COMMON SPACES ENCLOSED, ELEVATORS, ET CETERA, LAST YEAR THE
MARRING MANDATE INDOORS, INCLUDED THE SPACES IN THE MASK
MANDATE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW AND GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY, WHAT IS
THE RATIONALE FOR NOT INCLUDING THEM, WE ARE ALL SITTING HERE WITH
MASK, WHICH IS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO THE SITUATION. WE ARE
INDOORS AND IF WE ARE VACCINATED, WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT CAN HELP LESSEN THE SPREAD. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE IN
THE BUILDINGS, IF I GO INTO AN ELEVATOR WITH SOMEONE NOT MASKED
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE VACCINATED, IT SEEMS ON THAT SCORE, WE
SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR EXPLANATION ABOUT WHY WE ARE NOT DOING IT
AND PERHAPS START IT.
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THE MASK MANDATE, WE
STARTED WITH MUNICIPALITIES. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT WHAT
HAPPENED IN THE BEGINNING OF COVID CAN BE A COOKIE CUTTER
BLUEPRINT OF WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TODAY. I THINK THAT'S HOW WE ARE
APPROACHING THIS. WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THE STAFF MANDATE FOR
PUBLIC BUILDINGS, IT WAS BASED ON THE DATA AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING
IN THAT MOMENT IN TIME, WHICH IS HOW A LOT OF THE DECISIONS ARE
MADE BY WATCHING THE NUMBERS AND THE DATA AND LOOKING AT WHAT
THE VIRUS IS DOING IN THE COMMUNITY.
THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE ACTUALLY IN DISCUSSION S ABOUT LOOKING AT
NEXT STEPS, WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE STRONGER.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. JUST A QUICK FOLLOW ON AND THIS IS
MY LAST POINT. GIVEN THAT, WE LOOK AT DATA, BASE ON DATA, IF IT TURNS


PAGE 23

Sept 13, 2021

OUT SOMETHING WE SHOULD STRONGER STEPS, WE'LL DO THAT. WE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE DATA THAT WILL TELL US WE DON'T
NEED A MASK MANDATE. WHAT ARE THE METRICS WE USE TO SET THE MASK
MANDATE, BUT TO SAY, WE NOW DON'T NEED IT. WE HAVE HAD VARIOUS
MEASURES OF THAT IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF CASES PER HUNDRED
THOUSAND. I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE HAVE SET THE METRICS, IF SO, IT
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW. IF WE ACHIEVE IT, WE CAN SAY YOU ACHIEVE
THIS AND WE DON'T NEED TO WEAR THEM.
>> UNFORTUNATELY, NO MAGIC BULLET NUMBER. IT IS ABOUT WATCHING
FOR A SUSTAINED, I THINK THE KEY WORD HERE IS "SUSTAINED" DECLINE IN
THE NUMBERS. WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT. WE HAVE BEEN INCREMENTALLY
GOING UP. WE WERE IN THE SUBSTANTIAL RANGE FOR A LONG TIME, WHICH
WAS WHEN WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASK MANDATE THAT WE HAVE.
AND NOW WE'RE WELL, WE'RE IN THE HIGH ZONE. SO, THIS VIRUS DOES
WHAT IT WANTS TO DO. IN THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES WORK. I'M A FULL
AND FIRM BELIEVER IN THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. BESIDES VACCINE,
SOCIAL DISTANCING, MASKING, HANDWASHING. I CAN'T GIVE YOU WHAT IS
THAT GOING TO BE. THE KEY WORD TO ME IS A SUSTAINED DECLINE OVER
TIME.
>> CITY MANAGER: THAT'S PROBABLY THE QUESTION WE GOT THE MOST
WITH THE MASK MANDATE. NOT JUST ONE MEASURE WE'LL LOOK AT, BUT
WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. IF WE SEE A TREND ONE WAY OR
THE OTHER, WE'LL ADDRESS THE SITUATION IN A MORE RESTRICTIVE WAY OR
LESS RESTRICTIVE WAY. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE MONITORING STAGES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. YOU WILL BE
LOOKING AT NUMBERS. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW, IF THIS IS
SUSTAINED, THIS IS WHEN WE'LL DECIDE. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON AND THEN COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. WELCOME AND NICE TO SEE YOU. I
HAD SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AROUND THE ASKING THE CITY MANAGER TO
LOOK AT PUTTING IN A VACCINATION MANDATE FOR ALL CITY EMPLOYEES.
LOOKING AT BOSTON, SOMERVILLE, THEY PUT IN VACCINE MANDATES FOR
THE CITY EMPLOYEES. TEACHERS ARE IN BARGAINING RIGHT NOW WITH THE
UNION AROUND VACCINE MANDATES. I'M CURIOUS, HOW WE THINK ABOUT
INSTITUTING A VACCINE MANDATE OR HOW WE ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT
INSTITUTING A MAN DAY. KNOWING THE PRESIDENT SAID, MUNICIPAL
GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT COVERED BECAUSE OF OSHA, BUT IT WOULD SEEM
WE HAVE A STRONG CASE TO DO CITY MANDATES. I WANT TO GO BACK TO
THAT. I KNOW YOU SAID IT IS COMPLICATED. IT IS THE NUMBER ONE
QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME, WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT A MANDATE FOR
CITY EMPLOYEES.
>> CITY MANAGER: NOBODY HAS PUT A VACCINE MANDATE IN ANYWHERE.
VACCINE MANDATE, SOMEONE CHOOSES NOT TO BE VACCINATED, THEY
NEED TO BE FIRED. WE HAVE CHECKED WITH EVERY CITY, THAT IS NOT WHAT

PAGE 24

Sept 13, 2021

IS IN PLACE. IT IS CONFUSING. WE LIKE WHAT BOSTON AND SOMERVILLE ARE
DOING AND NOW LOOKING INTO A VACCINE PROGRAM THAT WOULD NOT
MANDATE THE EMPLOYEES TO GET VACCINATED, BUT MANDATE THEY GET
TESTED. TO DO THAT TYPE OF TESTING, IT IS VERY COMPLICATED. WE ARE
LOOKING AT IT NOW AND IN DISCUSSION WITH THE UNION. I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT SAYS PEOPLE HAVE TO BE VACCINATED IF
I CAN'T HAVE A SYSTEM TO GUARANTEE WE CAN ASSURE HOW WE FIND OUT
IF PEOPLE ARE NOT VACCINATED.
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION, IT IS A GOOD ONE. SOMETHING WE PUT A LOT
OF TIME IN. IT IS CONFUSION. MANDATE IS DIFFERENT THAN TESTING AND
WE ARE IN LINE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT, IF WE DECIDE A TESTING
OPTION IN, IN TALKING TO CITIES THAT HAVE THIS, NONE OF THEM HAVE
IMPLEMENTED A TESTING DECISION YET WHERE THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE
FACT IF SOMEONE WASN'T TESTED WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO.
I KNOW PEOPLE ARE AHEAD OF US IN TERMS OF THAT, IN TERMS OF THE
IMPLEMENTATION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE. I
DON'T WANT TO BE CRITICAL OF OTHER CITIES, MAYBE THEY ARE NOT AS
STAR ADVANCED AS WE THINK. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT
THAT. NOT AN EASY DECISION. I THINK THE TESTING PIECE IS SOMETHING
WE'LL STRONGLY CONSIDER AND STARTING TO TALK TO UNIONS AND TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS. LIKE I SAID, IT IS A COMPLICATED
TO PUT A SYSTEM IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOW US TO MEASURE THIS. I
THINK WE CAN GET THERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING YOU
JUST SAID. A LOT OF THE RESIDENTS ARE HOPING THAT THERE WILL BE SOME
TYPE OF ANNOUNCEMENT AROUND A VACCINE MANDATE WITH A TESTING
OPTION LIKE SOMERVILLE HAS ANNOUNCED. LIKE BOSTON ANNOUNCED AND
A LOT OF MUNICIPALITIES ARE COMING FORWARD AND ANNOUNCING. JUST
KNOW, IT IS OUT THERE. THE RESIDENTS ARE CONCERNED AND CURIOUS
ABOUT WHAT THE CITY WILL DO AROUND THE EMPLOYEES.
ALL MY OTHER QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERS. THANKS TO
MY COLLEAGUES FOR PUTTING THEM FORWARD. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE DAILY COVID TRACKING NUMBERS. WE HAVE MORE CASES THAN WE
DID THIS TIME LAST YEAR. AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT DELTA AND
THE TRANSMISSIBILITY AND THE VARIANTS. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK WE
HAVE MORE COVID CASES PER DAY THAN WE DID IN SEPTEMBER OF 2020
AND 75% OF THE RESIDENTS vaccinated. I'M CURIOUS, IF WE HAVE A SENSE
OF WHERE THE CASES COME FROM. WE HAVE DIFFERENT ACTIVITY
PATTERNS THAN WE DID A YEAR AGO. MORE FOLKS ARE GOING INTO WORK
IN PERSON OR DOING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. IF THE CONTRACT TRACERS KNOW,
IF WE SEE DIFFERENT TRENDS IN TERMS OF CASES COMING FROM
HOUSEHOLD TRANSMISSION VERSUS A PARTY OR PEOPLE CONTRACTING IT AT

PAGE 25

Sept 13, 2021

THEIR JOB. THE SAME AS BEFORE, ALL THE VACCINATIONS AND JUST
AMPLIFIED WHAT THE TRENDS ARE SAYING IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE
CONTRACT COVID RIGHT NOW?
>> THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. I WILL HAVE LISA JOIN ME AND I DO
HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY. THE ONE THING WE DO NOT MONITOR IN
A WAY THAT MAY BE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE MONITORED IS WHERE
BREAKTHROUGH CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, LISA, WE DON'T MONITOR
BREAKTHROUGH VACCINES THE SAME WAY. THAT'S SORT OF A DIFFERENT
QUESTION.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: YES AND NO. IT IS COMPLICATED.
>> EVERYTHING IS COMPLICATED. WE ARE SEEING IT EVERYWHERE AND
TRACKING IT IN THE SAME WAY. TO ME, I THINK, WHICH IS STRIKING, EVEN
WHEN IT COMES TO BREAKTHROUGH VACCINES, WE SEE CLUSTERS STILL. I'M
GOING TO LET LISA TAKE OVER AND TALK FROM HER PERSPECTIVE. IT IS LIKE
DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: EXACTLY. WHEN WE THINK OF THE COVID DISEASE
WE ARE SEEING NOW, IT FALLS INTO TWO GROUPS. SERIOUS DISEASE THAT
INCLUDES HOSPITALIZATION, BEING ON VENTILATORS, AND SADLY DEATH.
THAT IS 99% IN UNVACCINATED PEOPLE. THE OTHER GROUP OF DISEASE IS
BREAKTHROUGH DISEASE IN VACCINATED PEOPLE. ALL OF THIS IS BECAUSE
THE DELTA VARIANT IS SO TRANSMISSIBLE. THE INITIAL STRAIN OF COVID
VIRUS, ONE PERSON WOULD INFECT TWO PEOPLE. DELTA, ONE PERSON
INFECTS 7, 8, OR MAYBE 9 PEOPLE. IT IS RIDICULOUSLY MORE
TRANSMISSIBLE. WE ARE SEEING DELTA VARIANT BREAKTHROUGH CASES IN
FAIRLY LOW IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAREFUL. PEOPLE WHO HAVE
DONE FAIRLY LOW RISK ACTIVITIES. IT IS A GOOD REMINDER TO ALL OF US,
ALL THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE STILL VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. SOCIAL
DISTANCING, WEARING YOUR MASKS IF YOU ARE INDOORS WITH PEOPLE YOU
DON'T LIVE WITH, IN YOUR HOME WITH OTHER PEOPLE, PUT YOUR MASK ON.
AND IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AS WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE
POLICY IN PLACE.
I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: IT DOES. THANK YOU. I KNOW THE
EFFECTS OF COVID CONTRACTION, IT IS MORE SERIOUS BEING
UNVACCINATED AND MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF
THE BREAKDOWN. WHEN WE SEE A NUMBER OF NEW CASES, 2/3 AMONG
UNVACCINATED PEOPLE. HALF AND HALF WITH BREAKTHROUGH CASES?
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING, I'M NOT SURE IF I HAVE THE ANSWER.
THE STATE JUST RECENTLY TRACKING THE BREAKTHROUGH CASES. WE
DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD WE DIDN'T HAVE IT PARSED OUT. I THINK WE WILL
SOON, BUT NOT AT THE MOMENT. MOST CASES BECAUSE IT IS SO
TRANSMISSIBLE AND THE POPULATION IS HIGHLY VACCINATED, MOST CASES
WE SEE NOW ARE BREAKTHROUGH CASES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THAT'S HELPFUL. IF WE CAN ADD


PAGE 26

Sept 13, 2021

DATA TO THE DASHBOARD, FOLKS WONDER WHAT IS THE RISK LEVEL IF THEY
GO INDOOR, IF THEY ARE UNVACCINATED THAT WILL HELP DRIVE
VACCINATIONS. IF YOU ARE CLEAR A LOT OF CASES COME FROM
UNVACCINATED AND MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS. THE MORE OF THE DATA
WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL? COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS HAS A QUESTION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IT IS GREAT TO SEE, MADAM COMMISSIONER, I
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A WONDERFUL JOB YOU DID THROUGH THE
CARNIVAL WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT. THE
WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING THAT VACCINATION TRUCK WHATEVER. YOU
WANT TO GET PEOPLE TO DO IT AND I'D BE INTERESTED HOW MANY PEOPLE
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT, IT IS ALSO SATURATION OF INFORMATION. THE
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SEE IT. I WANT TO HAVE A BUS IN CENTRAL
SQUARE JUST TO SAY COME AND GET VACCINATED. IN ORDER TO JUST
GENERATE THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT. THEY SEE IT. AND MAYBE SEEING PEOPLE
DO IT. JUST LAST WEEKEND, IT WAS GRANDPARENTS DAY. MAYBE IF WE HAD
GRANDPARENT WALKING THEIR GRANDCHILDREN, AT LEAST THE ONES THAT
WILL GO ANYWHERE WITH THE GRANDPARENTS, TO A VACCINATION SITE.
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. TWO THINGS I WANT TO MENTION AND TO
OUR NEW PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER, WELCOME TO THE FRAY. YOU MAY
WANT TO RETHINK AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS HERE. WHILE YOU ARE
HERE, WE ENJOY AND GLAD YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THIS FOR US.
QUICK QUESTION. I WANT TO KNOW, YOU HAVE OPENED MORE CENTERS
AND I KNOW THERE'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT MAYBE GOING BACK TO THE
CHRISTIAN LIFE CENTER. I WANT TO KNOW, IS THAT IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
OR THE PISANI CENTER. THE NUMBERS ACROSS THE STATE, EXCUSE ME, THEY
ARE BETTER. IT IS STILL LAGGING BEHIND IN TERMS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR.
PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MORE INCLINED TO GO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE THEY LIVE. MY DAUGHTERS AND I TRY TO GO ON MONDAYS NOT
MONDAYS ANYMORE. BUT THURSDAYS, THERE'S A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG
LINE OVER AT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE GALLERIA. THAT'S AFTER YOU WEAR
YOURSELF OUT TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO PARK. I WANT TO KNOW, IS THAT
A PLAN FOR THAT? I WILL PUT ME THREE QUESTIONS OUT THERE.
ONE, IS THERE A PLAN? I KNOW AT LEAST EARLIER ON, THEY CALL IT THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CORPS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT
TEAM, AND MAYBE THIS IS AN ELLEN SEMONOFF QUESTION, I KNOW THE
ENGAGEMENT TEAM HAS DONE EXTRAORDINARY WORK. WE USE THEM FOR
EVERYTHING. I'M JUST ASKING, TO THE CITY MANAGER, WE TALK ABOUT THE
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEAM BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO DO SO
MUCH AND PARTICULARLY HOW MUCH WE WANT THEM TO DO MORE
GETTING THE WORD OUT AROUND THE VACCINATION AND THE VIRUS AND
WE CONSIDER HIRING MORE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS,
PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH LANGUAGE DUAL LANGUAGE ABILITY.
THE LAST QUESTION, THIS CAME UP IN THE SENIOR ADVISORY DISCUSSION. IT
HAS COME UP IN A COUPLE OF PLACES, I THINK THE CITY COUNCIL GOT AN

PAGE 27

Sept 13, 2021

EMAIL. AS WE LOOK ACROSS THE CITY, WE SEE BUILDINGS UNDER
CONSTRUCTION. THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE NOT ALL WEARING
MASKS. AND THEY HAVE BARKED AT A FEW PEOPLE AND SAYING I DON'T LIVE
HERE AND I DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MASK MANDATE. THIS COMES UP
OVER AND OVER AND OVER, PARTICULARLY WHERE THEY ARE UNDER A
MAJOR RENOVATION. I HAVE HEARD IT IN OTHER BUILDINGS AS WELL. I'M
INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT WE CAN DO, DO YOU DO SPOT CHECKS TO
CATCH PEOPLE WALKING AROUND WITH THEIR MASK ON THE ELBOW AND
NOT ON THE FACE AND ISSUE FINES. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING, PARTICULARLY
IN THE BUILDINGS WHERE ARE SENIORS, ELDERS, OR PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE
HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT ARE BARELY COMING OUT OF THE HOMES AS IS.
AND FEELING EVEN MORE A PRISONER IN THEIR OWN HOME BECAUSE
PEOPLE WALK THROUGH THE BUILDING UNMASKED.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL START WITH THE FIRST ONE. WE HAVE FOUR SITES
RIGHT NOW. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION OF A FIFTH. IT WOULD BE IN THIS AREA.
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN STAFF IT OR USE AN
OUTSIDE AGENCY. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION AND HOPEFULLY MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT ON WHAT LOCATION AND WHEN. AS WE CONTINUE TO
MONITOR.
WHAT WE HAVE DONE, INSPECTIONAL SERVICES IS EXCELLENT IN TERMS OF
GOING OUT THERE. THEY WERE OUT THERE LAST WEEKEND AND CHECKING
TO SEE IF PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES. IF THEY ARE NOT, WE TELL
THEM, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE NOT FINED PEOPLE. WE
HAVE BEEN RECEIVING CALLS AND WE SEND SOMEONE OUT IMMEDIATELY TO
ADDRESS THE FACT. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
GET OFF GUARD. WE HAVE AS MUCH DATA OUT THERE. INSPECTIONAL HAS
DONE A GOOD JOB TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF IT AND MAKE PEOPLE AWARE
OF THE FACT IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MASK ON AND CAN
BE FINED. IT IS MORE WORKING WITH THEM AND IF A RESIDENT FEELS
SOMEONE IS NOT WEARING A MASK, LET US KNOW AND WE'LL HAVE
SOMEONE GET OUT THERE QUICKLY.
IN THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEAMS HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL. THEY
CONTINUE TO DO GREAT WORK. IF WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET
MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE, IT IS HARD TO
FILL POSITIONS. I THINK ELLEN CAN RECOGNIZE THAT MORE THAN ANYBODY.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE
WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: COULD IT BE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
TEAM WORKERS, ARE THEY FULL OR PART TIME? THIS MAY BE A MS.
SEMONOFF QUESTION? ARE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOLKS FULL OR
PART TIME?
>> ELLEN SEMONOFF: MOST OF THEM ARE PART TIME. WE HAVE TWO FULL
TIME PEOPLE. WE HAVE ONE AND ONE WE'RE HIRING RIGHT NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I KNOW HAVING THEY SAY DON'T
ASK A QUESTION YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO. I WANTED TO GET IT


PAGE 28

Sept 13, 2021

ON THE RECORD. I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO ANSWER A FULL TIME
POSITION. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT IT FOR FAMILY REASONS, BUT
THERE SHOULD BE AS MANY FULL TIME TO OFFSET THE PART TIME.
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, WHICH WE HAVE KNOWN AND HEARD OVER
AND OVER AGAIN, IT IS A FULL TIME EFFORT. IT REALLY TAKES A LOT OF TIME.
SOMETIMES GOING TO PEOPLE TWO AND THREE TIMES. YOUNG LADY, MS.
GODFREY, I HAD A LONG CONVERSATION AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T
REMEMBER THE FIRST NAME. SHE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ME AROUND
CITIZENS ENGAGEMENT. SHE SAID IT IS NOT JUST ONE AND DONE. IT IS
DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVING THE SAME PEOPLE WITH THE
RELATIONSHIPS GO BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND REALLY WORK ON
THAT RELATIONSHIP THEY BUILT UP. IT GROWS EXPONENTIALLY. I'D LIKE US
TO THINK ABOUT THAT DURING THIS TIME, PARTICULARLY WITH THE VARIANT
AND EVERY OTHER VARIANT THAT SEEMS TO SPIN OFF FROM THAT.
IN ORDER TO REALLY GET AHEAD OF THIS, I FEEL LIKE WE ARE ALWAYS A
LITTLE BEHIND. IT WILL MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY INFORMED, BUT
EXCUSE ME THEY ARE GETTING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. WHERE TO GO,
HOW TO GET THERE AND THOSE THINGS. I WILL YIELD AND GO BACK TO THE
CITY MANAGER FOR THE THIRD QUESTION.
>> CITY MANAGER: I HAVE A TEXT, WE'RE HAVING A MEETING ON THIS
TOMORROW ABOUT HOW WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN USE THE
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEAM IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND MAYBE
MORE PART TIME PEOPLE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEAM AND
DISCUSS HOW WE CAN MAKE IT EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IT IS ALREADY.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. WITH THAT, I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. IF YOU HAVE
QUESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I'LL JUST SAY, ON THE VACCINATION
PIECE, SOME FOLKS HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME...
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: I'M ALL SET.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. THE SCHOOLS HAVE PUT INTO PLACE A POLICY
WHERE FOR NON UNION STAFF, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 18, 2021, ALL NON
UNION STAFF ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW PROOF OF VACCINATION AND AS
MENTIONED, WE ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE UNION CURRENTLY AROUND
VACCINES AND/OR TESTING. THE DETAILS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE SCHOOL
COMMITTEE VOTED IN LATE AUGUST AROUND THAT.
I THINK CITY MANAGER KNOWS WHAT THE COUNCIL WOULD LIKE AND IS
HEARING. IS IMPORTANT TO BE CONSISTENT AND FIGURE OUT A WAY. WE'LL
LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DETAILS AS WE KNOW AS AN URGENT MATTER. I
WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT, AS THERE ARE QUESTIONS ON SCHOOLS AND CITY
AND SO FORTH. WITH THAT, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE WHO HAS
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR GETTING THROUGH THE FIRST MEETING. HOPE
IT WASN'T TOO PAINFUL. BIG SHUTOUT TO DR. DOBBERTEEN AND THE TEAM
AT CPH FOR ALL THEIR WORK WITH SCHOOLS. THE WHOLE TWO YEARS
ALMOST, ESPECIALLY GETTING EVERYBODY BACK INTO SCHOOLS IN PERSON.

CLERK WILSON, ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.

Motion by Councillor
McGovern to Place City
Manager’s Agenda Item #1 on
file

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM TWO.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 2).
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. GREAT TO SEE THIS ON
THE AGENDA. I HOPE WE CAN AUTHORIZE IT TONIGHT. TO PROVIDE EARLY
VOTING FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. WE HAD EARLY VOTING FOR FEDERAL
AND STATE ELECTIONS. I THINK A LOT OF RESIDENTS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM
THE YEARS WE HAD IT. WE TRADITIONALLY DIDN'T HAVE IT FOR MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE CITY GETTING THE WORD OUT
ABOUT HAVING EARLY VOTING THE WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION AND HOW
THE CITY WILL DO THAT VIA MAILERS, THE SIGNS, GETTING THE WORD OUT
TO RESIDENTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF, PLEASE. THANK YOU.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. TANYA FORD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ELECTION
COMMISSION. THROUGH YOU, WE'LL BE DOING PRESS RELEASES AND WORK
WITH THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE. WE SEND OUT A VOTER GUIDE
THAT HAS PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION ALONG WITH A MULTITUDE OF
OTHER THINGS. IN SIGNAGE ALSO.

RELATIVE TO A
RECOMMENDATION FROM
THE BOARD OF ELECTION
COMMISSIONERS FOR THE
CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE
TO AUTHORIZE IN-PERSON
EARLY VOTING FOR THE
NOVEMBER 2, 2021
MUNICIPAL ELECTION, IN
ACCORDANCE WITH
CHAPTER 255 OF THE ACTS
OF 2020, AS AMENDED BY
CHAPTER 5 OF THE ACTS
OF 2021 AND CHAPTER 29
OF THE ACTS OF 2021

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I KNOW WE DO THE HELPFUL SIGNS
FOR ELECTIONS. IT'LL BE INCLUDED ON THE SIGNS?
>> GREAT.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: AWESOME. I WILL YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AROUND THIS? COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. I
ASSUME IT IS TOO LATE TO DO MAIL IN VOTING? NO?
>> WE WILL BE. WE'LL SEND OUT APPLICATIONS THIS WEEK. APPLICATIONS
TO VOTE BY MAIL. TO VOTE EARLY BY MAIL. IT BE SENT OUT TO ALL
REGISTERED VOTERS THIS WEEK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: WE DON'T HAVE TO AUTHORIZE THAT THE
SAME WAY.
>> NO. THE STATE AUTHORIZED THAT. THE TWO ITEMS, LOCATION AND
EARLY VOTING.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GOT IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ONE SECOND, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. EARLY VOTING
BY MAIL AND YOU WILL BE PROVIDING THE POSTAGE FOR THE RETURN
ENVELOPES AS WELL?
>> YES, WE WILL.

>> AND DROPBOXES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AND A NEW STICKER. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> A BRAND NEW STICKER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. TO THE LICENSE COMMISSION, AS
I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU KNOW AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE CAMBRIDGE
HOUSING AUTHORITY, A LOT OF THE SENIOR BUILDINGS ARE UNDER
RECONSTRUCTION AND A LOT OF TENANTS HAVE MOVED INTO DIFFERENT
UNITS IN THE CITY. I HOPE YOU CAN COORDINATE WITH THE HOUSING
AUTHORITY WHERE THE NEW ADDRESSES ARE. MOST OF THE PEOPLE DID
VOTE BY ABSENTEE BALLOTS. SOMEONE AT MILLER RIVER IS NOW AT
WOODROW WILSON. I ASK YOU COORDINATE WITH THE HOUSING
AUTHORITY, WHERE THE TENANTS, MOSTLY SENIORS OR DISABLED, HAVE
RELOCATED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
MUNICIPAL ELECTION. SO, I PUT THAT ON THE RADAR SCREEN. I'D
APPRECIATE THAT.
>> WILL DO. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OTHER QUESTIONS? ONE QUICK QUESTION I HAD WAS
AROUND JUST THE LOCATIONS. I KNOW THERE'S THREE LOCATIONS. I KNOW
IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND PLACES. I KNOW WE HAVE CHOSEN THE
CAMBRIDGE WATER DEPARTMENT, MAIN LIBRARY, VOLUNTEER LIBRARY. ANY
CONSIDERATIONS THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT AT THE END? I'M JUST CURIOUS.
>> BASED ON THE FACT IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND LOCATIONS FOR ONE DAY,
ELECTION DAY, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A LOCATION THAT WILL PROVIDE
ALLOW US TO USE THEM FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK AND DURING THE HOURS WE
PROVIDE. OUR OFFICE WAS CONSIDERED, BUT IT IS TOO SMALL. AND WE
STILL WANT TO PROVIDE SOME DISTANCING. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT
OUR ISSUES HAVE BEEN AND OTHER LOCATIONS HAVE ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES.
WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE STATE TO PROVIDE POLLING LOCATIONS OR EARLY
LOCATIONS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. MS. FORD, GOOD TO SEE YOU. ONE
QUESTION, I WAS REVIEWING THE EARLY VOTING SITES. I WAS WONDERING,
YOU PROBABLY TRIED, I KNOW YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS, SITES AT THE
PORT. I JUST HEARD WHAT YOU SAID, EASY TO GET PEOPLE TO SIGN ON AND
SIGN OUT. IS THIS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE CAN DO. CAN WE SET UP
TEMPORARY SITES. CAN YOU PUT A TENT UP, HEAT IT, COOL IT. IN THOSE
NEIGHBORHOODS. HAVE WE ASKED THE CHURCHES. ARE CHURCHES
TYPICALLY WHAT IS THE WORD INACCESSIBLE? SOMEONE EARLIER SAID,
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY SPOKE ABOUT HOW MANY OF THE SENIOR BUILDINGS,
I THINK SIX OF THEM, ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. TWO ARE POLLING
PLACES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THIS ITEM IS ABOUT THE THE VOTING ONE. THE NEXT

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: CAN WE BRING THAT FORWARD?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES. ON THE MOTION,
ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING FORWARD
AGENDA ITEM THREE. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: BECOME ON MY ROLL... ARE WE LOOKING AT
THAT? THERE'S EARLY VOTING AND ACCESSIBLE VOTING. AND EARLY VOTING
ONLY WORKS AS WELL AS THE ACCESSIBILITY TO IT. THAT COULD BE
INFORMATION, I KNOW YOU WILL BE DOING MAILINGS. I HOPE THEY ARE
MULTILINGUAL. IS THERE A WAY TO
>> WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT. WE SPOKE ABOUT THINGS OF
THAT NATURE. THERE'S OTHER ISSUES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT.
EQUIPMENT, THE TABULATOR AND BALLOTS, IF THEY ARE WET OR DAMPNESS
IN THE AIR, IT CAUSES PROBLEMS. POLL WORKERS, WE TRY TO HAVE A GOOD
TEMPERATURE FOR THEM. WE HAD COMPLAINTS BEFORE. RESIDENTS,
VOTERS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IN VOTING SITUATIONS LIKE THAT. IT IS
SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO IN THE FUTURE. MAYBE SOME SORT OF
TRAILER OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. WE WILL HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING EVENTUALLY. WE HAVE TO TRANSITION OUT OF ALL THE
SCHOOLS.

Councillor Simmons Motion to
Suspend the Rules to bring City
Manager’s Agenda Item #3
forward

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #3
A COMMUNICATION
TRANSMITTED FROM
LOUIS A. DEPASQUALE,
CITY MANAGER,
RELATIVE TO A REQUEST
FROM THE BOARD OF
ELECTION
COMMISSIONERS
RECOMMENDING THE
RELOCATION OF POLLING
SITES FOR THE
NOVEMBER 2, 2021
MUNICIPAL ELECTION.

>> WHY IS THAT?
>> PROTECTION OF THE CHILDREN, PRETTY MUCH. THE SECURITY OF
CHILDREN. IT JUST OPENS UP CHILDREN TO MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY
NEED TO BE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. IT IS INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT. I
KNOW TWO OF THE SCHOOLS, I KNOW WE ALSO VOTE AT I WILL CALL IT BY
PRESIDENT WRONG NAME. THE PEABODY? THANKS SO MUCH. GRAHAM
AND PARKS. I'M AN OLD PERSON, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. THANK YOU.
AND THE MFA WAS A SITE AT ONE POINT. THERE WAS A LOT OF JOY FROM
PEOPLE I HEARD. BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS THAT WENT
THERE. I'M DISAPPOINTED. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
IT. I'M DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THEM MOVING OUT OF THE SCHOOLS. I THINK
IT IS PASSIVE CIVIC EDUCATION. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE GYM TODAY? IT
IS VOTING. GREAT. YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION AND GET YOUNG
PEOPLE ENGAGED. I'M SAD TO SEE US MOVING FROM THAT.
>> I'D LOVE FOR IT TO STAY IN THE SCHOOLS. WHEN I WAS GROWING,
SCHOOLS CLOSED AND THAT'S WHY WE VOTED IN NEW YORK. I'D LOVE TO
SAY THERE, BUT IT IS PRETTY MUCH OUT OF OUR HANDS. THIS YEAR WE
MADE SPECIAL REQUEST TO USE CERTAIN SCHOOLS AND WE WERE ALLOWED
TO DO THAT THROUGH THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE. AND EVENTUALLY, WE'LL
HAVE TO TRANSITION OUT OF THE SCHOOLS ALL TOGETHER. I'M NOT SURE
WHERE WE'LL GO.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: HERE'S A PUBLIC SPACE, IT PROVIDES CIVIC
EDUCATION, IT WAS COMPLETELY UNDER OUR CONTROL, WE'D BE THERE.
AND I HOPE THAT AND I WILL TURN TO MAYOR SIDDIQUI, MAYBE BEFORE THE
END OF THE TERM, WE CAN HAVE A ROUNDTABLE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION TO
GET A SENSE OF I DON'T KNOW THE CONCERNS THAT THE SCHOOL
DEPARTMENT HAS THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT VOTING IN THE SCHOOL IS
PROBLEMATIC. IF THERE IS SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW
>> VOTERS, SOMETIMES THEY HAVE MENTIONED IN THE PAST THEY HAVE
FOUND VOTERS WORKING AROUND IN THE BUILDING. A POLL WORKERS IN
THE RESTROOMS WHERE THE CHILDREN USE. I TELL EVERYBODY TO LET ME
KNOW THE THINGS AS THEY ARE HAPPENING. I CAN ADDRESS THEM. THEY
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY AND MAKE SURE ALL SCHOOLS
HAVE TWO POLICE OFFICERS IN EACH SCHOOL OPPOSED TO ONE, LIKE OTHER
POLLING LOCATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE SECURITY
FOR THE CHILDREN. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE WILL WE GO.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WILL YIELD THE FLOOR. MAYBE IT IS A
DISCUSSION. SOMETHING YOU SAID IN NEW YORK, THE SCHOOLS WERE
CLOSED THAT DAY. I KNOW IT HAS TO BE BARGAINED. NOT SOMETHING WE
CAN DO WILLY NILLY. IF WE HAVE A ROUNDTABLE, TALK ABOUT THE
EFFICACY, WHY IS THE SCHOOL CLOSED TODAY, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
VOTING. REMINDING PEOPLE ABOUT VOTING AND WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE
AND KIDS BEING ENGAGED. GO WITH THE PARENTS AND SO MANY THINGS
WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WE HAVE A
DISCUSSION.
>> I THINK THEY HAD A QUOTA OF HOW MANY DAYS THEY HAVE TO BE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IF I MAY? IT IS A COMPLEX.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT EASY. IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A CONVERSATION AND TEASE OUT THE ISSUES TO KNOW, YOU DON'T
KNOW. THEN I CAN, AS A REPRESENTATIVE, GO TO THE COMMUNITY AND
SAY THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T DO IT OR NOT DONE. I CAN'T SAY BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. I YELLED.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I GUESS WE'RE ON ITEM THREE NOW? I'M
CONFUSED ABOUT THE SCHOOL SITUATION. I REALIZE IT IS OUT OF YOUR
HANDS. I DO WONDER IF WE CAN MOVE THE ELECTIONS TO A WEEKEND.
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY WE CAN FIX THIS. I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT.
CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY WE'RE MOVING OUT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. I
DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FROM THE NATIONAL GUARD, I GUESS, FROM
HIGHER UP, THEY REQUIRE THERE'S A MASK MANDATE WITHIN THEIR
BUILDINGS. WE CAN'T REQUIRE VOTERS TO WEAR MASKS IN A POLLING
LOCATION. WE CAN'T KEEP THEM FROM VOTING IF THEY DON'T HAVE A
MASK. WE CAN'T UTILIZE THE BUILDING. THAT'S ISSUES WITH OTHER
BUILDINGS WE LOOKED INTO IT. SOME OF THE ELDERLY, SENIOR HOUSING,
SOME OF THE PLACES REQUIRE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE UPTICK ABOUT COVID,
THEY REQUIRE THEY MANDATE THESE THINGS AND WE JUST CAN'T WEAR

PAGE 33

Sept 13, 2021

MASKS, ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A MASK
MANDATE, WE CAN'T ENFORCE IT ON ELECTION DAY.
>> WE CANNOT KEEP VOTERS FROM VOTING. WE ASKED THEM, IF THEY
COME WE DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ISSUES LAST YEAR, SOMEONE COMES AND
THEY DON'T HAVE A MASK, WE'LL OFFER IT, BUT WE CANNOT MAKE THEM
MANDATE THEM TO WEAR IT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GOT IT. SAME QUESTION AROUND MOVING
FROM OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND INTO A CHURCH. I DIDN'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND THAT TRADEOFF.
>> SOME OF THE PLACES ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. WE HAVE TO FIND
VIABLE LOCATIONS. ENOUGH SPACE, LIKE I SAID EARLIER, ACCESSIBILITY. IT
MEETS THE STATE REQUIREMENTS AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS. SO, IT IS NOT
THAT EASY TO FIND POLLING PLACE, A BUILDING THAT WILL FIT EVERYTHING
WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY. PLUS, WE WANT TO PROVIDE, FOR INSTANCE THE
CADBURY, WE WERE GOING TO USE IT. LAST YEAR THEY ASKED US NOT TO
BECAUSE OF THE SENIORS. BECAUSE OF COVID.
AND THEIR SAFETY. THIS YEAR, WE FEEL LIKE IT IS TOO SMALL AND TOO SOON
TO RETURN. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS GOING WITH COVID
LEADING INTO THE FALL. WE CAN'T WAIT. BY STATE LAW, WE HAVE TO
CHANGE POLLING LOCATIONS WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME PRIOR TO
ELECTION. WE CAN'T WAIT AND WE MOVE TO A CHURCH OR SCHOOL,
WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE, PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GOT IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: I BELIEVE I PULLED ITEM 3. WE ARE STILL ON 3?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE DID A SUSPENSION TO BRING IT FORWARD. IT IS
BEFORE US. FEEL FREE TO GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. TO THE ELECTION COMMISSIONER, I
DID HAVE A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH THE COMMISSIONER WARD EARLIER.
A CONCERN ABOUT THE WARDS 1, PRECINCT 1, PRECINCT 1 AND 2, IT WAS
PREVIOUSLY KENNEDY LONGFELLOW SCHOOL AND NOW BEING CHANGED TO
THE CHARTER SCHOOL. I'M JUST COMMISSIONER WARD ASSURED ME
THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE THERE. I'M PERPLEXED, I THINK IT IS MOSTLY
CLASSROOM SPACE. NOT GOING TO KENNEDY LONG FELLOW SCHOOL
BECAUSE IT IS A SCHOOL, WE CAN USE THE COMMUNITY CHARTER SCHOOL.
IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. I'M CURIOUS HOW IT WORKS THERE, BUT
NOT AT THE KENNEDY LONGFELLOW. I WANT ASSURANCE, THE TWO
LOCATIONS HAVE A COUPLE OF THOUSAND OF VOTERS, THE TWO LARGE
PRECINCTS, IT SEEMS TO ME BE A SMALL BUILDING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT
NUMBER OF PEOPLE. IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE. THE KENNEDY
LONGFELLOW AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL TO DO THE VOTING THERE.
>> I'M LARRY WARD, I'M AN ELECTION COMMISSIONER CHAIR AT THIS


PAGE 34

Sept 13, 2021

MOMENT. AND NEGOTIATED THE SITE THAT COUNCILLOR TOOMEY IS
SPEAKING OF, WHICH IS THE CAMBRIDGE CHARTER SCHOOL IN EAST
CAMBRIDGE, DIAGONAL FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S A PRIVATE
ENTITY. WE WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM OPPOSED TO IT WASN'T
AVAILABLE FOR US TO USE THE KENNEDY LONGFELLOW SCHOOL.
I WENT TO THE SITE, ALONG WITH OUR DISABILITY OFFICER TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING MET CODE. IT EASILY MET THE CODE AND EASILY CAN USE THE
SITE. ONE THING TO BE MADE AWARE OF, THEY BUILD A BRAND NEW
CAFETERIA, WHICH IS OVER IN EXCESS IN TERMS OF SIZE, WE CAN HAVE TWO
POLING SITES THERE. WE'LL USE THAT FOR 1 1 AND 1 2. WITH PLENTY OF
SPACE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCE, GOING IN AND OUT, PEOPLE NOT HAVING TO
RUN ACROSS EACH OTHER'S PATHS. THEY HAVE BEEN EXEMPLARY IN
HELPING US. IT IS TOUGH SITUATION, AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR POINTED
OUT, IN TERMS OF GETTING POLLING SITES. I WILL ECHO WHAT SHE IS
SAYING. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT INVITES
EVERYBODY TO BE INVOLVED. THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE
THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL IS AND FAMILIAR WITH THE NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S
A NATURAL FIT FOR POLLING SITES. REST ASSURED, 1 1 AND 1 2, IS WELL
TAKEN CARE OF. AMPLE SPACE TO HOLD THE ELECTION. I WILL GIVE A
SHUTOUT TO CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CHARTER SCHOOL FOR WORKING
WITH US AT THIS TIME. DOES THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH
COMMISSIONER WARD TO MAKE A SITE VISIT THERE. I ENCOURAGE THAT THE
ELECTION COMMISSION SENT OUT SEVERAL MAILINGS ABOUT THIS NEW
LOCATION. I LOVE THE CHARTER SCHOOL, I'D SAY PROBABLY 80% OF THE
PEOPLE IN THE VOTING AREA HAVE NEVER VISITED THE CHARTER SCHOOL OR
AWARE OF WHERE IT IS LOCATED. OR THERE'S EVEN A CHARTER SCHOOL
THERE. THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB. IN TERMS OF THE OUTREACH TO MAKE
SURE THE RESIDENTS AND VOTERS KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE LOCATION IS,
TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE VOTING LOCATIONS, I'M CURIOUS TO SEE THE
INSIDE OF THE BUILDING. I HAVE VISITED THE ORIGINAL BUILDING THAT IS
THERE WITH THE CLASSROOMS, I KNOW THAT ONE IS NOT A LARGE OPEN
SPACE. I GUESS THE KIDS WON'T HAVE LUNCH THAT DAY. I WILL BE IN
TOUCH WITH COMMISSIONER WARD TO SITE VISIT. AND I ENCOURAGE
SEVERAL MAILINGS TO THE VOTERS SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT
LOCATION IS. IT IS A GREAT DISTANCE FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE IN 1 1 ON
SECOND STREET OR IN THAT AREA TO GET DOWN TO BENCH STREET. A LOT
OF OUTREACH IS NECESSARY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD, COMMISSIONER.
>> TO SPEAK TO HIS POINT, WE'LL SEND OUT A POSTCARD, WITH A MAP OF
THE POLLING LOCATION AND IT WILL BE IN THE VOTER'S GUIDE IN ADDITION.
THAT GOES TO EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT WITHIN THE CITY. WE ARE DOING
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS, WHICH IS
ANOTHER POINT TO HAVING POLLING PLACES IN SET LOCATIONS SO THEY
DON'T CHANGE ON A REGULAR BASIS. I WAS DOWN THERE WITH THE
DISABILITY OFFICER. THEY HAVE A NEW BUILDING, WHICH I'M HAPPY TO VISIT


PAGE 35

Sept 13, 2021

WITH COUNCILLOR TOOMEY TO SHOW WHERE THE VOTING WILL TAKE PLACE.
IT IS IN THE NEW BUILDING THEY JUST BUILT. AND THE KIDS WILL HAVE
LUNCH IN THE OLD SPACE ON THAT DAY. IT IS ALL WORKED OUT.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: AGAIN, I THINK IT WILL NEED MORE THAN ONE
POSTCARD. PEOPLE NEED TO BE REMINDED, THE FIRST TIME THEY GET THE
CARD, IT IS GOING INTO RECYCLING. THEY ARE USED GOING TO THE LIBRARY
ON SIXTH STREET, IT WILL NEED MORE THAN ONE POSTCARD. I THINK ONE A
WEEK FOR THE LAST MONTH TO THOSE VOTERS IN THE AREA TO MAKE SURE
THEY KNOW IT IS THERE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR HANDS UP. ONE LAST
QUESTION I HAVE, THE POSTINGS AND I KNOW THE GUIDES ARE IN MULTIPLE
LANGUAGE. I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THE LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY OF
THE MATERIALS AND WHAT THAT WILL BE.
>> NORMALLY WE DON'T BECAUSE WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO. JUST AS THE
BALLOTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE SEVERAL LANGUAGES. WE DO OFFER
WE DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF LANGUAGES. SORRY. WE HAVEN'T
BEEN DOING THAT IN THE PAST. IS IT SOMETHING THE COUNCIL WANTS US
TO DO MOVING FORWARD? THE VOTER GUIDE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT IN A POLICY ORDER AROUND
THAT.
>> WE'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO DO WE SEND IT TO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE'S WORK BEING DONE THROUGH THE CITY ON
THE POLICY COUNCIL AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS. I'M SURE THOSE
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE COMING YOUR WAY, IF NOT FOR THIS
ELECTION, DEFINITELY FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS. JUST WANTED TO BRING
THAT UP. IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. I SEE NO OTHER HANDS
UP, WHAT WE CAN DO, DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING THE ORDER IN CITY
MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 2 AND ALSO APPROVING THE RECOMMENDATION
AND PLACING THE MATTER ON FILE FOR CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 3.

City Manager Agenda Items #2
and #3 adopted

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MOVE TO ADOPT.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL SAY THE STICKER FOR THIS YEAR IS
MULTILINGUAL. STAY TUNED FOR THAT EVERYONE. WE ARE MOVING TO
CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR. (READING CITY MANAGER'S
ITEM NUMBER 4). COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES. I KNOW THIS IS A REGULAR PROCESS THAT
ANY MONEY COMING TO THE CITY HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL. I
DON'T QUESTION THAT. WE DO A LOT OF THESE. WE DO HUNDREDS OF
THESE. IT DAWNED ON ME THAT, $10,000 IS NOT AN ISSUE, IT IS HOW MUCH
OTHER MONEY IS GOING TO THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. WHEN I SAY THIS TYPE,
I MEAN ALL THE PROGRAMS AND ALL THE MONEY COMING IN. WHAT IS THE
AMOUNT THAT IS IN THE BUDGET. $10,000 IS SIGNIFICANT FOR MAYBE THIS
PROGRAM, BUT MANY PROGRAMS, IT'S NOT. IN THE PAST, I'VE ASKED, WHAT


PAGE 36

Sept 13, 2021

IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT. I KNOW THE EASY ANSWER WOULD BE LOOK IT UP IN
THE BUDGET. THAT'S NOT EASY.
I SUGGEST TO THE MANAGER TO CONSIDER TO SAY $10,000 OF A TOTAL
BUDGET OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE BIG
PICTURE, NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL STEPS ON THE BUDGET THAT FRANKLY
WE MIGHT ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE SCOPE. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS
ALL PROCESS. PERHAPS IT COULD BE A LEARNING PROCESS BY
UNDERSTANDING MORE FULLY THE BIGGER PICTURE. I JUST THROW THAT
OUT, MR. MANAGER.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT
COUNCILLOR CARLONE IS SAYING. IT MAKES SENSE, IF I HAVE IT RIGHT.
WHEN WE APPROPRIATE SOMETHING TO THE TRAVEL ACCOUNT, WE CAN
THEN SAY, THERE IS ALSO THIS AMOUNT OF TRAVEL IN THE BUDGET. IT
WOULD SHOW WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET, AS WELL AS WHAT THE GRANT IS
ADDED. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: EXACTLY. I ONLY CHOSE THE FIRST ISSUE WHERE I
CAN RAISE THIS. IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE. YES, JUST
A BIGGER PICTURE. I REALIZE IT MAY NEED A TRANSITION TIME. JUST SO WE
MORE FULLY COMPREHEND THE BUDGET. THEN THE $10,000 BECOMES A
BIGGER ISSUE AS FAR AS IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND SUFFICIENT. THAT'S
GREAT. THIS IS THE TOTAL PICTURE IS CLEARER TO US. AND THANK YOU FOR
UNDERSTANDING MY COMPLEX QUESTION.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL BE HAPPY TO TALK TO DAVID, I DON'T WANT TO
PROMISE THIS FOR EVERY ITEM, BUT TO START THE PROCESS TO WORK WITH
DEPARTMENT HEADS TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. IT IS BEST
IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES TO SHOW WHAT IS IN THE ENTIRE BUDGET. THAT
MAKES GREAT SENSE AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO FIGURE SOMETHING
OUT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I YIELD. I SEE NO OTHER
QUESTIONS. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S MOTION,
ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE
ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 7.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 7).
I PULLED THIS AND I TALKED TO THE CITY MANAGER ABOUT THIS. I THINK IT
WOULD MERIT HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION NOW THAT
SCHOOLS ARE LIVE AND OPEN. I KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE SUMMARY,
YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S WORK GOING
TO BE DONE IN THE RECONSTRUCTION PART. I THINK I WOULD REALLY
PREFER IF WE DID ONE MORE ROUND GIVEN THAT SCHOOLS ARE OPEN.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #4
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of a Public
Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
Leadership Scholarship
Program Grant funded from
the State 911 Department in the
amount of $10,000 to the Grant
Fund Emergency
Communications Salaries and
Wages account ($3,500) and to
the Grant Fund Emergency
Communications Travel and
Training account ($6,500)
which will to cover personnel
costs, training fees, and travel
costs for the employee who
receives the scholarship to
attend a designated Leadership
Certification Program

>> CITY MANAGER: I TALKED TO MR. BARR AND WE SEE NO ISSUE WITH
TAKING ANOTHER LOOK.


PAGE 37

Sept 13, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. I CAN PLACE THIS ON FILE. I KNOW
COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S HAND IS UP. ONE SECOND. IF YOU CAN, AS SOON
AS YOU DO IT, LET ME KNOW, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. SORRY I INTERRUPTED. YOU MAY
REMEMBER THAT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS, I RAISED THE ISSUE THAT
THE AMOUNT OF PEDESTRIAN IMPROVEMENTS, CROSSWALKS, MINOR
BICYCLE CROSSINGS, WAS VERY LOW. AND TO ME, WHAT I HEAR WALKING
AND KNOCKING ON DOORS IS THAT WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE PEDESTRIAN
SAFETY MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN WE DO ON THE STREETS I'M SORRY,
THAN FOR CARS. I'M NOT KNOCKING THE TRAFFIC/PARKING DEPARTMENT AT
ALL. I THINK THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN WITH THE BUDGET THEY HAVE. I
THINK WE HAVE TO SERIOUSLY REEXAMINE THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS IN
CERTAIN AREAS. I'M SORRY, I DON'T HAVE THAT LIST IN FRONT OF ME,
WHICH I HAD DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. SOME OF THE FIGURES WERE
$300,000 FOR CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS THAT WERE FOR PEDESTRIANS.
THAT IS JUST TOTALLY INEFFICIENT. AND NOT ADEQUATE. IT IS RELATED TO
THIS AND OTHER STREETS. WE ALL KNOW, WE ALMOST GET A STREET WITH
STREET CONCERN ABOUT RESIDENT EVERY OTHER WEEK. THIS NEEDS TO BE A
GREATER FOCUS WITH A GREATER BUDGET, AT LEAST NEXT YEAR, IF NOT IN
THE SHORT TERM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER HANDS ON THIS, WE'LL
DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING THIS ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #7
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-21,
regarding a report on traffic
calming options in the vicinity
of Pemberton Street and
Fairfield Street.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE GOING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 8.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 8)
I PULLED THIS AS WELL. I THINK MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS AREA AND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS OF KEEN INTEREST TO MANY RESIDENTS AND OF
COURSE THE CITY COUNCIL. I HAD A MEETING WITH DPW AND THE CITY
MANAGER AND IQHQ LATE IN AUGUST, IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS ORDER, I
THINK FOR ME PERSONALLY, BASED ON CONVERSATIONS I HAD, I THINK IT
MERITS SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION. I THINK WHAT WAS ASKED IN THE
POLICY ORDER ITSELF, I THINK WE CAN GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC INTO
CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, I WILL BE I'D LOVE FOR COUNCILLORS TO ASK
QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS, BUT I WILL ASK TO PUT THIS ON THE TABLE
UNTIL WE CAN HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP DISCUSSIONS THAT AND
QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL.
COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU AGAIN. IN URBAN DESIGN YOU
LEARN RULES ABOUT LANDSCAPE AND ONE RULES WAS YOU DON'T PLANT
ANYTHING ON A 43 DEGREE PLANE. I REALIZE THIS IS NEXT TO A WETLAND
AND A POND AND MAYBE THERE'S AN EXCEPTION. IT IS VERY HARD TO GROW
SOMETHING SUCCESSFULLY, THAT'S WHAT LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS TOLD ME,
ON AN ANGLE LIKE THAT. AND THE DIAGRAM CLEARLY SHOWS THAT.
I REALLY WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT BE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS EXPLORED.


PAGE 38

Sept 13, 2021

I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK THE WAY IT'S SHOWN.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. THERE HAD BEEN A
QUESTION GO ME BEING HEARD OVER I DON'T KNOW HOW TO JUDGE
WHETHER
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I THINK WE ARE HEARD IN THE ROOM, BUT NOT
GOING THROUGH ON THE TV. THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD. I WILL KEEP
TALKING UNTIL SOMEONE TELLS ME NOT TO. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON
THIS, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, AS WELL AS THE COUNCIL. WE HEARD SEVERAL IN
PUBLIC COMMENT TALK ABOUT THIS PROJECT. IT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
PART OF THE CITY'S LONG TERM PLANS FOR THAT ENTIRE AREA WHICH HAS
EVOLVED FROM THE WETLANDS TO A DUMP FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTE, TO
INCREDIBLE HOUSING.
I'M VERY GLAD YOU WILL BE PUTTING THIS EITHER ON CHARTER RIGHT OR TO
DISCUSS IT LAY IT ON THE TABLE UNTIL LATER. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. EARLIER TODAY, WE RECEIVED A DOCUMENT
FROM IQHQ WITH NEW DESIGN. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ACCEPT THE REPORT UNTIL WE CAN LOOK
AT IT. I BELIEVE THAT THE PLANS AND IQHQ HAVE WORKED HARD WITH THE
COMMUNITY, COME UP WITH WONDERFUL CHANGES, AND I BELIEVE THAT
THE VISION PUT FORTH BY FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND WILL TRANSFORM THIS
AREA AND IT IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME FOR US TO DO SOMETHING AND MAKE
THAT AREA INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT IS NOW AND
INTEGRATE INTO AN URBAN OASIS OF NOT JUST BEAUTY, BUT ADDRESSING
MANY OF THE ISSUES WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT IN TERMS OF A HEAT ISLAND
EFFECT. I DON'T HAVE TO TALK AT LENGTH. I HOPE WE ADDRESS THOSE. WE
WORK CLOSELY. I LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO HEARING MORE FROM
ALEWIFE STUDY GROUP WHAT THEY THINK SHOULD BE DONE AND FRIENDS
OF JERRY'S POND MENTIONED THEY WILL SEND A DOCUMENT SHOWING
THEIR CALCULATIONS AND SOME OF THE PROCESS S THEY HAVE THEY MAY
GET US TO A POINT WHERE THE CITY DID WORK WITH IQHQ TO REMIND US
THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CITY PROPERTY, WHICH WILL THEN
GENERATE ITS OWN REVENUE IN THE FORM OF TAXES. I HOPE WE DO ALL WE
CAN. WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY IN OTHER AREAS, WHETHER IT IS THE
HARVARD SQUARE KIOSK OR CENTRAL SQUARE, LET'S DO THE SAME IN NORTH
CAMBRIDGE AND SPEND CITY DOLLARS THERE, SHOULD BE SHORT DOLLARS
FOR LONG TERM IMPACT AND POSITIVE BENEFIT FOR THAT COMMUNITY,
WHERE MANY OF US GREW UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO EVERYBODY FOR

PAGE 39

Sept 13, 2021

WORKING ON THIS TREMENDOUS PROJECT. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS TO BE A
GREAT IMPROVEMENT TO THE AREA. OF COURSE, I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY
WORKING ON IT AND MONITORING THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD. MY
QUESTION IS AROUND THE RINDGE AVENUE SITUATION. I KNOW THE REPORT
SAYS THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL NOT REQUIRE FUNDING FROM THE
CITY. IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO RINDGE
AVE, IT SEEMS LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY TO FUND CHANGES AND
POTENTIALLY MAKE IT EVEN BETTER AND EVEN SAFER THAN IT CURRENTLY IS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. IS THAT BEING CONSIDERED?
>> WE HAVE WORKED WITH IQHQ AND IDENTIFYING ALL ISSUES THAT HAVE
BEEN RAISED IN TERMS OF WANTING TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS ALONG RINDGE
AVE. A LOT OF FOCUS HAS BEEN FOR CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS, AND WE
WORK WITH THE TEAM TO INCORPORATE IMPROVEMENTS INTO THE PLAN,
THEY WOULD THEN CONSTRUCT. THERE WOULD BE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE
PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. TO DATE, THE IMPROVEMENTS WE TALK ABOUT IQHQ
LOOKS AT INCORPORATING. TO DATE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN THEY ARE
BEING FUNDED BY IQHQ. AND ONE THING I PUT ON THERE, PEOPLE SPOKE
ABOUT THE OUTREACH WORK THAT IQHQ DONE, WHICH IS GREAT IN
GETTING AHEAD OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THEY SUBMIT IT. WE ARE EARLY
ON IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW. ALL THIS WORK IS LEADING UP
TO SUBMISSIONS TO THE PLANNING BOARD, THROUGH THE REVIEW AND
APPROVAL PROCESS. AND SIMILARLY WITH THE CONSERVATION
COMMISSION.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND DETAILS. AGAIN, THE
TEAM IS REALLY FAR AHEAD IN TERMS OF TRYING TO HAVE AS
COLLABORATIVE A PROCESS LEADING UP TO THE SUBMISSIONS. IT IS AS
COMPLETE A PROJECT AS IT IS. THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE,
PARTICULARLY IN THE CROSSING AND HOW THE DETAILS WILL WORK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WIDENING
THE SIDEWALK AND PUTTING IN BIKE LANES. IS THAT ALL BEING
CONSIDERED?
>> THE FOCUS ON THE IQHQ TEAM IS TO WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING POND.
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN PROPOSALS FROM THE IQHQ TEAM TO RESHAPE
JERRY'S POND. IT IS FOCUSSED ON WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS THAT WE ARE
TRYING TO GET WITH THE PLANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ADVOCATING FOR.
THINKING ABOUT IMPROVING BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCOMMODATION.
ONE PROPOSAL HAD BEEN TO DO PROTECTED BIKE LANES. AND THEN AS WE
LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF HOW DO WE DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN ON RINDGE
AVENUE, IN TIGHT AS SPACE AS POSSIBLE, WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE
SHAPE OF JERRY'S POND TO ADD PAVING IN THE AREA. THIS PROPOSAL,
THERE ARE DETAILED PLANS THAT CAME AGAIN TODAY, FLUSHING IT OUT
AND TO LOOK AT A TWO WAY MULTIUSE PATH LONG RANGE AVE. THAT
WOULD ACCOMMODATE OUTSIDE OF TRAFFIC ON A PROTECTED PATH TWO
WAY BICYCLE TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN ARC CESS. AND A PARALLEL
BOARDWALK AND THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE BOARDWALK THAT WE
CONSTRUCTED AT THE ALEWIFE WETLANDS. IF YOU WANT DO A SLOW WALK

PAGE 40

Sept 13, 2021

THROUGH THE AREA AND ENGAGE WITH THE POND, YOU WOULD CHOOSE
THE BOARDWALK THAT GOES ALONG THE POND. AGAIN, I THINK WE LOOK AT
THE SITE IMPROVEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE SITE AS WELL AS AROUND THE
POND, THE FOCUS IS ON PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND MORE
SPACE FOR BICYCLES AND PEDESTRIANS TO GIVE OPTIONS IN TERMS OF
NAVIGATING THROUGH THE AREA. THE FOCUS IS ON PROVIDING SAFE
SPACES FOR PEOPLE.
THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THE MULTIUSE PATH DISPLACES THE
SIDEWALK?
>> IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO A PROJECT WE DID ON FOLKERSON STREET. DOWN
BY THE SCHOOL. I FORGET THE STREETS. THE SECTION WHERE WE DID A
MULTIUSE PATH. PART OF WHERE THE SIDEWALK AREA IS NOW AND WIDER.
IT IS NOT JUST THE SIDEWALK AREA, IT IS WIDER THAN THAT. IT WOULD
REPLACE THE EXISTING SIDEWALK WITH A MULTIUSE PATH. AND IN ADDITION
TO THAT, THERE IS ADJACENT TEN FOOT WALKWAY THAT IS A BOARDWALK
AREA.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GOT IT. THANK YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO
THE IMPROVEMENTS AND ONGOING PROCESS. I THINK IT IS A LITTLE
CONFUSING TO PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF, AS TO EXACTLY WHAT IS AND
ISN'T HAPPENING. I HOPE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE CITY FUNDING, WE'D CONSIDER
THAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS
BEFORE US. I KNOW, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, YOU HAVE BEEN QUITE A CHAMPION
ON THIS PARTICULAR AREA. IT IS GREAT TO SEE IT COMING TO FRUITION. I
THINK WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. AND
SO IT IS REALLY GOOD TO SEE THAT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER. I HOPE IT WILL
GO FORWARD. SOME THINGS I KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR WORK IS
HOW THERE'S IT LOOKS LIKE AND PLEASE CONFIRM, EXTRAORDINARY
OUTREACH TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, PARTICULARLY JEFFERSON PARK AND
RINDGE TOWERS, YOU HAVE USED INTERNS FROM THE AREA TO GET
ENGAGED THE COMMUNITY. I'M NOT A TOTAL FAN OF SURVEYS ALONE, I
KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SURVEYS. WHAT I'M PLEASED TO SEE,
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE EVENTS. I DON'T USE
PICNIC AS A WORD BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL... IT IS A DEROGATORY TERM IN
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AREAS OF PEOPLE CAN GRILL AND
COMMUNITY GARDENS AND THE ECHO CENTER. I THINK IT IS
EXTRAORDINARY. PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS IS CORRECT, $12 MILLION IN
EXTRAS THAT IS COMING FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT
AND IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC TO HAVE A SENSE OF THAT. THE
EDUCATION CENTER, THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND ITS ACCESSIBILITY. I'D
LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT. ARE THERE SCHOLARSHIPS? I THINK


PAGE 41

Sept 13, 2021

PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. I WON'T SAY A NANOSECOND, BUT IF YOU CAN
GIVE AN OVERVIEW, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT JERRY'S POND, JERRY'S
LANDING SINCE HERE WE ARE NOW, THIS IS WHERE WE ARE GOING. THANK
YOU.
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT JERRY'S POND SINCE MANY YEARS. I
WON'T HAVE AN EXACT DATE THERE. IT HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN
VARIOUS FORUMS. THE IQHQ TEAM HAS DONE SIGNIFICANT OUTREACH, HAS
A NUMBER OF INTERNS THAT IS WORKING ON OUTREACH WITH THE
COMMUNITY, HAS DONE SURVEYS. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PLAN,
YOU WILL FIND A NEW WORD FOR PICNIC, THAT WAS NOT ON MY LIST. I
APPRECIATE THE EDUCATION THERE, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. THE BENEFITS,
THE DETAILS OF WHAT THEY SHOW ON THE PLAN, ARE A LOT OF
BOARDWALKS, ACCESS POINTS, AREAS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE SEATING AND
COMMUNICATE AND HAVE VARIOUS EVENTS AND COOKOUTS. A LOT OF
SEATING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY SPACE.
THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF THE
IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE RINDGE AVE, THE BARD WALKS AND A
COMMUNICAL GARDEN THAT IS LOCATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ANOTHER
PATH FROM JERRY'S POND. ECHO LOGICAL CENTER THEY WORK ON AND THE
SEPARATION OF THAT MOVING FORWARD. THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS FOR ABOUT $500,000 AND JUST
A START BIOMEDICAL CAREER PROGRAM FOR $500,000 AND THE
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE BOARD WALKS, COMMUNITY
GARDEN AND ECOCENTERS. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO THE
COMMUNITY AND TO IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE AND REALLY TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE RESIDENTS REALLY
TRULY BENEFIT FROM THE COMMITMENTS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AS A PART OF THIS AND I DON'T
WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOME
DEMONSTRATION OF THE HISTORY, THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AND THIS IS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE NOW. I THINK THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO GIVE PEOPLE
A SENSE OF WHERE WE COME FROM. THE EARLIER USE. MAYBE IT HAD ALL
THE PROBLEMS THAT CAME. HOW MANY YEARS IT SAT THERE. SOMETHING
THAT TELLS A STORY OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF THERE IS A WAY TO
INCORPORATE WITHOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR ADDING
ADDITIONAL MONEY TO THE PROJECT OR WORST YET, SLOWING IT DOWN,
THAT'S NOT MY INTENTION. I THINK SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE NEWER TO THE
AREA, WHO WILL COME TO THE AREA TO SEE HOW IT IS AND NOT KNOW
WHAT IT WAS, I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL THE STORIES. IF THAT
IS SOMETHING THAT, THROUGH YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER SITTING OVER
THERE IN THE DISTANCE, CAN THINK ABOUT IT MOVING FORWARD. ALONG
THE WALKING OR BIKING PATH WHEREVER YOU FIND IT FITS. WITH A QR
CODE, TAKE YOUR PHONE, POINT IT AND THE STORY IS THERE.
>> IF I CAN MAKE ONE QUICK ADDITION. THERE'S HISTORY IN THE ORDER
GOING BACK TO WHEN IT WAS A CLAY PIT. ONE COMMITMENT THAT THE
DEVELOPMENT TEAM HAS MADE IS TO DO INFORMATIONAL SIGNAGE SO


PAGE 42

Sept 13, 2021

THERE IS MORE HISTORICAL INFORMATIONAL SIGNAGE. THAT'S PART OF
THE PACKAGE. DETAILS ARE NOT WORKED OUT, THE GOAL IS TO DO SIGNAGE
THAT HAS MORE OF THAT HISTORY AND HOW THE AREA HAS EVOLVED.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AGAIN, USING TECHNOLOGY. I
HOPE THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF QR CODE. PEOPLE CAN CLICK ON IT AND
IT GUIDES YOU THROUGH THE PATH. TELLS YOU THE STORY OF THE AREA.
THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK S THIS WOULD BE A BIG
IMPROVEMENT AND IT CAN BE BETTER WITH MORE INPUT. I QUESTION I HAD
IS ABOUT THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF THE SITE. ALL GREAT
IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE EXISTING CONDITIONS. I'M CURIOUS, I THINK IT
WILL BE ONE OF THE LARGER PRIVATELY OWNED PUBLIC OPEN SPACES IN
CAMBRIDGE. WHAT THE PLAN FOR THAT ONGOING MAINTENANCE IS AND I
SEE ON THE AGENDA ITEM IT TALKS COMMITTING TO THE ONGOING
OPERATIONS AND FUNDING. I'M CURIOUS IF THEY WILL CONTRACT OUT FOR
THAT. A PRIVATE COMPANY OR PAYING THE CITY TO HELP DO THAT
ONGOING MAINTENANCE? OR WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE.
>> I HAVE NOT SEEN DETAILS OF THAT. THAT WOULD BE THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THEY WOULD CONTRACT WITH THE
CITY TO DO. THEY HAVE INDICATED THEY ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING
AND THAT IS OFTEN SOMETHING THAT CAN BE FLUSHED OUT MORE
THROUGH THE CONSERVATION COMMISSION PROCESS AND THE PLANNING
BOARD PROCESS. IT WOULD BE A PRIVATE PROPERTY RESPONSIBILITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IQHQ AND I MEAN, THEY
REALLY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO LISTENING AND PROVIDING ALL THE
BENEFITS. SO, IT IS AMAZING. EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING DONE. IT IS
REMARKABLE. I WANT TO SAY THAT OVER AGAIN, IN ADDITION TO THE
PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS, ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS. AND THERE'S
DISCRETION TO THE CITY'S ROLE AND GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THE AREA,
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M ADVOCATING FOR THAT. NOT TO SAY THAT
WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO THIS AND THIS. AND I WANT THE DEVELOPER TO
DO THIS AND THIS. IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT. MORE ABOUT THE CITY'S
INVOLVEMENT. IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM PARTNERSHIP AND
RELATIONSHIP.
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU AS WELL AS FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AS WELL AS
THE COMMUNITY GROUPS. IN TERMS OF THE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
MENTIONING, THE DIFFERENT PUBLIC BENEFITS AND WHATNOT. IQHQ IS
PUTTING FORWARD AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THEY ARE
DOING THIS WITHOUT ASKING FOR ANY UPZONING. NORMALLY, WE GET THE
PACKAGES WHEN A DEVELOPER WANTS SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT
ZONING ALLOWS. THEY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZE. THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO
TRADE FOR SOMETHING MORE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I AGREE,
THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE ON THIS, YOU HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR A LOT OF
YEARS, THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IS GREAT TO CREATE SOMETHING REALLY
WONDERFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

LEADERSHIP, MAYOR SIDDIQUI.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'LL DO A QUICK ROLL CALL VOTE ON
THE TABLE ING THIS FOR NOW.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 11. (READING
CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 11).
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL HAVE A MORE
DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THIS ZONING PETITION AT THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK, TUESDAY, AT 3:30. I HOPE EVERYBODY CAN
ATTEND. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR
PETITION, WHICH WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY AN OP ED PUBLISHED IN THE
CHRONICLE THIS WEEK BY A JUNIOR AT CRLS. AND I WILL READ ONE COUPLE
OF SENTENCES, WHEN I RETURN TO CRLS IN A FEW DAYS, I WANT TO LOOK
FORWARD TO THE NEW YEAR WITH HOPE AND DETERMINATION, WHAT DO I
WANT THE FUTURE, MY GENERATION'S FUTURE TO BE LIKE? CERTAINLY NOT
A WORLD WHERE WE LIVE WITH CONSTANT DISASTER, TRYING TO MAKE A
LIFE WHILE OUR PLANET SHUTTERS AND DICE AROUND US. INSTEAD I SEE A
SOCIETY BUILT ON RECIPROCITY WITH NATURE, GREEN COMMUNITIES AND
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THIS IS NOT SOME IDEALISTIC FEVER DREAM, BUT
A TANGIBLE GOAL USING SPECIFIC POLICIES SUCH AS THIS ZONING PETITION.
SO, THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT INITIATIVE.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #8
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-56,
regarding improvements to
Jerry's Pond and along Rindge
Avenue. PLACED ON THE
TABLE BY MAYOR
SIDDIQUI IN COUNCIL
SEPTEMBER 13, 2021

AND WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF SUPPORT, PARTICULARLY FROM YOUNG
PEOPLE. YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SEE A LOT OF HOPE IN MOVING FORWARD IN
THIS WAY. AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS LARGE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS
WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE EMISSIONS THEY WILL PRODUCE OVER THE LIFETIME
OF THE BUILDING. AND THEN OFFSET THE EMISSIONS THROUGH ENERGY
EFFICIENCY OR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IN THE CITY AS WELL AS
PROVIDING GREEN JOBS AT TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE CITY SO WE CAN
EXTEND MORE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE,
PARTICULAR LY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TOO OFTEN LEFT OUT
OF THE BENEFITS FOR THE INNOVATION ECONOMY.
I BELIEVE THAT THE PLANNING BOARD LIKED A LOT OF THE IDEAS IN THE
PETITION. I THOUGHT WE HAD A REALLY GOOD MEETING. THEY
PARTICULARLY LIKE THE EMBODY EMISSIONS AND ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM FOR THAT. THEY DID RAISE
CONCERNS AS WELL, WHICH ARE IN THE DOCUMENT. AND WE HAD A
PRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH CDD AFTER. AND JUST EXPLORING WAYS WE
CAN MOVE THE POLICY FORWARD AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT GOES IN THE
ZONING, WHAT DOESN'T GO IN THE ZONING, EITHER WAY, WE CAN FIND A
WAY TO MAKE IT WORK. I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING NEXT WEEK AND LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING
TO MAKE THIS POLICY A REALITY. THANK YOU.

(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 12).
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. CAN WE MOVE SUSPENSION TO
BRING FORWARD COMMITTEE REPORT NUMBER FOUR AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. CLERK WILSON?

Motion to Suspend the Ruled to
bring forward Committee
Report #4 with City Manager’s
Agenda #12

>> MR. CLERK: ROLL CALL: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. SO, AS A QUICK SUMMARY, WE
DID HAVE A PLANNING BOARD MEETING ABOUT THIS ORDINANCE AND CDD
OFFERED RECOMMENDATIONS AND MR. ROBERTS IS HERE. THE PLANNING
BOARD VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO RECOMMEND THAT THE COUNCIL ADOPT A
ZONING AMENDMENT TO I WILL READ THIS. PARAGRAPH D, TO ALLOW
HOME BASED ANIMAL CARE AS AN ACCESSORY HOME OCCUPATION
PROVIDED THAT NO MORE THAN ONE ANIMAL PER DAY IS CARED FOR ON THE
PREMISES. RATHER THAN DOING AN ORDINANCE CHANGED LIKE I
PRESENTED, THEY FELT THIS WAS A BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO
PROCEED. AS I SAID AT THE MEETING, I THINK I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE
OVER WITH. IT SHOULD BE A QUICK THING AND WHATEVER IS THE FASTEST
AND BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY IS FINE. IF THIS SEEMS TO BE THE WAY,
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS WE HAVE TO
DO AROUND ADOPTING SUBSTITUTES AND WHATNOT. IF ANYBODY HAS
QUESTIONS OR MR. ROBERTS AND I ARE HERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: QUESTIONS FROM THE BODY?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MOVE TO ADOPTION.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: OKAY. I BELIEVE, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, MR. CLERK,
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE FIRST ADOPT THE ORDER
TO AMEND THE PETITION TO INCORPORATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT
WAS MADE? IS THAT CORRECT, MR. CLERK?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION, TO AMEND THE EXISTING PETITION WITH
THE LANGUAGE THAT IS REFERRED FAVORABLY FROM THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

Motion to amend Petition to
incorporate changes
recommended by Ordinance
Committee

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT
THE ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE BE AMENDED TO
INSERT A NEW ROW, RESIDENTIAL USES REGARDING THE SERVICE OF POST
OPERATIVE CARE FOR A DOG.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO MOVED.
>> MR. CLERK: FOR CLARITY ON THE RECORD. THIS IS TO PASS TO A SECOND
READING, THE PETITION AS AMENDED BY THE COUNCIL.

Motion to pass ordinance to a
second reading as amended

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE NEXT STEP.

ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ALL SET? AND THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
WE ARE MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 14. (READING CITY
MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 14).

Manager, relative to a Planning
Board report on the PostOperative Animal Care zoning
petition, which recommends the
adoption of an alternative
zoning amendment to effect the
proposed change.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS ON
THE MENU. THIS CAME UP WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE WORK AT THE
CLIMATE CRISIS WORKING GROUP AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE REGIONAL
PLANNING WE NEED TO DO IN MANY AREAS. IT IS GOING TO BE USED AS A
MODEL FOR SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT COME OUT OF THAT WORKING
GROUP. HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE DONE BY MAPC? IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN
HOW THE PARTNERSHIP WORKS. I KNOW THERE ARE MANY GROUPS
INVOLVED. AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THIS,
PARTICULARLY IN THE CONCEPT, WITH MORE OF THE WORK TO UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS REGIONAL EFFORTS, WE KNOW IN SO MANY AREAS, PARTICULARLY
CLIMATE, WE NEED TO BE DOING MANY MORE OF THESE KINDS OF
COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS. I'M CURIOUS TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> ALL OF THE WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE BY MAPC. ALL OF THE FUNDING
WILL BE CHANNELLED BACK TO THEM AND THEY WILL BE IF ADDITIONAL
FUNDS ARE NEEDED, THEY WILL WORK ON ADDITIONAL MATCH NEEDS. I JUST
WANT TO POINT OUT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IN
TERMS OF THE SUCCESSFUL VERSION OF THE MODEL, SOME OF THE WORK
COMING OUT OF THIS PROCESS BECAUSE IT STARTED LAST YEAR, THE STATE
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS HAS ASKED
THE TEAM, LED MY MAPC, TO DO THE HEAT MAPPING STATEWIDE. INDEED,
THE REGIONAL COLLABORATION IS WORKING WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. ONE MORE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE
EXTENT OF THE WHAT IS IN THIS REPORT, THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS.
I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW BROAD THE AGENDA WAS?
>> THE RANGE OF TASKS INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM MAPPING URBAN
HEAT ISLANDS AND SOCIAL VULNERABILITY REGIONALLY. SOME THINGS WE
HAD DONE THROUGH THE CAMBRIDGE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT, BUT
LOOKING AT IT MORE AT THE REGIONAL SCALE. RESEARCH ON THE PUBLIC
HEALTH RISKS FROM HEAT. LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICE INTERVENTIONS
AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO OFFSET THOSE. COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT, THAT INCLUDES SURVEYS AND RIGHT NOW VIRTUAL
MEETINGS. POTENTIALLY MINI GRANTS TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS,
TRANSLATION OF MATERIALS INTO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. THERE'S ALSO A
HEAT REGIONAL HEAT PREPAREDNESS COMMITTEE AND JOHN AND NANCY
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH ARE OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO THAT COMMITTEE.
AND THEN ALSO, CULMINATING IN THE PREPARATION OF A REGIONAL HEAT
PREPAREDNESS PLAN, WITH STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE SELECTIVELY
ADOPTED BY MUNICIPALITIES AS APPROPRIATE. THAT'S THE RANGE OF TASKS
THAT ARE UNDER THIS UMBRELLA.

Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of the Municipal
Vulnerability Preparedness

Sept 13, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. AGAIN, AS WE
TALKED IN OUR VARIOUS VENUES OVER THE LAST YEAR, THAT RANGE OF
TASKS IS WHAT WE NEED. THERE'S THE PUBLIC HEALTH ELEMENTS OF THE
INCREASED HEAT. WE SAW IT THIS SUMMER AND WE SEE THE INCREASED
NUMBER OF DAYS. I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD. AND THOSE
ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON
THIS MATTER. WE CAN GO AHEAD AND PLACE DO A ROLL CALL ON THE
APPROPRIATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE APPROPRIATION: (ROLL CALL).

LIKE TO ADD COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AS A COSPONSOR AND INTRODUCE

Sept 13, 2021

AMENDED.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. IF THE CITY CLERK COULD BRING
THE POLICY ORDERS FORWARD, THE COUNCIL CAN THEN SEE THE CHANGES
WHICH WILL BE STAND OUT. THEY ARE IN RED. I HOPE THAT COUNCIL
MEMBERS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THEM. I WILL YIELD THE FLOOR
FOR DISCUSSION. AND WE CAN THEN VOTE THE ORDERS AS AMENDED. I
THINK NUMBER THREE IS FIRST. I'M TRYING TO FIND MY NOTES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: POINT OF INFORMATION. I DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF ME.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: DO WE HAVE THEM TO BRING THEM UP ON THE
SCREEN? IF NOT, CAN I HAVE THEM SENT TO YOU.
>> MR. CLERK: PAPER COPIES SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED. ONE

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I THOUGHT THEY WERE. WE CAN PAUSE TO GIVE
PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN THEM.
>> MR. CLERK: THEY ARE ON THE SCREEN. I WILL ENLARGE THEM AND BRING
THE COPY OVER TO VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: VICE MAYOR MALLON, DO YOU HAVE YOUR COPY
OR ON YOUR SCREEN?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MANY OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE DISCUSSION
MS. NOLAN AND I BROUGHT IT FORWARD. WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND IN A
CLIMATE WHERE FOLKS LOOK TO HOW DO WE MAKE BLACK PEOPLE, IN
PARTICULAR, PEOPLE IN COLOR WHOLE. WE LOOK THROUGH THAT
THROUGH THE LENS OF PAST ATROCITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME
THROUGH CANNABIS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AVENUES. WHAT WE WANT
TO DO IS TO OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO, AS THE CITY, LOOK AT THE
ISSUES, USING VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS. FROM CANNABIS AND A NUMBER
OF WAYS TO HOW DO I SAY REPAIR.
REPAIR THE DAMAGE WITH ALSO A VIEW TOWARDS NOT ONLY REPAIR, BUT
LOOKING FORWARD, WE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISSTEPS. SOME CHANGES
ARE MINOR. THE FIRST WHEREAS, IT SAYS CARRIED OUT AGAINST BLACK AND
BROWN PEOPLE. I WILL PAUSE BECAUSE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY
COLLEAGUES BECAUSE WE SPENT SEVERAL MEETINGS COMBING THROUGH
THE MATERIAL TO HAVE IT AS REPRESENTATIVE AS TO WHAT WE WERE
THINKING AND WHAT YOU ARE THINKING AS WELL HOPEFULLY. IF YOU TURN
TO THE DOCUMENT, I DIDN'T NUMBER THE WHEREAS, THE FOURTH
WHEREAS IN 2019, IT STARTS... ANOTHER MODEST CHANGE, IT JUST SAYS
GRANT. EVERYBODY SEE THAT? I WON'T ACT LIKE A CLASSROOM AND SAY


PAGE 49

Sept 13, 2021

RAISE YOUR HAND. THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. THE FOLLOWING
WHEREAS, THE NATIONAL DEBATE OVER THE CONCEPT OF REPARATIONS AND
YOU WILL SEE IN RED, WE CHANGED THE WORD TO MUNICIPALITIES. AND
THEN FURTHER ON, AT THE END OF THAT WHEREAS, WITH THE
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST ULTIMATELY PLAY
A MUCH LARGER ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE WRONGS. I WILL TAKE YOU
THROUGH AND WE CAN GO BACK AND HAVE A DISCUSSION.
NEXT WHEREAS. THE MODEL, IF YOU LOOK IN THE BODY OF THAT WHEREAS,
THE FIRST CHANGE IS TO LIFT UP LOCAL BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES. WITH
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL CONCURRENT
REPARATIONS PROGRAMS PILOTED IN OUR CITY. NEXT GOES INTO ORDERED.
WE DELETED INTO ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS. AND THAT
WOULD BE THE CHANGES TO THAT PARTICULAR POLICY ORDER. WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO GO EVERY THEM AGAIN. IF NOT, I YIELD THE FLOOR TO MY CO
MAKERS AND TO OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I DON'T KNOW WHOSE HAND WAS UP FIRST. GO
AHEAD, COUNCILLOR NOLAN. AND THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS HAS BEEN BEFORE US A COUPLE
OF TIMES. AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID, WE WORKED THROUGH THE
DISCUSSION OF WHAT THIS IMPLIES AND WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO DO
WITH THE VARIOUS POLICY ORDERS. AND I'M VERY EXCITED. WE'RE
STARTING THIS WORK AND WE MAY WELL PASS THEM TONIGHT AFTER THE
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE LED TO, I THINK, VERY SPECIFIC WORDING THAT
MAKES IT A STRONGER AND BETTER POLICY ORDER.
IT IS PASS TIME TO DISCUSS REPARATIONS AND I HOPE THE CITY CAN BE A
LEADER IN THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SHOW THE WAY
FOR OTHERS. WE KNOW AND WE HAVE SAID IN THE POLICY ORDER SAYS IT
AND DISCUSSIONS ACROSS THE CITY, TRUE REPARATIONS ARE ACHIEVED BY
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN DO A
LOT AND I BELIEVE PERSONALLY, THAT'S WHY I SIGNED ON IT AND
CAMBRIDGE SHOULD BE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
FOR ME, IT CAME FROM READING TWO BOOKS, THE COLOR OF LAW, WHERE
HEAR ABOUT A LOT IN CAMBRIDGE. IT MENTIONS THE HOUSING
DEVELOPMENTS IN CAMBRIDGE THAT HAD DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES
AGAINST WHITE AND BLACK FAMILIES. REPARATIONS, IT IS CALLED, FROM
HERE TO EQUALITY, IT IS A RESOURCE TO THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN
REPAIR THE DAMAGES, THE WORD REPARATIONS IMPLIES. AND CAMBRIDGE
DOES HAVE A LEGACY OF BENEFITTING SLAVERY RIGHT THROUGH ADHERING
THE FEDERAL POLICIES IN THE 1950S. I KNOW MYSELF MANY PEOPLE HAVE
TAKEN ISSUE WITH ME FOR SAYING HOW IS IT I HAVE NO BUSINESS IN
REPARATIONS. IT IS TRUE. MY FAMILY, AS AN IRISH FAMILY, CAME OVER IN
THE 1880S, SO FAR PASSED THE EXPLICIT HORRORS AND EVILS OF THE CIVIL
WAR. THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SLAVERY AND YET BENEFITTED FROM
THE SLAVERY THAT HAPPENED BEFORE. ANYBODY IN MASSACHUSETTS, WE
WERE THE FIRST TO ABOLISH AND THE FIRST TO ENCODE IT IN THE LAW AND

PAGE 50

Sept 13, 2021

BENEFITTED ECONOMICALLY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BRING IT TOGETHER.
BRING IT TO BEAR IN PLAYING THE ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE HARM. MY
FATHER CAN BUY A HOUSE IN THE 1950S BECAUSE HE WAS WHITE. AND HE
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT OTHERWISE. IN THAT SENSE, THIS
REPARATIONS DIRECTLY DOES INFLUENCE AND AFFECT THE BEHAVIORS OF
FAMILIES LIKE MINE THAT CAME TO THIS COUNTRY LONG AFTER THE CIVIL
WAR. IT IS PLAYED OUT EVERY DAY. WE KNOW THAT, BUT I THINK IT IS
IMPORTANT FOR US TO TELL THAT STORY. WHY WE ARE ENGAGED IN THIS
AND I THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR BRINGING TO ME RESOURCES THAT
I READ ABOUT THIS AND INFLUENCE MY THINKING. AND I KNOW THE
COUNCIL, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI, WE HAVE ALL
WORKED ON SOME LEVEL STRUGGLING WITH HOW WE CAN HAVE AN
INFLUENCE ON HAVING OUR CITY BECOME A LEADER IN THIS WORK OF
REPAIRING.
THANK YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO US MOVING FORWARD. THE HARD WORK
ABOUT WHAT WE DO NEXT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IF I CAN MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT BEFORE IT
GOES TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. IN MY PREAMBLE, TWO IMPORTANT
THINGS I FAILED TO MENTION. I SPOKE THIS WAS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT
BETWEEN MYSELF, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
TWO THINGS I THINK I CAN SAY, ONE THING TO SAY WITH A DEGREE OF
ASSURITY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE COUNCIL WOULD STAND
BEHIND. AT SOME POINT, IT SHOULD BE PERHAPS PRESENTED BY THE
WHOLE. I WILL LET THE COUNCIL DECIDE ON THAT.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A BRAVE WOMAN, (UNKNOWN NAME), I MET
WITH HER SO MUCH, I WAS GOING TO TAKE HER TAX DEDUCTION, SHE IS
VERY COMMITTED AND GREAT ENERGY, SHE WORKED WITH COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN AND I TO WORK THIS THROUGH. SHE IS REALLY
REPRESENTATIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT DOESN'T SHOW HERE. I THINK IT IS
IMPORTANT TO SAY, THIS IS NOT JUST FROM THREE CITY COUNCILLORS WITH
SUPPORT OF THE BODY. THIS HAS A COMMUNITY ELEMENT, WHICH WE
ALWAYS LIKE TO DO. WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. REACH OUT TO THE
COMMUNITY AND SAY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS, WHAT IS YOUR INPUT, HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER. SHE IS A
YOUNG WOMAN. SHE IS DRIVEN AND I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
CAN SAY WHAT ORGANIZATION SHE WORKS FOR BECAUSE I DON'T
REMEMBER. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A YOUNG
WOMAN THAT IS PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS THAT REALLY WENT THE DISTANCE
TO WORK ON THIS BODY OF WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. I DON'T
WANT TO TAKE COMPLETE OWNERSHIP OF IT. WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING
HERE AND THE WORK SHE DID TO HELP US BRING THIS BEFORE YOU. THANK
YOU AND I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES,
PARTICULARLY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN, FOR THESE
TWO POLICY ORDERS. AND THE MAYOR AND VICE MAYOR MALLON FOR THE
RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY COMMISSION. TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS'


PAGE 51

Sept 13, 2021

POINT, SHE HAS BEEN A TIRELESS ADVOCATE. SHE WORKS WITH THE
MASSACHUSETTS RECREATIONAL CANNABIS COOPERATIVE. AND SHE IS JUST
BEEN TREMENDOUS IN NOT ONLY MEETING WITH US AND ADVOCATING ON
THIS ISSUE, BUT BRINGING OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS INTO THE
CONVERSATION AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. WE
JUST OWE HER A REAL DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR THAT WORK.
WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THESE THREE POLICY ORDERS, BRING FORWARD
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 13 SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT WHILE WE HAVE
THE SOLICITOR AND STAFF AVAILABLE. I WILL DO THAT AT THE END. I WILL
BRIEF SPEAK ON POLICY ORDER 11, SINCE THAT IS ALSO BEFORE US.
IT IS REGARDING THE RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY COMMISSION. IT CAME
OUT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS TO REALLY MOVE THE
CONVERSATION ON REPARATIONS FORWARD IN CAMBRIDGE. AND WHEN
THE POLICY ORDER CAME FORWARD FROM COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND
COUNCILLOR NOLAN, WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIE THEM
ALL TOGETHER. I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL SUPPORT ALL OF THE ORDERS. AS
WAS SAID, ONCE WE DO THAT, THE REAL WORK BEGINS OF ACTUALLY
CARRYING ON THE CONVERSATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING THE WORK. THANK
YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO OFFER MY THANKS TO
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND
CONVERSATIONS FOR US TO HAVE AND JUST A FOLLOW UP ON THINGS THAT
WERE SAID. I THINK COUNCILLOR NOLAN, YOU ARE CORRECT, WE HEAR A LOT
FROM FOLKS WHO LOOK LIKE US AND HAVE OUR BACKGROUND OF BEING
FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILIES THAT WERE NOT AROUND WHO CAME AFTER
SLAVERY. MY FAMILY DIDN'T OWN SLAVES. AND YET, YOU GO THROUGH
AMERICAN HISTORY, FROM JIM CROW AND VOTER RIGHTS AND THE GI BILL,
WHITE VETERANS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS HOMES AND EDUCATION AND JOBS
AND BLACK VETERANS WERE NOT OFFERED THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. THIS
IS NOT THE REPARATIONS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT WHO DID OR DIDN'T OWN
SLAVES.
IT IS ABOUT A SYSTEMIC AND INTENTIONAL POLICY DECISIONS THAT WERE
MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THAT WERE RACISTS. I LIKE TO SEE THE BIT
ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP AND GENERATIONAL EQUITY BUILDING. YOU TALK
ABOUT THE CITY WILL GIVE SOMEONE $10,000 AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
IS ANSWER OR NOT. I DO THINK WE TALK ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP AND
MAYBE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WORKING WITH BANKS AND OTHERS TO
PROVIDE NO INTEREST LOANS OR DOING DOWN PAYMENTS. IT IS NOT JUST
ABOUT WRITING A CHECK, BUT HOW TO CREATE THAT GENERATIONAL
WEALTH THAT FOLKS WERE DENIED BASED ON RACE. I THANK YOU ALL FOR
WORKING ON THIS AND I'M FULLY BEHIND IT. AS WITH ANYTHING, IT IS
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES RACE. IT IS NOT THE
EASIEST CONVERSATION AND ONE THING I HAVE OFTEN SAID, AND
COUNCILLOR NOLAN MAY REMEMBER THIS FROM OUR SCHOOL COMMITTEE
DAYS, I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES IN CAMBRIDGE WHEN WE


PAGE 52

Sept 13, 2021

TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES, WE LIKE TO THINK WE DON'T HAVE THEM. AND
WE'RE THIS PROGRESSIVE CITY. RACE AND CLASS ARE NOT AN ISSUE AND WE
KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE. WE HAVE TO GET OVER THAT HURDLE TO
ADMITTING EVEN HERE IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC, WE HAVE MAJOR ISSUES
AND STRUCTURAL RACISM, LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE.
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE LEADERSHIP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTARY? HANDS UP? I
DON'T SEE ANY. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE AND SAY I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
THIS WORK AND REALLY APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR LEADING IT
AND ALSO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN WITH THEIR
COLLABORATIVE WORK ON THIS TOPIC.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: JUST POINT OF INQUIRY. ARE WE VOTING ON
POLICY ORDER 13 SEPARATELY OR...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN TAKE THEM SEPARATELY. YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: PLEASE. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I BELIEVE WE HAVE THREE IN FRONT OF US. WE
HAVE ITEM 5, NO CHANGES. IT WAS TABLED AND I OFFER I'M ASKING THAT
IT BE TAKEN UP. I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY MY COLLEAGUE.
AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND I HAVE SIGNED ON TO THAT. NO STRUCTURAL
CHANGES. WE ARE ASKING THAT BE TAKEN UP AND I THINK WE HAVE
NUMBER 11. SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THREE. IF THERE IS NO DISCUSSION,
I OFFER WE ADOPT THAT ON NUMBER FIVE, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, IS THE
LEAD, HE CAN OFFER THAT FROM THE FLOOR. AND I THINK LAST ONE IS 11.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WHAT WE'LL DO, WE HAVE YOUR AMENDMENTS TO
NUMBER THREE. WE'LL GO FORWARD AND ROLL CALL ON THE
AMENDMENTS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FIRST VOTE ON ADOPTING AMENDMENTS TO
CALENDAR ITEM THREE PROPOSED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. ON THE
MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MR. CLERK: NEXT VOTE ON THE ADOPTION OF CALENDAR ITEM THREE AS
AMENDED. UNLESS THERE WAS DISCUSSION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO, YOU CAN PROCEED.
>> MR. CLERK: ADOPTING CALENDAR ITEM THREE AS AMENDED: (ROLL
CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST. NEXT VOTE

ADOPT CALENDAR ITEM #3
AS AMENDED
That the City Manager is
requested to direct the
appropriate City staff to
determine the feasibility of
establishing a pilot reparations
program that would take a tobe-determined percentage of
revenue from local cannabis
sales and distribute these
monies to local Black-owned
businesses and to economic
empowerment applicants.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO CALENDAR ITEM 5. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: VERY BRIEFLY, THIS POLICY ORDER WAS
INTRODUCED IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE TWO ISSUES OF REPARATIONS FOR
SLAVERY AND RESTITUTION FOR THE WAR ON DRUGS. THAT IS LARGELY
BASED ON GUIDANCE FROM ADVOCATES, THEY ARE SEPARATE, BUT RELATED
ISSUES. THAT'S THE GENESIS OF THIS POLICY ORDER. VERY MUCH A

COMPANION TO THE ONE THAT WE JUST VOTED ON. APPRECIATE THE
COUNCIL'S SUPPORT ON THAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION?
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION OF CALENDAR ITEM 5. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO THE POLICY ORDER, WHICH IS BEFORE US
AS WELL. THAT'S POLICY ORDER 11. GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THIS POLICY ORDER IS CALLING
FOR THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION ON RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. AS
WAS SAID BEFORE, WE WORKED WITH COMMUNITY ADVOCATES, LED BY MS.
VAN JAMES, TO SPELL OUT WHAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD LOOK LIKE,
WHAT THE TOPICS IT SHOULD CONSIDER, WHAT THE MEMBERSHIP AND
EXPERTISE THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION ARE AND
WHAT SOME OF THE TOP PRIORITIES WOULD BE OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO.

CALENDAR ITEM #5
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to direct
the appropriate City staff to
establish a restitution program
that would take a to-bedetermined percentage of
revenue from local cannabis
sales and distribute these
monies to current and former
Cambridge residents who have
been harmed by the war on
drugs, with a targeted launch
date of July 2022

THE REQUEST IS FOR THE CITY MANAGER TO INITIATE THE PROCESS OF
PUTTING TOGETHER THIS COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION WOULD THEN
BEGIN THE WORK OF DOING MORE RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT REPARATIONS
AND RESTITUTION WOULD LOOK LIKE IN CAMBRIDGE. THIS WORK IS
MODELLED ON SIMILAR COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES THAT HAVE BEEN
FORMED IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES, INCLUDING ACROSS THE RIVER IN
BOSTON IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THIS IS GROUNDED IN WORK THAT IS
HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT WILL ALLOW CAMBRIDGE TO
PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE CONVERSATION.
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AGREES THAT MOST OF THE MONEY FOR
REPARATIONS WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,
BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES DON'T HAVE A ROLE TO
PLAY. IN PARTICULAR, WE CAN BEGIN TO PILOT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS
AS WELL AS BEGIN TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE'D
OPERATIONALIZE REPARATIONS.
APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS POLICY ORDER AS WELL. AND THANK
YOU AGAIN TO THE MAYOR AND VICE MAYOR MALLON AND COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS FOR THE COSPONSORSHIP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HEARING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT, DO A ROLL
CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION OF POLICY ORDER 11. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU ARE ALL SET WITH
FIVE?

POLICY ORDER #11
That the City Manager is
requested to work with all
relevant City departments, the
City Council, the Black
community, and the general
public in Cambridge to
implement the attached
proposal to establish a
Commission of Racial Justice
and Equity

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WANT TO MOVE SUSPENSION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL DO THAT AND GET RID OF THE CALENDAR FIRST.
GOING TO THE CALENDAR ITEM SIX. THE ORDER TO AMEND THE MUNICIPAL

CODE... (READING CALENDAR ITEM 6).
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THIS IS UP FOR
ORDINATION. THERE'S ONE SMALL AMENDMENT WE SHOULD MAKE TO ADD
THE NUMBERING. CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE RESTRICTED IN WAR AND
INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR DECADES AND THIS EXTENDS IT TO OUR
RESIDENTS. WE STARTED THIS A YEAR AGO AND SINCE THEN SOMERVILLE
AND BOSTON HAVE PASS THE OPTION TO RESTRICT CHEMICAL AGENTS AND
PROJECTILES. WE DISCUSSED THE MECHANISMS OF THE ORDINANCE AND AT
THE MEETING, WE ADDED LANGUAGE TO THE ORDINANCE TO MAKE CLEAR
THAT TEAR GAS IS NOT USED BY CAMBRIDGE POLICE SINCE THE 1970S, WHICH
IS THE SUGGESTION OF COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. IT WAS SENT TO THE
COUNCIL BY UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT. WITH THAT, I'D
LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO THE AMENDMENT TO ADD THE NUMBERING. TO
ADD 2.52.140 IN PLACE OF WHAT IS THE PLACE HOLDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL ON THE AMENDMENT?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

Motion by Councillor
Sobrinho-Wheeler to Amend
Calendar Item #6

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: BEFORE WE ADOPT, FIRST I WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. I KNOW YOU WORKED
HARD AND WE WENT TOE TO TOE A NUMBER OF TIMES. I APPRECIATE AND
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AND THE CAME TO
SOMETHING WE CAN GET BEHIND. HE RESPECTED MY PERSPECTIVE ON IT
AND AS WAS SAID THIS EVENING, I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I DO SUPPORT
THE ORDER BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER WE DON'T KNOW TEN
YEARS, DECADE OR TWO DECADES, WHO MAY SIT IN THE CHAIRS AND HOW
THEY MAY FEEL ABOUT THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS. TO THAT IT IS
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND BY SAYING, TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THE FACT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR A LONG TIME. I
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN THIS TIME WHERE WE HAVE SO MUCH
CONTROVERSY THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT CAMBRIDGE HAS DONE THAT
MAKES US SOMEWHAT EXEMPLARY AMONGST OTHER CITIES AND TOWNS
BECAUSE WE HAD THE FORESIGHT. WE DO RESPECT THE CITIZENRY AND WE
WOULDN'T DO THESE THINGS NOR DO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE ANY OTHER
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR SECURITY FORCE TO DO THE SAME. I THINK THIS IS
IMPORTANT. I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I MOVE TO ORDAIN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ORDINATION: (ROLL CALL). ORDINATION AS AMENDED.
NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

CALENDAR ITEM #6 AS
AMENDED
Order to amend the Municipal
Code of the City of Cambridge
to insert new section
Restricting the Use of Chemical
Crowd Control Agents and
Kinetic Impact Projectiles

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE NOW GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I MOVE SUSPENSION TO BRING
FORWARD POLICY ORDER 13 AND COMMUNICATION FROM OTHER OFFICERS,


PAGE 55

Sept 13, 2021

NUMBER THREE, SO WE CAN HANDLE THOSE WHILE WE HAVE THE STAFF
PRESENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL ALSO PULL THE CITY SOLICITOR IS HERE. I
THINK IT IS COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER REPORTS FROM CITY OFFICERS
NUMBER 1. AND POLICY ORDER NUMBER 4. NOT 4. I'M SORRY. NUMBER 12.
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT? NUMBER 12. I WILL PULL THOSE. EVERYTHING IS
OUT AND TALK ABOUT IT ONE AT A TIME.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION. MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES. (ROLL
CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

Motion to suspend the rules to
bring forward Policy Order #13
& #12 and Communications
and Reports from Other City
Officers

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. WE DID HAVE AN ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING, AS I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ARE AWARE, THE PERIOD
WILL EXPIRE NEXT WEEK. WE DISCUSSED WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT IT
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO USE AN EMERGENCY PROVISION TO ALLOW US
TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IN ONE EVENING.
SO THE COMMUNICATION JUST EXPLAINS BRIEFLY WHAT THE DIFFERENT
AMENDMENTS ARE THAT WE ARE MAKING TO THE ORDINANCE. ESSENTIALLY,
THE FIRST ONE IS TO INCLUDE DELIVERY BUSINESS INTO THE ORDINANCE.
THE SECOND ONE, TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF PREFERENCE FOR
DELIVERY BUSINESSES IN ADDITION TO THE THREE YEARS PROVIDED BY THE
STATE. AND THE THIRD ONE TO EXTEND OUR PREFERENCE PERIOD FOR
ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS FOR RETAIL BUSINESSES BY AN
ADDITIONAL YEAR. AND THEN ALSO ADD IN THE ABILITY FOR OTHER GROUP A
PRIORITY APPLICANTS, SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS TO OPERATE RETAIL
BUSINESSES IN CAMBRIDGE DURING THAT PERIOD. THAT'S A BRIEF
SUMMARY. AT THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE MEETING, I BELIEVE WE
REACHED A BASIC CONSENSUS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PARTICULAR
WAY. I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THAT. AGAIN, WE HAVE
THE SOLICITOR IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING THIS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: A QUICK QUESTION, PERMITTING PREFERENCE
FOR PRIORITY APPLICANTS, I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE WE EXTEND THE
PREFERENCE PERIOD. I JUST WANT TO KNOW MY COLLEAGUE'S THOUGHTS
ON AN ADDITIONAL SENTENCE OR SUCH THAT SAYS WE WOULD REVIEW AND
RENEW. THE REASON I ASK FOR REVIEW AND RENEW, AS THE LAWS
CONTINUE TO CHANGE, WE DO IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SOMETHING
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN HOUSING ORDINANCE I WILL DO THIS
WRONG. SIMILAR TO INCLUSIONARY ZONING WHERE WE PUT IN SOMETHING
THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY REVIEW AND RENEW. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT
WE TELL US, FORCE OURSELVES, AND REMIND US TO REVIEW AND RENEW.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ORDINANCE IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT
WE WANT, HOW WE WANT IT, WHO WE WANT IT, AND ADDING THAT
ADDITIONAL LINE.
MAKE SURE WE DO. I JUST OFFER THAT AS AN ADDITIONAL LINE TO BE


PAGE 56

Sept 13, 2021

ADDED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASURE OF THE SCHOOL
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: OF THE CITY COUNCIL. TOMORROW, MADAM
MAYOR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I DO APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THAT
AMENDMENT. I JUST WONDER IF THE SOLICITOR CAN ADVISE US ON THE
EXACT WORDING THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. I BELIEVE WHAT MY
COLLEAGUE IS SUGGESTING THAT WE SIMPLY ADD A SENTENCE THAT WE'D
REVIEW THE ENTIRE ORDINANCE AGAIN IN ONE YEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I JUST THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. I WILL DEFER.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: I APOLOGIZE, IF I CAN ASK, I DIDN'T FOLLOW WHAT
SECTION YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I HIGHLIGHTED THE SECTION. IT TALKS ABOUT
THE PREFERENCE PERIOD BEING EXTENDED, BUT NOT JUST TO EXTEND IT, BE
SURE WE ARE FOCUSSED AND INTENTIONAL ABOUT MAKING SURE THIS IS
REACHING AND WORKING FOR WHO WE WANT. LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHY. I DIDN'T BRING THIS FORWARD OUT OF COMMITTEE AND PUT IT ON
THE FLOOR TODAY, ONE THING WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IN THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE WAS OUR FEELINGS GO AND I BELIEVE VICE MAYOR MALLON
MENTIONED THIS AS WELL, THE WAY OUR SYSTEM, THE MECHANISMS DO
THEY INHIBIT OR PREVENT PEOPLE FROM MOVING FORWARD IN THE
PROCESS. WE ASKED FOR AND IT WON'T COME BEFORE THIS THE
COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE UNTIL THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE MEETINGS
COME. WE HOPE YOU MAY DO WORK ON IT IN THE MEANTIME.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS EXTENSION, BUT IF IN THAT EXTENSION
PERIOD, WE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY OPERATIONALIZE
WHAT IS IN THE ORDINANCE, WE ARE NOT FULLY GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE.
WHAT WE SAY IS, BY REVIEWING AND RENEWING, WE'LL KNOW THERE ARE
IMPEDIMENTS AND WE CAN ACT ACCORDINGLY TO REMOVE THE OBSTACLES
BECAUSE WE REVIEW AND RENEWING THE ORDINANCE. DOES THAT HELP?
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: I HAVE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. YOU TALK ABOUT
THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OR THE SECOND ONE?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: SPECIFICALLY TO WHERE IT SPEAKS ABOUT
ADDED THREE AND THE OTHER RED LINE. PROVISIONS. I ADD THAT WE
RENEW AND REVIEW. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN SAID THE WHOLE
ORDINANCE, I LOOK AT THAT IN PARTICULAR. I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE IN
THE BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO OPEN UP STORES,
AND RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS, THEY SPEAK TO HOW ENCUMBERING THE
PROCESS IS. IF THAT IS THE CASE, WE WANT TO BE ON TOP OF THAT RIGHT
NOW SO WE CAN REMOVE ANY OBSTACLES. IF WE JUST VOTED WITH NO
PROVISION TO OPEN IT UP, THAT REALLY IS WRITTEN INTO THE LANGUAGE,
WE MAY BE DOING A GOOD THING BY ALLOWING AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. WE
HAVE UNDONE IT BECAUSE WE DON'T REVIEW, HAVE NOT TAKEN AWAY ANY
OBSTACLES THAT MAY BE PRESENT NOT INTENTIONALLY BUT MAY HAVE


PAGE 57

Sept 13, 2021

PUT IN PEOPLE'S WAY. I LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THAT.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: I THINK IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A
VULNERABILITY IN THE ORDINANCE. IT CREATES AN AMBIGUITY. I
UNDERSTAND THE POINT YOU ARE TRYING TO GET AT, I BELIEVE, AND WE
HAVE REPORTED TO THE COUNCIL OR ONE OF THE COMMITTEES RECENTLY
ABOUT THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO TRY TO MAKE MORE
CONTINUED EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD TO ASSIST APPLICANTS IN GETTING
THEIR APPLICATIONS PROCESSED. WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
DELAY S WITH RESPECT TO THE WHOLE PROCESS. FROM GETTING BUILDING
PERMITS, NOT NECESSARILY DELAYS BY THE CANNABIS CONTROL
COMMISSION ITSELF. BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS FOR APPLICANTS IS QUITE
DAUNTING AND TAKING A LONG TIME. WE HAVE SIGNED SEVEN HOST
COMMUNITY AGREEMENTS FOR FACILITIES. AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE A
SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT, AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND, FROM THE
APPLICANTS, TO THEM MOVING FORWARD IN GETTING THE PERMITS. THAT'S
THE EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS WE ARE AWARE OF TO DATE.
WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS, I'M NOT CLEAR
HOW MANY ARE IN THE QUEUE. WE HAD A FEW INQUIRIES, BUT I'M NOT
SURE HOW MANY ARE REALLY READY TO GO. I THINK IF YOU SAY REVIEW AND
RENEW, IT CREATES A LACK OF CERTAINTY THAT COULD BE CHALLENGED AND
WOULDN'T, IN MY OPINION, BE HELPFUL TO APPLICANTS. I THINK WHAT
WOULD BE BETTER, ASK TO HAVE IT REVIEWED IN SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR. IF
APPROPRIATE, TO CONSIDER WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A FURTHER
EXTENSION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVISORY. I
DON'T WANT TO ADD ANY AMBIGUITY, BUT WHAT I THINK I HEARD AND
WHAT I STRONGLY FEEL, IF WE DO HAVE TO HAVE A MECHANISM. NO
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DID WITH THE SMOKING ORDINANCE. IT SHOULD
BE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. NOT ENOUGH TO PUT TOGETHER
SOMETHING... NOT ENOUGH TO ESTABLISH A LAW IF YOU DON'T GO BACK TO
SEE IF IT IS DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO. IF YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE
LANGUAGE SHOULD BE MODIFIED, IT STILL GETS TO THE WHOLE IDEA OF
LOOKING AT IT, THEN I WILL DEFER TO YOUR EXPERTISE ON THIS. IT IS
IMPORTANT FOR ME, AT LEAST FOR ME, WE DO HAVE PROVISION THAT
FORCES US TO LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE
RIGHT REASONS.
AND IN A WAY IT GETS THE INTENDED OUTCOME.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: THANK YOU. I CAN TRY TO SEE IF I CAN ASSISTANT
CITY MANAGER AND I CAN TRY TO QUICKLY LOOK AT THAT NOW AND LET YOU
KNOW.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WILL YIELD WHILE THEY DO THEIR
CONSPIREING.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DID SEND POTENTIAL
LANGUAGE TO THE CLERK THAT MIGHT ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUE'S CONCERN.


PAGE 58

Sept 13, 2021

>> MR. CLERK: TO INSERT AT THE END OF SECTION 5.50.040... THE COUNCIL
SHALL REVIEW THE PROVISION OF THIS ORDINANCE AGAIN NO LATER THAN
SEPTEMBER 1, 2022.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: I THINK THAT WOULD SATISFY THE ALTERNATIVE
APPROACH OF GETTING TO YOUR GOAL OF HAVING IT REVIEWED WITHIN A
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME, BUT NOT CREATING AMBIGUITY IN THE LANGUAGE
OF ORDINANCE TONIGHT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU, SOLICITOR GLOWA.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE IT BEFORE US.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: A QUICK QUESTION. THE REASON WE ARE
GOING FORWARD WITH THIS TONIGHT AND NOT SENDING IT TO A SECOND
REASON IS BECAUSE WE GOT UP AGAINST THE CALENDAR. DO WE WANT TO
CHANGE THAT SHOULD THE DATE BE SEPTEMBER. DOES THAT GIVE US
ENOUGH TIME OR SAY THE REVIEW SHOULD HAPPEN TWO MONTHS SOONER
SO WE HAVE WE'RE NOT UP AGAINST THE CLOCK AGAIN IN A YEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: WOULD THAT BE NO LATER THAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I TOTALLY AGREE. I THINK BY
SAYING SEPTEMBER 1, WE LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM, BUT NOT BEING OVERLY
PRESCRIPTIVE. IT HAS TO BE BY JUNE AND THE COUNCIL IS NOT READY. I
THINK IT WILL GIVE US ENOUGH WIGGLE ROOM ON BOTH ENDS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: OKAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE LANGUAGE IS BEFORE US. IF THERE'S NO OTHER
CHANGES, WE CAN MOVE TO ADOPT THAT LANGUAGE. CLERK?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT. FOR THE RECORD. TO INSERT THE
FOLLOWING WORDS, COUNCIL SHALL REVIEW THIS PROVISION OF THE
ORDINANCE AGAIN, NO LATER THAN SEPTEMBER 1, 2022. ON THE
AMENDMENT, (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. IF THE SOLICITOR WOULD SPEAK
ON THE EMERGENCY PROVISION.

Motion by Councillor
Zondervan to amend section
5.50.040 of Policy Order #13 to
insert at the end “The Council
shall review this provision of
the ordinance again no later
than September 1, 2022”

>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: THANK YOU. BECAUSE ORDINARILY YOU HAVE TO
PASS THIS TO A SECOND READING AND ADVERTISE IT AND IT WOULD TAKE
SOME TIME, IF THE COUNCIL WERE TO VOTE THAT AN EMERGENCY EXISTS
THAT NECESSITATES, GOING THROUGH THE STAGES OF PASSAGE OF THE
LEGISLATION TONIGHT IN ONE SITTING, THEN IT COULD BE MOVED THROUGH
ALL STAGES AND MADE EFFECTIVE TONIGHT. BECAUSE THE CURRENT
PROVISIONS EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 15TH, I BELIEVE 21ST. THANK YOU. THE
21ST. EXCUSE ME. BEFORE TWO WEEKS WOULD PASS AND ENABLE US TO
ADVERTISE AND ACT ON IT AFTER THE APPROPRIATE TIME PERIOD FOR THAT
ADVERTISEMENT.
IF THE COUNCIL WISHES TO PASS IT SOONER AS TO AVOID CREATING ANY
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO AVOID THE PREFERENCE AND TRY TO GET IN
WITH AN APPLICATION AFTER THE 23RD, BUT BEFORE THE PERIOD WOULD


PAGE 59

Sept 13, 2021

ARRIVE FOR ACTION TO PERMISSIBLE, I RECOMMEND THE COUNCIL
DETERMINE THAT AN EMERGENCY EXIST THAT NECESSITATES PASSING IT
THROUGH ALL STAGES OF LEGISLATION TONIGHT. AND UPON THAT FINDING,
THEN THE COUNCIL CAN ORDAIN THE ORDINANCE TONIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND I SEE A HAND
UP. COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE POLICY ORDER THAT IS
BEFORE US INCLUDES THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION, WHICH WAS DRAFTED
BY THE LAW DEPARTMENT. WHEN WE ADOPT THE POLICY ORDER, WE'D BE
DECLARING THE EMERGENCY AND ORDAINING THE ORDINANCE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN SAID. THE ORDERED SECTION OF WHAT WE'D BE
PASSING JUST SAYS IT BE AMENDED. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY AN
EMERGENCY BE DECLARED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LANGUAGE OF THIS
IS IN LINE WITH THE LEGALLY REQUIRED. RECOGNITION OF THE EMERGENCY
IS IN THE WHEREAS, NOT IN THE ORDERED. IF THAT'S FINE, GREAT. I WANT
TO POINT THAT OUT. FOR ME, READING AS A NON LAWYER, I WONDER IF WE
SHOULD HAVE AN ORDERED, CAMBRIDGE DECLARES AN EMERGENCY AND
THE ORDINANCE BEING AMENDED AS FOLLOWS.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: THANK YOU. IT IS NOT 100% CLEAR. I THINK A
WHEREAS CAN BE A DECLARATION. TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL, IT IS A GOOD IDEA
TO INCLUDE THAT AS A SECOND ORDERED OR THE FIRST ORDERED SECTION.
TO RECITE THAT SAME LANGUAGE AS ONE OF THE TWO ORDERS AND THE
SECOND ORDER IS TO ADOPT THE ORDINANCE.
>> MR. CLERK: THERE COULD BE A MOTION TO AMEND THE WHEREAS
PARAGRAPH TO TURN THE WHEREAS INTO AN ORDERED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE MOTION FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WILL VOTE PRESENT OR NO. JUST A
COMMENT I HAVE TO SAY. WE HAVE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THIS CANNABIS
FOR YEARS. TO BE AT THIS POINT HERE TONIGHT, HAVING TO DECLARE AN
EMERGENCY WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC INPUT INTO HOW THIS REGULATION IS
BEING WRITTEN, IT IS JUST ASTOUNDING. I DON'T THINK IN MY 32 YEARS
HAVE SEEN THIS POINT WE HAVE TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY. I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE AT THIS POINT. THE LAST MINUTE WITHOUT ANY
TRANSPARENCY OR PUBLIC INPUT THAT WE'RE VOTING ON THIS. I WANT TO
GET THAT PUBLIC COMMENT OUT THERE. YOU CAN PROCEED WITH THE
VOTE. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. WE DID HAVE AN ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING THAT DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH. AND
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE NOT THE MEETING WAS NOT SCHEDULED IN
TIME FOR US TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WITHOUT THE EMERGENCY
DECLARATION. I WANT TO CLARIFY. I THINK WHAT I HEARD THE SOLICITOR
SAY WAS TO DUPLICATE THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION AS THE FIRST AS AN


PAGE 60

Sept 13, 2021

ADDITIONAL ORDERED. IF WE SIMPLY REPLACE THE WHEREAS WITH AN
ORDERED, THE FLOW DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THE THIRD WHEREAS REFERS TO
THE EMERGENCY. IF WE DO THAT, IT WOULD HOLD TOGETHER BETTER.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: I'M SORRY. YOU ARE SAYING, COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN, THE FINAL WHEREAS WOULD BE DUPLICATED AS AN ORDER AS
WELL? THE SECOND WHEREAS? I CERTAINLY THINK THAT IS FINE. IF THAT IS
THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL, THAT WOULD BE CLEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: ENOUGH TO SAY ORDER THE CITY COUNCIL
DECLARES AN EMERGENCY OR THAT THE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE... IS THAT SUFFICIENT. THAT ONE LINE? AN EMERGENCY
RELATED TO THE CANNABIS ORDINANCE. IF SOLICITOR GLOWA OR THE CLERK
THINK IT IS SUFFICIENT. I CAN SEND THE LANGUAGE TO THE CLERK.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT AN ORDER, IT SHOULD
SAY THE CITY COUNCIL FIND THERE IS AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING THE
HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE OR THE PROPERTY
PURSUANT TO CHAPTER... IT REQUIRES THE PASSAGE OF ALL STAGES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.
>> MR. CLERK: IF YOU CAN SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME.
>> THANK YOU. THAT CITY COUNCIL HEREBY DECLARES THERE'S AN
EMERGENCY, THIS IS THE LAST TWO LINES OF THE SECOND WHEREAS...
THERE IS AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE
PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE OR THEIR PROPERTY PURSUANT TO GENERAL LAWS
CHAPTER 43, SECTION 20, THAT NECESSITATES PASSAGE OF ALL STAGES OF
ORDINATION TODAY. AND THEN FURTHER ORDERED, ET CETERA, PASSING
THE ORDINANCE.
>> MR. CLERK: SORRY. HEALTH AND SAFETY... AND PROPERTY?
>> HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE OR THEIR PROPERTY.
>> OF THE SECOND WHEREAS.
>> PURSUANT TO GENERAL LAWS CHAPTER 43, SECTION 20.
>> NECESSITATES THE PASSAGE THROUGH ALL STAGES OF ORDINATION
TODAY.
>> ON THIS DAY.

Motion to amend Policy Order
#13 to insert a new first

communicating information
from the School Committee

Sept 13, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER 12. IT IS BEFORE US. THIS IS
WRITTEN IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR SUMMARY ARGUMENT TO
SUPPORT A PROPOSED CHARTER AMENDMENT. (READING POLICY ORDER 12).
WE HAVE THE COMMUNICATION RECEIVED FROM THE CITY CLERK. BOTH
ITEMS ARE BEFORE US. WE CAN HAVE THE SOLICITOR AND THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR HERE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE DEALT WITH SOMETHING
LIKE THIS. YOU CAN TELL US IF THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. THE
WRONG WAY TO DO IT OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN.
>> SO, THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE RESOLUTION REQUESTING
CHARTER AMENDMENTS. THERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS. BASED ON THE
CAMBRIDGE CHARTER. WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO A MAILING. IT WILL
INCLUDE A SUMMARY AS PROVIDED BY THE CITY SOLICITOR AND ARGUMENTS
FOR AND AGAINST EACH QUESTION.
I BELIEVE WE ARE DOING THIS CORRECTLY. WE JUST NEED THE ARGUMENTS
SO WE CAN PROVIDE THE MAILING TO ALL REGISTERED VOTERS. AND TO OUR
VENDORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING PRINTED AND
MAILED OUT.
>> STATUTE REQUIRES THE SUMMARY TO BE PREPARED BY THE SOLICITOR
AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PROPONENTS OF THE AMENDMENTS TO
SUBMIT A SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR AND PROVIDES AN EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY TO OPPONENTS OF THE MEASURE TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY
OF ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE MEASURE. IF THERE ARE ANY COUNCILLORS
WHO WISH TO JOIN IN EITHER SUCH COMMUNICATION, THIS IS THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.
I KNOW THAT THERE IS A POLICY ORDER, SUBMITTED I BELIEVE BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND YOURSELF, TO HAVE THE COUNCIL VOTE TO
DELEGATE THE WRITING A SUMMARY IN FAVOR OF THE BALLOT QUESTION
ON BEHALF OF THE FULL COUNCIL. THAT WOULD BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE
IF THAT IS THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL. IF THERE ARE NO COUNCILLORS WHO
ARE OPPOSED, THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST IT.
EITHER THE LAW DEPARTMENT AND/OR THE ELECTION STAFF CAN PREPARE A
SIMPLE DESCRIPTION WHAT MEANS TO BE OPPOSED TO IT BUT WITHOUT
ENDORSING IT TO OUR POSITION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE. MOVE TO QUESTIONS.
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO ASK THAT
QUESTION GO WHAT IF NOBODY WRITES AN OPPOSED VIEW. I'M IN FAVOR. I
THINK TO BE TRANSPARENT AND FAIR, SOMEONE SHOULD THERE SHOULD
BE ANOTHER SIDE OF IT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE INFORMATION. IT IS NOT A
GREAT PRECEDENT THAT WE ONLY WRITE WHAT WE WANT AND DON'T
ALLOW ANOTHER OPINION. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TO SIMILARLY A
POLICY ORDER TO DIRECT THEM TO DO THE POSITIVE SIDE, I DON'T KNOW IF
WE HAVE TO DIRECT THEM TO DO THE OPPOSITION SIDE. I DO SUPPORT THIS.
I WOULDN'T WRITE THE OPPOSITION SIDE. I THINK SOMETHING SHOULD BE
THERE SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE CHOICE IS.

>> I THINK WE ARE HAPPY TO DO SO AS A STATEMENT OF WHAT IT WOULD
MEAN. WITHOUT ADVOCATING THAT'S THE POSITION OF THE ELECTION
COMMISSION OR THE CITY SOLICITOR'S OFFICE.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I CAN DELEGATE THE WRITING TO
SUPPORT. ALL THE COUNCILLORS WILL BE LISTED ON THE MAILING.
>> THAT WOULD BE MY ASSUMPTION. IF THAT IS WHAT THE WILL OF THE
COUNCIL TO DELEGATE THAT, I ASSUME THE MEMBERS WHO VOTED IN
FAVOR OF THAT WOULD ALSO ASK TO HAVE THEIR NAMES LISTED ON THE
COMMUNICATION SUBMITTED BY THE MAYOR AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M EXCITED WE'RE HERE. JUST CONFIRMING WHAT
THE SOLICITOR AND ELECTION COMMISSIONER DIRECTOR SAID, THE LAW
THAT CAMBRIDGE PASSED 20 YEARS AGO SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THIS FOR
ANOTHER BALLOT QUESTION DOES SAY AT THE END IF NO ARGUMENT IS
RECEIVED BY SAID ELECTION COMMISSION WITHIN THE TIME ALLOWED SAID
ELECTION COMMISSION SHALL PREPARE SUCH ARGUMENT. IT ANTICIPATES,
IF THAT IS A NO/YES. IT IS DELEGATED TO THE ELECTION COMMISSION ON
THIS. BECAUSE OF THAT, IT SAYS THE SUMMARY IS PREPARED. IN THIS CASE,
IT WAS PREPARED BY THE CITY SOLICITOR. IT JUST MEANS THE SELECTION
COMMISSION DELEGATED TO THE CITY SOLICITOR. I THINK THAT TAKES
PRECEDENCE SINCE THE LAW IS ENACTED PASS THE OTHER LAW THAT
DELEGATES. THE SUMMARY IS PREPARED. IT IS BEFORE US.
I HAVE A QUESTION ON IT, THE ACTUAL AMENDMENT. YOU HAVE THE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AMENDMENT, BUT THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE THAT
WILL CHANGE THE CHARTER, WHERE DOES THAT APPEAR?
>> PERHAPS MS. FORD CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. MY UNDERSTANDING
IS IT WILL APPEAR ON THE BALLOT. ON THE BALLOT.
>> THE MAILING INCLUDES IT IS ACCORDING TO THE CITY CHARTER. THE
MAILING WILL INCLUDE THE SUMMARIES, THE QUESTIONS, NOT INCLUDE
NAMES OF THE CITY COUNCIL WHERE PRESCRIBED BY LAW AS TO WHAT WE
PUT IN THE MAILINGS. WE'LL HAVE THE SUMMARY. THE FOR AND AGAINST
AND THE QUESTIONS. THAT'S IT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY. MY CONCERN IS THAT DOESN'T SAY THAT
THE AMENDMENT WOULD BE BEFORE THE VOTERS. THE SUMMARY AND THE
QUESTION THE QUESTION, FOR INSTANCE, SAYS SHOULD AMENDMENTS TO
THE CITY PLANNING BE MADE... THE SUMMARY DOESN'T SAY THE WORDING,
WHICH IS TO INSERT A NEW PROVISION. IT SAYS ANNUAL Y... (READING
FROM THE DOCUMENT). WILL THAT ACTUALLY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
VOTERS KNOW THE LANGUAGE THEY VOTE ON THAT WILL CHANGE THE
CHARTER. I MAKE SURE THAT IS PART OF THE PACKAGE SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO INCLUDE IT IN THE SUMMARY.
>> SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL, WHICH WAS CREATED AND ESTABLISHED
BY CITY SOLICITOR. THE QUESTIONS


PAGE 64

Sept 13, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: WHEN YOU SAY QUESTIONS...
>> IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE BODY YOU HAVE HERE. BALLOT QUESTIONS,
SUMMARY, AND ARGUMENTS. THAT'S THE MAILING.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT MEANS WE DON'T SEND TO VOTERS WHAT
THEY ARE VOTING ON. THEY ARE VOTING ON LANGUAGE TO CHANGE THE
CHARTER. WHAT THEY ARE VOTING, IF YOU VOTE YES, FOR QUESTION ONE,
THERE'S A PARAGRAPH THAT WILL BE ADDED TO THE CHARTER. YES FOR
QUESTION TWO, A SENTENCE ADDED. IF YOU VOTE YES, TO QUESTION
THREE, YOU HAVE THREE SENTENCES. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT
THEY ARE VOTING ON.
>> THE SUMMARY SHOULD EXPLAIN WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SHOULD WE PAINT CITY HALL, YES OR NO. THERE'S
A WHOLE PARAGRAPH ABOUT HOW IT IS A RAINBOW PAINTING. WE'RE NOT
GIVING THE VOTERS WHAT THEY ARE VOTING ON. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT
HAPPENS. WE ARE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE VOTERS ARE ASKED TO
ANSWER A QUESTION SHOULD THIS BE CHANGED. IF I WAS A VOTER, I
WOULD SAY WHAT LANGUAGE IS BEING CHANGED. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME. I
WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND MAKE SURE. I KNOW IT IS CONFUSING.
>> IT IS NOT. AS I SAID, IT WILL BE SUMMARY OF THE QUESTIONS, THE
BALLOT QUESTIONS, AND THE ARGUMENTS. THAT'S IT.
>> THE BALLOT QUESTIONS?
>> THE THREE QUESTIONS IN THE CITY COUNCIL'S RESOLUTION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: VERY END. SHOULD AMENDMENTS OF THE CITY
CHARTER BE MADE... IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE OF WHAT WE
VOTE ON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOLICITOR?
>> I SUGGEST THE LAW DEPARTMENT CONFER WITH THE ELECTION
COMMISSION. I UNDERSTOOD THE ACTUAL AMENDMENTS TO THE CHARTER
WOULD BE ON THE BALLOT. I THOUGHT WE HAD REVIEWED THAT. I MUST
BE MISTAKEN. I THINK WE NEED TO REVIEW AND MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE
SAME PAGE. IT IS CERTAINLY THE ELECTION COMMISSION'S JOB TO CARRY
THE FUNCTIONS OUT. I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS A GOOD POINT. I
UNDERSTAND THE POSITION THAT THE COMPLETE AMENDMENT...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. AS FAR AS THE PURPOSE TO VOTE ON, THE
ISSUES STILL STAND. WE WANT TO WRITE SOME PRO ARGUMENTS. WE'LL
GET THAT POWER TO DO THAT. ONE QUESTION I HAD WAS WILL THE
COUNCIL SEE THE LANGUAGE THAT THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE NOW WRITES IN
OPPOSITION BEFORE IT GETS SENT IN THE MAIL?
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: THE ELECTION COMMISSION WILL WRITE THE
OPPOSITION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: EXCUSE ME.
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: ABSOLUTELY. I DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY IT NEEDS

PAGE 65

Sept 13, 2021

TO BE DONE. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE QUICKLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT QUESTION. AM I PULLING AN ALL NIGHTER TO DO
THIS. WE'LL TRY TO GET ONCE IT PASSES TONIGHT, WE'LL TRY TO GET IN
LANGUAGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE JUST WANT TO KNOW A HARD
DEADLINE.
>> SEPTEMBER 20TH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TODAY IS SEPTEMBER 13TH. WE HAVE OUR MARCHING
ORDERS ON THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M GLAD I BELIEVE THE CITY SOLICITOR
UNDERSTANDS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR THE VOTERS TO ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE VOTING ON, WHICH IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACTUAL
CHARTER CHANGES NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNICATION TO THE
VOTERS. UNDERSTANDING THAT, I THINK WE HAVE COMMUNICATED THAT.
THAT IS A GIVEN AND NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH
YOU ON PULLING AN ALL NIGHTER TO GET THIS DONE. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO.
AND ALL THE CITY COUNCILLORS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WHO WANT TO JOIN US.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: LET US KNOW.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO ASK IF IT
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO HAVE ANOTHER COUNCILLORS HELP YOU AND
REVIEW THE LANGUAGE. I DO WORRY GO THE OPEN MEETING LAW. MAYBE
IT CAN BE UP TO FOUR. TWO IN ADDITION TO YOURSELF AND COUNCILLOR
NOLAN. I'M NOT NECESSARILY VOLUNTEERING, IF THERE ARE TWO OTHER
COUNCILLORS WHO WANT TO HELP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN ADD THAT TO THE POLICY ORDER?
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: AS LONG AS IT IS NOT MORE THAN TWO ADDITIONAL
PEOPLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYTHING ELSE? YOU WILL GET BACK TO US ABOUT
THIS ISSUE THAT COUNCILLOR NOLAN HAS RAISED?
>> SOLICITOR GLOWA: EITHER I WILL OR THE ELECTION COMMISSION WILL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. CURRENTLY THIS ORDER HAS MYSELF,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. WOULD I'M SORRY,
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. ANYBODY LIKE TO BE ADDED? VICE
MAYOR MALLON. I LOOKED AT VICE MAYOR MALLON. AND WE CAN ADD
ONE MORE PERSON. WE'LL ADD COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. ON THE MOTION
TO ADD VICE MAYOR MALLON AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN TO THE POLICY
ORDER.

CONGRATULATIONS TO CHRISTINE ELOW BEING NAMED ACTIVE

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M JUST PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO
OFFER THIS RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING COMMISSIONER ELOW.
CAMBRIDGE AS WE HAVE STOOD AND SAID WE ARE PROGRESSIVE,
PROACTIVE COMMUNITY, HOWEVER IT HAS TAKEN US TO APPOINT A WOMAN
AS COMMISSIONER. I THINK IT IS A MOMENT WE SHOULD STAND UP AND
REALIZE. COMMISSIONER ELOW IS HOME GROWN, AND I WEAR A CAP THAT
SAYS CAMBRIDGE IS MY HOMETOWN. AND THAT SPEAKS QUITE WELL OF
CHRISTINE ELOW. IT IS HER HOMETOWN, WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL, ON TO
COLLEGE, AND SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES, COME BACK TO SERVE IN
CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT. SHE SERVES WITH HONOR AND
DISTINCTION. IT IS A PROUD MOMENT IN CAMBRIDGE THAT WE APPOINT
CHRISTINE ELOW AS THE COMMISSIONER OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND I
WISH HER ALL THE BEST IN HER SERVICE TO THE CITY. THANK YOU.

Michael S. Medeiros.

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WANT TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS TO
COMMISSIONER ELOW. ONE THING I HAVE APPRECIATED IS THAT HER LEVEL
OF COMPASSION AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH AND TALK WITH
ANYBODY WHO COMES HER WAY. I THINK THAT LEVEL AS WE TALK ABOUT
LOOKING AT OUR POLICE FORCE, LOOKING AT POLICING, PUBLIC SAFETY IN
GENERAL. THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS GOING ON ABOUT THAT. ALL
OF THAT WOULD BE... WOULD BE FOR NOT IN A LOT OF WAYS IF WE DIDN'T
HAVE A POLICE COMMISSIONER WHO EMBODIES THAT. I THINK WE HAD
THAT IN COMMISSIONER BARD, WHO WAS A REFORMER AND I THINK WE
HAVE THAT WITH COMMISSIONER ELOW AS WELL. VERY EXCITED. I HAVE
KNOWN HER VERY, VERY LONG TIME. AND I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER
PERSON TO BE AT THE HELM FOR OUR CITY. THANK YOU.

RESOLUTION #14
Thanks to Ann and Taft
Murray for their hard work

AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONGRATULATE
COMMISSIONER ELOW YESTERDAY AT THE CARNIVAL. IT WAS REALLY A
DOUBLE CONGRATULATIONS. ONE ON HER APPOINTMENT AND TWO ON THE
CARNIVAL ITSELF, WHICH I THOUGHT WENT OFF TREMENDOUSLY WELL. I
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER ON THE IMPORTANT REFORMS
THAT WE NEED TO ENACT IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.

COMMISSIONER ELOW BE THE COMMISSIONER. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON
THE RESOLUTION AS AMENDED.

CONGRATULATIONS TO PALOMA, IMOGEN, AND LETTIE. (READING THE
RESOLUTION).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. JUST A QUICK NOTE. IT IS JUST NOT
THAT USUAL, JUST LIKE A PRIOR ONE WE PASSED ABOUT AN OLYMPIC MEDAL.
THEY ARE THREE CAMBRIDGE WOMEN, WHO WENT TO INTERNATIONAL
ROWING CHAMPIONSHIPS AND CAME AWAY WITH GOLD MEDALS. IT IS THE
KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS OFTEN IN CAMBRIDGE AND WE SOMETIMES
DON'T HEAR ABOUT AND CELEBRATE. I WANT TO LIFT UP WHEN WE ARE IN
THIS TIME WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE INVOLVED

IN SPORTS ACROSS THE CITY AND THE WORLD. THEY ARE THREE OF THE OWN
HOME GROWN WHO DID STELLAR ON THE WORLD STAGE. I KNOW THE CITY
COUNCIL IS CELEBRATING EVENTS LIKE THIS AND SO IMPORTANT WE DO
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OTHER NEWS THAT IS NOT SO GREAT. I WANT
TO MAKE A SPECIAL STATEMENT ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU.

ROLL CALL ON THE RESOLUTION.

>> MR. CLERK: AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 2. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 2).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I OFFER THIS POLICY ORDER AS WE
HAVE JUST SEEN FOR VERY GOOD REASON AND VERY WELL DESERVED, WE
PUT IN A POLICY ORDER AND VOTED TO PUT IN AN ORDER FOR A DEDICATION,
WHICH WE OFTEN DO. IT IS VERY FITTING. WE ALSO KNOW SEVERAL YEARS
AGO, WE CHANGED THE PROCESS SO THAT IT WOULDN'T JUST HAPPEN BY
POLICY ORDER. IT GOES TO A COMMITTEE. AND SOMETIMES THE


PAGE 70

POLICY ORDER #1
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
That the Executive Assistant to
the City Council confer with
the Dedication Committee to
consider the request for a street
corner dedication at the corner
of 159 Lakeview Avenue at
Huron Avenue in honor of
John and Carol Donaghy

Sept 13, 2021

COMMITTEE DOES NOT APPROVE THE DEDICATION. WHAT HAPPENS IS I
ASSUME A DEDICATION WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE A POLICY ORDER WENT IN.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IT GOES THROUGH DEDICATION. WHEN IS IT
RENDERED AND VOTED, IT GOES TO A DEDICATION COMMITTEE THAT WILL
MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT HAPPENS, IT MAY BE DENIED AND OTHER POLICY ORDERS ASKING FOR
DEDICATION COMES THROUGH AND EVERYBODY ASSUMES THEY WILL GET IT.
WHAT WE LOOK TO DO, ALLOW PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT A POLICY ORDER
DOES NOT MEAN THERE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE A DEDICATION. WE WANT THE
COUNCIL WEB PAGE TO SAY THIS IS HOW YOU CAN GO ABOUT GETTING OR
HAVING A DEDICATION. AND ALSO ADD THAT IT IS UP TO AN INDEPENDENT
COMMITTEE TO DECIDE. I BELIEVE IT IS BEGINNING TO START A BIT OF
CONTROVERSY WHEN AN ORDER COMES IN ASKING FOR A DEDICATION.
AFTER ONE IS DENIED BY THE COMMITTEE. WE NEED CLARITY ON THE
WEBSITE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I COMPLETELY AGREE. I WON'T ADD
AMENDMENTS TO THIS. I WILL WORK WITH COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I
AGREE, IT WAS BEFORE MY TIME, THINGS WERE UNWIELDY WITH THE
DEDICATION AND WE NEEDED TO ADD CRITERIA. I THINK IT IS TIME TO LOOK
AT THAT AGAIN. I FILED A DEDICATION. THIS IS NOT ON THE DEDICATION
COMMITTEE AT ALL. THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY ARE ASKED TO DO AND
NOT ABOUT THEM. I HAVE A GENTLEMAN THAT LIVED ON A STREET FOR 70
PLUS YEARS, SORT OF THE MAYOR OF THE STREET, VERY IMPORTANT TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND STREET. AND IT WAS DENIED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING HE WAS A VETERAN AND IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY.
BUT DIDN'T START A MAJOR PROGRAM OR REVOLUTION OR SOME REALLY
WASN'T IN THE NEWSPAPER. HE GOT DENIED, EVEN THOUGH HE IS THE TYPE
OF GUY WE SHOULD WANT TO HONOR BECAUSE HE MEANT A LOT LOCALLY. I
WILL WORK WITH COUNCILLOR SIMMONS TO BRING SOMETHING IN. TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK IN GOVERNMENT WHAT IS THE CRITERIA AND MAKE IT
SLIGHTLY MORE FLEXIBLE SO SOME ARE APPROVED. GETTING THIS
INFORMATION OUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. WE CAN DO A
ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER THREE. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 3).

POLICY ORDER #2
That the City Manager is
requested to direct the
appropriate City staff to create
a new section on the City
Council’s webpage devoted to
clearly outlining the various
steps of the dedication request
process.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THIS PARTICULAR POLICY ORDER IS
REALLY SPEAKING TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POLICY ORDER PROCEDURE
GOES UNCHECKED. AS YOU HEARD FROM DENISE HAYNES WHO LIVED ON
PUTNAM AVENUE FOR OVER 50 YEARS. I THINK THE FAMILY HAD THE
PROPERTY IN THEIR CUSTODY AND CONTROL LONGER THAN THAT. WHAT SHE
BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PART OF A
CAR SHARE PROGRAM THAT HAS IN EXCESS OF 12 CARS THAT HE PARKS
LEGALLY ON THE STREET, WITH A VISITOR'S PERMIT. WE INQUIRED ABOUT IT,


PAGE 71

Sept 13, 2021

THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAYS THIS PERSON CANNOT. LET'S PICTURE THIS.
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE'S 12 CARS. NOBODY NO ONE CAN DRIVE 12
CARS AT ONE TIME AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S 12 FAMILY MEMBERS. WHAT
HAPPENS IS, THIS PERSON IS RUNNING AN ENTERPRISE. WE UNDERWRITE IT
IN SOME SMALL WAY. THIS REALLY CAME TO A CRISIS POINT WHEN MS.
HAYNES, WHO RECENTLY BURIED HER MOTHER COULDN'T FIND A PLACE FOR
FAMILY MEMBERS TO PARK BECAUSE ALL SPOTS WERE TAKEN BY 12 CARS.
LET'S JUST SAY, NINE CARS. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING.
WHEN I CALLED, HE SAID I KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
WRITTEN. THIS POLICY ORDER IS WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS. THIS
INDIVIDUAL, WHOM I'M NOT GOING TO NAME, IT IS NOT ABOUT NAMING
AND SHAMING, IT IS REALLY TO CORRECT A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. YOU
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TAKE BASICALLY STORAGE. STORING CARS ON OUR
STREETS FOR WHATEVER THE FEE IS FOR $40. $25 A PERSON CAN STORE
THEIR VEHICLES ON OUR STREET FOR A YEAR. AND WHEN IT THIS PERSON IS
OPERATING A FLEET AND OPERATING A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE AND
SHOULD FIND APPROPRIATE PARKING. SO I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL
SUPPORT THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SAW COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU YOU ARE ON A ROLL,
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, THANK YOU AGAIN. AS WE TALK ABOUT PARKING
MINIMUM AND CAR STORAGE, THREE THINGS BROUGHT UP THE MOST WHEN
FOLKS OPPOSE HOUSING, EVEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, TRAFFIC, PARKING,
AND HEIGHT. TO THINK SOMEONE CAN GET 25 GET AS MANY PARKING
STICKERS AS THEY WANT, TAKING UP SPACES THAT ARE OFTEN USED AS
REASON NOT TO BUILD HOUSING IS NUTS. I NEVER REALIZED THIS WAS
POSSIBLE. IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS SITUATION. AND
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD GUARD AGAINST THROUGHOUT THE CITY AS
WE LOOK TO WHETHER IT IS BIKE LANES OR HOUSING. WHERE PARKING IS
USED AS THE REASON TO NOT DO THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO.
THE FACT SOMEONE CAN GET TEN STICKERS IS INSANE. THANK YOU,
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE ISSUE HAS COME BEFORE
THE COUNCIL IN DIFFERENT FLAVORS BEFORE. THIS IS A CLEAR EGREGIOUS
VERSION. IT SHOWS THE DANGERS OF NOT CHARGING ENOUGH MONEY FOR
THE SPACE THAT WE ALLOW OUR ROADS TO BE USED FOR CAR STORAGE.
ONE POTENTIAL SOLUTION HERE IS TO CHARGE MORE MONEY, THE MORE
CARS YOU REGISTER. AND SO IF THIS PERSON WANTS TO REGISTER 12 CARS
AND THEREBY PAY THE CITY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, MAYBE THAT'S A
REASONABLE TRADEOFF FOR US TO MAKE.
I THINK WHAT IS CLEAR, WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO ISSUE THE PARKING
PERMITS AT $25 A POP TO ANYONE IN URN LIMITED NUMBERS. IF THEY RUN
A BUSINESS, $25 A YEAR IS POCKET CHANGE COMPARED TO HOW MUCH THEY
MAKE RENTING OUT THE CARS. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS ORDER. I HOPE IT'LL

PAGE 72

Sept 13, 2021

BE A CATALYST FOR US TO LOOK AT THE POLICY AND HOW WE ALLOCATE THE
SPACE IN A MORE EQUITABLE WAY ON THE STREETS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NO FURTHER HANDS UP ON THIS, WE'LL DO A
ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION OF POLICY ORDER THREE: (ROLL CALL). NINE
IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER 4. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 4). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WANT TO ADD THAT WE SUSPEND THE RULES
OR VOTE WHEN WE VOTE TO ADD YOU AS THE COSPONSOR TO THE ORDER.
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, AS I HAVE TALKED TO MORE PEOPLE, WHAT
IS A RECURRING THEME IS THE PROBLEMS WITH RODENTS IN THE CITY. I HAD
A YOUNG LADY COME BY AND LITERALLY SHOWED PICTURES WHERE THE
RODENTS WERE BURROWING UNDER THE PROPERTY. SHE PUTS CHICKEN
WIRE AND THEY BURRO. SHE DIGS NOTHING SHORT OF A MOAT AND SHE IS
AT WITS END BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL IT. PART OF
THE REASON IS A NEARBY NEIGHBOR DOESN'T DO VERY GOOD WITH THEIR
GARBAGE, PUTTING IT OUT EARLIER THAN THEY SHOULD. AND A NUMBER OF
OTHER REASONS THAT ARE ADDING TO THE PROBLEM. THIS WOMAN LIVES
ON WEST STREET. AND ANOTHER ONE ON PUTNAM AVENUE BRINGING UP
THE SAME PROBLEM. ANOTHER GENTLEMAN ON PUTNAM AVENUE. THE
MORE WE TALK TO PEOPLE, WE ARE FACE TO FACE WITH MORE PEOPLE, I
HEARD THIS AS A RECURRING THEME.

POLICY ORDER #3
That the City Manager is
requested to direct the Director
of the Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Department
and the City Solicitor to review
the City’s residential parking
permit program to determine
whether the criteria for this
program can be modified to
speak to the above-referenced
concerns and to develop
recommendations that speak to
these modifications.

WE HAVE TO TAKE MORE DIRECT AND MORE AGGRESSIVE I DON'T LIKE TO
USE THAT WORD ACTION TO EDUCATE, FINE, WHATEVER IT TAKES. WE
NEED TO CURB THE PROBLEM. WHERE I LIVE, WE HAVE CHANGED THE
FENCE. PUT IN CHICKEN WIRE. IT SEEMS ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE
PROBLEM, BUT ONE WE HAVE TO AND MUST ADDRESS. I HOPE MY
COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT MYSELF, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, AND MAYOR
SIDDIQUI, ON THIS ORDER AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AS A COSPONSOR
ON THIS ORDER TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN TO
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD.
WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
GOVERNOR WE VOTE TO ADD FOLKS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS INDEED ANOTHER LONG
STANDING PROBLEM IN THE CITY. BEFORE I WAS ELECTED, I SERVED ON THE
RODENT TASK FORCE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WORKING WITH DPW TO TRY TO
CURB THIS RODENT PROBLEM. I'M SAD TO SAY WE HAVE NOT MADE A LOT
OF HEADWAY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT SPRING WHEN THE CITY
WILL ISSUE STANDARD TRASH CONTAINERS, HOPEFULLY WILL HELP TO LIMIT
THE PROBLEM. ONE THING THAT I DO SEE ALL THE TIME AND DISCUSS THIS
WITH THE DPW IN OUR HEALTH ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE MEETING,
PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRASH CONTAINERS, AND I EXPERIENCE
THIS PROBLEM MYSELF SEVERAL YEARS AGO, SOMETIMES THE RODENTS CAN

EAT THEIR WAY IN. AND THEY USE THAT TRASH CAN AS A FEEDING DEVICE.
THE OTHER THING THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IS INTENSIFY OUR FOOD
WASTE PICKUP PROGRAM SO PEOPLE ARE SEPARATELY GETTING RID OF FOOD
WASTE FROM THE TRASH. I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS WILL GO A LONG WAY
TOWARDS HOPEFULLY REDUCING THE PROBLEM. IN THE END,
UNFORTUNATELY NO SILVER BULLETS.
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT, AS HEATHER HOFFMAN MENTIONED IN PUBLIC
COMMENT, A LOST TIME THE, PEOPLE MENTION PUTNAM AVENUE, A LOT OF
CONSTRUCTION HAPPENING THERE WITH THE TRANSFER STATION. IT WILL
DISRUPT THE RODENTS AND THEY START TO MOVE AROUND AND BOTHERING
NEW PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS, BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP
IN MIND THAT WHEN WE ARE DOING MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, IT
TENDS TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM AT LEAST LOCALLY NEAR THE PROJECT.
I SUPPORT THIS ORDER AND I HOPE THAT SOME ARE IN THE WORKS WILL
HELP.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED, IF THAT IS
POSSIBLE. AND I WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. THIS IS DEFINITELY A
PROBLEM ALL OVER THE CITY. I'LL SAY IF NEIGHBORS IT CAN BE ADDRESSED.
WE HAD IT IN OUR CORNER. I HAD THEM ROUTINELY THROUGH OR YARD, A
WHOLE BUNCH. I HAD THEM FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN CONSTRUCTION
HAPPENED UP AND DOWN THE STREET. IT HAPPENS A LOT. THE NEIGHBORS
HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF SPOT THEY CAN BE AT.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. WORK TOGETHER. THE CITY WAS VERY
GOOD ABOUT COMING TO MY NEIGHBOR AND WORKING WITH US. THIS
ORDER WILL ALLOW US TO SAY LET'S HAVE A REPORT AND SEE IF WE HAVE
TO DO MORE. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. IT DOES SAY RATS AND RODENTS. I
KNOW THERE'S NOT JUST RATS, GROUND HOGS THAT SERVE AS LARGE RATS
AND RODENTS THAT ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND HAVE BEEN SEEN FROM PEOPLE I
KNOW AROUND THE CITY THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. I ASSUME THE
MOTION MAKERS THAT'S WHY IT SAYS RODENTS. THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE
OF CRITTERS. AND ALSO A PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATION.
THEY CAN BE QUITE DAMAGING IF THEY MAKE THEY ARE DISEASE VECTORS.
I WILL SAY, THERE'S SOME TIME EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHEN THERE IS A WAY
TO HAVE EFFECTIVE RODENT SIDES THAT DON'T KILL THE BIRDS OF PREY. THE
CITY WILL WORK ON THAT, WE WANT TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM, WE
WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE DO IT TO END SURE WE DON'T ENDANGER
SMALL CHILDREN, RAPTORS OR BIRDS WE RELY ON TO KEEP THE CITY AND
ECOSYSTEM HEALTHY. I APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. WE'LL ADD MYSELF, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN,
AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN AS COSPONSORS. AND ALSO COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. ON THAT, ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE ORDER ADD AMENDED?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 14. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 14). WE HEARD AN UPDATE DURING THE CITY MANAGER'S
MEETING. I WILL LET YOU GO AHEAD AND TALK.

Motion to add Mayor Siddiqui,
Councillor McGovern,
Councillor Zondervan, and
Councillor Nolan as cosponsors
to Policy Order #4

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: DID YOU WANT TO GO TO THE MOTION MAKER
FIRST?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE ORDER SAYS, WE'RE
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE ACCESS TO THE PARK DURING
CONSTRUCTION. IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT COMMUNITY SPACE.
OBVIOUSLY, DURING THE PANDEMIC, EXTRA IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THIS
OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITY. I HAD REACHED OUT TO THE MANAGER
AND DPW AND THEY INDICATED THE CONTRACTS HAD BEEN SIGNED AND THE
PROJECT HAD TO MOVE FORWARD AS PLANNED. WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR
WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE ACCESS WHILE THE PROJECT IS MOVING FORWARD
SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SPACE TO THE PUBLIC EVEN AS
WE IMPROVE IT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I KNOW THE MAYOR HAS ACTUALLY
BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A FEW WEEKS. AS YOU HEARD, THE CITY
MANAGER HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WORK WITH THE CONTRACTOR AND WILL
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A STAGGERED SCHEDULE SO THAT ESPECIALLY THE
CHILDREN FROM THE CAMBRIDGE PORT SCHOOL USE THAT FOR AN
OUTDOOR SPACE FOR EATING AND RECESS CAN ACCESS THAT SPACE AS YOU
MENTIONED DURING THE DIFFICULT TIME WHERE PEOPLE NEED TO BE
OUTSIDE. THAT'S MOVING FORWARD AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO
THE MAYOR FOR PUSHING ON THAT AND TO THE CITY MANAGER AND THE
DPW. I KNOW IT WAS NO EASY THING TO THINK ABOUT THE CONTRACTS AS
THEY WERE LITERALLY PUTTING UP THAT FENCING AND MOVING FORWARD.
IT WAS A HEAVY LIFT AND DID COST MONEY, BUT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO. I SAY THANK YOU TO THE MAYOR FOR ALL OF THE EFFORTS THERE. I
DO WONDER SINCE THIS DOES SEEM TO BE RESOLVED AND MOVING
FORWARD, IF MY COLLEAGUE CONSIDERING WITHDRAWING THIS POLICY
ORDER AT THE TIME?

POLICY ORDER #4
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
That the City Manager is
requested to direct the
appropriate City departments
to draft a report on the City’s
rodent and pest control efforts
since February 2020, to outline
what metrics are being used to
determine the effectiveness of
these efforts, and to issue
recommendations as to whether
increasing the budget for these
efforts, as well as creating new
incentives and penalties to
ensure community compliance
with regulations around rodent
control, would lead to a greater
level of success in resolving this
issue.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO IT
DOES ASK FOR A REPORT BACK. MAYBE IF WE WANT TO AMEND IT TO THANK
THE MANAGER FOR LOOKING INTO THIS. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO
GET A REPORT BACK AS TO WHAT THE EXACT RESOLUTION IS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF POLICY ORDERS, EVEN JUST ON THE AGENDA. THERE'S A LOT TO DO WITH
THE CITY STAFF. I WONDER IF A BETTER VEHICLE MAY BE FOR THE CITY
MANAGER TO INCLUDE THAT ON THIS WEEK'S WEEKLY UPDATE THAT COMES
ON FRIDAYS THAT HAVE A FULLER EXPLANATION. WE CAN SHARE OUT WITH
RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ASKED US ABOUT THIS RATHER THAN PUT A POLICY
ORDER FORWARD AND ASK FOR A FORMAL REPORT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

WOULD THAT BE AMENDABLE?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: A CLEAR UPDATE IS FINE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE ON THE AGENDA.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK AND THANKS TO MY
COLLEAGUE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLACING THIS ON FILE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT. THE PORT HAS 21% OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF OPEN
SPACE PER CAPITA. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT SENATE PARK SHOULDN'T BE
RECONSTRUCTED, I JUST THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN THE
CITY. AND EVERY EFFORT THAT THERE IS IN ACQUISITION SHOULD BE
TOWARD OPEN SPACE, ESPECIALLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS GREATLY
UNDERSERVED. AND THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE IS CRITICAL. SOME
NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE SO LITTLE OPEN SPACE THAT IT IS SHOCKING AND
THE PORT IS ONE OF THEM.
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OPEN SPACES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF PLANNING FOR
NEIGHBORHOODS AND NOT JUST AUTOMATICALLY THINK WE'LL CONSTRUCT
IN IT AND PUT UP BUILDINGS. THE SENATE PARK IS THE HEART, EVEN
THOUGH IT IS ON THE EDGE OF THE PORT. IF WE DON'T HAVE OTHER OPEN
SPACES TO COMPENSATE, AND PLAN FOR IT, WE'RE GOING NOWHERE
POSITIVE FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL POINT OF VIEW, FROM A SOCIAL POINT
OF VIEW, AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. TO ME THIS IS ONE OF
THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I DO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR
THOSE IMPORTANT COMMENTS. WE ARE ORGANIZING A FORUM AS WELL IN
A COUPLE OF WEEKS, I BELIEVE, TO DISCUSS THIS GENERAL ISSUE OF MAKING
SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH OPEN SPACE. IN TERMS OF THIS POLICY ORDER, I
DON'T BELIEVE WE PLACE ON FILE. I THINK IT IS FINE FOR THE MANAGER TO
RESPOND TO US INFORMALLY AND SOMETIMES HE DOES THAT ANYWAY. I
WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S FINE. I COULD HAVE PUT IN AN ORDER AND I
WENT DIRECTLY I KNEW IT WOULD BE A HUGE ISSUE. WE DID COME TO A
RESOLUTION. AND WE'LL SHARE THAT MOMENT THE POINT IS DONE AND I
HEAR YOU, YOU WANT SOMETHING IN WRITING. TO THE PUBLIC, WE'LL LET
THEM KNOW THE SOLUTION TO THIS, THE WORK HAD BEEN DONE PRIOR TO
THIS ORDER BEING SUBMITTED. ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE ORDER: (ROLL CALL). IT FAILS, FOUR IN FAVOR AND
FIVE AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE WILL NOW GO TO DONE WITH POLICY ORDERS.
