allocation since this additional amount is subject to appropriation through the state budgeting process.
The funds will be used to allow the Consumers' Council to continue the mediation of consumer
complaints from individuals in Cambridge as well as in Somerville, Arlington, Belmont, Watertown and
Waltham which do not have their own complaint mediation program.

Temporary Firehouse Location
City Council Order O-22 October 7, 2019

In response to the City Council Policy Order O-22 of October 7, 2019 concerning the temporary
relocation of the Taylor Square Firehouse I am pleased to offer the following information.
Similarly to when the Taylor Square Firehouse was renovated in 2002-2003, Engine Co. 8,
Ladder Co. 4 and Division 2 have been temporarily relocated to a facility on Smith Place off of
Concord Avenue.
As part of the relocation process, adjustments have been made to the dispatch assignments
affecting the sections of the city impacted by this temporary move. In conjunction with staff from
Emergency Communications the assignments, known as “Running Cards” have been adjusted to
ensure adequate and effective response to any incident in the Northwest section of the city as
well as response to segments of North Cambridge.
It is expected the units will return to the Taylor Square Firehouse on or around July 1, 2020.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment
Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for the City’s annual
contribution to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line Extension
(GLX) project.
As documented in the attached January 22, 2018 appropriation memo for the first contribution,
the GLX project has significant benefits to the City of Cambridge:
•
•

•

Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the current facility, which is obsolete,
in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with disabilities.
Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and Medford that
are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. In addition to better serving
trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge, the GLX will serve trips from these
locations into the key employment centers located in eastern Cambridge.
Assisting in meeting the City’s and the region’s mobility, sustainability, and economic
development goals.

To date, the GLX project has made significant progress on construction, including relocation of
the adjacent commuter rail tracks to make room for the light rail line, construction of sound walls
and other structures, replacement of bridges along the alignment, and beginning construction of a
new vehicle maintenance building. More noticeable work has recently begun in Cambridge in the
vicinity of Lechmere, including significant progress on the construction of the viaduct for the
new Lechmere Station and the connection north and west towards Somerville and Medford. In
May 2020, service to the current Lechmere Station will shut down and be replaced with a major
busing operation to connect to downtown Boston, allowing for the reconstruction and renovation
of the existing Lechmere viaduct and the tie-in to the new Lechmere Station. The first phase of
the GLX is then expected to open approximately a year later, in the late spring of 2021.

Packet Pg. 45

2.9

City staff continue to be heavily involved in reviewing and commenting on the design of the
improvements within Cambridge, as well as the impacts on City streets and utilities. This
includes attending monthly Community Working Group meetings, reviewing preliminary
designs and construction documents, coordinating utility design and construction, and assisting
in publicizing upcoming construction work and the resulting impacts.
Based on the most recent information provided by the MBTA’s Green Line Extension program
management, the GLX project continues to advance on time and on budget. This is particularly
important as the project reaches important milestones on heavy infrastructure work such as major
drainage elements, bridges and viaducts, and the vehicle maintenance building. Based on the
progress to date, the project continues to meet the requirements laid out in the Project
Participation Agreement (PPA) between the City of Cambridge, the MBTA, and the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation. As a result, I remain confident that the funds being
contributed to the GLX project are being spent responsibly and for the purposes laid out in the
PPA, and I am pleased to request this appropriation to continue our partnership with the state and
the MBTA.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5 million from Free Cash to the Public Investment
Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for the City’s first contribution
to the GLX project.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Massachusetts Department of
Transportation (MassDOT) have been working for many years to advance the Green Line
Extension (GLX) project from planning to design, and then into construction and operation. This
project will extend the Green Line from its current terminal at Lechmere to serve seven new
stations in Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford. From the Cambridge perspective, the principal
benefits of this extension include the following:
 Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the current facility, which is obsolete,
in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with disabilities.
 Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and Medford that
are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. In addition to better serving
trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge, the GLX will serve trips from these
locations into the key employment centers located in eastern Cambridge.
 Assisting in meeting the City’s and the region’s mobility, sustainability, and economic
development goals.
In addition, the relocated Lechmere Station enables a number of opportunities associated with
the Cambridge Crossing development, including the extension of First Street across Monsignor
O’Brien Highway, the creation of a new development parcel at the current location of Lechmere
Station, and general improvements to access the entire site.
Based on these multiple benefits, the City of Cambridge has long been supportive of this project,
and has pushed the MBTA and MassDOT to move the project expeditiously, despite multiple
delays and attempts to cancel the project.

Attachment: GLX Appropriation Memo 2018 102119 (CMA 2019 #272 : Executive Dept appropriation of $5,000,000 for GLX)

2.9.a

In 2015, after construction on the project had commenced, the Commonwealth announced that
the project was significantly over budget, and put construction on hold, pending a review of the
design, cost factors, construction methods, and procurement strategy, with the goal of
determining whether the project should be moved forward in a modified and less costly manner,
or whether it should be cancelled despite the construction work already completed. During this
review of the project, Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack made it clear that she
expected some level of municipal financial contribution to the project, to help offset the cost
increases. Although this request was unprecedented for a public transportation project in
Massachusetts, both the City of Cambridge and the City of Somerville agreed to enter into
negotiations with MassDOT in order to help save the GLX as an active project.
Based on these negotiations, which also included representatives from Divcowest, owners of the
Cambridge Crossing (then Northpoint) development, Cambridge agreed to contribute $25
million dollars to the GLX project, half of which ($12.5 million) will come from contributions
by DivcoWest. At the same time, Somerville agreed to contribute approximately $50 million
dollars to the project, recognizing the more substantial benefit that they will realize from the
project. The Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) also agreed to
reprogram the $150 million in federal funding originally intended for the next phase GLX
extension to State Route 16 to help pay for the current project. Based on these financial
commitments, along with changes to the design to simplify the project and reduce costs, the
Commonwealth determined that it would continue to move forward with the project, subject to
ongoing discussions regarding the project scope and budget.
The agreements between the City, MassDOT, and the MBTA were then laid out and
memorialized in the attached Project Participation Agreement (PPA), which was entered into on
December 14, 2016. The PPA also described the various rights and responsibilities of the parties,
including a schedule of contributions, the milestones that the MBTA and MassDOT must meet,
and the procedures for refunding excess municipal contributions. At the City Council meeting on
September 26, 2016, the City Council authorized the City Manager to enter into this agreement
and sign the PPA. A similar agreement was developed with the City of Somerville for their $50
million contribution.
Since the signing of the PPA, the MBTA has made significant progress on the GLX project,
including hiring a new Program Manager and developing a more detailed version of the design
that formed the basis for the decision to move forward. The MBTA also made a decision to
switch to a design-build procurement method, which should provide a greater degree of cost
certainty once the contract is in place. The MBTA then developed and advertised a design-build
request for proposals, and went through an extensive, multi-step process to solicit and evaluate
proposals from potential design-build teams. Three proposals were received, two of which were
below the maximum allowed price and were therefore fully evaluated. On November 20, 2017,
the MBTA’s Fiscal and Management Control Board awarded the contract to build the project to
a joint venture called GLX Constructors, at a contract price of just over $1 billion, allowing the
project to restart in earnest. In addition, the MBTA has created the GLX Community Working
Group (CWG), which will provide a collaborative forum for information sharing between the
GLX project and external stakeholders, including schedules, activities, and potential impacts
associated with construction, while also soliciting stakeholder feedback. The CWG will include
representatives from the City, DivcoWest, and the East Cambridge Business Association.

As laid out in the PPA, the first Cambridge contribution for the GLX project is due on March 1,
2018, with subsequent contributions due November 1 for each of the following four years (20192022); each contribution is an equal amount of $5 million. MassDOT and the MBTA have met
their initial obligations under the PPA, notably having met the Start of Construction by having
signed a contract and issued a Notice to Proceed to GLX Constructors and by establishing the
Green Line Extension Project Cambridge Participation Expendable Trust contemplated in the
PPA to receive contributions from the City of Cambridge. Based on this, we are fully expecting
to need to make the initial $5 million contribution on March 1, 2018.

2020 Census Complete Count Committee.
The funds will be used to support outreach and education efforts to all people living in
Cambridge to promote a full, complete, and accurate count in the 2020 US Census.
Outreach will include:
•
•
•
•

Hiring of a part-time Census Outreach Workers to attend events in the community, staff
Census kiosks, and visit neighborhoods to ensure as many people as possible complete
their 2020 Census.
Printing and dissemination of Census educational materials in multiple languages to
communicate directly to Cambridge residents about the important of the US Census.
Events to promote “Census Day” and other educational events around the City to reach
residents.
Technology in the form of tablets/kiosks in locations across the City to offer residents the
chance to complete their Census online if they do not have internet access at home.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $163,707 from Free Cash to the General Fund
Human Service Programs Other Ordinary Maintenance account to increase funding for tenant
eviction prevention services consistent with the recommendations of the Mayor’s Blue Ribbon
Task Force on Tenant Displacement. These funds would have been appropriated as part of the
FY20 budget but it made sense to wait to match the expenditures to the recommendations of the
Task Force. These funds will be included in the FY21 budget.
The funds will enable the Department of Human Service Programs to expand its contract for
legal services for the Multi Service Center with Greater Boston Legal Services through the
Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation (MLAC) by $65,000. In FY19, the contract was
increased from $130,000 to $195,000. This current increase will bring the total contract for
FY20 to $260,000.
The funds will also support a contract for $26,707 through MLAC for continued funding for a
part time attorney for DeNovo to continue coordinating the Lawyer for a Day Housing Clinic at
the Middlesex Session of the Eastern Housing Court each Friday. The attorney both provides
legal advice and assistance and coordinates the services of other attorneys who provide services
pro-bono.
This funding will also support a $2000 contract with the Alliance of Cambridge Tenants for
tenant education.
Finally, the funds will also be used to increase by $70,000, from the current $145,000, funds
through the Multi Service Center for eviction prevention or rental assistance. These funds are
used to help tenants avoid eviction by paying a portion of back rent or by helping tenants who
are moving to new housing pay for a security deposit and/or moving expenses. The new funding
will allow the Multi Service Center to increase its cap on payments from $1500 to $2000.
Tenants will also be able to request to request assistance 3 times in 5 years rather than 2 times.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

To Whom It May Concern:
As shown in the attached photo, the sidewalk curb extends in front of the driveway at 406408 Norfolk St. This lack of alignment makes it difficult for vehicles to drive in or back out

MBP letter in support of Policy Order #18 & Park Walk 10.8 @ 11am
10.4.19 letter in support of POR 338.pdf

Hi All,
Please see a letter from MBP in support for Policy Order #18 (POR 2019 #338) below. Once more, thanks for your
support at Magazine Beach!
Also, on Tuesday, Oct. 8, rain or shine, DCR’s Rick Corsi and I will be giving tours of Phase II‐1 at the park, at 11am,
starting at the Powder Magazine. Please join us.
Usually, we don’t have access to the construction site, where 9 trees and thousands of perennials and bushes have just
been planted. But we will on Tuesday. We’re also giving tours at noon (Boston Biomedical) and 1pm (Cambridge Plant &
Garden Club) that day. So PLEASE LET ME KNOW if you can join us, or if I/we should fold the 11am tour into the
others.
For photos of recent work, or about Phase II‐1, see magazinebeach.org and click on Projects, too. The park is looking
AMAZING.
My best,
Cathie

RE:

Alexandria Upzoning Petition (APP 2019 # 82)

Dear Councillors,
We write to confirm our opposition to the substance of Alexandria’s latest re-filed upzoning
petition (APP 2019 #82) in its current form. This petition is the same, in substance, as the last
re-file, and our position has not changed since we last discussed the project. Absent a deal that
moves the proposed Eversource substation off of Fulkerson, we oppose the current petition.
As stated at recent City Council meetings regarding the previous iteration of this petition, the
current proposal for a 400,000 square foot building is too big and too close to our residential
neighborhood next to the proposed electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, which Eversource
has indicated may be more than 90 feet tall, and very likely quite a bit taller.
We hope that this refiling of the petition can define a concrete timetable to motivate all relevant
parties to work out a solution to move the proposed substation out of a residential area across the
street from a school.
We recognize that the Council is required to forward the petition to the Ordinance Committee
tomorrow but hope that the Council continues to withhold support for the substance of petition
unless and until a solution is worked out with Eversource.
Sincerely,
Pamela Van Dort, Jose Luis Rojas, and Lino Becerra

WHEREAS:

The existing City’s Inspectional Services Demolition Permitting system makes no
allowances for a differentiated, nor expedited, process for occurrences where a
building has significantly deteriorated as a result of a natural disaster, such as a fire;
and

WHEREAS:

The current application for a Demolition Permit requires a site plan, including
architectural drawings of the proposed construction to be built following demolition,
which can be costly to procure and difficult to obtain in the immediate aftermath of
such a traumatic event; and

WHEREAS:

There can be significant delays, in some cases over 12 months, in the current
Demolition and Building Permit procedure which should not apply to cases where the
structure is significantly damaged by a natural disaster, such as Historical Commission
demolition delay and others; and

WHEREAS:

The length of the current Demolition and Permitting process presents victims of natural
disasters with additional financial burdens during an already difficult time, as well as
causing other problems on their damaged property such as rodents and other nuisances;
and

WHEREAS:

There needs to be a separate and expedited process for buildings that have been
damaged due to a natural disaster, such as fire; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Inspectional
Services Department, the Department of Public Works, the Cambridge Historical
Commission and other relevant City departments to determine the feasibility of
expediting the Demolition and Rebuilding permitting process in the event of a natural
disaster, including but not limited to: instituting a committee with members from the
aforementioned three Departments, and creating a dedicated point person within
Inspectional Services to serve as a liaison to assist property owners throughout the
process; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to ensure the online explanations of,
and forms pertaining to, demolition permitting be changed to reflect the
aforementioned changes to the demolition permitting process in the event of a natural
disaster, should these changes be adopted; and be it further

forward following a series of violent incidents that had taken place near Central Square
and the Port that had left residents of those areas feeling particularly rattled,
particularly in the wake of the murder of Anthony Clay; and

WHEREAS:

That Policy Order stated that the office of then-Mayor Simmons had “…held public
meetings focusing upon ways of bringing community leaders and stakeholders together
to proactively curb the increase in violence that has typically been seen in Cambridge
and other cities during the summer months,” and that one of the suggestions stemming
from these meetings was that the City and the Cambridge Housing Authority might
wish to pilot a program that would bring additional security officers to CHA buildings,
similar to a program that had recently been conducted in Boston; and

WHEREAS:

The August 1, 2016 Policy Order also stated that “…there is a sense that having
additional officers who are stationed in and focused exclusively upon building stronger
relationships around Cambridge Housing Authority properties could have an
appreciable impact upon reducing the opportunities for violent episodes” in those
buildings and making the tenants feel safer; and

WHEREAS:

Unfortunately, that Policy Order was met with resistance and was referred to a
committee, yet the concerns around building security from tenants in CHA buildings in
Central Square and the Port very much remain a constant, and tenants in these
buildings have been making renewed requests to members of the City Council to help
bring about new security measures in these buildings; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

Cambridge has in recent years replaced natural surfaces such as grass with artificial
turf at numerous playing fields and playgrounds including all of the soccer fields at
Danehy Park; and

WHEREAS:

The rationale for replacing grass with synthetic turf is that it affords more hours of play
in all seasons and requires less water and maintenance to keep the fields playable and
smooth, but plastic turf also holds more heat and cannot absorb stormwater runoff; and

WHEREAS:

Public health advocates have long raised concerns about artificial turf pellets
(especially non-organic fill, which in some cases is composed of “crumb rubber”
sourced from used tires); the fill simulates the resiliency of natural grass but has been
shown to contain benzene, cadmium, and other known carcinogens; and

WHEREAS:

Artificial turf is manufactured from petroleum-based materials and when it wears out it
must be removed it cannot be recycled; and

WHEREAS:

Recently the Ecology Center, a nonprofit environmental research group in Michigan,
and the New England office of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility,
conducted a series of tests on artificial turf blades discarded in Franklin (MA), artificial
turf blades in use on a high school field in Easton (MA), and samples of new artificial
turf blades acquired from distributors; and

WHEREAS:

These tests showed that the plastic blades contained elevated levels of per- and
polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS), which have been linked to kidney cancer, low
infant birth weights, and a range of diseases; and

WHEREAS:

Known as “forever chemicals” that never fully biodegrade, PFAS are also used in
flame retardants, nonstick pans, clothing and furniture, and even in very low
concentrations PFAS can be harmful and can contaminate the groundwater supply; and

Based on this testing, MassDEP is reviewing the related Wetlands Protection Act

Public Health, the Department of Public Works, the Department of Human Services

WHEREAS:

Many car owners do not have off-street parking and might want to have their
cars filled while parked on the street or in public garages, raising additional
curb management conflicts and safety concerns; and
