Packet Pg. 72

Communication: 544-550 Mass Ave_20210831 (Public Hearings)

Area of sub-surface petrochemical
remediation cost $500,000. in 2017-2019
No further work required per MA DEP.
Leak had continued for decades.

❖

Property subject to long-term leaseholds which have negative value and are
unsustainable.

❖

Building in advanced state of dilapidation and completely beyond its economic
life.

❖

12 years remaining on existing leases that allow no funding for restoration,
renovation, or repair.

❖

Building has had close to 60 years of deferred maintenance.

❖
❖

This effort is new ownership’s to attempt to reverse the decline.
Working around existing leaseholders requires a taller building, small
footprints on each ﬂoor, small units, and extremely high costs per foot for
renovation.

Packet Pg. 73

Communication: 544-550 Mass Ave_20210831 (Public Hearings)

Leasehold Constraints

❖

Small residential units will create the largest number of Affordable Units.

❖

Small residential units will ﬁt within the constrained footprint of each ﬂoor.

❖

Small residential units will generate more revenue per square foot to cover extremely high construction
costs, while providing housing in extreme demand at the lowest price of any new proposed
development in Central Square, and the lowest of any type of inclusionary housing.

❖

Small residential units are the only option in light of the cost to build over existing uses in this tightly
constrained and occupied site.

❖

Small units without car ownership would be perfectly located 200 feet from MBTA station and bus
stations.

❖

Small units will justify elevator costs and full ADA reﬁt of building, and MA Code for buildings over 3
stories.

❖

A waiver of the Lot Area per Dwelling Unit limit is justiﬁed in light of the speciﬁc, unique hardships
created by the site access, easement, and subsurface soil conditions which severely limit the utilization
of the site.

❖

20 residential units permitted by right based on lot area with
inclusionary units

❖

Seeking 29 residential units due to hardship of subsurface soil
conditions and development constraints speciﬁc to this parcel.

❖

Zoning does not consider size of units, code encourages larger units,
but construction costs with speciﬁc hardships make this a challenge
at this site. Demand for units of all sizes dramatically exceeds supply.

❖

Process is running in parallel and should be considered in
consultation with the BZA by the Planning Board. Meeting has been
continued pending Planning Board progress.
