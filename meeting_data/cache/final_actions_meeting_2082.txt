February 26, 2018
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am pleased to inform you, the taxpayers, and all our residents that the City of Cambridge has retained its
noteworthy distinction of being one of approximately 33 municipalities in the United States with AAA
ratings from each of the nation’s three major credit rating agencies. Each year since 1999, the City has
received these ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings. This
achievement allows the City to finance important projects throughout Cambridge with the most favorable
interest rate. The rating agencies highlighted the City’s strong financial position, including significant
reserve levels; a large and diverse tax base; ample excess levy capacity under Proposition 2 ½; and a
strong and experienced management team.
These ratings are in conjunction with the City’s sale of General Obligation bonds ($2.5 million in
minibonds and $90.9 million in the competitive sale). The minibond sale took place from February 20-26,
2018 and the competitive sale will take place on March 1, 2018.
Capital projects funded in these sales include the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and
Community Complex, sewer reconstruction, street and sidewalk reconstruction, and other municipal and
school building renovations.
Based on this ongoing recognition from the rating agencies, the City Council can be justly proud of its
sound fiscal policies. Additionally, I would like to thank the City’s Finance Team and Department Heads
and staff for their commitment to prudently managing their budgets and programs. The City is fortunate
to have such a strong and dedicated team.
Listed below are highlights from the Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch credit reports. Attached are
the individual rating opinions.

Moody’s Investor Services

Summary
Cambridge, Massachusetts (Aaa stable) benefits from a sizeable and diverse tax base that continues to

Packet Pg. 30

1.1

grow significantly year over year. The city's economy is driven largely by the presence of Harvard
University (Aaa stable) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Aaa stable) and the significant
research and development sector. The city's financial position is strong with very healthy liquidity and
reserves that are maintained by strong fiscal management. Both the debt burden and long term liabilities
for pension and OPEB are will remain manageable over the near term.
Credit strengths
» Large and diverse tax base anchored by institutional presences and robust commercial
sector
» Healthy financial position guided by formal policies
» Strong fiscal management
» Ample operating flexibility with excess levy capacity under Proposition 2½
» Expected to fully fund pension liability by 2026
Credit challenges
» High regional cost of living and cost of business
Rating outlook
The stable outlook reflects the strong fiscal management practices that we expect to maintain a healthy
financial position given conservative multi-year budget forecasting and adherence to formal fiscal
policies. The outlook also incorporates the stabilizing presence of the higher education institutions as well
as the ongoing trend of consistent tax base growth from both appreciation and development.
Factors that could lead to a downgrade
» Material growth in the debt burden or pension liability
» Deterioration in the tax base or weakening of the local economy
» Trend of operating deficits leading to significant reduction in cash and reserves

Standard and Poor’s
Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'AAA' rating and stable outlook to Cambridge, Mass.' series 2018A and
2018B general obligation (GO) municipal-purpose loan bonds and affirmed its 'AAA' rating, with a stable
outlook, on the city's existing GO debt.
The rating reflects our opinion of the city's:
➢Very strong economy, with access to a broad and diverse metropolitan statistical area (MSA);
➢Very strong management, with strong financial policies and practices under our Financial
Management Assessment (FMA) methodology;
➢Strong budgetary performance, with operating surpluses in the general fund and at the totalgovernmental-fund level in fiscal 2017;
➢Very strong budgetary flexibility, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2017 of 52% of
operating expenditures, and the flexibility to raise additional revenue despite commonwealth wide
tax caps;
➢Very strong liquidity, with total government available cash at 68.8% of total-governmental-fund
expenditures and 7.5x governmental debt service, and access to external liquidity we consider
strong;
➢Adequate debt-and-contingent-liability position, with debt service carrying charges at 9.1% of
expenditures and net direct debt that is 55.6% of total-governmental-fund revenue, as well as low
overall net debt at less than 3% of market value and rapid amortization, with 80.1% of debt
scheduled to be retired within 10 years, but significant medium-term debt plans and a large
Packet Pg. 31

1.1

pension and other-postemployment-benefit (OPEB) obligation; and
➢Strong institutional framework score
Very strong management
We view the city's management as very strong, with strong financial policies and practices under our
FMA methodology, indicating financial practices are strong, well embedded, and likely sustainable.
Key factors include management's:
➢Conservative revenue and expenditure assumptions in the budgeting process that focus on five
years of historical information;
➢Quarterly reports on budget-to-actual results and investments to the city's finance and investment
committees, respectively;
➢Long-term financial plan with credible assumptions;
➢Five-year capital plan with identified funding sources, which it is expanding to include a
municipal-facilities-improvement plan;
➢Robust debt and investment policy it reviews at least annually to demonstrate adherence; and
➢Reserve policy that requires maintaining a minimum 15% of expenditures

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' opinion of Cambridge's healthy and growing economy,
which has aided in continued strong financial performance, supported by very strong management. We
understand Cambridge currently expects to issue a significate amount of debt over the next few years; we,
however, do not expect financial performance to deteriorate. Therefore, we do not expect to change the
rating within the next two years because we believe Cambridge will likely sustain current financial
performance and comparably high reserves. While unlikely to occur, we could lower the rating if fund
balance were to deteriorate significantly or if debt were to weaken substantially.

Fitch Ratings
Analytical Conclusion
The city's 'AAA' GO bond rating and Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflect our expectation for Cambridge
to maintain healthy financial flexibility through economic cycles, consistent with a history of strong
operating performance and budget controls. The city's superior financial profile reflects a wealthy and
growing property tax base, moderate expenditure growth and demonstrated ability to reduce expenditures
during economic downturns.
Fitch Ratings expects long-term liabilities to remain moderately low based on manageable capital needs,
rapid principal amortization and a practice of fully funding actuarially determined pension contributions
Key Rating Drivers
• Revenue Framework: 'aaa'
Revenues are derived primarily from property taxes. Total general fund revenue growth of about 4.7%
annually over the past 10 years has exceeded both U.S. GDP and CPI for the same period, reflecting
property tax levy increases and strong growth in Cambridge's economy and tax base. The city maintains
significant excess levy capacity under the state's Proposition 2 1/2 law, and Fitch expects revenue growth
to remain strong.
• Expenditure Framework: 'aa'

Packet Pg. 32

1.1

The natural pace of spending growth is expected by Fitch to be in line with to below natural revenue
growth over time. Carrying costs for long-term liabilities claim a moderate proportion of governmental
spending. Principal amortization rates are rapid at 80% over 10 years, and a large portion of debt is selfsupporting from user charges.
• Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa'
Cambridge's debt and unfunded net pension liabilities are moderately low at roughly 8% of estimated
personal income. Fitch anticipates Cambridge's long-term liability burden to remain close to this level
based on a manageable capital plan and a record of actuarially based pension funding.
• Operating Performance: 'aaa'
Careful expenditure management, combined with moderate tax levy increases and conservative financial
forecasting, has led to very high reserves over the past decade. Fitch expects management to maintain a
strong level of financial resilience through a typical economic cycle, with the reserves supplementing
superior inherent budget flexibility.
Rating Sensitivities
• Expenditure Management: The IDR is sensitive to maintenance of the city's solid expenditure
flexibility. Material reductions in the city's ability to manage spending, while unexpected, could
pressure the rating.
In closing, the City Council and staff can be justly proud of our sound fiscal policies with the continued
affirmation of our triple A ratings and the positive impact it has on our residents.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale

Profile
Cambridge is a sizeable community in Massachusetts (Aa1 stable) adjacent to the City of Boston (Aaa stable). Cambridge, whose
economy and tax base are anchored by several prominent higher education and health care institutions, has a population of
approximately 108,000.

Economy and tax base: Strong economy and tax base anchored by world renowned institutions
Cambridge's economy will continue to benefit from the presence of Harvard and MIT which together enroll 33,000 students and
provide employment equivalent to 21,000 full-time positions (roughly 18% of the city's workforce). In addition, the city is home to a
vibrant commercial sector including biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which together employ an additional 21,000 people.
Together the universities and mentioned industries comprise just under 60% of the jobs provided by the top 25 employers. Recently, a
top employer, Akamai, announced the layoff of 400 employees, approximatly 5% of its global workforce. However, this type of news is
mitigated by the continued influx of startups and related venture capital firms who value the highly education workforce. The top ten
taxpayers are slightly concentrated, representing 20.1% of 2018 assessed value. MIT, with its significant taxable property, is the largest
taxpayer, representing 7.3% of the city's base.
The $39.6 billion tax base (2018 equalized value) is large and is expected to continue to grow over the next several years given strong
housing demand and the strength of the overall economy. The 2018 assessed value growth of 10.1%, the fourth consecutive year of
double digit growth, brought the five year compound annual growth rate to 10.1% as well. Given the redevelopment success of Kendall
Square, new development in other parts of the city will continue to contribute to tax base growth with projects that include the MBTA
green line extension, the long term development of the Volpe center and focus on the neighborhoods of Cambridge Crossing and
Alewife. Additionally, commercial vacancy rates remain well below the regional average.
Resident income levels remain above average relative to the commonwealth and national medians, despite the large student
population. Median family income equals 120% and 158% of the commonwealth and national medians, respectively. Also, the
unemployment rate of 2.3% (October 2017) remains below Massachusetts' and the nation's rates of 3.3% and 3.9%.
Financial operations and reserves: Strong financial position will continue to be bolstered by conservative fiscal
management
The city's financial position will remain healthy over the near term given ample liquidity and reserves that are maintained by
conservative fiscal management. The fiscal 2017 audited financials reflect an operating surplus of $31.7 million due to positive variance
in revenues mostly from excise taxes as well as conservative budgeting for expenditures. The surplus, the city's sixth in a row, increased
available general fund balance (assigned, unassigned and committed) to $330.3 million or a very healthy 53.7% of revenues. Property
taxes represented the largest revenue source (61% of total revenues) while education (34% of total expenditures) and public safety
(22%) represented the largest expenses.
The fiscal 2018 operating budget increased 4.97% over last year's adjusted operating budget driven by salaries and pension
contributions. The budget included a 4.4% increase in the tax levy and a $12.2 million appropriation of free cash, mostly for one-time
costs. Current operations are trending on budget with a very minor deficit in snow and ice expenses that will likely be offset by overall
positive operating variance.
The city's fiscal 2019-2022 budget projections indicate balanced annual operations using conservative assumptions. The expenditure
projections include a 2.5% annual increase in salaries, 6.66% in pension contributions, and school department costs increase by a 6%
property tax increase. The revenue projections include level funding of state aid while real and personal property taxes increase by
an average 7.4% annually. The city also maintains $181.5 million in unused levy capacity, equal to just under 30% of revenues. This
provides significant operating flexibility under Proposition 2 ½ that is not available to most municipalities in Massachusetts given the
need to levy to the tax levy limit each year.
LIQUIDITY

Cash and investments at the end of fiscal 2017 totaled $363.4 million representing an ample, 59.1% of revenues.

Detailed credit considerations

1.1.a
U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE

Debt and pension liabilities: Debt burden and long term liabilities will remain manageable over near term
The net direct debt burden of 1.3% of equalized value is average and will likely remain manageable over the near term despite
the possibility of a slight increase due to growing capital plans. The overall debt burden, incorporating the overlapping debt of the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (Aa1 stable), is 1.7%. Favorably, almost 30% of the outstanding debt is supported by sewer
and other user fees. The fiscal 2018 capital budget totals $124.8 million, a 49% increase from 2017. The increase is driven largely by
school projects. Future debt plans total $392.6 million over the next four years (2019-2022) to fund $162 million of elementary school
construction and $89 million sewer reconstruction projects.
DEBT STRUCTURE

The entire debt portfolio consists of fixed rate debt with 84% of principal retired in ten years. Fiscal 2017 debt service was $57.8 million
or 9.9% of general fund expenditures.
DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVES

The city is not party to any interest rate swaps or other derivative agreements.
PENSIONS AND OPEB

The city participates in the City of Cambridge Retirement System, a cost sharing multiple employer defined benefit retirement plan.
The city contributed $30.9 million in fiscal 2017 ($300,000 more than the actuarially determined contribution), equal to a manageable
5.3% of general fund expenditures. The fiscal 2017 three-year average Moody's Adjusted Net Pension Liability (ANPL), under Moody's
methodology for adjusting reported pension data, is $853 million, or an average 1.4 times general fund revenues or 2.2% of equalized
value. The city plans to fully fund the pension plan by 2026, well ahead of the state mandated date of 2040. To meet this aggressive
funding schedule, the city projects that pension costs will increase 6.7% annually, and the city will continue contributing an additional
$300,000 over the required contribution.
The city also contributed $20.3 million towards its annual OPEB cost in 2016, representing 36% of the annual required contribution.
The total unfunded liability is $609 million with a funded ratio of 1.7%, as of the June 30, 2017 valuation report. In addition to the
annual contribution the city continues to annually budget and contribute $2 million to its OPEB trust with a current total balance of
$13 million.
Total fixed costs for fiscal 2017, including debt service, required pension contributions and retiree healthcare payments, represented
$109 million, or a slightly elevated 18.7% of expenditures.
Management and governance: Strong fiscal management will continue to bolster credit strength
The experienced management team is very strong, as evidenced by continued growth in liquidity and reserves as well as adherence to
formal fiscal policies, conservative multi-year budgeting and capital planning.
Massachusetts cities have an Institutional Framework score of Aa, which is high compared to the nation. Institutional Framework scores
measure a sector's legal ability to increase revenues and decrease expenditures. Massachusetts cities major revenue source, property
taxes, are subject to the Proposition 2 1/2 cap which can be overriden with voter approval only. However, the cap of 2.5% still allows
for moderate revenue-raising ability. Unpredictable revenue fluctuations tend to be minor, or under 5% annually. Across the sector,
fixed and mandated costs are generally greater than 25% of expenditures. However, Massachusetts has public sector unions, which can
limit the ability to cut expenditures. Unpredictable expenditure fluctuations tend to be minor, under 5% annually.

AAA

Analytical Conclusion
The city's 'AAA' GO bond rating and Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflect our expectation for
Cambridge to maintain healthy financial flexibility through economic cycles, consistent with a
history of strong operating performance and budget controls. The city's superior financial
profile reflects a wealthy and growing property tax base, moderate expenditure growth and
demonstrated ability to reduce expenditures during economic downturns.
Fitch Ratings expects long-term liabilities to remain moderately low based on manageable
capital needs, rapid principal amortization and a practice of fully funding actuarially determined
pension contributions.
Economic Resource Base: Cambridge is located in Middlesex County across the Charles
River from the city of Boston and has an estimated 2016 census population of 110,651, which
is up 5% since 2010.

Key Rating Drivers
Revenue Framework: 'aaa'
Revenues are derived primarily from property taxes. Total general fund revenue growth of
about 4.7% annually over the past 10 years has exceeded both U.S. GDP and CPI for the
same period, reflecting property tax levy increases and strong growth in Cambridge's economy
and tax base. The city maintains significant excess levy capacity under the state's Proposition
2 1/2 law, and Fitch expects revenue growth to remain strong.
Expenditure Framework: 'aa'
The natural pace of spending growth is expected by Fitch to be in line with to below natural
revenue growth over time. Carrying costs for long-term liabilities claim a moderate proportion
of governmental spending. Principal amortization rates are rapid at 80% over 10 years, and a
large portion of debt is self-supporting from user charges.

Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa'
Cambridge's debt and unfunded net pension liabilities are moderately low at roughly 8% of
estimated personal income. Fitch anticipates Cambridge's long-term liability burden to remain
close to this level based on a manageable capital plan and a record of actuarially based
pension funding.

Careful expenditure management, combined with moderate tax levy increases and
conservative financial forecasting, has led to very high reserves over the past decade. Fitch
expects management to maintain a strong level of financial resilience through a typical
economic cycle, with the reserves supplementing superior inherent budget flexibility.

Rating Sensitivities
Expenditure Management: The IDR is sensitive to maintenance of the city's solid expenditure
flexibility. Material reductions in the city's ability to manage spending, while unexpected, could
pressure the rating.

Credit Profile
The city is an important economic component of the Boston metropolitan area and
Massachusetts as a whole, and benefits from the presence of both Harvard University and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These institutions are the city's two top employers.
Other major employers include the city, Biogen, Novartis and Mt. Auburn Hospital.
Cambridge continues to maintain and strengthen its position as a national leader in the life
sciences and high-tech sectors. Expansion in these sectors has contributed to tax base,
employment and resident income growth over the past several years, and is projected by the
city to continue for at least the near future.
Cambridge also continues to attract research and development companies, ranging from
startups to international companies. Several major software and internet companies have
established research and development operations in Cambridge, including Microsoft, Google,
Amazon, Facebook and EMC/VMware.
Assessed value (AV) performance reflects this activity, as well as growth in residential values.
AV grew 10% in fiscal 2018 to $43.6 billion, following growth of 14% in fiscal 2017. AV per
capita is a very high $394,000. Economic development districts located in the city continue to
provide opportunities for current and future economic expansion and new housing opportunities.
The city projects moderate increases in AV in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, which Fitch
considers realistic based on new commercial and residential construction underway.
The city’s wealth levels are above state and national averages, and its unemployment rate has
consistently been below that of Massachusetts and the U.S.

Revenue Framework
Property taxes make up approximately 63% of fiscal 2017 general fund revenues. Sewer use
charges and other departmental charges accounted for 8% and 11%, respectively. Excise
taxes on hotels, meals and motor vehicles, and payments in lieu of taxes add an additional 5%
to the general fund revenue base.

Fitch expects revenue growth to continue to be strong based on the city's solid underlying
economic fundamentals and expectations for future tax base growth from new commercial and
residential projects.
Pursuant to state law, Proposition 2 1/2 limits the city's ability to levy property taxes by: 1) a
“levy ceiling”, an absolute cap on the level of property taxation, set at 2.5% of the overall
property tax valuation (primary limit); and 2) a levy limit that restricts the annual growth in
taxation to 2.5% over the previous year's levy plus the value of new growth (secondary limit).
Taxation in excess of the levy limit (plus any new growth) requires voter approval.

Operating Performance: 'aaa'

1.1.b

Public Finance

Expenditure Framework
Education is the city's largest expenditure, representing 35% of fiscal 2017 general fund
expenses. Public safety follows at 23%.
General fund expenditure growth has historically been in line with or slower than revenue
growth, and the city has flexibility to reduce expenditures if necessary. Fitch expects growth to
continue at this pace.
Carrying costs for debt service, pensions and OPEB contributions were a moderate 16% of
fiscal 2017 governmental spending, and Fitch expects such costs to remain moderate going
forward. Employee salary and benefit costs as well as moderate annual increases in debt
service continue to drive annual expenditure increases. Management has negotiated increases
in healthcare contributions from certain employee groups, which should help control growth in
these costs. Education will continue to be a driver of spending, and management is planning
moderate annual increases in education spending over the next five years as part of its
commitment to the overall improvement of its school system and to accommodate projected
enrollment growth.
Approximately 75% of the city's 3,500 employees belong to a union or collective bargaining
group. Management has the ability to impose employee layoffs and furloughs if necessary.
Public-safety contracts are subject to arbitration, although City Council has the ability to vote
down an award. In such a case, both parties continue bargaining within the arbitration process.

Long-Term Liability Burden
Long-term liabilities for debt and unfunded pension liabilities are moderately low at roughly 8%
of estimated personal income, which is at the high end of the 'aaa' range for this metric. Fitch
does not expect the burden to materially change based on pension funding practices and future
debt plans. Management is projecting the issuance of an additional $393 million in additional
debt (about 65% of current debt levels) over the next four fiscal years, with roughly 23% to be
supported from user fees. The city's principal amortization rate for bonds and notes outstanding
is very rapid at 80% over 10 years. Outstanding debt net of self-supporting debt accounts for
one-half of the liability metric, with unfunded pension liabilities making up the remainder. The
rapid amortization rate and expectations for growth in personal income also support Fitch's
view that long-term liabilities should remain low.
The city is one of four employers participating in the Cambridge Retirement System. The city
has paid annual contributions slightly in excess of its actuarially determined contribution (ADC)
since fiscal 2010 to improve funding levels. The fiduciary net position to total pension liabilities
for the city's portion was reported at 83% as of June 30, 2017. Using Fitch's more conservative
6% investment rate of return, the estimated funded ratio was 69%.
The city's unfunded OPEB liability totaled $620 million as of June 30, 2016 and represented
6.6% of personal income. The liability increased by $59 million primarily because of changes in
the discount rate to 3.68% from 4.5% used for the prior year's valuation. City management
created an OPEB trust fund in December 2009 and has made annual contributions totaling
$13 million since that time; the fund had an asset value of $15 million as of Dec. 31, 2017.

Management has typically levied below the ceiling each year. Any excess in levy capacity is
carried forward and available for use at any time. The city's excess tax levy limit increased to
$181 million in fiscal 2018 from $168 million for fiscal 2017. This excess levy capacity totals
29% of the fiscal 2018 operating budget and provides for substantial revenue-raising flexibility if
needed.

1.1.b

Public Finance

Management projects a $2 million annual contribution to the trust for each of the next four fiscal
years, based on the city's current financial forecast.

Fitch expects the city to maintain strong financial resilience through an economic cycle, given
its historically strong revenue performance, conservative budgeting practices and superior
degree of inherent budget flexibility. For details, see Scenario Analysis, page 5.
During times of economic weakness, management has controlled spending and staffing levels
to offset reductions in revenues. The city's strong budget monitoring practices and financial
planning bolster the city's operating environment.
The general fund had a fiscal 2017 net operating surplus of $31.9 million (5.5% of spending on
a GAAP basis), due in part to positive variances in excise taxes, payments in lieu of taxes and
license and permit fees. Conservative expenditure assumptions resulted in savings in most
categories. Unrestricted fund balance improved to $330 million, or a very high 57% of spending.
The fiscal 2018 operating budget of $605 million was up 5% over the adjusted fiscal 2017
budget. Increases in spending were associated in part with higher salary and pension costs
and increases in debt service. Management is projecting positive fiscal year-end results based
on estimated expenditure savings compared to budget and higher than anticipated hotel, meals
and motor vehicle excise taxes and building permit fees due to conservative assumptions. Fitch
expects the city to continue to manage its budget in a way that supports an exceptionally
strong financial position through the economic cycle.

Reserve Safety Margin in an Unaddressed Stress

Actual

70.0%

Fitch expects the city to maintain strong financial resilience throughout an
economic cycle given its historically strong revenue performance, conservative
budgeting practices and superior degree of inherent budget flexibility. The
city's steady growth in revenues has supported surplus operations over the
past five fiscal years and a buildup of reserves to high levels.

Notes: Scenario analysis represents an unaddressed stress on issuer finances. Fitch's downturn scenario assumes a -1.0% GDP decline in the first year, followed by 0.5% and 2.0% GDP growth in Years 2
and 3, respectively. Expenditures are assumed to grow at a 2.0% rate of inflation. Inherent budget flexibility is the analyst's assessment of the issuer's ability to deal with fiscal stress through tax and
spending policy choices, and determines the multiples used to calculate the reserve safety margin. For further details, please see Fitch's US Tax-Supported Rating Criteria.

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'AAA' rating and stable outlook to Cambridge, Mass.' series 2018A and 2018B general
obligation (GO) municipal-purpose loan bonds and affirmed its 'AAA' rating, with a stable outlook, on the city's existing
GO debt.
The series 2018A bonds will be part of the minibond program, which is available to Cambridge residents.
Under our criteria, titled "Ratings Above The Sovereign: Corporate And Government Ratings—Methodology And
Assumptions," published Nov, 19, 2013, on Ratings Direct, we rate Cambridge higher than the sovereign because we
believe the city can maintain better credit characteristics than the nation in a stress scenario based on its
predominantly locally derived revenue base and our view that pledged revenue supporting bond debt service is at
limited risk of negative sovereign intervention. In 2017, local property taxes generated 64% of revenue, which
demonstrated a lack of dependence on central government revenue,

The city's full-faith-and-credit pledge, subject to Proposition 2 1/2 limitations, secures the bonds. Despite limitations
imposed by the commonwealth's levy-limit law, we did not make a rating distinction for the limited-tax-GO pledge due
to the city's flexibility under the levy limit.
We understand officials intend to use series 2018A and 2018B bond proceeds to fund various citywide projects,
including school renovations and sewer improvements.

• Very strong budgetary flexibility, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2017 of 52% of operating expenditures, and
the flexibility to raise additional revenue despite commonwealthwide tax caps;
• Very strong liquidity, with total government available cash at 68.8% of total-governmental-fund expenditures and
7.5x governmental debt service, and access to external liquidity we consider strong;
• Adequate debt-and-contingent-liability position, with debt service carrying charges at 9.1% of expenditures and net

market value and rapid amortization, with 80,1% of debt scheduled to be retired within 10 years, but significant
• Strong institutional framework score.

Very strong economy
We consider Cambridge's economy very strong. The city, with an estimated population of 111,587, is in Middlesex
County in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton MSA, which we consider broad and diverse. The city has a projected per
capita effective buying income of 161% of the national level and per capita market value of $390,898. Overall, market
value has grown by 10.1% over the past year to $43.6 billion in fiscal 2018. The county unemployment rate was 3% in
2016.
Directly north of Boston, Cambridge is extremely plugged into the area economy with two subway lines, multiple
highways, and a commuter rail, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), its two leading
employers, anchor the local economy and serve as knowledge centers and focal points for dozens ofstart-ups,
research centers, and life-science and high-technology companies.
Other leading employers include Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research; Mount Auburn Hospital; and Biogen,
each of which employ upward of 2,000. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Kayak, Baxalta, Pfizer,
Sanofi/Genzyme, and Takeda/Millennium have offices in the city.
Economic expansion continues, particularly in the biotechnology and technology sectors; this has contributed to
sustained property tax base growth. Over the previous three years, the city has averaged 13.5% growth. The tax base
is about 61% residential and 36% commercial and industrial. The 10 leading taxpayers account for 20% of the tax base,
indicating moderate taxpayer concentration. Officials report a number of developments they expect will have a
positive effect on the tax base, including the addition of almost 1,200 housing units throughout Cambridge and the
construction of more than $ 1 billion of commercial space.
MIT has agreed to purchase the former Volpe Transportation Research Center site from the US. General Services
Administration. It will develop this site into commercial space totaling $1,7 million and residential space totaling $1.1
million. Over the long term, while we do not expect the Volpe center to greatly affect the city's property tax revenue,
we believe it will likely aid continued economic growth,

medium-term debt plans and a large pension and other-postemployment-benefit (OPEB) obligation; and

Very strong management
We view the city's management as very strong, with strong financial policies and practices under our FMA
methodology, indicating financial practices are strong, well embedded, and likely sustainable.
Key factors include management's:
• Conservative revenue and expenditure assumptions in the budgeting process that focus on five years of historical

information;
• Quarterly reports on budget-to-actual results and investments to the city's finance and investment committees,
respectively;
• Long-term financial plan with credible assumptions;
• Five-year capital plan with identified funding sources, which it is expanding to include a
municipal-facilities-improvementplan;
• Robust debt and investment policy it reviews at least annually to demonstrate adherence; and

Strong budgetary performance
Cambridge's budgetary performance is strong, in our opinion. The city had operating surpluses of 5.4% of expenditures
in the general fund and 5.4% of expenditures across all governmental funds in fiscal 2017. Our assessment accounts for
the fact that we expect budgetary results could moderate somewhat from fiscal 2017 results but remain above break
even over the next few fiscal years,

We adjusted the data for recurring transfers and the spending of bond proceeds. Property taxes generated 64% of total
general fund revenue in fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2018 operating budget increased by 4.97% over fiscal 2017 to $605
million due largely to a 2.5% increase in salary costs, a $2 million budgeted allocation to the OPEB trust fund, and a
5.85% increase in employee pension costs. The city used $12.2 million in surplus cash to lower the property tax
increase, which it expects to make up through better-than-budgeted results in fiscal 2018. According to city officials,
revenue and expenditures are on budget.

We believe rising debt-service costs and increasing health insurance, with cost increases as high as 7% in fiscal 2021,
will continue to pressure the budget, However, we expect astute management, with regular oversight and planning,
will likely shield the budget from cost pressure. Therefore, we expect our assessment of budgetary performance will
likely remain strong.

Very strong budgetary flexibility
Cambridge's budgetary flexibility is very strong, in our view, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2017 of 52% of
operating expenditures, or $303.6 million. The city has the flexibility to raise additional revenue despite
commonwealthwide tax caps; we expect available fund balance to remain above 30% of expenditures for the current
and next fiscal years, which we view as positive credit factors.
Budgetary flexibility remains very strong with no plans to spend down reserves materially. We include the
budget-stabilization fund in our calculations; this fund has grown in each of the past three fiscal years, and it currently
has a balance of $49.2 million. In addition, Cambridge's excess levy capacity, which increased by 7,7% year over year
to $168.3 million in fiscal 2017, provides additional flexibility.

Attachment: 02262018 SP Cambridge MA report 2018 (CMA 2018 #36 : AAA bond rating)

• Reserve policy that requires maintaining a minimum 15% of expenditures.

Very strong liquidity
In our opinion, Cambridge's liquidity is very strong, with total government available cash at 68.8% of
total-governmental-fund expenditures and 7.5x governmental debt service in fiscal 2017. In our view, the city has
strong access to external liquidity if necessary.
Cambridge is a regular market participant that has issued GO bonds frequently over the past several years. We

Summary: Cambridge, Massachusetts; General Obligation

understand the city has not entered into any bank loans, direct-purchase debt, or contingent-liquidity risks from
financial instruments with payment provisions that change upon the occurrence of certain events. It has consistently
had very strong liquidity; we do not expect a change to these ratios, which is consistent with our view of the city's
strong performance.

Adequate debt-and-contingent-liability profile
In our view, Cambridge's debt-and-contingent-liability profile is adequate. Total-governmental-fund debt service is

Overall net debt is low at 0.9% of market value and approximately 80.1% of direct debt is scheduled to be repaid
within 10 years, which are, in our view, positive credit factors. Negatively affecting our view of the city's debt profile is
its significant medium-term debt plans,
Cambridge has $515 million of total direct debt outstanding, $145 million of which is self-supporting water and sewer
debt. Over the next four fiscal years, the city currently expects to issue $392.6 million, $194 million of which it will
issue within our two-year outlook period. The majority of debt will fund elementary school reconstruction and sewer
improvements.

In our opinion, Cambridge's large pension and OPEB obligation is a credit weakness. Cambridge's combined required
pension and actual OPEB contribution totaled 8% of total-governmental-fund expenditures in fiscal 2017. Of that
amount, 4.8% represented required contributions to pension obligations and 3.2% represented OPEB payments. The
city made its full annual required pension contribution in fiscal 2017, The funded ratio of the largest pension plan is
83.1%.

Cambridge is part of Cambridge Retirement System, which is a member of the Massachusetts Contributory System,
The city has always contributed 100% of the actuarial determined contribution, which was $30 million in fiscal 2017.
Using updated reporting standards in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement Nos. 67
and 68, the city's net pension liability was about $236 million with 83% funded at June 30, 2017, based on an assumed
rate of return of 7.75%. Cambridge officials expect to fund the pension liability fully by fiscal 2026.
At June 30, 2017, the city reported an OPEB unfunded actuarially accrued liability of $609 million. In 2015, the city
established an irrevocable trust fund, which has a current balance of $15.3 million. Officials expect to add $2 million to
the trust annually between fiscal years 2019 and 2022, While we consider prefunding the OPEB liability positively,
Cambridge's large and growing OPEB liabilities could pressure the long-term budget.

Strong institutional framework
The institutional framework score for Massachusetts municipalities is strong.

Attachment: 02262018 SP Cambridge MA report 2018 (CMA 2018 #36 : AAA bond rating)

9.1% of total-governmental-fund expenditures, and net direct debt is 55.6% of total-governmental-fund revenue,

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' opinion of Cambridge's healthy and growing economy, which has
aided in continued strong financial performance, supported by very strong management. We understand Cambridge
currently expects to issue a significate amount of debt over the next few years; we, however, do not expect financial
performance to deteriorate. Therefore, we do not expect to change the rating within the next two years because we

believe Cambridge will likely sustain current financial performance and comparably high reserves. While unlikely to
occur, we could lower the rating if fund balance were to deteriorate significantly or if debt were to weaken
substantially.

New Voting Equipment
Lisa Peterson, Deputy City Manager

The Election Commission recently purchased 38 ImageCast Precinct Tabulators and operating software to
replace the existing equipment which was purchased in 1996. The contract was awarded to LHS Associates in
the amount of $332,900. LHS Associates is a company which the Election Commission has worked with in the
past. In 1996 the City of Cambridge implemented use of a computerized voting system. That equipment was
also purchased from LHS Associates. The new voting equipment has been certified for use for elections in
Massachusetts by the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Elections Division.
The new voting equipment will be capable of processing both the traditional, “plurality” type system of voting
as well as the proportional representation or “preference” type voting system. LHS will also acquire the
software/modification needed to suit PR elections. LHS Associates will provide orientation, installation, testing,
poll worker training and onsite election supervision. The software for our PR election is currently underway and
should be ready for testing and certification over the next year. However, the existing software and equipment is
capable of being used for the 2018 State Primary and General Election. The Election Commissioners and I
believe that the 2018 elections would be the best time to introduce the new system to the voters of Cambridge.
Prior to utilizing the new equipment for the upcoming elections, the city council must vote to discontinue use of
the existing equipment and approve the use of the new voting machines. The vote must be one hundred and
twenty days (120) prior to the next election. The State Primary will be held on Tuesday, September 4, 2018.
According to MGL Chapter 54 Section 34“ A city of town may, by vote of a majority of the city council or by
majority of the board of selectman, at a meeting held at least one hundred and twenty days before the primary,
preliminary election or election at which voting machines are to be used, determine upon and purchase, lease,
and order the use of thereof at the primaries, preliminary election and elections of state, city or town officers in
such city or town; and thereafter at all primaries and elections of state, city or town officers in that city or town,
until otherwise ordered by the city council in a city…”
I am requesting an opportunity to present LHS Associates and the new voting equipment to the City Council so
that the Council can evaluate the product prior to voting.

Inman Square

In response to the Council Order O-5, dated February 12th, regarding Inman Square, staff report
the following:
We recognize that the decision to move forward with the current option for the redesign of
Inman Square has raised questions from community members, many of which were too detailed
or complex to answer during the public meeting held on January 30th. As a result, we are happy
to provide additional opportunities to talk with staff and the consultant team about the analysis
that was performed and the decision that we reached, in parallel with our work to move forward
the design of the new plaza space.
UPCOMING COMMUNITY MEETING AND OPEN HOUSES:
As part of the on-going design process for the Inman Square project, there are several upcoming
opportunities for the community to learn more about the Inman Square project, review the
technical analysis with staff, and provide input into the design of the reconfigured plaza.

February 26, 2018
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to seek your approval with regard to a request the City of Cambridge has received
from BMR-21 Erie Street, LLC (“BMR”) for an aerial license for a structural canopy to be
constructed over a portion of the public sidewalk in front of property located at 21 Erie Street.
The canopy structure and building address signage letters mounted on top of the canopy will
overhang a portion of the City-owned sidewalk along Erie Street and along BMR’s property
located at 21 Erie Street. There will be no illuminated signs installed on the canopy structure.
The license area in which the proposed canopy will be constructed will have a width of 14.00
feet (parallel to the public way), a length of 3.40 feet (projecting into the public way) and a
height of 12.50 feet high (as measured from the sidewalk). As the requested license area is
slightly larger than the proposed dimensions of the canopy and sign, allowing for a construction
“factor of safety,” the bottom of the canopy is designed to measure 10’-4’’ above the sidewalk,
and the canopy and building address letters are designed to have a combined height of 2’0,’’ to
be constructed within the proposed 12.50 foot height of the license area. The total weight of the
canopy structure and building address sign is estimated at 1,550 lbs. The total requested license
area is five hundred and ninety-five cubic feet (595 cu. ft). The requested license area is
depicted in the “License Plan of Land” attached hereto. In addition to the License Plan of Land,
BMR has provided the following documents: (i) a color rendering of the design of the proposed
canopy; (ii) a color photograph of the existing canopy proposed to be removed; (iii) a
plan/drawing of the proposed canopy; and (iv) a plan/drawing showing the sign dimensions. All
of these documents and plans are attached hereto for your consideration and approval. The
Director of Assessing has determined the annual fee for Fiscal Year 2018 shall be $500.
In accordance with the Cambridge Municipal Code, the plans and renderings have been reviewed
by various City departments (Police, Fire, Water, Community Development, Public Works
(including the City Engineer), Electrical, and Traffic, Parking and Transportation). I deemed it
appropriate to transmit this license request to the City Council for its consideration pursuant to

Packet Pg. 79

1.9

Section 12.12.200, which allows for maintenance over the public way of a structural canopy
when a permit therefor has been authorized by the City Council. I believe that the information
furnished in this letter is sufficient to enable the City Council to make a determination on this
matter.
I recommend that the City Council vote to authorize me to grant a license, in such form and
substance as I deem appropriate, for the installation of a structural canopy at this location.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale

Awaiting Report #6, dated September 18, 2017
Re: Enforcement of Idling Trains in Residential Areas

Dear Sir:
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report #6, dated September 18, 2017 whereby you
were requested to enforce anti-idling in residential areas, specifically pertaining to idling trains, and report
back to the Council.
We have reviewed the situation and put together the following overview of the measures taken in response
to this order:
Per the state regulation, the Cambridge Police Department would have enforcement powers for a violation
of the diesel locomotive idling regulation—310 CMR 7.11(2). When the statute is enforced by local police,
District Court guidance on this issue indicates that the maximum penalty may be only $50 for such
violations, which may not be a strong deterrent to the train companies and, in our experience, may
therefore make it difficult to enforce.
There is a statutory method of enforcement that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) could
follow pursuant to G.L.c.111, §142B, by issuing an order to stop or abate the violation of the idling
regulation. Violation of such an order carries a penalty of imprisonment not more than 1 year; or a fine or
civil penalty of not more than $25,000; or both. DEP has indicated that its enforcement authority under
that statute would not apply to enforcement measures available to local police. DEP does not itself
typically enforces violations such as this.

work that is currently underway regarding regulating adult use marijuana and
to suggest next steps to the Council no later than February 26, 2018.
Dear Mr. DePasquale:
This is in response to the two above-referenced Council Orders relating to the use
of marijuana in the City.

Council Order No. 0-9 of 9/18/17 contains two orders: 1) how the City views its
obligations and constraints regarding marijuana enforcement and regulation, and 2)

whether the City's existing tobacco ordinance, Cambridge City Code Chapter 8.28,
includes restrictions on marijuana usage, and if not, to suggest an ordinance amendment to
restrict marijuana usage.
I.

Responses to Council Order No, 0-9 of 9/18/17

With respect to the first Order contained within Order No. 0-9 of 9/18/17, the
Police Department has provided a separate response to the issues related to existing law
enforcement.

With respect to the second Order contained within Order No. 0-9 of 9/18/17, we
provide the following response. Chapter 8.28 of the Cambridge City Code, which regulates
the use of tobacco in Cambridge, does not apply to the use of marijuana. The "Purpose"
section of Chapter 8.28 (§8.28.010) refers only to the regulation of tobacco. There are

"cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, nicotine delivery product, snuff or
tobacco in any of its forms." "Smoking" is defined at §8.28.050 as: "Inhaling, exhaling,
burning or carrying any lighted cigarette, cigar, pipe tobacco, nicotine delivery product,
snuff or tobacco in any manner or in any form." In later sections of Chapter 8.28, smoking
is prohibited in workplaces, certain public places, and in restaurants.

Chapter 8.28, at §8.28.080, prohibits tobacco smoking in many public places,
including certain "public park restricted areas," which are specifically listed in the

ordinance. Smoking is specifically allowed by Chapter 8.28 in many of the parks and
plazas listed in that section.

Although the City s existing tobacco ordinance does not apply to marijuana usage,
the state law that relates to smoking in public places (G.L.c.270, §22) was amended by
St.2017, c.55, §46, effective July 28, 2017, to apply also to the smoking of marijuana.
That statute prohibits marijuana and tobacco smoking in workplaces, restaurants, public
buildings, and many other places. It also provides for local enforcement.

If the City Council would like marijuana smoking regulated or restricted differently
than what has been established under G.L. c. 270, §22, the Law Department could provide

a draft ordinance for the Council's consideration based on policy decisions made by the
Council. Similarly, if the City Council would like to restrict indoor marijuana smoking
even more strictly than is currently done by G.L.c.270, §22, the Law Department can draft
an ordinance that would include such provisions. Because state law has now been amended

to address the regulation of some of the activities inquired about by the City Council in this
Council Order, it would be helpful to have guidance from the City Council as to what
additional provisions the Council would like to have regulated by the Cambridge City
Code.

II. Response to Council Order No. 0-2 of 1/29/18
Council Order No. 0-2 of 1/29/18 makes a related request, for a report on work
underway regarding regulating the adult use of marijuana.
In response to Council Order No. 0-2 of 1/29/18 concerning other aspects of
regulating the adult use of marijuana, there are many issues for the Council to consider.
As an initial caveat, however, it is important to note that the state's Cannabis Control

Commission ("the CCC") has issued very complex and lengthy draft regulations (to be
promulgated at 935 CMR 500.000) to implement the new adult use of marijuana statutes.
Those regulations have been the subject of a multitude of public comments and questions,

and it is probable that the draft regulations will be revised before they are finalized.
Therefore, it would probably be a good idea for the Council not to adopt any local
ordinance provisions until the state draft regulations regarding the adult use of marijuana
have been finalized.

For the Council's information, I have attached hereto "Guidelines for Municipalities Regarding Marijuana
for Adult Use" prepared by the CCC as well as the City's Comments on the Draft Regulations that were

Attachment: Marijuana response NEG with attachments (CMA 2018 #46 : AR Response RE: marijuana enforcement and regulations)

references throughout Chapter 8.28 to tobacco products, which are defined at §8.28.020 as:

Packet Pg. 95

Certain deadlines for state action on the adult use of marijuana are set forth in
St.2017, c.55, §55. That law requires the CCC to: "promulgate regulations, guidelines and
protocols necessary for the issuance of licenses pursuant to chapter 94G of the General

Laws2 not later than March 15, 2018. Thus, March 15, 2018 is the deadline for the CCC to
finalize its draft regulations. The next statutory deadline requires the CCC "to begin to

accept applications for licenses pursuant to said chapter 94G not later than April 1, 2018.
The CCC "shall not issue a license pursuant to chapter 94G of the General Laws until June

1,2018." St2017,c.55,§56(c).
There are many aspects of the new laws and draft regulations that allow for, and in
some cases require, local action in connection with the adult use of marijuana. These
issues are complex, and the state regulations that will govern them are not finalized, but

following is a list of some of the issues the City is expected to have to address:
a. Zoning. There is currently no zoning ordinance provision that specifically
governs the cultivation, manufacture, retail sale, or on-site usage of marijuana

that is not medically prescribed. Zoning Ordinance section 11 .800 applies to
medical marijuana only, requiring applicants for dispensaries to obtain a special
permit from the Planning Board based on a number of considerations.
b. Taxation. One of the many state laws that was amended as part of the adult
use of marijuana legislation was G.L.C.64N, §3, which as a local option, allows
a city or town that accepts that law to:
...impose a local sales tax upon sale or transfer of marijuana or

marijuana products by a marijuana retailer operating within the city
or town to anyone other than a marijuana establishment at a rate not

greater than 3 per cent of the total sales price received by the
marijuana retailer as a consideration for the sale of marijuana or
marijuana products.

No action is required by the City if the City does not want to tax marijuana sales.
c. Host Community Agreements. The new law requires that every new adult use
of marijuana establishment and every existing medical marijuana dispensary
that wants to expand to have an adult use business must enter into a host
community agreement with the municipality in which they are located.
G.L.c.940, §3(d). Pursuant to that statute, a host community agreement "may
include a community impact fee for the host community" as long as the fee is
reasonably related to documented costs imposed on the community by the
operation of the marijuana establishment, is no more than 3% of the gross sales
of the marijuana establishment and is payable for no more than 5 years.

submitted by the City Manager to the CCC on February 14,2018. The draft regulations, which are 107 pages,
can be found on the CCC's website at: https://www.mass.gov/orgs/cannabis-control-commission.

2 G.L.C.94G is entitled "Regulation of the Use and Distribution of Marijuana Not Medically Prescribed."

ordinances that impose reasonable safeguards on the operation of marijuana
establishments, provided they are not unreasonably impracticable and are not in
conflict with state statutes or regulations. If a municipality such as Cambridge

wants to (i) prohibit the operation of 1 or more types of marijuana
establishments within the city; (h) limit the number of marijuana retailers to
fewer than 20 per cent of the number of licenses issued within the city for the

retail sale of alcoholic beverages not to be drunk on the premises; or (iii) limit
the number of any type of marijuana establishment to fewer than the number of
medical marijuana treatment centers registered to engage in the same type of
activity in the city or town; then the City must submit any such ordinance for
approval to the voters before adopting the ordinance.
e. Other Local Approvals. Other local requirements could potentially be
imposed, for example, through: local health regulations; local licensing
requirements imposed on existing or new business licensees who want to carry
on an adult use of marijuana component of their business; local weights and
measures approval of scales and of methods of weighing and measuring
marijuana; and police approval of security measures to be implemented.
As stated above, because the CCC has not finalized the state regulations that will
apply to licensing and operations of the adult use of marijuana, there remains a good deal
of uncertainty about the nature and scope of issues that will need to be addressed in the
future at the local level.

Re: DRAFT REGULATIONS
City of Cambridge Comments on Draft Regulations on Adult Use of Marijuana
Dear Commission Members,

I hereby submit the comments and questions of the City of Cambridge on the Draft 935 CMR
500.000 "Adult Use of Marijuana" regulations approved by the Cannabis Control Commission on
December 21,2017.
The City of Cambridge believes that it would be helpful if the regulations could be clarified as
they relate to the following questions:
Marijuana Establishment Types
* Can local communities prohibit, through zoning or other municipal ordinances, the cultivation or
manufacturing of marijuana products, if marijuana retailers are allowed?
• Can local communities place prohibitions, limits, or controls on Marijuana Social Consumption
Establishments through zoning or other municipal ordinances? Are there limitations on local
controls, as there are for other marijuana retailers?

• Will Medical Marijuana Dispensaries have requirements for Host Community Agreements, as
with other marijuana establishments?
• Will there be any local review process for Marijuana Transporter licenses?
Marijuana Establishment Locations

• The buffer standards in Section 500.10 1 (A)(I )(h)(i) differ from those in Section 500.110(C).
Does the buffer apply only to public and private schools, or also to daycare centers and other
facilities " in which children commonly congregate"?
• Can local corn munities establish required distances from other types of land uses or districts
through zoning?
Marityana Establishment Operations
• Are there measures to control the processing, packaging, or repackaging of marijuana products
within a retail marijuana establishment? Can local regulations control or prevent this type of
activity?
• The draft regulations specify no smoking in Marijuana Social Consumption Establishments
before October, 2018. What requirements will apply after that time? Do prohibitions on smoking
also apply to vaporizing?

• Will there be statewide standards for the suitability of scales used in marijuana packaging, and for
the packaging/labeling of marijuana product quantities? Will these be subject to local oversight?
• What checks will be in place for products that are packaged in one community then transported
and sold in another community?
Health Information to Consumers

• Will marijuana establishments be required to provide information on dosing, controlling access to
edibles, and other public health and safety issues?
• Can local agencies require marijuana establishments to provide public health information in
addition to the information required by the CCC?
Enforcement

• How will compliance with restrictions on sales to people under 21 be enforced? Will state or local
regulators be responsible for compliance checks? How will they be funded?
• Will prohibitions on smoking in marijuana establishments be enforced in the same manner as
prohibitions on smoking in workplaces? Will state or local agencies be responsible for oversight?
• How are Host Community Agreements meant to be enforced? Will violations be reported to and
enforced by the Cannabis Control Commission?
• Are the representations made by potential licensees at required community hearings meant to be
binding? If a licensee does not fulfill commitments made at a community hearing, could the
Cannabis Control Commission take enforcement action?
Thank you for your consideration of these issues.

Background on 2016 and 2017 Laws on Marijuana for Adult Use in Massachusetts
On November 8, 2016, Massachusetts voters voted 53% in favor of a ballot initiative known as
"Question 4" authorizing the limited adult use of marijuana and the licensing of marijuana
establishments, amongst other things. The ballot initiative became Chapter 334 of the Acts of
2016 fhttp^://m<)ic^isl<tUire.HOv/Laws/Sessioni.aws/Acts/20!6/('htiptcr334) and created the

"Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, G.L. c.94G F2016 Marijuana Act*').
In December 2016, the Massachusetts Legislature passed Chapter 351 of the Acts of 2016
fhflps://n^femst9ture.g('}v/Lciw<-;/SeyyionL<nvs/Acls/2016/Chaplcr35 3). Chapter 351

accomplished a number of things. First, it exempted the cultivation of marijuana from the
agricultural exemption in the Zoning Act, G.L. c,40A §3, therefore retaining local control over
the placement of marijuana establishments. It also delayed the deadlines set in Chapter 334 for
six months to allow the Legislature time to amend Chapter 334 (the timeline above reflects the
delayed dates). It also required the Department of Public Health to enter into an agreement with a
research entity to conduct a comprehensive baseline study of marijuana use in the
commonwealth, including a survey of: (i) patterns of use, methods of consumption and general
perceptions of marijuana; (ii) incidents of impaired driving and hospitalization related to
marijuana use; and (iii) economic and fiscal impacts for state and local governments, which shall
include the impact of legalization on the production and distribution of marijuana in the illicit
market as well as costs and benefits to state and local revenue. DPH is required to submit a
report of its fmdings to the Chairs of the Senate and House Committees on Ways and Means and
the Senate and House Chairs of die Joint Committee on Public Health not later than July 1,2018.
On July 19,2017, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a bill (H.3818) to amend Chapter 334
and the law it created^ G.L. c.94G, as well as create additional laws relating to adult and medical

use of marijuana. The bill became Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017
(liTtps;//ina!egJslatui'c^ov/Li:i\vis/Sc'ssion!-.aws/Acl&/20i7/C'haptcr55) ('l2017 Marijuana Act").
The 2017 Act built upon the foundation of the 2016 Act, creating a five-person Cannabis Control
Commission, a twenty-five person Cannabis Advisory Board, as well as a hemp program to be
run by the Department of Agricultural Resources. It also placed limits and restrictions on
municipal control over the siting of marijuana establishments that will be discussed in this
Guidance. The deadlines created foy the Legislature in December 2016 remained unchanged. On
December 21, 2017, the newly-formed Cannabis Control Commission approved draft regulations
(hll!2^//www-"^i-^.nov/nics/docutnents/20.t 7/12/22/DfaftRe^iaiionsl 221 i 7.pdQ. The
information presented in this Guidance is based on the 2016 and 2017 Acts (collectively referred

Types of Marijuana Establishments
The Marijuana Acts and the draft regulations create different kinds of marijuana establishments.
Unlike a medical marijuana treatment center, which is required to cultivate, process and retail its
own marijuana and marijuana products, an adult use marijuana establishment may opt only to
participate in a particular part of the industry, such as cultivation. All marijuana establishments
are subject to strict, comprehensive state regulations and inspections by Commission agents. All
marijuana establishments are required to enter into host cominunity agreements with the
municipality in which they are located (there is more detail on host community agreements
below). Only marijuana retailers are subject to the local marijuana tax created under the 2017
Act. One business may hold three licenses in each category, with certain excq)tions:
Marijuana Cvltivator: A marijuana cultivator may cultivate, process and package marijuana,

to deliver marijuana to marijuana establishments and to transfer marijuana to other marijuana
establishments, but not to consumers.

Tier 1: up to 1,000 square feet of canopy;
Tier 2: 1,001 to 5,000 square feet of canopy;
Tier 3; 5,001 to 10,000 square feet of canopy;
Tier 4: 10,001 and over square feet of canopy.
Craft Marijuana Cultivaior Cooperative: a craft marijuana cultivator cooperative must
consist of Massachusetts residents who have formed a limited liability company, limited
liability partnership, or another business structure approved by the Commission to cultivate,
obtain, manufacture, process, package and brand marijuana and marijuana products to
deliver marijuana to marijuana establishments, but not to consumers. A business may only
have one craft marijuana cultivator cooperative license.

Marijuana Product Manufacturer: an entity authorized to obtain, manufacture, process and
package marijuana and marijuana producls, to deliver marijuana and marijuana products to
marijuana establishments and to transfer marijuana and marijuana products to other
marijuana establishments, but not to consumers.

Marijuana Retailer: an entity authorized to purchase and deliver marijuana and marijuana
products from marijuana establishments and to deliver, sell or otherwise transfer marijuana
and marijuana products to marijuana establishments and to consumers.

Storefront Retailer: A marijuana retailer that provides a retail location accessible to
consumers 21 years of age or older or in possession of a registration card demonstrating
that the individual is a registered qualifying patient with the Medical Use of Marijuana
Program, if the retail store is co-located with a medical marijuana treatment center.
DeHvery-Only Retailer: A marijuana retailer that does not provide a retail location
accessible to the public, but is authorized to deliver directly from a marijuana cuitivator

facility may not sell marijuana cultivated under its research license, but may also hold a
marijuana retailer license,

applicants may be awarded licenses, deny an application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or
suspend a license, establish a registration process, based on finding of suitability or approval of
Hcensure, check the backgrounds of individuals associated with applicants or licensees. The
Commission may inspect marijuana establishments, seize and remove from the premises of a
marijuana establishment and impound any marijuana, equipment, supplies, documents and
records obtained or possessed in violation of the law for the puipose of examination and
inspection, inspect all papers, books and records of close associates of a licensee whom the

Commission suspects is involved m the financing, operation or management of the licenseCt

cases for criminal prosecution to the appropriate federal, state or local authorities, monitor any

federal activity regarding marijuana, adopt, amend or repeal regulations for the implementation,
administration and enforcement of the law, and may prepare, publish and distribute studies,
reports, bulletins and other materials.

Role of Municipalities
The Marijuana Acts both authorize and limit the way in which municipalities can control
marijuana establishments in their communities. It also protects any restrictions or limitations a
municipality may have imposed as of July 1, 2017 on the operation of medical marijuana
treatment centers, marijuana establishments or both, pursuant to the 2012 law authorizing
medical use of marijuana (Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012) or the 2016 Act.
Below is a brief overview of provisions relating to municipal control. Any decision to implement
local controls on marijuana should be made in consultation with a municipality's attorney.
Bylaws & Ordinances

The law allows, but does not require, municipalities to pass bylaws and ordinances governing the
"time, place, and manner"' of marijuana establishments (cultivators, retailers, manufacturers,

testing labs, and any other licensed marijuana-related businesses) as well as businesses dealing
with marijuana accessories. Such bylaws and ordinances may not be "unreasonably

impracticable." Under £he definition in the law, this means that the local Jaws cannot be so
difficult to comply with that they would subject licensees to unreasonable risk, or require such a
high investment of risk, money, time or any other resource or asset, that a reasonably prudent

businessperson would not operate a marijuana establishment. Alternatively, a municipality may
determine a proposed marijuana-related use falls under an existing use authorized by its bylaws
or ordinances.

* Camiot Prohibit Conversion from Medical to Adult: Zoning bylaws or ordinances are not
permirted to operate to prevent the conversion of a medical marijuana treatment center

(also known as a registered marijuana dispensary or RMD) licensed or registered not later
than July 1, 2017 that is engaged in the cultivation, manulaclure or sale of marijuana or
marijuana products to a marijuana eslablishmenl for adult use engaged in the same type
of activity. Zoning bylaws or ordinances are also not allowed to limit the number of
marijuana establishments be!ow certain limits unless specific procedures are followed
(see below).
• Nifmber of Marijuana Establishments in a Municipality: A municipality may restrict the
number of marijuana establishments in its community, but it must follow certain
procedures to do so. A municipality may pass a bylaw or ordinance limiting the number
of marijuana retailers to 20% or more of the number of liquor licenses issued pursuant to
G.L. c.l 38 §15 (commonly known as "package stores") in that municipality. For
example, if a municipality has 100 such liquor licenses, that municipality may set a
msximwn limit for 20 marijuana retailers. If the governing body of a municipality seeks
to ban marijuana retailers from operating in the municipality, limit the number of them to
fewer than 20% of the number of liquor licenses or limit the number of any type of
marijuana establishment to fewer than the number of medical marijuana treatment centers
registered to engage m the same type of activity in the city or town, there are two
The mfonnafwn presented in this Guidance is based on Chapter 334 of the Acts of 2016 and Chapter 55 of the Acts
of 2017 (the "Marijuana Acts "), as well as the draft rcguiations published w December, 2017.
After the final regulations are promulgated w March, 2018, this Guidance wi!! be promptly updated.

different procedures for proceeding, which depend on how tlie municipality voted on the
ballot initiative to legalize marijuana in 2016. A list of each municipality voted can be
reviewed here.

o If a municipality voted no on the initiative, then the governing body may limit or
ban the number of marijuana establishment through by passing a bylaw or
ordinance prior to December 3 1,2019.
o If a municipality voted yes on the initiative, then the question must be posed to
the people of the municipality at a regular or special election following a specific
process and wording.

Buffer Zone: Under slate law, a marijuana establishment may not be located within 500
feet of a pre-existing public or private school providing education in kindergarten or any
of grades 1 through 12. Municipalitjes may adopt an ordinance or bylaw to reduce that
distance requirement.

Signage; A municipality may regulate, by bylaw or ordinance, signage regarding
marijuana-related uses, but the ordinance or bylaw may not impose a standard more

restrictive than those applied to retail establishments selling alcoholic beverages within
the municipality.
Transportation: Municipalities are prohibited from barring the transportation of
marijuana or marijuana products or adopting an ordinance or by-law that makes the
transportation of marijuana or marijuana products unreasonably impracticable.

Local Tax
A municipality that accepts the local sales tax option may collect a 3% tax on sales of marijuana
by a marijuana retailer to a consumer. The tax will be collected with other sales tax and
distributed to municipalities at least four times per year.
Host Community Agreements

Under state law, marijuana establishments and medical marijuana treatment centers are required
to execute "host community agreements" with the municipalities in which they operate. The
agreement must stipulate the responsibilities of the community and the marijuana establishment
or medical marijuana treatment centers. The agreement may include a community impact fee of
up to 3% of gross sales to be paid to the host community, as long as the fee is reasonably related
to real costs imposed on the municipality due to the establishment or medical marijuana
treatment center operating there. The agreement may not be effective for longer than five years.
Please note that any cost to a city or town imposed by the operation of a marijuana

Ref.:

Council Order #0-9; Ref: Marijuana Enforcement

In response to Council Order #0-9, dated September 18, 2017, regarding marijuana enforcement and
regulation, I offer the following information.
There are a number of potential civil and criminal legal mechanisms that could be utilized to curb
marijuana smoking, although some of them lack efficient enforcement potential.
• M.G.L. c. 94G, s 13(c) prohibits consumption of marijuana in a public place or smoking marijuana
where smoking tobacco is prohibited. A person who violates this section may be punished by a civil
fine of not more than $100. The problem with this statutory provision is that there is not a traditional
mechanism to collect a fine levied on a violator. If a violator refuses to pay the fine, the City would
have to file a small claims action in Cambridge District Court to collect the fine, which could be time
consuming and expensive.
• Disturbing the Peace. M.G.L. c. 272, s. 53 penalizes a person who engages in objectively annoying
conduct that, in fact, disturbed another citizen. Chronic violators commit the crime of disturbing the
peace once they are aware that their behavior affects another citizen, i.e., in this case a warning from a
police officer that neighbors are complaining. Notably, disturbing the peace does not require noise.
Although an in-presence violation does provide a right of arrest, to pursue a case, officers should
ideally apply for a criminal complaint given the emerging nature of this area of the law. The
maximum penalty for a first offense is only a $150 fine.
• Trespass. M.G.L. c. 266, s. 120 penalizes, in part, a person who remains on another person’s or
organization’s property after being told to leave. The ejection of a person from the property may be
based on the violation of a reasonable rule or condition. The prohibition against marijuana clearly
qualifies. The trespass statute also provides for a right of arrest for an in-presence violation. However,
much like disturbing the peace, to pursue a case in these circumstances, officers should ideally apply
for a criminal complaint. The maximum penalty is not more than thirty days in the house of correction
and/or a $100 fine.

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $164,000 from the Free Cash to the General Fund
Fire Department Extraordinary Expenditures to replace Emergency Medical Service (EMS)
Coats and Bunker Gear Protective Clothing, as discussed in the FY18 budget process.
This appropriation will allow for the replacement of EMS coats for all presently employed
firefighters. EMS coats are worn by fire personnel when responding to medical calls and
performing routine duties such as inspections instead of wearing traditional bunker gear, which is
prohibited. New EMS coats are manufactured with materials that help block blood borne
pathogens. EMS Coats currently worn by most firefighters are at least 15 years old. The
estimated cost of this replacement is $108,000.
In addition, this appropriation will allow for the replacement of 22 sets of bunker gear for present
members with an estimated cost of $56,000. Current standards require that structural bunker and
turnout gear is replaced after a period of ten years. As part of this replacement cycle, 22 sets will
need to be replaced.

FINAL
LANDMARK DESIGNATION REPORT
Hovey & Markham Cottages
40 and 44 Cottage Street, Cambridgeport, Mass.

The Hovey & Markham cottages at 40 and 44 Cottage Street are importantly associated with the economic and social history of Cambridge. Architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham’s completion of the cottages, the first homes built in this block, prompted additional high quality development on this street. Their construction in 1839 was the start of a period of rapid development in the
Cambridgeport neighborhood, which was growing and industrializing in the middle of the nineteenth century. The families that resided in these homes were and are leaders in local businesses and social and service organizations. The cottages are also architecturally significant examples of the Greek Revival style.
The pattern of development set by these homes for this side of the block maximized the usable yard space
by positioning the homes on the far west side of the lots.
If implemented by the City Council, landmark designation would allow the Commission to review and
approve publicly-visible exterior alterations with the goal of protecting the historic integrity of the buildings and their setting. The designation would not regulate use, plant materials, or alterations to interior
features.

Address and Zoning

The Hovey & Markham cottages at 40 and 44 Cottage Street are located on the south side of Cottage Street between Pleasant and Magazine streets. No. 40 Cottage Street occupies a 4,846
square foot lot (Map 104/Lot 92) and 44 Cottage occupies a 4,537 (Map 104/Lot 91). The lots
are located in a Residence C zoning district, which allows single to multi-family dwellings with a
0.60 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limit, 35-foot height limit, and a density of 1,800 square feet per
dwelling unit. The houses both have non-conforming west side and rear setbacks due to a historic
pattern of placement of houses on their lots to maximize yard space.

Ownership and Occupancy

The two properties are separately owned. Robin M. Chase and Roy P. Russell, Jr., leased 40 Cottage Street with an option to purchase beginning in June 1989. They completed the purchase of
from William H. Chafe in July 1994. The deed is recorded in the Middlesex South Registry of
Deeds in Book 24,692/Page 516.
Charles E. Allen Jr. became a co-owner of number 44 with Anne M. Strong in December 1994 as
recorded in a deed at Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in Book 25,092/Page 464. Ms. Strong
had purchased number 44 from Georgianna C. Blasi in June 1992 (Book 22089/Page 78).
The assessed value for land and buildings in 2018 was $1,247,600 for 40 Cottage Street and
$1,420,000 for 44 Cottage Street. Both were originally built as single-family houses but 44
Cottage Street is currently assessed as a two-family and the renovation proposal for 40 Cottage
Street would result in a two-family residence.
C.

Area Description

Cottage Street runs one way from east to west. The First Korean Church (formerly the Pilgrim
Congregational Church) anchors the northwest corner of Cottage and Magazine streets. All the
other structures in this block are residential, two-thirds of which were constructed between 1839
and 1846. A few infill structures dating from 1881 to 1914 complete the block. The houses here
are generally in very good condition.

Context of this Designation Report

A demolition permit request for 40 Cottage was received on February 9, 2016 (Case D-1390).
The house was found significant and preferably preserved in March 2016, causing a six-month
delay in issuance of a demolition permit. 1 During the delay period the owners revised their plans
so that only the ell would be demolished, a new ell built, and the front of the house renovated.
The Commission waived the remainder of the delay, subject to receiving the other necessary approvals for a building permit for the replacement project. However, the owners withdrew their
application for zoning relief and the project did not proceed.
In February 2017, a month before the expiration of the demolition delay, abutter Charles Allen
submitted a petition for a landmark designation study of both 40 and 44 Cottage Street. The
Commission voted to initiate landmark study of both properties. Acceptance of the petition initiated a one-year period in which the Historical Commission would regulate the property as if it
were already designated.
In August 2017, the owners of 40 Cottage Street filed an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a project that included renovation of both the existing house and the ell, demolition of
the garage, and construction of a new foundation and an addition on the east side of the house.

1

The owners later explained that the demolition request and replacement project was intended to show the possibilities of a zoning as-of-right project and to encourage their neighbors’ support for a renovation and addition to the existing house that would require zoning relief.

Design refinements were reviewed by the Commission in September and October and the certificate approved at the October 5, 2017 hearing for plans dated September 20, 2017 (see renderings
below). Both a zoning as-of-right design and a preferred design option, which would require a
special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal, were approved by the Commission. The main
differences in the as-of-right and special permit designs are the location of the egress door and
stair for the front unit, number of parking spaces, and window changes on the west elevation.

Architectural Description

40 Cottage Street. North/front elevation (left) and west elevation (right). CHC photos 2017, 2018.

Forty Cottage Street is a 1½-story single-family frame house oriented with its gable end to the
street. The three-bay side hall house was executed in the Greek Revival style with a broad gable,
a temple front porch with four Doric columns, symmetrically placed 6-over-6 windows, a combination of flush board and clapboard siding, wide pilasters, and sidelights flanking the front door.
The large shed roof dormer on the east side is a later addition, as is the rear porch and ell extension.
The main block of the house measures 23’ wide by 28’ deep. The 2-story ell extends another 34’
to the rear of the lot and measures 16’ wide. The house consists of approximately 2, 284 square
feet of living space (per assessment), not counting any finished space in the basement.
The house retains most of its original architectural features. One exception is the front porch
deck and stairs, which were reconstructed in concrete in the early twentieth century. The house
was sided with wood shingles in 1952. The current owners, Robin Chase and Roy Russell, removed the shingles, restored the wood clapboards and flush boards, and reworked the cornice
under the dormer in 1997. They have maintained a garden in the large side yard on the east side
of the house. They installed an array of solar panels on the roof in 2012.

Likewise, 44 Cottage Street has the same placement on the lot, side hall plan, gable orientation,
Doric-columned front porch, and six-over-six windows. It also has a large shed dormer on the
east elevation and additions at the back of the house, both of which are later additions.
The main block of the house measures 23’ wide by 38’ deep. The 2-story ell extends another 18’
to the rear of the lot and measures 15’ wide. The house consists of approximately 2, 288 square
feet of living space (per assessment), not counting any finished space in the basement.
Significant renovations were completed in 1993. A garage on the property was demolished in
1995. Also that year, a two-story addition for a rental unit was constructed at the in the southeast
corner of the house, plans for which received a zoning variance. The staff is not aware of any anticipated alterations to 44 Cottage by current owner Charles Allen. A property sale is anticipated
and the plans of any future owners are not known.

History

The settlement of Cambridgeport was made possible by the construction of the West Boston
Bridge in 1793. Prior to that time, there were only three houses in Cambridge east of Quincy
Street, and the area south of present Massachusetts Avenue was completely unpopulated. Most
of Cambridgeport was controlled by two landowners, Leonard Jarvis and Chief Justice Francis
Dana, while the rest - and all of East Cambridge - fell to Andrew Craigie.
In 1792 Leonard Jarvis acquired the Ralph Inman house and its vast adjoining lands that included most of Cambridgeport north of present Massachusetts Avenue. Justice Francis Dana, a
descendant of an old Cambridge family, controlled land on Dana Hill near his house and also
most of Cambridgeport south of Massachusetts Avenue. Jarvis and Dana worked with the Proprietors of the West Boston Bridge to lay out Massachusetts Avenue and Main Street, but did not
otherwise develop a master plan for the area. Jarvis lost his land in 1801 due to financial reverses

and it passed to Jonathan Austin who divided much of the estate into building lots. Austin was
involved in promoting construction of the River Street Bridge that was completed in 1811.
Dana’s estate south of Massachusetts Avenue remained largely intact until his death in 1811,
when his heirs divided his Cambridge landholdings. They carefully controlled subsequent development. They created parallel streets - Pleasant, Magazine, Pearl, and Brookline - leading from
Massachusetts Avenue toward the river, and laid out and subdivided cross streets, beginning with
Green and Franklin, as demand required.
The only substantial estate south of Massachusetts that was not owned by Francis Dana or his
heirs was an L-shaped parcel of land between Western Avenue and Brookline Street that belonged to William Watson, a glazier who lived at the corner of JFK and Mt. Auburn streets. According to one source, Watson received the Cambridgeport tract as "compensation for maintaining an aged colored woman, formerly a slave, called Venus Whittemore; although by some defect in the written obligations, she finally became a public charge and died in the almshouse May
4, 1825, aged 107" (Paige, 681). Watson’s land ran between Pearl and Brookline Streets from
Massachusetts Avenue to Valentine Street, and along present William and Cottage streets to
Pleasant Street, The complete title to this land has not been searched, but it may have originated
with Deacon Samuel Whittemore (1693-1784), Watson’s maternal grandfather who previously
owned Watson's house in Harvard Square and possibly also Venus Whittemore. Watson died in
1811, the same year as Francis Dana; his son Abraham Watson and other heirs were responsible
for laying out streets and selling building lots.

Part of the development of Watson’s land included Cottage Street, which was laid out in 1816
(five years after the opening of the River Street Bridge), but no buildings were constructed on
this two-block-long street for almost twenty years. The first houses built on the street were the
vernacular workers cottages at 3 and 5-7 Cottage Street built on lots that Charles Valentine, soap
manufacturer, purchased from the Watson estate in 1835. These were followed in 1838 by no. 24
built by Adoniram Wentworth, a Lynn housewright, and sold the next year to Flavel Coolidge.
The first Greek Revival houses on the street were the two 1½ story cottages at 40 and 44 that
were designed by local architect William Hovey in 1839 and have full temple fronts with Doric
columns. (A third Hovey & Markham cottage was built the same year at no. 48 but it has been
more significantly altered and was set apart by an infill three-decker in 1910). Similar 1½ - and
2–story Greek Revival houses with columned porches followed at nos. 8 (1843), 36 (1845), and
6 (1856). The first known mention of Cottage Street by name is in an 1839 deed. A number of
Greek Revival cottages and houses without columned porches were also added in the 1840s.
A woodcut illustration of a typical New England cottage was published in the New England Cultivator, a Boston weekly journal featuring articles about agriculture, horticulture, literature, and
mechanics. The article describes this house form, which had by then become very popular, as
“…a story-and-a-half cottage in one of our suburban towns. The building has a piazza front, contains seven rooms, with pantry, clothes-press, etc., and is a convenient house for a small family.
Its cost is about $2000, the interior finish being very good.”

Cambridge architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham purchased a
parcel of land on Cottage Street measuring 126’ wide by 83’ deep from Abraham A. Watson and
the other Watson heirs. They designed and built two similar Greek Revival cottages at 40 and 44
Cottage Street and sold them later that year to Andrew H. Newell and William Page, respectively. Hovey & Markham had collaborated earlier on houses on Green Street and Austin Street
(demolished), as well as 40-48 William Street nearby. Hovey went on to design several dozen
additional houses in Cambridge, primarily in Cambridgeport, while all of Markham’s Cambridge
work was in the 1830s with Hovey.
Andrew Newell, a Boston merchant, purchased 40 Cottage Street just weeks before marrying
Martha Valentine, the daughter of a local soap manufacturer. They remained in Cambridge for a
number of years and started a family before relocating to Brookline.
Through the years, 40 Cottage Street was owned and occupied by a number of prominent Cantabrigians. Francis Hardy purchased the property in 1868. He had risen through the ranks at Henry
Thayer & Co. (a pharmaceutical manufacturer) and was its owner until falling ill in 1896. Georgiana Robinson, wife of shoe stain manufacturer Fred O. Robinson, was active in the community
including as the president of the local chapter of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and
member of the women’s auxiliaries to the Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., and the Margaret Fuller House.
The property passed via probate to William R. Chafe. There was a family relationship between
the Robinson and Chafe families, with William Chafe being listed as the step-son of Fred Robinson. William R. Chafe was an office manager at the United Farmer Milk Co. of Boston, an active
member of the masons, a vocalist and member of the Handel & Haydn Society.
Prior to the current owners, the last owner of 40 Cottage was William H. Chafe (son of William
R. Chafe). He grew up in the house, attended Cambridge High & Latin, and received a scholarship to Harvard. He attended college while living at home and did very well. He won a fellowship to travel one summer in Europe and then another to attend a year at a seminary. Preferring
history over religious studies, Chafe went on to be a history professor and is currently the Alice
Mary Baldwin Professor Emeritus of History at Duke University. He has written many books on
American history, civil rights, and political figures.
Robin Chase, who leased and agreed to purchase the property in 1989 (with title transfer in
1994), co-founded Zipcar, a car sharing company, in 2000 and served as its CEO until 2003. She
is a co-founder of Veniam, Inc., a network communications company. Her husband and coowner, Roy Russell, was Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer of Zipcar
and is also a co-founder of Veniam.
No. 44 Cottage Street was sold in 1839 by Hovey and Markham to William Page, an iron
dealer. Moses W. Fish bought the house from Charles S. Dudley ca. 1849. Fish was a dealer in
hats, bonnets, and accessories. He had a retail establishment on Hanover Street in Boston and
later sold wholesale millinery goods in New York City. Born in 1813 in Mason, New Hampshire,
Mr. Fish lived until 1893. He retained the home at 44 Cottage Street even while doing business
in New York and was described in his obituary in the Cambridge Tribune as “an old and respected citizen…remembered as a peculiar and interesting figure on the streets and was one of
the old landmarks which one is apt to find sunning on Main street pleasant afternoons.”

2.b

Fish’s son, Charles C. R. Fish, sold the property in 1905 to William H. Chafe (father of William
R. Chafe and Georgianna Chafe Blasi). Georgianna Blasi inherited the property from her mother,
Annie Greelaw Chafe, and retained it until 1992 when she sold it to Anne M. Strong. Anne
Strong and Charles E. Allen became co-owners of the property in 1994.
William H. Chafe was a sales manager for a sandpaper company in Boston and was an active
Mason in Cambridge’s Royal Arch chapter. His daughter, Georgianna Chafe, was a graduate of
Radcliffe College and Boston University. She taught at Cambridge High & Latin before marrying John V. Blasi, a dentist in Chestnut Hill.
Anne M. Strong was a graduate of Smith College and Suffolk University Law School. She was
the Affirmative Action Officer and the Rent Control Hearing Board Officer for the City of Cambridge. She founded CityKicks, a soccer program for underserved communities. She passed
away in 2013. Charles E. Allen graduated from Harvard College. He founded Charlie Allen Renovations in 1978. The construction company on River Street in Cambridge specializes in historic
renovations and restorations.

Relationship to Criteria

A. Criteria for Landmark Designation
The enabling ordinance for landmark designation states:
The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or object
which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or
social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or architecturally significant (in terms of its period, style, method of construction or association with a famous
architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures . . . (City
Code, Article III, Chapter 2.78.180.A)
B. Relationship of Property to Criteria
The properties at 40 and 44 Cottage Street meet criterion (1) for their associations with the economic and social history of Cambridge. Architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham’s completion of the cottages, the first homes built in this block, prompted additional high quality development on the street. Their construction in 1839 was the start of a period
of rapid development in the Cambridgeport neighborhood, which was growing and industrializing in the middle of the nineteenth century. The families that resided in these homes were and are
leaders in local businesses and social and service organizations.
The cottages also meet criterion (2) as being architecturally significant examples of the Greek
Revival style. The staff considers them eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places. The pattern of development set by these homes for this side of the block maximized the
usable yard space by positioning the homes on the far west side of the lots. Though both homes

2.b

sat vacant for a time before their purchase by their current owners, they retained their architectural integrity and were successfully renovated by their owners to bring back original features of
the homes.
IV.

Recommendations

A. Article III, Chapter 2.78.140
The purpose of landmark designation is contained in the enabling ordinance, which is to:
preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of the City and to improve the
quality of its environment through identification, conservation and maintenance of . . .
sites and structures which constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural,
cultural, political, economic or social history of the City; to resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to this purpose; [and] to foster appropriate use and wider public knowledge and appreciation of such . . . structures . . .
B. Preservation Options
Landmark designation or donation of preservation restrictions are the two best options for longterm protection and preservation. With property values continuing ever upward, lots such as
these with potential for denser development will remain at risk of demolition or inappropriate development. The demolition delay ordinance does not provide permanent protections.
C. Staff Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission find that the Hovey & Markham cottages are eligible
for landmark designation as defined in the ordinance for the reasons stated above. The designation should incorporate the renovations and additions that were approved on October 5, 2017 as
shown on plans by Boyes Watson Architects titled, “40 Cottage St., Cambridge, MA,” and dated
September 20, 2017.
If implemented by the City Council, landmark designation would allow the Commission to review and approve publicly-visible exterior alterations with the goal of protecting the historic integrity of the buildings and their setting. The designation would not regulate use, plant materials,
or alterations to interior features.
V. Standards and Criteria
Under Article III, the Historical Commission is charged with reviewing any construction, demolition or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features (other than color) of a designated
landmark. This section of the report describes exterior architectural features that are among the
characteristics that led to consideration of the property as a landmark. Except as the order designating or amending the landmark may otherwise provide, the exterior architectural features described in this report should be preserved and/or enhanced in any proposed alteration or construction that affects those features of the landmark. The standards following in paragraphs A

Attachment: 40 and 44 Cottage St FINAL designation report (002) (CMA 2018 #30 : 44 Cottage Street landmark designation report)

12

Packet Pg. 134

2.b

and B of this section provide guidelines for the treatment of the landmark described in this report.
A. General Standards and Criteria
Subject to review and approval of exterior architectural features under the terms of this report,
the following standards shall apply:
1. Significant historic and architectural features of the landmark should be preserved.
2. Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced.
3. When replacement of architectural features is necessary, it should be based on documentary evidence. Restoration of missing architectural features should be considered
when non-original fabric is proposed for alteration or replacement.
4. New materials should, whenever possible, match the original material in physical
properties, design, color, texture, and appearance. The use of imitation replacement
materials is generally discouraged.
5. The surface cleaning of a landmark should be done by the gentlest possible means.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that damage exterior architectural features
shall not be used.
6. Additions should not destroy significant exterior architectural features and should not
be incongruous to the historic aspects, architectural significance, or distinct character
of the landmark, neighborhood, and environment.
7. Additions should be designed in a way that, if they were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the landmark would be unimpaired.
B. Suggested Review Guidelines
1.

Site Development.
Additions to the Hovey & Markham cottages, if allowed, should respect the form,
massing and materials of the original without slavishly imitating it.
Alterations to or additions of publicly visible landscape structures, including walls,
fences, paths, driveways, and the like, should be complementary to the houses. Staff
recommends that fencing and landscape structures behind the front wall plane of the
houses (and not connected to them) be exempted from review.

2. Alterations
a. Exterior surfaces and ornamentation
Traditional exterior materials should be preserved insofar as practicable. Special
care should be taken to protect and maintain the appearance of the wood win-

2.b

dows, trim, cladding, and columns. Abrasive cleaning methods such as sandblasting should not be used. Restoration of missing architectural features, though not a
requirement of owners of landmarked buildings, is encouraged and should be
based on documentary evidence such as historic photographs. Where modern materials are proposed for the approved addition at 40 Cottage Street, future alterations should be compatible with those materials and design details.
b. Fenestration
Alteration of existing or introduction of new window openings on the front portions of the buildings should be compatible with the Greek Revival style. More
flexibility should be granted for alteration of window openings on the newer additions. Replacement sash should be compatible in pattern and appearance with the
original. Storm windows may be installed without review, in conformance with
current Commission policy.
c. Secondary Structures
Fencing at the front sidewalk should be kept below 48” so that views of the house
are not obstructed.

Location and Status

A.

Address and Zoning

The Hovey & Markham cottages at 40 and 44 Cottage Street are located on the south side of Cottage Street between Pleasant and Magazine streets. No. 40 Cottage Street occupies a 4,846
square foot lot (Map 104/Lot 92) and 44 Cottage occupies a 4,537 (Map 104/Lot 91). The lots
are located in a Residence C zoning district, which allows single to multi-family dwellings with a
0.60 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limit, 35-foot height limit, and a density of 1,800 square feet per
dwelling unit. The houses both have non-conforming west side and rear setbacks due to a historic
pattern of placement of houses on their lots to maximize yard space.

Ownership and Occupancy

The two properties are separately owned. Robin M. Chase and Roy P. Russell, Jr., leased 40 Cottage Street with an option to purchase beginning in June 1989. They completed the purchase of
from William H. Chafe in July 1994. The deed is recorded in the Middlesex South Registry of
Deeds in Book 24,692/Page 516.
Charles E. Allen Jr. became a co-owner of number 44 with Anne M. Strong in December 1994 as
recorded in a deed at Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in Book 25,092/Page 464. Ms. Strong
had purchased number 44 from Georgianna C. Blasi in June 1992 (Book 22089/Page 78).
The assessed value for land and buildings in 2018 was $1,247,600 for 40 Cottage Street and
$1,420,000 for 44 Cottage Street. Both were originally built as single-family houses but 44
Cottage Street is currently assessed as a two-family and the renovation proposal for 40 Cottage
Street would result in a two-family residence.
C.

Area Description

Cottage Street runs one way from east to west. The First Korean Church (formerly the Pilgrim
Congregational Church) anchors the northwest corner of Cottage and Magazine streets. All the
other structures in this block are residential, two-thirds of which were constructed between 1839
and 1846. A few infill structures dating from 1881 to 1914 complete the block. The houses here
are generally in very good condition.

Context of this Designation Report

A demolition permit request for 40 Cottage was received on February 9, 2016 (Case D-1390).
The house was found significant and preferably preserved in March 2016, causing a six-month
delay in issuance of a demolition permit. 1 During the delay period the owners revised their plans
so that only the ell would be demolished, a new ell built, and the front of the house renovated.
The Commission waived the remainder of the delay, subject to receiving the other necessary approvals for a building permit for the replacement project. However, the owners withdrew their
application for zoning relief and the project did not proceed.
In February 2017, a month before the expiration of the demolition delay, abutter Charles Allen
submitted a petition for a landmark designation study of both 40 and 44 Cottage Street. The
Commission voted to initiate landmark study of both properties. Acceptance of the petition initiated a one-year period in which the Historical Commission would regulate the property as if it
were already designated.
In August 2017, the owners of 40 Cottage Street filed an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a project that included renovation of both the existing house and the ell, demolition of
the garage, and construction of a new foundation and an addition on the east side of the house.

1

The owners later explained that the demolition request and replacement project was intended to show the possibilities of a zoning as-of-right project and to encourage their neighbors’ support for a renovation and addition to the existing house that would require zoning relief.

Design refinements were reviewed by the Commission in September and October and the certificate approved at the October 5, 2017 hearing for plans dated September 20, 2017 (see renderings
below). Both a zoning as-of-right design and a preferred design option, which would require a
special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal, were approved by the Commission. The main
differences in the as-of-right and special permit designs are the location of the egress door and
stair for the front unit, number of parking spaces, and window changes on the west elevation.

Architectural Description

40 Cottage Street. North/front elevation (left) and west elevation (right). CHC photos 2017, 2018.

Forty Cottage Street is a 1½-story single-family frame house oriented with its gable end to the
street. The three-bay side hall house was executed in the Greek Revival style with a broad gable,
a temple front porch with four Doric columns, symmetrically placed 6-over-6 windows, a combination of flush board and clapboard siding, wide pilasters, and sidelights flanking the front door.
The large shed roof dormer on the east side is a later addition, as is the rear porch and ell extension.
The main block of the house measures 23’ wide by 28’ deep. The 2-story ell extends another 34’
to the rear of the lot and measures 16’ wide. The house consists of approximately 2, 284 square
feet of living space (per assessment), not counting any finished space in the basement.
The house retains most of its original architectural features. One exception is the front porch
deck and stairs, which were reconstructed in concrete in the early twentieth century. The house
was sided with wood shingles in 1952. The current owners, Robin Chase and Roy Russell, removed the shingles, restored the wood clapboards and flush boards, and reworked the cornice
under the dormer in 1997. They have maintained a garden in the large side yard on the east side
of the house. They installed an array of solar panels on the roof in 2012.

44 Cottage Street. North/front elevation (left) and east elevation (right).

Likewise, 44 Cottage Street has the same placement on the lot, side hall plan, gable orientation,
Doric-columned front porch, and six-over-six windows. It also has a large shed dormer on the
east elevation and additions at the back of the house, both of which are later additions.
The main block of the house measures 23’ wide by 38’ deep. The 2-story ell extends another 18’
to the rear of the lot and measures 15’ wide. The house consists of approximately 2, 288 square
feet of living space (per assessment), not counting any finished space in the basement.
Significant renovations were completed in 1993. A garage on the property was demolished in
1995. Also that year, a two-story addition for a rental unit was constructed at the in the southeast
corner of the house, plans for which received a zoning variance. The staff is not aware of any anticipated alterations to 44 Cottage by current owner Charles Allen. A property sale is anticipated
and the plans of any future owners are not known.

History

The settlement of Cambridgeport was made possible by the construction of the West Boston
Bridge in 1793. Prior to that time, there were only three houses in Cambridge east of Quincy
Street, and the area south of present Massachusetts Avenue was completely unpopulated. Most
of Cambridgeport was controlled by two landowners, Leonard Jarvis and Chief Justice Francis
Dana, while the rest - and all of East Cambridge - fell to Andrew Craigie.
In 1792 Leonard Jarvis acquired the Ralph Inman house and its vast adjoining lands that included most of Cambridgeport north of present Massachusetts Avenue. Justice Francis Dana, a
descendant of an old Cambridge family, controlled land on Dana Hill near his house and also
most of Cambridgeport south of Massachusetts Avenue. Jarvis and Dana worked with the Proprietors of the West Boston Bridge to lay out Massachusetts Avenue and Main Street, but did not
otherwise develop a master plan for the area. Jarvis lost his land in 1801 due to financial reverses

and it passed to Jonathan Austin who divided much of the estate into building lots. Austin was
involved in promoting construction of the River Street Bridge that was completed in 1811.
Dana’s estate south of Massachusetts Avenue remained largely intact until his death in 1811,
when his heirs divided his Cambridge landholdings. They carefully controlled subsequent development. They created parallel streets - Pleasant, Magazine, Pearl, and Brookline - leading from
Massachusetts Avenue toward the river, and laid out and subdivided cross streets, beginning with
Green and Franklin, as demand required.
The only substantial estate south of Massachusetts that was not owned by Francis Dana or his
heirs was an L-shaped parcel of land between Western Avenue and Brookline Street that belonged to William Watson, a glazier who lived at the corner of JFK and Mt. Auburn streets. According to one source, Watson received the Cambridgeport tract as "compensation for maintaining an aged colored woman, formerly a slave, called Venus Whittemore; although by some defect in the written obligations, she finally became a public charge and died in the almshouse May
4, 1825, aged 107" (Paige, 681). Watson’s land ran between Pearl and Brookline Streets from
Massachusetts Avenue to Valentine Street, and along present William and Cottage streets to
Pleasant Street, The complete title to this land has not been searched, but it may have originated
with Deacon Samuel Whittemore (1693-1784), Watson’s maternal grandfather who previously
owned Watson's house in Harvard Square and possibly also Venus Whittemore. Watson died in
1811, the same year as Francis Dana; his son Abraham Watson and other heirs were responsible
for laying out streets and selling building lots.

Part of the development of Watson’s land included Cottage Street, which was laid out in 1816
(five years after the opening of the River Street Bridge), but no buildings were constructed on
this two-block-long street for almost twenty years. The first houses built on the street were the
vernacular workers cottages at 3 and 5-7 Cottage Street built on lots that Charles Valentine, soap
manufacturer, purchased from the Watson estate in 1835. These were followed in 1838 by no. 24
built by Adoniram Wentworth, a Lynn housewright, and sold the next year to Flavel Coolidge.
The first Greek Revival houses on the street were the two 1½ story cottages at 40 and 44 that
were designed by local architect William Hovey in 1839 and have full temple fronts with Doric
columns. (A third Hovey & Markham cottage was built the same year at no. 48 but it has been
more significantly altered and was set apart by an infill three-decker in 1910). Similar 1½ - and
2–story Greek Revival houses with columned porches followed at nos. 8 (1843), 36 (1845), and
6 (1856). The first known mention of Cottage Street by name is in an 1839 deed. A number of
Greek Revival cottages and houses without columned porches were also added in the 1840s.
A woodcut illustration of a typical New England cottage was published in the New England Cultivator, a Boston weekly journal featuring articles about agriculture, horticulture, literature, and
mechanics. The article describes this house form, which had by then become very popular, as
“…a story-and-a-half cottage in one of our suburban towns. The building has a piazza front, contains seven rooms, with pantry, clothes-press, etc., and is a convenient house for a small family.
Its cost is about $2000, the interior finish being very good.”

Cambridge architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham purchased a
parcel of land on Cottage Street measuring 126’ wide by 83’ deep from Abraham A. Watson and
the other Watson heirs. They designed and built two similar Greek Revival cottages at 40 and 44
Cottage Street and sold them later that year to Andrew H. Newell and William Page, respectively. Hovey & Markham had collaborated earlier on houses on Green Street and Austin Street
(demolished), as well as 40-48 William Street nearby. Hovey went on to design several dozen
additional houses in Cambridge, primarily in Cambridgeport, while all of Markham’s Cambridge
work was in the 1830s with Hovey.
Andrew Newell, a Boston merchant, purchased 40 Cottage Street just weeks before marrying
Martha Valentine, the daughter of a local soap manufacturer. They remained in Cambridge for a
number of years and started a family before relocating to Brookline.
Through the years, 40 Cottage Street was owned and occupied by a number of prominent Cantabrigians. Francis Hardy purchased the property in 1868. He had risen through the ranks at Henry
Thayer & Co. (a pharmaceutical manufacturer) and was its owner until falling ill in 1896. Georgiana Robinson, wife of shoe stain manufacturer Fred O. Robinson, was active in the community
including as the president of the local chapter of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and
member of the women’s auxiliaries to the Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., and the Margaret Fuller House.
The property passed via probate to William R. Chafe. There was a family relationship between
the Robinson and Chafe families, with William Chafe being listed as the step-son of Fred Robinson. William R. Chafe was an office manager at the United Farmer Milk Co. of Boston, an active
member of the masons, a vocalist and member of the Handel & Haydn Society.
Prior to the current owners, the last owner of 40 Cottage was William H. Chafe (son of William
R. Chafe). He grew up in the house, attended Cambridge High & Latin, and received a scholarship to Harvard. He attended college while living at home and did very well. He won a fellowship to travel one summer in Europe and then another to attend a year at a seminary. Preferring
history over religious studies, Chafe went on to be a history professor and is currently the Alice
Mary Baldwin Professor Emeritus of History at Duke University. He has written many books on
American history, civil rights, and political figures.
Robin Chase, who leased and agreed to purchase the property in 1989 (with title transfer in
1994), co-founded Zipcar, a car sharing company, in 2000 and served as its CEO until 2003. She
is a co-founder of Veniam, Inc., a network communications company. Her husband and coowner, Roy Russell, was Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer of Zipcar
and is also a co-founder of Veniam.
No. 44 Cottage Street was sold in 1839 by Hovey and Markham to William Page, an iron
dealer. Moses W. Fish bought the house from Charles S. Dudley ca. 1849. Fish was a dealer in
hats, bonnets, and accessories. He had a retail establishment on Hanover Street in Boston and
later sold wholesale millinery goods in New York City. Born in 1813 in Mason, New Hampshire,
Mr. Fish lived until 1893. He retained the home at 44 Cottage Street even while doing business
in New York and was described in his obituary in the Cambridge Tribune as “an old and respected citizen…remembered as a peculiar and interesting figure on the streets and was one of
the old landmarks which one is apt to find sunning on Main street pleasant afternoons.”

2.b

Fish’s son, Charles C. R. Fish, sold the property in 1905 to William H. Chafe (father of William
R. Chafe and Georgianna Chafe Blasi). Georgianna Blasi inherited the property from her mother,
Annie Greelaw Chafe, and retained it until 1992 when she sold it to Anne M. Strong. Anne
Strong and Charles E. Allen became co-owners of the property in 1994.
William H. Chafe was a sales manager for a sandpaper company in Boston and was an active
Mason in Cambridge’s Royal Arch chapter. His daughter, Georgianna Chafe, was a graduate of
Radcliffe College and Boston University. She taught at Cambridge High & Latin before marrying John V. Blasi, a dentist in Chestnut Hill.
Anne M. Strong was a graduate of Smith College and Suffolk University Law School. She was
the Affirmative Action Officer and the Rent Control Hearing Board Officer for the City of Cambridge. She founded CityKicks, a soccer program for underserved communities. She passed
away in 2013. Charles E. Allen graduated from Harvard College. He founded Charlie Allen Renovations in 1978. The construction company on River Street in Cambridge specializes in historic
renovations and restorations.

Relationship to Criteria

A. Criteria for Landmark Designation
The enabling ordinance for landmark designation states:
The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or object
which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or
social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or architecturally significant (in terms of its period, style, method of construction or association with a famous
architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures . . . (City
Code, Article III, Chapter 2.78.180.A)
B. Relationship of Property to Criteria
The properties at 40 and 44 Cottage Street meet criterion (1) for their associations with the economic and social history of Cambridge. Architect William Hovey and Boston housewright Leonard Markham’s completion of the cottages, the first homes built in this block, prompted additional high quality development on the street. Their construction in 1839 was the start of a period
of rapid development in the Cambridgeport neighborhood, which was growing and industrializing in the middle of the nineteenth century. The families that resided in these homes were and are
leaders in local businesses and social and service organizations.
The cottages also meet criterion (2) as being architecturally significant examples of the Greek
Revival style. The staff considers them eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places. The pattern of development set by these homes for this side of the block maximized the
usable yard space by positioning the homes on the far west side of the lots. Though both homes

Packet Pg. 150

2.b

sat vacant for a time before their purchase by their current owners, they retained their architectural integrity and were successfully renovated by their owners to bring back original features of
the homes.
IV.

Recommendations

A. Article III, Chapter 2.78.140
The purpose of landmark designation is contained in the enabling ordinance, which is to:
preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of the City and to improve the
quality of its environment through identification, conservation and maintenance of . . .
sites and structures which constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural,
cultural, political, economic or social history of the City; to resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to this purpose; [and] to foster appropriate use and wider public knowledge and appreciation of such . . . structures . . .
B. Preservation Options
Landmark designation or donation of preservation restrictions are the two best options for longterm protection and preservation. With property values continuing ever upward, lots such as
these with potential for denser development will remain at risk of demolition or inappropriate development. The demolition delay ordinance does not provide permanent protections.
C. Staff Recommendation
The staff recommends that the Commission find that the Hovey & Markham cottages are eligible
for landmark designation as defined in the ordinance for the reasons stated above. The designation should incorporate the renovations and additions that were approved on October 5, 2017 as
shown on plans by Boyes Watson Architects titled, “40 Cottage St., Cambridge, MA,” and dated
September 20, 2017.
If implemented by the City Council, landmark designation would allow the Commission to review and approve publicly-visible exterior alterations with the goal of protecting the historic integrity of the buildings and their setting. The designation would not regulate use, plant materials,
or alterations to interior features.
V. Standards and Criteria
Under Article III, the Historical Commission is charged with reviewing any construction, demolition or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features (other than color) of a designated
landmark. This section of the report describes exterior architectural features that are among the
characteristics that led to consideration of the property as a landmark. Except as the order designating or amending the landmark may otherwise provide, the exterior architectural features described in this report should be preserved and/or enhanced in any proposed alteration or construction that affects those features of the landmark. The standards following in paragraphs A

Attachment: 40 and 44 Cottage St FINAL designation report (002) (CMA 2018 #56 : 40 Cottage Street landmark designation report)

12

Packet Pg. 151

2.b

and B of this section provide guidelines for the treatment of the landmark described in this report.
A. General Standards and Criteria
Subject to review and approval of exterior architectural features under the terms of this report,
the following standards shall apply:
1. Significant historic and architectural features of the landmark should be preserved.
2. Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced.
3. When replacement of architectural features is necessary, it should be based on documentary evidence. Restoration of missing architectural features should be considered
when non-original fabric is proposed for alteration or replacement.
4. New materials should, whenever possible, match the original material in physical
properties, design, color, texture, and appearance. The use of imitation replacement
materials is generally discouraged.
5. The surface cleaning of a landmark should be done by the gentlest possible means.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that damage exterior architectural features
shall not be used.
6. Additions should not destroy significant exterior architectural features and should not
be incongruous to the historic aspects, architectural significance, or distinct character
of the landmark, neighborhood, and environment.
7. Additions should be designed in a way that, if they were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the landmark would be unimpaired.
B. Suggested Review Guidelines
1.

Site Development.
Additions to the Hovey & Markham cottages, if allowed, should respect the form,
massing and materials of the original without slavishly imitating it.
Alterations to or additions of publicly visible landscape structures, including walls,
fences, paths, driveways, and the like, should be complementary to the houses. Staff
recommends that fencing and landscape structures behind the front wall plane of the
houses (and not connected to them) be exempted from review.

2. Alterations
a. Exterior surfaces and ornamentation
Traditional exterior materials should be preserved insofar as practicable. Special
care should be taken to protect and maintain the appearance of the wood win-

2.b

dows, trim, cladding, and columns. Abrasive cleaning methods such as sandblasting should not be used. Restoration of missing architectural features, though not a
requirement of owners of landmarked buildings, is encouraged and should be
based on documentary evidence such as historic photographs. Where modern materials are proposed for the approved addition at 40 Cottage Street, future alterations should be compatible with those materials and design details.
b. Fenestration
Alteration of existing or introduction of new window openings on the front portions of the buildings should be compatible with the Greek Revival style. More
flexibility should be granted for alteration of window openings on the newer additions. Replacement sash should be compatible in pattern and appearance with the
original. Storm windows may be installed without review, in conformance with
current Commission policy.
c. Secondary Structures
Fencing at the front sidewalk should be kept below 48” so that views of the house
are not obstructed.

VI.

As Cambridge develops a vision for transformative private development in the Alewife area, we agree

transportation infrastructure and open space. The pedestrian, bicycle and shuttle bridge can have a
significant environmental health benefit. Reducing vehicle miles travelled on local highways reduces
health risks from air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Fewer
car miles on the local highways and streets will also reduce contamination of surface and ground water
from stormwater runoff pollution. We also support the Working Committee's request that Cambridge
study incorporating a commuter rail-stop with the pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle bridge. The rail-stop would
provide a public-transit option for commuters from the west who work in the Alewife area and
encourage them to leave their cars at home. It may, therefore, reduce vehicular traffic, with beneficial
impacts on air and water quality and public health. In addition, we support the study of two additional
connections suggested by the Working Group: a rail crossing at the end of Cambridgepark Drive and a
pedestrian/bike bridge over the Little River. Combined, these four projects have the potential to be
transformative, creating a connected, vibrant, sustainable Alewife district and mitigating the dominance
of the private automobile.

4.4.b

The	  Alewife	  Brook	  sub-­‐watershed,	  which	  includes	  Fresh	  Pond	  and	  Alewife	  Brook	  Reservations,	  the	  Little	  
River,	  and	  Jerry's,	  Blair,	  Perch	  and	  Little	  Ponds,	  is	  an	  extraordinary	  resource	  within	  the	  Mystic	  River	  system	  
and	  a	  central	  feature	  of	  the	  Alewife	  district.	  The	  Alewife	  Reservation,	  a	  state	  park	  established	  in	  1900,	  
serves	  as	  a	  habitat	  for	  numerous	  indigenous	  and	  migratory	  birds,	  and	  as	  spawning	  grounds	  for	  
anadromous	  river	  herring,	  which	  migrate	  from	  the	  Atlantic	  Ocean	  via	  the	  Mystic	  River.	  Spawning	  habitat	  in	  
the	  Mystic	  River	  system	  is	  being	  realized	  as	  increasingly	  important	  as	  it	  is	  the	  largest	  river	  herring	  run	  in	  
Massachusetts.	  Fresh	  Pond	  is	  a	  drinking	  water	  resource	  for	  Cambridge.	  Tens	  of	  thousands	  of	  urban	  
residents	  rely	  on	  these	  areas	  for	  open	  space,	  recreation,	  and	  bike	  and	  walking	  paths	  that	  provide	  a	  regional	  
commuting	  network.	  	  As	  the	  population	  and	  building	  density	  of	  the	  Alewife	  district	  increase	  and	  climate	  
change	  introduces	  new	  challenges	  to	  environmental	  health,	  preservation	  of	  these	  priceless	  resources	  and	  
the	  public's	  access	  to	  them	  become	  even	  more	  important.	  
	  
As	  we	  stated	  in	  our	  December	  23,	  2017	  comment	  letter	  on	  the	  Envision	  Alewife	  Plan,	  MyRWA	  believes	  
that	  a	  	  pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle	  bridge	  from	  the	  “Quadrangle”	  across	  the	  railroad	  tracks	  to	  the	  “Triangle”	  
should	  be	  included	  in	  the	  Envision	  Alewife	  Plan	  and	  advanced	  as	  a	  project.	  	  This	  bridge	  is	  essential	  to	  
connect	  living	  and	  working	  neighborhoods	  in	  the	  Alewife	  area	  and	  give	  residents	  and	  employees	  access	  to	  
open	  spaces	  and	  parks,	  notably	  the	  Alewife	  and	  Fresh	  Pond	  Reservations.	  It	  will	  complete	  the	  regional	  
network	  of	  walking	  and	  biking	  paths,	  encouraging	  residents	  and	  commuters	  to	  choose	  healthy	  and	  
sustainable	  modes	  of	  regional	  travel	  instead	  of	  single-­‐occupancy	  vehicles.	  Finally,	  it	  will	  allow	  Alewife	  
residents	  and	  workers	  to	  walk,	  bike,	  or	  take	  a	  shuttle	  conveniently	  within	  the	  Alewife	  district,	  without	  
relying	  on	  single-­‐occupancy	  vehicles.	  With	  fewer	  local	  cars	  and	  car	  trips,	  more	  land	  can	  be	  devoted	  to	  
open,	  green,	  and	  civic	  space	  and	  other	  needed	  amenities	  that	  make	  a	  livable	  neighborhood,	  instead	  of	  
parking	  lots	  and	  drives.	  	  
	  
The	  pedestrian,	  bicycle	  and	  shuttle	  bridge	  can	  have	  a	  significant	  environmental	  health	  benefit.	  	  Reducing	  
vehicle	  miles	  travelled	  on	  local	  highways	  reduces	  health	  risks	  from	  air	  pollution	  and	  greenhouse	  gas	  
emissions	  that	  contribute	  to	  climate	  change.	  	  Fewer	  car	  miles	  on	  the	  local	  highways	  and	  streets	  will	  also	  
reduce	  contamination	  of	  surface	  and	  ground	  water	  from	  stormwater	  runoff	  pollution.	  	  A	  district	  with	  less	  
paved	  area	  for	  cars	  is	  more	  resilient	  to	  flood	  events	  and	  heat	  island	  effects.	  As	  stewards	  of	  water	  and	  
environmental	  quality,	  concerned	  about	  climate	  change,	  we	  see	  this	  bridge	  as	  essential	  infrastructure	  for	  
the	  Alewife	  area.	  	  	  
	  
We	  also	  support	  the	  Working	  Committee's	  request	  that	  Cambridge	  study	  incorporating	  a	  commuter	  rail-­‐
stop	  with	  the	  pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle	  bridge.	  The	  rail-­‐stop	  would	  provide	  a	  public-­‐transit	  option	  for	  
commuters	  from	  the	  west	  who	  work	  in	  the	  Alewife	  area	  and	  encourage	  them	  to	  leave	  their	  cars	  at	  home.	  	  
It	  may,	  therefore,	  reduce	  vehicular	  traffic,	  with	  beneficial	  impacts	  on	  air	  and	  water	  quality	  and	  public	  
health.

Cambridge Street bike pattern in front of Skenderian's

Dear Honorable and Esteemed Individuals who work so hard on behalf of our City,
Thank you for all that you do.
I was still trying to get used to the bike-lane changes in Harvard Square when I went to my health plan on Cambridge
Street (Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates), and was struck with the bike lane/parking pattern instituted there. In
addition to it taking me much longer to find a parking space for several appointments over the past few months (I prefer
to park on the street, and HVMA's lot is now more often full), I was immediately concerned for the impact on area
businesses, particularly Skenderian Apothecary.
I feel that we are greatly augmented by local, family-owned businesses -- especially one as contributing, and communityoriented as Skenderian's -- and I am opposed to changes that pose it an existential threat. In addition to creating a very
real impediment to accessing the pharmacy -- which certainly must threaten its survival -- I find the current traffic
pattern also makes it challenging to access other area concerns: HVMA, but also the War Memorial Pool. (My guess is
that the restaurants along the street were primarily accessed by foot.) And this is without any ambulatory issues. I can
only imagine that needing to get to one of these destinations without being able to walk a good distance would be
extremely concerning.
To me, the emotional impact of the traffic pattern is also a negative one: it feels as though businesses are barricaded
behind plastic barriers, while cars shoot down a corridor down the center of the street. I find the overall resulting impact
one of "getting through," as opposed to stopping. This feels inhospitable and unwelcoming: an overall detriment to the
neighborhood/community.
I admit that I am ignorant of the safety issues addressed with the "temporary" [?] current traffic pattern, and I have no
doubt that the modifications are well-intended and perhaps even at some levels, right-minded. However, I would like to
register my strong opinion that this current iteration should not become permanent without significant modification.
Finally, to frame my opinion: while I also find the traffic pattern in Harvard Square challenging -- with traffic backed-up
for a block when someone is trying to park, and/or with parking lanes so close together there is barely enough room to
maneuver into a spot -- I feel that the heart of Harvard Square is so much more of a walking destination, that the overall
psychological (and pragmatic?) impact on the neighborhood is less.
I thank you for your attention.
With my best wishes,
Jana Odette

Beer and Wine License for Mobil station at River/Memorial Drive

Hello,
I am writing in support of the Mobil station being allowed to sell beer and wine at their business. I think the fear I've
seen expressed is a form of gentrification that prefers alcohol beverages being sold only at Whole Foods, which aside
from being exorbitantly priced, doesn't sell alcoholic beverages that "everyday" (aka working class) people buy. In other
words, it's elitist. Regarding liquors in Central Sq, their offerings are relatively minimal although similarly priced to Whole
Foods.
In ending, I support the application of the Mobil station and urge the City Council committee overseeing this to do the
same.
Regards,
Tichaona Chinyelu

• Unanimous Letter from Alewife Working Group –
The Envision Cambridge, Alewife Working Group’s 14 members signed a unanimous
letter to the City Council explaining how our views have diverged from the CDD and its
consultant Utile’s proposals, particularly with respect to transit and connectivity
improvements at Alewife given the large scope of development completed and
envisioned in the Triangle and Quadrangle. The letter follows.
November 29, 2017
To the Honorable City Council:

Attachment: Eric Grunebaum 2018_2_26 Alewife Transit Backgrounder v2 (COM 136 #2018 : Eric Grunebaum)

Backgrounder Envision/Alewife City Council Meeting Feb. 26, 2018

The undersigned are members of the Envision Alewife Working Group. We have spent
many hours hearing from urban planning experts of all kinds and discussing how

Packet Pg. 271

4.9.b

Connectivity is at the core of this vision and thus it is the strong belief of the entire
Working Group that a pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle bridge from the “Quadrangle” across
the railroad tracks to the “Triangle” is essential to the creation of diverse, connected and
healthy spaces for living and working with a reduced need to utilize cars for commuting
and for daily routines within the neighborhood.
Further, it is desired that this bridge also incorporate a commuter rail-stop. Such a railstop would provide commuters now arriving from the west and working in the Triangle
and Quadrangle with easy access to public-transit alternatives and would be an
important step toward addressing regional traffic challenges. Thus, we request that the
city immediately initiate an effort to study and catalyze these projects while identifying
potential benefits of combining a bridge and rail-stop into a single structure.
It should be noted that there is recent precedent for a new commuter rail-stop at Boston
Landing which comprises far less development than the Triangle and Quadrangle.
In addition, there are members of our Working Group who strongly believe that the
dead-end of Cambridge Park Drive should be solved by introducing a grade-crossing (or
underpass or bridge) and that a pedestrian/bike bridge be built over the Little River,
connecting Cambridge Discovery Park as well. Combined, these four projects have the
potential to be transformative, connecting three disconnected pie slices of Alewife.
Time is of the essence in the construction of these transit and connectivity upgrades. As
the Quadrangle continues to fill with residents and workers, the future commuting
patterns are being set. If no easy bicycle, rail and subway access is available, the
immense traffic problems now afflicting Alewife will only further deteriorate and may
adversely impact long-term economic viability and growth for the area.
We suggest that the same level of “visioning” our Working Group is now applying to the
private realm – for example new buildings envisioned in the Quadrangle and the Fresh
Pond Mall – ought to also be applied to the public realm, including transportation
infrastructure and open space.
It will be an historic failure of vision and ambition if we do not address this issue while
there is still the opportunity to do so. We might ask, when will Cambridge next embark
on such a comprehensive citywide plan?
We are therefore asking that the City Council request the City Manager to direct City
staff to take all necessary steps to make a bridge and rail-stop a reality as soon as
possible and consider an auto connection point and Little River crossing as well. We are
also requesting that the City analyze, produce and disseminate detailed information

Attachment: Eric Grunebaum 2018_2_26 Alewife Transit Backgrounder v2 (COM 136 #2018 : Eric Grunebaum)

Cambridge can realize the vision of Alewife as a sustainable, resilient, mixed- use
district with convenient and safe connections within the neighborhood and to the rest of
the city and region, along with amenities that support interaction and social ties among
its residents.

We are further recommending that the relevant State Senators and Representatives,
the State Dept. of Transportation, and other key stakeholders be brought into this
conversation as soon as practicable. The status quo is unacceptable.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

3. Additional background info
• Significant Council support already voiced –
An earlier draft of the letter was distributed at the City Council's Alewife Roundtable on
November 20th and all Councilors present expressed agreement with the Working
Group’s view on the importance of a bridge – at a minimum – connecting the
Quadrangle and Triangle allowing pedestrian, bicycle and shuttle transit across the
tracks and preferably with a bridge which includes a new commuter rail-stop.
• The City itself made the case for a bridge and rail-stop in 2014 and 2015 –
Strong arguments in favor of a rail-stop and bridge were made in a report by HDR
consulting for Cambridge (excerpts below.) Apparently the City has lost interest and
abandoned these efforts. Little mention was made to the Working Group of HDR’s
report and while a pedestrian/bicycle bridge was included in initial presentations to the
Working Group it has now been removed.

Attachment: Eric Grunebaum 2018_2_26 Alewife Transit Backgrounder v2 (COM 136 #2018 : Eric Grunebaum)

regarding engineering feasibility and projected costs for the possible solutions to these
connectivity problems.

• State legislative delegation engagement –
Members of the Working Group have had initial meetings with State Reps. Hecht and

Packet Pg. 273

Rogers and Sen. Jehlen to ask for their support. At a meeting with Rep. Hecht in
December, he found it surprising that the City was no longer advocating for a rail-stop
and bridge at Alewife and offered to help convene further discussions and support the
City's efforts. Members of the Alewife Working Group hope that the City and its
consultants will become recommitted to these efforts.
• Envision Mobility Working Group –
At the December 7th Envision Mobility Working Group meeting there was almost no
mention of the traffic and connectivity problems at Alewife and the potential for
mitigation that a rail-stop and bridge over the tracks could provide. There appears to be
a lack of coordination between the Working Groups as these mobility issues have been
top priorities for the Alewife Working Group and certainly should be in the plans that the
Mobility Working Group is working on.
• Valuation increases –
The property valuation increases in the Alewife area are large over the last 5 years –
more than doubling from $1,196 billion to an estimated $2,649 billion in 2019, resulting
in a likely 40% increase in tax revenue to the city from 2013-2019, equaling
approximately $8.42 million of additional tax revenue during that time-frame with no
significant added level of city services required.
[See Kent Johnson’s analysis here: http://kentsj.com/FPRA/AlewifeTaxRevenue.html]
• This analysis goes back 5 years due to data availability –
With additional data from the assessor's office, an analysis going back 10 or 20 years
would show the full scope of tax receipt increases that recent decades have generated
as Alewife has been built out. Along with the huge are huge increases in demand on
transit for this area. Financial benefit is accruing to the City, and some part of this could
be utilized to mitigate the negative transit impacts.
• How can the City get it done?
The City could leverage private funds to supplement its own funds for building a bridge
and rail-stop which is needed to bring people in an out of the nearly completed Triangle
and the Quadrangle which is swiftly following. At the Dec. 14th Working Group meeting,
the City's own traffic consultant suggested an example from Portland, Oregon where a
transit district was created to fund new light trail. There many strategies for generating
private contributions, in addition to City appropriations and/or state money which might
also be leveraged if the City and private parties are contributing.
• Why transit-oriented development now?
It is a matter of urgency that cities like Cambridge show leadership on transit-oriented
development and at Alewife we have a perfect storm: essentially a “new city” of ~20,000
residents and employees immediately adjacent to a commuter rail-line and a subway
line where only one half of the “new city” (the Triangle) has convenient access to the
subway, and neither side has convenient access to the rail line. There is a clear
opportunity to improve transit in Alewife.

Alewife Commuter Rail Station Analysis – December 2014 (Rev. Dec. 2015)
Filename: Alewife_CommuterRail_Analysis_121715BD.pdf
In light of these Red Line capacity constraints and the cost and complexity of
addressing them, expansion of the transit system serving the transit oriented Triangle
and Quadrangle areas could most effectively be achieved through providing access to
the immediately adjacent MBTA Fitchburg Line service. Although the dense and
growing Alewife area is immediately adjacent to the Fitchburg Line, the shortest route
for access to the service requires a 2.5 mile trip to either Belmont Station or Porter
Square Station. Based on the growth occurring in the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle
that is at a density and configuration that is supportive of transit, consideration should
be given to improving access to this existing transit asset by adding a station within the
Alewife Triangle area.

TIGER VI Discretionary Grant Application: Alewife Pedestrian/Bicycle Bridge
Filename: Camb-TIGER grant-Alewife bike-ped bridge 4_2014-Narrative
The Alewife/Bicycle Pedestrian Bridge is a project which fits all of the TIGER VI
Planning grant criteria and is aligned with the major themes outlined in the NOFA
regarding connecting transit to centers of employment, creating jobs for middle and
lower incomes populations, increasing access to jobs and bridging transportation
corridors which have divided neighborhoods. Highlights include:
• A major railroad corridor bisects Cambridge’s Alewife area, separating a transit station
and a regional multiuse path from 130 acres of commercially zoned land, which
decreases effectiveness of transit, increases the length of trips on foot and bicycle, and
thus discourages sustainable transportation.
• Access to jobs at all income levels and transit will be greatly improved by a
bicycle/pedestrian bridge that will connect the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle areas,
improving access to Alewife Station for businesses and residents.
• Alewife is the last major area with available space for development in the City of
Cambridge, and improving pedestrian and bicycle access will support sustainable
transit-oriented economic development in line with the City’s overall goals.

4. Excerpts from documents detailing Cambridge’s prior Alewife transit efforts

• The bicycle/pedestrian bridge has been a part of planning efforts for more than 10
years, including as part of the Concord-Alewife Plan of 2005 and the Metropolitan Area

Packet Pg. 275

4.9.b

• Linking the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle areas for bicyclists and pedestrians will
close a “last- mile” gap for employees arriving from low-income neighborhoods along
the MBTA Red Line.
• The bicycle/pedestrian bridge will create a safe alternative for pedestrians and
bicyclists who currently traverse the congested Routes 2, 3, and 16 in the area to arrive
at their destinations.
• Storm water retention will be incorporated into the bicycle/pedestrian bridge’s design to
offset runoff into nearby wetlands generated by impermeable surfaces.
• The bicycle/pedestrian bridge is anticipated to reduce auto trips in the current area by
10%, which will lead to reduced traffic congestion, reduced air pollution, and fewer
accidents.
• Supporting sustainable transportation, such as bicycling, walking and taking transit will
contribute to the City reaching its Climate Protection Action Committee goal of an 80%
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions below current levels by 2050.
• There are no obstacles to completing the planning studies. The initial phases of the
feasibility study are set to be under way, with a contract already awarded and funding
allocated. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which owns the railroad
enthusiastically supports the project.
• The $1.39 million in planning funding, including $925,000 from a TIGER VI Planning
Grant, will allow for an enhanced feasibility study, bridge-type study, final design, and
completion of construction bid documents, and allow the City to begin pursuing
construction funds from all available sources. [Editor’s Note: Our research indicates that
at least $1.2 million has already been collected for bridge design, traffic studies and
Hubway costs.]

4.9.b

The area of Cambridge located between the Alewife Reservation, Route 16 and Concord Avenue, which
is generally bisected by the MBTA Fitchburg Line, (known collectively as the Alewife Triangle and the
Alewife Quadrangle), is a focal point for economic development within the City of Cambridge and will
continue to grow as a major urban development node of the region.
The Triangle’s proximity to the Alewife MBTA Red Line station makes it naturally focused on transit
oriented development, while the City’s vision of creating a new pedestrian and bicycle connection over
the MBTA Fitchburg Line would also allow for a focus on transit within the Quadrangle. The City of
Cambridge has created a vision for the area in which the district would evolve from a past focused on
industrial development into a mixed-use district with housing, offices and retail, improved pedestrian,
bicycle and transit connections, and improvements in stormwater management and open space. The City
rezoned the Triangle to reduce the allowed amount of commercial development, and allowed the highest
densities in areas closest to Alewife Station. The goal of this strategy was to promote a more transit
oriented pattern of development that balances residential and employment opportunities. The strategy
was also intended to result in less auto traffic growth than prior development, because housing is less
densely occupied than office and because Cambridge residents tend to commute by car in lower
percentages than office employees
This approach has been successful, as the area is now undergoing a growth pattern that is dependent on
transit, with the MBTA Red Line being a major focal point. However as this area, and other areas of
Cambridge located along the Red Line grow, the capacity of the Red Line is becoming a constraint. In
light of these Red Line capacity constraints and the cost and complexity of addressing them, expansion of
the transit system serving the transit oriented Triangle and Quadrangle areas could most effectively be
achieved through providing access to the immediately adjacent MBTA Fitchburg Line service. Although
the dense and growing Alewife area is immediately adjacent to the Fitchburg Line, the shortest route for
access to the service requires a 2.5 mile trip to either Belmont Station or Porter Square Station. Based
on the growth occurring in the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle that is at a density and configuration that
is supportive of transit, consideration should be given to improving access to this existing transit asset by
adding a station within the Alewife Triangle area.
The following sections provide a profile of the existing and projected residential and employment densities
in the area that would surround a new Alewife Commuter Rail Station, a conceptual plan of the station
and a preliminary evaluation of how the station favorably compares to other similar commuter rail stations
on the MBTA network.

Existing Demographics
According to Census estimates, the population within one-half mile of the existing Alewife Red Line
Station was approximately 8,100 persons in 2010. Within this same station area, there were 3,600
housing units in 2010. Employment estimates from 2012 show that there were over 6,000 jobs within the
station area. Table 1 shows the existing population figures for the Alewife Red Line Station area.
Located within one-quarter mile of the existing Alewife Station (see Figure 1), a potential commuter rail
station at Alewife would have similar existing demographics. Employment estimates are the same for the
potential commuter rail station area, but the number of persons and housing units within one-half mile are
approximately 25 percent less than the existing Alewife station. In 2010, 6,270 persons lived in 2,701
housing units within one-half mile of the potential commuter rail station. (See Table 2).

Alewife Commuter Rail Station Analysis

Packet Pg. 277

To provide some context regarding the density of development in the Alewife Commuter Rail Station
area, a comparison is provided that contrasts the Alewife area with other urban MBTA Commuter Rail
stations (See Table 1). Out of the twelve stations that are within a 15 minute commuter rail trip to North
or South Stations, six were identified as comparable1. Compared to all of the other station areas, the
current and 2020 conditions of the Alewife Commuter Rail Station area have much higher existing
employment, and almost double or triple the number of jobs.
This density of employment makes the Alewife area a candidate to be a significant commuter rail
destination. In addition, although the areas surrounding the Chelsea, Uphams Corner and JFK/UMass
stations are significantly more residentially dense, the population and number of housing units around in
the Alewife area is similar to the other comparison stations. The combination of high employment density
and moderate residential density in the area surrounding the potential Alewife Commuter Rail station is
the type of land use that is supportive of commuter rail service.

2013 and over 900 new units in 2014. Based on this residential and commercial development, the City
estimates the Alewife area has gained approximately 2,250 residents, 985 housing units, and 3,245 jobs.
Within the potential Alewife commuter rail station area, total population is projected to grow to near 8,500
persons and total employment is projected to be increase to 9,300 jobs by 2020. The combined number
of jobs and residents in the area surrounding the potential Alewife Commuter Rail Station would be far
greater than other areas around the Boston area that successfully utilize and support both the MBTA
commuter rail and transit systems.

Station Utilization
Although detailed station utilization projections will not be available for the Alewife Commuter Rail station
until a more thorough study is conducted, comparisons to similar stations in the Boston area can provide
insight into the likely utilization. The stations referenced above are those that are the most comparable
with regard to demographics. More specifically three stations (Forest Hills, Quincy Center and
JFK/UMass) have unique ridership characteristics and act in part as a downtown station with most
commuter rail patrons using the station to alight (get off) of inbound trains or board outbound trains, with
limited numbers of transfers between commuter rail and subway. It is anticipated that station utilization
for Alewife would be similar. Based on 2012 commuter rail service passenger counts, the comparable
stations had between 100 and 420 average daily commuter rail boardings. It is the expectation that with
a significantly greater number of jobs located in the Alewife area as compared to the other station areas
studied, ridership would exceed those listed below. This would put an Alewife Commuter Rail station in
the top half of all the 133 commuter rail stations in terms of daily utilization.

Preliminary Evaluation
Compared to other recent commuter rail station projects and evaluation criteria used to analyze the
potential service expansions2, a potential commuter rail station at Alewife has several similar advantages.
Typical attributes used to evaluate projects include: surrounding transit supportive land use,
population/employment densities, station access, and transit network connectivity. As identified above,
the recent and anticipated development within the potential station area is transit supportive and the

Station evaluation criteria from the Allston Multimodal Station Study and the Foxborough Commuter Rail Station Study were
utilized to identify relevant attributes evaluated.

Packet Pg. 279

4.9.b

In terms of connectivity and access, the potential commuter rail station is also conveniently located to
existing transit service. The potential station is located within a five to ten minute walk from the existing
transit service at Alewife station, including the Red Line and several local, regional and intercity bus
routes that also stop at the existing Alewife station. A commuter rail station at Alewife would also benefit
from the direct access to the Concord Turnpike (Route 2). In addition, the Alewife area is the nexus of a
non-motorized path network, including the Minuteman, Somerville Community, Fitchburg Cutoff, and
Fresh Pond Paths. Since the entire Alewife Triangle/Quadrangle area is being developed consistent with
transit oriented design principles, non-motorized transportation infrastructure will be in place to provide
ready access to the station.

Alewife Commuter Rail Station Concept Plan
To construct a new Alewife Commuter Rail Station the existing two rail tracks would be realigned for
approximately 3,200 feet to provide a tangent (straight) section in which a center-island platform, or two
side platforms, could be constructed. The two tracks would be shifted slightly to the north and realigned
to allow for the 835-foot long station platform. This would require the relocation of the existing
maintenance-of-way facility currently located in that segment, to another location on the MBTA commuter
rail network. Access to the station platform would occur from a pedestrian bridge over the tracks. A plan
of the proposed Alewife Commuter Rail Station is included in Figure 1.

projected population and employment increases put the Alewife station area demographics on par with, or
exceeding, other commuter rail stations in the area including the approved Brighton Landing station in
Allston. When coupled with existing development, the area will have density comparable to the recently
opened Assembly Square Orange Line Station in Somerville.

The Alewife/Bicycle Pedestrian Bridge is a project which fits all of the TIGER VI Planning grant criteria
and is aligned with the major themes outlined in the NOFA regarding connecting transit to centers of
employment, creating jobs for middle and lower incomes populations, increasing access to jobs and
bridging transportation corridors which have divided neighborhoods. Highlights include:
 A major railroad corridor bisects Cambridge’s Alewife area, separating a transit station and a
regional multiuse path from 130 acres of commercially zoned land, which decreases effectiveness of
transit, increases the length of trips on foot and bicycle, and thus discourages sustainable
transportation.
 Access to jobs at all income levels and transit will be greatly improved by a bicycle/pedestrian
bridge that will connect the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle areas, improving access to Alewife
Station for businesses and residents.
 Alewife is the last major area with available space for development in the City of Cambridge, and
improving pedestrian and bicycle access will support sustainable transit-oriented economic
development in line with the City’s overall goals.
 The bicycle/pedestrian bridge has been a part of planning efforts for more than 10 years, including
as part of the Concord-Alewife Plan of 2005 and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council’s Alewife
Bicycle and Pedestrian Access Study (2009) and will link many regional off-road bicycle/pedestrian
paths.
 Linking the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle areas for bicyclists and pedestrians will close a “lastmile” gap for employees arriving from low-income neighborhoods along the MBTA Red Line.
 The bicycle/pedestrian bridge will create a safe alternative for pedestrians and bicyclists who
currently traverse the congested Routes 2, 3, and 16 in the area to arrive at their destinations.
 Storm water retention will be incorporated into the bicycle/pedestrian bridge’s design to offset
runoff into nearby wetlands generated by impermeable surfaces.
 The bicycle/pedestrian bridge is anticipated to reduce auto trips in the current area by 10%, which
will lead to reduced traffic congestion, reduced air pollution, and fewer accidents.
 Supporting sustainable transportation, such as bicycling, walking and taking transit will contribute
to the City reaching its Climate Protection Action Committee goal of an 80% reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions below current levels by 2050.
 There are no obstacles to completing the planning studies. The initial phases of the feasibility study
are set to be under way, with a contract already awarded and funding allocated. The Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority, which owns the railroad enthusiastically supports the project.
 The $1.39 million in planning funding, including $925,000 from a TIGER VI Planning Grant, will
allow for an enhanced feasibility study, bridge-type study, final design, and completion of
construction bid documents, and allow the City to begin pursuing construction funds from all
available sources.

The City of Cambridge is seeking $925,000 in TIGER
VI planning funds to design a critical transportation
link for residents and commuters looking to use
sustainable modes of transportation including
walking, bicycling and transit in the Alewife area of
the City. TIGER planning funds will be used, in
conjunction with $465,000 of local matching funds,
to plan and design a bicycle/pedestrian bridge over
commuter rail tracks which divide the area,
increasing access to transit. In this area subject to
automobile congestion, keeping vehicle trips to a
minimum is key to unlocking the economic
development potential of the Alewife area, as well
as transforming this auto-oriented neighborhood
into a vital and sustainable mixed use place.

The TIGER VI planning grants funds will be used to:
1) complete a Feasibility Study, including a
circulation and Bridge Type Study to determine
the optimal location of the bicycle/pedestrian
bridge;
2) develop bridge sketch plans;
3) carry out all necessary environmental
reviews and permitting; and
4) develop Final Bridge Design and Bid
Documents for the proposed
bicycle/pedestrian bridge.
The total cost of the planning project is $1,390,000.

4.9.b

Cambridge is an economically diverse city in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical
Area. Cambridge currently has a population of approximately 106,000 residents with an almost equal number of
jobs in the city. Approximately one-third of the population is non-white, with an additional 7.4% Hispanic. In
terms of incomes, approximately 30% of households are below 50% of Area Median Income, with an additional
10% of households below 80% of Area Median Income. Approximately 30% of Cambridge adult residents do not
own cars. Providing transit accessible jobs now and in the future is an important component of Cambridge’s
policies.
The Alewife area of Cambridge is the largest commercial area in the City with significant remaining development
potential. Under current zoning, the projected build out could include up to 5.8 million square feet of
development divided almost equally between residential and non-residential uses.
Promoting opportunities for economic development is one of the ways that Cambridge seeks to provide jobs
and affordable housing to residents. Since 2010, 873 housing units have been completed, 3,133 have been
permitted, and another 2,112 are currently under construction in the City. This includes 317 units completed,
1,044 in construction, and 220 permitted in Alewife specifically, including 222 affordable units.

Cambridge’s Kendall Square is one of the most significant hubs for the technology and life science sectors in the
nation, but the premium space poses cost challenges for smaller and start-up companies. Alewife is the next
area poised for growth. Within the Alewife area are two smaller areas, the Triangle and the Quadrangle, which
are separated by the Fitchburg Line commuter rail tracks, owned by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority (MBTA). These areas are bordered by Alewife Brook Parkway to the east, Concord Avenue to the south,
the Alewife Reservation to the north, and the primarily residential Cambridge Highlands neighborhood to the
west. The bordering roads along with the Concord Avenue rotaries connect Boston to its western suburbs along
Route 2, and also have significant pass-through traffic. Factoring in projects that are under construction or
seeking permits, the Triangle, which includes Alewife Station, is largely built out. The Quadrangle, an old
industrial precinct, holds the greatest potential for future job creation. This is also the only area in Cambridge
that is compatible with manufacturing, one of the few sectors that can help create well paying jobs with an
advancement track for residents with lower educational qualifications.
Acknowledging that this is one of the most heavily congested corridors in the City, Cambridge has chosen, based
on extensive past planning and policy development, to ensure that development in the Alewife area can be
served by sustainable modes of transportation in order to avoid exacerbating existing traffic problems and
reduce greenhouse gases. This decision mandates the need for safe, convenient, and pleasant bicycle and
pedestrian connections, and creating infrastructure that emphasizes transit as a key component of the area to
generate and support future non-auto trips. This is critically important since 30% of adults in Cambridge do not

The Alewife area is home to Alewife Station, which is a terminus of the MBTA’s Red Line subway. Owing to its
location at the northern edge of the City, this area is a major point of entry into Cambridge. Alewife Station is
heavily used by riders of diverse incomes from across the Boston metropolitan area, with approximately 3.15
million boardings in federal fiscal year 2013, and approximately the same number of alightings. It also serves
several bus routes that travel to the area’s adjacent western and northern suburbs. Alewife Station is a transit
anchor for this critical transportation network.
While the Triangle area is accessible to the station, the Quadrangle, a 130-acre area directly south of the station,
is perceived to be too far to walk or bike because of the busy, indirect route currently available along Alewife
Brook Parkway. With current connections, the Quadrangle is just outside of a ½ mile walking distance of
Alewife Station which is the standard for measuring attractiveness of transit. With a bridge connection, a
majority of the Quadrangle would be within ½ mile radius of the station, making it convenient to walk, and even
quicker to bike. The addition of the bridge would save almost ¼ of a mile on of each trip from Alewife Station to
the Quadrangle which translates into savings of at least 183 hours per day of travel time in the peak hours.

own cars, and thus must rely on alternative modes of transportation. Future plans for the Quadrangle and
Triangle also emphasize creating high quality bicycle and pedestrian environments to create livable
neighborhoods, as well as adding new street connections in the Quadrangle to create a connected network
allowing for short walking routes.

As Figure 3 shows, more than
36,000 low-income individuals
live within a half-mile walking
distance of all Red Line stations,
making it a one-seat ride to
Alewife Station, and a short walk
or ride to blue-collar jobs in the
Quadrangle if a bridge were to
be built. This project will allow
an even greater number of lowincome workers to access this
area with connections by bus or
other subway lines in the MBTA
system, opening up new
employment opportunities for
them while keeping commuting
costs down. Access from Alewife
Station is currently seen as a
deterrent to accessing these jobs
by transit. The City is committed
to retaining part of the
Quadrangle for light industrial
uses, which the City would like to
be in the green industries sector
and maintain the low-tomoderate income jobs in the
area.
The American Community Survey
(ACS) Journey to Work data shows
that more than 60% of workers
commute to Alewife by driving
alone. By comparison, the drivealone average in all of Cambridge
is 45%, even in areas without
nearby transit, showing that by
improving connections similar to
other neighborhoods in the City,
there is great potential to garner
more trips to the area by
sustainable modes.

The Alewife Quadrangle is home to several major employers, including commercial offices, manufacturing sites,
medical facilities, and technology incubators. The area also includes a primary/middle school and nursing
facilities. A number of the neighborhood’s employers now run shuttle buses to Alewife Station for employees,
adding buses to peak hour traffic. The construction of the proposed bridge would create a safe alternative route
for users and reduce the need for shuttle service. As one of the last remaining low-rent areas in the City, it is
important to make this area accessible to all users, and particularly to lower-income workers who rely on transit.
Figure 5 ǀ Commuter Rail Tracks

Under current conditions, pedestrians and bicyclists using Alewife Station need to use a major highway, or
illegally cross high-speed commuter rail tracks to access the Quadrangle area. Funding to advance the study,
design and, ultimately, construction of the Alewife bicycle/pedestrian bridge will create a complete bicycle,
pedestrian, and transit network that serves both residents and workers in the region. The bridge will be a focal
point within the community while also optimizing the non-auto network, alleviating congestion on nearby
roadways, and opening access to new employment opportunities at all income levels to residents in the Greater
Boston region.

The Alewife bicycle/pedestrian bridge planning grant application is being submitted by the City of Cambridge,
which has a population of over 106, 000 and is home to 107,000 jobs. The City of Cambridge has seen
population growth and general development over the past ten years, and this trend is expected to continue
well into the future. The City is home to several institutions of higher education, as well as employment hubs
such as Kendall Square. Cambridge is at the forefront of creating sustainable transportation polices and
infrastructure with several award-winning programs. The City has active standing committees to advise on
sustainable transportation, including the Cambridge Bicycle Advisory Committee, Cambridge Pedestrian
Committee, the recently formed Transit Advisory Committee, and the Climate Protection Advisory Committee.
A recently formed Alewife Business Association is in the process of establishing a transportation management
association (TMA) (see letters of support). This group, along with their TMA, will be instrumental in
encouraging employees to use sustainable transportation. In many recent special permits, the City has made
joining the TMA a requirement once it is officially underway. Several developers, as part of special permits,
have also contributed to the City matching funds and dedicated bridge landing sites, and are enthusiastic to
see the bridge design finalized and brought into construction.
The City is committed to carrying out the vision for a sustainable Alewife area through infrastructure projects,
policy programs such as the award-winning Parking and Transportation Demand Management program, and
permit related special conditions issued by the Planning Board. The City’s commitment to this area is evidenced
by the following City-supported projects which have been completed in the last three years:

The Alewife Bicycle/Pedestrian Bridge project represents much more than a simple bridge across 100 feet of
railroad track. With this project, the City of Cambridge has a unique opportunity to address important
economic, environmental, and transit issues. Repeatedly identified in planning studies as a critical component
for transforming the Alewife neighborhood into a truly transit-oriented, mixed-use area, the proposed
commuter rail crossing has the potential to be a landmark not only for the Alewife area, but for the entire City
of Cambridge. The project would dramatically enhance bikeability/walkability in this area of Cambridge,
discourage auto traffic, and help to connect disadvantaged populations to employment opportunities.

4.1 Primary Selection Criteria
4.1.1 State of Good Repair
The proposed bridge will have a significant impact on improving the City of Cambridge’s existing
transportation system. Given the increasing number of commuters, residents, and jobs within the City of
Cambridge over the last 10 years, as indicated previously, maintaining status quo will result in an increasingly
inefficient transportation system, leading to further congestion of roads and subways. In fact, as part of the
2005 Concord-Alewife Plan,2 particular attention was given to increasing connectivity within this area to avoid
adding to the existing traffic congestion on the surrounding roadways. In addition to changing the zoning
requirements to encourage additional development near transit through bonus densities and transfer of
development rights, the City also made a concerted effort to address pedestrian and bicycle connectivity
through various projects mentioned above.
Figure 6 ǀ Alewife Area Traffic Volumes
The bridge has the potential to
substantially reduce impacts of existing
and future development on the
surrounding roadways. The intersection
of Routes 2 and 16 and 3, directly
adjacent to Alewife Station, carries
significant regional traffic, is one of the
most congested in the region and has
been noted publicly by Governor Deval
Patrick as a traffic bottleneck. The most
recent traffic data3 shows a 24-hour
average daily traffic count of 44,938 for
the tract of Route 3 directly north of
Alewife Station, and 53,367 for the tract
of Route 2 directly northwest of the
station.

Because the Alewife Quadrangle is home to a number of large employers and difficult to access on foot or bike
from Alewife Station, increasing bicycle and pedestrian access to the Quadrangle will enable more commuters
to forego driving to work. Reducing the number of vehicles on Routes 2 and 3 reduces the stress on these
roadways, in turn reducing long-term roadway maintenance costs, and will avoid future roadway expansion
costs. The removal of the 10% - over 1,100 - auto trips in the peak hours each day associated with the bridge
will save substantially in pavement maintenance costs strictly related to vehicle stress. The overall value of
pavement maintenance savings will be larger and will continue to grow as additional vehicle trips are reduced.
Additionally, research has shown that residents in the Cambridge Highlands prefer to use bus routes along
Concord Avenue and making connecting trips through the Harvard Square Red Line station over using Alewife
Station, which is closer, but provides poor access to the surrounding area. Providing these residents with direct
access to the subway system will allow them to make single-seat trips rather than connecting trips.
Pedestrian bridges are also relatively low-cost endeavors. When compared to bridges intended for vehicle use,
both the initial costs of construction and life-cycle costs for a pedestrian bridge are quite low. Pedestrian
bridges use far less material in construction, require minimal resurfacing in the long-term, experience less lifetime fatigue than vehicle-use bridges, and have cheaper life-cycle inspection costs. Installing a bridge intended
for automobile use at the same site would create an enticing alternative route for drivers, which could have the
unwanted effect of increasing traffic in this already highly-congested micro-area. Beyond the cost and traffic
implications, the amount of space required for a vehicle bridge in this area would reduce the potential for
additional development, resulting in less-than-ideal land use.
Furthermore, the project would not impose a significant financial burden on the City of Cambridge. The project
maintenance would be funded through City taxes. Decreased vehicle traffic in the neighborhood also provides
for improved livability and the opportunity for further transit-oriented development. This would effectively
increase the tax base for the City of Cambridge and off-set operations and maintenance costs.
Lastly, the project would also improve the local ability to withstand emergencies and climate change impact. In
the event of a disaster, offering a connection between the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle for pedestrians and
cyclists provides residents a way to move freely and avoid being trapped in one place. Increasing
transportation options would also decrease stress on the existing subway and highway systems during an
evacuation. This is of particular importance if evacuation routes are rendered inoperable by disaster.
Furthermore, by diverting vehicular traffic, the bridge would help to lessen emissions from the transportation
sector, mitigating local contributions to climate change.

The section of Cambridge that will be most directly affected by this project is the last large commercial area of
the City to have significant remaining development potential. Without the proposed bridge, the Alewife area,
and particularly the Alewife Quadrangle, will likely continue to lag behind other areas of Cambridge in terms of
job creation and economic mobility. The project’s most important contributions toward economic
competitiveness come from increasing the long-term mobility of local and regional residents and workers,
unlocking new employment opportunities, and opening the area to new development and an expanded tax
base.

The area encompassing the Alewife Triangle and the Alewife Quadrangle is home to several large employers in
the tech, medical, pharmaceutical, and public sectors including Raytheon/BBN Technologies, ABT Associates,
Iggy’s Bakery, Northrup Grumman/AOA Xinetics Manufacturing, Mount Auburn Hospital doctor’s office
building, two nursing care facilities, and more. Companies in this area currently employ more than 8,700
workers. While more than 60 percent of these workers commute by driving alone, nearly one-quarter of them
use a non-auto mode such as the subway, bus, bicycle, or walking, and this share could be significantly boosted
by improved connections, such as this bridge.

4.1.2 Economic Competitiveness

11 | P a g e
Packet Pg. 295

4.9.b

As seen in the figure below, many workers come from areas close enough to walk, bike or take transit,
especially given the extensive regional path system leading to Alewife as shown Figure 9 in Section 4.1.4.

With major transportation corridors acting
as physical and economic barriers
between parts of the neighborhood,
individuals must either dangerously and
illegally cross over the tracks, or choose to
drive to destinations less than a mile away.
As a result, residents may become
discouraged to seek employment locally.
The proposed bridge allows commuters to
freely access all jobs in all areas of the
Triangle and Quadrangle by bicycle or on
foot. This would provide opportunity for a
shift toward higher numbers of non-auto
commuters.
By effectively increasing the usefulness of
Alewife Station as a transit hub, the
project also has potential to draw
employees from disadvantaged
communities along the Red Line. Linking
the Triangle and Quadrangle will eliminate
the need for transfers to bus lines and
other subway lines, making “single-seat”
trips to the area a possibility for all Red
Line riders. Prospective employees from
the traditionally lower-income Boston
neighborhoods of Mattapan and
Dorchester, as well as nearby Quincy, will
be able to reach points of employment in
the Alewife area more quickly, and at a
lower out-of-pocket cost.
By providing a safe passage linking the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle, residents, including the many low
income residents of the area and along the Red Line corridor shown in Figure 5, will have increased access to
employers and retailers on both sides of the tracks. Part of the planning grant funds will go toward conducting
an assessment of potential job creation for the area as a result of the project.

The proximity of these areas to low-income housing generates opportunities for these residents within their
own neighborhood. Currently there are 1,384 units of affordable house existing, or in construction in the area.
Moreover, this project is aligned with the City of Cambridge’s Inclusionary Housing Program and Incentive
12 | P a g e
Packet Pg. 296

Zoning Ordinance, which seek to maintain housing affordability in the City. The Inclusionary Housing Program
requires that 12-15% of the units in developments with 10 or more new units or more than 10,000 square feet
of new residential floor area be affordable to people with income no greater than 80% of AMI. Working in
concert with that program, the Incentive Zoning Ordinance requires non-residential developers seeking certain
special permits to make contributions to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust to mitigate the impact of
increased demand for housing from new non-residential development on housing affordability. These
programs exemplify the City’s commitment to increasing economic opportunities and keeping housing
affordable for its residents, and the bicycle/pedestrian bridge proposed in this project will work in harmony to
further the City’s commitment in this focus area.

4.1.3 Quality of Life
The proposed bridge would undoubtedly increase transportation choices and access to numerous regional
services in the area including medical facilities, retail and recreational resources. The study area contains
significant clusters of elderly and low-income housing.
Many of these residents do not have access to an automobile. Almost one-third of Cambridge adult residents
do not own cars. A pleasant walking connection linking the Triangle and Quadrangle enables residents to
better enjoy their own neighborhood and commute to other areas of the region with far greater ease. For
example, eliminating the need to walk along the extremely busy Alewife Brook Parkway would create a shorter,
more pleasant, and far less intimidating walk for elderly residents who use the Red Line to reach the Social
Security Administration building on Fawcett Street from Alewife Station. It would also provide connectivity to
the medical facilities on Concord Avenue.
Furthermore, direct connections between the Triangle and Quadrangle would give low-income populations on
Rindge Avenue at Rindge Towers and Jefferson Park4 better access to these medical offices on Concord
Avenue, as well as the Fresh Pond Reservation recreation area. The bridge would also give residents of the
Quadrangle and Highlands neighborhoods a safe ride on low speed streets to significant recreation facilities on
Rindge Avenue, including a state-owned community pool, and City-owned playing fields at Russell Field.
Increasing walkability has also been shown to be a factor in improving health in urban areas and those cities
with high walkability scores consistently rank among the healthiest in the nation. Cambridge has one of the
highest walking scores in the country with an average walk score of 87. Unfortunately, this walkability does not
extend to the Alewife area. The neighborhood is partially located in North Cambridge and partially in
Cambridge Highlands, which are ranked 8th and 13th out of the 13 neighborhoods in Cambridge, with walk
scores of 84 and 65 respectively5. Enhanced walkability would enable residents to better access local goods
and retailers. This will be important for attracting and retaining new residents for the several residential
developments which are already in progress in the area. An influx of new residents who can easily walk
throughout the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle can, in turn, spur new small-business development.
Cambridge has twice been voted the #1 walking city in America, and is also one of only 17 communities in the
country, and the only city east of the Mississippi River to earn a Gold-level bike-friendly rating from the League
of American bicyclists6. The City seeks to extend the benefit of walkability to underserved parts of the

4.1.4 Sustainability
With an aim towards reducing auto traffic and enhancing local access through alternative modes of
transportation, this single pedestrian bridge stands to substantially contribute to local environmental
sustainability. Reducing the number of automobiles in the area will directly reduce the amount of air pollution
and greenhouse gases produced in this area. The expected 550 vehicle reduction in PM peak hour trips alone
generates a daily savings of just over 1 metric ton7 of Carbon Dioxide emissions. Looking only at the peak
period reduction, this amounts to more than 280 tons of Carbon Dioxide per year.
Many significant regional off-road multi-use paths converge in the Alewife Area as show on the map below.
However, connections between the north and south areas are weak and would be greatly strengthened by the
project.

community, and construction of the proposed bridge would certainly increase walkability in Alewife and further
the City’s commitment to emissions-free transportation and exceeding the City’s goal of an 80 percent
reduction in greenhouse gases below current levels by 2050.

The City’s innovative Parking and Transportation Management Ordinance regulates the amount of new parking
spaces, and requires developers to encourage public transportation use through a variety of transportation
demand management means including subsidized transit passes, charging market rates for parking, indoor
bicycle parking , locker-room facilities for employees, and ride-matching, among other services. Therefore,
money that would be spent by developers and employers on building parking spaces can be redistributed by
offering subsidies for public transportation and other services, further reducing air pollution. The reduction in
the amount of parking available reduces impervious surfaces and deters users from defaulting to automobile
transport as a primary mode of travel.
This project will also demonstrate sustainability at the construction level. As part of the feasibility study and
planning effort, designers will seek to incorporate a number of sustainable elements into the design of the
bridge. These elements may include the use of post-consumer materials for the bridge’s construction and solar
lighting, among other options. The bridge design will also seek to incorporate storm-water retention
underneath or around the bridge itself, making the project truly multi-focal.
The project area falls within the Alewife sub-watershed of the Mystic River Watershed, which ultimately
discharges into the Boston Harbor. This means that particular attention must be given to the quantity and
quality of the water handled and discharged into Alewife Brook. The recent completion of a constructed storm
water wetland at the Alewife Reservation, on the northern edge of the Alewife area, highlights the City’s
commitment to enhance storm water quality and lessen the likelihood of flooding in Cambridge and other
nearby communities. Given the existing amount of impervious surfaces in the Quadrangle area,
redevelopments are looking into private storm water retention systems such as green-roof systems, retention
ponds, and rain gardens. The redevelopment efforts, including the bridge design, will attempt to reduce the
amount of impermeable surface that will generate runoff into the nearby wetlands.

4.1.5 Safety
The Alewife Brook Parkway, a stretch of MA Route 3 which acts as the eastern border of the Alewife Triangle
and Quadrangle, experiences heavy traffic all days of the week.
Sidewalks along this corridor can be crowded and difficult to use, especially in peak hours. This corridor also
lacks a dedicated bicycle lane, creating dangerous conditions for cyclists, or forcing them to illegally ride on the
sidewalk. The proposed bridge would enable commuters and locals to safely and freely move between the
Triangle and Quadrangle, both walking and biking on a facility designed to make these transportation methods
enjoyable and safe.

Furthermore, the project will mitigate traffic-related safety issues in the surrounding area. Reducing the
number of daily drivers along Alewife Brook Parkway and its intersection with MA Route 2 by effectively
making Alewife Station more useful to commuters will reduce the number of potential traffic accidents.
Historically, the heavy traffic volumes have resulted in significant numbers of vehicle accidents, as shown
below.

Additionally, there are a number of nearby recreational facilities, including playgrounds, a community pool, and
baseball, football, and soccer fields, which can only be accessed from Alewife Station and the
Triangle/Quadrangle area by crossing the Alewife Brook Parkway. This crossing has been identified as an area
of significant safety concern, and in 2013 was unfortunately the site of a fatal accident involving a youth
walking to access the nearby playing fields.

Attachment: Eric Grunebaum 2018_2_26 Alewife Transit Backgrounder v2 (COM 136 #2018 : Eric Grunebaum)

Currently, if users do not wish to traverse sub-standard sidewalks along a major highway, the only other option
is to illegally cut across the commuter rail tracks. Visual examination of the area shows repeated cuts in the
chain-link fence surrounding the tracks, demonstrating an existing need for this bridge as residents are willing
to risk criminal charges, and potentially even their lives, to make the necessary connection on their own.

4.2 Secondary Selection Criteria
This project is collaborative in nature, and will have the backing of several influential community bodies. The
City of Cambridge has received letters of support from the MBTA (the owner of the transit system and the
commuter rail tracks in question), businesses, and several local community organizations to carry out the
project. These letters of support can be found in Appendix A.

Along with the partners listed above, the City plans to work closely with the new Alewife business association
and the TMA which are currently being formed. This close partnership will help build support for the chosen
design and help lay the groundwork for construction funding.
This support also shows that diverse transportation and non-transportation agencies are pursuing the same
goal to increase access to the Alewife Triangle and Quadrangle and will support the bridge project through to
completion. The project coordinates economic development, water infrastructure, and land use plans to
culminate in a design that positively affects the City of Cambridge and the Boston metropolitan area in a
variety of ways.

17 | P a g e
Packet Pg. 301

4.9.b

The City of Cambridge has historically shown a commitment to innovation. That commitment is evident
through the City’s approach to the proposed project. Matching funds for construction of the project will be
raised through permitting and City funds, as were matching funds for planning and design. The City’s
aforementioned PTDM Ordinance, along with the Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance, have proven to be as
successful as they are innovative in encouraging alternative transportation and discouraging auto traffic, as
described in the Boston Globe8.
Additionally, Hubway, a regional bike-sharing program, will be part of the City’s innovative strategy to amplify
the positive effects of the connection made by a new bridge. By strategically placing bike-share stations at
Alewife Station, as well as in the Quadrangle and Triangle, the distance that people will be able to travel from
Alewife Station will be extended, allowing more work trips by transit with a bicycle connection. Hubway is
supported by several corporate donors, who receive discounted memberships for their employees. Cambridge
currently has 1,688 members registered through its corporate membership program. Hubway is owned by the
cities of Cambridge, Somerville, Boston and Brookline, and has seen overwhelming success in its first two-plus
years of operation with 34 stations in Cambridge, and over 140 stations in total, system-wide. Continued
expansion will bring additional transportation opportunities to the area, and the presence of this bridge will
provide a safe means of travel for local Hubway riders
Furthermore, the bridge itself will be designed with an eye towards sustainable construction, features, and
innovative design. The overall goal is to provide a forward-thinking piece of infrastructure within the
community to meet the transportation needs of the multiple diverse populations within the area. Any
opportunity to incorporate solar lighting and other innovative, sustainable elements or materials into the
bridge will be explored.

The proposed project is part of a robust planning process. Several different studies by multiple agencies,
including the aforementioned Concord-Alewife Plan and the 2009 MAPC Alewife Bicycle and Pedestrian Access
Study9 have identified the need for a bicycle/pedestrian bridge connecting the Alewife Triangle and
Quadrangle. Given the jurisdiction of the project, the primary agencies of concern are the City of Cambridge
and the MBTA. The City of Cambridge has already approved the initial phases of the feasibility study and the
MBTA has indicated that they support this feasibility study and the design of the bridge. The City of Cambridge
fully supports this project and is committed to seeing it through to construction. Due to funding constraints,
the scope of the initial feasibility study was reduced.
Securing TIGER funding will ensure that all necessary aspects of the planning process are properly studied,
permits are secured, and design of the project can be completed. The TIGER funding will carry the project
through to bid for construction. All available construction funding sources will be pursued including:




submission for the City’s capital plan consideration,
continuing to require mitigation funds from area development projects
applying to the local Metropolitan Planning Organization for funding
reviewing eligibility and submitting for a MassWorks state infrastructure grant
investigating other state grants and funding sources
considering future federal grant availability.

One key issue that will be addressed in the planning process is determining the exact site of the bridge, and its
landing on the south side of the tracks. Three potential sites have been secured on the north side of the
commuter rail tracks in conjunction with permit approvals from development. The planning process will identify
which of the three proposed locations is the optimal site, as well as which areas on the east side of the tracks
will need to be secured through development special permits on the south side which are currently in the
development pipeline. The planning study will also investigate projected effects on job creation, housing costs,
traffic, and ridership at Alewife Station. A preliminary environmental permitting identification10 showed that
NEPA and MEPA requirements should not hinder the project schedule. There are no anticipated roadblocks to
expending funding by the deadline with the following diagram outlining the planned schedule.

Proposed land mark designation for 40 Cottage St.

Dear Cambridge City Councilors,

I am writing to oppose the historical landmark designation of 40 Street. I know the owners well and they are committed to
preserving the historical integrity of this house. They have been working on renovation plans which will make it much more
energy efficient as well as improvements that will ensure that it is well used for decades to come. We see no reason for the
landmark designation.
Cambridgeport has a proud tradition of maintaining our unique character without the need for historic land marking of our
houses. We are a diverse neighborhood with owners and tenants, full of ethnic, racial, and socio-economic diversity. Land
marking this house makes it more difficult to maintain this diversity as it makes the necessary process even of simple repair and
maintenance more time consuming and expensive.
We have copied the City Clerk on this message so that it will be included in the meeting record.
Sincerely,
Ed Beucler
37 Cottage St.
Cambridge, MA
617-864-8125

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has indicated its intent to move forward with creating a bike
infrastructure network, and with the public discussions around how to make our streets
safer for bicyclists, motorists, and pedestrians, and with evaluations of how to best
establish a bicycle lane infrastructure continuing throughout the city, it is imperative
that the City make deliberate efforts to ensure that the voices of all stakeholders,
including those residents like our senior citizens who may have difficulties in making
it out to attend public hearings, are heard and factored into all decisions going forward;
and

WHEREAS:

On February 12, 2018, the City Council voted in favor of establishing a new working
group consisting of the various stakeholders to determine how to best move this
conversation forward; and

WHEREAS:

It is vitally important that this working group hear from the young and old, the ablebodied and those with mobility impairments, in order to find an appropriate resolution
that factors in the various needs, concerns, and viewpoints throughout this community;
now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager and the Mayor’s Office be and hereby are requested to direct
this new bicycle lane working group, once it has been convened, to hold a series of
“listening sessions” at the senior buildings throughout Cambridge in order to ensure
that our senior residents, who might otherwise be unable to attend the various hearings
to weigh in on this issue, will have adequate opportunities to have their voices heard on
an issue that could have an outsized impact upon them.

WHEREAS:

Since November of 2016, a master planning process for the City of Cambridge, called
Envision Cambridge, has been underway beginning in Alewife; and

WHEREAS:

To support the work of City staff and hired consultants, several working groups of
residents and community stakeholders have been formed, including a 14-member
Envision Alewife Working Group, whose charge is to “…help guide the Alewife
district study and develop comprehensive and actionable recommendations for the
area”; and

WHEREAS:

As work has progressed, the views of the members of the Envision Alewife Working
Group have at times diverged from those of city staff and consultants, though all
involved are advocating for the best possible plan to enhance this neighborhood for
housing, economic development, open space, and transportation; and

WHEREAS:

All 14 members of the Envision Alewife Working Group signed a letter dated
November 29, 2017 expressing concerns over the lack of transit and access
improvements being presented for the area, especially given the large scope of
development that has been completed, is in process, and is being envisioned for the
future; and

WHEREAS:

A draft of this letter was presented at a City Council Roundtable Meeting regarding
Envision Cambridge held on November 20, 2017 at which time members of the City
Council generally shared the view that it is essential to include plans for a bridge
crossing the railroad tracks to connect development on Concord Avenue to
development on Cambridgepark Drive, the Alewife T station, and a potential longdiscussed Commuter Rail station at Alewife; and

WHEREAS:

The unanimous letter by the Envision Alewife Working Group, attached to this Policy
Order, is here being formally submitted to the City Council, as the Envision
Cambridge planning process gives our City a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a
well-connected, green, diverse, and accessible community that balances the need for
affordable housing, commercial space, open space, fabrication/light industrial space,
and transit access; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has an opportunity to continue to be a leader in transit-oriented
development; and

Packet Pg. 480

6.7

WHEREAS:

In this neighborhood, there will be approximately 20,000 residents and employees,
adjacent to a commuter rail line and subway station, but only half have convenient and
safe access to the subway station and none have access to a commuter rail line at
Alewife; and

WHEREAS:

It is critical that we include transit access as a key part of the Envision Cambridge
plan; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record supporting the letter presented by the Envision
Alewife Working Group in stating that a pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle bridge from the
Quadrangle area along Concord Avenue across the railroad tracks to the Triangle area
on Cambridgepark Drive and a commuter rail stop are critical to create neighborhoods
that are safe and healthy for residents and businesses; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with City staff on the
feasibility of initiating a formal transit study and action plan of the Alewife area
in response to these unanimous concerns of the Envision Alewife Working Group, and
report back at a Transportation and Public Utilities Committee hearing to be scheduled
in early spring 2018.

November	  29,	  2017	  
	  
	  
To	  the	  Honorable	  City	  Council:	  
	  
The	  undersigned	  are	  members	  of	  the	  Envision	  Alewife	  Working	  Group.	  	  We	  have	  
spent	  many	  hours	  hearing	  from	  urban	  planning	  experts	  of	  all	  kinds	  and	  discussing	  
how	  Cambridge	  can	  realize	  the	  vision	  of	  Alewife	  as	  a	  sustainable,	  resilient,	  mixed-­‐
use	  district	  with	  convenient	  and	  safe	  connections	  within	  the	  neighborhood	  and	  to	  
the	  rest	  of	  the	  city	  and	  region,	  along	  with	  amenities	  that	  support	  interaction	  and	  
social	  ties	  among	  its	  residents.	  	  	  
	  
Connectivity	  is	  at	  the	  core	  of	  this	  vision	  and	  thus	  it	  is	  the	  strong	  belief	  of	  the	  entire	  
Working	  Group	  that	  a	  pedestrian/bicycle/shuttle	  bridge	  from	  the	  “Quadrangle”	  
across	  the	  railroad	  tracks	  to	  the	  “Triangle”	  is	  essential	  to	  the	  creation	  of	  diverse,	  
connected	  and	  healthy	  spaces	  for	  living	  and	  working	  with	  a	  reduced	  need	  to	  utilize	  
cars	  for	  commuting	  and	  for	  daily	  routines	  within	  the	  neighborhood.	  	  
	  
Further,	  it	  is	  desired	  that	  this	  bridge	  also	  incorporate	  a	  commuter	  rail-­‐stop.	  Such	  a	  
rail-­‐stop	  would	  provide	  commuters	  now	  arriving	  from	  the	  west	  and	  working	  in	  the	  
Triangle	  and	  Quadrangle	  with	  easy	  access	  to	  public-­‐transit	  alternatives	  and	  would	  
be	  an	  important	  step	  toward	  addressing	  regional	  traffic	  challenges.	  	  Thus,	  we	  
request	  that	  the	  city	  immediately	  initiate	  an	  effort	  to	  study	  and	  catalyze	  these	  
projects	  while	  identifying	  potential	  benefits	  of	  combining	  a	  bridge	  and	  rail-­‐stop	  into	  
a	  single	  structure.	  
	  
It	  should	  be	  noted	  that	  there	  is	  recent	  precedent	  for	  a	  new	  commuter	  rail-­‐stop	  at	  
Boston	  Landing	  which	  comprises	  far	  less	  development	  than	  the	  Triangle	  and	  
Quadrangle.	  
	  
In	  addition,	  there	  are	  members	  of	  our	  Working	  Group	  who	  strongly	  believe	  that	  the	  
dead-­‐end	  of	  Cambridge	  Park	  Drive	  should	  be	  solved	  by	  introducing	  a	  grade-­‐crossing	  
(or	  underpass	  or	  bridge)	  and	  that	  a	  pedestrian/bike	  bridge	  be	  built	  over	  the	  Little	  
River,	  connecting	  Cambridge	  Discovery	  Park	  as	  well.	  Combined,	  these	  four	  projects	  
have	  the	  potential	  to	  be	  transformative,	  connecting	  three	  disconnected	  pie	  slices	  of	  
Alewife.	  
	  
Time	  is	  of	  the	  essence	  in	  the	  construction	  of	  these	  transit	  and	  connectivity	  upgrades.	  	  
As	  the	  Quadrangle	  continues	  to	  fill	  with	  residents	  and	  workers,	  the	  future	  
commuting	  patterns	  are	  being	  set.	  If	  no	  easy	  bicycle,	  rail	  and	  subway	  access	  is	  
available,	  the	  immense	  traffic	  problems	  now	  afflicting	  Alewife	  will	  only	  further

We	  suggest	  that	  the	  same	  level	  of	  “visioning”	  our	  Working	  Group	  is	  now	  applying	  to

WHEREAS:

Since the completion of the Cambridge Common renovations, the paths across the park
do not drain properly, and are therefore prone to collecting water in pools; and

WHEREAS:

This pooling poses both comfort and safety issues to the public as the puddles, of
various depths, create inconvenient obstacles for pedestrians in warmer weather that
become truly dangerous when frozen during colder weather; and

WHEREAS:

Residents have been reporting that the paths’ drainage has been problematic since their
installation and have been inquiring as to when the issue will be addressed and the
drainage problems fixed; and

WHEREAS:

In email exchanges with City Staff which have been ongoing for over a year, it was
stated that the City was working with MassDOT and the contractor with an expectation
to have the issue resolved by Spring of 2017, but excess water is still an ongoing issue;
now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council
with an explanation of the causes of the Cambridge Common drainage problems, an
expected date that the paths will be redone so that they drain properly, and any lessons
City staff may have learned about the renovation process so that future contractual
work does not result in similar problems.

commercially operated vehicles so that they encroach upon the sidewalks around the
facility, obstructing the public way for pedestrians; and

WHEREAS:

Residents have repeatedly voiced their concern to Enterprise Rent-A-Car over the
practice, which places pedestrians closer to traffic as they walk around parked
commercial vehicles, reduces sidewalk width below ADA compliance, and converts
portions of the public way to commercial use; and

WHEREAS:

Despite these appeals, commercially operated vehicles continue to be recorded
obstructing the public way; now therefore be it

The toilet suffered from the same type of service interruption from frozen pipes during

WHEREAS:

The Incentive Zoning Provisions require that large non‐residential developments make

special permit requirement so that the requirements would apply to all large
non‐residential developments; and

WHEREAS:

The Zoning Ordinance states “the City shall initiate a reevaluation of the Housing
Contribution Rate and any other aspect of these Incentive Zoning Provisions at an
interval of no less than three (3) years from the time the rate was last amended by the
City Council; and

WHEREAS:

Such reevaluation shall include a report provided to the City Council reviewing

voting equipment which has been purchased for the Election Commission.
Present at the meeting were Mayor Marc McGovern, Councillor Dennis Carlone, Councillor Timothy J.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Lisa Peterson, Deputy City Manager, Tanya Ford, Executive Director,

Also present were Jeff Silvestro, President, LHS Associates, John Hawkinson and John Gintell.
Mayor McGovern convened the hearing at 2:03 p.m. and introduced Ms. Ford. Ms. Ford took the
opportunity to introduce Mr. Jeff Silvestro to the City Council and invited him to share information
regarding the updated voting equipment.
Mr. Silvestro stated that he is the President and Owner of LHS Associates. He provided an informational
handout for those present (ATTACHMENT A) and gave a brief overview of same. He noted that LHS
Associates has been supporting Cambridge elections since 1992. He stated that there are over 100 cities
and towns in Massachusetts who are using this system with 680 tabulators in service. He explained the
features and benefit of the product including full digital scanning technology, internal diverter, dual and
removable commercial memory cards, marginal mark detection and complete end-to-end system
auditability.
Councillor Toomey stated that had had some concerns when the election was transitioned to a
computerized system as opposed to a manual system. He said that he read a recent article in the
Boston Globe noting that there was discussion about returning to a paper ballot. Mr. Silvestro
responded that in the article, it was the LHS type of system that was being referred to as it is a paperbased system.

Councillor Toomey asked about the probability of the system being hacked. Mr. Silvestro responded
that the hardware has a robust internal security with more encryption in the election media.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he is a software engineer. He asked what the difference is in terms of
hardware/software between the current and the new machines. Mr. Silvestro replied that the
equipment is being replaced due to the fact that some of the parts for the current machines are not
being manufactured anymore. He explained that the method of voting is the same but the updated
hardware takes an image of the ballot with a full touch LED screen which increases voter interaction. He
explained that the Dual Threshold Detection is the only system that has this capability. He said that they
added a mark detection error that will pick up and ask the voter if they meant this vote with the ability
to cancel a ballot if it is incorrect. The intention is to make sure that every recount and audit comes out
exact.
Councillor Zondervan said that he is excited about the possibility but does raise privacy concerns
because its seems that there may be more back and forth interactions with poll workers which will lead
to a backup of people in line. As it relates to privacy concerns, Mr. Silvestro added that with the larger
screen and easy text, it allows instructions to come up more visibly and in multiple languages. He
explained that this screen allows less need for election staff to assist the voter, therefore giving the
voter more independence.
Councillor Zondervan asked about the mechanism for updating software. Mr. Silvestro answered that it
is a flash software update.
Councillor Carlone asked if the new equipment would perform fractional transfer. Ms. Cobb replied that
fractional transfer is a problem because a hand recount cannot be done. Ms. Waxman replied that the
City cannot switch to a fractional transfer without a Charter change and noted that new machine would
not change anything about how Proportional Representation is counted.
Councillor Toomey questioned if the machine will notify a voter if there is a mistake as opposed to a poll
worker notifying a voter that there is a mistake. Mr. Silvestro answered in the affirmative. Ms. Cobb
added that the name of a candidate does not appear on the screen and the new equipment is more
secure as it relates to confidentiality.
Mayor McGovern asked about necessary staffing on Election Day. Ms. Ford responded that there will
continue to be poll workers, clerks and wardens available on Election Day. Mr. Silvestro emphasized
that over 100 cities and towns in Massachusetts use this system.
Councillor Simmons asked if the current system is outdated. Mr. Silvestro explained that the new
system is similar but updated with newer equipment. Councillor Simmons asked if the new system will
affect people that the City hires for Election Day. Ms. Ford responded that it will not affect the number
of workers that are hired for Election Day. Mr. Silvestro added that LHS Associates, Inc. will have
representatives on site for the first election. He added that a tutorial can be put on the City’s website to
inform voters of the updated equipment and processes.

Councillor Toomey asked if there is any room for any type of mischief with this equipment. Ms. Cobb
responded that the State is ahead of the curve by allowing audits that will be done after every election.
She noted that Cambridge has been audited in the past and will likely be audited in the future. She
noted that these audits act as a protection.

Councillor Carlone asked if the new hardware will lead to faster results on election night. Mr. Silvestro
responded that it depends on how quickly the memory cards are received to get the memory cards
uploaded.
Councillor Zondervan asked if the new system is going to be used in the upcoming fall election. Mr.
Silvestro responded in the affirmative. He noted that the new units will be delivered mid-April which
will be followed by Election Commission staff. He said that poll workers will be trained as well. He
explained that LHS Associates, Inc. is obligated to develop a Cambridge-specific poll worker guide.
He said that the new machines will be in use for Election Day in September. He added that LHS
Associates, Inc. will be on-site until the day after the election.
Councillor Zondervan asked about the municipal election. Mr. Silvestro stated that the software
modification for the municipal election is on a different timeline. He said that they are working on initial
modifications with the hope that they will get the software package in June. He said that it is the hope
that the data version will be finalized with Election Commission sign off sometime in January of 2019
with completion in June of 2019.
Councillor Zondervan asked if they re-run old elections to verify accuracy of the equipment. Mr.
Silvestro responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Toomey asked if there is any way to make the circles used to mark a voter’s candidate choice
can be made larger for senior citizens. Mr. Silvestro responded in the negative. Councillor Toomey
asked if there is a maximum number of candidates that can be listed on a ballot. Mr. Silvestro
responded that the bid was 32 X 32 oval with a double-sided capability.
Mayor McGovern thanked all those present for their attendance.
The meeting adjourned at 2:31 p.m. on a motion by Councillor Simmons.
For the Committee,

Mayor Marc McGovern

Councillor Simmons asked if the new equipment will be used for all future elections. Mr. Silvestro
explained that currently no company has Proportional Representation software built but added that LHS
Associates, Inc. is currently in development to create software modification.
