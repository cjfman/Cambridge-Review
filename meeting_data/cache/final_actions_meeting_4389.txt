The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor McGovern on proposed Ordinance
2023-#7, Affordable Housing Overlay that passed to a second reading in Council on
September 11, 2023, and amended in Council on September 18, 2023.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor McGovern who said that the Council has an
opportunity tonight to add another tool to the toolbox to help increase our affordable housing
stock, to do what we can to help maintain the diversity of our City, and to prioritize people over
other things. Councillor McGovern recalled when the City passed inclusionary zoning after rent
control was voted out and noted that thousands of people have been housed over the years as a
result. Councillor McGovern commented that 30 years from now people will not remember who
voted for this, but many will continue to benefit from it.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Simmons who shared the quote “If you want
to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.” Councillor Simmons noted that what is
before the Council tonight is the result of the hard work of many, including the affordable
housing advocates. Councillor Simmons noted that there is no quick fix but with tools like this
affordable housing overlay we are creating opportunities for critically needed housing to be built
and for people who work in the community to be able to remain living in the community.
Councillor Simmons noted that while recognizing the importance of these amendments we must
remain aggressive in coming up with collaborative and creative ways to create more affordable
housing.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Azeem who said he was happy to be at this
point noting that it was almost a year ago that the amendments were introduced. Councillor
Azeem noted there have been over a dozen hearings, a lot of conversations and a notable number
of amendments. Councillor Azeem highlighted the recent story in the Boston Globe noting the
number of families that have received affordable housing in Cambridge because of the
Affordable Housing Overlay.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Nolan who said that she wanted to make sure
that the record is crystal clear and expressed her concern that this vote means you are either for
or against affordable housing. Councillor Nolan noted that Councillors with enough concerns to
cast a no vote tonight, also have a long, solid documentable history of supporting affordable
housing. Councillor Nolan noted that she was the first Councillor to propose ending parking
minimums and two family only zones, and that Councillor Carlone has worked to develop
affordable housing across the Country and Councillor Toner has made a number of votes in
support of affordable housing. Councillor Nolan expressed her concerns with the process and
noted the areas where she had hoped to be able to gain consensus through amendments so that
she could vote for this tonight.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Zondervan who said he was excited that the
City will be able to give more flexibility to developers to add and preserve open space while
creating affordable housing and that he looks forward to passing this set of amendments and to
building more affordable housing for residents.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Carlone who said he recognized that the 6-3
vote to approve the affordable housing overlay amendments is inevitable. Councillor Carlone

CALENDAR/UNFINISHED BUSINESS

said that what he has learned in his life is that there are no simple answers to complex problems.
Councillor Carlone noted that several individuals with expertise in affordable housing question
this approach. Councillor Carlone stated that the key to creating more affordable housing is
buying land, something he has been advocating for since he has been on the City Council and
that is what the City should be doing. Councillor Carlone shared that through his profession he
has learned that residents want to live in housing like their immediate neighbors, and that
families do not want to live in high rise buildings. Councillor Carlone also shared that he sees
this as Russian roulette zoning, and although he is not a lawyer, he thinks this will be
challengeable.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Toner who said he has many of the same
concerns expressed by Councillor Nolan and Councillor Carlone and he hopes that we can move
beyond the notion that you are either for it or against it. Councillor Toner noted that every
Councillor wants more affordable housing, and he would like to see more price points and
different types of housing so that everyone has an opportunity to purchase a home. Councillor
Toner noted that the amendments do not take into consideration folks living in the neighborhood
and it is a real concern that if you own a one or two family home along one of these corridors,
someone can build a 12 story building next to you. Councillor Toner noted that like Councillor
Nolan and Councillor Carlone, he hoped their proposed amendments would pass so that he could
vote for this.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor McGovern, followed by Councillor Nolan for
additional comments.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Vice Mayor Mallon who said she was excited to be
moving the amendments forward. Vice Mayor Mallon commented that every Councillor wants
to make sure we are protecting the most vulnerable in our community and providing them with
housing and while we may not all agree on how to do that, we work together and with others in
the community. Vice Mayor Mallon noted that advocates have their piece, affordable housing
builders have their piece, and it is the job of the City Council to put the puzzle pieces together
and create a policy and that is what we are doing. Vice Mayor Mallon acknowledged the
concerns of those who are not able to support the amendments. Vice Mayor Mallon noted she
was proud of the Council for putting these amendments forward and thanked the original
sponsors.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui noted that she comes to this from having lived on the 14th floor of the
Rindge Towers and that she appreciates the community that is created by tall buildings. Mayor
Siddiqui noted how difficult it is to build affordable housing and this is a tool that will make it
easier. Mayor Siddiqui stated that the conversation will be ongoing, and the Council will
respond to feedback and figure it out. The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui noted that she was happy that
this was moving forward.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor McGovern who made a motion to ordain
the Affordable Housing Overlay Ordinance 2023 #7, as amended. Copy Attached.
