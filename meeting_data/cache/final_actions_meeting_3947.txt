Housing Committee conducted a joint follow-up hearing on Tuesday, August 24, 2021 at 1:00 p.m. to
conduct a joint follow-up hearing to continue the discussion on the elimination of single and two-family
only zoning and restrictions on the type of housing that can be built city wide.
Present at the hearing via Zoom were Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor E. Denise
Simmons, Co-Chairs of the Housing Committee, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor

and a quorum was present, and the hearing was clearly audible to all participants.
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler opened the hearing and read from prepared Opening Remarks
(ATTACHMENT A).
Councillor Simmons stated that as she reviewed the maps and includes very interesting information. She
said that it is important to remember that zoning is a means to and end. She said that past zoning has led
to some of the racial and economic lack of diversity that we have, and we must unravel those issues and
try to look at it with new eyes with the idea of inclusion because the City’s zoning has pushed us in a
direction that we are separated out by income. She said that she would like to see some correlation
between what was in the Envision report and how that plays into this.
Councillor Nolan said that she is excited to continue the continuing the conversation about eliminating
single and two-family only zones. She said that it is a critically important conversation to have to
understand how we can match the needs of the City with the Zoning Ordinances to ensure that the
exclusionary policies of the past which prevented building in different parts of the city. She thanked all of
her colleagues for working on this issue and we are now in a position that we can start to move it forward
and make changes that are substantive and meaningful and understand the unintended consequences of
actions so that as we move forward, we can be assured that whatever changes are put in place will have
the intended impact.

Iram Farooq introduced City staff and asked Jeff Roberts to give an overview of the PowerPoint
presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He said that CDD put together information about zoning in
neighborhood resident areas of the city that include the districts that are zoned only for single family and
two-family dwellings as well as other lower scale residential districts. He said that this will be helpful as a
starting point for this discussion. He stated that they did try to keep this high-level and talk mainly about
what the City’s current zoning does and he hopes that that gives shape to some of the City Council’s
discussion about what will be desired for the future.
Councillor Zondervan thanked Mr. Roberts for the presentation and opened the meeting to questions for
the Law Department and clarifying questions for CDD. He noted that he asked people to submit questions
ahead of time and he has a few that he is going to start with. He said that Councillor Carlone and
Councillor Zondervan did submit questions and if other Councillors have questions, please free to ask
them.
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that Cambridge currently has a minimum lot size per unit in its zoning.
He asked if there is anything in the law that would prevent us from implementing a maximum lot size per
unit. Ms. Glowa responded that there is not a legal prohibition against imposing a maximum lot area
dwelling unit. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that Cambridge currently has areas that are zoned only
for single family homes. He asked if there is anything in the law that would prevent us from creating areas
zoned only for multi-family housing. Ms. Glowa said that there is not. She said that there are a couple of
complications. The first is that existing structures throughout the city, even if zoning changes, would still
be permitted to remain standing if they remain in their current condition or have the kinds of minor
changes that are allowed either as-of right or by Special Permit under the ordinance unless they were
removed, and redevelopment occurred, or new development occurred on other parcels you would still
have a lot of the remaining inventory that has been built up until now. Secondly, people do have the right
under the Zoning Act upon which our Zoning Ordinance is based and the authority for it derives from the
Zoning Act. She said that people can apply for a Variance to be free from the restrictions or limitations
under the Zoning Ordinance so someone could seek a Variance if you had every single district be multifamily only, somebody could seek a variance to build a single or two-family home.
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked is the City can prohibit down conversions through Cambridge’s
zoning code. For example, if someone had an apartment building or triple decker and wanted to tear it
down and build a single unit house. He asked if there was anything in the law that would prohibit the City
from preventing such action. Ms. Glowa responded that we cannot explicitly do that in that way. She said
that we can create either minimum or maximum lot area per dwelling unit requirements. She explained
that if the maximum lot area of the dwelling unit resulted in a unit being able to be no more than 1,500
square feet, you could remove the triple decker, but you can only erect a unit that was 1,500 square feet
unless you received a variance from that requirement. She said that if single-family were not permitted in
that district, you would need an additional variance to do that. She said that conditions have to be met to
get a variance, but it is something that people can seek to do.
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked Ms. Glowa to talk about the legal rationale for requiring affordability
in new housing and what the city needs to do to justify changes to those requirements. Ms. Farooq said
that any provision that links an affordability requirement would be most similar to our Inclusionary
Ordinance in the zoning. She said that the way that it works is that the City has to establish a basis for the
requirements that are put into place. Before the initial provision was adopted and each time that changes
are made to it, the City does a study to provide the justification for the specifics of what the ordinance is
going to require. She said that would be the percentage requirement for the affordable set aside. She said
that the study looks at both the housing situation in the City and demographic changes since the time of
the prior analysis. She said that it also includes an economic analysis to look at the effect of the

City of Cambridge

Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration CommitteeAugust 24, 2021

modifications to the inclusionary standards or set aside, financial feasibility and land values in
Cambridge. She said that she is happy to share the last inclusionary study that was done in 2016. She
noted that the people that the City hires to do this are people who are well-versed in inclusionary zoning
so there is also a scan of best practices across the country. She said that the study looks at both market
trends across the city. She said that if you look back to Rent Control, the initial inclusionary zoning tried
to figure out what was the proportion of affordability across the City and tried to set the threshold of
approximately 20% of the target. She said that the way that the ordinance was structured, the City was
trending down and so in the last study the City revamped the way that the formula worked to create a 20%
requirement but also at the same time, the financial piece of the analysis speaks to what is required in
order to offset the responsibility that is placed on a developer to provide the affordable housing. She said
that in the Inclusionary Ordinance, there is currently a 30% density bonus. She said that is the framework
of how that justification study works and if there were to be any changes to that, the City would need an
updated similar study to come up with what are the right balances on both the proportionality as well as
on any bonus that would be required to offset it. Ms. Glowa added that the nexus study is required under
the constitutional legal framework pertaining to opposing such requirements and in addition, what the
courts look at is whether the requirements are so burdensome as to constitute an uncompensated taking of
private property which would be considered unconstitutional. She said that is one of the reasons why
there is the need to provide a density bonus or some other benefit to the property owner to offset the
burden to the property owner from having to provide the affordable unit. She said that there are two
aspects: one is that there needs to be shown that there is a proportionality between the impacts of the new
development on affordable housing in the city and in addition you have to show that it is being done in
such a way that it is not unduly burdensome on the property owner and fits within the constitutional
framework so as to avoid being unconstitutional in the taking.
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that his understanding is that the affordability requirement is to be
structured as a density bonus and that the City can do other things as a density bonus as well. He asked if
there are limits to what can be offered as a density bonus. Are there legal or policy limits around that? Ms.
Glowa said that you can provide incentives to do certain things by giving additional leeway so you can
get some additional height by Special Permit if there are other benefits that are provided. That would be
done by the Special Permit granting authority. She said that she does not believe that it can be tied to a
right of first refusal to the city as that is not the kind of thing that is governed by zoning. She said that she
is not sure that that particular provision would be permissible. Iram Farooq added that the density bonus
is an incentive to do something that the City wants people to do when they are constructing a building.
That incentive could be framed around anything. She said that this has been discussed in the context of
enhanced sustainability or for even more affordability than what it is required by inclusionary. She said
that they did find as they took a broad-brush look is that for other things you might be able to make that
offset balance out more easily but for additional affordable units, it tends to be a much larger bonus
typically that is required than one would imagine. She said that in her mind the logic is if we are asking
them to build one more affordable unit, maybe the same of amount of bonus would equalize everything.
She said that it turns out that as you dive into the financial piece of it, the construction and then the longterm carrying costs of that unit are a much greater burden so the offset is much greater than the benefit
you are getting. She said that at some point if you are just doing that, it starts to become a very big
building. She said that the more things that we offer density bonuses for, we have to start to think about
what else we need to provide as relief at the same time so that the density bonus can be accommodated on
the site. She said that at some point you hit against dimensional requirements. She said that it gets
complicated quickly, but it is certainly is something that can be contemplated for things beyond just
affordability.
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that when we talk about zoning, we often focus on the City Council’s
role in it but there are other bodies such as the Planning Board and Board of Zoning Appeal that have a
big role in zoning and in terms of what can get built. He clarified that under State law, those bodies have

City of Cambridge

Page 4

Minutes

Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration CommitteeAugust 24, 2021

to exist, and the City Council could not perform those roles even if they wanted to take that work on. Ms.
Glowa clarified that under State law, the Board of Zoning Appeal is required to exist, but the Planning
Board has been designated by the City Council as a Special Permit granting authority for many Special
Permits. She said that the City Council could claim that role for itself. The City Council could take that
back from the Planning Board and issue Special Permits as the Special Permit granting authority, but you
cannot eliminate the BZA or the ability of people to apply for a Variance and certain other functions that
the Board of Zoning Appeal has under State law.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the purpose of the proposal is to add an inclusionary requirement for
smaller buildings below 10,000 square feet or 10 units and related to that there was discussion about
compensating for that requirement and in his earlier proposal the thought was that the City would
purchase the unit. He said that it is his understanding from this discussion is now that it has to be a
density bonus. Ms. Glowa responded that she did look at the questions that were sent and she was not at
the meeting where there was some discussion about these various discussions. She said that she would
like to make sure that she understood that in the chart it appears that if the total new dwelling unit that is
being constructed is one unit, that that one unit must be affordable. If that is true, then it is her belief that
it would be an unconstitutional taking. She said that the City does not have the right to take people’s
property unless it compensates people for the taking. She said that if the City intends to take a piece of
every property in the City, then all of those pieces of property would have to be paid for by the City. She
said that otherwise, the framework that allows for an inclusionary ordinance is that if you can show
through a nexus study that has been prepared that there are negative impacts on the provision of
affordable units by the construction of market rate units in the City and you can establish that those
impacts have adverse impact on the affordability, you can impose a requirement to provide some
affordable units to offset those negative impacts. She said that would establish the rough proportionality
of why we are imposing the requirement to provide the extra unit. However, in order to avoid it being a
taking, it is also important to avoid a constitutional takings challenge to provide a density bonus to offset
the expense to the owners so it would not be viewed as a taking. She said that is the balance that we have
tried to strike when the inclusionary ordinance was created and when it was modified. She said that if you
leave a property owner no ability to develop anything other than affordable housing, you are not creating
a category of allowable uses that a property owner can make of their property, you are requiring them to
create affordable housing whether they want to or not. She said that in all of the studies that have been
done, the two nexus studies that have been referred to in creating the original inclusionary ordinance and
then the 2017 changes, there would not be sufficient basis in those studies to support the requirements
that Councillor Zondervan has set forth in his chart and would be vulnerable to a challenge that
constituted an unconstitutional taking.
Councillor Zondervan said that he is hearing two things and trying to distinguish them in his mind. One is
to avoid it being taken and then the other one is to base it on the nexus study in terms of impact of the
construction. He said that if we hone in on the avoiding and being taken, what if we acknowledge that it
was taken and compensate for it. Ms. Glowa said that that would be extremely complicated as it is
merging our taking authority as a governmental entity but there is a clear, established process by which
we can do that. She said that she does not think it can be done through zoning. She said if the City were to
take someone’s property by eminent domain, there is a formula that the eminent domain statute provides
for the so-called pro tonto payment which is the statutorily presumed value of the taking and then the
owner has the right to challenge that pro tonto. She said that many owners do challenge the value of a pro
tonto payment and often results in lengthy litigation that can go on for years. The idea of taking by
eminent domain one or more units of property at each site that is developing new housing across the city
and the resultant potential for litigation with respect to any or some or most of those units would be
chaotic and extremely expensive. She said that she does not believe that the City can demand the taking
through the zoning laws. Ms. Glowa stated that the City can not require the owner to sell the City the
units. She said that there is a concept of private property rights that is well-established in the laws of the

City of Cambridge

Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration CommitteeAugust 24, 2021

country and she does not think that can be abrogated by the City taking it upon itself to demand that every
developer of new construction sell units to the City. She said that with respect to the density bonus, the
reason that that is used as the formula that has been challenged in Court and upheld by the Supreme Court
with some parameters and limitations. she said that it would be a very extreme approach under the City’s
eminent domain powers, and she is not sure it would be upheld as constitutional.
Councillor Carlone stated that he has two questions. If the zoning stated that one of the purposes was to
expand affordable housing in areas that are historically not open to affordable housing, couldn’t that be a
condition of the Special Permit. He said that a certain number could be part of the Special Permit goals
and if it is the same 20% that we have in bigger buildings, you could build up to 4 or maybe 3 without
this but once you go to 4, we are expecting the 5th unit to be affordable. Ms. Glowa said that if she
understands the question correctly, three units would be as-of-right but if you wanted to seek a Special
Permit you could get a Special Permit to build something that had 4 units and the condition for getting
that additional unit is that it would be affordable. Ms. Glowa said that that would probably fall under the
general rubric of the Court’s analysis of inclusionary zoning types of provisions. She said that we would
have to look, through a study, at whether there is a basis to be requiring that of people. She said that she
feels that that would require a nexus study establishing the rough proportionality for the need and it would
raise the question of whether sufficient compensation to an owner for doing that by merely saying only 3
are allowed as-of-right but if you go to 4 you can do it only if you make that 1 affordable. She said that
she needs to conduct more legal research and analysis. Councillor Carlone said that 1 or 2 are as-of-right
and anything above that is a Special Permit and within that Special Permit, 1 needs to be affordable. Ms.
Farooq added that if the purpose is to actually have more units on the sites, then a Special Permit for a lot
of people is a deterrent. It creates a hurdle and additional time and supporting an affordable unit may not
be a sufficient incentive to go for a Special Permit. Councillor Carlone stated that the City Council goals
are to create affordable housing at all levels. He said that there are many places where the City can add
housing if we reduce commercial development FARs. He said that if we are not going to create a range of
housing, he will be voting against it. He said that there is no reason to do this if there will not be a range
of housing.
Vice Mayor Mallon said that regarding the problem that we are trying to solve, we are trying to do two
things: when we think about single-family zoning only, we are thinking about the racist origins of zoning
and redlining and when we are thinking about creating multi-family housing even in zones that it is
currently allowed, because of the dimensional requirements and the non-conformity of the lots in the city,
it requires a lot of variances. She said that we need less instances of people going for these variances. She
said that we have all seen some cases that have gone before the BZA where whole units need to be
reduced due to parking requirements. This is what we are trying to avoid when thinking about
dimensional standards and what we need to do to our zoning to allow for multi-family to be built across
the city and downzoning of lots sizes where it is easier to build a single family on a lot that used to be a 2
or 3-family. She said that it sounds like the City Solicitor is saying that the current nexus study that we
originally had in place and was revised in 2017, it would cover the affordability in the instance if we were
to be adding a density bonus to get that affordability. She said that she would like clarification if the
current nexus study covers that if we were to proceed in that way or would we have to undergo a whole
new nexus study to think about this topic today. Ms. Glowa said that she does not think that is correct, she
believes that a new nexus study would be required.
Vice Mayor Mallon said that her other question is for CDD. She said that when the City Council was
looking at the Missing Middle Petition and having the conversation in the Ordinance Committee and at
the Planning Board, she seems to remember that the Planning Board expressed an interest in some kind of
study or strategy that they were involved in around the issue of eliminating single family zoning and
dimensional requirements. She said that she is curious how that would happen if the Planning Board
wanted to more involved in the study. She asked how that would work. Jeff Roberts responded that the

City of Cambridge

Page 6

Minutes

Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration CommitteeAugust 24, 2021

Planning Board did bring that up and he was hoping that the discussion that the City Council moved
forward with would give guidance as to how staff, and the Planning Board might proceed to think about
this issue. He said that the Planning Board’s schedule is fairly occupied so that can be an issue, but it is
not unusual to bring topics of broad planning interest to the Planning Board to have a discussion and
CDD welcomes the City Council’s input into what kinds of questions and information that it would like to
receive from the Planning Board. Vice Mayor Mallon said that it is her understanding that the hope is that
we have this conversation and we come up with broad strokes about what the staff would like to bring to
the Planning Board for that larger and broader conversation around single family zoning and dimensional
requirements. Mr. Roberts stated that is a way to do it. He said that he will not presume to tell the
committee how to proceed but if that is the way that the group wanted to go, that would be helpful to
CDD in framing the discussion with the Planning Board. Ms. Glowa added that the presentation was
worked on by CDD and the Law Department. She said that the reason that the Law Department put in the
provisions relating to the origins of the zoning act and the general principles that are set forth in the State
law are to lay out some of the parameters of areas that zoning can and cannot cover. She said that it is
helpful to look back at the broad principles which would help inform the City to some of the more
specific areas that the committee is trying to address through any particular zoning amendment. Vice
Mayor Mallon said that when we think about the parameters and the objectives, she would like to think
about the reason and purpose and what we are trying to accomplish.
Councillor McGovern thanked all for their comments and presentations. He said that if we look at the Call
of the Meeting it goes to what the Vice Mayor was saying. She said that everyone agrees that having
sections of the City that only single-family housing is not something that anyone wants. He does not want
to lose sight of what brought us to the conversation which is dismantling the systemic racism of zoning.
He said that we can take steps to change zoning, dimensional standards, etc. but how do we put things in
place that we get what we want. He said that we want to make sure that anything that is done is not just
symbolic in nature and actually helps to achieve the goals of creating more multi-family housing
throughout the City. He said that he appreciates the conversation and he cautioned that there should not be
“too much in the stew.”
Councillor Nolan said that the City Council unanimously adopted a Policy Order which explicitly stated
that the City Council is addressing the question of whether to eliminate single and two-family only zones
and move forward. She said that is the genesis of this issue. She asked if it would make sense that the
Planning Board have a joint meeting with the City Council. She said that she will speak with the CoChairs of the Housing Committee about a meeting about the possibility of inviting the Planning Board to
a meeting. Ms. Farooq said that in the past there have been instances where the City Council has had a
joint Roundtable meeting with the Planning Board.
Suzanne Blier, 5 Fuller Place, stated that this meeting has been incredibly informative. She talked about
the issue of consequences. She said that she learned that the value of a property if one has a parking space
on it increases by about $150,000. She asked how we can address the financial part so that we are not
setting up areas of the city with an equity disequilibrium based on that financial piece. She said that there
is huge amount of investment money going into Cambridge. She asked if there a way that we can track
where the money is coming from. She asked if there is a way that the City could legally do what some of
the west coast areas are doing and do an area-wide approach for employers who are housed in the city in
terms of how we approach housing, parking, transportation, and infrastructure.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that we may be expending a ton on energy for very little
benefit and casting aspersions on people that are underserved. She said that one of the things that this city
rarely does is figure out where we want to get to and then figure out how to get there. She noted that her
neighborhood is the subject of a lot of attacks by various people. She said that East Cambridge was
redlined and not on the downzoned list the Mr. Roberts provided. She said it was redlined because it was

full of immigrants. She stated her hope that we can stop throwing stones and instead figure out what the
goal is, how we can get there and how we can look at really important things.
Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, asked if the city knows how many “illegal units” are in attics and
basements that could be made legitimate with no FAR in the basement and in-law apartments, etc. She
said that it was said that existing structures were permitted to remain standing but if a significant building
burns down or a single-family burns down and it is in a zoned area, can that single-family be rebuilt if the
zoning changes. Regarding the 30% density bonus to a developer, she asked if that means that if they
wanted to build a 6-story building and they had a certain amount of inclusionary, would that allow them
to build a 9-story building to compensate for those units. She said that it was said that the City Council
could take over the work of the Planning Board. She said that she does not believe the City Council is
qualified to do that work.
Lee Farris spoke to the question of the goal. She said that to her, the goal of ending single-family and
two-family zoning is not a sufficient goal. She said that she would like the City Council to change that
goal to be ending single-family and two-family zoning in a way that is equitable and inclusive and does
not make current problems worse. She said that if we do not add a requirement for affordability into the
change, we will get a large increase in value of land and that will result in more multi-million dollars units
being built and no additional affordable units being built. She said that changes in zoning need to be
aimed at advantaging or benefitting the people who have been the most affected by the negative aspects
of the zoning.
Bill Boehm stated that he supports Lee Farris’ suggestion that we be more explicit about what we are
trying to do by undoing sing-family zoning in the city. He said that we should try to increase modest
multi-family housing production and that can be done through density bonuses, discourage large singlefamily construction behind existing homes and decrease paving in the city by undoing the requirement of
parking on private property.
Jonathan Behrens stated that this conversation has been going on for almost a year at this point. He said
that responsibility of the City Council is to avoid taking action that will do harm. He said that every
month that goes by with our current inclusionary zoning does harm. He said that he hopes that the City
Council will address this injustice.
Marie Elena Saccoccio, 55 Otis Street, stated that she is third generation in her homestead. She said that
lifting single-family zoning and allowing for multi-units on the same plot will increase the land value. She
said that regarding zoning and its history, there was already a very dense environment in East Cambridge
so if the City widely adopted setback and height restrictions that were not previously adopted, it was for a
reason. She said that most zoning was based on health and welfare. She encouraged the City Council to
stay in close proximity to the City Solicitor. She said that zoning is one of the most sacrosanct areas of the
law. She said that property law precedes this country.
Christopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street, stated that while every year that the rent goes up 7%, we will
continue losing more neighbors and friends. She said that we are losing friends to conversion of houses.
He said that he lost his home because the owner wanted to turn his unit into an Air BNB. He said that
these are ongoing situations where we are creating buildings that will last 100 years that do not match the
values that we believe in. He said that we are incentivizing those choices when we are incentivizing
people to build 1 or 2 unit building instead of more.
Councillor Carlone said that he agrees with Councillor Nolan about having a meeting with the Planning
Board.

Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler suggested that this be done via Policy Order for the next regular City
Council meeting.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he is personally fine with limiting single-family only construction in the
few districts where that is clearly the case but without somehow encouraging multi-family construction,
he does not believe that it will do anything.
Councillor Nolan said that there were questions that the committee needs to answer as a group to move to
the next steps. She asked if what we need is to answer those questions about what the goals are, what are
the general criteria for items that the committee agrees on and wants to move forward on. She said that
she thinks that just eliminating single and two-family only zones would at least allow for the possibility of
a greater number of units in places. She said that we need to get specific and move forward with zoning
language. She asked what is needed from the committee to move to the next phase. Ms. Farooq said that
having the answers to the questions so they can understand what the will of the committees which
represents a fair number of Councillors so that CDD knows that when they are drafting the zoning it is
actually going to have a chance of being what the City Council is looking for. More specificity is essential
for CDD to get started. Mr. Roberts said that one of the important questions for CDD is that they need a
place to start. The first part of the presentation was focusing on the general issue of how is it that the City
decides what areas to zone differently from other areas. He said that in the Missing Middle housing
petition, it was suggested was that maybe residential neighborhoods across the City should be zoned the
same. He said that as a starting point, it is helpful to know if we are looking at changing dimensional
requirements within the single and two-family zoning districts that we already have or are we looking at
the broader question of looking across the entire City and determining whether some areas should be
zoned more similar to one another in some way. Ms. Glowa added that there are two fairly significant
themes that are not necessarily related and do not necessarily have to be treated at the same time. She said
that she sees the elimination of zones that only allow for single or two-family houses as one fairly simple
problem that would be fairly easy to come up with zoning changes to address that. She said that if there
are other additional districts that you would want to look at it would be helpful to understand that as well
whether dimensional changes will be made to any or all of those districts. She said that she also sees the
modifications to the Inclusionary Ordinance or requirements to add affordability to new development as
being a somewhat discreet different, albeit very large, topic with a very complex set of issues which
would take longer to develop and may require a nexus study. She said that if the City Council’s goal is
primarily to move forward with the elimination of single and two-family only districts, perhaps with some
of those issues she touched on, it could be done more quickly and readily.

Brief History
• Most neighborhoods developed ca. 1850s-1930s
(some exceptions – e.g., Cambridge Highlands, Linden Park)
• Zoning enacted in 1924, new Ordinance in 1943
• Some areas “downzoned” by resident-led petitions over time
• E.g., North Cambridge (B), West Cambridge (A-1,A-2,B), Cambridgeport (C),
parts of Baldwin (B); small parts of Mid-Cambridge (B), The Port (B)
• Few major changes, many adaptations (rehabilitation, alteration, addition,
reconfiguration, condo conversion)
• Economic changes: “downs and ups”

How does zoning affect existing lots?
• Many lots meet some standards, not all

• Lots must meet all development standards to “conform”
• Nonconformance: Maintenance and some alterations allowed as-of-right, some

Appendix: Details of Yard Requirements
Yard variations:

• “-context”: Front yards can be reduced if the average front yards of the two
adjacent buildings are less than required, but can’t be reduced to less than 15’ (A1, A-2) or 10’ (B)
• “+sum to”: Both side yards need to add up to a set number (requiring at least
one side yard to be increased)
• “+formula”: Yard must meet a formula based on adding the height (“H”) to the
length (“L”) of the building facing that yard and dividing by a given denominator –
often more than minimum standard

Technical input for NLTP + Housing hearing on zoning

Dear City Councillors and CDD,
Thank you for continuing the conversation on ending exclusionary zoning in Cambridge. I'm sure you're all already well
aware of the values at stake here - fighting patterns of residential segregation, promoting more sustainable land use,
creating housing options at the lower price points that Cambridge residents desperately need, etc., etc. - and so I'm
primarily writing to offer some technical points that I learned and found important while working on the Missing Middle
Housing petition, which I hope will be useful in your efforts. (I have not coordinated this email with others on the MMH
team.)
#1 - While single-family-only and two-family-only districts are bad, zoning that effectively prohibits new multi-family
housing is a citywide problem.
This map is an illustration of the phenomenon - in the Res C districts of Cambridgeport, and even in the Res C-1 districts
of East Cambridge, Wellington-Harrington, and Mid-Cambridge, a clear majority of neighborhood lots do not allow
fourplexes under current zoning (and though I don't have the map handy, this is also true of threeplexes). All of the
negative consequences of apartment bans - both in terms of missed opportunities for new housing, as well as in terms
of the downconversions and McMansionization of existing housing - apply citywide.
#2 - While there are many different dimensional standards that impede the construction of small-scale multi-family
housing, the most important are minimum lot size per dwelling unit and parking minimums, with maximum FAR and
setbacks also important.
There are a number of reasons why you can't build a typical triple-decker on an average-sized 4000 sqft lot, even in a
Res C-1 zone:
- Three units on a 4000 sqft lot violates the minimum lot size per dwelling unit. No matter how you configure them,
three units are not allowed. (And 4000 sqft is roughly the median lot size, so on half the lots, the situation is even
worse.)
- There's not enough room to fit three independently-accessible parking spaces AND a triple-decker on the lot, but the
law requires three non-tandem parking spaces.
- Most triple deckers have an FAR of between 1.0 and 1.25, which is significantly more than what is allowed.
- Most triple deckers have side setbacks on the order of 5', which are significantly less than what is required. On narrow
lots, accommodating setback requirements is extremely difficult.
However, we concluded that it is usually possible to achieve the 30% open space required in a Res C-1 zone, and that
while most current triple-deckers are between 35' and 40' tall, the existing 35' height limits seem to work for modern
construction.
I especially want to highlight the minimum lot size per dwelling unit requirement because it does not affect built form in
the slightest - it simply requires the interior area to be split into fewer, larger, and therefore more expensive units. In
Res C-1, where the current max FAR is 0.75 building-sqft-per-lot-sqft, and the current minimum lot size per dwelling unit
is 1500 lot-sqft-per-unit, this essentially makes it infeasible to build anything with an average unit size smaller than 1500
* 0.75 = 1125 sqft (usually larger, because even if the lot area allows 2.6 units, the extra 0.6 doesn't do you any good).

This means that new 2BR and 1BR units - the least expensive and most in-demand - are currently extremely difficult to
build, even in Res C-1 (and the problem is even worse in every other neighborhood residential zone).
#3 - There are a number of factors, both zoning and non-zoning, that advantage single-family and two-family
construction over multi-family construction, which will need to be overcome or compensated for.
Single-family homes have a simpler ownership model than two-family and especially multi-family homes, which can
make development and sale easier. But in addition to that, in 2016, a zoning change was made to allow single- and twofamily homes to exempt any finished residential basement space from their FAR by-right, but not multi-family buildings.
This exemption strongly incentivizes new construction to be wider and squatter, so as to create as much "free"
basement space as possible, and also extremely strongly incentivizes new construction that is "on the fence" to err
towards building fewer units. Updating this exemption to include multi-family housing by-right is very important.
There's a bunch of things like this. For instance, Cambridge ordinances charge a lower building permit fee for 3-or-fewer
unit construction than for 4-or-more unit construction. But it's not just local; Massachusetts building code has tougher
requirements for multi-family buildings than single-family and two-family, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But it
will require counteracting.
The point is, encouraging and enabling multi-family housing at the small scale will require active incentives for building
more units. In the MMH petition, we suggested doing this through a maximum average unit size - or alternatively
phrased, a minimum number of units - but there are many different ways you might do it.
#4 - Every lot has its own idiosyncratic constraints, and what gets built is usually less than the maximum allowed by
zoning - so it is important to rezone broadly and flexibly if you want to see more multi-family housing built.
Lots come up for redevelopment fairly rarely - usually only when the building is near end-of-life, or when there is a
significant expansion opportunity. And because of peculiar lot geometries, or the desire to leave some existing aspect of
the lot in place, or all the factors mentioned in #3, or just the preferences of the property owner, it is not always the
case that people build the literal maximum number of units they are allowed. Furthermore, the tighter and more
convoluted a zoning program is, the less likely it is to be taken advantage of - we saw with the Affordable Housing
Overlay just how important a streamlined permitting process is, and my experience exploring small-scale developments
and speaking to architects in the process of working on MMH is that people will go to incredible lengths to avoid a
special permit requirement or a BZA hearing. So when coming up with zoning standards, I would urge you to aim for
broad applicability and flexible requirements.
These are far from the only things that I and others on the MMH team learned, and if any of you are interested in
discussing any other aspect of this issue, I hope you won't hesitate to reach out. I want to again express my appreciation
to you for having these discussions, and hope you find effective ways to move forward.
Thank you,
Allan Sadun
