COUNCILLOR AZEEM
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN

WHEREAS:

Some residents in Cambridge drive and benefit from off-street parking spaces. Not
every resident, however, drives a car, and so the City should not require, but still allow,
homes to have off-street parking spaces; and

WHEREAS:

Parking minimums can force homeowners and residential & commercial developers to
accommodate space for more parking than they deem necessary, leading to higher
project costs and a decrease in the number of units or amount of open space; and

WHEREAS:

The city should review its maximum parking requirement periodically to ensure they
meet our transportation and environmental goals; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct staff from the Community
Development and Law Departments to examine the Zoning Ordinance and provide
amendment language for consideration by the City Council to remove all other
references to parking minimums, including in Articles 13.000, 14.000, 15.000, 16.000,
17.000, and 20.000; and further be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct staff from the Community
Development and Law Departments to examine the Zoning Ordinance and provide
amendment language for commercial parking maximums.

What we’re hearing

Everybody's parking perspectives are unique to
their needs, circumstances, and values.

a

“I drive and it's awesome. What would be better is if we got rid of them bike lanes because it's so difficult to navigate around them. If there
was more accountability put on bikers. They get all this space in street. They should get pulled over if they don't stop at a red light. The city is
so geared just to biking. That's great and eco-friendly, but not all of us can just, like, ride bikes. Some of us have children, have other things
you need to do, you need to go farther distances and it's just not a vehicle friendly city. The parking in Harvard square is psychotic, you're
like parking in the middle of the street.” –ABBOT Focus Group
“I prefer to walk or take a bus or train, depending on how fast it’s coming. Because it’s easier to walk around and get errands done or when
you are with kids who want to explore the City. I also walk around for health reasons and for the environment. Cambridge has good signals
and respectful people so it’s comfortable to walk around. There is also very low crime so you don’t have to be scared walking.” –Spanish
Speaking Focus Group
“Can you do something about restaurant outdoor dining? They take too many parking spaces.” –Haitian Creole Speaking Focus Group

“I have not ridden a bike outside the parks in a while, because it scares me a little and I don’t have a proper bike. But in summer we always
go outside to ride bikes in nice weather in the park with kids.”–Spanish-Speaking Focus Group

“I go with my elderly parents to hospital appointments. It is very difficult to find permit parking near Mt Auburn Hospital.” –Bangla
speaking focus group
“Parking is hard, but I will never leave Cambridge. I am addicted to the City. I will never leave, I love it too much. “ –Danehy Park Day ‘21

What could be changed in zoning?
Change

What that would mean

Possible outcomes

Eliminate minimum
accessory parking
requirements for
residential uses

• Existing residential off-street
parking could be converted to
other uses (e.g., open space,
bicycle parking)
• If new housing units are added,
owner can choose how much offstreet parking to provide – could
provide more, less, or none

• Over time, reduction in ratio of
parking spaces to housing units
• Less auto traffic in residential
areas, more reliance on other
modes
• Conversion of some accessory to
principal use parking (if allowed)
• Increased demand for public
parking (e.g., on-street)
• Higher costs for off-street parking
• Lower costs for housing without
“bundled” parking

What could be changed in zoning?
Alternatives:
• Lower residential parking requirements based on information related to
demand/utilization (e.g., ACS mode shares, vehicle ownership, estimated effect
of future expanded sustainable transportation)
• Set parking minimums by district, with lowest requirements in areas best served
by transit
• Consider more exemptions to meet policy goals (e.g., allowing alternative use for
residential parking spaces where the resident doesn’t have a car)
• Allow reductions/waivers in exchange for specific mitigation – e.g., transit
subsidies, support for public improvements

How Maximum Ratios were Determined
• Studies for specific areas (e.g., Kendall Square, Central Square, Alewife)
• Evaluation of existing parking supply and demands

• Existing mode shares and future mode share goals
• How much new traffic can be created before intersections exceed critical sums
thresholds and then backing into what the maximum auto mode share can be for
new development
• Using projects with the lowest auto mode share as the goal for all future projects
• Cambridge is small in size, but areas are different enough that one maximum
parking ratio may not be perfect citywide

Possible outcomes

Reduce maximum
parking ratios for
non-residential use

• New non-residential buildings
would be more limited in how
much parking to build
• Uncertainty with existing buildings
and uses – how would additions or
alterations be treated if they
already exceed maximum ratios?

• Over time, fewer parking spaces
for non-residential users (e.g.,
employees, customers)
• Less auto traffic, more reliance on
other modes
• Increased demand for public
parking (e.g., meters, public
garages) if maximum ratios do not
meet anticipated demand
• Higher costs for off-street parking
• Possibly lower commercial rents (in
relative terms) for buildings with
less parking

What could be changed in zoning?
Alternatives:
• Consider impact/mitigation requirements based on the amount of parking
created – e.g., transit subsidies, TDM programs, public infrastructure
improvements
• Shift emphasis from required accessory parking to allowed principal-use parking
(regulated/controlled)

Parking Minimums Add Unnecessary Costs
“Parking requirements that are too high suggest that cities are forcing developers to build parking that
people don’t want, at the cost of housing units that people do want.”
-C.J. Gabbe, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental S tudies and S ciences at S anta Clara
University
“Seattle developers built 40% less parking than would have been required before their parking reforms in
2012, resulting in 18,000 fewer parking spaces and saving an estimated $537 million.”
-Gregory Pierce, as sociate director of the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation and a faculty in Urban Planning
at UCLA.
Off-Street Parking costs between $50,000 to $100,000 per spot. This equates to roughly $200 - $400 additional
in rent ($2400 to $4800 annually).

Removing Minimums Won’t Stop Parking
Can developers still build the same amount of parking? Yes, this allows
but does not require less parking.
Will developers stop building parking? No, parking is still valued by many
homeowners and tenants. Furthermore, financing requirements often demand it for
new developments and commercial tenants often require it to provide parking for
employees who commute by car and don’t live in the city.

Many cities have removed parking minimums
● Parking minimums were mainly introduced starting in the mid 20th century. In the
21st century, cities have started repealing them.
● Buffalo, NY and Hartford, CT led the way
○ “Buffalo Becomes First Major U.S. City to Eliminate Parking Minimums”
○ “Hartford Eliminates Parking Minimums Citywide”
● Since then many cities have followed
○ “In light of negative externalities, cities such as San Francisco and
Minneapolis have followed the lead of Buffalo and Hartford in eliminating
parking minimums entirely. Other cities have deregulated parking in key
development districts: Chicago, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Lexington (KY),
Spokane, and Santa Monica”

Analysis from Buffalo

High Level Trends, Parking Minimums Produce

● More traffic congestion; higher levels of air pollution/particulates
● Sprawling land use patterns
● Costs passed along to consumers (including non-drivers) in the form of higher
rents, higher prices of goods and lower salaries

Analysis from Buffalo: More Shared Parking
● Rather than build parking, developers shared parking
○ Four mixed-use projects tracked by the researchers built no parking spaces
■ These projects relied on shared parking networks instead of building
new parking which enabled them to provide parking access without
dedicating excess space
○ One mixed-use project tracked by the researchers built notably more
spaces (17) than it would have needed to build under the old rules
■ Intentional → project had entered into a shared parking arrangement
with adjacent mixed-use project
■ Result was 71 fewer total spaces between the two sites than
previously required

Analysis from Buffalo: More Viable Housing
● Transit-oriented development got a boost
○ Two mixed-use projects along the Main Street transit corridor in Buffalo, NY
created hundreds of units of student housing.
○ Researchers suggest that the added cost of the old parking requirements had
served as a deterrent to new development in transit-friendly areas.
● Adaptive reuse projects also became more viable
○ One small-scale mixed-use development near a light rail station rehabilitated an
old structure into 10 new apartments with ground floor retail space.
■ Project not feasible under the old parking requirements
● Called for 10 spaces on the site despite its close proximity to transit.
