Executive Summary

§ Our FY24 budget reflects investments in the ongoing commitments we started 30
years ago with the first implementation of Community Oriented Policing and the rising
costs of benefits and salaries (particularly those collectively bargained)
§ Councilors and residents have questioned the size of our budget, given at first glance,
Somerville’s police budget looks strikingly lower than Cambridge’s
§ After accounting for methodology, salary, population and calls for service differences,
the budgets are comparable
§ Cambridge has invested over the years in programs to promote CPD diversity, support
diversion, enhance procedural justice, and ensure community preparedness
§ These programs embed CPD throughout Cambridge’s ecosystem and have a tangible
impact on our residents’ lives and our ability to respond in crisis
