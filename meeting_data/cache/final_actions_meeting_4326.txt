‚Ä¢

Modifies footnote (c) to remove language which requires a greater rear yard setback in
Residence A-1, A-2, C and C-1 districts when the depth of the lot exceeds one hundred feet
(100‚Äô).
Eliminates footnote (i) related to dimensional standards of the Residence C-1 district, which is
proposed to be eliminated.
Eliminates footnote (j), currently applicable to the Residence B district, which modifies the
allowable FAR and Minimum Lot Area per Dwelling Unit calculations for portions of lots over
5,000 square feet, with additional requirements related lots that are subdivided.
Adds a new footnote (q) which states that Residential Uses (Section 4.31.a thru h) have a
Minimum Lot Area per Dwelling Unit of three hundred square feet (300 sq/ft).

The Petition makes additional modifications to the Dimensional Standards for Residential Uses in Article
5.00, as follows:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Eliminates a setback exception in Residence A-1 and A-2 districts which allows the front yard
setback of dwellings to match the average setback of other principal buildings on adjacent lots.
Creates a new Section 5.31.4 which states that mixed-use structures in Section 5.30.11.a (note:
Section 5.30.11.a is a newly-proposed section, further discussed below) with a ‚Äúfront lot line‚Äù on
Broadway, Cambridge Street, Columbia Street, Concord Avenue, Hampshire Street, Huron

Residential District Changes ‚Äì Use Standards
In addition to the map and dimensional standards above, the Petition amends the Table of Use
Regulations in Section 4.30 as follows:
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

Residence ‚ÄúA‚Äù ‚Äì Makes two-family dwellings (4.31.b), townhouse developments (4.31.d), and
conversion of existing dwellings for more than two families (4.31.h) a permitted use (currently
prohibited).
o The Petition also removes a footnote #2 for Existing one-family detached dwelling
converted for two families (4.31.c) that stipulates that the exterior design of the
structure is not changed.
Residence B ‚Äì Makes multifamily dwellings (4.31.g) as-of-right (currently prohibited).
o The Petition also removes a footnote #3 for Townhouse development (4.31.d) requiring
that a Planning Board Special Permit be obtained for development subject to the
Townhouse Development ordinance in Section 11.10.
The Petition makes the following additional changes to the Residential Use table:
o Eliminates footnote #3 for Townhouse development in all Residence districts.
o Eliminates footnote #17 for Existing dwelling converted for elderly oriented congregate
housing (4.31.f) which requires that in Residence A districts, the exterior design of the
structure is not changed unless a Planning Board Special Permit is granted.

Business District Changes ‚Äì Dimensional Standards
The Petition makes modifications to the Table of Dimensional Requirements for Business Districts in
Section 5.33, as follows:
‚Ä¢

FAR
o

‚Ä¢

The Petition generally increases the allowable FAR for residential and non-residential
uses in the Business A, A-1, A-2, A-3, B, and C districts. In some cases, the allowable
residential FAR is more than doubled over what is existing (e.g., Business B is increased
from 3.0 FAR to 7.0 FAR).
o In other cases, where there is currently only a general FAR limit, the FAR limit is
modified such that there is now a different FAR limit for non-residential uses than for
residential uses (e.g., Business A-2 currently has a 1.0 FAR for all uses, and is modified
such that non-residential FAR is 1.0 and residential FAR is 3.0).

‚Ä¢

The Petition generally reduces the existing minimum lot area per dwelling unit
requirements for several districts, including the Business A, A-2, B, and C. In the Business
B and C districts specifically, the requirement is eliminated altogether.
o A new footnote (q) is added to the Business A-3 district which states that the Minimum
Lot Area per Dwelling Unit is 300 sq/ft.
Minimum Yard Requirements
o As with the Residence districts, the Petition modifies the minimum setback
requirements in many Business districts to move from a formula-based setback
provision to an absolute requirement:
‚ñ™ In Business A and A-1 districts, the rear yard setback is changed to 15‚Äô.
‚ñ™ In the Business A-3 district, all setbacks are changed from formula setbacks to a
10‚Äô front yard, 7.5‚Äô side yard, and 15‚Äô rear yard requirement.
Maximum Building Height
o The maximum building height is changed in Business A, A-2, and C districts to generally
allow for taller heights for residential uses (60-65‚Äô) compared to non-residential uses.
Dimensional Footnotes
o The Petition makes modification to several footnotes in the Business District
dimensional table:
‚ñ™ Footnotes (a), (b), (l), (m), (n), and o are proposed to be eliminated. In some
cases, these footnotes place additional conditions on some of the dimensional
requirements in the table itself, like noting that in Business A districts,
regardless of the rear yard formula setback, no building may be located nearer
than twenty feet (20‚Äô) from the rear property line. In other cases, the footnotes
are tied to a district that is proposed to be eliminated (i.e., Business C-1).
‚ñ™ Footnote (g) is modified to clarify that the height limitations in Business C
pertain only to non-residential development.
‚ñ™ Footnote (j) is modified to expand the provision to all Business districts that no
rear yard is required where the rear lot line abuts a lot in a business or industrial
district.
‚ñ™ Footnote (k) is modified to expand a required height bulk control plane from
Business A-2 to include the Business A district, and provides provisions for how
that bulk control plane could be exceeded. The footnote is also modified to
eliminate a height stepdown requirement when a building is within fifty feet
(50‚Äô) of a residential zoning district.
‚ñ™ A new footnote (q) is created which stipulates that the Minimum Lot Area per
Dwelling Unit for Residential Uses (4.31 a-h) is 300 square feet.

Other Proposed Dimensional Changes
In addition to the modifications to the residence and business district dimensional standards, the
Petition adds new sections to Section 5.30 District Dimensional Standards and amends existing
provisions:

Creates new (a) and (b) under 5.30.11 which states that buildings with non-residential uses and
residential uses may utilize the residential heights described in the dimensional table for
residence and business districts; and that stories 75% or more below grade shall not count
against FAR.
Adds a new Section 5.33.9 ‚Äì Requires certain types of non-residential ground floor uses when a
mixed-use building is utilizing the taller heights permitted by Section 5.30.11.a. The Section
establishes the range of non-residential uses that are permitted and establishes design
requirements associated with those uses.
Amends Section 5.53 such that in Residence A districts, a second principal dwelling can be
located on a lot, subject to existing requirements (e.g., that a Planning Board Special Permit be
obtained if the second dwelling is located more than seventy-five feet from the street line).

Other Proposed Ordinance Changes
The Petition proposes amending several other parts of the Zoning Ordinance, which are summarized
below:
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

Article 8 ‚Äì Nonconformities
o Removes a requirement that administratively-approved conforming additions to
nonconforming structures must not increase the volume or area of the nonconforming
structure by more than ten (10) percent since the structure first became
nonconforming.
o Removes a requirement that alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure,
for which the BZA can grant a special permit, shall not increase the area or volume of
the nonconforming structure by more than twenty-five (25) percent since the structure
first became nonconforming.
Article 11 ‚Äì Townhouse Development
o Removes references that townhouses are limited to one and two-families.
o Clarifies that townhouse developments are permitted in all Residence districts.
o Modifies the special permit applicability for townhouses to six (6) or more dwelling units
in Residence A districts (rather than C districts).
o Amends the maximum height of townhouses as follows:
‚ñ™ Revises the height from four stories to the ‚Äúlesser of the base zoning max height
and four habitable stories‚Äù.
‚ñ™ Creates opportunity to exceed the bulk control plane requirements in Section
11.15.3.
‚ñ™ Eliminates a height limitation of thirty-five feet in Residence B districts.
Article 11 ‚Äì Affordable Housing Overlay
o Further restricts the FAR limit for AHO developments such that an AHO project is limited
to a 2.00 FAR when the District Dimensional Standard FAR is less than 1.50 (currently,
1.00).

area available for residential development on a donating lot be that resulting from an
FAR of 1.5 in a Residence C district (rather than 0.75).

Comments on Proposed Zoning
Overall Considerations
The Petition represents a ‚Äútectonic shift‚Äù in the way many zoning districts and dimensional standards
would be characterized within the City, which could have fundamental, cascading effects throughout the
entire Zoning Ordinance. Without further study of the proposed Petition, it is hard to predict what the
outcomes of the Petition might be.
The Petition proposes several changes to parts of the Zoning Ordinance that are currently (or soon to
be) under further study; including:
‚Ä¢

Alewife ‚Äì The Alewife Zoning Working Group process is completed, and a zoning proposal will
soon be forwarded to City Council for its consideration.

Cambridge Street ‚Äì The Our Cambridge Street Study is completed, and a zoning proposal will
also soon be submitted to City Council.
A North Mass Ave Planning Study will commence later this summer.
Zoning to allow multifamily citywide ‚Äì currently being discussed in Housing Committee.
Potential Affordable Housing Overlay Amendments ‚Äì has been discussed in Housing Committee,
and a Policy Order has been adopted directing Community Development Department staff to
draft a zoning petition in response.

If enacted, this Petition would ‚Äúshort circuit‚Äù those planning efforts, requiring a rethinking of how those
other efforts should be implemented within a fundamentally different zoning context. Further study
could be required under these efforts before being able to move forward.
The Petition states that one of its intended goals is to permit development of buildings that are similar
to what currently exists throughout the City, but there is no accompanying study to support the
rationale for the proposed use and dimensional changes, or how enacting the proposed changes will
result in a prevailing development pattern that matches the existing built environment. Many of the
neighborhoods in the districts proposed to change are older neighborhoods that were built under
different zoning requirements, but also different building codes, construction methods and economic
factors that have also fundamentally changed. There is no guarantee that enacting the proposed zoning
changes would therefore result in development that is akin to the types of buildings that exist in these
areas.
Another stated goal of the petition is to reverse ‚Äúdownzoning‚Äù that occurred historically in Cambridge,
but the Petition does not discuss this concept or how the zoning has changed in Cambridge over time. As
discussed thoroughly in the CDD staff memo on the Missing Middle Housing zoning petition in 2021,
Cambridge‚Äôs zoning was changed to be more permissive in the 1960s, in order to encourage
development and reverse disinvestment that resulted following the Great Depression and World War II.
In the decades that followed, however, the Zoning Ordinance was further amended to be gradually
more restrictive over time. In 2001, the City underwent a citywide rezoning effort which aimed at
encouraging mixed-use and residential development in areas of the City that would be more likely to
redevelop. In 2019, the City adopted the Envision Cambridge Comprehensive Plan which sets forth a
planning framework by which future zoning changes should be studied ‚Äì by focusing on specific areas of
the City and developing tailored recommendations for zoning changes that are fully informed by public
input and meant to achieve deliberate outcomes.
While the Petition‚Äôs stated goals relate to housing development, some of the proposed zoning changes
have the effect of increasing restrictions on residential uses, or creating greater allowances for nonresidential development, which could result in an environment where commercial development, from
an economic perspective, is a preferred land use type for development. As stated previously, many of
the changes proposed herein have not been studied or vetted to determine whether the proposed
changes would achieve the outcomes that are intended by the Petitioner.
Some of the proposed changes remove the requirement to obtain a special permit for certain types or
scales of development. In many of these cases, a special permit requirement was instituted because

1.a

exceeding a base zoning provision requires a more delicate planning approach, and review of proposals
on a case-by-case basis helps to ensure that the potential impacts are balanced/mitigated and the
overall planning objective is achieved. Without additional context or rationale, it is difficult to determine
whether the removal of a special permit requirement is in furtherance of the stated objectives of the
Petition.
Similarly, many of the City‚Äôs overlay district provisions were put in place because a certain area of the
City required a more tailored planning approach. Modifying or eliminating provisions in these districts ‚Äúa
la carte‚Äù could run counter to the original objective of these Districts, and proposed changes should be
reviewed holistically in the context of specific area planning considerations.
Specific Considerations ‚Äì Residence District Changes
Many of the Petition‚Äôs proposed changes would affect development in Cambridge‚Äôs lower-scale
neighborhoods. From a policy perspective, the concept of permitting greater density for multifamily or
townhouse developments and lower density for single- and two-family development could be a way of
achieving incremental density without encouraging ‚Äúoversized‚Äù homes. However, it is unclear from the
Petition how certain dimensional standards were arrived at, or what the rationale was behind many of
the proposed changes. For example, the Petition removes a formula-based setback approach for many
residential districts and replaces it with an absolute number, but the Petition does not describe how
such a number was decided. Other standards, like minimum open space standards, help the City achieve
other policy goals like climate resilience, and potential impacts to these competing policy priorities
should be weighed holistically before changes are proposed.
The Petition proposes several changes to the City‚Äôs Townhouse Development regulations. These
regulations were put in place in the 1970s and became a popular infill development approach in the
1980s. Today, the City does not typically see new townhouse developments proposed under this Article,
and the regulations are narrowly tailored and cumbersome. Prior to revisiting these requirements, a
broader conversation should occur to determine whether townhouse-style development or other
‚Äúcluster development‚Äù is something the City wants to encourage in residential areas, or if these
provisions should be removed from the Zoning Ordinance altogether.
The Petition creates a concept by which ‚Äúmixed-use structures‚Äù follow a similar set of development
standards as residential uses, which is confusing because many of the City‚Äôs residence districts do not
permit non-residential uses. Again, prior to enacting zoning changes that would encourage mixed-use
development in residential areas, the City should have a conversation about what specific streets or
neighborhoods are appropriate to include a range of ground-story commercial uses, and those areas
could be rezoned to accommodate that broader mix of uses.
Specific Considerations ‚Äì Business District Changes
As noted earlier in this memo, the Petition proposes changes in areas that are currently or will soon be
undergoing planning studies that could include zoning changes. A key benefit of an area-specific or

1.a

neighborhood planning approach is the ability to make tailored zoning recommendations to achieve the
planning objectives of that area. Specific design standards, use considerations, and review procedures
can be created that more closely align with neighborhood goals.
The Petition proposes increasing the non-residential FAR in Business A, B, and C districts, which may
have the effect of encouraging commercial development over housing development in these areas.
Further, the Petition creates a concept of a ‚Äúmixed-use structure‚Äù which means locating residential
development over ground-story commercial uses. While this development style has been replicated and
realized throughout the City, the City has also seen other development scenarios where uses are sideby-side rather than stacked on top of one another where a vertical arrangement of land uses may be
infeasible or impractical due to other development considerations.
The proposed Section 5.33.9 appears modeled after regulations that exist in the Mass Ave Overlay
District, which require certain ground-story non-residential uses and associated dimensional
requirements for lots fronting Mass Ave. In this case, the requirement functions more like an incentive,
where a mixed-use development meeting these requirements can achieve the heights that are
permitted for residential developments, but it is not entirely clear from the language what the incentive
would be or how it would work.
Specific Considerations ‚Äì Other Changes
The Petition proposes several other changes which would require further study and review by the City.
For example, the Petition proposes a number of modifications to the City‚Äôs Nonconformities provisions,
which were updated as recently as 2021 in response to state statutes and case law around
nonconformity. There may be legal issues with changes to these provisions. The Petition changes how
some dimensional standards are calculated citywide, such as stating that stories 75% or more below
grade do not count towards FAR; a change which conflicts with recently-adopted standards as part of
the City‚Äôs Climate Resilience Zoning.
There are additional challenges with the form of the petition, where provisions are unclear or appear in
direct conflict with other provisions in the Ordinance. For example, the Petition references a
reclassification of Neighborhoods 4, 5, and 6 from Residence B to Residence C, but there is no
accompanying map or supporting material that describes these neighborhoods or defines their
boundaries. Another example is that the proposed minimum lot area per dwelling unit changes are
confusing, because they remain the same in the dimensional tables but a footnote is included which
stipulates that the minimum lot area per dwelling unit for residential units is 300 square feet.
Conclusions
Prior to this Petition advancing, staff would recommend further study on the proposed changes and how
they might interact with zoning changes being contemplated as part of ongoing planning work by the

City. The Board may also suggest that guidance be sought from the Law Department on some of the
legal issues and questions raised in this memo. Finally, staff would recommend at a minimum that a
careful review of the language be undertaken to make it more consistent with language already in effect
in the Zoning Ordinance and remove any potential conflicts and ambiguities.
