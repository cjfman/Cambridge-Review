AHO Example Site Models (CDD)
• Walden Neighbors reviewed models CDD presented to Councillors
• Community Development AHO studies focused primarily on lowscale residential and moderate-scaled commercial zones
• Walden Square II Development Proposal:
• Significantly different in mass and length than examples presented to
Councillors

• Many councillors shocked by Walden Square proposal and told us it
was NOT what was presented to them
• Walden Neighbors encourages better alternative designs for this site
but also requests setback modifications for this site and for
Cambridge as a whole

• Developers proposed flawed design allowed under present AHO
• AHO allows encroaching setback that would not be permitted under
base zoning
• Example: Walden Square 2 setback with AHO side yard of only 10
feet is inappropriate for the proposed building 450 feet long and
approximately 85 feet in (average) height.
• C-2 Base District Setback Formula: H+L/5 = 85’+450’/5 = 107’ setback
• 10 feet in plan submitted vs 107 foot base zoning setback for this
mass

Communication: Yamin petition_20211221 (Public Hearings)

Walden Square Proposal—Setback Issues

• “Compatible with Existing Neighborhood Context”
• “Guidelines intended to promote Affordable Housing development
that benefit their residents, are good neighbors, and serve the quality
of life in Cambridge”
• Setback must change as building density/mass grows.
• This is a basic tenet of zoning

• AHO as presented does not properly address setback
• Walden Neighbors request that Council and Planning Board review
and revise setback accordingly

Building Better Affordable Housing

• New Legislation often requires refining
• We can solve this together to build better affordable housing in
Cambridge
