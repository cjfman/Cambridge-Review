Introduction
In 2016, the Cambridge City Council adopted Vision Zero, and in February of 2018, the City released the
Vision Zero Action Plan. This report outlines the City’s accomplishments and challenges faced in the first year
after the release of the Vision Zero Cambridge Action Plan, and provides next steps for implementation.
Both the City of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Vision Zero Coalition are committed to transparency in the
reporting on progress of Vision Zero initiatives and reaching the goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries in
Cambridge. This progress report, jointly released by the Coalition and the City, is a collaboration that bridges
community members, advocacy organizations, and municipal entities. Producing a joint report ensures
transparency and accountability by deploying the Vision Zero Coalition as a third party to assess the City’s
progress.
The framework of this report aligns with the guidelines published by the national Vision Zero Network in
“Vision Zero: Planning an Effective Road Map For Action.” The guidelines lay out two key areas of a strong
Action Plan: Foundational Elements and Actionable Strategies, which are both underpinned by a process of
continued community engagement and attention to prioritizing equity.
The City of Cambridge has shown leadership in integrating Vision Zero throughout relevant departments, and
continues to demonstrate a commitment to safe streets for all people. In particular, the City has gone above
and beyond their Action Plan goals related to speed management, committing to implement a speed limit of
20 mph on primarily local-access streets across the city. The City faces challenges around access to accurate
data, which impacts its ability to measure progress on aspects of Vision Zero such as injury crashes. In
addition, balancing ambitious implementation of safety projects with community support is an important
process that the City continues to engage in.
The City plans to release an updated Action Plan within the next year, which will build off of the next steps
included in this report and ensure that the City is being responsive to current conditions and emerging trends,
communicating transparently with the public about progress, and setting new, measurable goals.
The City of Cambridge and the Vision Zero Coalition look forward to continuing working together on further
planning, implementation, and evaluation efforts.

Vision Zero Fundamentals

Vision Zero Fundamentals are the core elements required to
support systemic change on our streets. They allow
municipalities to create goals that are concrete and actiondriven, while being responsive to the context and needs of the
community served.

Build a Robust Data Framework
Vision Zero is a data-driven approach. Both gathering, analyzing, utilizing, and sharing data on crashes and
collecting community input to understand traffic safety priorities is fundamental to Vision Zero success.

The City of Cambridge has shown leadership in the development of a data strategy and
thoughtfulness about tracking indicators that prioritize safety outcomes. However, the City
should work to share their data strategy with the general public and provide more
information about how data is used to inform their project selections.

Achievements:
Releasing a crash analysis report showing crash
trends and locations.
Creating a data strategy that lays out how the
City will collect and disseminate data.
Police Department consistently reporting crash
data to the State and other City departments.
Updating the open data portal to include a
Vision Zero tag, so that users can easily search
for related datasets.

Challenges:
Data around the severity of injuries from crashes is limited. Using data related to Emergency
Medical Services (EMS) transports leaves out many injury crashes involving people who seek medical
treatment on their own. Crash reports do not provide the necessary data because police officers are
not always able to accurately assess injury severity, and people who have been in a crash may not be
aware of their own injuries in the immediate aftermath of a crash. Additionally, data from healthcare
providers can be difficult to access because of privacy laws.
Non-motorist crashes are underreported. In part, this is because when a crash doesn’t result in
damage to a motor vehicle, there is less incentive for involved parties to report crashes for insurance
reasons. In addition, the State's crash form for police officers was originally designed to report on
collisions involving motor vehicles, so there is often limited information provided about the
circumstances of crashes involving people walking and biking.
In addition to challenges around accessing data, it is challenging to select specific indicators to
track progress. Many benchmarks do not directly connect back to the goal of Vision Zero. For
example, a project that results in lower speeds may not always see a reduction in the number of
overall crashes, but there may be a key reduction in severe injuries and fatalities, as the severity of
each individual crash is minimized.

Next steps:
Clearly communicate about what data is available and what the
strategies and goals are around data sharing.
Create a data dashboard that provides high-level information
like the number of crashes involving people walking or biking in
an easy-to-access format.
Continue to develop a list of indicators that can be tracked to
help measure success.
Begin conversations with partners in the region about
opportunities to improve access to serious injury data.

Set Measurable Goals with a Clear
Timeline for Implementation
Clear, measurable short-term and mid-term goals, combined with timelines and ownership from responsible
City departments, creates a framework that is easier to evaluate and fund, and builds buy-in, accountability,
and transparency throughout the implementation process.

The City has shown leadership in developing an Action Plan with concrete goals and
timelines. Including action items that cover practices that were already underway in
Cambridge before the commitment to Vision Zero serves as a testament to the City’s longstanding commitment to traffic safety. However, the City may benefit from focusing on a
smaller number of goals and setting new, measurable stretch goals in order to
demonstrate leadership in making bolder, more ambitious progress on Vision Zero.
Regularly updating the Action Plan is a best practice and will help to address these issues.

Achievements:
Setting concrete and actionable goals in the
Action Plan, including goal years.
Ensuring that both the development and
implementation of the Action Plan were
multi-department efforts, so that the work
is shared among many staff members.

Challenges:
The Action Plan was ambitious by design, and was intended to help the City chart an aggressive
course of action. Therefore, the Action Plan included targets that were aspirational in that they
might not be achievable in the designated time frame. However, this was not made clear to the
community through a system of prioritization or by providing details about feasibility.

Photo: Nicolaus Czarnecki

Next steps:
Update the Action Plan to reflect the progress achieved and
to set new goals and timelines. The plan must be clear
about which items are priorities for completion, with
timelines attached, and which are meant to be aspirational.
Keep pace with the Action Plan’s intended deadlines.

Be Accountable
Vision Zero is rooted in the shared responsibility among many City departments to design and operate safe
systems for transportation. This includes creating clear ownership and budget implications for each of the
Action Plan strategies.

The City of Cambridge has trained staff on Vision Zero principles and has shown leadership
in integrating Vision Zero throughout relevant departments, projects, and policies. To build
off of this success, the City should ensure there are well thought-out implementation
strategies for each action item, including which staff members are responsible for the
execution and reporting back.

Achievements:
Demonstrating top-down support for Vision Zero as
a strategy, integrating Vision Zero into all relevant
departments and City plans, including Envision
Cambridge and the Community Health
Improvement Plan.
Committing to providing Action Plan evaluations
and updates.

Ensure Transparency
The process of establishing baseline data, creating an Action Plan, and assessing progress towards the goal of
zero must be transparent to the public.

The City has made an important commitment to transparency by developing the Action
Plan in-house with input from all relevant departments. The City furthered this commitment
to transparency by hiring a Communications Manager for the Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Department. This new staff person helps existing staff members explore
opportunities to improve transparency and communication between the City and
constituents, including helping to execute some of the communications initiatives outlined
in the Action Plan.

Achievements:
Following up on all crashes on Cityowned streets, and sharing important
data with partners at the state level.
Establishing the Vision Zero Advisory
Committee, holding quarterly
Committee meetings, and working with
the Committee to establish goals.

Challenges:
Because Vision Zero projects and initiatives are integrated among many departments, it can be
difficult for community members to know what work is being done across the city. The City must
work to develop a streamlined process for sharing updates on the Action Plan goals.

Building Safer Streets
The City has built upon a solid foundation of safety-focused projects and policies, and has
made good progress on many of the Action Plan goals. The next step is to develop standard
evaluation methods in order to track the effectiveness of implemented projects.

Achievements:
Implementing three separated bike lane projects in FY18
on Brattle St, Cambridge St, and Mass Ave in Harvard
Square and three projects in FY19 on South Mass Ave, Main
St (westbound), and Ames St (Broadway to Main) to keep
pace with Action Plan goals.
Adding additional green markings, installing rectangular
rapid flash beacons (RRFBs), installing additional
Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS units), and making
signal improvements at intersections (including a
significantly lengthened head start for pedestrians in
Central Square).
Making strides in improving truck safety, including: holding
an urban freight forum with a focus on truck safety;
compiling a draft truck side guard ordinance; and installing
side guards on most eligible City-owned vehicles.
City Council passing an ordinance that mandates protected
bike lanes be installed on any street that is being
reconstructed and has been previously identified as part of
the separated network in the Cambridge Bicycle Plan.

Challenges:
Pavement markings are a primary tool for re-designing streets and reaching Vision Zero goals;
however, installation is contingent on certain weather and seasonal conditions. Pavement
markings cannot be installed when the pavement is wet or on days when the low temperature is
below fifty degrees. The City works to make the most out of the pavement marking season, but
projects can be stalled at any moment due to rain, and the paving season can end unexpectedly if
cold weather comes early.
As is typical in many cities, a significant portion of pavement markings are installed by companies
that are contracted by several different municipalities. Since contractors must balance their
schedules between different places, project installation can take longer than desired.
Quick-build projects are relatively new in Cambridge and result in faster-paced implementation
than some residents are accustomed to. Community support for projects can pose a challenge to
the pace of implementation.
Some intersections and corridors in Cambridge where serious and fatal crashes have occurred are
owned or managed by the State or private entities. The City does not have the authority to make
changes in these places but will continue to participate in conversations about how to make
improvements in these locations.

Next steps:
Document the rapid response protocol for when fatal crashes
occur.
Develop a method to evaluate the safety effects of projects.
Implement projects on Inner Mt. Auburn, Main St (eastbound),
and Ames St (Main to Memorial Drive) in FY20.

Continue to hold driver education trainings for City employees.
Explore opportunities for regional collaboration to improve the
predictability of pavement marking contractor schedules.
Continue to work with MA Vision Zero Coalition to implement
bike / bus driver trainings.

Reducing Speeds
The City of Cambridge has gone above and beyond their Action Plan goals related to speed
management by taking steps to reduce the speed limit to 20 mph on a much larger
number of streets than originally planned. In addition, the Cambridge City Council has
shown leadership by explicitly supporting and advocating for an automated enforcement
bill that would allow cities and towns to opt into speed and red light cameras (S.1376).

Achievements:
Reducing the default speed limit from 30 to 25 mph, and creating 20 mph Safety Zones in
Cambridge’s five major squares.
Committing to implement a speed limit of 20 mph on primarily local-access streets.
City Council expressing support for S.1376, An Act Relative to Automated Enforcement.

Challenges:
While there is convincing evidence that
lowering the posted speed limit without other
interventions can reduce speeding, it is best
practice to also implement design changes in
order to reduce speeds. However, design
changes require significant time, space,
funding, and community support to execute,
and therefore must be rolled out in a deliberate
manner.

16

Next steps:
Continue to communicate the new default
speed limit changes to the public, and
educate residents on why slower speeds are
safer.
Implement a speed limit of 20 mph on
primarily local-access streets, including a
public outreach and education campaign.
Continue to identify traffic calming
opportunities in all capital projects.

Engaging the Community
The City is making good progress on implementing the impactful education strategies
identified in the Action Plan, and is on track to complete many of these items in the coming
year.

Achievements:
Implementing Safe Routes to School programming at elementary and upper schools.
Distributing copies of the “Street Code” and the “Getting Around Cambridge” magazine.
Hiring a Communications Manager in the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department.
Making sustainable transportation the focus of the 2017-2018 Glocal Challenge, engaging 133
high school students in twelve weeks of programming about transportation and how to make
it more sustainable and equitable, locally and globally.

Challenges:
Cambridge is a city with significant
regional traffic, including workers
commuting to jobs, an ever-changing
student population, and tourists.
Communicating with people on
Cambridge's streets requires
engagement strategies that reach both
residents and people who are traveling
through the City or spending even
short periods of time on its streets.

Next steps:
Ensure all Vision Zero outreach and communications
efforts reach underserved and vulnerable residents,
including people with disabilities.
Continue building partnerships with employers and
institutions to reach non-resident populations.
Continue building relationships with rideshare
companies, including Uber and Lyft, to facilitate driver
education and training.
Continue working to educate people to prevent
stopping and parking in bike lanes, crosswalks, and
pedestrian ramps.

Strategic Enforcement
While enforcement has a role to play in traffic safety efforts, it should not be a primary
strategy and should be approached thoughtfully. The City of Cambridge Police Department
(CPD) has long been committed to the idea of equitable enforcement and has engaged in
community policing strategies for over 10 years. Before the adoption of Vision Zero, the City
hired a Traffic Analyst in the Police Department who focuses on doing high-level analyses to
understand trends related to traffic crashes. More recently, the City established the Office of
Procedural Justice in the Police Department to focus on proactively monitoring data related
to police-citizen interactions for indications of possible racial profiling. CPD is one of the
many departments in Cambridge that has embraced Vision Zero. CPD's approach to traffic
enforcement for Vision Zero projects acknowledges the role that enforcement can play in
changing behaviors, while also respecting the fact that people need time to learn about
new infrastructure.

Achievements:
Employing strategic enforcement after the installation of Vision
Zero projects, including South Mass Ave.
CPD developing a guide to direct enforcement with an emphasis
on reduction of harm. The analysis focuses on past crashes
resulting in EMS transport, broken down by patrol sector and
shift. The document highlights causes of crashes within hotspot
areas, and provides guidance for what type of enforcement
officers should conduct to prevent similar crashes.

Challenges:
Identifying the causes of crashes is difficult on the large scale, which limits how strategic CPD's
enforcement can be. The relevant information from police reports is typically embedded in a
narrative, rather than in data fields. CPD can read the narratives of the relatively small number of
reports that occur within notable crash hotspots. However, understanding broad trends in causes
across all of the crash data is difficult because of the large number of crashes and the lack of
detailed information about causality. It is therefore difficult to identify what enforcement actions
would prevent the types of crashes that have historically caused injuries in Cambridge.

Next steps:
Focus enforcement on the most dangerous behaviors based
on reliable data.

Crash History
The data presented below shows crashes on streets owned by the City of Cambridge for the last 10
years, categorized by the most vulnerable user* involved in the crash and the number of Emergency
Medical Services (EMS) transports. 2018 marked the lowest number of total crashes, and the lowest
number of motor-vehicle-only crashes, bike crashes, and EMS transports. The data shows that
motor-vehicle-only crashes have been on a consistent decline in recent years, after a peak in 2015.
Crashes involving people walking or biking do not show clear trends in either direction.

Missing Data
Cambridge has long been committed to using data to drive policies and decision-making processes.
The data challenges faced by Cambridge are not unique, but still limit the City’s ability to access key
information needed to measure progress.
Police reports contain information about the mode of travel of the people involved in crashes, but
EMS reports do not. Police reports do have a field for the officer to indicate EMS transports, but a
significant number of reports are missing this information. In 2015, at least 50% of EMS transports
were missing from the Police reports. The Cambridge Police Department has made major efforts to
improve the accuracy of reports, and as of 2018 the reports included 80% of EMS transports.

Fatalities Per Year By Mode

Photo: Nicolaus Czarnecki

In the last 10 years, there have been zero
people killed in a crash while traveling in a
motor vehicle. Four people have been killed
in crashes while biking, and nine people
have been killed in crashes while walking.
Cambridge has a low number of fatalities,
so there aren’t clear trends, but the data
does clearly indicate that people are most
vulnerable when walking or biking. The City
acknowledges that even one crash that
results in fatal or serious injuries is too
many, and has shown a strong
commitment to continuing to work towards
the goal of zero.
