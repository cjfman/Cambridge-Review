• a single story sunroom addition to the north side of the house with the
dimension of 19.0’ x 19.0’
• a 13.5’ x 15.0’ shed dormer on the third story

• The single-story first-floor gable-style sunroom addition will
connect to the rear side. 2 James Way is a corner unit, and the
back and sides of the house are shielded from public view by
fences. The current fences will not be altered.
• The third floor shed dormer will also be added to the rear side of
the townhouse. The 3rd floor shed dormer will not have any
windows directly facing any neighbors’ houses.
• The proposed set back values and other dimensions meet the
zoning ordinances. The proposed change in the permeable space
for this project is within the zoning requirements.
• The number of parking spaces will not be altered by this project.
• No trees will needed to be cut down to complete this project.
