Special Permit PB #353, Bhari Inc. Cannabis Retail Store at 45-51 New
Street – Continued Hearing

Update
Since the last Planning Board meeting in December 2019, the Applicant has discussed
with staff the comments and questions raised in the initial review of the application. The
Applicant’s recent submission provides revisions and additional information regarding
the project. This memo comments on these updates.

Planning Board Action
Bhari, Inc. is proposing to repurpose a portion of the existing building that is mostly
located on the parcel at 47 New Street and a small southern portion located on the
parcel at 43 New Street to operate a cannabis retail store. The proposal includes
renovation of 3,167 square feet of the existing building to include sales space, storage,
and an office for the cannabis retail store. The proposed use will include 4 existing offstreet parking spaces and will add 7 long-term bicycle parking spaces and 12 short term
bicycle parking spaces.
The project is located in the Industry A-1 (IA-1) District and requires a Special Permit to
allow a cannabis retail store per Section 11.800. Applicable sections of the zoning are
provided in an appendix.
Per the current zoning requirements, cannabis retail stores may include sales of
cannabis products for medical and/or adult use. The current proposal is for an adult use,
non-medical establishment.

TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

The project is also subject to the City’s Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance that
contains requirements separate from the Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance
requires that special permits be conditioned on compliance with all applicable state and
local regulations and does not allow a building permit or certificate of occupancy to be
issued for a Cannabis Use that is not properly licensed and/or registered with the
applicable state and local agencies. Because the proposed establishment is not operated
by a state-certified Economic Empowerment Applicant, it would not be eligible to
receive a Cannabis Business Permit until two years after the enactment of the Cannabis
Business Permitting Ordinance under the current provisions of that ordinance.

Required Planning Board Findings (Summary)
(see Criteria for zoning text excerpts)

Cannabis Retail Store (Sections
11.800)

Complies with Zoning Requirements:
• Located in a BA, BA-2, BA-3, BB, BB-1, BB-2, BC, IA-1, IB, IB-1, or
IB-2 district, or a BA-1 district only if it is designated by the
Cannabis Control Commission as an Economic Empowerment
Applicant or as qualifying for its Social Equity Program.
• Located in a permanent building.
• Not within 1,800 feet of another Cannabis Retail Store, unless it
is designated by the Cannabis Control Commission as an
Economic Empowerment Applicant or as qualifying for its Social
Equity Program.
• Not within 300 feet of an existing public or private K-12 school
or within 300 feet of a public children’s playground, public
youth athletic field, or public youth recreation facility,
otherwise the Planning Board finds that it is sufficiently
buffered such that users of such facilities will not be adversely
impacted by its operation.
• No packaging or re-packaging of cannabis products will occur
on-site.
Meets Special Permit Criteria:
• Site design provides convenient, safe and secure access and
egress for clients and employees arriving to and leaving from
the site using all modes of transportation, including drivers,
pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation users.
• Location and design of cannabis use will not detract from the
sense of activity with opaque, unwelcoming façade at ground
floor in retail areas.
• Loading, refuse and service areas are designed to be secure and
shielded from abutting uses.
• Building and site are designed to be compatible with other
buildings in the area and to mitigate any negative aesthetic
impacts that might result from required security measures and
restrictions on visibility into the building’s interior.
• The facility will provide programs to assist qualifying patients in
obtaining services under Massachusetts Medical Use of
Marijuana Program.

General Special Permit Criteria
(Section 10.43)

September 8, 2021

Special permits will be normally granted if the zoning requirements
are met, unless it is found not to be in the public interest due to
one of the criteria enumerated in Section 10.43:

Special Permit PB #353, 45-51 New Street – Memo to Planning Board
Required Planning Board Findings (Summary)
(see Criteria for zoning text excerpts)
(a) It appears that requirements of this Ordinance cannot or will
not be met, or
(b) traffic generated or patterns of access or egress would cause
congestion, hazard, or substantial change in established
neighborhood character, or
(c) the continued operation of or the development of adjacent
uses as permitted in the Zoning Ordinance would be adversely
affected by the nature of the proposed use, or
(d) nuisance or hazard would be created to the detriment of the
health, safety and/or welfare of the occupant of the proposed
use or the citizens of the City, or
(e) for other reasons, the proposed use would impair the integrity
of the district or adjoining district, or otherwise derogate from
the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and
(f) the new use or building construction is inconsistent with the
Urban Design Objectives set forth in Section 19.30.

Planning Board Comments from First Hearing
The following summarizes some of the key comments made by the Planning Board at the December 10,
2019 hearing. The Applicant has provided responses in the submitted materials.
•
•
•
•
•

Review and respond to comments regarding loading and parking issues.
Confirm whether a small Parking and Transportation Demand Management (PTDM) Plan is
required for this use.
Improve screening of trash collection area.
Consider increasing the queuing capacity.
Update the plan set to show details of the site, ADA accessibility, queuing, and bicycle parking.

Staff Comments on Revised Materials
In response to the Board’s comments, the Applicant has provided clarifications and additional
information.
Operational Details:
The revisions propose all access at the front of the property, clarifying a prior question about whether
the area behind the building would be used for parking, loading, or other activities. The proposal also no
longer anticipates using the parking lot across the street for customer parking. Because the only parking
spaces proposed will be the four spaces in front of the building, the City’s PTDM officer has determined
that a PTDM plan is not needed for this use as proposed.

Requested Special Permits

Special Permit PB #353, 45-51 New Street – Memo to Planning Board
The revised floor plans have increased the interior queuing capacity of the business by decreasing the
retail sales area. The business hours have also changed to 2 pm - 10pm all days of the week in the
revised materials.
The revised narrative explains that home deliveries are anticipated to occupy a growing share of the
cannabis retail market, but it is unclear if the business is considering home deliveries from this location.
The Transportation Logistics Plan does not provide any information about anticipated home delivery
activities. Cannabis Courier Establishments, which are licensed to deliver products from Cannabis Retail
Stores to customers’ homes, are currently permitted by zoning. The Planning Board should specify in the
special permit conditions whether home deliveries would be permitted from this location.

New Street’s two new large residential buildings, and a third one that is currently in design, will further
the street’s transformation from a backstreet serving mostly light industrial buildings to a residential
street with a considerable population. The City’s urban planning efforts support this change in character:
The Envision Cambridge comprehensive plan recommends that the form, use, and design of projects
should help create an active public realm. The Alewife Planning Study stresses the role of architectural
and landscape design in creating a pedestrian friendly environment, reinforcing the importance of the
project’s aesthetic contributions to its neighborhood.
Site Plan - Consideration could be given to unifying the forecourt and making it a more pedestrianfriendly space by:
• Increasing the amount of planting.
• Changing the proposed Arbor Vitae trees to canopy trees and planting additional trees in the
forecourt, both to reduce the urban heat island effect and to create a more visually welcoming
and gracious pedestrian experience.
• Screening the existing fence on the neighboring property to the south, either by adding a new
and more visually appealing fence alongside of it, or by providing additional vegetative
screening – ivy or low plantings – for the length of its north side.
• Increasing the amount of pedestrian paving and reducing the amount of asphalt paving, for
instance by using pedestrian pavers for the entire area south the Hi-Tech Autobody building and
the trash enclosure and extending them out to the New Street sidewalk.
• Increasing the amount of permeable paving.
• Reducing the potential for glare and light pollution by replacing the proposed wall-mounted
floodlight on the south wall of the Hi-Tech Autobody building with more subdued lighting,
mounted at a lower height and with more shielding.
Building Façade - Consideration could be given to:
• Retaining the existing large opening, currently a garage door, and reglazing it as a large window
into the Waiting Area.
• Painting the south façade of the adjoining existing Hi-Tech Autobody building to match the
proposed entry façade to the dispensary, to emphasize the courtyard as a significant space.

Special Permit PB #353, 45-51 New Street – Memo to Planning Board
Suggested Conditions / Continuing Review
The Board should specify in its decision whether or not home deliveries from this site will be permitted,
given that state regulations now authorize home delivery.
The following are additional recommendations for ongoing design review by staff if the Board decides to
grant the special permit:

•

•
•
•
•

Development of the project’s landscape design, including selection and location of plant species and
the configuration and specifications for pedestrian paving material.
Design of the new wood slat fence trash enclosure.
Design of the façade, exterior materials, colors, façade alterations, and details.
Design of site lighting, relative to Cambridge’s Draft Outdoor Lighting Ordinance.
Review of exterior signage, lighting, and other security features that may be required by state
regulations.
Note that the applicant states that no rooftop mechanical equipment will be installed. If for an
unforeseen reason any is needed, review of its location and its visual and acoustical screening.

In addition, if the Board decides to grant the special permit, it should be conditioned on the following
requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance:
•

•

Pursuant to Section 11.802.2, the Permittee shall maintain all required state and local licenses
and/or registrations and comply with all applicable state and local public health regulations and all
other applicable laws, rules and regulations at all times. In particular, the Permittee shall execute a
Host Community Agreement with the City of Cambridge pursuant to the regulations of the
Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission and shall have received a Cannabis Business Permit
pursuant to the Cambridge Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.
Pursuant to Section 11.802.3, the special permit shall be valid only for the original Applicant and
shall expire on the date the Permittee either ceases operation of a Cannabis Retail Store, or the
Permittee’s License or Certificate of Registration expires or is terminated by the CCC. Any change in
the ownership of the Cannabis Retail Store from the original application, including without limitation
a takeover, merger, sale of assets and equity, or sale to another entity resulting in a majority of the
individuals initially disclosed under 935 CMR 500.002 as Controlling Persons failing to maintain a
controlling equity interest, shall be reported to the Commissioner of Inspectional Services
Department for purposes of determining whether the change in ownership requires a new special
permit or modification of the existing permit for the succeeding owner of the Cannabis Retail Store.

MEMORANDUM
To:

Cambridge Planning Board

From:

Joseph E. Barr, Director

Date:

September 10, 2021

The Cambridge Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department (TP+T) has reviewed
the revised Planning Board Special Permit Application from Bhari Inc. to operate a 3,167
square feet Cannabis Retail Store at 45-51 New Street. TP+T offers the Planning Board
the following comments for your consideration.
•

TP+T previously submitted a memo to the Planning Board related to this Project
(dated September 19, 2019) with various comments. A key outstanding concern is
the limited number of parking spaces (4 off-street spaces) to serve customers, given
that there are no on-street parking spaces on New Street and a limited number of
spaces on Bay State Road. To address this issue, the Applicant has indicated it will
extend an appointment only model from six months to twelve months after opening.
TP+T remains concerned about the parking supply for customers and employees,
as well as what will change substantively once the appointment only service model
ends after twelve months. At the same time, TP+T also acknowledges that the
number of customer parking spaces is a business decision for the Applicant, and
that the limited number of parking spaces may discourage people from driving to the
site and encourage customers to travel by non-automobile modes (although an onsite loading space may be needed for ride-hailing services such as Ubers or Lyft, to
prevent them from stopping in the bicycle lane on New Street).

•

Although the site plan shows 4 parking spaces for the Project (1 employee space, 2
customer spaces, 1 disability space), it is very likely that cars will try to park in front
of the trash enclosure and in other space in front of the site, such as in the proposed
pedestrian walkway or in the New Asphalt Pavement Space to the left of the disability
space. Given the likely demand for more than 4 parking spaces for this site, more
design consideration may be needed to clarify and control where cars can legally
park. It is also important that the Applicant strongly discourage any customer or
employee use of the Danehy Park parking lot located at the north end of New Street.

•

TP+T is also concerned that the Project site plan proposes to use head in parking
spaces off New Street and maintain the excessively long curb cut. Although this
condition exists today it is not a desirable condition for the site. We do not have a
suggested solution for this condition (nor has the Applicant suggested one) but want
to make sure that Planning Board is aware that approving this Project and site plan
will also lead to a continuation of that sub-optimal condition.

Subject: Proposed Cannabis Retail Store at 45-51 New Street, Bhari Inc. (PB353)

The Project proposes 12 short-term bicycle parking spaces on its site, which is
positive. The Applicant should verify that the bike spaces meet the zoning
dimensions because the site plan (Sheet A-022) appears to show 6’ long bike spaces
instead of 8’ long bike spaces.

•

Although it is not required, the Applicant may want to consider providing a bike
shelter for the short-term bike spaces to provide some weather protection.

•

The Project proposes an interior employee bike room for 7 bicycles and a bike repair
station and lockers, which are all very positive.

•

As stated in TP+T’s September 19, 2019 memo to the Planning Board, if the Project
is approved by the Planning Board, TP+T recommends the following Transportation
Demand Management (TDM) measures which are routinely recommended by TP+T
as conditions for special permit approval and are consistent with approved Retail
Cannabis Stores in Cambridge.

1. Provide 100% MBTA T-Pass subsidies to all employees. (may be pro-rated for parttime employees) The program shall be administered by the employer through the
MBTA Corporate Pass/Perq Program.
2. Offer all employees Gold-Level Bluebikes bikeshare membership, to be
administered through the Bluebikes Corporate Program by the employer.
3. Provide lockers for employees that walk or bike to work.
4. Have available an air pump and bicycle repair tools for employee and customers to
use when needed.
5. Designate an employee of the facility as a Transportation Coordinator (TC) to
manage the implementation of TDM measures and a transportation monitoring
program if required. The TC will:
a. Post in a central and visible location (i.e., lobby for customers, break room for
employees) information on available non-automobile services in the area,
including, but not limited to:
i. Available pedestrian and bicycle facilities near the Project site.
ii. MBTA maps, schedules and fares.
iii. “Getting Around Cambridge” map (available at the Cambridge
Community Development office).
iv. Locations of bicycle parking.
v. Bluebikes regional public bikeshare system.
vi. Carpool-matching programs.
vii. Other pertinent transportation information.
➢ Instead or in addition to posting paper MBTA schedules, provide a
real-time transportation display screen in a central location to help
people decide which mode to choose for each trip.
b. Compile and provide up-to-date transportation information explaining all
commuter options to all employees. This information should also be distributed
to all new employees as part of their orientation. Transportation information
packets may be obtained from the Community Development Department.
c. Provide customers with sustainable transportation information to access the site.
d. Provide and maintain information on the Project’s public website, newsletters,
social media, etc. on how to access the site by all modes, with emphasis on

•

•

Provide a one-time contribution to the City toward transportation, parking, transit
and/or bicycle improvements to support non-automobile travel modes for employees
and customers and to mitigate the Project’s traffic and parking impacts on the
surrounding area. As a non-economic empowerment Applicant, TP+T recommends
the Applicant contribute $70,000 to the City prior to the issuance of a Building Permit
to help improve transportation services, operations, and information in the immediate
area. However, if the Applicant provides confirmation as a Group A priority applicant
for a minority owned business, the one-time contribution can be $35,000 instead of
$70,000 with half of the payment due prior to the issuance of a Building Permit and
the remainder due prior to issuance of an Occupancy Permit.

sustainable modes with emphasis on sustainable modes (i.e., walking, bicycling,
taking public transportation).
e. Participate in any TC training offered by the City or local Transportation
Management Association.
f. If requested by TP+T or the Community Development Department (CDD), the
Applicant should provide TP+T and CDD information on employee and customer
travel modes and where they customarily park, as well as information on loading
and delivery operations. Surveys of employees and customer shall be designed
and conducted in a manner approved by TP+T and CDD.
g. Prior to the issuance of a Building Permit, the Applicant should provide a loading
and service delivery management plan that includes all delivery activity to TP+T
for TP+T’s approval. No offsite deliveries should be made from this location to
customers.
h. Prior to issuance of a Building permit, the Applicant should provide an Operations
plan and Opening Day Plan which should be approved by TP+T. The plan should
address in detail how the Applicant is intending to manage employee and
customer parking and drop-off/pick-up activities, prevent parking or stopping at
any time on a public right-of-way, prevent sidewalk crowding, and maintain safety
and access to adjacent buildings, transit and other key uses.
i. Prior to issuance of an Occupancy Permit, the Applicant should have a final
approved Operations and Opening Day Plan by TP+T and the Cambridge Police
Department.
