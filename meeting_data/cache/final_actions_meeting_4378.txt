Data Source

Longitudinal EmployerHousehold Dynamics
(LEHD) employment data

Table 1. Study Data Sources
Rationale
Description of Source and Potential Relationship to
Potential
Study
for Use in
Study?
US Census database of employers and employees,
including earnings and demographics. LEHD data could
be used to track changes in employment and businesses
near newly installed bike facilities, relative to a control
group. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics
dataset with workplace area characteristics can be used
to analyze employment by census block.

Yes

Due to data privacy, obtaining access to LEHD at a level with more
granularity than the census block level would involve long lead times.
Data at the census block level does not allow the level of detail
necessary to identify businesses facing a particular roadway
improvement. However, census blocks could be assigned to a corridor
based on a radius from the roadway. Data at the annual level is more
aggregated than would be preferred and does not allow for precise
measurement of changes in employment relative to the completion
date of a project.
Employment levels tend to be a lagging and indirect indicator of
changes in retail activity but may be used to validate control areas
where sufficient data are available. These data are available in 2011
through 2020, so sufficient data is not available for more recent
installations.
This data may be useful in identifying existing trends in employment
overall and by industry in the City of Cambridge relative to the
surrounding area and in identifying existing trends in employment for
census blocks near specific bike corridors compared to a control area.

Pedestrian and Bike
Counts, Parking
information

City-collected counts of pedestrian and bike traffic at
multiple locations, including before-and-after studies at
bike facilities.

Limited use

These data do not provide direct evidence on changes in business
sales but allow other information to be viewed in context.

Limited use

Business openings and closings are affected by many factors and can
be difficult to associate with changes in bike facilities or other
projects. However, the data may be useful in providing context for
other findings.

Parking availability information or studies, as available.

Data Source

Description of Source and Potential Relationship to
Study

Potential
for Use in
Study?

Rationale

Sidewalk and in-person
customer intercept
surveys

City-collected survey data from shopper intercepts at
bike project locations and controls. These data provide
information on mode of travel and purpose of trip.

Limited use

These data do not provide direct evidence on changes in business
sales but allow other information to be viewed in context.

Business surveys

City-collected data from surveys of business owners in
affected locations versus control groups. This will
provide information on changes in retail activity relative
to a pre-covid baseline.

Yes

Because the survey is voluntary and the projects are public in nature,
there are several sources of potential bias including nonresponse bias.

Private sector providers such as CoStar estimate rental
rates and vacancy rates for commercial properties. Data
on properties near bike projects can be compared to a
control group.

Yes

Commercial real estate
lease rate and/or
occupancy/vacancy data

In addition, many macro- and micro-economic factors other than bike
projects can affect sales volumes. Nonetheless, the survey data, as a
supplement to other data sources, will a provide direct source of
information on changes in the business environment in addition to
information regarding perceived impacts.

Because the value of urban real estate hinges on the commercial
desirability of its location, changes in rents can provide a useful
indirect measure of changes in retail activity and overall accessibility.
Occupancy/ vacancy data also provide a secondary measure.
These datasets are credible as they are used widely in the real estate
industry, and they permit geographic analysis. Although property
values are also available through the city assessor, these involve
longer time lags, and the assessment methodology may not account
for smaller changes in neighborhood access.
Use of data is dependent on availability for identified corridors, and
some data review and cleaning will be necessary to permit analysis.

Data Source

Description of Source and Potential Relationship to
Study

Potential
for Use in
Study?

Rationale

Point of interest (POI)
transaction data

Information from electronic transactions can be
purchased from a POI data company such as SafeGraph.

Yes

POI transaction data provides anonymized credit and debit card
transaction information which can be used to track local sales trends
directly. Use of this data would require a purchase of the dataset. Key
limitations are the exclusion of non-credit card transactions, and the
lack of transparency regarding potential gaps in the data. The earliest
available data is from 2019, so it is likely that this data could only be
used to assess trends in beginning in the latter half of 2019 or later.
Based on initial discussion with SafeGraph, the data contains primarily
full-service restaurants, snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars,
limited-service restaurants, hair/nail/skin care services, and fitness
centers. The dataset includes both chain and independent businesses
at the store level by month. Potential variables of interest could be
total sales amount, spend per customer, number of transactions, or
number of customers. Some data review and cleaning will be
necessary to permit analysis.

Bike lane information

Data Source

Geographic and time information regarding bike lane
installation

Yes

Assessing bike lane impacts requires location and timing information
for impacted corridors.

Study
for Use in

Payment processor
transaction data

Information from credit card and other electronic
transactions could be purchased from a financial
institution and used to track changes in retail sales
directly.

No

Unable to find a private sector partner willing to provide such data.
There would also be key limitations, such as not providing
information on cash or out-of-network transactions.

City of Cambridge localoption meals tax

These data can be used to shed light on changes in
restaurant sales, but not on other retail sectors.

No

Lack of information on other retail sectors makes the use of this
dataset as a primary source of information insufficient. In addition,
data are only available at aggregate level from the State.

Data Source

Description of Source and Potential Relationship to
Study

Potential
for Use in
Study?

Rationale

Massachusetts
Department of Revenue
meals and sales tax data

Sales and meals tax receipts are based on retailers’ own
tax documentation, can be analyzed geographically, and
provide direct evidence of changes in retail activity.
Most retail activity is covered (except for groceries and
clothing).

No

The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is unable to release the
data at a granular level due to taxpayer privacy considerations. It
may be possible to review information from businesses that “opt in”
to provide tax data. However, options for this “opt in” process
appear to be too broad.

Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages
employment and wage
data

Data from reports filed by employers subject to
unemployment compensation laws, produced publicly
at the city/town and county level by NAICS industries.

No

The level of detail for publicly available data is too aggregated to be
useful. Massachusetts is a non-signatory state, indicating that
projects are approved based on individual state laws. Obtaining
data at the establishment level would involve approvals and long
lead times.

National Establishment
Time Series employment
and sales data

This product was established as a potential source via
literature review of past studies.

No

Unable to find a current source for this data product.

Prior Studies: Overview
• There are a limited number of published studies that address the
impacts of bike infrastructure on retail sales in North America
• Generally, these compare the “treatment” area against one or more
control areas and citywide trends, plus a before-vs.-after comparison
• Data sources vary by location due to data availability
• Overall, the studies generally show small changes that range from
neutral to slightly positive
• Variations by city, location, and business type (e.g., dining vs. general retail)
• The small size of the impacts can be difficult to separate from broader
economic trends

Prior Studies: Details
• NYC DOT: The Economic Benefits of Sustainable Streets

• Based primarily on city tax filings, plus commercial lease data and city tax
assessments

• City of Toronto: Bloor Street West Bike Lane Pilot Project Evaluation

• Based on transaction data from a point-of-sale terminal provider and surveys
of businesses and pedestrians

• Portland State University: Understanding Economic and Business
Impacts of Street Improvements for Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility

• 14 corridors across 6 cities (Indianapolis, Memphis, Minneapolis, SF, Seattle &
Portland)
• Primary data sources were employment/wage databases including Census

Tax Data

• Tax data are ideal sources due to universal, standardized reporting of
retail/service sales
• Unlike NYC, Cambridge has no truly local sales/retail taxes – even the
local option meals tax is administered by the state
• After multiple City staff attempts, Massachusetts Department of
Revenue (DOR) reaffirmed their policy does not allow the release
granular data or individual data due to taxpayer privacy and other
record requirements.

Point of Sale Transaction Data
• Point of sale (cash register) transaction data would provide direct
insight into changes in retail sales
• This approach was used in a prior study in Toronto
• However, the US market is split across multiple providers and the study
team was not able to find a willing data provider
• Even if an agreement with a POS service provider could be reached,
such data would not cover all businesses or cash transactions

a

POI / Mobile Data
• Point of Interest (POI) data is based on location-based mobile phone
services
• This allows for estimates of the number of customers at a given retail
business
• SafeGraph uses a proprietary model to pair this data with transaction
data to generate estimates of spending by location over time
• The study team has access to SafeGraph data for 2019-present
covering Cambridge and is reviewing the dataset to assess its
suitability for analysis

Real Estate Data
• The value of urban real estate reflects its location and accessibility
• Commercial real estate data such as rent levels and occupancy provide
an indirect measure of neighborhood retail health and were used in a
prior NYC study
• This will be analyzed using a commercial subscription database, CoStar
• CoStar data cover almost all commercial properties in the city, with
quarterly updates, but not all variables are available for all properties

Employment Data
• Government products such as Longitudinal Employer-Household
Dynamics (LEHD) provide information on employment and wages
• These are indirect and lagging indicators of retail activity have been
used in some prior studies
• Publicly available LEHD data go to the Census block level, which is
generally adequate for identifying project-specific impacts
• LEHD dataset currently ends in 2020, so this is only useful for
projects/corridors that were complete by that time

Transportation Data
• City-provided data on transportation system can provide valuable
context, even though they do not directly cover retail sales
• Counts of vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles
• Parking spaces gained/lost
• Parking utilization studies (limited, but using for corridors when available)

Business Survey
Survey data provides one source of data on changes in business sales, along with qualitative insights and information
that would be difficult to collect through other means (e.g., additional business costs incurred)
• Various response biases exist, but survey is structured to mitigate those through effective practices such as
pre-notification, follow-up on nonresponse, and benchmarking of responses
• Business Survey was sent out to a little over 1600 retail, restaurant, medical, financial and other service
businesses in commercial and neighborhood corridors of Cambridge the first week of July. As of 7/18/23, 61
businesses have responded to the survey.
• Question topics include:
• Changes to sales/revenue since street changes have occurred, with a 2019 base year (pre-COVID)
• Whether a bicycle facility was installed nearby and whether there were changes to on-street metered parking
and loading zones
• Perceived business impacts of these changes
• Any business expenses incurred due to these changes
• Option to provide additional written comments and financial data

Customer Surveys
• This Summer and Fall, CDD will conduct a short customer survey in corridors that
have either had separated bike installations or will soon be receiving them, covering
mode of travel, purpose of trip, and related topics
• The study team has reviewed data from CDD’s Customer Intercept Surveys from
2009-2022, which include a question about mode of transportation and reason for
being in the district.

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR TONER
COUNCILLOR CARLONE
WHEREAS:

The roll out and implementation of separated bike lanes has caused a lot of concern
among the small business community who have felt left out of the process; and

WHEREAS:

Business owners have fears about the impact on their businesses, and it would be
beneficial for both the City and the business community to have local economic
information about the potential impacts, positive and negative, on various types of
businesses; and

WHEREAS:

Economic studies are often cited from other cities about the impact of bike lanes to
small businesses, and how they will improve sales; and

WHEREAS:

The City will be implementing bike lanes along business corridors each year until 2026
per the recent ordinance change, this provides an opportunity to collect relevant data
and real time experience; and

WHEREAS:

Having local information will help shape future conversations and implementations of
separated bike lanes and can help inform needed mitigation strategies along
commercial corridors; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Economic
Development division and other appropriate departments with the intention of
conducting a study to collect relevant economic data relating to business impacts from
bike lane installations, positive or negative, which will help inform future installations
of bike lanes along commercial corridors; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with appropriate
departments on what the standard public process will be prior to implementing new
sections of bike lanes consistent with the Cycling Safety Ordinance, and what general
evaluation process will take place post-installation now and for a full year once the
bike network is completed, and to report back to the City Council on these matters; and
be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
these matters by March 31, 2022.

WHEREAS:

The city is conducting a business impact study related to the installation of separated
bicycle lanes, which began in 2004 with the installation of the city’s first separated
bike lane, and accelerated in 2016 with the introduction of quickbuild separated bicycle
lanes; and

WHEREAS:

It is crucial to ensure that the study utilizes accurate, objective, and reliable data from
before and after installation to assess the positive or negative economic impacts on
businesses from separated bicycle lane installations; and

WHEREAS:

The goal is to improve the implementation of separated bicycle lane projects so that
positive impacts on local businesses are enhanced and negative impacts are avoided or
mitigated; now therefore be it

Packet Pg. 28

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consider the following measures
to enhance the aforementioned business impact study:
1. Prioritize the utilization of objective data sources on economic impact over
subjective or survey-based data sources: (a) Partner with the state revenue
agency to conduct sales tax data analysis, avoiding privacy issues; (b) Obtain
transaction or business utilization data from third-party vendors; (c) Examine
the long-term impacts on vacancy rates and rent prices on earlier bike lane
projects, including Cambridge St, Brattle St, Western Ave, and earlier
segments of Mass Ave, avoiding potential distortions caused by the pandemic;
2. To the extent that subjective or survey-based data sources are used, work to
minimize statistical bias (anchoring bias, reporting bias, etc.): (a) Consult with
a working group of experts, such as quantitative social scientists and policy
evaluation researchers from local academic institutions, to ensure the
utilization of best practices; (b) Measure customer perceptions and preferences
for the retail environment through customer intercept surveys; (c) Consult with
business staff to understand and assess their priorities, preferences, and
concerns, in addition to consultations with business owners;
3. In addition to measuring impacts, aggregate ideas for how to improve the
implementation of separated bicycle lanes along commercial corridors to
enhance the business environment: (a) If surveys are conducted, solicit broader
feedback regarding ways to improve the implementation and operation of bike
lane projects, potential mitigations for regions with newly implemented bike
lanes, and curb-use management strategies, including loading, short-term/longterm parking, and outdoor dining; (b) Estimate the potential impacts of
changes to parking policies and dynamic meter pricing to ensure sufficient
parking availability;
and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
these matters by September 1, 2023, outlining the proposed improvements to the
business impact study for separated bicycle lanes, including the incorporation of
objective data sources, collaboration with external partners, and strategies for gathering
feedback and ideas from businesses.
