POLICE REVIEW & ADVISORY BOARD
A Department of the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts

MEMO
To:
Yi-An Huang, City Manager
From: Brian Corr, Executive Director, Police Review & Advisory Board
Date: February 2, 2023
Re:
Police Review & Advisory Board Quarterly Report for January 2023
Pursuant to Cambridge Municipal Code Chapter 2.74.040(E), the Police Review & Advisory
Board “shall make quarterly reports to the City Manager, the Mayor, the City Council and to
the public, of the Department’s activities during the previous year, including the handling of
complaints, and of future plans.” In fulfillment of that requirement, I am submitting this
memo as well as the complete set of minutes from the calendar year 2022 and the public
docket of complaints.
When a complainant files a complaint with the Board, the Board notifies the complainant
that the Board received the complaint and explains the process of investigation and the
Board’s determination. Once a complaint is filed, the Executive Director sends the complaint
to the Professional Standards Unit (PSU) of the Cambridge Police Department for
investigation on behalf of the Board. An investigation includes interviewing the complainant,
involved police officer(s), and any other relevant individuals and reviewing police reports,
witness statements, and other pertinent information. The Executive Director submits the
investigative report from PSU to the Board, which reviews the report and may accept the
report or order additional investigation into the complaint. After the investigation process is
complete, the Board deliberates and makes a determination whether or not there was a
violation of policy or procedures, or whether it is inconclusive. That finding is provided to the
complainant and the PSU.
Depending on the finding, any party to the complaint may request that the Board order a
hearing. The Board decides whether to order a hearing based on the evidence it receives. If
the Board holds a hearing, it will render a final decision. In addition, even if the Board finds
no violation of policy or procedures, it may make recommendations to the City Manager and
the Police Commissioner about changes the City can make to avoid similar situations in the
future.
In the calendar year 2022, the Board held eight public meetings, including five executive
sessions under Section 21(a)(1) of the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law to consider
complaints pending before the Board. During the executive sessions, the Board reviewed both
the complaints and the investigations of those complaints conducted on its behalf by the PSU,
and then made findings on the complaints. The Board also reviewed in executive session the
one complaint received by CPD and the subsequent investigation of the complaint by PSU.
In 2022, three complaints were filed with the Board. They are summarized as follows:

A significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Board has been the difficulty of
providing training for the Board and the inability of Board members to conduct outreach to
the community through community meetings and public events. The Board received training
from CPD on the PSU policy and procedure for conducting complaint investigations, and
Board members attended training webinars provided by the National Association for Civilian
Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE).
For 2023, Board Chair Alexandra Fallon has proposed the following goals, which were
reviewed with the full Board at its December 2022 meeting:
•

Board members and staff to participate in two CPD trainings - including “Integrating
Communications, Assessment, and Tactics” (ICAT), a training on responding to
situations where individuals that the police encounter are behaving erratically and
perhaps dangerously but do not have a firearm.

•

CPD Commissioner Elow to attend two Board meetings to discuss key topics with the
Board.

•

Improve access to filing complaints by launching an online complaint form.

•

Revise the Board’s Rules and Regulations to extend the deadline for complaints to be
filed more than 60 days after the incident.

•

The Board will conduct a review of a minimum of two CPD policies.

•

Board members will participate in a minimum of three community outreach efforts.

•

The Board will have a quorum for all scheduled meetings.

I look forward to providing these reports on a quarterly basis, and by the end of March 2023,
I plan to prepare an annual public report on the work of the Board in 2022.

Executive Director’s Report
• Exec. Dir. Corr reported on a meeting he attended in December of the “City Manager’s

•

•
•

Task Force to Examine the Future of Public Safety in Cambridge.” The City will establish a
new Cambridge Department of Community Safety (CDCS), which will be separate from
the Cambridge Police Department (CPD) and staffed by trained civilians who will provide
community services and programs focused on some of the most vulnerable individuals
and groups in Cambridge. CDCS will implement a trauma-informed “Cambridge
Alternative Public Safety Response Program” to respond to non-violent calls involving
behavioral health, substance use, and homelessness with a harm-reduction approach.
The program will include a crisis response specialist and a peer support specialist who
will be the primary responders to those types of calls received by 911. The foundation of
the program will be that all people deserve respect, autonomy, dignity, and opportunity.
The City Manager plans to propose a budget of approximately $3,000,000 to support the
CDCS.
Exec. Dir. Corr discussed his participation in the interview process for CPD hiring its first
Informatics Analyst for their Procedural Justice Unit. This position is part of
implementing a “Procedural Justice Dashboard” and a strategic research plan that
advances the work of procedural justice and legitimacy-based policing.
The longest-serving member of the Board — Lucy Murray-Brown — will finish her
second five-year term on April 30, 2022, and she is not eligible for reappointment, and
her last meeting as a board member will be on April 27, 2022.
The 2022 NACOLE Annual Conference will take place in Fort Worth, TX from
September 11 to 15, 2022. The location was chosen in part because it is home to one of
the newer civilian oversight offices, the Fort Worth Office of the Police Oversight
Monitor.

Professional Standards Unit Report
Director Mulcahy shared updates from the Cambridge Police Department.
• Director Mulcahy announced that 18 cadets entered the CPD cadet program, which
aims to give young people in Cambridge the opportunity to work with the Police
Department as a possible career path. Director Mulcahy announced that a new Police
Commissioner was appointed by the City Manager. Commissioner Christine Elow has
worked with the Cambridge Police Department for 27 years and believes in connecting
with the most vulnerable people and diverting them away from the criminal justice
system whenever possible.
• Director Mulcahy suggested the Board would benefit from CPD’s Integrated
Communications and Tactics (ICAT) training, developed by the Police Executive
Research Forum based on research and on the principles of 21st Century policing. Chair
Fallon discussed the possibility of setting up a date for the Board to receive training in
ICAT, and all Board members agreed it was a good idea.

Executive Director’s Report
•
•

•

Executive Director Corr discussed setting up a training for the Board prior to the March
Board meeting and stated that he would follow up with the Professional Standards Unit at
CPD to discuss conducting training desired by the Board.
E.D. Corr informed the Board that he had just finished serving on the Law Enforcement
Data Dashboard Advisory Committee for the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), a
progressive policing think tank and the organization that developed the ICAT training that
the CPD is using to promote and support de-escalation.
E.D. Corr reported that he has had continuing opportunities to support other communities
as they develop civilian oversight, including meeting with the Office of the Mayor of
Birmingham, Ala. Birmingham has started a new civilian review board and has been very
interested in what Cambridge does regarding civilian oversight, looking to this agency as a
model. Over the last seventy years, it has become a majority-Black city with serious issues
of poverty and accompanying concerns around public safety, and the administration is
working to rebuild trust between the Birmingham Police Department and the city’s
residents. Notably, its population is 73% Black, its police department is 90% Black, and
Birmingham is well-known for its history of segregation and civil rights activism.

Chair’s Report
Chair Fallon reported that she and E.D. Corr will be meeting with Police Commissioner Elow in
March.

Board Member Report

Board Member LaRoche reported that on behalf of the Police Review & Advisory Board, she
participated in a focus group for City boards and commissions, facilitated by Randi Frank

•

last meeting as a member of the Board because the restrictions in the ordinance
establishing the Police Review & Advisory Board mean that he must resign upon becoming
a City of Cambridge employee.
In response to a question from the Board regarding filling vacancies on the Board under the
revised provisions of the city charter, ED Corr explained that based on the ongoing work of
the City Council’s Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee to develop new
guidelines for appointments to boards and commissions, the City Manager’s Office is not

currently posting vacancies for positions on boards and commissions which are subject to

Executive Director’s Report
•

•

•
•

ED Corr reported that he had an initial meeting with the Law Department to discuss the
Board’s interest in revising the Rules & Regulations of the Board to extend the amount of
time that complaints could be filed and considered timely. He explained that one important
consideration is that there are differences between the role of the CPD’s Professional
Standards Unit (PSU) versus the role of the Board in the personnel and disciplinary process
and the because of the quasi-adjudicatory nature of the Board. He will continue working
with the Law Department on this topic.
Because not all members were present at the May meeting, ED Corr reminded that Board
Member Lepionka has resigned from the Board upon being hired by the City of Cambridge
Law Department, as City employees are not allowed to serve on the Board, according to the
City ordinance that established the Board.
ED Corr reported that Ayan Barre has left her position as administrative coordinator for the
Police Review & Advisory Board to take a new position, and that he will work to secure
administrative support, while noting that will be difficult to accomplish over the summer.
ED Corr updated the Board on the status of filling vacancies for Board and Commissions,
explaining that the City Manager’s Office is working to address the desire of the City
Council that the selection process aligns with their new authority to approve appointments
to Board and Commissions under the newly revised City Charter.

complaints to something like six months, and that she wants us all to be seeing accepting of
complaints and didn't see a huge difference in the. Board members indicated interest in

Dir. Mulcahy reported that on October 4, CPD hosted a delegation of Mexican police officials
organized by the U.S. State Department who were visiting Boston, Cambridge, and New York
City to learn about best practices in internal affairs and investigations, and who had just
attended the same conference that Ex. Dir Corr was at in Mexico City. The delegation met with
Dir. Mulcahy and CPD Superintendent Rob Lowe, had excellent discussions, and they found
the delegation to be very robust.
Dir. Mulcahy reported that there have been personnel changes in PSU, with Lt. McDavitt
transferring from PSU to lead the Traffic Unit; Lt. Tom Glynn, who was leading the Training
Academy, joining PSU as its new lieutenant; and the addition of Sgt. James Diggins who has
transferred into PSU.
Regarding the Training Academy, Dir. Mulcahy reported that Sgt. Beth Halloran will be the
director of the academy beginning with the incoming class. He noted that the CPD Cadet
Program is planning to send two current police cadets into the academy, and they have two
other individuals who are applying to the cadet program, and they will join the current cadets
who are still in that program.
In response to a question about a news story about Peace Officer Standards and Training
(POST) certification, Dir. Mulcahy explained that some unions have challenged some of the
certification questions that the POST Commission decided to use in that process.
In response to a question about the CALEA accreditation process for CPD and the revision of
department policies, Dir. Mulcahy reported Sgt. LeVecque has been focused on that effort and
has rewritten nearly 80 policies, and that the Board can be provided the index from the new
policy manual to allow it to identify policies that it is particularly interested in reviewing.
In response to a question about visiting the CPD Training Academy, Dir. Mulcahy responded
positively and noted that it would be valuable for Board members to have the opportunity to
experience the immersive simulator that CPD uses for scenario-based training, which Board
members responded to with interest.

Consideration of Complaints before the Board
Board Member Murray-Brown moved that the Board enter executive session pursuant to Section
21(a)(1) of the Mass. Open Meeting Law to discuss complaints PR-2022-001 and PR-2022-002,

Claire Davies, a Cambridge resident, stated that she knows Board Member Sealey and is
attending the meeting as a social worker and concerned citizen. She noted that she is very
interested in what is happening in New York City where the mayor announced that the city will
be using police to hospitalize people experiencing mental illness who are not able to care for
themselves. She wonders whether there is any official response from the Cambridge Police and
the Cambridge Public Health Department in particular and the City in general to New York City’s
decision, and explained that as a social worker who has worked at Boston Medical Center and at
“Mass and Cass” she is very concerned about how this may play out in other communities in the
wake of New York City’s decision.
Jennifer Hogue, a Cambridge resident, stated that she was happy to join the meeting and is
attending to listen.

•
•
•

•

•
•

two provisional officers, and anticipate that they will soon join the department.
Regarding the joint Cambridge/Northeastern University Training Academy, Dir. Mulcahy
explained that as other departments are choosing to send their cadets to the academy, the
incoming class will consist of 40 to 50 cadets from approximately ten police departments, and
they anticipate that Cambridge will have about 10 student officer recruits among them. The
academy will run from January to June, and he hopes that with COVID rates declining over
time, Board members will be able to observe either the classroom or physical training, and that
he can provide the Board a tentative training schedule to help Board member identify what
they would be interested in observing.
Dir. Mulcahy updated the Board on the CALEA accreditation process, noting that the CPD
Command Staff has been meeting weekly to review the revised policy manual section by
section, which will be followed by a review by the Cambridge Police unions. He also noted that
he has provided a draft of the table of contents for the revised policy manual.

Packet Pg. 29

Why is there a Police Review & Advisory Board?
A number of serious incidents in Cambridge led to the creation of the Board:


April 15, 1970: “Rioting” in Harvard Square and the CPD and Mass. State Police response led
to calls for civilian oversight of CPD.



November 1970: Incidents, including the beating of the Walton brothers at the police station
by six CPD officers led City Manager Corcoran to propose a “Citizens' Review Board”
designed "to handle citizen complaints and recommendations for improved service."



October 27, 1972: The in-custody death of 17-year-old Lawrence Largey sparked 5 nights of
“rioting” in Roosevelt Towers in the Wellington-Harrington neighborhood and further
exacerbated the CPD’s tense relations with communities of color.



In 1984, “the push for a Cambridge review board was sparked by the allegedly random arrest
last year of eight Blacks accused of attacking white youths,” according to the Christian Science
Monitor.

The Board provides a prompt, impartial and fair investigation of complaints brought by
individuals against members of the Cambridge Police Department. The Board was
established by Cambridge City Ordinance in 1984 and empaneled in July 1985 to:


Provide for citizen participation in reviewing Police Department policies, practices, and
procedures;



Provide a prompt, impartial and fair investigation of complaints brought by individuals
against members of the Cambridge Police Department; and



Develop programs and strategies to promote positive police/community relations and
to provide opportunities for expanded discussions, improved understanding, and
innovative ways of resolving differences.

The Board and Complaints
The Police Review & Advisory Board is a City department with a board of
five Cambridge residents.


Completely independent of the CPD, the Board is authorized to receive,
investigate, and mediate complaints and to review complaint investigations
completed by the CPD’s Professional Standards Unit.



The Traditional Narrative about the Origins of U.S. Policing
“When one thinks about policing in early America, there are a few images that
may come to mind: A county sheriff enforcing a debt between neighbors, a
constable serving an arrest warrant on horseback, or a lone night watchman
carrying a lantern through his sleeping town. These organized practices were
adapted to the colonies from England and formed the foundations of American
law enforcement.”

“The Police are the Public, and the Public are the Police”
Sir Robert Peel’s Seventh Principle, 1829
“Police, at all times, should maintain a relationship with the public that gives
reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public
are the police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to
give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in
the interests of community welfare and existence.”

“The Police are the Public, and the Public are the Police”
 Some form of civilian oversight of law enforcement is important in order

to strengthen trust with the community.

 Every community should define the appropriate form and structure of

civilian oversight to meet the needs of that community.

 Civilian oversight alone is not sufficient to gain legitimacy; without it,

however, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the police to maintain the
public’s trust.

Evolution of Civilian Oversight
Civilian Oversight had traditionally been
reactive:
▪ Follows a high-profile incident or scandal
▪ Responds to individual complaints
▪ Reviews policies after one or more

complaints
▪ Emphasizes legalistic rules
▪ Uses adversarial, administrative process

▪ Recommends sanctions for individual

officers
▪ Relies on deterrence

Packet Pg. 44

Evolution of Civilian Oversight
Civilian Oversight is increasingly proactive:
▪ Explores problems proactively (e.g.,

investigation, collection, and analysis
of data)

▪ Identifies underlying issues and causes
▪ Focuses on organizational change

▪ Concentrates on reduction and prevention

of misconduct

▪ Builds partnerships with law enforcement

▪ Creates bridges between law enforcement

and the wider community

Facts about the Field: Civilian Oversight
 There are more than 230 civilian oversight entities across the United States

— and no two are exactly alike.
 Most large cities and large law enforcement agencies have oversight agencies,

as do a growing number of small and mid-size cities.
 Many began in reaction to specific incidents of police misconduct or scandals.

 Civilian oversight has been prominently featured in U.S. Dept. of Justice

settlement agreements.
 Increasingly, communities are establishing civilian oversight as part of

reexamining public safety and policing.

Models of Oversight:
Is one model better than another?

No: Each model has strengths and weaknesses.
When deciding what model to implement, the needs of the community
should be carefully assessed:
▪ History and “narrative” of the community or communities
▪ Level of support; both financial and political
▪ Level of authority and independence
▪ Expected outcomes

“What happens when they followed the rules, but…?”
The focus on identifying and addressing police misconduct is necessary but insufficient.
 “Lawful but Awful”

 When there’s no violation of policy, we still need to ask, “what went wrong and

what should be done in the future?” – as well as, “Who experienced harm, and
what does each of those individuals need to experience to be supported in their
efforts to address/mitigate the impacts of being harmed?

 Back-end accountability is designed to answer the question of what happened,

whereas front-end accountability actively works to create systems and practices
that promote and support individual and community well-being work to
counteract the

 Procedural justice is more important than the lawful nature of police conduct.

Accountability
Accountability must be demonstrated by all applicable stakeholders:
 Accountability supports the goals of community-oriented policing.

 Oversight can help hold law enforcement accountable for an individual officer’s

actions.
 Oversight can improve the quality of the department’s internal investigations of

alleged misconduct
 When the oversight agency confirms a complainant’s allegation(s), complainants

and their communities may feel validated.
 When the oversight agency exonerates the officer, the officer may feel supported.

grow.

 Data-driven policy analysis is increasingly common.
 Access to department records and information varies

greatly.

 Accountability and evaluation requirements for civilian

oversight agencies are increasingly common.

Expectations when Considering Change
The work of civilian oversight can be difficult:
• Understanding stakeholder expectations and clarity about what is possible

are both important.
• The need to be fair and consistent in the work often makes it difficult to
meet the broad range of expectations in a community.

The benefits of working with NACOLE as a neutral partner:
• NACOLE’s capacity for professional development, training, and advice is

based on a national network of practitioners
• Just as one might consider a government perspective, an academic
perspective, a labor perspective, a police executive perspective, communities
can benefit from a civilian oversight perspective.
