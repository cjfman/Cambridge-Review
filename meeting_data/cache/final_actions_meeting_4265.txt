1.1

June 5, 2023
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am hereby recommending the following amendments to the FY24 Submitted General Fund Budget.
These amendments to the Budget reflect changes requested by City Council based on feedback and
discussions during the three and a half days of public hearings on the FY24 Operating and Capital
Budget.
First, the City will increase funds budgeted to the Affordable Housing Trust (AHT) by $1,600,000
(Community Development Department, Other Ordinary Maintenance). The amended budget increase of
the non-Community Preservation Act (CPA) appropriation to the AHT matches the 7.1% overall increase
in the FY24 Operating Budget from FY23 (excluding the shift of affordable housing funds from Capital).
The total amended FY24 appropriation of non-CPA funding to the AHT will now be $24,645,750 (from
$23,045,750 originally submitted as part of the FY24 Budget). The total amended appropriation of all
City funding to AHT will now be $41,105,750 (from $39,505,750 originally submitted as part of the
FY24 Budget), presuming an 80% allocation of CPA funding to affordable housing.
The Council also indicated an interest in greater overall funding for the AHT through a one-time free cash
appropriation and a three-year plan for increasing funding to 10% of the City’s Operating Budget. These
are significant policy decisions that will affect other priorities expressed by the Council including
universal pre-kindergarten, climate, municipal broadband, and open space. I am recommending that we
discuss affordable housing strategy and budget in fall 2023 and work through broader trade-off’s as part
of City-Council goal setting starting in January 2024.
Second, I am recommending an increase in the appropriation to the Cambridge Health Alliance of
$416,000 (Cambridge Health Alliance, Other Ordinary Maintenance). The additional funding is in
recognition of the fiscal challenges currently facing the Cambridge Health Alliance and will allow the
organization to maintain at least four positions based in the Cambridge Public Health Department, which
would have otherwise been eliminated in FY24. The recommended increase will bring the total FY24
appropriation to the Cambridge Health Alliance to $8,316,000 (from $7,900,000 originally submitted as
part of the FY24 Budget). It is anticipated that the Health Services Agreement between the City and the
Health Alliance will also be amended in order to account for these changes. These increases will bring the
total FY24 Operating Budget to $883,773,885 (from the initially submitted FY24 Operating Budget of
$881,757,885).

Packet Pg. 43

1.1

These increases will be funded through property tax revenue. With these changes the estimated increase in
the property tax levy for FY24 is approximately 9.2% (from the original FY24 estimate of 8.8%).

Please find attached proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO). The attached document reflects the following changes to the
existing BEUDO:
•

Amendments proposed by the Community Development Department (CDD) in
November 2021, to introduce GHG performance requirements for BEUDO
properties and achieve science-based GHG reductions, developed through an
engagement process primarily with BEUDO building owners and in consultation
with the Climate Protection Action Committee (now Cambridge Climate
Committee) and the Net Zero Task Force.

•

Amendment adopted by Ordinance Committee to accelerate the target
timeframe to eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from BEUDO buildings
from 2050 to 2035, responding to the urgency of the climate crisis, evolving
scientific data, and a desire for Cambridge to lead the way in responding to
climate change.

•

Amendments adopted by the Ordinance Committee at the hearing of April 26,
2023, including:
a. CDD proposal responding to a policy order to recommend flexibility
mechanisms to accommodate a 2035 target for eliminating GHG
emissions from large buildings. Key changes exclude residential
condominiums from BEUDO performance requirements, place
properties with less than 100,000 sq. ft. of development on a 2050
timeline, allow limited use of carbon credits for large buildings, create a
5-year deferral mechanism, and a Review Board to evaluate hardship
waiver requests

Additional ideas have been proposed by one or more councillors that were not voted
on. The attached proposal for amendments incorporates such ideas and clarifications
that are consistent with the votes taken by the Council or Ordinance Committee on this
matter. Ideas that are inconsistent with prior votes, or that have significant policy
ramifications that were either not discussed, or are better implemented through other
regulations, are not included. The attached chart summarizes the changes incorporated
and proposals not included.

BACKGROUND
The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was adopted in 2014 and
requires energy and water reporting from commercial properties over 25,000 square
feet and residential properties over 50 units. This regulates approximately 1,100
buildings in Cambridge which are responsible for approximately 75% of the building
sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The ordinance has successfully increased transparency and awareness of energy and
water consumption by the regulated buildings. BEUDO includes a provision requiring
that the Community Development Department review the impact of the ordinance on
energy performance of covered properties, and recommend amendments to improve
building energy performance if it has not improved significantly. Analysis performed in
2018 concluded that energy performance of covered properties had not improved
significantly.
The attached proposal for amendments to BEUDO represents an essential step in
Cambridge’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. The Net Zero Action Plan
identifies BEUDO performance requirements as an integral part of a comprehensive
suite of actions which together will phase out GHG emissions from new buildings, many
existing buildings, and much of the energy supply system in Cambridge. The Net Zero
Task Force, the Cambridge Climate Committee, and the Climate Crisis Working Group,
have all urged the prompt advancement of strong BEUDO performance requirements.

Proposal

Staff Comments

New Buildings

•

New buildings should have a zero baseline in
2025.

The Fossil Fuel Free Demonstration Project will
require all-electric construction for all new
buildings (except labs, hospitals, and medical
offices). New buildings will also have to reach net
zero by 2035 or 2050, based on size and type.

Embodied Carbon

•

The Review Board shall make
recommendations to City Council within 2
years.

Embodied carbon is a topic relevant to the
construction of new buildings, as opposed to the
regulation of emissions from existing buildings.
Embodied carbon reporting is now being required
through zoning.

Renewable Electricity

•

Allow biogas/biofuel to count as renewable
energy.

The definition allows regulations to permit new
types of renewable energy in the future. At
present, many types of biogas and biofuel are not
actually renewable. As a result, their use may
delay actual building decarbonization.

Deferral: A Covered Property may apply to the Review Board with a detailed plan to defer
compliance with any Greenhouse Gas Emissions requirements for up to five years, such that the
cumulative Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the Covered Property from the start of the deferred
compliance through 2050 do not exceed what they would be without such deferral. Such plans
must detail the expected measures that will result in compliance within five years and must
comply with any regulations that may be promulgated hereunder. The Review Board may issue
its approval of such plans for one or more years, upon which said Covered Property is deemed to
be in compliance for said years. In no event shall a deferred compliance plan be approved that
results in Greenhouse Gas Emissions being above zero in 2050 or beyond. After the conclusion
of the approved deferral period of five years or less, the Covered Property shall annually
purchase Alternative Compliance Credits for any Greenhouse Gas Emissions in excess of the
amount proposed in the deferral plan. The Assistant City Manager for Community Development

is applied, and documentation thereof must be submitted to the Department by the subsequent
May 1 reporting deadline. In calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions for a Covered Property, an
Owner that uses combustible fuels to generate electricity for direct use by the Covered Property
may subtract Renewable Electricity from said generated electricity only as long as the Emission
Factor for the generated electricity is less than or equal to the Emission Factor for electricity
purchased from the grid. The Assistant City Manager for Community Development shall
promulgate regulations pursuant to 8.67.130 to establish a methodology for evaluating the
Emission Factor for generated electricity compared to grid electricity.

(8)

Deferral: A Covered Property may apply to the Review Board with a detailed plan to defer
compliance with any Greenhouse Gas Emissions requirements for up to five years, such that the
cumulative Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the Covered Property from the start of the deferred
compliance through 2050 do not exceed what they would be without such deferral. Such plans
must detail the expected measures that will result in compliance within five years and must
comply with any regulations that may be promulgated hereunder. The Review Board may issue
its approval of such plans for one or more years, upon which said Covered Property is deemed to
be in compliance for said years. In no event shall a deferred compliance plan be approved that
results in Greenhouse Gas Emissions being above zero in 2050 or beyond. After the conclusion
of the approved deferral period of five years or less, the Covered Property shall annually
10
Packet Pg. 93

purchase Alternative Compliance Credits for any Greenhouse Gas Emissions in excess of the
amount proposed in the deferral plan. The Assistant City Manager for Community Development
shall promulgate regulations pursuant to 8.67.130 that establish minimum performance
requirements that a Covered Property must meet during a period of deferred compliance.
(9)

Hardship: A Covered Property may submit a Hardship Compliance Plan for consideration to the
Review Board. Hardship Compliance Plans must comply with any regulations that may be
promulgated hereunder. The Review Board may issue its approval of such Hardship Compliance
Plan for one or more years, upon which said Covered Property is deemed to be in compliance for
said years.

(10)

Campus: A Campus may choose to comply with the requirements of Section 8.67.100 at the level of
each Covered Property or at the level of the aggregate Campus Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and the
Owner shall determine the method by which they intend to comply, and once determined, this method
shall be used for all Compliance Periods. The annual performance requirement for a Campus complying
at the aggregate level shall be the total of Greenhouse Gas Emissions allowed for each of the individual
Covered Properties in that year, as determined by the performance requirements in 8.67.100(2)-(4).
The use of Verified Carbon Credits by such a Campus shall similarly be limited to the total Verified
Carbon Credits allowed for the individual Covered Properties, as determined by 8.67.100(5). The
Greenhouse Gas Emissions of such a Campus shall be the total Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the
individual Covered Properties. An Owner may only define one Campus from their Covered Properties.

(11)

Backup generation: The use of Energy for emergency back-up systems shall be considered exempt from
the Greenhouse Gas Emissions requirements of this section through 2030. The Review Board shall
evaluate the appropriateness of continued exemption by May 1, 2030.
8.67.110 MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS AND DATA VERIFICATION

A. Any practice that by design or effect discriminates against individuals, because of race,
color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation,
family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military
status or source of income is of public concern, as such discrimination creates strife,
hostility and unrest, threatens or impairs the rights and privileges of individuals and
deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society. Discrimination that deprives
individuals of equal opportunities is unjust and results in serious injury to the public safety,
health and welfare of the City.
B. Accordingly, it is the policy of the City to safeguard the equal opportunities of all
individuals in the City in accordance with their abilities, regardless of their race, color, sex,
age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and
relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military status or source
of income and to prevent discrimination against such individuals in the provision of City
services and in employment, housing and real estate, education, credit, bonding, insurance
and public accommodations.
C. Further, it is the policy of the City to encourage harmony and mutual respect among its
inhabitants and visitors and to reduce tensions and strife caused by discrimination.

A. The City Council recognizes the diverse composition of its residents citizenry and values
its people. The City Council acknowledges that the people's lives have evolved from when
laws governing family relationships were enacted. Perpetuation of the traditional definitions
of "family" excludes a significant segment of the Cambridge population, deprives them of
recognition and validation, and denies certain rights that should be afforded to persons who
share their homes, their hearts and their lives. The City, recognizing its commitment to
Packet Pg. 106

2.1

nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its residents citizens and employees, adopts this
chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships.
B. The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established
by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk
and obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of
access for domestic partners. This chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights
Ordinance, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religious creed,
disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and relationship structure,
gender identity, marital status, and family status, military status, and source of income, also
equalizes the treatment of City employees.

provisions of the Cambridge Human Rights Ordinance, Cambridge Code Chapter 2.76.

L.

It is an unlawful practice for any person to harass, intimidate, threaten, assault or otherwise
discriminate against any person in or upon any public accommodation because of the race,
color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation,
family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military

2.76.160 City discrimination policy.
A.

Any practice that by design or effect discriminates against individuals, because of race,
color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation,
family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military
status or source of income is of public concern, as such discrimination creates strife,
hostility and unrest, threatens or impairs the rights and privileges of individuals and
deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society. Discrimination that deprives
individuals of equal opportunities is unjust and results in serious injury to the public safety,
health and welfare of the City.

B.

Accordingly, it is the policy of the City to safeguard the equal opportunities of all
individuals in the City in accordance with their abilities, regardless of their race, color, sex,
age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and
relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military status or source
of income and to prevent discrimination against such individuals in the provision of City
services and in employment, housing and real estate, education, credit, bonding, insurance
and public accommodations.

C.

Further, it is the policy of the City to encourage harmony and mutual respect among its
inhabitants and visitors and to reduce tensions and strife caused by discrimination.

Amend Chapter 2.119 – Domestic Partnerships as follows:

Attachment: non-discrimination ordinance_finaldraft_PartOne (POR 2023 #97 : Amendments to Protect Family Inclusion and Relationship

2.1.a

Packet Pg. 124

2.119.010 Recognition and scope.
A.

The City Council recognizes the diverse composition of its residents citizenry and values its
people. The City Council acknowledges that the people's lives have evolved from when
laws governing family relationships were enacted. Perpetuation of the traditional definitions
of "family" excludes a significant segment of the Cambridge population, deprives them of
recognition and validation, and denies certain rights that should be afforded to persons who
share their homes, their hearts and their lives. The City, recognizing its commitment to
nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its residents citizens and employees, adopts this
chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships.

B.

The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established by
the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk and
obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for
domestic partners. This chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which
bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national
origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and relationship structure, gender identity,
marital status, and family status, military status, and source of income, also equalizes the
treatment of City employees.

2.119.100 Retaliation.
No person shall discriminate or retaliate against a person who seeks the benefit of this
chapter, registers or makes a declaration pursuant to its provisions, or assists another person in
obtaining the benefits of this chapter to enter into a domestic partnership between two or more
people. Any person who so discriminates or retaliates shall be penalized in accordance with the
provisions of the Cambridge Human Rights Ordinance, Cambridge Code Chapter 2.76.

Dear Manager, Mayor, and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance to share some thoughts on the proposed budget.
While we very much appreciate the investment in pre-K, we are concerned about the elimination of paraprofessional
positions.
We would like to make sure the budget contains adequate funds for purchasing properties, such as the Matignon
School, to be used for priorities such as affordable housing and open space.
We want there to be funds for turning Envision into a real plan, meaning a plan that balances and reconciles competing
goals. We would like to see funds for the analysis needed to give regular presentations to the Council on the city’s
progress in meeting the Envision targets. We would like to see funds for CDD to work with residents and neighborhood
groups to develop community benefit plans to propose to developers seeking up-zoning, including possibly holding a
charette. These requests could be facilitated by hiring more urban designers.
There should be substantially more funds for affordable housing. While the growth in the affordable housing budget
has been good, it still does not meet our city’s needs. In particular, we should increase purchases of existing apartment
buildings. There needs to be a greater emphasis on programs that reduce the displacement of long-time residents and
families due to soaring rent increases.
Our budget needs to fully fund the Urban Forest Master Plan. After last year’s drought, we need to ensure adequate
maintenance of our park and street trees, and a reduction in tree maintenance is harmful. We need to ensure funds
for tree replacement due to drought and to better prepare for future droughts. Further, we need to fund a plan to
relocate larger trees when working on parks, rather than destroying them. Lastly, during the pandemic and recent
drought, many of our parks were under-maintained. Our parks now need an infusion of maintenance, including
planting perennials and pruning or replacing shrubs.
Lastly, we ask that the Council establish clear review mechanisms to judge the effectiveness and efficiency of each
department.
Thank you for your consideration,
Lee Farris, President

Economic Development & University Relations Committee Report to City Council
5/15/23

Dear Chairman Toner,
Thank you for getting the Community Development Department (CDD) presentations on the Agenda Packet and thank
you and your committee for reporting back on your meeting.
However, I am totally disappointed and deeply concerned. The City Council accepting your Committee's report without
any discussion proves, yet again, how desperately we need reforms in the City governance. The two reports from CDD
should not have been accepted in the first place by your Committee let alone reporting back to the City Council.
Through you, please require CDD to provide documents highlighted and in bold red below. Furthermore, from now on,
any report from the City departments to the City Council that are based on outside contractors should include
deliverable schedules and delivered documents as I am constantly finding City reports are one step behind what the
contractors are doing. The City is presenting their version of the delivered documents to the community to gather
feedback when in fact the City has already accepted the contractor's deliverables and had given them permission to
proceed. This is my observation based on public records I have obtained through 29 (and counting) Public Records
Requests and even appealing to the State Public Records Office on some of the denied requests.
According to the minutes of the City Council on 5/15/2023:
