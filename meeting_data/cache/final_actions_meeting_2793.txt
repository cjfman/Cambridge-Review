February 8, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,000,000 from the Community Benefits
Stabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance for the
purpose of entering into grant agreements with nonprofit organizations to provide services to
vulnerable residents during the COVID 19 emergency and recovery. The City Council
previously approved my request for an appropriation of $1 million dollars from the Community
Benefits Stabilization Fund for this purpose on May 18, 2020. Those funds were awarded to 106
community-based organizations based on recommendations from the Community Benefits
Advisory Committee. Based on the continuing needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
capacity of Cambridge’s not for profit community to address those needs, I am recommending
the appropriation of the additional $1 million dollars.
Pursuant to Chapter 2.127 of the Cambridge Municipal Code, the Community Benefits Advisory
Committee (CBAC) is charged with soliciting and evaluating applications for the use of
community benefits funds from community-based organizations based on priorities established
by the City Council. The City Council voted on a broad set of priorities when it adopted the 2017
Community Needs Assessment, which can be viewed at
<https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/News/2-17/communityneedsassessmentreport>. The
Needs Assessment is very comprehensive and continues to provide important, broad guidance.
That needs assessment was considered by CBAC in designing the simple application and speedy
decision-making process by which the $1 million dollars was allocated last summer.
Our nonprofit community provides basic needs and other critical supports for low-income,
under-resourced, and vulnerable families and individuals at risk. The Cambridge Nonprofit
Coalition has surveyed the nonprofit community twice and heard about both the deep needs of
our residents as well the increased financial stress of the not for profits even as many of them
have received a variety of different grants through the City or other funders. The use of
Community Benefits Funds through grant agreements with nonprofit organizations will provide
additional COVID-19 related assistance and critical supports to both the nonprofit organizations
and to our residents impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
If this appropriation is approved, CBAC will proceed with a process closely following the
successful process by which the earlier $1 million was awarded in grants.

The City Council should be proud of the assistance the City has been able to provide to its
residents, small businesses and nonprofits through the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund, the
Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, federal Community Development Block Grant and
CARES funding, the Housing Stabilization Fund and the Community Benefits Fund.

WHEREAS:

A number of residents who live on Fairmont Avenue have raised concerns that, with
requests for deliveries from the likes of Amazon and other out-of-town businesses
dramatically increased over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant amount
of deliveries have not made it to their intended destination due to the packages being
instead delivered to the similarly named Fairmont Street; and

WHEREAS:

While local food delivery services tend to understand the differences between these
two streets, and tend to utilize drivers who are familiar with the distinction between
Fairmont Avenue and the much lengthier Fairmont Street, too many businesses located
outside of Cambridge have apparently been using these street names interchangeably,
leading to far too many packages not reaching their intended destinations; and

WHEREAS:

A growing chorus of voices from Fairmont Avenue residents have been urging that
their street’s name be changed so that it will no longer be confused with Fairmont
Street, and deliveries to these residents will be more likely to arrive unimpeded; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the appropriate City
personnel to determine what actions would need to be taken in order to rename
Fairmont Avenue, to engage with residents of Fairmont Avenue to include their voices
on any street re-naming process that may go forward, and to report back to the City
Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:

Cambridge should design and build public spaces in a way that is more consistent with
our values as a city that is welcoming to all; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council passed a resolution calling on the MBTA to remove newly installed
bench bars from the Central and Harvard stations; now therefore be it

departments and staff, including the Commission for Persons with Disabilities, to not

redesigned, including in the upcoming redesign of Carl Barron Plaza, and to create
design guidelines that ensure our public spaces are truly welcoming to the entire
community; and be it further

WHEREAS:

CCTV Executive Director, Susan Fleischmann, has announced her retirement from her
position as Executive Director after 32 years of dedicated service; and

WHEREAS:

Susan was a founding staff member of CCTV when it opened its doors in 1988,
succeeded to be its Executive Director in 1993, and has served CCTV and our City
with great distinction in that capacity for the past 27 years; and

WHEREAS:

Susan, who had been involved with community media since 1976, leveraged her
considerable knowledge of media, her adroit people skills, and her vision and drive to
have CCTV reflect her strong social justice values; and

WHEREAS:

During her almost three decades of service at CCTV, Susan transformed our City’s
fledgling community media center into a nationally and internationally recognized and
award winning powerhouse in the world of community media; and

WHEREAS:

Under Susan’s leadership, CCTV’s outpouring of superior work has been recognized
for its innovation and excellence, receiving the Overall Excellence in Public Access
Award a dozen times from the Alliance for Community Media, and earned top awards
in the Hometown Media Festival, Interlochen Film Festival, New England Video
Festival, Boston Center for the Arts Youth Film Festival, MFA Youth Film Festival,
WGBH Shorts Festival, and the Annual Northeast Video Festival; and

WHEREAS:

Susan, having guided CCTV into its role as the pre-eminent voice of our community,
protecting the rights of free speech and equitable access to information, harnessed the
communication reach of CCTV as the COVID pandemic compromised many of our
City and community centers, and with her guidance, CCTV pivoted to be the nexus of
COVID information in our City, dispersing accurate local information, documenting
the impacts of the pandemic within our community, and providing much-needed
programming to both educate and entertain our City during this difficult year; and

WHEREAS:

Susan, described by the CCTV Staff and Board as a visionary leader who managed
CCTV with compassion, authenticity, kindness and humility, will be most remembered
by those who worked closest with her for her unflagging encouragement to grow and
see possibility where they thought it did not exist; and

WHEREAS:

Susan’s leadership will be sorely missed, likewise her passion for community media,
her belief in the youth, seniors, immigrants, and all those she nurtured when they came
into the CCTV studios, and the mark of self-reflection and social justice she imprinted
into our Cambridge community; and
Packet Pg. 54

WHEREAS:

Her inspiring legacy will influence Cambridge media creators for decades to come;

Fleischmann for her many years of dedicated service to the residents and to the City of
Cambridge, and wish her much happiness in her retirement; and be it further

WHEREAS:

Governor Baker recently announced that the Commonwealth will move into Phase 2 of
its COVID vaccination plan on February 1st; and

WHEREAS:

Early education and K-12 workers were recently pushed back to be part of the third
priority group included in the Phase 2, meaning they will have to wait longer than
anticipated to be vaccinated; and

WHEREAS:

With an expansion of in-person learning slated to begin on March 1st and concerns
among Cambridge Public School (CPS) educators and staff over their personal health,
ensuring these employees are vaccinated as soon as possible is paramount; and

WHEREAS:

CPS educators and staff being vaccinated will also help restore families’ confidence
and trust in schools and in-person learning as being a safe option for their children,
helping parents return to the workforce while ensuring their children can access highquality in-person education; and

WHEREAS:

Given the ensuing delays in education workers’ vaccination, and the need for both staff
members and scholars to feel safe in in-person classrooms, it is critical that the City
remains proactive and has a plan in place to rapidly vaccinate CPS educators and staff
in convenient locations with ready availability when the times comes; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Public Health Department recently vaccinated all Cambridge first
responders, including firefighters, police officers, and EMTs in Operation Nightengale,
making it easy for first responders to obtain a vaccine locally and a similar plan could
be created to ensure timely delivery of vaccinations to CPS staff; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge Public
Health Department, the School Department, and other relevant City departments to
develop a comprehensive plan to vaccinate CPS educators and staff, similar to
Operation Nightengale for first responders; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter by the February
22nd general meeting.

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and

WHEREAS:

Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support,
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7)
they consider themselves to be family; and

WHEREAS:

Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4)
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and

WHEREAS:

This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and

WHEREAS:

This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however,
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and

WHEREAS:

There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more
people in a given relationship; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and

WHEREAS:

In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it

An Open Letter to Cambridge City Council
In the past 42 years, the City of Cambridge has spent millions of dollars, and hundreds of residents have
volunteered their time to address a number of zoning-related projects:
• 1979 The Fish Book/Alewife Revitalization Plan
• 1993 Towards a Sustainable Future (updated 2007)
• 2001 The Alewife Master Plan
• 2001 The Eastern Cambridge Planning Study
• 2005 The Concord-Alewife Planning Study
• 2011-2013 the Kendall Square, Central Square Planning Study
• 2019 The Citywide Envision process
Have these plans ever been implemented?
Most recently, the City of Cambridge spent $3 million and thousands of City personnel (and
community) hours on the Envision Report forwarded to the Council in 2019, that has yet to be finalized
and approved. With development happening all over the City and the lack of a ratified plan governing
development, Cambridge is at risk of losing its identity as a center of innovation and excellence. This is
not acceptable, and the impacts are huge in neighborhoods across the city.
The results of the City Council’s unwillingness to approve Envision mean that in essence:
•

Developers can exploit the City’s piecemeal (development-by-development) approach, rather
than following actual urban planning priorities, and we get poor results: just look at the Triangle,
East Cambridge, Inman Square

•

Developers can cherry-pick what they want

•

Developers’ amenities are accorded a higher merit than the needs identified by neighborhoods

•

Neighborhood associations and other community groups are addressing zoning, infrastructure,
and open space issues for which the City should be responsible

Enough! We implore that you, the Councillors, take charge and write zoning that ensures developers are
committed to sharing and realizing the Envision for our City’s future:
•

Postpone active development proposals, such as CC&F’s rezoning petition, until you address and
approve the Envision Report.

•

Calibrate the Envision report to reflect the new state of affairs for the City during and post COVID

•

Commit to moving forward the Envison plan of goals to an Implementation Plan

•

Approve the Envision Implementation Plan

•

Once approved, hire a firm to write the zoning guidelines for each part of the city.

Hi,
I just wanted to register my support for policy orders #23, #26, #27 of 2021, on the agenda for this week, especially
policy order #23. In principle, we should not be even need to be having this debate – as I've written before, I believe
that homelessness and rent burdenships are policy choices that we, as a city and state and country, collectively make
and maintain – but given the reality (and certainly acknowledging the work the city has already done to try to make the
correct policy choice here, while also believing that much more can be done) of people experiencing homelessness on
the streets of Cambridge, such a step to remove hostile architecture is absolutely necessary.
All the best,
Kavish

Infrastructure and the Unhoused

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors:
On Policy Order 5 asking the city manager to develop a 10-year infrastructure plan for the city. This is critical in light of
all the new developments that have been and are still coming to the city, which will impact everything from electricity
and plumbing to schools, traffic circulation, open spaces, the environment, and more. We are flying now without a pilot,
meaning without an overall city plan, so developers are proposing and designing projects – and too often it is the
neighborhood groups, and quickly assembled groups of residents that are left to address design and impacts. This
important P.O. appears to have been written in part in response to a letter that a number of neighborhood groups wrote
to Council last Monday asking that the city finalize the Envision Plan before more developments are approved. (see also
COM 53 #2021). I urge every City Councillor to support P.O. 5 and the need for a city-wide plan (finalizing Envision). It is
hard to imagine any city, much less one of our historic importance, density, and wealth, that is facing so much ongoing
development, that is without a formalized City Plan in place to help shape these and future developments. Equally
importantly, this plan would greatly help our Planning Board, Zoning Appeals Board, and Cambridge Historical
Commission in their work. Dennis Carlone has also submitted a communication (COF 2021 #10) on the Impacts of
Climate Change (Harvard Magazine - Nov-Dec 2020): A finalized Envision Plan will also help us to address these larger
environmental impacts in a way that will greatly impact present and future city inhabitants.
On the Unhoused and Charter Right A: This is an effort by a group of concerned citizens to house the unhoused in noncongregant housing. While part of this project was passed by Council last Monday, I want to emphasize here is how vital
it is for the city to find a LONG-TERM solution to housing our homeless population. We should be a leader on this – and
we are not. When politicians (and others) advocating for things such as “a warm socks drive” and similar piecemeal
endeavors for the homeless, this underscores for me our intentional (verging on immoral) inadequacy as a city to
address this issue. Why aren’t we providing long term non-congregant housing? Warm socks get wet and soon become
dangerous. Other progressive cities have taken giant steps to address and solve this problem and it is time for us to do
so as well. The fact that the federal government will pay for this effort makes it even more irresponsible that we are NOT
doing something about this; Once we start this program the unhoused will also get the critical medical and other care
they need. I just don’t understand those who insist “we are doing all we can” when clearly we are not! On inhospitable
architecture – if we did what we need to do and actually provide housing for our unhoused this would not an issue
because people would be sleeping in beds!

Green Roofs Zoning Petition

02.07.2021
Green Roofs Zoning Petition
Dear Members of the Planning Board
I wish to express general support of green roofs, along with my concerns about the Green Roofs Zoning Petition (APP
2020 #46). As the Petitioners state, green roofs are an important and under-utilized tool to increase climate resiliency in
a variety of ways. Cambridge has the resources and leadership to lead the way on progressive building requirements to
slow reduce carbon emissions.
At the same time, we need to provide greater housing opportunities, especially affordable housing, in order to house our
own population. Aside from our desire to create a welcoming, diverse city for all, by not keeping up with demand of our
daily workforce, we create suburbanization and commuting - which is the largest single contributor to greenhouse gases.
Green roofs are expensive- anywhere between $10-$25/sf, depending on the type of roof and structural implications.
Increased construction costs result in higher rents, home sales prices, and constrict non-profit development of affordable
housing. As an architect of non-profit affordable housing, I know that the additional burden of installing a green roof on a
100% affordable project without full subsidy would be highly unlikely, if not impossible.
I would propose that the goals of this petition be met through improving existing zoning regulations, as well as through
adoption of the Cool Factor that the Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force is currently formulating. A few specific
suggestions:
• Reflective (white) roof membranes on flat/low pitch roofs, and low SRI roofing on all roofs should be required of all
construction and roof replacements. They achieve several of the goals of this petition at a negligible additional cost.
• Building sites (including land and roof surface) should be considered holistically, per the CRZTF/Cool Factor
proposal. (ie. A small green roof on a large, dark-surfaced property would not be acceptable.)
• Multi-family residential development or renovations should be given special consideration and provisions in any new
zoning requirements. Otherwise, higher development costs will translate into higher rents or sales prices, or discourage
residential development – particularly in the case of 100% affordable projects.

I would like to urge the City of Cambridge to support Charter Right 3 and councilor Zondervan’s amendment to that
policy order. Our unhoused community already suffers from lack of non-congregate shelter and resources every
single day, and taking away one of the few sheltered places they can safely rest does nothing more than reinforce
that harm.
We hear the argument often that the hostile architecture installed is actually installed for the benefit of disabled
and senior citizens. Unhoused people frequently fall into both of those categories. So I don’t think the council
should accept Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor Nolan’s amendments. Vice Mayor Mallon’s amendment removes
the ask to create design guidelines for future projects, the ask to remove existing hostile architecture in the city,
and the specific reference to Carl Barron Plaza which will soon be redesigned. Councillor Nolan’s amendment shifts
the balance of the order uncomfortably towards housed people. These amendments hide behind legitimate
concerns for the elderly and disabled communities in order to act against the interest of the most vulnerable
unhoused seniors and disabled people. Members of the unhoused community have supported the specific asks in
this policy order, and they should remain.
I am glad that the city has provided some services to the unhoused community already in the face of the pandemic.
We have never said that the city has done NOTHING for the homeless community. We understand that the city
spent $10 million on supporting non-profits who address homelessness, but the city has spent $0 dollars on noncongregate shelter, and that is what we want to highlight. Instead of spending Cambridge taxpayer funds to
support unsafe shelter, the city should have used federal FEMA funding over the past year to support safe noncongregate shelter. Unlike what was said in last week’s meeting, Spaulding is a congregate shelter, and not a noncongregate one. What homeless community members have explicitly asked for are private spaces, and Spaulding
definitionally does not meet this demand.
Thank you,
Ben

Comment on Charter Right 3

Hello,
My name is David Morgan. I live on Mass Ave in North Cambridge. I've chosen to live in Cambridge twice in my life, for a
total of five years, and my plan is to stay and raise my son here.
Last night, I found a man going through my grocery delivery for his dinner. He was poor and likely unhoused. What
struck me about this incident was that I wasn't offended by his actions. I was angered that in our wealthy city anyone
should struggle to eat or find shelter. My feelings were sharpened by the disparities between us. I went inside to my
private apartment, where I can safely manage the ongoing health crisis outside. He went out into a snowstorm.
I’m here today to join many other residents in urging the City of Cambridge to support Charter Right 3 and councilor
Zondervan’s amendment to that policy order. Please reject the amendments by Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor
Nolan. While noble, they fail to keep the focus on unhoused people, where it belongs.
Non-congregate shelter is the least we can do in a high-risk area during a pandemic. It should not be an emergency
measure limited to Covid response, but part of the city's ongoing commitment to getting and keeping people housed.
Finally, I would like to request that we not wait for public space redesigns to address the issue of hostile architecture. As
an urban planner, I know that universal designs for public space are widely available. I'm sure that many local firms and
universities have expertise they would be eager to contribute. Let's be proactive about ridding the city of hostile
architecture. It has no place in our city, or any city.
Thank you,
David

Support Charter Right 3 - the unhoused deserve better

To the Cambridge City Council,
My name is Deb Nicholson and I live at 338 Norfolk Street in Cambridge. I've been a homeowner and resident for ten
years.
I'm writing to urge the City of Cambridge to support Charter Right 3 and councilor Zondervan’s amendment to that
policy order. Our unhoused community already suffers from lack of non-congregate shelter and resources every single
day, and taking away one of the few sheltered places they can safely rest does nothing more than reinforce that harm.
We hear the argument often that the hostile architecture installed is actually installed for the benefit of disabled and
senior citizens. Unhoused people frequently fall into both of those categories. I don’t think the council should accept
Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor Nolan’s amendments. I believe that Cambridge can find a way to stop doing violence
to its unhoused community by working with its elderly and its people with disabilities without pitting people against
each other.
While Cambridge has done some work to address the crisis of unhoused people, there is still much more to be done.
People need private spaces in order to rebuild their lives. I hope that Cambridge - one of the wealthiest towns in our
Commonwealth - will find some budget for much needed, safer, non-congregate housing.
Thank you,
Deb

Public Comment on Hostile Architecture in Cambridge

Hi, my name is Cassandra and I have worked in Cambridge for five years. I would like to urge the City of Cambridge to
support Charter Right 3 and councilor Zondervan’s amendment to that policy order. Our unhoused population is already
struggling during the coronavirus pandemic due to a lack of non-congregate shelter options, and the city should be
mindful of their needs when designing public space. Existing hostile architecture in Cambridge should be removed, and
no more should be installed. It is possible to meet the needs of our disabled and elderly neighbors (some of whom are
also unhoused) without actively creating a hostile environment for one of our most vulnerable populations.
Best,

Support for PO #5, ten-year infrastructure plan

Dear Mayor and City Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in support of PO #5, calling for the city to develop a ten-year
infrastructure plan. During debate about placing the new Eversource electrical substation away from residential
neighborhoods, we were dismayed to hear that the city has no long-term plans for the city’s growing electrical needs.
Alliance members, including myself, participated in the Envision planning process, and we are disappointed it did not
result in an overall infrastructure plan for the city. Perhaps Envision could be used in helping to develop such a plan,
which should describe the city’s "needs and plans for infrastructure, public safety, and public services.”
Such a plan would make sure our city never gets into the difficult situation of an urgent need to locate a major electrical
substation in an inappropriate residential area, and could also be helpful in budgeting.
We encourage all Councilors to support this policy order.
Sincerely,
Lee Farris, President

Charter Right 3

To Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and the Cambridge City Council:
Hi, my name is Tisya Mavuram and I'm a constituent living on Cambridge Street in Inman Square. I've lived in Cambridge
for a little over a year and a half.
I’m here today to urge the City of Cambridge to support Charter Right 3 and Councilor Zondervan’s amendment to that
policy order. Our unhoused community already suffers from lack of non-congregate shelter and resources every single
day, and taking away one of the few sheltered places available to safely rest - especially during a very cold winter
with an above average amount of snowfall - does nothing more than reinforce that harm. Hostile architecture is not just
cruel. During a pandemic in the dead of winter, it's a public health hazard that will endanger the lives of Cambridge's
unhoused population.
We hear the argument often that hostile architecture is not to deter unhoused people from congregating, but is actually
installed for the benefit of disabled and senior citizens. Unhoused people are statistically more likely to fall into both of
those categories, which Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor Nolan’s amendments notably do not address. Vice Mayor
Mallon’s amendment removes the ask to create design guidelines for future projects, the ask to remove existing hostile
architecture in the city, and the specific reference to Carl Barron Plaza which will soon be redesigned. Councilor Nolan’s
amendment shifts the balance of the order uncomfortably towards housed people. These amendments hide behind
legitimate concerns for the elderly and disabled communities in order to act against the interest of the most vulnerable
unhoused seniors and disabled people, and I'm writing to ask that the council reject these amendments in favor of
Councilor Zondervan's policy order. Members of the unhoused community have supported the specific asks in Councilor
Zondervan's policy order, and they should remain.
I am glad that the city has provided some services to the unhoused community already in the face of the pandemic,
including spending $10 million on supporting non-profits that work in and around housing justice. However, there is a
clear need for non-congregate shelter that would protect unhoused residents while adhering to public health guidelines,
which the city has spent $0 on thus far. Instead of spending Cambridge taxpayer funds to support shelter for unhoused
residents that does not meet public health guidelines, the city should have used federal FEMA funding over the past year
to support safe non-congregate shelter. Despite what was said in last week’s meeting, Spaulding is a congregate shelter,
and not a non-congregate one. What homeless community members have explicitly asked for are private spaces, and
Spaulding definitionally does not meet this demand. Thank you for your time.
Best,
Tisya

WHEREAS:

The City published a Commercial Land Use Classification Study in 2015, and the City
Council adopted a 2018 policy order asking the City to develop a timetable to update
the Table of Land Use to reflect recommendations from the 2015 study; and

WHEREAS:

By clarifying the definitions of certain uses, expanding or creating new uses to reflect
the changing face of retail, and removing onerous requirements, updating the table of
land use is a critical way the City can reduce the burden of starting or expanding a

WHEREAS:

At the July 30th, 2020 Economic Development and University Relations Committee
hearing, the Community Development Department (CDD) unveiled the proposed
Retail Uses Zoning Ordinance and heard feedback from committee members; and

WHEREAS:

CDD incorporated that feedback by making adjustments to the Retail Uses Zoning
Ordinance petition, and presenting a related Home Occupations Zoning Ordinance
petition at a follow-up Economic Development and University Relations Committee
hearing on September 30th, 2020; and

WHEREAS:

The Ordinance Committee was slated to discuss the Retail Uses Zoning Ordinance
petition and the Home Occupations Zoning Ordinance petition on December 17th,
2020, but the meeting was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions, causing the
petitions to expire before they could be ordained; and

WHEREAS:

Updating the Retail Table of Land Use has been a long, labor-intensive process, and as
the struggles of the small business community have only been exacerbated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that the City Council move forward with the refiling
of these petitions in an efficient and intentional way; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached proposed zoning amendments to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to
update the Retail Table of Land Use be referred to the Planning Board and Ordinance
Committee for hearing and report.

Parking Exemptions.

6.32.1 Small Business. The minimum amount of parking required by Subsection 6.36 Schedule of Parking and
Loading Requirements shall be waived for any nonresidential use in an office, business, or industrial district
if such use would require four (4) or fewer spaces. However, and such nonresidential use shall be is located
in a building or row of attached buildings which contains a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less
of gross floor area devoted to nonresidential use. Furthermore, for a new nonresidential use within a
building in existence on or before [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AMENDMENT], no new accessory parking shall
be required.
6.32.2 Institutions. Where an institution provides dormitory, fraternity, faculty, employee or other residence
accommodations, the number of parking spaces provided as a result thereof may be deducted from the
requirements established to satisfy the needs of classrooms, libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, similar
educational areas or dining facilities normally used by such residential occupants. In order to qualify for such
deduction, the institutional applicant shall submit to the Building Department the institution's current
residential parking plan clearly indicating the location of all existing and proposed residential parking
facilities available at the institution.

Cambridge Community Development Department – September 25, 2020

Explanatory note: This change
would exempt new uses in existing
buildings from having to either
construct new parking spaces or
seek relief from the Board of
Zoning Appeal if the change in
use affects the number of parking
spaces normally required. A
similar approach is already
employed in the Harvard Square
Overlay District and Central
Square Overlay District zoning.

to be one of the most frequent
reasons for new small businesses
to have to seek zoning relief.

10.43 Criteria. Special permits will normally be granted where specific provisions of this Ordinance are met,
except when particulars of the location or use, not generally true of the district or of the uses permitted in
it, would cause granting of such permit to be to the detriment of the public interest because:
(a)

It appears that requirements of this Ordinance cannot or will not be met, or

(b)

Traffic generated or patterns of access or egress would cause congestion, hazard, or substantial
change in established neighborhood character, or

(c)

The continued operation of or the development of adjacent uses as permitted in the Zoning Ordinance
would be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed use, or

(d)

Nuisance or hazard would be created to the detriment of the health, safety and/or welfare of the
occupant of the proposed use or the citizens of the City, or

(e)

For other reasons, the proposed use would impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district, or
otherwise derogate from the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and

(f)

The new use or building construction is inconsistent with the Urban Design Objectives set forth in
Section 19.30.

10.43.1 Conditional Retail or Consumer Service Establishments. Where a special permit is required for a Retail
or Consumer Service Establishment listed in Section 4.35 or 4.36 of this Zoning Ordinance, the special
permit granting authority shall consider the following factors when evaluating the criteria in Section
10.43:
(a) Anticipated delivery and loading operations, their potential impacts on neighboring uses and the
overall neighborhood, and the extent to which those impacts are mitigated;

Explanatory note: These criteria
would supplement the general
criteria in Section 10.43 when a
special permit is needed for a
retail establishment.

(b) The extent to which neighboring uses would be impacted by environmental nuisance such as dust,
fumes, odors, smoke, vapors, noise, vibration, flashing, light trespass, or glare, and the extent to
which those impacts are mitigated;
(c) The extent to which storefronts and other elements of the façade visible to the public are
compatible with the visual character of the surrounding area and conform to the City’s urban design
objectives for retail uses in the area; and
(d) The extent to which the establishment serves a public objective identified in citywide or
neighborhood plans that would offset potential adverse impacts.

changed from a use not included in the above list to a use included in the above list. In no case shall
Gross Floor Area devoted to a Municipal Service Facility or Other Government Facility be considered an
Incentive Project.

(b)

The physical design, including color and use of materials, of the establishment shall be

spaces and uses in the particular location;

(c)

The establishment fulfills a need for such a service in the neighborhood or in the city;

(d)

The establishment will attract patrons primarily from walk in trade as opposed to drive in or
automobile related trade; however, should the Board specifically find that the district or area

The establishment shall, to the greatest extent feasible, utilize biodegradable materials in
packaging the food and in the utensils and other items provided for consumption thereof;

following conditions will be met.
11.32.1

The new site shall be within five hundred (500) feet of the original site of the establishment.

documents or as those documents may be modified by the conditions of the Special Permit as
granted.
In granting a Special Permit under this Section 11.30 the Board shall specifically detail in its decision
the types of foods for which the Permit is granted and shall also identify those other aspects of the
establishment as outlined in the application documents for which alterations will require the issuance
of a new Special Permit.

permitted in the Residence C District shall be permitted as of right, provided the conditions set
forth below are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.31, no variance for use shall
be permitted in the Special District 10. For the purposes of Article 8.000 the Special District

Retail Zoning Petition – Supplemental Consistency Amendments
MARKUP VERSION

Overview: The proposed zoning amendments, which include definitions of Retail or Consumer Service Establishments in Article 2.000 and
amendments to the Table of Use Regulations in Section 4.30, result in the need to amend other sections of the Zoning Ordinance that may
contain outdated references to those Definitions or Sections. While any zoning amendment can have unintended outcomes, the changes
suggested in this document are intended to maintain consistency within the language of the Zoning Ordinance and minimize potential
substantive changes.

Explanatory note not to be included in zoning text: The amendments below mirror the proposed changes to the Table of Use Regulations in
Section 4.30. Where these changes result in the need to create new parking, loading, and bicycle parking requirements, or to amend existing
requirements, the proposed requirements are intended (a) to be consistent among uses that have similar trip-generation patterns, and (b) to
use Gross Floor Area as a standard rather than occupancy or other standards that are difficult to apply through zoning.

WHEREAS:

These cash assistance grants are a lifeline for low-income residents, but with a
maximum TADC grant of just $652 per month for a family of three, and a maximum

VICE MAYOR MALLON

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL
Alanna Mallon
Vice Mayor
To: Cambridge City Council
From: Alanna Mallon, Vice-Mayor
Date: February 3rd, 2021
Subject: Data Collection from Transportation Network Companies

To the Honorable, the City Council,
When I filed a policy order with former Councillor Kelley and former Vice-Mayor Devereux in 2019
asking the City to partner with a research institution to collect data on Transportation Network
Companies (TNCs), I hoped to better understand the impact ride hails are having on our community,
especially as it relates to transportation and sustainability. Now, over a year and a half later, we have not
come any closer to finding those answers, even though our pre-COVID, and certainly post-COVID
traffic levels and climate change vulnerability demand a sense of urgency.
TNCs, such as Uber and Lyft, were originally marketed as a way to decrease car ownership and thus get
more cars off the street and, yet 7,879,235 trips started in Cambridge in 2019 alone. That number has
grown by 16% since 2017, and does not account for rides that end or pass through Cambridge, nor time
drivers spend idling as they wait for their next pickup. With an average of 74.9 rides started per person in
Cambridge, our City has the highest per person ride count in the entire state. With such high rates of
ridership, it is clear that TNCs must have a considerable effect on our community, but we need specific
data to paint a fuller picture of their impact. Simply put, we cannot understand nor devise data-driven
ways to address TNCs without this critical information.
As communities across the world grapple with the impacts of climate change, the City has set several
goals to mitigate our impact on the environment, many surrounding sustainable transportation. Envision
Cambridge highlights “[achieving] a carbon neutral transportation system” as a major goal, yet TNCs
Packet Pg. 200

6.1

make it easier for residents to opt for private, single-rider car trips that emit considerable amounts of
greenhouse gases. If the nearly eight million TNC trips that start in Cambridge each year are hindering
our sustainability goals and threatening the health of both the environment and our residents, we should
understand by how much.
Similarly, mobility and access is an issue the City is working to address through a number of initiatives,
such as the Parking and Transportation Demand Management Ordinance. We cannot, however, develop
responsible, meaningful strategies to reduce congestion if we do not know how much congestion
originates from ride hailing. In San Francisco, ride hailing services increased traffic delays by 40%, and
while we may colloquially see countless Ubers and Lyfts in our squares during rush hour, we need
concrete numbers. More broadly, we must assess how the additional wear-and-tear of having so many
TNC trips on our streets impacts residents’ ability to efficiently travel in the City, and how the associated
road upkeep translates into additional costs to the City. As more residents opt for walking and bike riding
over taking public transportation during this pandemic, and as the City has set our Vision Zero goals, we
must also determine how TNCs impact the safety of our streets, especially for vulnerable road users.
The prevalence of TNCs is a complex, multi-faceted issue that must be considered holistically as we
begin to gather data. Some potential data points that could be collected include:
• What percentage of rush hour and off peak traffic do TNCs account for?
• How many TNC drivers operate in Cambridge each day and how many miles do TNC
drivers travel in Cambridge each year?
• How much time does the average TNC driver spend “deadheading” on Cambridge
streets each day?
• Are TNCs more prevalent in certain neighborhoods than others? Is there a relationship
between TNC use and the lack of availability of public transportation or separated bike
lanes in a neighborhood?
• How much carbon is released by TNCs in Cambridge each year? What percentage of
carbon released in Cambridge annually from cars originates from TNCs? How many
TNC drivers in Cambridge use electric vehicles?
• How often do TNC users choose “pool” options, rather than single rider options?
• How many crashes or incident reports originate from TNC trips each year in Cambridge?
As we, as a City Council and as a City, advocate for more sustainable modes of transportation that ease
traffic congestion, the continued prevalence of TNCs begs the question: what gaps do TNCs fill in our
transit infrastructure? With a lack of leadership at the state level to collect this data, the City must step up
to gather this information, and craft data-driven strategies to fill in those gaps while moving towards our
transportation and sustainability goals. If TNCs are hindering our progress towards achieving the City’s
goals, we cannot continue to leave them unchecked. I am hopeful that partnering with MIT to collect this
data will grant us a deeper understanding of the role TNCs play in our community, as it is difficult to
ascertain what mitigation policies could be implemented from data that has not yet been captured.
Thank you,

To the Honorable, the City Council,
As the Chair and appointed City Council member of the Family Policy Council (FPC), we wanted to
update you on some exciting work that is being undertaken around language access in Cambridge, which
we know is one of the greatest barriers facing many of our families whose first language is not English.
The Family Policy Council, officially known as the Coordinating Council for Children, Youth and
Families, is dedicated to developing policy and program recommendations aimed at ensuring all children,
teens, and their families have access to the resources they need to be successful, engaged residents who
are prepared for life in our community and in the world.
As you know, the richness of our vibrant community is due to the many residents who immigrated here
and chose Cambridge as their home, and whose primary language is not English. For many of our
residents, the lack of language access can act as a significant barrier to civic participation and can be
actively harmful to residents who may not know their rights, or other critically important information that
the City should be providing in multiple languages. Since the Fall of 2020, the Family Policy Council,
under the direction of FPC Executive Director Nancy Tauber, has been investigating ways to develop
City-wide supports and systems to ensure language justice and provide language access resources to
families and providers; and if appropriate, the Council will develop recommendations for
implementation.
The Family Policy Council has defined language justice as “the right everyone has to communicate, to
understand and to be understood in the language(s) in which they feel most comfortable.”
The Family Policy Council has convened a working group of members to lead the discovery process of
their 2020-2021 work plan. The working group has been gathering information, identifying needs, gaps,
and best practices, which will be used to shape the action and recommendations of the council. The
working group consists of the following members of the FPC and City Staff:

The working group has met three times and is in the “Discovery Phase,” which includes identifying
questions for residents, families, City, school, and community partners, determining how to collect
information (surveys, interviews, focus groups), learning from others, and understanding demographics to
develop recommendations for the Planning Phase. In addition, they have joined the Municipal Language
Access Network, which is a great resource for networking, as well as sharing information, solutions to
common problems, and best practice standards. Through this connection, they have interviewed Language

We had two presentations at this month’s Family Policy Council meeting; the first was from Jodie
Stanley, Human Rights Department Outreach and Education Coordinator, City of Greensboro, North
Carolina and the second was from Cliff Cook, Senior Planner Information Manager, City of Cambridge.
Cliff Cook’s presentation focused around current language access and gaps in Cambridge, and is part of
the “understanding demographics” charge from the working group. The presentation focused on the
demographics of the 36,917 Cambridge residents who speak a language other than English at home.
Additionally, there was demographic information on how many of our residents live in a “Linguistically
Isolated Household,” which is defined as one where no one 14 years or older speaks English very well.
There was also a detailed presentation with a demographic breakdown of residents with a hearing or
vision difficulty, by gender, age, race, geography, education, income, employment, and internet access.
Having this deep demographic data will help guide the work of the working group as they narrow their
focus on identifying urgent language access needs. The full presentation can be found here.
The presentation by Jodie Stanley in Greensboro, NC is part of the “learning from others” charge from the
working group. Greensboro, NC developed a language access plan in response to an audit by the Justice
Department because they were not in compliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. They
submitted their plan to the Department of Justice in 2010, and have employed a phased roll-out strategy to
address any concerns about budgetary impact. Jodie manages language access for the City, and they have
identified a liaison from each department who works with Jodie to coordinate and support language
access efforts, and training for multilingual and monolingual employees. Some of their meaningful
accomplishments have been as simple as using more infographics, improving customer service, and
providing more signage and language identification cards. To address equity issues, they have
implemented a Bilingual Pay Incentive program. Greensboro’s goal is to go from compliance to caring,
and Jodie provided us with valuable lessons from what they have learned.
These informative presentations and learning sessions, as well as the working group discovery process,
will help guide our work on the Family Policy Council to develop goals and policies around language
access in Cambridge. We will continue to update the City Council on our progress as we move closer to
May and potential policy proposals. Please do not hesitate to reach out anytime with questions or
concerns about this critical work that is being undertaken by the Family Policy Council and the working
group.

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, February 2nd, the School Committee had its last Regular Meeting. You can view the
agenda here. The Superintendent and his team provided an update on the Spring 2021 plan which
included a breakdown of student enrollment in each instructional mode (in-person or remote) for
March 1st, by school, grade, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability status. I highlighted
for my colleagues that there appear to be discrepancies in this enrollment data when you look at the
breakdown by race—particularly at the high school. Many factors contribute to each family’s choice
of instructional mode and we need to make sure that we are delivering the highest-quality education
for all of our scholars—whether they are learning in-person or remotely. We have to ensure that our
remote students are getting what they need, and additionally, we must hear students’ and families’
questions and concerns about attending school in person, so that we can address their needs and make
our safe in-person learning accessible to all of our scholars, as soon as we can.
A total of 640 CRLS students indicated that they would like to participate in in-person instruction
beginning March 1st. All 640 students will be able to attend in person. Of these 640 students, 449 are
in one of the identified prioritized cohort groups (Substantially Separate OSS Students, SEI Students,
T3, T2, Homeless Students, Housing Transition/Foster Care, Unaccompanied Youth, Grade 9,
Significant Social Emotional Issues, IEP or 504, Grade 12, Chronically Absent 2020-21) established
as an equity focus of the expansion plan. Two cohorts of 320 students will be developed and students
in each cohort will alternate being at the CRLS building for a 4-day week (Monday, Tuesday,

Thursday, and Friday) at a time. Students were notified of their in-person status on Friday, January
29th.
On Friday, January 29th, Principal Smith provided a report on the data of our existing Dual
Enrollment program at CRLS, in response to my Motion #20-309 from the December 15th Regular
Meeting. While waiting for this report, my Office has had many meetings with Member Fantini,
Assistant Superintendent Dr. Nicole Gittens, Lesley University, and DESE to explore partnership and
pathway opportunities to support our underrepresented students towards postsecondary success—
including receiving the state’s Early College Designation. While the pandemic has thrown a wrench
in many things, it is important that we move this work forward. I am very excited about all that we
are putting into motion on this front and look forward to sharing the progress with everyone in the
coming months.
The School Committee and CPS administration have begun planning for the FY22 School Budget,
with the overarching goal of all of our scholars recovering and thriving and a focus of understanding
and addressing scholars’ academic and social-emotional/mental health needs amid the COVID-19
pandemic. The School Committee is welcoming CPS community members to participate in our
upcoming meetings and share ideas on how CPS should allocate its resources:
•
•

10:00 AM – 12:00 PM | Saturday, February 6th | Community Meeting
3:00 PM – 4:00 PM | Wednesday, February 10th | Staff

Advanced registration (sign-up is open up to 30 minutes before the start of the meeting) will be
required, due to enhanced Zoom security needs following the “Zoom bombing” disruption at our last
Community Meeting on Thursday, January 28th.
There was no school on Wednesday, February 3rd so that staff were able to continue their planning
for the March 1st expansion of in-person learning. This school-based planning time has been critical
so that each school can develop solutions based on its specific student enrollment, staffing, and
building layout. Schools have been making good progress with their preparations, including the
finalizing of student and staff schedules, launching of school-based “infection control teams” to
focus on COVID-19 protocols, and sharing the best practices developed over the last few months to
support both remote and in-person learners.
Our upcoming meetings are as follows:
• Saturday, February 6th, 2021
o Community Budget Meeting #2 | 10:00 AM
▪ To discuss FY22 Budget Priorities with community members
•

Tuesday, February 9th, 2021
o Joint Roundtable with City Council | 6:00 PM
▪ To discuss FY22 Budget Priorities
o Special Meeting | 8:00 PM
▪ To discuss the Superintendent Search process

The following, excellent 8-page article, Coming to Terms with Climate Change’s Relentless,
Long-Term Fallout by Jonathan Shaw (Harvard Magazine November-December 2020),
scientifically summarizes our climate crisis and what is needed to slow down increasing longterm damage to the earth and life itself. It highlights the urgency for stronger action now.
Introductory summary statements:
“Even if we could become carbon-neutral tomorrow the climate will keep changing for
thousands of years, the ice sheets will keep melting, and the seas will continue to rise… [even if
we stabilize our temperature with a rise of ] 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the
resulting two-degree world is one that commits to long-term sea-level rise of 39 feet, around
the height of a four-story building.” Environmental specialists state they we should have started
responding 40 years ago. In other words, we have much to do in a relatively small time.
Article sections include:
o Highlights include:
o The CO2 Crisis
o The Pacing-and Political-Problem
o Making Green Affordable
o From Toothless Treaties to Adaptation and Amelioration
o Adapting to a Changed Climate
o Amelioration: Taking an “Awful Action”
o The Research Imperatives

Please read and share the article with colleagues.

Subject: follow up on charter right
Nancy (copy to Louie):
I am writing to follow up on my charter right related to 605 Concord Avenue, since I didn’t fully articulate why. I appreciate
the reply to the PO requesting an opinion. Below is the PO and why I believe the main question was not addressed:
In Response to PO #265 (2020)
ORDERED:

That the Council go on record as stating that all projects seeking a permit extension should be reminded
of the need to follow all regulations in place at the time of the request for an extension; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to review the granting of an extension for the 605
Concord Avenue project which appears counter to the City’s zoning code and confer with the relevant
departments on how many projects that had a permit prior to these changes could request an extension;
and be it further

Perez, Lori

City Manager Agenda item #14, which stated that the 7 affordable units in the proposal (15% affordable) stem from Article
11, section 11.203 of the ordinance, does not directly answer the question from PO #265; namely, shouldn’t all
developments and requests for special permits be required to follow all zoning at the time of the extension? The order
states that projects seeking extensions should be required to follow standards - inclusionary, environmental, and any
others - in place at the time of the extension. In the response it is asserted that it is legal to NOT ask for additional

There is also the question of whether granting three separate one year extensions is legal. The zoning code states that
permits expire except if construction doesn't start for good cause, how is it possible that extensionS are granted? And if
granted for longer than the initial two years of any permit, wouldn’t it make sense that multiple extensions are counter to
the intent of the our special permit ordinance guidelines which require construction to start within two years?
Could you point to the requirements for granting an extension? The citation to Cambridge zoning, as you noted, Article 10
on special permits (10.46) makes no mention of “extensions”, which may well mean that they should not be allowed at all.
In addition, the other citation you include is to MGL Ch. 40A Section 9 which is completely silent on the matter of
extensions. Chapter 9 references that special permits may be granted and explicitly limits them to three years, although it
does mention “good cause”. Good cause is not defined. And does the state code require granting extension for good
cause, and it certainly doesn’t seem that an extension would have to be granted under obsolete zoning regulations. The
concept of an “extension” as such doesn’t exist anywhere in state law; it is assumed that all permits are to be acted upon
as expeditiously as possible.
It would be good to have both these questions answered. How can we legally require adherence to existing zoning as of
the time of the request? And what is the basis of granting multiple extensions?
Thanks,
Patty

affordable units. The question the council asked is different: how can we ask for adherence to existing zoning? I would
have expected an answer to how we can require adherence – otherwise the permit is set in 2016 terms, which is more
than 4 years ago, and much has changed, including the fact that subsequent development in the area likely affects all
studies done of the impact.
