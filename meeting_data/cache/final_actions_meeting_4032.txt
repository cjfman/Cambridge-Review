PLANNING BOARD
CITY HALL ANNEX, 344 BROADWAY, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139

Date:

June 7,2022

Subject:

Craigg Kelley et. al. Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board makes the followingr, report with no positive or
negative recommendation.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On May 24, 2022, the Planning Board (the "Board") held a public hearing to discuss a Zoning
Petition by Craig Kelley, et. aL, to amend Article 4.000 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to
establish new use categories for "Shared Vehicle", "Publicly-accessible, Privately-owned
Electric Vehicle Charging System", and "Shared Mobility Device", with associated definitions
and additional limitations for the number of Shared Mobility Devices that may be located on a
property of less than 10,000 square feet (the "Petition").
The Board heard a presentation from Craig Kelley and received written materials prior to the
hearing from staff in the City's Community Development Department (CDD). Following the
presentation, public comment, and discussion among Board members, the Planning Board voted
to forward this report to the City Council without making a positive or negative
recommendation.

Board members supported the overall goal of the Petition to promote more innovative and
sustainable modes of transportation, and noted that the Petition raises awareness of the issues the
City will face in transitioning away from greenhouse gas-emitting vehicles. This goal is
consistent with the values of Envision Cambridge and other transportation planning goals of the
City. Further, Board members recognized that the interest in shared mobility will continue to
grow. Board members expressed enthusiastic support for the City to stidy these issues, with
input from appropriate transportation staff, and recommend comprehensive policy approaches in
a timely way.
However, with regard to the Petition, the Board concluded that these issues are not within the
purview of zoning and that a zoning amendment is not the appropriate way to address them.
Zoning is limited to regulating land use and does not regulate vehicles or the use of public
streets. Moreover, many aspects of the Petition would be unenforceable in practice, leading to
unpredictable outcomes. Board members agreed that the Petition would not be effective in
meeting its stated objectives.
The Board recommended that the report provided by CDD staff be provided to the Council along
with the Planning Board's report.

Definitions for the proposed use categories as well as "Electric vehicle" and "Shared Mobility Platform"
are included in the Petition.

Planning for Mobility
Envision Cambridge (2019)
The City's comprehensive plan, Envision Cambridge, establishes several policy goals related to
transportation, mobility, and sustainabiiity:
• Reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions
• Expand access to sustainable transportation choices and the physical reach of sustainable
transportation infrastructure
• Enhance existing sustainable transportation infrastructure to be more convenient/ reliable and
resilient
• Adjust land use policy to support sustainable transportation choices
* Establish new regulatory frameworks to prepare for tech-driven disruptions in mobility systems

New Mobility Planning
As an outgrowth of the Envision Cambridge process, the CEty began a technical research effort intended
to learn about and plan for New Mobility options in a way that aligns with and advances existing values

and policies. A technical advisory group was appointed to guide the New Mobility planning and to help
the City understand New Mobility from a market, technical, and poiicy perspective. The New Mobility
planning process did not change existing transportation pians or current priorities for active mobility,
except to strengthen sustainable transportation and shape strategies to support diverse transportation
options, including micromobility devices, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, ride-hail/ mlcrotransit/
Mobility as a Service, delivery, and more.

Kelley/ et al./ Zoning Petition - Memo to Planning Board
The New Mobility planning process completed a transportation trend analysis to understand conditions
leading up to the pandemic and performed projections of future mobility trends based on 2019 trends.
The process also included implementing a pilot to provide electric vehicle charging options for residents
who own electric vehicles, but do not have a private garage or driveway in which to charge their vehicle.
The Technical Advisory Group discussed desired outcomes for new mobility, and five potential strategies
related to curb management, mobility data, prioritization of space-efficient hlgh-occupancy modes,
automated vehicle deployment, and transportation electrification.
The City will conduct additional community engagement before further advancing this planning effort.

Shared Mobility Zoning Petition (2019)
The Planning Board previously discussed a zoning petition related to shared mobility in 2019. This
petition/ similar in scope, proposed adding definitions and regulations for a new land use category called
"Shared Mobility." At that time/ the Planning Board made no recommendation on the petition to City
Council and expressed concern that the language in the Petition would create conflicts with existing
provisions for Public Bicyde-Sharing. The Council did not take action on that petition.

Electric Vehicle Charging
CDD has devoted attention to how the city will need to adapt in order to adequately accommodate
increasing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging. Unlike fueling stations for automobiles that run on

petroleum, EV charging stations or "EVSE" (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) tend to be installed as
ancillary fixtures in parking lots and garages or on public property along the curb. EV charging is less
noxious or hazardous than petroleum fueling, and it tends to take a longer amount of time to recharge
than to refuel.
The City is currently taking steps to expand the EV charging network within the City. Beyond increasing
the number of City-owned public charging station locations, the City has worked with developers of
parking facilities subject to Planning Board Project Review Special Permits to provide a minimum of 25%
of new spaces to have EVSE, with infrastructure in place to make 100% of spaces ready for future EV
charging capabilities. The City also convened a working group which established a goal of significantly
increasing the number of publicly-avaiiable EV charging stations within the City.

Current Zoning for Shared Transportation Systems
Public Bicycle-Sharing
"Public Bicycle-Sharing Service" gnd "Public Bicycle-Sharing Station" are approved uses in all zoning
districts/ as a result of zoning amendments adopted by the City Council in 2011. The current regional
bicycle-sharing system is Bluebikes, which is owned by the respective municipalities in which it operates
(including Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, Brookline, and multiple others) and operated through
separate contractual arrangements with a private vendor. It is a publicly-owned system. The City s

Kelley/ et al., Zoning Petition - Memo to Planning Board
contract with the Bluebikes operator prohibits other, privately-owned bicyde-sharing services from
operating within the City.
Carsharing
The City Council adopted zoning amendments to enable carsharing services in 2016 (Section 6.24 of the
Zoning Ordinance). Carsharing programs - not to be confused with "ridesharing," which means
carpooling or "ride-hailing/" which refers to services such as Uber and Lyft - offer members access to a
fleet of automobiles that can be reserved for short periods of time using an online or app-based system.
These programs offer an alternative to car ownership for peopie who only need to use them
occasionally. Carsharing programs are typicaily operated as private ventures, uniike bikeshares such as
Sluebikes where the system is owned by the City.
Carsharing programs can generally fall into one of four categories:
1) Round-trip carsharing: payment for the hour, mile or both where users begin and end a trip in
the same iocatEon.

2) One-way/free-floating carsharing: users begin and end trips at different locations, and is more
often used for shorter trips/periods of time and rental fees are charged on a time-basis (e.g./

$/minute).
3) Peer-to-peer carsharing: privately-owned vehicles are made avaiiable for rent by others for a
certain period of time, and the vehicle fleet is a virtual fleet made up of vehicles from
participating owners. This is not currently permitted in Cambridge because per Cambridge
zoning/ all vehicles must be owned by the Carsharing Organization.
4) Fractional ownership: users co-own a vehicle and share its cost and use (this is not currently

regulated by zoning in Cambridge).
State law permits vehicles that are part of a carsharing fleet to display plates issued by the RMV and to
operate on public streets. The provisions in Section 6.24 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow
properly registered carsharing vehicles to be parked within different types of off-street parking facilities,
with iimitations.

Considerations for Proposed Zoning

Shared Vehicles
The Petition defines a "Shared Vehicle as a privately-owned vehicle that is licensed and registered for
operation on pubiic and private highways, roads, and streets that is available, for free or through a
financial transaction/to members of the general public through a shared mobility platform." It is distinct
from the proposed definition of "Shared Mobiiity Device," which only includes transportation devices
that are not legal to operate on public highways. However, the definition suggests that a Shared

Mobility Platform/' defined as "An entity with a distributed fleet of Shared Mobility Devices/ either
owned by or made availabie through the Platform, that charges a use-based fee related to a specific
device or for which the Platform provides services based on membership/' would appiy to both "Shared
Vehicles" and "Shared Mobility Devices/' The following are some issues raised by this approach:

Packet Pg. 33

Kelley, et al./ Zoning Petition - Memo to Planning Board
• Differentiation from Carsharine - The proposed definition specifies that a Shared Vehicle would not
include a Carsharing Vehicle as regulated in Section 6.24 of the Zoning Ordinance. However, the
definitions of Shared Vehicle and Carsharing Vehicle are very similar/ as are the definitions of Shared
Mobility Platform and Carsharing Organization. In many real-life cases, it could be difficult to
distinguish between the two. Also, it would be difficult to identify, regulate and enforce the use of
Carsharing Vehicles.
• Regulation of Vehicles as a Land Use - While "Shared Vehicle" isa defined term, its inclusion as an
allowed use in all zoning districts except Open Space districts Is not specific as to what exactly is
allowed. The existing Carsharing regulations in Section 6.24 clarify how parking facilities (as a
principal or accessory use) can be used for Carsharing/ but no such regulations are proposed for
Shared Vehicles. Also, it is not clear if there would be dimensional requirements for the use of
Shared Vehicles, Instead, the proposed zoning treats a Shared Vehicle as a principal land use, which
is conceptually difficult to regulate and enforce because vehicles are not "attached" to land in the
same the way as buildings or parking lots. Because no process of registering Shared Vehicles is
proposed/ there would be no way to enforce where Shared Vehicles are located at any given time or
how they are used/ by whom/ and whether there are any restrictions or regulations related to such
use.

Understanding the intent of the proposed zoning relative to the existing zoning for Carsharing would
help to determine whether it would be better to create a new defined activity in the Zoning Ordinance
and/or whether the current regulations should be amended.
Publidy-accessible, Pnvately-owned Etectric Vehicle Charging Systems
The Petition suggests that both an EVSE system and "its attendant parking spot located on privately
owned property" would be allowed to be made available, "for free or through a financial transaction, to
members of the general public for the sole purpose of charging an electric vehicle." Allowing privatelyowned EV charging to be made available for use by others raises some important issues;
• Parking Regulations - Because the Petition proposes to allow both EV5E and parking to be made
more broadly available, it may conflict with other parking regulations in the Zoning Ordinance, the
Parking and Transportation Demand Management (PTDM) Ordinance, and the Commercial Parking
Ordinance and associated "parking freeze" which sets an EPA-mandated cap on the total number of
commercial parking spaces in the City. CDD is undertaking a study of these regulations to consider
changes to meet current transportation goals/ including EV charging and other mobility issues. This
study is focusing on issues such as social equity and accessibility.
• Transportation Impacts - Even if it is permissible, making EVSE and parking spaces available to the
general public could have transportation impacts. For example, if residential property owners have
the ability to lease parking spaces to commuters with EVs, it could increase traffic in residential
neighborhoods and throughout the City in general if it encourages more EV-owning commuters to
drive. Though the Petition specifies that it could only be available "for the sole purpose of charging
an electric vehicle," it is not clear how that standard would be monitored and enforced/ especially
since there is no proposed requirement to register the use with the City.

Kelley/ et al./ Zoning Petition - Memo to Planning Board
• Utility Franchise Laws - Chapter 164 of Massachusetts General Laws establishes regulations for the
provision of electric distribution and services to retail customers by qualifying companies, and
generally prohibits the resale of electricity from private individuals to others. There could be a
potential impediment if property owners wish to impose a fee for EV charging.

Shared Mobility Devices
The Petition would allow a "Shared Mobility Device/ defined to include a "scooter/ bicycle, or other
transportation device that is not legal to operate on public highways/' to be made available in a manner
similar to current rules for Carsharing. A "member or customer" would use a "self-service automated
registration system" to use a device, but not enter into a separate agreement for each use (as would be
the case with, for example, a more traditional bicycle rental). The devices would need to be "owned,
maintained or operated by, and made available through/ a Shared Mobility Platform."

The only proposed limitations are that in Residence districts/ up to four Shared Mobility Devices would
be allowed on a "Property" (i.e., a lot) of less than 10,000 square feet at a time, and in Open Space
districts, they would not be permitted. The Petition does not propose any dimensional or operational
standards or address issues that may arise by not defining appropriate standards. As a matter of zoning,
this would only permit a Shared Mobility Device on an off-street lot, because the operation of vehicles
on the street is not regulated by zoning.
This proposal would raise some similar issues to those raised for Shared Vehicles above, as well as the
issues raised during review of the 2019 Shared Mobility zoning petition. The following is a summary of
key issues:
• First/ it is not clear that all Shared Mobility Devices would be "not legal to operate on public
highways; e.g., bicycles and motorized scooters could be legal on public highways during daylight
hours. This should be researched before inserting into the Zoning Ordinance.
• Potential for Conflict - Similar to "Shared Vehicle," it may be difficult to distinguish a Shared
Mobility Device" from the Public Bicycle-Sharing definitions currently in the Zoning Ordinance. Also,
as noted further above/ the City's current Public Bicycle Sharing System (Bluebikes) contractually
prohibits the City from allowing private bicycle sharing services to operate on City streets.
• State Law - Currently, the State does not have any statutes specifically in place for electric scooters.
Instead, Chapter 90 Section IE of the General Laws of MA apply to "motorized scooters/ under
which today's electric scooters are regulated in the absence of regulations that explicitly authorize
them. Requirements for motorized scooters include turn signals, brake lights/ daytime-oniy
operation, and operation by a licensed driver.
• Cambridge Traffic Regulations - Once the state law is changed to authorize the use of electric
micromobility devices, the City will also need to update its traffic regulations to address these
devices. If the proposed zoning change made them permissible on off-street lots/ City resources may
still be required in enforcement to ensure that Shared Mobility Devices are not operated or left on
sidewalks or in prohibited areas of the public way.

Kelley, et al., Zoning Petition ~ Memo to Pianning Board
• Policy Framework for Micromobility - As discussed earlier in this memo, the City is engaged in

ongoing planning efforts (both locally and regionally) to introduce or expand the permitted use of
micromobility devices, such as electric scooters, on public streets. By simply allowing "Shared
Mobility Devices" in zoning/ with few restrictions, the Petition proposes a "hands-off policy
approach by allowing any businesses to make Shared Mobility Devices available from wherever in

the City they are able to secure land. This approach could make it difficult to pursue other policy
options/ such as licensing one or more operators through a procurement process to operate under a
more weli-defined regulatory system/ or instituting a pubticly-owned system with a single provider,
as with Bluebikes. City staff are continuing to explore different options En coordination with other
regional entities/ which is crucial because any micromobiiity system will need to operate across
municipaiities to be effective.

Conclusions
As articulated in the Envision Cambridge report, it will be important to support innovations En
transportation that will advance the City's climate goals.
A common issue among the three different parts of the Petition is the limited effectiveness of zoning En
regulating transportation systems. As a land use regulation, the Zoning Ordinance does not say what
types of vehicles may use public streets or how they can be fueled. Zoning requirements for new

mobility systems will have a limited effect without a larger policy framework for how those systems will
operate^ both at the state and iocai level.
With regard to transportation/ the primary effect of zoning is to regulate where and how different types
of vehicles may be parked in off-street lots. It might seem reasonable to be more permissive in order to
promote more climate-friendly technologies, but there could be broader land use implications related to
traffic and congestion, which can have climate impacts as well.
In the case of Public Bicycle Sharing, the City adopted zoning only after the policy framework was

established for what is now the Bluebikes system. The effect of the zoning was simply to allow stations
to be sited in off-street iocations as a supplement to on-street locations. In the case of carsharing, the
City adopted zoning that used terminology defined in state law, and only after studying the topic and
conducting community outreach to weigh the pros and cons of carsharing systems. The effect of that
zoning was to permit carsharing vehicles to be parked in a range of different off-street facilities across
the city, but with iimitations in response to community concerns.
Similarly, staff believes that the best way to enable innovative transportation solutions is to begin with a
holistic view of the issue/ understanding all of the policy considerations/ and then determine what
zoning interventions (along with other policies) are necessary to advance the desired outcomes.

Subject:

Emissions Accounting Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board RECOMMENDS ADOPTION, with additional
comments.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On March 29, 2022, the Planning Board
Petition by the City Council to amend Article 22.000 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to
require applicants of most Green Building Projects to provide, as part of their compliance with
the Net Zero Narrative in Section 22.25.1(c)2, an accounting of greenhouse gas emissions
generated by construction, expected annual emissions generated by routine building operations,
lifetime expected emissions until the year 2050, and total expected emissions
.
This accounting would be estimated and provided for informational purposes only. As proposed,
the requirements would not apply to any residential buildings that include affordable units, and
the Petition identifies specific types of emissions that shall and shall not be included in each of
these calculations. The Board heard a presentation from Councillor Zondervan and Councillor
Carlone
Community Development Department (CDD).
Following the presentation, public comment, and discussion among Board members, the
Planning Board voted to transmit a favorable recommendation on this Petition to the City
Council, with some additional comments.
Board members agreed that it is important for developers and designers to think about
greenhouse gas emissions at the early stages of a project, and it will be helpful to make
projections of greenhouse gas emissions available to the Planning Board and the public during a
. Board members also remarked that there is a relatively new awareness of
, which has been identified through
emissions that should be studied.
The Board offered the following additional comments:
Most Planning Board members agreed that because the intent of the Petition is to provide
accurate information at the early design stage, it would be preferable to make the
requirement applicable to all projects subject to Green Building Requirements, instead of
excluding certain residential developments.

Most Planning Board members also agreed that for the information to be most useful, the
fullest possible accounting of greenhouse gas emissions should be undertaken, not
necessarily excluding features such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicle
infrastructure, and landscaping. Although such features may provide a positive
environmental benefit, the embodied emissions for the whole project should be included
net impacts.
Board members recommended that City staff provide a detailed review of the Petition text, and
suggest any modifications that would improve its clarity and application.
The Planning Board voted with seven members in favor of transmitting the above
recommendation. Two members were absent.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Introduction
Cambridge’s Cycling Safety Ordinance requires annual progress reports on improvements made
each year. Many deadlines and timelines set out in the Ordinance follow a “Separated Bike Lane
Year” from May 1 through April 30. This second annual report:
•
•
•

Details improvements made in Separated Bike Lane Year 2 (from May 1, 2021, to April 30,
2022).
Outlines the work planned for Separated Bike Lane Year 3 (from May 1, 2022, to April 30,
2023).
Counts mileage totals as indicated in the Cycling Safety Ordinance. Quick-build projects are
counted in the year when they are installed, and capital construction lanes are counted in
the year that construction starts.

Separated Bike Lane Construction Summary
•
•
•

In Year 1, we completed 4.12 miles of separated bike lanes.
In Year 2, we completed 2.11 miles of separated bike lanes and designed another .56 miles.
In Year 3, we plan to install the .56 miles of separated bike lanes designed in Year 2, and to
install or start construction on an additional 3.67 miles, for a total of 4.23 miles.

In Year 3, we also plan to start public engagement on the Hampshire Street corridor and to set up a
stakeholder working group for the Cambridge Street corridor. We do not anticipate installation of
either the Hampshire Street or Cambridge Street project during Year 3.

In 2019, the Cambridge City Council passed the Cycling Safety Ordinance. The Ordinance requires
the construction of separated bike lanes when streets that have been designated for greater
separation in the Bicycle Network Vision are being reconstructed as a part of the City’s Five-Year
Plan for Streets and Sidewalks.
In 2020, the Council passed amendments to the Cycling Safety Ordinance, setting ambitious
requirements for the installation of approximately 25 miles of separated bike lanes within the next
five to seven years. The location of these facilities will be informed by both the Cambridge Bicycle
Network Vision and specific requirements in the Ordinance.
In general, the amendments to the
Ordinance require the installation
of separated bike lanes on:
•

all of Massachusetts
Avenue

•

Broadway from Quincy
Street to Hampshire Street

•

Cambridge Street from
Oak Street to Second
Street

•

Hampshire Street from
Amory Street to Broadway

•

Garden Street, eastbound
from Huron Avenue to
Berkeley Street, and
westbound from Mason
Street to Huron Avenue

Streets that the Cycling Safety Ordinance requires the installation of
separated bike lanes on.

The Ordinance also requires 11.6
more miles of separated bike lanes
in other locations that are part of the Bicycle Network Vision.
The Ordinance distinguishes between quick-build and construction. Quick-build methods include
pavement markings, flex-posts, signage, and signal changes. Construction involves more extensive
changes, including potentially moving curbs and/or removing medians. Work becomes more
complex any time we dig into the ground, and construction projects may include work on the
infrastructure (e.g., water, drainage and sewer pipes, traffic signals) that we have underground.

Several projects were designed during Year 2 but were not installed by the April 30 deadline. We
expect to install these projects in 2022. See “Work Planned in Separated Bike Lane Year 3” for a
list of these projects.

MassAve4 Progress
In the Cycling Safety
Ordinance, sections of
Massachusetts Avenue
that have complicating
factors were identified and
are now referred to as
the “MassAve4” (see
adjacent map). These
complications are two
major bus stops in
Harvard Square
and two sections of the
street with overhead bus
wires.

MassAve4 Segments

The City completed an impacts analysis (as required in the Cycling Safety Ordinance) and
submitted the analysis to the City Council on April 30, 2021. Since the submission of this analysis,
the City has conducted further analysis and public engagement around the MassAve4. In April
2022, the City submitted a report to the City Council with recommended approaches and timelines
for the installation of separated bike lanes on these four segments. The full report can be found
here. The recommended projects are now included in the City's 5 Year Capital Plan, including $40
million for Harvard to Alewife Brook Parkway and $15 million for the Harvard Square bus stops.
In summary, the report recommends implementing bike lanes through:
•

Partial construction for the segments of Massachusetts Avenue with overhead MBTA bus
wires and median – the segment from Dudley Street to Beech Street and the segment from
Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street. “Partial construction” would remove the center
median except at key pedestrian crossing locations and install flex posts or curbed bike lane
separation.

•

Full construction for the Harvard Square bus stops – the segment of Massachusetts Avenue
from Church Street to Garden Street and the segment from Plympton Street to Dunster
Street. “Full construction” would allow for bike lanes to be raised to sidewalk level and for
bus stop islands to be placed next to the curb.

The following projects are planned for Year 3.

1.8

June 13, 2022
To the Honorable, the City Council:

Please find attached an order requesting the appropriation and authorization to borrow
$49,000,000 to provide additional funds for the construction of the Tobin Montessori and Vassal
Lane Upper Schools project located at 197 Vassal Lane.
When the appropriation of $237 million was approved in June 2020, coupled with the $13
million that had been previously appropriated, the estimated project cost totaled $250 million.
Since then, overall costs have increased due to significantly enhanced sustainability & resiliency
features, latent site conditions, supply chain shortages and higher than average construction
escalation within the public bidding domain. In addition, because of the pandemic the relocation
of the Tobin students was delayed by a year from the initial start date. The scheduled date for
project completion is the Fall of 2025, which has not changed.
The timing of this appropriation is in conjunction with the Construction Manager’s (Contractor)
Guaranteed Maximum Price which the City recently received based upon completion of final
bids. This agreement between the City and the Construction Manager (CM) ensures that we are
locked into our pricing and removed from further escalation costs. The CM has built in
construction contingencies and allowances for some common unknowns and assumptions
(excluding owner directed changes) and feels confident the facility can be delivered and open for
September 2025 occupancy. Delaying contracts in hopes for a reduced bidding climate is no
guarantee and would delay the project completion date due to the uncertainty this would create
and may also invite protests under Massachusetts bidding laws. While the increase over
estimated costs are large, it would be significantly more if we had used a traditional 149 bidding
process, because the entire project would not be bid until this time, subjecting the entire scope to
more escalation and market volatility. Due to the City’s use of the 149A process we were able to
start bidding components within early bid packages which allowed us to lock in lower pricing
earlier.

Packet Pg. 48

1.8

The following describes some of the major components that contribute to the increase in the cost
of the project. Within the past 24 months the construction industry, like many others, has seen a
drastic increase in escalation costs (8-10% per year or more) of materials and availability. Major
trade items such as exterior metal wall panels, roofing & flashing, waterproofing, electrical,
ductwork and millwork have all seen excessive increases due to product availability. Typically,
in past public bidding projects we would see overages and underruns that would roughly net out.
Trade bids coming in around budget have been outpaced by others coming in almost 50% over
budget. Due to the CM at Risk process, the project was able to utilize an early bid process for
structural steel, concrete foundation system and geothermal well drilling which resulted in bids
within our expected budget.
The City’s commitment to sustainability within the Tobin complex infrastructure is extremely
apparent. A steel trellis allowing for an edge to edge photovoltaic solar array on top of the roof
was recently added to further this commitment. Infrastructure for 100% electric vehicles, and a
closer look at materials in regards to their chemical makeup and resiliency highlight new
additions to the sustainability program for which these additional funds are necessary.
The Tobin School and Callanan Park was always known to be built upon an unregulated dump
site. With few suitable options within the City, the decision has been made to keep the school on
this site as it would be less costly than acquisition and remediation costs for anything similar in
size. Although the project captured a majority of soil remediation costs prior to start of
construction, these latent conditions have had cost impacts embedded within the bid packages. A
majority of the site has gone through a site stabilization process to address environmental,
structural and geotechnical concerns. Also, due to the geotechnical properties beneath the waste
and clay layer, some deep foundation systems have had to be modified. This has had an effect on
both the building and stormwater tank foundation costs.
In addition to the cost of actual construction bids, there have been some increases in consultants
and Construction Management fees. The existing building and site have many environmental and
geotechnical conditions that have needed to be under constant supervision through our Licensed
Site Professional (LSP). From oversight of abatement, subsurface investigation, monitoring
construction site conditions & oversight for soil stabilization, these tasks were unquantifiable
until bid time when means & methods were approved. In addition to those tasks, our LSP also
coordinates our updates with state and federal agencies such as the EPA and MassDEP. The CM
at Risk process is based on the CM receiving a fee of construction costs. With the higher values
across the board this fee has meant an increase in insurances, bonds and in some cases the need
for additional on-site supervision.
In many of these instances the City team is working closely with the Designers and Contractors
to develop possible value engineering goals which alters the scope of the project. However
typically the City will not see a true dollar for dollar return on alterations and changes after
bidding. Furthermore, the ultimate goal is to provide the building and exterior park with the
design intent which has been committed to the many stakeholders during an extensive process.
This goal is consistent with the commitment to provide a facility that meets the education and
programmatic needs of both the City and School communities.

Packet Pg. 49

1.8

The Tobin Montessori & Vassal Lane Upper Schools project is a significant undertaking. As a
summary this project encompasses a new 359,100 square foot building with underground
parking garage that will house the Tobin Montessori School, Vassal Lane Upper School and the
Department of Human Service Programs Preschool and After School Programs, Special Start,
and full-immersion Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) programs. It includes a full 539-seat
auditorium that will serve as a City-wide resource, a cafeteria that can serve both Schools and the
ASD program simultaneously with audiovisual support for special events. It has two
gymnasiums that can be accessed after hours. The project includes a professional development
room for teacher education that can also be used as a multipurpose room. Other educational
features include learning centers for each School and a life skills room for the Vassal Lane Upper
School. Project site improvements include renovations and upgrades to Father Callanan Park
which will enhance protected and recreational open space, providing a variety of age-appropriate
play areas, multi-purpose fields, and public access to bike and community paths. Site
improvements include an increase in the quantity of trees and tree canopy over time Project
infrastructure improvements include mitigating potential future street flooding with construction
of an on-site 1.25-million-gallon underground storm water tank, together with storm water
bioswales. The design reflects and supports the City’s high standards for educational success and
will meet its aspirations for being the most sustainable and energy efficient school building in the
City of Cambridge and is designed to be Net Zero Emissions under the City of Cambridge’s Net
Zero Action Plan and includes the City’s largest photovoltaic array to date. This complex facility
will be one of the signature buildings in the City’s portfolio of sustainability and resilience,
including sustainable landscape, healthy materials, enhanced ventilation, and advanced daylight
harvesting.
These additional costs were unforeseen and are based upon the current construction climate.
Fortunately, the City has the flexibility to adjust for this appropriation, which if approved will be
included in its current bonding schedule in the out years, and meets the commitment the City has
made to the community
Therefore, I strongly recommend the approval of this recommendation so that the project can
move forward on schedule so that students can move into the building in September of 2025.

Transportation Joseph Barr and Police Commissioner Christine Elow report the following.
Staff from TP+T and CPD reviewed the crash history at this location and found that there was
one reported crash within the last three years (the typical period over which crash histories are
reviewed), which is the rollover crash that was referenced in the original policy order. The driver
of the vehicle that rolled over reported that they steered their vehicle to avoid hitting an animal in
the roadway, which led to them crashing into multiple parked vehicles and then rolling over their
vehicle. The occupants of the vehicle that rolled over were transported to the hospital for
treatment of minor injuries and several other vehicles were damaged, but no serious injuries were
associated with the crash.
The circumstances of this crash were somewhat unique and hard to prevent, and also appear
unlikely to recur on a frequent basis. However, in reviewing the crosswalk at this location, we
did identify two safety improvements that we intend to implement this summer:
•
•

Restrict one parking space on Broadway on the northeast corner of the intersection, to
improve the visibility of pedestrians waiting to cross Broadway.
Add pedestrian crossing warning signs on the left side of Broadway in both directions, to
better mark the crosswalks on Broadway.

We will also continue to consider potential safety improvements at this location, particularly as
we look at the installation of separated bicycle lanes in the future, as required under the City’s
Cycling Safety Ordinance.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am pleased to be writing to recommend that the City Council approve an Order to take by a socalled “friendly” eminent domain proceeding a 3-story office building comprising approximately
25,385 square feet (30,227 square feet with usable basement space) on a 0.23 acre lot located at
689 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 (the “Property”), which is presently owned
by the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, Inc. (the “UUSC”), a nonprofit, charitable
service corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Pursuant to Section 30 of Chapter 43, Section 14 of Chapter 40, and Chapter 79
of the General Laws, all as amended, the Cambridge City Council is authorized to take in fee in
the name of the City for any municipal purpose any land within the limits of the City not already
appropriated for public use. I recommend that the City Council take the above referenced parcel
of land by eminent domain for the purpose of creating municipal office space and all uses
accessory thereto.
Background
Last calendar year, the UUSC began the process of professionally marketing this Property,
resulting in three rounds of bidding. The third round of bidding included a requirement that the
UUSC would remain as a tenant on the third floor of the building at the Property for five years
with an option to continue its tenancy for an additional five years. After the City approached the
UUSC about its interest in the possible acquisition of the Property, the UUSC indicated to City
officials that the UUSC had decided that the City of Cambridge’s potential acquisition of the
Property for municipal office uses would further their mission of community involvement and
decided further that the City’s office use of the Property would be beneficial to Central Square.
City officials informed the City Council in March 2022 in Executive session of this opportunity
and stated that the City Manager would bring forward a recommendation to the Council if
negotiations with UUSC to take the Property in a friendly eminent domain taking were
successful.

Packet Pg. 54

1.10

The cost to the City to acquire the Property in this friendly taking is $14,500,000, which is less
than the initially estimated cost. The final net cost to the City includes the proposal for the
UUSC to make the payment for the initial five year lease up front, which will be deducted from
the purchase price, so the final cost to the City will be $13,763,557. I will therefore be seeking an
appropriation in that amount for that purpose. In addition, there is another appropriation request I
am making to provide $2.75 million in funds for building fit-out as the City develops its plans to
occupy the office space at the Property for City departments. One use that I intend for this office
space will be to house the new Community Safety Department, which was included in the
Adopted FY23 Budget.
Overall, the purchase of this Property will allow the City to adequately provide office space for
employees and the programs they service. The City has expanded its workforce significantly
over the past several years with no increase in space for additional employees. A total of 150
new staff positions have been added since Fiscal Year 2018. The City’s lack of office space is a
serious problem which will still exist after the acquisition of this Property, even with the
possibility of the City’s adoption of a new hybrid work policy. With the purchase of this
Property, the City can begin to address this problem. In addition, the proximity of this Property
to City Hall and transit lines makes it an ideal location and an opportunity which rarely presents
itself. The acquisition of this Property will allow the City to continue with its commitment to
meet the enhanced needs and programs for the City.
Process
The City’s assessed value of the Property for Fiscal Year 2022 is $10,210,900. This assessed
value reflects the value as of January 1, 2021. The valuation includes a taxable portion, which is
the first floor that has housed commercial tenants, and a tax-exempt portion on the second and
third floors of the building that house UUSC office space. This assessed value does not
represent the Property’s current fair market value, as the assessed values always look back in
time. The true indication of the current fair market value of this Property has been estimated by a
highly qualified appraiser retained by the City Solicitor. The appraiser, Steven R. Foster, MAI
of Lincoln Property Company, has determined that the fair market value of the Property at its
highest and best use, which is characterized as commercial use, is $14,500,000. In addition to the
City Solicitor, the City’s Chief Assessor Gayle Willett has also reviewed Mr. Foster’s appraisal
in an additional examination to ensure that the appraised value represents the current market rate
value of the Property. Under the state’s laws pertaining to eminent domain takings, the City
would pay the pro tanto amount allowed by law to the UUSC. A pro tanto payment is an initial
payment that the property owner can accept without prejudice to its right to bring a claim for the
full amount of damages that it asserts is due.
Under the law, a property owner has the right to challenge the amount of the pro tanto payment
in a legal proceeding and could seek to persuade a court that it is entitled to the current fair
market value of the property. The eminent domain procedure allows the City to exceed the limits
that G.L. c.40, §14 and G.L. c.43, §30 impose on the purchase price of a property (which is the
average of the three prior years’ assessed value of the property plus a 25% increase) after an
owner of land taken by eminent domain has sought damages for the remainder of the fair market
value of the property.

Packet Pg. 55

1.10

The City intends, subject to the City Council’s approval, to pay the remainder of the agreed upon
purchase price of $2,212,349 through the settlement of the UUSC’s eminent domain damages
claim-this is why this type of transaction is referred to as a “friendly taking.” The UUSC has
agreed to a settlement of any such claim if the City Council votes to approve the appropriation of
the pro tanto, authorizes the taking of this property by eminent domain, and appropriates the full
amount of the agreed upon purchase price in order to settle the eminent domain damages claim.
As an overview, some of the steps in this process to satisfy legal requirements include:
1. The City has retained an appraiser, Steven R. Foster, MAI of Lincoln Property Company,
who performed and evaluated a required independent appraisal of the Property;
2. The City has received a First American Title Insurance Company Title Commitment
issued by one of the company’s agents, the law firm of Marsh, Moriarty, Ontell &
Golder, P.C., who performed a full title examination of the Property;
3. The City Council must vote to approve the Appropriation Order in the amount of
$11,551,208 in order to appropriate funds from Free Cash to pay the pro tanto, as set
forth above and below;
4. The City Council must, by a two-thirds vote, vote to approve the Order of Taking; and
5. The City Council must vote to approve the Appropriation Order in the amount of
$2,212,349 in order to appropriate funds from Free Cash to settle the eminent domain
damages claim and to pay the remainder of the purchase price of $14,500,000 after
subtracting the pre-paid five year initial lease payment of $736,443 which will enable the
City to acquire the Property and thereby resolve UUSC’s damages claim.
6. In addition, the City Council must appropriate $2,750,000 in funds from Free Cash to
develop plans, acquire the fit-out and furnishings and to undertake minor renovations for
City departments to use and occupy the building.
Requests for Appropriation
I am hereby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $11,551,208 from Free Cash to the
General Fund Law Department Travel and Training (Judgement and Damages) Account to cover
the pro tanto payment toward the expenses of acquisition as required by the above referenced
Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws for the property located at 689
Massachusetts Avenue owned by UUSC.
After the City Council votes on the Appropriation Order to fund the pro tanto payment and votes
by a two-third vote on the Order of Taking, I am also hereby requesting that the City Council
vote to approve the second Appropriation Order in order to appropriate funds in the amount of
$2,212,349 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel and Training
(Judgement and Damages) Account to fund the settlement of UUSC’s remaining eminent domain
damages claim. Lastly, I am hereby requesting that the City Council vote to approve the third
Appropriation Order to appropriate funds in the amount of $2,750,000 from Free Cash to
develop plans, acquire the fit-out and furnishings and to undertake minor renovations for City
departments to use and occupy the building for municipal office use.

I strongly recommend that the City Council approve this unique opportunity to acquire this
Property to address the City’s office space requirements and vote to approve the Orders of
Taking and for the Appropriation of funds.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of funds for a Drinking Water Supply Protection
(DWSP) Grant from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEA) in the
amount of $102,968.50 to the Public Investment Fund Water Department Extraordinary
Expenditures account.
These grant funds will be used to reimburse the Water Department for amounts spent to finance
the Twin Pond Land Acquisition Project which involved acquiring land for the City’s watershed
lands to be used for water supply protection and conservation purposes. As part of the project,
the City acquired two parcels of undeveloped land totaling 7.79 acres located in the Town of
Lincoln. The southern parcel is approximately 4.68 acres composed primarily of forested
wetlands and a stream to Twin Pond, an abutting eight-acre pond/emergent wetland to the east.
Twin Pond drains to the Stony Brook, a water supply tributary and main source of flow to the
Stony Brook Reservoir, the second of three in-series reservoirs supplying the City with drinking
water. The northern parcel is approximately 3.11 acres of upland composed primarily of white
pine forest with sparse understory.
On May 25, 2021, the City Council authorized the acquisition of the land in Lincoln MA, for the
purpose of adding to the City’s watershed lands for water supply protection and conservation
purposes. After securing contributions towards the purchase of this land from the Lincoln Rural
Land Foundation, the Town of Lincoln, and privately raised funds. As a condition of the
contributions by the private owners, the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation, the Town of Lincoln,
and the state grant, the property must be permanently protected by a conservation restriction as
provided by G.L.c.184, §§31-33.
At the time that I requested authorization from the City Council in May of 2021 for the
acquisition of the land, I also notified the Council that the City had applied to the state for a grant
to cover the City’s full acquisition cost for the land. However, after the acquisition was complete,
the State advised the City that the City will only be able to receive reimbursement of 50% of the
expenses incurred for this land acquisition.

Communicating information about the Charter Review Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
As you know, a ballot initiative passed in November of 2021 regarding the formation of a commission to
review Cambridge’s City Charter. I have introduced a policy order asking for the formation of an ad hoc
committee, composed of four City Councillors, to appoint members to the Charter Review Commission.
To ensure we have a candidate selection process that is balanced, there is a desire to have more than one
member of the City Council select self-nominated candidates for the Charter Review Commission.
Therefore, the committee will be composed of myself and three other members of the Council.
The Charter Review Commission will have between 10 and 15 members. No elected officials are
permitted to take part in this commission -- only registered voters in the City of Cambridge. Per the
passage of the ballot initiatives this past November, the Commission will review the Cambridge City
Charter, hold extensive community forums, and gather input from all stakeholders and residents, and
provide recommendations based on their findings to the City Council. Any proposed changes will be
reviewed by the City Council and any recommendations the City Council passes will be put before all
voters in a municipal election prior to adoption. The Charter Review Commission itself will represent the
diversity of the city.
Attributes Desired in Members of Commission:
• Experience working in a collaborative environment
• Understands the charter review process, ballot initiative, and goals of the commission
• Demonstrated service to the City of Cambridge

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
WHEREAS:

A number of residents have been reaching out to the City Council voicing increasing
concern regarding the summertime closure of Memorial Drive to vehicular traffic from
7 am Saturday mornings through 8 pm Sunday evenings; and

WHEREAS:

These residents have cited concerns around the significant traffic backups this has
created via new traffic congestion that is being redirected down Banks Street, Flagg
Street, Putnam Avenue, and other area side streets, and the fact that peoples’ access to
Memorial Drive remains closed overnight Saturday in spite of the fact that Riverbend
Park closes to pedestrians at 7pm on Saturday; and

WHEREAS:

Some residents have also cited concerns that those living in and around these side
streets will now have significantly longer commute times to area hospitals in the event
of medical emergencies during the weekend long blocking off of Memorial Drive; and

WHEREAS:

Residents in this area have urged the City to acknowledge the hardships these traffic
snarls have created, to recognize that closing Memorial Drive to traffic for the majority
of the weekend might have been acceptable during the height of the Covid-19
pandemic when fewer people were leaving their homes and driving, but that this is now
creating too heavy a burden on too many Cambridge residents; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Director of the Traffic,
Parking, and Transportation Department to limit the blocking off of Memorial Drive to
vehicular traffic to Sundays, and to report back on this matter to the City Council in a
timely manner.

FIRST IN COUNCIL
June 13, 2022

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR CARLONE
COUNCILLOR NOLAN
ORDERED: That the City Council amend the Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Cambridge entitled “SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT” to insert a new section 22.24.4
to read as follows:
22.24.4 Emissions Accounting.
The provisions in this section shall not apply to any residential
buildings that include affordable units.
All buildings subject to this section shall provide as part of their
compliance with section 22.25.1(c)2 a total greenhouse gas emissions
calculation as follows:
a)

Embodied Emissions: Estimated emissions generated by the
construction of the Green Building Project. The Embodied
Emissions shall be documented by a licensed engineer, using
Passive House or other acceptable energy and emissions
modeling software, and include:
1) Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used,
including associated raw materials extraction, production
and transportation, including all concrete, steel,
aluminum and glass.
2) Estimates for transportation emissions caused by
delivering the materials to the construction site.
3) Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such
as cranes.
The Embodied Emissions shall not include:
1) Emissions associated with installing renewable energy
facilities on site, including but not limited to solar PV
and solar hot water, air source and ground source heat
pumps, and any other systems that substantially reduce
the future emissions of the building.
2) Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual
transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.).
3) Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and
plants to the site.
4) Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle

supply equipment (EVSE).
Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an
accounting of the expected emissions to be generated by routine
operation of the building over the course of each calendar year.
Emissions will be calculated as metric tons of CO2 equivalent
using the estimated EUI (source and site EUI) for the building,
taking into account the anticipated local emissions profile for the
grid (ISO New England adjusted by the Massachusetts
Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS)) (source EUI) for
each year to convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into
emissions. The estimated EUI for the building shall include:
1) Expected onsite combustion such as a natural gas boiler
to heat the building for the expected lifetime of such
equipment.
2) Grid electricity for operating anticipated equipment and
lights in the building, including but not limited to HVAC
systems, elevators, and light fixtures.
3) Tenant/occupant plug loads and other tenant/occupant
contributions to EUI (site and source) that can reasonably
be estimated.
The estimated EUI for the building may be calculated by
subtracting from the total estimated energy consumption any
energy produced by onsite renewable energy systems such as
solar PV systems planned to be installed prior to occupancy that
net meter to the building itself.
The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include:
1) Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel
combustion (e.g. a natural gas appliance) that cannot be
reasonably anticipated.
2) Backup generators.
3) Transportation emissions associated with the building
operation.
4) Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the
building.
Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions
from the building will be calculated as the sum of the Expected
Annual Emissions from the year of first occupancy until 2050.
Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated
by the building will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and
the Lifetime Expected Emissions.
Reporting Standards. All emissions and energy use (EUI)
reporting shall follow the standards specified in Chapter 8.67 of
the Municipal Code (“Building Energy Use”) and associated
regulations, and shall be reported in Metric Tons of Carbon
Dioxide Equivalents (MTCO2e) for emissions and British
Thermal Unit (BTU) per square foot per year for EUI. The total
values for the building shall be summarized in the report using a
template tabular form to be provided by the City.

Brattle St. Parking Petition Birches_Larches.pdf

Dear Councillor Toner I'm sending the attached to you and your fellow councillors on behalf of concerned residents of 240-250 Brattle Street.
Thank you for your attentive review of our suggestions for assuring the safety of all who use this western stretch
between Fresh Pond Parkway and Mount Auburn Street.

Dear City Councilor:
The undersigned residents of The Larches (240 and 244 Brattle Street) and The Birches (246 and
250 Brattle) write to express our concern about proposed changes to vehicle parking outlined
at the May 3, 2022 Brattle Street Improvement Project Community Meeting.
While the proposed changes are intended as improvements, removing on-street parking from
our high-density block would compromise the health and safety of our residents (nearly half of
whom are elderly), of our visitors (including small children), and of our Larchwood neighbors
and children, who would be endangered by spillover traffic from our section of Brattle Street.
It’s in the spirit of the remark in the most recent issue of City View that “each project for
specific street or area will include a design process with opportunities for the community to be
heard and help shape the designs” that we offer our thoughts. We request that the Council add
flexibility to the Cycling Safety Ordinance to accommodate the following facts:
• The 790-foot stretch between Fresh Pond Parkway and Mount Auburn Street contrasts
sharply with other segments of Brattle Street, starting on Mason Street. This stretch includes
our two large, multi-family dwellings with 55 residents in 35 units sandwiched between
Mount Auburn Street and Brattle Street. While The Larches has limited garage space (15
vehicles not accommodated that rely on Brattle for parking), The Birches has none. Residents of
both The Larches and The Birches depend on Brattle Street to park their own vehicles and to
provide parking for our visitors, service providers (home health aides, ride services, and
cleaning help, in addition to plumbers, electricians, pest control, home renovation companies,
and the like), and delivery services (USPS, Amazon, et al.), as well as for emergency vehicles,
DPW trucks, and moving vans.
• Fully 47% of the units of The Birches and The Larches are occupied by residents aged 60 or
older (see Appendix A).
• With age come health and mobility issues—ongoing or inevitably occasional—that exacerbate
the need for nearby, accessible on-street parking. As noted in Appendix A, 12 of our residents
currently have mobility issues.
• Removing parking would force the cars that at current peak hours fill every available spot on
our block of Brattle Street into the adjoining Larchwood neighborhood. The influx of vehicle
parking now experienced there on street cleaning days would be a constant, in a neighborhood
already endangered by traffic cutting through from Fresh Pond Parkway.
• To run even the simplest errand, residents of The Birches and The Larches would need to hunt
for spaces on side streets and make multiple trips across Brattle—crossing two automobile
lanes and two-way bike traffic—with armfuls of packages or grocery bags. The ice and clogged
streets that come with wintry weather would multiply the risk to our health and safety.

We further take issue with the bicycle count cited at the May 3 Community Meeting. Our own
count (see Appendix B) shows 57% less bike usage on the western stretch of Brattle Street than
the number in the City’s presentation.
All of us support the public-policy objective of improving bicycle safety on Brattle Street.
Indeed, some of us are avid bicyclists who commute to work by bicycle, and many of us enjoy
recreational bicycling. However, that objective cannot be implemented at the expense of the
health and safety of senior citizens, children, and other vulnerable populations.
Pedestrians on our block (including those attracted to the beauty of Mount Auburn Cemetery)
already are endangered by cars speeding to and from Fresh Pond Parkway and Mount Auburn
Street. Speeding autos and reckless driving are a clear and present danger that has only gotten
worse as motorists have returned to the roads with the receding threat of Covid. Cars barrel
through the light at Brattle and the Parkway. Crosswalks are routinely ignored. Children are
endangered. Add to that the number of bicyclists who ride on the sidewalk, rather than the
street, as well as the growing presence of e-bikes and e-scooters (unregulated by the City),
which only increase the risk of collision.
The proposed erection of bike lanes with flimsy and unattractive plastic posts not only fails to
address but indeed exacerbates the very real safety issues—best addressed by traffic calming
measures—facing bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers on this unique stretch of Brattle
Street. We therefore ask that instead of implementing a “one-size-fits-all approach,” flexibility
and significant traffic calming measures be incorporated into the Cambridge Bike Plan.
We seek solutions that are informed by a fact-based evaluation of the expected benefits. What
current data is the City relying on for reported incidents between bicycles and cars on this short
stretch of Brattle Street? What is the documented nature of the problem that we are aiming to
address?
We ask the City to explore alternative solutions that would enhance the safety not only for
bicyclists but for all users of the western segment of Brattle—pedestrians and drivers, residents
and non-residents—including:
• Installing traffic-calming measures (e.g., signage and raised tables) to slow down vehicles that
now regularly ignore the speed limit in this stretch of the street.
• Increasing police surveillance and enforcement of speed limits during high-traffic periods
when bicycle traffic also is at its heaviest.
• Installing appropriate bicycle signage, including arrows on the street, to multiply awareness of
shared usage.
Such measures offer a win/win and emphasize safety for all persons, including bicyclists,
instead of ignoring the health and safety of seniors and other vulnerable populations in the

Cambridge City Council

Cambridge, MA 02139
Cambridge Community Development Department
344 Broadway
Cambridge, MA 02139
Petition on expanding off-leash hours at Hoyt Field
Hoyt Field Dog Group (HFDG) members respectfully petition the City Council and the
Community Development Department to approve expanded shared use off-leash hours
at Hoyt Field to include some time at the end of the traditional workday, in the late
afternoon and/or early evening. It is our hope that a new policy could be in place by the
fall.
The ASPCA reports that nearly 1 in 5 American households acquired a pet during the
pandemic. 53% of these adoptions are dogs. Hoyt Field has provided an excellent
resource for dog owners and could do even more without curtailing the many other
ways the Field serves our community. We request that the City approve shared use offleash hours in the evenings at Hoyt Field.
The Hoyt Field Dog Group is an informal association of over 100 Cambridge residents
who bring dogs to Hoyt Field for socialization and exercise. Hoyt Field is a uniquely
pleasant gathering place for dogs. It is a safe distance from the highway/highly trafficked
streets. The fenced area is large enough to accommodate many groups without
crowding, and its natural terrain is healthy for dogs underfoot. It is also well-lit in the
evening. No other designated dog space in the Cambridgeport area boasts these
advantages.
The HFDG members fully appreciate the special blessings that Hoyt Field provides and
strive to build a supportive and responsible community. In person and on social media,
group members share resources, mutually monitor dog waste pickup, exchange
recommendations, arrange care, check up on indisposed pets and owners, and
respectfully resolve disputes over dog interactions. In short, having Hoyt Field as a
unifying interest makes HFDG’s members and their dogs better citizens of Cambridge.
A well-exercised and socialized dog is generally a happy dog, and happy dogs are better
behaved. Central to the friendly and welcoming vibe at Hoyt Field is the ability of the
dogs to mingle freely and enjoy the neighborly company. These social interactions are
essential for healthy Cantabrigian families.

May 23, 2022

Packet Pg. 143

Both dogs and dog owners look forward to the designated off-leash morning hours,
from 6 AM - 9 AM. However, most dogs need vigorous exercise more than once a day. A
second late-day off-leash time at Hoyt Field would greatly enhance the contribution that
the space already makes to the well-being of the neighborhood.
We recognize that Hoyt Field serves a variety of users, including school groups,
neighborhood sports teams, and other casual players. So far, we have managed to share
the field satisfactorily. If newly granted evening hours were to conflict with a scheduled
activity, we would willingly defer to the needs of other organizations using the area.
However, Hoyt is not used for sports activities throughout the year. Especially in winter,
Hoyt Field could provide a well-lit, safe space for dogs and owners to gather after dark
without displacing other users. Regular evening use by a community of dogs and dog
owners would have the added benefit of deterring potential mischief.

Argument: Hoyt Field may sustain extra wear and tear from additional use.
Response:
1. The City has already generously consented to maintain and restore the field after
the morning use hours.
2. HFDG members are happy to cooperate with the City of Cambridge regarding the
upkeep of the field.

Argument: Extended off-leash hours may inconvenience people or other dogs who feel
threatened by unrestrained dogs.
Response:
1. There is no reported incidence of this occurring with any member of the Hoyt
Field Dog Group.
2. During designated shared use off-leash hours, HFDG members will respectfully
resolve any concerns and defer to the needs of other parties using the shared
recreational space.
We hope the City Council and Community Development Department will consider our
request. The Hoyt Field Dog group stands ready to cooperate with all stakeholders to
find a solution that maximizes benefits and minimizes inconvenience. Please contact our
Steering Committee if you have questions.
Thank you for your consideration.
Respectfully yours,
The Hoyt Field Dog Group Steering Committee

Public comment at 6/6/22 City Manager selection meeting

Thank you Councilors and Vice-Mayor Mallon for conducting a very open participatory process for the
profile development.
As one who cares deeply about equity and racial justice, I am here tonight to say that Cambridge
needs a City Manager who is not associated with the more than 50-year history of displacement and
gentrification that drove away working-class people who once lived here.
Cambridge will not benefit from a new City Manager who has strong ties to real estate developers.
Nor will it benefit from professionals who represent commercial interests that have been responsible
for gentrification and displacement of long-term Cambridge residents.
It is unfortunate that neither of the female finalists should be chosen for the above-stated reasons.
I speak as one who spent almost 25 years, beginning in 1987, organizing workshops for hundreds of
parents, teachers, and caregivers in order to center the voices and experiences of Cambridge’s multiracial and multi-ethnic families. Together with my associates in Early Childhood Connections – and
with teachers in the Cambridge Public Schools (CPS) – anti-racist curriculum was introduced and
celebrated. We delivered books to Cambridge’s early childhood programs and primary grade

City Council Health & Environment Commitee: Leaf-blower comment

Dear Councillors,
I'm writing to express my support for the proposed gas leaf blower ban. The noise and pollution produced by these tools
is unnecessary, harmful, and deleterious to our community's quality of life.
In addition to pollution problems, leaf blowers are often used to clear organic material from soil in such a fashion that
strips the area of naturally occurring compost and fertilizer, producing 'horticultural dead zones' where there is nothing
but bare soil - no plants, insects, fungi, or animals. This seems to be many large property owners' aesthetic of choice, but
the lack of plant life it produces increases the heat island effect and makes the city less pleasant to be in.
Furthermore, as someone who worked many years in jobs that require power equipment, I fully understand the labor
implications of this proposed ban. This will likely make it more costly and time-consuming to clear leaves, soil, and other
material, but I think that is the way it should be. We need to stop burning fossil fuels.
Please include this note in the meeting record.
Thanks,
Joseph Poirier

Voting in Cambridge Part 2--destroying the ballots
Ken Bennett DOJ Letter on AZ and Florida from AUDIT Attorneys May 14 2021 (2).docx;
edited_audit_guidance_508_1 (2).pdf

Last week I wrote to you, my local government officials with oversight over our elections, about internet voting. This
week I'd like to alert you about the fact that, because of a failure to understand how modern op-scan machines like ours
work, we are destroying the actual ballots that are counted and thereby violating federal law. I know from a discussion
several years ago with one of the election commissioners, who has since retired, that we do this because of a directive
from the Secretary of the Commonwealth, but that makes it no less a violation of federal law.
Cambridge uses the suggestively-named Dominion ImageCast and many other municipalities in Massachusetts use the
ES&S DS200. Both of these machines scan the ballots and then use the scanned ballots to count from, not the paper
ballot itself, as older machines did. Despite the fact that the images, not the actual paper ballots, are what get counted
and are therefore the actual ballots, the Secretary's office ordered that the images be deleted immediately, despite the
requirement under federal law that ballots be retained for 22 months.
John Brakey, a long-time election integrity activist and a specialist in ballot images and the related technology, provided
me with the attached information on federal law regarding what a ballot is and why ballot images from these types of
op-scan machines must therefore be retained. I admit that I did not press the issue with the Election Commission at the
time after I brought the matter to their attention, but now I am. I hope that you will take action, both because the law
requires it and because the ballot images could potentially be used in order to improve the administration of our
elections. Mr. Brakey has been working on having his home state of Arizona adopt a law to use the ballot images in a
way that is intended to increase election transparency and voters' and candidates' ability to accept that the results are
accurate. He is always willing to share his wealth of knowledge and information, so I hope that Cambridge will consider
following up with him.

Hi Ken,
this is a letter to the DOJ; I gave this to you on May 25. The reply came out in DOJ
publication on July 28, 2021 entitled Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election "Audits,
Bill Risner wrote July 29,
The U.S. Department of Justice publication on July 28, 2021 entitled Federal Law
Constraints on Post-Election "Audits," officially confirms that digital ballot images must
be retained pursuant to federal law. (52 USC 20701; Pub. L. 86-449, title III, sec.301,
May 6, 1960, 74 Stat. 88 )
Susan Pynchon wrote July 30th
Hi Team: Two great paragraphs in the July 28 Memo, in addition to clarifying that "any
record or paper" includes digital and electronic records (eg ballot images), the following
two paragraphs in the same Memo are also of interest:
1. Criminal penalties for failure to preserve:
"There are federal criminal penalties attached to willful failures to comply with the
retention and preservation requirements of the Civil Rights Act. First, Section 301 itself
makes it a federal crime for “[a]ny officer of election” or “custodian” of election records
to willfully fail to comply with the retention and preservation requirements. 52 U.S.C. §
20701. Second, Section 302 provides that any “person, whether or not an officer of
election or custodian, who willfully steals, destroys, conceals, mutilates, or alters any
record or paper” covered by Section 301’s retention and preservation requirement is
subject to federal criminal penalties. Id. § 20702. Violators of either section can face
fines of up to $1000 and imprisonment of up to one year for each violation."
2. Recourse for citizens if they believe a jurisdiction has violated record retention and
preservation requirements:
"If jurisdictions have questions about the constraints federal law places on the kinds of
post-election audits they can conduct, they should contact the Voting Section of the Civil
Rights Division. If citizens believe a jurisdiction has violated the Civil Rights Act’s
election record retention and preservation requirements, or believe they have been
subjected to intimidation, they can use the Civil Rights Division's online complaint
form to report their concerns or call (800) 253-3931."
John and I have people in Florida we can work with to mobilize hundreds of voters to fill
out the online complaint form. I'd like your opinions on doing that.

RE: Preservation of Election Records
Dear Ms. Karlan:
We are writing regarding issues you raised in your recent letter to
Arizona Senate President Karen Fann about concerns the Department
has about the security of election records with respect to the Arizona
Senate’s review of November’s presidential election in Maricopa County.
In the letter, you ask for an explanation of “the steps that the Arizona
Senate will take to ensure that violations of federal law do not occur”
during the exercise.
We would like to bring to your attention litigation that we brought on
behalf of the Florida Democratic Party, state legislators, and a bipartisan group of voters against Florida election officials for failure to
similarly protect critical election materials. The case is based, in part, on
the duty to preserve election records as required by the same federal
statute at issue in Arizona—52 USC § 20701.
Specifically, our lawsuit challenges the failure of several Florida election
officials to preserve the ballot images automatically created by the
digital scanners used to tabulate votes. When these digital scanners scan
a ballot they produce a photo of each ballot. The voting machine counts
the votes from the photo of the ballots rather than the paper ballots
themselves. These photos are referred to as “ballot images.” Ballot

images are a part of the chain-of-custody of each vote because they are
the true primary source of the vote.
Half of Florida’s counties already preserve ballot images for the
required 22 months. However, the remaining counties—including the 8
largest counties in the state—are destroying the ballot images during
the election.
Our case was filed in July 2020 in state court. We prevailed on a motion
to dismiss. However, defendants appealed on venue grounds, staying
the proceedings. Nonetheless, we were able to negotiate a temporary
agreement requiring defendants to preserve ballot images in the event
of a presidential recount. The case is currently before the Florida First
District Court of Appeals on the venue issue. We expect that issue to be
resolved favorably and the case to move forward soon.
We would like to request that the Department of Justice investigate the
principle federal issue raised in our case, i.e., the unlawful destruction of
ballot images automatically created by the voting equipment used in
Florida. This is a very important issue with national implications. Only
a handful of states are currently preserving ballot images. In most
states, election officials allow ballot images to be destroyed.
The use of ballot images provides an accurate means to inspect close or
controversial election results in a short period of time. Ballot images are
also critical when paper ballots are lost or destroyed during recounts as
has happened on a number of occasions in Florida and elsewhere. Not
only is preserving ballot images vitally important to bolster public
confidence in elections, allowing their destruction is clearly in violation
of 52 USC § 20701.
Thank you for your attention on this issue and for your vigilance in
pursuing compliance with federal election laws in Arizona and
elsewhere. We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
State Representative Joseph Geller

U.S. Department of Justice

The U.S. Department of Justice is committed to ensuring full compliance
with all federal laws regarding elections. This includes those provisions
of federal law that govern the retention and preservation of election
records or that prohibit intimidation of, or interference with, any
person’s right to vote or to serve as an election ofﬁcial.
The Department is also committed to ensuring that American elections are secure and reﬂect the choices
made on the ballots cast by eligible citizens. “The November 3rd election was the most secure in
American history,” according to a Joint Statement issued by federal and state ofﬁcials and released by
the federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency. In many jurisdictions, there were automatic
recounts or canvasses pursuant to state law due to the closeness of the election results. None of those
state law recounts produced evidence of either wrongdoing or mistakes that casts any doubt on the
outcome of the national election results.

In recent months, in a number of jurisdictions around the United States, an unusual second round of
examinations have been conducted or proposed. These examinations would look at certain ballots,
election records, and election systems used to conduct elections in 2020. These examinations,
sometimes referred to as “audits,” are governed, in the ﬁrst instance, by state law. In some
circumstances, the proposed examinations may comply with state law; in others, they will not. But
regardless of the relevant state law, federal law imposes additional constraints with which every
jurisdiction must comply. This document provides information about those federal constraints, which are
enforced by the Department of Justice.

Constraints Imposed by the Civil Rights Act of 1960

The Civil Rights Act of 1960, now codiﬁed at 52 U.S.C. §§ 20701-20706, governs certain “[f]ederal
election records.” Section 301 of the Act requires state and local election ofﬁcials to “retain and
preserve” all records relating to any “act requisite to voting” for twenty-two months after the conduct
of “any general, special, or primary election” at which citizens vote for “President, Vice President,
presidential elector, Member of the Senate, [or] Member of the House of Representatives,” 52 U.S.C. §
20701. The materials covered by Section 301 extend beyond “papers” to include other “records.”
Jurisdictions must therefore also retain and preserve records created in digital or electronic form.

The ultimate purpose of the Civil Rights Act’s preservation and retention requirements for federal
elections records is to “secure a more effective protection of the right to vote.” State of Ala. ex rel.
Gallion v. Rogers, 187 F. Supp. 848, 853 (M.D. Ala. 1960) (citing H.R. Rep. 956, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 7
(1959)), aff’d sub nom. Dinkens v. Attorney General, 285 F.2d 430 (5th Cir. 1961) (per curiam). The Act
protects the right to vote by ensuring that federal elections records remain available in a form that
allows for the Department to investigate and prosecute both civil and criminal elections matters under
federal law. The Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, Eighth Edition 2017 explains that “[t]he
detection, investigation, and proof of election crimes – and in many instances Voting Rights Act
violations –often depend[s] on documentation generated during the voter registration, voting,
tabulation, and election certiﬁcation processes.” Id. at 75. It provides that “all documents and records
that may be relevant to the detection or prosecution of federal civil rights or election crimes must be
maintained if the documents or records were generated in connection with an election that included
one or more federal candidates.” Id. at 78.

The Department interprets the Civil Rights Act to require that covered elections records “be retained
either physically by election ofﬁcials themselves, or under their direct administrative supervision.”
Federal Prosecution of Elections Offenses at 79. “This is because the document retention
requirements of this federal law place the retention and safekeeping duties squarely on the shoulders

of election ofﬁcers.” Id. If a state or local election authority designates some other individual or
organization to take custody of the election records covered by Section 301, then the Civil Rights Act

provides that the “duty to retain and preserve any record or paper so deposited shall devolve upon such
custodian.” 52 U.S.C. § 20701.

Therefore, if the original election ofﬁcial who has custody of records covered by the Act hands over
those election records to other ofﬁcials (for example, to legislators or other ofﬁceholders) or the ofﬁcial
turns over the records to private parties (such as companies that offer to conduct “forensic
examinations”), the Department interprets the Act to require that “administrative procedures be in
place giving election ofﬁcers ultimate management authority over the retention and security of those
election records, including the right to physically access” such records. Id. In other words, the
obligation to retain and preserve election records remains intact regardless of who has physical
possession of those records. Jurisdictions must ensure that if they conduct post-election ballot
examinations, they also continue to comply with the retention and preservation requirements of Section
301.

There are federal criminal penalties attached to willful failures to comply with the retention and
preservation requirements of the Civil Rights Act. First, Section 301 itself makes it a federal crime for
“[a]ny ofﬁcer of election” or “custodian” of election records to willfully fail to comply with the retention
and preservation requirements. 52 U.S.C. § 20701. Second, Section 302 provides that any “person,
whether or not an ofﬁcer of election or custodian, who willfully steals, destroys, conceals, mutilates, or
alters any record or paper” covered by Section 301’s retention and preservation requirement is subject
to federal criminal penalties. Id. § 20702. Violators of either section can face ﬁnes of up to $1000 and
imprisonment of up to one year for each violation.

Election audits are exceedingly rare. But the Department is concerned that some jurisdictions
conducting them may be using, or proposing to use, procedures that risk violating the Civil Rights Act.
The duty to retain and preserve election records necessarily requires that elections ofﬁcials maintain
the security and integrity of those records and their attendant chain of custody, so that a complete and

uncompromised record of federal elections can be reliably accessed and used in federal law
enforcement matters. Where election records leave the control of elections ofﬁcials, the systems for

maintaining the security, integrity and chain of custody of those records can easily be broken. Moreover,
where elections records are no longer under the control of elections ofﬁcials, this can lead to a
signiﬁcant risk of the records being lost, stolen, altered, compromised, or destroyed. This risk is
exacerbated if the election records are given to private actors who have neither experience nor expertise
in handling such records and who are unfamiliar with the obligations imposed by federal law.

Constraints Imposed by the Federal Laws Prohibiting Intimidation
Federal law prohibits intimidating voters or those attempting to vote. For example, Section 11(b) of the

Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides that “No person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall
intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for voting or
attempting to vote, or intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any
person for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote….” 52 U.S.C. § 10307(b). Similarly,
Section 12 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 makes it illegal for any person, “including an
election ofﬁcial,” to “knowingly and willfully intimidate[], threaten[], or coerce[], or attempt to intimidate,
threaten, or coerce, any person for . . . registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to register or vote” in
any election for federal ofﬁce. Id. § 20511(1)(A). Likewise, Section 131 of the Civil Rights Act of 1957
provides that “[n]o person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, threaten,
coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other person for the purpose of interfering with
the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose, or of causing such other person to vote
for, or not to vote for, any candidate” for federal ofﬁce. 52 U.S.C. § 10101(b).

The Attorney General is authorized to ﬁle a civil action seeking preventative relief, including a temporary
or permanent injunction, against any person who engages in actions that violate these statutes. See 52
U.S.C. §§ 10308(d); 20510(a). And there are criminal penalties as well. See, e.g., id. § 10308(a); 18 U.S.C. §§
241, 242, 594; see generally Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, at 33-38, 49-54, 56-58.

Judicial decisions have established that voter intimidation need not involve physical threats. In certain
contexts, suggesting to individuals that they will face adverse social or legal consequences from voting
can constitute an impermissible threat. Here are a few examples of the types of acts that may constitute
intimidation:

Sending a letter to foreign-born Latino registered voters warning them that “if they voted in
the upcoming election their personal information would be collected … and … could be
provided to organizations who are ‘against immigration’” was potentially intimidating. See
United States v. Nguyen, 673 F.3d 1259 (9th Cir. 2012).
▪

Having police ofﬁcers take down the license plate numbers of individuals attending voter
registration meetings contributed to intimidating prospective voters. See United States v.
McLeod, 385 F.2d 734 (5th Cir. 1967).

▪

Sending robocalls telling individuals that if they voted by mail, their personal information
would become part of a public database that could be used by police departments to track
down old warrants and credit card companies to collect outstanding debts could constitute
intimidation. See Nat’l Coal. on Black Civic Participation v. Wohl, 498 F. Supp. 3d 457 (S.D.N.Y.
2020).

▪

Linking individual voters to alleged illegalities in a way that might trigger harassment could
constitute intimidation. See League of United Latin Am. Citizens - Richmond Region Council

▪

Conducting a “ballot security” program in which defendants stand near Native American
voters discussing Native Americans who had been prosecuted for illegally voting, follow
voters out of the polling places, and record their license plate numbers might constitute
intimidation. See Daschle v. Thune, No. 4:04 Civ. 04177 (D.S.D. Nov. 1, 2004).

See also United States v. North Carolina Republican Party, No. 5:92-cv-00161 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 27, 1992)
(approving a consent decree in a case where the United States alleged that it violated Section 11(b) to

There have been reports, with respect to some of the post-2020 ballot examinations, of proposals to
contact individuals face to face to see whether the individuals were qualiﬁed voters who had
actually voted. See, e.g., Cyber Ninjas Statement of Work ¶ 5.1 (proposing to select three precincts
in a large urban county to collect information from individuals through “a combination of phone calls
and physical canvassing”).

This sort of activity raises concerns regarding potential intimidation of voters. For example, when
such investigative efforts are directed, or are perceived to be directed, at minority voters or minority
communities, they can have a signiﬁcant intimidating effect on qualiﬁed voters that can deter them
from seeking to vote in the future. Jurisdictions that authorize or conduct audits must ensure that
the way those reviews are conducted has neither the purpose nor the effect of dissuading qualiﬁed
citizens from participating in the electoral process. If they do not, the Department will act to ensure
that all eligible citizens feel safe in exercising their right to register and cast a ballot in future
elections.

If jurisdictions have questions about the constraints federal law places on the kinds of post-election
audits they can conduct, they should contact the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division. If
citizens believe a jurisdiction has violated the Civil Rights Act’s election record retention and
preservation requirements, or believe they have been subjected to intimidation, they can use the

Proposal for Extended off leash dog hours at Hoyt Field

To the City Council,
I write in strong support of the petition to extend off leash dog hours at Hoyt Field, so that dogs can play there during
after work hours. I am part of a group of over 100 dog owners who use Hoyt Field regularly during the morning off leash
hours. We are a community committed to responsible dog ownership. We self-monitor to make sure that dogs are wellsocialized and that owners take full responsibility not only for picking up after their dogs but also for socializing their
dogs properly. If granted the extended hours that we are requesting, we will continue to exercise vigilance to make sure
that we do not interfere with others’ enjoyment of the field.
Thank you.

Enforcement of truck ban on Putnam Ave

Dear Councillors and cc Commissioner Elow and Director Barr,
I live near Magazine and Putnam, and walk and bike along Putnam and around Cambridgeport every day. I have
previously voiced concerns about truck driving along Putnam and reckless driving around Cambridgeport, and was
grateful to receive responses from Councillors Mallon and Nolan. Thank you for working with Director Barr and
Commissioner Elow to have Safety Zone 20 MPH signs and radar "speed trailers" installed. I was glad to see the trailers
back in action this spring.
While appreciated, I do not believe these measures have had any material reduction in truck driving along Putnam and
reckless driving around Cambridgeport. I still observe trucks of all sizes along Putnam, including 53-foot semi-trailers.
Even if a few of these trucks have legitimate local deliveries, I would like us to try and limit vehicle size and weight on
our residential streets.
I am bothering to write about this again after hearing the ghastly news out of Chicago about Lily Grace Shambrook. I
won't describe the horrific details here, but they caused me to recall Jie Zhao, who was killed by a truck driver on
Putnam in 2018. And, suddenly, I recall a woman and her stroller, forced to retreat out of the crosswalk last year when a
30+ ft truck couldn't make the turn onto Putnam at Magazine. I recall the two trucks on Putnam a few weeks ago, who
blocked the road for 10 minutes as they tried to squeeze past each other. I recall my own contentious, dangerous, and
nerve-wracking experiences with truck drivers along Putnam and around Cambridge.
Since last year, has there been any increased effort to enforce the truck ban along Putnam and other protected
Cambridge streets? Do we perform any education outreach or have any communication with local trucking associations?
I feel like we can be doing more to address this.
I am more than willing to help. Please, let's try to make our streets safer. I don't want a "Lily Grace" of our own.
Sincerely,
~Steve Horner, Florence St.

I have to cross the Gilmore bridge every so often, and I cannot emphasize how scary riding a bike on it is.
Especially east-bound, toward Charlestown, because that side does not have a bike/breakdown lane that one
can safely ride in. I have had cars come too close for comfort while passing by, and even trying to brake-check
and lower their window to scream at me to get off the road - while I'm doing the best I can to ride home
safely. I would love to have a bike path along that bridge.
I think the role of a city council is to act in the best interest of all its residents - and reclaiming public spaces
plays deep into that role. Mass. Ave is a densely walked/biked area. And while the sacrifice of a few parking
spaces in favor of a protected bike path may inconvenience a few, it is in the greater good of the many.
Thank you,
Reuben

Support for friendly eminent domain

Great building. Many city offices are incredibly cramped or actually nonexistent. Meter maids are not allowed in city
hall to linger at change of shift. Actually asked not to use bathrooms there. And, this was before the pandemic.
Historic Commission is a mess. Have you ever had a meeting in their “conference room.” The roof is badly leaking in
Lombardi Building to a point that records and memorabilia get wet and plastic tarp can be seen covering file cabinets. I
am sure the building at least on upper floors has mold. I have visited Preservation offices in Savannah and Charleston
and New Orleans. How we treat our CHC and “our” collections is shameful.
Attending city meetings whether CHC or PB or ZBA etc at Senior Ctr can be oppressive. No air; and essentially taking over
a senior center that is supposed to be dedicated to just that, leaves little time for them or even cleaning the premises
BEFORE AND AFTER.
Some administrators in School Dept have a cubicle not an office and that is in really new building with records stored
offsite.
I was criticized for not arguing for community use. This is community use. These are community service providers.

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Gentlemen:
I support Cambridge Streets For All in its proposals and efforts to improve the recent Cycling Safety Ordinance.
The Ordinance as proposed is a real threat to local businesses and to those of us who live on side streets.
These streets already have heavy parking not only from those whose homes are on the these side streets but also from
the many drivers who are frequenting the stores and businesses on both Cambridge and Broadway
I accept and celebrate the “bikers” for their bravery and recognition of a cleaner environment. However, there are
many of us who must drive and our needs should also be recognized.

Nowhere to park, no public transportation

To whom it may concern,
Cambridge has put the cart before the horse with regard to eliminating parking from Mass ave in order to
install bike and bus lanes in the name of environmental stewardship. Most people support measures that will
protect the environment -- and really nobody more than me, to be honest -- but you can't force people to stop
driving if there is NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. There is NO REASONABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION for people
who do not live on or near Mass Ave. It is not reasonable to expect people to cobble together a 1.5 hour
itinerary that includes the commuter rail to a subway to a bus to a subway when it previously was a 20 minute
drive. The barriers to embarking on such arduous journeys are too many to list -- the need to get to and from
work -- especially while being female and having to commute after dark; a sick child who needs to go to the
pediatrician; grocery shopping or other errands with too many bags to carry; having a dog; being elderly;
being disabled; if your job requires a car/van/truck, etc etc -- the list goes on. The population that these
changes benefit is miniscule compared to the size of the one that they hurt and it is really mysterious as to
how such a poorly-thought-out plan became a reality.
Additionally, the irony of the extensive traffic jams these changes have resulted in is like a bad joke -- all the
thousands of idling cars and trucks, spewing particulate matter into the air for residents to inhale -- is the
opposite of environmental progress.
Cambridge needs to invest in excellent public transportation or, at the very least, provide alternative parking
options, before asking people to stop driving. That seems obvious and yet Cambridge has done the opposite. If
people can no longer reach their destinations in a reasonable time period they will simply take their business
elsewhere and Mass Ave will continue its decline until there is nothing left.
Respectfully,
Kristin W. Robbins BSN, RN

comment regarding communication 528 #2022 June 13 meeting

Regrettably I am unable to attend in person or remotely tonight. In place of speaking up I request that this
written statement in support of our request (COM 528 #2022) be considered. I am a member of the Hoyt Field Dog
Owners Group. The group now counts ca. 150 dog owners.
We ask that we be allowed to take our dogs to Hoyt Field to exercise them off leash in the late afternoon and early
evening during the many months off season when no one else uses the field. We are a very happy community of dog
owners who over pandemic gto to know each other and the incredibly diverse group of big, medium-sized and small
dogs who turn up morning after morning turn up before 9am, rain, snow or blazing hot weather, to exercise our dogs
and to talk. The community is generous, supportive, and promotes responsible dog ownership. For months on end no
one is using the field but us.
We share the use of the field and are committed to cleaning up after our dogs and to protect the incredible resource
that the field is to the community at large. Our petition is supported by the members and by neighbors who have no
dogs.

Love the bike lanes in Cambridge!

I just wanted to say thank you too all the Cambridge officials who have made the important policy decisions to prioritize
bike lanes in the city. As a frequent commuter through Cambridge, I applaud the lead Cambridge has taken to make a
greener, safer planet. The work you are currently doing on Mass Ave will make for critical bicycle infrastructure, and
ensure that Cambridge remains in the forefront of transportation policy for the 21st century. I am sorry that some of the
businesses do not agree with your decision, but the vast majority of residents and commuters do!

Progress Report on the Cycling Safety Ordinance

As a concerned resident I am asking you to reject the Progress Report on the Cycling Safety Ordinance
as incomplete. This report raises more questions than it answers.
Nowhere in the report does it state that 33 Metered spaces will be removed from Mass Ave in Porter
Square, and 115 Resident permit parking spaces will be removed from Garden St and 50-100% of
resident parking will be removed from Brattle street: Mason St to Mt Auburn this summer.
Nowhere in the report does it say 5 Million Dollars was lost to the City due to Parking meters being
removed from past projects.
Nowhere in this report does it show any improvement in bicycle safety, or reduction in accidents.
Nowhere in this report is the input of the Advisory Committee required by Policy Order POR 2021 #277 or
the financial effects on businesses as required by POR 2021 #276
No where in this report does it give budgeting information or feasibility studies for this Ordinance.
The disregard this council has shown to the voices of Cambridge concerned about the impact of the
ordinance, has given rise to a lawsuit to give voice to these issues and address these concerns. I support
this lawsuit. The Council needs to act now to respond to the people of Cambridge and All Stakeholders
ensuring we have a road design that works for all of us to access services, support our businesses, enjoy
our neighborhoods.
Kind regards,

Comment for COM 528 #2022

To whom it may concern - I am writing to support agenda item COM 528 #2022 to expand off leash dog hours at Hoyt
field. I am a dog owner as well as a foster for adoptable dogs in the neighborhood and I cannot speak highly enough
about the incredible community that Hoyt field provides.
While the mornings are absolutely lovely and we do not take those hours for granted, expanding hours to evenings
(when no other events are occurring) would be a huge help to many of us dog owners. It also would broaden the dog
friendliness of Cambridge, which is sometimes limited, especially with laws that don't allow dogs on outdoor patios like
so many other cities do. With the pandemic, so many local families were able to open their homes to a furry friend, and
the city of Cambridge should reflect that trend and request of their citizens by expanding Hoyt's hours.
Thanks,
Dina

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
WHEREAS:

Over the past several years, this nation has undergone a seemingly unending series of
traumatic events, from regular mass shootings, to the murders of people like George
Floyd and Breonna Taylor, to the marches and protests in reaction to those murders, to
the Covid-19 pandemic, to the January 6, 2021 insurrection that took place in
Washington, and these events have undeniably reverberated among and impacted the
people of Cambridge, leaving many members of this community tense, anxious, and
restless; and

WHEREAS:

With the recognition that so many of our residents are fraught and on edge, it would
behoove us to explore the establishment of a “community healing initiative” that would
encompass effective strategies to help our residents deal with anger, loneliness,
helplessness, frustration, loss of connectivity to our neighbors, and feelings of despair;
and

WHEREAS:

Such an initiative would be beneficial for the individuals in this community who have
felt beaten down from the collective traumas we’ve experienced, and it would also
offer a more hopeful, compassionate path forward for how our civic conversations and
interactions could be conducted; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to
establish a “community healing initiative” plan to address the aforementioned issues in
our city, and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:

Back in late April, property owners near 194 Harvard Street were alerted via letter that
this property would be undergoing a demolition in the coming weeks, and to be
mindful of the impacts of the demolition process upon noise levels, on-street parking,
and other related concerns; and

WHEREAS:

The project manager of the construction company undertaking the demolition sent this
notice to local property owners within 100 feet of the outer limits of the property being
demolished, as per the City’s Building Requirements – yet those same requirements do
not mandate that renters in this same area be made aware of these upcoming,
significant neighborhood disruptions; and

WHEREAS:

While the intent of this requirement appears to be geared towards allowing area
property owners to take all due precautions to ensure their property is not damaged by
the demolition process, it also serves to notify them of upcoming neighborhood
disruptions which then allows them to make whatever adjustments are needed to brace
for these disruptions, and this same courtesy should be extended to those who rent their
homes in these same neighborhoods; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to
establish a notification system to all neighborhood residents, regardless of whether
they own or rent their homes, within a set area where neighborhood disruptions such as
infrastructure work or demolitions are scheduled to occur, and to report back to the
City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:

On June 19, people throughout the country shall be celebrating Juneteenth, which
commemorates June 19, 1865, the day in which slavery was formally abolished in the
State of Texas, and which has come to be regarded as the final, formal date of
emancipation of all remaining former slaves throughout the United States of America
at the end of the Civil War; and

WHEREAS:

On June 17, 2021, President Biden signed into law legislation declaring Juneteenth to
be a federal holiday, and we celebrate this holiday each year in acknowledgment of the
ending of one of the most shameful aspects of this country’s history, and in the
continual hope that the United States shall forever strive to become a more perfect
union, and shall forever work to move closer to its founding ideals of being a nation
where all citizens truly are considered equal; and

WHEREAS:

In the 157 years since the end of the Civil War, the United States has unquestionably
made great strides, and has also suffered numerous, at times heartbreaking setbacks, in
the long march towards true civic equality for all its citizens; and

WHEREAS:

Juneteenth remains an important date for us to pause each year to reflect upon the
progress we have made, and to contemplate the work that remains as we seek to create
a more just country for the generations yet to come; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council recognize June 19, 2022 as Juneteenth in the City of Cambridge,
and in urging all Cambridge residents to reflect upon the meaning of this important
day.

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that Boston is currently piloting a tenday closure of Dartmouth Street between the Boston Public Library and Copley Square
which will include an expanded farmer’s market, additional library activities, café
seating, food trucks, performances, block parties, outdoor yoga and dance lessons, and
more; and

WHEREAS:

Boston will pilot additional citywide street closures on single days throughout the
summer, including on Blue Hill Avenue and Dorchester Avenue, which will include
food trucks, games, photo installations, performances, and more; and

WHEREAS:

On March 7, 2022, the City Council asked the City Manager to work with DCR to pilot
an expansion of Memorial Drive closures along any segments east of Western Avenue
that could be used as parkland, as a matter of equity; and

WHEREAS:

One highly feasible way to implement this request would be to pilot a closure of
Memorial Drive in the Eastbound Direction from Amesbury Street to Land Boulevard,
while retaining appropriate access to MIT river facilities, Charles River Yacht Club,
and Crimson Sailing Academy, and detouring eastbound traffic via Amesbury, Vassar,
Galileo Galilei, and Binney (proposed design attached); and

WHEREAS:

The best way to study the impact of such a closure and examine the positive and
negative impacts on flows of pedestrians, bikes, cars, buses, and more would be to
follow Boston’s lead and just try it over the course of one or more weekends during the
summer of 2022; and

WHEREAS:

Such examination should include both a pre-pilot and post-pilot study exploring the
impact to travel patterns in and around the location, including data collection on motor
vehicle counts and travel times, pedestrian counts and surveys, and bicycle counts,
both before, during, and after the pilot period, including at any and all major
intersections on primary approaches as well as potential reroute paths; and

WHEREAS:

Such a pilot project should include community engagement in the form of no fewer
than two community meetings, two prior to implementation and one following
implementation (specifically including East Cambridge, Wellington Harrington, The
Port, and Central Square) and discussion with stakeholders both before and after,
including (but not limited to) MIT, area residents, the business community, and the
community of riverfront facilities; and

WHEREAS:

Such a pilot project creates an opportunity to bring the community together around

now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DCR and all relevant

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that History Cambridge, a local history
museum on Brattle Street, as part of its ongoing work illuminating the history of
Cambridge, has installed an exhibit on the Forgotten Souls of Tory Row; and

WHEREAS:

The installation, titled “Forgotten Souls of Tory Row: Remembering the Enslaved
People of Brattle Street,” displays a selection of bottle trees that are currently on
display at the History Cambridge headquarters; and

WHEREAS:

The tradition of bottle trees, brought to the Caribbean and the U.S. by enslaved people,
uses bottles placed on tree branches to ward off evil spirits and capture the energy,
spirit, and memories of ancestors; and

WHEREAS:

The installation at History Cambridge represents the people who were enslaved by
mansion owners, in hopes of honoring their memory and legacy; and

WHEREAS:

The installation was completed by Black Coral, a non-profit dedicated to protecting
ecosystems endangered by climate change, as well as protecting and preserving
knowledge passed down by generations of marginalized communities; and

WHEREAS:

Much of the wealth from former mansion owners on Brattle Street was made from the
labor of enslaved people, both from individuals in the Caribbean and well as people at
their estates in Cambridge, and these individuals’ memories should be recognized; now
therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record congratulating History Cambridge in recognition of
their continued work to inspire and their mission “to explore how the past influences
the present in order to shape a better future”; and be it further

WHEREAS:

During the expansion of the MBTA Red Line, which was completed in 1982, and the
redesign of the area around Dunster Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Harvard
Square "The Pit" was created; and

WHEREAS:

The Pit was a submerged area meant to serve as a gathering spot; and

WHEREAS:

The Pit soon became home to a ragtag group of young people from Cambridge and
the surrounding area, who, because of their choice in music and of dress, were often
outsiders in their own communities; and

WHEREAS:

These "Pit Rats" as they became known, formed their own dynamic community that
resulted in life-long relationships; and

WHEREAS:

We must acknowledge that in addition to the positive, energized community of The
Pit, not all was perfect, and some were victims of violence, substances and sexual
assault and their experiences are the dark side of this otherwise positive experience,
and we must honor their pain; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge is currently in the process of redesigning this area that will
include leveling off The Pit, to turn it into a plaza; and

WHEREAS:

Although we will lose the physical appearance of The Pit, this area will continue to be
a welcoming place for young people to gather; and

WHEREAS:

All are invited to Pit-A-Palooza on June 25, 2022, from 5 to 10 pm for a celebration
with live music, performances of Rocky Horror songs, food, and a beer garden; now

therefore be it
RESOLVED:

That the City of Cambridge proclaims June 25, 2022, to be "Pit Rat Day" to honor the
history of The Pit and all of those who called it home.

Communicating Information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, June 7th, 2022, the School Committee held a regular meeting. We discussed
updates to the District Plan, including the proposed mission, vision, and core values. We also
continued an ongoing discussion about the student outcomes we strive to improve and the data
we will use to measure our progress. The English Language Arts Department also presented an
update about the progress and goals for next year.
Following the regular meeting, the School Committee held an executive session.
Last night 17 students graduated from the High School Extension Program! Tonight, our students
from Cambridge Rindge and Latin will graduate on Russell Field. We celebrate their success and
wish them well in whatever they choose to do next.
Congratulations to the CRLS Cambridge Rindge Boys Rugby Team on being recognized as the
Division 2 Team Sportsmanship Award Recipients for the Spring 2022 Season! Both the Boys
and Girls Crew Teams competed in the Mass State Public Championships last weekend, and both
took home the State Championship! Several students competed in the Division 1 State Track and
Field Championships last weekend, again we have State Champions! Junior Kylee Bernard took
home two Division 1 titles. She won both the 200 Meter and 400 Meter! Amelie Jamanka took
