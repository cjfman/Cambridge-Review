>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, ALL VOTES WILL BE BY ROLL CALL. WE'LL
OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. PURSUANT TO THE RULE, IN THE EVENT THERE ARE
20 OR MORE SPEAKERS, THE AMOUNT OF TIME ALLOCATED IS TWO MINUTES.
THEY CAN'T ALLOCATE THE REMAINDER OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS. WE HAVE
31 SPEAKERS WHO SIGNED UP. I ASK YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS
FOR THE RECORD AND THE ITEM YOU SPEAK ON. FIRST PERSON IS ADRIAN,
FOLLOWED BY MELISSA.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: CAN I RECORD THAT I'M HERE? I MISSED THE
ROLL CALL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN IS PRESENT.
>> ADRIAN DIDN'T JOIN. MELISSA.
>> PARTICIPANT: I THINK I'M UNMUTED. I'M SPEAKING ON THE GREEN
ROOFS PETITION THAT IS BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. TWO YEARS, FEW WORDS,
THE WORDS GREEN ROOFS, THE YEARS, THE TIMES PASS SINCE MOTHERS OUT
FRONT LAUNCH THIS EFFORT TO BRING GREEN ROOFS TO CAMBRIDGE. LET'S
STEP BACK. GREEN ROOFS EXISTED, BUT ON PAPER ONLY. IT IS A TALE OF
LOST OPPORTUNITIES. PAPER POSSIBILITIES, BUT NO VEGETATION ON
ROOFTOPS. THE CITY ASKS NOTHING OF ITS DEVELOPERS SO RESIDENTS GOT
NO CLIMATE MITIGATION IN RETURN. SO WE SAID, LET'S GET SOIL AND
PLANTS ON THE ROOFS. AND WE SAW GREEN ROOFTOPS IN THE CITIES
AROUND THE WORD DOING THIS. OUR VISION WAS NOT OTHER WORLDLY.
IT WAS NOT EVEN A NEW IDEA. GREEN ROOFS HAVE BEEN AROUND LONG
ENOUGH FOR ECONOMISTS AND SCIENTISTS TO CHART THEIR BENEFITS,
REDUCED ENERGY COST, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, HEAT ISLAND
MITIGATION, AIR FILTRATION, THAT'S TO CITE A FEW. THE BENEFITS ARE THE
ONES THAT SOLAR PANELS ALONE WILL NEVER REALIZE AND IN FACT COULD
WORSEN.
SO TONIGHT, AS CITY COUNCILLORS, WHOM THE VOTER SAID SHOULD
REPRESENT THEM, YOU WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO ACTIVATE THE TWO
WORDS: GREEN ROOFS. WAKING THEM FROM THEIR COMATOSE STATE TO
ONES PROMISING VEGETATION ON THE ROOFTOPS. WE RECOGNIZE OUR
INTENT OF ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC CLIMATE ISSUES WITH THIS UNIQUE ROOF
TOP SOLUTION IS ALTERED. I ASK OF YOU ON BEHALF OF CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS TO DO THE FOLLOWING: APPLY VEGETATIVE AND VEGETATIVE
AND SOLAR PANEL VISION AS WIDELY AS YOU CAN. TWO, DON'T AGREE TO
ANYTHING THAT LIMITS THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF A VEGETATIVE
APPROACH AND THREE, KEEP THIS ZONING ORDINANCE AS STRONG AS IT
POSSIBLY CAN BE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HENRY WORTIS.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. HENRY, AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON THE BOND
PETITION. AND OR THE BOND ORDER. AND I WANT TO ENTHUSIASTICALLY
ENDORSE IT AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE CO-SPONSORS,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR THEIR COURAGE


PAGE 2

April 26, 2021

AND VISION TO BREAK WITH THE DECADES-LONG INABILITY OF THE COUNCIL
TO PROPOSE A MAJOR INCREASE FOR FUNDING FOR ACCESSIBLE AND
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
THEY TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES THAT COUNCILS IN THE PAST HAVE SHIED
AWAY FROM. THIS ORDER ENABLES THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
EXCLUDED BY RED-LINING, BY GENTRIFICATION, BY RACIST INDIVIDUALS
WITHIN THE CITY GOVERNMENT, AND BY RACIST HOME OWNER S AND THEY
WILL NOW BE ABLE TO OBTAIN HOUSING AND BUILD THEIR EQUITY IN THE
CITY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY WOULD
BE ABLE TO HAVE HOUSING THAT GOES FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
ADDRESSING A CRITICAL DEMAND OF THE MISSING BOTTOM. THIS ORDER
RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS MONEY WEALTH THAT DETERMINES WHO CAN BUY
AND WHERE THEY CAN BUY IN THE CITY.
IT IS THE CITY THAT CAN PROVIDE THE NEEDED MONEY. THE ORDER
RECOGNIZES THAT IF THE HISTORICAL PRACTICES THAT INCLUDE ACTIONS BY
GOVERNMENTS HAVE CREATED INEQUALITY THAN JUSTICE DEMANDS IT IS
THOSE GOVERNMENTS WHO MUST ACT. NOT THE EXCLUDED. THE
EXCLUDED DO NOT HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDITION THEY HAVE
BEEN PLACED IN. THIS IS AN EXCITING PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT SUGGEST ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT. FEEL FREE TO
EMAIL THE REMAINDER. CHRISTOPHER, FOLLOWED BY MONTE.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. 17 LAUREL STREET. COMMENTING ON POLICY
ORDER THREE. LIKE THE SPEAKER BEFORE ME, I THANK THE SPONSOR OF THE
PETITION -- POLICY ORDER FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH A BOLD STEP
TOWARDS INVESTING IN INCREASING OUR STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOME
OWNERSHIP. FINANCING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNITS AND
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD
BE DOING MORE ON. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO
WELL-PAYING JOBS FOR MEMBERS OF CAMBRIDGE AND -- IT IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO A TYPE AND MODE OF HOUSING THAT
IS NOT GENERALLY WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE CITY AS THE POLICY ORDER
POINTS OUT, LESS THAN 1% OF THE HOMES IN THE CITY ARE HOME
OWNERSHIP UNITS AND THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO EXPAND. IT IS IMPORTANT
TO ENSURE THAT WE EXPAND IN A WAY THAT IS HEALTHY AND MOVING
FORWARD WITH CREATING A BETTER CITY. WE SEE ALL OF THE WAYS THAT
WE LOOK AT BUILDING HOUSING AND WE SEE IT IS EFFECTIVELY SOMETHING
THAT WILL HAVE TO MAKE MORE POSSIBLE AND PRACTICAL THROUGHOUT
THE CITY TO PROVIDE REDRESS FOR THOSE HISTORICAL EXCLUSIONS THAT WE
HAVE THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CITY YOU CAN'T CREATE MORE HOUSING AND
WE HAVE TO CREATE MORE HOUSING IN THE PLACES TO CORRECT THE
LONG-STANDING ISSUES OF EQUITY THAT WE ATTEMPT TO FIGHT HERE. I
THINK THE ORDER IS GREAT. I HOPE THE CITY MANAGER WILL MOVE
FORWARD WITH BRINGING A PLAN TO THE CITY COUNCIL TO FIND WAYS TO
CREATE THIS HOUSING AND MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.

>> MONTE DIDN'T JOIN.
>> I'M ELENA. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE GREEN
ROOFS PETITION IN THE STRONGEST VERSION. WE KNOW THAT GREEN
ROOFS HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. THEY CURB EMISSIONS, REDUCE
THE TEMPERATURES IN OUR CITY. THEY MAKE SOLAR PANELS MORE
EFFICIENT. AND THEY ATTRACT POLY-NATURES AND SEVEN AS GARDENS
WHERE TO GROW OUR FOOD, WHICH IS ALSO GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY.
THEY ARE ALSO GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY, I THINK, BECAUSE CLIMATE
CHANGE HAS VERY DISRUPTIVE CONSEQUENCES IN THE ECONOMY. IT MAKES
THE ECONOMY UNPREDICTABLE. BUILDING OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCE WILL
BUILD A STRONGER ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR CAMBRIDGE. I ALSO THINK THEY
ARE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BECAUSE THE COST
OF POLLUTION FALLS ON LESS PRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES. IT WILL MAKE OUR
CITY MORE EQUITABLE. ALSO, YOU WILL BE EQUITABLE TOWARDS FUTURE
AGAIN RAISES. I THINK TODAY WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ENJOYING THE
ENVIRONMENT AS IT IS. FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME
PRIVILEGE UNLESS WE ACT NOW. IT IS URGENT AND IMPERATIVE TO ACT
NOW. I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY KIDS, I'M THE MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG
CHILDREN. I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUR CITY FOR
THEM TO ENJOY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. PLEASE SHOW THE SAME
LEADERSHIP YOU HAVE SHOWN DURING THIS TRYING TIMES WITH COVID.
MAKE OUR CITY RESILIENT ALSO IN ENVIRONMENTAL TERMS. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE EMMA. AND FOLLOWED BY
JACQUELINE.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. I'M EMMA. I'M A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE
TERRACE. HOUSING STUDENTS FOR JUSTICE. AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF
OF THE POLICY ORDER THREE. I PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN THE CAMBRIDGE
CHRONICLE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNS -- A STRATEGY THAT
WILL MAKE PERFECT SENSE IN CAMBRIDGE TO ADDRESS OUR DUAL CRISIS OF
INACCESSIBILITY AND INEQUITY IN HOME OWNERSHIP. I REALLY COME AT
THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT HOUSING EQUALS HEALTH AND THE DATA
BACKS ME UP ON THIS. AND I THINK THAT INVESTING THROUGH A BOND
ORDER WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT STRATEGY FOR THE CITY TO INVEST MORE
IN HOME OWNERSHIP. AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. AS
WELL AS REVERSE A HISTORY OF SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT IS ENGRAINED IN
CAMBRIDGE AND OTHER CITIES. I SHOULD NOTE, LESS THAN 3.5% OF
CAMBRIDGE HOMES ARE VALUED AT LESS THAN $248,000. AND THE 2019
REPORT CARD FOUND LOW-INCOME HOUSES ARE ENTIRELY PRICED OUT OF
HOME OWNERSHIPS IN ALL FIVE COUNTIES GREATER BOSTON. OWNERSHIP IS
A WAY FAMILIES CAN CREATE AND MAINTAIN WEALTH WITH HOME OWNERS
HAVE A MEDIAN WEALTH OF 12 TIMES THE COMPARABLE RENTER. WE
KNOW FROM RECENT STUDIES AND PUBLICATIONS IN THE "BOSTON GLOBE"
THAT BLACK BOSTONIANS AND RESIDENTS OF THE GREATER BOSTON AREA
HAVE LIMITED WEALTH. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO EMPLOY TO
REDUCE THE WEALTH GAP AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY.

THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JACQUELINE.
>> JACQUELINE HAS NOT JOINED. CHOLE, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> I SPEAK ON POLICY ORDER FIVE. I WILL SAY BRIEFLY THAT I ALSO AGREE
WITH POLICY ORDER NUMBER THREE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SPOKE MORE
ELOQUENTLY ON THAT. I WILL JUST SAY THAT. POLICY ORDER FIVE, FOR ME,
IT IS KIND OF A NO-BRAINER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE CAMBRIDGE
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS A BEARCAT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. ITS MAJOR
PURPOSE I HAVE SEEN IT USED FOR IS TO INTIMIDATE PROTESTERS. I BELIEVE
THE CAMBRIDGE SHOULD BE DEMILITARIZED. INCLUDING THAT BEARCAT.
AND IN GENERAL, I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND
SAY, WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS. DO WE NEED ALL OF IT. IT CAN BE
RE-APPROPRIATED INTO FRANKLY THINGS THAT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL
FOR THE AVERAGE CAMBRIDGE CITIZEN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE WENDY.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, I'M WENDY, I LIVE AT 1 CUTLER AVENUE. MEMBER OF
MOTHERS OUT FRONT IN CAMBRIDGE. I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE GREEN
ROOFS PETITION. AND I WILL MAKE MY COMMENTS BRIEF. I'M SO HOPEFUL
THAT CAMBRIDGE WILL JOIN THE MANY OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED
ROBUST GREEN ROOFS POLICIES. THE CITIES HAVE USED A VARIETY OF
APPROACHES TO GREEN ROOF REGULATIONS AS STATED IN THE MEMO
SUBMITTED BY CDD. I BELIEVE THAT CAMBRIDGE IS BEST SEVERED BY A
MANDATE -- SERVED BY A MANDATE AND URGE YOU TO APPROVE THE
PETITION. THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. WE CANNOT LET THE PERFECT
PREVENT THE GOOD. OUR CHILDREN ARE COUNTING ON US TO DO WHAT IS
NECESSARY FOR THEIR FUTURE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: REVA STEIN.
>> 2 SEAGRAVE ROAD. I'M THE MOTHER OF TWO SONS, GRADUATES OF THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THE GREEN ROOFS
ORDINANCE, THAT REQUIRES VEGETATIVE OR BISOLAR ON ROOFTOPS OF
NEW CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS. THEY ARE 25,000 SQUARE FEET OR
LARGER. WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THE COUNCIL AND CAMBRIDGE
TRIED TO DO THIS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. AND
THERE'S NO MORE TIME. WE NEED TO DO OUR PART TO SAVE THE PLANET
FOR HUMAN HABITATION. WE ARE WAY PASS NEEDING -- BEING IN A
RELAXED MOMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. WE REALLY ARE IN A CLIMATE
EMERGENCY AND CAMBRIDGE NEEDS TO DO OUR PART. I REALLY HOPE THAT
THE CAMBRIDGE COUNCIL WILL ALL VOTE TO APPROVE THE GREEN ROOF
ORDINANCE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE EMMET AND THEN MASON.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, I'M ALSO CALLING FROM 2 SEAGRAVE ROAD.
25-YEAR-OLD GRADUATE OF CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I URGE CITY
COUNCIL TO BACK THE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE DESPITE THE KNOWN
BENEFITS OF GREEN ROOFS IN REDUCING THE HEIGHT ISLAND EFFECT AND


PAGE 5

April 26, 2021

FLOODING AND A HOST OF BENEFITS, NO NEW CONSTRUCTION IS BUILT AS A
RESULT OF THIS ORDINANCE. A MANDATE IS REQUIRED TO GET THE FULL
BENEFITS FROM GREEN ROOF TECHNOLOGY. I HOPE YOU WILL IMPLEMENT A
GREEN ROOF REQUIREMENT FOR ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION OF 25,000 PLUS
SQUARE FEET. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MASON, FOLLOWED BY CHARLES.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. 47 WILLIAM STREET. I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY
ORDER NUMBER FIVE. DEMILITARIZATION OF THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE
DEPARTMENT. I THINK IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE WE
HAVE OF HOW POLICE MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS USED. OFTENTIMES, THE
MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS JUSTIFIED BY SAYING, WE'LL ONLY USE IT IN THE
WORST CIRCUMSTANCES, A TERRORIST ATTACK OR ACTIVE SHOOTER. DATA
WE HAVE FROM NEARBY MASSACHUSETTS MUNICIPALITIES SHOWS THAT
ONCE ACQUIRED, THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT IS OFTEN USED FOR PURPOSES -OTHER PURPOSES. THE MOST COMMON ONE IS SERVING WARRANTS AND
OFTEN DRUG WARRANTS AND NO-KNOCK WARRANTS. THE CONNECTION
WITH WAR ON DRUGS IS ALARMING BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY OF THAT
POLICY AND NO-KNOCK WARRANTS HAVE RESULTED MANY TIMES IN
PEOPLE'S DEATHS.
AND IN DECIDING THIS POLICY ORDER, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN
MIND NOT JUST WHAT THE STATED PURPOSES, HOW THE EQUIPMENT GETS
USED. WHOSE LIFE IS PUT AT RISK BECAUSE OF THIS AND THE LACK OF ANY
COMPELLING DATA THAT THERE ARE SAFETY BENEFITS TO MILITARIZING THE
POLICE. REPORTING FROM LATE 2020 SHOWS THAT NO STUDY HAS SHOWN
THERE ARE ACTUAL PUBLIC SAFETY OR OFFICER SAFETY BENEFITS TO MILITARY
EQUIPMENT. SO, MILITARIZATION OF THE POLICE REALLY ENDS UP BEING A
NET LOSS FINANCIALLY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IN THE FACT THAT
HIGH-POWERED MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS INTRODUCED INTO SITUATIONS
WHERE PEOPLE OR CITIZEN LIVES ARE PUT AT RISK. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHARLES FRANKLIN. FOLLOWED BY
DIANE MARTIN.
>> CHARLES FRANKLIN, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> PARTICIPANT: 116 HAMPSHIRE STREET. I WILL TALK ON A COUPLE OF
THINGS. GREEN AND SOLAR ROOFS, SUPPORT IT. 25,000 SQUARE FOOT
BUILDING, THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT. DIVESTMENT FROM PRIVATE
PRISONS. PLEASE. THEY WERE BUILT LITERALLY TO RE-ENSLAVE BLACK
PEOPLE AFTER THE WAR. AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING MENTAL HEALTH
AWARENESS MONTH A PRIORITY FOR LIGHTING UP CITY HALL. I BELIEVE THAT
WILL BRING AWARENESS. DEFINITELY DEMILITARIZING THE POLICE. AND ON
THE AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE
CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I HAVE FREQUENTLY TESTIFIED
SAYING THAT. WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF


PAGE 6

April 26, 2021

DOLLARS TO THIS. I ONCE SAID WE SHOULD TAKE OUR CURRENT SAVINGS
AND SLASH IT IN HALF. MY UNDERSTANDING IS, THE WAY WE DO
AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP IS NOT TRUE OWNERSHIP. TRUE
OWNERSHIP GIVES OCCUPANT THE AGENCY TO LARGELY DO WHAT THEY
WANT WITH THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING SELLING IT TO WHOEVER AND
WHATEVER THEY -- WHATEVER PRICE THEY WANT.
REQUIRING THE OWNER TO SELL IT BACK TO THE CITY AT A SUB-MARKET
PRICE IS NOT OWNERSHIP. NOT BEING ABLE TO PASS DOWN THE PROPERTY
TO CHILDREN IS NOT OWNERSHIP. IT IS NOT EQUAL. IT IS NOT RACIAL
JUSTICE. IN THE 1950S THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED HOME OWNERSHIP
FOR WHITE PEOPLE AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO
PURCHASE. WE CAN TELL THEM THEY CAN OWN BUT SELL IT BACK TO THE
CITY. THAT IS NOT EQUAL. WE CAN'T GIVE HOMES AWAY EITHER. I THINK
WE SHOULD DO A SHARED EQUITY SYSTEM WHERE THE CITY GETS PART OF
THE EQUITY BACK WHEN THE HOUSE IS SOLD AND THE OWNER CAN SELL TO
WHO THEY WANT AND FOR HOW MUCH THEY WANT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE DIANE MARTIN. FOLLOWED BY
HUMA.
>> PARTICIPANT: DIANE, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> PARTICIPANT: GOOD EVENING. I'M DIANE MARTIN FROM MOTHERS OUT
FRONT AND LIVE IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE. INCLUDED IN THIS MEETING'S
MATERIAL IS A LETTER TO THE CITY MANAGER FROM THE COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. IT IS AMENDED LANGUAGE TO THE GREEN
ROOFS ORDINANCE SUBMITTED BY MOTHERS OUT FRONT. 51 OF THE
AGENDA PACKET. EXEMPTION 22352. THE LANGUAGE PERMITS ENORMOUS
LATITUDE FOR EQUIPMENT THAT DEVELOPERS CAN BYPASS THE INTENT OF
THE GREEN ROOFS ZONING PROVISION BY LOADING A ROOF WITH ALL TYPES
OF EQUIPMENT AND ALL MANNERS OF FEATURES, CHIMNEYS, SKYLIGHTS, ET
CETERA. THAT CAN BYPASS PAYMENT IN LIEU OF GREEN ROOFS. WE CAN
HAVE EQUIPMENT-FILLED ROOFS WITH NO VEGETATION AND NO
COMPENSATION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. I URGE THE REMOVAL
OF PARAGRAPH FOUR AND RETURN TO THE LANGUAGE OUR PETITION
PROVIDED IN OUR REQUIREMENT THAT OUTLINES THE AMOUNT OF WHAT
GREENS OR BIOSOLAR COVERAGE WITH PARAMETERS FOR MECHANICALS
AND INTRUSIONS. WE HAVE COME THIS FAR, IN 2010, THE CITY COUNCIL
ADOPTED A GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE THAT CLEARED THE WAY FOR GREEN
ROOFS TO BE BUILT. IT WASN'T A MANDATE. DEVELOPERS HAD MORE THAN
A DECADE TO BUILD GREEN ROOFS. IF YOU FLY OVER CAMBRIDGE TODAY,
YOU SEE BLACK ROOFS. IF YOU WALK THE STREETS IN THE SUMMER, YOU
WILL EXPERIENCE HEAT ISLANDS IN THE MOST VULNERABLE
NEIGHBORHOODS. PEOPLE CARE ABOUT CLIMATE, CARE ABOUT AIR
POLLUTION, AND THEY WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CITY, JUST LIKE YOU DO.
AND MANY, MANY PEOPLE WANT GREEN ROOFS NOW FOR CAMBRIDGE.
STEP UP TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIMES, AS THE POLICIES ENACTED
TODAY WILL IMPACT YOUNG PEOPLE FAR MORE THAN THEY DO YOU OR ME
AND MORE THAN DEVELOPERS WHO SELL BUILDINGS AND LEAVE TOWN.

April 26, 2021

PLEASE, VOTE TO PASS THE GREEN ORDINANCE ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS HUMA GUPTA.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF CHARTER
RIGHT 1, POLICY ORDER 3 AND 5. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER FOR REQUESTING THAT FUNDS BE ALLOCATED FOR
INDEPENDENT LEGAL RESEARCH. I THINK THAT CITY COUNCILLORS SHOULD
HAVE ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL THAT WORKS ON BEHALF OF
LEGISLATION, DEMANDED BY VOTERS AND THAT LEGAL ADVICE IS NOT
BEHOLDEN TO THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE. AS WE SAW DURING THE TEAR
GAS ORDINANCE MEETING, THE CITY SOLICITOR CAN PROVIDE COUNSEL THAT
REFLECTS THE PRIORITIES OF THE CITY'S UNELECTED BRANCH OFFICIALS. NOT
NECESSARILY THE VOTER PRIORITIES AND CHOICES. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT
DEMOCRACY IN CAMBRIDGE AND PASS THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT WITH NO
FURTHER DELAY.
SECOND, I WILL THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN FOR PROPOSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND. IN LIEU OF
RENT CONTROL, RENT STABILITY AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN
OUR CITY, THE BOND CAN BE ONE SMALL PART OF A STRATEGY TO STEM THE
TIDE OF RACIALIZED DISPLACEMENT AND BUILD EQUITY FOR
FIRST-GENERATION AND FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS. LASTLY, I WILL ADDRESS
THE ISSUE OF DEMILITARIZING THE POLICE WHICH IS PUT FOR THE BY
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AND WE HEARD
MORE ARGUMENTS TONIGHT, WE HAVE YET TO SEE A PLAN FOR HOW THE
CPD WILL PLAN TO DEMILITARIZE THE PART AND DESTROY THE BEARCAT AND
A PORTION OF THE RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS. WE HAVE WAITED. IT IS TIME TO
SHOW US WHAT ACTIONS THEY WILL TAKE. WE NEED PROGRAMS FOR
PUBLIC SAFETY, NOT WEAPONS FOR PUBLIC INTIMIDATION. I HOPE THE
COUNCIL PASS THE RESOLUTION TONIGHT UNANIMOUSLY. THANK YOU FOR
YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE GAL KOBER.
>> PARTICIPANT: CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M R I LIVE ON NEWTON STREET. I
LIKE TO OFFER MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR POLICY ORDER NUMBER FIVE. THE
PROPOSAL TO DEMILITARIZE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT. CAMBRIDGE
POLICE DEPARTMENT OWNS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT,
INCLUDING A BEARCAT VEHICLE AND OTHER PIECES. STUDIES SHOWS THAT
MILITARY-GRADE GEAR USED BY POLICE DOESN'T REDUCE CRIME NOR
PROTECT POLICE OFFICERS AND FURTHER, THE USE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT
IS JUSTIFIED BY -- OR THE NEED TO PROCURE IT IS JUSTIFIED BY THE NEED FOR
IT IN CASES OF TERRORIST ATTACK AND OTHER EVENTS. DATA SHOWS, IT
ENDS UP BEING USED AS AN ACCESSORY FOR POLICE BRUTALITY AND
INTIMIDATE PROTESTERS. I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT POLICY ORDER NUMBER 5
TO DEMILITARIZE THE POLICE FORCE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT GOING TO ADRIAN, WHO IS NOW ON THE ZOOM.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANKS SO MUCH. I WANTED TO MOSTLY THANK THE CITY
COUNCIL FOR PASSING THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION AS AMENDED TWO

PAGE 8

April 26, 2021

WEEKS AGO. I THINK IT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT. AND I
DON'T THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SHOULD BE MINIMIZED. YOU ARE
AWARE, DECARBONIZING OUR BUILDINGS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS WE HAVE TO TACKLE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND I THINK
INCLUDING SOLAR, EXEMPTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND ADDRESSING
SOME OF THE MECHANICAL CONCERNS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO MAKE SURE
THE PETITION IS EFFECTIVE AND IT REALLY DOES PUSH DEVELOPERS TO PUSH
OUT SOLAR CAPACITY. IT WASN'T FEASIBLE TEN YEARS AGO AND NOW IT IS.
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THIS PUT INTO ACTION. IT IS A HUGE WIN FOR
THE CLIMATE AND A HUGE STEP FORWARD FOR CAMBRIDGE AS A CITY TO BE
FORCING PEOPLE TO BUILD OUT SOLAR GREEN ROOF OR A COMBINATION.
SECONDLY AND MORE BRIEFLY, I WANTED TO NOTE MY SUPPORT FOR
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S PROPOSAL AROUND AFFORDABLE HOME
OWNERSHIP. I THINK EXPANDING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN ANY WAY IS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WILL HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR THE CITY
AND THE CITIES. AND I KNOW THAT MOSTLY CALLS FOR A PLAN TO BE PUT
FORTH FROM THE CITY MANAGER, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND HOPE TO
SEE THAT ADVANCE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT WE GO TO SUZANNE BLIER.
>> PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DO YOU HEAR US? I THINK WE CAN COME BACK TO
SUZANNE. WE'LL GO TO MICHAEL.
>> ROBERT, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. 56 NORFOLK STREET. CITIES ARE MY FAVORITE
AREA TO GROW FOOD. PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE NEED NUTRITIONAL ACCESS
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. LOVE PEOPLE LOVE NATURAL SPACES, AND
DISCOVERING PLANT SPECIES AND LIVING SYSTEMS REGARDLESS OF THE
SOCIOECONOMICS. PLEASE, CAMBRIDGE, LEAN ON CONCEPTS LIKE
RENEWABLE CONSERVATION AND MITIGATION TO TURN OUR MANY
PROBLEMS INTO NEW BENEFITS UNDER THE LENS OF SYNERGY. COMBINING
TECHNOLOGY AND VALUES AND INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN A
WAY THAT IS CONDUCIVE AND BENEFICIAL TO OUR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH
OF THE PLANET.
THE RAINWATER FALLING ON THE BUILDINGS RUNS OFF TO CREATE A
NUISANCE OR SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND AS CLIMATE CHANGES CONTINUES, WE
EXPECT TO SEE MORE PRECIPITATION THREATENING STORMWATER RUN-OFF
AND CAUSE DAMAGE. INCREASING VEGETATION WILL GIVE THE ABILITY TO
REDIRECT TO WHAT CAN BE A COSTLY PROBLEM TO REPURPOSE THE WATER.
WE HAVE PLANT BIOLOGY AND SOLAR POWER TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE ISSUES.
SOLAR PANELS EASILY OVERHEAT. DRASTICALLY REDUCING EFFICIENCY.
LESSENING THAT HEAT ABSORBED ONLY HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS WITHOUT
SACRIFICING LIGHT ABSORPTION. A DUAL EFFECT AND PLANTS CAN LOSE
WATER IN HIGH HEAT, PANELS AROUND VEGETATION WILL HELP PARTIALLY
SHADE THEM THROUGHOUT THE HEAT WAVE. WE VALUE HEALTH AND
BENEFITS THAT NATURAL SPACE OFFER, PLANTS, TREES, AND FOREST OFFER

PAGE 9

April 26, 2021

NATURALLY-OCCURRING NATURAL MEDICINE AND PLANTS WILL ABSORB
CARBON DIOXIDE. PLEASE PASS THE STRONG ORDINANCE FOR THE GREEN
ROOFTOPS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JUSTIN. FOLLOWED BY SUSAN.
>> PARTICIPANT: 259 HURLEY STREET. EAST CAMBRIDGE. I WANT TO
COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE AS AMENDED. I
THINK THE AMENDMENTS AND FURTHER WORK BY CDD HAVE IMPROVED THE
ORDINANCE AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY FOR
YOUR HARD WORK.
I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF A STANDARD DEFINITION OF
BISOLAR WE SHOULDN'T DISCOURAGE -- OTHER CITIES WITH GREEN ROOFS
ORDINANCE, SUCH AS TORONTO, EXEMPT SOLAR. MY ONLY ADDITIONAL
COMMENT IS THAT I'M NOT SURE WHERE THINGS STAND ON ROOFTOP
PARKING AND IT IS UNCLEAR WHY EXEMPT IT FROM THE ORDINANCE. I WANT
TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF DRAFTING A PLAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING. CAMBRIDGE CAN AND SHOULD SPEND
MORE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INCLUDING HOME OWNERSHIP
OPPORTUNITIES. THE PLAN SHOULD ADDRESS THE BEST, MOST EFFICIENT
AND LEGALLY COMPLAINT WAYS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO
FOLKS WITH VARYING INCOME LEVELS, THOSE WHO QUALIFY FOR VARIOUS
EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAMS AND
THOSE WHO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, DO NOT QUALIFY.
I DO THINK THERE ARE LEGAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT MAY IMPACT THE
ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD ALONG THE SPECIFIC LINES PROPOSED, WHICH
CAN BE MORE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE PLAN THAT IS PUT FORWARD.
WE SHOULD ENSURE ZONING ALLOWS IT TO BE BUILT IN ALL
NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, SUSAN RINGLER.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF POLICY
ORDER NUMBER ONE. FAVOR OF DIVESTING FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND
PRIVATE PRISONS. PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. THIS IS REALLY
SIMPLE TO DO. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD INVESTMENTS OUT THERE. LET'S
STEER THE CAMBRIDGE MONEY AWAY FROM THE REALLY BAD THINGS.
TWO, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDER 5. PLEASE DO ALL THAT
YOU CAN TO DECREASE THE MILITARIZATION OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE DON'T NEED THE WEAPONS, WE DON'T NEED THE
BEARCAT. GET ON WITH IT, PLEASE, PLEASE, VOTE IN FAVOR. IN FAVOR OF
THE BOND ISSUE FOR AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP. THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT AND GOOD NEW PIECE THAT WE CAN ADD TO THE MIX.
I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE
CITY COUNCIL. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT SOMETIMES FOR THE CITY COUNCIL
-- IT IS NOT ALWAYS IN LINE WHAT THE CITY MANAGER OPINION IS. THAT'S
IMPORTANT. AND LAST, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE
STRONGEST POSSIBLE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE FOR LARGE BUILDINGS. LET'S


PAGE 10

April 26, 2021

NOT WATER IT DOWN. THESE ARE REALLY BIG BUILDINGS DO IT RIGHT AND
GET THE ROOFS COVERED IN A WAY THAT IS GOOD FOR THE CLIMATE.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS IS HERE AND I
URGE YOU TO INCLUDE SOLAR PANELS ALONG WITH THE GREEN ROOFS AND
PERHAPS BRING IT TO THE PLANNING BOARD TO DECIDE WHICH AND
WHETHER BECAUSE SOLAR ROOFS WORK VERY EFFICIENTLY. SECONDLY, I
STRONGLY SUPPORT DIVESTMENT FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND PRIVATE PRISONS
AND IN MY LETTER TO YOU URGE THAT IF YOU CAN DO ANYTHING TO GET
LOCAL UNIVERSITIES AND OTHERS TO DO THE SAME, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
HOME OWNERSHIP, THIS IS REALLY KEY GOING FORWARD. AFFORDABLE
HOME OWNERSHIP AND I LONG ADVOCATED WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN
BURLINGTON, VERMONT, AND ELSEWHERE ALONG WITH NICOLE WILLIAMS
AND OTHERS. THE PLAN NEEDS SOME THINKING. WE SHOULDN'T PUT THIS
IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST. WE SHOULD FOCUS ON CITY-OWNED
LANDS TO BUILD THERE SPECIFICALLY AND BUY MORE LAND IN THE CITY
ITSELF IN ORDER TO DO THIS. AND WE SHOULD DO OTHER RULES, SUCH AS
STOPPING THE CONVERSION OF RENTAL PROPERTIES INTO LUXURY CONDOS.
OR MULTIFAMILY HOMES INTO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. LET'S GET IT RIGHT
AND I'M GLAD THE CONVERSATION IS STARTING. DON'T PASS IT AS IS,
PLEASE. AND FINALLY, I SUPPORT CHARTER RIGHT ONE. GET SOME GOOD
LEGAL COUNSEL -- LEGAL ADVICE FOR THE COUNCIL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS HEATHER HENRIKSEN.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. I'M THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF HARVARD
UNIVERSITY'S OFFICE FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE.
AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION. FIRST, I WILL SAY
HARVARD IS FOCUSSED ON ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. THE UNIVERSITY
SECONDS THAT CLIMATE GOALS SINCE FEBRUARY OF 2018 ARE TO
FOSSIL-FUEL FREE -- THAT BUILT ON A 30 PERCENT CUT EMISSION ACHIEVED
IN 2016. WE HAVE OVER TWO MEGAWATTS OF INSTALLED SOLAR ON THE
CAMPUS AND GROWING. WE HAVE OVER 14 GREEN ROOFS AND GROWING.
ON BEHALF OF COLLEAGUES, MY COMMENTS ARE THAT AGAIN IF THIS IS
GOING TO BE VOTED ON TONIGHT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE CLIMATE
RESILIENCY TASK FORCE THAT IS WORKING FOR TWO YEARS ON A PACKAGE, IF
YOU WILL VOTE TONIGHT, WE DEFINITELY WANT TO SUPPORT THE
AMENDMENTS. IT IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN THE SOLAR OPTION. WE FEEL IT
IS CRITICAL TO US, MEANING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AT HARVARD AND WITHIN
THE CITY. AND FROM OUR RESEARCH, BIOSOLAR IS STILL UNPROVEN. WE
DIDN'T FIND PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OR DEEP
KNOWLEDGE ON THE NORTHEAST. SO, WE'D LOVE TO STUDY IT, BUT WE
DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ROOFTOP SOLAR OPTION
CONTINUES. AND ALSO A ZONING FRONT, THERE WERE SOME FLAWS
ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS TO INCORPORATE LANGUAGE -- THAT
NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED OR ELSE WE FEEL IT WILL BE INFEASIBLE AND ACTION
WON'T WORK FROM DAY ONE. WE WANT TO SEE MOVING FORWARD TO
ADDRESS CLIMATE. AND THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY

MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, PETER GLICK.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. 6 DONNELL STREET. I FINANCE SOLAR ROOFS FOR
NONPROFITS THAT SERVE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND I WILL ECHO THE
COMMENTS THAT HEATHER MADE. I SUPPORT THE GREEN ROOFS INITIATIVE,
BUT I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT IT BE AMENDED TO ALLOW
BUILDERS TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR ON THEIR BUILDINGS
BEFORE GREENERY IS CONSIDERED. THE REASON FOR THIS, SOLAR IS BY FAR
THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE OUR CARBON
FOOTPRINT. ONE MEDIUM-SIZE BUILDING, THE WATERTOWN BOYS AND
GIRLS CLUB IS AN EXAMPLE WITH THE SYSTEM I FINANCED, HAS THE
EQUIVALENT OF 40 ACRES OF FOREST IN TERMS OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION.
IT IS THOUSANDS OF TIMES THE IMPACT OF A GREEN ROOF ON A SINGLE
BUILDING. AND AS HEATHER SAID, IF WE ARE TO MEET THE PRESIDENT'S
GOALS FOR REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IN GENERAL, SOLAR IS AN
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT.
THE GREEN ROOFS PROPONENTS HAVE ASSERTED THAT GREEN AND SOLAR
CAN CO-EXIST, SAYING THE PANELS CAN SHADE THE GREENERY OR THE
GREENERY WILL KEEP THE PANELS COOL, THE PROBLEM WITH THAT, THE
PRODUCTION OF A SOLAR SYSTEM IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS SIZE
AND THE COST OF THE SYSTEM IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE
MOUNTING SYSTEM. SHARING BETWEEN GREEN AND SOLAR IS VERY LIKELY
TO REDUCE THE TOTAL SOLAR PRODUCTION ON THE ROOF, INCREASE THE
TOTAL COST, IT MAY MAKE SOLAR COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE ON THAT ROOF.
SO, I HOPE YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS AND MAYBE APPLY A POCKET
CALCULATOR TO THE NUMBERS HERE. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAXIMIZE
SOLAR. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE PETE ELLIS.
>> PARTICIPANT: CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. 9 OLIVE SQUARE IN SOMERVILLE. AND AS YOU
KNOW, I HAVE SPOKEN ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CALLS OVER THE PAST
FEW MONTHS. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK
TONIGHT. I COME AS A GREEN ROOF PROFESSIONALS WITH OVER A DECADE
IN THE INDUSTRY AND OVER 20 YEARS IN THE BROADER TRADES. I HAD A
WHOLE BUNCH OF REMARKS TO PREPARE AND SHARE WITH YOU, BUT I THINK
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TOUCH ON THE NUMBER OF THE IDEAS THAT
WERE PRESENTED VERY ELOQUENTLY BY A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS.
I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHARE THAT GREEN ROOFS AND SOLAR
ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND DO VERY WELL TOGETHER. AND IT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T THINK OF THESE TWO THINGS AS
ENEMIES. SOMETHING THAT REALLY DOES STACKS THEIR BENEFITS WHEN
INSTALLED IN TANDEM. I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT
THEM THAT WAY BECAUSE IF WE ONLY FOCUS ON CERTAIN BENEFITS FOUND


PAGE 12

April 26, 2021

IN EACH SYSTEM, THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR US TO OVERLOOK OTHER BENEFITS
THAT ARE REALLY POWERFUL AND REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK
ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE.
THAT CAN BE SEEN THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIOSOLAR, WHICH I
THINK IS A VERY APPROPRIATE AND POWERFUL TOOL IN OUR APPROACH
TOWARDS DEALING AND PROVIDING A MORE RESILIENT IN A CLIMATE-READY
FUTURE AND CITY. I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE CONSIDER THESE IN
TANDEM AND THAT WE REMOVE THE OPTION FOR SOLAR ON ROOFS
BECAUSE IT IS SHORT-SIGHTED AND PROVIDE LESS BENEFITS. MOVING
FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF BISOLAR CAN STACK THE BENEFITS THAT
COME WITH ALL -- COME WITH GREEN ROOFS. MANY OF WHICH ARE LISTED.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AIR QUALITY, SOUND ATTENUATION,
WELL-BEING AND THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR GENERATION, ESPECIALLY AS THEY
IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF SOLAR PANELS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIATED AND
PEER-REVIEWED PAPERS THAT ADDRESS THEM OUT IN THE LITERATURE.
THANK YOU.
>> PARTICIPANT: JESSICA BURGER. PRESIDENT OF THE A LOCAL
ORGANIZATION CALLED CAMBRIDGE TABLE TO FARM. I WILL SPEAK ON CITY
MANAGER'S AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 89. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF EXCITING CLIMATE AND JUSTICE-RELATED THINGS ON THE
AGENDA.
I WILL ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF GOING AFTER AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE GOALS.
I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE COUNCILLORS FOR PASSING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 45, BACK IN MARCH. EXPLORING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL COMPOSTING PILOT. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS FOR THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
FEASIBILITY OF THIS PROPOSAL.
WE ARE EAGER TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE RESULTS AND THE INVESTIGATION
WITH THE CITY MANAGER HAS TO SAY TONIGHT. AND THAT BEING SAID, THE
ATTACHMENTS OF THE CMA, IT APPEARS THAT THE -- THE INVESTIGATION IS
MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PILOT THIS FALL. THIS IS EXCITING NEWS. BIG
STEP FORWARD FOR CAMBRIDGE. WHILE CAMBRIDGE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND
SUPPORTING OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC.
I'M INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND HOW IT
WAS CONDUCTED. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PROPOSED PILOT
WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH A SIMILAR STRATEGY TO THE RESIDENTIAL
COMPOST PROGRAM AND UTILIZING WASTE MANAGEMENT CORE FACILITY
AND THE DIGESTER. WE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BREAKDOWN
OF THE STRATEGY COMPARED TO THE ONE WE PROPOSED WITH THE
UTILIZED MULTIPLE -- WE UNDERSTAND THE VOLUME THEY CAN'T GO TO A
SINGLE HAULER AND PROPOSED TO MANY HAULERS. WE ARE CURIOUS IF
THERE IS AN RFP PROCESS. REGARDLESS WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THE PILOT
MOVING FORWARD AND UNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS OF REMOVING
FOOD WASTE, BUT ARE CURIOUS ABOUT -- WE WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION DISCUSSED. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE
WORK.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LEE FARRIS?
>> PARTICIPANT: OKAY. CAN YOU HEAR ME? 269 NORFOLK STREET. AND I'M
SPEAKING ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES TONIGHT. REGARDING THE GREEN
ROOF PETITION, I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL WILL PASS A VERSION THAT
COMBINES BOTH SOLAR AND GREEN ROOFS. I THINK WE GET THE MOST
BENEFIT ALL AROUND FROM THAT COMBINATION, INCLUDING REDUCING
HEAT ISLAND EFFECT. AND CAPTURING CARBON AND SO FORTH. NEXT ON
THE... THE CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER ONE. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CITY
COUNCILLORS TO GET THEIR OWN LEGAL ADVICE. IT HAS BEEN A BARRIER TO
MANY OF THE INITIATIVES THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS PURSUED. SO, I HOPE
THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.
REGARDING THE HOUSING BOND, NUMBER THREE, POLICY ORDER NUMBER
THREE, ENVISION CALLED FOR EXPLORING USING BONDS TO FUND
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE REALLY NEED TO START USING THAT TOOL OF
BONDS TO FUND THE KINDS OF HOUSING THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT DO NOT ADEQUATELY FUND OR FUND AT ALL. ESPECIALLY
WHEN FUNDING IN OURSELVES WILL ENABLE US TO PRIORITIZE PEOPLE WHO
GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE. AND REGARDING THE FOSSIL FUELS, I URGE THE
COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THIS SO THAT SINCE WE CAN'T DIVEST OUR PENSION
FUNDS, WE CAN DIVEST OUR OTHER FUNDS THAT WE DO CONTROL. AND
LASTLY, WE SUPPORT DEMILITARIZING OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE HEARD
GOOD REASONS FOR THAT TONIGHT. THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAMILLA ELVIS.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, 28 LINNAEAN STREET. I WANT TO SAY I SUPPORT
DIVESTING FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND PRISONS WHERE WE CAN. IT IS RIGHT
THING TO DO. FOSSIL FUELS, PROBABLY A SMART ECONOMIC THING TO DO
LONG-TERM. AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN FOR BRINGING FORWARD THE PO FOR THE BOND
FOR AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP CONSTRUCTION. THAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON THAT.
AND I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION
WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW ROOF-TOP MECHANICALS, WHICH IS
IMPORTANT FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY OPPOSED TO BASEMENTS. AND THE
SOLAR AMENDMENT... I DO WANT TO THANK MOTHERS OUT FRONT FOR
BRINGING THIS PETITION FORWARD AND BRINGING THE CONVERSATION. IT
IS SUPER IMPORTANT AND IF WE DISAGREE IN THE DETAILS, I'M DEEPLY
GRATEFUL.
THAT'S ALL. THANKS, GUY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LOREN, FOLLOWED BY HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, 8 MUSEUM WAY. I HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST POLICE
MILITARIZATION AND I HAVE WORKED TO GET MILITARY EQUIPMENT OUT OF
THE CITY. I'M A FAN OF TWITTER. AND I LIKE TO THINK A RECOGNIZE A GOOD
TWEET. POLICY ORDER NUMBER FIVE IS A VERY GOOD TWEET.
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT A VERY GOOD POLICY ORDER. COMMISSIONER BARD
HAS SHOWN TO BE A WILLING PARTNER IN REFORM. HE BEGAN TO DO WHAT

PAGE 14

April 26, 2021

WE WANT. PROMISE TO START ELIMINATING HEAVY WEAPONS, DISPOSED OF
-- TO ADD THE OVERALL SAFETY AND SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE
TO CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS AND OFFERING A NONPOLICE RESPONSE OPTION.
LIKELY SIMILAR TO THE CAHOOTS MODEL. HE SAID HE IS OPENING TO
RETIRING THE BEARCAT AND LOOKING HOW TO DO SO. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A
POLICY ORDER THAT SHOULD BE A PHONE CALL. I WONDER WHY A
COUNCILLOR IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE POLICE COMMISSION
VIA A POLICY ORDER. GETTING INTO THE NUANCES OF WHAT REAL REFORM
LOOKS LIKE. IT IS VAGUE AND THOUGHTLESS, ALL HEAT AND NO LIGHT. IT
CALLS FOR GETTING RID OF ALL CPD RIFLES. THAT'S NOT A REAL REQUEST.
THERE'S NO GREATER CRITIC OF ACTUAL POLICE MILITARIZATION THAN ME.
THEY WILL STILL HAVE A RIFLE OR TWO AND MALPRACTICE TO SUGGEST
OTHERWISE. LOOK AT THE WHAT THE POLICY ORDER ACTUALLY SAYS TO FIX
IT, MAKE IT USEFUL OR TABLE IT. THERE'S NO ONE IN THE CITY, NO ONE
CONSTITUENCY SUPPORTING POLICE MILITARIZATION. WE DON'T NEED
GRANDSTANDING. NO ARGUMENT HERE. WE NEED THOUGHTFUL
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THE POLICE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HEATHER HOFFMAN, FOLLOWED BY JAMES
WILLIAMSON.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. AS A LAWYER, I'D LIKE TO
ENCOURAGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO GET ITS OWN LAWYER. IT IS VERY
DIFFICULT TO SERVE MORE THAN ONE MASTER AND YOU SHOULD BE THE
ONLY CLIENT THAT YOUR LAWYER IS THINKING ABOUT. AND WITH RESPECT
TO AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK AS A -- MORE THAN 30
YEARS, TO SAY I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE BETTER
OPPORTUNITIES, BUT I AGREE WITH CHARLES FRANKLIN, THE WAY WE GO
ABOUT IT, IT HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORY SO FAR. AND WE REALLY NEED TO
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WHAT ARE WE TRYING
TO CREATE. ARE WE TRYING TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE IS
NOT BEHOLDEN TO A LANDLORD. OTHERWISE, IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT,
WE CAN'T BUILD A GOOD PROGRAM TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE GOALS ARE.
AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO POLICY ORDER NOBODY TALKED ABOUT,
ADDING PREGNANCY LAW TO PARENTAL LEAVE. I HAVE PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE WITH EVERY SINGLE THING IN THAT LAST WHEREAS. AND THE
ONE THING THAT I'D SAY TO YOU, YOU SHOULD THINK LONG AND HARD. THE
MENTAL HEALTH MONTH THING MADE ME THINK OF THIS AS WELL.
WHETHER YOU WANT TO CALL THIS PARENTAL LEAVE. IT CREATES FOR SOME
PEOPLE THAT IS GREAT AND FOR SOME PEOPLE, THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER
BLOW. I PERSONALLY COULDN'T HAVE STOOD IT. AND OUR SOCIETY DOESN'T
DEAL WITH THIS WELL AT ALL. I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU ARE RECOGNIZING
THAT IT IS A TREMENDOUS LOSS. THINK ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE WORDS
YOU CHOOSE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, JAMES, FOLLOWED BY BERNICE.
>> PARTICIPANT: JAMES, 1000 JACKSON PLACE. I REPORT DIDN'T MAKE IT
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY WITH ONLINE PARTICIPATION, WHICH I WISH
YOU ALL WOULD PAY BETTER ATTENTION TO AND DO A LITTLE BIT WITH.

April 26, 2021

ALSO, I WANT TO SPEAK TO AN ELEMENT OF A COMMITTEE REPORT, BUT
WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK TO IS NOT ACTUALLY THERE IN THE AGENDA. I HAD
TO GO BACK TO JANUARY 12TH AND FIND IT AND TO GET WHAT I WANTED TO
SPEAK ABOUT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE CAN'T BE A LINK, THE SAME
LINK -- I HOPE TO KNOW IT WAS THERE. IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THERE,
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW TO LOOK FOR IT. I WENT BACK TO JANUARY 12TH,
PULLED OUT THIS ITEM THAT SEEMS TO ME COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN
THE ONLINE VERSION OF THE COMMITTEE REPORT. THE EXCUSE THIS IS TO
SAVE PAPER SEEMS SILLY GIVEN NO PAPER IS BEING USED AT ALL AND HAS
NOT BEEN FOR OVER A YEAR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE LINKS TO THE
ATTACHMENTS CAN BE INCLUDED. AND NOW TO THE POINT, JEFFERSON
PARK, HOUSING AUTHORITY AS PART OF THEIR REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE,
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT DEMOLISHING ALL OF THE BUILDINGS AT
JEFFERSON PARK. THEY SHOW IMAGES OF THE DETERIORATING CONDITIONS.
THEY DIDN'T SHOW THE NEW ELEVATORS, $350,000 WORTH OF NEW
ELEVATORS, THEY DIDN'T SHOW THE GREEN ROOFS, WHITE ROOFS, NO
REPOINTING OF THE BRICKS, THEY DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING THAT HAD BEEN
DONE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT
APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN MANY OF
THE UNITS, ESPECIALLY THE BASEMENT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME NOW.
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE DON'T TEAR DOWN ALL BUILDINGS WITHOUT A
CAREFUL LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD PRESERVE SOME OF THE
BUILDINGS AND EXEMPLIFY BETTER STEWARDSHIP OF THE MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS INVESTED IN JEFFERSON PARK. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO BERNICE. BERNICE?
>> PARTICIPANT: UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU DO HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ARE YOU THERE?
>> PARTICIPANT: GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: GOOD EVENING. KEN REEVES. I'M BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
TO SPEAK TO POLICY ORDER 3, THE HOUSING BOND. I WAS THRILLED THAT
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN WORKING TOGETHER
CAN PUT THIS NOTION TOGETHER FOR THE CIVIC CIRCLE SO WE CAN CREATE
A STATE THAT THE PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE HERE.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSURE THAT RIGHT. ON
BEHALF OF MYSELF AS A CITIZEN AND ON BEHALF OF THE CAMBRIDGE
BRANCH OF THE NACP, WE JUST WANT TO CELEBRATE THIS EPIPHANY, THERE
ARE THINGS WE CAN DO IF WE THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX THAT WILL
PROTECT THE LONGEVITY OF CAMBRIDGE CITIZENS TO REMAIN IN THEIR CITY.
CAMBRIDGE HAS TO BE A GOVERNMENT OF INNOVATION. THIS IS AN
EXAMPLE OF REALLY EXCELLENT INNOVATION. THE AUTHORS ARE TO BE
CONGRATULATED AND I'M HOPEFUL THE COUNCIL WILL JOIN WITH THEM TO
SEE IF THIS BOND ISSUE IDEA CAN BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. I THANK YOU

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: SO MOVED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOTION BY VICE MAYOR MALLON ON SUSPENSION.
ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> CITY MANAGER: GOOD EVENING. I WANTED TO START OFF BY
APOLOGIZING FOR NOT GETTING THIS ON THE ORIGINAL AGENDA. IT WAS MY
MISTAKE. THERE WAS NO INTENT TO WAIT TWO WEEKS. I WILL THANK THE
MAYOR AND THE CITY CLERK FOR ALLOWING US TO MAKE THAT
ADJUSTMENT. THE BRIEF COMMENTS, ALONG WITH CLAUDE'S
PRESENTATION WILL ADDRESS THE COUNCIL'S QUESTIONS. SINCE MY LAST
REPORT ON APRIL 12, CAMBRIDGE HAS SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE
SEVEN-DAY AVERAGE FOR CONFIRMED CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND.
TODAY WE ARE REPORTING 8.3 CASES COMPARED TO 20.8 ON APRIL 12TH.
ADDITIONALLY, THE PERCENT OF POSITIVITY IS THE SAME AT OVER ONE HALF
OF 1% AS REPORTED ON APRIL 22 IN THE COMMONWEALTH'S REPORT.
AS OF TODAY, THE SEVEN-DAY AVERAGE OF PERCENT OF POSITIVITY FROM
THE COMMONWEALTH HAS DECREASED TO 1.72 FROM 2.03 ON THE 12TH.
I'M PLEASED THE NUMBERS ARE TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ON
APRIL 19, ALL RESIDENTS AGES 16 AND OLDER BECAME ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE
THE COVID-19 VACCINE. AS A REMINDER, IT IS FREE. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS
TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND THOSE AROUND YOU FROM GETTING SICK IS TO
GET VACCINATED.
I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT ACCORDINGLY TO THE STATE'S LATEST WEEKLY
COVID-19 MUNICIPALITY VACCINATION, AS OF APRIL 13, 50% OF CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE. UP 19%
FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK. AND 27 ARE FULLY VACCINATED, UP 12.5 FROM
THE PREVIOUS WEEK. THIS WEEK REPORTING MARKS THE FIRST HIGH
PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS WHO AT LEAST ONE DOSE MOVED ABOVE THE
STATEWIDE AVERAGE. CLAUDE WILL SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS
ABOUT THE VACCINES. I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THE TEAM HAS DONE
TO REACH OUT TO THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO SUPPORT THEM


PAGE 18

April 26, 2021

RECEIVING VACCINES AS WILL BE SEEN IN THE CHARTS THAT CLAUDE WILL
EXPLAIN. I'M PLEASED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE VACCINATED WILL GROW
AND PROUD OF THE CITY'S OUTREACH EFFORTS. THE CITY CONTINUES TO
OFFER SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FREE COVID-19 TESTING TO OUR RESIDENTS.
THE DATA COMING OUT THAT THE STATE IS STILL TRENDING IN A POSITIVE
DIRECTION, I WILL BE ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH
TEAM, EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL, AND MY INTERNAL TEAM ABOUT WHEN THE
CITY WILL BEGIN TO LIFT OUR REOPENING RESTRICTIONS AND ALIGN OUR
REOPENINGS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. I EXPECT TO MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. I WILL ASK OUR RESIDENTS TO
REMAIN VIGILANT AND DON'T LET THE GUARD DOWN. WEAR MASKS, WASH
YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY, PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND LIMIT SIZE
OF GATHERINGS. AND BEFORE I TURN TO CLAUDE, I WILL CONGRATULATE
HIM FOR BEING NAMED AS THE NEW DIRECTOR OF METROPOLITAN HEALTH
DISTRICT. CLAUDE PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE AND PROVIDED ME INVALUABLE
COUNSEL THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU THE
NUMBER OF PHONE CALLS AND MEETINGS I HAD WITH CLAUDE. UNDER HIS
LEADERSHIP, AS CAMBRIDGE'S CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND
CAMBRIDGE'S PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS ACHIEVED NATIONAL
ACCREDITATION AND RECOGNITION. THE COMMITMENT TO HEALTH, EQUITY,
AND RACIAL JUSTICE, FOCUS CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH WORK ON
ELIMINATES DISPARITIES. I KNOW THAT CLAUDE WILL BRING THE SAME
INSIGHT AND ENERGY IN HIS NEW ROLE TO BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF SAN
ANTONIO. I WILL MISS CLAUDE WHEN HE DEPARTS THE CITY AS HE IS A
VALUABLE MEMBER OF MY TEAM. I WILL TRULY MISS THE NONPANDEMIC
RELATED TALKS ABOUT LIFE AND THE LAUGHS. CITY OF CAMBRIDGE OWE
CLAUDE GRATITUDE FOR LEADING US AND KEEPING THE COMMUNITY SAFE.
THE COVID-19 VACCINE ROLLOUT UNDERWAY AND A LOW PERCENT
POSITIVITY IN THE COMMUNITY, CLAUDE IS DEPARTING KNOWING THE
LEADERSHIP HAS POSITION CAMBRIDGE TO BE SAFE. AGAIN, CLAUDE, THANK
YOU AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CLAUDE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU, JUST LIKE TO THANK THE
CITY MANAGER FOR THE KIND WORDS. AND IN PARTICULAR, REALLY
APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AS WELL AS DR. ASSAAD SAYAH OVER THE COURTS
OF THE PANDEMIC. I WILL CIRCUMSTANCE BACK TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
JOURNEY. LET ME DIVE IN AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE CITY
MANAGER AND MY TEAM FOR THE SUPPORT OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST
YEAR AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST 14 YEARS.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WILL GIVE THE FORMAL REPORT. I'M JOINED BY DR.
DOBBERTEEN, OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP FOR ANY
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, JUST KNOW THAT IT IS AN UNUSUAL FEW WEEKS. I DID WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITH THE RESUMPTION OF THE USE OF THE JOHNSON
& JOHNSON VACCINE, AS A TEMPORARY PAUSE, THEY RECOMMENDED THE
USE OF THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE TO RESUME ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES AS OF THIS WEEKEND. HOWEVER, WOMEN YOUNGER THAN 50 YEARS


PAGE 19

April 26, 2021

OLD, ESPECIALLY -- SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE RARE RISK OF BLOOD CLOTS
WITH LOW PLATELETS AFTER VACCINATION AND THE OTHER VACCINES ARE
AVAILABLE WHERE THE RISK IS NOT SEEN. THIS SNAPSHOT AS I SHARED EACH
TIME, WE PROVIDE THIS UPDATE, TO DATE WE HAVE OVER 6,000 REPORTED
CASES AMONG RESIDENTS. AND SADLY, I HAVE TO REPORT WE HAVE
REPORTED ONE ADDITIONAL FATALITY. THIS IS A FIRST IN OVER THE COURSE
OF THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS. WE ARE NOW AT 122 REPORTED FATALITIES
AMONG RESIDENTS. AND WHILE AS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE CITY
MANAGER, THINGS ARE LOOKING BACKWARD AS WE HEAD IN A DOWNWARD
DIRECTION. ROUGHLY ABOUT THE EIGHT OR NINE CASES PER HUNDRED
THOUSAND, THIS IS WHERE THE CITY WAS THE LAST TIME -- THIS TIME LAST
YEAR. AND WE ARE PLEASED BY THE TREND, BUT WE CANNOT LET OUR
GUARD DOWN. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO VACCINATE RESIDENTS AND
AREN'T LET UP ON MASK WEARING, PHYSICAL DISTANCING, AND GOOD HAND
HYGIENE.
AS I MENTIONED, WE HAD THE 122 REPORTED FATALITIES. KEEP IN MIND, 46
HAVE OCCURRED IN THE COMMUNITY, THE LION SHARE, 76 HAVE OCCURRED
IN THE LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH
THE FAMILIES AT THIS TIME AND KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE
HAVE BEEN MONITORING OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AND AS THE CITY
MANAGER MENTIONED, OVERALL POSITIVITY AS THE LAST REPORTING PERIOD
AT POINT 06 PERCENT OR LESS THAN ONE HALF PERCENT.
THIS IS A SNAPSHOT TALKING ABOUT THE VARIANTS AND WHAT WE SEE
ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH AND HERE IN THE CITY. APRIL 12, THE CDC IS
NO LONGER PROVIDING AN INDIVIDUAL VARIANT CASE COUNTS FOR STATES.
THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND THE
MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BELIEVE THAT PREVALENT
ESTIMATES AS YOU SEE AND AVAILABLE ON THE WEB, GIVE A MORE
ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE PENETRATION OF VARIANTS OF CONCERNS. THE
STATE HEALTH COLLEAGUES SHARED WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
LAST WEEK THAT OVERALL THE NEWS IS GOOD SO FAR REGARDING THE
SPREAD OF VARIANTS. MASSACHUSETTS HAS NOT REACHED A TIPPING POINT
WITH ANY VARIANTS, INCLUDING THE VARIANT B.1.1.7. WE'LL CONTINUE TO
MONITOR THE DATA CLOSELY AS WE REPORT OUT EACH WEEK TO THE
COUNCIL. NEXT SLIDE.
TESTING HAS BEEN DECLINING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. AT THE
HEIGHT OF THE HOLIDAY SURGE, AN AVERAGE OVER A THOUSAND TESTS A
DAY WERE ADMINISTERED AT THE CITY-RUN SITES. THE AVERAGE TEST
NUMBER IS DECLINING SINCE JANUARY, BUT REMAINS ABOVE TESTING LEVELS
IN NOVEMBER. AS OF THIS MONTH, THEY AVERAGE ABOUT 678 TESTS PER
DAY. KEEP IN MIND, THERE'S MORE AND MORE TEENS AND ADULTS GET
VACCINATED, THIS DECLINE IN TESTING IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT SCHOOL VACATION WAS THIS PAST WEEK AND THE
MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY IS A FEW WEEKS AWAY, WE'LL CONTINUE TO
MAINTAIN OUR TESTING PROGRAM AT THE CURRENT LEVEL FOR THE COMING
WEEKS SO THAT'S FOUR SITES IN THE CITY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND WE'LL


PAGE 20

April 26, 2021

MONITOR AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS WE SEE FIT. SPECIAL THANKS TO THE
PARTNERS AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, PRO-EMS AND APPLAUD OUR TEAM
FOR HELPING US NAVIGATE SINCE LAST SUMMER IN PROVIDING THIS
UNIVERSAL TESTING IN THE CITY. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, REGARDING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASKED A
QUESTION, AT THIS POINT IN THE PANDEMIC, THERE'S EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE
ON MASK USE OUTDOORS AND THE RISK OF COVID-19 TRANSMISSION. BEING
OUTDOORS AND NOT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY FOR PROLONGED PERIOD IS A
LOW-RISK ACTIVITY. THE QUESTION BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN, IF THE
GOVERNOR LIFT THE MASK MANDATE, WILL CAMBRIDGE FOLLOW SUIT? TO
PUT INTO CONTEXT, THIS WEEKEND, YESTERDAY -- DR. FAUCI SAID THE CDC
MAY UPDATE OUTDOOR MASK GUIDANCE SOON. THE CDC RECOMMENDS
THAT PEOPLE WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC SETTINGS AND WHEN AROUND
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HOUSES. THE CURRENT
MASSACHUSETTS RESTRICTIONS GO BEYOND THE CDC GUIDANCE AND
REQUIRE ALL PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF FIVE TO WEAR A MASK OUTDOORS,
UNLESS EATING OR DRINKING.
THE ANTICIPATED NEW CDC GUIDANCE IS BASED ON A GROWING BODY OF
EVIDENCE THAT THE RISK IS LOW. IF MASSACHUSETTS WERE TO LOOSEN ITS
OUTDOOR MASKING REQUIREMENTS, A REMINDER, THE CITY WOULD MAKE A
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER CAMBRIDGE WOULD FOLLOW SUIT BASED
ON THE CONTENT OF THE NEW MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THIS DECISION
WOULD BE MADE BY THE CITY MANAGER IN CONSULTATION WITH THE
LEADERSHIP TEAM, DR. ASSAAD SAYAH, AS WELL AS THE COVID-19 EXPERT
ADVISORY PANEL.
WE ARE NOT IN DISAGREEMENT THAT IN GENERAL THE RISK OF
TRANSMISSION OUTDOORS IS LOW. HOWEVER IF THEY ARE RELAXED, THERE
ARE A FEW SITUATIONS TO GIVE ADDITIONAL THOUGHT. ON THE SLIDE,
THESE INCLUDE SOCIALIZING OUTDOORS OR ATTENDING CROWDED EVENTS
OUTDOORS. SUCH AS BACKYARD PARTIES, CONCERTS, OR RALLIES. EATING
OUTDOORS, ESPECIALLY WITH UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS FROM
DIFFERENT HOUSES OR PLAYING CONTACT SPORTS. WE'D BE CONCERNED
ABOUT UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS PLAYING CLOSE CONTACT SPORTS
OUTDOORS, SOCCER AND PICKUP BASKETBALL GAMES. WE'LL MONITOR THE
SITUATION AND KEEP THE COUNCIL APPRISED OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS
THROUGH THE CITY MANAGER.
NEXT SLIDE. MAYOR SIDDIQUI ASKED ABOUT INDOOR DINING AND IN
PARTICULAR, QUESTIONS BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT CPHD STAFF MET WITH
RESTAURANT OWNERS TO GET FEEDBACK ON THE STRATEGIES TO HELP
RESTAURANTS ON GUIDANCE FOR AIR QUALITY OR POSTERS THAT CAN
MOTIVATE SAFE DINING BEHAVIORS. USING MASK BY STAFF AND ASSESSING
AIR TURNOVER AND FILTERS ARE DISCUSSED AS POSITIVE STEPS. THE SAFETY
MEASURE THE ARE CRUCIAL TO KEEP RESTAURANTS OPEN. THE PANEL
AGREED ANY WAY TO CONVINCE ESTABLISHMENTS WITH INDOOR DINING TO
COLLECT CONTACT INFORMATION FROM ALL PARTIES WILL BE CRUCIAL
DURING FOLLOW-UP CONTACT TRACING.


PAGE 21

April 26, 2021

THE MAYOR ASKED WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS ON THE DISCUSSIONS.
HIGHLIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE SLIDE. OUR DEPARTMENT IS PILOTING
LIMITED ON-SITE AIR QUALITY ASSESSMENTS OF INTERESTED RESTAURANTS
IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE. THEY WILL LOOK AT AIR TURNOVER RATES AND
THE MOST EFFECTIVE PLACEMENT OF UNITS. AND IF THEY FIND IT HELPFUL,
WE'LL LOOK TO EXPAND TO OTHER COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS. THE CITY IS
PURCHASING A SMALL QUANTITY OF TESTED MASKS AND THOSE WHO ARE
UNVACCINATED. STAFF CONTINUES TO COMMUNICATE WITH RESTAURANTS
ABOUT THE STATE'S CONTACT TRACING REQUIREMENTS. INSPECTORS HAVE
REGULARLY COMMUNICATED WITH RESTAURANTS ABOUT THE CONTACT
TRACING REQUIREMENTS. THEY HAVE ALSO SENT EMAIL BLASTS ABOUT
CONTACT TRACING REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WENT TO LEAD CONTACTS AT
THE RESTAURANTS. AND THE STAFF ADVICE MANAGEMENT OF EVERY
CONTACT TRACING REQUIREMENTS.
I WILL ADDRESS UPDATE AND HESITANCY AMONG YOUNGER POPULATIONS.
WE HAVE OBSERVED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS. THIS REALLY
COMPLETES THE THIRD PHASE. PHASE ONE ROLLOUT OF THE ELIGIBILITY, WE
HAVE MADE IT THROUGH THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOR PHASE TWO AND
THAT WAS A MIX. AND NOW WE ARE AT PHASE THREE. ANYONE 16 YEARS
AND OLDER IS NOW OFFICIALLY ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED.
SO, REGARDING THE COMMONWEALTH. MASSACHUSETTS CURRENTLY
RANKS NUMBER TWO FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE AND NUMBER NINE ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS WHO ARE FULLY VACCINATED.
KEEP IN MIND, WE CONTINUE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE STATE. WE SEE
THAT NEARLY HALF OF RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE. THE
VACCINE SUPPLY HAS INCREASED. DELIVERIES TO THE STATE AND THE DOSES
THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE, AT LEAST FOR DIFFERENT VACCINATIONS CLINICS
IN THE COMMONWEALTH, AND AS I MENTIONED, ALL RESIDENTS 16 AND
OLDER ARE NOW ELIGIBLE. AND THIS IS A REMINDER THAT FOLKS CAN BOOK
AN APPOINTMENT AT A MASS VACCINATION SITE. AND THEN THEY CAN CALL
2-1-1 FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE READILY ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.
SO, WITH REGARDS TO CLOSER TO HOME WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ON
THE GROUND HERE IN THE CITY THANKS TO THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE
CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE, 90% OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED A
FIRST DOSE OF THE MODERNA HAVE ALSO RECEIVED A SECOND DOSE. WE
HAVE ADMINISTERED OVER 5,800 DOSES OF VACCINES SINCE WE FIRST
BEGAN VACCINATING FIRST RESPONDERS BACK ON JANUARY 11. SHOUT-OUT
TO PRO-EMS AND FIRE. AND NOW THE PAUSE ON THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON
VACCINE IS LIFTED, THE CITY-RUN VACCINE CLINICS ARE BEING PLANNED, A
RETURN TO NORTH CAMBRIDGE AND ROUGHLY 30 HOMEBOUND
INDIVIDUALS. NEXT SLIDE.
WITH REGARDS TO VACCINATION BY RACE AND ETHNICITY, WE HAVE
REPORTED THIS OUT EACH WEEK. BASED ON THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE
STATE. AS OF APRIL 20, 50% RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE
OUTPACING THE STATE. AND THAT WE BELIEVE IS A FIRST. KEEP IN MIND,


PAGE 22

April 26, 2021

OVER A QUARTER OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED.
CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO OUTPACE THE COMMONWEALTH IN
VACCINATING BLACK AND LATINX RESIDENTS. DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD. LOOK AT
HOW WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR VACCINATION TRENDS BY RACE
AND ETHNICITY, WE MADE PROGRESS IN THE SPACE AND THAT IS BY DESIGN.
IN ADDITION, WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE RESIDENTS IDENTIFYING AS ASIAN
OR MULTIRACIAL RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE HAS INCREASED
NOTABLY SINCE THE LAST REPORT TO THE COUNCIL ON THE 12TH. SPECIAL
SHOUT-OUT TO THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CORPS, AMBASSADORS, AND
THE GAGGLE OF PARTNERS ON THE GROUND WHO HELP US TO SPREAD THE
WORD TO ENSURE AND ADDRESS THE VACCINE HESITANCY WHILE WE
ADDRESS THIS HICCUP OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS AS REPORTED NATIONWIDE.
CONTINUE ON THE TREND, CAMBRIDGE IS OUTPACING THE STATE IN EVERY
CATEGORY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF A DIFFERENT AGE BREAKDOWN. IN
THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE BY AGE AND GENDER, WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT
LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. THE VACCINATION AND COMMUNICATION
OUTREACH IS EFFECTIVE AND WE'LL CONTINUE ON THIS PATH. AGAIN, THE
SHUTOUT TO THE PARTNERS AT THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE,
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, AND THE ANCHORS -- LEE GIANETTI AND THE
COMMUNICATION TEAM AND THE MANAGER'S OFFICE. IT TAKES A VILLAGE
TO DO THIS AND I CAN'T SAY THANKS ENOUGH FOR THEIR SUPPORT.
WITH THIS, COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASKED TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
PROGRESS IN VACCINATING CITY RESIDENTS. FIRST QUESTION IS, NOW THAT
ANYONE OVER 16 CAN GET A VACCINE, WE ARE OVER THE 50% INITIAL DOSE,
ANY SENSE THAT THERE IS RESISTANCE TO GETTING THE VACCINE? SO, THIS IS
A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW SINCE THERE IS ROLLING
ELIGIBILITY FOR VACCINATION BASED ON AGE, OCCUPATION, AND HEALTH
STATUS, UP UNTIL THIS PAST MONDAY WHEN EVERYBODY AGES 16 AND
OLDER IS ELIGIBLE. WE'LL HAVE MORE CLEARER PICTURE OF DEMOGRAPHICS
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE VACCINE HESITANCY AS WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS
THIS IN THE COMING WEEKS. THAT SAID, THE DATA SO FAR LOOKED VERY
PROMISING. WITH REGARD TO AGE, WE SEE HIGH VACCINE SEEKING
BEHAVIORS IN ALL ELIGIBLE AGE GROUPS. IN THE ALL-AGE CATEGORIES WE
OUTPACE THE STATE. LOOKING AT RESIDENTS 65 AND OLDER, THIS IS A
GROUP THAT WAS ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINATION SINCE MID-FEBRUARY. WE
SEEING A VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF RESIDENTS IN THE POPULATION HAD
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. WE SEE OVER -- 94% FOR 75 AND
OLDER AND THOSE 65-74 AT 87%.
WITH REGARD TO GENDER, WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE GAP BETWEEN
WOMEN AND MEN WHO GOT THE VACCINE -- IT IS SMALL. AND SOME
MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITIES, THE GAP IS AS MUCH AS 10% BETWEEN
WOMEN AND MEN WHO GOTTEN THE FIRST DOSE OF THE VACCINE. WE DO
SEE A BIGGER GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WHEN IT COMES TO WHO IS
FULLY VACCINATED. 30% OF CAMBRIDGE WOMEN WERE FULLY VACCINATED
COMPARED TO 24% OF MEN. IT IS HARD TO PARSE OUT IF IT IS DUE TO MEN
WAITING LONGER AND THUS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A SECOND DOSE. OR IF THIS


PAGE 23

April 26, 2021

IS A GREAT PROPORTION OF MEN THAN WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO HOLD OFF
OR NOT GET A SECOND DOSE.
IN THE COMING WEEKS, WE EXPECT MORE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND
MEDICAL COMMUNITIES WILL PAY MORE ATTENTION TO MEN AND WHY
SOME MEN ARE HESITATING OR REFUSING VACCINATION. COUNCILLOR
NOLAN HAD A SECOND QUESTION, WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT HAS ANY
THOUGHTS ON HOW TO ENSURE THAT ALL RESIDENTS ELIGIBLE GET THE
VACCINE.
I WILL MENTION, WE STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT ALL RESIDENTS RECEIVE THE
VACCINE, WE ARE AIMING TO GET THAT DONE BY THE SUMMER. KEEP IN THE
MIND, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOESN'T MANDATE ANY VACCINE, INCLUDING
COVID-19 VACCINES FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION. PLUS, THERE IS NO
WAY TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS WILL GET THE VACCINE.
HOWEVER, WE CAN AND WILL ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE THE VACCINES AS
WE HAVE BEEN DOING. WE DO NEED EVERYBODY, RESIDENTS, COMMUNITY
LEADERS AND OFFICIALS, TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THE VACCINES. PEOPLE
NEED TO HEAR FROM THE FOLKS AND THE TRUSTED SOURCES IN THE CITY.
THAT BEING SAID, OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY WILL WORK HARD TO
RAISE AWARENESS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF VACCINATION WITH A
FOCUS ON NEIGHBORHOODS HARDEST HIT AND AMONG GROUPS WHERE WE
BELIEVE THERE COULD BE MORE HESITANCY ABOUT VACCINATION AND WE'LL
LOOK AT THE DATA AS REPORTED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND
THAT IS THE KEY TO MAKE OUR COMMUNICATION DECISIONS.
NEXT SLIDE. AND I'M WRAPPING UP THE REPORT. REGARDING
COMMUNICATIONS. MORE TARGETED COMMUNICATIONS BEGINS TO
SPECIFIC GROUPS BASED ON THE STATE'S AND CITY'S DATA. PEOPLE OF
COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING INDIVIDUALS AND
LOWER-INCOME INDIVIDUALS FACE BARRIERS TO GET VACCINATED. THE CITY
WILL TARGET COMMUNICATIONS TO PLACES WHERE FOLKS WORK, LIVE,
WORSHIP, SEEK SERVICES, AND SHOP. WE HAVE DIFFERENT GROUPINGS.
WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS, LIKE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,
CAMBRIDGE NONPROFIT COALITION, ESPECIALLY TARGET RESTAURANTS,
CAFE STAFF, WORKERS IN GROCERY STORES, WORKING WITH PARTNERS IN
THE HOUSING SECTORS, JUST A START, AND OTHER HOUSING, FAITH-BASED
ORGANIZATIONS, THE CAMBRIDGE MOSQUES AND MAKE SURE TO KEEP AN
ACTIVE LISTSERV WITH FAITH-BASED LEADERS. NONPROFITS, THE MARGARET
FULLER HOUSE AND OTHER SETTLEMENT HOUSES IN THE CITY HAVE BEEN
INVALUABLE TO HELP US, ESPECIALLY ANCHORED TO THE FOOD PANTRY AND
THE ARRAY OF CITY PROGRAMS AND THE GROCERY STORES.
THIS HAS BEEN A MULTIDIMENSIONAL, MULTIFACETED OUTREACH EFFORT IN
COMMUNICATING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF THE DIVERSE COMMUNITY. AT
THE END OF THE DAY, THE PROPORTION OF RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVED THE
FIRST DOSE INCREASES ACROSS EACH AGE BRACKET, WHICH IS WHAT WE
SHOW. IT IS EXPECTED GIVEN THAT OLDER RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN YOUNGER RESIDENTS. I WILL PAUSE
AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE CONTINUE OUR COMMUNITY FORUMS WITH

PAGE 24

April 26, 2021

THE CLINICIAN SPEAKER BUREAU AND WE ARE PLANNING A COMMUNITY
FORUM IN SPANISH AND IN HAITIAN CREOLE. LAST TWO SLIDES.
REGARDING SCHOOLS. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE STEADY PROGRESS. WE
HAVE DOING THIS SINCE LAST FALL. WE HAD OVER 1,500 UNIQUE ADULTS
TESTED OF CPS STAFF. ADMINISTERED OVER 26,000 TESTS. STUDENTS, OVER
1,400 CHILDREN TESTED. WE ADMINISTERED OVER 6,000 TESTS AMONG
THAT POPULATION. AND WE HAVE DOCUMENTED 60,000 CASES IDENTIFIED
THROUGH OUR -- 60 POSITIVE POOL TESTING, WE ADMINISTERED 300
TESTING POOLS AND SWABBED 1,800 CHILDREN. WE TRIED TO SHARE WITH
THE COUNCIL BESIDES THE NUMBERS WE HAVE ANECDOTES AND THANK YOU
BY RESIDENTS. THIS IS THE LATEST WE RECEIVED AS REPORTED TO OUR
ASSOCIATE CHIEF OF CLINICAL SERVICES. THE P MY HUSBAND AND I WERE
VERY FORTUNATE AND GRATEFUL TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVED
VACCINATION IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH ADMINISTERED BY THE TEAM. WE
WERE RECEIVED WITH A FRIENDLY WELCOME AND REASSURING MANNER.
ALL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED WITH PATIENCE AND CARE. WE WERE AT
EASE. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THEM AND TO THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION TO
GIVE US HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS AHEAD. THIS SPEAKS VOLUMES. WE HEAR
THIS MORE AND MORE. SPRING IS IN THE AIR. VACCINES, WE GET SHOTS IN
ARM. FATIGUE IS REAL AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK AND
APPRECIATE THE RESIDENTS AND PARTNERS WHO HAVE PROVIDED THEIR
COMMENTARY TO US.
IN CLOSING, I'D LIKE TO SHARE A BRIEF COMMENTARY IN TERMS OF THE
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE CITY MANAGER SHARED WITH THE COUNCIL.
REALLY, IT IS SERVING AS THE CITY'S -- IT IS ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING
EXPERIENCE OF MY CAREER. A TRAINED AS PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS
AND GAIN THE INSIGHT OF SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT HEALTH
ENTERPRISES, ESPECIALLY THE PAST 14 YEARS. I'M PROUD OF THE
DEPARTMENT'S VERY TALENTED AND CARING STAFF WHO WORKED
TIRELESSLY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DURING THIS PANDEMIC THIS
PAST YEAR. SO, AS A RESULT, AS YOU HEARD, OUR DEPARTMENT'S
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE MADE POSSIBLE BY THE MYRIAD OVER THE
PROGRAM FUNCTIONS -- ENVIRONMENTAL, STAFF, ET CETERA, TO ENSURE
THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ALL RESIDENTS. I THANK THE CITY
MANAGER AND DR. ASSAAD SAYAH FOR THEIR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT. AS I
SHARED, I AM ENERGIZED BY THEIR EXAMPLE AND RESOLVE, ESPECIALLY
DURING THE UNPRECEDENTED TIME. OUR MODEL PRACTICES AND
APPROACHES ARE RECOGNIZED LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY, THANKS IN LARGE
PART TO THE LEADERSHIP, BUT BECAUSE OF THE ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS
THAT HAVE TOUCHED EVERY ASPECT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE
RESIDENTS. FOR THIS I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS A
HEALTH OFFICER FOR ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATE CITIES AND FEEL THIS IS
THE APPROPRIATE -- MOST APPROPRIATE TIME TO MAKE THE TRANSITION. I
HAVE DEVELOPED A GREATER APPRECIATION FOR THE RESILIENCE OF THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY AND CONFIDENT IN THE CONTINUED SUCCESS.
FOR THAT, I WILL END AND SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND


PAGE 25

April 26, 2021

NOW WE'LL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE SERVICE. THIS IS NOT GOODBYE
TODAY. WE STILL HAVE YOU FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS. WE CAN CERTAINLY
SAY GOODBYES AT A LATER POINT. I WILL START WITH CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL. I SEE THAT -- IS THAT COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
NO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS ALSO TO CITY
MANAGER AND STAFF FOR THIS UPDATE. I WANT TO CLARIFY, I HEARD MR.
JACOB SAY THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OUR 122 FATALITY. I DIDN'T SEE
THAT ON THE WEBSITE YET. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE TO HEAR THAT BAD
NEWS. I KNOW THE VARIANT B.1.1.7, 31%, WHICH IS NOT TRIVIAL, WE ARE
AWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN INDIA RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS
UNFORTUNATELY AFFECTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF
MY FAMILY.
I CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT OUR NUMBERS ARE DOWN. I HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THE REGIONAL DATA AS WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS THE TREND
AND WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE FOR THAT. I DO WORRY THAT IF WE USE
THAT AS A REASON TO REOPEN TOO QUICKLY WE CAN GET BACK INTO
TROUBLE. MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT? IS THE TREND
CONTINUES AND WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO ZERO, I THINK WE'D FEEL
BETTER ABOUT REOPENING. UNTIL THAT, HOW DO WE DECIDE WHETHER
WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN TO SOME EXTENT OR NOT?
>> CITY MANAGER: I CAN JUMP IN AND CLAUDE WILL FOLLOW. WE HAVE A
SCHEDULED MEETING TOMORROW TO LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT
WE HAVE. WE DID NOTIFY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. IF THE NUMBERS
CONTINUE TO GO IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION, WE'D BECOME MORE IN LINE
WITH WHAT ALL THE OTHER CITIES ARE DOING, EXCEPT FOR BOSTON AND
SOMERVILLE. WE'LL HAVE THAT MEETING. AND WE'LL TALK TO DR. ASSAAD
SAYAH AFTER THAT. WE'LL TALK TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND
DETERMINE IF THERE IS A PARTIAL LESSENING OF WHAT WE DO, A FULL
LESSENING, IS IT THE RIGHT TIME? DO WE WAIT UNTIL WEEK OR TWO?
THAT'S THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE, THERE'S NO DETERMINATION THAT IS
MADE. WE DID FEEL LIKE BASED ON WHAT WE SAID AND WHAT WE TOLD
PEOPLE, IT IS TIME TO HAVE AN APPROPRIATE DISCUSSION OF WHERE WE ARE
AND WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP. AND NO DECISION IS MADE AND I TALKED TO
CLAUDE ABOUT THIS THREE TIMES OVER THE WEEKEND. CLAUDE, I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU. TO THE QUESTION, SO CLEARLY BEING
CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE HAVE BEEN VERY MEASURED IN OUR APPROACH
OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR, THIS WOULDN'T BE THE TIME TO DEVIATE
FROM THAT PLAN. WE ARE CONFERRING WITH THE EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL
LATER THIS WEEK. WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NARRATIVE
NATIONALLY. WE ARE PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE STATE AND ANY
MODIFICATIONS OR GUIDANCE. JUST LIKE I SHARED, WE ARE MONITORING
THE SITUATION REGULARLY. AND THEN WE'LL CONFER WITH THE CITY

PAGE 26

April 26, 2021

MANAGER AND DR. SAYAH TO SEE IF WE HAVE TO ADJUST THE APPROACH.
WE HAVE BEEN MEASURED, MORE CONSERVATIVE, AND CONSISTENT OVER
THE COURSE OF TIME. THE NUMBERS AND THE NARRATIVES SPEAK FOR
THEMSELVES.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SADLY THAT ONE--THE ADDITIONAL FATALITY AS
REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT, YOU SHOULD SEE THAT UPDATED ON THE
WEBSITE. WE ARE AT 122. WE KEEP THE FAMILY THOUGHTS IN OUR
PRAYERS. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE TWO COMMENTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN IN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE WEBSITE IS NOT UPDATED YET AND I THINK THE
NEWS OF THAT JUST WENT OUT AT 1:21. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT
INFORMATION UPDATED FOR THE PUBLIC. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR
TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I ASKED TO RECOGNIZE BEFORE YOU
SAID THIS WAS CLARIFYING QUESTION. IF IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO DO
THAT AT ANOTHER MEETING, CAN I WITHHOLD THOSE COMMENTS AT THE
TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK SO. WE HAVE A LOT TO COVER. WE'LL COME
BACK TO OUR GOODBYES AT A FUTURE MEETING. AND DO IT THOROUGHLY.
IF THERE ARE NO OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, ON THE MOTION BY
COUNCILLOR CARLONE, WE CAN PLACE ON FILE THE AGENDA ITEM AND THE
COMMUNICATION REPORTS FROM OTHER CITY OFFICERS ON FILE. ROLL CALL
ON PLACING THOSE ON FILE.

Place city manager agenda #12
and communications and
reports from other city officers
#2 on file

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: (SILENT).
>> MR. CLERK: EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER NUMBER 8. (READING CITY
MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 8).
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR PLACING THIS ON
THE AGENDA. IT WAS A WELCOME SIGHT ON THE AGENDA. YOU ARE
WORKING ON THIS FOR A WHILE, PUTTING THIS TOGETHER FOR OUR SMALL
BUSINESS AND RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. I THINK WE ALL KNOW ALL OF US
WHO WORK IN THE FOOD WASTE WORLD, 40% OF ALL THE FOOD THAT IS
GROWN ACTUALLY GETS THROWN AWAY. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
ORGANIZES, LIKE FOOD FOR FREE, THAT I WORK WITH THAT TRY TO MITIGATE
THAT AND GET THE GOOD FOOD ABOUT TO BE THROWN AWAY OUT TO
PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. LARGE AMOUNT OF WHAT IS THROWN AWAY IS PLATE
WASTE, WHICH CANNOT BE DONATED TO THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED.

CITY MANAGER #8
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-16,
regarding creating a
Commercial Composting Pilot
program.

THIS IS A HUGE WIN FOR OUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY. SO MUCH OF THE
GREENE HOUSE GAS EMITTED FROM THAT PLATE WASTE THAT GOES TO OUR
LANDFILLS WILL BE MITIGATED WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND AT THE SAME


PAGE 27

April 26, 2021

TIME, OUR SMALL BUSINESS AND RESTAURANT COMMUNITY, WE KNOW THEY
ARE STRUGGLING SO HARD RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS
REALLY JUST AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK ON TWO
PARALLEL TRACKS OF THE CITY'S GOALS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS
FORWARD. I'M GLAD TO SEE IT'LL BE INCLUDED IN THE FY22 BUDGET FOR
100 SMALL RESTAURANTS MOVING FORWARD.
I DID WANT TO -- I THINK AS WE NOTED WHEN WE HAD OUR LAST
CONVERSATION, THERE WAS CONCERN IN THE COMMUNITY AROUND THE
DIGESTION AND WHICH PATH TO CHOOSE, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
WORKS -- THIS PRESENTATION TONIGHT AND REPORTS SAYS THAT WE'RE
MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE HOUSEHOLD COMPOSTING. IF THE
COMMISSIONER, THROUGH YOU, THE CITY MANAGER, WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT HOW THAT DECISION WAS MADE AND HOW WE ARE HERE AT THIS
MOMENT, I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE PUBLIC.
>> OWEN: THANK YOU, VICE MAYOR MALLON. BEFORE I START, I HAVE
THREE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS WITH ME.
JOHN, JOHN FITZGERALD, AND MICHAEL. MICHAEL IS RECYCLING DIRECTOR.
AND SO, THEY CAN ADD TO THE REMARKS THAT I MAKE.
WE HAVE BEEN USING THE CENTRALIZED ORGANIC RECYCLING FACILITY. THE
LOCATION IN CHARLESTOWN FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL COMPOST PROGRAM
FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A -- WE EXPECT
TO GET BACK UP AND RUNNING ON MAY 17TH OF THIS YEAR. THE DECISION
FOR US TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT AS THE PRIMARY LOCATION FOR FOOD
WASTE BASED ON FACTORS. PRIMARY ONE, IT COMES AS THE MOST HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED FOOD RECOVERY METHOD FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL
PERSPECTIVE.
AS RECOMMENDED BY EPA AND DEP AND WE GENERALLY LOOK TO THEM
FOR DIRECTION IN REGARD THIS. EPA PRODUCED A 200-PAGE REPORT IN THE
LAST YEAR THAT THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PLANT
AT THE GREATER LAWRENCE SEWER DISTRICT. AND ACROSS ALL
PARAMETERS, THEY FELT WHEN YOU NORMALIZE ALL OF THAT
INFORMATION, THOSE PARAMETERS, THE USE OF THE GREATER LAWRENCE
SEWER DISTRICT FOR THE PROCESSING OF FOOD WASTE WAS THE MOST
ENVIRONMENTALLY APPROPRIATE, GIVEN TO THE EXTENT WE SHOULD
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FOOD WASTE WE GENERATE.
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THAT. I THINK
THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHEN WE
THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT IS BEING UTILIZED. WE ARE EFFECTIVELY
USING THEIR ANAEROBIC DIGESTER TO GENERATE ELECTRICAL POWER TO BE
ABLE TO FULLY POWER THAT PLANT AND DELIVER EXCESS ENERGY BACK TO
THE GRID. THAT'S OFFSETTING FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY DEMAND AT THE
LOCATION.
THE OTHER THING, I KNOW THERE ARE SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE FACT THAT
SOME OF THE SOLIDS GENERATED THERE ARE USED AS FERTILIZER
ULTIMATELY. ONE THING TO SAY, IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN EXCESS OF


PAGE 28

April 26, 2021

90% OF FOOD WASTE IS CONVERTED INTO GAS IN THE DIGESTER. ABOUT 1%
OF THAT FOOD WASTE IS THEN MANUFACTURED INTO THE FERTILIZER
PELLETS. THE REMAINDER IS DISCHARGED BACK INTO THE RIVERS.
THE ONE AREA THAT I HAD CONCERN ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE OPERATION,
THERE'S AN INCREASING -- (INAUDIBLE), BUT IN CONVERSATION, THEY ARE
SAYING THEY ARE NOT SEEING THAT IN THE ACTUAL DISCHARGE FROM THE
PLANT ITSELF. POINT OF FACT, THEY CONTINUE TO MEET THE PERMIT FROM
THE EPA IN THAT REGARD. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THEY SEE AS
GENERATING THE AMOUNT OF BIOCHEMICAL DEMAND AS THE REPORT
STATES.
THE OTHER THING, PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS THAT WE LOOK AT ROOT
COMPOSTING. THE BIGGER ISSUE, THERE'S NO FACILITY IN THE
METROPOLITAN AREA OR ADJACENT TO THE METROPOLITAN AREA THAT CAN
HANDLE THE AMOUNT OF FOOD WASTE WE ANTICIPATE. WE ANTICIPATE
COLLECTING AT THIS POINT. WE EXPECT TO COLLECT BETWEEN 70-90 TONS
OF MATERIAL ON A WEEKLY BASIS ONCE WE BRING THE COMMERCIAL
COMPOSTING INTO PLAY.
OUR EXPECTATION, THE AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH
THAT WILL INCREASE ONCE THE COMMERCIAL COMPOSTING COMES INTO
OPERATION. GENERALLY, THAT IS OUR EXPERIENCE. THEY HAVE MUCH
BIGGER CHALLENGE IN TRYING TO MANAGE CONTAMINATION. THAT IS NOT
AN ISSUE. AND SO THOSE ARE THE PRIMARY REASONS THAT WE WANT TO
CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH -- MOVING FORWARD.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THROUGH YOU, THE COMMISSIONER
AND THE JOHNS, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS REPORT. AND
EXPLAINING TO US WHY YOU CAME TO THIS DECISION. I KNOW THAT FOR
ME, IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE LESS TRUCKS ON THE ROAD
AND MAKE THE ROADS SAFER FOR VULNERABLE ROAD USERS. USING TRUCKS
ALREADY ON THE ROAD IS MAYBE A SAFE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT. I'M
CURIOUS, HOW WILL PEOPLE APPLY? IT IS GOING TO BE CAPPED AT 100
RESTAURANTS. IS THERE A LOTTERY? I'M NOT CERTAIN ON HOW IT
HAPPENS?
>> OWEN: MAYBE I CAN HAND IT TO MICHAEL WHO CAN SPEAK IN MORE
DETAIL ABOUT HOW WE'LL HANDLE THE SELECTING THE RESTAURANTS.
>> MICHAEL: WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO APPROACH IT SIMILAR TO THE
SMALL, RECYCLE PROGRAM. WE'LL WORK WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
DIVISION AND A FEW OTHER DIVISIONS TO TRY TO GET THE WORD OUT TO AS
MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AS WE CAN ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. I THINK
INITIALLY, IT IT'LL BE A LOTTERY. IF WE DON'T -- IF WE DON'T GET TO 100,
WE'LL OBVIOUSLY SELECT EVERYBODY THAT HAS APPLIED.
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE BEEN 85 BUSINESSES IN THE SMALL BUSINESS RECYCLE
PROGRAM THAT ARE PRIMARILY RESTAURANT AND FOOD SERVICE. WE
EXPECT THOSE -- THAT IS ABOUT THE NUMBER WE EXPECT TO APPLY.
OBVIOUSLY, IT COULD GROW. WE WANT TO BE AWARE OF THE
MINORITY-OWNED AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES. NOT CHAIN

PAGE 29

April 26, 2021

RESTAURANT TYPE OF BUSINESSES. WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE THE TRUE
LOCAL BUSINESSES FIRST.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT IS MY NEXT QUESTION TO MAKE SURE WE
PRIORITIZE MINORITY-OWNED AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES THROUGH
THE PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR LIFTING UP AND SUPPORTING THAT. I WILL
GIVE A SHUTOUT TO CAMBRIDGE TABLE TO FARM FOR REALLY PUTTING
TOGETHER THEIR TEAM AND DOING THE RESEARCH AND REALLY DIGGING
INTO THIS ISSUE. AND BRINGING IT TO OUR ATTENTION AND MAKING SURE
WE MADE THIS A REALITY IN CAMBRIDGE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
ARE EXCITED THAT THE RESIDENT COMPOSTING PROGRAM IS COMING BACK
ON THE 17TH. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, IT IS COMING BACK ON THE 17TH.
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT PROGRAM BACK. IT WAS MISSED AND
THANK YOU FOR PULLING THIS FORWARD TONIGHT. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AND THEN COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: I WILL THANK THE CITY MANAGER AND THE
COMMISSIONER AND DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, AND MICHAEL, AND MY
COLLEAGUES FOR HAVING THIS BEFORE US. THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE. AND A LOT OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS
ASSOCIATIONS HAD INPUT INTO THIS. THIS IS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYBODY.
WIN-WIN FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THE CITY IS COMMITTED TO THE
ASSISTING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND FOR THE RESIDENTS AND FOR THE
CLIMATE ENVIRONMENT IN THE CITY. IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. I LOOK
FORWARD TO -- IT IS JUST A BEGINNING. I KNOW THE MANAGER IS
COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THE PROGRAM AND TO MANY OTHER SMALL
BUSINESSES IN THE CITY. IT IS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYBODY AND I WANT TO
THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND HAVING THIS BEFORE US
TO VOTE ON. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR
NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I FULLY SUPPORT AND
CELEBRATE THIS PROGRAM. I THINK IT IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD. WE HAVE
HEARD QUESTIONS ABOUT USING THE WASTE FACILITY. I CERTAINLY
APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION AND I DID REVIEW THE REPORT AS WELL. I
THINK I UNDERSTAND IT. I DID HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THERE ARE SMALL
BUSINESSES PROVIDING THE COMPOST SERVICES IN THE CITY. I USE ONE OF
THEM. THEY PICK UP MY COMPOST. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS
ANY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT INCORPORATE THOSE BUSINESSES
INTO THIS SERVICE AND INTO THE ECOSYSTEM.
>> OWEN: OBVIOUSLY, WE HAD A COUPLE OF HEARINGS ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR TOPIC OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. IT IS A TOPIC WE
CONTINUE TO EXAMINE AND LOOK AT. I THINK WE ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED
BY THE ADVICE WE GET FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES AND MAKING
DECISION WE MAKE TOGETHER WITH THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE
BEFORE US.


PAGE 30

April 26, 2021

I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE FACT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
OPERATE OUR COMPOST PROGRAM FOR THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF A LACK
OF TRUCKS. LOGISTICALLY, IT IS REALLY CHALLENGING FOR US TO THINK
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DIVERSIFY THE LOCATIONS WHERE WE SEND THE
MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST LOCATIONS HAVE
CAPACITIES IN TERMS OF THAT WHICH IS ALLOWED BY THE STATE
REGULATORY AGENCY IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF COMPOST TO TAKE ON.
I THINK THE PRIMARY REASON THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE FACILITY
IN CHARLESTOWN AND IN GREATER LAWRENCE SEWER DISTRICT, THE
EVIDENCE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND FROM
DEP IS THAT IT IS THE -- THAT IS THE FACILITY THAT BRINGS MOST BENEFIT
FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. IT IS NOT AS THOUGH THIS IS A
STATIC DISCUSSION. IT IS ONE WE CONTINUE TO REVISIT. AND CERTAINLY, I
APPRECIATE THERE'S A BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH COMPOST THAT ONE
DOESN'T NATURALLY GET FROM FERTILIZER AS WELL IN TERMS OF ECO
LOGICALLY THERE ARE MORE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION OF
COMPOST. THAT IS NOT LOST ON US AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO
DEAL WITH FOOD WASTE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DO AGREE AND I DID LOOK AT
THE REPORT CLOSELY. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT ANAEROBIC DIGESTION IS
THE IDEAL OPTION. THAT'S BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD FOR A LONG TIME.
THAT IS THE ONLY FACILITY THAT CAN HANDLE THIS TYPE OF VOLUME BUT I
DO WORRY ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES DOING SMALLER SCALE ANAEROBIC
DIGESTION AROUND CAMBRIDGE AS WELL SO WE ARE NOT LIMITED TO THAT
ONLY OPTION. I UNDERSTAND, VOLUME-WISE, WE HAVE TO CONTINUE
SENDING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FOOD WASTE THERE. THE MORE THAT
WE CAN CREATE OTHER OPTIONS OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPTIONS, IN
ADDITION TO, NOT INSTEAD OF, I THINK THAT WILL SERVE US WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE COUNCILLOR NOLAN NEXT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. COUPLE OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE
BEEN ASKED. I WILL BUILD ON THEM. AND SAY SINCE I HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING THEM PRESENT THIS A WEBINAR, IF YOU HAVE
NOT LOOKED AT THE REPORT, IT IS 200 PAGES. THERE'S AN EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY. IT IS THOROUGH. I THINK WE DO NEED TO COMMUNICATE THAT
MORE TO THE COMMUNITY AS WE HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE'S
STILL PROBABLY SOME RESTAURANTS AND SOME FOLKS, INCLUDING MYSELF
AND OTHERS, WHO HAD EXPERIENCE AND WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
EXTENT OF THE ANALYSIS. ALL WE CAN DO TO ENSURE TO PEOPLE THAT WE
ARE FOCUSSED ON THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SOLUTION.
THERE WAS SOME LEEWAY IN SOME ANALYSES THAT WERE PRESENTED. IT IS
CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY PRODUCED, IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING
THAT OFFSETS THE GREENE HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IT DOESN'T ASSUME YOU
OFFSET FOSSIL FUEL, AND IF IT COMES TO THAT POINT, IT WILL CHANGE. DO
WE USE THE SCHOOL COMPOSTING? DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN OUR CITY
RUNNING THROUGH THIS FACILITY? AND AS THIS PROGRAM GROWS, IS
THERE ANY TYPE OF LIMITATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO ENVISIONING


PAGE 31

April 26, 2021

THE ENTIRE CITY BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE, INCLUDING IF WE WANT TO
REACH OUT TO AND HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LARGER INSTITUTIONS,
WHICH ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN COMPOSTING NEEDS.
>> OWEN: I DON'T HAVE A GOOD RECOLLECTION OF THE CAPACITY THE
FACILITY. I KNOW IT IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE QUANTITY WE COULD
GENERATE. MICHAEL, MAYBE YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE NUMBERS.
>> MICHAEL: THE CORE FACILITY IN CHARLESTOWN HAS THE CAPACITY OF
1,500 TONS OF FOOD WASTE PER DAY. COMPARED TO A COMPOST SITE,
WHICH IS 105 TONS PER DAY AS PERMITTED.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. UNTIL ALL OTHER TOWNS FOLLOW US,
WE WON'T BE IN DANGER OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT. WE DO ANTICIPATE
HAVING THIS AFTER THE PILOT BE EXTENDED THROUGH AS MUCH AS THE
CITY AS POSSIBLE. IS THAT CORRECT? OKAY. I THINK COMMUNICATING A
SUMMARY SHEET ON WHY IT IS THAT EXTENSIVE STUDY, I KNOW IT IS AT THE
END, IF PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN IT. IT IS AT THE END OF THE MEMO. THERE'S A
LINK TO IT. IT IS ONLINE AND REALLY IMPORTANT WE GET THE WORD OUT
THERE. IT IS A QUESTION IS RAISED EVERY TIME I TALK ABOUT THIS. VERY
EXCITING AND SO GRATEFUL WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU TO
EVERYBODY IN THE CITY WHO WORKED ON THIS. I BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN A
FEW YEARS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WITH A COUPLE OF
OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT EXPLAINING THE TECHNICALITIES OF THIS STUDY THAT
WAS DONE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS. I ECHO MY COLLEAGUES
AND THE THANKS TO THE DPW TEAM, CITY MANAGER, AND OF COURSE THE
EAST CAMBRIDGE BUSINESS ASSOCIATION, TABLE TO FARM, FOR THEIR
ADVOCACY. ROLL CALL ON PLACING THIS ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 9)

CITY MANAGER #9
Motion to adopt City Manager
Agenda #9
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to proposed
amendment to Section 8.66 of
the Municipal Ordinance
related to Tree Protection and
related Orders.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. WE HAVE REVIEWED THIS A FEW
TIMES. WE UNDERSTAND THERE HAS BEEN SOME CHALLENGE JUST BECAUSE
OF SCHEDULING MEETINGS TO GET IN TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE READY
TO ORDAIN. THERE'S A MEETING LATER IN THE WEEK TO GO OVER THE
ORDER WORDING. THIS ONE IS ONLY TO AMEND THE CURRENT TEMPORARY
MORATORIUM ANOTHER TWO MONTHS. I PULLED IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE
HAVE TO TAKE AN EXTRA STEP BECAUSE OF THE TIMING TO MAKE SURE WE
PUT IT IN PLACE TONIGHT. HOWEVER THAT CAN HAPPEN LEGALLY TO MAKE
SURE WE CAN MOVE IT FORWARD IS MY INTENT AND HOPE. WE'LL DO THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AS EXPLAINED, I THINK WE CAN MOVE IT TO A SECOND
READING AS REQUIRED BY SECTION -- WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE -INSUFFICIENT TIME FOR THAT. CLERK WILSON, YOU HAVE SAID WE CAN VOTE
TO ADOPT THE TWO ORDERS AND AMEND THE SECTION.
>> MR. CLERK: SO, FOR THE COUNCIL, COMMUNICATION WITH CITY
MANAGER'S OFFICE INCLUDES TWO POLICY ORDERS. FIRST ONE IS TO INVOKE


PAGE 32

April 26, 2021

-- I'M SORRY. SECOND ONE, INVOKE AN EMERGENCY ORDER TO MOVE
FORWARD ON ADOPTION IN ONE MEETING, THE COUNCIL ADOPT THAT AND
THE SECOND ORDER IS ON ADOPTING THE AMENDMENTS TO THE ORDINANCE
WHICH WILL EXTEND THE MORATORIUM UNTIL JUNE 20TH. THE COUNCIL
CAN TAKE ONE VOTE ON ADOPTING BOTH ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: QUICKLY, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS EXTENSION. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE IT WILL NOT TAKE TWO
MONTHS TO DO. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO BE CAREFUL TO EXTEND THE TIME
BEYOND WHAT WE THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE. I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
WHO ARE WAITING FOR THIS TO THINK, IT IS JUST THE CITY DELAYING IT. AS
COUNCILLOR NOLAN SAID, IT IS A CRUNCH OF ORDINANCE MEETINGS. WE'LL
DEAL WITH THIS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. CLERK, I THINK YOU STATED THE OPTIONS
FOR US. THE OPTIONS ON THE TWO ORDERS. YOU CAN CALL THE ROLL.
>> MR. CLERK: FOR THE RECORD, THE VOTE IS ON ADOPTING THE TWO
ORDERS AND AMENDING SECTION 8.66 IN ONE SESSION. ON THAT MOTION:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 11.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 11).
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THROUGH YOU TO THE COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. FIRST, I SHOULD MAKE A MOTION TO BRING
FORWARD UNFINISHED BUSINESS NUMBER FOUR FOR DISCUSSION. ALONG
WITH THE REPORT SO WE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF US.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE


PAGE 33

April 26, 2021

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE
MEMO THAT WE ASKED FOR TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN WE LAST MET ABOUT
THIS TOPIC WITH REGARD TO OTHER CITIES AND THE GREEN ROOF ZONING.
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY CITY THAT THE PETITIONERS HAVE BEEN CITING AS THE
GOLD STANDARD OF GREEN ROOFS ZONING ALLOWS FOR SOLAR EXEMPTION.
PORTLAND, OREGON, EXEMPTS ARRAYS AND ONTARIO, THEIR GREEN ROOF
BYLAW IS THE TOTAL ROOF AREA MINUS AREAS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT
DOES SEEM THAT THE AMENDMENT THAT WE PUT FORWARD IN THE PAST
LAST TIME WE MET IS IN LINE WITH THE THREE VERY CLIMATE-FORWARD
CITIES THAT WE LOOK TO EMULATE AND PARTNER WITH. I WANT TO THANK
CDD FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS REPORT, BOTH ON THE ISSUES THAT WE
BROUGHT UP AND THEN PUTTING FORWARD SOME NEW LANGUAGE. I DID
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR CDD ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE
THAT CAME UP.
ONE, IN 22.35.3, THERE WAS -- THE SECTION ON BUILDINGS THAT PAY INTO A
FUND INSTEAD OF DOING THE GREEN ROOF OR THE BIOSOLAR OR THE SOLAR
ARRAYS. THERE WAS AN ADJUSTMENT MENTIONED AFTER A REPORT. THE
ZONING MENTIONS IT WOULD BE ADJUSTED TIME AFTER TIME OR I DON'T
REMEMBER THE EXACT LANGUAGE. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TIGHT ZONING
LANGUAGE AND I WONDER IF THERE SHOULD BE EITHER AN ANNUAL
ADJUSTMENT OR THREE OR FIVE-YEAR ADJUSTMENT SO WE HAVE THAT REAL
TIME FRAME IN THERE AND THE ZONING LANGUAGE IS FIRM RATHER THAN
TIME-TO-TIME. IF ASSISTANT MANAGER FAROOQ OR MR. ROBERTS HAS
IDEAS ON TIGHTENING UP THAT LANGUAGE, THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.
>> MS. FAROOQ: THANK YOU. WE CAN ADD THAT IN AND YOU ARE RIGHT,
THAT TIGHTENING WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. WE'D RECOMMEND PROBABLY
THREE YEARS WOULD BE A GOOD FREQUENCY. THINGS WOULDN'T CHANGE
AS MUCH FOR IT TO BE RELEVANT TO DO EVERY YEAR. AND FIVE YEARS MAY
BE JUST BE A TAD LONG. THREE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD NUMBER TO US.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. INSTEAD OF CALCULATED FROM
TIME-TO-TIME, IT IS CALCULATED EVERY THREE YEARS BY THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, DO WE HAVE TO SAY FROM THE
INITIAL REPORT? OR JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE?
>> MS. FAROOQ: I THINK THAT SAYING -- LET ME PUNT THIS TO JEFF
ROBERTS TO COME UP WITH THE BEST CRAFTED LANGUAGE ON THE FLY.
>> JEFF ROBERTS: THANK YOU TO THE COUNCIL. I THINK ONE THING TO
POINT OUT IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION, THE ZONING LANGUAGE THAT
WE HAVE SUBMITTED DOES SAY SUBJECT TO ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT. THAT'S
THE ADJUSTMENT THAT WE'D DO TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. TO ADJUST IT
BASED ON INDEXES TO MAKE SURE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT DOESN'T DECLINE
OVER TIME.
IN TERMS OF THE RECALCULATION, THAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS BY WHICH
WE WOULD GO BACK OUT AND LOOK FOR COMPARABLE EXAMPLES TO
GATHER INFORMATION FROM. IT WOULD BE A MORE INTENSIVE PROCESS. I
THINK -- I DON'T IMAGINE WE WANT TO DO THAT FREQUENTLY BECAUSE IT


PAGE 34

April 26, 2021

WOULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND THE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNTS
FOR INCREASES IN COST. IF THE COUNCIL WANTS TO PUT LANGUAGE IN, I
THINK THE CONCERN I'D HAVE, IF IT IS CONSTRAINED TOO TIGHTLY TO THREE
YEARS, IT MAY RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE -- EFFECTIVENESS OF
THE LANGUAGE. FOR INSTANCE, THE CALCULATION IS NOT DONE EXACTLY
THREE YEARS FROM A PARTICULAR TIME FRAME, WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT
TO AFFECT THE WAY THE ZONING IS IMPLEMENTED. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT
IF THE COUNCIL WANTED TO PUT A PROXIMATE TIME FRAME, RECALCULATED
APPROXIMATELY EVERY THREE YEARS, THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE WOULD BE
FINE. IT WOULD GIVE AN INDICATION TOO DEVELOPERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE
POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENT ABOUT HOW OFTEN IT WOULD
BE RECALCULATED.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. CALCULATED APPROXIMATELY EVERY
THREE YEARS. I PUT THAT FORWARD AS AN AMENDMENT TO TIGHTEN THAT
LANGUAGE. THE SAME SECTION, AROUND WHERE THE PRICE CONTRIBUTION
WILL BE FLOWING, WHICH SEEMS TO INDICATE THE CAMBRIDGE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING TRUST, WHICH WE HAVE ALL AGREED IS PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE
TO DO THAT. THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD AND I THINK THE WAY THE
TRUST -- THE FUNDS WERE ENVISIONED WAS TO POTENTIALLY COVER COSTS
OF GREEN ROOFS, BIOSOLAR ROOFS, OR OTHER SUSTAINABLE ROOF-TOP
RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDING. THE WAY IT IS
WRITTEN, IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING INTO THE GENERAL AFFORDABLE
HOUSING TRUST FUND. DO WE NEED TO -- IS THE SPIRIT AND THE INTENTION
TO PROVIDE FOR A SMALLER FUND WITHIN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
TRUST, DO WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO SAY THAT SO IT IS
CLEAR THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING -- SHOULD BE EXPENDED ON GREEN
ROOFS, BISOLAR, OR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING PROJECTS?
>> MS. FAROOQ: IN GENERAL, WE'D SAY THAT STAFF WOULD RECOMMEND
THAT THE FUNDS BE TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST. HOWEVER, IF THE
COUNCIL DOES WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AND DIRECTIVE TO THE TRUST,
YOU CAN CERTAINLY INCLUDE THAT LANGUAGE. SPECIFYING THE USE. IT
DOES GET CHALLENGING TO -- IT WILL ADD A WRINKLE OF TRACKING THE
SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND THE PARTICULAR USES. IT COULD
CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT IS ADDED.
>> JEFF ROBERTS: IF I CAN ADD TO THAT, IT DOES SAY IN THE LANGUAGE
THAT WE PROVIDED, WHICH IS LANGUAGE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS
THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PETITION BEFORE THE COUNCIL. ALL SUCH
FUNDS CONTRIBUTED TO THE TRUST SHALL BE DEDICATED TO THE DESIGN
AND INCORPORATION OF GREEN ROOF AREA, BISOLAR, OR SOLAR ENERGY
SYSTEMS, INTO NEW OR EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.
THAT'S THE WAY THE TEXT READS NOW. IT IS THE WAY THE TEXT READS NOW
AND INCLUDED IN THE CDD'S VERSION. THE COUNCIL CAN CONSIDER
AMENDMENTS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I'M NOT SEEING THAT. WHICH
SECTION ARE YOU SAYING THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN THE WAY YOU


PAGE 35

April 26, 2021

DESCRIBED IT?
>> JEFF ROBERTS: SO IN PARAGRAPH 22.35.3. PARAGRAPH WE LOOK AT.
THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE PARAGRAPH.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I SEE IT. THAT SEEMS TO CLEAR THAT UP. THOSE
ARE MY TWO ZONING QUESTIONS. THIS IS A LARGER QUESTION AROUND
WHAT BIOSOLAR IS AND WHAT -- I THINK THE REASON I PUT FORWARD THE
AMENDMENT TWO WEEKS AGO TO INCLUDE SOLAR ENERGY IS TO MAKE
SURE WE COULD BE FLEXIBLE, BUILDINGS CAN BE FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF THE
USE AND WHAT THEY NEED TO USE THE ROOF TOP FOR. IN HAVING
CONVERSATIONS TODAY, I THINK THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT THE LACK OF A
DEFINITION OF BISOLAR AND THE PERCENTAGE PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE
DEDICATED TO SOLAR VERSUS TO VEGETATIVE ROOFS. MY UNDERSTANDING,
FROM THE PETITIONERS AND THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THEM, WE
HAD WITH THEM HERE AT ORDINANCE AND CITY COUNCIL, THE IDEA IS AND
THE INTENT OF THE GREEN ROOFS, VEGETATIVE ROOFS AND BISOLAR,
THERE'S 80% OF THE ROOF THAT IS USEABLE, IT IS VEGETATIVE AND THE
SOLAR COMPONENT ON TOP OF THAT. WOULDN'T BE 50% OF THE TOP OF
THE ROOF COULD BE SOLAR OVER HERE AND THERE COULD BE A PART THAT
IS A VEGETATIVE ROOF.
THE AMENDMENT I PUT FORWARD LAST WEEK WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT
FLEXIBILITY. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IS THE
INTENT OF THE AMENDMENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET AS
SOME SORT OF FLEXIBILITY. THERE CAN BE JUST SOLAR ON PART OF THE
ROOF. JUST VEGETATIVE OR MIXED. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF
US, MS. FAROOQ, IF YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND AND CLARIFY WHERE
WE ARE NOW WITH THE LANGUAGE AND WHAT -- THE FACT THERE IS NO
DEFINITION OF WHAT BISOLAR IS AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE ROOF IT
WILL ENCOMPASS.
>> MS. FAROOQ: ON THE STAFF SIDE, CDD, LAW DEPARTMENT, ISD
PARTICULARLY, SINCE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING THIS ONCE IT
IS ADOPTED, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING A
DEFINITION. THOSE CLEAR AND ENFORCEABLE FOR BISOLAR. ONCE THE
AMENDMENT THAT ALLOWED SOLAR, IT WAS ADOPTED, IT CREATED A
FRAMEWORK WHERE IT WAS LESS CRITICAL TO HAVE A CRISP DEFINITION OF
BIOSOLAR. WHERE THERE IS A VERSION WHERE ONE CAN HAVE 100% SOLAR,
OR 100% OF THE AREA THAT IS NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED COULD BE GREEN
ROOF, YOU HAVE THOSE TWO EXTREMES. WE CAN IMAGINE THAT
EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN CAN BE CONSIDERED BIOSOLAR. THAT WAS NOT
THE CASE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITHOUT THE SOLAR COMPONENT BEING
PRESENT. WE ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING A CRISP DEFINITION AS
LONG AS THE SOLAR COMPONENT IS PART OF THE PROVISIONS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I THINK PROBABLY WHERE DENVER
ENDED UP WAS LARGELY WHERE WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES IF WE DON'T
HAVE A SOLAR OPTION WHERE A YEAR FROM NOW, WE MAY HAVE TO COME
BACK AND REVISIT THIS BECAUSE WE WERE NOT FLEXIBLE. IT SOUNDS LIKE
DENVER HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. PORTLAND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND

PAGE 36

April 26, 2021

Toronto HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THAT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY OF
HAVING JUST A SOLAR OPTION AND CAN DO -- I THINK WHAT YOU DESCRIBE,
ALL THE WAYS BETWEEN ALL SOLAR OR ALL VEGETATIVE. A LOT OF THE
BUILDERS, ESPECIALLY FOR UNIVERSITIES, THAT'S AN OPTION THEY THINK IS
CRITICAL FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY
OPTION ON TOP OF THE ROOF, WHICH IS REALLY THE BEST WAY -- WE HEARD
A COMMENT EARLIER. I WROTE IT DOWN. ON-SITE RENEWABLE IS THE MOST
POWERFUL TOOL WE WHERE TO MITIGATE CLIME CHANGE AND THOUSAND
TIMES MORE IMPACT THAN JUST A GREEN ROOF. I THINK THE POWERFUL
COMBINATION, THE 1-2 PUNCH IS HAVING THE SOLAR OPTION AND THE
VEGETATIVE AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. JUST MAKING SURE THAT
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE THIS CLIMATE RESILIENCY TASK FORCE THAT IS
MEETING AND PUT FORTH RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THE COOL ROOF
FACTOR WILL HAVE BONUS POINTS FOR GREEN ROOF. THERE'S AN INCENTIVE
FOR DEVELOPERS TO PUT FORWARD THE GREEN ROOFS. I WANT TO MAKE
SURE WE DON'T GET DEVELOPMENT THAT BUYS THEIR WAY OUT AND WE
DON'T GET WHAT I THINK WE ALL WANT, WHICH IS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE
GOALS BY HAVING VEGETATIVE ROOFS, HAVING THE SOLAR ARRAYS AND
ON-SITE RENEWABLE PANELS RATHER THAN NOTHING AND MONEY INTO THE
TRUST FUND.
I REALLY WOULD -- I KNOW THERE'S AN AMENDMENT PASSED AROUND BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN EARLIER TODAY. SORT OF REMOVING WHAT WE PUT
FORWARD LAST TIME WE MET, WHICH WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. IT WAS A
CLOSE VOTE. IT DID MOVE FORWARD. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO LET THAT
AMENDMENT STAND, GIVEN THAT CDD PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK BASED ON
HAVING THE AMENDMENT IN THE ZONING. AND MOVE FORWARD WITH A
REALLY PROGRESSIVE GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE THAT WILL GET US TO OUR
CLIMATE GOALS AND WHAT I KNOW WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR, WHICH IS
THE MOST GREEN CITY, MOST CLIMATE ADAPTED CITY THAT WE CAN HAVE.
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AT THIS POINT. I'LL YIELD THE FLOOR. I SEE A LOT
OF HANDS UP. THANK YOU TO THE CDD FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS
REPORT. AND OUTLINING WHAT OTHER CITIES WENT THROUGH AND WHERE
THEY END UP AND WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I MEANT TO TICK OFF THE HAND. I
WILL THANK COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL THE WORK AND
DETERMINATION. MORE SO, I WANT TO THANK THE MOTHERS OUT FRONT
FOR PUSHING THIS ISSUE. PUSHING IT BEYOND WHAT THE RESILIENCY
COMMITTEE SEEM TO COME UP WITH. AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW THAT AT A
MINIMUM, ONE OF THREE, PROBABLY ONE OF TWO OPTIONS WILL BE TAKEN
ON THE ROOF.
IT'S TRUE THAT DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. DENVER WAS
MENTIONED. PORTLAND IS MENTIONED. SO IS Toronto, WHICH IS VERY
MUCH SIMILAR TO CAMBRIDGE/BOSTON. THE DIFFERENCE IS, THEY HAVE
MUCH MORE OPEN SPACE AND GREEN AREAS THAN WE DO. WE HAVE A
MAJOR DEFICIT. THE MEDIAN CITY IN THE UNITED STATES HAS 15% OPEN
SPACE. WE HAVE 7. AND SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE 1 AND 3%.


PAGE 37

April 26, 2021

BOSTON IS TWO AND HALF TIMES WHAT CAMBRIDGE IS. IN OPEN SPACE.
THIS IS ONE WAY OF MITIGATING THAT. MITIGATING ALL THE ADVANTAGES
OF HAVING A GREEN ROOF. YOU CAN'T LOOK AT IT IN ISOLATION. I DON'T
EXPECT TO BE CHANGE PEOPLE'S VOTES TONIGHT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT
CLEAR, WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THIS WAS PART OF A SOLUTION
OVER TIME BUILDING BUILDINGS WITH 40-60,000 SQUARE FOOT PLATES TO
MITIGATE THE NEGATIVITY OF OUR LACK OF OPEN SPACE. AND ALL THE
BENEFITS OF THAT FROM -- I WON'T GO INTO THE LIST.
SO, THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN THE CITY THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK
AT, ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS, INCLUDING ALEWIFE. QUADRANGLE
WHERE THERE IS NOT OPEN SPACE TO SPEAK OF. NOR ARE WE BUILDING ANY
TO SPEAK OF. AND THE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE LOW
AMOUNTS. WHERE THERE ARE PARKING LOTS, WHERE THERE ARE
OPPORTUNITIES, WE SHOULD BE BUILDING OPEN SPACE ASAP. AND THIS IS
ONE WAY OF MITIGATING IT WITH GREEN ROOFS AND WE BASICALLY
NEGATED THAT. I THINK IT IS -- I GET WHY WE WANT SOLAR, BUT WE
SHOULD BE ASKING FOR SOLAR AND GREEN ROOFS. OR SOME COMBINATION
OF THE TWO. THEY ARE BOTH DESPERATELY NEEDED. I'LL STOP THERE.
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK. MOTHERS OUT FRONT DID A YEOMAN'S
JOB WHERE IT WOULDN'T BE WHERE IT IS NOW. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I CAN YIELD WHILE WE HAVE THIS PARTICULAR
DISCUSSION. I WAS GOING TO BRING FORWARD MY AFFORDABLE HOUSING
AMENDMENT. CAN I YIELD. THE ONLY THING TO SAY, I CAN CERTAINLY -- I
AGREE WITH VICE MAYOR MALLON IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT OF SOLAR AND
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. I WORRY AND I SAID THIS LAST TIME, I WORRY THAT
IF WE GIVE THAT OPTION, THAT'S WHAT WE'LL GET. IT IS NOT A BAD THING.
SOLAR IS A GOOD THING. I'D RATHER GET SOLAR THAN WHAT WE HAVE. WE
WON'T GET GREEN ROOFS UNLESS WE -- UNLESS THAT INCENTIVE IS SO
INCREDIBLE THAT THE DEVELOPERS WILL TAKE IT.
THAT WORRIES ME. AGAIN, WE'LL GET SOMETHING, WHICH IS GREAT. WE
PROBABLY WON'T GET WHAT THIS ORDINANCE IS PUSHING FOR. AND THAT'S
CONCERNING. I WONDER, I THINK THE VICE MAYOR MALLON IS RIGHT, SHE
SAID THAT DENVER AND OTHER PLACES HAVE COME BACK AND CHANGED
THEIR ORDINANCE AFTER THEY WERE ORIGINALLY PASSED. THAT'S AN
OPTION WE CAN DO, TOO. WE CAN GO WITH THE ORIGINAL GOAL AND IF IT
TURNS OUT WE DON'T GET WHAT WE LOOK FOR OR WHAT WE HOPED FOR,
WE CAN GO BACK AND WE CAN CHANGE IT AND ADD A SOLAR OPTION IF WE
WANT. GOING BACK AND REVISING CAN CUT BOTH WAYS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A BENEFIT FOR THE
COMMUNITY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THAT DOES CONCERN ME THAT IT
WILL DILUTE WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO GET OUT OF THE ORDINANCE. I
WASN'T PLANNING SAYING ALL THAT, BUT COME BACK TO ME LATER FOR THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AMENDMENT, PLEASE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.


PAGE 38

April 26, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DO AGREE WITH MY
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE CONCERN THAT THE WAY THAT
WE HAVE AMENDED THIS PETITION ESSENTIALLY DEVELOPER S CAN HAVE
ONLY SOLAR AND NOT GREEN ROOFS. AS I SAID, YOU WON'T FIND A BIGGER
-- MY OWN ROOF IS PLASTERED WITH SOLAR PANELS. THIS PETITION WAS
TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE THE GREEN ROOF REQUIREMENT, NOT A SOLAR
REQUIREMENT. WE NEED BOTH. THE AMENDMENT WE GOT LAST TIME
DIDN'T HAVE BOTH THINGS. IT ALLOWS FOR SOME SOLAR TO BE SUFFICIENT
INSTEAD OF MAXIMIZING THE GREEN ROOF.
IN FACT, WE CAN EVENLY DEVOTE, REQUIRE GREEN ROOF AND REQUIRE
SOLAR WHERE IT MAKES SENSE. I DO HAVE AN AMENDMENT AS WELL. I
DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE DOING THIS NOW OR LATER, BUT IT WOULD SPECIFY
THE SOLAR WOULD BE ADDED WHERE IT IS APPLICABLE. ONE OF THE
COMPLEXITIES HERE IS THAT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE SENSE TO PUT
SOLAR EVERYWHERE ON THE ROOF. IT MAY BE AREAS THAT ARE SHADED OUT
OR FACING THE WRONG WAY. YOU COULD PUT A GREEN ROOF IN. AGAIN,
THEY ARE SEPARATE, THEY INTERACT WELL. THE WAY WE'RE TRYING TO PUT
THIS TOGETHER ON THE FLY IS MESSY. AND THEN THE OTHER AMENDMENT I
WILL PUT FORWARD IS TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DATE EARLIER THAN A YEAR
FROM NOW. I THINK THAT JUST GIVES TOO MANY PROJECTS THE OPTION OF
NOT DOING GREEN ROOFS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED, TWO OF THE PROJECTS
THAT ARE BEFORE US -- BEFORE THE PLANNING BOARD, THEY HAVE ALREADY
PRE-EXEMPTED BEYOND TO CONSIDER GREEN ROOFS AS PART OF THE
PROJECT BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THE ZONING LANGUAGE. I THINK WE ARE
GOING TOO FAR IF WE PUSH IT OUT A YEAR.
GIVING A MONTH OR SO FOR THE CALCULATIONS TO BE DONE, IT MAKES
SENSE TO ME, BUT NOT PUSHING IT OUT FOR A WHOLE YEAR. I WANT TO SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT. AGAIN, I'M A HUGE PROPONENT OF SOLAR, BUT IT IS
NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS, ESPECIALLY NOT IN CAMBRIDGE.
AND A PROJECT MOVING SLOWLY FOR YEARS, IT IS ACTUALLY ON THE CUSP
OF BEING APPROVED AND THAT INITIAL PROJECT, IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING,
IT WILL GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO POWER 400,000 HOMES. THAT
COULD PUT EVENLY -- BASICALLY POWER 1/10 OF CAMBRIDGE. RESIDENTIAL
POPULATION AND LEAVING LOTS OF POWER FOR THE STATE AND THE
COUNTRY. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THAT'S ULTIMATELY HOW WE'RE
GOING TO GET TO RENEWABLE ENERGY IS THROUGH LARGER-SCALE
PROJECTS. IT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T DO SOLAR ON THE ROOFTOPS.
WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD COMPOSITE THAT AS THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION. I
HOPE WE CAN AMEND THIS PETITION AND MAKE IT STRONGER AND THEN AS
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SUGGESTED, IF WE NEED TO, WE CAN REVISIT IT IN
THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE'S AMENDMENTS FROM THE MEMO AND
AMENDMENTS THAT COUNCILLORS SENT TO THE CLERK. I THINK YOU WILL
SAY GET TO THE AMENDMENTS IN THE MEMO AND THEN HAVE ANY
COUNCILLORS INTRODUCE THE AMENDMENTS THEY HAVE.
>> MR. CLERK: YES. MAYBE HELP THE COUNCIL TO MOVE IT ALONG. IT MAY


PAGE 39

April 26, 2021

MAKE SENSE TO VOTE TO ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE MEMO FROM
CDD. AND VICE MAYOR MALLON PUT FORWARD AN AMENDMENT TO ADD
APPROXIMATELY EVERY THREE YEARS BEFORE YOU GO TO THE OTHER
AMENDMENTS. IT MAKES SENSE TO VOTE ON THAT PRIOR TO THE COUNCIL
GOING FORWARD.
>> MR. CLERK: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN,
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS UP, IF WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY, IF IT RELATES
TO THE MEMO AMENDMENTS, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. IF YOU ARE
FINE WITH TAKING THE VOTE AFTER -- TAKING THE VOTE AND THEN SPEAKING
BECAUSE YOU HAVE UNRELATED AMENDMENTS, YOU CAN LET ME KNOW BY
A NOD.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: I YIELD FOR NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WILL YIELD. MY AMENDMENT, WHICH YOU HAVE
SEEN, WOULD COME AFTER THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK, CALL THE ROLL?
>> MR. CLERK: THIS VOTE IS ON AMENDING THE PETITION BY SUBSTITUTION
WITH THE LANGUAGE IN MEMORANDUM FROM THE CITY MANAGER AS
AGENDA ITEM 11. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL).

Motion to adopt amendments
from City Manager Agenda #11
memo.

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST. I THINK THE NEXT MOTION
WOULD HAVE PRECEDENT IS THE AMENDMENT FROM THE VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I BELIEVE THE CLERK HAS THE LANGUAGE.
>> MR. CLERK: CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IF I MISSTATE THIS, TO DELETE
THE WORDS FROM TIME TO TIME IN PARAGRAPH 22.35.3 AND REPLACE THEM
WITH APPROXIMATELY EVERY THREE YEARS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> MR. CLERK: GOING TO A VOTE?

Motion to amend 22.35.3 to
delete “from time to time” and
replace with “approximately
every three years”

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO


PAGE 40

April 26, 2021

AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER AND
THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I SUPPORT THE
AMENDMENTS TO THE ORDINANCE LAST WEEK AND I WILL SUPPORT THEM
TONIGHT. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH FOR IT. IT PUTS THE
ORDINANCE IN THREE BUCKETS. WE PRESENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO
MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE ORDINANCE WILL PLAY OUT AND
LOOKING AT THE APPLICATIONS THERE. THERE'S A FLEXIBILITY FOR HOUSING
AND NONPROFITS. AND THEY CAN DO VEGETATION, BISOLAR, OR JUST
VEGETATION. AND THERE'S A STRONGER REQUIREMENT FOR COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT. AND THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS THE MOST
FUNDING AND WE KNOW IF THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS, MAYBE IT WILL
RESULT IN MORE HOUSING. COMMERCIAL HOUSING HAS A STRONGER
REQUIREMENT. WE NEED MORE HOUSING IN CAMBRIDGE. IT MAKES SENSE
TO DO THIS NOW AND THIS ORDINANCE. I APPRECIATE THE WORK, MOTHERS
OUT FRONT, AND OTHERS PUT INTO THIS. WE CAN LOOK AND SEE HOW IT
WORKS. IF WE HAVE TO COME BACK IN A YEAR OR TWO, TAKE IT UP, AND I
THINK THE OTHER PIECE ON THIS, THE BISOLAR DEFINITION IS NOT -- IT
COULD BE A WEAKNESS OR A STRENGTH. IF REQUIRING VEGETATION IS A
COMPLICATION, THAT WIGGLE ROOM IN THE BISOLAR DEFINITION MAY HELP.
IF WE HAVE TO COME BACK IN A YEAR OR TWO, BETTER DEFINE IT, ALONG
WITH OTHER PARTS, THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. I WILL YIELD BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS WHERE I WOULD TALK ABOUT
A POSSIBLE AMENDMENT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK PER THE CONVERSATION, JUST THE EMAILS
THAT CAME IN TODAY, THERE ARE QUITE A FEW, I THINK COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN YOU EMAILED US -- TOP OF THE MORNING AROUND YOUR
AMENDMENT. AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED IT. I WILL GO TO YOUR
AMENDMENT AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN, WE'LL GO TO YOURS. PER THE
ORDER THAT HAPPENED TODAY.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. SO, AT THE LAST MEETING, I PUT
IN AN AMENDMENT ABOUT EXEMPTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS
FROM THE ORDINANCE. THERE WERE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP FROM A
FEW COUNCILLORS AND OTHER FOLKS AFTER. LOOKING FOR SOME MORE
DEFINITION AROUND THAT AMENDMENT. PARTICULARLY THE QUESTION
WAS REALLY WOULD THIS INCLUDE MARKET RENT HOUSING THAT HAD 20%
INCLUSIONARY UNITS. IT WASN'T THE INTENT.
AND SO, I WENT BACK AND SPOKE TO SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD WITH CDD. AND CAME UP WITH LANGUAGE
THAT MAKES IT MORE CLEAR. AND THAT IS WHAT IS HERE. MR. CLERK, YOU
MAY HAVE TO HELP ME WITH THIS. WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER, I THINK I
AM IN THE RIGHT SECTION. WE ADOPTED THE SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE.
>> MR. CLERK: THAT'S CORRECT.


PAGE 41

April 26, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THIS IS TO CHANGE WHAT IS -- IT TELL NOW
READ EXCEPT IT SHALL NOT APPLY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT
ARE EITHER DEVELOPED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY AS
DEFINED IN THE SECTION, OR HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE UNITS PERMANENTLY
RESERVED FOR HOUSEHOLDS AT OR BELOW 100% OF AMI. AND THIS WILL -THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOLKS WANTED FLEXIBILITY. SOME OF THE
BUILDINGS, YOU ARE 100% BELOW AMI AND 50% AND 30%. THEY NEEDED
SOME BETTER DEFINITION. BY SAYING A MAJORITY OF THEIR UNITS
PERMANENTLY RESERVED FOR HOUSEHOLDS, THAT EXCLUDES THE 20%
INCLUSIONARY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT MAJORITY. CDD FELT IT WAS CLEAR.
AND MADE SENSE. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOLKS WAS HAPPY AND SAID
IT WOULD FIT AND NOT IMPACT FUNDING. I OFFER THAT UP AS AN
AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S HAND UP ON THE
AMENDMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DO SUPPORT THE
AMENDMENT. I THINK IT WILL WORK WELL. MY ONLY QUESTION IS AROUND
THE WORD PROJECTS. ORDINANCE APPLIES TO BUILDINGS. I WONDER
WHETHER WE SHOULD SAY -- APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS THAT ARE...
ET CETERA. SO IT IS MORE CLEAR. I'LL PUT THIS QUESTION TO SEE IF WE
NEED TO DO THAT?
>> MS. FAROOQ: I WILL SEE IF JEFF ROBERTS OR NANCY GLOWA HAVE
THOUGHTS ON THIS ONE?
>> JEFF ROBERTS: I WILL TRY TO RESPOND AND I'M LOOKING AT THIS -- I'M
TAKING A FRESH LOOK TO SEE IF THAT CONCERN COULD BE AN ISSUE WITH
THE LANGUAGE THAT IS IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL. I'M NOT IMMEDIATELY
SEEING THAT AS A CONCERN. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. THE TERM
"PROJECT" UNDER ZONING GENERALLY REFERS TO DEVELOPMENT OF
BUILDINGS. I THINK IN THIS CASE I'M NOT SURE THAT-- I'M NOT SURE IT
NEEDS TO BE STATED THAT IT ONLY APPLIES TO BUILDINGS. I'M TRYING TO
LOOK IN MY HEAD WHAT THE LANGUAGE MAY LOOK LIKE IF WE USE THE
WORD BUILDING RATHER THAN PROJECT. I THINK EITHER WAY IT COULD BE
WORKABLE. IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO FIGURE IT OUT ON THE FLY. I APOLOGIZE.
>> MS. FAROOQ: IF I MIGHT INTERJECT. ACTUALLY I THINK IT WILL BE FINE
FROM A ZONING PERSPECTIVE, BUT AS COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN HAS SHED A
LIGHT ON THIS WORD, I WONDER IF JUST FROM A PERCEPTION OF WHAT THE
WORD "PROJECT" MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IF WE
MAY BE BETTER SERVED OF MAKING THE CHANGE TO BUILDINGS OR
DEVELOPMENT SO WE ARE NOT PERPETUATING THE PROJECT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I ACTUALLY -- I WAS THINKING THE SAME
THING AS I LOOK AT IT AGAIN. I THINK DEVELOPMENT HAS THE SAME
PROBLEM. I'D BE FINE WITH CHANGING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING
BUILDINGS. THAT'S MORE GENERAL AND DOESN'T GIVE THE SAME
PERCEPTION. WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE WORD "PROJECT" WHAT THEY THINK IT
MEANS. IT HAS A WIDER DEFINITION IN ZONING, BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY


PAGE 42

April 26, 2021

PEOPLE SEE IT IN THE WORD. I'M FINE WITH CHANGING TO BUILDINGS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WOULD SUGGEST APPLY TO
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS THAT EITHER ARE -- ET CETERA. PUTTING
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE ALSO COMPLICATES IT UNNECESSARILY. THE
REST OF THE SENTENCE SPECIFIES EXACTLY WHAT WE MEAN BY AFFORDABLE
HOUSING. IF WE SAY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS... I THINK WE COVER THE
WHOLE THING.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THE ONLY THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS
THAT I LITERALLY HAD PROBABLY 15 BACK-AND-FORTH WITH AFFORDABLE
HOUSING PEOPLE TO CRAFT THIS LANGUAGE A CERTAIN WAY. I'M HESITANT
-- EVERY WORD MAKES A DIFFERENT TO THEM AND THEIR FUNDING, I'M
HESITANT TO DO THAT. I DON'T THINK CHANGING BUILDING AND PROJECTS
MAKES A DIFFERENCE. I'M HESITANT TO GO FURTHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE TO THEM. I'D PREFER NOT TO CHANGE IT,
OTHER THAN TO CHANGE PROJECTS TO BUILDINGS. IT WORKS. PEOPLE
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT WON'T IMPACT THEIR FUNDING. CDD KNOWS
WHAT IT MEANS. I DON'T WANT TO WORDSMITH IS TO THE POINT WHERE IT
IS A MISTAKE. WITHOUT HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK AND WORK
WITH THE PEOPLE, I PREFER NOT TO DO THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I'M FINE WITH THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. I SEE SOLICITOR GLOWA.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: IF I CAN SUGGEST RESPECTFULLY, IT READS FUNNY TO SAY
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDINGS. I MIGHT SUGGEST MOVING THE WORDS
AROUND TO SAY, AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT EITHER ARE
CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY OR HAVE
MAJORITY OF UNITS, ET CETERA. BUILDINGS THAT ARE DEVELOPED UNDER
THE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDINGS IS AN ODD JUXTAPOSITION TO ME.
WHATEVER THE COUNCIL LIKES. I'M JUST OFFERING THAT AS A POSSIBLE
TWEAK.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE THE PROJECTS TO
BUILDINGS AND GO. I THINK PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT DOESN'T
CHARGE THE MEANING. IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST ORDINANCE THAT READS
FUNNY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE AMENDMENT, ROLL CALL?

Motion to amend McGovern
amendment by deleting
“project” and inserting
“building”

>> MR. CLERK: TO BE CLEAR, ARE YOU AMENDING THE AMENDMENT? ON
THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT, WHICH IS TO DELETE THE WORD
PROJECTS AND REPLACE IT WITH THE WORD BUILDINGS. (ROLL CALL). NINE
IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
INSERT THE WORDS EXCEPT SHOULDN'T APPLY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING
BUILDINGS... (READING FROM THE SCREEN).
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: HOUSEHOLDS, NOT HOUSING.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WOULD LIKE TO US TO DISCUSS THE SOLICITOR'S
MEMO BEFORE THE MANAGER AND THE SOLICITOR LEAVE FOR THE EVENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE MEMO...
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: CONCERNING THE COUNCIL GETTING ITS OWN
LEGAL PERSPECTIVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SINCE WE -- I THINK WE HAVE COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S
AMENDMENT THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO FIRST.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I APOLOGIZE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VOTE ON THE ORDER AS AMENDED AND THEN TO THE
MEMO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I ALSO HAVE AN AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO YOURS AS WELL. PER THE EMAILS, WE GO
TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN FIRST AND THEN TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? I DON'T HAVE MY
EARBUDS ON. IS IT CLEAR? I TALKED ABOUT MY PASSION FOR THIS
ORDINANCE AND MY EXCITEMENT. I WRITTEN ABOUT IT AND I WON'T GO
OVER IT. I WILL RESPOND TO THINGS WE HAVE HEARD TODAY. AND REMIND
US, SUMMARIZE SOME, THAT'S WHY I PUT FORTH AN AMENDMENT. AND AS
WE HEARD, THE PETITION IS BASED ON BEST PRACTICE AND OTHER PEOPLE
IN, PORTLAND, OREGON HAS AN ABILITY FOR SOLAR. THE REQUIREMENT IS A
MAXIMUM OF 40% CAN BE EXEMPT FROM THE ECO ROOF REQUIREMENT. IT
INCLUDES SOLAR. NOT ALL IT COULD BE EXEMPT. ONLY UP TO A CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE, THE WAY I READ IT. THEY DEFINE ECO ROOFS SIMILAR TO WE
DO ON VEGETATIVE. WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THEIR IMPLEMENTATION,
Toronto, WASHINGTON, D.C., AND CHICAGO, THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE GREEN
ROOFS. THEY DO IT BY INCENTIVIZING, WHICH CAMBRIDGE NEVER DID. WE
HAVEN'T PROACTIVELY SAID, WE ARE GOING TO INCENTIVIZE YOU AND WE
THINK THAT'S WHY WE ARE IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE AS
MANY GREEN ROOFS AS WE SHOULD AND COULD.
SO, AS DOCUMENTED TO REMIND US, I DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE
HISTORY, THE CITY IS ON RECORD ON A NUMBER OF WAYS STARTING IN 2002
AND MAYBE BEFORE THAT. SPECIFICALLY SAYING THAT WE FAVOR, WE
WANT, AND WE -- WE EXPECT GREEN ROOFS TO BE BUILT. THE VISION IS
THERE, BUT SADLY THAT VISION AFTER MAYBE AFTER 20 YEARS IS STILL A
VISION. NOT A REALITY. WE HAVE SOME GREEN ROOFS, BUT NOT AS MANY
AS WE SHOULD. TO REMIND US, WE WANT A GREENE HOUSE GAS EMISSION
TO GO DOWN. I AGREE WE DO WANT MORE SOLAR. OUR GREENE HOUSE
GAS EMISSIONS IS 25% HIGHER THAN 1990. AND WE ARE BEHIND THE STATE
IN OUR STATED GOALS WITH THE -- WE DO HAVE TO RAMP UP AS MUCH AS
WE CAN.
THIS ORDINANCE WON'T GET US THERE ALONE. IT IS RELATIVELY SMALL,
ONLY NEW BUILDINGS OF A CERTAIN SIZE, IT WILL PUT US ON THE PATH TO
CLAIM OUR POSITION AS A CLIMATE LEADER. AND WE KNOW WE TRY


PAGE 44

April 26, 2021

ENCOURAGEMENT AND IT DIDN'T WORK. WE NEED A REQUIREMENT. I
AGREE SOLAR IS GREAT. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUIRE BISOLAR, GREEN ROOF
AND SOLAR. WE CAN REQUIRE THAT REGARDLESS OF VEGETATIVE. A FEW
KEY POINTS ON THIS QUESTION THAT IS NOT COVERED. BOTH COOL AND
GREEN ROOFS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO REDUCE ENERGY BILLS BY DECREASING
AIR CONDITIONING NEED, IMPROVING AIR COMFORT. A GREEN ROOF
REDUCES DAMAGES WEAR AND TEAR ON THE ROOF. IT WILL REDUCING
NEWS FILTRATION AND OFFERS HAIL PROTECTION. COOL ROOFS DO NONE OF
THAT. ONLY GREEN ROOFS ALSO -- WHEN PAIRED WITH SOLAR, WE ALREADY
HAD THAT DOCUMENTATION, INCREASED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOLAR
PANEL. THAT'S SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. AND WE HEARD
DIRECTLY FROM ROOFING PROFESSIONALS THERE IS NO NEED TO REDUCE
THE SOLAR ON THE SITE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GREEN ROOF.
Ary KEY THING I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT
WITH THE COOL ROOF AND WITH THE SOLAR AND THE WHITE ROOFS THAT
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT, IT IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE SOUTH OF THE
COUNTRY WHERE THE ABSOLUTE PRIMARY REASON YOU ARE WORKING ON IS
THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT. IT IS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY,
THE INSULATION FACTOR OF A GREEN FACTOR NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO
ACCOUNT FOR THAT BENEFIT. IF WE ARE THE CITY COUNCIL IN FLORIDA, IT
WOULD BE CHALLENGING. THERE SO MUCH OF THE ENERGY THAT IS USED IN
A BUILDING IS FOR AIR CONDITIONING, FOR COOLING, AND THAT'S WHERE
THE IMPACT OF A WHITE ROOF OR A COOL ROOF REALLY WOULD HAVE MORE
OF AN IMPACT. HERE IS A COUPLE OF MONTHS A YEAR. THE YEAR THE
INSULATING FACTOR DURING THE HEAT PRODUCTION IN THE WINTER, IT IS
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY GREEN ROOFS ARE NET
POSITIVE FOR CAMBRIDGE.
WE HAVE HEARD, I WILL ADDRESS THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY ZONING TASK
FORCE. PASSING THIS REQUIREMENT DOESN'T INVALIDATE THAT WORK.
HOWEVER, I WILL BE CLEAR, I REVIEWED IT ALL. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS
DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH AND THEY WILL DO VERY LITTLE TO REDUCE GREENE
HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IN THE COOL FACTOR, THE TASK FORCE DISCUSSES,
IT COULD MEAN -- DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY SOLAR OR GREEN. LET'S REALLY DO
WHAT WE CAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GREEN ROOFS IN THE CITY AND
COMPLETELY INCENTIVIZE SOLAR. I WOULD HAVE KEPT THE PETITION
COVERING ALL BUILDINGS AND RENOVATIONS, WE HAVE SAID WE'LL EXEMPT
MOST HOUSING. LET'S COVER NEW BUILDINGS ONLY, WITH NEW LARGE
COMMERCIAL AND LAB BUILDINGS REQUIRED TO HAVE A GREEN VEGETATIVE
ROOF AND OPTION OF SOLAR. IN ADDITION, NOT INSTEAD OF. MY
AMENDMENT, I PROPOSE TO DO THAT. ALL HOUSING PROJECTS ARE
ALLOWED TO CHOOSE GREEN OR BISOLAR OR SOLAR, BUT COMMERCIAL AND
LAB, MIXED USE THAT ARE NOT MOSTLY HOUSING, WILL CHOOSE GREEN OR
BISOLAR. I WANT TO READ YOU, I GOT AN EMAIL FROM SOMEONE WHO
GRADUATED FROM CRLS IN 2016. SHE SAID CAN YOU READ THIS INTO THE
RECORD.
I WILL END THIS PORTION OF IT -- A 2016 GRADUATE. BACK IN 2013 I


PAGE 45

April 26, 2021

WORKED ON A SIMILAR PROPOSITION ON GREEN ROOFS ACROSS THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE WITH FOUR OTHER STUDENTS FOR THE CHALLENGE. THIS IDEA
IS SUPPORTED BACK THEN, OUR TEAM WON. AND THIS GREEN ROOFS
PETITION NEEDS TO BE PASSED NOW. SOLAR PANELS ARE GREAT, BUT NOT
REPLACEMENT FOR GREEN ROOFS. IT IS SO EXCITING FOR CAMBRIDGE AND
FOR ME TO SEE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE PASS. I ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUES
TO AMEND IT SLIGHTLY TO ONLY JUST FOR COMMERCIAL LABS AND
MIXED-USE BUILDINGS WITH THE MAJORITY NOT DEDICATED TO HOUSING TO
MAKE IT CLEAR, WE WILL REQUIRE GREEN ROOF AREA AND I WOULD LOVE TO
SEE BIOSOLAR ON TOP. I THINK IT WILL BECOME ECONOMICALLY MORE
FEASIBLE FOR PEOPLE. NOT JUST FEASIBLE. A MUST-HAVE BECAUSE WE'LL
REMEMBER -- HAVE TO REQUIRE EVERY BUILDING IN THE CITY TO BE FOSSIL
FUEL FREE IN HOPEFULLY 20 YEARS. VERY SOON. WHY NOT START NOW.
SOLAR WILL BE SOMETHING EVERYBODY DOES ANYWAY. THEY MAY NOT DO
GREEN ROOF ANYWAY. THEY HAVE SO MANY OTHER BENEFITS THAT WE
REALLY NEED TO -- MY AMENDMENT IS ON THE SCREEN AND I WELCOME AND
HOPE WE'LL BE ABLE TO PASS THIS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AMENDMENT? I DON'T SEE
ANY HANDS. WE CAN PROCEED TO THE VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT, IT IS ON THE SCREEN.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
(ROLL CALL) MOTION PASSES. FIVE IN FAVOR AND FOUR AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER AMENDMENTS? WE HAVE TO GO TO
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. WE CAN COME BACK TO YOU. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I HAVE TWO AMENDMENTS. TO
STATE WHERE APPLICABLE. AND THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE BISOLAR OR
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS WOULD BE INSTALLED WHERE -- WHERE IT DOES
NOT. SECOND AMENDMENT IS TO CHANGE EFFECTIVE DATE, JUNE 21, 2021.
I'M GLAD CDD PROVIDED US WITH THAT LIST OF BUILDINGS THAT WE
REQUESTED. TO BE CLEAR, IF WE PUSH THIS OUT FOR A YEAR, A LOT OF THE
BUILDINGS WOULDN'T PRODUCE A GREEN ROOF OR SOLAR. AS I MENTIONED
EARLIER, SEVERAL PROJECTS THAT ARE BEFORE THE PLANNING BOARD TODAY
ARE ALREADY INCORPORATED INTO GREEN ROOFS INTO THEIR PROPOSALS
BECAUSE THEY ARE ANTICIPATING US PASSING THIS ORDINANCE. I THINK
PUSHING IT OUT ONE YEAR IS WAY TOO GENEROUS. FURTHERMORE, IF THEY
ARE BEFORE THE PLANNING BOARD OR COMING BEFORE THE PLANNING
BOARD SOON, THE ORDINANCE AS IT IS NOW BEFORE US, PROVIDES FOR THE
OPTION TO GIVE THEM A SPECIAL PERMIT TO REDUCE THE AREA THAT HAS TO
BE COVER ED AS WE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES BEFORE. THEY CAN PAY A FEE
INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST. WE THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO
INCLUDE THIS ORDINANCE MUCH SOONER.

Motion to insert at the end of
22.35.1 the following “except it
shall not apply to affordable
housing buildings that either
are developed under the
Affordable Housing Overlay
(AHO) as defined in Section
11.207 or have a majority of
their units permanently
reserved for households at or
below 100% of AMI.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S AMENDMENTS
BEFORE US. DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES?


PAGE 46

April 26, 2021

QUESTIONS, CONCERNS?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. CAN WE JUST HEAR FROM CDD
ABOUT THE TIMELINE? I KNOW WE OFTEN GIVE A YEAR OF
IMPLEMENTATION ON A NUMBER OF ORDINANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. IS
IT POSSIBLE TO -- IF WE GIVE A YEAR, DOES THAT MEAN PROJECTS THAT
AREN'T CURRENTLY ON THE LIST COULD COME FORWARD WITHIN THAT YEAR
AND THEY WOULD BE EXEMPT. IF THAT IS THE CASE, CAN WE EXEMPT THESE
PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS. A YEAR SEEMS A
LONG TIME, BUT MAYBE A NECESSARY AMOUNT OF TIME TO NOT
NEGATIVELY IMPACT WHAT IS ALREADY GOING FORWARD. IF THEY CAN TALK
ABOUT THAT, HOW THEY ARRIVED AT THAT?
>> MS. FAROOQ: I WILL START US OFF. HOW WE GOT TO THE ONE YEAR, I
THINK I MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER MEETING. IT IS LOOKING AT
A BIG PROJECT THAT THE CITY IS WORKING ON, TOBIN SCHOOL, THINKING
ABOUT WHAT SEEMS REASONABLE IN THAT CONTEXT. I WILL SAY THAT EVEN
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CITY'S PROJECT MANAGER, WHO IS ANXIOUS
ABOUT THE DATE THAT WE HAVE IN THERE AND BEING ABLE TO MEET THAT
IN TERMS OF GETTING PERMITS IN TIME AND NOT HAVING TO DO A BIG
REDESIGN.
THAT WAS OUR MODEL TO THINK THROUGH A PROJECT THAT IS ALREADY
UNDERWAY. WHEN IT WOULD BE HARD TO MAKE A SWITCH AND COULD
TAKE US BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH A
YEAR. AND THEN, LOOKING AT WE DID PROVIDE THE LIST OF PROJECTS WE
KNOW ARE IN FRONT OF THE PLANNING BOARD FOR CONSIDERATION.
COULD WE HAVE A SHORTER TIME FRAME AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO -- I'M
SORRY. THE LONGER TIME WOULD DO TO PROJECTS THAT COME IN,
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT COME IN AFTER THIS IS ADOPTED IT. THAT'S
ONE I WILL PUT TO THE CITY SOLICITOR, I'D SAY THAT IS MORE OF A LEGAL
QUESTION. AND MAYBE JEFF MAY WANT TO WEIGH IN. NANCY, DO YOU
HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT?
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I MISSED THE QUESTION. CAN YOU REPEAT IT?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: IF I MAY... WE HAVE THIS LIST OF PROJECTS
THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PIPELINE, SO TO SPEAK. CONCERN ABOUT
IMPLEMENTING THIS ORDINANCE IMMEDIATELY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY
IMPACT THOSE PROJECTS. WHAT I WONDER, WHAT IF A PROJECT -SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ON THE LIST. SOMETHING NOT BEFORE THE
PLANNING BOARD NOW, BUT IS FILED THREE MONTHS FROM NOW. WE ARE
IMPLEMENTING THIS IN A YEAR, THAT PROJECT -- IF WE WEIGHT A YEAR, MY
GUESS IS THAT PROJECT IS EXEMPT AS WELL. AND I'M NOT SURE WE WANT
TO DO THAT. I WONDER IF THERE IS A WAY TO EXEMPT THESE PROJECTS
THAT ARE ON THE LIST THAT ARE CURRENTLY -- THEY ARE AT A CERTAIN
STAGE. IT WOULDN'T APPLY TO THOSE PROJECTS. IT CAN GO INTO EFFECT
FASTER SO NEW PROJECTS CAN'T JUMP THE TIMELINE? I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
EXPLAINING THAT CORRECTLY.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THANK YOU. ARE YOU SAYING IT IS JUST... WHERE IS THE

PAGE 47

April 26, 2021

LIST. I DON'T SEE IT HERE?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: IT IS NOT ON THE SCREEN NOW. IT IS IN THE
DOCUMENT FROM CDD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU FROZE, SOLICITOR. I THINK SOLICITOR, THERE'S
ISSUES WITH THE ZOOM. WE CAN'T HEAR YOU CLEARLY. IT ISN'T JUST ME? IT
IS FOR EVERYBODY?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I CAN'T HEAR HER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE LOST THE SOLICITOR OR THE SCREEN IS
FROZEN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE I CAN ANSWER
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S QUESTION. THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN
RIGHT NOW, IF THE DEADLINE -- IT LOOKS LIKE MY STRIKE-THROUGHS ARE
NOT ON THE SCREEN. THE APRIL 26 ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DELETED. IF THE
EFFECTIVE DATE IS APRIL 26, 2022, ANY BUILDING THAT GETS A SPECIAL
PERMIT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, THEY ARE ALSO EXEMPT. THE TO
ANSWER THE QUESTION, YES. ANY OTHER BUILDING, EVEN NOT ON THE LIST,
OBTAIN THE PERMIT BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE, WOULD BE EXEMPT,
ACCORDING TO THIS LANGUAGE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: MAYBE WHEN THE SOLICITOR COMES BACK,
WE CAN GO TO OTHER QUESTIONS UNTIL THEN. TO ME, THAT MAKES A
DIFFERENCE. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PROJECTS THAT ARE -EXEMPTING THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ON THEIR WAY IN THE DESIGN PHASE.
FINE. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY DID GREEN ROOFS, CAN I LIVE WITH THAT.
PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT IN FRONT OF THE PLANNING BOARD YET, THEY ARE
STILL BEING WORKED ON IN SOMEONE'S OFFICE THAT MIGHT COME IN NEXT
MONTH, AT THE VERY BEGINNING, WHERE THERE IS STILL AN OPPORTUNITY
TO REDESIGN THEM AND HAVE THEM COMPLY WITH THE ORDINANCE, I'M
LESS EXCITED ABOUT EXEMPTING THEM. THAT'S WHERE LEGAL QUESTION.
DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DATE THAT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY OR
CAN YOU EXEMPT WHAT IS ON THE LIST BECAUSE THEY ARE AT A CERTAIN
POINT IN THE PROCESS. ANYTHING THAT IS NOT ON THE LIST, AT THE VERY
BEGINNING, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN SAID, THAT
COMES TWO MONTHS FROM NOW, THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOLICITOR, ARE YOU BACK?
>> CITY SOLICITOR: IT IS ON AND OFF. I'M HAVING NETWORK PROBLEMS ON
MY LAPTOP AND DESKTOP. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THANK YOU. I THINK THE ANSWER IS I THINK YOU CAN
EXEMPT CERTAIN PROJECTS FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE. I WANTED TO KNOW
IF TONIGHT IS WHEN THE ORDINANCE IS BEING ADOPTED OR IT CAN WAIT
UNTIL NEXT WEEK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN ORDAIN IT TONIGHT.


PAGE 48

April 26, 2021

>> CITY SOLICITOR: OKAY. IF YOU CAN GIVE ME TIME OFFLINE WHILE YOU
CONTINUE YOUR CONVERSATION, I CAN LET YOU KNOW SHORTLY. I WILL
LOOK AT THAT RIGHT NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN ->> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT I THINK JEFF
ROBERTS HAD HIS HAND UP BRIEFLY. HE MIGHT WANT TO RESPOND.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD, JEFF.
>> JEFF ROBERTS: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO PUT OUT A FEW GENERAL
PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMING. ANY PROPOSAL THAT IS
CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF THE PLANNING BOARD, HAS NOT RECEIVED THE
VOTE YET, THAT COULD TAKE ANYWHERE UP TO OR AROUND MAYBE MORE
THAN THREE MONTHS FOR THAT TO GET ITS SPECIAL PERMIT FILED. IN SOME
CASES, WE HAVE USED THREE MONTHS AS AN EFFECTIVE DATE. WE DID THAT
WITH THE GREEN ENERGY ANALYSIS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED A LITTLE
WHILE BACK. THE PREMISE BEING THAT WITHIN THREE MONTHS,
SOMETHING THAT STILL NEEDS TO CLEAR ITS WAY THROUGH THE PLANNING
BOARD PROCESS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK TO DO SIGNIFICANT
ADDITIONAL WORK COULD CONTAIN A PERCEIVE. THE ADDITIONAL CONCERN
IS THAT IT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE -- NOT JUST A PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENT, IT IS A SIGNIFICANT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
REQUIREMENT, WHICH MEANS THAT FOR ANY DEVELOP THAT IS CURRENTLY
IN THE DESIGN PHASE OR MAYBE HAS SUBMITTED PLANS FOR REVIEW AT THIS
POINT, THEY'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND POTENTIALLY REDESIGN, RETHINK
THEIR PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO COME FORWARD.
TO GIVE A SENSE OF THOSE TIME FRAMES, THE DEVELOPMENTS, THE ONES
THAT ARE BEING SUBMITTED, IN FRONT OF THE PLANNING BOARD NOW,
THOSE COULD TAKE ANYWHERE AROUND THREE MONTHS TO GET THAT
SPECIAL PERMIT FILED AND IN PLACE. FOR DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAYBE ARE
CLOSE TO SUBMITTING, BUT STILL HAVEN'T SUBMITTED THEIR APPLICATION
YET, JUST IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF GETTING SCHEDULED FOR A HEARING,
BETWEEN HAVING THE PLAN SUBMITTED AND GETTING THE HEARING
PROCESS, GETTING THE SPECIAL PERMIT APPROVED CAN TAKE SIX MONTHS.
IF THE TIME FRAME OR THE EFFECTIVE DATE IS REALLY SHORT, IT MEANS
THAT THERE'S MANY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE ON THE LIST MIGHT
END UP IN BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD PHASE WHERE THEY HAVE TO DO
SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WORK.
THAT'S JUST SOME INFORMATION TO CONTEMPLATE. THE EFFECTIVE DATE IS
WHAT WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH DEVELOPERS TO ENSURE THEY ARE
DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO HAVE DONE BY THAT DATE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS. ONE,
THESE BUILDINGS WHEN THEY COME THROUGH FOR A SPECIAL PERMIT, THEY
ARE NOT FULLY DESIGNED. THEY ARE ENHANCED SCHEMATIC DESIGN, WHICH
IS THE FIRST PHASE. A LITTLE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT. ALL BUILDINGS ARE


PAGE 49

April 26, 2021

REQUIRED TO BE SOLAR READY. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE SOLAR READY.
WHAT WE'RE DOING, WE ARE ADDING SOLAR. ADDING SOLAR TO THEIR
SCOPE. A GREEN ROOF IS RELATIVELY ALLEGATION TO ADD TO THE BUILDING
IN SCHEMATIC OR DESIGN DEVELOPMENT PHASE.
THESE ARE NOT BIG CHANGES. THEY ARE CHANGES, THAT'S ONE POINT. THE
OTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS WE'RE SAYING SPECIAL PERMIT. LET'S
LOOK AT VOLPE, THEY HAVE EIGHT BUILDINGS OR NINE BUILDINGS. ARE WE
GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE NINTH BUILDING IS DONE AND NOT HAVE GREEN
ROOFS OR SOLAR ON IT? THAT'S FIVE OR EIGHT YEARS OUT. THAT TO ME IS
UNREASONABLE. VERY UNREASONABLE. I'D SAY IT CAN BE A YEAR, BUT
THAT'S FOR BUILDING PERMIT. IN OTHER WORDS, WHY ARE WE GRANTING -I MEAN SOME ZONING HAPPENS THE DAY WE SIGN IT OR ALMOST THE DAY
WE SIGN IT. WE'RE BEING VERY GENEROUS AND WE SHOULD BE WITH
BUILDINGS THAT ARE FAR ALONG.
TOBIN IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE NET-ZERO BUILDINGS. WE CAN
SIMPLY SAY, GREEN OR NET-ZERO. THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE OR SOME
WORDING. I WANT TO BE REASONABLE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ALL OF
KENDALL SQUARE, NEW KENDALL SQUARE AWAY ON THIS. IT SEEMS
RIDICULOUS TO ME. THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY AT THE HEART OF KENDALL
SQUARE. TO NOT HAVE THIS BE IN PLACE, WE'RE MISSING A SIZEABLE CHUNK
OF MITIGATION.
SO BUILDING PERMIT OR SOME METHOD, WE DEFINITELY NEED TO ALTER
THIS. MR. ROBERTS SUGGESTED SIX MONTHS. I QUESTION WHY SPECIAL
PERMITS. WHY IT CAN'T BE ADDED. I REALLY DO. THAT'S MY POINT. THE
TWO POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING BACK TO SOLICITOR GLOWA.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I APOLOGIZE FOR MY TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND
COLLECTING MY THOUGHTS. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF LAWS, UNDER THE
VARIOUS PRINCIPLES, WE CONTINUING IS PERMISSIBLE TO EXEMPT CERTAIN
PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY ARE FAR ALONG IN THE PROCESS, IF THAT IS THE
WILL OF THE COUNCIL. YOU CAN HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DATE THAT WOULD
APPLY TO ALL PROJECTS, EXCEPT FOR ONES THAT ARE ENUMERATED FOR
THAT REASON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE HAVE A FEW HANDS UP. BEFORE
GOING BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, WHO IS THE MOTION-MAKER,
WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S
NOTES AND ALSO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN MENTIONING WE DON'T WANT
THIS TO BECOME SOMETHING THAT WOULD PREVENT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DO AND REMEMBER WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE IT IS SO URGENT,
AGAIN THERE'S WHOLE COUNTRY AND THE STATE IS MOVING FORWARD AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE.
AND THAT'S WHAT IT DOES. ON THIS LIST, AS I READ IT, ALL THE -- THERE ARE
SEVERAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE EXEMPT ENTIRELY. SCHOOL
BUILDING IS ALREADY SLATED TO HAVE SOLAR, WHICH IS WHAT IT WOULD BE

PAGE 50

April 26, 2021

UNDER THE PETITION. CRITICAL POINT, ALL OF VOLPE, ONE BIG PROJECT,
EXEMPTING IT ALL, IF IT TAKES MANY YEARS, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE
SENSE. I WOULD SUPPORT IS THIS JUNE 1, I WILL SUPPORT IF MR. ROBERTS
THINKS IT IS SIX MONTHS, IF THAT MAKES SENSE, ANY BUILDINGS HERE HAVE
TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS WITHIN SIX MONTHS, BUT I THINK A YEAR IS
WAY TOO LONG. AND INCLUDING ALL THE PROJECTS ON THIS LIST SEEM TO
BE COUNTER TO EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO, WHICH IS TO
ENCOURAGE, TO INCENTIVIZE AND REQUIRE A REAL CHANGE THAT WILL
MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE REALLY, REALLY ALREADY HIGHLY
BUILT-UP CITY. I'M EXCITED THIS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR CITY AND
WE HAVE SO FEW OPEN SPACES. IT IS A TINY BREATH OF LITERAL FRESH AIR. I
HOPE WE CAN DO SOMETHING THIS DATE OR A FEW MONTHS. ALL THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THEY ARE NOT AT ISSUE HERE.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOLICITOR GLOWA, ARE YOU SET? OKAY. GOING BACK
TO -- I SEE VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE TOBIN
SCHOOL BUILDING AND I WONDER IF CDD COULD WEIGH IN HERE. IT IS MY
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TOBIN SCHOOL WILL HAVE SOLAR, BUT THAT
WILL NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER THE THIS CURRENT PETITION LANGUAGE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WOULD BE.
SCHOOL IS NOT INCLUDED IN A COMMERCIAL OR LAB BUILDING.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WONDER IF CDD CAN WEIGH IN
AND MAKE SURE.
>> MS. FAROOQ: I WOULD POSE THAT BACK, IF WE WERE JUST A
CONSULTING AMONGST STAFF ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT ALL IS INCLUDED
OR NOT INCLUDED UNDERSTAND THE PRIOR AMENDMENT AND HOW THAT
MIGHT TREAT ACADEMIC BUILDINGS, WHETHER THEY WOULD BE CITY -- LIKE
THE SCHOOL OR WHETHER THEY ARE ACADEMIC BUILDINGS AT UNIVERSITIES.
AND THAT WAS NOT CLEAR TO US FROM THE AMENDMENT. IT WOULD BE
HELPFUL TO CLARIFY.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. WHOM ARE YOU HOPING TO GET
THAT CLARIFIED FROM? WE'RE ON THE EVE OF ORDINATION HERE. I WANT
TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE LANGUAGE IN PLACE IN FRONT OF US THAT WE
VOTE ON THAT IS CLEAR. IT SEEMS TO BE UNCLEAR AT THE MOMENT.
>> MS. FAROOQ: THAT'S A FAIR POINT. I THINK GETTING THE CLARIFICATION
FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN RIGHT NOW IS HELPFUL. AND I THINK THAT I
THEN -- SINCE WE ARE WORKING VERY MUCH ON THE FLY, IN THE PUBLIC
FORUM, I POSE THE QUESTION TO BOTH JEFF ROBERTS AND NANCY GLOWA
TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THOUGHTS ON WHETHER THE LANGUAGE AS VOTED
UPON IS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR IN TERMS OF HOW IT TREATS ACADEMIC
BUILDINGS OR WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARIFICATION.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: IF I MAY, AS A POINT OF INFORMATION, THE


PAGE 51

April 26, 2021

PETITION EXPIRES NEXT MONDAY? IS THAT CORRECT? MR. CLERK?
>> MR. CLERK: GIVE ME ONE SECOND. I WILL PULL IT UP. RIGHT NOW IT
EXPIRES ON MAY 5.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: NEXT WEDNESDAY. CORRECT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I'M GOING ON RECORD AND SAYING I'M
CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND WE'RE
DOING A LOT OF THIS ON THE FLOOR AND ON THE FLY TONIGHT. WE DO
HAVE ONE MORE WEEK WHERE WE COULD HAVE CDD WORK THROUGH THIS
WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT. I KNOW SOLICITOR GLOWA HAS CONCERNS. I
WILL THROW THAT OUT THERE. I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE AMOUNT
OF AMENDMENTS AND UNCLEAR LANGUAGE. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL
WEEK WITH WHICH TO WORK. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK -- I ASKED A
QUESTION. AND ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER FAROOQ TOSSED IT FOR
CLARIFICATION. I WANT TO GET ON THE RECORD THE DATE OF THE
EXPIRATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE A FEW HANDS. I WILL RECOGNIZE AND MAKE
SURE I COME BACK TO SOLICITOR GLOWA, IF YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
ON WHAT IS SAID?
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THANK YOU. YES, I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M
UNDERSTANDING, WE TALK ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS FOR
COMMERCIAL LABS AND ALL MIXED-USE BUILDINGS WITH A MAJORITY OF
SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT DEDICATED TO HOUSING. 80% OF THE ROOF AREA AS
MEASURED IN PLAIN VIEW, EXCLUDING PORTIONS VISIBLE SHALL BE DEVOTED
TO GREEN ROOF AREA... ASSUMING THAT'S THE LANGUAGE, IT SEEMS TO ME
IT COULD USE CLARIFICATION BECAUSE IT IS NEITHER -- ACADEMIC BUILDING
IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY OF THE CATEGORIES. NOT COMMERCIAL, NOT LAB,
NOT MIX-USED, NOR IS IT RESIDENTIAL. I THINK IT CAN BENEFIT FROM
CLARIFICATION.
THE OTHER QUESTION THAT AROSE AS TO WHETHER THE TOBIN SCHOOL
COULD MEET THE REQUIREMENTS, I WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE PROJECT
DIRECTOR INDICATED WE ARE PUTTING SOLAR -- HE STATED, THE CITY IS
PUTTING SOLAR ON THE ROOF OF THE NEW TOBIN SCHOOL OVER A MAJORITY
OF THE OPEN ROOF AREA. BECAUSE OF ISSUES SUCH AS SAFE PATHWAYS FOR
FIRE FIGHTERS, HVAC EQUIPMENT, LEARNING AND TEACHING SPACE AND
OTHER MAINTENANCE PATHS, WE CAN'T HIT THE OVERALL GOAL AS STATED
IN THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS FAIRLY CLOSE.
>> I TALKED TO BRENDAN. IT IS TRUE. AND SO, I THINK THAT AS YOU KNOW
THE TOBIN SCHOOL IS IN A VERY, VERY TIGHT TIMELINE. I THINK IF WE HAVE
ANY DELAYS, IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE PROJECT. AND I THINK THIS IS VERY
COMPLICATED. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO STRUGGLE WOULD TRYING
TO EXEMPT CERTAIN PROJECTS. I THINK IT MAY BE WISE TO DO THAT TO KEEP
THE TOBIN ON TRACK AND NOT HAVE TO HAVE ANY UNFORESEEN DELAYS
THAT COULD DELAY THE TIMELINE OR FRANKLY, DEPENDING ON HOW IT


PAGE 52

April 26, 2021

SHAKES OUT, ANY DELAY IN MOVING THE KIDS OUT OF THE SCHOOL BECAUSE
WE ARE NOT READY TO MOVE IN COMPLETING THE DESIGN. I THROW THAT
OUT THERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, PER THE
CLERK, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE AMENDMENTS. I GO BACK TO
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: ONE SUGGESTION, WE VOTE ON THEM
SEPARATELY. THE TWO PARAGRAPHS AND WE CAN RESOLVE THE DEADLINE,
THE EFFECTIVE DATE ISSUE SEPARATELY. AND WITH REGARDS TO TOBIN
SCHOOL, WE MIGHT HAVE A REASONABLE REMEDIES BY ADDING -- WE CAN
ADD TO THE AMENDMENT SO IT IS CLEAR WE ARE NOT REFERRING TO ANY
MUNICIPAL BUILDING.
ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE, THE LANGUAGE DOES SAY BUILDING PERMIT -BUILDING OR SPECIAL PERMIT. TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S POINT,
REGARDING VOLPE, THAT WOULD STILL EXEMPT ALL THE VOLPE BUILDINGS
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE A SPECIAL PERMIT. MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE
THAT LANGUAGE TO BUILDING PERMIT ONLY. BUILDING OR SPECIAL PERMIT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I BELIEVE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
MASTER PLAN SPECIAL PERMIT AND A BUILDING SPECIAL PERMIT. AT LEAST
MY MEMORY OF MY WORK WITH COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IS -- I'D LIKE
SOMEONE TO SAY YES/NO. ARE THERE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPECIAL
PERMITS? IF SO, I'D SAY, TO A BUILDING PERMIT OR A BUILDING SPECIAL
PERMIT. NOT A PROJECT SPECIAL PERMIT. AT THE SAME TIME, PROJECTS
THAT ARE IN THE BUILDING SPECIAL PERMIT, LIKE CAMBRIDGESIDE, I VOTED
AGAINST IT, LIKE CAMBRIDGESIDE, THEY ARE SO FAR IN THE PROCESS, YES I
CAN SEE THEY SHOULDN'T BE FORCED ON WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING TO
BUILD IN THE FIRST PHASE. SECOND PHASE, SHOULD BE TIED INTO THIS.
I THINK WHAT I SAID IS CORRECT ABOUT THE SPECIAL PERMITS. AND SO
BUILDING SPECIAL PERMIT WOULD BE WHERE A BUILDING THAT IS ALREADY
BEEN APPROVED AND A MASTER PLAN GETS MORE SPECIFIC BEFORE THEY
GET A BUILDING PERMIT. I CAN SEE THAT BEING THE DIFFERENCE. NOT A
GENERAL MASTER PLAN SPECIAL PERMIT. I THINK THAT IS A TERRIBLE
PRECEDENT FOR ANYTHING NEW ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS WE'RE
HEADING INTO.

>> MS. FAROOQ: I WILL ASK JEFF TO SPEAK TO THIS. I DO THINK THAT
PERHAPS THE PROCEDURE MAY HAVE CHANGED. THE SPECIAL PERMIT, FROM
MY UNDERSTANDING, THE MASTER PLAN PROJECT, IT IS AT THE PLANNING
AND DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL STAGE. AND WE HAVE DESIGN REVIEW FOR
INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS. THAT'S NOT THE ACTUAL PERMIT. JEFF, WOULD YOU
ELABORATE ON THAT, PLEASE?
>> JEFF: SURE. THANK YOU. I CAN QUICKLY SAY THAT I THINK THE
DISTINCTION THAT IS IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT FOR MOST SPECIAL PERMITS,
IT IS A SPECIAL PERMIT FOR A SINGLE FASHION OF DEVELOPMENT THAT IS


PAGE 53

April 26, 2021

PERMITTED AND THEN AFTER THE SPECIAL PERMIT, IT IS A BUILDING PERMIT
AND BUILDS OUT AND COMPLETED. FOR SOME, PUD SPECIAL PERMIT, THE
TIME FRAME IS LONGER BECAUSE DEVELOPMENT OCCURS IN DIFFERENT
PHASES OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE
CONDITIONS OF THE SPECIAL PERMIT DICTATE HOW REQUIREMENTS PLAY
OUT AND HOW THE PHASING OF THE DEVELOPMENT WOULD UNFOLD.
IN SOME OF THE PUD DEVELOPMENT THAT THE PLANNING BOARD IS
PERMITTED LATELY, IT HAS PROVISIONS IN THE CONDITIONS THAT SAY, FOR
EXAMPLE, IF THE CITY'S GREEN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS INVOLVE OVER
TIME, IT WILL SET THAT TIME FRAME FOR NEW BUILDINGS THAT
UNDERGOING DESIGN REVIEW. COME INTO REQUIREMENTS FOR WHATEVER
STANDARDS ARE APPLICABLE. I THINK THE CITY SOLICITOR, I'D LIKE TO DEFER
TO THE CITY SOLICITOR ON THE GENERAL QUESTION OF HOW ZONING
CHANGES, ZONING AMENDMENTS TAKE EFFECT FOR DEVELOPMENTS THAT
RECEIVED A SPECIAL PERMIT.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: IF I MAY?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOLICITOR?
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THANK YOU. UNDER STATE LAW, 40-A, ANYONE WITH A
BUILDING OR SPECIAL PERMIT THAT WAS OBTAINED BEFORE THE DATE OF
THE FIRST ADVERTISEMENT FOR AMENDMENT IS EXEMPT. FROM THE
PROVISIONS OF THE AMENDMENT. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE COUNCIL
CAN CHANGE. THE ISSUE ABOUT PUD SPECIAL PERMIT BEING DIFFERENT IS
BECAUSE THEY ARE OVER A LONG BUILD-OUT. LIKE 10-20 YEARS
FREQUENTLY. THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN PROPONENTS OF PROJECTS
COME IN TO AMEND THE SPECIAL PERMITS AND QUESTIONS ARISE AS TO
WHETHER THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES OF THE ZONING
ORDINANCE SINCE THEY OBTAINED THE SPECIAL PERMIT. FOR PURPOSES OF
JUST LOOKING AT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, AS FAR AS THE ENACTMENT OF
THIS AMENDMENT, ANYONE WHO DOES HAVE A BUILDING PERMIT OR
SPECIAL PERMIT THEY HAD BEFORE THE FIRST ADVERTISEMENT, WOULD BE
EXEMPT FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AMENDMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: IF I MAY? I ACCEPT THAT. IT MAKES SENSE.
FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, BUT IT FURTHER STATES HOW FAR BEHIND
THE BALL WE ARE AS A CITY ENVIRONMENTALLY. I'M NOT ACCUSING
ANYBODY, I'M MAKING A CASE THAT THE NEXT WHAT -- 12 OR 14 BUILDINGS
IN KENDALL SQUARE WILL NOT HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT. SOME OF THE
BIGGEST BUILDING -- THE BIGGEST BUILDINGS IN THE CITY. THAT'S A SAD
CASE. I THINK THAT'S A VERY SAD CASE. I THINK WE SHOT OURSELVES IN THE
FOOT. I'M VERY DISCOURAGED BY THAT. I'D SAY ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T
HAVE A SPECIAL PERMIT AS OF MONDAY, NEXT MONDAY, SHOULDN'T GET A
FREE RIDE ON THIS. THAT MAKES ME EVEN MORE FIRM ABOUT ANYTHING
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIAL PERMIT. OR A BUILDING PERMIT. I'D GIVE
NOT EVEN A WEEK GIVEN THAT WE JUST -- MAJOR AMOUNT OF
DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT BE AS GREEN AS IT SHOULD BE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I LOOK AT THE CLOCK. WE HAVE AMENDMENTS


PAGE 54

April 26, 2021

BEFORE US. I WILL RECOGNIZE THE TWO HANDS THAT CAME. AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, WE'LL GO TO YOUR AMENDMENTS AND PROCEED.
I GO TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN BACK
TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I HAVE A QUESTION ON COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN'S AMENDMENT FOR THE CITY SOLICITOR. ON THE EFFECTIVE
DATE. HE HAS TWO AMENDMENTS. EFFECTIVE DATE. I WILL MAKE SURE I
READ THIS RIGHT. PROVISIONS... SHALL NOT APPLY TO STRUCTURES
LAWFULLY IN EXISTENCE. THAT'S CAREER. OR LEGALLY BEGUN BEFORE JUNE
1, 2021. OR TO A BUILDING OR SPECIAL PERMIT ISSUED BEFORE JUNE 21,
2021. TAKE EFFECT ON JUNE 1, 2021. THAT EXEMPTS EVERYTHING ON THE
LIST. THEY ALL HAVE THOSE THINGS BEFORE JUNE 1? NO? OKAY. LAWFULLY
BEGUN BEFORE JUNE 1, 2021. THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO... THE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CDD CHART? THEY HAVE LAWFULLY BEGUN BEFORE
JUNE 1, 2021.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: SHALL NOT APPLY TO STRUCTURES LAWFULLY IN
EXISTENCE OR BEGUN, THAT MEANS THE BUILDING. THAT WOULDN'T APPLY
WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTS THAT ARE IN A PLANNING PHASE PRIOR TO
STARTING ACTUAL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WILL END ON THIS I DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY
PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PIPELINE TO DELAY THEM. I WORRY
ABOUT NEW PROJECTS HAVING THAT MUCH OF A LEAD TIME. HOPEFULLY,
WE CAN REACH SOME SORT OF CONSENSUS ON THAT OR COMPROMISE ON
THAT. OTHERWISE, I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN'S AMENDMENT. I AGREE WITH VICE MAYOR MALLON, MAYBE
THIS IS SOMETHING -- WE HAVE ANOTHER WEEK. NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT MONDAY IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT. IF WE
NEED TO TAKE A WEEK TO CLARIFY THIS, WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE OUR
TIME.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I HAVE CLARIFYING -- DID I JUST HEAR
THE SOLICITOR CORRECTLY. THE MIT VOLPE COULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO THIS?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: ANY OTHER PROJECTS ON THE LIST FOR WHICH
THAT IS TRUE? WE ALREADY KNOW THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PART. AND
IF I CLARIFY, I WOULD LIKE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN TO CLEAR IT APPLIES TO
NONMUNICIPAL BUILDINGS, WHICH MEANS THE TOBIN SCHOOL. ANY OTHER
PROJECTS SIMILAR TO THAT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL GO TO JEFF.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT'S ANOTHER PUD AT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE.
>> JEFF: TO CLARIFY THE RECORD. THE LIST THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE
MEMO THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY STAFF, INCLUDES PROJECTS THAT ARE -HAVE NOT RECEIVED A SPECIAL PERMIT OR IF NOT REQUIRED TO RECEIVE A
SPECIAL PERMIT, A BUILDING PERMIT, PRIOR TO THE FIRST ADVERTISEMENT


PAGE 55

April 26, 2021

OF THIS ZONING PETITION.
SO, WITHOUT A STATED EFFECTIVE DATE, THE ZONING COULD BE SUBJECT TO
THE DEVELOPMENT ON THIS LIST AND FUTURE PROPOSALS. THAT'S WHY THIS
LIST WAS PROVIDED AND THE TIMING AT -- SOME HAVE RECEIVED THEIR
SPECIAL PERMIT. BETWEEN THE FIRST ADVERTISEMENT AND RIGHT NOW US
TALKING. MOST OF THE PROPOSALS ON THIS LIST ARE STILL EITHER UNDER
REVIEW OR IN WHAT WE CALL PRE-APPLICATION PHASE.
THEY HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING COMMUNITY DISCUSSIONS, WHICH ARE
REQUIRED PART OF THE PLANNING BOARD REVIEW OR OTHER REVIEW.
HAVEN'T YET SUBMITTED APPLICATION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. WE ARE TOLD ONE IS NOT SUBJECT TO
IT ANYWAY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T HAVE BUILDING PERMIT, RIGHT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOLICITOR? GO AHEAD, JEFF.
>> JEFF ROBERTS: NO. IF I CAN CLARIFY MY COMMENT. IF IT WAS
CONFUSING. I RESPONDED TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S RAISING THE POINT
THAT THERE ARE SOME DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS SPECIAL
PERMIT AND BUILT OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN MULTIPLE BUILDINGS.
INCLUDING A NUMBER OF THE DEVELOPMENT SITES IN KENDALL SQUARE,
THAT IS HOW THE MIT VOLPE SITE IS PROPOSED, BUT IT DOESN'T RECEIVE THE
SPECIAL PERMIT. THEY RECEIVED A PRELIMINARY -- THEY REQUIRE TWO-STEP
PROJECT FOR APPROVAL. NOT TO GET TOO DEEP INTO THE WEEDS, THEY
COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP, BUT NOT RECEIVED THE SPECIAL PERMIT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IF WE PASS THIS TOMORROW, EFFECTIVE
TOMORROW, THEY WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW IT OR NOT? AM I THE ONLY
ONE--I THOUGHT WE WERE TOLD...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL CLARIFY THE STATEMENTS.
>> MS. FAROOQ: I WILL CLARIFY THAT POINT. NO, I DON'T THINK THAT
STATEMENT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT. I THINK THIS WAS GOING THROUGH
THE BACK-AND-FORTH, IF THE SPECIAL PERMIT IS FOR THE ENTIRE PUD
DEVELOPMENT, A MULTIUNIT OR MULTIBUILDING MASTER PLAN
DEVELOPMENT THAT BUILDS OUT OVER TIME WOULD HAVE AN EXEMPTION -WOULD HAVE A LATE START DATE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE SPECIAL
PERMIT TO BE IT GRANTED. WOULD THAT MEAN NONE OF THE FUTURE
BUILDINGS WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE ZONING. I'D SAY
THERE'S TWO PIECES TO THAT.
IF IS JUST THE AMENDMENT, IT IS TRUE THEY MAY NOT BE SUBJECT IF THERE
IS A WINDOW THAT ALLOWS TO GET PUD SPECIAL PERMIT. THEY WOULDN'T
BE SUBJECT. BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. HOWEVER, I THINK AS JEFF
WAS NOTING, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE PLANNING BOARD HAS MADE A
PRACTICE OF IS ACTUALLY FOR THINGS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
THAT EVOLVE OVER TIME. OR SIMILARLY, INCLUSIONARY -- I'M SORRY.
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. THEY ARE WRITING IN THAT THE BUILDINGS THAT GET
BUILT OUT IN THE FUTURE ARE ACTUALLY SUBJECT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL
REGULATIONS, MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN EFFECT AT THE TIME


PAGE 56

April 26, 2021

THEY ARE GOING FOR THE BUILDING PERMIT. IT IS NOT ACTUALLY -- LEGALLY
THERE IS FROM A STATE LAW PERSPECTIVE, THEY WOULDN'T BE SUBJECT.
BUT THE PLANNING BOARD CAN WRITE THAT IN AS THEIR CONDITION, WHICH
THEY HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF DOING.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THEY CAN BE SUBJECT TO THIS. THANK YOU.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I WILL ADD, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, FOR MANY OF THE
VERY LARGE PROJECTS, THEY DO COME IN OVER TIME. IF IT IS A PUD, SPECIAL
PERMIT, TO GET AMENDMENTS. AND THE LAW DOESN'T PROTECT A PROJECT
THAT HAD A PRIOR SPECIAL PERMIT. IF THEY COME IN FOR A NEW SPECIAL
PERMIT, THAT'S WHAT AN AMENDMENT LEGALLY IS, THEN THEY ARE SUBJECT
TO THE LAW AT THE TIME. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, MOST OF THE VERY
LARGE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO END UP BEING SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT HAD
GONE INTO EFFECT SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ORIGINAL PERMITTING. IT
SOUNDS LIKE MS. FAROOQ IS SAYING THAT THE VOLPE DOESN'T HAVE A
SPECIAL PERMIT YET. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS
AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS FOR CLARIFYING THE RECORD. I THINK THAT
WAS THE CONFUSION. GOING BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN ON THE
AMENDMENTS BEFORE US.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WILL REMIND MY COLLEAGUES
THE LANGUAGE THAT IS BEFORE US INCLUDES A PROVISION WHERE THE
PLANNING BOARD CAN REDUCE THE REQUIRED AREA THROUGH A SPECIAL
PERMIT. AND THEN THE PROJECT WILL HAVE TO PAY INTO THE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING TRUST. IF IT TURNS OUT FOR WHATEVER REASON, IT IS NOT
FEASIBLE FOR A PROJECT TO COMPLY, WE ALREADY HAVE A REMEDY BUILT IN.
AGAIN, I WOULD ASK THAT WE VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS SEPARATELY
AND I DO SUPPORT THE NOTION WE DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY ORDAIN
TONIGHT, BUT I THINK IT IS USEFUL TO ADOPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS AND
HAVE A SINGLE ORDINANCE THAT WE'D LIKE TO ORDAIN AND SEE IF IT CAN BE
REVIEWED FURTHER AND MAKE FINAL TWEAKS, IF NECESSARY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK, CAN YOU TAKE THE ROLL INDIVIDUALLY
ACCORDING TO THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US. PLEASE CLARIFY IF
NECESSARY.
>> MR. CLERK: THE FIRST VOTE IS ON THE INSERTING INTO PARAGRAPH
22.35.2, THE WORDS INCLUDING WHERE APPLICABLE AFTER THE WORDS TO
GREEN ROOF AREA. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: NO.

Motion to add to end of 22.35.2
the following language “For
commercial, labs, and all
mixed-use buildings with a
majority of square footage not
dedicated to housing, at least
80% of the roof area of the
building as measured in plan
view, excluding those portions
of the roof listed below, shall be
devoted to Green Roof Area, or
Biosolar Green Roof Area”

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.


PAGE 57

April 26, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO.
>> MR. CLERK: MOTION PASSES, FIVE IN FAVOR AND FOUR AGAINST. NEXT
VOTE, INSERTING -- ON AMENDING PARAGRAPH 22.35.4. AMENDMENT IS TO
DELETE THE WORDS APRIL 26, 2022 WHERE THEY APPEAR AND IN THEIR
PLACE, INSERT THE WORDS JUNE 1, 2021. ON THE MOTION:

Amend 22.35.4 delete all
instances of “April 26, 2022”
and replace with “June 1,
2021”

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES I'M SORRY. NO.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: FIVE IN FAVOR AND FOUR AGAINST.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: CAN YOU HAVE THE CLERK CLARIFY ON THE FIRST
AMENDMENT. I BELIEVE IT FAILED.
>> MR. CLERK: VOTE ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT? IT PASSED, FIVE IN FAVOR
AND FOUR AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WAS A NO.
>> MR. CLERK: PARDON ME. I WILL MAKE THE CORRECTION. COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN IS A NO. MOTION FAILS, FOUR IN FAVOR AND FIVE AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. POINT OF ORDER. AMENDMENT
ON THE DATE IS TO REPLACE THE APRIL DATES WITH JUNE 1.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT'S WHAT THE CLERK SAID.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I HEARD HIM SAY INSERT THE JUNE DATE. IT IS
REPLACE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MS. FAROOQ?
>> MS. FAROOQ: NOT TO BE SELFISH ON BEHALF OF THE CITY, I WONDER -- I
THOUGHT I HEARD COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN MAYBE SAYING OR SPEAK
ABOUT EXEMPTING MUNICIPAL BUILDING FROM THIS EFFECTIVE DATE. IS
THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE MODIFIED?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY SUGGESTION WAS TO ADD
THAT EXEMPTION TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS INTRODUCED THROUGH
COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S AMENDMENT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AND
LABORATORY BUILDINGS. THAT AMENDMENT WOULD REQUIRE A GREEN
ROOF, WHEREAS THE OVERALL PROVISION AS IT IS NOW, TOBIN SCHOOL, FOR


PAGE 58

April 26, 2021

EXAMPLE, WOULD SATISFY IT. THAT WAS MY SUGGESTION ON THAT
AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN DO YOU WANT TO OFFER IT
BEFORE WE MOVE ON?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: SURE. I THINK IT WOULD SAY... IN SECTION
22.32, WE ADDED TO COMMERCIAL LABS AND ALL MIXED-USED BUILDING S
WITH THE MAJORITY OF SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT DEDICATED TO AFFORDABLE
HOUSING... WE CAN ADD MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS.
>> MR. CLERK: MAY I ASK, THE AMENDMENT AND YOU INTEND TO INSERT
THE WORD MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS. INSERT THAT. RIGHT NOW THE
EXEMPTION IS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, MIXED-USED BUILDINGS -- I
WILL PUT IT ON THE SCREEN. IT MAY HELP. FOR CLARIFICATION, FOR THE
RECORD, WHERE DO YOU PUT THE AMENDMENT?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: AFTER SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT DEDICATED TO
HOUSING, PUT A COMMA. INSERT AFTER THAT EXEMPTING MUNICIPAL
BUILDINGS.
>> MR. CLERK: AFTER THE WORDS DEDICATED TO HOUSING, INSERT THE
WORD, BUT EXEMPTING ANY MUNICIPAL BUILDING S.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: CORRECT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SAW COUNCILLOR TOOMEY'S HAND. AND THEN VICE
MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. TO THE CITY SOLICITOR, FOR
CLARIFICATION, WOULD THIS EXEMPTION FOR MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS OPEN
ANY TYPE OF A LEGAL CHALLENGE FROM COMMERCIAL OWNERS, TWO-TIER
ORDINANCE. I'M CURIOUS IS THIS SUBJECT TO A LEGAL APPEAL BECAUSE OF
OUR EXEMPTING ONE CLASS OF PROPERTY OVER ANOTHER.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THE ANSWER IS NO. MUNICIPALITIES CAN EXEMPT
MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS FROM ALL ZONING REQUIREMENTS. CAMBRIDGE HAS
HISTORICALLY INCLUDED THE CITY IN MANY REQUIREMENTS, BUT WE'RE
PERMITTED NOT TO. IT WOULD BE EXCLUDING THE ENTIRE CLASSIFICATION
OF MUNICIPAL PROJECTS AND NOT JUST SINGLE OUT USES OR BUILDING IN
ONE ZONING DISTRICT OR OTHER. I BELIEVE IT WOULDN'T BE SUCCESSFULLY
CHALLENGE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I FEEL LIKE I'M UNCOMFORTABLE
EXEMPTING MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS FROM AN ORDINANCE THAT IS SO
CRITICAL TO THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY IN FRONT OF US. I THINK IT IS IRONIC
AND HYPOCRITICAL FOR US TO EXEMPT OUR BUILDINGS WHEN WE MAKE
THIS LARGE ZONING CHANGE FOR THE OTHERS. FOR OTHER PEOPLE. FOR
OTHER BUILDERS, MIT, HARVARD, AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS. I THINK
MS. FAROOQ SAID IT, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO. I HATE TO BE SELFISH
AND I WANT THIS EXEMPTION, I THINK SHE IS RIGHT. SELFISH MAY NOT BE
THE WORD, BUT I FEEL TREMENDOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND
HYPOCRITICAL MOVING FORWARD WITH A MUNICIPAL BUILDING EXEMPTION


PAGE 59

April 26, 2021

WHEN THE CITY HAS TRIED TO BE THE LEADER IN OUR OWN BUILDINGS.
LOOK AT THE NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND LOOK ALL OF THE BUILDINGS WE
CREATED, WE HAVE BEEN A LEADER. I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS CAME ABOUT.
I THINK IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE FACT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OPTIONS LIKE
THE AMENDMENT THAT I HAD PUT FORWARD LAST WEEK. WE SHOULD HAVE
A SOLAR AMENDMENT SO WE WOULDN'T BE IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE
PICK OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED AND THOSE WHO ARE
NOT. I WILL BE A NO ON THIS JUST BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD STAND IN
OUR TRUTH AND STANDING IN AND SAYING WHAT IS GOOD FOR US IS GOOD
FOR THEM. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. TO CLARIFY, THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING ALL MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS
NET-ZERO. AND WE'RE NOT EXEMPTING MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS FROM THE
ENTIRE ORDINANCE. WE ARE EXEMPTING FROM THE PROVISION AND WITH
ADDED AMENDMENTS FROM COUNCILLOR NOLAN. MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS
ARE STILL SUBJECT TO THE OVERALL ORDINANCE, WHICH REQUIRE THEM TO
BE SOLAR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE ON THE AMENDMENT BEFORE US? I
DON'T SEE HANDS. CAN YOU TAKE THE ROLL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION TO ADD THE AMENDMENT PROPOSED BY
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN TO INSERT THE WORD AND EXEMPTING MY
MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS AFTER THE WORDS TO HOUSING... WHICH WAS
PREVIOUSLY AMENDED ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN. ON THE
MOTION:

QZ amendment to insert the
words “but exempting any
municipal buildings,” at the
words “to housing” in the
previously amended 22.35.2

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: SIX IN FAVOR AND THREE AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF ORDER. I WAS A NO.
>> MR. CLERK: FIVE IN FAVOR AND FOUR AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK THE PETITION ON THE UNFINISHED CALENDAR
CAN REMAIN THERE FOR A WEEK. AND I THINK I WOULD SUGGEST THAT.
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, THERE MAY BE SOME -- GIVEN THE HOUR AND
EVERYTHING DISCUSSED. I THINK I WOULD RECOMMEND LEAVING IT ON THE
TABLE. NEXT MONDAY IS THE THIRD. WE CAN ORDAIN NEXT MONDAY AND IT

PAGE 60

April 26, 2021

EXPIRES PER THE CLERK WEDNESDAY, MAY 5TH. LEAVE IT ON THE TABLE AND
PROCEED?
>> MR. CLERK: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. WE'LL DO THAT AND NOW WE MOVE TO THE
ACTUAL CALENDAR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: BEFORE THE MANAGER AND THE SOLICITOR
LEAVE, I'D LIKE TO THE BRING UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE
SOLICITOR'S MEMO ON OUR DESIRE TO HAVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION. I
THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME GOOD THINGS TO DISCUSS HERE. I'D LIKE TO
MOVE THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE, THERE WAS THE CHARTER
RIGHT THAT WAS EXERCISED. MOTION IS BEFORE US. THE CHARTER RIGHT
WAS EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I CAN GO TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS WHO PROBABLY WOULD MAKE THE SAME MOTION. I'LL GO TO
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN WE CAN PROCEED TO THE SOLICITOR FOR
THE MEMO DISCUSSION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. A FEW QUESTIONS. FIRST, PART OF
THE REASON I MOVED THE CHARTER RIGHT I WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO
MORE FACT-FINDING. TALKING TO OTHERS IN THE FIELD TO UNDERSTAND
THE CHARTER AND WHAT THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UNDER THE
CHARTER, PARTICULARLY AS IT COMES TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE INTENT TO
HIRE. AND MY QUESTION TO MY -- I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET THAT
INFORMATION, IT WAS A HOLIDAY WEEK. PEOPLE WERE OFF AND DOING
THINGS. I WRESTLE WHAT IS THE INTENT OF THE ORDER. MY QUESTION TO
THE MOTION-MAKER, IN PARTICULAR, IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH, IT SPEAK S
TO THE CAMBRIDGE CITY CHARTER GRANT. YOU HIT THE LINK, IT WILL SPEAK
TO CITY COUNCIL SHALL HAVE AND EXERCISE ALL LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF
THE CITY. IN THAT INSTANCE, I SUSPECT THAT THE MOTION-MAKER WILL
LOOK TO CHAPTER 43 UNDER THE MGL.
MY DIFFICULTY HERE, I UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT AND THE INTENT HAVING
SERVED IN THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE WHERE WE HAVE ON OCCASION HIRED
INDEPENDENT LEGAL OPINIONS, FOR A LACK OF A BETTER WORD, FOR THE
PURPOSE OF HIRING A SUPERINTENDENT. MAYBE I FORGET. MY QUESTION
IS, IS THE REQUEST TO HAVE MONEY SET ASIDE, WHICH IS 5%, OF THE
SOLICITOR'S BUDGET, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. TO HIRE ON DEMAND
OR IS THE INTENT TO TRY TO HIRE AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROVIDE LEGAL
RESOURCES. THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION, I WILL ASK, TO THE LEAD
SPONSOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION. THE
INTENT LAYS IT OUT IN THE RESOLVED, I HAVE A COUPLE OF AMENDMENT
ORDERS. CHANGE THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT. THE PROCEDURE LAYS OUT
THE METHOD WE GO ABOUT. THE CITY COUNCIL AND WHEN THE MAJORITY
OF THE COUNCILLORS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OUTSIDE LEGAL RESEARCH ON
AN ISSUE, CAN EXERCISE THAT. IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC AND
WOULD LIKE ASSISTANCE WITH OUTSIDE LEGAL RESEARCH. AN ISSUE WHERE

PAGE 61

April 26, 2021

THE COUNCIL IS DRAFTING AN ORDINANCE, MOST OF US ARE NOT LAWYERS
THEMSELVES. WE NEED OUTSIDE LEGAL RESEARCH IN DRAFTING UP
SOMETHING. WHETHER IT IS AN GRIEVANCE ORDINANCE, CAMPAIGN
FINANCE, AND MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL WILL MAKE THE DECISION AND
THE COUNCIL CAN DECIDE WHO TO GO WITH. AND I IMAGINE THE COUNCIL,
WE DO OUR TERM DISCUSSION OF THE RULES, WOULD SET UP RULES ABOUT
FOR EACH DECISION, IT CAN BE MORE THAN 10% OF THE LEGAL BUDGET.
THOSE ARE THE RULES WE SET OURSELVES. AND THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE
WHICH LAW FIRM WE WANT TO GO WITH. AND THERE'S DIFFERENT LAW
FIRMS IN MASSACHUSETTS THAT SPECIALIZE IN MUNICIPAL LAW, CITY
COUNCILS IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES, THEY HIRE THEIR OWN OUTSIDE LEGAL
RESEARCH, THERE ARE OPTIONS. IT WOULD BE UP TO THE COUNCIL TO
DECIDE THE SPECIFICS OF HOW MUCH AND WHAT LAW FIRM TO GO WITH. IT
IS UP TO THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL IN A PUBLIC MEETING MAKE THAT
DECISION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M STILL NOT CLEAR. ON SOME
LEVEL I'M UNDERSTANDING THE INTENT. I'M TORN AROUND, ARE WE HIRING
-- WE ARE NOT AIMING TO DO UNDER THE CHARTER. ARE WE HAVING A
SLUSH FUND OR A FUND OF MONEY SET ASIDE TO -- IT STILL SEEMS HIRE
OUTSIDE LEGAL REPRESENTATION. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN AND I DO KNOW YOU
HAVE SOME WORK ON THIS, AND ALL DUE RESPECT, I WANT TO HEAR FROM
ANOTHER AUTHORITY. I DID GET THE LETTER, WE ALL OFFER FROM HAVING
ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGY. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO READ
THE LETTER. I HOPE THE SOLICITOR WILL SPEAK TO IT. I WANT TO SUPPORT
MY COLLEAGUES, BUT I CLEARLY HAVE DIFFICULTY. I THINK WE ARE STEPPING
OUTSIDE OUR LEGAL ABILITY BY WAY OF A CHARTER.
I ALMOST WANT TO RECOMMEND, IF IT WERE THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL,
SEND THIS TO GOVERNMENT OPS TO HAVE A THOROUGH PULLING APART
AND ANALYZING OF WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO. IT IS ONE THING TO SAY,
DECIDE WHAT ISSUE YOU WANT THE SOLICITOR WEIGH IN AND WHAT NOT
TO, I DON'T WANT TO -- I THINK THE CITY SOLICITOR WILL OPINE IN A
MANNER THAT I WON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME SO I WON'T ASK.
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT. I'M REALLY STRUGGLING. COUPLE OF
THINGS, REFER THIS TO GOVERNMENT OPS, IF THAT IS POSSIBLE. I THINK IT
DOES DESERVE MORE CONVERSATION OF CERTAINLY AT A TIME THAT THE
LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO VIEW AND HEAR THE
DISCUSSION. THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY I HAVE. I UNDERSTAND THE LEAD
SPONSOR, AT LEAST FROM HIS RESEARCH, BELIEVES WE ARE WITHIN THE
LEGAL RIGHT TO DO THAT. I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT WE ARE. I
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE GOING WITH THIS. I'M NOT THERE WITH YOU
JUST YET. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE GOTTEN ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO
SAY WE ARE WITHIN OUR ABILITY AS IT PERTAINS TO MGL, CHAPTER 43, TO
DO THAT. AND WHEN I READ CHAPTER 43, SECTION 104, POWERS AND
RIGHTS, IT DOESN'T SAY GO OUT AND HIRE AN ATTORNEY.
THAT'S WHERE I STRUGGLE. I YIELD THE FLOWER FOR THE LEAD SPONSOR TO
OPINE AND I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR CARLONE WANTED TO SPEAK TO THIS.


PAGE 62

April 26, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BEFORE WE GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE, THERE WAS
AN AMENDMENT PUT FORWARD EARLIER VIA EMAIL THAT WAS SENT. WE
WANT TO DISPOSE OF THAT. THE ONE THAT COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER JUST MENTIONED. AND WE CAN GET TO YOURS,
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. BEFORE WE DO ALL OF THAT, WE CAN GO TO
COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF ORDER. YOU CAN PUT YOUR
AMENDMENT -- YOURS AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER'S
AMENDMENT ON THE SCREEN. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE THE TECHNOLOGY VERY WELL THIS EVENING. MY APOLOGIES. I
WILL LOOK AT THE SOLICITOR'S RECOMMENDATION, WHICH I HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO OPEN.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: CAN I DO A DIRECT RESPONSE? I WILL
CLARIFY, I TRIED TO BE--CLEAR IN THE LANGUAGE, THE CITY SOLICITOR WILL
CONTINUE TO REPRESENT THE CITY COUNCIL IN COURT. THEY REPRESENT ALL
THE CITY DEPARTMENTS. ANYTIME SOMETHING GETS CHALLENGE OR IN
COURT, THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE REPRESENTATIVE. WHAT THIS
POLICY ORDER TALKS ABOUT IS LEGAL RESEARCH. WE DRAFT UP THE
LANGUAGE. I THINK ALL OF US HAVE DONE TO PUT FORWARD ORDINANCE.
WE ARE NOT LEGAL EXPERTS, EXCEPT FOR MAYOR SIDDIQUI WHO HAS A LAW
DEGREE. WE NEED ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S WHAT THE POLICY ORDER IS
ABOUT. AND I WOULD PREFER NOT TO SEND IT TO THE GOVERNMENT OPS
COMMITTEE SINCE NOT ALL OF ARE VOTING MEMBERS AND THE BUDGET IS
COMING UP. I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE OPERATION'S TIME AND
PUTTING AT THIS TIME THIS REQUEST. I'D RATHER VOTE TONIGHT. I WILL
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I TOTALLY AGREE WE NEED LEGAL
REPRESENTATION. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE
BEEN SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER FOR A WHILE AND HAVING SOME GOOD
DIALOGUE. THE REASON I WANTED TO RAISE THIS, I THOUGHT THAT WE
SHOULD AT LEAST DISCUSS -- IT IS LATE. AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS IN THE
MEMO. IT SHOWS A STRUCTURED ALTERNATIVE THAT MIGHT WORK FOR US
BEFORE ANY CHARTER CHANGE. THE CHARTER ISSUES RAISED IN THE MEMO,
I ASSUME ARE TRUE. I NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING -- BEEN IN THE CITY
WHEN THE SOLICITOR SAYS THIS IS WHAT IS IN THE LAW WHERE IT IS PROVED
TO BE WRONG. WE MAY INTERPRET THINGS DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT A
LAWYER. BY THE WAY, THE MAYOR IS VERY HAPPY TO DO LEGAL WRITE-UP
FOR ANY OF THE COUNCILLOR S.
I THINK THERE ARE PROPOSALS IN HERE THAT ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION. I WANT TO BRING IT UP, EVEN IF IT IS PRELIMINARY, I DON'T
NEGATE WHAT MY COUNCILLOR PROPOSED, I CO-SIGNED THAT. I WANTED
THE DISCUSSION TO BE A LITTLE LEVEL AND FOR US TO ASK QUESTIONS AND
THEN BRING IT UP AGAINST NEXT WEEK.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK, FOR THE RULES, WE ARE GETTING QUESTIONS.
THE EMAIL, THE LEGAL MEMO, WHERE IS IT? IT IS NOT PROVIDED TO THE
PUBLIC. THE PUBLIC CAN'T SEE IT?
>> NOT ON THE OPEN MEETING PORTAL RIGHT NOW. WE RECEIVED IT LATE.
WE CAN POST IT UP. AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE TOMORROW MORNING.
WHAT I CAN DO NOW, WE REGENERATE THE AGENDA. I CAN SHARE IT ON
THE SCREEN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE'S BEEN A REQUEST TO DISCUSS IT. AND AT THE
SAME TIME, JUST WE DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN BEFORE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WILL DEFER TO YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T WANT TO BE IN VIOLATION. SUSPEND THE
RULES TO BRING IT FORWARD. I WANT TO BE SURE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THIS IS IMPORTANT. JUST SEEING THIS. IT IS
9:40. WE STILL HAVE A HEFTY PART OF THE AGENDA BEFORE US. I DON'T
THINK -- I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE TO LAY IT ON THE TABLE. WE
HAVE A CHANCE TO READ THE LETTER. GO OVER IT AND VOTE IT UP OR
DOWN AT THE NEXT MEETING. IT WILL GIVE US TIME TO GO THROUGH THIS.
THE COUNCIL WANTS TO HASTILY VOTE THIS, I WILL DO WHAT IS THEIR
INCLINATION. I DON'T THINK IT IS MUCH TO ASK TO LAY IT ON THE TABLE
UNTIL NEXT MONDAY. GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ IT THROUGH. I
RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. I MADE
THE SAME CONSIDERATION WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THE CITY
MANAGER'S CONTRACT. PAST MIDNIGHT AND WE VOTED ON IT THAT NIGHT.
IT IS MUCH EARLIER NOW. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT THROUGH.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF INFORMATION. I DON'T SEE THEM AS
EQUAL. I THINK THAT STATEMENT WAS SLIGHTLY INFLAMMATORY, EVEN
THOUGH IT WAS NOT YOUR INTENTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE A SUGGESTION. THERE ARE SOME
AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE SLIGHTLY AND PUT IT IN THE
RIGHT ORDERED REQUEST LANGUAGE THAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE
FIRST PLACE. IT WAS MY -- I DIDN'T CATCH IT. AND I THINK BECAUSE THOSE
AMENDMENT S WERE SENT, THE CLERK HAS THEM, I SUGGEST WE GO
THROUGH THOSE BECAUSE COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER DID MENTION
THEM IN HIS REMARKS. AND THEN I THINK WE CAN GO FROM THERE.
THESE AMENDMENTS PUT IN THE PROPER LANGUAGE AS A REQUEST.
BEFORE THAT, THEY WERE NOT PUT IN THE PROPER FORMAT. I SUGGEST WE
DO THAT AT LEAST.
>> MR. CLERK: MAYOR SIDDIQUI? THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE CITY
SOLICITOR ON THE AGENDA, YOU CAN SUSPEND THE RULES TO DISCUSS IT
AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE, PLACE IT ON FILE
OR REFER TO COMMITTEE. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU DEAL WITH THE POLICY
ORDER.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US. CALL THE ROLL.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: REVISED ORDERED PARAGRAPHS THAT ESSENTIALLY
PUT IT IN THE PROPER LANGUAGE. SUBSTANCE IS THE SAME, BUT THE
ORIGINAL ORDER JUST HAD AS RESOLVED. BASICALLY IT SAID, DIDN'T HAVE
THE CITY MANAGER IS BEING AND HEREBY REQUESTED. THIS IS THE PROPER
FORMAT THAT ALL ORDERS ARE IN. I WANTED TO PUT THEM IN THE PROPER
FORMAT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO FURTHER DISCUSSION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: ONE MORE QUESTION. IT SAYS, IN THE LAST
ORDER, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, IT SHOULDN'T BE LESS THAN 5% OF THE TOTAL
AMOUNT OF THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT BUDGET. SO I'M SURE, IS THIS -- I
DON'T WANT TO MISUNDERSTAND. IS THIS 5% OF THE BUDGET OF THE
LEGAL DEPARTMENT BUDGET THAT IS BEING REALLOCATED. OR NEW
MONEY.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: NEW MONEY. NOT A REDUCTION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: NOT A CLARIFYING QUESTION. I'M READY TO
VOTE.

Motion to amend Calendar
item #1

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION TO AMEND THE CALENDAR ITEM ONE:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: SORRY. YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE A FEW FOLKS WHO HAVE THEIR
HANDS UP.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I SEE THE SOLICITOR'S MEMO CAME
THROUGH AT NOON TODAY AND I HAVE BEEN IN BACK-TO-BACK MEETINGS
UNTIL WE GOT TO THE MEETING. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO DIGEST IT.
MY QUESTION IS, IT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO GET A RESPONSE BACK FROM A CITY


PAGE 65

April 26, 2021

DEPARTMENT HEAD PRIOR TO US VOTING ON A POLICY ORDER. IF WE VOTE
THIS TONIGHT, SOLICITOR GLOWA'S MEMO CAN APPEAR ON THE AGENDA
MONDAY. I ASSUME IT WILL BE THE SAME MEMO AS A RESPONSE. IS THAT
ACCURATE?
>> MR. CLERK: THE MEMO IS GOING TO APPEAR ON THE RECORD OF THE
MEETING AS A LATE COMMUNICATION. UNLESS THE COUNCIL DOES
SOMETHING TO FORWARD IT TO THE NEXT MEETING.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT'S MY QUESTION. WE CAN HAVE IT AS A LATE
COMMUNICATION ON TONIGHT, OR COME ON MONDAY NIGHT'S AGENDA AS
A RESPONSE TO THE POLICY ORDER SHOULD WE PASS IT TONIGHT. WE CAN
HAVE AN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION AT THE TIME?
>> MR. CLERK: CURRENTLY IT IS BEFORE THE BODY. THE BODY HAS TO DO
SOMETHING WITH IT. I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO
SAY. I IMAGINE THE ASSUMPTION IS THE POLICY ORDER IS PASSED, THE CITY
SOLICITOR SUBMIT AN ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION FOR NEXT MEETING,
THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FUTURE COMMUNICATION.
>> CITY MANAGER: I CAN JUMP IN FOR A SECOND, IF THAT IS OKAY. THEN I
WILL LET NANCY. WE DID THIS -- IT IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION, THE CITY
SOLICITOR, IF YOU VOTE POSITIVELY, YOU BREAK THE CHARTER. I FELT THAT
BEFORE YOU VOTED, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT. WE CAN AGREE OR
DISAGREE. WHETHER SHE IS RIGHT OR WRONG. TO ME, THIS IS A CONCERN
THAT IF -- I BELIEVE SHE IS CORRECT, I NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE
COUNCIL TO SAY, OUR BELIEF THIS BREAKS THE CHARTER AND IF YOU CHOOSE
TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, THAT'S FINE. I DO NOT WANT IN GOOD
CONSCIOUS TO HAVE YOU VOTE WITHOUT US RECOGNIZING CITY SOLICITOR'S
OPINION. YOU CAN TAKE THAT, WHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE, THAT'S
UP TO YOU. THAT'S WHY I JUMPED IN AND SAID I REALLY BELIEVE BASED ON
THE LETTER HOW STRONG IT IS AND INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE COUNCIL
VOTE ON SOMETHING AND NOT MAKE THEM AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE
SAYING. I'M SORRY IF THAT CAUSED CONFUSION. WE ARE TRYING TO BE
HONEST AND PROTECTED THE COUNCIL FOR WHAT THE CITY SOLICITOR WAS
SAYING AND VOTING ON. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONFUSION. THAT'S WHY
WE DID SOMETHING UNUSUAL BY GETTING IT TO YOU SO QUICKLY THIS
AFTERNOON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I THINK WHEN I SAW THE POLICY
ORDER AS WRITTEN, PRIOR TO AMENDMENT, I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE VIOLATING THE CHARTER AS WELL. I'M LESS
CONCERNED NOW BECAUSE WE AMENDED IT TO NOT BE RESOLVE THAT THE
CITY COUNCIL GETS A BUDGET FOR THE LAW DEPARTMENT. NOW, BACK TO
THE TYPICAL WITHIN THE PLANNING CHARTER, ORDER WE ASK THE CITY
MANAGER TO CONSIDER IT. FOR ME, I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE
COMING FROM AND THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING IT AND WHY IT IS A SPECIAL
SITUATION. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE MAYBE -- MOVED PASS THAT WITH THIS
AMENDMENT. I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT READING THROUGH THE MEMO, IT HAS
BEEN A CRAZY DAY AS MONDAYS ARE. I'D BE FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH IT
AND THEN HAVING AN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION ON MONDAY NIGHT

PAGE 66

April 26, 2021

WHEN YOU SUBMIT A REPORT AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT AT THE TIME.
THANK YOU, MR. MANAGER, FOR THE EXPLANATION. I YIELD.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THANK YOU. I WANT TO ECHO WHAT THE CITY MANAGER
SAID WITH RESPECT TO THIS BEING A HIGHLY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE. I
AGREE WITH VICE MAYOR MALLON IT IS UNUSUAL TO BE RESPONDING TO AN
ORDER BEFORE IT IS PASSED. MY HOPE AND TALKING IT THROUGH WITH THE
CITY MANAGER, TO KEEP THERE FROM BEING A VOTE TO BE ASKING THE CITY
MANAGER TO BE DOING SOMETHING THAT VIOLATES THE CHARTER. AND
BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER, THERE ARE SANCTIONS FOR
VIOLATIONS OF THE CHARTER WITH RESPECT TO TRYING TO DIRECT OR
REQUEST THE APPOINTMENT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF
THE CITY MANAGER THAT -- UNDER THE CHARTER, INCLUDES THE POTENTIAL
FOR JAIL OR FINES. THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND I APPRECIATE THE
CONSIDERATION OF THE COUNCIL PUTTING THIS MATTER ON THE TABLE TO
GIVE THE COUNCIL THE OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST READ THE LEGAL OPINION
THAT I PROVIDED, WHICH INCLUDES CASE LAW FROM MASSACHUSETTS
COURTS, INCLUDING A CASE DIRECTLY ON POINT INVOLVING THE BOSTON
CITY COUNCIL WHERE THERE WAS LITIGATION BETWEEN THE PRIOR MAYOR
AND THE BOSTON CITY COUNCIL, WHERE THE COURT SAID THIS IS A
VIOLATION OF THE CHARTER AND NOT PERMISSIBLE. THE CITY COUNCIL IS
NOT ENTITLED TO SEPARATE LEGAL COUNCIL. THE CITY COUNCIL IS THE
LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE MUNICIPAL ENTITY. NOT A SEPARATE ENTITY. AND
IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE CONSISTENCY IN THE LEGAL ADVICE THAT IS GIVEN
TO THE CITY COUNCIL AS IT IS TO ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY AS A LEGAL
ENTITY.
AGAIN, I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THE COUNCIL HAD
IN FRONT OF YOU ALL VERY EARLY IN THE DAY AND YOU ARE ALL BUSY AND I
APPRECIATE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE HAD TIME TO LOOK AT IT YET, I
WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOU LEAVING THIS MATTER ON THE TABLE
UNTIL NEXT WEEK SO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE LEGAL
OPINION THAT I PROVIDED AND TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SERIOUS CHARTER
VIOLATION THAT YOU ARE REQUESTING. TO TAKE ACTION ONLY AFTER YOU
HAVE A CHANCE TO DO SO. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF ORDER. IF THE SOLICITOR, WHO IS
CHARGED TO US BY THE CITY MANAGER HAS ASKED US NOT TO, I WOULD
THEN -- WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE, PUT A FORMAL ORDER ON THE FLOOR TO
LAY THIS ON THE TABLE. I WILL RESERVE, BUT FOR POINT OF ORDER, I THINK
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO RUSH INTO. I ASK THAT MY I COME TO THE
FLOOR AT THE APPROPRIATE TO LAY IT ON THE TABLE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS
FROM THE MANAGER AND THE SOLICITOR. I APPRECIATE THE MEMO. I DID
HAVE A CHANCE TO READ IT. I WOULD LIKE TO GET CLARIFICATION FROM
THE SOLICITOR WHETHER SHE BELIEVES THAT WITH THE AMENDMENT WE
HAVE AT LEAST RESOLVED THE CHARTER VIOLATION. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S
A CONCERN ABOUT HAVING LEGAL COUNSEL. THE WAY IT WAS AMENDED, IT
STILL PUTS ALL THE ACTIONS IN THE HANDS OF THE MANAGER. ASKING THE

PAGE 67

April 26, 2021

MANAGER TO ADD A ITEM LINE TO THE CITY BUDGET. AND IT ASKS FOR THE
COUNCIL TO HAVE CONTROL OVER DIRECTING THE PERSON WHO WOULD BE
PAID UNDER THAT LINE ITEM, WHICH IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO THE
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT TO THE COUNCIL. I'D LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION
ON DOES HE GO TO JAIL IF WE VOTE TONIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING FORWARD THE
LATE COMMUNICATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON SUSPENDING THE RULES TO BRING FORWARD THE LATE
COMMUNICATION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

Suspension of the rules to bring
forward a late communication.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE A QUESTION AROUND THE NEW LANGUAGE,
AMENDMENT LANGUAGE. SOLICITOR? THE MEMO ITSELF AND WHETHER OR
NOT YOU HEARD COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S QUESTION.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT QUESTION
WAS DIRECTED AT ME. I DO NOT HAVE THE AMENDMENT IN FRONT OF ME. I
WAS NOT ABLE TO OBSERVE IT ON THE SCREEN. I HAVE ASKED THE CLERK TO
EMAIL ME THE LANGUAGE SO I CAN SEE IT. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK WILSON IS DOING THAT OR HAS DONE THAT.
>> MR. CLERK: I'M DOING IT NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WILL ADD I DID REVIEW THE LETTER SHE
SENT. I THINK IT IS QUITE A REASONABLE PROPOSAL. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO
DISCUSS IT FURTHER TONIGHT OR NEXT WEEK. I DON'T THINK IT IS
NECESSARILY IN CONFLICT WITH THE POLICY ORDER. WHAT THE ORDER IS
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS GIVE ACCESS TO LEGAL ADVICE AS WE ARE
DRAFTING OR EVEN CONTEMPLATING POTENTIAL ORDINANCE LANGUAGE.
I'M NOT SURE THE LAW DEPARTMENT WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE
THAT TO US IN THE WAY THAT I THINK THIS ORDER IS TRYING TO GET AT.
CERTAINLY, COUNCILLORS IN THE PAST HAVE SOUGHT LEGAL ADVICE. I
PRESUME THAT IS NOT ILLEGAL. I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY ASKING FOR IS
A MORE FORMAL VERSION OF THAT AND THE OPTION TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE
ATTORNEY WE CONSULT. I'M REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF
WHEN WE ARE CONTEMPLATING NEW LANGUAGE AND SEEKING LEGAL
ADVICE REGARDING THAT PRIOR TO PROPOSING IT AND PUTTING IT
FORWARD. I THINK AT THAT POINT THE SUGGESTION FROM THE SOLICITOR
IS...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOLICITOR?
>> CITY SOLICITOR: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE OF POINTS. I'M
SEEING THIS ORDER NOW. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PROPOSED ORDER IS -WE HAVE OVER 100 YEARS OR CLOSE TO 200 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
PRACTICING MUNICIPAL LAW IN THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE. WE TAKE OUR
PROFESSIONALISM SERIOUSLY AND WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE
REPRESENT THE CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE REPRESENT THE CITY COUNCIL.
THAT'S OUR ETHICAL OBLIGATION. WE REPRESENT ALL DIFFERENT
COMPONENT PARTS OF THE MUNICIPALITY. WHEN WE PROVIDE LEGAL
ADVICE TO THE COUNCIL, IT IS 100% WITH RESPECT TO PROVIDING THE


PAGE 68

April 26, 2021

ADVICE THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND BASED UPON THE LAW. THE FACT THERE
MAY BE SOME OTHER LAWYERS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT CHOOSE TO
SUPPORT AN ADVOCACY POSITION OF A COUNCILLOR OR MORE THAN ONE, IT
IS NOT REALLY RELEVANT TO GETTING THE BEST ADVICE FOR THE MUNICIPAL
CORPORATION. I CAN THINK OF AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE WHERE ONE OF THE
LAWYERS THAT -- A COUNCILLOR USED IN SUPPORT OF AN ARGUMENT THAT
IS BEFORE THE COUNCIL CITED TO AUTHORITY THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE
AND MISPLACED AND WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE
GOVERNMENT IN CAMBRIDGE UNDER THE PLANNING CHARTER.
THERE ARE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE JUST BRINGING IN OTHER
LAWYERS WILLIE NITTY AND HAVING THEM VOLUNTEER SERVICES WHEN
THEY DON'T REPRESENT CAMBRIDGE AND DON'T HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO
BE REPRESENTING THE CITY AND RESEARCHING THE LAW CAREFULLY AS WE
DO. WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUEST THAT THIS LINE ITEM BE GIVEN FOR
LEGAL RESEARCH, AS I JUST GAVE THAT ONE BRIEF EXAMPLE, AS MY LEGAL
OPINION INDICATES, THE COURT, THE MASSACHUSETTS APPEALS COURT,
LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY IN THE BOSTON CITY COUNCIL CASE AT THE
QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE DUAL LAWYERS
REPRESENTING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MUNICIPAL. IT IS NOT
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE DUAL LAWYERS. IT IS NOT THE SEPARATE ENTITY.
AND RESPECTFULLY, EACH OF YOU CAN GO RETAIN YOUR OWN COUNSEL TO
CONFER WITH PRIVATELY, BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS YOU BRING
TO THE BODY, THE BODY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ADVISED UNDER OUR CHARTER
BY THE CITY SOLICITOR. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. VERY FUNDAMENTAL
PART OF THE CHARTER.
IF THE COUNCIL WISHES TO ENGAGE IN THE CHARTER REVIEW, IT IS THINKING
ABOUT ENGAGING IN AND THE CHARTER CHANGES, THAT'S FINE. IN THE
MEANTIME, THIS IS THE CHARTER. IT SAYS, THE CITY SOLICITOR, LIKE OTHER
DEPARTMENT HEADS, IS APPOINTED BY THE CITY MANAGER AND IT IS WRONG
AND IMPROPER INTERFERENCE FOR THE COUNCIL TO TRY TO DICTATE HOW
THE APPOINTMENTS IS MADE AND BUSINESS IS PROVIDED TO THE COUNCIL. I
ASK YOU TO READ MY OPINION CAREFULLY AND DEFER FURTHER
CONVERSATION UNLESS YOU WISH TO SIMPLY STRIKE DOWN THE ORDER.
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, I APPRECIATE THE POINT YOU MADE, BUT
RESPECTFULLY YOU ARE MISTAKEN IN THINKING THAT SIMPLY GETTING LEGAL
RESEARCH IS SOMEHOW INNOCUOUS. IT IS NOT. AS YOU HAVE KNOWN IN
LIFE, IN GENERAL, LOOK AROUND AT EVERY CASE THAT GOES TO COURT, YOU
READ THE NEWSPAPERS, THERE'S ALWAYS LAWYERS THAT WILL REPRESENT.
WE HAVE TO REPRESENT CAMBRIDGE AND THE ONLY JOB. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR
WHAT THE OTHER LAWYERS HAVE IN MIND OR RESEARCH THEY DO, WHEN
WE HIRE OUTSIDE COUPLE, THE LAWYERS REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE CITY
SOLICITOR AND WE MAKE SURE WE ARE CONFIDENT IN THE ADVICE THEY
GIVE BEFORE WE GIVE IT TO THE CITY.
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE HELPING TO BE HIRING OUTSIDE COUNSEL WHEN WE
HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN-HOUSE, INCLUDING SOME OF THE TOP LAWYERS
FROM SOME OF THE LAW FIRMS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE BEEN


PAGE 69

April 26, 2021

FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO STEAL AWAY HERE IN THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE. I
DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY. AGAIN, I THINK YOU SHOULD AVAIL
YOURSELF OF LOOKING AT THE CHARTER AND READ THE LEGAL OPINION AND
I RESPECTFULLY THINK THIS AMENDMENT WILL CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF
THE CHARTER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE
FROM THE SOLICITOR. I'M STILL CONFUSED. THE AMENDMENT WOULD STILL
RUN EVERYTHING THROUGH THE CITY MANAGER. WE'RE NOT STAYING THE
COUNSEL WILL GO AND HIRE SOMEONE. WE ARE ASKING THE CITY MANAGER
TO DO THAT FOR US. THAT SEEMS TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU ARE
PROPOSING. AND IT COULD BE FALSE THROUGH THAT MECHANISM. THE
ONLY PART STILL NOT CLEAR TO ME IS WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE
LEGISLATION, IT IS NOT VOTED ON YET, HOW DO WE OBTAIN LEGAL ADVICE.
IF WE ARE DOING IT THE WAY WE CURRENTLY GET LEGAL OPINIONS FROM
YOURSELF OR FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT, WE'D HAVE TO VOTE ON MOTION
TO GOT LEGAL OPINION ON LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE STILL
CONTEMPLATING. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW THAT WORKS.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: IF I MAY RESPOND. I WILL POINT OUT, IN THE ORDER
THAT YOU SENT, YOU MENTION THAT THIS WORK WOULD BE DONE WITH
RESPECT TO ORDERS THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO THE COUNCIL IN PUBLIC
AND VOTED UPON IN PUBLIC. AS YOU KNOW, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, IT
TAKES FOUR OR FIVE DAYS TO GET AN ORDER FROM START TO FINISH TO BE
SUBMITTED AND PUT IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL. IT CAN THEN BE VOTED
UPON. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL THAT I HAVE MADE AND PUT A GREAT
DEAL OF THOUGHT INTO HOW TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THE COUNCIL IS
EXPRESSING THROUGH THIS ORDER, TRY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MEET THE
NEEDS THAT ARE HERE, ONCE AN ORDER IS PASSED, I HAVE INDICATED WE'D
ASSIGN AN ATTORNEY TO BE WORKING ON IT. THERE WOULD BE ONE MAIN
POINT OF CONTACT FOR COUNCILLORS TO CONTACT IN THE LAW
DEPARTMENT WITH QUESTIONS. AND WE'D RESPOND TO ALL CITY COUNCIL
ORDERS IN A MORE EXPEDITED WAY WITH INCREASE IN LAW DEPARTMENT
STAFF THAN WHAT WE HAD. WE HAVE HAD VACANCIES RECENTLY. IT IS A
VERY DIFFICULT YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE HAD TO CONTEND WITH.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE COUNCIL UNDERSTANDS THAT I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FRUSTRATION. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO HAVE MORE
LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING.
THE CITY MANAGER DOESN'T HIRE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. I HIRE OUTSIDE
COUNSEL. I SUPERVISE COUNSEL. THEY REPORT TO ME. THAT IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT IS DONE BY THE CITY MANAGER. UNDERSTAND THE
MUNICIPAL CODE, I AM THE PERSON WHO IS APPOINTED TO PROVIDE LEGAL
ADVICE TO THE CITY AND TO SUPERVISE THE LAWYERS IN THE LAW
DEPARTMENT. OR OUTSIDE COUNSEL. THE CONCEPT THAT YOU WOULD BE
HIRING SOMEONE WITHOUT HAVING ANY DIRECTION GIVEN BY THE CITY
SOLICITOR'S OFFICE IS INAPPROPRIATE UNDERSTAND THE CHARTER.
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I HOPE THE COUNCILLORS WILL READ THE


PAGE 70

April 26, 2021

PROPOSAL I PUT FORTH IN THE MEMORANDUM. I THINK IT IS -- WE PUT A
LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WISHES
HERE AND WOULD LIKE TO MEET THE WISHES, BUT DON'T FEEL IT IS LEGAL OR
APPROPRIATE TO DO SO IN THE WAY THAT THE COUNCIL IS REQUESTING. WE
DO FEEL WE PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE
SERVICES APPROPRIATELY.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE. IT
WASN'T MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BY ASKING THE CITY MANAGER WE
BYPASS THE SOLICITOR. AGAIN, NORMALLY THAT'S HOW WE MADE THE
REQUEST TO THE CITY MANAGER. IF HE FEELS IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DIRECT
THAT TO THE SOLICITOR OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT, HE'D DO THAT. I'M
SATISFIED FOR NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. SO, I WILL BACK THIS UP. I'M NOT
SURE -- I HEARD DIFFERENT THINGS FROM COUNCILLORS IN TERMS OF THE
PURPOSE. I HEARD THE COUNCIL NEEDS THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION. AND I
HEARD THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE -- IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT PUTTING
IN AN ORDINANCE OR POLICY, WE HAVE SOMEONE -- A LAWYER OUTSIDE OF
THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE TO ASK FOR HELP. THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS. I WANT SOMEONE CLARITY -- MY FIRST QUESTION IS TO
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER, CAN YOU CLARIFY. ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT WE'D HAVE... I WANT TO DO A POLICY ORDER ON WHATEVER, I
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG AT THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE OR
IT WAS TAKING TOO LONG, I CAN GET IT BEFORE THAT. I CAN GET AN
ATTORNEY TO HELP ME DRAFT IT. OR THE CITY SOLICITOR'S OFFICE COMES
BACK WITH AN OPINION THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH OR DON'T LIKE, I WANT
TO GET A SECOND OPINION FROM ANOTHER LAWYER. THOSE ARE
DIFFERENT.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THE FORMER, THE COUNCIL CAN HIRE
OUTSIDE LEGAL RESEARCH TO HELP WITH DRAFTING AN ORDINANCE. THE
CITY SOLICITOR AND THE LAW DEPARTMENT CONTINUE TO REPRESENT THE
COUNCIL IN COURT AND IN TERMS OF REPRESENTING THE COUNCIL IN
COURT. THIS IS CLEAR FROM THE RESEARCH.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THAT MAKES ME ON THE SIDE TO NOT DO THIS
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. WHAT WE'RE SAYING, IT TAKES TOO LONG TO GET
THINGS BACK FROM THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE. THEY ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE.
WE CAN'T GO TO THEM FOR QUESTIONS. MAYBE WE NEED TO HIRE MORE
PEOPLE IN THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE OR FIGURE OUT SO THAT IS WANT A
PROBLEM. WE HAD ISSUES WHERE WE GOT INFORMATION BACK FROM THE
SOLICITOR'S OFFICE AND WE -- WE ARE NOT LAWYERS. COUNCILLORS FEEL
LIKE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I HEAR FROM OTHER ATTORNEYS THIS IS
LEGAL. WE SOMETIMES WANT A SECOND OPINION. WHERE DO WE GET
THAT FROM.
MY OTHER QUESTION IS, HOW I PEEL THE ONION HERE. HOW DO WE DECIDE,
IF IT PASSES, HOW DO WE DECIDE WHICH ATTORNEYS TO ASK. I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING, I BRING FORWARD -- I WANT TO HIRE SMITH AND SMITH TO DO
THIS WORK FOR ME. DO THIS WORK AND HELP ME WITH THIS. THE COUNCIL

PAGE 71

April 26, 2021

APPROVES IT. THEY COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT SOME
CONSTITUENCIES DON'T LIKE. I CAN HEAR IT NOW. COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
HIRED A FRIEND OF HIS FROM HIGH SCHOOL, WHO GOT THE OPINION HE
WANTED. THIS IS CORRUPTION. WE'LL GO DOWN THAT ROAD. IF WE DO
THIS, IT IS ONE THING TO HAVE A LAW FIRM THAT IS ON RETAINER THAT
WHERE EVERYBODY USES THE SAME PERSON. I THINK IF YOU WILL BRING IN
YOUR GUY AND I BRING IN MY PERSON, IT WILL OPEN UP A CAN OF WORMS
AROUND TRANSPARENCY. YOU GET SOMEONE WHO WILL TELL YOU THE
ANSWER YOU WANT TO HEAR. I THINK IT IS A MESS.
I HIRE MY PERSON WHO SAYS HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO AND HERE'S
WHAT THE LANGUAGE IS. THE SOLICITOR COMES BACK AND DISAGREES.
COUNCIL VOTES WITH ME. DOES THE CITY SOLICITOR ON BEHALF OF THE CITY
THEN SUE THE COUNCIL'S LAWYER THAT WE HIRED BECAUSE THE SOLICITOR
THINKS IT IS A VIOLATION. I GET WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I THINK
THERE'S MERIT. I THINK IT IS MORE COMPLICATED. I DON'T WANT TO SET
SOMETHING UP -- NOT AFRAID OF GOING TO JAIL. AT LEAST NOT FOR THIS. I
SUGGEST DO WE NEED AN OPINION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.
DO WE NEED... I FEEL LIKE IT NEEDS MORE DISCUSSION THAN WE CAN DO
RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I NEED HELP. IF I WANT TO CALL A LAWYER AND ASK
THEM... NEXT TO CONSULTANTS, WE PROBABLY HAVE MORE LAWYERS IN
CAMBRIDGE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IF I NEED HELP, WE ALL HAVE DONE IT, IF
WE NEED HELP WITH LANGUAGE OR GETTING LEGAL ADVICE, WE CAN ALL
FIND IT. WE'LL FIND A LAWYER THAT IS WILLING TO HELP US. I DON'T THINK
IT IS AN OBSTACLE TO ANY OF US. WE DO IT ALL THE TIME. THERE ARE TIMES
WHERE WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH WHAT IS COMING OUT OF THE
SOLICITOR'S OFFICE AND WANT A SECOND OPINION. THAT'S A DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION. LAST THING, IN TERMS OF TONIGHT, WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT
TRANSPARENCY ONLY WHEN IT IS CONVENIENT. WE HAVE A DOCUMENT
FROM THE CITY SOLICITOR'S OFFICE. THE PUBLIC HAS NOT SEEN IT. IF THAT
WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE WERE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF PEOPLE WOULD
SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS NOT TRANSPARENT. WE ARE BETTER
OFF PUTTING THIS OFF A WEEK. GET QUESTIONS ANSWERS. LET THE PUBLIC
SEE WHAT THE SOLICITOR WROTE. GO FROM THERE. THIS IS MORE
COMPLICATED. MORE COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I
DON'T WANT US TO DO SOMETHING -- NOT AFRAID OF GOING TO JAIL, BUT
DON'T DO SOMETHING THAT BITES US IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HOLD ON. IT IS 10:09. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER TO RESPOND. CLERK WILSON HAS SAID THERE IS A
PENDING MOTION. WE HAVE TO GO TO THAT. I WILL RECOGNIZE
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER'S HAND. I DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE I
HEARD.
>> CITY MANAGER: IT WAS MINE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO THE CITY MANAGER AFTER.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: I WANT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS


PAGE 72

April 26, 2021

FROM COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN ON A WHOLE YET, BUT
SOME THINGS I MENTION WERE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. THE ONE,
THE POINT OF THE POLICY ORDER IS TO AVOID THE ISSUE OF EACH
COUNCILLOR GOING AND FINDING THEIR OWN LAWYER. IT IS A POINT THE
SOLICITOR BROUGHT UP AS WELL. THIS IS TO AVOID THAT. SET UP A
PROCESS IN WHICH THE COUNCIL VOTES IN PUBLIC, MAJORITY VOTE, TO HIRE
AN OUTSIDE LAWYER. IF WE WANT ONE FIRM REPRESENTING IT INSTEAD OF
12 FIRMS AND EVERYBODY HAS A FRIEND. WE CAN SET IT UP. MAYBE IT
MORE TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC. WE HAVE ALL DONE THAT. WE WORKED
ON THE BIKE ORDINANCE. WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE KNEW SOMEONE WHO
WAS A LAWYER AND NEW BIKE LAW. NOT EVERYBODY DOES THAT AS A PRO
BONO LAWYER. SOMEONE WILLING TO PUT IT TOGETHER. PUT RESOURCES
TO MAKE IT PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT TO AVOID THAT. IT IS NOT JUST THE
TIME ISSUE WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT. TIMES WE'D LOOK SOMETHING
DONE FASTER AND TIMES WHERE THE OPINION -- THE CONFLICT OF THE LAW
DEPARTMENT REPRESENTING BOTH THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE EXECUTIVE
AUTHORITY. THAT'S THE REASON WHY OTHER STAYS HAVE DONE THIS. THEY
CITED THAT ISSUE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND THE
EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. YOU SEE IT IN BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. NOT
THE SAME LAWYERS THAT REPRESENT THAT THE GOVERNOR, ET CETERA.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN FOLKS. THAT'S THE OTHER BIG PART OF THIS.
THE TIME ISSUE. IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY ON THE MEMO, WE GOT IT
THIS AFTERNOON. I SUBMITTED THIS POLICY ORDER MORE THAN TWO
WEEKS AGO. WE COULD HAVE GOT THE RESPONSE SOONER AND WE COULD
HAVE IT ON THE MEETING PORTAL. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE USED AS A
REASON TO DELAY THIS. I TRIED MY BEST TO PUT THIS FORWARD AHEAD OF
TIME AND WE SHOULD MOVE TONIGHT. I WILL PUT FORWARD THE MOTION
TO CALL THE QUESTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL GO TO CITY MANAGER AND THEN COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER, I THINK THERE WAS A -- CLERK, YOU CAN CLARIFY.
THERE'S A MOTION BEFORE COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER'S WE HAVE TO
GET TO. THAT'S THE ORDER OF THE BUSINESS.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY THAT THE REASON IT CAME
SO LATE IS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY YOU ARE BREAKING THE
CHARTER. I WANT TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WE FELT
ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS. THAT WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION AND NOT AN
EASY PROCESS. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NANCY FOR TWO WEEKS TO
COME UP WITH THIS EXPLANATION OF SAYING, WHY YOU ARE BREAKING THE
CHARTER, WHICH IS IMPORTANT. NOT TO SAY, TOO BAD, WE'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING. I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNCILLOR CARLONE ABOUT THE
FACT THAT HOW DO WE GET THINGS MOVING QUICKER. I HAVE
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MAYOR. AND TALK TO THE CITY SOLICITOR
ABOUT HOW TO GIVE THE COUNCIL MORE ACCESS, FREEDOM AND TURN IT
AROUND QUICKER. THAT'S WHAT THIS LETTER IS MEANT TO BE. NOT TO BE
CONFRONTATIONAL, BUT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM I THINK WE CAN SOLVE IF
IS TRULY ABOUT GETTING ORDERS DONE QUICKLY, GETTING THE CONTACT


PAGE 73

April 26, 2021

PERSON AND BEING HEARD BETTER. WE TOOK TIME WITH THE CITY
SOLICITOR HOW THAT CAN WORK. I'M SORRY IT TWO WEEKS, IT WOULD BE
EASY TO SAY YOU BREAK THE CHARTER. I TRY TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL.
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO BE HONEST, I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT IS THE SAME
WAY BACK. THAT IS ON ME, NOT YOU. THIS ONE HERE, THE INTENT IS NOT
TO CAUSE A PROBLEM, BUT COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT I THOUGHT
COULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE COUNCIL. IF IT DIDN'T DO THAT,
SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'LL MAKE IT CLEAR, THE GOAL IS TO HELP IT MOVE
FORWARD AND NOT TO HAVE IT GO FORWARD.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IN MY EARLIER TIME I HELD THE FLOOR, I SAID -I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW, MY POINT OF ORDER, THE MOTION HE IS ASKING US
TO VOTE ON, IT EITHER GO TO GOVERNMENT OPS OR LAID ON THE TABLE. I
WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON. IF IT IS NEITHER, I FEEL
COMPELLED TO DEFEND MY POSITION. I WILL YIELD, BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF
THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE US.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK, BACK TO YOU. MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON
THE COMMUNICATION, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, WHEN SHE HAD THE FLOOR,
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE A MOTION TO EITHER REFER THIS
TO THE GOVERNMENT OPS OR LAY IT ON THE TABLE. IT WASN'T SPECIFIED.
>> MR. CLERK: I SHARE THE CONFUSION. I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
AT THE TIME SHE MOVED A MOTION -- FIRST TIME SHE SPOKE, SHE WOULD
REFER TO THE GOVERNMENT OPS COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE BEFORE SHE
YIELDED, SHE MAY HAVE SAID, SHE WAS PLACING -- MOTION TO PLACE THE
ITEM ON THE TABLE. IN EITHER EVENT, COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER'S
MOTION TO CALL THE QUESTION TECHNICALLY WOULD -- A VOTE ON
WHETHER OR NOT THE QUESTION IS CALLED. AND THEN THE QUESTION BE
CALLED IS ON COUNCILLOR SIMMONS MOTION TO REFER THIS TO THE
COMMITTEE OR TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE. COUNCILLOR SIMMONS WOULD
HAVE TO CLARIFY WHICH MOTION SHE PUT FORWARD. AND COUNCIL WILL
VOTE. EXCUSE ME, CALL THE QUESTION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: A POINT OF ORDER, I ASK WE LAY IT ON THE
TABLE IN ORDER TO FULLY READ THIS THROUGH. AND DISCUSS IT AT
MONDAY'S MEETING. IF IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, CERTAINLY
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO IT THE RIGHT THING. HAVING ONE MORE WEEK IS
NOT GOING TO BE A HUGE INCONVENIENCE AND WE'LL BE BETTER
INFORMED. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THAT IDEA. ALLOW US
TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THE VERY IMPORTANT ITEM BEFORE
US. SOME OF US HAVE NOT SEEN UNTIL TONIGHT. I PERSONALLY DIDN'T GET
TO READ UNTIL A MOMENT BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL FAILURES. MOTION IS
TO LAY ON THE TABLE. TAKE IT UP NEXT WEEK.
>> MR. CLERK: I WANT TO CLARIFY, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. ONE IS THE
POLICY ORDER AND THE COMMUNICATION. I ASSUME YOUR MOTION IS TO
PLACE BOTH ITEMS ON THE TABLE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THAT'S MY MOTION. PLACE BOTH ON THE
TABLE.

TO ACT ON. I KNOW THERE IS A QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WAS ON
THE TABLE. I THINK THE CITY SOLICITOR WILL -- THERE WILL BE RESPONSES
SOON ON THAT. BASED ON THE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE CITY
SOLICITOR. WE WILL MOVE TO APPLICATIONS AND PETITIONS. PLEASURE OF
THE CITY COUNCIL? ON ADOPTION, IF THERE IS NO QUESTIONS ON THE

AND COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PAST
LEADERSHIP IN THE ISSUES. AND ALSO FOR SPONSORING THIS POLICY ORDER.
AS THE ORDER MAKES CLEAR, THIS IS ABOUT PERTAINING TO THE, I BELIEVE,
MORE THAN 100 MILLION THE CITY CONTROLS. THIS IS ABOUT WE ESTABLISH
A POLICY OF NOT HAVING OUR FUNDS INVESTED IN FOSSIL FUEL FUNDERS OR
IN PRIVATE PRISONS. THIS COUNCIL OR THE CITY HAS OFTEN TRIED TO GET
THE RULES -- THESE RULES AND POLICIES ADOPTED FOR PENSION FUNDS, BUT
DUE TO STATE LAW AND WE ARE NOT APPARENTLY ABLE TO DO THAT. WE
WAIT LEGISLATION. THE CITY FUNDS ARE IN A POSITION THAT WE WOULD BE
ABLE TO. THERE ARE FEWER RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT WE CAN DO. I HAVE
MET WITH THE CITY AUDITOR AND TALKED THROUGH SOME OF THE
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD ABOUT HOW IT IS WE MAY GO ABOUT THIS. I THINK
AS IT STATES IN THE POLICY ORDER, THERE'S A NUMBER OF AREAS THE STATE
DOES ALLOW FOR THE THEM TO INVEST IN AND ONES -- WE COULD INVEST IN
THEM, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A POLICY WE WOULDN'T. THE COUPLE
THAT STRUCK ME, ON A LIST OF APPROVED INVESTMENTS FROM

MUNICIPALITIES FROM THE STATE INCLUDES A TOBACCO COMPANY,
KENTUCKY UTILITIES COMPANY WHOSE ENERGY PRODUCE USED 80-90%
COAL. BANK OF AMERICA, IT DOES HAVE POLICIES, DECIDE THEY WILL
DECLINE FUTURE INVESTMENT IN PRIVATE PRISONS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST
FOSSIL FUEL PORTFOLIOS IN THE COUNTRY. AND PROBABLY THE WORLD.
THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE. I
WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT WE TEND TO NOT HAVE OUR FUNDS IN
INVESTED IN THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS OR ENTITIES RIGHT NOW. WE
DON'T HAVE A POLICY THAT FORBIDS IT. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE
STAND UP AND ESTABLISH WHAT IT IS THAT WE WILL DO AND WON'T DO
WITH THE MONEY. WHAT THIS POLICY ORDER DOES, WE ASK THAT THE CITY
MANAGER LOOK AT THE BUDGET BOOK INVESTMENT POLICY, WHICH IS
WHERE WE SET THE INVESTMENT POLICY. AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THE CITY
STAFF, WE HAD AMENDED THE ORIGINAL VERSION TO INCLUDE A SIX-MONTH
TIMELINE OF IMPLEMENTATION. AND ON FURTHER DISCUSSION, I WOULD
LIKE TO PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT, YOU HAVE SEEN FROM THE CITY CLERK
THAT TO ADD THE WORDS THAT THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE THE FEASIBILITY
OF DOING THIS KIND OF REPORT SO GIVE THE STAFF TIME TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS WE ARE ASKING.
I'M THRILLED AND EXCITED. I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. THIS
WOULD BE A SYMBOLIC MOVE AND A VERY MEANINGFUL MOVE. I'D BE VERY
HAPPY IF WE CAN ALL UNANIMOUSLY MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMETHING
THAT WOULD PUT US IN A POSITION OF BEING IN THE FRONTLINE. NO FOSSIL
FUEL FUNDING AND -- THIS WOULD ENSURE WE WON'T. THANK YOU. I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AMENDMENT IS BEFORE US. I KNOW COUNCILLOR
CARLONE AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN HAVE THEIR HAND UP. I'M GOING
TO BE AWAY FOR A MOMENT, VICE MAYOR MALLON WILL TAKE OVER FOR
THE DISCUSSION. WE'LL BE BACK. GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE. THANK
YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO SAY WHAT I TOLD
COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HER RESEARCH AND
TENACITY ON THIS. I TRIED WITH THE PENSION FUNDS AS OTHERS HAVE-COUNCILLORS TO DIRECTED WHERE MONEY SHOULD GO OR NOT GO, THAT
WAS FRUSTRATING. THAT WAS ABOUT WEAPONS. COMPANIES MAKING
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND OTHER WEAPONS. WE MAY CONSIDER THAT IN THE
FUTURE IN A SIMILAR WAY. I APPRECIATE BEING INVITED TO BE A
COSPONSOR ON THIS. THANK YOU.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN NEXT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS
ORDER AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR IF THE SPONSOR
SHOULD HAVE ME.

“process with”

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER THREE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I DID COSPONSOR THIS ORDER. I
THINK IT HAS EXTRAORDINARY MERIT. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE
AROUND TRYING TO GUARANTEE MORE HOUSING IN OUR CITY TO REALLY
AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP. I KNOW THAT AS IT HIT THE FLOOR, AT
LEAST ONE COLLEAGUE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN BEING A COSPONSOR. I
HAVE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT IT. I
WANT TO ALLOW THE COLLEAGUE, THE CO-MAKER AND THE LEAD TO SPEAK,
AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT. I WANT TO WORK ON
THE ORDER TO SUBMIT -- A FEW MORE ISSUES RELATIVE TO THIS WITH MY
COLLEAGUE. I WANT TO YIELD THE FLOOR TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUE, THE
COSPONSOR, TO SPEAK. AND THEN I'LL CHARTER RIGHT IT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WILL THANK MY COLLEAGUES
FOR COSPONSORING THIS ORDER. IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT THAT
WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WE DO RACIAL JUSTICE IN OUR HOUSING POLICY. AS
WE WERE DEBATING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY IN THE PREVIOUS
TERM AND EARLIER THIS TERM, IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO US REPEATEDLY
BOTH THAT -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS LIMITED BY FUNDING AND HOME
OWNER SHIP RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. IF WE WANT TO SEE MORE HOME
OWNERSHIP PROJECTS DEVELOPED, WE WOULD HAVE TO FUND IT AS A CITY.
THE HOPE IS THIS APPROACH WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THAT. AND I REALLY
WANT TO THANK MY COSPONSORS FOR SUPPORTING IT. AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO THE DEBATE NEXT WEEK.

Add Councillor Zondervan as a
sponsor To Policy Order #1
