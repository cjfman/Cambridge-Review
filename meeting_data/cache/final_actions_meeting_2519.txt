Cambridge consisted of three pillars: strengthening the reliability of the entire system, meeting the growing
demand for electricity and enabling a cleaner energy future.
Mr. Lanhan further explained that Eversource continually evaluated its system to determine future demand. He
explained that the proposed substation should be operational by the year 2024. He stated they would need to
make a decision as of September or October in order to meet that deadline, in order for Eversource to complete
the engineering, regulatory compliance and construction of this type of project.

He emphasized that time is of the essence but Eversource is committed to spending the time necessary to create
a project that will be acceptable to the community even if that pushes the project a little bit beyond the
September/October time frame.
Mr. Lanhan gave a brief overview of the topics that will be discussed by the remaining presenters. He closed by
informing the committee that Eversource is examining alternative sites but he was not at liberty to disclose
specifics during the meeting.
Mr. Andrew explained the potential issues with reliability that exist with the current electrical transmission
system for Cambridge. He explained that Cambridge is a high priority for Eversource because it is the largest
"loss of load situation" for in the system.
He explained that the new substation will be designed in such a way as to mitigate potential issues with
reliability and distribution.
Mr. Andrew stated that this project adds the infrastructure that will allow Eversource to incorporate renewable
sources in the future. He further explained how renewables will be utilized by the system in the future.
Mr. Ludwig explained how Eversource forecasts the future needs of the electrical system. He stated that
Eversource uses an econometric approach that uses historical data to predict future activity, while accounting
for certain variable and unknown elements. He stated that Moody's provides the economic predictions that are
used in this model.
Mr. Ludwig explained that Eversource makes its predictions in 4 steps: Estimate System Peak, Estimate
Substation Peak, Out of Model Adjustments, Internal Reviews.
He stated that operational customers (large electricity users) account for "a majority of load growth on the East
Cambridge Substation". These customers are accounted for in the model by "Step Loads".
Mr. Baldenko explained how Eversource analyzes Non-Wire Alternatives. He described the challenges
associated with these solutions, including the size and cost issues related to the use of solar and storage. Mr.
Baldenko also stated that the use of these alternative energy solutions will necessitate updates to the electrical
grid.
Mr. Bhakta explained that Eversource is investing significant time and money into energy efficiency. He stated
that this investment will continue into the future but it is not a substitute for upgrades to the electrical grid. The
Eversource team works with every customer to increase energy efficiency in every new project.
Vice Mayor Devereaux opened the floor to councillors to ask questions.
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Mr. Andrew explained that disclosing the exact location of
the underground cables that supply electricity to Cambridge could compromise the security of critical
infrastructure and therefore he could not provide that information.

Mr. Lanhan admitted that staff at Eversource has been reviewing this project internally since 2011 however the
City and the community had not been made aware of the project until relatively recently.

In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Mr.Mayall admitted that there is no requirement that the
proposed substation be located on Fulkerson. He explained that Eversource is trying to minimize length of
transmission lines because that would improve the efficiency of the system.
Councillor Zondervan expressed disappointment with the information provided in the presentation. He stated
that the presentation did not explain why the presentation needed to be built at Fulkerson Street.

In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Andrews explained Eversource identified parcels that
would be appropriate for this type of project based on the space available. He explained that none of the parcels
that Eversource currently owns are big enough for this type of project.
Councillor Zondervan stated that 80% of the electricity delivered is fossil fuel derived.
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Andrew explained that, in theory, Eversource could
replace all of its fossil fuel generators with renewable sources. However the energy derived from these
renewable source would be significantly further away from the customers.
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Andrew explained that Cambridge's usage peak is
occurring later in the day. The "load" increases early in the morning and stays there. Additional, solar will not
help for evening activity. In addition, batteries cannot hold a lot of power. Therefore, there would need to be a
lot of batteries need to hold sufficient excess power to supply Cambridge.
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Andrew admitted that "load" growth is primarily
generated by new construction.
Councillor Zondervan stated that based on the graph presented by Eversource they would need another
substation in 6 or 7 years. Mr. Andrew admitted that could happen.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not believe that Eversource would need to purchase 1000s of acres of
land in order to use solar power. Councillor Zondervan stated that serving all the demand with solar is
irrelevant because that is not what the council is asking Eversource to implement. He stated that a non-wires
alternative combines (here inafter "NWA") solar, geothermal and energy efficiency.
Mr. Bhakta explained that based on the scale of this project a NWA would not be feasible.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not believe the presentation explained why NWA is not feasible. He
believes that Eversource should pursue NWA instead of a substation. He wanted a real analysis of non-wired
alternatives.
Councillor Toomey explained that he was encouraged by the on-going discussions. He agreed that this site
should not host a substation.
At 3:13 pm, Vice Mayor Devereaux opened the floor to the public for comment. She explained that public
comment would be limited to 3 minutes per speaker.
Rhonda Massie, 211 Charles Street
She stated she was furious that this land which had been promised would be used as a multi-use sports park is
now being considered for this project. Ms. Massie stated that she was concerned about the high-density
developments that have come to Cambridge. She wants the city to step back and use the space for other uses;
such as residential and open space. She feels that the administration and that Council are overly friendly and
generous to the developers.

In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Lanhan explained that purpose of the presentation
was to explain the need for a new substation, not the specific location. He explained that Eversource is
exploring alternate locations. Eversource acknowledged that the council and the community did not want this
project to move forward at the Fulkerson site.

Matthew Connolly, 13 Cornelius way
Stated that he lives about 400 feet from the Fulkerson site. He wants to work with all to find an alternative site.
None of the conversations happening right now include members of the community, Linden Park neighborhood,
ECPT, etc. Until Fulkerson is not on the table anymore, he is prepared to challenge this at the Siting Board.

Stephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton St
He stated that it was clear to him based on the presentation that Cambridge has an energy crisis. A 50%
demand increase in 5 years is unbelievable. He was disappointed that alternative sites were not discussed in the
presentation. He stated zoning is part of the solution. He was concerned that the City has not already addressed
this issue. Mr. Kaiser was concerned that the City does not have an energy plan.
Jim Gray, 2 Michael Way
He stated that people care and he was aware that several community and school groups are discussing this issue.
He wants the process to be more transparent. The city needs a solution that everyone cares about and is a
model for others.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street
She stated that this area is zoned for housing, not industrial uses. She was struck by the fact that the City has
not done anything about this issue. She felt that the city administration does not care about the residents.
Peter Valentine, 37 Brookline Street
He stated that everything started naturally, with natural forces. The future doesn't involve manual technology, it
involves supernatural technology. We're headed toward becoming a fantastic society, and nothing can stop it.
Ilan Levy, 148 Spring Street
He stated that he was very upset by the presentation. Mr. Levy stated that the City and Eversource have failed
by not communicating or planning for a net-zero future.
Chris Matthews, 26 Sixth Street
He stated that he has only lived in Cambridge for 20 years, but when he moved to East Cambridge it was low
density industrial. Mr. Matthews stated that he is concerned about the high density commercial development
around the city. He was also concerned that Eversouce would construct a 150 foot wall around this project. He
would not support that kind of development.
Vice Mayor Devereux closed public comment at 4:35 PM.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she acknowledged that there is a lot of mistrust around this development but
that she felt that they were making progress in reaching an alternative solution. She encouraged city staff to
meet with residents about this issue in the next several weeks. She stated that rebuilding trust with residents was
an important step that city staff should pursue.
In response to question from Vice Mayor Devereux, Mr. Andrew explained that the FERC filing from early July
is an annually filed documents. He explained that the substation described in the filling were planning grade
estimates based on previous facilities that Eversource had built. He explained that the size of substation is
based on the amount of equipment that can be placed at a location both above and below ground.
In response to question from Vice Mayor Devereux, Deputy Solicitor Goldberg stated that the City is in the
process of hiring a consultant for advice about this issue. He explained that the scope of service would help the
City analyze any filings from Eversource.

Pamela Van Dort, 13 Cornelius Way
She wanted to see the presentation focused on alternative solutions. Ms. Van Dort was happy to hear that
Eversource is having discussions with the City and developers, but she and other neighbors have not been part
of those conversations. She encourages Eversource to put the substation somewhere else, not next to a school, a
public park, or residence.

Commissioner O'Riordan clarified the consultant will work with the law department and the Department of
Public works to explore alternative sites for this project. He further stated that the city was meeting with several
developers to find an alternative site.

Mr. Ludwig stated that Eversource does follow Brooklyn-Queens project. He explained that there were several
differences between Brooklyn-Queens and Cambridge that make direct comparisons difficult.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he would like to see more reductions in demand rather than increases in
demand.
Mr. Bhakta stated that Eversource is looking to grow their demand reduction program but he was not sure if that
would meet the needs of the community alone.
In response the questions from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Andrew stated that he thought there may be issues
related to the Brooklyn-Queens project that may need time to be fully analyzed.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he is hoping to see more creative approaches in the future.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated she will have another committee meeting in September.
Vice Mayor Devereux emphasized that she expected staff from the administration to schedule a meeting with
residents on this issue.
Vice Mayor Devereux read into the record that the committee received two communications from members of
public.
Vice Mayor Devereux adjourned the meeting at 5:02pm.

Councillor Zondervan confirmed that Eversource was aware of the Brooklyn-Queens Power Development
project by ConEdison. Councillor Zondervan stated that ConEdison avoided a $1.2 billion expansion with a
$200 million project. They saved 97 megawatts in demand reduction. Councillor Zondervan wondered why
Eversource are not discussing a reduced usage approach for Cambridge.

In Service Date

Projections show the need to have a new substation operational as early
as 2024, assuming the Putnam interim solution has been implemented.
In that timeframe, we need to:
• Engineer the project (station and street routes).
• Develop an alternative viable solution.
• Craft the regulatory filings.
• Complete regulatory hearings.
• Construct the station and line construction.
• So, by late 2019, we need to have an internally approved site, route
and conceptual design along with a viable alternative to begin
detailed engineering.

In this case, though planning began in 2011, we scrapped everything
and started over in Summer 2019.
While time is of the essence, it is important to us to dedicate the time
and effort now to get this right.

Econometrics

Econometric forecasting approach allows us to:
• Account for economic conditions including non-manufacturing
employment.
• Include reductions due to company sponsored energy
efficiency (EE) and behind-the-meter solar.
• Capture pockets of load growth by identifying known customer
projects.
• Incorporate weather and recent trends in peak demands.
• Calculate how much of the monthly historical changes in peak
demand are due to heating, cooling and employment.

System Peak and Substation Modeling

Step 1 – Estimate Cambridge System Peak

▪
▪

▪
▪

Model is estimated at the operating company level.
Monthly model consists of weather variables, an
economic variable and dummy variables.
Summer peak demand weather is a function of a
3-day weighted temperature humidity index (THI)
and cooling degree days (CDD’s).
Economic projections are provided by Moody’s
Analytics.

Step 2 – Estimate Substation Peak

▪

▪

Econometric model measures relationship between
operating company system history and individual
substations.
–
Is substation growing slower, faster or same as
the system?
Historical relationship between substation and system
is projected into the future based off forecasted system
growth rate.
–
Forecast inherently includes weather and
economic assumptions from Step 1.

Solar
• Not feasible due to scale & duration needed.
➢

300MW needed, accounting for variability, >1000 acres (1MW~5 acres)

• Duration of need far exceeds solar availability.
➢
➢

21 hours (12-3am) per day to address overloads, 24-hour multi-day for cable outages.
Not suitable as standalone solution – requires storage or other generation.

• Widespread system upgrades still needed for integration.

Energy storage
• Not feasible due to scale and lack of capacity for charging.
➢
➢

60MW needed with 18 hour operation over multiple days.
Could only recharge ~5% from grid during off-peak hours.

• Very large land or customer requirements to add generation for recharging.

Gas/emergency generation
• Not feasible due to scale and increased emissions.
➢
➢

More than 60 mobile generators (~1MW).
Hundreds of fuel cells, CHP (<1MW).

• Peaks occur on hot days when there is limited demand for CHP generation.
• System upgrades still needed.

Build in Redundancy, Accommodate Load Growth, Prepare for Tomorrow

A new substation is urgently needed to address the redundancy need in Cambridge, meet
the projected load growth and provide a flexible system that can integrate clean energy from
different locations, at varying scale, optimizing the use of resources.

▪

The Cambridge delivery system needs to be more resilient and flexible to ensure system reliability and
enable a clean energy future.

▪

Load growth is continuing despite highly efficient new development and many years of successful
energy efficiency (EE) programs in Cambridge.

▪

Incremental Energy Efficiency provides significant benefits in Cambridge and has been factored into
the load forecasts.

▪

Interim solutions, such as enhancements proposed at Putnam Avenue Substation, help meet the
immediate need but do not address Cambridge redundancy needs.

▪

Solar and energy storage are not feasible alternatives to solve the challenges faced in Cambridge.

We remain committed to working collaboratively with the community and the City of
Cambridge to develop a viable solution that can be placed in service to address the electric
needs in Cambridge.

Fulkerson Substation Alternate Location

Dear Transportation and Public Utilities Committee Members,
I personally favor the expansion of the existing East Cambridge electrical substation on the Veolia cogeneration site
as an alternative to Fulkerson St. Eversource has said there is too much infrastructure in the ground to expand the
substation. However, I understand the Biomed Realty Trust has found space on the Veolia site to relocate the natural
gas pump station located on 3rd St. This leads me to believe there is room to expand the electrical substation on the
Veolia site, but it is a question of cost and effort required of having two public utilities negotiate with one other. Since
money isn’t as scarce as land in East Cambridge, I ask the committee to further explore this option with Eversource.
Very truly yours,
Charles Hinds

Dear Council members,
I've attached comments on the Eversource substation to enter into the record for today's Transportation and Public
Utilities hearing. I sincerely hope you will do everything in your power to oppose the substation's creation, especially
should Eversource choose to move forward with the EFSB. We cannot let for-profit companies and developers
determine the future of our city. Thank you.

comments regarding the new substation on Fulkerson Street

Morning councilors,
My name is Kristin Imre and I live on Windsor St in the Wellington-Harrington neighborhood of Cambridge. I can not be at
the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee meeting today and wanted to write to share some thoughts with you about
the future of energy needs in Kendall and the location of the new substation.
As a resident of the Wellington-Harrington neighborhood, I am deeply opposed to the proposed site on Fulkerson Street for
the new substation. The dangers it presents to the neighborhood as a whole and also to the students at Kennedy-Longfellow
are unacceptable. However, I think it is vital that we not only oppose building the substation on Fulkerson Street; we should
oppose its construction entirely. In a city that is committed to proactively addressing our climate crisis, we should not be
building new fossil fuel infrastructure. We need to think instead about other ways to address our energy needs--such as
council member Quinton Zondervan's suggestion to explore demand management.
Please help our city build towards the future health of our community.
Thank you,
Kristin

Comment for 10/2 public utilities meeting

I'm writing in opposition to the Fulkerson Street site and any new Eversource-operated electrical substation.
As a historian working at one of Cambridge's cultural institutions, it sickens me to imagine archivists someday reviewing
Council hearing minutes that approved a new, privately-managed, unnecessary electrical substation. What archivists
need to see and future Cambridge residents need to experience is a switch to public utilities reliant on decarbonized
energy sources.
If not, our future generations will, instead, endure the environmental and health risks posed by privately-owned, fossil
fuel-driven energy. While Eversource will reap the benefits, our residents will bear the costs. I do not want future
historians to read about the diseases we inflicted on Cambridge's youth or ecological damage incurred if such a
substation is approved.
I appreciate all the work done by our City Councilors to bring attention to this issue and search for alternative energy
sources.
Regards,
Perri Meldon

Concerns about substation on Fulkerson St

Dear City Councilors,
My name is Beth Huang, and I live at 122 Berkshire St in Wellington-Harrington, just blocks away from the proposed site
of the substation on Fulkerson St. Ahead of the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee meeting, I wanted to voice
my opposition to the proposed site of the substation, which is across from an elementary school and near a park and
may pose environmental threats and harm to my neighborhood.
Substations emit powerful EMF, which may be harmful to the health of children and pregnant women (one fairly
comprehensive reference here). Substations have also been known to explode, like this explosion and fire in Madison,
WI, which occurred blocks from a house where I lived in during college.
Wellington-Harrington has the some of the largest amounts of public and affordable housing in the city. We've already
experienced two big fires in my three years in the neighborhood that have caused displacement of vulnerable residents
and closures of immigrant-owned small businesses. (I can't wait until Kimchi Kitchen reopens, but that's admittedly a
very minor personal inconvenience.) I don't want the low-income residents to face yet another threat to their ability to
stay in Cambridge.
The increased electrical demand in the area has been driven by the biotech and other industries, but ratepayers will
have to bear the cost in increased electrical rates. I'd like to see these highly profitable companies pay their fair share,
instead of residents bearing new costs.
Finally, this new substation that will continue our dependence on fossil fuels (electricity from the site is estimated to be
generated by about 86% natural gas). I believe we need renewable energy and democratic voice for residents to have a
say in their local utility decisions. I hope that you too will oppose the proposed site of the substation.
All the best,
Beth

Fulkerson street substation

Dear Vice Mayor, City Council members, and City Manager,
I would like to ask you to please prioritize the needs and safety of the Fulkerson Street neighborhood residents when
discussing the site of the proposed substation in East Cambridge. The community should be given notice, and be allowed
to weigh in to any utility development project that will affect their neighborhood. Placing the substation so close to an
elementary school seems like too great a hazard--small children are curious and may not be able to read the signs
warning them of potential danger. I ask you to please also consider whether electricity needs could alternately be met
by increasing community solar generation and storage, or other clean energy technology. Allowing Eversource to force
an unwanted substation into a residential community would be a clear misstep.
Thank you for your consideration,
Karry Muzzey

Eversource substation proposal at 135 Fulkerson St

To whom it may concern,
I am a current resident of East Cambridge (241 Cardinal Medeiros Av.) and I wanted to express my outrage regarding the
proposal to build an electrical substation on Fulkerson street right next to a school and a residential area.
While I realize that additional infrastructure might be needed to support the new developments in the area, placing a
substation in such a location is a safety concern for the neighborhood and all the parties involved should urgently
identify a more suitable area for such a project.
Moving forward with this proposal would be devastating for a community that has long been suffering all the negative
consequences of the constant noise and pollution due to the never ending construction in the Kendall square area these
past few years.
Best,
Felix Gonzalez
241 Cardinal Medeiros Ave
PS: Unfortunately I will not be able to attend the hearing tomorrow due to my work obligations but I wanted to express
my opinion in this matter.

Comments on Fulkerson St Substation

Good evening Mayor Devereux,
Although I won't be able to attend the hearing tomorrow about the electricity needs of Kendall Square and the location
for a new substation (currently slated for Fulkerson Street), I wanted to send a note urging you and the council to center
community justice and the environment as you go through this process. Consider the needs and safety of the children in
the elementary school, the residents in the immediate neighborhood (who are not the ones driving up the electricity
needs in Kendall Square), and the fact that we should not be building new fossil fuel infrastructure at all (which, given
the current makeup of the electricity grid, this would be) with climate change looming around us.
Considering all of this, I'm confident you'll decide that the site on Fulkerson Street is not right; but I also hope that the
substation is not just moved to another residential neighborhood, but that demand management and other alternative
routes besides building a new substation can be explored. I also hope that this (and similar experiences) will inform
decision-making and approval for new developments in Cambridge going forward.
Thanks,
John

Comment re: Eversource's proposed substation at Fulkerson St

Dear Vice Mayor Devereux,
My name is Nafis Hasan, and I am a resident of Jamaica Plain, MA. I am writing to you today to oppose Eversource's
planned substation at Fulkerson st right across from the Kennedy-Longfellow elementary school. I hope that my
following comments will still be considered even though I am not a resident of Cambridge - to be clear, I am making
these comments in my capacity as a biomedical researcher.
The health risks of locating an electrical substation that close to an elementary school have not been disclosed by
Eversource based on my readings of the minutes from the hearings on the substation. In particular, I want to draw your
attention to the hazards posed by the substation to children and pregnant women, specifically in the context of cancer
risk. The range of magnetic fields measured near substation fence are generally 1-8 mG (10 mG=1 uTesla); according to
the National Cancer Institute, meta-analyses of multiple studies have shown substantial increase (~2-fold) in risk of
childhood leukemias in children exposed to 0.4 uTesla or higher. The BioInitiative 2012 Report, composed by
international experts, concluded that exposure to ELF (extremely low frequency magnetic field, as released by
substations) causes childhood leukemia, and that long-term ELF exposure is a risk factor for breast cancer in women, as
well as Alzheimer's Disease. A 2017 study found that pregnant women exposed to higher magnetic fields have 3 times
higher risk of miscarriage than those exposed to lower magnetic fields; this was also echoed by California Dept of Health
Services experts who reviewed studies related to possible health problems from exposure to EMF created by power
lines, wiring in homes and businesses, and appliances at the behest of the California Public Utilities Commission in 2008.
Considering that an electrical substation has a higher density of power lines in its proximity, these health risks should be
considered before locating a substation near an elementary school or a residential neighborhood.
In my humble opinion, whether or not Eversource can come up with an alternate location for the substation shouldn't
be the determining factor. We need to evaluate this proposal in the context of the climate crisis, the potential health
hazards of this infrastructure, and the demands of the community who will be affected by the substation, all of which
point towards saying no to this substation.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Nafis
