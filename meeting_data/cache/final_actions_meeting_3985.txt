ADVANCING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY (AHA) PETITION

Communication: Donovan petition_20211116 (Public Hearings)

Three-Part Proposal (pieces of a larger whole)
1. Modify single-and-two family zoning to better use of our housing stock
2. Require rain permeable materials for residential outdoor parking
3. An area wide plan for large employers
* The desire for housing in Cambridge is immense. We need to address this wisely.
This is not an issue Cambridge alone can solve.

KEY ISSUES

• Impact of our rich innovation-based technology on housing needs
• Increased population & arrival of wealthier residents (employees of new bio- and info-tech jobs and
others) plus property investment fuels escalating housing costs and resident displacement.
• Cambridge has the brain power and financial resources to deal successfully with this problem, but it
must be both a local and broadly regional plan

Communication: Donovan petition_20211116 (Public Hearings)

• Demand for housing in Cambridge is infinite. We need a far reaching and multi-dimensional plan

Local and regional factors are fueling housing demand
and a wide variety of policies can help address this

A THREE PLUS ONE PLAN

Communication: Donovan petition_20211116 (Public Hearings)

,,
Using current buildings is the best, fastest, least expensive and easiest
way to add units.
One way is to add 1 more unit to existing triple-deckers.
Create adaptable design templates for plus 1 units for triple-deckers

With c. 4,000 triple-deckers, adding 1 more unit to each would
create 4,000 new homes – inexpensively, quickly, & sustainably.
.
Streamline permitting & disseminate the adaptable design templates.

PART III - SEEKING AN AREA-WIDE APPROACH
AHA - an area wide plan for major Cambridge employers to house 85% of employees and affiliates in area by year 2040

December 2019 PTDM Meeting
PTDM addresses 30% of all Cambridge employees,
plus educational facilities, R&D development, a
hospital, & 10,000 graduate & primary students.
*Adding housing to PTDM (Article 6 via Article 9 will
help keep current residents & address housing costs
**Adding housing is natural next step for the PTDM and the annual Town Gown report that now includes infrastructure.

Is 100 employees/affiliates and 85% the right numbers? The PTDM ordinance uses “Large Projects” and “Small Projects” as criteria.

Communication: Donovan petition_20211116 (Public Hearings)

Expand 1998 Parking, Transportation (PTDM) Ordinance to include housing and address unintended
housing-related consequences of commercial development and growth. Monitoring & accountability
through annual review. Linked to zoning article 19, via quasi-zoning Article 6.

That could work instead, but City should be included as big employer. On policy: when CDD requires 20% of a new company’s employees to
11
be housed in Cambridge, for a company of 4,000, this means 800 new units. AHA would address impacts & enhance linkage fees. Packet Pg. 12

Universities have added housing at key moments in our history

MIT

HARVARD
The significant % of the students, grad students, & staff living in non-affiliated Cambridge housing, many in rental units
(with stipends rising annually) now impacts city housing needs and costs. If universities help address local AND area
housing, these units could go to others. The AHA’s 2040 goal of 85% coverage of undergraduates, graduates, post-docs,
and staff would enable us to better track this and redress needs on a broader local AND area-wide basis.

Communication: Donovan petition_20211116 (Public Hearings)

Exponential institutional growth in undergrads, graduate students, post docs, and staff
– impacts the city. We need their help to address the future –

Communication: Donovan petition_20211116 (Public Hearings)

LOCAL AND AREA HOUSING POLICIES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM AN AREA-WIDE APPROACH

Note: the AHA intent is not to have 85% of employees/affiliates live in employer housing by 2040, but for these groups to come to the table to address
