significantly over the last number of years. There is a significant concentration on addressing issues associated
with cyclists and providing a safe way for them to travel. The department of public works meets with the
Human Services Department and the Disabilities Commission on an annual basis about snow removal. In 2017,

explained the challenges with removing snow from bicycle lanes.

clearing schools. The water department clears all the property that surrounds the reservation. He further

clear snow. He explained how the configuration of a street could hinder snow clearing.
Joseph Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking and Transportation, gave a PowerPoint presentation with is attached to
these minutes.
Mr. Barr explained some of the difference between snow removal in Montreal versus Cambridge. Montreal
gets twice as much snow as Cambridge. He explained that local residential streets in Montreal are not generally
plowed to bare pavement. He explained that in Montreal, the city blows snow right on to the lawns of
homeowners. He explained that sidewalks abut streets in Montreal making them easier to clear with a plow.
Brendan Tierney from WalkBoston stated clear sidewalks are crucial to mobility in the winter. He explained
that there are a patchwork of snow clearing regulations in Massachusetts. He stated that sidewalks that are not
properly cleared can strand people in their homes

In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about who clears snow in Central Square, Mr. O'Riordan,
stated that the city clears the area around Carl Barren Plaza. He stated that the BID has done a wonderful job in
terms of addressing snow clearance in that area as well. He added that a lot of the city’s new projects
incorporate raised crosswalks which helps with snow clearance.
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that she has noticed significant improvements in snow clearance in central square.
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about the use of Mooney Street for snow hauling, Mr.
O'Riordan, explained that location is private property and the city does not have access. He stated that the City
has worked with Harvard University to find places to haul snow. He explained that the city is looking at
melting equipment to help remove snow.
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about how snow equipment navigates certain streets, Mr.
Nardone stated that for narrow streets the city can use small pick-up trucks. He stated that large equipment
cannot be used on fields.
Mr. O'Riordan described what the Department of Public considers when purchasing snow equipment, including
speed and capacity. The problem is the city eight of these pieces of equipment at the moment, and three or four
of them that are broken down. Repairing this equipment is very intensive.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the Department of Public Works is doing heroic work, but the City is not
doing a good job. He stated that the city should remove cars during snowing clearing and hire people to clear
sidewalks.
Mr. O'Riordan explained that the city is looking for places to store snow and will have to buy snow melters in
the future.
In response to a question from Councillor Simmons about clearing bike paths, Mr. O'Riordan explained the
challenges related to clearing bike paths.
Mr. Barr added that city currently leaves the separated bike lane flex posts in the street during snow clearing
operations.

the city to clear snow from handicapped parking spaces. He also stated that 50% of people who do not clear

sidewalks get fined. He stated that the city could hire people to clear sidewalks and bill people who have not
cleared their sidewalk.
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Mr. O'Riordan stated that when the city is
expecting a reasonably heavy snowfall, they start looking for contractors, as well as city employees to commit
to clean up. The city generally has between 150 to 170 pieces of equipment on the street to address that storm.
He explained that it is a competitive process with other communities because contractors are in short supply.
The city is spending 24 to 48 hours trying to address the immediate storm and its impact and then immediately
after that cleaning all of the bus stops and the adjacent pedestrian ramps on the sidewalks. Mr. O’Riordan
stated that they try to hire shovelers every year, the city may get two or three showers for the first night of the
storm, but it is hard to keep them for the following days.
Mr. Nardone added that it is hard to hire contractors for shoveling and plowing.
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about fines, Mr. O’Riordan stated he is happy to
have a conversation with the law departments about placing liens against property owners. His memory is that
there are very limited mechanisms available to in terms of ensuring people pay their fines.
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about clearing key corridors, Mr. Barr stated that
city has spotty data about pedestrian traffic patterns. He stated that the data is not currently being used for snow
removal. He stated that officials know most of the busy intersections.
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about increasing the role of the larger institutions in
snow removal, Mr. O'Riordan stated that the city has not had conversation with them about expanding the role
in the community. They have discussed making sure that disabled parking spaces around their campuses are
always cleared. He stated that staff would be happy to have those conversations.
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about buying snow removal equipment for the business
improvement districts, Mr. O'Riordan stated that would create significant liability issues.
