Adjusted Maximum Determined
Contribution Rate
 Non-Cambridge sources help fund required subsidy for

affordable housing
 Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Fund supplied 43%
of subsidy to recent low- and moderate-income projects
 Assume 73% of subsidy for middle income rental units
and 100% of subsidy for middle-income ownership units
 Applying these CAHT shares to required subsidy reduces
the maximum determined contribution to $33.34
 $20.90 for low- and moderate-income units
 $12.44 for middle-income units

Job Contribution Nexus
 New development creates employment

opportunities for Cambridge residents


Focus on occupations for lower skilled workers

 Education and training services will be needed to

address labor supply gap and prepare Cambridge
residents to access to these jobs



Occupational training
English language, math skills and ESOL

 If existing services are insufficient to meet needs,

contributions are warranted to fund this service gap

Review of Existing Ordinance and Policy Options
Policy 0ptions considered:


Change project size threshold




Few projects under 30,000 SF; little impact on revenue

Vary contribution rate by use
Impacts do vary by use: restaurants have largest impact on housing
and jobs; Institutions and R&D space the least
 Administrative complexity and changes in use over time are
problems




Vary contribution rate by geography
Rents and development economics differ between east and west
Cambridge
 Risk of unintended consequences from differing fees and incentives
for investment across Cambridge


Competitive Impact of Maximum Determined
Contributions
 Maximum determined rate would double the current rate


3X Boston and 2.5 X Somerville’s level

 Contribution increase will add to project development costs

 Developers may seek to reduce acquisition costs, lower

investment returns or raise rents in response to increased rate




Commercial rental impact: adds $2.22 psf over ten year lease, + 2.5%
to 4.3%
Impact on equity returns: ~ 100 basis point decline

 East Cambridge rents are highest in region


Strong demand for space may allow developers to pass on added costs

Communication: Incentive Zoning_20200211 (Incentive zoning)

 West Cambridge office rents: 45-50% above competing suburbs
