Results of research & outreach
• Businesses and consumers want to reduce waste, but neither
want to solely bear responsibility
• Alternatives to single-use plastics:
• May have higher environmental impact than plastics
• May contain plastic (i.e. paper cups have plastic liner)
• May be more expensive for businesses.
• May not be recyclable or compostable.
• May not be suitable for some takeout orders from restaurants.

• Banning plastics may increase waste (i.e. A ban on plastic cups
yields more paper cups which aren’t recyclable)
