The Cambridge Transportation De-Carbonization and Congestion-Mitigation Bill
Purpose: The Purpose of this bill is to further Cambridge’s efforts to decarbonize
transportation, to mitigate traffic congestion and to decrease parking demands
by allowing commercial use of privately-owned electric vehicle charging stations
in residential districts and by allowing rental of shared-use micromobility
devices in residential districts.
Petition Text is as follows:
Publicly-accessible, Privately-owned Electric Vehicle Charging System. An electric vehicle
charging system and its attendant parking spot located on privately owned property that is
available, for free or through a financial transaction, to members of the general public for the
sole purpose of charging an electric vehicle owned by an entity other than the property owner.
Electric vehicle. Any vehicle that is licensed and registered for operation on public and private
highways, roads, or streets and that operates exclusively on electrical energy from an off-board
source that is stored in the vehicle’s batteries, producing zero tailpipe emissions or pollution
when stationary or operating.
Shared Vehicle. Any privately-owned vehicle that is licensed and registered for operation on
public and private highways, roads, and streets that is available, for free or through a financial
transaction, to members of the general public through a shared mobility platform. A shared
vehicle does not include Carsharing Vehicles and Organizations as regulated in Section 6.24.
Shared Mobility Device. A mobility device such as a scooter, bicycle, or other transportation
device that is not legal to operate on public highways that is made available for personal use to
members or customers through a self-service automated reservation system, for free or
through a financial transaction, but not by means of a separate written agreement that is
entered into each time a device is operated by a member or customer. A Shared Mobility Device
must be owned, maintained or operated by, and made available through, a Shared Mobility
Platform.
Shared Mobility Platform. An entity with a distributed fleet of Shared Mobility Devices, either
owned by or made available through the Platform, that charges a use-based fee related to a
specific device or for which the Platform provides services based on membership.

Crane, Paula; City Clerk
Suggested modifications to EV charging, vehicle share and MM zoning language

Dear Councilors:
I’ve talked to most of you thus far, as well as a number of other people, and I think the modifications to the mobility
zoning proposal I’ve highlighted below would be helpful in addressing concerns made by both Councilors and CDD staff
about “street legal,” number of cars one might be able to offer for rental and the status of the EV charger being offered
for rent.
I would appreciate one of your substituting the language below, in its entirety, for the existing proposal.
I look forward to discussing the proposal with you shortly.
Craig
Publicly-accessible, Privately-owned Electric Vehicle Charging System. A legally installed electric vehicle
