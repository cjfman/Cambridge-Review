441 MORGAN: PARK VIEW

The northeast and northwest
elevations employ a highly
transparent curtain wall, and
use oriented facets and fins to
embrace the park.
The northeast façade faces
Morgan Avenue, and the
northwest façade faces Leighton
Street. These two façades
are visually articulated as a
composition of smaller masses
through the use of vertical
breaks, shifting faces and
material transitions.
The nature of the terraced
setbacks, projecting terracotta
fins and varied façade angles
help to create shifting and
varied roof lines while clearly
expressing the top of the
building.

The southeast and southwest
elevations adopt metal panel
cladding in context with adjacent
buildings.
The distinct base, middle and
top are further accentuated by
the large picture window on the
south façade. The bottom of this
large picture window is aligned
with the setbacks that create
the ‘base’ on the northeast and
northwest façades. Similarly, the
top of the window delineates
a ‘top’ that is aligned with the
top that is expressed on the
northeast and northwest
façades.
441 Morgan uses variable
pilasters along its Gilmore Bridge
frontage to create a striking
visual ripple, with vertical cuts
and a picture window opening to
relate to the scale of the bridge.
The faceting and terraced
setbacks of the Leighton Street
and Morgan Avenue elevations
create a complementary iconic
presence on these frontages.
The prominent material palette
of glass and natural-toned
materials also creates a striking
presence on all sides.

The two-storey portal at
the main entrance provides
additional transparency
and enlivens the pedestrian
experience.
The eastern corner of 441
Morgan is comparable in height
to the adjacent Sierra and Tango
buildings.
The northeast façade shifts
planes and materials four times
over the entry portal in order to
create an articulated pedestrian
experience.
A transparent and inviting lobby
glazed entrance with hightransparency low-iron glass is
accentuated by framed portals

A human-scaled horizontal

The building conforms with the
Design Guideline Build-To line
with the exception of the east
corner. This corner flares slightly
beyond the build-to line for
several reasons. First, it forms
a more continuous street wall
with the fence line north of the
Gilmore Bridge piers. Second, it
blocks the view of the underside
of the Gilmore Bridge from
the public realm in front of the
building. Third, it makes the
at-grade entrance to the public
elevator more visible from the
sidewalk in front of the building
and the common. Fourth, it helps
enclose the eastern end of the
Common. Finally, it helps block
noise and sightlines to the traffic

441 MORGAN: GLASSWORKS VIEW

The more solid façade of the
southeast and southwest sides
relates to the punched windows
of nearby buildings. Vertical
cuts in these south façades
create a visual connection
across Glassworks Avenue and
the Gilmore Bridge, and more
distantly to the Back Bay and
Boston.
Variable expression of the
southeast and southwest
pilasters also repeat on a 42’
bay rhythm. This is further
articulated on all façades by
the typical 5’-3” façade module,
which is comfortable for the
pedestrian experience as it
relates to human scale.
