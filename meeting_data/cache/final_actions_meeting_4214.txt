buildings

21 21
Packet Pg.

Key Flexibility Mechanisms in
Council Discussion
Alternative Compliance Credits shall be equivalent to one ton of GHG
emissions, and used by the City for City programs and projects to support
GHG reduction
 ACCs start at $234/ton, based on analysis of average cost of reducing
emissions from BEUDO buildings, and adjusted over time based on actual
costs
 Potential to take credit for GHG reductions paid for in other buildings
beyond requirements
 Potential deferral of ACCs up to 10 years to execute capital improvement
projects, assuming that cumulative GHG reductions are equivalent

Key Flexibility Mechanisms in
Council Discussion
Carbon Credits are off-site measures to offset only the emissions from direct
fossil fuel use of the building
 Carbon credits would be distinguished between local and global sources
 Use of carbon credits will be phased down over time, with global credits
ending in 2035 and local credits ending in 2045
 CDD would issue regulations to certify eligible carbon credits
 The cost of carbon credits would be subtracted from the cost of ACCs
needed to comply in a given year

Key Flexibility Mechanisms in
Council Discussion
Off-site Renewable Electricity can offset only the electricity use of the
building
 Renewable electricity must come from new sources (purchaser-caused)
 Renewable electricity may come from anywhere in the country
 As the state electricity grid gets greener, buildings automatically get credit
thanks to emission factors which are set by regulation
 The Cambridge Community Electricity aggregation program will also
deliver increasing amounts of BEUDO-compliant renewable electricity

Challenges of an Electrified Society
Electrification will drive an unprecedented load growth on the electric system

Attachment: Eversource_Cambridge City Council_Final_11222022 (COM 1034 #2022 : A

a

New England ISO finds that by 2035 the system peak will have gone up to 150% of the
2022 peak, flipping to a winter peak, while the winter peak will have increased to almost
190% from 2022’s January peak. By 2050 those values will reach 232% and 290%
respectively.

Challenges
I.

Uneven adoption propensity of electrification
requires detailed models to prioritize
investments

A recent study commissioned by the MassCEC is expected to show significant
incremental distribution capital investments in the Commonwealth till 2050 to ensure
sufficient distribution capacity

II.

Investment optimization on the electric system
as well as across the gas and electric
company to provide an integrated plan

III.

Communication of the necessity and level of
investments to regulators and stakeholders
using data driven results

IV.

Manage current inflection point of rising
energy cost, significant proposed distribution
investments, and challenges to the EDC
business model

Developing a Path Forward

a

Developing Data Driven Approaches
Forecasting models for key technologies provide data driven inputs to strategic decisionmaking processes;


Optimal Capital Investment based on data driven adoption rate models and state
policy objectives to ensure power systems are up to the task

Policy Coordination to inform rate and policy makers of costs associated with clean
energy objectives and collaboratively develop the best course of action



Reliability Planning to secure the Company’s central role in ensuring a safe and
reliable power supply while growing the asset base

And allow Eversource to take the lead when coordinating with other entities through
advanced data analytics;


State Entities such as the DOER, DOT, DPU, AGO, and MassCEC to drive
infrastructure investments and design programs



Developer Communities to drive solar development in optimal locations



Strategic Customers to support electrification in a sustainable manner

Eversource is taking the initiative

a

Strategic Investment into Advanced Forecasting and Modeling
Dedicated team to transition forecasting from load centric, single value forecasts to
advanced forecasting with multiple variables based on policy objectives.


New Software Solutions such as LoadSeer, GridTwin, and Microsoft DataBricks
allow for forecasting far ahead of industry standards across North America
($3+ Million in GridMod 1.5 Funding)



Key Talent investments by introducing data scientists into System Planning with a
team of three data scientists and one forecasting engineer

Dedicated Synergi Modeling Function to allow incorporation of forecasts into models and
transition planning into 8760 models


Centralized Model Management to ensure consistent model quality and to provide
models as a service to all DSP, DER, and DE departments



Development of Planning Models which represent the build out state of the system
till 2050, including all forecasts

Whats Next? Expected approval of ~$5 Million GridMod funding to introduce significant
automation in Synergi, as well as probabilistic power flow capabilities.

For the Greater Cambridge Project, the
Company evaluated Storage + other options as
a Non-Wires Alternative

Scenario

For the 2032 forecast on a 2050 timescale to
decarbonization, a battery need was established

Maximum Achievable Energy Efficiency and Demand Response

The Battery identified would be
–

An additional load and consume 183 MWh
in heat losses per cycle (more than a 5
MW Lab building in a day) adding to urban
heating effects

–

Cannot be cost effectively split up and
would be equal to more than 84,000 tesla
power walls

–

Require significant space, compares to
Moss Landing at 1600 MWh which
replaced an entire power plant and sits on
more than 7 acres

More than 585 MW of summer peak
demand projected for 2030

More than 961 MW of winter peak
demand projected with residual gas,
pipeline gas, hydrogen application in
non-displaceable load.

More than 1300 MW of winter peak
demand projected for 2050 @ 100%
gas displacement

Requires very aggressive timelines for
additional projects to meet full need
(1300 MW of winter peak) by 2035

Current 2030 Status Quo
5 Distribution bulk Substations
16 Bulk Transformers
~250+ distribution feeder of
various voltages
~2000+ large distribution service
transformers

Compared to 2030
Additional 2 bulk Substations
Additional 8 Bulk Transformers
Additional ~80+ distribution

Additional ~700+ large distribution
service transformers

Compared to 2030
Additional 4 bulk Substations
Additional 16 Bulk Transformers
Additional ~150+ distribution

Additional ~1200+ large
distribution service transformers

Assumptions:
GCEP infrastructure is in place
Load growth is in line with
forecasts
Electrification targets aligned
with 2050 Decarbonization
Roadmap

Assumptions
- Includes 100% residential and 50%
commercial gas conversion
- Does not include electrifying the
steam system
- Assumes growth on 2050 timeline;
Winter peak occurs between 2030
and 2040

Assumptions
- 100% conversion of gas
consumption to electric at COP 2
- 100% electric vehicle conversion

Compared to 2030
Accelerated siting and permitting
for 4 additional bulk substations
Expedited routing/permitting for
new UG transmission lines
Rapid construction of new feeders
and upgrades to UG distribution
Deployment of many additional
customer service transformers

Safety First and Always

None of these projects are currently in
the Company’s10-year plan

All 2035 and 2050 numbers exclude any
future development and growth above and
beyond the 2032 forecast in the region which
would further increase need.
