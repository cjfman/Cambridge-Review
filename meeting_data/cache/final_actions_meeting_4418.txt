1.1

August 23, 2023
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am writing to recommend that the City Council approve an Order to take via a “friendly” eminent
domain proceeding a parcel of land located at 41 Bellis Circle, Cambridge (as shown on Cambridge
Assessors Map 271,Lot 44) (the “Parcel”), which is owned by 41 Bellis Circle LLC. The Premises
consists of an asphalt parking lot. Upon the taking, the Premises would be used for general municipal
uses, which may include municipal operations, stormwater management and/or affordable housing.
Pursuant to Section 30 of Chapter 43, Section 14 of Chapter 40, and Chapter 79 of the General Laws, all
as amended, the City Council is authorized to take in fee in the name of the City for any municipal
purpose any land within the limits of the City not already appropriated for public use. I recommend that
the City Council take the above referenced Parcel of Land by eminent domain for the purpose of assisting
with municipal uses.
Background
The Parcel consists of one large parcel totaling 40,383 square feet (0.9 acres). The Premises currently
serves as a parking lot. The ability to purchase approximately one (1) acre of land within the City is a rare
opportunity. The acquisition of the entirety of the Premises will allow the City to use the land for general
municipal uses. The City will evaluate what it will use the Parcel for as part of a comprehensive review of
City owned property and City needs. This Parcel could fill a significant need that the City has for land to
use for municipal operations and infrastructure, but it also may ultimately be land that could be used for
affordable housing.
41 Bellis Circle LLC has agreed to sell the Parcel to the City (via the proposed friendly eminent domain
taking) for $8,325,000. The taking will result in the acquisition of the entire Parcel of Land.
Process
If the City chooses to move forward with the eminent domain taking and purchase of the Premises, then
funds need to be transferred to the appropriate budget and the taking of the Parcel needs to be completed.

Packet Pg. 3

1.1

The City intends to acquire the Parcel through what is commonly referred to as a “friendly taking.” A
friendly taking describes the use of the statutory eminent domain procedure to acquire a property that an
owner seeks to sell to the City. An appraisal of the Parcel of Land, conducted by LPC Commercial
Services, Inc., has determined that the fair market value of the Parcel at its highest and best use is
$8,000,000. The City’s Chief Assessor, Gayle Willett, has reviewed LPC Commercial Services, Inc.’s
appraisal as an additional examination to ensure that the appraised value represents the current fair market
value of the property. For the Parcel of Land, the City would pay the amount allowed by law as a pro
tanto to 41 Bellis Circle LLC. A pro tanto is an initial payment that the property owner can accept
without prejudice to its right to bring a claim for the full amount of damages that it asserts is due. Here,
the pro tanto would be a payment of $3,676,500. In addition, under the law, the property owner has the
right to challenge the amount of the pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could seek to persuade a
court that it is entitled to the current fair market value of the property. The eminent domain procedure
allows the City to exceed the limits that G.L. c. 40, §14 and G.L. c.43, §30 impose on the purchase price
of a property (which limit the purchase price that the City may pay to the average of the three prior years’
assessed value plus a 25% increase) after an owner of land taken by eminent domain has sought damages
for the remainder of the fair market value or purchase price of the property. The City intends, subject to
the City Council's approval, to pay the remainder of the agreed upon purchase price of $8,325,000 which
includes carrying costs for 41 Bellis Circle, LLC., through the settlement of the 41 Bellis Circle LLC's
eminent domain damages claim.
The following steps must be taken to satisfy legal requirements for this friendly taking:
1.
2.
3.

The City Council must vote to approve a transfer of funds into the appropriate budget code in
order to pay the pro tanto for the Cambridge Parcel, as set forth above and below;
The City Council, by a two-thirds vote, must vote to approve the Order of Taking;
The City Council must vote to approve a transfer of funds into the appropriate budget code in
order to settle the eminent domain damages claim and to pay the remainder of the purchase
price of $8,325,000 which includes carrying costs for 41 Bellis Circle, LLC.

Requests for Transfer of Funds
I am hereby requesting a transfer in the amount of $3,676,500 from the General Fund Department of
Public Works Salary and Wages account to the General Fund Law Department Travel and Training
account (Judgement and Damages) to cover the pro tanto payment toward the expenses of acquisition as
required by the above referenced Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws for the Parcel of
Land owned by 41 Bellis Circle LLC. Once the City’s Free Cash amount is certified by the state, I
anticipate submitting a recommendation to the City Council for a Free Cash appropriation to the
Department of Public Works Salary and Wages account to cover this transfer.
After the City Council votes on the Transfer Order to fund the pro tanto payment and votes by a two-third
vote on the Order of Taking, I am also hereby requesting that the City Council vote to approve a second
transfer, in the amount of $4,648,500, from the General Fund Department of Public Works Salary and
Wages account to the General Fund Law Department Travel and Training account (Judgement and
Damages) in order to pay for the settlement of 41 Bellis Circle LLC’s remaining eminent domain claim.
Once the City’s Free Cash amount is certified by the state, I anticipate submitting a recommendation to
the City Council for a Free Cash appropriation to the Department of Public Works Salary and Wages
account to cover this transfer.

I strongly recommend that the City Council approve this unique opportunity to acquire the Parcel of Land
and vote to approve the Orders of Taking and Purchase and for the transfer of funds.
Very truly yours,
