Each Council member will be asked to nominate three individuals to the Screening
Committee, two of whom shall ultimately be appointed by the Chair and the Director
of the Personnel Department; the Chair shall appoint three individuals, for a total
of 19 members serving on the Screening Committee. People will also be allowed to
make their interest in serving on this committee known via a special email address
to be established for this purpose (results shall be forwarded to the Director of the
Personnel Department and shared with the Government Operations Chair). As a
guide for the types of community voices that are ideally being sought for this
Screening Committee, the Councilors are asked to refer to the criteria and
instructions that is based upon what was used during the 2016 City Manager
Search process:
As we anticipate great interest in our City Manager position, we are assembling a 19member Screening Committee, facilitated by our consultant, to screen resumes and
conduct preliminary interviews with the highest-qualified candidates. The Screening
Committee will determine who from this candidate pool will be the finalists to be presented
to the City Council for their consideration.

Criteria for Preliminary Screening Committee Membership:
Committee members will be selected by their ability to represent one or more of the
identified constituency groups. The goal is to select a broadly representative and
diverse group of committed participants. Experience with executive recruitment is highly
desirable.
Availability is a key criteria. Participants must commit to each of the following
three (3) predetermined days. Day one will be XX for participant training. The group
will convene again for two consecutive days on XX and XX to conduct candidate
interviews. Meals will be provided. The Cambridge location for the training and
interviews has yet to be determined.
This phase of the City Manager hiring process is strictly confidential and as a result all
Screening Committee participants will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement.
How to become a member of the Preliminary Screening Committee:
Applicants must be nominated by a member of the City Council, and they can also
make their interest in serving known by sending an email to XXXXX@cambridgma.gov
by XXX, 2021. These emails will forward to the Director of the Personnel Department
and be shared with the Government Operations Chair.
We appreciate your interest and extend our gratitude for your support of this search
process. Community involvement and participation like yours is critical to selecting the
right and best new City Manager for our great city.

PROPOSED SCOPE OF WORK FOR CONSULTANT-LED CITY MANAGER SEARCH
Guiding Principle: It is the consensus of the Government Operations Committee that this process
should strive to attract the strongest, most diverse pool of candidates possible. Women and
minority candidates, as well as those who may come from “non-traditional” backgrounds (i.e.,
those who have executive experience but who may have not previously served in municipal
leadership roles), should be aggressively targeted in this search process.
We know from the City Manager Search conducted in 2016 that the typical recruitment and
selection process with one consultant can take 175 hours to conduct. At least 50 hours of this time
is “administrative,” including add placement, acknowledgement of resumes, references,
interviews, and due diligence on candidates.
The Government Operations Committee should be kept informed throughout the recruitment
process, and the consultants should ensure their availability to provide information and answer
questions, and details of the process, such as placement of advertising, and applications received
or discussed, in regular updates via either telephone or email.
The Chair of the Government Operations Committee proposes a Six Phase, Consultant-led
City Manager Search, based largely upon the model that was utilized during the 2016 search:
Phase I – Position assessment, position announcement and brochure development
Phase I will include the following steps:
•

Consultant interviews with the members of the City Council, the personnel director, and
the City's senior staff, as well as with any other individuals deemed appropriate to best
understand the responsibilities, challenges, and culture of the city.

•

Consultant creates a recruitment-related communications plan, including the use of social
media as a tool to engage the community in the recruitment process. For example, a
survey should be developed by the consultants and made available on the City's website
for residents and other stakeholders to weigh in with their thoughts on the qualifications
and background of the next city manager.

•

Consultant shall plan and execute two facilitated sessions, 2 – 3 hours per session of 15 –
20 community leaders; elected officials will suggest leaders from the business
community, school districts, faith community, nonprofit community, and other
organizations that can provide feedback and thoughts on the qualifications and
experiences the next city manager should have. This can be more than 15 – 20 individuals
and can be expanded to include a wider range of stakeholder groups.

•

Consultant shall plan and execute a robust public engagement process, such as, but not
limited to, town hall style public meetings (1.5 - 3 hours). All residents would be invited
to participate in a discussion of what they would like to see in their next city manager.
This discussion would be facilitated by the consultants. This public engagement should

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Proposed Template of Consultant-Led City Manager Search (For Aug 4, 2021 Hearing) (14524 : A communication was received

1.c

strive to ensure diverse community representation, and targeted outreach into the City’s
diverse ethnic, geographic, and socio-economic populations.
•

Consultant shall create a dedicated email for the recruitment to solicit feedback.

•

Consultant shall provide advice on incorporation of public input into recruitment
materials and process

•

Consultant shall create a stakeholder engagement report for use by the City Council and
the incoming city manager. Documenting findings, recommendations, and expectations
from the participants in the citizen engagement efforts to facilitate continued partnership
between the City and community.

•

The result of the interviews with the elected officials, staff, and community would be the
development of a Position Announcement, Recruitment Brochure, and agreement on a
detailed Recruitment Timetable.

•

There shall be a Screening Committee for City Manager Applicants, the composition of
which should be representative of the community's citizen demographics, including
community/civic leadership persons, neighborhood associations, public interest groups,
etc. For information on how this Screening Committee will be formed, see the separate
“Establishing the Screening Committee” document.

Phase II – Advertising, Candidate Recruitment, and Outreach
Phase II will include the following steps:
•

Consultant shall place the position announcement in appropriate professional online
publications, including International City and County Management Association, National
Forum for Black Public Administrators, the International Hispanic Network, and other
websites where potential candidates might look for career opportunities. In addition to
public sector publications and websites, outreach should include LinkedIn and other
private sector resources.

•

Consultant shall develop a database of potential candidates unique to the position and to
the City of Cambridge, focusing on the leadership and management skills identified in
Phase I, as well as size of organization and experience in addressing challenges and
opportunities also outlined in Phase I. Consultant will identify candidates by community
size and geographic location, along with other factors deemed relevant by the Screening
Committee.

•

Consultant shall conduct outreach to potential candidates through email and telephone
contacts as appropriate.

PHASE III – Candidate Evaluation and Screening
Phase III will include the following steps:
•

Consultant shall review and evaluate candidates’ credentials, considering the criteria
outlined in the Recruitment Brochure.

•

Consultant shall interview the most highly qualified candidates by Zoom or FaceTime to
fully grasp their qualifications and experience, as well as their interpersonal skills. This is
an hour-long interview, asking specific questions about their experience and skill set.
This allows consultant to ask follow-up questions and probe specific areas. It also
provides a sense of their verbal skills and their level of energy for, and interest in, the
position.

•

Formal and informal references (two per candidate of those deemed “highly qualified”)
and an Internet search of each candidate will be conducted by the consultant to further
verify candidates’ abilities, work ethic, management and leadership skills, analytical
skills, interpersonal skills, ability to interact with the media, and any areas identified for
improvement.

•

All resumes will be acknowledged, and contacts and inquiries from candidates will be
personally handled by the consultant, ensuring Cambridge’s process is professional and
well regarded by all who participate.

Phase IV – Presentation of Recommended Candidates
Phase IV will include the following steps:
•

Consultant will prepare a Recruitment Report that presents the credentials of those
candidates most qualified for the position. A binder which contains the candidate’s cover
letter and resume shall be prepared, along with a “mini” resume for each candidate, so
that each candidate's credentials are presented in a uniform way.

•

Consultant will provide the Screening Committee with a log of all candidates who
applied, and all resumes can be reviewed if so desired.

•

Consultant will meet with the Screening Committee to review the Recruitment Report
and expand upon the information provided. The report will arrive two to three days in
advance of the meeting, giving the Search Committee the opportunity to fully review it.
In addition to the written report, the consultant will spend two to three hours with the
Search Committee to bring the candidates to “life” by reviewing the telephone interview
and providing excerpts from two (2) references they will have done on the individual.

Phase V – Interviewing Process
Phase V will include the following steps:
•

At the Recommendation Meeting, the interviewing process will be finalized, including
the discussion of any specific components the Screening Committee deems appropriate.

•

Consultant will develop interview questions for the review. Consultant will provide the
Screening Committee with interview books that consist of the Recruitment Report, the
credentials each candidate submits, a summary of each candidate's credentials, a set of
questions with room for interviewers to make notes, and an evaluation sheet to assist
interviewers in assessing each candidate's skills and abilities.

•

The Screening Committee will conduct an interview of the 8-10 selected priority
candidates, from which they shall select 4-5 Finalists for presentation to the City Council

•

Once candidates for interview are selected, additional references will be contacted, along
with verification of educational credentials, Criminal Court, credit, and motor vehicle and
record checks. Using the candidate’s name and work experience, consultant will review
the top 200 search results available from Google, as well his/her activity (if publicly
available) on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. Employment
verification may also be requested.

•

It is recommended that the Finalist interviews by the City Council be a two-step
interviewing process beginning with four to five candidates interviewed in the first round.
Following this round, two or three candidates will be selected for second round
interviews. Again, consultant will prepare a second round of interview questions and an
“Evaluation Sheet.”

•

Consultant would offer a community “Meet and Greet” option as a means for the
community to interact with and get to know the second-round finalists in an informal
setting. At this “Meet and Greet,” finalists would give a brief overview of themselves and
answer questions from the audience. Consultant will also work with the Human Resource
Department to coordinate a tour of City of Cambridge facilities, and interviews with
department heads and elected officials.

•

Consultants will be present for all of the interviews, serving as a resource and facilitator.

Phase VI – Appointment of Candidate
•

Consultant will assist the City Council as much as requested with the salary and benefit
negotiations and drafting of the employment agreement, if appropriate.

•

Consultant will notify all applicants of the final appointment, including professional
background information on the successful candidate.

Recruitment Schedule
A detailed recruitment schedule should be provided to the Government Operations Committee in
Phase I, and this committee should receive regular reports from the Consultant and monitor the
timetable to ensure any approvals that may be needed are granted. The recruitment and selection
process should be expected to take between 18 – 20 weeks from the time the contract is signed
until the candidate is appointed. Consultant should be prepared to work with the City on a shorter
process, if that is desired.
The overall process should strive to achieve the following milestones and deliverables:
(Weeks 1-4) On-site interviews of Cambridge officials and staff, development and approval of
recruitment brochure.
Deliverables: Recruitment Brochure.
(Weeks 4-9) Placement of professional announcements, candidate identification, screening,
interview and evaluation by consultant.
(Weeks 9-12) Consultant recommendation to Preliminary Screening Committee of qualified
candidates. Screening Committee conducts interviews in this period.
Deliverable: Recruitment Report.
(Week 13-15) Selection of candidate finalists by for Council; additional background and
reference checks, report preparation and presentation.
Deliverable: interview reports, including suggested questions and evaluation
sheets.
(Weeks 16-18) Interviews of selected finalist candidates; Council selection of final candidate;

negotiation, offer, acceptance and appointment.

The City Manager search process should allow sufficient time for stakeholder input, recruitment,
preliminary candidate reviews, discussions with the Screening Committee, interviews by the
Screening Committee, the decision and then presentation of the finalists to the City Council, two
rounds of Council interviews, the meet and greets, city tours, and the final decision of the City
Council.
