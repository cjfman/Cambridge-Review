IN CITY COUNCIL
June 23, 2021
I am pleased to transmit the first report due under the Cycling Safety Ordinance (Chapter 12.22
of the Cambridge Municipal Code
<https://library.municode.com/ma/cambridge/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT12STSIPU
PL_CH12.22CYSAOR>), which analyzes the block-by-block impacts of installing quick-build
separated bike lanes on four specific segments of Massachusetts Avenue, as identified in Section
12.22.040 (E) of the ordinance.
Subsequent to this report, City staff will work to determine whether we consider installing quickbuild separated bicycle lanes along any of those blocks to be feasible, or whether construction is
required in any or all of those blocks. As a result, the attached analysis is focused on describing
and characterizing the positive and negative impacts of installing quick-build separated bicycle
lanes in the identified blocks, without yet making specific judgments on the feasibility or
desirability of moving forward with installing quick-build separated bicycle lanes in these areas.
I am attaching a PDF with the content of the report, but please note that this document is best
viewed online, and has been designed so as to make it easily viewable on mobile devices such as
a cell phone:

We look forward to continuing our work with the City Council, along with Cambridge residents,
businesses, and institutions, to improve bicycle safety throughout Cambridge.

• Per the Ordinance, we must install
separated bike lanes
it is an
evaluation of what the impacts
would be if quick-build (paint and
post) separated bike lanes were
installed without any construction
• Construction takes more time
than quick-build, but may reduce
the impacts of installing separated
bike lanes
•

4 | Transportation and Public Utilities Committee Meeting | June 2021

• The information in the report can
help guide and inform
conversations around whether we
should move forward with quickbuild separated bike lanes or seek
Council approval for construction
• We will consult with the
community and consider the
needs of all stakeholders before
making decisions about how to
install separated bike lanes

• Locations on Mass Ave that have
complicating factors (i.e., the two
major bus stops in Harvard
Square and the sections with
overhead catenary wires for
electric buses), including:
• Dudley St to Beech St (A)
• Roseland St to Waterhouse St (B)
• Garden St to Church St, northbound
(this segment is Peabody St) (C)
• Dunster St to Plympton St (D)

• While this report is not a plan for the corridor, we could not
evaluate impacts without making high-level assumptions
about conceptual layouts for quick-build separated bike lanes
• In areas with catenary wires:

• Primary design includes a separated bike lane and two general travel lanes
• We considered two alternatives:
• Alternative A: Provides a parking lane instead of a second travel lane
• Alternative B: Provides a peak-hour bus lane and off-peak loading instead of a
second travel lane
• Looking at impacts, it became clear that these designs are unworkable when
accounting for public safety

• Average control delay – the
average amount of time a
vehicle is delayed
• Queue – length of the line of
stopped vehicles. 50th
percentile / 95th percentile

• Without bus lanes, delays and
queues are expected to
impact buses at the same
level as other vehicles

our ability to create a corridor that
addresses the needs of all modes

• Construction on City-owned
infrastructure alone (streets,

catenary issues
• More analysis needed to determine if this
type of construction would lessen the
impacts of installing separated bike lanes
• Any potential construction would need to
be scoped before moving forward

• We have studied locations of delay • Locations where delay and
and unreliability for bus riders
unreliability are significant are:
• From research, reliability is equally as
important as fast travel times
• Given Cambridge’s street network,
these locations of delay and
unreliability are not likely to change as
travel demand reemerges

• With this information, the City can
identify places to consider bus
priority - dedicated lanes or transit

Our working group’s commitments: Encourage the city to develop
a design for Mass Ave that:
•

•
•
•

Promotes a vibrant and thriving business area design
that draws shoppers, diners, and other customers to the
area to experience the variety of offerings
Solves the urgent bicycle safety problem on Mass Ave
Improves reliability and speed for bus riders
Creates a safe and friendly pedestrian experience
throughout

The design must be developed contextually, block-by-block,
and in close coordination with the community.

Need for parking and loading
(Jeanne Oster, Owner, Guitar Stop, 1760 Mass Ave)
Independent local businesses
are key to our community!
Customer parking, as well as
loading zones, must be
addressed and not
eliminated.
Our businesses face many
challenges and the city’s plan
should not pit one group
against the other, nor
condemn them to fail.
We all have serious needs
that can and must be
addressed!

section in the immediate vicinity of a crosswalk, where islands are

2. Use side streets for commercial uses during business
hours.
3. Provide more crosswalks and raised crosswalks to
slow traffic.
4. Integrate community art

maintaining it in others
