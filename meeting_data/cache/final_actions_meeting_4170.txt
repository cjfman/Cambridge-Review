COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

Over 100 million animals are killed annually for their fur; and

WHEREAS:

These animals are bred and confined and forced to live in cramped, wire bottom cages
and deprived of the ability to engage in natural behaviors; and

WHEREAS:

Egregious animal cruelty is the norm in the fur industry. Animals are killed in
inhumane ways such as crude gassing or anal electrocution; and

WHEREAS:

There are no federal laws or animal welfare standards to protect animals on fur
farms leading to immense suffering; and

WHEREAS:

The fur trade poses serious risks to public health, for example, in wildlife markets in
China, foxes and raccoon dogs were found to have been infected with the SARS
coronaviruses and on US and European fur farms, mink tested positive for the virus
that causes COVID19, resulting in the death of over 5 million mink and the Dutch
government said it is “very likely” that the farmed mink spread the virus to humans;
and

WHEREAS:

The fur industry also poses serious environmental threats. On fur farms, waste runoff
from animals pollutes the soil and waterways and the tanning and dying process uses
toxic and carcinogenic chemicals like chromium and formaldehyde to prevent the skin
from decaying; and

WHEREAS:

Banning fur sales eliminates the demand for cruel products and ensures that humane
minded consumers can shop with confidence; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge, currently does not have stores that sell fur, but nothing in our municipal
code would prevent fur shops or sales; and

WHEREAS:

Communities in Massachusetts including, Plymouth, Brookline, Weston,
and Wellesley have passed local ordinances to prevent this cruel industry from
operating in their municipalities; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council meet to amend the
Cambridge Municipal Code by adding a chapter numbered 6.24, titled Sale of Fur
Apparel Products.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE That the
Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is hereby amended by adding a
chapter, to be numbered Chapter 6.24, which said Chapter reads as follows:

6.24.010 – Council Findings
(a) The City Council finds that animals that are slaughtered for their fur endure
tremendous suffering. Animals raised on fur farms typically spend their entire lives in
cramped and filthy cages. Fur farmers typically use the cheapest killing methods available,
including suffocation, electrocution, gas and poison.
(b) The City Council finds that fur farms are reservoirs and transmission vectors for
dangerous zoonotic diseases, including SARS coronaviruses, that threaten public health,
including in the City of Cambridge. COVID-19 infections have been confirmed at fur farms
in Europe and the United States, and scientific studies have linked mink, raccoon dogs, and
foxes – the animals most commonly farmed for their fur – to a variety of coronaviruses.
(c) The City Council finds that the fur production process is energy intensive and has a
significant environmental impact, including air and water pollution. Runoff from the fur
production process contains high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen, which are the
most common forms of water pollution in the United States. In addition, the tanning and
dying processes used in fur production use toxic chemicals and heavy metals like chromium
and formaldehyde.
(b) Considering the wide array of alternatives for fashion and apparel, the City Council
finds that the demand for fur products does not justify the unnecessary killing and cruel
treatment of animals, harm to the environment, and the public health risks to the people of
the City of Cambridge caused by these practices.
(c) The City Council believes that eliminating the sale of fur products in the City of
Cambridge will decrease demand for these cruel and environmentally harmful products and
promote community awareness of animal welfare and, in turn, will foster a more humane
environment in the City of Cambridge and enhance the reputation of the City.
6.24.020 - Definitions
The following definitions shall apply in this section:
(a) Fur shall mean any animal skin or part thereof with hair, fleece, or fur fibers
attached thereto, either in its raw or processed state.
(b) Fur product shall mean any article of clothing or covering for any part of the body, or
any fashion accessory, including but not limited to handbags, shoes, slippers, hats,
earmuffs, scarves, shawls, gloves, jewelry, keychains, toys or trinkets, and home accessories
and décor, that is made in whole or part of fur. “Fur product” does not include any of the
following:
