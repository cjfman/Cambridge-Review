What are Overdose Prevention Sites?
• Previously referred to as Safe Consumption Sites or Safe
Injection Sites
• Harm reduction centers that offer a variety of services,
including space for people to use pre-obtained substances
under the supervision of a medical professional or trained,
peer support worker

Packet Pg. 4

Research
• Overdose Prevention Sites have been in existence for over 30
years in over 11 countries around the world
• OPS have been subject to numerous studies that show that
OPS save lives, reduce medical costs, and do not lead to
concerns such as increased drug use in neighborhoods,
increased crime or being “gateways” to drug use

What are overdose prevention centers (OPCs)?
● Overdose prevention centers (OPCs) are places where people who use drugs
can use pre-obtained substances under the supervision of trained medical
and/or peer staff
● Clients can access wrap around medical and social support services, including
referrals to treatment programs
● There are approximately 200 OPCs operating in 12 countries using a range of
models (e.g., mobile, medical, peer-operated)
● Operate under a range of names, including: supervised consumption sites,
harm reduction centers, and drug consumption rooms

OPC operational models
Integrated sites:
● Most common OPC operational model
● OPCs are situated within an existing facility (e.g., a syringe exchange program,
community health center) or network of services that provide health and social
supports to people who use drugs as well as people who do not use drugs

e.g: counselling, housing case workers, basic medical services,
food provision, and other harm reduction services

OPC operational models
Stand-alone sites:
● Stand-alone OPCs are distinct facilities whose primary focus is on
supervised consumption within a sterile and non-judgemental
environment.

Embedded sites:
● Embedded SCS are located within existing services and care
systems that do not typically allow non-medical drug use, such as
hospitals, shelters, and supportive housing facilities.

Somerville needs assessment
Conducted to:
1. Determine conditions under which an OPC would
be used or deemed suitable for use by PWUD
2. Determine feasibility of an OPC in Somerville (e.g.,
operational model, location, etc.)
3. Identify concerns, challenges, and barriers that may
be associated with opening an OPC in Somerville

Recommendations based on Somerville needs assessment
1.

Somerville would benefit from at least one OPC that includes supervised consumption, as
well as a range of harm reduction, health, and social services.

1.

People who use drugs should be meaningfully included throughout the planning, design,
and implementation processes of an OPC.

2. The City should use a transparent, community-engaged process that includes a range of
diverse stakeholders in the planning and implementation of an OPC.

Suggestions for moving forward
1. Open dialogue between potential OPC operators and the City
2. Legislative or City-sanctioned route
a.

Public education on OPCs tailored to various audiences

3. Secure funding so an OPC is sustainable (e.g., via opioid settlement funds)
