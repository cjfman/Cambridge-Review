Action Steps

Building canopy is a slow and steady race, but we are
seeing substantive progress. The investments in tree
plantings and maintenance combined with tree
preservation initiatives are reversing the loss of tree
canopy. The city is committed to building on this
work and continuing to implement the
recommendations of the UFMP.

Protection Ordinance to cover the removal of Significant
Trees, defined as 6 inches in diameter, and Exceptional Trees,
defined as 30” in diameter, on private property.
• Permits are required to remove a Significant Tree on private
property and mitigation is required to help offset canopy
loss.
• Mitigation can be replanting, payment into the Tree Fund or
a combination of both.

Action Plan

There are many competing interests / uses for our public right-of-way and creating
spaces for more trees can be challenging. But space for trees is a key consideration in all
capital projects. Some great recent examples include:

Large capital project in the Port that will include reconstructing many streets and
sidewalks. Many of which are very narrow and make it challenging to plant trees and
provide accessible sidewalks. Through the community design process, shared streets are
being considered. Shared streets create a slow speed environment where people
walking, biking and driving can share the road. This can provide more space for people
walking, trees and other plantings.

August to water trees from 7 am to 3 pm. (this summer there was only two interns).
Using bicycles, the interns access fire hydrants to water trees throughout the city.
• We continue to promote and encourage residents to join our Forest Friends Program and
water trees adjacent to their residences, which remains the most effective and efficient
watering program we have.

SUPPORTING BIODIVERSITY
AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE
WITH NATIVE PLANTS AND TREES
Biodiversity is the variety of species that evolved
together in a region. Their interdependent
relationships create a functioning, viable ecosystem.

Native Plants in Cambridge:
Support Biodiversity and
Address Climate Change

● Climate change and biodiversity loss are equal threats to human
existence
● One million animal and plant species now face extinction, many within
decades
● In the US 34% of plant species, 40% of animal species, and 41% of
ecosystems are at risk of extinction https://www.natureserve.org/bif
● Biodiversity, which supports all systems of life on earth
is declining faster than at any time in human history.
● 2022 report: 400,000 human deaths occurring annually from a reduction
in available fresh food because of the diminishing numbers of pollinators
● Without biodiversity, our food systems will collapse

From the latest UN climate and biodiversity reports

a

● Most of our food plants are pollinated by insects
● 90% of insects can feed only on limited species of native plants
● 95% of songbirds and many other species eat the insects that eat
native plants
● Native plants and trees are essential to the life cycle of insects,
birds and many other species. These species cannot survive
without native plants and trees.

To address both climate change and biodiversity loss,
native trees must be planted

Native Trees
Native oak trees support over 500 species of
insects, birds and mammals.

Ginkgo trees, native to China, support 1
species in the US. They have been here
almost 240 years

Red maple, a hardy resilient street tree,
supports 300 insect species which produce
thousands of caterpillars: essential food for
baby birds. (One nest of chickadees eats
6000-9000 caterpillars. The birds starve with
less than 70% native trees in the area.)

Norway maple is native to Europe and Asia
where it supports many species. In the US it
supports very few, and is an invasive species
crowding out native plants. Caterpillars,
essential food for birds, avoid the waxy leaves.

Native plants and trees on average support
13 x more insect species than non natives

Non native plants and trees on average
support 0 - 5 insect species

●

Amend the Urban Forest Master Plan so it:
○ Includes biodiversity support as a goal
○ Prioritizes the use of native trees, using cultivars only if the
straight species are not available in nurseries.
○ Does not equate native trees with non natives of the same
genus, when accounting for canopy diversity. Non natives do
not contribute to the ecosystem and should not be counted.

● Act on our commitment to a healthy tree canopy by funding and
staffing the planting program so that new plantings are reliably
watered for the first three years, then during periods of drought.

Street Tree Planting
Strategies
• Typical root zones for trees are broad and shallow
• Majority of roots are in the top 18” of soil and will
extend 2 to 3 times beyond the drip line
• Mulching around the critical root area (drip line) is
important, but trees need water access across the
entire root area

Action step: Galvanize the community to take action

Recommendations for increasing outreach to Cambridge residents
 Develop monthly Urban Forest email newsletter, modeled after
Recycling newsletter (and other city newsletters), with:
– Citizen care tips – for example:
• it’s April, trees and shrubs need regular watering starting now
• How to adopt a tree, become a Forest Friend

– Updates on Urban Forest – for example:
• City is planting 500 trees on public land this spring
• 4 new ebikes for the bike public watering crew

– Links to Cambridge tree and plant programs
• Discounted rain barrels, free compost
• Report a city tree in trouble, request an arborist
assessment

– Want to learn more?
• Upcoming talk at the Cambridge Public Library
• Native plant seedling sale at CRLS
