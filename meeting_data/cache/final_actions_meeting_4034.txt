RE:

Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance – Proposed Amendments

SANDRA CLARKE
Deputy Director
Chief of Administration

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Please find attached proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance. The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
adopted in 2014 and requires energy and water reporting from commercial
properties over 25,000 square feet and residential properties over 50 units. This
regulates approximately 1,100 buildings in Cambridge which are responsible for
approximately 75% of the building sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The ordinance has successfully increased transparency and awareness of energy
and water consumption by the regulated buildings. BEUDO includes a provision
requiring that the Community Development Department review the impact of the
ordinance on energy performance of covered properties, and recommend
amendments to improve building energy performance if it has not improved
significantly. Analysis performed in 2018 concluded that energy performance of
covered properties had not improved significantly and therefore CDD initiated a
performance requirement policy development process with participation of over
35 unique entities, representing private commercial and residential building
owners, universities, affordable housing providers, and green building
professionals. The attached proposal is the result of this collaborative process.
These proposed BEUDO amendments are intended to introduce GHG
performance requirements for BEUDO properties and achieve science-based
GHG reductions consistent with other leading cities including Boston, New York,
and Washington D.C. The performance requirements:
•

344 Broadway
Cambridge, MA 02139
Voice: 617 349-4600
Fax: 617 349-4669
TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

Eliminate GHG emissions from regulated properties by 2050, with the
following intermediate targets compared to an individual 2018-2019
baseline for most buildings:
o 20% by 2025
o 40% by 2030

o 60% by 2035
o 80% by 2040
o 90% by 2045
•

Provide multiple compliance pathways including energy efficiency
improvements, electrification, on-site renewable energy, off-site
renewable energy, electricity grid improvements, and alternative
compliance payments.

•

Provide flexibility including an optional early baseline to account for early
action, alternative compliance timeframes for laboratories and affordable
housing, and portfolio level compliance for campus owners and affordable
housing.

•

Leverage technical support and access to state and federal financial
incentives through the existing Building Energy Retrofit Program.

The attached proposal for amendments to BEUDO represents an essential step in
Cambridge’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. The Net Zero Action Plan
adopted in 2015 and updated in 2021 identifies BEUDO performance
requirements as an integral part of a comprehensive suite of actions which
together will phase out GHG emissions from new buildings, many existing
buildings, and much of the energy supply system in Cambridge. This Plan has
been created and updated by a Net Zero Task Force representing stakeholders
throughout the community and is being overseen by the Climate Protection
Advisory Committee. Both stakeholder groups have urged the prompt
advancement of strong BEUDO performance requirements.
We are pleased to present these amendments to move forward the discussion of
emission reductions from the largest buildings in Cambridge based on a
comprehensive and collaborative stakeholder engagement process.

greenhouse gas emissions. Campus Owners must determine their Baseline
according to the method by which they intend to comply with the requirements.
Owners may request to adjust their Baseline to include in the aggregate Campus
any new buildings that receive their Certificate of Occupancy after the start of the
Baseline years.
(ii) If the Covered Property that is part of a Campus is included in an institutional
comprehensive plan and a corresponding energy management plan, and these
plans have reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions from buildings at the institutional
level by the required amount for that compliance period, then the Covered
Property shall be considered to be in compliance. To show compliance with this
pathway, the Owner must provide copies of the institutional comprehensive plan,
institutional energy management plan, and the completed institution-wide
greenhouse gas inventory for buildings for the compliance period.
(b) Laboratories and Affordable Housing:
(i) Laboratories and Affordable Housing shall have the option to comply with the
following alternative compliance schedule:
1. Compliance Period 1: 2027 to 2033; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 66.7% of the default Baseline
2. Compliance Period 2: 2034 to 2040; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 33.3% of the default Baseline
3. Compliance Period 3: 2041 to 2049; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 16.6% of the default Baseline
4. Compliance Period 4: 2050 onwards; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions are
net zero.
(ii) Laboratory and Affordable Housing owners choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit documentation to the Department showing
that the Covered Property qualifies as a Laboratory or Affordable Housing at the
start of each 5-year compliance period.
(iii) Laboratories and Affordable Housing choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan to
the Department four years prior to the start of each alternative compliance
period detailing how the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirement for
that compliance cycle will be met.
(iv) For newly constructed Laboratories and Affordable Housing that choose to follow
the alternative compliance schedule and receive an initial Certificate of
Occupancy after the start of the default Baseline years, the Baseline shall be the
average Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the first two full calendar years following
the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. Such Laboratories and Affordable
Housing shall be exempt from the requirements of 8.67.100 for the seven years
following the conclusion of this Baseline period. The performance requirements
for each subsequent seven-year period shall be determined by a linear reduction
to net zero emissions by 2050.

Key Components
• Performance requirement of reducing GHGs relative to individual baseline,
in 5-year increments, on a path to net zero by 2050
• Buildings can pick from onsite reductions (energy efficiency, solar,
electrification); new offsite renewable energy; or Alternative Compliance
Credits
• Default baseline is 2018-2019 average, but option to pick an early baseline
with adjusted reduction requirements
• Specific pathway options for affordable housing, labs, and campuses
• Exemptions for net zero buildings and financial distress
• Periodic policy review and adjustment

Principles & Considerations
• BEUDO owner feedback indicated preference
for GHG-based targets (vs. energy) to align
with desired outcomes and increase
compliance flexibility
• Targets are based on scientific analysis by the
IPCC
• Targets are relative to each building’s
baseline to recognize the unique situation of
each building (vs. universal targets by
building type)

Calculating GHG Emissions
Policy Element
GHG (MTCO2e) = Sum (energy x emission factor)
- Alternative Compliance Credits
Provided that any Renewable Electricity is subtracted
from electricity use.

Principles & Considerations
• Greenhouse gas
emission calculation
should reflect regional
conditions, provide
predictability, and
encompass off-site
measures taken by the
owner
•

The City will provide
buildings with this
annual calculation for
reference.

Packet Pg. 48

Attachment: CDD BEUDO Overview Presentation for Health and Envi 12-22-21 (COF 2021

a

Emission Factors

• The City will publish emission factors in advance for each upcoming
compliance period, through regulations
• Onsite fuels (gas, oil, etc.): standard scientific values
• Steam: use Massachusetts-published emission factor for purchased
steam; use WRI-WBSCD methodology for owner-operated cogen plant
• Electricity: emission factor based on Massachusetts’ calculations and
projections of emissions from Massachusetts electricity use

• Key principles: reflects that the Massachusetts grid is getting
cleaner and lets owners use this as a reduction measure, while also
providing owners certainty and predictability on emissions

Renewable Energy Criteria

Specific criteria, as identified through Offsite RE stakeholder process:
• Offsite Renewable Electricity (RE) procurement supports a new RE project
•

Includes contracts that lead to new project or expansion of existing facility

• RECs must be assigned to the building for the duration of the contract
• RE is solar PV, solar thermal power, wind, geothermal, hydro, or others as
approved

Alternative Compliance Credits

• Creates an additional option to comply with performance
requirements
• Price is aligned with Boston at $234/credit in first compliance
period, adjusted thereafter
• One credit = one ton of CO2
• Based on average cost of abating one ton in large buildings

• Supports City programs and projects to reduce carbon,
including in affordable housing

Early Baseline Option

• Goal is to provide an option for owners who have taken early
action
• Optional baseline is average of two consecutive years, as far
back as 2010:
• Reduction trajectory will align with IPCC path: 50% reduction from
2010 to 2030, and net zero by 2050
• Similar trajectory to average BEUDO building’s reductions to date
• Parallels Boston’s approach for early baseline

•
•

Boston’s “BERDO 2.0” Performance Standards were adopted in September
The ordinance establishes emissions standards of GHG intensity for each of
13 different sectors, declining every 5 years. Buildings may also choose an
Individual Compliance Schedule.
•
•
•

•

Building categories established through data review and advisory group input
Portfolios have the option to comply in the aggregate

Baseline and Expected Reductions

•

•

Boston BERDO 2.0
Boston thresholds are designed to •
achieve a 50% reduction in GHG
emissions (for the covered
buildings) by 2030 from 2005
The Individual Compliance
Schedule can use a baseline of
2005 or later and must achieve a
50% reduction by 2030
•

Cambridge BEUDERO Proposal
BEUDERO proposal requires a
default 40% reduction by 2030,
but if a baseline of 2010-2011 is
chosen, the reduction must be
50% by 2030
•

Reductions are prorated
accordingly for interim baseline
years

Given the trend of declining
emissions (observed in available
BEUDO data), Cambridge proposal
is likely more stringent in requiring
a 50% reduction from 2010 by
2030

Potential Approach to Thresholds
•

Process that Boston used:
•
•
•
•
•

•

Worked with technical consultant and advisory group
Identified 13 locally appropriate typologies, using Portfolio Manager and
analysis of existing emissions intensity
Analyzed other factors to see if building age, etc. should be a determinant of
thresholds
Developed thresholds with stakeholders to reach 2030 targets as a whole and
affect different sectors equitably
Developed individual pathway and recalibrated thresholds

Potential approach for Cambridge:
•
•
•
•

Would require procuring consultant support
Stakeholder process to identify appropriate typologies (or need to justify
same groupings as Boston)
Develop reduction thresholds that are either Cambridge-specific or Bostonaligned
Process could be 6-9 months (est.)

not ready to build these buildings net zero at the time, and they sank the amendment
that would have required them to. With BEUDERO, these buildings will have to

Under BEUDERO as proposed, buildings only have to pay for “excess” emissions.
This graph shows what is meant by “excess” emissions, which the existing building
will need to pay for, shown here in red. As long as their emissions are at or below the
prescribed pathway to zero, they can continue to pollute at no cost. In fact, by buying
renewable electricity they could potentially defer eliminating fossil fuel combustion for
years while still complying with BEUDERO and avoiding Alternative Compliance
Payments.
It’s outrageous that we would allow existing buildings to pollute for free until 2050, but
it it is even more unthinkably outrageous that we would allow NEW commercial
buildings to pollute for free! We know better and we should legislate better!

Council goal of 100% renewable energy by 2035 was adopted in 2017, and
reaffirmed on Dec 13, 2021
We cannot possibly achieve that goal if BEUDO buildings are still burning fossil fuels

Cambridge), but no longer directly (by burning fossil fuels in Cambridge)

Net Zero is not Actually Zero
Buildings will reduce in 2 steps:

Only actual energy consumption reductions fully eliminate future emissions
Net Zero

Actual Zero

Important to create economic pressure in favor of eliminating wasteful
consumption

This graph shows a hypothetical building’s emissions reductions.
Under the current BEUDERO proposal, buildings can still pay to pollute while meeting
the definition of NET ZERO. That may be changed by future councils, but since we
cannot yet force fossil fuel burning to end, we have to create economic economic
pressure against it, in favor of rapid near term decline in emissions. Otherwise,
building operators may well choose to simply pay $234/ton instead of making
changes to their building to actually eliminate emissions.

We’ve failed to meet EVERY SINGLE emissions target so far and the longer that

can’t get to zero by continuing to do that!

It’s important to have a target date for getting to net zero, currently 2050. But it’s also
important how we get there!
This graph shows 2 hypothetical pathways to zero, both achieving the 2050 goal. The
green line represents a rapid reduction at first, and then a slower rate to net zero by
2050. The red line represents a slow reduction at first, and then a rapid drop-off to net
zero by 2050. But what really matters is the area under the curve, which represents
the total amount of emissions during that 30 year period!
In the rapid-slow scenario, far fewer emissions result over the 30 year period, which
means less climate impact. This is why we need BEUDERO to require a more rapid
reduction in emissions. Because the longer we wait, the more buildings will follow the
slow-rapid trajectory, and the more emissions will result.

Rapid, steep
decline
Slow stepwise
decline

This graph shows the proposed BEUDERO emissions reductions schedule in blue,
and an alternative, more rapid decline schedule in green. In both cases the building is
required to reduce their emissions from a baseline (100%), or pay a fee. The more
rapid decline schedule on the other hand requires an 8% reduction every year starting
in 2025. As you can see from the graph, the rapid decline would avoid a lot more
future emissions compared to the slow, stepwise decline.
Both schedules requires a 20% reduction starting in 2025, but nothing before then.
This actually makes sense, because it gives the buildings a few years time to invest in
eliminating emissions rather than paying the city to pollute. But it only works if there is
significant economic pressure after 2025, i.e. if it costs them a lot to keep polluting
after 2025. By making it clear that the cost of continuing to pollute will increase
rapidly, the building operators have a clear incentive to avoid that future cost now.
As mentioned earlier, rapid near-term emissions reductions are critically important to
avoiding even worse climate change. The science is clear that we cannot afford to
continue slow-walking our emissions reductions at this point.
Cambridge is a leader on climate change action, which means we need to be ahead
of others to show them how it’s done. Even if we achieve net zero by 2050 exactly,
we’re still screwed if everybody else is catching up to us at that point! We need to lead
by introducing a more aggressive emissions reduction schedule, so that others will
follow suit, giving us a chance to collectively reach net zero by 2050.

Electrification
& Energy
Reductions

100% Renewable
Electricity Purchases

And realistically, buildings are going to eliminate their emissions in at most 2 steps
anyway: 1) Electrify (remove fossil fuel combustion equipment) & reduce the energy
load (e.g. by adding insulation, etc.). 2) Buy more and more 100% renewable
electricity until emissions are net zero.
Neither step *completely* eliminates emissions however. Only actual energy
consumption reductions fully eliminate future emissions. So it is very important to
create economic pressure in favor of eliminating wasteful consumption. As you can
see in this graph, by requiring more rapid emissions reductions, we create an
incentive for buildings to actually eliminate future emissions quickly to avoid the cost
of having to pay for them later. Instead of deferring building modifications to the future
and buying renewable electricity to comply with BEUDERO, we should see the
opposite: making building modifications first to reduce energy consumption and fossil
fuel combustion, and then buying renewable electricity to achieve net zero. Because
we expect renewable electricity to become more widely available and to be cheaper
than fossil fuel generated electricity, this approach would potentially allow buildings to
actually achieve zero emissions much sooner than the mandated deadline.

Industry Average building performance in Cambridge

For an underperforming building, that is a building that emits more than the average
for their industry during the baseline years, the baseline should be the industry
average in Cambridge, NOT the building’s own performance.
This graph shows a hypothetical building’s emissions reductions under the proposed
amendments to BEUDERO. In blue we see the underperforming building’s emissions
compared to the industry average in green. By requiring the building to reduce from
the industry average, we avoid a lot more emissions.

The current policy design is 50% by 2030
Even if we achieve that goal on the nose among the BEUDO buildings, that doesn’t
mean we’ve achieved it for Cambridge overall! So we have to overshoot in the
BEUDO sector to leave room for challenges achieving it everywhere else.
Unless the BEUDERO emissions were reduced to nothing, the 50% goal won't be
reached without drastically lowering emissions in other sectors. And we don’t have a
good track record on reducing emissions.

Accelerator

The Rocky Mountain Institute’s Building Electrification Accelerator has been working
for the last year and a half with Boston area municipalities on building electrification.
While they were not available to attend in person, they’ve sent us a letter, pasted
below:
December 22, 2021
Councillor Quinton Zondervan
Health & Environment Committee Chair
Cambridge City Hall
795 Massachusetts Ave
Cambridge, MA 02139
Dear Councillor Zondervan,
I write today to applaud the City of Cambridge’s work to develop a leading building
energy performance standard for large buildings, and to encourage the City to include
near-term provisions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade.
RMI has seen growing momentum on local building decarbonization policy in
Massachusetts towns and cities, via our work facilitating the Building Electrification
Accelerator (BEA). BEA includes more than twenty municipalities, many of which are
in Greater Boston. Building performance standards have emerged as a particular
policy focus, even moreso given recently-passed policies in Boston and Denver.

We encourage policy design that includes near-term signals to building owners and
developers to catalyze decarbonization efforts this decade. First, the
Commonwealth’s 2030 emissions reduction targets are unachievable without
progress on buildings. Second, reducing emissions in buildings takes time. Each year,
building owners are making capital investment decisions that will impact their
emissions for the next 15-20 years. This is true to an even greater extent for new
construction, where upfront design can cost-effectivelly reduce or eliminate emissions
in ways that might be more complex down the road.
We appreciate the opportunity to comment and look forward to supporting the City’s
efforts in the coming year.
Sincerely,
Amar Shah
Manager, Carbon-Free Buildings Program
