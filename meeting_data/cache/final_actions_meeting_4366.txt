LANDMARKS AS AMENDED IN COMMITTEE ON APRIL 26, 2023.
2.78.140 Purpose.
The City Council finds it necessary to enact this article under Section 6 of the Home Rule
Amendment in order to preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of the City and to
improve the quality of its built environment through identification, conservation and
maintenance of neighborhoods, areas, sites and structures which constitute or reflect distinctive
features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic, racial, or social history of the City in
balance with other City priorities including allowing housing growth in all City neighborhoods to
welcome a diverse set of residents, sustainability, and accessibility to foster appropriate use and
wider public knowledge and appreciation of such neighborhoods, areas or structures; to broaden
appreciation for individuals with marginalized identities who have shaped Cambridge’s history;
and by furthering these purposes to promote the public welfare by making the City a more
attractive, desirable, affordable, diverse, equitable, accessible, and inclusive place in which to
live and work. To achieve these purposes, the City may designate neighborhood conservation
districts and landmarks to be administered as set forth in this article.

fill the seat after an exhaustive search. Whenever the requirement does not apply, the seat
shall be filled by a district resident.
The Cambridge resident with technical knowledge seat shall be occupied by someone

Cambridge Historical Commission. Under no other circumstance may an individual serve
at once on both the Cambridge Historical Commission and a NCDC.

may continue in office for up to six months after expiration of his or her term until a
successor is duly appointed and qualified., The City Manager may extend by another six
months if no such duly appointed and qualified successor has been appointed at the point
of expiration, provided the City Council votes to approve the extension.
C. The neighborhood conservation district commission shall elect annually a Chair and
Vice-Chair from its own number. In the case of absence, inability to act, or unwillingness
to act because of self-interest on the part of a member, their place shall be taken by an
alternate member designated by the Chair, if available, otherwise by the Vice-Chair if
available, otherwise by a majority vote of the members and alternate members of the
Commission present. The person exercising the function of Executive Director of the
Historical Commission shall serve as secretary of each neighborhood conservation
district commission. Persons serving as members or alternate members of a neighborhood
conservation district commission shall, as a result of such service, be considered as
"special municipal employees" for purposes of Chapter 268A of the General Laws.

architectural features or structures, including, without limitation, any of those enumerated
in this section, if the provisions of the applicable order do not limit the authority of such
commission with respect thereto, may be constructed or altered without review by such
commission without causing substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this
article.
D. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district provides, the
determination of a neighborhood conservation district commission shall be binding only
with regard to applications to construct a new building, to demolish an existing structure
if a demolition permit is required, to construct a parking lot as a principal use, and to
construct an addition to an existing structure that would increase its gross floor area, and
in all other cases the determinations of a commission shall be advisory only and not

district may otherwise provide, no structure designated a landmark or within a
neighborhood conservation district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects
exterior architectural features unless the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall first have issued a certificate of
appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship with respect
to such construction or alteration.

neighborhood conservation district commission shall file with the Commission an

construction of a structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature within a
neighborhood conservation district and no demolition permit for demolition or removal
of a landmark or of a structure within a neighborhood conservation district shall be issued
by the City or any department thereof until the certificate required by this article has been
issued by the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission
having jurisdiction.
D. This provision does not apply to proposals for, or existing, affordable housing projects
that either are developed under the Affordable Housing Overlay, as defined in Section
11.207 of the Zoning Ordinance, or have a majority of their units permanently reserved
for households at or below 100% of Area Median Income, over which neither the
Historical Commission nor any neighborhood conservation district commission has
jurisdiction.

2.78.220 Factors considered by Commissions.
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new
construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure,
and a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not impose dimensional and
setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural
features not subject to public view.
B. A Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not make any recommendation
or requirement except for the purpose of rejecting proposals incongruous to the historic
aspects, architectural significance of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

conservation district commission shall also consider community goals as may from time
to time be expressed by the City Council, including the need to provide additional
housing, affordable and otherwise, and to promote the sustainable use of energy and
capacity for climate resilience.

2.78.270 Enforcement and remedies.
The Historical Commission and any neighborhood conservation district commission are each
specifically authorized to institute any and all actions, proceedings in law and in equity, as it
deems necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this article or to
prevent a threatened violation thereof. Any violation of any provision of this article may be

punished to the like extent provided in Section 13 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws for a
violation of said Chapter 40C. In addition to the foregoing, no building permit shall be issued,
with respect to any premises upon which a landmark or a structure within any neighborhood
conservation district has been voluntarily demolished otherwise than pursuant to a certificate
granted after compliance with the provisions of this article, for a period of two years after the
date of the completion of such demolition (the word "premises" for the purposes of this sentence
referring to the parcel of land upon which the demolished structure was located and all adjoining

arrange for the preparation of a report and, if required, request the appointment of a study
committee. In the event the Historical Commission requests the appointment of a study
committee, the approval of the formation of such committee shall be by order of the City
Council. If a petition for a landmark designation is not accepted by the Historical
Commission or a request to initiate a study of a neighborhood conservation district is not

provisions for both regulatory and educational/incentive programs, the regulatory
provisions of the order shall not be effective unless and until the educational/incentive
provisions of the order are funded.

application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises of a
property being considered for landmark designation shall be granted until reviewed by the
Commission as though the property were designated as a landmark under this Article III.
Beginning with the acceptance of a designation petition or a vote to initiate a landmark
designation study and until (a) the Historical Commission makes a negative
recommendation on a proposed designation, (b) the City Council determines not to enact
the proposed designation, or (c) one year has elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission
shall review all proposed construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior
architectural features, other than color, of the structures on the premises of a proposed
landmark. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction over issuance of building permits in
a neighborhood conservation district study area except in the case of properties that are
already designated as landmarks or protected by a preservation restriction or with regard
to applications to demolish buildings pursuant to Ch. 2.78.Article II.

following one or more public hearings by such neighborhood conservation district
commission and by the Historical Commission, and a report to the City Council by such
commissions containing a summary of testimony at such hearings and
recommendations by such commissions for amendments to the powers, responsibilities
and procedures of such neighborhood conservation district commission (including
amendments to the boundaries of the affected neighborhood conservation district), may
be amended by the City Council, in a manner consistent with the recommendations of
such report, or be rescinded without the necessity of the appointment of a new study
committee or of a de novo study process.

2.78.190 Review procedures.

or change in the boundaries thereof, has been filed with the City Council and has been
recorded with the Registry of Deeds for the South District of Middlesex County.

1.a

B. The order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation district may
provide that the authority of the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation
district commission having jurisdiction shall not extend to the review of one or more of
the following categories of structures or exterior architectural features of the landmark or
within the neighborhood conservation district in which event the structures or exterior
architectural features so excluded may be constructed or altered without review by the
Commission:
1. The application of exterior wall material in a manner that does not require the
removal or enclosure of any cornice, fascia, soffit, bay, porch, hood, window
or door casing, or any other protruding decorative element;

architectural features or structures, including, without limitation, any of those enumerated
in this section, if the provisions of the applicable order do not limit the authority of such
commission with respect thereto, may be constructed or altered without review by such
commission without causing substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this
article.
D. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district provides, the
determination of a neighborhood conservation district commission shall be binding only
with regard to applications to construct a new building, to demolish an existing structure
if a demolition permit is required, to construct a parking lot as a principal use, and to
construct an addition to an existing structure that would increase its gross floor area, and
in all other cases the determinations of a commission shall be advisory only and not
binding on an applicant. In no case shall a building permit be issued until the commission
has made a determination under the applicable provisions of this article.

Overlay or any other means on the premises of a designated landmark shall be advisory
only and not binding on the applicant.
F. Applications for temporary accessibility features shall be granted Temporary Certificates
of Hardship for the length of the ownership or tenancy of the applicant. Such certificates
shall be issued through administrative procedures within one business day. A
determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard to an
application to construct permanent accessibility features shall be advisory only and not
binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical Commission with regard to an
application to construct such permanent features on the premises of a designated
landmark shall be binding, but the Commission shall not in any case deny accessibility
improvements necessary to comply with provisions of the Americans With Disabilities
Act and relevant Massachusetts statutes.
G. A determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard to an
application to construct climate resiliency and renewable energy features shall be
advisory only and not binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical
Commission with regard to an application to construct such features on the premises of a
designated landmark shall be binding but not unreasonably denied.

2.78.210 Certificates of appropriateness, non-applicability or hardship.
A. Except as the order establishing or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation
district may otherwise provide, no structure designated a landmark or within a
neighborhood conservation district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects
exterior architectural features unless the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall first have issued a certificate of
appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship with respect
to such construction or alteration.
B. Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the Historical Commission or
neighborhood conservation district commission shall file with the Commission an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a
certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as the commission may
reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations, specifications, material and
other information, including in the case of demolition or removal a statement of the
proposed condition and appearance of the property thereafter, as may be reasonably
deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a determination on the
application.
C. No building permit for alteration of an exterior architectural feature of a landmark or
construction of a structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature within a
neighborhood conservation district and no demolition permit for demolition or removal
of a landmark or of a structure within a neighborhood conservation district shall be

for households at or below 100% of Area Median Income, in a neighborhood conservation
district, over which neither the Historical Commission nor any no neighborhood conservation
district commission has jurisdiction. The Historical Commission shall have only advisory
jurisdiction with regard to such affordable housing.

2.78.220 Factors considered by Commissions.
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new
construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure,
and a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not impose dimensional and
setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural
features not subject to public view.

or requirement except for the purpose of rejecting preventing proposals incongruous to
the historic aspects, architectural significance or the distinctive character of the
landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

conservation district commission shall also consider community goals as may from time to
time be expressed by the City Council, including the need to provide additional housing,

climate resilience.

2.78.270 Enforcement and remedies.
The Historical Commission and any neighborhood conservation district commission are each
specifically authorized to institute any and all actions, proceedings in law and in equity, as it
deems necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this article or to
prevent a threatened violation thereof. Any violation of any provision of this article may be
punished to the like extent provided in Section 13 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws for a
violation of said Chapter 40C. In addition to the foregoing, no building permit shall be issued,
