operating within city limits with a primary purpose of providing services to
clients who are or have reason to believe they may be pregnant, including
mobile facilities, must either directly provide or provide referrals for abortions or
emergency contraception; and

WHEREAS:

While there do not seem to be any limited services pregnancy centers
operating in Cambridge, several exist regionally including (but not limited to)
Downtown Boston, Brighton, Brookline, Brockton, Lawrence, Quincy, Revere,

Finding of Facts
So called “Crisis Pregnancy Centers,” which often present themselves as providing services to
pregnant people, instead seek to persuade people against having an abortion. This practice is both
deceptive and unwanted, and the City Council finds it necessary to prohibit such activities from being
permitted in the City of Cambridge.
5.60.10 - Definitions
The following definitions shall apply to this article:
Abortion means the termination of a pregnancy for purposes other than producing a live birth.
"Abortion" includes, but is not limited to, a termination of a pregnancy using pharmacological agents.
