The pedestrianization of Copenhagen began with the city’s main street, Strøget, which was converted in 1962
as an experiment. The conversion of the 1.15 km-long main street into a pedestrian street was seen as a pioneering
effort, which gave rise to much public debate before the street was converted.
“Pedestrian streets will never work in Scandinavia” was one theory.
“No cars means no customers and no customers means no business,” said local business owners.

bike lanes (especially here). A question:
Could this bike land shift down Story St.
To connect with Mt. Auburn there?
Opening up this part of Brattle more?
Need for more Poportunity here especially

Needs: HSQ streets as “public” – not just for businesses able to current 2.a
lease prices – still too few commercial attractions - we need things to interest
more shoppers and visitors here, more Poportunity, more “start up”
possibilities, more Black and Brown businesses
