March 23, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the transfer of $20,000 from the General Fund Reserves Other Ordinary
Maintenance Account to the General Fund City Clerk Department Other Ordinary Maintenance
account.
Funds will be used to cover higher than expected printing and advertising costs. The Clerk’s
office has transitioned to creating transcription-based meeting minutes for City Council
meetings. This has resulted in an increase in printing costs. There are also several extensive
zoning petitions which are anticipated to be submitted before the end of the Fiscal Year which
will necessitate further expenditures for printing and advertising.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager
LAD/mec

Packet Pg. 17

1.2

March 23, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of a Homeland Security Grant from the City of Boston
for $7,047.00 to the Grant Fund Fire Salaries and Wages account. The City has received this
grant, as reimbursement, for trainings performed in conjunction with the Urban Area Security
Initiative (UASI).
The UASI committee coordinates the emergency planning in UASI communities, which includes
Cambridge. The City of Boston is the fiscal agent for the Urban Area Security Initiative and
Homeland Security Funds.
This grant will cover the City’s costs for participation in the trainings.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager
LAD/mec

Packet Pg. 18

1.3

March 23, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:
Typically, as the end of the fiscal year approaches, we request from the City Council permission to make
some necessary transfers that would be needed to maintain appropriation control as part of the fiscal endof-year closeout process. These transfers typically involve funding departmental salary and wage
accounts from the salary adjustment budget account contained in the adopted budget.
However, I am seeking this authority now so that if we need to make emergency purchases due to the
current situation that there is flexibility to move funds between statutory accounts and/or between
department budgets. This would allow us to expedite processing and not to have to wait for a City
Council meeting, which may not meet as often as normal. In addition, as we prepare for potential
reimbursements from the State or Federal government, this would allow for orderly tracking of expenses.
As noted, the City Council annually has authorized the City Manager to make necessary transfers from
available budget balances for the orderly closure of the fiscal year.
This request is being requested now due to the special circumstances.

Chapter 12.22

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Section 12.22.010

Short Title

This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.
Purpose

This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City.
Section 12.22.030

Definitions

A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in
both directions.
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility,
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles.
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City.
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time.
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion,
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to
existing conditions or better.
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading,
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are
restored to existing conditions or better.

Attachment: 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

Section 12.22.020

2.1.a

I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round,
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible
loading, intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle
lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better.
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane.
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any
such plan shall maintain Connectivity.
Section 12.22.040

Requirements

A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment.
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane
with Adequate Directionality.
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or
(b) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of

H. “Public Transportation” shall mean bus and shuttle stops for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council.

2.1.a

D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a),
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided,
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has
commenced prior to December 31, 2025.
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-byblock analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that QuickBuild Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection
C.
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle
Lane of Adequate Directionality along
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;

Packet Pg. 37

Attachment: 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025.

2.1.a

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis.
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment.
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound,
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year.
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however,
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN

VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX
WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate
crisis; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero
emissions no later than 2050; and

WHEREAS:

In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and

WHEREAS:

All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating,
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor,
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no
later than the end of October.

November 5, 2018
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

decision in PB 288

Dear Mr. Wilson:
With everything you have to deal with and the blizzard of notices coming from the SJC, it would have been easy to miss
the fact that all statutes of limitations are tolled until April 21, 2020. I didn't see it until it was pointed out to me.
Therefore, I respectfully request that you not consider the decision filed in PB #288 on February 26 final until that date
has passed.
Thank you for keeping up with all of this craziness and not losing your cool. I hope I can do as well myself.
Sincerely,
Heather Maguire Hoffman, Attorney at Law

Proposed Real Estate Transfer fee

Dear City Council:
I am totally opposed to the proposed real estate transfer fee. As proposed, there are no exceptions for life long
property owners who actually reside in their single, two or three family houses. For those who say "...rates and
exemptions are open for discussion...", this is unacceptable. There should be no 'discussion'.
At the very least, before such a petition is even considered, a firm, enforceable commitment to exempt owner
occupied properties must be incorporated from the outset.
We are overwhelmed with the invasion of rich developers, particularly in East Cambridge. The City needs to concentrate
on ways to subject them to 'fees' to accomplish the goal of more affordable housing--not punish the middle class
homeowners.
It's very disheartening to see what's been going on lately in the City I grew up in. Between the cyclists who have been

granted all the rights and subject to no rules, to the promoting of unmonitored composting in the midst of a
serious rodent problem, to the recent Ordinance regarding non-arrest of unlicensed illegal immigrants
potentially putting licensed drivers in danger, I have serious concerns about the thought processes of our City
Officials.

Policy Order #3

I support Policy Order #3. This is an important piece of legislation for affordable housing. Those with high value
properties have benefited greatly from increased value of their property. A real estate transfer fee is a very small tax on
real estate that has risen so much in value.
I do not understand how the city manager can avoid asking the City Solicitor to draft the language to send the the state
legislature for 3 years. That is not acceptable.

WHEREAS:

As of March 23, 17 Cambridge residents had tested positive for COVID-19, more
than doubling the known cases in 4 days, with many more cases expected due to
sustained
community spreading of the virus; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has declared a Health Emergency due to the COVID-19
pandemic; and

WHEREAS:

In the last week, the City of Cambridge has led the way in the fight against COVID-19
and enacted several policies including the closures of hair, tanning and nail salons,
barber shops, gyms, tattoo and body-piercing studios and more, as well as closed
municipal buildings and schools, tot lots, basketball courts, and tennis courts, and
playgrounds, in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which has a
current global death toll of over 15,000; and

WHEREAS:

As we have reached a critical tipping point, local hospitals are already seeing an
increase in cases of COVID-19, and are in danger of being overwhelmed, which will
result in an unprecedented demand on medical personnel and supplies, ultimately
leading to many more deaths as we have seen in other countries; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has received reports that residents are still not practicing medically
advised physical distancing, particularly in grocery stores, public parks, pick-up food
establishments; and

WHEREAS:

On March 23, Governor Baker ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses in
the state and issued a “stay-at-home” advisory, beginning Tuesday, March 24, 2020 at
noon, effective until April 7, 2020 at noon; and

‘Stay at Home’ orders are critical interventions which have been instituted across the
United States; and

MEMORANDUM

Cambridge City Council

From:

Quinton Y. Zondervan, City Councillor

March 19, 2020

Subject:

COVID-19 ideas and suggestions

Dear Colleagues,
These are trying times and we will get through this by working together. The following is a
non-exhaustive list of ideas and suggestions from my office for strengthening our response to
the coronavirus epidemic in Cambridge. As we combine our ideas and diversity of expertise we
will produce the best outcomes that we collectively can.
In terms of our own function as a legislative body, I think the Council should prioritize these
three things:
1. Avoidance of all possible in-person interactions for the next 2 to 3 weeks.
The next few weeks are most critical for flattening the ​curve​. Any effort put into social
distancingtactics over the next few weeks will protect our most vulnerable residents by reducing
their risk of contracting the virus and having to seek treatment in overcrowded hospitals. It is
essential that the Council model this behavior by conducting our own business entirely online
using the Zoom video conferencing platform, as several other cities are doing, including
Newton. While I fully respect and commend the efforts that have already been made to reduce
everybody’s risk, health experts simply do not recommend physical gatherings of the size we
saw at the March 16 regular council meeting at this time. When the public sees councillors and

staff in close physical proximity during our council meetings, they are receiving mixed messages
about the importance of taking precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. It makes
no sense to have any part of our council meetings be in-person during this critical period when
we have the technology to completely avoid that.
2. Continuing to function as the legislative body that directs the city administration’s efforts
It is essential that the council continue to meet and conduct business related to the COVID-19
outbreak, even over these next few weeks. The rapidly-changing nature of the situation will only
continue, and it is important that we have regularly scheduled opportunities to discuss and
approve any appropriations that the City Manager puts forward, uplift the concerns of our
residents, and have frank discussions about necessary policy changes as we respond to the
pandemic. We need to work together to fill in the gaps that have been created in the lives of all
our neighbors and give everyone as much stability as possible, especially the most vulnerable
and those with the most essential needs. This emergency has exposed how thoroughly
unprepared we are to deal with situations like this, and it is going to take considerable time,
effort and attention for us to catch up to it.
3. Maintaining transparency and the public trust
We are fortunate to have the ability to continue conducting business in the age of COVID-19
using online technologies, but we must also be mindful of the downsides. The integrity of our
public process is at stake when residents are not able to give public comment or even watch us
conduct business. I have already spoken with residents who are concerned about council
meetings moving online because they do not have internet access at home. Other residents
have struggled to adjust to the online system for giving public comment, and public comment
was not audible to me last Monday night through the remote participation audio link. The city
should provide a low-stakes training session for residents who would like to learn and practice
using these technologies, in order to be as accommodating, inclusive, and transparent as
possible. While the level of transparency and accessibility we usually enjoy may not be possible
for now, we should avoid advancing significant non-emergency legislation until we have made
adjustments to this new normal, so as to not lose the public trust which is so essential to our
democracy. At some point in the hopefully not too distant future, we will reach a “new normal”

that is more stable, and we may find that we have capacity and ability to work transparently on
other important priorities. We can always reevaluate at that time, but for now working on other
detailed policies will only distract from what we must be most focused on, which is responding to
the immediate crisis.
To accomplish the above I recommend that we do the following:
1. Conduct all city council meetings entirely via the Zoom platform starting Monday, March
23, while continuing to stream the meetings to the general public via all existing
channels.
2. Limit our meeting agendas to our response to the coronavirus pandemic, and anything
else that is time sensitive and urgent.
3. Ensure maximum public participation via Zoom, including public comment.
4. Ensure city websites are accessible to the maximum range of devices and internet
connection setups possible.
In addition, the most important thing we can do is to educate the public on the need for maximal
social isolation. It is important to stay home except for walks/fresh air, and to keep a distance of
15 feet from other people when outside of the home (minimum 6 feet but a small risk of
transmission remains even at that distance).
Here’s a list of suggestions/ideas that have been communicated to us that are worth considering
further:
1. Large apartments: ​Many residents live in large apartment buildings and aspects of
social distancing are logistically challenging. The city should work with the CHA,
non-profit housing providers, and private landlords to minimize the risk of transmission in
shared spaces. The city should develop guidance from both the landlord and tenant
perspective. New York City has ​already​ begun this work. Here are some examples of
things to include:

a. Guidance for minimizing risk in communal laundry rooms, washrooms,
mailrooms, elevators, stairwells, and other shared spaces.
b. Guidance for times when it is necessary for a landlord to enter the home of a
tenant.
c. General infection prevention strategies and disinfection guidance.
d. Additionally, the city should work with building managers to ensure that first
responders know where people with special emergency/medical needs live in
each building, and that any especially vulnerable residents of each building are
receiving the protection and attention they need.
2. Small businesses: ​Many are concerned about the impact of social distancing on our
small businesses, restaurants, and bars. Here are some steps we should consider
immediately (some may already be in the works):
a. The city should use its platform to exert pressure on both the federal and state
government to implement significant relief, including tax relief and extensions,
deferred payment plans for rents, mortgages, utility bills, grants, providing bailout
funds, and emergency zero-interest loans
b. The city should leverage its considerable resources to supplement as necessary
the financial relief provided by state and federal authorities.
c. The city should create a centralized resource for employers and employees to
provide assistance and guidance, as San Francisco ​already has done​.
d. The city should work with Cambridge Local First and other business associations
to develop centralized resources for members of the public interested in
supporting local businesses during the emergency. This could include a list of
restaurants and other businesses offering delivery services, online goods for
purchase, or gift cards for sale.
e. The city should work with Cambridge Local First and other business associations
to provide special assistance to and promotion of businesses that are newly
transitioning to a takeout and delivery model. Residents won’t necessarily know
that these services are even being offered.

3. Taxation, billing, and fees: ​With economic forecasts looking bleak and many residents
already out of work, the city should do what it can to defer or eliminate taxes, billing, and
fees, including the following:
a. Defer collection on any taxes, bills, or fees that it possibly can, including excise
taxes, water bills, and parking permit fees for the time being.
b. Waive the additional fee burden that is presented when making an online
payment to the city.
c. Provide access, education and training for anyone who is not used to paying bills
online.
d. Continue with street cleaning, but not ticket or tow cars for the next month or two.
