throughout the facility.
Access to the vault only for authorized personnel, with layered access
badges, prohibiting free staff movement throughout the premise.
Security agents will monitor the interior and exterior of the facility on
alert for suspicious behaviors.
Employees will be trained on Standard Operating Procedures to respond
instantly in crisis situations.

I, _____________________________, hereby confirm that I am in receipt
of Porter Square Remedies' customer safety information. As discussed
with a Porter Square representative on my visit to the store, I have
been informed of the critical knowledge relative to the safe, legal and
responsible consumption of cannabis, including information relative
to dosage, storage, and safe consumption locations.
I understand that customers should only open packages and utilize
products at home. Opening packages or ingesting marijuana in a
public place -- including within the Porter Square Remedies premises;
adjacent sidewalks, streets, or parking lots surrounding the facility. in
or around adjacent businesses; and within my vehicle -- is illegal.
I understand that customers that do not abide by these community
norms will not be permitted to make future purchases at Porter Square
Remedies and may be reported to law enforcement.
I understand that the product that I have purchased is only intended
for use by me. I understand that diversion of product is illegal and will
be reported to law enforcement.
