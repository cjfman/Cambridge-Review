Broadband - Build a Citywide fiber infrastructure that will enable fiber to the home internet service for every
home and business in the City. Prioritize those most impacted by the pandemic.

The COVID pandemic has had a terrible impact on food security for Cambridge families. The Greater Boston Food
Bank estimates that an astounding 30% of Massachusetts residents have experienced food insecurity in the last
year. Currently, one in five children in Greater Boston is experiencing hunger. That number has more than
Michelle Holcomb Chief
doubled since the start of the pandemic—the biggest increase in child hunger of any state in the U.S. Food
Development Officer Food for programs are struggling to meet this increased need. In May, WBUR reported that food pantries in Eastern
Free
Massachusetts were seeing four times the number of clients as they had before the pandemic. We request
funding for the purchase and transportation of food to Cambridge pantries, schools, and low-income housing
sites. This use of funds will improve nutrition for our community by helping families to access healthy foods in the
places they live, work, and study.

Cambridge is a world-class city in desperate need of a world-class civic space. With ARPA funds, we have a oncein-a-generation opportunity to create one. We propose that Municipal Lot #5 be developed into a permanent
civic center modeled on the Starlight Square initiative and Popportunity. Starlight’s temporary installation has
Matthew Boyes-Watson Flagg proven that public space can be a catalyst for cultural activity and economic equity. It demonstrates the power of
placekeeping during unprecedented loss and displacement—of both residents and businesses. We believe a
Street Studio
permanent civic center framed by affordable retail opportunities and flexible community space can be the center
of our recovery and future success. Our team, myself, Mark Boyes-Watson, Michael Monestime, and Nina Berg,
have designed, built, and operated Starlight Square and Popportunity as a response to and throughout the
challenge of the pandemic. We have a record of exceptional design and thoughtful stewardship.

The Charles River Floating Wetland, a 700-sf artificial island installed near the mouth of the broad canal in June
2020, aims to improve water quality and restore connections to the lower Charles River, where communities
have effectively been walled off from the river. ARPA funds would be used to expand complementary aspects of
this initiative that support educators and learners by providing hands-on, experiential outdoor learning, thereby
addressing increased “screen time” and decreased “green time” that has been exacerbated by the pandemic.
Environmental education tools: Working with Cambridge Public schools and MIT Sea Grant, we piloted a floating
wetland “activity kit” and curriculum booklet in 2021 that allowed students to model the research occurring at
the full-sized wetland. This year we plan to expand distribution from one classroom to nearly 500 students across
CPS 6th grade classrooms in connection with the “River to the Sea” unit. We will support classroom teachers with
training and troubleshooting, and connect satellite learning with opportunities to engage with the full-size
wetland in person.
Community-Driven Expansion Design: Over the summer of 2021, the CRC worked with a team of students from
the Cambridge Mayor’s Summer Youth Employment Program to collect public input on the floating wetland
through on-site pop-ups. This informed their own ideas to kick off efforts to design floating wetland expansion for
the Charles. As we continue to collaborate with the Cambridge Public Works department to utilize artificial
wetlands to meet resilience goals, we will prioritize engagement and input of Cambridge youth.

We propose Cambridge dedicate ~$6mm of ARPA funds for public improvements at the critically sensitive Jerry’s
Pond site. The specific need is to expand the pond’s perimeter along Rindge Avenue, creating space for 150-175
new trees along a largely treeless roadway, building biodiverse wetlands where there’s a steep, unplantable
embankment and fully separating bicycles, creating a complete street along the busiest stretch of Rindge Ave.
There are numerous environmental benefits which align with Cambridge’s climate goals along with critical public
health benefits including: improved air quality, heat island relief, safer bike/pedestrian pathways and access to a
densely planted green space with associated physical and mental health benefits. Especially throughout the
pandemic, the health benefits of green spaces have been recognized and elevated. Along Rindge Ave. live ~4,000
affordable housing residents, so ensuring the greatest public health benefits are met, is a matter of equity. There
are multiple co-benefits also serving this community. Expanding the steep embankment along Rindge requires
compensatory wetlands which are proposed for the corner of Rindge and the Parkway – a largely paved area
under a thin topsoil layer with no history of industrial use per Haley & Aldrich. Supported by Friends of Jerry’s
Pond and Alewife Study Group, the ConCom granted approval to excavate here. De-paving will increase soil
permeability in an area at high risk of floods from storm events while allowing greater tree growth, further
reducing heat-island and improving soil quality. Natural habitats are also improved and expanded with proposed
new tree canopy and wetlands.

FINANCE SUB-COMMITTEE - ARPA COMMUNITY PROJECT IDEAS
Funding Request

Develop a program offering one-on-one technical assistance and implementation support for locally-owned
businesses in Cambridge to assist in their recovery from the pandemic in an era of standardization. This program
could: 1) Provide financial support to local businesses seeking to improve, enhance and elevate their current
operations in their physical and/or online space. 2) Focus on the implementation of technical assistance in local
businesses’ digital and physical spaces. 3) Engage with local service providers to implement the technical
assistance to create a multiplier effect for the community. 4) If possible, target newer business owners, those not
eligible for previous types of funding, businesses owned LGBTQIA+ populations, and businesses in the creative
space. This program could involve an assessment of local business recipients to determine and prioritize their
service needs, then match them with qualified local service providers. This is also a great opportunity to collate a
list of local service providers and compensate them accordingly. The grant could be administered in partnership
with an organization such as Cambridge Local First as well as other business associations. Data suggests that
businesses impacted the most by Covid-19 have experienced higher closure rates and are unable to access or
afford resources to improve their business performance for a number of reasons.
Popportunity is a pandemic-inspired initiative that provides low-cost pop-up stores and technical support to local
entrepreneurs, so they can graduate to permanent stores on Main Street. As a newly minted 501-c3,
Popportunity counteracts the negative economic impacts of COVID, specifically the widespread closure of brick
and mortar businesses and the corresponding job loss. Its first site, located on Municipal Lot #5 alongside
Starlight Square, opened in November 2020 and consists of 13 pop-up stores. The first year saw 220 applicants, a
rotation of 31 entrepreneurs, and one permanent placement on Main Street. If given the resources to expand its
pop-up infrastructure to new sites in the city, Popportunity could provide opportunities to more entrepreneurs
and help restore the COVID-19 losses on Main Street.

PROJECT IDEA

Breakthrough Greater Boston (BTGB), a 501(c)3 nonprofit that has served 7th-12th grade students in Cambridge
for 30 years, respectfully requests support from the City of Cambridge to launch our new College Success
Program. Nationally, only 14% of students from low-income backgrounds complete college within eight years of
high school graduation (compared to 60% of their more affluent peers). Low-income students of color
additionally face the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 as they navigate paths to and through college. The
pandemic is an educational crisis, particularly for the key demographic that Breakthrough serves. In this especially
difficult time, BTGB is powerfully positioned to leverage our six-year relationships with students and our researchbased, holistic College Success Program model to help the students most affected by COVID-19 enroll, persist,
Shannon Farrell Breakthrough and graduate from college. Breakthrough is piloting the College Success Program to extend BTGB’s support for
$
our students through their college years. BTGB delivers tailored guidance that addresses the academic, socialGreater Boston
emotional, and financial challenges faced by low-income students, students of color, and first-generation college
students during the high-risk transition to college and their undergraduate years. BTGB’s Board of Directors is
excited by the potential for a permanent launch of the College Success Program and aims to ensure there is
adequate funding and community partnership support for this expansion. Partnership with the City of Cambridge
would serve as a strong endorsement for this work, which would mark the most significant programmatic
expansion in BTGB’s organizational history by moving from six to 10 years of programming. We respectfully
request an investment of $500,000 to be distributed from FY22 through FY26. $100,000 per year would cover
approximately half of College Success programming costs, and BTGB would commit to raising the matching funds

SEWER MITIGATION - Provide Funding for Off-site Inflow and Infiltration (I&I) Mitigation Required for
Construction of 278 Affordable Apartments at Jefferson Park Federal. By adding 103 units of housing to a site that
currently has 175 units, the state Department of Environmental Protection requires added sewer flow be offset
by on-site or off-site mitigation at a rate of four to one. This is because the Cambridge sanitary sewer is a shared
storm/sanitary sewer that discharges into surrounding waterways during storm events. The estimated 24,520
Michael Johnston
gallons of increased sewer flow will require the mitigation of 98,120 gallons by the project. Approximately 14,100
Executive Director, Cambridge gallons will be mitigated on-site, leaving 83,930 gallons to be mitigated off-site in a project chosen by Cambridge $
Housing Authority
DPW. DPW staff have recommended estimating $15/gallon for the project, meaning the off-site mitigation will
cost the project approximately $1.3 Million. The financial stresses and turmoil of the pandemic have led to
increased rates of homelessness and created an even higher demand for affordable housing in Cambridge. The
Revitalization of Jefferson Park Federal will preserve 175 affordable units at risk of being lost to poor building
conditions and create 103 additional affordable units with a total of 278 units of new housing. Given the
demographics of the residents of Jefferson park and the CHA wait list, many residents are front-line essential
workers who will directly benefit from this housing.

Safe and affordable housing is key to improved health outcomes and economic opportunity. Cambridge Housing
Authority plans to begin construction in the next year on two affordable housing sites: Jefferson Park Federal and
116 Norfolk Street. At Jefferson Park Federal, CHA plans to bring the family housing site from 175 to 278 units,
providing housing for some of the 21,000 households on CHA's waiting list. The pandemic exacerbated the
already difficult economic circumstances of low-income families in Cambridge, increasing the already dire need
for more affordable housing. At 116 Norfolk Street, CHA will increase units on site from 37 to 62, convert single
room occupancy housing to studio apartments, and conduct intake for the new units from the City's Coordinated
Access Network for people experiencing chronic homelessness in Cambridge. The pandemic has shown the
Michael Johnston
Executive Director, Cambridge shortcomings of the congregate living model currently at 116 Norfolk Street, in which seniors and people with
up to $54,000,000
disabilities share kitchens and shower rooms. After construction, all residents will have their own kitchens and

bathrooms, increasing privacy as well as protecting against contagious illnesses. Both projects require the need
for funds from the City. Permanent Supportive Housing like that planned at 116 Norfolk has been shown to
reduce the hospitalization rate of people who were experiencing chronic homelessness prior to entering such
programs. Safe and dignified housing coupled with supportive services is a base from which people exiting
homelessness can pursue their goals for health, employment, and social connection. Providing funds for the
renovation and expansion efforts at Jefferson Park Federal and 116 Norfolk would support the health and
wellness of low-income families and people currently experiencing homelessness, two of the groups most
impacted by the pandemic.
The Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA) has the opportunity to build new affordable housing in East Cambridge
on vacant land within the Millers River parcel. This new construction project on Cambridge Street would add up
to 100 new affordable units to East Cambridge, help preserve the diversity of the neighborhood and bring more
commerce to Cambridge Street. Increasing the supply of affordable housing, protecting diversity, and supporting

requesting ARPA funds for pre-development costs to support the creation of up to 100 new affordable
apartments in East Cambridge. Creating more affordable housing is a long and expensive process that begins with
pre-development. Receiving ARPA funds would allow the CHA to set these plans in motion and reach the end goal
of creating more affordable housing to serve historically underserved populations.

Food is essential to both our physical and mental well-being. Food security, however, proves increasingly difficult
to access amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for populations who bear greater health risks, such as lowincome seniors and people with disabilities. To help mitigate the stress resulting from the pandemic, the
Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA) proposes the creation of a free meals program at four of our developments
with the largest community of at-risk populations: the L.B. Johnson Apartments (177 households), Frank J.
Manning Apartments (205 households), Daniel F. Burns Apartments (198 households) and Millers River
Apartments (300 households). This meal program includes the integration of a commercial kitchen at the LBJ
Michael Johnston
Apartments to parallel the existing kitchens at the other three developments. For these kitchens, the CHA will hire
$
Executive Director, Cambridge
chefs for each location who will work to supply fresh, quality, and healthy meals to up to 880 residents daily.
Housing Authority
Additionally, this program creates the foundation to provide meals for the properties surrounding these three
developments, such as family properties like Woodrow Wilson Court (69 households), Putnam Gardens (122
households), and Roosevelt Towers (199 households), ensuring food security for hundreds of low-income families
as well. The food program will also assist in countering the isolation that many elders experience which has been
exacerbated through the pandemic. CHA has had an existing program at John F. Kennedy Apartments which
enhances the social atmosphere and mental wellness with healthy food. Furthermore, the meals program will
create the opportunity to offer cooking classes for residents in order to provide in-house programming and
opportunities for connection between residents to help combat isolation exacerbated by the pandemic.

PROJECT IDEA

In March 2020, the CHA, Cambridge Health Alliance, and Boston Medical Center started a Community Wellness
Program pilot to provide a full-time community wellness advocate and part-time nurse at Manning Apartments in
Central Square. Manning is home to 205 elders and people with disabilities. The community wellness advocate
and nurse are medical and public health professionals that can effectively consult residents on healthcare and
insurance options, improve medication management, and make connections with doctors, health specialists,
rehab facilities, healthy food sources, legal services, and disability assistance. Approximately 150 residents are
active participants in the program and many have seen significant benefits. One resident in her late 70s was
having difficulty with transportation because she could not see. The pilot program connected her with primary
Michael Johnston
care and eye doctors, and drove her to her initial appointments. When doctors discovered she had cataracts, the
Executive Director, Cambridge program connected her to the correct medical help and now she can see and move around the City safely and

independently. Another resident was suffering from mental health issues and frequently hospitalized due to
difficultly managing medications before the program assisted him by organizing his medications into pill boxes
and getting him a 3-week supply. He hasn't been hospitalized since. As shown in the examples above, the
Community Wellness Program helps keep elders and people with disabilities housed and living independently.
Funding for the program at Manning runs out in early 2023. CHA hopes to utilize ARPA funds to sustain the
Community Wellness Program at Manning (205 households) and expand the program to Millers River (300
households), Burns (198 households), LBJ (177 households), Russell Apartments (52 units) Putnam School (33
units) and Truman (69 households) to better serve over 1,000 low-income seniors and people with disabilities in
Cambridge.

Outdoor activities that involve community engagement like urban farming, break cycles of disempowerment and isolation
that many are feeling due to the pandemic. With our youth, this has become a public health emergency. Growing food
provides a sense of agency to alleviate the mental health affects and food security issues caused by the pandemic. Growing
space at CRLS has been a perennial request by faculty. In 2018 through Spring 2020, teachers participated in professional
development workshops to coordinate integration of climate justice in an interdisciplinary way and across the curriculum.
The effort included Lesley University faculty, Green Cambridge, and Cambridge Youth Programs. One outcome was the need
for growing space on campus as a classroom. During COVID, CPS leadership established an ad-hoc working group to
understand how to integrate outdoor learning into curriculum. This group also identified the need for outdoor, hands-on
classrooms. Green Cambridge has extensive experience creating and managing educational growing spaces using a
collaborative model in Cambridge. We partner with Cambridge DPW to revitalize and operate the Riverside Press Park,
operate our Hurley Street Neighborhood Farm with funding provided by Cambridge Public Health, and have built a learning
garden for Nurtury Preschool at Moses Youth Center funded by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. We share our
Hurley location with City Sprouts, and support Cambridge City Growers. In addition, our Executive Director Steven Nutter is
on the City’s Food Planning Task Force and Climate Protection Action Committee. With CRLS stakeholders, Green Cambridge
would facilitate a community process to develop a design by working with James Shen, Loeb Fellow and Partner at People's
Architecture Office. A full description of the project can be found at: bit.ly/CRLSfarm. Green Cambridge would operate the
Farm by creating a Grow Team Intern program to pay students. We would collaboratively coordinate the Farm with
Cambridge City Growers and in coordination with City Sprouts and Lesley Faculty.

The mission of the Outdoor Church of Cambridge is to care for the unhoused, homeless, and economically
disadvantaged community of Cambridge, Massachusetts. In the course of undertaking this mission, we provide
spiritual, pastoral, and outreach care to over 250 of the community weekly, in many instances, multiple times a
The Outdoor Church / Steven week. We provide this care by bringing food and other items to the various locations where our community
congregate. During the COVID crisis, we have met the increased need for food and other care uninterrupted. The

PROJECT IDEA
Cambridge HEART (Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team) is a crisis response and public safety program
for Cambridge, MA. HEART addresses a need for alternative ways for individuals experiencing crises (including
those related to mental health, substance use and domestic violence) to receive help at their moment of need. It
also enhances community cohesion by facilitating residents' knowledge of and access to existing community
services. HEART is led and staffed by community members representing the most marginalized communities in
Cambridge. The COVID pandemic has had adverse effects on the health and social-economic well-being of
$
residents, with those from marginalized backgrounds experiencing a disproportionate impact (Artiga, Garfield,
and Orgera 2020). The HEART program addresses these adverse effects. HEART responders provide traumainformed care and support for those experiencing mental health crises, and is specifically designed to meet the
needs of marginalized community members such as those who are unhoused. HEART responders also provide
conflict mediation services to support the resolution of both private and public disputes including instances of
domestic violence.
Cambridge community members who are financially vulnerable may have exacerbated economic needs due to
the pandemic. HEART provides mutual aid to directly meet their needs. Furthermore, HEART indirectly addresses
economic impacts of the pandemic by providing employment opportunities within organization for community
members: as responders, program staff and more.
To rebound Cambridge businesses and boost long-term economic development, we propose a Independly-owned
Local Business Procurment Fair. Many local shops, service providers, and industries have suffered from a lack of
institutional sales. With hospitals, schools, government facilities, and business spaces at reduced capacity, the
network of businesses that support these institutions have seen significant drops in revenue and some have had
to close. In addition, we have seen a shift towards digital providers and online delivery services. To focus support,
sales, and attention towards these greatly impacted, locally-owned businesses, we need an organized initiative to
$
put them center stage again. This procurement fair will do just that. The Sustainable Business Network of
Massachusetts has specialized in managing the Local Food Trade Show for 11 years, and would use this expertise
to conduct a highly successful B2B convention. Bringing together the diverse array of Cambridge businesses, we
would match supply and demand needs in the market and refocus institutional purchasing towards the
businesses that give Cambridge its integrity and culture. This procurement fair is a single day event featuring
these business with targeted sales meetings, panels, exhibitions, and networking meetings to deepen these B2B
connections.

Cambridge food businesses would greatly benefit from a commercial kitchen space for shared-use and business
incubation. Food businesses have seen extreme financial hardships during the pandemic, with an estimated
110,000 US restaurants temporarily or permanently closed at the peak. Those who have survived now face
extreme difficulties as their margins shrink further due to labor shortages, inflation, and supply-chain shortages.
In Cambridge, many restaurants have closed and many storefronts remain unused. Cambridge currently has no
such commercial kitchen space, yet the city has signed support for the cottage residential program. Currently,
$1,000,000 many of these entrepreneurs’ only opportunity is at church kitchens or pop-ups. While the Foundry is an
incredible project, it will serve as a test kitchen only and doesn’t make a space for establishing businesses. Shared- $3,000,000
use kitchen’s are known to reduce start-up costs and share risks for both established and emerging caterers,
restaurateurs, and value-added producers. This project’s potential to lower the entry barrier for new food
businesses is extremely important considering the high-failure rate that restaurants already face. To expand the
impact of this project we propose that a number leases for the space be reserved for Black/Brown-owned
businesses, given that there currently only exist about 6 out of the nearly 400 pre-pandemic food service
businesses in Cambridge.

The Cambridge-Somerville Black Business Network (CSBBN), in partnership with the Sustainable Business Network
of MA, Cambridge Local First, and the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA), and multiple banks,
law firms, and a community foundation, is developing an Equity Fund to increase the number of Black and Brown
businesses in MA. Black and Brown founders receive less than 2.6% of venture capital and fewer than 4% of
decision makers at the firms are Black or Brown. "Pattern recognition" remains the major driver of investment
decisions. Most start-up and growing businesses rely upon "friends and family loans", however the lack of wealth

Business Diversity DIrectory, only 3 food businesses identify as Black-owned in Cambridge. Black businesses were $

Only 43% of businesses received all of the Payroll Protection Program funding they applied for, compared to 79%
of white-owned businesses (wapo.st/3vvISZp). Though BECMA will oversee the statewide Fund, CSBBN will be
responsible for Fund activities in Cambridge. Activities will include: fundraising; screening businesses; connecting
businesses to technical assistance (required to participate); working with bank to train business school fellows in
underwriting, therefore building capacity in the community; resource development; and communications to grow
the Fund. Capital raised in Cambridge will be earmarked to be used exclusively in the city. To launch this Fund,
seed funding is needed for loans and grants for minority businesses in Cambridge.

PROJECT IDEA
Just A Start respectfully requests $75,000 to support costs of deleading activities. The funding will be a grant to
the homeowner for up to $5,000 per unit to be used for deleading activities including lead testing. The funding
would leverage Just A Start’s Home Improvement Program (HIP). This funding will remove a barrier to the critical
public health issue of remediating lead paint hazards, which has historically had a disparate impact on lowincome families and communities of color. The cost of deleading, in particular lead testing, has become an
increasing burden over the past two years as the pandemic has negatively impacted our clients’ finances.
Furthermore, homeowners are spending more time at home, often in unsafe and substandard housing. The HIP
program is often the only viable option for homeowners with poor credit and/or low income to make essential
repairs to their homes. Part of the HIP program's charge under HUD is to ensure homes participating in the
program are lead safe. The associated costs with deleading are often unexpected and prohibit homeowners from
moving forward with HIP and making critical repairs to their home. Homeowners must pay for lead testing (up to
$500) out of pocket before they know the scope of the deleading work or whether they can receive HIP or other
funding. Once the scope is determined, and they qualify for the program, we can help clients access city grants
and state loans but they typically don’t cover full deleading expenses.

Community Servings’ mission is to actively engage the community to provide scratch-made medically tailored
meals to individuals and their families experiencing critical or chronic illness and nutrition insecurity. We commit,
in all our programs and business practices, to prioritize racial and economic justice and health equity. Over the
past 23 years of service in Cambridge, Community Servings has provided nearly 500,000 home-delivered
medically tailored meals to Cambridge residents. Our "Nutrition Program for Cambridge Residents Affected by
Critical & Chronic Illnesses" is a critical health intervention and an emergency household nutrition assistance
program for individuals and their families who are experiencing the dual challenges of poverty and serious illness,
including cancer, renal disease, diabetes, and COVID-19. Cambridge residents who are severely immune$
compromised and nutrition insecure have faced enormous challenges due to COVID-19, and accompanying
economic disruption and rates of food insecurity are expected to remain at historic levels for years, with longterm health consequences. Community Servings is committed to a long-term recovery approach, strengthening
our nutrition program for Cambridge populations that have faced systemic underinvestment and been
disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. ARPA funding will support the home-delivery of 125,000 medically
tailored meals, customized to meet the individual health needs of 250+ Cambridge clients, their dependent
children, and caregivers over the five-year funding period. Each weekly delivery includes five days’ worth of
medically tailored meals for each household member. Funds will be allocated to meals and kitchen expenses
associated with the provision of medically tailored meals to Cambridge residents.

Breakthrough Greater Boston (BTGB), a 501(c)3 nonprofit that has served 7th-12th grade students in Cambridge
for 30 years, respectfully requests support from the City of Cambridge to launch our new College Success
Program. Nationally, only 14% of students from low-income backgrounds complete college within eight years of
high school graduation (compared to 60% of their more affluent peers). Low-income students of color
additionally face the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 as they navigate paths to and through college. The
pandemic is an educational crisis, particularly for the key demographic that Breakthrough serves. In this especially
difficult time, BTGB is powerfully positioned to leverage our six-year relationships with students and our researchbased, holistic College Success Program model to help the students most affected by COVID-19 enroll, persist,
Breakthrough Greater Boston and graduate from college. Breakthrough is piloting the College Success Program to extend BTGB’s support for
$
our students through their college years. BTGB delivers tailored guidance that addresses the academic, social/ Elissa Spelman
emotional, and financial challenges faced by low-income students, students of color, and first-generation college
students during the high-risk transition to college and their undergraduate years. BTGB’s Board of Directors is
excited by the potential for a permanent launch of the College Success Program and aims to ensure there is
adequate funding and community partnership support for this expansion. Partnership with the City of Cambridge
would serve as a strong endorsement for this work, which would mark the most significant programmatic
expansion in BTGB’s organizational history by moving from six to 10 years of programming. We respectfully
request an investment of $500,000 to be distributed from FY22 through FY26. $100,000 per year would cover
approximately half of College Success programming costs, and BTGB would commit to raising the matching funds
from external sources
Develop a program that will allocate 20 total full "All Alcohol" licenses for minority-owned businesses, with half
specifically set aside for Black-owned businesses. There are currently only four minority-owned restaurants/bars
in Cambridge that have full liquor licenses according to the Cambridge Business Diversity Directory. Black-owned
Sustainable Business Network businesses across the country were severely impacted by the pandemic, with more than 40% closing within the
of Massachusetts/
first six months of the crisis. Bars and restaurants in Cambridge were also hit hard, leading several to go out of
Allison Deyo
business due to several pandemic-related factors. As a result, several former bar and restaurant spaces are
vacant. This program will make it more financially feasible for minority-owned food and beverage businesses to
move into these spaces. It will also make it easier for existing minority-owned businesses to expand their
offerings and generate more revenue through alcohol sales as they recover from the economic fallout of the
pandemic. Both of these outcomes will potentially lead to job creation within the city as well.

PROJECT IDEA
We are proposing a Digital Navigator Program for Cambridge residents living in affordable housing. The services
offered would be in line with the recommendations of the Digital Equity in Cambridge: Data and Strategic
Recommendations Report which was prepared for the City of Cambridge, MA and released in April 2021. Just A
Start trains adults in a 9 month tuition free program for entry level positions in IT. Many graduates are Cambridge
residents, have lived in affordable housing and are multi-lingual. The IT graduates could be hired as Digital
Navigators. They would work with the Resident Service Coordinators of each housing development to offer
services including: signing up residents with low-cost providers and enrolling eligible residents in the Affordable
Connectivity Program. Digital Navigators would also be available to help residents set up connectivity in their
homes or trouble-shoot when problems occur. They would also connect residents to free/low-cost computers
and related equipment when needed. Digital Navigators would work with residents to identify their individual
needs and wishes for being connected. Individual and group trainings on site would be offered. Depending on
funding level, Just A Start would seek to partner with the Cambridge Housing Authority, Housing Resources Inc.
(HRI), Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) and other Cambridge affordable housing providers to bring
services to their residents. We would also work closely with the Cambridge Public Library as their programming
also works on digital access issues.
$
The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has resulted in lay-offs, lost work through quarantining and needing to provide
childcare for children learning from home, long COVID symptoms: resulting in increased costs with everyone at
home, financial strain, and the depletion of savings. These negative economic impacts, particularly on low income
residents and communities of color, will take years to overcome. Just A Start has been in the process of building
out a storefront location in Central Square, at 55 Norfolk St, a small building owned by our company, on the
Financial Opportunity Center model, combining one-on-one career coaching and financial coaching services under $
one roof, additionally leveraging our community contacts for direct referrals and warm hand-offs to food pantry,
childcare, and benefit sign-up assistance services. During tax season, this storefront location will host intake for
our volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) site, offering free tax preparation to income-qualified community
members, with an eye on maximizing refunds, handling complicated tax situations like gig economy work from
people adapting their working lives to the pandemic, and advising on the use of refunds through integration with
our one-on-one financial coaching.

PROJECT IDEA
Just A Start is respectfully requesting $252,000 to provide stipends to students of our Biomedical Careers
Program and IT Careers Programs, which provides full-time workforce development training to adult students to
enter careers in the growing life sciences and IT sectors. The COVID pandemic has highlighted systemic inequities
that exist in our communities, and especially in our workforce. Low-income people have been especially hit hard
due to losing jobs and/or job security, leading to volatility in income. This uncertainty of the next paycheck has
led to housing, financial and food insecurity. The need for family-sustaining wages is high, and with it the need for
programming to help them achieve economic stability. Our workforce development programs aim to support the
$
economic resiliency and mobility of low-income individuals and families. The 9-month long programs take place
Mon- Fri from 9am-2pm. The time commitment (22 hours/week class time plus homework) is intensive and can
make the program inaccessible to some students due to family, childcare, work, and other responsibilities. Tuition
is free but not free of cost as students forgo time, and therefore income, to be able to attend the program.
Stipends will be a critical tool in providing financial assistance that will allow students to participate in a program
that has proven to increase earning potential. The average wage increase is $15,000/year - a substantial increase
considering participants need to earn 80% or less of the Area Median Income to qualify, and most students earn
50% or less.

This project proposes that the City of Cambridge rehouse 400 individuals experiencing homelessness between
April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2023, and functionally end homelessness by April 1, 2024. This could be accomplished
through the proposed Cambridge Unhoused Stipend Program (CUSP), which would cover the full cost of living for
participating unhoused individuals and families for three years, and a significant portion (at least rent less 30% of
household income) for the following 7 years. CUSP embraces a Housing First approach to ending homelessness,
and performs three key activities: - Identifies eligible households, - Finds and secures available units, and - Moves
those eligible households into those units, and provides long-term supportive services as necessary. We have
attached a more detailed description of CUSP to this email. This proposal was written by Project Right to Housing $
and incorporates input from homelessness services providers and unhoused community members. The unhoused
community has been disproportionately affected by the ongoing pandemic. Limited shelter and housing options
have left many people on the street or in crowded congregate shelters where life is difficult and the risk of
contracting COVID-19 is high. There have been reductions and changes to resources, including health services,
day centers and homeless services, that were available to people who are unhoused prior to the pandemic,
making their lives significantly more challenging. Stringent requirements for identification and other impediments
have also made it hard for many unhoused people to gain access to federal aid that many people have been able
to obtain. Though the burden of the pandemic has eased somewhat, rehousing through CUSP will go a long way
towards sustainably addressing these needs, which remain at crisis levelsmic

PROJECT IDEA

Given the success of the City funded Street Medicine Project, which provides funding for a Physician to work up to 12
hours/week with the Baycove First Step Outreach Team, I am interested in new funding to expand this project. We would
like to extend hours of direct care MD services and add a community health worker to existing team. The role of the MD on
the van has been demonstrated the ability to bring acute health care services to people living on the street. This MD is also
providing care in our shelter-based clinic at the CASPAR/Baycove shelter at 240 Albany St, one afternoon/week and works
Mark T McGovern
on inpatient units at The Cambridge Hospital. The ability to see patients in these 3 settings has helped to provide an
Program Director
$
Cambridge/Somerville Health increased continuity of care as well as nurture relationship building with these traditionally hard to engage people. So, we
would like to enhance this model by adding MD time on the outreach van and add clinical sessions in our shelter-based
Care for the Homeless
clinics in order to see these same patients in a clinical setting. I would like be able to hire an additional MD for this so that
we could build a team. We propose to add an MD to do 2 Street Outreach Sessions/Week and 2 Sessions/week in shelterbased clinics for a total of 16 hours/week. We are also proposing to add a Community Health Worker to the team in order to
provide critical support to the MDs in order to assist with coordination of care, transportation to clinic sites, assist with
access to health insurance, provide for medication pick up and delivery when needed and work the clinic sessions with the
Street MDs to provide the familiarity of connection when these patients present in the shelter-based clinic. The Community
Health Worker would be a FT 40 hour/week position.

This project idea is generalizable to all direct care serving nonprofits who are struggling to pay increasing wages and keep
staff and youth healthy. However this project idea is focused on the specific needs of Cambridge Camping since it is such an
urgent need as our seasonal staff hiring is happening right now for April vacation camp, the summer and into the fall for
weekend camp. For Cambridge Camping, funds would be used for reimbursement for sick days for seasonal part-time or fulltime front-line staff working directly with youth. As per the CDC guidelines, if someone tests positive they are to stay home
Sharon Zimmerman Executive for 5 days. There is a disproportionate impact on those who with lower incomes and who are BIPOC which for Cambridge
$
Director Cambridge Camping Camping is the case for 80% of our seasonal staff working summer, school vacations and weekends. We want our staff to
Association
feel able to stay home if they have symptoms or test positive for Covid without fear of lost wages, which many of our staff
use to help support their families. Nonprofits don't usually budget for paid time off for seasonal part time staff and those
are the people who need the money the most, come to work sick and spread illness. Many nonprofits who run summer,
school vacation and weekend programming have to get substitutes to fill in when staff are sick, then having to pay double.
As wages increase due to the economic impacts of Covid, this financial burden is unmanagable, especially as we are hiring
more staff than in typical years to help meet increased camper mental health needs. Our camp staff and their communities
have been disproportionately impacted by loss of income and illness throughout the pandemic, and these funds would allow
us to support their essential work supporting vulnerable youth. We are also requesting funding for home Covid tests for
youth and staff to help prevent transmission.

PROJECT IDEA

The Work Force Youth Program (TWF) has been serving youth and families since 1984. The goal of TWF is to disrupt the cycle of poverty by
helping youth attain post-secondary credentials that position them for sustained economic mobility and the creation of generational wealth.
TWF serves about 360 youth annually from the 6th grade through completion of their post-secondary degrees. Our sites operate at CHA's
three largest family developments, CRLS, and the CSUS. Sites are staffed by a full-time Teacher-Counselor, a part-time Learning Center
Coordinator and are supported by a full-time Director, Alumni Coach, and Career Development Specialist. Our success is measured by
tracking multiple outcomes. Key metrics include annual matriculation into 2- or 4-year colleges (90% and above) and college graduation rates
within 6-years of leaving high school (nearly 80%). The program's comprehensive approach and meaningful engagement with families
produce outcomes that are well above the national averages for low-income youth. However, the pandemic has created significant
challenges for our participants and their families. Many of our students, families, and seniors are struggling with trauma and need greater
supports. Loss of income, food insecurity, and prolonged illness due to COVID, social isolation, and learning loss and atrophied socialemotional development during remote learning have severely impacted many of our residents. To meet these needs, we are seeking funding
to support a three-pronged approach over three years. Funding would assist us in securing a second Alumni Coach, provide sequential
training to staff on trauma informed practices, and support the expansion of a unique intergenerational pilot. Responsible for a caseload of
well over 100 students, our Alumni Coach worked to meet the needs of our alumni as they struggled with isolation, remote learning, and
persistence in college. The addition of a second Coach creates more manageable caseloads and enhances support services for each graduate.
Additionally, targeted training in trauma informed practices will bolster our ability to support both current participants and alumni as they
contend with post-pandemic challenges. Finally, to address the social isolation at many of our elderly developments, we are proposing the
expansion of our Intergenerational Basic Computer Literacy and Cyber-Security pilot, an eight week program built on Tech Goes Home
modules taught by two TWF high school seniors.

In April of 2021, the CHA's Resident Services department incorporated a team of eight Service Coordinators and a
Director into the agency to provide comprehensive aging-in-place supports to residents of our elderly/disabled
developments. All members of the team are credentialed Social Workers and/or Clinicians who have extensive
experience working with under-resourced clients in a variety of social service settings. Growing concerns over the
health and welfare of our senior residents during the pandemic served as the primary impetus to take this
John Lindamood
Director important step. Social isolation and reduced services contributed to an alarming increase in various mental health

issues. Over the past year, the individual and concerted efforts of the Service Coordinator staff were instrumental $
Cambridge Housing Authority in diminishing the impact of the pandemic on CHA elderly and disabled populations. The proposed project seeks
funding to support a small portion of the Service Coordinators' and their Director's salaries over the next three
years (25% annually), as well as a small amount to conduct training enhancements, in the form of Certificate
programs in Gerontology and/or Aging-In-Place Case Management Services. As we navigate the aftermath of the
pandemic, ongoing city support for the critical services this team provides to our most vulnerable residents is
imperative, as is increased training opportunities to position them to provide the best possible services to the
thousands of residents who make CHA's elderly developments their home.

PROJECT IDEA
The Cambridge Community Center (CCC) aims to increase access to mental/behavioral health services and
treatment for youth and families enrolled in our programs who are experiencing mental/behavioral health
challenges by providing community-based therapeutic services. We hope to utilize the currently unoccupied
space located at 205 Western Avenue to provide: 1. Support for Youth: Youth with high-level mental/behavioral
health needs will be identified by our Social Worker to receive additional support and/or treatment. These
services will take place at 205 Western Avenue during regular program hours. Therefore, services will be provided
in a setting that's familiar to the child at a time and location that's convenient for their caregivers. 2. Support for
$
Families: Our Social Worker will work with caregivers to co-create plans to best support youth in their home
environments, building on the positive impact of services provided during program hours. Additionally, caregivers
who require additional support and/or treatment themselves will be able to receive those services at 205
Western Avenue while their children are being cared for in our program. Mental/behavioral health issues among
Cambridge Public School students have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic according to data reported in
the 2021 Cambridge Youth Health Survey. In 2021, 35% of high school students and 27% of middle school
students reported feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 weeks or more that they stopped doing usual
activities. This compares to 26% of high school students in 2018 and 24% of middle school students in 2019

Food For Free's Weekend Eats Program (formerly Cambridge weekend backpack program) has shifted to what we
call "Carrot Cards" which are debit cards similar to those used in Cambridge's UBI pilot. We have received
overwhelming feedback from families that they prefer these to food as it allows them to get culturally
appropriate foods. As a side note, we see in the data that a number of families use these cards at their local
ethnic bodegas. We plan to move away from food entirely and go with the Carrot Card. Due to the drastic
increase in food insecurity, our program grew from about 900 kids across Cambridge and Somerville to over 2000.
Sasha Purpura Chief Executive We also now distribute an additional 6 million pounds of food across Eastern MA. We need to ensure we have
$
Officer Food for Free
funding to keep up this work, as we don't see a decline in demand anytime soon. Cambridge historically funds
$75k of Weekend Eat. An additional $100k was approved through ARPA. I'm asking for an additional $200k in
ARPA (for a total of $300k ARPA) to cover the entire cost of the cards. Food For Free would find other funding for
the staffing/management/execution of the program. We are asking the same of Somerville for their students. Our
budget went from $1.4m pre-pandemic to over $4m. We now distribute around 8 million pounds versus 2m in
2019. We need our cities and state and others in the community to help share the burden of this new crisis in
hunger so that we can keep up with the demand.
