That the City Manager is requested to work with DPW to restore Linear Park by re-using the
existing award-winning design, to create, publish and implement a climate resilience-based
maintenance plan and minimize the embodied carbon of the project by re-using, wherever possible,
the existing lamps and lamp posts.
A communication was received from Bill Deignan, Transportation Planner, Community
Development Department, transmitting a presentation titled Linear Park Redesign Project,

OFIRST IN COUNCIL
November 14, 2023

COUNCILLOR NOLAN
MAYOR SIDDIQUI
COUNCILLOR TONER
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge Community Development Department Transportation Division
is redesigning Linear Park by widening and straightening the already “AASHTO”
compliant shared path, which design would approximately double the paved area,
would require excavating, moving, and replacing the elegant lighting fixtures
(unnecessarily generating waste and pollution), and could endanger over eighty (80)
mature trees; and

WHEREAS:

Linear Park has received four (4) Landscape Design awards and was designed (in part)
by Deneen Crosby who has lived in North Cambridge for many years, received the
2018 “Women in Design Award of Excellence” from the Boston Society for
Architecture, and, with her company, designed Magazine Beach Park; and

WHEREAS:

There is interest in the community in amending the plan by restoring it instead of a
major redesign and path widening proposed by the city, as evidenced by a petition
signed by over 230 Cambridge residents; and

WHEREAS:

On August 7, 2023, the council passed Policy Order 2023 #136 requesting that the City
Manager “determine whether there are opportunities to minimize new or additional
pavement and encourage using permeable surfaces in public and private construction
throughout the city”; and

WHEREAS:

On September 13 2021, the council passed Policy Order 2021 #164 requesting that the
City Manager “will go out of their way to prevent the removal of significant trees on
City property”; and

WHEREAS:

The Urban Forest Master Plan (UFMP) 2020 – 2025 Action Plan states:
1. Our first priority must be to remove fewer trees unnecessarily;
2. To extend the lives of our trees through improved management practices;
3. Redesign streets and sidewalks to make room for more trees;
4. Add (not remove) trees to parks;
5. Add new parks;
6. City Council with the City Manager and various departments are all to participate in
the UFMP implementation; and

WHEREAS:

With 2023 again setting global heat records, and an emphasis on equity and social
justice in every city decision, the city should provide cooler and shadier routes for
people who have no choice but to use the MBTA buses at Rindge Ave and at
Massachusetts Ave or the Red Line at Alewife and Davis stations; and

Packet Pg. 2

WHEREAS:

Sound climate policy mandates minimizing the embodied carbon of all projects, which
means re-using existing materials as much as possible, and minimizing destruction of
trees, which sequester carbon in their bodies and through the soil; and

WHEREAS:

Climate Change makes it increasingly difficult to preserve existing mature trees or to
successfully grow additional trees as evidenced by recent droughts and anticipated
future extreme weather events; and

WHEREAS:

Safety on the multi-use path, is critical, and would not be compromised by a slight
widening instead of major redesign, since the path has been successfully shared for
over 35 years between pedestrians, bicycles, and all users, and safety, is enhanced by
the traffic calming supplied by the current curves and its width that matches the
Somerville and Belmont paths; and

WHEREAS:

The plans for linear park call for a 14 foot wide path (plus 2 feet on either side of stone
dust), a dramatic increase from the current 10.5 foot width, and which is the widest
width within state guidelines for shared use paths of 10-14 feet and a width of 10-12
feet in an urban area where open space is scarce, seems adequate; and

WHEREAS:

The path needs to be repaired and maintained, but dramatically increasing the paved
area, combined with planned tree removal and tree damage, will lead to additional heat
island effect impacts; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DPW to consider
restoring Linear Park by re-using the existing award-winning design, including
retaining the existing pavement footprint, or consider making the entire path nonpavement as some other multi-use paths are, and using wood chips/mulch instead of
stone dust to provide extra space for pedestrians, with the top priority being to extend
the life of all existing trees using all best practices; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DPW to create, publish
and implement a climate resilience-based maintenance plan for Linear Park that would
protect and enhance the tree canopy by, at the minimum, restoring the irrigation
system, de-compacting the soils, amending the soils, and blocking short-cuts within the
Critical Root Zone of the trees; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DPW to minimize the
embodied carbon of the project by re-using, wherever possible, the existing lamps and
lamp posts, and keeping them in their existing locations, and by taking all other
possible actions to minimize waste and reduce embodied carbon.

One of our main goals is to improve the health
and diversity of Linear Park's plantings. We
intend to do this by:


Planting additional trees, shrubs and groundcover
species



Improving soils



Replacing unhealthy trees & Removing invasive species



Protecting existing trees


Protect existing mature trees



Transplant rather than remove smaller trees when needed

The Signi cance of Linear Park
• A beloved park and “cool
corridor” — not a
transportation corridor

• An award-winning project
in the 1980’s

• A unique “woodland walk”
• A narrow 41-82’ wide

park, enjoyed by many
di erent users

Our Priorities for the Linear Park Project
1. Protect and preserve the trees
2. Minimize impervious surfaces
3. Address years of deferred
maintenance
4. Address safety and comfort for
all users (tra c calming tools,
supplemental routes)

1. Protect and Preserve Trees
• Trees are essential infrastructure —
September 2021 Policy Order

• The park’s trees are already under stress
• 70 park trees are within 3’ of the edge of
the existing 10.5’ wide path

• The air spading report identi es 1.5-2’ of
additional pavement as allowable for only
11 of the 70 trees along the path—the
plan calls for 7.5’ of additional pavement

• The air spading report recommends that
ll within existing root zones “…should
be a permeable material that allows air
exchange for tree root respiration”—
asphalt and stonedust are not permeable
6
Packet Pg. 32

a

2. Minimize Impermeable Surfaces
• Depaving is recommended by the UFMP
and an August 2023 Policy Order

• The existing path is 10.5’ wide; widening it
to 14’ plus 4’ of stonedust shoulders
equals a 70% increase in pavement

• The Somerville portion of Linear Path was
reconstructed in 2019 at a 10’ width

• Adjacent shared-use pathways have
widths of 8’, 10’, and 12’

3. Address Years of Deferred Maintenance
• Highly compacted, bare soils
throughout the park

• Many exposed tree roots
• Degraded/narrowed pavement
and puddling

• Broken irrigation system
• Reduced canopy —100 trees lost
between 2016 and 2018

Packet Pg. 34

4. Address Safety and Comfort for All Users—
Employ Tra c Calming Tools and Signage
• Employ standard and new
Cambridge park signage to
communicate expected
behaviors — as set by the
2023 Street Code, i.e.,
“Respect Others”

• Employ standard Cambridge
park signage to identify and
celebrate Linear Park

• Keep in mind MASSDOT

shared-use pathways —
