▪ The City of Cambridge’s capital spending/public investment is a direct reflection of its
priorities and values as a community and is shaped by many sources of input
▪ Capital is different from operating spending as it supports multi-year projects and
acquisition of long-term assets
▪ It is guided by the principles of adding long term value to the community, appropriately
managing the taxation rate, and maintaining creditworthiness
▪ While the majority of capital projects are processed via the Capital Budget, there are
other sources of support, which are also subject to City Council approval
▪ Department Capital requests are first evaluated by the Capital Budget Committee, then
City Manager, with ultimate approval sitting with City Council
▪ There are several large projects being considered for future capital investment that will
need to be prioritized
▪ While increasing debt is an option to grow total capital spending, there are many factors
to consider when evaluating how much debt is appropriate for the City to take on
▪ Today’s presentation will provide an overview of the capital budget/public investment
planning process and considerations regarding City debt, in order to lay the groundwork
for discussions about future investments

1. CAPITAL BUDGET/PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUND

The City finances some capital budget projects through bonds to add
stability to budget and spread cost out of over the life of the project

Capital Budget

▪ Requires loan approvals to issue bonds for
specific projects

Bonding Schedule

▪ Once the City Council approves (authorizes)
a loan order for a capital project (typically
with adoption of the Capital Budget, but
sometimes off-cycle), the City can then
borrow funds up to the amount approved

Borrow funds/ issue debt

▪ The City does not need to borrow all of the
approved funds at one time, which is reason
for a multi-year bond schedule

City Council Loan Authorization
