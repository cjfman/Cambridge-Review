WHEREAS:

On March 12th, 2020, Governor Baker issued an executive order authorizing
municipalities to conduct public meetings virtually, and allowing residents to give
public comment remotely; and

WHEREAS:

In the year since, the City Council, the Planning Board, and various other City entities
have held productive remote meetings, and as we approach mass-vaccination and a
new normal, it is clear that virtual participation should remain as an option for
residents; and

WHEREAS:

Remote participation enhances flexibility, enabling more residents, especially those
who may typically find it difficult to attend an in-person public meeting, to weigh in on
important community issues and participate in civic engagement, while balancing their
other responsibilities, such as childcare; and

WHEREAS:

While City Hall has accessibility features, residents with disabilities, such as mobility
impairments, may find it easier to participate virtually, so expanding remote
participation is a way to amplify the voices of people with disabilities; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has a vested interest in ensuring participation in public meetings is as
convenient as possible, as doing so will encourage residents to lend their unique
perspectives and better inform the City Council’s decision-making process; and

WHEREAS:

Boston is currently considering making an option for remote participation permanent,
and Cambridge should also ensure remote participation does not end with the
pandemic; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee schedule a hearing to
consider amending the City Council rules to allow for a permanent remote
participation option at all public City meetings, and to ensure that the City commits to
closing the digital divide that currently makes such remote participation significantly
easier for those with technological access and savvy; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to explore options for including a
permanent remote participation option at all public meetings in the city, including, but
not limited to, the Planning Board and the BZA; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the Committee report back to the City Council in a timely manner.
