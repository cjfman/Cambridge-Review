WHEREAS:

Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in Cambridge and the largest
source statewide and the city’s Net Zero Action Plan and Demand Managements
transportation plans and the work of the Climate Committee and the Climate Crisis
Working Group all identify that in addition to reducing emissions, helping people
transition away from cars as a primary form of transportation would reduce deaths and
injuries resulting from crashes, traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution (which has a
disproportionate impact on low income neighborhoods); and

WHEREAS:

The 2019 Citizens’ Climate Convention in France concluded: “Heavier vehicles have a
much greater impact on the climate… They consume more fuel, require more materials
to build…The accidents they cause are more serious, braking emits more fine particles,
and they take up more public space, to the detriment of other, less polluting modes of
transport”; and

WHEREAS:

Cities like Paris and Montreal have recently taken steps to disincentivize the use of
particularly large and high polluting vehicles by pricing parking at a higher rate for
SUVs, which pollute more than smaller cars and add to parking scarcity, but have
become increasingly popular in recent years; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge has taken great strides to transition away from fossil fuel vehicles under
municipal control through its Clean Fleet Policy and the Council has recently taken
steps to incentivize car sharing through zoning changes; and

WHEREAS:

The fee for resident parking permits was raised in 2011 from $8 to $20 with a built in
raise to $25 in 2013, where the rate currently stands, despite requests by council to
increase the fee for residents who are not low-income; and

WHEREAS:

The parking permit fees, if possible, should reflect city values which could mean
exploring whether fees for low-income residents and EV owners should be the same as
other vehicles; and

WHEREAS:

Other cities have enacted creative solutions to incentive low carbon travel such as
limiting the number of parking permits for new residents, pricing parking permits at
higher rates for multiple vehicles, adjusting fees based on size and weight of vehicles,
and increasing fees for parking in urban core areas in order to encourage use of public
transit and non-single occupancy vehicle travel; and

WHEREAS:

In reviewing parking fees and regulations, Cambridge can incentivize low carbon
forms of travel, reduce the number of gas-powered vehicles on the road, reduce
parking scarcity, and increase public safety, while supporting goals of reducing
emissions citywide; now therefore be it
