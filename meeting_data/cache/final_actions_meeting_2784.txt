The southeast and southwest
elevations adopt metal panel
cladding in context with adjacent
buildings.
The distinct base, middle and
top are further accentuated by
the large picture window on the
south fa√ßade. The bottom of this
large picture window is aligned
with the setbacks that create
the ‚Äòbase‚Äô on the northeast and
northwest fa√ßades. Similarly, the
top of the window delineates
a ‚Äòtop‚Äô that is aligned with the
top that is expressed on the
northeast and northwest
fa√ßades.
441 Morgan uses variable
pilasters along its Gilmore Bridge
frontage to create a striking
visual ripple, with vertical cuts
and a picture window opening to
relate to the scale of the bridge.
The faceting and terraced
setbacks of the Leighton Street
and Morgan Avenue elevations
create a complementary iconic
presence on these frontages.
The prominent material palette
of glass and natural-toned
materials also creates a striking
presence on all sides.
