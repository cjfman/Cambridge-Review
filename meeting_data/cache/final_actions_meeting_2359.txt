PUBLIC COMMENT
Barb Strom, 3 Olive Place, spoke on Policy Order #10. She read from a prepared written statement in
support of the restoration of the area surrounding Jerry’s Pond.
Ann Stewart, 31 Wheeler Street, spoke on Policy Order #10. She stated that she supports this Policy
Order and she is pleased that the City Council is looking at the Alewife area. She thanked the City
Council for its’ previous Policy Order regarding trash bins in this area as that will help, especially on a
three-day weekend.
Elizabeth Camacho, 24 Corporal Burns Road, spoke on Policy Orders #3, #6, and #9. She stated her
support for Policy Order #3. She said that actions such as discounts, permit fees, tax abatements,
property rate increases for those over a certain income are small, but doable now. She said that their
accumulation moves the City to more affordable housing while supporting the lives of the residents
currently in the city. She said that another recommendation would be to allow people to put affordable
housing restrictions on their deeds. She said that she supports Policy Order #6. She said that such a
change citywide will have a huge impact on residents. She said that it is the responsibility of the elected
officials to reach out to the community regarding such a big change. She stated her support for Policy
Order #9. She said that net zero amendments are essential to know before further zoning changes take
place.
Lewis Weitzman, 124 Montgomery Street, spoke on Policy Order #10. He stated his support for this
Policy Order. He thanked the City Councillors who sponsored this Policy Order. He said that this an
issue where people think it can only be the way that it has always been. He said that this used to be one
of the highlights of North Cambridge. He is very happy that signage will be displayed to educate people.
He said that to create another city park would be a transcendental event. He said that it is clear that
people value water. He said that this could be a summer escape. He asked that the City Council not to
lose sight of this area as a park for enjoyment of all.
Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, spoke on Policy Orders #3 and #6. She read from a prepared written
statement stated her support for these Policy Orders.
Elie Yarden, 143 Pleasant Street, spoke on Policy Orders #8 and #12. He stated that all of these Policy
Orders are related to each other. He stated that he lives across the street from the transformer station,
but the point is that when he leaves his home, the noise levels are frightening. He said that the noise
levels from the heat exchanger are at the level that the earth is trembling. He said that inside the gate
there is a pickup truck with one person trying to figure out what is wrong. He said that the problem is
that he left the gate open for two days and anyone could have walked in. He said that the sidewalk is
more broken up than any other sidewalk in the neighborhood. He said that the fencing is what you
would expect to see on an industrial site. He said that in the adjacent buildings, there are 18 units of
housing which are lower-income housing. He said that there are a number of people affected by this.
He said that this is a residential neighborhood. He said that it should be treated as such.

John Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, spoke on Applications and Petitions #6 and Policy Order #7. He read from
a prepared written statement which include questions related to the banners and his support of Policy
Order #7.

Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, spoke on Policy Order #16. She noted that the beacon on the top
of the Sullivan Courthouse has been out for some time. She said that she would like to know why the
City of Cambridge is not angry that the Commonwealth is bullying the City into accepting a bad proposal
and letting this building fall apart. She said that the City should demand that the Commonwealth take
care of their building. She asked for City Council support. Regarding Policy Order #11, she noted that
she would like to remind people that there was funny business that went on with acquiring that parcel.
She said that some developer has pulled a dirty trick on the City. She said that it matters for the future.
Peter Valentine, 37 Brookline Street, stated that immense potential of the festival, the name Central
Square is inadequate to describe its potential. He suggested that the name be changed to Star Light
Square.
Charles Franklin, 160 Hampshire Street, stated that it is an interesting opportunity to have an art contest
for the banners in Inman Square. He stated his support for Policy Order #3. He said that these changes
will provide immediate relief and are easy, low-hanging fruit. He talked about the safety of Lyft and
Uber and he said that he directs his drivers not to stop at certain places. He stated his support for all
Policy Orders that relate to environmental safety. Regarding Policy Order #11, he said that it is getting
out of hand. He said Eversource wants to place a substation in a community neighborhood. He said
that there are plenty of other locations closer to underground powerlines that would make more sense
financially and environmentally. He said that if MIT and Alexandria want all power, they need to do
something about it.

CITY MANAGER’S NON-CONSENT AGENDA

authorizing the City Manager for transfer appropriations of available balances prior to the close of the
books for FY18-19.
CMA 2019 #149


PAGE 4

Jun 3, 2019

Councillor Carlone commented that there is no information about what the amount for each year is. City
Manager DePasquale explained that it depends on the settlement of the unions. He stated that if a union
has not settled the funding is put into the Salary Adjustment Account and when a department runs a
deficit the funding comes from this account. He noted that it is usually a big union that has not settled
and the amount varies, and this allows each budget to end the fiscal year in a positive. The remaining
balance goes to Free Cash; this is purely a bookkeeping matter.
The following order was now considered the question being on adoption, to wit:

2. Transmitting Communication from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation
of $44,483, which was received in energy rebates, to the Public Investment Fund Public Works
Department Extraordinary Expenditures account which will supplement the FY20 public investment
appropriation to support energy efficiency projects at school and City buildings.
CMA 2019 #150
Councillor Zondervan asked what specific projects this will fund, how are rebates received and are there
more. Ms. Katz stated that the rebate appropriations will supplement the resident sticker appropriation for
fiscal year 2020 and the planned projects involve LED lighting work in several school buildings,
including Cambridgeport, Fletcher-Maynard and Amigos Schools. She stated that the City is looking at
HVAC upgrade for the Moses Day Care Center. She stated that this is an Eversource process that is a
statewide process the most typical way of getting the rebates is that through state law the City is able to
contract directly with preferred vendors that have been approved by Eversource. The vendors audit
whatever buildings or whatever work the City is looking to do and as part of the work that is done, they
will put together the paperwork for the applications. She stated that this is available for private, small and
large businesses. Councillor Zondervan asked if there is potential to do more and get more rebates. Ms.
Katz responded in the affirmative. She noted that the reason that this is being called out now is that there
was a change in municipal account laws where in the past this has been done several times and were
appropriated directly to the Public Investment Fund. The change in municipal finance laws requires that
this now go through Free Cash and explicitly get appropriated the year after. This is the reason it is being
seen now.

8. A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report
Item Number 19-29, which requesting data on speed and vehicle counts on Garden Street between
Concord Avenue and Linnaean Street and identify potential measures to improve its pedestrian and
bicycle safety.
CMA 2019 #156
Vice Mayor Devereux commented that she is pleased that Shepard Street is on the five-year
Reconstruction plan because this will be an opportunity to look at this area. She stated that Shepard
Street presents opportunities to do traffic calming. She stated that regarding Garden Street she
appreciated the speed data that was gather in November 2017. She noted that between 33-40% of
vehicles appear to be traveling over 25 MPH. She stated that there is a need for traffic calming controls
on this street and the recommendation of adding the missing segment of a painted bicycle lane along the
length of Radcliffe building between Shepard and Linnaean Streets is a good recommendation. She
commented on the stretch of the street where resident parking could be removed and today there were
thirteen cars parked and most were commercial vehicles. She noted that four of the thirteen had resident
stickers. She recommended to see if the neighborhood is open to eliminating the resident parking. She
asked if the parking is removed along a length of Garden Street would this tend to make cars go faster if
there were not parked cars making the street seem narrower, so could flex posts be installed to make the
bicycle lane to prevent cars pulling over for drop off.
Councillor Carlone stated that 15% of the traffic was over 32 MPH. He noted that this is more than one
our of seven cars and the faster vehicles go the likelihood of not being able to stop in time. He stated that
he lives in the neighborhood and stated that at peak hour the traffic moves slowly because of all the line
cars but at non-peak hour the cars zoom down the street. He states that eventually the main arteries will
need to be reviewed to control the speed of cars. He stated that having a bike lane with a planted strip
would lessen the width of the road which would slow traffic down. He stated that a painted buffer zone is
great short-term, but long-term it does nothing to restrict or limit the speed of cars.

10. A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report
Item Numbers 19-33 and 19-34, regarding bicycle count data.
CMA 2019 #158
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that this looks like the trend is positive if having more bikes on the road as
positive and the interventions done on Western Avenue, Cambridge and Brattle Streets have correlated
with increased usage. She spoke about the counts going down in cold weather and if there are other
actions that this data indicates. She noted that the casino mitigation is mentioned in this. Mr. Barr spoke
about the casino mitigation; there will be come impact on Cambridge roads and the City has received
funding that will be used to purchase traffic counting devices which will be multimodal and provide
bicycling, pedestrian and vehicular data that will provide additional continuous data to make correlations
between weather and the time of the year. Vice Mayor Devereux asked can these count micro-mobility
devices. Mr. Barr responded that they can count them but unclear whether they can distinguish between a
bike and/or pedestrian. He noted that the bike and pedestrian counting is new, and the City is working in
partnership with the manufacturer of the devices that the City is purchasing to upgrade their algorithms.
Ms. Farooq spoke about the data and all of the City projects that install the before and after tells a good
story. She noted that all the trans post projects evaluations are moving in the direction that the City
intended them to move in.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he has faith that the machines will be able to distinguish us. He
commented on the increase in pedestrians on Western Avenue and a decrease in cars. He asked how this
would apply to other contemplated projects by the City. Ms. Farooq stated in terms of the pedestrian
traffic the pedestrian environment was as much a focus during the design process as was the bicycle and
vehicular traffic. She stated that the separated cycle track has created greater distance between the
pedestrians and moving traffic but there are many open space improvements, and this helps to enhance
the
sense on the street and the walkability. She stated that it is not common for the City to have this level of
right of way to do this level of intervention but where there is width available this enhances the
pedestrian environment. He asked with the new devices are more bicycle totems being added or just
switching to the new technology. Mr. Barr responded that the City is not anticipating adding any
Eco totems and that there are better cost benefit solutions available. The City will be moving toward
more
camera based technology which do more things.

11. A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report
Item Number 19-15, regarding the possibility of setting up an assistance fund/program to help lowincome elderly/disabled residents manage bed bug infestations.
CMA 2019 #159
Councillor Siddiqui stated that this issue is concerning especially when looking at landlord type. The
City needs to do due diligence and think about where these calls are coming from and how often. She
stated that some of these situations are occurring in affordable housing developments and ensure that


PAGE 7

there is a response. She stated that there is a tenant education piece to this. She stated that this is for low
income families. She stated that the response should be updated. She spoke about the cost involved and
habitability of the lease. She stated that she wanted to let people know their rights about bedbugs.
Mayor McGovern spoke about the cost involved with laundry and replacing furniture as well as the
emotional cost. He noted that this is a much bigger problem than people realize.

3. That the City Manager is requested to confer with the City Solicitor, Inspectional Services
Department and the Community Development Department to determine whether it is possible to
reduce or eliminate Building Permit Fees for 100% affordable housing development projects, through
an exemption or other means and investigate what types of real estate tax abatements are possible for
100% affordable housing moving forward.
POR 2019 #184
Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Carlone, Mayor McGovern
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that this was prompted by the Affordable Housing 101 it there were
suggestions made to control costs in context of the Overlay in trying to reduce land or acquisition costs
for affordable developers by giving them more density. She spoke about other ways to reduce their costs
is to look at the costs that the City has control over, such as building permits. She stated that the revenue
for building permits is being earmarked to go back to affordable housing. She stated that once a property
is deeded as 100% affordable housing its value for resale goes down, but it is not tax free.
Councillor Carlone stated that his is common sense and he thought that the City was already doing this.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that it is feasible to think about if this is worthwhile.
Mayor McGovern noted that to address the affordable housing crisis it will take a lot of different avenues.
He stated that a lot needs to be done; this is not a this or that type of issue. It is a complicated puzzle that
will take many pieces fitting together. He added that this is not in conflict with the Overlay; it is another
tool in the toolbox to address this issue.

6. That the City Manager work with the Community Development Department to set up a series of
informational and interactive Affordable Housing Overlay workshops in a variety of neighborhoods
to give residents the chance to foster a productive and informational dialogue with City staff.
POR 2019 #187
Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Mayor McGovern
Councillor Mallon stated that there have been five Housing Committee hearings on this topic. She stated
that these hearings have not provided an opportunity for residents to get their specific questions answered
and for a Citywide zoning effort it is imperative for the City to get feedback from residents and address
concerns moving through this process. She stated that bring Community Development Department staff
into the neighborhoods, providing child care and having experts available to answer questions by
residents it is important for the City to be intune with the community and come up with the best proposal
that works for everyone. She stated that these would be happening in tandem with the Ordinance
Committee hearing to be responsive to the community. She stated that the same process was used with
the Inclusionary Zoning.
Councillor Carlone stated that the supports outreach to the community. He stated all need to do what can
be done for affordable housing. He announced that he would be meeting with Community Development
Department staff to go over the holes in the Overlay with a view in mind of filling the holes before voting
on the proposal. He stated that more work is needed on the proposal. He commented that the City
Council has asked for an Ombudsman at Community Development and he thinks there is one in the
upcoming budget but wanted an urban design ombudsman, someone with an architectural background,
who could be hired in the future to do this on an on-going basis. Mayor McGovern noted that the
Housing Ombudsman position has been funded but has not been filled.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that the position is titled Housing Liaison and have been searching for a year to
fill the position.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she is concerned that this is happening so late in the process where the
City Council is now at the point of discussing the zoning. She noted that this has been discussed in the
context that there is a need for more affordable housing, but the level of detail has never been discussed.
She stated that the first time that the zoning will be discussed will be by the Planning Board on June 25,
2019. She stated that this will be the first time anyone with zoning experience will discuss the zoning.
This is being taken into the neighborhoods and again explain why affordable housing is important and all
will agree with this. It is still going to be very hard to explain to people what this zoning actually means.
She noted that no one is a zoning expert and it is difficult, and it is not the same discussion about
inclusionary which was based on a percentage. She noted that this has a bunch of different variables and
levers to pull and it is more complex. She stated that discussing this with the community is not a
substitute for having real zoning conversations and she is unclear how these will happen. She spoke
about the zoning timeline and the zoning train has left the station.
Mayor McGovern stated that this Policy Order is not a supplement for a zoning meetings and
conversations; that is what the Ordinance Committee is for. This is not meant to replace those
conversations. He spoke about the rumors about the Overlay and any opportunity that the City has to
answer questions by the community will provided the information needed. He spoke about the legal
timeline for zoning hearings.

Jun 3, 2019

Councillor Mallon stated that this is not just an idea if precisely why the community outreach is needed.
The zoning has been before the City Council since April. She stated that it is unusual to have zoning
during a Housing Committee hearing versus waiting for the Ordinance Committee. She stated that when
she is conversing with the general public, they have concerns and questions and because the zoning is
before the City Council the concerns could be discussed. She stated that if there are the same questions
and concerns from the community, they can be addressed in the Ordinance Committee.
Councillor Zondervan supported this approach but there is a fundamental problem with the way that the
conversation was occurring. He stated that the Overlay is a tradeoff where the City is asking residents to
give up their right to challenge this type of projects in exchange for knowing exactly what is going to be
built where and the second piece has not been provided which is the details on what is going to be built
where. The City does not have this information. He commented that certain questions can be answered
but this critical question cannot be answered which the public would need the answer to in order to agree
to this trade off. He stated that this is a fundamental challenge with the way that this process has been
approached. The City needs to do the work to come up with the information and present it to the public
so that they can evaluate the proposal.
Councillor Carlone stated that after the Planning Board hearing on June 25, 2019 and the Ordinance
Committee hearing scheduled for July 2, 2019 some of the holes will be filled or the missing links
connected more will be known.
Councillor Zondervan announced that the Health and Environment Committee has a hearing on June 4,
2019 on the Overlay to review the environmental impacts which are unknown. Councillor Carlone noted
that there are five other meetings scheduled for tomorrow.
Vice Mayor Devereux commented that she submitted a Policy Order that asked these questions that has
not been responded to.

Councillor Siddiqui stated that this is a matter of equity. She noted that Policy Orders have been adopted
in the past to clean up the trash and this is another step forward thinking about this area and some
achievable steps that can be taken. The City may not own the site but whatever can be done to make this
issue does not go away the better.
Councillor Zondervan stated that it will make a big difference to improve the area around Jerry’s Pond.
Vice Mayor Devereux commented that it is not Jerry’s Pond and not Jerry’s Pit.

obtain data from Eversource on electrical demand projections by year until at least 2030, including a
breakdown of commercial vs residential demand growth, as well as a ten-year historical look back.

(HERE INSERT ORIGINAL POLICY ORDER # 11)
Councillor Zondervan moved to amend the aforementioned order by adding Vice Mayor Devereux as a
co-sponsor to the order. The question now came on the amendment - and on a voice vote the amendment
Carried.
Councillor Zondervan spoke about a Health and Environment Committee hearing in which Eversource
was present at the hearing and were asked more questions. He stated that in general what seems to be
happening is that as the City is developed with more commercial development this increases the amount
of electrical supply that is needed in the City and Eversource notes that there is a need to add substations
or expand some of the existing ones. This has significant impacts on the residents, and it goes beyond the
proposed site. He stated that the Fulkerson Street site would have to be connected in many different
directions to other sites requiring extensive road work and trenching and disruption to the residents. He
added that as this is done more fossil fuel consumption is added. He stated that more than 80% of the
electricity is derived from fossil fuels. This is asking that this issue be reviewed and figure out based on
all the goals and programs in place how can the City ensure that this is not adding to the fossil fuel
emissions through this type of development. He stated that there is the technology and capability to build
buildings without increasing the supply of electricity that needs to come into the City. He stated that this
has been done at the Women’s Shelter on Massachusetts Avenue, the King School on Putnam Avenue
and with the King Open School Complex on Cambridge Street. He wanted to ensure that more
infrastructure is not being added that is inconveniencing the residents significantly and adding to climate
change. This is asking the City to look into strategies and come up with some data so that this can be
evaluated.
