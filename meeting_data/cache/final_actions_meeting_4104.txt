ADVISORY COMMITTEE
REGULAR MEETING
~ MINUTES ~

Monday, June 7, 2021

4:00 PM – 6:00 PM

Virtual Meeting

Overview
The Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) will meet to advance its purpose act on the Guiding
Principles for Community Benefits Funding set forth in the Community Needs Assessment.
I. CBAC’s Key Responsibilities
Recap from 5/3 meeting discussion:
• Support the Partnerships –
What can CBAC do to support each Partnership’s success?
• Monitor performance and track and document context in which Partnerships are operating –
Are projects moving forward in ways that are consistent with the scope we agreed to?
• Oversee and support the evaluation process and Health Resources in Action (HRiA) –
What are we learning throughout Implementation? What can CBAC do to support HRiA and its connections with
each Partnership?
• Hold CBAC vision and what systems change entails –
What can CBAC do to honor and hone its aspirations?
CBAC reactions from 5/3 review of responsibilities:
• Who controls future of Community Benefits Funds – how might CBAC engage/ share feedback with City
Councilors? And what is CBAC role relative to long-term sustainability?
• How might CBAC share lessons learned from Partnerships and engage in community-wide conversation about
the use of the Funds?
• Be explicit about communicating back to Partnerships and public with the information we gather – who do we
share it with, and how?
• When will the Citywide Needs Assessment need to be redone? CBAC has unique insights – what role might it
play?
o And it would be useful to understand where the Needs Assessment fits in the scope and sequence of
how we do things
• CBAC’s responsibilities also entail supporting collaboration within and across Partnerships, seeing the City’s role
differently, and the ultimate goal of helping residents get what they need to live and thrive
o The goal is to help the Partnerships succeed vs. just being a gatekeeper to resources
• In re: CBAC’s responsibility to “Hold the vision and what systems change entails” – revisit that, both what that
vision is, and that it may have changed from what it was originally, both due to COVID and what Partnerships
face
Considering CBAC’s role:
• A lot to tackle – seems like a tall order
• How do Monitor performance and track and document context in which Partnerships are operating live together
at the same time?
• What is the time frame for answering questions? And some of these things can change over time – what is
process for updating?
• Struck by how much work CBAC did, decisions that we made – and that these decisions were only for first
round, not for all time

Beyond first round of funding, consider what future holds and potential timeline – make guesses for when
additional funds are coming and engage City Councilors as makes sense
With all the development, increase the size of pot to help and address disparities
CBAC funding will grow and allow us to build an infrastructure – each taking consideration of steps forward
Make opportunities for listening and connecting with Partnerships directly
Focus on operational/ Partnership level – and consider other elements of model we hope to create
Work that nonprofits have done – much more than no-wrong door approach, so that someone looking for
services gets them and then is on a pathway
Lessons learned from collaborative work in 2020-21 and beyond and subsequent cycles – will even more
collaboration among nonprofits and fewer duplicate efforts mean enhanced outcomes?
Dissemination of proven practices among Partnerships to benefit residents
More of the people that got support through system – they should decide what happens next
Need some way to have voice of target population represented on CBAC and involved in decision-making roles
Advocacy piece – gaps in resident experiences, opportunity to lift up voices and spread awareness about great
income inequality and disparities are
Systems change – develop more of an advocacy and policy change role to amplify impact

How CBAC can respond to Cambridge context and needs:
• Noticing how unbelievably important context is – we were hit by something that changed what everyone was
doing
• Coming to terms with affordable housing crisis – helping people most in need, combining resources to help
those in need across systems
• Housing stability serious issue – 6000 families applied for 20 affordable units
• Focus on true sustainability for nonprofits – funders pressure nonprofits to keep overhead low; set up funds to
allow nonprofits to pay staff wages to let them live in Cambridge
• Extend and expand great work of nonprofits – schools and nonprofits working to make difference
• Work toward a far more seamless situation – people who need help get it in streamlined and stress-free process
• People should be able to walk around Kendall Square and have it be as diverse and inclusive, and feel as
accepted, as rest of Cambridge – get past “us vs. them” to get to “we”, and people on both sides change
perspectives; everyone that lives and works in Cambridge should feel comfortable everywhere
Additional information that may be useful to CBAC:
• Health Starts at Home – a multi-year partnership model that CBAC looked at to inform our strategy just released
its final evaluation report
o Evaluation may be instructive to CBAC; important to note that project did not start during Covid
• City’s new project around guaranteed annual income – what are implications for CBAC?

II. CBAC’s Vision
Future gazing: Celebrating 15 years of CBAC!
It is June 7, 2032, and we have gathered to celebrate the 15-year anniversary of the Community Benefits Advisory
Committee! Please consider:
• CBAC and its successes…
• The unique impacts CBAC has helped bring about in Cambridge…
• How people living in Cambridge that have benefited from CBAC-supported efforts are thriving…
• How nonprofits, City departments, and other partners and stakeholders are doing their work and engaging with
each other…
• How systems and structures have changed to help people living in Cambridge…
• What else has changed/ is changing…
Refine or affirm CBAC’s vision: What (else) CBAC aspires to accomplish over time
CBAC has articulated as its longer-term vision for Community Benefits Funds within the Overarching Logic Model:
Robust, widespread coordination and integration between non-profits, service providers, and other partners,
including public and corporate sectors, is used to deliver services to vulnerable families across Cambridge
• The system-wide capacity is sufficient and successful in meeting needs of vulnerable families

Innovative and/or successful practices are readily adopted across the system in Cambridge
Broad cross-sector collaboration is the norm in Cambridge

Cambridge families are satisfied and resilient in their housing, economic, and behavioral health status and are
successful in their work, school, and family lives
• Families have the ability and resources to maintain affordable and safe housing that meets their needs and
desires
• Families are economically autonomous and mobile
• Families have the capacity to sustain and build upon on their own welfare
• Families are empowered to self-advocate for themselves and their communities in city-wide planning processes
and policy change
CBAC’s role
• Collaborating in strengthening partnerships to provide supports for residents, with CBAC as spearhead – in
supporting, guiding, being a resource and collaborator in bring resources to residents
• CBAC able to sponsor and bring in additional resources for multiple rounds of funding – variety of partners for
funding and advocacy… CBAC as start-up for integrated system, basically a one-stop system that is transparent
and easy for people to find help that they need to advance self-sufficiency, intergenerational wealth transfer,
and housing stability
• CBAC made the choice to focus first round of funding on families and not individuals
Impact on residents
• Systems streamlined to support housing stability, people stay in housing
• People accessing services in more timely way – mental health/ counseling, food, housing, financial insecurity –
help match people with help, better and easier help, leading to better pathways
o Housing issue is intractable – requires combined effort of government and partners
• Strengthening of partnerships between education and nonprofits – smoother and more seamless to make
progress in fields that schools have not moved the needle
o Race matters – e.g., math scores in CPS show consistent disparities
• Results – family-level data/ experience… CBAC heard in the beginning income level, consistency of 15% living at
or below poverty – say we have moved the needle on 15%...
• Partnerships having holistic approach – no wrong door
• A closely knit system/ network of nonprofits is great to have – and don’t want that as key goal, that people find
resources; services are not sufficient
Focus on systems change
• Build a deeper understanding of systems in place that impact people in different ways
o It is greater than system-wide capacity – is it perpetuating inequality that we have?
o Let’s build system vs. reflecting on systems we have
• Embrace antiracist approach to our work and push forward at systemic level – many things we could do in
current context
• We wouldn’t have be having this conversation in the same way if not for Covid pandemic that is novel and racial
pandemic that is not… bringing heightened awareness to CBAC – and wanting to applaud us for moving forward,
being resilient and having to do work through Covid and other systemic issues – yet issues of systemic racism
persist
Community Benefits Funds and funding
• With regard to other funding, other actors, corporate sector and public sector – momentum towards more
holistic change – create opportunities for investment, increased resources, and advocacy
• System in place that is clear and transparent for how to deal with mitigation funds that come in
• Increased perspective on tradeoffs and benefits of development
• Diversifying funding sources – where does this fit within the rationale/ charge/ scope of CBAC’s work?
• Shift our thinking that the solution about services/ capacity to provide services; it is about systems change
o Bullet 1 (The system-wide capacity is sufficient and successful in meeting needs of vulnerable families) – the
system is built on racism;

What are ways to think about advocacy, which is not what we were set up to do, and ways to reflect back to City
Council?

III. Considering Where We Are With Partnerships and Next Steps
Planning Phase – 6 months (June 2019 – December 2019)
• October 2019: CBAC convening with Partnerships
• November 2019: Partnerships submit Planning Phase Progress Reports to CBAC
Implementation Phase – 3 years (March 2020 – March 2023)
→ YEAR 1 (March 2020 – March 2021)
– March 2020: Partnerships send letter to City Manager in response to Covid-19 requesting:
(1) Increase the current Community Benefits Fund grants to a 4-year commitment, providing partnerships with the
flexibility to respond to immediate crisis needs in the near term as well as project implementation in the longer term; (2)
Expedite the release of funds to organizations with 85% released up front and the remaining 15% contingent upon
reporting at an agreed-upon date
In response, the City Manager agrees to allow partnerships to update their Year 1 plans for how funds will be used to
deliver services and to receive up to 25% of Year 1 grant funds up front
– April 2020: Partnerships meet with CBAC city staff as follow up to March letter;
each Partnership submits revised a Scope of Services for Year 1
– October 2020: CBAC check-in with each Partnership
– February 2021: Partnerships submit Year 1 review & Year 2 intentions
– March 2021: CBAC meets with Port Arise Institute & Strengthening Families Together Project;
CBAC decides to advance Year 2 grant extensions to all Partnerships, and meet again with those two Partnerships in 3
months to check in on progress.
→ YEAR 2 (March 2021 – March 2022)
→ YEAR 3 (March 2022 – March 2023)
Responding to two Partnerships CBAC met with in March 2021:
• If we said we will check in with the Partnerships, we should, and that we ensure that we get 3-month refresher on areas of
interest – with heads up to Partnerships
• Ask for submission of some sort vs. requiring gathering
• Revisit flags and highlights from each – two we brought in was due to questions that surfaced, and a desire for deeper
discussion, and the manner in which their plans were significantly more different than approved plans
• Time of bringing folks together could be better spent by meeting with other two partnerships
Considering all four Partnerships:
• Thinking back to where we found ourselves in Oct 2020 as we looked to year 2 – we could have provided more direction in
December/ January
At end of summer, meet with all four; we will be halfway through year 2, and we will have a good sense then of where they
are
o Yes – bring in all 4 groups at 6 months
• Role of supporting Partnerships includes responsibility to raise questions – that is part of good stewardship and support –
and there is a difference between funders that pose questions vs. posing concerns
• External dynamics and changing context – important to check-in about these with and for Partnerships
• Partnerships continuing to have ongoing dialogue – make sure it is a two-way street
CBAC decision: Meet with all 4 Partnerships for 6-month check-in and follow-up with two Partnerships to inform them

IV. Public Comment
•

Broadening thinking about Community Benefits – raise bar around Black and Brown children and the gaps, what other
resources can we engage and how do we get universities involved; reenvision Community Benefits in terms of more holistic
approach including entrepreneurship – e.g., the price of renting retail space is prohibitive – offer affordable retail rental for

targeted communities; also – artists lofts, space for artists as entrepreneurs, and infrastructure to support entrepreneurs as
workplace opportunities for youth – e.g., commercial kitchen/ food economy in Cambridge
In thinking about future rounds of funding and Needs Assessment – what is the structure that would need to be created?
And important to reflect on what is currently working and not in the system, barriers to families, and how institutions are
interacting – and weave in lessons learned from Covid relief grant
Apply an antiracist lens to this work – are there things that would change if that lens were prioritized? How could things
look different?
