Executive Summary

What is the
capital
budget?

§ The City of Cambridge’s capital spending/public investment is a direct reflection of
its strategic priorities and community needs
§ The capital budget differs from the operating budget; it supports multi-year
projects and acquisition or improvement of long-term assets
§ Bond issuances (debt) are a major lever for funding public investments

Role of debt
in funding the
capital
budget

FY25 capital
budget
timeline &
decisions

§ Bond issuances can lag appropriations by several years, and associated debt
service costs affect the City’s operating budget for many years
§ The City sets its internal debt policies to obtain the best long-term financial
advantage to the City and its residents
§ The City has increased the amount it has bonded in recent years, primarily for
schools and sewers
§ Looking ahead, there are large public investment priorities competing for
consideration in the next five fiscal years
§ Today we plan to share an overview of the capital spending/public investment and
considerations around City debt, to lay the groundwork for future discussions

The City finances major capital budget projects primarily through bonds
to add budget stability and spread cost out of over the life of the project

Capital Budget
City Council Loan Authorization
Bonding Schedule
Borrow Funds / Issue Debt

§ Requires loan authorizations to issue bonds
for specific projects
§ Once the City Council authorizes (approves)
a loan order for a capital project (typically
with adoption of the Capital Budget, but
sometimes off-cycle), the City can then
borrow funds up to the amount authorized
§ The City does not need to borrow all of the
authorized funds at one time, which is
reason for a multi-year bond schedule
§ A bond issuance will incur debt service costs
(repayment of principal + interest) for the life
of the bond – a term of 5, 10, or 20 years

City Council approves a $90M loan authorization for a construction project for the FY25 capital budget
Starting in FY25, 10-year bonds are issued for this project ($30M / year for 3 years) at a 3% true interest cost (based on
construction spending)
Each of the 3 bond issuances then incur 10 years of debt service costs (repayment of debt principal + interest), starting the
year after the associated bond issuance. Assume that debt principal is repaid evenly across a 10-year period

Note that the illustrative graphic does not include entirely of payments associated with FY26 & FY27 bond issuances.
