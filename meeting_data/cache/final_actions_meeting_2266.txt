To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article

In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Pursuant to Council Orders issued on 9/17/18 following the 8/13/18 Ordinance Committee
Meeting, City staff have made the below-referenced proposed revisions to the draft Surveillance
Ordinance following the 8/13/18 Ordinance Committee hearing.
These proposed revisions to the draft Ordinance were made with the view in mind of considering
all of the suggestions/proposed revisions from Mayor McGovern, Councilor Kelley, other
members of the City Council, and comments submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union of
Massachusetts (the “ACLU”) and members of the public. After giving careful consideration to
all of the proposed revisions, City staff recommend making additional proposed changes to the
draft Ordinance are as follows:
1. In order to accomplish gender neutrality, references to his/her and other such gender
specific pronouns throughout the draft Ordinance have been removed and replaced with
the name of the Office/Officer (i.e., City Manager, Police Commissioner, etc.), rather
than a pronoun.
2. The definitions section (Section 2.128.020) has been streamlined by removing lists of
requirements, i.e., Annual Surveillance Report, Surveillance Technology Impact Report,
Surveillance Use Policy, and Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy, and
including those requirements in the respective sections of the draft Ordinance governing
submission of such reports to the City Council, i.e., Sections 2.128.030(C) and (D),
2.128.050(B), and 2.128.060(B).
3. The exceptions and exemptions previously included within the definition of Surveillance
Technology in Section 2.128.020(B) of the draft Ordinance have been moved to Section
2.128.070, which relates only to exceptions and exemptions.
4. In order to limit the use of Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances by the

Packet Pg. 40

2.3

Police Department, Section 2.178.040 has been revised to read “for a period not to
exceed 90 days.” This means that for each time the Police Commissioner seeks to use
Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances, the use cannot exceed 90 days
without getting Council approval. Section 2.128.030 (A) has also been revised to make
clear that only the Police Department may use Surveillance Technology in Exigent
Circumstances.
5. The sentence “To the extent the City Manager determines that approving or disapproving
the Surveillance Use Policy would unlawfully obstruct the investigative or prosecutorial
functions of the Police Department, the City Council shall simply receive and discuss the
applicable portions of the Surveillance Use Policy” has been deleted from Section
2.128.050(C) as requested.
6. The phrase “Cameras installed in or on a police vehicle” has been removed from the
exemptions outlined in Section 2.128.070(3). As a result, the Police Commissioner will
have to submit a request for approval in the event the Police Commissioner determines
that cameras should be installed in or on police vehicles.
7. The requirement to file a notice with the City Clerk in advance of seeking injunctive
relief in court has been removed from Section 2.128.080(B). This means that a person
seeking relief for an alleged violation of the Surveillance Ordinance can go directly to
court to file an action for injunctive relief.
8. Section 2.128.080(C) has been revised to incorporate by reference the whistleblower
protections afforded to Massachusetts public employees under G. L. c. 149, § 185 (the
“Massachusetts Whistleblower Act”) in order to address the request to have
whistleblower protections in the draft Ordinance.
I am very pleased to submit the enclosed draft Ordinance to the City Council. The draft
Ordinance before you is the culmination of diligent work over the past several years by the City
Council, City staff, representatives of the ACLU and members of the public who worked
collaboratively to revise the provisions of the draft Ordinance consistent with feedback from
members of the City Council, submissions from the ACLU, and public comments at various
Council meetings and Committee hearings. I believe the above-referenced revisions
appropriately address the City Council’s concerns, and comments submitted by the ACLU and
members of the public at the 8/13/18 Ordinance Committee hearing and throughout this severalyear long process, and I am proud to recommend ordination of this version of the draft
Ordinance.
Very truly yours,

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I write to provide the City Council with a summary of various proposed amendments (the
“Proposed Amendments”) to Section 12.16.170 of the Municipal Code (the “Street Performers
Ordinance”). A redlined and clean copy of the proposed amended Street Performers Ordinance
is attached hereto for your reference.
These Proposed Amendments are recommended based on feedback from members of the street
performing community (“buskers”) and Community Arts Advocates, Inc. (“Community Arts
Advocates”) to the Arts Council, and public comment at numerous Council hearings and Council
Committee hearings over the past three years. I believe that the Proposed Amendments strike the
appropriate balance between enabling Arts Council and City staff to more effectively enforce
noise and other regulations in the Street Performers Ordinance and encouraging the street
performing/busking community to contribute to the vibrancy of our neighborhoods.
After careful review and consideration of the input and feedback provided by various
stakeholders, including residents, local street performers/buskers, businesses and retail district
partners, Community Arts Advocates, and members of the City Council, I recommend the
following Proposed Amendments with the strong support of the street performing/busking
community:
• the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(C)(1) expands the definition of
“Perform” to include reciting (such as poetry reading) and creation of visual artworks;
• the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(E)(1) provides for a 50% reduction in
the cost for individual Permits by lowering the cost for an individual permit from $40 to
$20 (the previous fee of $40 had not been increased since the Street Performers
Ordinance was adopted by the City Council twenty (20) years ago);

Packet Pg. 75

2.4

• the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(E)(1) also permits a waiver of the
Permit fee in its entirety for homeless or otherwise indigent persons with submission of
an affidavit of homelessness or indigency from a homeless shelter or the applicant;
• the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(E)(4) allows for a 75% reduction in the
cost of a Permit for a Performing Group by lowering the total cost for a Permit for a
Performing Group from $160 to $40;
• the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(F)(1) permits a Police Officer or Arts
Council staff to allow inspection of a Permit. Refusal of a Performer to allow such
inspection may result in revocation of the Permit;
• the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(G)((1)(a) prohibits Performances from
interfering with uses authorized through park permits, special events permits or with the
regular use of playgrounds, and expands the prohibition of performances within 100 feet
of churches while in session to include other houses of worship such as synagogues,
temples, and mosques;
• in Subsection 12.16.170(G)(2), the times permitted for performances in the area of the
intersection of JFK Street and Mount Auburn Street (Winthrop Park) have been amended,
and the prohibition of performances in Quincy Park and Central Square in
12.16.170(H)(1)(b) and (c) have been removed; and
• a new provision would provide that the Arts Council has the authority to promulgate rules
and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the Ordinance under Subsection
12.16.170(J).
These proposed amendments address the aspirations and concerns expressed throughout the
multi-year review of the Street Performers Ordinance and I believe will achieve the desired goals
of making street performing/busking more accessible and affordable, while at the same time
providing for a more efficient permitting process. Please note that members of the street
performing/busing community and Community Arts Advocates have indicated to the Arts
Council and the City Council that they support charging Permit fees, as they believe that
charging such permit fees helps to retain the integrity of the Street Performers Ordinance and
encourage compliance with the Ordinance. The street performing community and Community
Arts Advocates support the Arts Council’s recommendation to reduce the fees for Permits;
however, these groups believe that the City should not abolish fees altogether. Moreover, the
imposition of fees for this permitting scheme offset the expense to the Arts Council and the City
in administering the Street Performers Ordinance.
Please note that the Arts Council issues Permits for performances on a calendar-year basis and
therefore new Permits for calendar year 2019 will soon have to be issued. In order for the Arts
Council staff to be able to timely incorporate any changes to its licensing scheme into the 2019
permits, the Council would need to act on these amendments before the end of this calendar year.
Very truly yours,

A. Introduction.
The City Council of the City of Cambridge (the “City”) finds that the existence in the City of street performers
provides a public amenity that enhances the character of the City and seeks to encourage such performances to
the extent that they do not interfere with the reasonable expectations of residents to the enjoyment of peace and
quiet in their homes, the ability of businesses to conduct their businesses uninterrupted, or for the free flow of
traffic and movement on public ways, public sidewalks, and other public pedestrian areas (collectively hereinafter
referred to as “Public Ways”). This Section seeks to balance the interests of the performers with those of the
residents and businesses of the City.
B. Enforcement.

pantomime; juggling; magic; dancing; reading; reciting; puppetry; and sidewalk art (working with non-permanent,
water-soluble media, such as chalk, pastels, or watercolors, directly on the pavement).
“Perform” shall not include the production of items for sale, such as jewelry making or craft production, but may
include the creation of visual artworks that are demonstrated live in a large-scale performative manner.
2. "Performer" means a person who has obtained a Permit pursuant to this Section.
3. A “Performing Group” means a group of four or more Performers who perform together, are identified as such
in their permit application, and noted as such on their Permits. All Performers acquiring a Permit for a group
performance must perform as a group; group Permits do not authorize individual performance.
4. "Public Areas" means Public Ways, parks, plazas, and playgrounds.
D. Prohibition.
1. No person may perform in a Public Area without a Permit issued by the Arts Council pursuant to Subsection E
of this Section.
2. In accordance with the Cambridge Fire Department’s (the “Fire Department’s”) rules promulgated by the
Cambridge Fire Chief (the “Fire Chief”) pursuant to his authority under G. L. c. 148, § 28 and the Code of
Massachusetts Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the use of fire in a public assembly, including, but not
limited to, street performing, is not permitted in the City.
E. Permit.
1. A Permit shall be issued by the Arts Council to each applicant in exchange for a completed application and a fee
of twenty dollars($20); the Permit application fee shall be waived in its entirety for applicants who request an
application fee waiver based on indigence or homelessness and submit an affidavit signed under pains and

required to obtain an individual Permit in person. Performing Groups of four or more Performers shall pay the
sum total of forty dollars ($40) in exchange for one permit per person in the group regardless of the total number
of Performers in the Performing Group. In no event shall any Performing Group, identified as such in their permit
application and noted as such on their permits, be charged more than forty dollars ($40) total for permits for
group members.

5. Upon issuing a Permit, the Arts Council shall give the Performer a copy of this Section.
6. If a Performer loses the Performer’s Permit, one replacement Permit per calendar year may be obtained for a
fee of fifteen dollars ($15).
F. Display of Permit.
1. A Performer shall clearly display the Performer’s Permit while performing, and shall allow inspection of the
Permit by any Cambridge Police Officer (“Police Officer”) or staff person of the Arts Council upon request. Refusal
to allow inspection of a Permit upon request by a Police Officer or staff person of the Arts Council, or refusal to
display a Permit, may result in the revocation of the Permit.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-85, regarding a report on the feasibility of appointing an
advisory committee to work through resilience elements raised during the Envision process and through
the Brown Petition, I have appointed a Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force representing a variety of
community stakeholders and perspectives as noted in the above-mentioned policy order.
This task force is being created to build upon the City’s 2017 Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment
(CCVA) and ongoing Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience (CCPR) planning efforts and to
advise me on development standards that can be incorporated into the Zoning Ordinance that would result
in new development that is more resilient to climate change risks. Specifically, this group will focus on
zoning recommendations that address the climate change impacts identified in the CCVA:
• Anticipated flooding due to sea level rise, storm surge, and precipitation.
• Anticipated rise in temperatures exacerbated by the urban heat island effect.
This work will be citywide in scope but may result in different requirements for different parts of the city
based on geographic differences in vulnerability to climate change impacts.
The task force is expected to begin work in January 2019 and will meet approximately monthly over the
course of a year. The task force will work collaboratively with City staff and consultants. Jeff Roberts,
CDD’s Director of Zoning & Development will be the project manager. The following individuals have
been appointed to the task force.

City Council: City Manager Agenda #9 (2018 #295) DCR improvements for BU Rotary

Dear Mayor McGovern, Vice Mayor Devereux, City Councillors:
We certainly hope that the qualifiers described in this item do not limit DCR, MassDOT or the city from making
improvements before FY20 that would alleviate the severe traffic back-ups at the B.U. Rotary that worsened this summer
when the B.U. Bridge was restriped.
It’s great that MassDOT reps, Joe Barr of Cambridge Traffic & Parking and DCR are focusing on this after prodding from
Cambridgeport Neighborhood Assoc. and with enormous help from Steve Kaiser.
But, how about Cambridge assigning a police officer (at least sometimes) to Waverly St. at rush hour to stop box-blocking
drivers who prevent Granite St. drivers, including buses, from even accessing the Rotary or turning left up Brookline St.?
And, other short-term improvement suggestions: Don’t-Block-the-Box signs & signs directing traffic exiting Memorial Dr.westbound. (Yes, signs!)
Sincerely,
Walter McDonald and Carol O’Hare

save trees wherever possible!

Trees are not only beautiful and shade-giving in the summer but they are always health-giving in these days of
intensiftying CO2 emissions--not to mention increased traffic all over Cambridge. Please protect them from developers'
plans--even if those developers are the (misnamed) Department of Conservation and Recreation. There are trees along
the Magazine St. Beach, the west end playing fields, and across from the Micro Center thbat are apparently slated for
destruction--56 fine trees! Please vote to save them. Build paths or park around them and let them flourish!
Thank you for your attention

Magazine Beach trees

I read with concern of the plan to destroy healthy trees in this area. I have seen too often the apparently over-zealous
destuction of a number of seemngly healthy trees in my own area of the city and the consequent loss of amenity to
contemplate this with equanimity.
Please reconsider this step.

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
WHEREAS:

The United States Federal Government is currently accepting public comment through
December 10, 2018 on the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed “Public
Charge” rule change; and

WHEREAS:

The Public Charge rule change, which is being orchestrated by the Trump
Administration, would discourage immigrants from accessing critical nutritional
assistance programs, healthcare programs, and public housing programs by making it
significantly more difficult for recipients of these programs to obtain Green Cards or
be reunited with family members; and

WHEREAS:

This Public Charge rule change would likely scare away many individuals who have
even unambiguous citizenship from applying to these programs, out of the fear that
enrolling in them would ultimately make them a target of a hostile federal government;
and

WHEREAS:

Millions of families and individuals contribute to these public assistance programs
through their taxes, and rely upon them to meet a minimum standard of living, and the
effects of this rule change could be chilling and have tremendously negative
repercussions throughout Cambridge and Massachusetts if enacted; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in staunch opposition to the Department of
Homeland Security’s proposed “Public Charge” rule change; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Council strongly urges members of the public to voice their opposition to
this rule change by the December 10, 2018 deadline; and be it further

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of
this resolution to the Massachusetts Delegation to Washington, DC on behalf of the
