To the Honorable, the City Council:

To further help control the rodent population in the city, an appropriation of $1,500,000 from
Free Cash to the Public Works Public Investment Account is requested for the purpose of
purchasing and distributing standardized trash barrels to all residential buildings in the City’s
trash program.
In providing standardized trash receptables the City will then have in place City provided trash,
recycling and organics toters. Requiring the use of good quality, adequately sized trash
receptables is an important additional tool in the City’s continuing effort to reduce the rat
population. Additionally, the provision of such will then allow residents further divert recyclable
materials from trash and move the city further along in its Zero Waste goals.
Based on recommendations in the city’s Zero Waste Master plan, adding standardized trash
receptacles to our program will provide the following benefits to both employees and residents:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Reduces potential for Rodents.
Increases worker safety as containers can be emptied with semi-automated collection
compared to manual collection.
Has potential for decreased workers compensation claims with better ergonomics and
reduced lifting of containers/bags.
Increases collection efficiency with a reduced number of containers.
Increases diversion from trash to recycling and organics.
Improves aesthetics of sidewalks with fewer containers at the curb and with a smaller
footprint,
Reduces trash spillage

Similar to the roll out of single stream recycling toters, residents will be given a receptacle(s)
based on the size of their property. Understanding the limited space that properties in densely
populated sections of the city have, every effort will be made to provide receptacles that have
enough capacity while minimizing their footprint. The program will also be flexible enough to
provide smaller or larger receptacles to residents who request different sizes. The intention at this
time is not to limit the size toter given to residents but rather to work with residents to ensure that
the toter(s) they are given are large enough to avoid overflow situations and small enough to

Packet Pg. 36

1.4

ensure that they can properly accommodate them at their homes. The picture below illustrates
the various sizes we expect to offer residents.

At this time, given the disruption associated with COVID it may take longer than expected to
procure and distribute these receptacles. Based on a conservative schedule, we estimate that
these materials will be distributed to residential buildings in the city by the spring of 2022.

March 29, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am herby requesting an appropriation of $335,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment
Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to purchase and install Big Belly solar
compactors on Cambridge Street between Inman Square and Lechmere Station.
Funds will provide for 40 new compactors along Cambridge Street which will replace the
existing Victor Stanley barrels in the area. This investment will significantly improve the overall
appearance of the commercial district, reduce rodent activity along the street, and improve the
collection efficiency in this neighborhood.
Big Belly compactors transform public litter collection into an efficient, clean and well managed
operation. These dual-purpose receptacles: one side is a solar-powered trash compactor and the
other is a single-stream recycling receptacle will increase the capacity of litter bins on
Cambridge Street and will quadruple the number of recycling receptacles in the area. The latest
Big Belly receptacles are of a heavier gauge material and can be opened by floor peddle as well
as by a chute handle. Because these bins compact trash and thus have approximately 5 times the
capacity of regular trash bins, they need to be emptied less frequently than traditional trash bins.
They also transmit data about fullness levels, notifying staff when specific bins need to be
emptied. This enables a “before full” service by City staff and vehicles, thus reducing operating
costs for collection as more such bins are installed across the city over time.
Finally, given the solid nature of these facilities they have been shown to deter rodent activity in
the areas they have been deployed in. The installation of these facilities further amplifies the
City’s commitment to working with the community in addressing this public health issue.

Re:

AR 19-58 Working with the Recycling Advisory Committee as well as
other stakeholders to draft an ordinance banning single use plastic
items in Cambridge.

DATE:

March 23, 2021

In response to the above referenced Council Order, please be advised of the following:
The Department of Public Works (DPW) has worked closely with Recycling Advisory Committee
(RAC), other city entities, as well as business owners and residents to evaluate a ban on single
use plastics similar to what other communities have implemented. Building on the experience
of the Polystyrene Ordinance, DPW has taken a similar approach to evaluating a single-use
plastic ban. DPW conducted a business survey, studied plastics recyclability, and examined
environmental lifecycle analyses.
The process began in 2019 with the Council Order requesting DPW provide feedback on a
single-use plastics ordinance, such as that in Brookline, MA or Berkeley, CA. Both consumers
and businesses want to reduce plastics, reduce waste and protect the environment. DPW has
concluded that, at this time, a blanketed single-use plastics ban is not necessarily in the city’s
best interest. Rather, DPW suggests that the paradigm should remain reduce & reuse and not
necessarily paper vs plastic and that our ordinances should be further refined to reflect
additional measures to achieve such.
Survey to Cambridge Businesses
Cambridge DPW sought feedback from food-service businesses on a proposed ban on singleuse plastics such as utensils, clamshell containers, cups, lids and straws. Conducted in Fall
2019, approximately 25% of food-service businesses in Cambridge responded to the survey.
Most acknowledged the concerns associated with the environmental impact of single-use
products. However, it should also be noted that many were opposed to an ordinance banning
single use plastic items without a clear path for businesses to continue providing high-quality
food/beverages services in a financially sustainable way.
Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: DPW single use plastics 3 29 21_ (CMA 2021 #58 : Awaiting Report 19-58 response single use plastics)

1.6.a

One business stated, “after the Styrofoam ban, my costs [increased from $0.01 to
$0.18-0.26 per container]. Meanwhile a customer will complain if their meal goes up a
quarter. Please consider small businesses … we operate on a small enough margin without
adding more restrictions.”
Additionally, many expressed concerns, that alternative products don’t perform as well
as plastics. For example, one business owner stated, “paper doesn't hold the hot items we
mainly sell. We have tried paper and customers complain of leakage, thus requesting refunds.”
Indeed, it was also pointed out to us that many of the alternative products typically identified
as reasonable alternatives were also challenging in terms of natural degradation and
recyclability.
Finally, many businesses indicated that they have implemented changes to reduce
single-use consumption. One business stated, “We use sip-through lids for iced beverages but
keep straws for folks who request them. We offer discounts to customers who bring their own
reusable containers, but many customers still don't and want single-use cups”
The environmental impact of takeout containers
In trying to provide a broader context for this discussion and in further reflecting on the axiom:
reduce & reuse, we recognize that the environmental impact of a product is more complex
than its recyclability; it includes upstream impacts (i.e. extraction, manufacturing,
transportation) as well as downstream impacts (i.e. disposal, recycling, landfill, or digestion)
and therefore, not consuming a single-use item in the first place, is the best policy of all. The
United Nations’ Lifecycle Institute conducted a meta-analysis of lifecycle assessments for
various takeout materials. Their conclusions are that there are not clear winners between
plastics, paper, or aluminum packaging. Rather, they suggested taking a more thorough
systems thinking approach to determining how to reduce the environmental impact.
According to Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality using compostable materials (and
composting them) was found to result in higher environmental impacts than either using noncompostable materials. Furthermore, compostable containers are not desired by our current
food waste processor, Waste Management’s CORe. Increasingly, other composting facilities
are finding it difficult to manage compostable service ware too.

Currently, Casella’s Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in
Charlestown accepts rigid plastic containers such as jugs,
tubs, bottles, cups, and other food-service containers. All
these plastics are recycled in North America after they’re
sorted and baled in Charlestown. The market for recyclable
plastics is presently strong, contrary to some news reports. Since 2017, more than $5.3 billion
has been invested in plastics recovery in the US. On average, plastics are among the most

“financially” valuable part of the City’s recycling program, not that finance, in and of itself
should be the determining factor. Finally, it should be acknowledged that while the City of
Cambridge has a very successful recycling program, based on our waste sorts, there remains a
15% portion of our waste that could be recycled and a not insignificant portion of that is
plastic.
What are Cambridge’s options?
Although, DPW does not recommend a single-use plastics ban, there are pieces of the Berkeley
and Brookline ordinances that may be adopted and incorporated into our municipal code and
practices to improve recycling and promote reduce & reuse. DPW recommends the following:
Require that consumers opt-in to a single-use item rather than having to optout of consuming a product. Many Cambridge businesses have implemented this
change in their online ordering. The following items would be offered at a self-serve
station or by request: straws, stirrers, utensils, condiments, cup sleeves, tops/lids, or
other disposable foodware item used as part of food/beverage service or packaging.
1.

Amend the Bring Your Own Bag Ordinance to remove the exemption for
produce bags. Requiring that produce bags be compostable or recyclable will not only
reduce plastic consumption but supports the City’s curbside organics program.
2.

Require that businesses provide color-coded and labeled receptacles for
separating waste into recycling and trash (and compost, if the business has the service).
3.

Require that food-service retailers provide reusable dishware for on-site
consumption.
4.

Furthermore, DPW is committed to developing a reduce/reuse webpage on the City’s website
to educate businesses and consumers on how they may take action to reduce & reuse.
Not recommending a single-use plastics ban is not a promotion of plastics, rather, DPW
believes that an outright ban on single-use plastics may not be as impactful as the changes we
propose above, which may ultimately lead to more significant changes in consumption habits.
Finally, DPW wants to constructively work with businesses to increase recycling/composting,
while reducing single-use items and wants to do so with strategies that are not financially
impactful, most particularly as businesses try to stay in operating during COVID and try to
recover as a result of the pandemic.

Re:

Council Order POR 2020 #104 regarding implementing a curbside
textile recycling program and report back to the Council on this matter.

DATE:

March 23, 2021

In response to the above referenced Council Order, please be advised of the following:
The Department of Public Works has examined different programs for increasing textile
diversion in the city. Over the last several months the City has met with several organizations
to see what service options are available. At this time, we expect to be able provide a program
for residents by the end of 2021. The process and timeline is in line with that which was
proposed in the Zero Waste Master Plan where the City committed to “develop and
implement a textile recycling strategy either run by the City or in partnership with an existing
organization” by 2021
What are textiles?
For the purpose of this discussion, textiles are a category of attire, bedding, towels, and other
fabrics. Although good-condition clothing is the most valuable form of textile, there continues
to be great value in recycling the fabrics of towels, bedding and stained clothing into new
products such as shoddy (a material used in manufacturing rags), carpeting or filler for
products such as home insulation products or car insulation material.
Textile Recycling Models
Currently, there are a few models for textiles diversion available for City’s like Cambridge.
There is the curbside collection model, pioneered by Simple Recycling, a for-profit organization
primarily based in the New England region whose program has been operating in many
municipalities in Massachusetts, including Somerville and Natick. The program involves

1.7.a

1.7.a

Attachment: DPW textile recycling response 3 29 21 (CMA 2021 #59 : Awaiting Report 20-23 response on textile recycling)

curbside collection of textiles in a pink bag at all participating households. Collection is weekly
on the same day as trash collection.
A second model for textiles diversion is the drop-off model. Currently there are at least five (5)
companies with textile drop-off locations in Cambridge. Residents simply drop-off the material
inside the bins and the vendor services them. Presently, none of these companies have their
containers placed on public property in the city and to fully take advantage of a drop off
model additional facilities would be required and would need to be managed so as to limited
overflowing drop off containers that are sometimes observed at the various private locations
throughout the city.
Finally, a third model is a hybrid of drop-off and curbside. HELPSY was selected to roll out the
City of Boston’s program and also provides services to many municipalities in the New York
City area. The vendor will work with property managers and the local government to identify
potential locations for new textile bins, including locations on City property. They also operate
on-demand option for a curbside pickup of textiles. If the City were to choose to work with
HELPSY then, the City would collaborate to find the best program to allow people have textiles
picked up from their front porch or curb. (somewhat like the mattress recycling program with
UTEC). HELPSY is also a for-profit organization; it is a B Corporation, i.e. a business that
proports to balance purpose and profit. As such, they are legally required to consider the
impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the
environment.
Next Steps
HELPSY and Simple Recycling provide reasonably thorough services and they have flexibility in
terms of what will be required by the City. Each business indicates that they will accept all
textiles and clothing, regardless of quality. Many smaller organizations accept good-quality
attire only, and do not want the remainder of textiles. To achieve the maximum diversion of
textiles at this time, the Department of Public Works will continue to discuss the details of a
City of Cambridge program with both of these companies and indeed other stakeholders over
the next number of months and expects to announce a comprehensive program by the end of
2021.

March 29, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to request that you approve the submission of a Home Rule Petition that (1) would
authorize the City of Cambridge (“City”) to relocate land protected by Article 97 of the
Massachusetts Constitution (“Article 97”) at the Father Callanan Playground and Fields in
Cambridge (“Callanan Field”) that are adjacent to the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper
Schools (the “Site”), and (2) would authorize the City to construct subsurface geothermal wells
under a portion of the Callanan Field.
Specifically, relief is required from the Legislature to complete the Tobin Montessori and Vassal
Lane Upper Schools Project (“Project”). As background, the current school building has
equipment and finishes which are well past their useful life, and with the expected increase in
student population, the building is in dire need of renovation and replacement. The Project
envisions a new building which will provide for better stormwater management and which will
contemplate a goal of zero on site greenhouse gas emissions. The Project will include low flow
plumbing fixtures, heat pumps, a high-performance building envelop, geothermal wells, energy
recovery systems, on site renewable energy, expanded use of natural light, as well as other
sustainability features.
The Callanan Field contains open space protected by Article 97. Land that is held and dedicated
for parkland uses pursuant to Article 97 (“Park Land”) may only be re-used for another use with
the consent of two thirds of both houses of the Legislature. Article 97 provides in relevant part
that: “the people shall have the right to clean air and water, freedom from excessive and
unnecessary noise, and the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic qualities of their environment.”
“Lands and easements taken or acquired for such purposes shall not be used for other purposes or
otherwise disposed of except by laws enacted by a two-thirds vote, taken by yeas and nays, of
each branch of the general court.”
In order to complete the Project, some of the Park Land must be removed from Article 97
protection and utilized for school use. City staff have met with staff of the Commonwealth’s
Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (“EOEA”) about the Article 97 issues
associated with the Project. The City indicated to EOEA staff that it proposes to replace the Park
Land that needs to be removed with about 40% more dedicated land than what it proposes to
remove. EOEA staff indicated their support for the City’s proposal with regard to the Project
and more specifically, the City’s proposed Article 97 Park Land replacement plan.
Packet Pg. 46

1.8

As shown in the plan attached hereto as Attachment A, the existing site conditions contain about
193,540 square feet of Park Land, shown in green. The proposed new site conditions propose
the removal of about 10,640 square feet of Park Land (shown in gray on Attachment B), and
replacement with about 40% more designated Park Land than is being removed, for a total of
about 14,500 square feet of newly designated Park Land (shown in blue on Attachment B),
bringing the total designated Park Land at Callanan Field to about 197,700 square feet.
Attachment C shows the proposed total designated Park Land, which will be in a contiguous
parcel and will include numerous new park amenities, including newly renovated playgrounds,
various new park features, rain gardens and trees, and a redeveloped recreational use path. The
boundaries established in the attachments define the limits, more or less, of the building footprint
and its relationship to the dedicated open space. This space only establishes the parameters of the
community space and is not fully designed. Once approval is given the design team will meet
will all stakeholders(Community, City & School) in subsequent meetings to finalize the design
package. As noted above, EOEA staff have indicated support for the City’s proposal with regard
to this Project and the City’s Article 97 plan.
Relief is also required from the Legislature to construct deep subsurface geothermal wells under
the Park Land, which are an important part of the Project’s sustainability features. The proposed
approximate location of the geothermal wells is depicted on Attachment C, shown in green with
hatching. All existing public park and open space uses that are currently conducted in that part
of the Callanan Field will continue to be conducted after the installation of the deep subsurface
geothermal wells, which will have no effect upon the usability of the Park Land.
In order to proceed with the Project, which will provide a more usable and comfortable school
building, advance the City’s sustainability goals, and increase and improve the City’s designated
Article 97 protected land, I ask that the City Council vote in favor of filing the attached Home
Rule Petition.
Very truly yours,

VICE MAYOR MALLON
WHEREAS:

Governor Baker recently announced that the Commonwealth will move into Phase 2 of
its COVID vaccination plan on February 1st; and

WHEREAS:

Early education and K-12 workers were recently pushed back to be part of the third
priority group included in the Phase 2, meaning they will have to wait longer than
anticipated to be vaccinated; and

WHEREAS:

With an expansion of in-person learning slated to begin on March 1st and concerns
among Cambridge Public School (CPS) educators and staff over their personal health,
ensuring these employees are vaccinated as soon as possible is paramount; and

WHEREAS:

CPS educators and staff being vaccinated will also help restore families’ confidence
and trust in schools and in-person learning as being a safe option for their children,
helping parents return to the workforce while ensuring their children can access highquality in-person education; and

WHEREAS:

Given the ensuing delays in education workers’ vaccination, and the need for both staff
members and scholars to feel safe in in-person classrooms, it is critical that the City
remains proactive and has a plan in place to rapidly vaccinate CPS educators and staff
in convenient locations with ready availability when the times comes; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Public Health Department recently vaccinated all Cambridge first
responders, including firefighters, police officers, and EMTs in Operation Nightengale,
making it easy for first responders to obtain a vaccine locally and a similar plan could
be created to ensure timely delivery of vaccinations to CPS staff; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge Public
Health Department, the School Department, and other relevant City departments to
develop a comprehensive plan to vaccinate CPS educators and staff, similar to
Operation Nightengale for first responders; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter by the February
22nd general meeting.

Solicitor
FROM: Nicole Murati Ferrer, Esq., Chair of Board of License Commissioners
DATE: February 12, 2021
RE:
Home Rule Petition to Eliminate Certain Licensing Requirements of G. L. c. 140, § 183A
TO:

At the request of the City Solicitor, during a public meeting on February 10, 2021, the Board of
License Commissioners (the “Board”) discussed the possibility of a home rule petition seeking special
legislation to allow acoustic music performances of five or fewer performers with no amplification
except for one microphone at licensed establishments in the City of Cambridge, without the
establishment being required to first obtain a license as required by G. L. c. 140, § 183A (the “Home Rule
Petition”) as requested by the City Council in Council Order No. O-9 of 11/16/20, and to discuss whether
the Board had any concerns. I write this as the Board’s designee and inform you that our consensus is
we have many concerns adopting or implementing the Home Rule Petition as proposed.
Specifically, the Board discussed that even though the City of Boston engaged in this type of
non-licensing through a pilot program, this type of program or Home Rule Petition would not work in
the City of Cambridge. Since 2016, the Board has done a comprehensive review of what was being
licensed under G. L. c. 140. The Board eliminated a lot of the “superfluous” categories that were being
licensed, eliminated the requirement to license categories which were not required to be licensed and
which did not affect the factors that the Board needs to consider per state law when issuing such
licenses. The Board focused on the categories listed in the state law, those that create noise, that may
affect the public safety, that may increase traffic, and all other considerations pursuant to state law.
The Board gave careful consideration not only to state law but also the City of Cambridge’s Noise
Ordinance and the nature of our City. Hence, the Board believes that the current licensing requirement
for live music is necessary and appropriate.
The Board discussed their concerns about the zoning issues that are implicated by the proposed
Home Rule Petition and which are not addressed or being discussed front and center. The way the City
is zoned would impede this type of entertainment in many, if not most, of the places that are not
currently licensed. It would be misleading and create unnecessary roadblocks for the businesses to
adopt such a Home Rule Petition when there would be zoning impediments or need for a variance.
There is also the issue that if this is allowed on any area of the licensed premises, those that have
outdoor areas and add this amenity to it, can end up adversely affecting street performers.
In addition, the City of Cambridge is very dense, commercial, and residential areas are often
mixed and intertwined, and our residents expect a peaceful and quiet City. The Board could not recall a
time when noise was not an issue one way or another in its last meetings. For example, in the meeting
where this was discussed the two disciplinary items on the agenda both related to noise
complaints/violations. Often, when a new establishment applies for a license, noise is a consideration
and one that is raised as a possible problem. Noise variances are often part of the matters considered

by the Board. Since the Board, License Commission and Police enforce the Noise Ordinance, the Board
understands that adopting such a Home Rule Petition would create a flurry of new and additional noise
complaints and raise a serious enforcement issue. Noise of this nature is actionable under the
Ordinance only if plainly audible from a distance of fifty (50) feet. This means that many times it is not
actionable because the complainant is closer than fifty (50) feet. In addition, even if it is actionable,
unless it is heard by the responding investigator or police officer, it is very hard to take action against
the business, which ends up frustrating the residents/complainants. We have people staying home
more and using home as an office. Prior and even during COVID-19, the noise complaints we receive are
not limited to late night, they include daytime and early evening. Allowing this without any licensing or
consideration to the residents surrounding the businesses would create an incredible problem.
The Board also raised safety concerns. Live music, even if limited to 5 people with instruments
and one microphone, take up a lot of space. Even ignoring the current space limitations we have with
COVID-19, you still need a dedicated space for these musicians and their equipment to ensure that they
(or their instruments) are not blocking the ingress/egresses, pathways or affect the minimal ADA space
requirements. There are a lot of small venues in Cambridge where adding this type of amenity without
review could end up creating safety issues for the employees and patrons.
The Board concluded that currently there is a way to apply to the License Commission for this
type of event/amenity either on an annual or daily basis. It is not a difficult process, and it is a process
that ensures that zoning approval is obtained, that if a variance is required one is obtained, or that if it is
not allowed because of zoning, that a license is not improperly issued. It is a process that allows the
public to express their concerns before the license is approved, and it is a process that allows the Board
and other regulating departments to dedicate staff to monitor to ensure common good and public
safety. It is not a cost prohibitive process and it is one that is necessary for this type of entertainment in
the City of Cambridge. Allowing such a Home Rule Petition would create an insurmountable number of
noise complaints, would result in places engaging in the practice against zoning and other legal
requirements, and would result in an unmanageable system for issues such as safety and enforcement
of laws and Ordinances.
Please let us know if you would like to discuss further. Thank you.

January 4, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000 of the
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the Community Development
Department and Inspectional Services Department, have prepared this Petition to amend the
Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with G.L. c.40A, §6.
A recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the “SJC”) has interpreted G.L. c.40A, §6 to
provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family
dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019).
Specifically, the SJC held that if an alteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming
single and two-family dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not
create any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only required to obtain a
special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a variance. This holding is limited to lawful
preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with
Article 8.000 of the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning
Ordinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or additions to a lawful
preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwelling, even where no new nonconformities
are created.
As an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting nonconforming because
it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (“FAR”) and the property owner has planned an
addition that will further exceed the FAR but not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning
Ordinance cannot require the property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather,
that addition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed additional will
not be substantially more detrimental than the existing preexisting nonconforming structure to
the neighborhood.
This Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with the SJC’s
interpretation of G.L. c.40A, §6. The Law Department, Community Development Department
and Inspectional Services Department will be available to discuss this Petition with you and with
the Planning Board throughout the zoning amendment process.

two-family dwelling, not otherwise permitted in Section 8.22.1 above, but not the alteration or
enlargement of a preexisting nonconforming use, provided that there is no change in use and
that any enlargement or alteration of such preexisting nonconforming detached single-family
dwelling or two-family dwelling may only increase a preexisting dimensional nonconformity but
does not create a new dimensional nonconformity. In order to grant the special permit the
Board of Zoning Appeal is required to find that the alteration or enlargement shall not be
substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood,
and that the alteration or enlargement satisfies the criteria in Section 10.43.

Dear Commissioner O'Riordan:
In May 2019, the City Council voted to draft a ban on single-use plastic items, with input from the
Recycling Advisory Committee and other stakeholders. Taking up the charge, the RAC conducted
research, collected data, and facilitated conversations in order to develop guidance around the specific
challenge of regulating single-use food serviceware in the city. This letter summarizes our key findings
and recommendations for Cambridge to consider as it moves forward on this important topic.
We commend the City of Cambridge’s commitment to broad sustainability action through its progressive
net zero planning, Bring Your Own Bag Ordinance, Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and more -all of which deeply consider both the environmental and human complexities of these issues. Although
the City Council requested that the RAC explore a ban on single-use plastics, we recommend that the
Council consider developing a broader ordinance regulating all single-use food serviceware that is
shaped around a wide range of environmental and social factors that are important to Cambridge, in line
with the Zero Waste Master Plan. We recommend that an ordinance aim to do the following:
•
•
•
•

Prevent and reduce the impact of certain single-use food serviceware items on the
environment, particularly the marine environment, and on human health;
Help the City meet its goal to reduce trash by 80 percent by 2050;
Promote a strong culture of reuse amongst City of Cambridge residents and visitors;
Recognize economic impacts of changes to local businesses and provide support to small
business owners in order to preserve Cambridge’s thriving retail environment.

Below, we have outlined our specific recommendations for the City to consider when drafting an
ordinance:
1. Reduce the availability of single-use food serviceware items using a phased approach
We recommend reducing the availability of single-use food serviceware items in the City of Cambridge
through a combination of banning particularly problematic items and making others less easy to obtain.
We recommend implementing these changes using a phased approach that prioritizes items based on
how environmentally problematic they are (i.e. impact on marine life, recyclability, etc.), their level of
necessity, and how readily accessible alternatives are. Specifically, we believe the following approaches
from other cities could benefit the City of Cambridge:
•

Begin with a ban on plastic accessories not essential for food service, such as: plastic beverage
plugs, cocktail stirrers and sticks, plastic toothpicks, and straws. Acceptable single-use
alternatives to these materials might include natural fiber (e.g., paper, wood), but we
recommend that they only be made available upon request. The RAC recommends
considerations for individuals with disabilities who may require straws or other items.

Packet Pg. 93

Attachment: Recycling Advisory Committee_Single Use Plastic letter to Owen (COM 161 #2021 : A communication was received from the

4.2.a

•

•

Make other accessory disposable foodware items available upon request, rather than as a
default for both dine-in and take-out options. Examples of items in this category include:
napkins, utensils, condiment cups and packets, cup sleeves, etc.
Require that produce bags in grocery stores be compostable or recyclable in the City of
Cambridge’s curbside programs.

Overall, the RAC recommends that if the City opts to ban a specific material or product, an accessible
alternative must be identified, and the alternative must also have a clear environmental advantage and
be functionally equivalent. The current limitations of the region’s waste management systems should
also be a consideration when making decisions about materials.
• The RAC does not recommend substituting single use items with compostable plastics that are
not currently accepted in the City of Cambridge composting program. Currently, the City of
Cambridge composting program cannot accept compostable paper or plastics (except for
compostable plastic bags).
• We recommend that the City be aware that switching from one single-use item to another may
not reduce the overall volume of trash in our system or necessarily reduce the environmental
impact of our consumption.
• The RAC does not recommend replacing single use plastic items with fiber-based alternatives
containing toxic perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) due to human health concerns.
2. Plan for a Future of Reusables
The RAC envisions a transformation in Cambridge from a culture of single-use food serviceware to one
of reusable food serviceware, in order for the City to reach its environmental goals and minimize the
impact of its material consumption. We recognize this is a significant challenge. Consideration should be
given to the economic impacts of these changes on businesses. We have identified and listed four
actions below based on policies in our peer cities that could assist residents and visitors in making this
transformation possible.
•
•

•
•

Explore the implementation of a single-use cup charge (e.g. $.25) that could be modelled after
the “Bring Your Own Bag” initiative.
Explore the possibility of requiring dine-in food vendors to use reusable serviceware. Make
considerations for small establishments that do not currently have the infrastructure to
accommodate cleaning reusable food serviceware.
Provide technical assistance and mini-grants to assist food vendors with the transition prior to
enforcement of any requirements.
Consider requiring the installation of dishwashing/sanitizing equipment at the time of any new
construction or tenant improvements to a food service establishment.

3. Provide businesses with clear communications materials and outreach around any new policies

Packet Pg. 94

Attachment: Recycling Advisory Committee_Single Use Plastic letter to Owen (COM 161 #2021 : A communication was received from the

4.2.a

As with any policy change, the RAC believes it will be critical to invest in a robust informational campaign
to help businesses transition. Information should be made available in a timely, accessible fashion and
include:
•
•
•
•

The timeline of when the phases of the ordinance would take effect.
A list of acceptable single-use alternatives and information about where they can be purchased
for any products that are banned.
Clear language and data around the intent and benefits of the ordinance.
Downloadable signage available to all businesses to communicate changes such as items now
behind counters, items no longer allowable in the City of Cambridge, etc.

We recommend that over time the City continue to revisit banning or requiring alternatives to single-use
serviceware if environmentally advantageous (e.g. for marine life, greenhouse gas emissions) given the
City of Cambridge’s waste management system.
Thank you for your consideration of these recommendations and your continued commitment to the
City of Cambridge’s progressive sustainability efforts. We expect significant further research and
community discussion will be needed to successfully implement these recommendations. The RAC is
available to discuss any of the points made in this letter and looks forward to further collaboration on
promoting a culture of reuse and reducing the consumption of single-use items in the City.
Sincerely,
The Cambridge Recycling Advisory Committee

Communication re: Mgr's Agenda #6, Single-Use Plastics

As a former (1991-2012) member of the Cambridge Recycling Advisory Committee I am writing to show my support for
DPW’s response to the Council re Single-Use Plastics. I am not sure I am available to give public comment at tonight’s
City Council meeting.
I continue to educate myself about waste diversion initiatives by participating in webinars offered by MassRecycle,
WasteDive, EPA , SWANA and many other organizations. It is important to recognize that we are not going to “ban” our
way out of this problem. It is especially misleading for consumers to think that ‘compostable” packaging or “Bio
plastics” is preferable. BPI, (the Biodegradable Products Institute) has in the past year required their certification for
these products, but even then unless these products are sent to an industrial compost facility they will end up in
landfills. I was helping staff at an info table for DPW a few years ago and a resident said she was using “compostable”
diapers and we had to tell her that she was spending more money on a product that was not that much better for the
environment.
Bottle bills, Extended Producer Responsibility regulations and demand for recycled content are partial but positive
solutions. Rethinkplasticalliance.eu also promotes reduction and reuse. I am especially intrigued by a company in
Europe, PlasticEnergy.com which is turning post-consumer plastics into a product they call TACHOIL ( chemical recycling
has its pros and cons). This past year we have seen an overwhelming amount of disposable PPE due to the pandemic.
These items are mostly if not all are made from various synthetic or organic polymers, and most are made from
petrochemicals. We need to continue to recognize the problems and work towards realistic solutions for everyone.

Thank You in advance for your service in this matter. To assist in this landmark effort by U.S. citizens, I am sharing with
you the above link to a large evidentiary PDF re: crimes committed against America. It enumerates myriad instances of
crucial, strategic irregularities in the 2020 U.S. presidential election (also probably elections at other levels), regarding
which up to 2,000 affidavits have been submitted nationwide. Tens of millions of Americans now require that:
• These and other such election irregularities at the local level be considered on the basis of substance / merit --

and all paper ballots cast and the entire election process be investigated through a COMPLETE, TRANSPARENT
FORENSIC AUDIT for the election results to be rectified, if found to have been compromised by substantial
irregularities.

have been comprehensively investigated and verified, since his "election" / installation has been so fraught
with controversy, including amongst expert analysts at the highest levels of technology and the U.S. military-when courageous enough / sufficiently uncompromised to speak out. In fact, the 37 executive orders now
passed by the current administration indicate that America is now being governed by diktat rather than
representation...a concept Joe Biden himself has voiced:

https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/stacey-lennox/2021/01/27/flashback-president-joe-biden-used-to-believedyou-couldnt-rule-by-executive-fiat-in-2020-n1412781
https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2021
There is more to the U.S. Constitution than process: Although "process" may have been "followed" (according to the
letter rather than the spirit of the law?) in recent months regarding cases of election fraud submitted to courts,
the substance of most cases has not been respected for the rule of law to be applied for the MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE
OF THIS CENTURY-- which is outrageous, appalling, and frankly horrifying to many Americans.
Courts in recent months have dismissed cases re: election irregularities for being too early / "not ripe" --and then, when
those same cases were resubmitted a little later, for being too late / "moot": conveniently taking advantage,
apparently, of certain terms' IMprecision to exploit judges' apparent discretion to interpret matters as “not ripe” or
“moot” if no OPTIMAL or PRECISE timing has ever been specified for legal cases' submission...a gaping loophole that
must be fixed to address this most crucial issue in U.S. history: to protect free and fair U.S. elections. Americans
nationwide are sufficiently fed up about current "process" to step up and try to better ensure, to the best of our
abilities, that all evidence is thoughtfully, carefully considered:
* A judge in Arizona late last month did order enforcement of a subpoena issued against Maricopa County to
produce 1.2 million paper ballots cast there for inspection, which will likely show massive deceit perpetrated
there:

* The New Hampshire House Election Law Committee voted UNANIMOUSLY 20-0 on SB 43 to send to the full
House "legislation outlining a full, detailed audit by a team of experts of the Nov. 3 election results in the town of
Windham" --of the Diebold Accuvote voting machines in Windham, NH, since Republican candidates who had

the Gardner Amendment; it is supported by Secretary of State William Gardner.)

WHEREAS:

Similarly, October is Women’s Small Business Month, a period in which communities
all across the country seek to highlight, support, and lift up their local small businesses

shuttered due the pandemic, a striking difference to the just 17% of white-owned
businesses”; and

businesses in the United States, women-owned businesses generate $1.9 trillion
annually [and] women of color account for 50% of female business owners”; and

WHEREAS:

In keeping with the City’s efforts to lift up our local Black-owned businesses –
particularly as the entire local economy has taken a significant hit due to the Covid-19
pandemic – it would be fitting for the City to fully embrace National Black Business
Month, and it would be equally fitting for the City to fully embrace Women’s Small
Business Month; now therefore be it

This tragic incident follows a report of gunshots in the area of Windsor Street and

violence in our city; and

WHEREAS:

With the coming warmer weather, violent incidents tend to rise in cities across the

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
CPS staff are preparing for the transition to full-time, in-person learning for students at the elementary
and upper school levels next month. All families still have the option for their children to participate in
fully remote learning. Elementary and upper school families with remote learners received an enrollment
form that was due on Wednesday, March 17th. The projected enrollment for the elementary and upper
schools is as follows:
• Preschool – Grade 5: 69% in-person, 31% remote
• Grades 6 – 8: 63% in-person, 37% remote
• Overall enrollment PK– Grade 8: 3722 students in-person (66%) and 2,881 remote (34%)
• At the building level, the in-person population ranges from 53% - 85%
Last Friday, March 19th, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced updated
guidance based on data from districts across the country, including from Massachusetts. The CDC now
advises a distance of 3 feet between desks in elementary, middle, and high schools. Staff are still advised
to remain 6 feet apart.
I am happy to report that more teachers and staff have been getting vaccinated. Governor Baker recently
announced the timeline for when all Massachusetts residents over the age of 16 will be eligible to receive
a COVID-19 vaccine. Please use this link to find out when you are eligible and this link to pre-register for

On Thursday, March 18th, Superintendent Salim gave a presentation on his proposed FY22 School Budget
to the School Committee. Please see here for a PDF of the full proposed budget book. Since then, the
School Committee had a Budget Workshop on Tuesday, March 23rd which focused on CPS’s MultiTiered Systems of Supports (MTSS) and the reflection of community feedback in the FY22 budget. Here
is the presentation from the Budget Workshop.
• MTSS is a framework for how districts can build necessary systems to ensure every student
receives a high-quality experience, supports schools with proactively identifying and addressing
students’ strengths and needs, and optimizes data-driven decision-making, progress monitoring,
and the use of evidence-based supports and strategies with increasing intensity to sustain student
growth
• Key Six Pillars of MTSS
1. All students are capable of grade-level learning with adequate support
2. MTSS is rooted in proactivity and prevention
3. The system utilizes evidence-based practices
4. Decisions and procedures are driven by school and student data
5. The degree of support given to each student is based on their needs
6. Implementation occurs schoolwide and requires stakeholder collaboration
On Thursday, March 25th at 6:00 PM, the School Committee is having a Public Hearing on the FY22
Proposed Budget.
The first COVID Conversation was held via Zoom on March 24th at 6:00 PM for parents and caregivers at
FMA, Cambridgeport, King Open, and Cambridge Street Upper School and was a success. CPS, CPH,
and I are planning to hold another session on Thursday, April 1st at 6:00 PM with families from Amigos,
Baldwin, Peabody, and Rindge Ave Upper School. I will share more details with the community soon.

Chief Talent Officer Lisa Richardson for a preliminary screening of applicants on Friday, March 12th,
Wednesday, March 17th, and 9:00 AM on Saturday, March 20th. I am pleased to announce that there are

COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS
COUNCILLOR NOLAN
1. The American Rescue Plan bill passed, and approximately $87 million will be sent to
Cambridge. In light of the many pressing needs, this funding should help the city move
forward on many goals - addressing home insecurity and preventing evictions, ensuring all
residents know how to access vaccines, exploring municipal broadband. Have any of the
funds been allocated, and what is the plan for allocating the funds?
2. As more people return to work, transportation options other than single occupancy
vehicles need to be available, accessible, and safe. The most sustainable and healthy form
of travel is by walking, biking, or public transit. The City Council and School committee
have sought to provide free public transit options for residents, and there is now a
statewide conversation about lowering fares. What has and can and will the city do to
further those goals?
