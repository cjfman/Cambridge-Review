• City finalizing contracts to send to
Partnerships

From February 2023 Guidance to Partnerships for Year 4 Renewal
Here are some additional considerations as you complete your Year 4
proposals:
Year 4 calendar - CBAC anticipates hosting more cross-Partnership
convenings to advance collaboration, share learning, and the capturing
of ideas for Partnerships and CBAC to use and share more broadly. CBAC
anticipates these convenings happening quarterly:
• March 16, 2023: Year 4 begins
• June 2023: Cross-Partnership convening
• September/ October 2023: Cross-Partnership convening (to coincide
with HRiA evaluation report release)
• December 2023/ January 2024: Cross-Partnership convening
• March 2024: Cross-Partnership convening and celebration
March 15, 2024: Year 4 ends

June 5: CBAC meeting (including possible City
Manager visit)
CBAC Discussion about CBAC vacancies:
• Paul Parravano, a CBAC member from the start of the Committee and the university representative, has moved off of
CBAC
• There is one remaining resident vacancy
• Per the City Council Ordinance (see below*), new members are appointed by the City Manager based on CBAC
recommendation
• Historically, the process has differed based on the type of vacancy –
o Originally, City Staff were looking for people that had interest in the work we were doing and were a
diverse group – along a lot of different lines, including lived experience; we should consider what we
might be looking for in a community member now
o With the business and university representatives, the process was a little different
Question: Does university seat need to be from MIT?
• No – it does not; MIT has identified a possible candidate, and there are many reasons that MIT makes sense – it is a
community partner with the City and many nonprofits, it has strong engagement within the nonprofit community, and
it has a significant financial stake within Cambridge
Question: Is MIT a large part of committed Community Benefits funds moving forward, as it was with initial $7m?
• There is a large amount associated with the Volpe project; we are not aware of significant Community Benefits funds
coming from any other college or university

Question: Have any of the other colleges or universities proactively reached out, and is there a responsibility on the part of
the CBAC to reach out to them? And MIT seems likely to be engaged either way – so might this provide an opportunity to
engage others in the work?
• From a business and organizational perspective, there does not seem to be a strong interest
• And Paul seemed to have the ability and a certain level of decision-making/ seniority to commit resources – is that an
expectation?
o Yes - seniority of the person does matter; we likely want to have confidence that the representative is
appropriate and prepared to be actively bringing back CBAC-related considerations to their institution/
department
Question: Where/ how else are Harvard, Lesley, others engaged with the City?
• Affordable Housing Trust is one place that comes to mind, and there is definitely a relationship in other forms and
venues
• In terms of what questions CBAC might ask of interested candidates, we can find, share, and revisit the questions from
the last time we did a round of resident interviews; some considerations might include: time of meeting; experience
with nonprofits and the social sector – e.g., been a client/ consumer of a nonprofit, worked at a nonprofit, served on a
nonprofit board
o Yes – it seems important to have a consumer/ client of a nonprofit as part of CBAC
Considering the CBAC timeline:
• Beyond Year 4, how are we thinking about another round of CBAC funding – i.e., for what purposes, and what about a
needs assessment?
o Part of Year 4 focus of CBAC is to learn from Year 4 about our its own job, how we did, what we learned,
how it informs approach moving forward
*According to the City Council Ordinance: The Committee shall be comprised of the following representatives—three
members shall be representatives of non-profit organizations that provide services to Cambridge residents; three members
shall be City staff designees including the City Manager or his or her designee; four members shall be Cambridge residents,
who shall be residents of the City at the time of appointment; one member shall be a representative of the Cambridge
Community Foundation; one member shall be a representative of the City's business or property development community;
and one member shall be a representative from one of the City's universities or colleges

Year 4: CBAC draft goals & support for partnerships
[slide 5]
1. Partnerships to fully complete three years of evaluation. Each Partnership is at a different stage of implementation, so
some may benefit from this extra time. Ideally, this would include at least 12 months of follow-up data; more specific
details may be determined as additional follow-up information is received from HRiA.
2. Allow time to work with families that Partnerships may not be working with or may be working with in different ways
beyond Year 4. (For example: transitioning families to lesser services, different providers, or successfully out of the
program.)
3. Maximize learning within and across Partnerships, including each Partnership’s ability to tell the story of their model.
4. Work with Partnerships to determine ways to continue their models after year 4 Community benefits funding ends.
Our discussion today – considering goals 3 & 4:
• What might CBAC ask of HRiA in the scope for Year 4?
• How else does CBAC want to consider its approach to supporting Partnerships in Year 4 (including allocation of
available resources)?
•

•
•

With HRiA, original scope was through Year 3 plus time for report analysis; with Year 4, need to scope out with HRiA
what happens beyond May; 4-6 months beyond May, analysis will lead to report, then working with CBAC and
Partnerships – collaborative review, plus other strategic support to tell the story, what we have learned from this data,
what we can use moving forward
And what piece(s) of what Partnerships have already named might CBAC be able to support?
The big buckets seem to be – telling the stories, creating videos, marketing materials; supporting fundraising/ helping
prepare materials that can be used in fundraising

With regards to telling the story piece, there is an opportunity for the City to tell the story, and Partnerships telling
their part of the story – once we have data, using it to tell the story in a creative and dynamic way, and the City using it
to share story of building community, inclusive of businesses and universities – an enormous opportunity to tell our
story/ tell its story, and for us to think about how to engage the broader community
And some piece of telling story – is about evaluation information and about stories of support to residents and work of
Partnership itself; this includes pinpointing work of how each Partnership can individually use the work in the
evaluation – and do they need individualized support to use the evaluation to tell their story, which is different than
wanting support for marketing/ videography; and then also considering interest of Partnerships as a collective vs.
Partnerships as individuals
With HRiA’s strategic arm, I don’t know enough about its work and competencies to know what to ask; we don’t know
what to ask for because we don’t know what they do, what types of deliverables they might offer
o HRiA: Will bring CBAC notes back to internal team consider what might be possible
On the City side, there will be some procurement/ purchasing considerations
What might be tricky about this is four different Partnerships with different interests and the City’s limitations; what is
helpful is a partner with a strategic orientation that can flexibly support Partnerships where they are at – something
like that may be easier to respond to
It may not be the same for all the Partnerships – and you could imagine what Partnerships don’t have time for; it may
be helpful to offer thoughtful facilitated support to do some planning – i.e., here are some considerations – and maybe
not all the partnerships want that, and that is separate from how do you tell your story
It seems there may be three things present: How HRiA might help Partnerships use evaluations to tell their individual
story; helping Partnerships think strategically about the future; Partnerships and individual organizations telling their
story, and how do we market ourselves
And the data will inform all of this
There may need to be some more thought here – all of them, both within each Partnership/ organization and
collectively as a group, being offered some strategic thinking/ planning help may set them up well

Next Steps & Next Meeting Dates
Next CABC meetings:
• Monday May 1, 4pm – 6pm; discussion of ARPA: What questions do members have?
• Monday June 5, 4pm – 6pm; possible visit by the City Manager: What do members want to know/ prioritize?
Discussion of ARPA: What questions do members have?
• I know very little, I only know about guaranteed income piece, and I don’t know about work with nonprofits – a basic
primer would be useful
• How does it work, how does it get dispersed? Need a general understanding of what is possible in terms of funding –
what flows through the City/ different buckets through the City?
• How would this interact with inform/ what is already in process – where does this fit in?
• HRiA had mentioned the possible impact of guaranteed income pilot/ ARPA funding on participants in the
Partnerships’ projects; would that fund any individuals being supported by Partnership? It would be helpful to
understand that
o HRiA: Yes, that was going to be part of a question we were considering to ask families about sources of
income
• With Cambridge RISE, there was a relatively small number of people that were recipients that were also part of a
Partnership; HRiA’s family-level data collection will have ended before new RISE has started
• There is the guaranteed income money, there is $6m in ARPA money available to nonprofits, and there are a number
of nonprofits that are direct ARPA recipients, and then a number of projects where money was assigned and not yet
allocated
June visit by the City Manager: What do members want to know/ prioritize?
• Long-term sustainability of having some kind of City Community Benefits Fund that supports nonprofits – know more
about how funding ends up in Community Benefits Fund – how those things can be structured given the tons of things
happening in Cambridge, and the tons of wealth
• The City Manager will be interested in learning from the CBAC what has been done thus far, how its benefited
nonprofits, plans for future
• We need a primer on all of that – a background sense of the mechanics of how the Community Benefits Funding works

One of Sandra’s colleagues in the Community Development Department could explain when a piece of
development ends up in Community Benefits Funds and with other residential and community benefits –
might be able to provide a primer on that
o It is a zoning question
o Developers may have to provide mitigation for certain things – e.g., traffic, sewer, housing – to address
impact on the City, and then there were other developments that it wasn’t so neatly in a category, and so that
is where the Community Benefits Fund came into play and this Committee to inform that process so that
individual developers are not making individual deals
We spent a lot of time brainstorming and coming up with this funding strategy, asked Wendell (City staff at the time)
to go find case studies, and couldn’t find many examples; the City Manager may know about community benefits from
his hospital background – and this is kind of unique. And that was a bit of a struggle, based on a needs assessment,
how were we going to find nonprofits; he might benefit from hearing the perspective of the CBAC members about the
work that we have done and the voices of nonprofits and experience of community benefits
Yes – context is everything
And we do not want to miss the opportunity to show off the work that we have done, and the impact of this funding,
as we consider sustainability
Yes – I am really thinking that opportunity is to be informative to the City Manager
Success will be if he comes away with an understanding of what has been done to date over the past 5 years, where
we are at now, what we are hoping to do in next 12 months – so that he can have perspective when others ask come
to him

And:
• What about June convening with Partnerships – is that happening?

VII.

Considering HRiA and supports for Partnerships: Wherever flexibility can be built in for Partnerships is important – put
Partnerships in the driver seat a bit more, provide extra flexibility within a frame
Considering the question about what is next for future CBAC round(s) of funding: One of the things that will help map
that out is the financial picture – i.e., what is the total dollar amount pledged, what is the timing of that? That will help
guide what is feasible and reasonable in terms of the next iteration of this – both for the group to see, and to make
public
Yes, and – I do think we should be able to have more certainty, and given that payments are tied to building completion,
we can minimally provide: “At some point, this is expected, and this is the timeline…” – we could at least frame what we
do or don’t know even as it is a bit challenging to predict when a building will get its Certificate of Occupancy
