Current
Resale
Formula –
“Return on
Equity”

Affordable Value = Purchase Price + Return on Equity
Equity = down payment + all principal payments made
on mortgage loans
Return on Equity = Equity x Treasury Bill Rate
Treasury rates used are 10, 20 or 30 year, depending on
restriction, published monthly by the Federal Reserve
Return on Equity is calculated for anniversary month of
purchase, prorated for partial years

Current Inheritance Policy
• “Inheritance” refers only to ownership of the affordable home
• Proceeds from a sale are part of owner’s estate
• Can be left to any beneficiary – no City requirements
• Current restriction:
• Surviving spouse has lifetime right to occupy
• Other household members have at least one year
• No transfer without notifying City
• Policy is to give eligible household members first option to purchase if
eligible

Frequent Themes
Program plays important
role in keeping people in
Cambridge with stable
housing

Restrictions make
program feel less than
full ownership

Combination of limited
resale price and market
prices limits owners’
options to move on

Understand challenge of
keeping units affordable
while increasing return
but current formula too
limited

Less incentive to invest
in unit condition

Priority for inheritance is
opportunity for family
members to remain in
Cambridge
