In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-54, regarding how a cloud-based data
management system for DHSP’s Children and Youth Programs will clearly protect all aspects of
participant privacy and access security, Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen
Semonoff and Assistant Director of the IT Department Eric Belford report the following:
On April 4th, 2019, The City of Cambridge Department of Human Services released a request
for proposal for a cloud-based data management system to collect, manage, and analyze
information about participants.
In Section III: Evaluations of the Proposals, the City states that it will conduct interviews to
determine if the proposers are responsive and responsible and if their expertise meets the needs
of the City. During the interviews the Proposers will be asked to provide a comprehensive
demonstration of all functional and technical requirements as well as respond to questions about
how the Proposers product can address the needs of DHSP Children and Youth Programs.
Acknowledging that children and youth program participant data is highly sensitive, the RFP
evaluation committee includes staff that hold the distinction of Certified Information Systems
Security Professional (CISSP) that can ascertain each vendors fitness to protect all aspects of
participant privacy and access security. All Proposers will be asked to provide their security
practices and procedures in writing that cover security controls and compliance framework
adherence, external audits and reviews, data backup and recovery procedures, and data security
policies. Similarly, all Proposers will be asked to furnish a copy of their privacy policy to ensure
they will not sell, rent, license or exchange City of Cambridge data unless authorized by the city
to do so.

AR-19-11 Report on the feasibility of eliminating the use of plastic water bottles at City and
School events.
The City of Cambridge conducts public events daily throughout the city. Given the time of day
associated with many of these events, they typically include food snacks and beverages, be the
beverages coffee, tea, soft drinks or water. The soft drinks and water are typically provided in
plastic bottles. It is also typically the case in these events that recycling options are available to
participants, however, it is recognized that moving forward additional efforts will be required to
reduce/eliminate the consumption of water and soft drinks from single use plastic containers.
It should be said that the City has been addressing the reduction /elimination of bottled water for
many years. The Water Department together with the Cambridge Public Health Department
(CPHD) started promoting using tap water with the slogan
“Cambridge Water, Wicked Good” about 5 years ago. This
program is still on-going. In furtherance of this effort, the
City continues the installation of water bottle filling stations
at school and other city buildings and outdoor spaces across
the city.
The School Department has installed water bottle filling
stations at all the school buildings except the Morse School
and is planning to have the Morse updated this summer
(2019). Moving forward the Schools will use signage to
inform meeting participants of the fill station and water
bubbler locations and is reviewing steps to eliminate single
use bottled water in response to both city council and school
committee resolutions. Specific to other municipal buildings;

Attachment: eliminating plastic bottles response 062419 (CMA 2019 #183 : eliminating plastic water bottles response)

To: Louie DePasquale,
City Manager

At this time there are 97 “Quench” fill stations and
7 “Elkey” bubblers and bottle fill stations installed
in other city buildings, across the city. The
expectation is that approximately another 20
stations need to be installed at a cost of
approximately $40,000 before every municipal
building has one or more water bottle filling station
in place. Additional survey work will be required
to determine whether all the various buildings used
for public meetings etc. have stations that are both
available and accessible to those who attend events
and additional installations may be required to
provide such.

Outdoor Events
There are numerous outdoor events held by various
city departments throughout the year where food and beverages are typically made available to
attendees; Some of the major events include:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Danehy Park Day.
The Cambridge Arts Council, River Fest.
Cambridge Water Department, Fresh Pond Day and Water Week school children event.
Community Development Department (CDD) Parking Day.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of a grant from the State’s Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness
(MVP) Regional Action Grant program in the amount of $350,000 to the Public Investment Fund Public
Works Extraordinary Expenditures account.
The grant was submitted by Cambridge on behalf of the Resilient Mystic Collaborative (RMC), which is
a 14-member municipal partnership working on watershed-scale climate resiliency in the Mystic
Watershed.
The Collaborative launched in September 2018 and the member municipalities quickly identified
stormwater management as a top goal. Building on the modelling work that Cambridge has done through
our Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment, the Collaborative developed a Mystic River watershed
model to evaluate watershed wide scenarios involving de-paving, stormwater wetlands and active
reservoir management to quantify the extent to which each action would reduce flooding.
This grant will allow the Collaborative to identify and pursue site-specific green infrastructure
opportunities in the individual communities for regional stormwater management and evaluate additional
flood management strategies to mitigate precipitation flooding from the 10-year storm event in 2070. The
grant will strengthen regional collaboration and was supported by The Barr Foundation, Arlington,
Lexington, Malden, Medford, MAPC, Stoneham, Wakefield, Winchester and Woburn.
The 25% match for the grant is being provided by the Barr Foundation through the Mystic River
Watershed Association, so no city funds are required.

Re: AR-19-65 : Report on the pilot program and whether it could be implemented
as a permanent program, which made menstrual products available in all
restrooms, regardless of the gender identity assigned to that restroom.

In response to the 2016 Council Order requesting that menstrual products be made available in public
restrooms in the city, eight duel dispensing units, which dispensed tampons and napkins, were installed
in the following locations:
City Hall basement female restroom (1)
Frizoli Youth Center 1st floor woman’s restroom (1)
Gately Youth Center 1st floor woman’s restroom (1)
Moore Youth Center woman’s restroom (1)
Moses Youth Center 1st floor woman’s restroom (1)
Russell Youth Center 1st floor woman’s restroom (1)
Wolfe Building 1st and 2nd floor woman’s’ restrooms (2)
In summary, the eight units cost $1,146.32 to procure, installation was done by in-house crews; and
between February 2017 and the end of April 2019 approximately 4,750 items have been dispensed at a
cost of approximately $650.
The total cost of for the procurement and installation of the dispensing units and products between the
spring of 2017 and the spring of 2019 was less than $2,000. There have not been any significant issues
with the maintenance of the installations to date.

To meet the request as stated in the order an additional 116 bathrooms would need to be outfitted with
the dispensing units. The cost associated with the placement of the units is approximately $35,000 with
an additional cost of approximately $10,000 annually for maintenance and resupply. These bathrooms
are located in all of the various fire stations, all of the libraries, the youth centers, the various
administration buildings, the public safety building, the DPW complex and the Water Department
facility.
The Department of Public Works will begin the deployment of the additional dispensers this fall and will
continue with the installation of such through the end of 2019.
I will be recommending an appropriation later in FY20 to support the expansion of this program.

Re : POR 2019- 216 That the City Manager is requested to report back to the City Council
regarding rubbish handling at Comeau Field and Francis J. McCrehan Memorial
Swimming Pool.
In response to the above awaiting report and as an additional response to the report that was
provided to City Council on April 30th the Department of Public Works has now placed three big
belly bins adjacent to the parking lot/turn around at Comeau Field. Two of the bins are adjacent
to Rindge Avenue, one by the baseball field and one by the bus stop while another big belly
facility is in place along the pathway immediately to the north of Comeau Field as one walks
toward the football field and the T headhouse.
DPW crews continue to
clean out these bins every
evening and monitor the
location to the extent such
is feasible. We have also
had our contractor bait and
monitor the area for
rodent issues and that
effort continues. Given the
concerns associated with
increased activity at the
McCrehan pool during the
summer months the
Department will be adding
another big belly at the
entrance to the pool along

June 24, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report 19-16, which requesting a report on the “Super Sunday” road
race and whether proper procedures were followed in issuing permits and notifying neighbors,
Police Commissioner Branville Bard, Director of Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Joseph
Barr, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa, and Commissioner of Public Works Owen O’Riordan report
the following.
The “Super Sunday” road race has taken place successfully for several years on the morning of
Super Bowl Sunday. This is the only road race that occurs during the winter months, and the City
has always reserved the right to cancel the event in the event of a significant snow event that
would divert City resources and/or make the event unsafe for participants.
For the 2019 event, there were concerns expressed in the week prior to the event about the timing
and level of notification to the community, which appears to have taken place very close to the
date of the event and may not have reached all the necessary stakeholders. In addition, the permit
for the race was not issued until very close to the event because the race organizer was late in
submitting required insurance information. The race organizer finally provided this information
and the permit was issued on the Friday before the race. It is typical that City staff will work with
race organizers to ensure compliance with our road race guidelines, including some flexibility on
timelines and requirements, in order to allow events to take place. In this case, despite working
with the organizer in advance of the race, this year’s running of the Super Sunday race was not
fully in compliance with our normal requirements.
Given the events of this year’s Super Sunday race, and issues with other races, it has become
clear that the City needs to become stricter in enforcing timelines and requirements, in order to
mitigate the impacts of these events on local residents, attendees at houses of worship or other
planned community events, and other stakeholders. The City last updated the road race
guidelines in 2017, and it appears that another update is required, to both clarify and expand the
policies and requirements. Because of the need for consultations with stakeholders and legal

Packet Pg. 48

1.9

review, these updates will likely take some time to develop and formally implement, but the
specific areas where we are looking to make updates include the following:
• Clarifying the notification requirements to include notification to local residents and
businesses in all areas that will be affected by the race, organizations with planned
community events during the time in question, and houses of worship. In particular, it is
important that organizations with planned community events during the time in question
and houses of worship receive notifications well in advance, so these organizations can
notify their members/attendees through written and verbal announcements during prior
services and events. We are also considering whether to require race organizers to use a
mailing service to notify affected residents and organizations, since this will provide
greater certainty that notifications have occurred. At the same time, we need to balance
the improved communication against the additional cost to race organizers, which may
then reduce the amount of race proceeds that can be contributed to charity.
• Updating our insurance and indemnification requirements for race organizers so that they
are fully consistent with the City’s overall requirements and reflect the correct monetary
limits.
• Investigating the creation of a Road Closure Permit that would be issued jointly by the
Traffic, Parking, and Transportation and Police Departments, to provide a clearer review
and approval process for road races (and other special events) that require significant
road closures.
• Ensuring compliance with any relevant state requirements, including the Commercial CoVenturer filings required by the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office.
Based on these changes, we hope to create clearer expectations for race organizers, charities that
benefit from races, community residents, businesses, houses of worship and organizations that
hold other planned community events, and other key stakeholders. This should also make it
simpler to determine whether a race organizer has failed to meet the requirements, in the unlikely
event that we need to sanction a race or cancel a race entirely due to non-compliance.
Road races such as the Super Sunday race create impacts on local communities, but also raise
funds for local charities. As a result, our management of road races tries to balance the impacts
and benefits of these races for local residents, businesses, and charitable organizations, while
also delivering high quality customer service to all our customers. In the case of this year’s Super
Sunday race, we did not find this balance, and we are therefore working to adjust our approach
going forward. Based on this, we hope to be able to continue to reap the benefits of continuing to
allow road races in Cambridge, while managing the impact on local residents, businesses, houses
of worship, and other community organizations.

Re: Update on Volpe Project
Dear City Manager DePasquale:
In response to your request, we are pleased to provide an update on the federal government’s
Volpe project in response to City Council order #0-13. Through you, that order requested
background on the Volpe building’s siting, design, and size, as well as the schedule for its
construction and completion. We are happy to provide that information here.
Since the City Council’s approval of the Volpe parcel rezoning in October 2017, we have been
focusing our efforts on the design of, and site preparation for, the new Volpe National
Transportation Systems Center headquarters — as stipulated by the Exchange Agreement
between the General Services Administration (GSA) and MIT. We have been working closely
with the GSA, Volpe representatives, Turner Construction, and a team of planners and architects
on the building design, landscape plan, and site access plan. Attached are several renderings of
the new approximately 400,000 SF headquarters which will be located on the northwest corner
of the parcel, as anticipated through the zoning deliberations.
We are grateful to City staff from many different departments who have been working through a
variety of project-related details with us.
Construction Schedule
Last fall, we commenced utility work to prepare the site for construction. The existing utility
plant and underground utilities required relocation, and 22 existing trees were removed. Removal
of the existing parking area has commenced and further site prep work is underway.
Key construction schedule dates include:
• Commenced utility site work in October 2018
• Mobilized for site prep work on June 3, 2019
• Target completion of utility site work in September 2019

Community Outreach
On February 5th, we provided a public update on the Volpe project at our Town Gown
presentation to the Planning Board. We presented the proposed massing and design for the
building, as well as the Maya Lin landscape art installation for the adjacent open space.
On May 21st, we met with residents of the directly-adjacent 303 Third Street and Third Square
Apartments to provide an overview of the project so abutters could anticipate and understand the
timing and impacts of the construction. All residents have been provided with direct contact
information for our team members, as well as Turner Construction team members, so we can
respond to concerns and questions as they arise. In addition, we will be issuing regular e-mail
construction updates.
As part of the project, the GSA is seeking curb cut approval from the City Council for
replacement site access on Binney Street. The new curb cut location is required by the GSA to
meet its security, safety, loading, and site access requirements. As part of our curb cut outreach
process, we provided Volpe project updates to the East Cambridge Planning Team, the
Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, and other abutters.
When we turn our attention to the planning process for the remaining 10 acres on the site, we
will, of course, solicit input and feedback from abutters and the community through a variety of
community meetings, workshops, and small group discussions. Our proposal, as discussed
during the zoning process, includes four residential buildings (including approximately 280
affordable and 20 middle-income units), four commercial buildings, retail, open space, and a
community center. In addition, we have been progressing on two Volpe-related commitments —
the Job Connector is now open and we are working with the City and other stakeholders to
advance the Grand Junction community path process.
We appreciate your ongoing support of our Volpe initiative and are happy to answer any further
questions that you may have. We will continue to provide updates to you and the City Council as
the project advances.
Sincerely,

Michael Owu

DATE:

June 19, 2019

In response to Awaiting Report #19-57 dated May 13, 2019 requesting that the City
Manager provide an update on progress toward making CharlieCards available at certain
public buildings throughout the City, we submit the following.
Access to CharlieCards in Cambridge is limited, and broadening access to the cards is a
priority. CDD regularly requests approximately 200 CharlieCards per summer from the
MBTA for distribution to summer youth employees and at public outreach events
throughout the city. In addition, CDD has reached out to the MBTA to initiate a
partnership to distribute CharlieCards at public buildings, similar to the City of Boston
partnership. This response details the MBTA CharlieCard partnership that will be piloted
in Cambridge starting August 31, 2019 and summarizes the upcoming changes to the
fare payment system at the MBTA. The latter may affect distribution strategies.
Background on MBTA – Boston CharlieCard Partnership
The City of Boston has partnered with the MBTA to designate several public locations as
distribution points for CharlieCards. These are locations where a city staff member is
available to distribute the CharlieCards to patrons or constituents. Boston staff report
that within approximately two months, they have distributed over 650 CharlieCards
with almost one-third distributed in heavily bus-dependent neighborhoods.
They characterize the collaboration as very easy, reporting that the MBTA has provided
an easy replenishment process and promotional materials for the various distribution
locations. They also note that publicity in the local press has helped support the launch
and success of the program.
MBTA – Cambridge CharlieCard Partnership
In partnership with the MBTA, we plan to make CharlieCards available at the CDD front
desk at 344 Broadway, 3rd Floor by August 31. The cards may be loaded at any MBTA

station using cash, credit or debit cards, or on MBTA buses using cash. By piloting this
initiative at CDD, we will be able to assess frequency of requests, frequently asked
questions, staffing impact and any other considerations prior to deploying the program
more widely at other locations. The MBTA will advertise this program in addition to City
of Cambridge press outreach, signage, flyers, website updates, and social media
postings.

In the fall, CDD staff will work with the City Manager’s office and other departments to
designate other public locations where at least one staff person could be engaged and
trained on the purpose, use, and distribution of CharlieCards, and any related
Cambridge processes and policies.
Seniors are eligible for the Senior CharlieCard, which provides discounted fees and
requires a special registration process. Each year, CDD hosts three Senior CharlieCard
registration events in collaboration with the Council on Aging, and seniors may register
anytime at Downtown Crossing. Additionally, discounted T-passes are available for
income-eligible Cambridge residents ages 19-25 through the Department of Human
Service Programs and student T-passes are distributed at CRLS.
MBTA Next Generation Fare Payment System
We have been coordinating with the MBTA regarding the MBTA’s new fare payment
system, which is currently under development and expected to be rolled out in the next
few years.
Known as Automated Fare Collection (AFC) 2.0, the new payment system will allow
riders to “tap” or validate their fare while on board vehicles using fare cards,
smartphones, or contactless credit cards. Vending machines will also be provided at all
stations and some bus stops. The MBTA is targeting retail partnerships to broaden
access to fare cards.
One anticipated benefit of the new system would be faster bus service, with the ability
to board at any door to validate fares. More information on the AFC 2.0 can be found at
https://www.mbta.com/projects/automated-fare-collection-20-afc-20.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-130 regarding working with the Chair of the
Civic Unity Committee, the Director of the Cambridge Library, the Director of 22-CityView, the
Director of the Women’s Commission, and any other appropriate City personnel to begin
planning for a public discussion in recognition of 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage, please be
advised of the following:
The Chair of the Civic Unity Committee, working with my office, has formed a working group
with the city employees identified above, as well as staff from the Historical Commission and a
representative from the Cambridge Historical Society, to plan a series of public events for the
community.
The working group has met four times thus far and will continue to meet regularly through
August 2020. The group is currently planning three events: a kickoff event in September 2019, a
second event in or around February 2020, and a final event in or around August 2020 to mark the
100th anniversary of the date on which the 19th Amendment was ratified. While each event will
have a different focus, all events will recognize the contributions of underrepresented women
and the continuing struggle for equality and enfranchisement.
The kickoff event will be held in September 2019 at the main branch of the Cambridge Public
Library. This roundtable event will center on the “kitchen table” and foster a meaningful
dialogue about women who were “at the table” for the passage of the 19th Amendment and
women who were excluded. The working group is currently finalizing the event details and will
publicize them shortly. The event in or around February 2020 will focus on Cambridge Suffrage
history, including key milestones and the diverse Cantabrigians who led the movement. The
planning of the centennial event in or around August 2020 is still being developed but will
include a keynote speaker and look to the road ahead; the continued importance of expanding the
rights of citizenship and enfranchisement to persons who have been denied them.

Packet Pg. 63

1.14

Through August 2020, the working group will also leverage opportunities to collaborate with
individual City departments developing pertinent events or projects and to promote events in the
greater Cambridge area. A calendar of events celebrating the centennial anniversary of the 19th
Amendment, and other informational resources, will be promoted on a dedicated web page. The
working group is finalizing the imagery and content and will announce the web page once it
becomes active.
I look forward to continuing to work with the Chair of the Civic Unity Committee and the
working group to bring the Cambridge community together to celebrate this important milestone.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering

In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

2.3

To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am submitting the attached proposed Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance to the City Council
which would, among other things, create a social equity and economic empowerment applicant preference
for proposed cannabis businesses in the City. The recent zoning ordinance passed on December 17, 2018
by the Council provided at §11.806 that the zoning for cannabis businesses would take effect on April 20,
2019 “or upon passage of a ‘Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance,’ whichever comes first.” After the
Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance is enacted, actions required by the City Council relating to
cannabis businesses in the City would be completed.
This draft Ordinance creates an independent permitting process that all cannabis businesses in the City
will be required to satisfy as a condition to operating in Cambridge. The Ordinance applies to Cannabis
Retail Stores, Cannabis Cultivators, Cannabis Product Manufacturers and Cannabis Transporters. The
Ordinance creates an initial two-year period of exclusivity allowing only Priority Applicants, as defined
in the Ordinance, to obtain a Cannabis Business Permit in the City. After the two years, other applicants
may also be granted Cannabis Business Permits. Group A Priority Applicants are defined in the
Ordinance as those certified by the Commonwealth as Economic Empowerment or Social Equity Program
applicants, or a Women or Minority Owned business. Group B Priority Applicants are existing
Registered Marijuana Dispensaries (“RMDs”) selling medical cannabis who also want to sell retail
cannabis. All applicants must satisfy the ten permitting requirements listed in section 5 of the Ordinance.
The permitting process will be primarily administered and enforced by the Inspectional Services
Department. However, the Community Development Department, Public Health Department and the
Police Department will also have a role to play in the administration and enforcement of the Ordinance
provisions. In brief, the Ordinance proposes the following steps in the overall City permitting process for
Cannabis Businesses:
a. Priority Applicants to request certification as such by the Director of the Economic
Development Division of the Community Development Department;
b. All applicants to enter into a Host Community Agreement with the City to be executed by the
City Manager and the applicant;
c. All applicants to apply for and obtain a Planning Board special permit in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance;

Packet Pg. 85

2.3

d. All applicants to obtain all other permits and approval required by State and local laws and
regulations to the extent that such other permits and approvals can be obtained prior to the
City’s issuance of the Cannabis Business Permit; and
e. All applicants to obtain the Cannabis Business Permit from the Inspectional Services
Department provided for by the attached Ordinance.
The Cannabis Business Permit will be subject to annual renewal and will be subject to revocation
if the holder violates the applicable laws and/or permit conditions. Both ISD and CDD will have
authority to promulgate regulations to implement the Ordinance with respect to their respective Ordinance
responsibilities.
This Ordinance has been informed by discussions that have taken place over the past several months at
the City Council and its Public Safety Committee, Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee,
and Economic Development and University Relations Committee. This draft was prepared with the
participation of several departments, including the Law Department, Community Development
Department, Public Health Department, Inspectional Services Department, Police Department, Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department, Department of Human Services Programs and License
Commission.

In the Year Two Thousand and Nineteen
AN ORDINANCE

That the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Cambridge be amended as follows:
To replace the current text of Section 4.22 with the following text:
4.22

Accessory Apartments. The purpose of this Subsection 4.22 is to allow for the creation of
accessory apartments in all districts. Many large existing single and two-family dwellings or
other accessory buildings on their lots are underutilized. Alteration of these buildings to provide
one additional dwelling unit on the lot would be prohibited in most cases due to the existing
floor area ratio and/or lot area per dwelling unit requirements of Subsection 5.31, among other
zoning limitations. Given contemporary lifestyles, housing needs, and energy and maintenance
costs, it is beneficial to the City to allow greater flexibility in the use of such buildings to add new
dwelling units without substantially altering the environmental quality of their surrounding
neighborhoods. This Subsection 4.22 gives the Board of Zoning Appeal the authority to relax
such requirements in certain instances as enumerated below.

4.22.1 In all districts the Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit for the alteration of an
existing single-family detached dwelling, two-family dwelling, or accessory building on the same
lot as a single-family or two-family dwelling to provide one accessory apartment if the following
conditions are met:
1. The building containing the accessory apartment has been in existence since on or before
February 1, 2019.
2. In the case of an accessory apartment within a single-family or two-family dwelling, prior to
alteration the dwelling contains at least one thousand eight hundred (1800) square feet of
gross floor area.
3. In the case of an accessory apartment within a single-family or two-family dwelling, such
accessory apartment shall not occupy more than 900 square feet or thirty-five (35) percent
of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is less. An accessory apartment
created within an accessory building shall not occupy more than 900 square feet.
4. No more than one accessory apartment shall be allowed on any lot.
4.22.2 In all districts any existing two-family dwelling may be converted to a single-family detached
dwelling with one accessory apartment by right, without need for a Special Permit, if the
conditions set forth in Section 4.22.1 above are met.

1. Accessory apartments shall not be counted in applying the lot area per dwelling unit
limitations of the zoning district.
2. The Board may relax applicable floor area ratio (FAR) or gross floor area (GFA) limitations, to
the extent necessary, to enable the creation of an accessory apartment within the envelope
of an existing structure; however, any additional GFA created outside the envelope of the
existing structure shall comply with applicable FAR or GFA limitations for the lot.
3. The Board may alter applicable yard setback or height limitations, to the extent necessary,
to enable site improvements that may be required to ensure the safe habitation of the
accessory apartment, including but not limited to emergency egress routes; however, any
movement or alteration to the principal exterior walls or roof of a building shall comply with
applicable yard setback and height limitations for the lot.
4. No off-street parking shall be required for an accessory apartment.
4.22.4 In granting a special permit for an accessory apartment, the Board shall determine that the
General Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 10.43 of this Zoning Ordinance are met and
that any alterations that are visible from the exterior of the building shall be compatible with
the appearance and character of the neighborhood and are minimally necessary to enable the
creation of the accessory apartment. The Board may impose such conditions as it may deem
appropriate to ensure ongoing compliance with such criteria and to avoid undue detriment to
the neighborhood or to nearby persons or property.

Passed to a second reading as amended at the City Council
meeting held on April 22, 2019 and on or after May 6, 2019
the question comes on passage to be ordained.

Proposed Changes to the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance

Introduction
I offer these proposed changes in response to concerns raised by my colleagues and members of the
public at the April 11, 2019 Ordinance Committee hearing. I believe these simple changes will address
many of the concerns raised and will allow us to move forward expediently with one of the most equitable
cannabis licensing processes in the Commonwealth. The biggest proposed change is to simply exclude
non-priority applicants entirely, and to limit Priority B applicants to RMDs that are already operational or
permitted in the city. I have included a red-lined version of the draft ordinance immediately following
descriptions of the proposed changes.

Add low-income Cambridge residents to Priority A
This expands the definition of a “Group A Priority Applicant” to also give priority to Cambridge residents
making below 50% of AMI. The window to qualify for Economic Empowerment designation has closed
at the state level, so this would create an avenue for people to continue to qualify based on their economic
status. A geographical preference on its own lets anybody buy their way in.

Change Priority B to Exclude Future RMDs
This changes the definition of a “Group B Priority Applicant” to exclude future RMDs (ones that aren’t
already operating/permitted in the city at the time of ordination) from obtaining priority status. I’m also
proposing here to exclude existing RMD’s from obtaining priority A status.

Changes to Permitting Preferences for Priority Applicants
Here I’m proposing to strike the two-year exclusionary period in section 4A, which means the city would
ONLY issue permits to Priority applicants, indefinitely. I’m also proposing that we strike section 4B
entirely, which would mean that the city would NEVER issue permits to non-Priority applicants. Future
councils could of course change either of these, of course.

Changes to Permitting Requirements
Here I am proposing we strike sections 5A2 and 5A3 entirely. By excluding all non-priority applicants
indefinitely, we are giving priority applicants a huge advantage. With that change, it makes sense to strike
these sections because we don’t want to put burdensome requirements on priority applicants that could
ultimately undermine their success. As written, the city could deny a license renewal if a minority-owned
business hires 49% minority employees. I don’t think that is consistent with our intent. We should trust
our priority applicants to have every incentive to lift up their own communities, without imposing
additional restrictions on them and unnecessarily giving the city more power to oppose them.

Clarify Host Community Agreement Process
Where it is mentioned in both 5A10 and 6, we should clarify that the host community agreement is
negotiated through the City Manager’s office.

Enforcement
We should remove the “3 strikes you’re out” provision in section 8 because even a single violation of
selling to an underage minor should be punishable by denial of license.

Chapter 5.50 Cannabis Business Permitting
1. Purpose
This ordinance is intended to create a separate local permitting requirement for Cannabis Retail
Store, Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product Manufacturer and/or Cannabis Transporter
(collectively “Cannabis Business”) applicants to certify compliance with certain conditions in the
public interest prior to being permitted to operate a Cannabis Business in the City. The City
deems it to be in the public interest to give initial permitting preferences for Cannabis Businesses
to Priority Applicants, as defined herein.

2. Definitions
Cannabis Business. A Cannabis Retail Store, Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product
Manufacturer and/or Cannabis Transporter.
Cannabis Cultivator. An entity licensed by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission as

cannabis or marijuana to other cannabis or marijuana establishments, but not to consumers. A
craft marijuana cooperative as defined by state regulation is a type of Cannabis Cultivator.
Cannabis Product Manufacturer. An entity licensed by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control
Commission as a Marijuana Product Manufacturer to obtain, manufacture, process and package
cannabis or marijuana products and to transfer these products to other cannabis or marijuana
establishments, but not to consumers.
Cannabis Retail Store. An establishment authorized to sell or otherwise transfer cannabis or
marijuana products to consumers for use off the premises, but not to cultivate, manufacture,
process, or package cannabis or marijuana products, in accordance with applicable state laws
and regulations. A Cannabis Retail Store may be licensed to operate as a Cannabis or Marijuana
Retailer or registered as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, also known as a Registered
Marijuana Dispensary (hereafter “RMD”), or both, in accordance with applicable applicate state
laws and regulations.
Cannabis Transporter. An entity, not otherwise licensed by the Cannabis Control
Commission, that is licensed to purchase, obtain, and possess cannabis or marijuana, or

cannabis or marijuana products, solely for the purpose of transporting, temporarily storing,
selling and distributing them to cannabis establishments, not for selling to consumers.
Priority Applicant. A person, corporation, or other legal entity applying for a Cannabis
Business permit pursuant to this Chapter to operate in the City who is:
a. Group A Priority Applicant. An Economic Empowerment or Social Equity Program
Applicant certified as such by the Commonwealth’s Cannabis Control Commission; or
a Women or Minority Owned business as certified by the Commonwealth; or a
Cambridge resident earning less than 50% of AMI in the tax year prior to application-to be known as Group A Priority Applicants.

b. Group B Priority Applicant. An RMD operating within the City at the time of
ordination that will sell cannabis products in a Cannabis Retail Store pursuant to the
Commonwealth’s medical use of marijuana laws, either alone or in addition to operating
as a licensed marijuana retailer pursuant to the Commonwealth’s adult use of marijuana
laws-- to be known as Group B Priority Applicants. Those who qualify as Group B
priority applicants cannot also qualify for Group A.

3. Applicability
This Chapter shall apply to any proposed Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product Manufacturer,
Cannabis Retail Store, or Cannabis Transporter that is seeking licensure from the Cannabis
Control Commission on or after the effective date of this Chapter. This Chapter shall not apply
to RMDs that have already been permitted in the City and are not seeking licensure as a

Cannabis Business Ordinance Follow Up Inquiry

At our Ordinance Committee meeting on 11 April to talk about the proposed Cannabis
Business Ordinance, Committee members had a number of questions and concerns, some of
which we asked City staff to address as quickly as possible, so we could reconvene equally
quickly and try to solidify this Ordinance and create adult cannabis sales opportunity in
Cambridge.
Given the Committee’s overarching belief that our Cannabis Business Ordinance should,
as much as possible, try to create a more equitable world, we wanted to know the legal limits the
Council faces in:
1. Altering the proposed 2-year license limitation of .040(b) or even eliminating it
completely.
2. Can we legally require non-equity retail stores to provide shelf or floor space for
permitted equity/empowerment applicants?
3. Can we use any fees generated from cannabis sales in a targeted way to assist
equity/empowerment applicants in areas such as:
a. Subsidized loans
b. Business training
c. Legal assistance
4. Pertaining to Host Community Agreements, which were a choke point in the process
noted during public comment:
a. How much discretion does the Manager have in approving/denying them
b. Can we/should we put specifics about how they are issued in this ordinance
5. If we do not allow all currently permitted RMDs to become adult use retail, how do we

pick which ones do
a. Lottery?
b. Only ones in operation as of a certain date (such as date of ordination)
c. Other?
6. Should we redefine our “Group A” and “Group B” terminology to
a. Set income limits for qualification
b. Set residential requirements to Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Areas.
c. Set criteria for membership in these groups so that if the criteria are not met, the
permit would not be granted (somewhat along the lines of setting out percentage
requirements under .050)
7. Can we drop the number of illegal sales to 1 rather than three prior to allowing for
revocation of a license?
8. Pertaining to the percentage requirements for employees and board members under
.050(a)2 and 3:
a. Is this legal in any way?
b. If it is legal, can we phase in percentage changes over time to allow the makeup to
morph from what exists now in some companies
c. Are convicted felons excluded from participating and, if so, can we insert
language that changes that constraint
9. Given that the state has set ownership limits, can we further limit how many
establishments, and of what type, any one owner has in Cambridge?
10. Would the ordinance be the proper place to put in information about timelines, points of
contact and so forth or would we have a separate guidance document for that?
11. Can we use this Ordinance to set up a process to keep equity/empowerment applicants
from setting up shop virtually, or even literally, next door to each other? There was some
concern expressed that, absent such a limitation, places like Central Square may only
have one non-equity cannabis facility but may have a huge number of equity shops.
12. How can we make sure that Equity and Empowerment applicants are not pitted against
each other? Is that something we should worry about?
13. How would we go about reviewing how successful our attempts at providing an equitable
program actually turn out to be? Can we put relevant language in the Ordinance?
I appreciate the work everyone, including City staff, applicants, members of the public
and Councilors is putting into trying to make this new law and related business opportunities
reflect the drive for justice we all feel. Given the imperfections of the state law within which we
must work, I imagine there are some things we cannot legally do, some things that may be less
clear and some things that are obviously under our jurisdiction. Understanding all of that will
help the Council get to the best possible place.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I, Eric Jonash, owner of 34/36 Fairfield St., attest that I made multiple attempts to reach the
property owner to the rear of us at 58 Haskill St.
We reached out via phone and twice via email, after receiving their contact information
previously. The relocated driveway should no impact on them, as it does not extend past the
house and will not be visible from their property.

Dear Neighborhood Representative:

The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for
review, prior to action by the City Council.
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date
of this letter. If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons. Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone
number. I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply.
As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I
will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting. If I do not receive a response from your
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the
next City Council meeting.
If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner. However, I urge
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely yours,

RE: Volpe Curb Cut at the Location of 55 Broadway
Dear Mayor Marc C. McGovern; Vice Mayor Jan Devereux; Councillors Dennis J. Carlone, Craig A. Kelley,
Alanna M. Mallon, Sumbul Siddiqui, E. Denise Simmons, Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., Quinton Y. Zondervan:
MITIMCo presented a curb cut proposal for the new Volpe Garage to the East Cambridge Planning Team
(ECPT) at it’s March 2, 2019, meeting. The curb cut, as we understand it, would be 20 feet from the
Loughrey Walkway. The Walkway has a pedestrian walk and bicycle track. The curb cut would be 26 feet
wide, have bidirectional traffic, and a security booth. The construction would require the removal of four
street trees.
ECPT resolved to disapprove of the curb cut for the following reasons:
 Stacking. Vehicles stacked on Binney St. waiting to enter the site would interfere with the high
volume of pedestrians and bicycles crossing Binney St to access the adjacent Loughrey Walkway
thereby creating a potential safety hazard.
 Disturbance. Stacked cars in the site would introduce exhaust and noise to the adjacent Loughrey
Walkway, which is maintained as parkland.
 Trees. The curb cut would require the removal of four street trees.
 Existing Curb Cut. There is a pre-existing curb cut not far from the proposed one. Use of this
existing curb cut would solve our three primary concerns.
As we understand, the location of the curb cut is a requirement by the GSA, not MITIMCo. ECPT asks the
City Council to disapprove the curb cut and work with MITIMCo and the GSA to utilize the existing curb cut.
Very truly yours,

Charles T. Hinds
President, ECPT

Re: USDOT Volpe Transportation Center, Binney Street – Curb Cut Application

On behalf of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), we are pleased to submit the attached
application for two proposed curb cuts (the “Western Curb Cut” and the “Eastern Curb Cut”, collectively,
the “Curb Cuts”) in connection with the redevelopment of the John A. Volpe National Transportation
Systems the (“Volpe Center”) at 55 Broadway in Cambridge (the “Site”) by MIT, as the Exchange Partner to
the United States of America, acting by and through the U.S. General Services Administration (the “GSA”),
pursuant to a certain Exchange Agreement between the parties (the “Exchange Agreement”).
Prior to adoption of the online permitting system, the information for both requested curbs required in
Step 3 of the online application would have been entered onto a single written application form. Since
this is not possible in the online system, a single online application has been uploaded containing the
width of one of the curb cuts, with the supplemental information regarding the second curb cut contained
below in this memo. The other required application information - plot plan, abutter forms, plan of
requested conditions, and photographs – are identical for both curb cuts.
VOLPE PROJECT
The proposed project (the “Volpe Project”) includes the demolition of the existing Volpe Center building
and parking lots, and the construction of a new replacement Volpe Center building (the “New Federal
Building”) that the GSA will use to operate as the new Volpe Center for transportation research and
technical offices. The proposed curb cuts will provide access to parking and loading serving the New
Federal Building, which will include a subsurface-level garage containing 300 parking spaces and 18 atgrade temporary parking spaces. The total of 318 parking spaces at the Volpe Project is a reduction from
the current count of 570 parking spaces. Vehicle access and egress will be controlled by a staffed security
booth and by lift-arms and drop-barriers activated by card readers.
CURB CUTS
To provide access to the New Federal Building loading area and garage, the enclosed application
respectfully requests permission from the Cambridge City Council to install two new Curb Cuts along
Binney as shown in the attached Figure 1:
•

The Western Curb Cut, proposed to be 18 feet wide at the Street line (as defined under the City’s
Zoning Ordinance (the “Zoning Ordinance”)), will be used to access the Site. Because of the
existing median in Binney Street, this Curb Cut will allow for only right-in turns. The Western
Curb Cut will be approximately 26 feet from the nearest crosswalk.

•

The Eastern Curb Cut, proposed to be 26 feet wide at the Street line, will contain two lanes. The
westernmost lane will be bidirectional for either ingress or egress depending on the time of day
and the easternmost lane be used exclusively to exit the Site. Only right-turns out will be allowed
due to the Binney Street median. The Eastern Curb Cut is located approximately 840 feet west of
the Third Street right-of-way.

Attachment: Application 55 broadway (APP 2019 #57 : 55 Broadway Arne Abramson Curb Cut)

To whom it may concern,

As shown on Figure 1, the Curb Cuts are separated by a median, 8 feet in width. Due to the Binney Street
median, the right-turn only operation, and the crosswalk’s “upstream” location from the Curb Cuts,
vehicles egressing the New Federal Building will not conflict with the crosswalk.

3.5.a

As shown on the attached Figure 2, the proposed Curb Cuts will be constructed to meet City of
Cambridge standard details and guidelines. As required and as shown on Figure 2, the sidewalk will
continue level across the driveway, and the driveway slope will not exceed 8% within 15 feet of the public
sidewalk or roadway.
The New Federal Building is exempt from the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance; however, MIT and
the GSA have designed the Curb Cuts to comply with the regulations that are generally applicable in the
zoning districts in which the Site is located.
According to the City’s Zoning Map, the Site is located within the Residence (C-2B) and Planned Unit
Development Overlay Districts (PUD-KS and PUD-7) (collectively, the “Districts”). The Curb Cuts comply
with the curb cut regulations applicable to the Districts, as follows:
•

Number of Curb Cuts: Section 6.43.3(c) of the Zoning Ordinance allows a maximum of one curb
cut for every 100 feet of street frontage. The Site includes approximately 400 feet of frontage
along Binney Street, allowing a maximum of four curb cuts for the Site. Only two Curb Cuts are
proposed.

•

Width of Curb Cuts: Section 6.92 of the Zoning Ordinance specifies that loading facilities must
be served by “appropriate means of vehicular access to a street” and “no driveways or curb cuts
shall exceed thirty (30) feet.” Both Curb Cuts are less than the 30-foot maximum. While Section
6.43(a) limits the width of curb cuts serving parking facilities located within residential districts to
20 feet, both of the Curb Cuts are serving both the off-street parking and the loading for the New
Federal Building, justifying the use of Section 6.92’s width dimension.

•

Width of Driveways: Section 6.43.4(a) of the Zoning Ordinance requires that any driveway
serving a parking facility is no less than 10 feet in width. The width of the Curb Cuts described
above are maintained from the curb line at the roadway right of way, through the Street line and
into the driveways serving the Site. As noted above, the widths are 18 feet and 26 feet for the
Western and Eastern Curb Cuts, respectively, in excess of the minimum 10 feet that is required.

•

Distance from Crosswalk: Pursuant to Section 6.43.4(b) of the Zoning Ordinance, no driveway
curb cut may be located closer than twenty five (25) feet to a street intersection or within fifteen
(15) feet of a crosswalk. With respect to the Site, the nearest street intersection with Binney Street
is at Third Street, which is approximately 840 feet from the Eastern Curb Cut. The nearest
crosswalk is located 26 feet west of the Western Curb Cut. Both distances exceed the
requirements of Section 6.43.4(b).

•

Safe Design Standards: Section 6.43.4(c) of the Zoning Ordinance requires the grade and design
of any driveway providing access to an off street parking facility to permit a clear view, to the
driver of any car exiting from the facility, of traffic on the street and of pedestrians. As shown on
Figure 1, drivers of vehicles entering and exiting the garage will have clear and unobstructed
views in either direction along Binney Street, allowing safe ingress and egress. In addition, and as

As described above, the Curb Cuts have been designed in accordance with the City’s standards. In
addition, although the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance do not apply to the New Federal Building, the
Curb Cuts meet or exceed the requirements of such zoning regulations.

Taken together, the Curb Cuts exceed the safe design standards of Section 6.43.4(d).

“How much more joy can you get out of life than being with your dog in a park?” asks Judy
Trockel, one of the founders and driving forces for the past 25 years behind the dog park at
Marymoor Park in King County, Washington. Marymoor Park has been called the
“Disneyland of Dog parks,” not because it is highly developed with attractions and
amenities, but because it is considered by all who go there as just about the perfect park for
dogs and people, as the nearly 800,000 visitors per year attest.
Off-leash dog parks are one of the fastest growing type of parks in cities across the nation.
According to The Trust for Public Land, in its annual survey of the 100 largest cities, the
number of dog parks has grown by more than 40 percent since 2009. NRPA’s 2018 Agency
Performance Review data show that 55 percent of park and recreation agencies now have
established dog parks, and, in conversations with directors of park and rec agencies, most
agencies are either building a dog park or in the planning stage for one. The National Pet
Owners 2017–2018 Survey by the American Pet Products Association reports 60 percent of
U.S. households own a dog. With ever-growing dog ownership by American households,
park agencies across the country are seeing enthusiastic demand for more off-leash dog
areas within public parks.

Dog parks may be built as stand-alone parks or incorporated into existing larger parks. They
are highly attractive to park visitors and often heavily used by residents and destination
visitors. The size of dog parks varies from as small as a small building lot to large areas that
encompass hundreds of acres and provide access to trails, lakes, rivers and even ocean
beaches. But, size and room to roam are only one criteria, perhaps not even the most
important, of what makes a quality dog park.
So, what are the characteristics of a great dog park? What amenities and features do people
— and dogs — love in the parks they visit? This article examines what makes a good dog
park great from the perspective of the designer, the managing agency and volunteer
stewards.
The Designer Perspective
“I design dog parks as I would a children’s playground,” says Ken Smith, principal of Ken
Smith Design Workshop, an award-winning landscape architecture and design firm in the
heart of New York City. “When I started in my profession, there was no body of literature on
how to design dog parks. When I started my firm, we realized that there was a great desire
for areas for dogs in public places. It came up in community board meetings and other
forums, and it led to a demand for the city to provide areas for dogs. As in other parks, the
expectation is that we design areas for dogs, as well as we design them for people.
“I thought that dog parks should be as interesting and fun as a well-designed children’s
playground,” Smith continues. “I look at dog parks as a social space for both dog caretakers
and the dogs themselves.” He believes that the philosophy of design is as important as what
goes in the park.
Smith points out that New York City presents some unique constraints for any type of public
park space. “We constantly adapt designs to fit spaces, and we try to get as much into the
spaces as we can,” he explains. For dog parks, the key elements that must be in the space —
shade, places for dogs to play, ramps and platforms of varying heights for dogs to jump and
run, seating for people, water features and a dog-drinking area — all must be fit to the
space in a harmonious way.
It is important to fit other essential features in the design as well. Smith notes that a good
dog park needs a bulletin board because of the need to communicate with users and for
users to know what is expected of them. In the East River dog park, Smith designed the
bulletin board to fit in a cutout of a large, fake tree. Every dog park needs a storage shed, so,
“We designed ours as an oversize dog house,” he adds.
Smith reports that during a community meeting, dog caretakers expressed a high concern
about sanitation and, therefore, were very concerned about the type of surface that would
be in the dog park. “No one was very excited about the idea of black asphalt, so we used
2/6

brightly colored, highly durable tennis court paints to give it some life,” he says. He believes
that every space he designs for people should have an element of surprise and fun, and,
therefore, added whimsical touches to what might otherwise be a utilitarian space.

The Park Agency Perspective
Phil Macchia is the director of Charleston County Parks and Recreation in South Carolina.
The agency owns and manages the James Island County Park, a dog park that often appears
in the top 10 lists of best dog parks in the country. Macchia says, “We have a huge influx of
people from around the country who visit Charleston County and bring their dogs. We are in
this business for people, and people have dogs. That is just an extension of who we are —
we are in the dog business, too.”
According to Macchia, the visitation at their three dog parks, which are all located within
larger regional parks, is steadily increasing. In addition, they are also seeing demand within
infill development areas near downtown Charleston and areas where millennials are
seeking to live. “Without question, use is growing,” he says. “Our dog parks are as much a
social gathering place as they are a place for people to recreate and exercise with their
dogs. There is a lot of interest in small urban dog runs and mini-dog parks as well.” Macchia
also notes that new urban housing and condo development are taking place where public
open space is scarce, thus, there is a greater need for places for people and their dogs.
The highest priorities for visitors to the department’s dog parks, as in other parks, are that
they must be clean and sanitary. “Shade is also a top priority,” Macchia says. “I can’t
overestimate the importance of shade.” In addition, beyond having a place for dogs to
exercise and run off-leash, there needs to be areas for people to socialize, whether under an
umbrella, under natural shade, or sitting on benches and picnic tables. “And, of course,”
says Macchia, “you need to address all the basics — water for dogs and people, a good inand-out system, well-designed gates and good, clear signage to communicate expectations.”
They have separately fenced areas for large and small dogs, but Macchia notes that in their
dog parks, the small dog areas get relatively little use. “We came to learn that people just
didn’t like to be separated from the areas where all the action was,” he relates.
One of the challenges for them has been to maintain high-quality natural grass turf areas.
“This is a challenge for everyone operating public dog parks. We have tried multiple
strategies — sectioning off areas and periodically closing areas, and other actions. People
just don’t want a big dirt field,” Macchia says. The agency closes its dog parks on a regular
basis to do maintenance, and it adheres to a strict schedule, which it communicates to the
public. He says its maintenance schedule is communicated in multiple ways, including on its
website and on signage in the dog parks. Customers have learned quickly, and the
maintenance program is well-supported by the public.

6.2.a

Attachment: nrpa.org-Designing and Managing Innovative Dog Parks (POR 2019 #222 : Danehy Dog Park improvements)

Charleston County Parks and Recreation goes a step further, according to Macchia. “We
want staff to be able to talk with customers knowledgeably, so we contract out with a
provider who does dog training and who has excellent knowledge of dog behavior and
people behavior.” Because all their dog parks are within larger county parks, there is always
a staff member available to address a complaint or resolve an issue. “With high use there is
the potential for conflicts. It is very important for staff to understand how to deal with
people and to understand dog behavior,” Macchia says.
Charleston County parks is building a new dog park at Wannamaker Park that improves on
each of its previous parks. The new 6.5-acre dog park will have additional parking, a spray
pad for dogs, bathrooms and even a dog washing station. Because the agency has had such
success with programming and special events at the existing dog parks, the new park will be
designed to better host programs and events, such as concerts and food trucks. “We have
found,” Macchia explains, “that events and programming expand our reach and enrich the
user experience. Innovative programs at our dog parks open up the park to a lot more users
and are really well-received by the public.”
Some of their most popular events are Pet Fest, an all-day celebration with games, agility
contests and an evening concert, and include Yappy Hour, a highly popular weekly happy
hour with music and food. Macchia notes that the agency has a beer and wine license and
Yappy Hour is a good revenue producer, as well as a great activity for park users. One of
their most popular events is Dog Day Afternoon, a once-a-year event at the end of the
season in which they open the large wave pools in the regional parks to people and dogs for
the last use of the year. “We had 1,400 people at our large park and 800 at our smaller
park,” he relates. “We charge $15 per dog (humans are free). We have vendors, games and
activities. It is pretty cool.”
Generating revenue from operations and fees is an important priority for the Charleston
County Park and Recreation system. All visitors to the regional parks pay a $2 entrance fee
for access to the regional park, but use of the dog parks within the regional park is free.
While the dog parks, in and of themselves, do not necessarily generate much revenue, they
significantly build numbers for annual passes and daily park entrance fees. According to
Macchia, special events and programs at the dog parks are an excellent source of revenue
as well. One of the best benefits of the dog parks, he believes, is that they create more
opportunities for people, who might not otherwise come to the parks, to visit the parks.
The Volunteer Stewards Perspective
Judy Trockel is one of the founders of “Save Our Dog Area” volunteer group, which became
“Serve Our Dog Area” in 1995. At that time, the nonprofit group took over management of
40 acres within the 620-acre Marymoor Park of King County, Washington, and established it
as an off-leash, voice-control (OLVC) dog area.

4/6

Packet Pg. 385

Attachment: nrpa.org-Designing and Managing Innovative Dog Parks (POR 2019 #222 : Danehy Dog Park improvements)

“Our situation started before the term ‘dog park’ ever existed,” says Trockel, as she
describes the history of how their off-leash dog area came to be. Prior to 1995, the park
agency allowed a “dog training area” within the park. When the master plan for the park was
updated, it did not have a dog training area identified. “It led us to form ‘Save Our Dog Area,’
and to advocate for off-leash recreation,” Trockel relates. “King County finally agreed and
amended the Master Plan for the park, acknowledging the strong public demand and need
for an off-leash dog area. The county entered into a seven-year trial agreement with
S.O.D.A., and we have stewarded the off-leash dog area ever since.”
Trockel continues: “We were just a small advocacy group at the time, and when we received
formal recognition, it was kind of an ‘Oh s***! moment.’ Now, what do we do? We realized
that we just took on a major responsibility. We had to go from being an ad hoc advocacy
group to formal 501(c)3 status as an official stewardship group.
“One of the conditions we agreed to was to maintain the original condition of the park,”
Trockel says. An argument against high-use dog areas is that they cause environmental
degradation of the site. “This was a very important consideration for us, both because of our
ideals and to forestall any future attempt to close the dog use area or convert it to another
use,” Trockel says. “At the hearing, a man stood up, wagging his finger, and said, ‘I guarantee
you that in seven years that area will be destroyed by the presence of dogs,’” she recalls.
“Twenty-three years later, we are very proud of our record in keeping this park in as good a
shape today as it was then. It is a beautiful area along the Sammamish River. There are six
miles of trails, five river access points, and fields and forests to recreate in. We have a
beaver pond, a heronry and beautiful scenery.”
Trockel believes there are three important criteria for having a great dog park. First, the size
of the park needs to be large enough to handle the use. Second, you need to have a citizens’
stewardship group involved. “No matter how many park staff the agency has,” she says,
“there is always a shortage of maintenance staff.” Third, the park agency (city or county)
must allow the park to be successful. This has been very important for their dog area.
“Groups ask me, ‘What do you mean by that?’” Trockel says. “I mean that they let us take
charge of the park and let us do what had to be done. They didn’t tie us up in bureaucracy,
but, when we needed help, they extended a hand in partnership and helped us when we
had jobs that were too big for us to handle alone.”
Trockel believes the park agency has a high degree of trust in S.O.D.A., because the group
established credibility with the agency over the course of many years. “It didn’t just happen
overnight,” she relates. “We built trust, and we, in turn, support the park system in many
ways. It is a great partnership.”
When it comes to managing use with an all-volunteer group, Trockel says the key is to
communicate our founding philosophy and to communicate it frequently to our volunteer
stewards and to park users. We nurture the concept of stewardship — everyone is

responsible for the park. “This is what makes our dog park truly innovative,” she proudly
says.

Attachment: nrpa.org-Designing and Managing Innovative Dog Parks (POR 2019 #222 : Danehy Dog Park improvements)

In terms of managing the dog park, “Off-leash does not mean out of control,” Trockel says.
“It is not our responsibility to control your dog. It is yours. If your dog is not responsive to
your voice control, and you don’t have sufficient recall skills, maybe you shouldn’t come to
this park. Our group is not an enforcement group. We are a stewardship group.
“Dogs are a part of life today,” Trockel adds. “They have gone way beyond their purpose for
hunting and herding. People have a love of them as they do their children. We serve the
need for allowing people to enjoy and recreate with dogs into their daily life.”

The Anatomy of a Great Dog Park
JOHN METCALFE APR 14, 2017

Let one of America’s foremost designers of hound spaces lay out what works (and doesn’t).

Dog parks where pups scamper oﬀ-leash have long been the fastest-growing segment of urban parks in
the U.S., surging in number by 89 percent since 2007. As cities continue to stake out four-legged-friendly
zones, how can we make sure hounds are ge ing the best experiences and not, say, surviving chaotic
mosh pits of mud and snapping teeth?
Leslie Lowe is a landscape architect who helped design the Hugh Rogers Wag Park in Whiteﬁsh,
Montana, dubbed one of the country’s 10 best dog parks in 2015 by USA Today. Her park includes a
wealth of dog-pleasing features, including climbing rocks, tunnels, asphalt trails, a pond for splashing,
shade trees, and an agility course. She’s now plo ing out another in Fernie, British Columbia, and
writing a book about dog-park design. Lowe, who has spent decades working with hunting dogs,
believes that a good dog park replicates the experience of frolicking in the wide-open, ever-stimulating×

“A lot of architects don’t really understand dogs. They’re designing parks as, ‘Well, let’s just put a fence
around it,’” she says. “But when my dogs are in natural se ings, they’re leaping over logs, they’re
climbing on rocks, they’re going under logs. There’s a variety of diﬀerent sensations you’re giving them,
rather than just a ﬂat, grass park with nothing in it.”

1. Give dogs room to roam. It’s not the easiest thing to do in often-cramped cities, but it’s crucial so
problems don’t develop right oﬀ the bat.
“If you have a tiny, 1-acre dog park with narrow entries, then everybody congregates at the gate,” Lowe
says. “So a shy dog or a dog that comes in and is not comfortable, all of a sudden I’ve got a dog dynamic
I can’t really control, and that's when the trigger reactions happen. A dog that can't deal with all of the
stimulus of other dogs, other dogs sniﬃng them, might turn around and its reaction then is to bite or
cause a problem.”

But when they’re allowed to enter a broader terrain—ideally after ﬁrst being taken oﬀ leash in a
separated bullpen, because having leashed and unleashed dogs together can breed conﬂict—things will

Dogs splash in a pond at the Hugh Rogers Wag Park in Whiteﬁsh, Montana. (Leslie Lowe)

2. Set aside smaller spaces, too. Some dogs beneﬁt from a fenced-oﬀ area away from the general crowd.
Smaller pooches might feel intimidated by mondo-sized dogs, for example; there’s even a phenomenon
called “predatory drift” where a larger breed with normally peaceful behavior (in this anecdote, German
Shepherds) will suddenly a ack a li ler dog as if it were prey. Parks will often designate these wee
preserves as “small-dog areas,” though that’s not always accurate—and who wants to support canine
sizeism, anyway?
“I like to call it a ‘special-use area.’ Because sometimes you have shy dogs or older dogs that are
uncomfortable in the big park, and are quite happier in the smaller area where they're less pressured,”
says Lowe. (These li ler cells can also be utilized for obedience classes.)
3. Give them a challenge. “I think it’s important not only to give dogs exercise, but also to exercise their
brains,” Lowe says. In terms of topography, Lowe likes to give dog parks a bunch of surfaces—level
ﬁelds, gentle hills, clumps of rocks that pups can jump on. “I think dogs are like people—they like
variety,” she says. Lowe installed an obstacle course in the Whiteﬁsh park with boulders and tunnels for

4. Keep the water ﬂowing. Water is a must-have, both for drinking and for dogs who love to plunge into
it like a pro wrestler diving oﬀ the top ropes. Water fountains that serve both dogs and their masters are

gated for owners who don’t want their dogs spreading wetness and mud back home at the end of the
day. To the challenge point, water elements can also keep dogs sharp. Lowe’s Fernie park will have an
interactive water feature where dogs can reach out their paws to trigger jets of water from the ground.

The planned dog park in Fernie, B.C., would include (clockwise from top leﬅ): a vegetated plaza with decorative walking paths
and bike racks; a weatherproof pavilion; a “splash paw” water park; and a “big bone hill” with tunnels, a slide, and a climbing
ramp. (Leslie Lowe)

5. Rip out dangerous plants, and bolster helpful ones. Utmost care should be put into eliminating toxic
plants like the sago palm, which can cause liver failure and death in dogs that eat it. Trees, on the other
hand, are a near-necessity, as they provide shade for dogs and people on hot days as well as a nice
aesthetic boost. “For sure, dogs really do enjoy trees,” Lowe says, though “you might have to protect the
trunk of the tree from always ge ing urine on it.” She’s not joking: Regular showers of canine pee can
harm trees, causing “ammonium toxicity” and making their bark weak and vulnerable to disease and
burrowing insects.

a good solution. Swimmable pools provide great exercise for older dogs that can’t run well, but should
be regularly tested so the pups don’t contract anything nasty lapping them. They perhaps should also be

Grass would seem like a good choice for a park’s surface, as it’s pleasant, soft on the paws, and retains
all the earthy and disgusting smells dogs love to hoover. But after rains and the stress of repeated
trampling and digging, not to mention the chemical scorching of urine, grass parks can resemble muddy
hellholes with sloshing craters. For that reason many parks (especially those in cities) go with hard

folks with disabilities and families with strollers.
6. Engage the human visitors. Keeping the place clean is up to the biped guests. “That takes good
signage and perhaps a volunteer group that patrols the park and picks up waste when they see it,” Lowe
says. Decent parks should provide waste stations and baggies, though it’s a ma er of human
responsibility to use them properly.
Catering to humans can also help the park get built in the ﬁrst place. Throw in some benches and
lighting, and you get not just a classy dog park, but a draw for every dog-owning person in the region—
and they might throw in some money to pay for it. “I think Whiteﬁsh raised $200,000 in donations to
build that park, and that was donations from all across the U.S. and Canada,” Lowe says. “When people
travel and they see these really interesting parks, they make that a destination.” The Whiteﬁsh park
a racts 50,000 users a year, she says; that's in a community of roughly 6,600.

Official Seal of Massachusetts to determine whether it may be perpetuating or
promoting hurtful symbolism; and

WHEREAS:

On May 13, 2019, the City Council unanimously adopted Policy Order #3 in support of
Resolve H.2776: Resolve providing for the creation of a special commission relative to
the seal and motto of the Commonwealth; and

WHEREAS:

The special commission created by Resolve H.2776 would investigate and recommend
changes to the State Flag and Seal of the Commonwealth and would include members
of the legislature and representatives of Native Nations of Massachusetts, among
others; and

WHEREAS:

During the public comment period at the May 13, 2019 City Council meeting, the City
Council heard much emotional testimony from members of the Native American
community and others that the symbolism on the state flag is a painful reminder of the
history of oppression and genocide indigenous peoples suffered at the hands of the
colonists; and

WHEREAS:

During the Council’s discussion of Policy Order #3 on May 13, 2019, a question was
raised as to whether the state flag is legally required to be displayed in the Sullivan
Chamber, or if it could be displayed elsewhere in City Hall; and

WHEREAS:

According to the City Solicitor, state law does not specify where in the City’s main or
administrative building the flag of the Commonwealth must be displayed; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the City Solicitor and
the City Hall building staff to identify a suitable location other than the Sullivan
Chamber where the state flag may be displayed in compliance with state law, and to
report back by the summer meeting of July 29, 2019.

WHEREAS:

According to the Cambridge Community Development Department’s April 2019
Cambridge Ground Floor Vacancy Database, a total of nine storefronts city-wide are
listed as having remained vacant for 4+ years, and five for 2+ years, with Harvard
Square containing the greatest number of total vacancies at 17; and

WHEREAS:

There are many causes for these vacancies, whether it be the forced displacement of
small business owners due to inability to sustain increasingly unaffordable rents, or a
landlord’s decision to hold out for a higher-paying tenant, or simply a lack of
investment or neglect on behalf of property owners, many of whom do not reside in
Cambridge and may own multiple retail properties across many locations; and

WHEREAS:

The increase in both the number and longevity of storefront vacancies negatively
impacts those businesses currently operating in our Squares, and can turn previously
vibrant retail districts into blighted areas; and

WHEREAS:

It is in the best interest of the public for the City to mitigate long term storefront
vacancies through the development of more specific definitions and targeted
regulations; and

WHEREAS:

At the April 30, 2019 meeting of the Economic Development and University Relations
Committee, the Cambridge Community Development Department presented on its
recommendations for what might be included in such a policy, which was followed by
a discussion amongst the committee members, city staff, community stakeholders and
business associations, of the potential interventions presented, their benefits and
drawbacks, and additional innovative solutions; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Community
Development Department, Assessor’s Office, and the City Solicitor’s Office on
developing a Vacant Storefront Registration Policy, incorporating in its language the
recommendations discussed at the April 30, 2019 meeting of the Economic
Development and University Relations Committee, such as enacting a requirement that
any ground floor retail property vacant for a time period of 1-2 years register with the
City, regardless of whether the storefront has been intermittently activated, and
possible avenues for incentivizing or otherwise enforcing compliance with such a
requirement; and be it further

WHEREAS:

The prevention of childhood hunger and proper nutrition have been the subject of
national attention due to controversies over school lunch debt; and

WHEREAS:

For low income students who don’t qualify for the free lunch program, paying the cost
of school lunch, even at the reduced price, is either unattainable or causes them to go
into debt; and

WHEREAS:

H585 and S256, An Act to Promote Student Nutrition, has been introduced in both the
House and Senate to ensure that all students, regardless of income, can access school
lunch without going into debt; and

WHEREAS:

The bill makes all school districts which absorb the cost of reduced lunch eligible for
reimbursement by the State Department of Elementary and Secondary Education; and

WHEREAS:

The bill expands the number of students eligible for the free lunch program to include
students under the guardianship of non-parents, students whose families receive SSI,
special needs students formerly in foster care, and all students in school districts with
60% or more students already qualifying for the free lunch program; and

WHEREAS:

The bill prevents employees, agents, and volunteers of school districts from taking
retaliatory action against students solely due to unpaid meal debt, such as: denying
students meals as a form of punishment, disposing of already served meals, serving
alternative meals, or barring the student from extracurriculars, barring the student from
graduation; and

WHEREAS:

Ending childhood hunger and promoting childhood nutrition, especially in schools, are
essential for the physical and emotional wellbeing of a child, as well as the academic
success of students; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

In accordance with its mission to provide critical guidance to the City of Cambridge on
mitigating the effects of housing instability and displacement, the Mayor’s Blue
Ribbon Task Force on Tenant Displacement has sought to identify both where the
greatest funding needs exist in fighting and preventing displacement, as well as
potential opportunities for acquiring additional funding sources; and

WHEREAS:

In anticipation of its comprehensive report of final recommendations for policy change
and resource allocation, the Tenant Displacement Task Force presents below the
following which have come to its attention:
• Due to cuts in federal funding for elder (60+) services, Cambridge and
Somerville Legal Services is no longer able to fund the support services it
provides to Cambridge’s growing population of elders facing eviction from
private housing, and additionally lacks the grant funding flexibility to support
those voucher-holders who have been displaced from our community in
returning to Cambridge; and
• De Novo Center for Justice and Healing, formerly Community Legal Services
and Counseling Center, provides on-location legal aid support at the Middlesex
Session of Eastern Housing Court and every Friday at Cambridge District
Court through its ‘Lawyer for the Day’ Housing Clinic program, coordinated
by one of De Novo’s part-time attorneys; and
• Transition House provides critical services and transitional housing to
Cambridge residents who have experienced DV/IPV and subsequently
displacement or eviction from their homes or are otherwise seeking shelter and
safety from their perpetrator, and, due to the extremely limited supply of
transitional housing and family shelter, particularly for survivors, in
Cambridge, many of these residents are forced to seek shelter outside of the
City; and
• The Task Force’s Education Working Group has been developing a plan for a
series of tenant workshops, and identified The Alliance of Cambridge Tenants
(ACT)--that collective body of tenants and activists allied to organize and
advocate specifically on behalf of tenants’ rights in the City of Cambridge--as
a critical partner in the establishment and implementation of this series; and

Packet Pg. 410

6.12

WHEREAS:

The Tenant Displacement Task Force therefore recommends that additional city funds
be allocated to sponsor the following:
• Cambridge and Somerville Legal Services to expand its services to elder
residents, increase the number of office hours it currently provides at the
Cambridge Multi-Service Center and serve ~ 30 more resident cases each year;
and
• De Novo Center for Justice and Healing to sustain its “Lawyer-A-Day”
program and continue providing much-needed support to those lacking
representation at housing court; and
• Transition House to hire a “Housing Stability Coordinator” who would serve
to both stabilize tenancies and provide mobile case management to more
effectively serve the immense need of displaced DV/ IPV survivors for support
in finding housing in Cambridge; and
• A partnership between the City of Cambridge and the Alliance of Cambridge
Tenants (ACT) that would serve to fund a series of educational workshops and
resources for tenants, as well as support the continuation of the critical services
and advocacy ACT provides for this City’s residents; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of
Finance and Department of Human Services to explore options for incorporating
additional line items in the FY20 Budget to allocate supplemental funds for legal aid
services, housing stabilization and tenant education and organizing to prevent
displacement and address its ramifications on Cambridge residents and families; and be
it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on the matter of these
allocations by September 2019.

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that BioGen, located in Kendall
Square, has recently hired a janitorial contractor that, in an effort to cut costs, has
announced plans to reduce the company’s janitorial staff from 45 individuals to 30
individuals; and

WHEREAS:

This staffing reduction shall lead to a significantly increased workload on the
remaining janitors, even as measures have been announced to scale back the cleaning
operations of the buildings; and

WHEREAS:

The remaining custodial staff will not see any pay increases, despite the fact that they
will almost certainly have heavier workloads in light of the overall reduced custodial
workforce; and

WHEREAS:

The 15 individuals who are laid off from their janitorial jobs at BioGen will add
increased strain to the social safety nets, such as the food stamp programs, the food
pantries, and the affordable housing programs that are already overburdened in
Cambridge and in neighboring communities; and

WHEREAS:

BioGen is a one of the leading companies currently located in the heart of Cambridge’s
thriving biotech sector, and it has been estimated by Forbes.com to be worth over $40
billion dollars, yet it is nevertheless choosing to cut its costs on the backs of its lowestpaid employees; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has regularly gone on record in condemning the practice of
companies and institutions, many of which have valuations worth billions of dollars,
working to reduce their costs by reducing their janitorial staff, and this shameful
practice must be called out and condemned as being antithetical to how we wish to see
businesses conduct themselves in Cambridge; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record strongly urging BioGen to reconsider the reduction
of its janitorial staff, to allow all 45 janitors to maintain their current employment at
the company, and to resist the temptation to reduce its expenditures by cutting its
lowest-paid and most vulnerable employees; and be it further

CPSD Public Participation

Dear Colleagues:
Attached you will find an email Jared Cosulich, founder of The Puzzle School
(www.puzzleschool.com), and I recently sent to the School Committee and Dr. Salim expressing
our thoughts on how CPSD might encourage public submission of innovative educational ideas,
perhaps along the same lines as the City’s successful Participatory Budgeting program.
While we don’t have precise ideas on how this innovative thought experiment should proceed,
Jared and I both believe that the District, and the City as a whole, would be stronger if it were
better able to encourage, process, implement and evaluate educational ideas that originated from
the wider Public.
Of course, acting on this suggestion, or choosing not to act on it, is entirely the responsibility of
the District and the School Committee, but both Jared and I would be happy to talk with any of
you about this issue at your convenience.

Encouraging Outside Innovation in CPSD

Dear School Committee Members and Dr. Salim:
After, in Jared’s case, attempting to start an Innovation School under new state guidelines and, in
Craig’s case, spending a lot of time looking at the CPSD budget and reviewing various schoolrelated outcomes, the two of us have realized that CPSD, like other school districts, does not
have a formal way for innovative ideas from outside District staff to be introduced, evaluated,
approved and piloted. People can make suggestions, of course, but those suggestions follow an
informal path through the District and it is not clear how one could make sure their suggestions
were considered. Similarly, schools have some discretionary funding in their budgets but that,
also, is not a process for handling outside ideas. Given the importance of innovation in
maximizing the effectiveness of any organization, we urge the CPSD to institute a formal
process to handle school-related innovative ideas in a comprehensive, consistent and transparent
manner with the expectation that a certain number of them, based on available funding, will be
piloted, evaluated and possibly be part of the CPSD budget for future years.
A possible, though not entirely relevant, model is the Cambridge’s Participatory Budgeting. A
similar budget for piloting publicly generated ideas in CPSD, when compared with the City
budget, would be roughly $200,000. Challenges in implementing such a program would include:
•
•
•
•

meeting Bargaining Unit constraints
creating appropriate analytical tools to measure a suggestion’s success
determining the range of ideas that could be funded
establishing the process itself and similar administrative issues

We are sure these challenges could be met and, in doing so, CPSD would be opening up the
discussion of how to improve our District to all sorts of people who currently have no clear
method for their ideas, however good or bad, to be evaluated, much less implemented.
Some types of Participatory Budgeting in schools has been explored elsewhere and seems to
have had benefits: https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/pb-in-schools/

Although we are thinking about a process for piloting a wider variety of ideas than are usually
considered through participatory budgeting, we are really just wondering what the ideal process
should be for CPSD to explore new ideas and ensure that the students, teachers, families and the
broader community of CPSD are part of the new idea review process and can review the results,
providing everyone with greater understanding of how CPSD is exploring new ideas for
continuous improvement.

Mayor McGovern was also in attendance to say hello and thank the Task Force members for
their work at the beginning of the meeting.
Mayor McGovern thanked everyone for their work on the Task Force. This has not been a
typical Task Force, because we’ve all been able to see the work as it happens through the Policy
Orders that have come through. He thanked Councillor Mallon for her leadership on this Task
Force and on the issue of the arts.
Councillor Mallon thanked everyone for coming to the last meeting and outlined the agenda for
the evening. She stated that Ben Simon will make a presentation, followed by update from The
Foundry team where they also want to solicit our feedback. She stated that her and Ms. Ascolese
had gone through the past 8 meetings and teased out themes and recommendations that were
discussed throughout the past 9 months. They have been posted in different “buckets” on large
sticky notes on the wall. The group will give feedback, contribute their own, and then we will
have a Task Force wide discussion to get to a consensus.
Councillor Mallon thanked Dennis Benzan, former Councillor, who is a part-owner of La
Fabrica and has generously offered the space, food, and drink tickets for a celebration at the end
of the meeting.
Mr. Simon began his presentation. He gave background on his organization’s attempt to fight
their displacement from the EMF building that closed last year. He stated that we need to be
talking about the role that development plays in erasing artists and arts spaces from the City, and
that this is the most important issue we could be talking about. He thanked Councillor Mallon for
allowing him to speak on this issue, and he put together some ideas that could be significant for
protecting the arts community.

He stated that there is an arts crisis right now including displacement and arts spaces
disappearing. This is not a standalone issue and we have to acknowledge the interconnectivity
between gentrification and displacement. He stated that developers are de facto city planners and
that they are responsible for the disappearance of arts spaces, affordable housing, groceries,
retail, and eateries. There has been a lot of development by MIT which has razed entire city
blocks for biopharma and whatever the rest of their campuses are. Low income renters don’t
think this is for them and they can’t work there.
Mr. Simon shared demographic data which showed that The Port neighborhood has seen its
white population go up 10% and black population decrease 10%. He stated that you cannot drop
thousands of high paying luxury class jobs in a neighborhood and expect no displacement to
happen. He asked why developers should get to do what they want and stated that arts need to be
a bigger part of the conversation. He asked where we draw the line when property owners are
pursuing their profit dreams.
Mr. Simon stated that there is a straightforward solution, which is democratized development
where all voices of a community should be given a say in whether our city should be changing at
all. He stated that it’s an obvious fact that developers should be disempowered because the real
estate market is out of whack, and we need massive public investment to counteract
development. The private sector is unable or unwilling to provide affordability.
Mr. Simon stated that we should not be contracting public land, we should be expanding public
land. He asked about making deals with developers and that we cannot assume benevolence or
neutrality, and seek redress for negativity. He stated that inclusionary units do not help people.
He stated that we need land to build affordable housing and community spaces.
Mr. Simon stated that the attempt to separate arts from the bigger picture won’t get us
fundamental change. It is connected to social justice problems. He quoted Bernie Sanders that
there is a 1% that has rigged the system to their benefit.
Mr. Simon presented his policy ideas. The first was an EMF 2.0: the loss of the EMF was the
loss of the only affordable music rehearsal space, and that a building like EMF is unlikely to be
developed again by the private sector. He stated that the idea here is that people like himself low income artists - need spaces. The most dire consequence of a rigged local economy is the
housing crisis. There are people on the street and people being displaced. It would be right to
build a dedicated rehearsal space with City money, but it would be a good idea to build Cityowned housing units with community arts spaces. He stated Mike Connolly has been talking
about this but that there are definitely legal obstacles. However this is what’s right. He stated that
as a low income renter, what we’re calling affordable housing is actually inaccessible, and that
Mass and Main is being billed as a great victory for affordable housing but it is not. The
inclusionary unit minimum is 50% of the AMI to get a unit. Mr. Simon stated that he is on the
list for a voucher but there’s a 4,000 person waiting list. He stated that buildings are getting
snapped up by developers, stripped, and turned into luxury units which causes real life social
consequences for low income people. He stated that market housing of any sort is not the
solution, but it’s city-owned social housing, whatever it may be. He stated that markets are not
designed to distribute things to everyone, but it gives limited resources to the highest bidder. He

stated that with education we have an idea that everyone deserves an education so everyone gets
one. We are coming around to this idea with healthcare as well, but we haven’t done this with
housing which is a human right. We need to be talking about social housing, and an EMF space
in something like that is a great idea.
Mr. Simon recommended a displacement advisory committee, which would be an ongoing
advisory committee and a modest step forward in the inbalance of power. He suggested that the
committee would meet monthly and would advise the City on displacement impact for proposed
developments and impact on the community. The community should be taking the lead on
development and advise the City on what and if developments are needed.
Mr. Simon suggested redirecting the 1% for arts funding to address the arts crisis but stated there
would probably be some legislative obstacles. He stated that it’s crazy that we have funding
mechanisms going to something like public art when we have a crisis of displacement. We are
rapidly losing artists and arts spaces, but if we have arts spaces, it will slow down artist
displacement. When spaces disappear, it puts a huge financial burden on artists. He stated that
places in Charlestown and Union Square are about to close, and we need to direct money into
funding a City-owned EMF. He stated that the Public Arts Commission benefits one artist but
City owned community arts spaces benefit the whole arts community. This is a significant
amount of money generated by this funding mechanism, but the City says we can build the artist
community an EMF. He stated that this is a reasonable request.
Councillor Mallon thanked Mr. Simon and stated that she wanted to speak to a few aspects of his
presentation. She stated that the last meeting that he wasn’t able to be at involved the Task Force
recommending putting together a working group to figure out how to allocate additional revenue
from both hotel/motel taxes and the Tobin School renovation. She stated that the Task Force had
discussed at the last meeting how funding should not just go to site-based public art but instead
be for the whole artist community. To speak to the housing piece that Mr. Simon discussed - the
displacement advisory committee, Councillor Mallon informed Mr. Simon that Councillor
Siddiqui had been leading a tenant protection and anti-displacement task force, and that they are
looking at displacement and protections. She advised that Mr. Simon’s second recommendation
would likely be a recommendation of Councillor Siddiqui’s task force. Councillor Mallon also
informed everyone that Mr. Mogassabi, Ms. Ascolese, Mr. Roberts, and herself had been
meeting to speak about zoning changes that would protect existing arts spaces and incentivize
additional arts spaces with funding. She stated that Mr. Mogassabi can speak in more detail
about what we may be able to move forward with.
Ms. Shozawa, who shared a spot on the task force with Ms. McKenna, gave a presentation and
update on The Foundry building. She stated that their timeline to open is 2021, and gave an
overview of The Foundry as a City-funded and owned STEAM space with flexible arts and
performance space. She outlined The Foundry team: Martha McKenna is the director of the
Creativity Commons, Sue Cusak is the director of STEAM learning and coordinating teams with
external organizations and public schools. Graduate student Stephanie McKay is a musician,
singer, and songwriter who has merged with churches and synagogues to build new
relationships. Ms. Shozawa does work with the college of art and design. The team has had a
series of 3 community-wide meetings abou flexible performance space for musicians and makers

Ms. Shozawa stated that the community-wide objectives for the building were to have a space
that’s culturally responsive, accessible, inclusive, reducing barriers, community trust, and benefit
for this large, community-funded building that’s coming online in the City.
Ms. Shozawa gave some more specifics on The Foundry. She stated that the building is 50,000
square feet total. It will have 3,300 of flexible performance space, 3,700 square feet of maker
spaces, 2 funded artists in residence, 2,100 square feet of art studios, multi purpose community
meeting rooms, and 19,000 square feet of office, operating space, and a demonstration kitchen.
The market rate office space will fund the rest of the programs in the building so that it’s selfsustaining. The Foundry team has been great at the attention and ethos of how we care for the
arts in the City asking what people want and why. Community feedback informed architectural
design and programming to foster community and community-ownership with an emphasis on
East Cambridge residents - mainly youth and seniors. Their mission is to bridge the
socioeconomic gap and be good stewards of a building that is a vessel of possibility.
Ms. Shozawa stated that artist Candy Chang was being brought to Cambridge this fall in
partnership with The Foundry. She is famous for projects such as “I Wish This Was” and
“Before I Die.” Artists should be in the realm of public space, community engagement, and
social equity. Art should elevate the voices of those not heard.
Councillor Mallon stated that it was interesting to watch this progression, because the City was
gifted the building and had a years long conversation about what to do with it. She stated that
STEM was big at the time but now it’s really taken on an identity as an arts space. She stated that
Biomed Realty is having a conversation and community meetings about the site that was
supposed to be the Constellation Center, at 50,000 square foot arts space, but that didn’t happen.
Biomed has purchased the space and is going to build the arts component. Jennifer Hanley and
Sal Zinno, who are working on the project, have been attending almost every Arts Task Force
meeting and other community meetings to answer the question of what the community needs.
They are having a great opportunity for artists and the community to add their voices to this
conversation at their open house on June 27th.
Stephanie Couch from The Foundry team added to Ms. Shozawa’s presentation, saying that it’s
easy to talk about improvements that they need to make, but that she thought The Foundry was
an example of getting it right. She stated that she did not know of another City that was
providing a space for both arts and STEM to come together under one roof. This offers so many
possibilities. She stated that her generation did not invest as much in the arts as prior ones did.
She stated that she was interested in building connections between artists and those who live and
work in Kendall Square so that we can rekindle investment in the arts and adding more than 1%
contributions. She stated that she heard a lot of interest among artists who want to explore the
intersection of arts and opportunity.
Ms. Johnson stated that she appreciated Mr. Simon’s presentation. She asked that he think
through his comments about displacement and new arts spaces, and to think about community

Attachment: COCO_Arts Task Force_6.24.2019 (COF 2019 #40 : Notes from the Mayor’s Arts Task Force June 24, 2019)

space and workshops for visual artists and crafters. She explained these community meetings
informed their work.

organizations that already exist. She stated that her work at the Community Art Center is the
hardest but most beautiful thing she would ever do. She stated that The Foundry isn’t supposed
to compete with existing organizations, but that it will and it already does. Cambridge has a
congested nonprofit space already and she would like to see concrete ways in which this is going
to be addressed, especially since the City is investing so much money in the space.
Councillor Mallon thanked Ms. Johnson for her comments and asked everyone to think about
them as we move into the recommendations section of the meeting.
Ms. Pradhan stated that change is happening at a rapid pace and that we don’t need another task
force or advisory committee to solve problems. She stated that we need to put into immediate
action the recommendations for this process. She stated that this task force has dealt with
fundamental problems of losing our artists, organizations, and spaces, and that we can come up
with a very powerful recommendation. She stated that we can explore land trusts and City
property, and that once you lose arts spaces, it’s very difficult to bring them back. We have lost a
lot, but we still have a lot to save.
Councillor Mallon instructed everyone to look at the posted recommendations and to start ones
that we should be moving on at the Council immediately so that we can prioritize. She asked
people to write in recommendations where they thought things were missing, and that if their
recommendation didn’t fit neatly into a “bucket” that there was a blank sheet for other ideas.
Ms. Latino stated that she was excited for The Foundry but was nervous about people and
organizations that aren’t the first in the door. There is a perception in the arts community that if
you’re not first, you lose out on a space, and some organizations have greater connections and
ability to make their presence known and get in the door. She asked The Foundry team to ensure
that as the building comes to fruition to make sure that individuals know that no matter what, the
door is open and they haven’t been locked out. They need to find a way to keep bringing new
artists and creators into the space.
Ms. Couch stated that the way The Foundry is structured, all spaces are shared and an artist can
book them for free, market rate, or nonprofit rate for varying lengths. No one person or
organization gets to own anything and it will constantly turn over. There’s also criteria to make
the process fair.
Mr. De Celis asked whether the artist residency would address this.
Ms. Couch replied that right now they can only afford 2 artists in residence, and that there was
also public accountability because the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) still has a
public advisory committee.
Ms. Monestime asked if the building was run by a committee or a board.
Ms. Couch stated that they were setting up a nonprofit, so there will be both a board and an
actual staff for The Foundry. The staff will report to the board.

Mr. Monestime stated that the BID has been newly approved and that they are working on
putting together a board. Ms. Johnson had asked how we build a conscience into the BID, and
stated the importance of values being set in place on day 1. He stated that she will be chairing
one of the BID committees so that the BID will have bylaws that reflect values and we will have
a vision we can constantly revisit.
Ms. Couch stated that bylaws came out of a public process and they have to stay true to the
mission of the building. She stated that the consortium only has a 5 year lease, so if there are
concerns that they are not good stewards of the building, the CRA will not renew their lease.
Councillor Mallon went over the accomplishments of the Task Force so far:
-A commitment for the full 1% of hard construction costs for the Tobin School (about $2
million)
-An allocation from the annual hotel/motel revenue directly to the arts (about $2 million)
-Establishment of the Central Square Improvement fund where at least 25% of the funds will be
allocated to the arts in the Arts and Culture District
-Undertaking an inventory of all existing arts organizations and their funders
-Beginning to build an arts-friendly, “one-stop shop”n on the Licensing Commission website
-Establishing an arts liaison in the Economic Development Division
Councillor Mallon also stated that she heard recommendations about creating land trusts, taking
an inventory of available real estate (buildings, open space) that could be used for arts space
development. She also stated that she will be sending out a note to see who from the Task Force
might be interested in continuing on a working group that will outline guidelines of how to
allocate additional funding from the Tobin School. She stated that it would be great to have an
artist in residence like in New York City, for creative problem solving. She stated that in NYC
they have them in DPW to help the department think creatively.
Councillor Mallon also discussed recommendations related to incentivizing free spaces for
artists. We currently have a 1% for art program for public funding, and MIT has a private 1% for
art program. She stated that we should incentivize other private developers through zoning and
other mechanisms to fund the arts. We also need to support the arts in K-12 schools.
Ms. D’Ambrosio stated that it’s amazing to have $4 million coming online, but that $5 million
for an entire City is still very very small. She stated that if it were her, a concentrated large
change using a critical mass of money each year might be more effective, visible, and tangible
than such a thing spreading of the money - i.e. allocating $5,000 to each artist as opposed to
using $5 million to do something that the entire community can benefit from. She spoke to
quality vs. quantity.
Ms. Latino also asked if there was a way to set aside half the funding per year for several years.
We can use some money now and spread it around, but then save a few million per year so that
one day we could do something like buy a building.
Ms. D’Ambrosio agreed that if you saved $2 million per year, we could have $10 million at the
end of 5 years for a large project.

Councillor Mallon stated that we won’t decide this tonight and that it would be the job of the
working group to figure out how to proceed. She stated that we can also use this money to attract
greater investment, and that CCF can help us connect with organizations that will match gifts or
do challenge grants. We can figure out how to make this small piece bigger.
Ms. Pradhan stated that we don’t want to spread our money so thin that we cannot see the impact
and that every year we should commit to something big.
Ms. Johnson asked how the money is being distributed.
Councillor Mallon stated that there would be a working group coming out of this task force to
decide.
Ms. Peterson stated that Councillor Mallon has been successful in getting the percentage of the
hotel/motel tax, which is annual funding, which is what you really want. Annual money is a base
that you don’t have to go after every year, and that we need to focus on what percentage of the
hotel/motel taxes arts gets annually.
Ms. D’Ambrosio confirmed that ultimately the working group would make a recommendation to
the City Manager who would then make a recommendation to the Council.
Ms. Peterson stated not to discount the role Councillor Mallon has played because everything
needs to come back for Council approval.
Mr. Weeks stated that the Barr Foundation money has been critical and has accomplished a
tremendous amount for the arts in Boston.
Ms. Johnson stated that statewide, arts organizations are missing liquidity which stifles
creativity.
Councillor Mallon stated that if Mr. DiMuro was here, he would be arguing that we need to take
care of our existing organizations so they don’t continue to get lost.
Ms. Pradhan stated that one of the issues with public benefits money and new development is
that it often gets disbursed into small things or put into issues that consistently come up, or used
in ways that benefit newcomers. She stated that people who really live through changes like Mr.
Simon and other artists get left out of the equation, and that we need flexible money that gets
distributed based on what the needs of the community are. She suggested that money is an arts
issue and that we need to get money that people can voice their ideas about instead of always
tying it up and stifling creative potential.
Councillor Mallon stated that there are some development projects where part of the community
benefits packages are now including money for arts. She stated that many developers were at our
meeting on funding, which kickstarted a conversation on how they’re displacing people and what
responsibility they have to support the community and artists.

7.2.a

The Task Force went over recommendations “bucket” by “bucket” with members stopping to
call out certain recommendations that they had questions about or wanted prioritized.
Public Art
• Value statement in Zoning Ordinance

mediums
• Priority bump for local artists
• Broaden the definition of public art in the percent for art ordinance
• Maintain and update the public art website
• Include community narrative for each piece
• Increase percent for art ordinance higher than 1%
• Encourage the City to be fully compliant with all future percent for art ordinances on all new
projects
Ms. Harrigan asked what a priority bump for local artists was.
Councillor Mallon answered that when we put out a call for artists, local artists will get a
preference.
Cultural District
• Reconvene the cultural district advisory committee
• Backwards mapping for redesignation
• Consider expanding the committee to add the Port and Coast neighborhoods
• Update zoning and design guidelines to incentivize arts-related uses
• Create an arts and culture anchor or collaborative
• BID civic/cultural compact
• How does the BID have a conscience?
• Create placekeeping and equity mission for the cultural district
• Concentrate arts and cultural activity in and around the district to communicate the range of
arts activities and programming for the highest visibility
• Ensure places for the community, particularly youth, to include them in the economic
development that comes with the arts
• Think about the 5 minute “pedestrian shed” (5 minute walk) when programming and creating
spaces to keep things accessible
Councillor Mallon stated that the Council just signed off on the BID Monday night and Mr.
Monestime did a great job explaining how it will have a cultural impact. The BID has a
conscience and an arts and culture component, not just cleaning, safety, and that’s it.

The Task Force split up to review, make, and prioritize final recommendations.

Packet Pg. 440

7.2.a

Councillor Mallon asked about a recommendation to concentrate programming and visibility in
the cultural district that communicated the range of arts activities available.
Ms. Pradhan answered that was her recommendation. She meant that you should feel like you’ve
arrived in arts and culture when you walk into the district. She stated you feel it in the evening
with lights, but in the daytime we need more murals, buskers, and more so you feel like you’re in
a place.
Mr. Monestime stated that resident Peter Valentine wants the Square renamed Starlight Square
and the telephone polls painted pink.
Ms. Johnson stated that she wanted to add the Port and Coast neighborhoods to the advisory
committee.
Mr. De Celis explained the district boundaries and the 5 minute pedestrian shed, which is what
most people are comfortable walking. If you live in the Port or Coast you’re able to walk to the
Central Square Theater. He stated that this is a best practice to keep in mind.
Arts Economy
• Soft skills classes from the Arts Council
• Presentation,s budgets, community engagement, entrepreneurship, business
development, seed funding
• Office hours with the Economic Development Division
• Walk-ins, artist specific workshops, business side of arts
• Partner with the Office of Tourism
• Cultural events and festivals, maintain a calendar of arts and tourism events
• Public market in Central with vendor spaces prioritizing local culture markers
• Owned as a community land trust
• Include culinary as a “craft”
Councillor Mallon stated that there are soft skills classes with the Arts Council but they need to
be better funded. She stated that during the budget process, she asked EDD, the Arts Council,
and the Office of Tourism to convene monthly to figure out how to make a bigger impact in the
community, especially as economic drivers in the City that can all work together.
Mr. De Celis asked if the three departments would have access to the City Manager.
Ms. Peterson responded that she would also be at the meetings. She informed everyone that the
Office of Tourism is 95% City funded and should be focusing on the local and bringing people in
on a more neighborhood level. They want to engage with businesses and local artists.

• All new place-based or Cambridge-based arts initiatives should require a shared lead
partnership with an existing Cambridge arts or culture institution
• Don’t create new things on your own
• Where will the ART theater in Harvard Square be going? What will happen to that space?
Ms. Johnson emphasized that academic institutions should not create new things on their own,
and that they should partner with existing institutions.
Ms. Pradhan stated that ART is moving from Harvard Square and asked what was happening to
the space. She stressed that universities have enormous arts resources like the museums, and that
we don’t really have a reference to that in our task force discussions. We should think about what
our goals for our relationships with these museums are.
Racial Equity
• Hire a consultant for an equity audit
• Art juries, community outreach, RFQ process, artists/artwork represented
• Update Arts Council mission statement and budget narrative to include diversity and equity
goals

Attachment: COCO_Arts Task Force_6.24.2019 (COF 2019 #40 : Notes from the Mayor’s Arts Task Force June 24, 2019)

Councillor Mallon stated that the recommendation of a public market that is community owned
could go back to the mention at a former meeting of using the AME Church as an arts space or
anchor.

Packet Pg. 442

Mr. Pierre stated that he had a new recommendation to present to the group to piggyback off of a
comment Mr. Weeks had made. He stated that we need to be honest about arts living up to
diversity goals and talk about going into communities that don’t have the same knowledge,
experience, and love of arts that we do. Perhaps aren’t isn’t high on their priority list because of
where they are economically or they’re facing other challenges. We need to go into these
communities and talk about the benefits of having arts in their lives, and help them become
artists themselves.
Councillor Mallon stated that this goes back to Ms. Latino’s point about how people not “in the
know” access spaces that are opening.
Ms. Latino added that people have to feel that they have access and belong. She referenced the
recent incident at the MFA. She stated that even if you have a free ticket to a venue, how do you
feel like you can go and belong.
Councillor Mallon stated that we don’t talk about culture enough, and to think about cultural
events like the Iftar at City Hall, which shouldn’t only happen because we have a Muslim City
Councillor who is responsible for the event. The events in our City need to fully represent the
cultures that are here. We also have some events at City Hall that are still going on, and she isn’t
sure why, or that they should still be happening.
Ms. Pradhan stated the importance of celebrating the amazing richness of cultures that we have.
Other Ideas
• Displace local art in municipal buildings with artists’ bio and info
• Should be effectively/prominently displayed and publicly accessible
• Future arts and culture office director
• Artist networking portal
• A “LinkedIn” for artists - ways to for developers, event planners, artists to network
• Can establish a group on LinkedIn so that artists can join and follow each other
• Write an arts plan and implementation strategy for the City
• Separate arts and public celebrations into its own Council committee
• Role clarity re: the Arts Council
• Immediate resources dedicated to the acquisition of real estate for artist studios and rehearsal
space
• Ex) EMF, Green St. studios, so that we don’t lose more spaces
• Inventory of City property that can be dedicated to arts
• Invest in actual people across the arts spectrum
• Ask what spaces can be used at night or after-hours
• Ex) CRLS
Councillor Mallon also discussed the recommendation that all of these recommendations can be
consolidated into a living arts plan for the City. We also need to ask what will happen to the task
force, because in the future we need to ensure that we’re still bringing people’s voices to the

Ms. Harrigan commented that it’s true that certain cultures get attention at the City level, such as
the Caribbean Heritage celebration that just happened, but we need to ensure that all cultures are
recognized, seen, and get equitable funds and resources. She stated that it’s a complaint that they
get in the Mayor’s Office, that some cultures get more resources and celebration than others.
Ms. Johnson stated that it’s important that in the future, we seek to deeply understand why we
use arts and culture separately.
Ms. D’Ambrosio stated that we need an examination of the Arts Council, its jobs, and the jobs
within the Arts Council. She stated that sometimes things seem like an octopus where each arm
doesn’t know what the other is doing.
Ms. Harrigan emphasized the recommendation of dedicated arts spaces within existing
properties.
Ms. D’Ambrosio asked if there were pockets of time within these properties that could be shared.
She stated she hates saying this because artists shouldn’t be squeezed into after hours space, but
there could be creative opportunities here.
Mr. Pierre asked what CRLS would like like if, once students left, there were a whole group of
people that came in at 6 or 9pm. There is no other building as nice and it’s a shame the lights go
out at 6pm.
Ms. Johnson stated that the City has too much money, which causes us to keep seeing a need and
generating a new thing. She stated the importance of having a cohesive approach and plan.
Ms. Pradhan agreed and stated the need to make this a living document so that not everything is
fractured.
Councillor Mallon briefly thanked the group for tonight’s meeting, and for sharing their
thoughts, dreams, and hopes for the past 9 months.
The meeting was adjourned at 8:00pm.

there is a Councillor responsible and has the ability to bring forward ideas.

Date: June 20, 2019
Subject: Establishing the Equitable Regulation of the Cannabis Industry in the City of Cambridge

Establishing the Equitable Regulation of the Cannabis
Industry in the City of Cambridge
Since the last Ordinance Committee meeting (May 9, 2019), held to discuss the proposed
Cannabis Business Permitting ordinance, Councillors Zondervan and Siddiqui have individually
met with the City Solicitor's office to discuss additional proposed amendments. As new draft
language for the ordinance has not been made available to us thus far, we are describing these
amendments conceptually for discussion and consideration at the upcoming Ordinance
Committee meeting (June 27, 2019) in this memo, in the hope that the Committee can provide
guidance to the City Solicitor’s office so that the ordinance language can be finalized
subsequent to that meeting, and can be presented to the full Council in time for final deliberation
and adoption of the ordinance at the summer meeting (July 29, 2019).

Proposed Amendments to the Ordinance:
Chapter 5.50 Cannabis Business Permitting
020.a Group A Priority Applicant definition:
Add a Cambridge residency requirement to Social Equity applicants as follows:
