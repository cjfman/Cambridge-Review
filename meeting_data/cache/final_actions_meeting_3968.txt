To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $250,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment
Fund Community Development Department Extraordinary Expenditures Account to provide
additional funds necessary to complete the Sennott Park renovation project in two phases.
Approximately $2.05 million has been appropriated for the renovation of Sennott Park through
CPA funding since FY17. In late summer 2021, construction began at the park, which is heavily
used and located in the Port Neighborhood. Since that time, and in response to public input and
requests from the City Council, the City has worked with the contractor to shift to a two-phased
construction process in order to allow portions of this important neighborhood open space to
remain accessible during the construction period. This appropriation will cover additional costs
incurred by the contractor as well as any unexpected costs due to a longer construction schedule,
increases in the cost of materials and other contingencies.
A two-phased construction schedule impacts insurance, scheduling, and planning and
administration costs. Construction methods must be adjusted due to reduced staging areas and
deployment of subcontractors. This process also results in limited multi-tasking, and multiple
mobilizations, which further impact costs and schedule.
The first phase of work will keep approximately ¾-acre of the field open to the public while the
playground and basketball courts are under construction. The remaining field work will
commence once the playground and courts are completed and reopened. The entire renovation
project is expected to be completed by Spring 2023.

May 17, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council:
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-13, regarding next steps on implementation of
Universal Pre-K, received from Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff reports the
following:
The Birth to 3rd Grade (B3) Partnership is an organized system of support with the vision to ensure that
high quality, early learning experiences are affordable and accessible to all children and families creating
a seamless experience beginning with prenatal care through the early elementary years. Through these
experiences, children will maximize their full potential academically, socially, emotionally, and
physically.
In the five years since its inception, the cornerstones of Birth to 3rd Third Grade Partnership’s work has
included (1) funding scholarships for preschoolers from low-income families so that they may attend high
quality preschool at one of over a dozen community-based early learning centers; (2) the quality
improvement program that supports early learning centers and home-based child care providers in
achieving higher levels of quality through coaching, mentoring, and funding for upgraded materials; (3)
professional development for the early childhood workforce that includes access to college coursework,
professional learning communities, communities of practice, and (4) workshops on a variety of content
areas; and strengthening the connection between the early childhood community and health, mental
health, and home visiting programs across the city.
The work to begin development of a Universal Pre-K (UPK) plan was intended to follow the December
2019 Roundtable with the City Council and School Committee where the City Manager and
Superintendent of Schools and their teams presented the report of the Universal Pre-Kindergarten Study
commissioned by the City and Schools. That report analyzed and evaluated two different models of UPK
programs for four-year olds and recommended a preferred model and a framework of essential elements
required to build a high quality UPK system. The preferred model, which was endorsed by the City
Manager and Superintendent of Schools, was a mixed-delivery system in which UPK would be offered
through a network of providers, including the Cambridge Public Schools, Human Services and
community-based programs. This was the most common model nationally and is the model being
proposed by the Biden Administration in its proposed plan.

Packet Pg. 79

2.3

The report identified the critical elements of high quality UPK programs including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Meets the needs of families in term of location, hours, and weeks of care
Equity of access
Diverse, competent and consistent staff
Research-based curriculum
Developmentally appropriate indoor and outdoor learning spaces
Systems for establishing quality criteria and on-going evaluation
Robust family engagement and services

Right now, programs that serve 4 year-olds include the CPS JK, Special Start, Scholars College and
Montessori Programs, DHSP preschool programs, community-based programs, for-profit programs and
family childcare. One of the biggest challenges today is that Cambridge does not have enough capacity in
high quality programs to serve all 4 year-olds. Addressing this capacity issue requires addressing a
number of issues including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increasing the number of existing programs that meet the state quality rating standards
Expanding the number of Cambridge children served by Cambridge-based providers that also
serve children from outside Cambridge
Exploring changes in JK-K school programs to create 4 year-old classrooms
Increasing slots for 4 year-olds without displacing slots for 3 year-olds
Developing a pipeline of qualified teachers and career pathways with a focus on a diverse
workforce
Increasing workforce compensation
Implementing evidence-based curriculum

The City Manager committed at the December meeting that the City would begin the process to create a
Universal Pre-Kindergarten Program for Cambridge’s 4 year-olds. He acknowledged then that there
were multiple issues and decisions that would need to be addressed over the coming years and that the
annual operating costs for such a program could ultimately exceed 20 million dollars, not including
capital costs for any additional city or school classrooms.
The initial steps identified that evening to begin the process included:
•
•
•

•
•

Convening community-based providers for feedback and input
Convening Principals and JK/K teachers for feedback and input
Gathering additional data from Cambridge programs to understand how many program slots are
filled by Cambridge children and how many slots which are not dedicated to Cambridge children
could become dedicated
Gathering more data about the Cambridge pre-school workforce including credentials and
compensation
Gathering information and feedback from families about their needs and interests

Packet Pg. 80

2.3

Before the pandemic upended services and planning, there was a convening with the City Manager and
the Superintendent of Schools and their teams with over 80 leaders and staff of community-based
providers. In that session, there was lots of excitement and numerous concerns about how the creation of
UPK, even as a mixed delivery system, would impact existing programs. For example, most programs
serve 3 and 4 year-olds in mixed age classrooms and concerns were expressed about whether a new
system would require serving 4 year olds separately. We made the commitment then to continue to work
with programs as we moved forward.
None of the additional steps that would have begun in 2020 or been continued in 2021 were able to move
forward because of the impact of the pandemic. Teachers and Principals were focused appropriately on
serving students virtually and then in person. Community-Based programs were struggling to figure out
how and whether to re-open. Those programs that re-opened were serving smaller groups of children and
so gathering data about slots, who was in them and how that might be able to be changed did not make
sense during the pandemic.
While it is still a challenging moment for schools and preschool programs, we expect to be able to begin
the planning work as we had hoped to do in 2020. The list of tasks to begin the work remains the same.
And many critical efforts did move forward despite the pandemic that support the city’s effort to expand
high quality preschool opportunities for 4 year-olds.
First, the City has continued to explore opportunities to expand capacity for pre-school programs serving
3 and 4 year-olds. As the City Council knows, Just a Start has been working on expanding its housing
development at 402 Rindge Avenue together with additional space for employment and training and other
community needs. The City has been working with Just A Start to support creation of 4 additional
preschool classrooms that would serve some of the unmet need for preschools, especially in North
Cambridge. Just A Start is also engaged in planning around another housing development on New Street
and the City has been working with Just A Start to explore whether two additional preschool classrooms
could be built as part of that development. These classrooms are in addition to the 4 new classrooms
being designed as part of the Tobin/Vassal Lane project.
Second, the City committed to funding the expansion of Head Start’s four Cambridge classrooms to fullday, full-year programs to better meet the needs of low-income families. Head Start was not able to open
in person over the last year but has continued to support children and families virtually. Head Start is
working with the Birth to 3rd Partnership now to reopen sites for the fall. In addition, the City has been
working with the Cambridge Housing Authority to renovate or replace the Head Start classrooms as part
of the Jefferson Park housing development so that the spaces for Head Start will be exemplary early
childhood classrooms.
Third, the City has through its own preschool programs shifted both the cost structure and the economic
mix of the families represented in the programs. As a result of the preschool lottery, 50% of the children
served through the City programs are now low income. The tuition each family pays is based on their
income so that depending on family income, tuition is between 1% and 8% of family income.

Packet Pg. 81

2.3

Fourth, the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has also created a new School Readiness Manager position that
is in the process of being filled. The School Readiness Manager will lead the effort to ensure a seamless
transition from the wide variety of early childhood settings in the community to the public school system.
A key role of this individual will be to support the Executive Director in the UPK planning work. The
Executive Director will work closely with the Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education, the
School Department’s Chief Financial Officer and the Assistant City Manager for Human Services in
moving forward the planning process. We look forward to reporting back to the City Council and to the
School Committee on the progress of that work.
Although the planning work has not moved forward, it is important not to lose sight of how critically
important the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has been this year in helping to prevent an even greater loss
of programming for young children. Although the expansion of programming and the launching of the
UPK planning process was impacted by the pandemic, the Birth to 3rd team was able to provide deep
support to its program quality and scholarship sites without having any of those sites permanently close as
happened with other early childhood providers within the city, state, and nationally. Community-based
early childhood programs and home-based providers alike credit the guidance and support of The Birth to
3rd Grade Partnership for their ability to adjust to the changing state child care requirements, continue to
serve children and families, and to survive and thrive during the very tumultuous public health and
economic crisis this year has brought; a time in which equity and access across our society became
glaringly more evident. This qualitative information demonstrates the positive impact the work of the
Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has on the early childhood workforce, children, families, and the broader
community.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report 21-41, which requesting that the City Manager work with all
relevant City departments, the Central Square BID, and the MBTA to close Massachusetts
Avenue from Prospect Street to Sidney Street on Friday and Saturday evenings from 7:00pm to
1:00am through September 2021, please be advised of the following:
Representatives from multiple departments met to discuss this potential closure, including the
City Manager’s Office, the Fire Department, the Police Department, the City Solicitor’s Office,
the Traffic, Parking, + Transportation Department, the Community Development Department,
the Department of Public Works, and the License Commission. Representatives from the public
safety departments (Fire and Police) expressed significant concerns about a full closure of this
segment of Massachusetts Avenue, including the following specific issues:
•

•

•

This segment of Massachusetts Avenue is a major response route for the Fire
Department in calls for assistance for both fire and emergency medical services. Closing
off this section of roadway would present tremendous tactical challenges for the Fire
Department to adequately protect the city and respond to calls from the community and
is not acceptable from a fire safety perspective.
The Engine Six firehouse on River Street is currently closed for repairs. While the Fire
Department has adjusted their response plans to properly cover Cambridgeport during
this closure, any closure of Massachusetts Avenue could delay the response of units and
present an added risk to the community.
The rerouting of various trucks and commercial vehicles onto smaller side streets could
also place the residents, pedestrians, and bicycles on those streets at additional risk due
to the multiple right-angle turns required for that rerouting. It is also important to note
that Massachusetts Avenue between Sydney Street and Pleasant Street is part of the
hazardous materials truck route that must be used in place of the Prudential tunnel on the
Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), so any closure would move those trucks onto smaller
streets and require additional turning movements through the early morning hours.

Packet Pg. 83

2.4

•

The Police Department expressed significant concerns regarding the recurring staffing
required to support such a closure, given the traffic and crowd control that would be
required to maintain a safe and organized closure (potentially including the need to
deploy blocking trucks or hard barriers).

Based on these concerns from public safety agencies, the City Solicitor also expressed concerns
regarding any such closure.
Staff also consulted with service planning staff from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority (MBTA), to understand their perspective on this idea. The MBTA is not supportive of
this recurring closure, particularly given the number of different bus routes, the volume of
customers that travel in this area, and the transfer connections available to the Red Line. Specific
concerns include confusion for customers, the staffing and other resources required to plan and
implement significant detours on multiple routes, bus stop relocation challenges, and the
increased walking distance for transferring customers, particularly those with disabilities.
Based on all these concerns, I am not comfortable moving forward with a plan that involves a
full closure of Massachusetts Avenue between Sydney Street and Prospect Street on Friday and
Saturday evenings, as suggested in the original Policy Order. However, the City remains
supportive of implementing more limited street closures, as we have done in other locations
around the City in response to COVID-19 and to address other key needs, particularly where
these closures help directly support the vitality of local businesses and local neighborhoods.
Within Central Square, we would be open to working with the Central Square Business
Improvement District (BID) and individual businesses to create additional spaces on side streets
for outdoor dining, retail sales, or other supportive uses. In creating these spaces, we also need to
be sensitive to the specific needs of these groups and nearby residents and ensure that any
changes recognize and respond both to the businesses’ operations as well as the residents’
concerns. Implementation of any street closures would also need to be done in a manner that
increases the attractiveness of the area, which typically requires programming and activation.
We are currently engaged with the Central Square BID and appropriate City staff to discuss
additional opportunities for side street closures that will help support the local businesses,
residents and the Cultural District as a whole.

Pond and along Rindge Avenue

In response to the above-mentioned policy order, the Department of Public Works (DPW),
Community Development Department (CDD), and Traffic, Parking and Transportation
(TP&T) report the following:
The North Cambridge site containing Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding environs is owned
by IQHQ. Much of the 26-acre site is enclosed by fencing, including Jerry’s Pond (also
known as Jerry’s Pit). Jerry’s Pond is an artificial pond that was created about 1870 from a
disused clay pit. The clay pit was subsequently filled with water and an icehouse was built
around 1907. Though the property was privately owned, Jerry’s Pit was well known as a
neighborhood swimming hole until the Francis J. McCrehan Pool opened in 1961. The
property has housed other uses throughout its history, including manufacturing.
IQHQ has been working with the community and city staff, as they create their
development plans for the site, including improvements for the area around Jerry’s Pond.
The IQHQ team has indicated that they share the goals of improving access to Jerry’s Pond,
improving connections to nearby open spaces, and enhancing facilities for pedestrians and
cyclists, while responsibly managing the environmental conditions on the site.
Key elements of the plan include:
Boardwalks along Rindge Avenue and the eastern side of Jerry’s Pond to provide
opportunities for people to walk along the pond.
Picnic Areas for community use, with over 100 seats on benches and at picnic
tables.

From: Harvard Square Advisory Committee
Date: September 7, 2021
Re:

2 Bennett Street - Exterior Improvements

Deputy Director
Chief of Administration

Overview
KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief of Planning

The Harvard Square Advisory Committee (the “Committee”) met on Thursday, August
26, 2021 to discuss the application by Jason Doo of Wusong Road for various exterior
improvements. The meeting was conducted pursuant to the provisions of Section 20.50
of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance in advance of the applicant’s request for a variance
from the Board of Zoning Appeal (BZA). Committee members present were Allison
Crosbie, Lauren Curry, Kari Kuelzer, Sara Li, Steven Ng, Alexandra Offiong, and Nicola
Williams. After discussion, the Committee decided unanimously to forward a report to
the BZA with a positive recommendation.
Proposal Description
The applicant proposes to install signage, a fence, bollards, and lighting on and around
the existing building at 2 Bennett Street. The project requires a variance from the BZA
because Section 20.55.1.1 of the Zoning Ordinance states that no sign on the outside of
a building may extend higher than 20 feet above grade; the applicant proposes one wall
sign that measures 24 feet 6 inches above grade. The project has already received a
Certificate of Appropriateness from the Cambridge Historical Commission, which is
attached. The use of the building will remain unchanged as it will continue to be a
restaurant.
Committee Comments
Members of the Committee were overwhelmingly supportive of the applicant’s overall
proposal. Many Committee members noted that the proposal shows a careful attention
to detail and is informed by the particular challenges of the site. They appreciated the
applicant’s decision to locate the entrance of the restaurant on Mt. Auburn Street and
found that the proposed exterior improvements will help draw people to the site.

IRAM FAROOQ

Board of Zoning Appeal

Committee members found that the variance for the wall sign on Mt. Auburn Street
facing the garage was appropriate. They believed that locating the sign within the
architectural brickwork of the building is a sensitive solution and provides crucial
visibility for the business. Committee members noted that the scale and context of the
building necessitates the size and placement of the proposed sign. They also
appreciated that the lease restricts the use of illumination to business hours.

3.1.a

2 Bennett Street – Report to Board of Zoning Appeal

Given the Committee’s discussion, a motion was made and seconded to forward a report to the BZA
with a positive recommendation that the BZA grant the requested variance on the condition that
illumination is restricted to the hours of the business’s operation. All seven members present voted in
favor.

Respectfully submitted for the Committee,

Sarah Scott
Associate Zoning Planner

Attachment: application (APP 2021 #47 : 2 Bennett Street Wusong Road Projecting Sign)

Committee members suggested that the applicant revise their proposal to include additional materials
that show the necessity of granting zoning relief. Some members recommended including a
neighborhood-scale map, site plan, and/or aerial photograph to put the site in context. Others
recommended also including a key plan that identifies where all the proposed signs are located.

MGL chapter 152, §25C(6) also states that “every state or local licensing agency shall withhold the issuance or
renewal of a license or permit to operate a business or to construct buildings in the commonwealth for any
applicant who has not produced acceptable evidence of compliance with the insurance coverage required.”
Additionally, MGL chapter 152, §25C(7) states “Neither the commonwealth nor any of its political subdivisions shall
enter into any contract for the performance of public work until acceptable evidence of compliance with the insurance
requirements of this chapter have been presented to the contracting authority.”
Applicants
Please fill out the workers’ compensation affidavit completely, by checking the boxes that apply to your situation and, if
necessary, supply sub-contractor(s) name(s), address(es) and phone number(s) along with their certificate(s) of
insurance. Limited Liability Companies (LLC) or Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP) with no employees other than the
members or partners, are not required to carry workers’ compensation insurance. If an LLC or LLP does have
employees, a policy is required. Be advised that this affidavit may be submitted to the Department of Industrial
Accidents for confirmation of insurance coverage. Also be sure to sign and date the affidavit. The affidavit should
be returned to the city or town that the application for the permit or license is being requested, not the Department of
Industrial Accidents. Should you have any questions regarding the law or if you are required to obtain a workers’
compensation policy, please call the Department at the number listed below. Self-insured companies should enter their
self-insurance license number on the appropriate line.
City or Town Officials
Please be sure that the affidavit is complete and printed legibly. The Department has provided a space at the bottom
of the affidavit for you to fill out in the event the Office of Investigations has to contact you regarding the applicant.
Please be sure to fill in the permit/license number which will be used as a reference number. In addition, an applicant
that must submit multiple permit/license applications in any given year, need only submit one affidavit indicating current
policy information (if necessary) and under “Job Site Address” the applicant should write “all locations in ______(city or
town).” A copy of the affidavit that has been officially stamped or marked by the city or town may be provided to the
applicant as proof that a valid affidavit is on file for future permits or licenses. A new affidavit must be filled out each
year. Where a home owner or citizen is obtaining a license or permit not related to any business or commercial venture
(i.e. a dog license or permit to burn leaves etc.) said person is NOT required to complete this affidavit.

The Department’s address, telephone and fax number:

Workers’ Compensation benefits will be paid to Massachusetts employees only. Pursuant to Endorsement WC 20 03 06 B, no authorization is given to pay
claims for benefits to employees in states other than Massachusetts if the insured hires, or has hired those employees outside of Massachusetts.
This certificate of insurance shows the policy in force on the date that this certificate was issued (unless the expiration date on the above policy precedes the
issue date of this certificate of insurance). The status of this coverage can be monitored daily by accessing the Proof of Coverage - Coverage Verification
Search tool at www.mass.gov/lwd/workers-compensation/investigations/.

Dear Mayor, City Councilors, City Manager, City Clerk and Mr. Riviello
As I wrote to Mr. Riviello before, why are public commenting and status changes not available for issues related to the
Cycling Ordinance implementation? There should be a new category in the SeeClickFix to report issues related to the
Cycling Ordinance implementation.
This issue should be kept open until the solid waste division of DPW decides what to do. And since the City chose to
implement a dedicated bus lane without allowing loading at any time, City should abide by the new rules and not
impede traffic flow even for essential services like garbage pick up. TP&T should have thought this through. If DPW is
allowed to pick up trash during morning rush hour, so should all the other delivery, car ride pickups/drop offs etc.
Thank you for your help in resolving this,
All the best,
Young

Notes from your Neighbors in The North and an Invite for a community stroll!

Good Morning,
I want to share with you what the impacts of the Mass Ave street changes are in as much "real time" as possible. This is
my third email to this group (except for Adreas) and not one person has yet to respond. It makes me think that you may
not be reading these. I hope that's not true. My goal is not to berate but rather to ask questions and provide you with
information from our neighborhood to inform your policy and mandate approaches. To make such drastic changes and
then think about impact makes absolutely no sense. Who plans like that? I hope all of you are taking the time to
wander west along the ave at typical busy times to observe the functionality of the changes. Urban communities are
layered and complicated, like a rubik's cube. Good planning should take into account that when you make a change it
affects the other pieces of the cube, making it more, or sometimes less, functional. What has happened overnight,
literally, is that the changes made are quickly decreasing the functionality of commercial and residential land uses coexisting.
Yesterday morning I exchanged aggrieved salutations with the City Paint manager who was standing in the middle of the
street trying to coach his staff who were pulling up in two City Paint commercial trucks. They have to park in the bus
lane to load up and the truck that delivers the paint has to do the same.
This morning I had a nice conversation with two gentlemen who were parking on my street and were heading to work
with their hardhats and tool belts. I said good morning and they graciously asked if I mind if they parked there (I think
they thought I was going to be upset). I said it was of course fine and asked if they were working on the house at the top
of the street. No, they were part of the crew for the renovations happening at Burns Apartments (Cambridge Housing
Authority renovation and as I've mentioned before, in full disclosure, I am a CHA Commissioner). They then went to
explain how they couldn't believe that they showed up to work and they couldn't park and they were all circling the
neighborhoods for parking. I am not telling you this so that you ticket them. PLEASE DO NOT TICKET THEM. I am telling
you this so you understand how myopic this change is.
Now, I can see the wheels turning in your heads about how the CHA (and other developers) should have to identify and
provide parking for contractors. This is a small but still important piece of the costly domino effect of poorly vetted
infrastructure change. At tonight's CHA meeting we are talking about the cost of the construction of our affordable and
public housing. I hope you all have the opportunity to read the CHA's analysis. We are having this discussion after the
planning board and others in the public at large questioned (good questions) the cost of producing affordable
housing. As a side note, I have spent my 36-year career in affordable housing and what the CHA has produced is without
a doubt one of the best and most comprehensive analyses of why costs are so high. Having to pay for parking (versus
contractors using metered parking) is just another cost added and may appear small on its own but along with all the
other "small" city and other requirements, continues to add up. During my time on the BZA I was the only board
member who wanted Harvard to provide parking for contractors, and I was told by our city solicitor that "we" i.e. the
city, could not direct Harvard to do this. Hence, the 5+ year permanent use of public parking along Oxford and Kirkland
Streets for contractors working on the never ending Harvard projects.
You are planning and thinking of affordable housing and streetscapes in silos. They, like vibrant commercial spaces,
multi-modal transportation and city fiscal resources are all threads of the same cloth. The point being there needs to be

consistency in our public policies that have impacts on public infrastructure and our citizens. And not just consistency,
but transparency and predictability.
Also, it is my understanding that the city has refused to get involved in the negotiations and or subsidization of parking
for small, independent businesses affected by these changes. So, Season to Taste is now paying $1,000/month for
parking to a nearby property owner for parking for its customers. If you haven't been there 1. you need to go, it's an
amazing food experience and 2. it only has a dozen small seating areas, so this is not pocket change for them.
My other observation yesterday was the van, for what looks like a new business going into the commercial strip
between Alberta Terrace and Dudley Street, unloading supplies into its storefront had to park in the bus lane. Where
else would it go? I am sure they signed their lease without knowing what was happening on the street. I will reach out
to them to find out and report back.
Finally - what do all those arrows on the street mean? And why do some pieces of the bus lanes have red paint and
others don't? I am so visually confused.
Andreas - I know you responded by my neighbor Mark about being willing to work with all involved parties. We would
have all been better served if that happened before the changes (and yes I am going to be a broken record about that
because how this was done reeks of arrogance and a sense of superiority and I use my Headspace app daily to maintain
my composure). But we need specifics about what working with others looks like. I would be willing, with the help of
my neighbors, to plan a neighborhood stroll one evening, early enough to stop into businesses like City Paint before they
close, and late enough to talk to our small restaurateurs before the arrival of that night's customers. It would be great if
others from Community Development and the Council joined as well.
How about Wednesday or Thursday evening at 4:00 on December 15 or 16? I can ask Sandy at Joe Sent Me if we can
gather there afterwards to discuss what we have heard and how we can proceed together.
Thank you - I look forward to hearing from all of you.

Update #2- Store Fronts

Today I counted the vacant stores along Mass Ave.
From Alewife to Dudley there are zero
From Dudley to Porter there are 17.
In 2019 I did this and there were 14.
Three additional vacancies in 2 years probably should be seen as not bad considering the state of
things.
I want everyone to keep these numbers in mind as the vacancies increase over the next 1-3 years
due to the Mass Ave parking ban.

Mass Ave and Davis square.
How is everyone loving the new lane system on mass Ave (I mean ironically)?! I have a
suggestion, yes we need more bus lanes and we need more bike lanes but this seems a very short
sighted and totally impractical solution - forcing cars into side streets is one sideffect, lack of
parking for small businesses, I could go on. A compromise could be, make the bus lanes ‘active’
at rush hour times and free for cars at other times. With regards to Davis square - make it
pedestrianized at non rush hour (1000-1500) times (to allow for deliveries in the early morning
and some traffic to move through etc), turn it into a social hub, an actual ‘square’. People can
safely walk, go to businesses, hang out etc. anyway, thoughts of the day. Happy thanksgiving

Steve Pemberton

If there's a bus in sight, then the lane isn't acting as intended. It's meant to be a superhighway for
buses meaning at any given moment you shouldn't see a bus because it should have sped on by.
The metric these should be judged on is not if you see buses, but if public transit is now faster
than private transit to get from A to B. If so, it is a success and people need to change their
habits.

If you live on one of the side streets that empty onto mass Ave (I’m on Newbury, a one way with
mass Ave as the only option) it’s totally unsafe. Bike lanes sure, but trying to pull out to leave is
really difficult and practically impossible. I think bus lanes only being active during rush hour is
a solid compromise.

It took me a half hour to get from Rindge to Yorktown Street at 5:40 last night and then when I
got Season to Taste Catering for a pick-up, there was no place to pull over. My inconvenience is
one thing, but this change to the parking and pick-up situation is completely unfair to the small
businesses in North Cambridge. And on top of that, during my half hour drive 7 blocks up Mass
Ave there were no more than three outbound bicyclists (probably owing to the cold weather).
Cars coming out of the residential side streets trying to turn into or across Mass Ave were
routinely grid-locking many of the minor intersections because the traffic was so backed up they
had to fight to get across. On my way back down Mass Ave, it's a good thing I watch my right
side regularly because a lone inbound cyclist just blew through one of our new little bicycle red
lights as I was trying to turn with my green light onto Cedar. Let's share the road, let's follow the
rules, and if you can't follow the rules (red lights!) could we please get some enforcement for our
tax dollars that have made bicycle commuting easier for Arlington residents. The bus and bicycle
lane experiment in North Cambridge is a complete disaster in Traffic Planning that is causing
problems all up and down Mass Ave for residents and businesses. This needs to be seriously
reconsidered or reversed.

Gridlock on Mass Ave During Rush Hour

Hi Louis,
What are you doing about the gridlock that is happening everyday at rush hour in the morning and evening due to the
new bus lanes and bike lanes? By the way, they go mostly unused as shown in this picture from last night. We need two
car/truck lanes during rush hour.

Dear Councilor Nolan,
I requested the RFP and contract for Dudley Street to Alewife Brook Parkway Bike Safety Implementation Plan with the
contract for the actual implementation in mind to see if the rushed installation of the Plan on Dudley Street was driven
by the contract. Instead, I received the contracts for Engineering Services Related to Separated Bicycle Lanes which
means they will be applicable to remaining Cycling Safety Ordinance implementation plans. It is too late for the Upper
Mass Ave project but I want to make sure the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department is more transparent and
share any pertinent information received from the contractor with the public in a timely manner.
Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully yours,

Dear Councilor Nolan,
Once again, I am totally shocked by the lack of transparency and accountability.
I requested and received the request for proposal and signed contracts related to Duley Street to Alewife Brook Parkway
Cycling Safety Improvement project.
Without even analyzing the terms of contract in detail, I wanted to pass along the following findings
1. Kleinfelder and Toole Design, the contractor, requested an amendment valued at $40,439 on 12/22/2020 for
designing the separated bike lane for Dudley Street to Alewife Brook Parkway segment
2. City approved the request on February 16, 2021

Attachment: Young Kim_Urgent request to pull this communication for discussion on Monday's City Council Meeting (COM 680 #2021 : A

3. The contractor submitted a second amendment on 5/13/2021 to extend project duration from June 30, 2021 to
12/31/2021. The City approved this request on 5/17/2021. The reason for the extension was to post
implementation data collection in the fall of 2021 and analysis in the winter of 2021.
Yet, the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department, with the contractor's collected data related to bike lanes and
other contract required documents, didn't hold a community meeting until Sept. 14 and didn't share any of the
contractor's findings. I, for one, was under the impression the design was done by Mr. Wolfe and his staff.
The main reason TP&T gave for the rushed implementation was to meet the Cycling Safety Implementation mandated
deadline. From the first look at the records I obtained through this Public Record Request, I seriously doubt their claim
that they couldn't delay the implementation until more robust community meetings could be held.
I will study the contract more in depth and will submit additional Public Records Requests to obtain other documents as
necessary. I really would like to know what City got for $40,439 and when.
I beg you to please introduce a policy order to look into the way this project was rushed through causing such furor in
the community.
Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim

Public Comment before the Cambridge City Council
Thank you for the opportunity to offer comments about Calendar Item #1, regarding campaign
contributions. My name is Andy Zucker, and I live at 35 Winslow Street in Cambridge.
I support Ordinance #2020-27 to reduce or limit campaign donations from those who seek
assistance from the city that would result in a direct financial benefit to the donor. My hope is
that the City Council will pass this ordinance so that citizens of Cambridge have increased faith
in the integrity of the Council’s work.
Citizens want to know there isn’t corruption in city government, and I am not suggesting that
there is. But above and beyond that, maintaining people’s confidence in government is an
important goal and the Council should pass this ordinance to avoid the appearance of undue
influence based on financial contributions.
In some election cycles Council candidates have spent more than $100,000 on their campaigns,
far more than the average. When real estate developers or others with special financial interests
contribute lots of money to help elect a candidate, the appearance of paying for favorable
treatment is unavoidable. Candidates and Council members obviously do not want to be
suspected of being unduly influenced by campaign donations. At the same time, candidates also
need money to run their campaigns.
The commonsense approach to address these opposing needs is to limit the size of contributions
that donors can give if they have special financial interests that come before the City Council.
There are already limits on the size of campaign contributions, so that concept itself is certainly
not new. However, the proposed ordinance would put more stringent limits on contributions
from donors seeking direct financial benefits. The result would be greater confidence in the
integrity of Cambridge city government.
Thank you.

Still concerned about the campaign finance proposal

Dear City Councillors ‐
I don't like to be in a position of opposing campaign finance reform. I hope you will be able to amend the proposal
before you so that it is workable. But right now, even with the Solicitor's proposed amendments closing the citizens'
petition issue, it still has problems.
(1) If the intent is to apply to landowner‐driven land use changes, why does it apply to zoning changes but not to
landmarking applications? Landmarking applications can be weaponized to enhance property values and those who
apply to landmark their properties should be seen as seeking financial reward from the city.
(2) The definition of a Business Entity is still confusing and overbroad. Clause (v) says any shareholder who is also an
employee counts as a part of a business entity ‐ but that would apply to any employee who is partly compensated in
stock, which is a common practice at many employers. Clause (vi) extends the definition of a Business Entity to any
"affiliate" but does not define "affiliate" ‐ in the case of MIT, for instance, this might apply to any professor or student.
Having a narrow scope for the definition of a business entity is important. What if I'm a business owner who does
business with the city and I get in a fight with my brother, and he wants to ruin my business by making me ineligible? He
can just donate $201 to a candidate and there's nothing I can do about it.
Having a clear scope for the definition of a business entity is also important. An applicant must be able to trace down all
possible contributors in order to file their mandatory disclosure forms, otherwise the forms don't work. Or alternatively,
what if I don't realize I'm regulated, I make a contribution, and then 31 days later I want to do business with the city and
learn that I am regulated? There's no way for me to cure my contribution.
(3) 2.130.020(B)(iii) prohibits business entities that are applicants from contributing to any PAC, regardless of whether
that PAC has anything to do with Cambridge. That seems wrong.
There's nothing wrong with copying good legislation. If we adopted something closer to Somerville's ordinance, that
would be great. Most of the problems with the current text are in the changes that have been made FROM Somerville's
ordinance. Somerville's ordinance hits developers when they apply for special permits, not zoning changes, which is a
much cleaner and more effective way of focusing the scope on big developers.
Lastly, to put this all in perspective, let's remember that developer money is not the "big money" in Cambridge politics.
The "big money" in Cambridge politics is a small number of wealthy individuals who consistently give the maximum
allowed campaign contribution amount to multiple candidates, while also giving large sums to IEPACs. These individuals
exist on all sides and their influence is no less pernicious.

campaign donations

Dear Councilors:
I cannot be at the meeting today. This note is to express my strong support for limiting campaign donations
from anyone doing business with the city, including developers planning to work or currently working in
Cambridge.
I know from my own experience that donors to campaigns have earned the ear of the recipient of those
donations. Without any devious intent candidates who need money every two years are quite understandably
inclined to accept what is offered. The only way to stop the influence, or (at least) the perception of influence
of donors on policy is to set limits on certain kinds of donors.
Thank you for your attention.

December 6, 2021
Cambridge City Council
My name is Christopher Mackin. I reside at 48 JFK Street in Harvard Square. I am
speaking in favor of Councilor Dennis Carlone’s proposed municipal ordinance #
2020‐27 to reduce or limit campaign contributions from donors seeking to enter
into a contract, seeking approval for a special permit or up‐zoning, seeking to
acquire real estate from the city, or seeking financial assistance from the city.
With the recent City Council election behind us, now is the time to act on this
proposed ordinance.
This ordinance is a common‐sense step in the direction of getting money out of
politics. A measure that most all sitting councilors, the City Manager and most
citizens would presumably applaud if it applied to candidates for Federal office in
Congress should apply equally to local affairs. The intent of this ordinance as I see
it is not to challenge the ethics of sitting or prospective Councilors. It instead
challenges the ethics and introduces transparency to those wishing to do business
or be in a position to benefit from Council actions with regard to future
development.
Since 2016 our neighbors in Somerville have successfully taken the lead on this
issue with an ordinance preventing “Pay to Play” donations from developers and
others seeking to influence local policy. Checks written to try to influence policy
have been returned. Somerville citizens can rest assured that decisions in their
city are being made strictly on merit.
The citizens of Cambridge deserve the same level of assurance. Any future
challenges to this proposed ordinance should be resisted in conjunction with our
neighbors in Somerville and we should encourage other municipalities to join the
‘no pay to play’ wagon train. Thanks are due to Councilor Carlone for raising this
issue consistently. I hope you will join him, as many of you have in the past, to do
what is necessary to get these ideas into law.

Dennis Carlone's ordinance to limit campaign donations

City Councillors,
I am in full support of Dennis Carlone’s ordinance to limit campaign donations to no more than $200/year for those doing business in the
city of Cambridge. I believe in transparency in government. People/Corporations who contribute to elections, who are seeking to
seek special permits, up‐zoning petitions, purchasers of real estate, as well as those seeking city financial help should have to fill out a
disclosure forms on their contributions.

I hope you vote in favor of Dennis' ordinance.

Best,

Proposed Campaign Finance Ordinance

To: Cambridge City Councillors
Re: POR 2020 #240
There could not be a better time for the council to enact the proposed ordinance that would limit
campaign donations from those seeking to do business with the city or those seeking special permits or
up-zoning.
In November voters approved a charter question that will give councillors greater authority over the
appointments of members of boards and commissions. Though its approval process, the incoming city
council will likely play a larger role in the development and shaping of the city.
The voters have expressed confidence in the council. Now it is time for the council to assure the
residents that those with the most to gain will not be allowed to even attempt to exert undue influence.
I urge the entire council to unanimously enact this ordinance. It would be an important gesture even for
those who see it merely as a gesture. It would be a move toward greater transparency and responsible
governance. It would confirm to the residents that as the council expands its authority to govern, it is
willing to govern itself.
Respectfully,
Bernice Buresh

campaign donation ordinance

Dear Cambridge City Council,
I am writing with a comment on the campaign donation ordinance being discussed tonight. A better way to reduce the
role of politics in building decisions then you should reduce the need for BZA and other entities by making more building
possible as‐of‐right. If it is possible to meet the market demand for housing in Cambridge without need for appeals then
the decisions of these parts of city government will be less financially consequential.

proposed amendments to the campaign finance ordinance

Dear Cambridge City Councilors,
I am disturbed by these amendments. I feel that, first of all, they are addressing a non-existent
problem, but by doing so, implying that local corruption does exist.
I am also disturbed that this will create an uneven playing field which will give those residents with
access to individuals with greater giving power an undue advantage since individual donations are
not limited.
I think this issue needs further thinking.
Many thanks for your consideration.

Urge approval of D. Carlone's ordinance to limit campaign donations

City Councilors:
I strongly urge approval of the Carlone ordinance to limit Council candidate campaign donations, as has been done in Somerville, Ma.
Cambridge citizens deserve full transparency in decision making at all levels of City government. Campaign donations should not
influence City government policy or projects, the awarding of special permits, or the attention of Councilors—as appears to be the trend.
The City of Cambridge is made up of numerous, distinct stakeholders. Each are important; not all have money. All stakeholders should
have an equal opportunity to help direct the future of our common community. It is not right—it is never right—that certain stakeholders
hold considerably more sway over Councilor influence & decisions because of their ability to make large campaign donations.
I would venture a guess that Councilors who have received such campaign donations do not necessarily recognize the influence that
this past financial support has or appears to have on their positions & decisions. As is human nature, we all ‘think that we are above’
that kind of influence. All the more reason to approve the Carlone ordinance to limit campaign donations.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
D.R. Biba

Tonight’s City Council meeting order #1

Dear Mr. Wilson,
I am submitting my comments to Policy Order Item #1:
That the City Manager is requested to confer with appropriate departments on what the standard public
process will be prior to implementing new sections of bike lanes, and what general evaluation process will
take place post‐installation
to be included in the full agenda packet.
Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Councilors,
My name is Cynthia Hughes and I am a co‐owner of Fast Phil’s at 2528 Massachusetts Ave
This Policy Order requests that the City Manager conduct a study to collect relevant economic data relating to business
impacts from bike lane installations, which will help inform future installations of bike lanes along commercial
corridors. I am here to tell you about the economic impact on our business that took us 18 years to build and to tell you
that we need help now to mitigate our business losses due to removing the parking meters on Mass Ave and all the
other parking up Mass Ave towards Arlington
We are in fear of losing our business because customers do not have readily accessible parking spaces. We want to
thank the Traffic, Parking and Transportation for putting three handicap parking spaces on our block but most of our
clients do not have handicap permits and the police will not let them park in those spaces while getting a haircut. We
needed ONE spot not three. I asked for a 15 minute parking spot I was told it was too dangerous but then all of a
sudden they put a handicap in the same spot that they said was too dangerous for a regular spot And the 15 minute
loading zone parking time allowed for vehicles with passenger plates in the bus lane during 9 AM to 10 PMdoesn’t do
anything for somebody getting a haircut. We once were a very busy shop we could have anywhere from 10 to 15 people
waiting for a haircut there is no way that one 15 minutes but would do anything for any of my customers I am sure none
of you want your hair stylist to rush your hair cut in that amount of time to have a 15 minute spot expire parking and
Haircut included in the 15 minutes. I spend my entire day at work answering the telephone trying to explain to people
where to park which is nowhere. I spend another part of the day running outside telling people not to park out front
that it is now a handicap spot. We are just done our business is down more than 75% since this has been implemented.
I’m begging you to help us we will never survive this how could this happen to us after barely coming out of the
pandemic. We were so happy that once people got vaccinated they were not afraid to come back anymore we were very
busy again until this happened now this has happened especially before the holidays and we had no notice either. How
do people think that it’s OK to put a small business that took 18 years to build out of business just like that. I have many
families that cannot take public transportation they come from quite a distance I have lots of people who do not live in
immediate area that will not ride a bicycle either or can. I am deeply concerned for my future I am too old to start over
somewhere else I will not be able to afford my mortgage or for the education of my sons college which I was able to
before. The two hour parking meters on the side streets are ridiculous shared between so many different people and
places. They have not been available for my customers yet and now the neighbors are mad at our business because they
think that they are our customers parking on their street. This whole thing was rushed without consideration for
anybody but themselves

Public Comment: City Council Session 530pm Monday 6DEC21 - Calendar Item #1 CAMPAIGN
FINANCE

Honorable Council and Clerk I speak tonight in support of Calendar Item #1 - CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCE
The idea that people seeking financial gains from the City of Cambridge can legally make financial
contributions to the election campaigns of City officials who – if elected - will help decide whether they
receive those gains, seems preposterous. It is so preposterous that when a City Council policy order
was proposed in 2019 requesting the City Manager to direct the City Solicitor to provide guidance on
creating an ordinance to reduce campaign donations from donors with business dealings with the City
of Cambridge, the City Council approved it unanimously. Unfortunately that guidance has just now
been forthcoming.

A year ago, Councilor Carlone drafted and proposed a Campaign Finance ordinance for Council
consideration but it was sidetracked by one Councilor’s exercise of their Charter Right to delay
debate. That delay has continued now for an entire year and no progress on this major issue has yet
been made.

One of the advantages of an issue this vital is that so many people want their views about it to be
heard that public comments are reduced to just two minutes per speaker, so my time is already more

But the many previous speakers before me have already spoken eloquently in support of this critically

opponents who say it should be defeated because it’s too broad, too narrow or too unfinished to be
worth the time to edit it into final excellence are fooling nobody. This ordinance absolutely deserves a
unanimous vote to move it on to final editing and ordination. The public trust demands it.

Campaign finance limitations

Dear city leaders and officials,
Don't let money and special interests have input on our political system at any level.
Give more constituents a better chance to voice and impact policies by limiting contributions, as we have seen
succesfully passed in Somerville.
Let the community and needs of our future take precedence over for‐profit politics.
Our city has already seen the negative affect of construction and real estate lobbies in dominating the landscape of
development instead of city planners and residents.
I urge you to vote to limit campaign contributions!

Petition to limit donations

Dear Mr. Pasquale and City Councilors.
I am writing to express my very strong support for the petition to limit donations to any of the departments or
individuals of our City. It should be abundantly clear by now of the corrosive impact of money on the integrity of our
democratic institutions. The ability of money to undermine truly democratic and representative institutions is by now
well documented. It is unfortunately the case that elected representatives can, and have, been unduly influenced by
financial donations. I have lived in Cambridge for over 50 years and am proud of the integrity and progressive nature of
our City government. I would not want to see that undermined by allowing financial donations to sway decisions that
impact the lives of all Cambridge citizens. This is especially true with regard to real estate interests. I have seen some
changes to the overall character of the architecture, density, and quality of housing in Cambridge that are deeply
troubling. I would hoped that going forward any decisions about these and other matters would not be influenced by
partisan financial interests.
Sincerely,
Frank Paolitto

Support for campaign finance reforms

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance in support of the proposed campaign finance reform ordinance to limit
campaign contributions from people or entities doing business with the city. The ordinance would decrease the
appearance of the influence of money in our local politics. It is a balanced solution that still allows $200 contributions.
Such donors will be required to fill out disclosure forms on their political contributions.
This ordinance will help protect our elections from the undue influence of those with the deepest pockets. It will
increase transparency and good governance, especially now that councillors will be voting on who can join boards.
The Cambridge Residents Alliance has long supported limiting campaign donations from people doing business with the
city. We ask that all of you vote in favor of this ordinance. We want to see this become law this year.
Thanks for your consideration,

Urging your support for campaign finance reform

As a long time resident of Cambridge I remain concerned about the possibility ‐ or even "optics" ‐ that outsiders who
contribute to councillors' election campaigns influence policy.
In this polarized moment across the country and here at home in Cambridge, politics should be free and clear of any
influence of those who seek political favor or to do business with the city. Trust in elected officials is fragile and even the
appearance of undue influence erodes trust further.
For the sake of good governance for the people of Cambridge, I urge you to vote Monday evening in support of
Ordinance #2020-27. (A municipal ordinance to reduce or limit campaign donations from donors seeking to enter into a
contract, seeking approval for a special permit or up-zoning, seeking to acquire real estate from the city, or seeking
financial assistance from the city.)

Please support Calendar Item #1 Campaign Finance Reform and End Developer-Councilor Cuddleups

It is not offensive or divisive to suggest any councilor is influenced by campaign donations. It is probably more correct to
say that developers donate to councilors who they think are favorable to their interests. Those councilors will vote the
way they had already intended to vote and they will get re‐elected. The neighborhoods who get the unwanted
development pay the price but can't get their candidates elected because of the unfair advantage a better financed
incumbent has.
Limiting donations to $200/year puts wealthy investors and developers on the same playing field with the rest of us. Like
auditing, this will help keep honest people honest. We wouldn't eliminate auditing because it offends people who aren't
going to commit fraud.

Mr. Carlone's proposal to limit campaign donations coming from commercial interests wanting to do business with the city
is something that I, and many of my fellow residents, support fully. Special interests have no place in our society. We have
already gotten rid of 2 council members in the last elections, and replaced them with ones that do not support donations
from developers. We will continue to voice our satisfaction by removing them one by one, year after year, until we can all
agree that we, the people of Cambridge, decide what goes on in our city, not big corporations who donate to politicians to
meet their goal.

As a concerned citizen of Cambridge, I write this letter to voice my opinion and support for
Councilor Carlone’s proposal that the time for campaign finance reform is not only now but
very much overdue.
Reducing campaign donations from donors seeking to enter a contract with the city, or from
those seeking approval for a special permit or up‐zoning, or from those seeking to acquire city
real estate, or even from those seeking financial assistance from the city are neither onerous
nor oppressive conditions.
If Somerville and cities and counties in New Jersey can do this, so can Cambridge. This
ordinance does not restrict city residents from exercising their rights. As written, this ordinance
applies only to anyone who seeks to do business with the City of Cambridge; and, only anyone
who seeks financial gain from working with the city, will be restricted to a $200 campaign
donation.

Campaign Finance Reform

My name is Rachel Wyon. I've been a resident of Cambridge for 37 years and a homeowner
for 27 years. I'm a mother, retired teacher in the Cambridge Public Schools, and an
advocate for environmental justice which includes equity and justice for all, taking into
account past inequalities and injustices.
I wholeheartedly support the policy order for Campaign Finance Reform as presented by
Councilor Carlone. This is a step forward toward getting money out of politics and
preventing those with more money having sway and influence over city projects and
policies. It makes sense that it applies to anyone who seeks to do

business with the City of Cambridge. Anyone who seeks financial
gain from working with the city will be restricted to a $200
donation.
Quoting from an article on Friends Committee on National Legislation (July 2018):

"Whether initiated on the local, state, or even national level, leveling the playing field
for campaign funding tends to result in:
Greater racial and class diversity among donors
Increased number of low-dollar donors and constituent participation
More women running for office
More quality time with average constituents
Better policies as a result
Both reforming the way private money flows in our elections and demanding
transparency are essential to ensure that the voices of all voters are equally respected.
..."
By approving this policy order, Cambridge will join other communities to help further
campaign finance reform on the state and national level.
We will all benefit by getting money out of politics.
Thank you.

In support of the "get money out of politics" ordinance

Dear Councillors,
I am writing in support of Councillor Carlone's proposed ordinance to limit campaign donations from any individual
seeking business with the City of Cambridge. We should be doing all we can to eliminate conflicts of interest and get
money out of politics.
Sincerely,

campaign finance ordinance

Dear City Council,
I'm writing in support of the proposed ordinance (Ordinance #2020‐ 27) to reform campaign financing for candidates for
city council. It is important that councilors be above any appearance of financial influence by those who may seek
benefit from their decisions, particularly for matters such as development that impact all citizens. I believe that citizens'
voices should all carry equal weight regardless of whether they have the ability to contribute money.
Thank you for your consideration.
Best regards,
Ryan

Support ordinance to limit campaign donations

As resident homeowners of Cambridge we strongly support Agenda Item #1, Councilor Carlone’s ordinance to reduce
campaign donations to no more than $200/year from donors seeking a contract with the city, including special permits,
up‐zoning petitions, and zoning petitions; purchasers of real estate; and those seeking city financial help.
This ordinance would remove the substantial advantage larger campaign donations can provide, of easing donor access
to elected officials and influencing their actions.
Based on our experience, we feel the ordinance is a much‐needed and fair way to level the playing field of influence.

Limit campaign donations from individuals doing business with city of Cambridge

I strongly support limiting campaign donations from individuals doing business with the city.
Minimally, it needs to be a limited amount, say, no more than $500. Too many decisions about
development in the city, notably proposals for re-zoning the city and low income housing, have
been pushed by City Councilors who are heavily funded by real estate developers, including
some from outside of Cambridge. This is nothing less than the corruption of the political
system.

Real Estate Donations and City Policy

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
Accumulatively tens of thousands of dollars in donations go to Cambridge City Council elections from special interest
groups – notably Real Estate development. Many of these donations are from individuals and interests outside of
Cambridge itself. Since many of our elected Councillors chose not to take these donations, it is clear that this kind of
funding is NOT essential to successfully running for election or reelection.
This issue is especially important now that City Councillors will be allowed to approve every person on our city judiciary
groups ‐ the Planning Board, BZA, and Cambridge Historical Commission. This is also where many of these real estate
and developer issues come up.
The other option is for Councillors who have taken funding from Real Estate interests to recuse themselves from any
decisions or advocacy about real estate projects or from contacting any judiciary boards where these matters come up,
or from voting on individuals being proposed for the Planning Board, BZA or Cambridge Historical Commission.
I and other Neighborhood Group leaders spend hundreds of hours addressing developments that impact our areas of
Cambridge
in part because the City has yet to finalize a City Plan or to include specific design guidelines or any form of design
review for projects that lie outside the Planning Board, the BZA or the Historic Commission.
Along with many others I have called for getting developer money out of City Governance and have also pushed for FAR
MORE Transparency in decision making.
Cordially,
Suzanne Blier

Fwd: Questions for City Council Meeting 12/6/21 RE Policy Order 2021 #259 on
Economic Impact Studies

In regard to Policy Order 2021 # 259 to be introduced at City Council Meeting 12/6/21:KEY QUESTIONS RE
MONITORING OF 'QUICK-START' IMPLEMENTATION THIS WINTER:
I believe that the key question RE 'quick-build' is whether the new configuration from Dudley-Alewife is
working: thus, the paramount concerns as to the utility of the 'quick-build' plan on N. Mass. Ave. center
on whether it is mitigating both climate change (i.e, pollution) & safety hazards on this corridor. One key
problem in this regard is that no follow-up mechanism was put in place by the City Council to assess
whether the rather drastic reconfiguration on a major transportation conduit was achieving its stated
aims -- not to mention its overall impacts on the surrounding community. Thus, it is almost inconceivable
to me how this plan could have passed the City Council (11/17) -- & been implemented the very same week
(11/21) -- without putting in place some cohesive assessment plan to monitor how it is progressing through the
winter. Thus, how is it possible to ram 'quick-build' through with so little outreach (or inputs) from the
community so that residents -- as well as local merchants -- were unaware until this fall as to what was about to
imposed by city officials in this neighborhood? How could such a rushed, ill-informed community process
occur in this 'progressive' city -- which also happens to house two of the preeminent universities in the
world? Impossible it would seem!
OBSERVATIONS & EXCHANGES WITH LOCAL MERCHANTS:
To step back for a minute from the global to the local, on the first day (Friday the 19th) of the 'quick-build'
project's implementation, I walked the length of the newly-configured corridor at rush hour to pick up a
forgotten prescription in Porter SQ. As I walked, I observed a crush of cars (extending west of Season to Taste
just about all the way up to Porter SQ. On my way past the apparent gridlock, I stopped in the cleaners to
inquire about an order: there I asked the proprietor whether they had enough parking on site, only to be
told that it was insufficient now that all metered parking on Mass. Ave had been eliminated. As to a
manager standing outside a nearby salon, her response focused on worry both workers & older patrons
who usually drove to the store. As I continued up Mass. Ave there were few bikes going in either direction,
with the exception of 3 cyclists that I encountered all on the sidewalks on the inbound side. One younger
cyclist whizzed by me on the sidewalk (even though I am an older woman walking with a cane): angered by his
lack of consideration, I yelled back at his receding figure asking why he wasn't using the new bike lanes but
could not hear his response.
By the time I finally had left Porter SQ. & headed back to meet friends for dinner with my husband, the westbound traffic had eased some. But the real kicker of this whole experience is that I had really wanted to go to
the Mediterranean Grill & could not do so because our 'out-of-town' friends (in their 70s and coming in
from Medford) could no longer park in our neighborhood.. Thus, for the 1st time since we moved here
nearly 3 years ago, we drove out to Arlington Center, passing the cheery sign urging us to support local
businesses and on to our destination: a lively, inviting commercial center brimming with shops & activity. The
proprietor at the restaurant in which we ate told my husband his small, ethnic eatery would not survive without

4.9.a

Packet Pg. 216

4.9.a

As we left Arlington, I was actually angry at what I envisioned would happen on the little commercial strip by
our apartment: Season to Taste will probably survive (the proprietor was quick to grab some parking at the
nearby childcare center), as will the Greek Corner (with decades in this community). As to the Mediterranean
Grill -- its proprietor had the misfortune to open during the pandemic -- what will become of this Persian eatery,
or, the Ethiopian Restaurant & QingDao Garden? Indeed, a worker at this long-time Chinese eatery had the
perspicacity to remark (to my cyclist spouse) that the City Council doesn't really care about the local
businesses along this strip: as the city fathers are foreseeing that this small commercial strip will be
'urban renewed' away to build multi-story residential all along the corridor. As to what small businesses
will serve the new residents, I simply do not know.
Another observation occurred on Thanksgiving eve: as I ducked into the Mediterranean Grill to inquire how the
restaurant had actually been faring since the start of 'quick-build' at the end of the previous week: a manager
remarked to me that business had definitely declined == as even delivery services such as Grub Hub were
reluctant to pick up orders from their store given that there was no place to park. Thus, the allowance for
15-minute stops in front of stores from 10:00 am to 9:00 pm needs to be clarified by abundant signage along N.
Mass. Ave.
What also occurred to my husband is whether some sort of arrangement could be facilitated (perhaps by
city &/or community representatives) between eateries along the 'restaurant row' on N. Mass. Ave.? That
is, could city officials facilitate another such arrangement -- like the one Season to Taste has already forged
with the nearby child care center -- bo span the eateries including Mediterranean Grill, Joe Sent Me, The
Ethiopian Restaurant, & Qing Dao Garden-- to utilize parking spaces at the dinner hour at Dunkin' Donuts:
which conveniently closes at 7:00? As an alternative, is there any possibility of the Trolley Yard providing
some spaces -- as their lot seems substantially underutilized (again particularly at night)?
However, if nothing is done to provide some relief to small local businesses, will they fade away one by
one: so that this N. Cambridge corridor will indeed end up largely bereft of commercial vitality (but
perfumed by pollution emanating from single lanes of traffic)? Thus, are we residents of N. Mass. Ave. to
be relegated once again to cheap, shoddy treatment-- in the 21st century delivered on the fly by 'quickbuild'? This outcome is passing strange in a city where even a small condo renovated to look spanking new
(though housed in a tottery-looking triple-decker at least a century old) -- even this housing option is listed for
some hundreds of thousands of dollars.
SUMMARY: Meanwhile here on N. Mass. Ave. (Dudley-Alewife), are city officials anticipating that
residents & local businesses are prepared to subsidize (through their taxes) a decision-making process &
allocation of city resources which have gone already badly awry in this forgotten corner of this bustling,
'world-class' city? Though decision-making in this city as well as resource allocation may be framed in
terms of climate change & cyclists' safety, what is being delivered in terms of policy implementation on
the ground level here on N. Mass. Ave is really quite something else entirely: an ill-informed, shortsighted, & just plain cheap set of deliverables with no recourse for evaluation & reconsideration in the
case of unforeseen consequences.
That is, if Policy Order 2021 #259 calling for economic impact studies of the installation of bike lanes on
Cambridge streets is only to apply to future efforts (as the wording states), what are the implications for
the residents & local businesses along Dudley-Alewife on N. Mass. Ave.? That is, will an ongoing
evaluation of the impacts here of 'quick-build' also be implemented if indeed this policy order is passed
by the City Council on 12/6/21?
Thank you for your consideration of this statement & the questions I have raised.

Cambridge Bicycle Safety
Comments for 2021 policy orders 259 and 261

Honorable city councillors and senior city administrators,
Regarding policy order #261 I would go further than just condemning this type of action. The Cambridge Police
Department should be informed so that they are aware of the issue. It is surely illegal to place tacks and bricks in the
road, especially if there is malicious intent. This is not simply a reckless action, but a spiteful one. If the perpetrator(s)
are caught the police should arrest them.
Regarding policy order #259: The city has made and continues to make many infrastructure improvements that could
and hopefully do have an impact on many things including public safety, including the safety of pedestrians, cyclists,
vehicle drivers, and others. Some of those changes might also impact economic activity in the city or at specific
businesses in the city. In my experience, the city staff who plan infrastructure changes take all these issues and more
into account when proposing and implementing them. They are aware of experiences in other cities around the world.
They have studied these issues, they are professionals, they read the literature and they talk with their peers in other
cities. They weigh the pros and cons and carefully consider the impacts of any changes they are proposing. To suggest
otherwise is to imply that they aren't doing their job, or that they aren't doing it well. In my experience attending public
meetings and discussing proposed changes with them, I have been impressed with their knowledge and experience and
we are fortunate to have them working for us.
This policy order implies that economic impact was not considered. It implies that the economic impacts of any changes
might be more important than other factors that were considered. If economic impact were the only factor important in
any changes then we would hire economists to plan our infrastructure and not urban planners and engineers.
In addition, there are many things which affect economic activity that have nothing to do with infrastructure. For
example, the recent pandemic has caused many local businesses to shut down. Restaurants and bars and just about any
in-person service business has suffered. As the situation improves I hope that these businesses see a return to "normal"
economic activity. But if the city is going to gauge the impact of infrastructure changes on economic activity, how will it
tease that single factor out of all of the other ones on economic activity? From seasonal changes to lifestyle changes to
the impacts of tourism and the presence or absence of out of town students attending schools in Cambridge, there are
many factors to be considered.
So if the council is going to ask the city to consider conducting any study at all, rather than this relatively narrow policy
order, the council could amend it to broaden the study to include not just economic impact but also the impact on the
quality of life of the residents and visitors to Cambridge including the impacts on public safety.
Respectfully,
Roy Russell
40 Cottage Street
PS - I think the Mass Ave changes are a great improvement, keep up the good work!

Approve Policy Order #1 and #3

Dear Mayor, City Council and City Manager,.
I’d like to thank Councillors Toomey and Simmons for Policy Order #1 (Policy Order #259) and I urge
the City Council to approve.
Small businesses and restaurants are an important economic engine in Cambridge and an important
feature of vibrant neighborhoods. Understanding the economic implications of separated bikes lanes
(with the removal of all/majority of parking) should not be an afterthought if the City Council truly
supports small businesses and restaurants. Another important consideration before implementation is
the loss of residential and handicap parking as one of the solution sets seems to be converting
residential spaces to metered spaces impacting neighborhoods.
I also write in support Policy Order #3 (Policy Order #261). It is very unfortunate a cyclist was injured
by placement of items in the bike lane that made it unsafe. This is inexcusable behavior and rightly
should be condemned.
We should also not tolerate personal attacks for expressing concern about bike lane impacts. Just
because one is expressing concern does not mean persons are against cycling safety. The
divisiveness around this issue is unfortunate and I believe comes out of the siloed process which did
not engage businesses and residents as the Cycling Safety Ordinance was developed. I hope the
City Council considers what actions might restore civility so people can speak constructively about
this topic.

To The Council:
We are writing to strongly urge you to vote in favor of limiting campaign donations from anyone seeking to conduct or
currently conducting business with the City. This is not a radical idea but a common sense one. Federal government
contractors are not permitted to donate to Federal campaigns. The proposed ordinance only limits campaign
contributions from those seeking or doing business with the city; it does not completely prohibit them. So this is a
relative modest step but an important one. The attempt to claim such donations are not different than those of local
social and pollical group’s PACS makes little sense. Such groups are motivated by political ideology and policy concerns;
they do not stand to gain economically.

Update #3 - This Morning's Traffice Jams

At 8:10 AM I was walking to Davis SQ. Car traffic was backed up from Alewife to Cameron Ave in
BOTH Directions. When I returned at 8:40, traffic was backed up in Both directions from Cameron to
Alewife. Andreas, Joe, Louis, and the 7 City Councilors that voted for this Mess, you have created a
situation that is ripe for Road Rage. People are angry and that anger is not going away. Let this be
a warning, the longer you delay in fixing the Mess you created, the greater the chance someone will
be victimized by Road Rage. When that happens I will be happy to lend the victim any assistance
they need in their multi million dollar lawsuit against the City and each of you. Even if you can't be
sued, I would encourage them to do so just to cause you some professional pain and suffering.
As Phil Esterhouse used to say "Be careful out there".
Other things I noticed while walking. Going inbound, a woman beeping her car horn as she drove
with her young children in the back of the car through the traffic jam. The children were holding up
signs to call the City. A valuable lesson in civic responsibility. Right on to her!
During my walks I saw only 1 bus. It was heading outbound. There were approximately 4
passengers on it. That does not seem like a constructive use of a valuable asset to me.

Ave. and Walden street and feel that my neighborhood has reached its boiling point. Similar to other debates, the
conversation about North Mass Ave. has become an "us and them." The reality is that I do not own a car and bike
everywhere, but I also feel that Walden and other cross streets have not been adequately prepared to absorb the
additional trucks and traffic. In increasing bike safety on Mass Ave, we might have compromised it elsewhere. My bike
commute up Walden is filled with more honking and close passing now than prior to the bike lane installation. Before
we build protected lanes further, we need to ensure that turn signals and road infrastructure properly manages
increases in traffic flows onto streets like Walden and Rindge. CDD predicted increases in traffic volume; now, we
have to act on these realized predictions. We cannot protect bike safety in one place and compromise it elsewhere.
The traffic on Walden has increased noticeably as a result of the implementation of the protected lane further up Mass.
Ave, as cars and trucks (despite the no-turn sign for trucks) bail before the increases in traffic further up Mass Ave. What
were once three or four cars turning left onto Walden are now seven or eight, which seems impossible if you consider
the amount of time granted for turning by the light cycle (hint: it is impossible...cars are turning left when they aren't
supposed to). Even during non-peak hours, traffic backs up on Walden as cars and trucks wait for the turn lights onto
Mass Ave. Cars speeding has become a problem everywhere during the pandemic, and has become increasingly
problematic on Walden, especially due to visibility issues caused by the railroad bridge.
Walden Street residents have complained for years about the pedestrian safety at the corner of Mass Ave and Walden
Street. The left turn signal on Mass Ave. welcomes cars and trucks (despite signage forbidding trucks) to turn onto
Walden while pedestrians crossing Walden at Mass Ave. have the walk signal. On Friday, a woman sped across Mass Ave
while turning onto Walden and came within a foot of my leg. She then backed up traffic on Mass Ave. going the other
way as she gesticulated but waited for me. I do not blame cars in this case, as they have a flashing yellow light, and it is
very difficult to successfully cross Mass Ave. and anticipate who is about to cross the street you're trying to turn onto.
The turn signal should be red for vehicles turning onto Walden Street when pedestrians are allowed to cross, not
yellow, however. The problem is infrastructure.
We need to investigate and implement more traffic calming measures on streets absorbing the Mass Ave. traffic. CDD
predicted that streets like Walden would experience higher traffic volumes, and here we are. People are still going to
work; unfortunately, not everyone is or can be taking the bus. Please, let's refer back to CDD's report and make the
improvements needed to ensure we aren't compromising bike and pedestrian safety as the result of a bike and
pedestrian safety initiative.
Thank you for your consideration.
Best,

Bus Lanes and Bike Lanes on Mass Ave

Dear City Councilors and City Officials:
I strongly support bus lanes on Mass Ave as a way to promote public transportation and support the residents
and workers who use it. Bus lanes improve the ability of students, workers, and families to get about the city
year-round, regardless of age, income, or physical disability.
The new exclusive bike lanes in North Cambridge, which are a stone's throw from and parallel to an exclusive
bike path that runs from Arlington to Somerville, do not bring such benefits. They have pushed traffic onto
residential streets and made it difficult to access businesses on Mass Ave, which in itself is troublesome, but
the fact that they were rushed into place in near-secrecy at the expense of long-time local residents to benefit a
very small slice of largely white, generally affluent people without physical disabilities is even more
problematic. The number of bike lane users, which is negligible compared to those who travel the area by car
and bus, will soon drop to almost zero as snow, ice, and freezing temperatures arrive, but the consequences
for the rest of us will remain.
I am therefore requesting that you vote to support Policy Order POR 2021 #259, requiring a study to collect
relevant economic data relating to business impacts from the bike lane installations, and creating a standard
public process prior to implementing new sections of bike lanes, and a general evaluation process to take
place post-installation.
If you opt not to vote in support of this study, please explain why you feel the situation on Mass Ave is ideal
and could not possibly be improved, or why the benefit of exclusive bike lanes that are so close to an off-street
bike path and which benefit already-privileged residents of neighboring towns is worth the current traffic
congestion, residential disruption, and business losses.
Sincerely,
Charles Harrington

Please vote to support Policy Order POR 2021 #259 requiring a study to collect relevant economic data
relating to business impacts from the bike lane installations and creating a standard public process prior to
implementing new sections of bike lanes, and a general evaluation process to take place postinstallation. Evaluation is needed prior to the implementations of separated bike lanes to address business
concerns and develop needed mitigation strategies.
The Bike paths were intended to be installed to make things safer for bicyclist, but what they have achieved is
to cause economic hardship to businesses and dangerous conditions for cars, pedestrians, bicyclists, and
busses. The most recent installation of the bike lane from Alewife Brook Parkway to Dudley St is particularly
dangerous. The intersections have become more dangerous as cars have to cross both Bus lanes and Bike
paths, drivers are confused by the merging lanes and lack of signage, and the ability to use the South bound
bus lane as a loading zone is not being used as that option is not clearly marked.
The existing bike lanes need to be evaluated to make sure they are working. The Evaluation process must have
goals and target points set, to be used on new and existing protected bike lanes constructed as Cambridge as a
whole. A structured evaluation process is needed to determine if the design is working to achieve its stated
goals and if it needs to be adjusted. Results should be made public and available no later than 3 months after
the protected lane construction or March 1, 2022, for sections already completed. Comparisons of before and
after construction should include:

•

•
•

The number of Accidents and severity of accidents involving bicycles
Is it increasing Bicycle ridership
Business effect revenue and closure rate
Residents' ability to park, and traffic concerns
Effect on Commuters of all major modes of Transportation- Car, Bike, MBTA

Support Policy Order 259: For a business impact report, an implementation process and
an evaluation of the protected bike lanes

Cambridge City Clerk, City Manager and City Council Members:
I am writing to support the Policy Order 259, requesting a study showing the impact to business from the
protected bike lanes, and the creation of a standard public process prior to them being built and an evaluation
process after they are completed.
The Cycling Safety Ordinance required That “by no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to
the City Council a block-by-block analysis determining the impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on Massachusetts Avenue” in the
section known as the Mass Ave 4.
One was submitted, but it should not have been accepted, because it was incomplete. It did not include
economic impact to businesses, and the impact to the surrounding residential neighborhoods and the impact
to people who rely on the many services located on Mass Ave that they would no longer be able to access. If
this information as required by the ordinance, looking at Mass Ave just south of Dudley, had been available
action could have been taken to remedy problems before they were created in the already completed Quick
Build sections of Dudley Street and Mid Mass Ave.
The City Council now finds itself having to request this information and asking for a study to collect relevant
economic data relating to business impacts from bike lane installations. This information was required to
already be in your hands as of last April. The ordinance needs to be amended and adjusted since this
requirement was not met.
The Department of Traffic was solely charged with completing the analysis but redesigning all of Mass Ave also
impacts Residents in adjacent neighborhoods, businesses, delivery services, city revenue, property values and
more. The commissions for People with disabilities, and the Elderly needed to be involved. The MBTA is a
huge piece of the design puzzle that is still unknown with talk of limiting bus service on this section of Mass
Ave, and the transition to diesel busses. It affects business owners with mortgages and payroll demands. If
businesses fail unemployment and social services will also be affected. The city is an interconnected web, and
an ordinance that redesigns Cambridge’s main thoroughfare without data and statistics in place should not
have been passed. A redesign needs Planning based on facts and not just a pledge to a well-organized Political
Group focused on the 7% of Cambridge that commutes by bike, as reported by the latest Cambridge census.
The Ordinance should include an Evaluation process with goals and target points to be used on all protected
bike lanes as proposed by this order being voted on at Monday’s City Council Meeting. It should Evaluate the
protected lanes effect on bicycle ridership and accidents, Business revenue and closure rate, Residents
concerns, and traffic. Save Mass Ave is submitting a petition with over 370 names supporting these
protections get added to the Ordinance.

The petition also asks for a City-Wide Project Manager working with a group of Stakeholders to be in Charge of
the construction of all the protected bicycle lanes with the authority to reach out to the needed city
departments, so problems and concerns have a place to be addressed. A redesign cannot just focus on
separate sections of Mass Ave without an overview that makes sure the city is able to function as a
whole. The complete stretch of Alewife Brook Parkway to Everett Street should have been looked at as one
piece, on the same timeline allowing for construction and continuity.
Emotions have run very high on this issue, I support the order to condemn any actions that result in the
physical injury of any individual, regardless of their support or non-support, of the bike/bus lane
implementation. I do not know anything about the incident referred to in the order, but I have seen people
being harassed and intimidated for voicing their opinions. I have seen bogus reviews posted on Yelp and other
sites to destroy a businesses’ ratings and reputation. The City Council should also condemn these acts as well.
This process needs to be fixed. You cannot destroy people’s livelihoods, and neighborhoods. You cannot allow
Special Interest Groups with a large National and International coalition and agenda dictate Cambridge Policy
by exacting a political Pledge. The impact statement is already required by the Ordinance, for the section just
below Dudley, and it was not done. It needs to be completed, and the timeline adjusted before more action on
the Bicycle Safety Ordinance is taken.

Agenda Item #1 for Dec. 6 meeting

Dear Sir Madam,
Since I will not be able to speak in person at the Dec 6 meeting, I am writing this email in lieu of my 3 min speaking
allotment.
Please note that I am fully supporting Mr. Carlone's proposal to limit campaign donations coming from commercial
interests wanting to do business with the city. Let’s make sure our democracy doesn’t get corrupted by money and
special interest as it is in many other countries. Money has and will continue to corrupt elected officials and it must stop!
Here are a few examples of how money from special interest groups , namely developers, has affected our neighborhood:
• Despite a ten-month sustained effort to stop high rises from blocking our skyline, increasing traffic, and imposing
ten years of construction noise on us, council members beholden to the developer voted to spoil our awardwinning East Cambridge Riverfront Plan.
• When it was shown that the CambridgeSide mall didn't really need all that height to survive because rent
differential for offices/labs was at least four times (possibly 6-8 times) the rent for retail, Planning Board and City
Council still voted in favor of the developer's proposal.
• Other governments in the U.S. have supported campaign finance reform: the federal government, New Jersey,
the city of Somerville.
• More and more, big money and misinformation are corrupting the will of the people in the U.S. and even in
Cambridge.
• Developers are interested in one thing: profit. Often they have to be forced to include space for public facilities
such as fire stations, city streets going through their large tracts of land, and open green spaces for the human
beings who live there.
• Big money construction often has to be forced to observe noise regulations.
• Developers in effect "bribe" the city with what they call "mitigations," such as a $9 million donation to East End
House. And, in effect, the City "extorts" or coerces the developers to build more affordable housing and donate
more money. While these "mitigations" have a plus side, neighbors of the development pay the price when
"Cambridge is for sale."
This is OUR CITY, and it is not for sale!
Regards,
Christian Klacko

Please vote to support Policy Order POR 2021 #259 requiring a study to collect relevant economic data relating to
business impacts from the bike lane installations and creating a standard public process prior to implementing new
sections of bike lanes, and a general evaluation process to take place post-installation. Evaluation is needed prior to the
implementations of separated bike lanes to address business concerns and develop needed mitigation strategies

This is a huge project that affects everyone: residents, businesses, commuters of all modes of transportation;
Bicycles, cars and MBTA. As the plans unfold there are additional concerns being raised about the design of
the protected Lanes and their effect on Truck deliveries, traffic, business closures, handicapped access and
more. Data from this project must be collected and be made public and evaluated.
From accident reports that had been released concerning Mass Ave in the Dudley to Alewife project
area, from the last 3 1/2 years there have been only 10 accidents involving a bicycle, and they resulted in
minor injuries. Out of these ten, six of them were at intersections that the protected lanes on the straight
sections that are restricting curb use wouldn’t have helped. Maybe the accident rate was so low because
there is a completely off-road bike path that already exists for this part of Mass Ave.
Council Member Zondervan's just released a month’s worth of Bicycle accident information to Cambridge Day:
None of the reported accidents happened on Mass Ave. The 6 Accidents are all at intersections and two of the
locations had protected bike lanes already installed. 5 of the injuries were minor, and the 1 person, who was
riding in an area with the separated lanes already installed received the most severe injury of the group and
was taken to the hospital w/ injuries to his leg. At the Nov 15 Council Meeting, time was spent reviewing two
recent crashes that took places at the intersection of Cambridge Street at Felton Street which has the
protected bike lane already installed.
Goals and targets that show the effect these protected Bicycle lanes have on businesses, residents and
commuters need to be evaluated before more protected lanes are designed and built. Data from before and
after the Protected bicycle lane were installed should be available and made public.

We are not asking for an end to the bike lanes, just a solution that will work for everyone. Data will show if
they are protecting cyclists, and the impact Protected Bicycle lanes in Cambridge have on the economy,
businesses, truck deliveries, the elderly, and disabled, and resident families. This data can be used to ensure
that these lanes are meeting their goals and not just creating a speedy and direct path from Arlington to
Boston at the expense of Cambridge Businesses and residents. Cambridge Bike Safety keeps saying that the
lanes do not hurt business, or divert traffic into residential neighborhoods, let's look at the data from
Cambridge and find the facts.
SaveMassAve.com submitted a petition with 800 signatures asking for input and a community meeting. Our
current petition is over 370 signatures to date.
Full text of the petition is below and attached with signatures.
The Petition states:
We the undersigned request that the City of Cambridge:
*Appoint a City-Wide Project Manager in Charge of the construction of protected bicycle lanes throughout
Cambridge with the authority to reach out to the needed city departments to address concerns. The City-Wide
Project Manager should work along with a group of Stakeholders that is specifically charged with oversight of
how all these segments of protected bike lanes affect the City as a whole.
*Require an Evaluation process with goals and target points set, to be used on new and existing protected bike
lanes constructed as Cambridge as a whole. A structured evaluation process is needed to determine if the
design is working to achieve its stated goals and if it needs to be adjusted. Results should be made public and
available no later than 3 months after the protected lane construction or March 1, 2022 for sections already
completed. Comparisons of before and after construction should include:
• The number of Accidents and severity of accidents involving bicycles
• Is it increasing Bicycle ridership
• Business effect revenue and closure rate
• Residents ability to park, and traffic concerns
• Effect on Commuters of all major modes of Transportation- Car, Bike, MBTA
*Adoption of Shared Parking programs that would allow temporary on-street parking on residential streets
during daytime hours is needed to compensate for the removal of Parking spaces on Mass Ave.
No pavement work can be done over the winter let’s use this time to gather the data and the facts, address
real concerns, and evaluate the choices being made.
Thank you,

Bikes on Mass Ave

Dear City Council and Manager,
I am lucky enough to live less than a mile from Mass Ave in North Cambridge, so I almost never drive my car there. On a
personal basis, I’d like nothing more than a Kennedy Greenway in that space. But it is completely irrational and
unethical to tear parking away from shop owners whose existing businesses and livelihoods depend on the nearby street
parking that they banked on when they invested and opened their shops. Further, those shops and restaurants are the
lifeblood of the neighborhood. Without them, North Cambridge would be essentially a dense suburb.
We’ve heard lots of talk about carless society, many people not being able to afford cars, meters on side streets, etc.
But none of these things are true solutions today. Our entire society is too dependent on the auto, but we need to
approach this thoughtfully, without destroying people’s businesses, neighborhoods, etc. We cannot change this
overnight. The current dogmatic approach, like most dogmatic approaches, needs to move from thoughtless political
grandstanding to practical ways to improve cycling without crushing those who still depend on automobiles.

Re: Petition From Business Owners and Neighbors re Implemented Bike Safety Measures
on Northern Mass Ave

Subject:

Dear Councilors Simmons and Toomey,
Mr. Toner and Mr. Williamson were kind enough to alert me to Policy Order 2021 #259 you introduced for Monday's
City Council Meeting. This is exactly what I have asked for in the email I sent to the Council on Nov.22 and I can't thank
you enough for introducing this order.
I have distributed a petition to the business owners who cosigned my letter and they have been collecting signatures
from their customers, staff and friends asking for City's help. I will collect them over the weekend and submit them with
my letter to be included in the agenda packet.
I talked to Mr. Wolfe yesterday and he explained that the “Engineering House Doctor for Services Related to
Separated Bicycle Lanes” contract is an "on-call" type of contract. I will have to dig a little deeper on the
history of the contract but this is a sole source contract as I suspected and is at the heart of the Cycling
Ordinance implementation woes. Had the bid for the Upper Mass Ave Bike Safety Measure implementation
been an open and competitive one requiring analysis of financial and traffic impact to the community, we would
not have this much of concern among the small business community.
Thank you again on behalf of myself and those who co-signed my letter for introducing the policy order.
Have a great weekend,
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim

Dear Mayor, City Councilors, City Manager and City Clerk,
I, together with the undersigned business owners and neighbors (cc'ed on this email), urgently request that
City of Cambridge:
1.
immediately pause any further work on implementing the Cycling Safety Ordinance throughout
Cambridge except to install traffic signs and the promised parking meters on side streets off of Mass
Ave from Dudley Street to Alewife Parkway (Northern Mass Ave);

2.
assess economic damages already done to the local businesses and implement mitigation
measures;
3.
require the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department (TP&T) answer the questions I raised
below and set up a Cycling Ordinance implementation process in order not to repeat the same
mistakes they have made with Northern Mass Ave project.
Through the documents I obtained from a public record request (PRR), I was shocked by the process, or
rather the lack of one, by which TP&T implemented the bicycle safety measures on Northern Mass Ave.
without much community outreach at the beginning of a very busy holiday season. The business owners
were counting on this holiday season with loosened COVID restrictions to recoup some of the losses incurred
during the pandemic and to get back on their feet. How are the out-of-town visitors supposed to deal with
these sudden changes when even the local residents are struggling to understand and adjust to?
Director Barr of TP&T explained the lack of robust community outreach as “we are much more constrained
due to the quick-build approach, and did not have the same degree of flexibility/opportunity for design
changes (nb: as the Mass Ave south of Dudley Street). As a result, our outreach for the outer segment was
much more focused on the specifics of the design and the limited set of decisions that we could seek.”
I made a PRR for proposal and signed contract for the Northern Mass Ave Project assuming the Plan was
developed by TP&T. What I got instead was the signed contract and two amendments for the “Engineering
House Doctor for Services Related to Separated Bicycle Lanes.” The scope of work for the original contract
was for Mass Ave from Beech Street to Roseland Street and Mt. Auburn Street from JFK Street to Putnam
Ave. The first amendment added the Northern Mass Ave with no changes to the original two locations and
Mass Ave from Trowbridge Street to Inman Street (nb: response to the PRR did not include amendment to
add this location).
The proposal from Kleinfelder and Toole Design (Contractor) dated March 22, 2019 stated that they are
submitting the proposal in response to “the RFP received on March 13, 2019.” The proposal was accepted
as is and the contract was signed on 4/4/2019.
The above should raise many alarming questions.
1.
How could Cambridge award a contract even before the Ordinance was passed by the City
Council on 4/8/2019.
2.
Why wasn't the request for proposal included in the PRR response?
3.
The terms of the contract stipulates that the “Contractor agrees to provide the services all in
accordance with the submitted proposal … and the agreement for Designer Services between the City
of Cambridge and Kleinfelder dated March 30, 2016.” Is the City locked into services from this
Contractor for all of the remaining Ordinance implementations as the sole source, no-bid contracts?
4.
Why isn’t any of the deliverables for the Northern Mass Ave project on the TP&T’s website for
the project? Where are the transparency and accountability in that?
5.
Proposal states “The design work will consider impact to transit and parking and recommend
improvements to mitigate bus-bike conflicts and vehicular conflicts.” Why didn’t TP&T consider impact
to the local businesses and residents or require the contractor to do so? Is the “quick-build approach”
more important than devastating economic impact?
6.
Proposal states “It is assumed that the transit efforts is (sic) minor…” Why didn’t TP&T consider
the traffic congestion due to this segment of Mass Ave being a commuter gateway?

Endorse the BluePrint for Peace

Dear Mr. Wilson,
We face staggering levels of violence in America and around the globe. The personal, social and economic costs to
individuals, families, and our communities can be overwhelming, and yet we have far more effective root cause
solutions available than we are currently employing. We must implement policies and invest in programs, both
domestically and internationally, that are proven to work, and bring them up to the scale needed to turn this
devastation around.
As a constituent, I am urging you to endorse and sign-on to this broad framework of the ” BluePrint for Peace” in
support of positive solutions to all types of violence.
These proven effective solutions should be robustly implemented at local, state, federal and international levels,
lowering the financial and emotional cost to our country and world while building social resilience. They include:
Humanize Justice Systems: Move away from overly punitive policies toward healing-oriented, rehabilitative-focused
criminal and juvenile justice approaches that address underlying root causes.
Empower Community Interventions: Comprehensive activities and strategies working to address such challenges as nonviolent crime, domestic violence, gang violence, etc. as well as healing trauma and other broad prevention-focused
supports, particularly for marginalized communities.
Practicing Peace in Schools: Conflict resolution curricula in our schools, using neuro-regulatory strategies and tools such
as social-emotional learning, empathetic and nonviolent communication techniques, restorative processes, mindfulness,
and other proven peacebuilding skills/modalities to increase graduation rates and transform violence, bullying, truancy,
and other challenges facing youth.
Enhance Personal and Interpersonal Supports: Robust resources addressing mental health, trauma, PTSD, suicide
prevention, domestic violence, workplace violence, life skills, parenting skills, and related areas.
Foster International Peace: Peacebuilding approaches to international conflict and atrocity prevention in global hotspots
through mediation, diplomacy, and effective on-the-ground programs. Led on the ground by diverse and representative
local stakeholders.
I'm requesting you sign on as an endorser at this url: www.peacealliance.org/blueprint-elected

Economic studies are often cited from other cities about the impact of bike lanes to

The City will be implementing bike lanes along business corridors each year until 2026

WHEREAS:

In November of 2020, the Cambridge City Council voted unanimously to oppose the
MBTA’s plans to replace existing zero-emissions electric bus routes with diesel buses
in Cambridge, as well as asking the MBTA to prioritize Environmental Justice
communities by moving towards 100% zero emissions buses like in Seattle and
Vancouver; and

WHEREAS:

Despite this strong signal from the City Council, the MBTA is still moving forward
with their original plan to introduce new diesel infrastructure at the North Cambridge
facility to support heaters for the new buses at a cost of $21M, which will neither
further equity nor reduce emissions; and

WHEREAS:

The MBTA has only held one public meeting at which they confirmed the use of
diesel, but provided no additional information on progress toward electrification
targets, nor were any target dates made clear; and

WHEREAS:

By proceeding with this plan, the MBTA would be contributing to poor air quality in
the surrounding neighborhood, consuming up to 30,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually,
and exposing the workers to harmful conditions; and

WHEREAS:

There has been no community process with the abutting neighbors about adding onsite
storage of up to 30K gallons of diesel fuel, which would be the equivalent of adding a
full service gas station on the parcel where no such storage exists now; and

WHEREAS:

To our knowledge, the MBTA has not investigated in-motion-charging (IMC)
technology, which could have the potential to electrify the routes without adding fossil
fuels into the energy solution for these buses; and

WHEREAS:

IMC buses have the potential to electrify other routes that use the Harvard Bus Tunnel,
including the 77 and the 96; and

WHEREAS:

Electric buses are seen as critical to meeting aggressive climate goals by reducing
fossil fuels, and other City partners like Harvard University have partnered in
achieving zero emissions by replacing four bio-diesel buses with 100% electric buses
this fall, and the MBTA’s decision will not help achieve these goals; now therefore be
it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in restating its opposition to the MBTA’s plans to
introduce new diesel infrastructure at the North Cambridge Garage and buses with
diesel heaters; and be it further

prioritize environmental justice communities such as Chelsea and Dorchester for
electrification efforts that would improve service and reduce emissions; and be it

The recent implementation of dedicated bike and bus lanes on northern Massachusetts
Avenue have elicited many strong feelings, both for and against; and

WHEREAS:

These strong feelings have divided the community, resulting in contentious rhetoric;
and

WHEREAS:

The City Council has become aware that on the morning of November 18, 2021, a
cyclist crashed due to tacks and bricks being placed in the bike lane at Massachusetts
Avenue and Cameron Avenue, resulting in damage to his bicycle; and

WHEREAS:

Thankfully, the cyclist was not seriously injured, but could have been, including
possibly falling into traffic; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the Cambridge City Council condemns, in the strongest possible terms, any
actions that may result in the physical injury of any individual, regardless of their
support or non-support, of the bike/bus lane implementation, and we encourage all
individuals to continue to debate this project through the community and political
arena and not engage in any actions that could lead to devastating consequences and
we call on those on both sides of this issue to publicly condemn such actions.

With the Covid-19 pandemic nearing the two year mark, it has become evident that this
virus shall continue to impact nearly all facets of our community for some time to
come, and that easy, regular, and reliable ways of having individuals tested for the
virus will continue to be a critical component in the efforts to control the illness’s
spread; and

WHEREAS:

The City has gone to considerable efforts to establish free Covid-19 testing locations
throughout the community, yet there are those – primarily seniors and those with
significant mobility impediments – that continue to face significant hurdles to leaving
their homes and venturing out to be tested; and

WHEREAS:

While there are some services operated by the MBTA and Somerville Cambridge Elder
Services, among others, designed to transport our more vulnerable residents to and
from Covid-19 testing locations, there remain gaps in the services and instances where
individuals simply cannot make it to the City’s testing locations; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge should have all the necessary resources to find ways to plug
these gaps, and to ensure that those individuals who face significant barriers to leaving
their homes can instead be tested within their homes; now therefore be it

home testing to be conducted for seniors and those with significant mobility

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday November 30, the School Committee’s School Climate Subcommittee met to
discuss the results of the Spring 2021 Teen Health Survey. You can find the presentation here.
It was reported that overall, mental health worsened during the pandemic, except for a decrease
in reported self-harm. Additionally, there was a decline in meaningful connections with adults.
Fewer students reported having a teacher/adult to talk to in 2021 compared to previous survey
years. There was also a decline in reported substance use across all commonly used drugs
(alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, and electronic vapor products) but safety concerns were highest
among students who identified as female, genderqueer, African American/Black, Asian, and
Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the percent of students engaging in physical activity declined compared
to prior years. About 3,000 students took part across the middle and upper schools, or about 55
percent of high school students and about 75 percent of upper school students.
There is no doubt additional support for students is needed and Cambridge Public Schools has
responded in several ways:
• Referrals to School Student Support Teams and/or outside providers
• Specialized programming
Looking ahead the district will be:
• Hiring SEL Director
• Review of professional learning
• Promoting supports available through Teen Health Center to students and families
• Supporting School Committee policy reviews
• CPHD / CPS campaign around mental health
The School Committee will be reviewing and updating our:
• Wellness Policy
• Student athlete waiver of course requirements
• Teen Health Center Policy
• Anti-bullying policy and anti-cyberbullying policy

Packet Pg. 307

7.2

Prior to the meeting, there was a walk out of over 400 CRLS students protesting a culture of
sexual assaults and harassment. I am supportive of our students' voices and the district is going to
respond with a comprehensive action plan to address the concerns that continue to arise so that
we can center student voices and support them. Superintendent Greer released the following
statement regarding the action the district is taking following this walk out: “First, staff have
been following up with individual students to provide support and take appropriate next steps.
Second, we are working on a comprehensive plan for more immediate actions that include
school, district, city community and stakeholders. Third, we will be implementing a
comprehensive, internal investigation led by a third-party into the ongoing allegations and
concerns at the high school. We will continue to provide updates on our efforts.”
The School Committee’s next regular meeting will be held on December 7 at 6pm.
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns
Respectfully,

Mayor Siddiqui

Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday November 30, the School Committee’s School Climate Subcommittee met to
discuss the results of the Spring 2021 Teen Health Survey. You can find the presentation here.
It was reported that overall, mental health worsened during the pandemic, except for a decrease
in reported self-harm. Additionally, there was a decline in meaningful connections with adults.
Fewer students reported having a teacher/adult to talk to in 2021 compared to previous survey
years. There was also a decline in reported substance use across all commonly used drugs
(alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, and electronic vapor products) but safety concerns were highest
among students who identified as female, genderqueer, African American/Black, Asian, and
Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the percent of students engaging in physical activity declined compared
to prior years. About 3,000 students took part across the middle and upper schools, or about 55
percent of high school students and about 75 percent of upper school students.
There is no doubt additional support for students is needed and Cambridge Public Schools has
responded in several ways:
• Referrals to School Student Support Teams and/or outside providers
• Specialized programming
Looking ahead the district will be:
• Hiring SEL Director
• Review of professional learning
• Promoting supports available through Teen Health Center to students and families
• Supporting School Committee policy reviews
• CPHD / CPS campaign around mental health
The School Committee will be reviewing and updating our:
• Wellness Policy
• Student athlete waiver of course requirements
• Teen Health Center Policy
• Anti-bullying policy and anti-cyberbullying policy
Prior to the meeting, there was a walk out of over 400 CRLS students protesting a culture of
sexual assaults and harassment. I am supportive of our students' voices and the district is going to

respond with a comprehensive action plan to address the concerns that continue to arise so that
we can center student voices and support them. Superintendent Greer released the following
statement regarding the action the district is taking following this walk out: “First, staff have
been following up with individual students to provide support and take appropriate next steps.
Second, we are working on a comprehensive plan for more immediate actions that include
school, district, city community and stakeholders. Third, we will be implementing a
comprehensive, internal investigation led by a third-party into the ongoing allegations and
concerns at the high school. We will continue to provide updates on our efforts.”
The School Committee’s next regular meeting will be held on December 7 at 6pm.
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns
Respectfully,

Mayor Siddiqui
