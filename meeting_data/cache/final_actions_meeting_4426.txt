1.1.a

To The Honorable, the City Council:
The establishment of the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) property tax rate by the Board of Assessors,
subject to the approval of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, is the final step in the fiscal
process that begins with the submission of the annual budget to the City Council. The City’s
Operating and Capital Budgets, property classifications, and property valuations are major
factors in determining property tax bills.
This memo includes recommendations for the required votes which will help minimize taxes on
residential properties. In addition, there are analyses of the FY24 property tax levy, property
values, and other supporting information.
OVERVIEW
The FY24 Adopted Operating Budget is $883.8 million which is an increase of 10% (or $82.3
million) over the FY23 Adopted Budget. It should be noted that a significant portion ($24.6
million) of that increase represents a shift of funding for the Affordable Housing Trust from the
Capital Budget to the Operating Budget. This does not impact the overall levy, however it is a
more appropriate accounting of how funds are allocated towards affordable housing. Excluding
the shift of affordable housing funds, the FY24 Operating Budget represents an increase of $57.8
million or 7.2% over the FY23 Adopted Budget. While this is still a significant increase, the Budget
responds to Council goals, feedback, and input, which is reflected in funding commitments across
several key priority areas.
The FY24 Budget adopted by the City Council in June 2023 projected a property tax levy increase
of $48.8 million, or 9.2%, to $580.3 million in order to fund operating and capital expenditures.
With approval of the recommendations in this memo, the actual FY24 tax levy required to support
the FY24 Budget is $575,418,489 which is an increase of $43.9 million or 8.3% from FY23. This
increase is lower than the estimated increase of 9.2% projected in June 2023 as part of the Adopted
Budget, due in large part from higher than projected investment earnings, hotel motel taxes, and
building permit revenue.
The property tax levy increase of 8.3% is above the FY23 increase of 7.45%. The property tax levy
increase is also above the five-year (FY20-FY24) annual average increase of 7.03%, and the tenyear (FY15-FY24) annual average increase of 5.77%.
The Budget process for FY24 began in the fall of 2022. The FY24 Operating ($883.8M) and Capital
($185.2M) Budgets were formally adopted by the City Council on June 5, 2023, and include

1.1.a

significant investments in many programs and initiatives that are directly related to City Council
goals.

The FY24 Budget includes over $41 million in funding for affordable housing. As part of the FY24
Budget and consistent with previous years, the City has committed to using building permit
revenue ($10.2 million) to support affordable housing. In addition, $14.1 million of General Fund
revenue and $300,000 in short-term rental impact fees will be used to provide funding to the
Affordable Housing Trust. This totals $24.6 million in the FY24 Budget to directly support the
development and preservation of affordable housing. These funds will be supplemented by FY24
Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds ($16.5 million).
The City has also committed significant funding to supporting the unhoused community with a
total of $15.9 million in FY24 primarily driven by investments in maintaining the City’s shelter
capacity as well as programs that support those who are not stably housed in our community
including programs on eviction prevention, rental assistance, legal services, the winter Warming
Center, and transportation for homeless children.
The City has continued to make major investments in universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) as we
prepare to go-live in the fall of 2024. Total funding is $34.4 million in FY24. There was a Free Cash
allocation in FY23 of $10 million toward a stabilization fund which will help mitigate the budget
impact in FY25 of implementing UPK, which is projected to be approximately $20 million. There
was also $1.2 million of new full-time positions added to the Office of Early Childhood (formerly
Birth to Third Grade Partnership) to support program roll-out and operations and $5.1 million of
capital investment in Just-A-Start’s Rindge Commons project to build new pre-kindergarten
classrooms. The City increased property tax support for the School Department by 6.1% or $12.6
million.
The City is making substantial investments towards our Climate Net Zero goal. The City
recognizes that to accelerate our transition to carbon free, we will need to invest in technical
assistance to assess and plan transitions across hundreds of buildings, which is reflected in the
FY24 budget. The City has allocated $18 million in FY24 toward reducing building emissions,
vehicle electrification, and investments in renewable energy with significant City ordinances and
programs rolling out this year.
Within Climate Resilience, there is funding of $47 million in FY24 which will support major sewer
and stormwater projects and investments in roofs and drainage to ensure the city will be prepared
for greater extreme weather events. There is also funding included for open space ($13.2 million),
zero waste goals ($7.6 million), and urban forestry ($4.1 million).
Making streets safer is a key priority for the City and is reflected in investments in infrastructure
to repair damaged roads, improve accessibility, and address dangerous intersections.
Infrastructure investment includes $70.6 million in FY24, primarily driven by the Mass Ave
Partial Reconstruction project, which is being allocated $50 million in capital funding to be spent
over FY24 and the following years. This will be the largest infrastructure investment related to
the Cycling Safety Ordinance and was presented in the FY23 five-year capital plan.

Attachment: FY24 Tax Rate Letter 9_28_23_ FINAL (CMA 2023 #250 : FY24 Tax Rate)

The FY24 Budget is guided by policy direction set by the Council, based on City Council meetings,
policy orders, and consistent communication which has allowed for feedback on existing
initiatives and department operations, and helped to identify key city priorities.

1.1.a

The FY24 Budget includes 54 new full-time positions related to the ongoing expansion and
increasing demands of important city programs and initiatives, such as within human services,
library services, infrastructure, facilities, equity and inclusion, human resources, economic
opportunity, zoning, inspectional services, public and community safety, and housing.

Based on a revised property tax levy of $575,418,489 the FY24 residential tax rate will be $5.92 per
thousand dollars of value, subject to Department of Revenue approval. This is an increase of
$0.06, or approximately 1% from FY23. The commercial tax rate will be $10.46, which is an
increase of $0.08, or 0.7% from FY23. Establishing the tax rate is a straightforward calculation: the
total tax levy divided by the total assessed valuation (less any exemptions), equals the tax rate for
FY24.
FREE CASH
It is estimated that the FY23 (as of June 30, 2023) Free Cash certification will be between $180
million and $190 million (which includes approximately $4 million in unappropriated mitigation
receipts). It is estimated that the Certified Free Cash amount will be a decrease from the previous
year’s certification. The Department of Revenue (DOR) does not allow formal authorizations of
Free Cash by the City Council until the DOR has certified a Free Cash balance at the conclusion
of the fiscal year.
Even with an estimated decrease, the City’s Free Cash position demonstrates another benefit of
long-standing fiscal policies and management. It also provides critical flexibility to effectively
address key community needs while managing unplanned fiscal uncertainties.
In FY23, the City appropriated $87.7 million in Free Cash. Free Cash was used throughout FY23
to support important and sometimes unanticipated expenditures related to City programs and
initiatives including (but not limited to): $15.4 million for the purchase and fit out of Webster
Avenue properties; $10 million to create a Universal Pre K (UPK) Stabilization Fund; $18.8 million
as a revenue source for the FY24 Budget; $1.6 million for snow related expenses; $2.35 million to
purchase water from Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA); $1.8 million for
improvements to Dottie Doyle Way; $750,000 for preschool classrooms at 402 Rindge Avenue;
$600,000 for softball improvements at Danehy Park; $586,000 for Smart Box rodent control;
$555,000 for EGOV projects; $400,000 for an electric packer truck; $250,000 for emergency radio
system infrastructure; $200,000 for Central Square property needs assessment; $150,000 for a Mass
Ave planning study; and $78,000 for additional printing and mailing costs for the City Clerk's
office.
OTHER REVENUES, STATE AID, AND RESERVE FUNDS
The City was able to use certain additional non-property revenues than what was projected as
part of the FY24 Budget (Interest earnings $3,060,000; Hotel Motel Excise Tax $1,000,000; Building
Permits $1,000,000) to help minimize the impact of the levy increase on residential taxpayers.

General Fund revenue for the FY24 Capital Budget ($3,865,000) supports important investments
in Pay as you Go capital projects, E-Gov projects, and Participatory Budgeting.

1.1.a

The use of additional non-property tax revenues allows for an overall reduction of $4.8 million
from the original projected property tax levy for FY24.

This letter also includes a recommendation to use $2 million from the Overlay Surplus reserve to
lower the property tax levy. Careful budgeting and monitoring of revenues have allowed the City
to maintain stability in both current and future property tax increases while investing in
significant capital and infrastructure projects. This strategy of using an increased amount of
certain non-property tax revenues, and reserves, when applicable, to lower the property tax levy
allows the City to stabilize property taxes during economic downturns, or during extraordinary
events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when there are significant reductions in other key nonproperty tax revenues.
The City’s fiscal strategy and policies regarding budgeting and the use of reserves has also been
positively recognized by the three major credit rating agencies and is reflected in our AAA credit
rating.
IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS
It is important to recognize that a healthy balance of development between residential and
commercial be continued to ensure homeowner’s real estate taxes remain affordable. The City of
Cambridge has a long-standing commitment and strategy to provide an adequate level of
predictability and stability for tax bills.
Below is a comparison of the residential percent of the tax levy paid by Cambridge residents
compared to neighboring towns. Cambridge continues to have the lowest residential and
commercial tax rates compared to neighboring communities. Additionally, Cambridge residents
are paying the lowest proportion of the levy when compared to other nearby towns. The amount
of new growth for both last year and this year in the industrial class (labs) has allowed the city to
lower the residential minimum factor and shift a larger percentage of taxes onto the commercial
and industrial classes.

*Cambridge rates are for FY24, all others are for FY23
The strength of the residential market continued during calendar year 2022, for single, two and
three families in Cambridge. Similar to last year, the single-family class had the largest value
increase at 8.41% over last year. Limited supply, remote work policies and upward pressure on
rents caused significant value increases for these classes. Condominiums show a slight increase
in value (2.5%) but are not seeing the larger increases of other residential properties. It is also
important to point out that condominiums now compromise a very large percentage of the
residential tax bills.
MEDIAN TAX BILLS
The analysis that follows explains in further detail how the City determined property values and
property tax rates for FY24. There are three major factors which determine a property tax bill: 1)
the Budget, 2) Commercial-Residential Property Tax Classification, and 3) Property Values. As
discussed below, all three factors contributed to lower tax bills for many homeowners.
The Budget: If the City Council adopts the proposed recommendations, there will be a 8.3%
increase in the property tax levy required to balance the FY24 Budget.
Commercial-Residential Property Tax Classification: Tax classification allows municipalities to
tax commercial taxpayers at a higher rate than residential taxpayers. For this year, commercial
property owners will pay 66.199% of the property tax levy, a higher share than in FY23.
Consequently, residential property owners’ share of the FY24 tax levy is 33.8010%, which is a
lower share than the prior year.
Property Values: Each January 1st, the city of Cambridge must meet Department of Revenue
requirements to certify that property values represent full and fair market value. As a result of
the market activity in calendar year 2022, which is the basis of the FY24 property assessments,
total residential property values increased by 5.3%. Total commercial property values increased
by 8.2%. Similar to last year, the increase in total values reflects some classes that continue to rise
such as Class A office and lab as well as classes that are mainly flat or slightly decreasing like
retail, restaurant and office class b/b+. The impact of hybrid and remote work is still developing.
We are seeing more subleasing of office space, but we feel that Cambridge is well positioned to
weather future uncertainty due to its leadership position as a lab and research hub and the
presence of two world class research universities. While the City has no control over the increase
in property values, it does have control over levy increases, which ultimately impact taxes paid

CITY-WIDE ASSESSED VALUES
FY24 values are based on market activity that occurred during calendar year 2022. Most
residential classes saw an increase in values. The single families were most affected by a low
supply of inventory, while apartments saw a leveling off in rents. Class A Office and lab sectors
increased as well as the retail, restaurants and hotels with the effects of COVID-19 receding. A
major component which impacts commercial values are the construction of life science buildings
and the personal property associated with these developments.
For FY24, the total assessed value of taxable property in the City equals $75,883,594,799, or a 6.7%
increase, over prior year values. The actual FY24 total assessed values are greater than the
projections presented to the rating agencies in February 2023 due to continued strength and
resilience in the Cambridge real estate market.
The table below breaks out new construction values and tax base levy growth due to new
construction by property type. This new construction growth, and new lab space in particular,
has allowed the city to go below the Historical Lowest Residential tax percentage by using the
150% Shift and adopting the 65.0000% Minimum Residential Factor. This shift does not include
the limit on Historical Lowest Residential Tax Percentage, allowing the City to shift a larger
percentage of taxes onto the commercial and industrial tax classes. Additionally, this shift allows
Cambridge to go below the lowest historical residential percentage for all future years. Lowering
the Historical Lowest Residential Tax Percentage is advantageous to Cambridge homeowners by
lowering their taxes when many residential values are increasing.

Attachment: FY24 Tax Rate Letter 9_28_23_ FINAL (CMA 2023 #250 : FY24 Tax Rate)

by property owners. This year, both the residential and commercial property tax rates will
increase. The impact of the levy increase has been tempered due to the large amount of industrial
(lab) growth we have again this year. The new growth value for the industrial class is almost
$975,000,000 which allows the City to again lower the Minimum Residential Factor calculated by
the Department of Revenue. Changes to the median value by residential class and tax bills can be
seen in Table III below. Additionally, a major concern going forward is that if residential value
increases outpace commercial/industrial/personal property increases, the City could hit the
ceiling for the property tax classification shift. Once the classification ceiling is reached, the
residential class will bear the majority of any tax levy increase.

For FY24, the City was able to increase its levy limit by approximately $41.40 million, to $773.96
million. Approximately $23.1 million of this increase was due to new construction and amended
FY23 new growth. State law allows the City to increase its tax levy limit by an amount equal to
the total FY24 value of newly constructed or renovated property, multiplied by the FY23 tax rate.
It should be noted that industrial property (lab space) values had a new growth value of $974
million which translated into new levy growth of $10.1 million. The remaining $18.31 million is
the 2.5% increase over the FY23 levy allowed by Proposition 2½.

FY24 VALUATION PROCESS
Each year, the Board of Assessors conducts a reappraisal of all property within the City. The
residential and commercial valuation models are refined each year to reflect market conditions
which have impacted assessed values.
The FY24 valuation model is based upon sales of property that occurred during calendar year
2022, to establish the market value of all property as of January 1, 2023.
This year, modifications were made to the residential and condominium models, as well as to
residential land values. The residential land had adjustments for neighborhood and lot size, while
the residential model was recalibrated for use, grade, townhouse styles and condition
adjustments. The condominium model was adjusted by neighborhood, unit type, and amenities
for market conditions as of the assessment date. The analysis for determining property values
depends on several factors: the trends of the real estate market in the areas of sales; property
improvements; changes in the economics of real estate finance and the demand for real estate in
the city. To arrive at full and fair cash values for all parcels, the Assessing Department uses a
Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal system (CAMA). Market adjusted cost approach models,
extracted from residential sales for calendar year 2022, were refined to best reflect the equity of
comparable properties as demonstrated in the various neighborhoods.
COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT SURCHARGE
In November 2001, Cambridge voters approved adoption of the Community Preservation Act
(CPA), a State law that allows the City to receive matching funds from the State for money raised

locally in support of affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space. The local portion
of CPA funding is raised through a 3% surcharge on taxes.
However, the State match has enabled the City to provide additional funding for these initiatives.
To date, Cambridge has received more CPA matching funds from the Commonwealth than any
other participating community. Consequently, Cambridge residents will continue to benefit from
affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space initiatives throughout the City for years
to come.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. That the City Council vote to authorize $2,000,000 in overlay surplus/reserves to be used for
reducing the FY24 tax rate.

2. That the City Council classify property within the City of Cambridge into the five classes
allowed for the purpose of allocating the property tax. It is further recommended that the City
Council adopt a minimum residential factor of 65.0000%.

3. That the City Council approve the residential exemption factor of 30% for owner occupied
homes, which should result in a residential tax rate of $5.92 upon final approval by the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue. In addition, based upon final approval by the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue the commercial tax rate is anticipated to be $10.46.
The City Council has previously approved (1987) several tax exemptions to elderly taxpayers,
blind taxpayers, veterans and surviving spouses who qualify by virtue of residency, income, and
assets, including the doubling of the statutory amount of exemption for taxpayers whose tax bills
have increased over the prior year's bill; to increase the amount of the exemption for a senior
citizen 70 or older, surviving spouse, or minor with a deceased parent, by the increase in the costof-living as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI); to increase the income and assets limits
for elderly persons (age 65 or older) by the CPI percentage; and to increase the income limit for

ISSUES/ REQUIRED VOTES
As the City Council is aware, by the time the classification vote is taken in the fall of each year,
the options for the City are fairly limited. Failure to approve the recommended classification and
residential exemption would result in significantly higher taxes for residential property owners.
After the classification vote is taken, the establishment of the tax rate is a fairly simple
mathematical calculation: the tax levy required to support the City budget, divided by the total
assessed valuation (less any exemptions), equals the tax rate for FY24.
The following is a summary of the votes required by the City Council.
•

Transfer of Excess Overlay Balances. The City is authorized to increase each tax levy by up
to five percent as an “overlay” to provide for tax abatements. If abatements are granted in
excess of the applicable overlay, the excess is required to be added to the next tax levy, or
transfers may be made from surplus balances from prior fiscal years.
Overall, the City has approximately $15.7 million in overlay balances as of June 30, 2023.
However, there are cases pending at the Appellate Tax Board for which the City must have
sufficient balances to cover abatements if it loses these cases. Based upon the overall size of
the overlay surplus, I am recommending that the City use $2 million of this surplus to
decrease the tax levy. This conservative approach will allow the City to maintain a sufficient
overlay reserve while reducing the overlay balance to help lower the tax levy.

•

Classify Property and Establish Minimum Residential Factor. Since 1984, the City Council
has voted annually to follow State law allowing the classification of property according to use

10
Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: FY24 Tax Rate Letter 9_28_23_ FINAL (CMA 2023 #250 : FY24 Tax Rate)

deferral of real estate taxes by elderly persons (at least 65 years old). For this fiscal year will result
in:

1.1.a

(residential or commercial) and to allocate the legal maximum portion of the tax levy to the
commercial class. Under the 175% Shift state law allows the residential portion of the tax levy
to be as low as 50% of what it would be if there were a single tax rate. However, there are
two exceptions to the 50% minimum:

By using the 150% Shift and adopting the 65.0000% Minimum Residential Factor, the 150%
shift does not include the limit on Historical Lowest Residential Tax Percentage, allowing the
City to shift a larger percentage of taxes onto commercial and industrial tax classes.
Under the requirements for classification, the City Council sets the levy distribution each year
by voting for a Minimum Residential Factor. The result of voting for the Minimum Residential
Factor of 65.0000% this year will be a residential property share of the total tax levy of
33.8010%, which is below the lowest historical residential percentage. This means that
Commercial property will pay the remainder, 66.199% of the levy. The commercial portion
of the levy is 137.919% of what it would be with a single tax rate if classification was not
adopted.
•

Residential Exemptions. Home Rule Legislation allowing the City to increase the residential
exemption from 20% to 30% was filed by a unanimous vote of the City Council and signed
into law in September 2003. This change enables the City to grant owner occupants of
residential properties a deduction of up to 30% of the average residential parcel value before
the tax rate is applied. I am recommending that the City Council accept the Residential
Exemption at 30%. This amount is deducted from the assessed value of each owner-occupied
property prior to applying the tax rate. The residential exemption serves to reduce the
effective tax rate on lower valued properties while raising it on higher valued properties.
Since the same amount is deducted from every value, its impact is greatest on the lower
valued properties. The residential exemption is paid for by raising the residential tax rate
sufficiently to cover the number of taxpayers claiming the residential exemption.
For this year there are approximately 13,700 residential exemptions on the Assessing
Department files of owner-occupied homes. The Assessing Department conducts random
audits and responds to inquiries about individuals claiming the residential exemption, to
ensure the validity of the program.

The residential percent of the levy could not drop to less than its lowest level since
classification was initially voted by the City Council (34.5615% in 1985 in Cambridge); and
the 50% level does not cause the commercial class to bear a portion of the levy greater than
175% of what it would be if both classes were taxed equally.

Fiscal year

The City has consistently been able to achieve a lower property tax rate and lower residential
property tax bill than surrounding communities, while also continuing to make significant
investments back into the community. A large part of our ability to do this is due to longstanding fiscal
policies and practices; the ability to typically generate diverse non-property tax revenues; foster new
construction; ability to control budget growth; prudent use of reserves; and the presence of a strong,
stable commercial tax base. It is also important to recognize that a healthy balance of development
between residential and commercial be continued to ensure homeowner’s real estate taxes remain
affordable. As noted in the credit ratings from the nation’s three major rating agencies, the City’s
budgetary flexibility, strong policies and management, and healthy reserves, are considerable
strengths.
As noted in this memo, the City will use additional revenues, and with City Council approval, $2
million of reserves (overlay surplus) in FY24 to lessen the amount to be raised from the property
tax levy, which translates into a lower property tax burden for the taxpayers of the City.
While the City has proven to be financially resilient, especially in the face of the significant
challenges presented during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not immune from economic trends
and outside factors. We will continue to closely monitor market conditions, assessed values,

CONCLUSION
The City’s strong fiscal position has allowed for continued and expanded investments in several
key priority areas including affordable housing and homelessness, school services, early
childhood, climate initiatives, transportation safety, municipal facilities, stormwater
infrastructure, technology, and major street projects. It is important to point out that
Massachusetts communities are limited in how they can raise revenues, resulting in a greater reliance
on the property tax, since it is the largest and most stable revenue source. Sixty five percent (65%) of
the revenues that fund the City’s Operating Budget come from property taxes. As our Operating
Budget continues to grow in order to address new and evolving community needs and goals, we
need to also remain cognizant of the potential impact and burden placed on residential taxpayers.

employment environment, as well as regional, national, and even global trends that can impact
our fiscal situation. In addition, the City will continue to adhere to financial and capital plans, as
well as debt and reserve policies, which provides an important level of flexibility and maintains
our ability to respond to unforeseen circumstances.

We should be very proud of what we have been able to accomplish as well as our practice of
setting ambitious, realistic, goals and priorities for the future. It has been a privilege to be a part
of this journey.
I would like to thank the City Council for their support; the community for their trust; as well as
staff for their hard work; as we continue to move forward in building an innovative and inclusive
Cambridge for everyone, while also providing strong and prudent fiscal management.
Very truly yours,

Yi-An Huang

Looking ahead, it will be increasingly important to recognize the relationship between the annual
budget and the associated impact on property tax bills, particularly regarding goal setting,
prioritization, and the appropriate level of budget growth. We are also currently exploring ways
to bring more structured guidance and increased community engagement into the budget
process.

This Executive Summary, in response to City Council requests, summarizes information contained in
the City Manager’s recommendations for the required votes by the City Council to establish the FY24
residential and commercial tax rates by the Board of Assessors and the Massachusetts Department of
Revenue. Responsible and responsive fiscal policies and practices are key to addressing the challenge of
balancing expansion and investment in new programs and initiatives, while also minimizing the impact of
increases on taxpayers.

For FY24, the total assessed value of taxable property is
$75.9 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over FY23. This is a
6.7% increase over FY23 values, showing the continued
strength of the Cambridge real estate market.

Property Value

For FY24, the residential share of the levy decreased to
33.8% from 34.2% while the residential class makes up
52% of the assessed value. The commercial share of the
levy has increased to 66.2% from 65.8% last year and
makes up 48% of the assessed value.
This year both the residential and commercial property
tax rates will increase. The continued growth in the
industrial class is a benefit to residential taxpayers by
allowing the City to lower the minimum residential factor
calculated by the Department of Revenue.

FY24 New Growth by class

Residential Exemptions

Tax Levy

The residential exemption reduces the property tax
bill by excluding a portion of the residential property
value from taxation for qualified homeowners.

FY24-Change to Lowest Historical Residential Percentage
The continued large new growth of the industrial class has benefited residential taxpayers. The city
has again almost $1 billion dollars in new growth value from the Industrial class. The industrial class
is primarily lab properties in Cambridge. This translates into more than $10 million dollars in tax levy
growth for the industrial class. This has a direct positive impact on the residential taxpayers by lowering
the residential tax rate this year. Additionally, this allows Cambridge to go below the lowest historical
residential percentage for all future years. Lowering the historical percentage is advantageous to
Cambridge homeowners by lowering their taxes when many residential values are increasing in a high
inflation environment.
