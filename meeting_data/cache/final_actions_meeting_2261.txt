PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
MOMENT OF MEDITATION
SUBMISSION OF THE MINUTES

On a motion by Vice Mayor Devereux
the submission of the Minutes for the
July 30, 2018 was accepted by an
affirmative vote of eight members.

PUBLIC COMMENT
Sara Mae Berman, 23 Fayette Street, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. She read from a
prepared written statement regarding Inman Square. She said that the proposal to reconfigure
Inman Square and its traffic pattern seems anti-ethical to the City’s usual progressive purposes.
Jason Targoff, 4 Olive Place, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #8. He stated that he is
President of Cambridge Youth Soccer who is the largest field user of any of the youth groups in
Cambridge. He said that they are reaching children that they have never reached before. He
said that the players reflect the students of the Cambridge Public Schools. He said that youth
sports participation can be an anchor activity for residents in Cambridge. He said that the
downside is that there is not enough field space. He said that they are delighted about the fields
being put in at Russell Field.
George Schneeloch, 81 School Street, Somerville, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. He
read from a prepared written statement regarding City Council approval of the funding request
to allow the City to start reconstruction of Inman Square.
Tom Arria, Director of Athletics, Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (CRLS), spoke on City
Manager Agenda Item #8. He stated his support for this project. He said that several CRLS
teams play at Russell Field. He said that with the number of youth and high school students
participating, the renovation of turf fields allows for more play on a routine and consistent basis.
He said that the project at Russell Field adds new improvements that will encourage more
participation. He asked for City Council support.
Judy Johnson, 55 Antrim Street, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7, Policy Order #4, and
Communications and Reports from Other City Officers #1. She stated that she is opposed to
the appropriation of $5 million dollars. She stated that she agrees with Councillor Kelley to start
this process from the beginning. She said that the low-hanging, easy, less expensive solutions
is where work should be started. She said that the City must exhaust all options along the way.
John Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. He thanked Councillor
Kelley for raising concerns about the current design of Inman Square. He said that Councillor
Kelley has spent a lot of time observing this area. He said that he is aware of the amount of
complexities involved. He said that he has studied and taken Councillor Kelley’s safety test and
he believes that he is right. He urged the City Council to do the same. He said that the plan will
make this intersection less safe. He asked the City Council to vote no on this unwise plan.

Jason Alves, Executive Director, East Cambridge Business Association, spoke on City Manager
Agenda Item #9. He thanked the City for hosting a recent meeting. He said that in attendance
there were four different City departments and 5-6 businesses to talk through concerns. He
said that communication is a big piece. He said that this can help ensure that people can
survive during the construction period. He said that regarding parking, they are awaiting a
report back on the small business parking pass. He said that an issue of concern is the City
Council’s passage of the appropriation and there will be a different user experience in Inman
Square. He said that one thing that the City can do to help maintain an open business
atmosphere is to actively remove snow to maintain parking. He suggested a snow removal plan
for Inman Square and Cambridge Street which will help the businesses survive.
Megan Brook, 103 Inman Street, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. She read from a
prepared written statement in opposition to the appropriation for reconstruction of the
intersection at Inman Square.
Sharon DeVos, 118 Antrim Street, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. She read a
prepared written statement from Mothers Out Front. She submitted letters from eight residents
of Antrim Street who feel strongly that the appropriation of $5 million additional funds is not
appropriate.
Mary Jane Rupert, 36 Antrim Street, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. She stated that
she is opposed to this appropriation. She said that the No Left Turn rule has helped
enormously.
Wendy Woodfield, 395 Broadway, spoke on City Manager Agenda Item #7. She said that the
City must think about the people living in Inman Square. She said that Inman Square is a very
important place. She said that she likes the trees and the whole environment. She said that
she hopes that the City can go back to the roots and think about this as an organic hole.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, talked about the tree canopy. She said the City does not
place enough value on the trees that are disappearing. She said that this is not good for our
mental environment. She said that trees make people feel better and help kids learn better.
She said that humans are meant to co-exist with trees. She asked the City Council to do things
to make the trees happy and healthy. She thanked the City Council for expanding free
breakfast and lunch. Regarding signs on trucks, she said that while she understands the
impetus for this Policy Order, she believes that it is logistically non-enforceable. She suggested
that this Policy Order be re-thought. Regarding the Bank of America sign, she said that this is
worse than what is there currently. She stated that regarding climate control for ballot boxes,
she is not convinced that Cambridge pays enough attention to the security of the machines.
Hasson Rashid, 820 Massachusetts Avenue, read from a prepared written statement regarding
all items related to the homelessness umbrella.

COMMITTEE REPORT # 1

The question now came on suspension of the rules - and on a voice vote the rules were Suspended.
Councillor Simmons stated that this is to bring forward the recommendation from the report from the City
Manager recommending that Elaine DeRosa be appointed to the Cambridge Housing Authority Board and
that this be forwarded to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation. She stated that there
were many comments about how well thought out the recommendation was by the City Manager. She
noted that Ms. DeRosa is a staunch supporter of affordable housing so that Cambridge residents of all
income levels can stay in Cambridge.
The question now came on adoption of Policy Order # 7, the same being an order to confirm the City
Manager’s recommendation of Elaine DeRosa to the Cambridge Housing Authority Board.

Affordable Housing Overlay legislation
POR 2018 #243
Councillor Siddiqui

Councillor Devereux stated that the way that this is written it asks for a timeline on specific steps. She
stated that she was not sure that a timeline within fourteen days is realistic and there is a lot in the
proposal that has not been developed and that the timeline is generic. She stated that the analysis has not
been fully discussed.
Councillor Simmons stated that the timeline is to give the City Council Housing Committee and idea of
what items are needed, to be discussed or votes required to give the committee some sense of progression.
This just provides an outline and is not binding.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that the more communication from Community Development Department the
better. This is to get any information available.
Councillor Simmons noted that the report back is to the City Council and this is to corral all that is
happening.
Councillor Carlone stated that he attended the Planning Board hearing and the board had many questions
and comments which need to be addressed. He stated that he is for maximizing affordable units and there
is a germ of an idea here that makes sense. He commented that he was told that Envision would not lead
to zoning until the springtime. He stated that work to refine this needs to be done. It does include
understanding what the impacts are on adjacent buildings. He stated that older buildings from the 1920’s
and before had character of quality and materials and are different from what is built today. He noted that
there is a lot of discussion that still needs to take place in the Planning Board and from a preliminary
zoning point of view before this can seriously be looked at. He stated that this is the first presentation to
the City Council. He stated that there is a lot that needs to be incorporated into this proposal. He
commented that he has never seen the Planning Board this negative about an issue.
Mayor McGovern stated that the Policy Order just asked for a schedule so that the public could view the
information. He agreed that there is more conversation and process that needs to happen on this topic.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he felt it is too premature to ask for a schedule that leads toward zoning
when the conversation now is still very much about whether this is the right direction to move in and
given that this does not increase the amount of affordable housing in the City. He stated that there has
been tremendous opposition from residents for this idea. He expressed concern that if the City moved too
fast and turn this into a pathway to zoning conversation people will be lost in the process. He suggested
that this be slowed down and allow for more conversation to take place about the goals and how they
interact with each other.
Councillor Mallon commented how can we ask to slow things down when the City Council does not
know how long this will take. She wanted to see the timeline to see what it actually looks like and
whether things need to be slowed or sped up.
Mayor McGovern spoke about some residents that have concerns and there are some residents that
support the overlay. This is a way of being transparent and letting the public know what the timeline
looks like. He stated that the City Council is months away from making any kind of decision. This may
easy anxiety.

Vice Mayor Devereux stated that there are a lot of questions about the Envision timeline in general. She
stated that she is hearing comments that the process is not doing what was anticipated. There is a
Roundtable on Envision on October 22, 2018. She stated that one set of recommendations has been
plucked out and put before the City Council in which the Community Development Department states is a
theoretical state. She stated that the request for a timeline seems to be advancing this without hearing
from staff or the Envision consultants about what is happening with all the other Envision things. She
stated that Envision Alewife is supposedly done and there have been working groups who have done draft
recommendations. There was a Policy Order that requested that the draft recommendations be discussed
by the City Council committees aligned with the topic areas. A charter right was exercised on this Policy
Order. She stated that the Roundtable on October 22, 2018 is a much-needed check in on where we are
on Envision and what are the overall goals. Now the hard part is balancing the goals. She stated that
from the public perspective the only thing that seems to have dominated the conversation is a
recommendation for an Affordable Housing Overlay that has gone through several different versions and
there is a tremendous amount of confusion, misinformation and the thought that this whole process has
been a failure. She stated that she has supported this process but at the end this feels like it is off crack.
She stated that asking for a timeline for this one item which is and is not part of Envision.
The Policy Order was the subject of a RESULT:

2. Transmitting Communication from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation
of $160,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Executive Department Other Ordinary Maintenance
account which will fund an expansion of free food programming for Cambridge youth.
CMA 2018 #237
Mayor McGovern stated that this dates back a couple of years. He stated that the Free Breakfast and
Lunch Program at the schools was reviewed and about the importance of making sure that children are
not at school hungry. He stated the social and emotional learning, behavior and achievement were looked
at as to how they are impacted by hunger. He stated that the Cambridge Public Schools has three
categories: free lunch, reduced lunch and paid lunch. Those that fall in the reduced lunch category have
to pay something. It was decided to eliminate this category completely so all the students will be getting
free breakfast and lunch. He explained that free breakfast is being done for all students, K-12, as well as
for the pre-schools in Cambridge. This is a way to address issues of hunger and food insecurity
with students.
Councillor Mallon thanked the Mayor for his steadfast commitment to making sure that students are fed at
school. She stated that she has worked hard on this issue in Cambridge with the help of the community.
She acknowledged the work of Ms. Liss. She stated that this is going to make a huge difference for so
many children who are unable to pay for reduced lunch.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that as a child she was on the free reduced lunch program and remembered the
embarrassment she felt by going into a different line. She stated that she hated this feeling. She stated
that it does go a long way for children not to feel embarrassed or to have to go into another line for food.
City Manager DePasquale stated that he was City Manager for about two months when this came up. He
stated that he would look at this to see if he could make it work. He stated that the money is secondary to
the implementation. He thanked the School Department who has been working on this with him. This is
the right thing to do and he could not be happier to move this forward.

Extraordinary Expenditures Account to support the completion of the Inman Square Intersection
Improvements Project.
CMA 2018 #242
Councillor Simmons stated that she has mixed feelings about this. She moved suspension of the rules to
bring forward Agenda Item # 9.
The question now came on suspension of the rules and on a voice vote the rules were –
Suspended.
Mayor McGovern read Agenda Item # 9 as follows:
9. A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report
Item Number 18-89, regarding a report on establishing an Inman Square Business Impact Plan.
CMA 2018 #244
Councillor Simmons thanked City staff for work spent on the revitalization of Inman Square. She
acknowledged that Inman Square needs some love and work due to the traffic problems and the upkeep of
the park. She stated that she is not with the City on this yet. She added that she will not be supporting
this. She stated that she submitted the Policy Order to establish an Inman Square Business Impact Plan.
She stated that this does not go far enough for her. She highlighted her concerns. She stated that loyalty
programs are hard to institute. She stated that this has to be better. She stated that once this Business
Strategic Plan is put together she wanted to develop a process to see how this worked or what did not
work that can be used as lessons learned for other business district construction projects. She commented
on the removal of twenty-three parking spaces and the impact on the business retail establishments. She
spoke about snow removal and that cold weather slows down pedestrian travel. She noted that the senior
advocates have informed the City Manager that the City needed to be better at snow removal from them
and that the way snow is removed from sidewalks is inconsistent it is hard for seniors to get around. She
noted that this has not been addressed. She stated that she wanted to send this back because she wanted
more information. She stated that she is not convinced that this is the safest pedestrian cycle path that
could have been developed.
Councillor Carlone stated that consultant has agreed that the interface between pedestrians and cyclists as
designed is not safe. He noted that the reason this project was started was to improve safety for all facets
of transportation. He asked has the elevation of the bike path as it meets the pedestrian flow be resolved.
It was at the same height at both sides of the park versus keeping the bikes six inches lower. Mr. Barr
stated that the grading varies in various areas. He stated that following national best practices, the City is
aiming to have the bike path at sidewalk level such as Western Avenue. He stated that it is carefully
being looked at creating a separation between pedestrians and cyclist, particularly in the new plaza space,


PAGE 10

Oct 15, 2018

to ensure that cyclists are not encroaching with the pedestrian areas. Councillor Carlone stated that he is
referring to when pedestrians and cyclists come in contact. He asked if there is a traffic light for bikes to
stop. Mr. Barr replied at the crosswalk there is a traffic light. Councillor Carlone asked if there has been
an addition of one new crosswalk in the center from the fire station. Mr. Barr stated that crosswalks have
been added that do not currently exist as well as realigning the crosswalks. Councillor Carlone asked
when will the plaza design hearing be held. Ms. Watkins responded that the next hearing is on October
24, 2018 at 6:30 PM at the Cambridgeport School. The focus of the hearing is on the design details of the
plaza and the urban space redesign. She explained that the selected Artist will be at the hearing to
integrate his work into the plaza. Councillor Carlone stated that if the plaza does not work as people
gathering places the City has missed out on this. He added that if the parking spaces are being eliminated
the City has to compensate by getting the snow out of Inman Square. He stated his support for the design.
He spoke about the Business Plan and possible tax abatements. He stated that this is serious if the City’s
work is hurt businesses there should be a way to compensate for this. City Manager DePasquale stated
that making the public aware of this is something that the City can do. Councillor Carlone suggested a
banner outlining the goods available. City Manager DePasquale stated that he is committed to make this
work; the City is in this with the business community.
Councillor Zondervan expressed his support for taking care of the snow removal problem. He spoke
about the tree canopy mitigation for this project and since last discussing this project there has been more
depressing news about the tree canopy.
Councillor Mallon stated that she has many of the reservations that have been shared by her neighbors.
Her concern was the impact on the small, fragile businesses in Inman Square. She stated that she was
glad that the City was open to construction mitigation solutions. She questioned the business pilot permit
program for small businesses will make a difference for them. She explained that two small businesses
are renting driveways from residents. She wanted a report back on this soon. She stated that she takes the
concerns of her neighbors around pedestrian safety seriously. She hoped that this will addressed at the
next community meeting. She noted that her neighbors feel that they go to meetings and the decision has
already been made. She hopes that at the design hearing minds are open for what can be done. She spoke
about the long-term future of the fire station in Inman Square and how it intersects with the design. She
stated that if the Inman Square fire station were relocated what would change on this plan. City Manager
DePasquale stated that there have been discussions with Chief Mahoney and there is no announcement
that this building will be eliminated. Ms. Watkins stated that all understand that the building is a critical
historical building and the building would remain. If this were not a fire station the driveway access in
front would be different. The level of change associated with this will be dealt with as part of a building
redevelopment and would not change the overall approach to the intersection. The change would be
small and limited to the frontage and would change the overall grading.
Councillor Kelley read the North Association of City Transportation Officials Urban Bikeway Design for
Cycle Tracks. It read “the approach to an intersection from the cycle track should be designed to reduce
conflict for bicyclists and/or to provide connections to intersecting bicycle facility types. This is typically
achieved by removing the protected cycle track area or parking lane or lowering a raised cycle track to
street level and shifting the bicycle lane closer to a share with the adjacent vehicle lane.” He added that
there are a variety of different opinions on whether this is a good idea or not. He stated that his opinion is
that it is definitely not.

Mayor McGovern regarding Agenda # 9 on local support and the issue of parking during construction.
He spoke about construction workers, not being Cambridge residents, park at meters and take up the
spaces. He asked if the City has ever worked with contractors to have an offsite for their workers to park
and then shuttle the workers to the site. He asked could this be done in Inman Square. Ms. Watkins
stated that on larger projects storage for larger equipment and limiting non-contractor vehicles would be
part of the contract documents. Mayor McGovern stated that there are things that can be done to lessen
the impact which could include a more aggressive construction schedule requiring things to be done at
night or construction during off hours. He urged the City to communicate with the community
beforehand. He stated that regarding Agenda # 7 there has been opposition but there has also been
support for the project. He stated that the City Council has heard from cyclists who think that this plan is
safer. He stated that this plan has evolved from the first iteration based on community input. He spoke
about the estimate has always been between $5-7 million. City Manager DePasquale stated that the City
has stated that this project will be $6 million in total; $4 million from an appropriation from fund balance
and $2 million in bond proceeds. He addressed the concerns raised through the process on the cost, the
amount has increased $1 million to make this the best project available for all. Mayor McGovern stated
that this will cost more money, but he wants the best possible outcome. He explained that he has held
four meetings with those who are not in favor of this plan to discuss and listen to their concerns. He
noted that listening and agreeing are two different things. He stated that he gets offended when stated in
public comment that the City Council does not listen to the public. City Manager DePasquale stated that
he and the staff have held meetings to listen to the concerns of the community and tried to address them.
He stated that he would be voting in favor of this. He explained that the decision in front of the City
Council is either move ahead with the Inman Square project or do nothing. He added what is being
proposed is safer.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked what goes into getting a plan from 75% to 100%. She stated that this may
help people to understand that the City is thinking about all of these things. Ms. Watkins stated that the
75% is a good two-dimensional plan. She explained that going between 75-100% is going toward detail
design and looking at the detail of grading, catch basins locations, all the utility conflicts and the
possibility of relocating utilities. The meeting later in the month is to hone in on the design of the plaza
which has evolved but has not been finalized in the details. The detail specifications are developed
between the 75-100%. Vice Mayor Devereux commented on the grading and where the grading is
managed for cyclists and pedestrians and where the conflict points exist as well as the signals. She stated
that this is a safer plan. The City has listened and made tradeoffs for this complicated intersection. She
noted that the buses are an important part of making this intersection work. She stated that with the plan
bus travel maybe more efficient and hopefully more people will take the bus through Inman Square.
Councillor Zondervan stated that before he took public office he met with the City Manager and then
Councillor Devereux on this issue. He noted that the City did listen and tried to reevaluate the plans and
there was more community process after this. He stated that there was a thorough community process.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that she will be voting in support of the redesign. She stated that she was
digging deep to find the “conspiracy” and to find things, but what she found was that thorough
communication is always great but, in this process, she has come to trust that the City is doing the right
thing now. She stated that the City Council hires the City Manager who hires staff to do their due
diligence. This was done. She noted that this is a frustrating process. She stated that she is grateful for
the work done.
Mayor McGovern moved Agenda Item #9. The item was -

Oct 15, 2018

Councillor Zondervan stated he was glad that this process is being revisited. He stated that he was
intrigued by including the job linkage fee. He asked how these funds would be used. Ms. Farooq stated
that the notion of a Job Linkage Fee is to create a trust that focuses on workforce and job. The idea is to
look at the impact of new development on training needs for Cambridge residents. She noted that this
was raised as worthy of investigation to see what this impact translates to and through the study get an
understanding of what the implications would be as to how the City Council may want to modify the
Incentive to go forward with a Jobs Linkage and what the amount may be. The City is thinking through
the implications on the housing side on whether there is no change or a reduced amount of housing
incentive in creating a new Jobs Incentive. She noted that the tradeoff will need to be discussed. This
will be a policy choice for the City Council to make once the analysis is received. Councillor Zondervan
suggested opening the conversation wider to include other things besides jobs. He stated that the City
Council receives feedback from resident for other needs. He commented that every time a grocery store
closes that offers affordable options this impacts the lives of people to live in Cambridge. He stated that
if affordable housing is provided but residents cannot get groceries this does not solve the problem. He
spoke about the environment impact and direct compensation for the environmental impacts to the City.
He wanted to broaden the concept and come up with a more holistic linkage fee policy to address more of
the community concerns.
Councillor Siddiqui spoke about in Boston some of the funding has gone towards tuition free community
college plan. She stated that there are unique ways that this funding can be used. She was supportive of
examine the issue and it is a good step forward. She noted that the RFP is due on October 18, 2018. She
asked how many consultants have applied. Ms. Farooq stated that this information is not available
because consultants do not submit their proposals until the end. She stated that RFP has been framed to
specifically look into the housing and the jobs linkage. She stated that in the current format the City
cannot add the component referenced by Councillor Zondervan. Even for a jobs linkage the City would
require a home rule legislation if the City Council wanted to move forward would require authorization
from the state. She stated that the City Solicitor would need to investigate what is the framework in
Massachusetts for a broader spectrum of public benefits. Councillor Siddiqui asked what the time frame
is to review the proposals. Ms. Farooq responded a month is a reasonable amount of time to select a
consultant but then there is a contract negotiation period after before the consultant is on board to begin
the work. She spoke access to jobs and how does the City get residents into the jobs.


PAGE 14

Oct 15, 2018

Vice Mayor Devereux stated that when zoning changes or PUDs are negotiated one of the community
benefits is a contribution to some job training program or something like this. She stated that if there
were a fee that went to a trust or something to administer it, it would help to coordinate the efforts better
and make them more predictable. She stated that there are advantages to doing this. She looked forward
to this committee hearing and suggested that someone from Boston or Somerville be invited to explain
how this is working and how it is administered. She spoke about the timing of the study. The RFP will
come back, a consultant will be selected, and the consultant will do the work and this will take 4-5
months. She noted that in September the last increase was reached that was built into the prior law. The
City Council needs to vote on something so that next year with the amount is set. Ms. Farooq stated that
the last increase that the City Council voted on went into effect in September and the fee including CPI is
now $15.95. The earliest that the RFP could have been put out is September. She explained that once the
consultant is selected it takes about one month to do the contract negotiations and then the work starts.
She stated that the last study took about eight months. She expects that it will be less onerous this time
because of the template mythology update. The study could take six months. The goal is that within a
year from now if the City Council has figured out their policy direction in terms of any modifications to
the incentive ordinance. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the report will be received around the summer
break and there may not be Ordinance Committee hearings until the fall on what is recommended. She
asked what happens next fall when the next increase is scheduled to happen if the City Council has not
agreed to have an increase. Ms. Farooq stated that it is not clear what the study will reveal especially if
looking at a jobs linkage component. There may not be a recommendation to increase the housing side.
The CPI change would be triggered September 2019. Vice Mayor Devereux noted that a new fee could
be instituted before September 2020. Ms. Farooq stated that the City Council is not bound to a September
schedule.
The report was RESULT:

Technology field and work as Computer User Support Specialists, Help Desk Technicians, etc.
CMA 2018 #247
Councillor Mallon asked about the non-profits that will be administering this grant. Ms. Semonoff stated
that this is the same program proposed by Just-A-Start and has funding from the state and funding raised
to run this program. She stated that the next cycle of the program begins in December. She stated that
the next cycle will include seventeen students and are recruit twelve students who will get additional
support through the Community Learning Center at 4.5 hours a week with a focus on writing skills,
business customer service skills and skills beyond the technical IT skills but would make it possible to get
hired at the end of the process. She stated that recruitment will be primarily Cambridge residents and if
there are not an adequate number of Cambridge residents it would be opened beyond the City. She stated
that more than a half of the students have been recruited and are in the process of recruiting the
remainder. Councillor Mallon asked if Just-A-Start has a partnership with local IT companies. Ms.
Semonoff they are working with local companies.
Councillor Carlone stated that the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority has a training program and that
Volpe as part of MIT’s Special Permit is to help set up a training program. He asked about linking up
with other organizations in the future. Ms. Semonoff stated that with joint funding from the City and

of the training programs. The purpose of the study is to do a deeper dive into who is here, who would be
eligible, interested and what supports are needed to participate and what kind of training leads to
what kind of jobs. The outgrowth of this work will help to understand what is it that Cambridge wants to
support so that our residents are getting the training wanted.

of $65,000.00 from Free Cash to the General Fund Human Service Programs Other Ordinary
Maintenance account to increase the funding for legal services for Cambridge residents at risk of
losing their housing.
CMA 2018 #249
Councillor Siddiqui stated that this increased funding is to hire another attorney and is significant. She
spoke about the increased caseload and facing eviction without a lawyer does represent an imbalance in
the justice system. The more legal aid the more tenants, with attorneys, have a better chance of reaching
agreements with landlords so they can stay in their homes and avoid an eviction. She stated that the goal
would be to create an eviction fund.
Councillor Carlone stated that this is helping people at their lowest points in their lives. How many
clients will this help. Ms. Semonoff stated that this funding is for an additional attorney working on
behalf of Cambridge residents. They are committed to serving roughly one hundred households with
direct legal services. This funding commits Cambridge Somerville Legal Services to keeping office space
in Cambridge which is critically important. She added that the funding provided increases the income
limits of who services will be provided for. She stated that city staff is coached by Cambridge Somerville
Legal Services.
Councillor Zondervan asked how we prevent people from needing these services and being evicted.
Councillor Simmons spoke about the dire need for housing.
Mayor McGovern asked about the language capabilities of the attorneys and is there support for
translation services. Ms. Semonoff stated that there is a language line that can be used.
Mayor McGovern moved to amend the Agenda Item to strike out the Grant Fund and insert in

Maintenance account to support formerly homeless individuals residing at the YMCA.
CMA 2018 #250
Councillor Carlone stated that ten percent of the units at 98 Concord Avenue will be for the homeless. He
wanted information on how many people this program serves. He asked is the City making progress. Ms.
Semonoff stated that there are twenty-two beds at the YMCA, some are market rate, and some are
dedicated through different programs to provide services to individuals. She stated that the twenty-two
beds are funded by the state and the City has provided the staff for the men who have been living in the
units. This was designed for a two-year period to help people get stabilized and then move to permanent
housing. She stated that it is difficult for people to move from temporary housing to permanent
housing. The City had been pursuing with the state funding entity to turn the units into permanent
supported housing units which would allow people to stay and get services. She spoke about turning the
beds that turn over to long-term people who have been in shelters in Cambridge who would need more
support to live in the units. She spoke about funding for a recovery coach as a part of this to do a better
job of providing services. She stated that the individuals who are living in the units, they have the right to
stay for two years or be converted into permanent and there are some beds that are opening and the
City has been helping individuals coming from the Albany Street shelter to move into this housing. She
stated that the City makes progress when any individual who has been homeless gets permanent housing.
She stated that there were 67 housing vouchers received designed for those who are chronically homeless.
The challenge is now can the service providers, collectively, help them find the units.
Councillor Toomey stated that he has proposed single room occupancy for this problem for years. He
spoke again about the city acquiring large homes for single room occupancies. This is the most feasible
way to help these individuals.

16. Transmitting Communication from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation
of $117,000.00 from Free Cash to the General Fund Human Service Programs Other Ordinary
Maintenance account to fund the RFP for the Study of Universal Pre-School Program Models.
CMA 2018 #251
Councillor Mallon was is the target timeline for the report back with the recommendations. Ms.
Semonoff stated that the report should be back at the end of April or May. Councillor Mallon asked how
does this interact with the RFP for the Tobin? She noted that the RFP stated that the school will have 236
more students, but the RFP shows that the majority of the students are in the middle school and does not
specific any additional students in the PreK area. If providing Universal PreK for four-year-old is
specified the Tobin would be the logical place to house these students. She requested information about
the intersection of both RFPs. Deputy City Manager Peterson stated that last year an analysis
was done about how big a building could be built at this location. An assumption was made that a
number of general classrooms would be added including the possibility of adding more PreK spaces.
This was a fit-out to see about space. She stated that a bigger building could be built on the site. In terms
of the RFP that went out the City has received seven proposals and in the process of hiring a design team.
The design team will be hired over the next couple of months. There were general programming numbers
included in the RFP which were added and increased by the School Department. She explained in the
first phase when the design team is hired the feasibility study will be done. In the feasibility study the
most important piece is the detailed programming. The City will be meeting will all parties involved to
determine the programming needs are and then it will be more realistic. During the feasibility study,
costs, siting and what placement on the facility it makes the most sense, programming and then there is a
decision point. This will be towards the end of next year. She stated that students and staff will be
leaving
the Tobin in June 2020 because then the environmental mediation of the site will be reviewed. She noted
that there is time to work through what the programming will be and how it will be spaced out between
Preschool and Middle School. Mayor McGovern noted that Tobin building is not on this Agenda Item.
Councillor Mallon stated that her question was between the timing of the two RFPs and developing
detailed programming without the RFP and recommendations back on early education and expressed her
concern that the timing is not aligning that would be most helpful. Mayor McGovern stated that the
School Department has its own consultant looking at JK, K and this report is due back by the end of this
calendar year. Deputy City Manager Peterson stated that the City will make sure that they align. This is
critical information.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she did not get the impression that the RFP was specifically to explore
an early childhood center. She stated affordable PreK could mean what is currently being done for four
year old and there was a measure not to disrupt this eco-system and looking at training the teachers so
that the overall quality improves. Ms. Semonoff stated that what is being asked for from the consultants
is to look at various models for expansion of preschool. A model is what would it look like if all the four
years older were being served by the schools. She stated that all the places around the country that have
expanded access for four-year old have done this through a combination of schools and community and
Charter School Programs. The consultants have been asked to look at models around the country and to
come back with proposals.
Councillor Carlone asked if what is learned about the four-year-old issue will give a leg up on the three


PAGE 18

year old. Ms. Semonoff spoke about the impact of three and four-year-old on the capacity of the
programs that serve young children and changing the demographics of the City. She stated that what is
learned about four-year-old is critically important to three-year-old. She stated that now the focus is what
would it look like to expand to four-year-old?

Councillor Carlone stated that the Envision plan really does not have great value if the policy makers do
not discuss or buy into it. There are many good recommendations which will be prioritized and
implemented over a 5-10-year period. He stated that the City Council is the group that will help to
prioritize. He encouraged his colleague to vote for this Policy Order.
Councillor Simmons stated that she supports the essence of the Policy Order but has concerns. She stated
that her primary concern is that amount spent on the Envision process and the expectation has been that
the Envision process would compile all the information and recommendations and then compile them into
a comprehensive report for the City Council to consider. She commented that the Policy Order appears to
be asking the City Council to take the unfinished portions of the Policy Order and teasing out the
elements more. This is like asking the individual committees to each take the incomplete portion to
discuss without knowing the whole product. She stated that she did not understand why the City Council
would not wait for the report to be finished and then to a retreat to look at it in its entire context as
opposed to looking at it in one committee. She compared this with the K2C2 process. She stated that this
is premature, and she feels that this will delay the process. She stated that her other concerns are how is
the work impacting the other work of the committees. She stated that this is not the best us of our time;
we should wait for the final report and then look at the entire report. She spoke about getting more people
in the process.
Mayor McGovern asked if a committee hearing is the best way to do this because there have been several
meetings in the community about Envision that has not included the City Council. He stated that the
committee hearings are two hours and there is public comment and he envisions the committees not
having the full discussion because of public comment. If the purpose of this is for the City Council to hear
from Utile and then give City Council feedback. He stated that maybe a series of Roundtables are
needed. Councillor Carlone stated that if you would rather have six Roundtables he is for this. He noted
that the City Council is part of the process and have not been part of the process. There have not been
enough Roundtables. He stated that the City Council needs to be educated on what we will approve or
not. He commented that thirty-four of the thirty-six months are over. He stated that the recommendations
are 99.5% complete and the sooner that the City Council looks at this and gives feedback the betters. He
stated that he has questions. He stated that it is better to discuss the report before it is finalized.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she was envisioning these committee hearings as being an opportunity
for the City Council, not for Utile to be present, to look at the matrix of the draft recommendations and
suggestions that each of the working groups has developed and each of the working groups are working in
a siloed fashion. She noted that each of the working groups may not know what the other working groups
are working on. This would give the City Council an opportunity to look at the laundry list of
suggestions that these working groups have put together and shift out the items that the City Council
wants to focus on. She noted that the City Council needs to provide some breadth to the priorities and
figure out how the priorities will work together and what are the tradeoffs. She stated that this
conversation is invaluable.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the City Council just discussed the Inman Square project and how much
this project benefitted from more conversation. This is for the entire City. He asked why the City
Council would not want to maximize the amount of conversation about this. He does not see the problem.
He stated that the City Council should just do it.
Councillor Simmons stated that she wanted to have a conversation that was goal oriented with time tables.
Her biggest concern is scheduling the committee hearings and to let the community into the discussion.
She wanted to know if there will be another discussion about the final product. She noted that the
committee process is the place where policy decisions are vetted.


PAGE 21

Mayor McGovern asked if the committee format is the right place for these discussions. Councillor
Carlone stated that the committees are discussing many of the issues. He stated that he has no problem
with this being a Roundtable format. He stated that structured properly we can get through this work in
two hours.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the anxiety over this suggestion is related to the Housing
recommendations. All of these working group meetings have not been well attended and the public haven
not had an opportunity to speak.
Councillor Zondervan noted that the format of the committee hearings is up to the Chair. He stated that
he has not chaired a committee hearing with an hour of public comment. This is up to the Chairs to
decide if they want to discuss at a committee hearing.
Councillor Simmons stated that the City Council has to consider how difficult it is to schedule committee
hearings. She suggested that this be a Roundtable discussion because it is a working meeting. She noted
that there is no public comment during Roundtables.
Mayor McGovern stated that what he heard from Councillor Carlone was that the City Council has lack
the opportunity to discuss this with Utile.
Vice Mayor Devereux noted that no votes are taken at Roundtables. She stated that she felt that the
committee format is the right venue.
Councillor Carlone stated that this is a City document that was put together by Community Development
in consultation with Utile.

NON-CONSENT POLICY ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS
1. That the City Manager confer with the City Solicitor’s Office on the legal question and the feasibility
of placing a condition in public bidding documents prohibiting municipal contractors from displaying
any signage—other than company markers and contact information—on vehicles.
POR 2018 #236
Councillor Siddiqui, Mayor McGovern, Vice Mayor Devereux
Councillor Siddiqui stated that this is not asking the City Manager to put a condition. This is to figure out
a legal question. This is about private contractors versus employees and getting this understanding and
information.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he is unclear on the hiring or private contractors for municipal contracts
and what this means. He stated that he is concerned that this is stepping on First Amendment territory.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that there is a question and the Policy Order is to figure out the question.
Mayor McGovern stated that he also wanted an answer to the question. He stated that he does not think
that this can be done in terms of public bidding.
Councillor Kelley stated that of all the thing that he would like the City Solicitor to spend time on this
does not rise to one of them. He noted that the City Council is still awaiting feedback on many items. He
stated that he would not support this because the issue is the messaging.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the Policy Order is not worded in a way that he feels comfort enough to
support this as such. He noted that for the government to regulate speech at all it must be a compelling
state interest, and this is not indicated in the text. He stated that if the wording were clearer and stated
that exact issue that is being addressed he may be able to support this.
The following order was now considered, the question being on adoption, to wit:

Adopted.
4. That the Chairs of the Ordinance Committee schedule a hearing on Tree Protections and the Chairs of
the Health & Environment Committee schedule public hearings on Tree Protections and the
preliminary results from the Ordinance Committee hearing.
POR 2018 #239
Councillor Zondervan
Councillor Zondervan spoke about the latest canopy study report. He noted that there was a 7% canopy
loss from 2009 to 2014 and the latest preliminary report indicates that there is an 18% loss of the tree
canopy from 2009 to April 2018. He noted that this is almost 1/5 of canopy loss in a decade. He stated
that there is 17.9% canopy loss in the residential area and that this almost matches the 18% loss. He
commented that it is unknown what is causing this canopy loss. He stated that the City has grown about
½ of what was lost, and this indicates that the problem is too many trees are being cut down. He stated
that he understands the desire to wait for the task force to complete its recommendations before looking at
policy issues. He stated that the City does not have to wait until next spring to wait to protect the trees on
private property. He stated that he is asking specifically to look at the urgency to look specifically at the
issue of trees on private property because the City is experiencing significant canopy loss in the
residential areas.
Councillor Carlone stated that the tree canopy presentation was grim. He noted that the problem is
private property and would require extensive new care to remediate this as soon as possible. He noted
that the Ordinance Committee does not have a chart of the Municipal Ordinances that are under
discussion. He stated that this hearing will be scheduled in the near future.
Councillor Mallon expressed concerns of the timing of scheduling a hearing before the Ordinance
Committee. She noted the items on Unfinished Business awaiting additional information before the City
Council can vote on the items. She expressed concerns having an Ordinance Committee hearing when
there is a task force that will be submitting recommendations. She stated that this can wait for the
recommendations.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that the Co-Chairs of the Ordinance Committee can schedule this hearing and
that there is no need for this Policy Order.
Vice Mayor Devereux noted that the task force should have their recommendations finalized by April.
She stated that most of the Tree Ordinances being researched from all over the country regulate trees on
private property. She stated that she feels confident that this is the direction that the task force
recommendations will take and will be more complex than this interim measure. The interim measure
does not prevent anyone from removing a tree. She suggested that the hired consultant attend the
committee hearings to help the City Council get the conversation started and ask the Department of Public
Works to pull the recommendations out of the process as an early action or accelerated piece of the
recommendations.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that e-mails were received from members of the public who thought that the
City Council would be voting on this tonight.

Mayor McGovern stated that there are a lot of outstanding things before the Ordinance Committee and
noted that the Ordinance Committee may be discussing something that the committee does not have the
full picture. He encouraged the Co-Chairs of the Health and Environment Committee to schedule a
hearing to discuss this.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the City Council can wait to receive the recommendations from the task
force but could ask for this as an early recommendation before April. He noted that trees are being cut
down from now until January. He noted that every month delayed is an acre of trees lost.
Councillor Simmons stated that the understands the spirit of the Policy Order but wanted a chance for
more understanding.
Councillor Simmons moved her RESULT:

Department, and Office of Budget and Finance to prioritize these Public Safety outreach measures in

(HERE INSERT ORIGINAL POLICY ORDER # 5)
Councillor Mallon spoke about the Police and Fire Departments work to diversify their workforce and
reflects the diversity in Cambridge and helping Cambridge youth enter public safety careers. She
announced that the Police Department will restart a cadet program that will allow youth at eighteen to
start training to become a police officer until they can formally enter the Police Academy at twenty-one
years of age. She stated that the Fire Department is looking at other ways to engage with community
members, particularly the youth by creating a community relations division to bolster recruitment efforts.
She stated that there is also a Fire and Police Youth Program that are well attended by youth aged
fourteen and fifteen.
Councillor Simmons moved to amend the aforementioned Policy Order by being adding as a co-sponsor.
She explained the hiring requirement of civil service.
