The Value-to-Cost Balance
• Developers are concerned about both cost and value
• Value can mean different things to different developers
• Market developers: value = future rent stream, future sale of asset for profit
• Institutional developers: value = support for long-term mission

• Costs come before project completion (mostly), value comes after project
completion
• Sometimes higher costs lead to greater value
• Aim is to optimize value over costs – “Highest and Best Use”

What Costs Go Into Development?
• Construction is the largest
cost component
• Specific costs vary project-byproject due to many factors

What Factors Affect Cost?
• Building use (e.g., commercial, residential) and market served (e.g., Class A, B)
• Building size and design features
• Market for construction labor and materials
• Land prices
• Cost of capital (e.g., interest rates, return on equity)
• Time between incurring costs and realizing value (e.g., design, permitting,
construction, marketing and occupancy)
• Fees and other “soft costs”

How Does Zoning Affect Value and Cost?
• Primarily: Sets controls for what type and
intensity of land use is allowed
• E.g., residential vs. institutional vs. commercial
use
• E.g., small buildings vs. larger buildings, allowed
height and density

• Affects both value (e.g., bigger building =
more rental income) and costs (e.g., bigger
building = more expensive to build)
• Often, greater height and density means
better value-to-cost margin due to
economies of scale – but not always the
case for every development

How Does Zoning Affect Value and Cost?
• Secondarily: Sets Development Standards
that affect project design and permitting
• E.g., setbacks and dimensional limitations
• E.g., environmental performance
• E.g., affordable housing or other public
contributions for increased development
• E.g., review procedures

• Standards can add design constraints that
affect costs in project-specific ways
• Public contributions can be easy or hard to
quantify
• Some standards are not in zoning

Other Policies Affecting Value and Cost
• Base building codes (incl. health, fire, energy) – standardized statewide,
based on international models
• Property taxes – applies to all land, not just development, but can affect land
costs and future rents (depending on whether building owner or tenants pay
taxes)
• Public amenities and services (e.g., parks, schools) – contribute to residential
values in particular

Public Contributions
• Inclusionary Housing and Linkage (Incentive Zoning) are the most common
types of required contributions
• Inclusionary Housing obligation is met on an ongoing basis as units are kept
affordable over time, typically subsidized by revenue from additional market
units. Effects on total revenue are difficult to predict because they depend on
future market conditions.
• Cambridge’s policy is based on a feasibility analysis (2017) and includes an
allowed 30% increase in development density.
• Costs of linkage contributions are easier to predict because they are usually a
fixed one-time payment made at project permitting or completion.

Environmental Performance Standards
• Typical focus on sustainability, environmental impacts
• Based on public planning efforts – e.g., climate change, public infrastructure
• Often “performance-based,” meaning standards can be met in different ways
– good design approaches can meet multiple standards at once

• Effects on development costs are variable and project-specific – need to
assume what a developer would do without a standard in place
• Sometimes needs a specialized consultant and/or time for staff review
• Short-term development costs can be offset by increased value or other longterm benefit
• Note: Some relevant non-zoning standards are included.

Transportation Mitigation / Management
• Typically requires a transportation impact study (TIS) that informs a
negotiated mitigation package specific to the site and project
• TIS alone can be costly and time-consuming, usually needing a paid
consultant and time to conduct traffic counts

• Traffic mitigation usually negotiated on a case-by-case basis
• Programs like PTDM can have substantial benefit for low cost, but need
ongoing commitment (costs add up over time); conversely, can also increase
value for larger projects because it helps reduce traffic impacts
• Parking requirements can have high costs because auto parking is costly to
build, especially in structures – but can add value to projects

• Bicycle parking requirements add cost but less than auto parking, because
they require less space and fewer structural/mechanical needs

Design/Development Review
• Development often triggers a review process
• Often this involves a discretionary permit (e.g., special permit), but
sometimes is advisory
• Review is guided by urban design objectives, compatibility with site-specific
context, input from the community
• Review can add time, but can take less additional time if it runs concurrently
with the design process
• Design changes can add to design and construction cost
• Discretionary permits can add both time and uncertainty as to whether a
project will be approved, and could have the risk of appeal

Costs are Hard to Quantify
• Standards overlap – the net increase in construction cost may be different
than the sum of each individual requirement
• Some requirements affect revenue rather than costs – e.g., inclusionary
• Some standards can increase construction costs but reduce operating
costs (e.g., green building standards can reduce future utility costs)
• Some standards can add value as well as costs – e.g., higher rent for LEEDrated or resilient buildings
• In the long run, higher development costs due to regulatory requirements
might be offset by lower land costs – though it takes time to play out

What Matters to Developers the Most?
• Predictability – knowing what the standards will be long before conceiving a
development project (e.g., phase-in period)
• Clarity – avoiding standards that are open to broad interpretation
• Flexibility – standards that can be adapted to different types of scenarios and
conditions, avoiding the need to seek relief
• Consistency – review process has a determinate length and avoids adding
unexpected costs during the process
