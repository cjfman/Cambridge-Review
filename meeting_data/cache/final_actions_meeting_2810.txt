Public Comment

>> HI, I'M ALAN. I'M BETWEEN LEASES AND WILL BE AT 21 UNION STREET.
AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER NUMBER 10, THE CONDO
CONVERSION. AND AS WELL AS POLICY ORDER 8. AND ON CONDO
CONVERSION, I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ORDINANCE DOESN'T NOR SHOULD
IT BAN CONDO CONVERSION OUTRIGHT. ANY TENANTS AFFECTED IS TREATED
JUSTLY, AND GIVEN NOTICE TO GET AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND COMPENSATED
FOR RELOCATED. PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OF RENTERS AND PROTECTING
THEM FROM IMMEDIATE INSECURITY. IF WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT KIND OF
PROTECTION TO ALL KINDS OF CONVERSIONS, INCLUDING RENTAL TO
RENTAL, I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. THE STATE GIVES THE RIGHT TO
SPECIFICALLY REGULATE CONDO CONVERSIONS, SPECIFICALLY REGULATING
THEM WHAT WE SHOULD DO. ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, I DO BELIEVE

Jun 28, 2021

OUR BOARDS ARE UNREPRESENTED AND OUT OF TOUCH AND I'M IN SUPPORT
OF THE CHARTER AMENDMENT, BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT THE MANAGER
CONTROLS APPOINTMENTS THE ISSUE IS THE JOB IS AWFUL AND
UNAPPEALING ONLY PEOPLE WITH A PRIVILEGE AMOUNT OF FREE TIME AND
A VERY PARTICULAR SENSE OF DEVOTION WOULD CONSIDER APPLYING. THAT
DEVOTION CAN BE APPLAUDABLE, BUT IT IS A PROBLEMATIC NEIGHBORHOOD
DEFENDER TYPE OF DEVOTION. THE SOLUTION IS TO MAKE THE JOB OF BEING
ON THE BOARD OR COMMISSION MORE APPEALING TO ENCOURAGE MORE
AND APPLICANTS OF UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS. I'M IN SUPPORT
OF POLICY ORDER 8 AND I HOPE WE CAN GET STIPENDS AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE. WE NEED A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION. AND
WHETHER THE WORK BEFORE THE BOARD IS THE BEST USE OF THE TIME AND
ATTENTION. I THINK THE PLANNING BOARD, IT IS TIED UP IN SPECIAL
PERMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS THEY DON'T DO REAL CITY WIDE
PLANNING. MOST CASES THAT MAKE YOU THINK WHY SHOULD THIS BE
BEFORE APPOINTED BOARD. WE SHOULD THINK DEEPER THAN STIPENDS AND
I THINK THE CLOCK IS OFF. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. WE ARE FIXING IT.
>> JONATHAN
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SORRY. YOU CAN HOLD ON A SECOND, Jonathan?
THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE. ALL RIGHT. JONATHAN, GO AHEAD AND THEN
CHRISTOPHER.
>> JONATHAN. HAMPSHIRE STREET. AND LOTS ON THE AGENDA BUT I WILL
FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF POINTS. I URGE YOU TO DENY CHARTER RIGHT ONE.
IT IS THE LAST TIME TO HAVE A BINDING VOTE ON HOW THE MONEY IS
SPENT. WE HEARD THE CITY MANAGER WILL LISTEN TO DISCUSSION, IT IS
GREAT TO SEE THE COUNCIL GET THE BALL ROLLING ON CHARTER REFORM.
THE PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE AND I ASK YOU TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT
THE CHANGES WILL ACCOMPLISH. BEING ABLE TO VETO APPOINTMENTS
WILL GIVE POWER, BUT WILL THE POWER BE USED. THE COUNCIL CAN VOTE
DOWN BUDGETS. YET, IS THAT ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OR
DOES THAT THE BUDGET DECISION GET DEFERRED JUST TO THE CITY
MANAGER.
HOWEVER, THE ONE THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS POLICY ORDER 8. AS
THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER NOTED, WE CAN REALLY USE A LOT OF REFORM AS
TO HOW THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS OPERATE. THE ADVERTISEMENT
FOR THE RECENT PLANNING BOARD OPENING, ESTIMATED ON THE ORDER OF
THOUSAND HOURS OF MEETING TIME OVER THE COURSE OF THE TERM.
THAT DOESN'T COUNT BY SOME ESTIMATES, NEARLY DOUBLE THAT. 3,000
HOUR TIME COMMITMENT FOR THIS BOARD. AND YOU ARE EXPECTING TO
SOMEONE TO DONATE THEIR TIME, NOT BECOME THE KIND OF APPLICANTS
YOU WILL GET, THE PEOPLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY SACRIFICE THEIR TIME AND
BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AND WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CITY
IN THIS WAY IS SUCH A NARROW SLICE OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT I DON'T
THINK IT NECESSARILY GIVES THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'D LIKE. THANK YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT.
>> THANKS. CHRISTOPHER. LAUREL STREET. AND I WANT TO FIRST SPEAK
ON CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER 1, THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN
APPROPRIATION. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CITY ADMINISTRATION AND
MANAGER IS SO DEDICATED TO FINDING WAYS TO ENSURE WE CAN USE THE
FUNDS RESPONSIBLY AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM. I ENCOURAGE THE
CITY COUNSELS TOIL DENY THIS APPROPRIATION. I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A
LONG TERM SOURCE OF FUNDING WITH $65 MILLION ON THE LINE AND I
THINK THAT RATHER THAN APPROVING THIS A SINGLE NUMBER WITHOUT A
PLAN, IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THE CITY MANAGER TALKS TO THE CITY
FIRST. THANKFULLY, MUCH TO OUR CREDIT AND TO THE CITY MANAGER'S
CREDIT, CAMBRIDGE IS WEALTHY AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS
AVAILABLE FOR WHATEVER WE NEED IN MOST CASES, AND I THINK IT WILL BE
OKAY IF WE WAIT A MONTH TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FOR WHICH
FEDERAL APPROVAL ON HOW THEY CAN BE SPENT IS NOT APPROVED YET.
OTHER CITIES LIKE BOSTON ARE POINTING TASK FORCES ON HOW TO SPEND
THIS MONEY BEFORE APPROPRIATING IT AND SOMERVILLE IS HIRING AN
ENTIRE PERSON IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE FUNDS AND HOW THEY ARE
SPENT. I THINK WE CAN FOLLOW THOSE LEADS. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU
TO VOTE IT DOWN. THE TRUST THE CITY MANAGER WILL WORK WITH YOU TO
COME TO AN EQUITABLE RESOLUTION ON HOW TO SPEND THE FUNDS IN THE
FINANCE COMMITTEE AND MOVING FORWARD AFTER THAT. POLICY ORDER
8, STIPENDS, AS SOMEONE WHO APPLIED AND FAILED TO DO THE MATH THAT
JONATHAN SHARED WITH YOU ON 3,000 HOURS OF COMMITMENT, I'M
WONDERING IF I MADE A MISTAKE. I DO THINK THAT A IT IS NOT
SUSTAINABLE TO EXPECT SOMEONE WITH A JOB AND FAMILY TO SPEND FIVE
HOURS EVERY WEEK FOR FREE AND TALKING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE AND
GETTING YELLED AT BY THE PUBLIC. STIPENDS ARE GREAT AND I SUPPORT
THE CONDO CONVERSION ORDINANCE MOVING FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO SAUL.
>> SAUL IS NOT IN THE ZOOM. MIA WAS SIGNED UP TO SPEAK IN PERSON. I
DON'T SEE THEM HERE. WE'LL GO TO NINA. GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR.
>> HI, YES. I WAS GOING TO TALK I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE PROPOSED NAME CHANGE FOR THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD. I
UNDERSTOOD THIS DISCUSSION WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT THAT. I THINK IT
IS PARTICULARLY FASCINATING TO HAVE THIS. I'M A PROFESSIONAL
HISTORIAN AND HAVE STUDIED NAME CHANGES IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
AND IN THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION. SO, I GUESS I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY
ENTHUSIASM FOR PEOPLE'S IMPULSE TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE AGASSIZ
NEIGHBORHOOD. I DON'T THINK THESE CHANGES SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN
LIGHTLY. AND IT IS, I THINK, A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME THE
CONNECTION WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND THE GREAT NATURALISTS HAS
TO BE SNAPPED IN TERMS WITH THIS NAME CHANGE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING ENTHUSIASM FOR IT. IT IS SOMETHING FOR US
TO ALL WATCH AND REALLY TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE


PAGE 3

Jun 28, 2020

BETWEEN THE AGASSIZ SCHOOL, THE BALDWIN SCHOOL AND THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN LENNON GRAD TOOK BACK THE NAME OF ST.
PETERSBURG IN 1991, IT RETAINED THE REGION, THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS
CALLED THE LENNON GRAD NEIGHBORHOOD, THE LENNON GRAD REGION,
WHICH IT STILL IS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND, THERE'S A HUGE
GLOBAL HISTORIC CONTEXT TO NAME CHANGES.
I URGE EVERYBODY TO READ UP ON THEIR HISTORY BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS
A GREAT IDEA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP WE HAVE IVELISE RIVERA.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M THE CEO AND OWNER OF URBAN LEGENDS AND
TOGETHER WITH THE PARTNERS, THE BOSTON GARDEN, WE HOPE TO HAVE
THE RECREATIONAL RETAIL SHOP HERE IN CAMBRIDGE AT 200
OPERATIONAL THIS CALENDAR YEAR. 20 YEAR SERVANT WORKING FOR
BOSTON, I WAS THE COMMISSIONER FOR THE RED SOX FOUNDATION
SOFTBALL LEAGUE AND SERVE ON THE BOARDS OF MADISON PARK
DEVELOPMENT AND DUDLEY STREET NEIGHBORHOOD INITIATIVES, LOCATED
IN ROXBURY. PRIOR TO US FINDING OUR PARTNERS, BOSTON GARDEN WHO
SUPPORTED US, WE HAD PARDONERS THAT ABANDON US BECAUSE THE
PROCESS IN THE COMMONWEALTH TO GETTING A RETAIL CANNABIS SHOP
WAS TOO SLOW AND TO EXPENSIVE. TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE GREAT
PARTNERS WHO STICK WITH US AND OUR FINANCING ONLY HAPPENED
BECAUSE THEY WERE WILLING TO PUT UP LICENSES, PROPERTIES AND THEIR
PERSONAL HOMES UP FOR COLLATERAL AGAINST DEBT FINANCING. IT HAS
BEEN A VERY LONG TOUGH ROAD AND THEY ARE STICKING WITH US TO MAKE
SURE WE BOTH SUCCEED.
I'M HERE TONIGHT TO EXPRESS HOW IMPORTANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE
FOR ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT AND SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS, WHILE
YES THE MORATORIUM HAS GIVEN SOME OF US THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SECURE LOCATION AND HOST AGREEMENT IN CAMBRIDGE, UNFORTUNATELY
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE NUMBER ONE
BARRIER INTO THE CANNABIS MARKET, WHICH IS MONEY. WE KNOW THE
COST TO SECURE LOCATION IN CAMBRIDGE AND WITHOUT FUNDING, WE
WILL LEAVE SOCIAL EQUITY AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS AT
A DISADVANTAGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> HI. I'M JAMES. CAN YOU HEAR ME? JACKSON PLACE, JEFFERSON PARK.
AND I'M SPEAKING ON THE TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCE. JEFFERSON PARK,
THEY PLAN TO TEAR DOWN THE BUILDINGS AND AS PART OF THE PLAN, THEY
WANT TO CUT DOWN AT LEAST 144 TREES OUT OF THE TOTAL OF 204. SOME
OF THE TREES ARE IN BAD SHAPE, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. AND IF THEY GET
UNDERWAY AS THEY DID WITH THE STATE SIDE OF JEFFERSON PARK, THEY
CUT DOWN 88 TREES OUT OF 96 TREES. THEY SAID THEY WOULD SAVE 8.
AND DURING CONSTRUCTION, THEY CUT DOWN AN ADDITIONAL 3 WITHOUT
NOTIFYING ANYBODY AND WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK PERMISSION FROM
ANYBODY, IN THAT CASE THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEAL HAD GIVEN THE


PAGE 4

Jun 28, 2020

APPROVAL.
TREE LOSS IS A SERIOUS MATTER. IT HAD AN IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF
PEOPLE LIVING IN WHAT IS CALLED "AFFORDABLE HOUSING." I REALLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY THE TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCE DOESN'T OFFER
EQUAL PROTECTION TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE IN
CAMBRIDGE. I THINK IT IS BLATANTLY DISCRIMINATORY. I'M SEEING
SOMETHING ODD ON MY SCREEN. OKAY. I'M DOWN TO 37 SECONDS NOW.
THERE'S A VERY MODEST AMENDMENT THAT IS OFFERED. I THINK IF PEOPLE
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF SAVING TREES, THEN THEY SHOULD
SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS INTENDED TO HELP
ADDRESS THAT. IF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO BUILD
HOUSING WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS, IT HAS TO BE DONE THIS WAY IN
CAMBRIDGE, THE CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY NOW CONTROL THE
BELMONT HOUSING AUTHORITY, WHY NOT SPEND MONEY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. HIBA? AND THEN
NICOLE.
>> HELLO. I'M AT PROSPECT STREET. HELLO MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND THE
COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK
TODAY. AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CAMBRIDGE YOUTH
COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 150 TO CHANGE THE NAME AND
HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF MS. BALDWIN. WE DO NOT CONDONE THE
NAME AND THE UNJUST HISTORY THAT HOLDS GIVEN THE WHITE
SUPREMACIST NAME OF AGASSIZ. SHE REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THE
HISTORY STRIVES TO BE AND THE VALUES WE HOLD, BUT CREATED AND
CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT FEW HAVE, LEAST OF ALL
LEE AGASSIZ. WE SUPPORT THE WORK OF THOSE BEFORE HER WHO WORKED
TO RID THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE OF THE NAME. AND THANK YOU AGAIN SO
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. AND WE HOPE THAT YOU
LOOK FAVORABLY POLICY ORDER 150.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NICOLE SNOW.
>> HELLO. GOOD EVENING. NICOLE SNOW, I REPRESENT THE
MASSACHUSETTS PATIENT ADVOCACY ALLIANCE AT 1 BEACON STREET,
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. AND THANK YOU TO THE CAMBRIDGE CITY
COUNCIL FOR HEARING OUR TESTIMONY TODAY. I WOULD LIKE THE CITY
COUNCIL TO PLEASE COME TO A CONCLUSION FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED SO
PATIENTS IN CAMBRIDGE AND SURROUNDING AREAS THAT USE THE
MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL PROGRAM TO ACCESS CANNABIS AS MEDICINE
WILL HAVE CERTAINTY. THE MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS
REACHED OVER 100,000 REGISTERED PATIENTS AND THOSE PARTICIPANTS
LIVING AND WORKING IN CAMBRIDGE WANT TO KNOW THAT THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE CARES ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM'S LONGEVITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE SIEH SAMURA.
>> HELLO. I'M A VERIFIED ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANT FOR
CANNABIS BUSINESS LICENSING IN MASSACHUSETTS AND THE OWNER AND


PAGE 5

Jun 28, 2020

CEO AND LOOKING TO OPEN IN CENTRAL SQUARE, CAMBRIDGE. AND THIS IS
IN REFERENCE TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 11. I JUST HAD A FEW MESSAGES I
WANT I WAS HOPING THE COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER. AS YOU CONSIDER
THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE, I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD CONSIDER THE
EXTREME FINANCIAL HURDLES THAT US ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
APPLICANTS FACE AS WE TRY TO OPEN. MY TEAM, WE ARE NOT MANAGED
OR SUPPORTED BY LARGE NATIONAL CONGLOMERATE AND IT IS EXPENSIVE. I
BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A PUBLIC DIALOGUE TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT WOULD BEST HELP ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS AND
THEIR BUSINESSES.
AND I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT ECONOMIC
EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS NEED ASSISTANCE WITH IS MONEY. IS CAPITAL.
AND THAT TYPE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. I THINK ANY PROGRAM SHOULD
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER REAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT GOING TO ECONOMIC
EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS AND WE LOOK FOR THE COUNCIL ASSISTANCE
IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT MONEY, WHETHER IT IS PUBLIC OR PRIVATE.
AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF VOICES THAT SHOULD BE HEARD ON THIS
ISSUE. I ENCOURAGE A DEEPER DISCUSSION AND A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ON
EXACTLY HOW WE CAN BEST SERVE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS
AND THEIR BUSINESSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I GIVE BACK MY TIME.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LEAH SAMURA.
>> HELLO?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M SORRY, I'M LOSING MY VOICE. I APOLOGIZE. GOOD
EVENING, CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL. I I'M AN ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
APPLICANT AND THE CITY OWNED AND OWNER OF BOUTIQUE AT 31 CHURCH
STREET. SOMETHING I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT, IT WAS ONCE A POLICE
STATION. I WANT TO MAKE A FEW POINTS. WE KNOW THE BEST WAY TO
MEASURE SUCCESS FOR ANY PROGRAM IS BY USING DATA. NUMBERS ARE
THE POWERFUL TOOLS AND THEY DON'T LIE. BEFORE WE EXTEND
SOMETHING LIKE THE MORATORIUM, WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE DATA.
A REPORT SHOULD BE SLIVERED MEASURING THE IMPACT OF THIS
MORATORIUM. WHAT THE NUMBERS WILL SHOW, WITHOUT FUNDING, A
MORATORIUM ALONE DOESN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE. AND TO ALSO MAKE
SURE THIS INDUSTRY IS FAIR FOR ALL AND IT WORKS FOR ALL OF US THAT ARE
INVOLVED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANN CHARLOTTE.
>> THEY HAVE NOT JOINED. NICOLE, UNMUTE YOURSELF AND YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR. (SILENCE). NICOLE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO UNMUTE.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M NICOLE. I'M SPEAKING ON

NUMBER 11. I MYSELF AND ALONG WITH EVERY SMALL BUSINESS OWNER
WAS IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC, FRESHLY TRANSPORTED INTO CENTRAL, I
LEARNED HOW THE SQUARE WAS IMPACTED. DOORS CLOSED TO BUSINESSES
HI SEEN FOR YEARS IN TALKING TO OTHER OWNERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IT SEEMS IT MAY NOT BE OVER. BEING THAT IT HAS BEEN NEARLY FIVE YEARS
SINCE CANNABIS WAS LEGALIZED IN MASSACHUSETTS, NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE
CENTRAL SQUARE SHOULD BE THRIVING MORE THAN IT IS. AND SHOULD BE
RECOVERING AT A FASTER RATE. RECREATIONAL CANNABIS WILL PLACE HUGE
PART IN BRINGING THE SQUARE BACK TO LIFE. I'M ASKING THE COUNCIL TO
SUPPORT THE BUSINESSES, ALL BUSINESSES, BY NOT PLACING A
MORATORIUM ON ANY BUSINESS. WE NEED THE HELP. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS LOREN IN THE ZOOM? NO. FRED MEYER? CLICK THE
BUTTON RIGHT THERE.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
ABOUT THE NAME CHANGE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THIS WEEKEND. AND
THE THING I KEEP HEARING OVER AND OVER, WHY THE SAME NAME AS THE
SCHOOL. OF COURSE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, THERE ARE NO MORE SCHOOL
DISTRICTS AND THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A CLOSE AFFINITY BETWEEN
SCHOOL AND NEIGHBORHOOD. MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE GEOGRAPHICAL
NAMES, LIKE THE NORTH OF HARVARD NEIGHBORHOOD, OR THE OXFORD
STREET FRANCIS AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD. OR THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS
NEIGHBORHOOD. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND OF COURSE, THE MAJORITY
OF OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ARE JUST THAT. NORTH CAMBRIDGE,
WEST CAMBRIDGE, SO FORTH. THEY ARE USED FOR FINDING A PLACE. AND
THE OTHER BIG COMPLAINT I HEAR, ON THIS SO CALLED SURVEY, YOU REALLY
COULDN'T VOTE. IF YOU SAID, NO, I'D LIKE TO LEAVE THE NAME ADD IS. YOU
THEN COULDN'T VOTE FOR ANY OTHER NAME. THAT IS DIRECTLY CONTRARY
TO OUR CAMBRIDGE TRADITION OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
VOTING OR IF YOUR NUMBER ONE CHOICE DOESN'T MAKE IT, MAYBE YOUR
SIXTH CHOICE WILL.
I THINK THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO BRING THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TOGETHER. I
DON'T CARE WHAT IT DECIDES, BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL THEY
HAVE BEEN LED BY A SCHOOL BIASED AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL.
MOST PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. I SPENT TIME
IN THE FRANCIS AVENUE AREA, I HAVE NEVER IN MANY YEARS ON THE
AGASSIZ COUNCIL SEE ANYBODY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD APPEAR. IT IS A
BIAS SURVEY. GIVE US A NORMAL PR BALLOT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE MIA, WHO IS BACK ON THE ZOOM?
>> PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL COME BACK TO MIA. WE'LL GO TO KATLYN
COVENEY.

Jun 28, 2020

>> OKAY. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. I'M IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 147 AS I WOULD LIKE TO
PROVIDE POST OPERATIVE CARE FOR K 9 AND I WANT TO BE PRESENT TO
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I WILL REMAIN ON THE ZOOM CALL IN CASE ANY
COME UP THAT I'M ABLE TO ANSWER AT ANY POINT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PATRICK?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU. I'M PATRICK BARRETT. PLEASANT STREET. AND I'M
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME POLICY ORDER. ALSO, I'D LIKE TO SAY,
GREAT TO SEE YOU GUYS IN THE FLESH AND IN PERSON. MUCH RESPECT FOR
COMING IN AND TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. THERE'S A LOT
WRONG WITH OUR ZONING ORDINANCE. TINY LITTLE THINGS. THAT
PUNISHES HONEST CITIZENS. THE PERSON THAT WENT TO THE BZA TO ASK
FOR A VARIANCE PROPOSED OPERATIVE CARE OF A PET IS SOMETHING ANY
RESIDENT CAN DO FOR THEIR OWN ANIMAL. WENT TO ASK THE USE, TOLD IT
WAS A KENNEL USE AND HAD TO GO FOR A VARIANCE. THAT'S NONSENSE.
LONG IS THERE A NEED FOR AN OMBUDSMAN POSITION AT ISD, IT IS AND FOR
A LACK OF BETTER WORD, IN MANY PLACES, IT IS JUST DUMB. YOU WILL
FORWARD THIS ON TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND THE PLANNING
BOARD. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK FOR A QUICK SECOND, I SUPPORT THE THE
CANNABIS INDUSTRY. YOU GUYS PUT A MORATORIUM IN FOR TWO YEARS.
IN THAT TWO YEARS, OH, BY. PANDEMIC, ALL SORTS OF TERRIBLE THINGS
HAPPENING TO BUSINESS. CENTRAL SQUARE EXISTS RIGHT NOW IN THE
FORM IT DOES BECAUSE OF THE BID. THE BID SAVED CENTRAL SQUARE FROM
THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED MORE SUPPORT FROM THIS CITY. YOU GUYS HAVE
$65 MILLION TO THINK ABOUT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF RESTAURANTS AND
HOSPITALITY, TALK ABOUT EQUITY, WHO DIDN'T GET A DIME FROM THE
RESTAURANT LEASE FUND, WON'T BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT IN TEXAS. TO
EXTEND THE MORATORIUM IN THE NAME OF EQUITY, WHEN SO MANY OTHER
ISSUES IN THE CITY, CHILDREN BEING THE BIGGEST ONE, GO UNANSWERED.
THAT IS A HUGE MISTAKE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ANGELA BRADWAY.
>> HI. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY CALL. I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE
DECISION TO NOT KEEP THE MEMORANDUM IN PLACE. I'M SORRY, I'M
LOSING MY VOICE. I WILL GRAB MY EMAIL UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> OKAY. I'M VOTING AGAINST THE MORATORIUM BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT
THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY REALLY NEED ALL THE HELP THEY
CAN GET AT THE MOMENT. AND I'M CURRENTLY A SOCIAL EQUITY
PARTICIPANT AND I HAVE SEEN ALL TOO WELL HOW HARD IT IS FOR THE
PARTICIPANTS TO GET UP AND RUNNING. I THINK KEEPING THIS
MORATORIUM IT WILL FURTHER BUSINESSES TO GET IN AND HAVE A PLACE
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT IT IS A BIG POINT TO MAKE, THERE'S
A LOT OF PEOPLE TRYING TO PUT INTO FUNDS TO CREATE FOR SOCIAL


PAGE 8

Jun 28, 2020

EQUITY, WHICH I THINK IS GREAT. I THINK THE WILLINGNESS FOR OTHERS TO
WORK WITH SOCIAL EQUITIES IS A BIG DEAL. I THINK TO GET PEOPLE ON
BOARD AND I'M SORRY. MY THROAT IS GOING OUT AND MY VOLUME IS
GOING OUT.
I WANT TO MAKE IT A POINT, THERE IS A $10 MILLION FUND RIGHT NOW IN
OUR COUNTRY FOR EQUITY, I LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE STEP UP AND MAKE
DONATIONS. SOME OF US CAN GET GOING AND SUPPORT OTHER LOCAL
BUSINESSES AROUND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE BRIAN MCCARTHY.
>> BRIAN HAS NOT JOINED. CHERYL MONROE, GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR.
>> HI. I WANT TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT FOR THE
TREE ORDINANCE. WE ARE ALL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT WE'RE NOT
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF IT IS GOING TO IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT
BECAUSE TREES ARE PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENT.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE DEVELOPERS COME ALONG AND THEY ASK THE CITY FOR
CERTAIN THINGS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IMPACTS RESIDENTS OF LOW INCOME.
THEY SEEM TO ALWAYS GET WHAT THEY WANT AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE
RESIDENTS DON'T HAVE A VOICE.
TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO ONE DEVELOPER AND SAY YOU GUYS CAN HAVE THE
ABILITY TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WHEN IT COMES TO TREES AND OTHER
DEVELOPERS COME ALONG AND SAY WE WANT THIS AND THAT, WE DON'T
THINK IT IS FAIR. IN HOUSTON, THERE'S A BIG IMPACT ON WHAT IT LOOKS
LIKE TO HAVE A DEVELOP WITH NO TREES. IT LOOKS REALLY, REALLY
DEVASTATING. ONCE AGAIN, WE DO WANT THE RESIDENTS TO HAVE A
VOICE. I THINK THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT THAT TREES STAY. TREES ARE ENVIRONMENT. EVERYBODY
WANTS TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, BY GIVING SOMEONE TO DECIDE
ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF TREE IS NOT RIGHT. RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN
WORKING WELL WITH CHA WHEN IT COMES TO TREES WITH NO ISSUE. I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE CHANGE THAT CHA IS FIGHTING THE CHANGE
ON THE AMENDMENT SO HARD WHEN WE HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING
TOWARDS NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND COMING TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE
TREES. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME AND WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MIA COUNTER, WE'LL GO TO NEXT.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M A BALDWIN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND CRLS
GRADUATE AND A LIFE LONG RESIDENT WITH GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE
CITY. A YEAR AND HALF AGO, I ADDRESS THE DILEMMA I HAD AS A YOUNG
BLACK GIRL. AGASSIZ IS A BIOLOGIST WHO REJECTED LEGITIMATE SCIENCE
AND PROMOTED RACIST THEORIES ABOUT THE INFERIORITY OF THE BLACK
PEOPLE. IT WAS DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST TO DISCOVER THE HISTORY
OF THE MAN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS HONORING BY CARRYING HIS NAME.
AND MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL RENAMING, BALDWIN WAS A CIVIC LEADER IN
THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, AND WAS ALSO THE FIRST BLACK PRINCIPAL IN ALL


PAGE 9

Jun 28, 2020

OF NEW ENGLAND FOR SEVERAL DECADES. THE DEDICATION TO CREATE SAFE
SPACES, SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF LEGACY OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE
HONORING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HER TIME IS NOT MUCH LONGER
AFTER AGASSIZ FOR THOSE WHO SAY HE WAS A PRODUCT OF THE TIME, SO
SHE WAS SHE, AGAINST SO MANY ODDS. SINCE I STARTED THE INITIATIVE TO
RENAME THE NEIGHBORHOOD, A TEAM, AS WELL AS COUNCIL MEMBERS,
HAVE COME TOGETHER AND ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY IN A
THOROUGH AND EDUCATIONAL AND OPEN PROCESS. WE HAVE CREATED AN
ONLINE CONTEXT AND ENCYCLOPEDIA THAT IS FILLED WITH HISTORY
REGARDING THE HISTORY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE LES's AND PROVIDED
INFORMATION ON OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE PORT, THAT CHANGED
THEIR NAME AND MUCH MORE. WE HAVE SENT FLYERS AND INVITING
PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CITY WIDE SURVEY AND THE RESULTS HAVE
SHOWN SUPPORT FOR THE NAME THE BALDWIN NEIGHBORHOOD
FOLLOWING THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE CITY HAVE SPOKEN AND IT IS
TIME TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT HISTORY BY CHANGING THE NAME AND
HONORING BALDWIN. COUNCIL MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS, I
HAVE HOPE THAT TODAY YOU WILL VOTE TO HONOR MARIA BALDWIN BY
RENAMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER HER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP WE HAVE DENNIS SILVA.
>> HELLO. I SUBMITTED A COMMENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE
AVAILABLE TO SPEAK. I WORK AT MIRACLE OF SCIENCE, PARTNER AND
OWNER OVER THERE. AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF ENDING THE MORATORIUM
ON RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA POLICY AGENDA ITEM 11. THE CENTRAL
SQUARE NEEDS TO EMBRACE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME MORE
PEOPLE TO THE SQUARE. IT WILL BENEFIT EVERY BUSINESS, FROM THE BOOK
STORES, TO THE BAR, MORE BODIES IN THE SQUARE MEANS MORE BUSINESS
FOR EVERYBODY. AND HOPEFULLY, IT CAN BE A BENEFIT AND OPENING UP
SOME OF THE CLOSED STOREFRONTS. I'M AT WORK NOW AND I CAN'T TALK
LONGER, BUT I WANT TO STEP ON TO THE FLOOR TO SUPPORT MY OPINION
THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BENEFIT FROM RECREATIONAL
MARIJUANA AND CANNABIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I WILL GO
BACK TO WORK. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO SUZANNE BLIER.
>> THANK YOU. SEVERAL THINGS ARE INCLUDED HERE. PLEASE VOTE YES FOR
THE AMENDMENT TO COVER THE NEW TREE ORDINANCE SO WE CAN HAVE
THEM FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDINGS, LOW RESIDENTS DESERVE THE
BEAUTY AND HEALTH BENEFITS. WE HAVE A MASSIVE HEAT WAVE IN
OREGON AND WE NEED IT. AND YES, ON CONDO CONVERSION. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME. THE SHIP
HAS NOT SAIL, EVEN INITIATING A THREE YEAR MORATORIUM ON CONDO
CONVERSIONS COULD HELP. ON CANNABIS DELIVERY ZONING, I WOULD
HOPE THIS COULD BE NUANCED SO IT IS NOT GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN THE
CORE SQUARES. HARVARD SQUARE AND OTHERS, BECAUSE IT WILL COMPETE
WITH OPENING UP STREETS FOR PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITIES. PERHAPS FOCUS
ON THE PARTS OF THE CITY WITH MORE PARKING AND MORE AVAILABILITY.

Jun 28, 2020

AND ON THE PILOT PROGRAM FOR CANNABIS FUNDS CANNABIS FUNDS,
FOR BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES, WE HAD A HARD TIME GETTING KIOSKS
AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT, PUSHCARTS, FOR THE BUSINESSES IN
HARVARD SQUARE. HOW IT WILL WORK, I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD URGE YOU
TO THINK BIG. OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THIS. THE CANNABIS FUNDS ARE
AN INCREDIBLE RESOURCE. CAN WE USE THEM FOR UNIVERSAL PRE K,
WHICH REALLY WOULD BENEFIT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. IT IS ONE OF THE KEY
ISSUES IN THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY FUND REPORT ABOUT THAT
DIFFERENCE.
AND YES, TO PEOPLE WORKING REMOTELY AND PLEASE ALSO ASK THE CITY TO
DO AN ANALYSIS OF THIS. OTHERS ARE DOING IT. PAYMENT ON BOARD IS
COMPLICATED. I WOULD SAY THAT MANY OF US VOLUNTEER A LOT OF TIME
NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY OUTSIDE OF OUR WORK AND I URGE
YOU ALSO AND LOOK AT PEOPLE NOT TO TAKE THOSE WHO ARE YELLING AT
THE PUBLIC THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, ATTACKING THE BOARDS OR
ATTACKING PEOPLE WHO SPEAK. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU ARE DOING AND
HAVE A WONDERFUL VACATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: STEVEN ADELSON.
>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> I'M STEVEN. I'M THE OWNER OF TEDDY SHOES INCORPORATED. MY
FATHER STARTED THE BUSINESS IN 1957 AND I JOINED THE STORE IN 1978.
AND I'M VERY HONORED TO BE IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL TO PRESENT MY
VIEW ABOUT NUMBER 11 OR POLICY ORDER NUMBER 11. I THINK IT IS A
FABULOUS IDEA TO STOP THE MORATORIUM AND ALLOW RECREATIONAL
CANNABIS SALES TO TAKE PLACE IN CENTRAL SQUARES BECAUSE SO MANY
BUSINESSES, LIKE MYSELF, THEY HAD TO CLOSE AND HAD TREMENDOUS
HARDSHIP DURING THE LAST YEAR. AND WE NEED MORE BODIES, WE NEED
MORE PEOPLE, WE NEED MORE CUSTOMERS. I THINK IT IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SQUARE TO GET MORE CUSTOMERS AND MORES. AS
THE CITY COUNCIL, HOPEFULLY YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIFE
BLOOD OF THE BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS AND
THESE PEOPLE HAVE MONEY TO SPEND AND THEY WILL SUPPORT
MERCHANTS THAT ARE IN THE SQUARE. WE NEED AS MANY CUSTOMERS AS
WE CAN TO KEEP OUR BUSINESSES ALIVE.
IT IS REALLY VITAL THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS ORDINANCE AND ALLOW POLICY
ORDER 11 TO PASS. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SPEAK IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL. AS A NEIGHBOR OF THE REVOLUTIONARY
REVOLUTION CLINIC, I FEEL IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO EXPRESS
MY SINCERE GRATITUDE FOR THEM TO BE IN THE SQUARE, MAKE A BIG
PRESENCE IN THE SQUARE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY.
>> WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS LEE FARRIS.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME? GREAT. GOOD EVENING. I HOPE YOU WILL
CONSIDER RESIDENTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND VOTE FOR A
MODERATELY STRENGTHENED TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCE WHERE THE
CITY WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO ASSIST AFFORDABLE HOUSING
DEVELOPERS TO PROTECT TREES. THEY COOL BUILDINGS AND CLEAN AIR,
AND HELPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS PRESERVE TREES WILL
BENEFIT LOWER INCOME TENANTS IN THE BUILDINGS. SOME SAY THAT THE
AMENDMENT COULD LEAD TO THREATS OF LAWSUITS OVER THE GRANTING
OF PERMITS. HOWEVER, THE AMENDMENT SAID, WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE
LAW, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING
ORDINANCE, I DON'T SEE HOW IT WOULD BE THE BASIS OF A LAWSUIT. I
UNDERSTAND THE AMENDMENT AS SAYING SIMPLY THAT AFFORDABLE
HOUSING DEVELOPERS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERT ADVICE, AN
ADDITIONAL NON AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUNDS TO USE IT TO
PRESERVE TREE CANOPY. SECONDLY, I WANT TO SPEAK ON POLICY ORDER 10.
THE CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT ALLIANCE SUPPORTED A STRONGER CONDO
CONVERSION ORDINANCE. AND 2/3 OF RESIDENTS ARE RENTERS AND THEY
NEED MORE PROTECTION FROM CONDO CONVERSIONS THAT OFTEN
DISPLACE TENANTS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TENANT
PROTECTIONS THAT CAMBRIDGE CAN STRENGTHEN WITHOUT HAVING TO
ASK PERMISSION FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THIS AMENDMENT WOULD
INCREASE EXCUSE ME. THIS POLICY ORDER WILL INCREASE FAIRNESS AND
EQUITY IN OUR EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET. CAMBRIDGE SHOULD HAVE
ADOPTED A MORE ROBUST CONDO CONVERSION LAW YEARS AGO AND THIS
IS A CHANCE TO FINALLY MOVE FORWARD. PLEASE REFER IT TO THE
HOUSING COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FLAVIA?
>> HELLO. I LIKE TO THANK THE CITY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THE
INPUT TODAY AND I THANK THE COUNCILLORS FOR THE EFFORT IN CREATING
EQUITABLE CANNABIS LICENSING IMPLEMENTATION. CANNABIS IS
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST CAMBRIDGE IS CONSIDERED INFLUENTIAL
CITIES I APPRECIATE YOU HAVE THE (AUDIO BREAKUP). YOUR
COMMITMENT TONIGHT NOT TO BACK DOWN.
I WAS EXCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS. HAD I BEEN AWARE OF THE
ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT TWO WEEK SIGN UP WINDOW AND I DIDN'T
HAVE TO FIND A ZONE PROPERTY UNDER MY CONTROL TO QUALIFY, I WOULD
BE AN APPLICANT AS WELL. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED
THAT THE GROUP A, IT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT COULD BE GIVEN HOME DELIVERY
LICENSE OPPORTUNITIES, BUT THAT SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM RETAIL
LICENSE OPPORTUNITIES IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO SHARE THAT THE
SOCIAL EQUITY COMPANY, HAS BEEN RENTING A ZONE SPACE IN CAMBRIDGE
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE EXCLUSION PERIOD ENDING AND FURTHER
EXTENDING THE PERIOD BEFORE I CAN APPLY, A CANNABIS PERMIT BUSINESS
WOULD BE HARMFUL FINANCIALLY TO MY COMPANY AND FAMILY. I HAVE
BEEN WORKING HARD THROUGH COVID TO BE ABLE TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY

AND I WORK TOWARD THE APPROVAL FOR THIS SEPTEMBER. I SUPPORT THE
FUNDING FOR EE APPLICANTS AND SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS. THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE HAVE SASKIA VANN JAMES?
>> HELLO. I LIVE AT 251 GARDEN STREET. I'M THE LOBBYIST AND BOARD
MEMBER AT THE MASSACHUSETTS RECREATIONAL CONSUMER COUNCIL.
AND I SPOKE LAST WEEK ABOUT OUR POLICY ORDER 141 THAT IS PUT
FORWARD. AND I SENT A NICE LENGTHY EMAIL AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
SOME THINGS THAT I TOUCHED ON IN THE EMAIL THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A
CHANCE TO SPEAK LAST WEEK AND I SPEAK IN REGARD TO THIS WEEK. THIS
BILL BEING PROPOSED TO GO TO THE LOCALLY BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES
AND REPARATIONS TO GO TOWARD EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS. THE
REPARATIONS TOWARDS BLACK PEOPLE, THIS IS FALSE. I REPEAT THIS IS
FALSE. CAMBRIDGE DOESN'T PROPOSE REPARATIONS TOWARD BLACK
PEOPLE. IT IS TOWARDS CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESSES. NOT TOWARDS
PEOPLE. THAT'S FIRST. SECOND, CAMBRIDGE PROPOSE REPARATIONS
TOWARDS BUSINESSES THAT CAN BE OWNED BY ANYBODY, NOT JUST BLACK
PEOPLE. THEY CAN BE OWNED BY ANYBODY. YOU ARE CALLING IT
REPARATIONS, BUT THE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANT HAS MANY,
MANY WHITE PEOPLE. THERE'S ASIAN PEOPLE AND HISPANIC. SO MANY
PEOPLE. NOT PRIMARILY BLACK PEOPLE. NOR ONLY BLACK PEOPLE AND THE
CRITERIA INCLUDES THE YOU HAD TO LIVE IN A DISPROPORTIONATE AREA FOR
FIVE OUT OF THE PAST TEN YEARS. YOU COULD HAVE JUST HAD A POSITION
WHERE YOU SERVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS AND
LET ME CLARIFY, THE CRITERIA FOR THE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT WAS
DEVELOPED UNDER THE PRETENSE OF THE WAR ON DRUGS, NOT SLAVERY.
THESE ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT CRITERIAS BEING USED WITHIN ONE. I
DO FOR CANNABIS TAX REVENUE TO BE USED TOWARD REPARATIONS FOR
LOCAL OWNED BLACK BUSINESSES IN CAMBRIDGE IS WONDERFUL. AND A
SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SORRY, YOUR TIME IS UP. FEEL FREE TO
EMAIL US. LEAH?
>> LEA DANIELS HAS NOT JOINED. HEATHER HOFFMAN, YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR?
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
CHARTER CHANGE. IN THE FIRST PROPOSAL ABOUT APPROVING MEMBERS
OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, IT LEAVES OUT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE
COUNCIL NOT VOTING AT ALL. I HOPE YOU WILL ADDRESS THAT BEFORE YOU
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. WITH RESPECT TO A CONDO CONVERSION
ORDINANCE, PEOPLE SAID CAMBRIDGE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS AGES AGO.
SINCE CAMBRIDGE DIDN'T, NOW IS BETTER THAN WAITING YET LONGER.
PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEMSELVES HOMELESS BECAUSE OF CONDO
CONVERSION AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. WITH RESPECT TO CONDO
REPAIRS, I'M CONFUSED. I HOPE THERE WILL BE INFORMATION IN THE
DISCUSSION THAT EXPLAINS WHY THERE AREN'T BETTER WAYS TO GO ABOUT


PAGE 13

Jun 28, 2020

THIS. WITH RESPECT TO A STIPEND FOR MEMBERS OF MULTI MEMBER
BOARDS. THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY A
BUNCH OF NEIGHBORHOOD DEFENDERS, TO WHICH I SAY... REALLY? DO YOU
EVER ATTEND THEIR MEETINGS? AND ON THE TREE ORDINANCE, I DO HOPE
YOU WILL NOT EXCLUDE PEOPLE LIVING IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. WHAT DO
WE OWE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN PUBLIC HOUSING AND IN PLACES
LIKE THAT? WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM THOSE PEOPLE THEMSELVES IS THEY
THINK THEY DESERVE TREES AND NICE THINGS. I AGREE WITH THEM. I HOPE
THE COUNCIL WILL AGREE AS WELL. THANK YOU.

REOPEN PUBLIC COMMENT FOR 15 MINUTES.

MAKE A MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES? DO WE NOT HAVE TO SUSPEND
THE RULES TO INTERRUPT PUBLIC COMMENT, WHICH IS A PROCESS, OPPOSED
TO WAITING IT OVER. IN ANY CASE, I THINK WE HAVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES
AND THEN TAKE THE VOTE TO EXTEND. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO HAVE A
MOTION TO SUSPEND AND THEN TAKE THE VOTE TO EXTEND.

COMMENTS FOR 15 MINUTES. THAT'S ONE VOTE.

PEOPLE WERE NOT ABLE TO SIGN UP BEFORE 6:00.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> I LIVE AT 86 OTIS STREET, PUTNAM SCHOOL APARTMENTS IN EAST
CAMBRIDGE. ELDERLY/DISABLED PROPERTY. AND I'M SPEAKING STRONGLY
IN FAVOR OF COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S PROPOSE THE AMENDMENT TO THE
TREE ORDINANCE TO PROVIDE AN AVENUE OF GUIDANCE AND FINANCIAL
SUPPORT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. I THINK IT IS CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT. I HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN MORE THAN ONCE AT ZONING
BOARD HEARINGS, EVEN RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TREES. AND WAS
MISLED WHEN I LIVED AT AN APARTMENT, AS WAS THE PUBLIC WITH REGARD
TO A TREE THAT THE PLANS SHOWED HAD TO BE REMOVED AND YET THEY
WERE SAYING NO TREES WOULD BE REMOVED. THAT TREE COULD HAVE
BEEN IF THEY HAD BEEN HONEST COULD HAVE BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER
SITE ON THE PROPERTY. THIS HAPPENED AGAIN WHERE I HAVE BEEN MOVED
AS A RESULT OF RELOCATION TO PUTNAM SCHOOL APARTMENTS. A TREE
THAT IS THE HEIGHT, REACHES THE HEIGHT OF THE SECOND FLOOR
WINDOWS, IT IS ALL WINDOWS, IT IS GOING TO BE REMOVED. I THINK IT IS
HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT WITH SOME GUIDANCE AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVE,
THAT TREE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED. THERE'S ONLY THREE TREES ON THAT
PROPERTY. AND NOW ONE OF THEM, THE SECOND BIGGEST, IS GOING. I
WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT CHANGES TO THE CONDO
ORDINANCE. I GUESS MY TIME IS UP. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AHMED?
>> HELLO. I'M HEARING A LOT OF OPPOSITION ABOUT THE MORATORIUM.
IT BAFFLES PEOPLE. PEOPLE FORGET, THE REASON FOR THE MORATORIUM,
TO GIVE DAVID A FAIR CHANCE AGAINST GOLIATH. COVID AFFECTED BOTH
THE SAME. THE CANNABIS LUCKILY, THE PRECEDENT WAS SET THAT IT WAS
DEEMED AS AN ESSENTIAL BUSINESS. REALLY GOLIATH HAS NOT BEEN
AFFECTED AS A BUSINESS WHO HAS NEVER OPENED ITS DOOR. AT THE TIME
OF THE INCEPTION OF THE MORATORIUM, A YEAR WAS LOST TO COVID. I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE JUST COMPLETELY BRAZEN OVER
THAT FACT. WE LOST A WHOLE YEAR. THE MORATORIUM WAS FOR TWO
YEARS. WE DIDN'T WANT THE MORATORIUM LONGER THAN THAT. WE
WANT TO OPEN THE BUSINESS AND GET GOING. THE MORATORIUM WAS
FOR TWO YEARS AND IN THAT TWO YEARS, COVID WAS FOR ONE. A LITTLE
LONGER, BUT DEFINITELY FOR A YEAR. SIMPLE MATHEMATICS. WE LOST A


PAGE 15

Jun 28, 2020

YEAR TO COVID. THE RIGHT THING TO DO WOULD BE TO AT LEAST GIVE US
ANOTHER YEAR. I DON'T KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND. I
UNDERSTAND WHY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF FOOT
TRAFFIC IN THE SQUARE NOW, ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE FOOT
TRAFFIC WHEN IT WAS IN BENEFIT OF EQUITY APPLICANTS AND SOCIAL
EQUITY APPLICANT AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS. I MEAN...
I'M TRYING TO GRASP THIS. I KNOW THERE ARE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN THE
ROOM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. GRANT ELLIS?
>> HELLO, MADAM MAYOR. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. I'M A DISABLED
MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS
CANNABIS REFORM COALITION, THE OLDEST NONPROFIT IN THE
COMMONWEALTH. I WILL MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR, THIS IS NOT A
MORATORIUM ON CANNABIS BUSINESS OPENING. THIS IS ON NON EQUITY
OWNED CANNABIS BUSINESSES THE FACT THIS IS PRESENTED IN BAD FACT, A
UNILATERAL MORATORIUM ON ADULT USE BUSINESSES, DEMONSTRATES THE
INSIDIOUS TACTICS THAT HAVE NO PLACE IN A PUBLIC POLICY DEBATE.
THERE IS NO REASON TO TIE THE EQUITY PRIORITY PERIOD, WHICH IT IS,
CONTINUING TO FUNDING FOR EQUITY COMPANIES. WE SHOULD FUND THE
EQUITY COMPANIES WHETHER OR NOT THE PRIORITY PERIOD CONTINUES.
WE SHOULDN'T USE PUBLIC POLICY TO LET CORPORATE MEDICAL DISPENSARY
BUY THEIR WAY INTO THE THIRD YEAR. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M HEARING,
SOCIAL EQUITY COMPANIES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE
PERIOD. AND I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR, WHEN CLINICS SUED THE
CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, THEY SAID THEIR MOTIVES IN THE LAWSUIT, IN THE
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THEY SAID, IN SEPTEMBER OF 2019,
DEFENDANTS ENACTED THE RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY ORDINANCE THAT
STRIPPED THEM OF THE STATUTORY RIGHT TO CONVERT. THEY LOST ON
THAT IS POINT. ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. TWICE IN FRONT OF THE
APPEALS COURT, ONCE IN FRONT OF THE DISTRICT COURT. AND THEY SAID
THE PRIORITY PERIOD IS RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST WHITE
BUSINESS OWNERS. THAT DISGUSTS ME AND PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE MONEY
TO LET THEM BUY THEIR WAY INTO THE PRIORITY PERIOD, IT WILL DISGUST
ME. PLEASE VOTE IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDER 11. AND PLEASE EXTEND THE
PERIOD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JUSTIN SAIF.
>> HI, 259 HURLEY STREET. I WILL SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE CONDO
CONVERSION ORDINANCE. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. THE ORDINANCE WAS IN
PLACE IN YEARS PAST, PRIOR THE ONGOING AND INCREASE IN HOUSING COST,
DUE TO INADEQUATE SUPPLY AND ALONGSIDE THE CONDO OF CAMBRIDGE
APARTMENTS, IT WILL HELP STOP THE IMPACT ON MANY TENANTS WHO MAY
BE DISPLACED FROM CAMBRIDGE AS A RESULT OF THE CONVERSION. I WANT
TO QUESTION THE THINKING BEHIND THE CREATION OF THE REVIEW BOARD
AND THE DRAFT. IT SEEMS THE CITY CAN HANDLE THE ISSUANCE OF
CONVERSION I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY PARTICULAR REASONS FOR HAVING
THE CITY PLAY THAT AND THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC. I DON'T SEE THE


PAGE 16

Jun 28, 2020

NEED TO CREATE ANOTHER BOARD, EVEN IF THE COUNCIL CONFIRMS
APPOINTEES. POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT CHALLENGES THAT MAY RISE
IN CAMBRIDGE AS INCLUDED IN THE DRAFT ORDINANCE. BEST PRACTICE
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY IS FEWER BOARDS AND NOT
BOARD AND HAVING THE COUNCIL PLAY A ROLE IN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CITY
OPERATIONS. THE CITY COUNCIL IS MORE AWARE AND RESPONSIVE TO
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THAN ANY OF THE LOCAL BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS.
CITIZENS CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO MONITOR THE MANY BOARDS AND
COMMISSIONS IN CAMBRIDGE, EVEN IF THE SELECTION PROCESS IS
ARGUABLY IMPROVED. THE ROLE OF THE REVIEW BOARD DOESN'T SEEM TO
INVOLVE ANY EXERTION OF DISCRETION, WHICH IS THE REASON WHY YOU
CREATE A BOARD, EXCEPT WITH REGARD WITH ITS OWN RULES, POLICIES,
AND PROCEDURES. I DON'T THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DELEGATE POWER
TO SET ITS OWN RULES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES TO THE BOARD. IT
SEEMS QUESTIONABLE THAT THE BOARD WILL BE QUALIFIED FOR SUCH
WORK, GIVEN THE COUNCIL OFTEN STRUGGLES WITH SIMILAR ISSUES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO KEITH COOPER.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, I
HEAR THE ANGER IN SOME OF THE EMOTION WE HEARD TWO YEARS AGO. I
WILL APOLOGIZE FOR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A LAWSUIT WE
FILED AGAINST CAMBRIDGE. FOR BEING BLINDLY INSENSITIVE TO THE
MESSAGE THAT IT SENT TO THE COMMUNITIES, TO THE COUNCIL, TO EQUITY
APPLICANTS AND TO MANY MINORITY EMPLOYEES. AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT
WE MADE A RATIONAL BUSINESS DECISION TO LET COURT WEIGH IN ON
WHETHER RIGHTS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY. I DIDN'T APPRECIATE MY ROLE IN
AMPLIFYING DIVISIONS IN THE COMMUNITY, NOT UNDERSTANDING THE
LONG HISTORY OF RACIAL INEQUITIES AND HOW PEOPLE FEEL AND
EXPERIENCE THAT TODAY.
FRANKLY, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT UNTIL WITNESSING THE RECKONING RACIAL
INEQUALITIES THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THE WORLD OVER OVER THE PAST
TWO YEARS. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT OUR PART IN THE HISTORY REALLY
MATTERS. AND IT MATTERS RIGHT NOW. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN
TOGETHER FOCUS OUR ATTENTION AND ENERGY, WHICH ALWAYS SHOULD BE
AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE
COMMUNITY AND ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
LICENSEES, AS WELL AS HOW CAMBRIDGE CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD ON ISSUES
OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE ARE LISTENING AND LEARNING. WE DROPPED THE
LAWSUIT WHEN WE REALIZE THE ACTION DIDN'T HELP PEOPLE MOVE
FORWARD. IT WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE FOCUSSED
ATTENTION AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES OVER THE TWO YEARS IN HELPING
EQUITY LICENSEES AND OTHER CITIES GET OPEN AND TO THRIVE AND WE
KNOW THAT CAN WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN IT.
I AND REV WE KNOW THE APOLOGY IS ANOTHER STEP IN THE COURSE OF
CORRECTION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP THAT WE CAN TAKE TODAY. MY
DOOR IS OPEN FOR A CONVERSATION. AND INPUT AS I'M HERE TO LEARN

PAGE 17

Jun 28, 2020

HOW TO BE A BETTER PARTNER, PARTICIPANT, AND ALLY IN THE PROCESS.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> HELLO. I RESIDE 20 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. AND WHEN THE CITY HAS
FUNDING TO GIVE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, I STILL
THINK THAT ERADICATING HOMELESSNESS SHOULD BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST OF BENEFICIARIES. YEARS BACK, THEN MAYOR, TRY
TO FIND BLACK BUSINESS PEOPLE HERE IN CAMBRIDGE TO WORK WITH. HE
COULDN'T FIND ANY. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY ARE EVERYWHERE TO BE
FOUND. THE CITY WON'T EVEN CONSIDER GRANTING FREE FISHING LICENSE
TO THE HOMELESS AND SENIOR CITIZEN POPULATION, BUT CAN CONSIDER
PURSUING REPARATIONS FOR A QUESTIONABLE BLACK BUSINESS
COMMUNITY.
ENDING AND ERADICATING HOMELESSNESS SHOULD BE THE TOP PRIORITY,
OBJECTIVE AND GOAL. THIS APPLIES TO THE TREASURY RECENTLY
ACQUIRED TREASURY FUNDING OF $65 MILLION. WHEN YOU CONSIDER
WHAT YOU CONSIDER HERE IS IN THIS AGENDA ITEM, IT IS EQUAL TO CHERRY
PICKING TO SEE WHO GETS REPARATION. I STILL SAY THAT A HOMELESS
TRUST FUND IS NEEDED HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. HOW CAN ANY DECENT AND
HONEST BLACK BUSINESS PERSON TO ACCEPT SUCH PUBLIC FUNDING WHEN
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, ARE LIVING AND SLEEPING ON THE
MAIN AND SIDE STREETS OF CAMBRIDGE ON ITS BRICKS AND PAVEMENT
SIDEWALKS. OKAY, FINALLY. HAVE YOU ALL FORGOTTEN THE
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TEN YEAR PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS
AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE 2015 HOMELESSNESS. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE TABA MOSES.
>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME? SCHOOL STREET. GREW UP IN THE PORT
AND HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS UNFOLD FOR A WHILE. IT IS INTERESTING
TO HEAR KEITH COOPER, CEO OF REV CLINIC ATTEMPT TO APOLOGIZE, I WAS
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND I WATCHED HIM GO TO THE SJC, THE HIGHEST
COURT, IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY TO GET THEIR AND WE SAID WE'D
INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY. SOMETIMES IT IS TOO LATE TO
APOLOGIZE AND IT IS ABOUT CREATING A SYSTEMIC CHANGE, MAYBE HE
CAN'T BE INVOLVED IN BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN YOU KEEP IT TO NO PERSONALITIES. ADDRESS
COMMENTS TO ME.
>> ALL RIGHT. SO, IF WE TALK ABOUT THE MORATORIUM, I WILL BREAK
DOWN HARVARD SQUARE, WOULD NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
REAL ESTATE. CHAUNSY, EAST CAMBRIDGE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP A
RETAIL IN EAST CAMBRIDGE, HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF REVOLUTIONARY CLINICS, ARE GIVEN
TIME TO MOVE FORWARD. GSO, WE HANDED IN THE HCA, WE WAIT TO GET
IT BACK. AND WE ARE GETTING FUNDED BY CHRIS WEBER, THE SOCIAL
IMPACT FUND AND I WORK WITH CHRIS TO HELP OTHER GROUPS SO THEY

PAGE 18

Jun 28, 2020

CAN GET FUNDED. CREATE REALLY PARTNERSHIPS THAT REPRESENT TRUE
EQUITY AND REALLY REPRESENT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE IN TERMS
OF HAVING AN EQUITABLE CANNABIS BUSINESS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND IN
THE COUNTRY THAT WILL GIVE BACK TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT MOST.
I THINK YOU CAN STAND HERE TODAY AND SAY THAT THERE'S PEOPLE'S LIVES
WHO WILL GET CHANGED, BUSINESSES THAT WILL OPEN BECAUSE OF THE
STANCE YOU TOOK, MADAM MAYOR, THE STANCE YOU TOOK AND THE
STANCE EVERYBODY WHO VOTED FOR THE MORATORIUM TOOK IN
CAMBRIDGE, IT IS HELPING INDIVIDUALS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. SORRY, THE TIME IS
UP. DAMOND.
>> THEY HAVE NOT JOINED. DANNY, YOU WERE JUST IN THE ROOM. IF YOU
CAN RETURN.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU A
PROGRAM FROM MY FOUNDATION, THE SUNSHINE OF THE AMERICAS
FOUNDATION
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE TO SPEAK TO ITEMS ON THE
AGENDA. IF IT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA, I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FOUNDATION. YOU CAN SUBMIT SOMETHING IN
THE FUTURE AND WE CAN MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO IT.
>> IS IT POSSIBLE TO ASK FOR A VOTE TO PROCEED? IT WILL BE TWO
MINUTES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PER THE RULES, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO
ITEMS ON THE AGENDA.
>> THANK YOU ANYWAY.
>> SORRY, DANNY. GO AHEAD CHAUNCY?
>> PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I WANT TO
SPEAK ABOUT THAT'S A LOT ALREADY SAID WITH REGARDS TO THE
MORATORIUM. AND I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SOME
SUGGESTIONS, INCLUDING SOCIAL EQUITY... (AUDIO BREAKUP).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ARE YOU THERE? IT CUT OUT? WE CAN COME BACK?
>> HE IS STILL ON AND UNMUTED. MAYBE HAVING TECHNICAL ISSUES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU. WE'LL GO TO
RICHARD HARDING.
>> HELLO?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HELLO? RICHARD?
>> HI. GOOD EVENING. I WANT TO STEP IN AND SPEAK ABOUT THREE
PARTICULAR THINGS. THIS IS ON THE CANNABIS ORDINANCE. SOMEONE SAID
IT EARLIER, I THINK CONFLATING THE TWO ISSUES. GRANT ELLIS AROUND


PAGE 19

Jun 28, 2020

CANNABIS IS NOT ACCURATE FACTS AROUND THIS MATTER. I WOULD SAY
THREE THINGS. NOT ONE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT GROUP THAT WAS
WITH US WHEN THE MORATORIUM STARTED HAS AREN'T MOVED FORWARD
IN THE RIGHT WAY. THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY
RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IN CENTRAL SQUARE SOON. MOSTLY BY THE EE
WHO ARE AFFORDED THE PRIORITY PERIOD. SECONDLY, WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS IN THE TIME OF COVID. THERE REALLY WAS NO
MORATORIUM. BE FAIR AND TALK ABOUT MY COMPANY. WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN LINE, WE HAD A MEETING ON MARCH 2 OR 3, COVID
STOPPED EVERYTHING, WE HAD TO ZOOM IN AUGUST. AT THE END OF THE
DAY, IF YOU ARE TRUE TO THE IDEALS OF THE INITIAL moratorium, IT WOULD
CALL FOR ONE YEAR, EVENT TWO. THE NOTION THAT OTHER BUSINESSES ARE
BEING HELD UP, IF THE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AMENDMENTS, WHICH
HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY GROUPS AND PEOPLE WHO WIN THAT PROGRAM
THROUGH THE STATE CERTIFIED PROGRAM, THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN AN
ALREADY LANDMARK DECISION BY THE CITY COUNCIL, AFFIRMED BY THE
COURTS IN THE STATE, THAT A MORATORIUM AS SUGGESTED BY THE CCC IS
THE RIGHT THING. UP FOR A FIGHT, NOT LOOKING FOR IT. AT THE END OF
THE DAY, WE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS AS WE WERE MANY MONTHS
AGO. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A DEBATE ABOUT HOW WE CAN
STRENGTHEN THIS. LASTLY, I WILL SAY, WE NEED TO HAVE AN AUTOPSY ON
THE CANNABIS PROCESS TO REALLY FIX THIS MOVING FORWARD AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO THIS VERY DEBATE. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP CAN WE GO BACK TO CHAUNSY? WE CAN
GO TO ANN CHARLOTTE? IF SHE IS ON THE ZOOM. WHATEVER YOU THINK IS
BEST, NAOMI.
>> CHAUNSY, YOU ARE UNMUTED. YOU HAVE TO UNMUTE ON YOUR END.
GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I APOLOGIZE. AND SO, I WANT TO BRIEFLY
SPEAK ABOUT THE SOCIAL EQUITY ADDITION TO THE PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE
PART OF THE POTENTIAL MORATORIUM.
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME TYPE OF MISUNDERSTANDING
ABOUT WHAT THIS IS COMPOSED OF. SOME PEOPLE TRY TO LOOK AT AS
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC AND IT IS FAR FROM THAT. AND INCOME
REQUIREMENTS TO GET INTO THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM GOES AS HIGH
AS $300,000 PER INDIVIDUAL. AND THE NET WORTH OF PEOPLE IN THE
BLACK PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR IN THE BOSTON AND CAMBRIDGE AREA, IT IS
ABOUT $8. TO MAKE A PROGRAM THAT HAS INCOME LIMIT AS HIGH AS
$300,000, IT IS JUST NOT INTENTIONAL. NOT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS. WHAT I WANT TO ENSURE
THAT THE COUNCIL WILL FOCUS ON THOSE ISSUES AND TRY TO BE IN SOME
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE
SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM THAT ARE WELL POSITIONED AND NOT
PARTICULARLY BLACK OR BROWN. ANY ORDINANCE THAT PASS NEEDS TO BE
FOCUSSED ON THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH THE SOCIAL EQUITY
PROGRAM. ANYONE TRYING IN THE CAMBRIDGE AREA SHOULD BE FOCUS ON


PAGE 20

Jun 28, 2020

THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, WE HAVE
ANN CHARLOTTE?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE
CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL AND MADAM MAYOR. AGASSIZ IS FAR FROM
BEING ALONE AS A WHITE SUPREMACIST, HAVING A BUILDING, STREET,
BRIDGE OR IN THIS CASE, A NEIGHBORHOOD NAMED AFTER HIM. HIS WORK
ON RACE WAS USED TO JUSTIFY OPPRESSION BY POLICY MAKERS AND THIS
PART OF THE LEGACY LIVES ON. SADLY.
AS A TEACHER AT LESLEY UNIVERSITY, STUDENTS NEW TO THE AREA WILL ASK
ME WHO THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS NAMED AFTER. AND MY JOB AS A REAL
ESTATE, THE SAME QUESTION COMES UP. IT IS EMBARRASSING WE HONOR
SOMEONE LIKE AGASSIZ BY HAVING A NEIGHBORHOOD NAMED AFTER HIM.
MS. BALDWIN IT IS LONG OVERDUE THIS NAME CHANGE HAPPENS. IT
SHOULD BE AN EASY DECISION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE WE MISSED ON THE ZOOM?
>> WE HAVE LOREN.
>> THANK YOU. EIGHT MUSEUM WAY AND I WILL SPEAK ON POLICY ORDER
EIGHT. I'M FOR PAYING MEMBERS OF CITY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS
STAFFED BY VOLUNTEERS. RELYING ON VOLUNTEERS TO DO THIS WORK IS
LED TO MANY OF THE MORE MYOPIC DECISIONS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE
PLANNING BOARD, BZA AND THE HISTORIC COMMISSION. WE MAY
SHORTCUT THIS BY LOOKING BACK AT THE UNPAID INTERNSHIPS. WHEN YOU
DON'T PAY FOR WORK, THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO THE
WORK ARE THE ALREADY WEALTHY, PRIVILEGED THAT WORK FOR FREE. I
SUPPORT THE ORDER, I MAKE TWO SUGGESTIONS. FIRST, I RECOMMEND
ADDING THE WORDS OR SALARY NEXT TO THE WORD STIPEND. IT IMPLIES
SMALL PAYMENTS OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR INCIDENTAL EXPENSES. FEW
CAN WORK FOR THE AIM TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED OR ADVERTISED AS STIPENDS
AND ARE THERE ARE SOME BOARDS THAT MIRROR THE WORK OF A PART
TIME JOB. THIS SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE A JOB AND IN THIS CASE THE CITY
AND SHOULD BE COMPENSATED. A POINT OF CAUTION, WE SHOULD PAY
MEMBERS FOR THE WORK, AND RECOGNIZE DOING SO MAY LEAD TO
INCREASE RELIANCE ON PROFESSIONAL CREDENTIALS. THERE ARE BOARDS
THAT DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURE, ZONING, AND
PERMITS, THAT WILL TOUCH EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE, HOUSELESSNESS,
TRANSIT, SCHOOL SELECTION AND MORE. THE MEGA BOARDS, THEY ARE
CURRENTLY STAFFED ENTIRELY WITH SIMILARLY WELL EDUCATED TECHNICAL
PROFESSIONALS, CREDENTIALED AND PLANNING ARCHITECTURE, THE LAW
AND HISTORY, AND SUITED TO MAKE DECISIONS THROUGH THE LENSES, BUT
SOMETIMES BLIND TO THE IMPACT OF THE DECISIONS BEYOND THE
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND LIVED EXPERIENCES. WE NEED TECHNICAL
SKILLS ON BOARD.

EMAIL US. SOMEONE NAMED KATE FRANK ON THE ZOOM? THOMAS FRANK?

THEY ARE UNABLE TO UNMUTE ON THEIR END.

>> I APOLOGIZE IF IT IS ON MY END. I'M A KLUTZ ON MY END WITH DIGITAL
MATTERS. 53 CRESCENT STREET AND A MEMBER OF THE AGASSIZ
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL SINCE THE 1970S. MY FIRST 20 YEARS, I HAD A
APARTMENTS IN MANY DIFFERENT CAMBRIDGE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHEN I
MARRIED MY HUSBAND WAS RENTING IN THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD. I
WAS THROWN INTO A COMBINATION OF WORK AND FAMILY LIFE AND HAD
NO AWARENESS OF THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AGASSIZ SCIENTIFIC
WORK OR MISGUIDED PROPOSITIONS AND THEORIES CONSIDERING THE
SUPERIORITY OF PEOPLE. AND WHEN I KNEW LITTLE ABOUT HIS
BACKGROUND AND WRITING, MY NEW NEIGHBORHOOD NAME HELD NO
SIGNIFICANCE FOR ME.
HOWEVER, ONCE MADE AWARE, IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TAKE STEPS
TO JOIN OTHER WITH SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT HIS IMPACT ON THE
POLITICAL PRACTICES OF THE LOCAL ON LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS. FROM CITY GOVERNMENT TO SCHOOLS TO THE ZONING
PRACTICES THAT KEPT SYSTEMIC RACISM AND SEGREGATION IN PLACE. I'M
GRATEFUL TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO BY ASKING THE AGASSIZ
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL TO CONSIDER REPLACING THE NAME WITH THAT
OF MARIA BALDWIN, THE REQUEST WAS A CATALYST FOR ME AND OTHER
RESIDENTS OF CAUCASIAN BACKGROUND TO BECOME AWARE OF THE
PAINFULNESS OF THE IMPACT OF HIS WORK AND OF OUR DRIFTING ALONG
WITH THE AGASSIZ NAME. WE ARE SENSITIZED TO WHAT IT HAD TO DO WITH
EXPOSING SYSTEMIC RACISM. I CAME TO SEE THE CONNECTION

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: NUMBER 5.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OTHERS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: 6.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE, YOU PULLED 8? WE'LL PUT
EIGHT SINCE WE HAVE TO DO A FEW THINGS. WE HAVE PULLED 4, 5, 6, AND
WE'LL PULL 8. AND HEARING NO OTHER, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON CITY
MANAGER AGENDA ITEMS 1, 2, 3, 7.

COMMUNICATION (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 4).
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER
ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE A FEW THINGS WE WANT TO GO OVER. I WILL
EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. THE CHARTER RIGHT IS EXERCISED ON ITEM 4.
WE'LL MOVE TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 5. (READING CITY MANAGER'S
ITEM NUMBER 5).
COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS A REPORT THAT THE COUNCIL
REQUESTED ON THE MOSQUITO MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. I VERY MUCH
APPRECIATE THE REPORT AND I'M GLAD TO SEE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING
WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE WE ARE NOT USING SUBSTANCES THAT ARE
VIEWED AS A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH. MY COMMENT IS GOING TO BE
THIS NEEDS TO BE PROPAGATED AND ON THE WEBSITE. WHEN YOU LOOK, IT
IS NOT THERE. IF I LOOK UP TO SAY WHAT IS CAMBRIDGE DOING, I
WOULDN'T FIND THIS. I THINK THIS WILL ALLAY SOME CONCERNS. OF
COURSE, ALL OF US DON'T WANT TO EVER USE THE TRUCKS AND SPRAYING.
WE GOT A REPORT THAT TRIPLE E IS IN MASSACHUSETTS. I'M GRATEFUL THE
CITY IS PART OF THE TASK FORCE IT IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO ENSURE
WE DON'T USE THE PESTICIDES THAT COULD CAUSE LONG TERM DAMAGE. I
THINK WE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT CAREFULLY AND WHEN I LOOKED
BEFORE, IT IS NOT ON THERE. LET'S MAKE SURE IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE.
THAT'S MY COMMENT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE OTHER COMMENTS FROM COUNCILLORS.
ROLL CALL ON PLACING THIS ITEM ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

REPORT BACK. THIS IS CAME FORWARD IN RESPONSE TO SOMETHING THAT
CAME UP AT THE SENIOR ADVISORY. A NUMBER OF SENIORS ARE

NOT BEING PROPERLY COVERED. I KNOW THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS BEEN

Motion to Suspend the Rules to
bring forward Calendar #7

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE CALENDAR ITEM SEVEN IS BEFORE US. PLEASURE
OF THE CITY COUNCIL? QUESTIONS? A MOTION TO AMEND CALENDAR ITEM
7 WITH THE LANGUAGE IN CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM EIGHT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WANT TO CLARIFY, THE AMENDMENT AS I
UNDERSTAND, IT HAS A COUPLE OF CHANGES IN THE BLUE LINE OR RED LINE
VERSION, IT HAS TO DO WITH THE RE TAIL PROMINENCE OF ANY DELIVERY
BUSINESS. A COUPLE OF CHANGES. WE INCLUDE THEM IN THE ONE THAT WE
PASS AND MOVE THAT TO ORDINATION. IS THAT CORRECT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MR. ROBERTS?
>> I HAD DIFFICULT TIME HEARING THAT BECAUSE OF THE FAN OVER HERE.
A QUESTION REGARDING THE LANGUAGE THAT THE STAFF PROVIDED. THIS
IS LANGUAGE THAT INCORPORATES COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE
PLANNING BOARD AND THE RECOMMENDATION. MOST OF THEM ARE
CLARIFYING COMMENTS. WE ALSO INCLUDED SOME LANGUAGE IN THE
CRITERIA FOR SPECIAL PERMIT THAT PERTAINS TO THE ISSUE OF GROUND
FLOOR ACTIVATION. THAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
HEARING AS WELL. AND TO CLARIFY THE RECORD FROM THE LAST
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE HEARING, THERE ARE NO PROPOSED BUFFER
REQUIREMENTS FOR A CANNABIS DELIVERY ESTABLISHMENT.


PAGE 24

Jun 28, 2020

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. IF NO ONE HAS QUESTIONS, I WOULD
BE TOTALLY EXCITED TO PROPOSE THE AMENDMENTS BE INCORPORATED.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I DON'T HAVE MY NOTES AND I APOLOGIZE. WE
HAVE THE SAME RESTRICTION IN TERMS OF THE WAITING PERIOD RELATED
TO CANNABIS DELIVERY I APOLOGIZE, I DON'T HAVE THE NOTES. I WOULD
WANT THAT TO BE IN THE STIPULATION BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT AMAZON
GETTING INTO THE CANNABIS DELIVERY AND CURRIER BUSINESS AND
BEATING OUT OUR BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESS OWNERS. I'M CURIOUS IF
SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME.
>> THANK YOU. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THAT. PART OF THAT PERTAINS TO
IT IS SEPARATE FROM THE ZONING ORDINANCE. IN THE STATE REGULATIONS
FOR CANNABIS DELIVERY ESTABLISHMENTS, THERE IS A THREE YEAR GRACE
PERIOD OR PERIOD FOR ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS. I DON'T
KNOW MUCH OF THE DETAIL OF THAT. THAT'S THE CASE. IF CAMBRIDGE
WERE TO TAKE ACTION SIMILAR TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE CASE FOR
OTHER TYPES OF CANNABIS ESTABLISHMENTS, THAT WOULD BE A SEPARATE
ORDINANCE. THE CANNABIS BUSINESS PERMITTING ORDINANCE. THIS IS
JUST THE ZONING.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. MAYBE IT IS SOMETHING TO BRING
UP LATER ON OR HAVE THE DISCUSSION IN THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE ON
A MORATORIUM, SOMETHING TO BRING UP AT THE TIME. THANK YOU. I
YIELD.

Jun 28, 2020

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT SAYS WE PASSED TO A SECOND READING ON JUNE 14
AND CAN BE ORDAINED TONIGHT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DID WANT TO BRIEFLY RESPOND
TO MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION ABOUT A PREFERENCE PERIOD. THE MAYOR
AND I MET WITH SOLICITOR GLOWA THIS MORNING AND WORKING ON
LANGUAGE TO UPDATE THE CANNABIS BUSINESS PERMITTING PROCESS. WE
HAVE AN ITEM LATER TO CALL FOR A HEARING TO DISCUSS THAT. WE'LL
CONSIDER IT A PREFERENCE PERIOD FOR DELIVERY OPERATORS AT THAT TIME
AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NO OTHER HANDS UP AND NO TESTIMONY
FROM THE COUNCIL, ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO ORDAIN

CHARTER RIGHT ITEMS. WE'LL GO THROUGH EACH. FIRST ONE IS REGARDING
AN ITEM FROM LAST WEEK CITY MANAGER ITEM AROUND THE
APPROPRIATION FOR $65 MILLION PLUGS REGARDING THE AMERICAN
RESCUE PLAN ACT. THIS WAS CHARTER RIGHT EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
#8
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to
recommendation from the
Planning Board and
communication from
Community Development
Department and Law
Department staff related to the
Cannabis Delivery Zoning
Petition.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DID HAVE A BRIEF
COMMUNICATION MR. KALE, BUT WE DIDN'T GET AN UPDATE YET ON THIS
APPROPRIATION. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE CITY MANAGER AND
MR. KALE IF ANYTHING CHANGED FROM LAST WEEK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER?
>> CITY MANAGER: WE GAVE AN UPDATE IN THE WEEKLY DIGEST, BUT WE


PAGE 26

Jun 28, 2020

ARE PREPARED TO GET INTO DETAIL TONIGHT. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO DAVID
AND MICHELLE FOR THE SPECIFICS. THANK YOU.
>> DAVID: AS WE NOTED
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: CAN YOU ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE SPEAKING TO SPEAK
VERY CLOSE TO THE MICROPHONE WITH THE FANS IT IS DIFFICULT TO HAND.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN YOU GET REALLY CLOSE? THANK YOU.
>> DAVID: AS WE NOTED IN THE WEEKLY DIGEST ON FRIDAY THAT WAS SENT
TO THE CITY COUNCIL, WE DID DO SOME RESEARCH AND BASICALLY WHAT
AS WE PROMISED LAST WEEK, AND BASICALLY BASED UPON FEDERAL AND
STATE GUIDELINES BASICALLY, THE GRANT NEEDS TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE
ENTIRETY. AND THERE'S NO OTHER MECHANISMS TO DO THAT. AND IT CAN'T
BE PUT INTO A FREE CASH ACCOUNT, IT CAN'T BE SEGREGATED. THIS GRANT
IS A FEDERAL GRANT AND NEEDS TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE ENTIRETY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. WE HEARD THAT BOSTON AND
SOMERVILLE ARE DOING SOME DIFFERENT PROCESSES. ARE YOU AWARE OF
THAT AND CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT?
>> MR. KALE: IT IS A PROCESS TO UTILIZE THE FUNDS, I'M NOT DIRECTLY
INVOLVED. IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, THEY WOULD
HAVE FOLLOWED THE SAME GUIDELINES THAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW IN
TERMS OF ACCEPTING THE FEDERAL FUNDS. THE PROCESS OF HOW THE
FUNDS ARE EXPENDED AND WHAT INPUT ONE GETS IS UP TO EACH
COMMUNITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN WE GO TO VICE
MAYOR MALLON. AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE
SAYING, THAT DOESN'T PREVENT US FROM HAVING A PROCESS WHERE WE
WOULD STILL HAVE THE COUNCIL VOTE ON FURTHER APPROPRIATIONS OF
THE FUNDS. RIGHT?
>> CITY MANAGER: THIS IS A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION. YOU HAVE TO
APPROPRIATE THE $65 MILLION. THAT IS THE RULING WE GOT. WE ARE
PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE TWO FINANCE CHAIRS
AND AFTER LISTENING THE COUNCIL LAST WEEK, HAVE SET UP FINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING TO START DISCUSSING HOW WE'LL SPEND THE MONEY.
IT IS A ONE TIME DOLLAR AMOUNT APPROPRIATION. AGAIN, SOMERVILLE
AND BOSTON, THEY ARE A FORM OF GOVERNMENT, WHAT THEY DO DOESN'T
TRANSLATE TO WHAT WE DO. OUR FORMAT, THIS IS AN APPROPRIATION AND
WE'LL START THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT,
WHICH WE KNOW IS A CONCERN OF THE COUNCIL, AND RIGHTFULLY SO. WE
HAVE WORKED WITH THE TWO CHAIRS TO START THE DISCUSSION. MR. KALE
CAN TELL YOU WHEN THE FIRST MEETING IS PROBABLY. THAT IS THE
PROCESS WE RECOMMEND AND WORK ON.


PAGE 27

Jun 28, 2020

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WILL YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON AND THEN COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I
UNDERSTAND. THIS IS THE WAY WE GENERALLY APPROPRIATE FEDERAL
FUNDING THROUGH A GRANT PROCESS. MUCH LIKE THE CARES ACT
FUNDING. IS THAT CORRECT?
>> YOU ARE CORRECT. YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. SO, THE CARES ACT FUNDING, IN MY
MIND, FEELS LIKE IT WAS VERY REACTIVE. IT WAS EMERGENCY BASED, BUT IT
WAS APPROPRIATED IN THIS WAY. THE GRANTS WERE THERE. WE
APPROPRIATED IT. AND THEN SPENT THE FUNDING. I THINK THERE'S
CONFLATION ON THE TWO THINGS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT
NOW. THE FIRST THING IS THE APPROPRIATION OF THE FUNDING, WHICH WE
NEED TO ACCEPT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HAVE HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE TO THEN DISPERSE. THE SECOND PIECE, THE METHOD BY WHICH
YOU DESCRIBED WHERE THE CHAIRS HAVE SET UP A MEETING ON JULY 27,
THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND TO THE CITY MANAGER TO PUT THAT
TOGETHER QUICKLY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST MONDAY NIGHT, WE NEED
TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER QUICKLY. AS WE SEE IN SOMERVILLE,
BOSTON, PITTSFIELD, WORCESTER, PEOPLE PUT TOGETHER DIFFERENT
PROCESSES. FRAMINGHAM IS A PUBLIC SURVEY OF RESIDENTS. THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT WITH THE CITY MANAGER AND THE TEAM TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT WE CAN DO AND HOW AND WHAT THE PROCESS MAY LOOK LIKE.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE... THE APPROPRIATION OF THIS MONEY,
RECEIVING IT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE WITH GRANTS,
THE CARES ACT FUNDING AND ANY FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT. WE APPROPRIATE IT HERE AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A SEPARATE PROCESS BY WHICH WE DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THE
$65,000 IN THE PARAMETERS OF HOW THE FUNDING IS WRITTEN TO USE IT
TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC. I'M COMFORTABLE IN MOVING FORWARD
AND ACCEPTING THIS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE LARGER CONVERSATION
TALKING ABOUT THAT LAUNDRY LIST OF ITEMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT
HEADS PUT TOGETHER BASED ON PRIORITIES AND WHAT HAS COME UP OVER
THE PANDEMIC TO COME WITH AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY RESPONSE. AS I
SAID LAST WEEK, I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROCESS. I LOOK FORWARD
TO HAVING THAT LARGER CONVERSATION AT THE FINANCE COMMITTEE.
THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS FOR PUTTING TOGETHER AND PUTTING IT ON THE
CALENDAR QUICKLY. I YIELD BACK.
>> CITY MANAGER: I JUST WANT TO THANK VICE MAYOR MALLON, SHE SAID
IT CLEARER THAN WE HAVE SAID IT. THANK YOU. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT
WORKS AND COULDN'T HAVE BEEN SAID ANY CLEARER. I APPRECIATE THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER, COUNCILLOR CARLONE, AND THEN COUNCILLOR

PAGE 28

Jun 28, 2020

MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I TAKE THE FLOOR TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO
PASS THIS APPROPRIATION ORDER. AS VICE MAYOR MALLON SAID, AND THE
CITY MANAGER SAID IN HIS WEEKLY WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS MONEY. WE
DON'T WANT TO LOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE
MONEY TO DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO AND THAT MAY COVER A WIDE
VARIETY OF THINGS. THAT'S WHY THE CHAIR AND I WORKED DILIGENTLY TO
GET IT ON THE CALENDAR, WORKING WITH THE FINANCE PEOPLE TO HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION TO FULLY EXPLAIN TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND TO OUR
RESIDENTS. YOU HEARD FROM PUBLIC COMMENT, SOME PEOPLE ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THIS MONEY CAN BE USED FOR. WE NEED THAT
CONVERSATION AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT IF THE COUNCIL VOTE
TO ACCEPT THE MONEY, THEN WE CAN HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO, WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WHAT WE WILL DO.
WE'LL ENGAGE THE COLLEAGUES AND THE COMMUNITY TO THE EXTENT
POSSIBLE TO USE THE MONEY EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. I ASK YOU TO
ACCEPT THE APPROPRIATION, MOVED FORWARD AND HAVE THE
CONVERSATION AND MAKE WISE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THE MONEY
SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I
UNDERSTAND THIS. TO ME, THE PROCESS OF ACCEPTING VERSUS
APPROPRIATING IS IMPORTANT HERE. WITH THE VOTE TONIGHT, WE'LL HAVE
ANOTHER PROCESS IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORE.
AFTER WE VOTE TONIGHT, WILL THERE BE MORE VOTES THAT THE COUNCIL
WILL HAVE TO TAKE ABOUT SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS? I GUESS, WE'LL HAVE
A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. IS THIS THE ONLY VOTE OR WILL WE HAVE
MORE VOTES ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE FUNDING WILL BE USED FOR?
>> IF THE CITY COUNCIL APPROPRIATES THE FUNDS TODAY, THEY WILL BE SET
UP ON THE BOOKS. AND BASICALLY, AS NOTED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS,
THE CITY MANAGER HAS COMMITTED TO HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS WITH THE
CITY COUNCIL AND AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE END UP SPENDING THE MONEY
ON WILL BE PUBLICLY DISPLAYED AND PART OF THE REPORTING. SO, IT'LL BE
TRANSPARENT. THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL VOTES ON SPECIFIC
PROJECTS.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. SO, AFTER TONIGHT, THE
CITY COUNCIL DOESN'T HAVE ANYMORE FORMAL AUTHORITY OVER HOW THE
MONEY IS SPENT. WE CAN WEIGH IN AND GIVE SUGGESTIONS AND
HOPEFULLY THAT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AFTER TONIGHT, WE GIVE UP
OUR AUTHORITY. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT AT
THIS TIME. THE PROCESS IS STILL CONFUSING. IT FEELS LIKE WE CONFLATE
THE PIECE OF ACCEPTING AND APPROPRIATING. I LOOK AT COMMENTS
FROM THE BUDGET MANAGER IN SOMERVILLE. AND WE WOULDN'T GET
AWAY WITH A BLANKET APPROPRIATION LIKE THIS. I'M CONFUSED ABOUT
WHY WE ARE TRYING TO DO THAT PROCESS HERE. AS THE COUNCIL'S
ELECTED BODY, WE HAVE AUTHORITY ABOUT THE SPECIFICS. IT IS A LOT OF

PAGE 29

Jun 28, 2020

MONEY. ABOUT 10% OF THE BUDGET. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF NOT
APPROPRIATING THE AMOUNT TONIGHT. AND I THINK WE NEED TO WEIGH
IN ON THIS MORE BEFORE WE AUTHORIZE THIS ALL AND LET IT GO AHEAD
AND BE SPENT.
>> CITY MANAGER: I GUESS, I WOULD SAY, I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO
MUNICIPAL FINANCE, THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS THE EXAMPLE OF ANY CITY
IN THE STATE ON HOW WE RUN THE FINANCES. I'M PROUD OF IT. THE
RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. I HAVE TOLD THE COUNCIL I WILL WORK
CLOSELY WITH THEM AND MAKE SURE HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT. I WOULD
HOPE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH AUTHORITY AND THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT.
>> TO REMIND THE COUNCIL, NO DIFFERENT OF A PROCESS THAT THE
COUNCIL GOES THROUGH EVERY WEEK WHEN IT ACCEPTS AND
APPROPRIATES GRANTS EVERY WEEK. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. OBVIOUSLY,
THE VOLUME OF THE GRANT IS HIGHER. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE
DID FOR THE CARES MONEY, NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DID FOR THE
BLACK GRANT MONEY TO SUPPORT HOMELESS I'M SORRY, HOUSING
PROGRAMS AND SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN
WHAT WE DID WHEN WE RECEIVED MONEY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THIS IS
NOT A CHANGE, IT IS A CONSISTENT WAY THE CITY IMPLEMENTS GRANTS. I
DON'T THINK WE DEVIATE. WE CAN'T DEVIATE. AGAIN, I THINK THE
COMPLEXITY OF THIS GRANT AND HOW IT NEEDS TO BE SPENT WITHIN THE
SPECIFIC CATEGORIES, IT IS SOMETHING WE'LL WORK THROUGH WITH THE
COUNCIL AND THE PUBLIC. AND AGAIN, I THINK WE WILL BE VERY
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT IS FUNDED. I DON'T THINK THAT IT'LL BE A
MYSTERY TO ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THE CITY SPENT
THE $65 MILLION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER? BEFORE I MOVE
ON?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I THINK COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAS
HIS HAND UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. YOU SHOULD RECALL WE HAD AN
EXTENSIVE LIST LAST WEEK ON HOW THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THE
FUNDS COULD BE USED AND INVITED US TO COMMENT ON THAT. BOTH CO
CHAIRS, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND I, ENCOURAGE ALL COUNCILLORS TO
REVIEW THE LIST. IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS, I PROPOSE ONE TO MR. KALE
JUST YESTERDAY NO, LAST WEEK. HE QUESTIONED IT. THE POINT IS, IF YOU
HAVE THOUGHTS, PLEASE SUBMIT IT TO THE CO CHAIRS. WE WILL START
THAT PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THE ADMINISTRATION IS AWARE OF IT.
I ASSUME, THROUGH YOU MADAM MAYOR TO THE MANAGER AND THE
TEAM, IT IS JUST LIKE THE BUDGET. WE HAD PRIORITIES AND WE HAVE COVID
PRIORITIES. AND SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT RANGE, MOST, IF NOT ALL
FUNDS, WILL BE ASSOCIATED. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT. THERE
COULD BE QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN BRING UP. I BROUGHT UP NEW OPEN

PAGE 30

Jun 28, 2020

SPACE IN AREAS THAT ARE DEPLETED AND THEREFORE THEY HAVE NO
MEETING PLACES. THAT MIGHT NOT BE QUALIFIABLE, BUT INCREASING THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT REVIEW IN ANOTHER CITY WAS CONSIDERED IT BY THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
IT ALL DEPENDS. IT IS A DIALOGUE AND WE'LL HAVE THAT EXTENSIVE
DIALOGUE. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE FINANCE
CHAIRS. THANK YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER AND EVERYONE WHO WORKED
ON THIS. I DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND STILL THINGS THAT CONCERN ME A
LITTLE BIT. FIRST, A QUESTION ON THE PROCESS. WE HAD PASSED A POLICY
ORDER ASKING FOR A SPECIAL MEETING TO BE HELD JUST TO TRY TO TALK
ABOUT AND BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WHOLE THING WORKS BEFORE
WE GET INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO SPEND THE
MONEY. IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FINANCE MEETINGS OR GOING
TO DO THAT SPECIAL MEETING FIRST? AND THEN HAVE THE FINANCE
MEETINGS? WHERE DOES THAT SIT?
>> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I KNOW WE TALKED TO THE CO CHAIRS
DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE
THAT WORKSHOP PRIOR TO SETTING THE TAX RATE IN THE FALL. BASED
UPON CALENDAR, WE CAN DO THAT
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I TALK SPECIFICALLY AND MAYBE MY BRAIN HAS
MELTED, WHICH WOULD BE LIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF MY BODY AT THIS
POINT. WE PASSED A POLICY ORDER, I BELIEVE, TO HAVE A SPECIAL MEETING
OR PUBLIC HEARING TO TALK ABOUT THIS MONEY AND THE PARAMETERS,
HOW IT CAN BE SPENT, AND WHAT IT CAN'T AND CAN BE TO BETTER
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO BEFORE WE GET INTO THE
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WHAT WE WANT TO SPEND IT ON. I'M
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. I DON'T CARE WHETHER IT HAPPENS IN A FINANCE
MEETING OR ANOTHER MEETING, I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST A
PRELIMINARY CONVERSATION JUST ABOUT THIS GRANT, THIS MONEY, AND
THE PARAMETERS AROUND IT BEFORE WE GET INTO ARE WE GOING TO DO
THAT CONVERSATION IN A FINANCE MEETING OR HAVE THE SPECIAL
MEETING WE VOTED TO HAVE?
>> WE DID OUTLINE THE PARAMETERS BRIEFLY IN THE COVER LETTER FROM
THE CITY MANAGER. AS PART OF THE PRESENTATION ON THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING, WE'LL HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT ARE THE
BUDGET CATEGORIES AND THE APPLICABLE ACCEPTABLE USES FOR THE
GRANT. WE INTEND TO DO AN OVERVIEW WITH THE CITY COUNCIL AS PART
OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEETING.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE, WE
TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS IS SIMILAR TO OTHER THINGS THAT WE OTHER
GRANTS WE ACCEPTED. THERE'S ALSO WHEN THE MANAGER WANTS TO
APPROPRIATE MONEY FROM FREE CASH, LET'S SAY TO A PARTICULAR ITEM OR

PAGE 31

Jun 28, 2020

PARTICULAR ISSUE, THAT DOES COME BEFORE THE COUNCIL FOR A VOTE TO
SAY DO WE APPROPRIATE THIS MONEY OR DO WE NOT APPROPRIATE THE
MONEY. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS CASE? LET'S SAY WE GO
THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE DECIDE WE WANT TO SPEND $10 MILLION ON
X. OR THE MANAGER COMES FORWARD AND WANTS TO SPEND $10 MILLION
ON X. WE CAN SAY YES, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCRETE SAY IN THAT OR
THE MANAGER CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEND IT?
>> THIS IS NOT A FREE CASH APPROPRIATION. SECONDLY, NO DIFFERENT IN
REALITY BECAUSE THE COUNCIL, WHEN IT HAS A FREE CASH APPROPRIATION,
VOTES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FREE CASH APPROPRIATION. THE COUNCIL
TONIGHT IS, HOPEFULLY, WILL VOTE THE APPROPRIATION OF THE GRANT
WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED ABOUT WHAT THE
PARAMETERS ARE CONTAINED IN THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES OF WHAT THE
MONEY CAN BE USED FOR. THE FUNDAMENTALLY IS NOT A DIFFERENT, YOU
DON'T GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER VOTE ON A FREE CASH APPROPRIATION
ONCE YOU APPROPRIATE IT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. IS THERE A REASON THAT WE
HAVE TO VOTE THIS APPROPRIATION TONIGHT? THE MONEY IS THERE,
RIGHT? IS THERE A TIMELINE OR SOMETHING THAT COULD SIT ON THE TABLE
UNTIL WE HAVE THE FINANCE MEETING AT LEAST TO HAVE A BROADER
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS AND THEN VOTE IT? IS THERE SOME REASON
WHY IT HAS TO BE DONE NOW?
>> I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS. WE ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH THIS
APPROPRIATION SO IT CAN BE SPENT. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND
SECONDLY, THERE'S AN INTERIM REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT WE NEED
TO MEET AT THE END OF AUGUST. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US,
NOT ONLY WITH THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE PUBLIC PROCESS, BUT TO DO
THE REPORTING REQUIRED FOR THE GRANT. I WOULD SAY, WE NOTED THERE
IS A COLLABORATION COMPONENT THAT THE CITY MANAGER WILL COMPLY
WITH IN AN ENTHUSIASTIC WAY. THE SOONER WE COME UP WITH IDEAS,
THE SOONER WE CAN IMPLEMENT THEM AND FOR SOME AFFECTED
COMMUNITIES WAITING IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD THING BASED ON SOME
OF THE PAIN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE COMMUNITY. APPROPRIATING THE
MONEY AND COMING THROUGH WITH A PLAN, IDEAS THAT ARE VETTED OR
APPROVED, BASICALLY ALLOWS THE MONEY TO GO OUT THE DOOR. THAT'S
THE REASON WHY THE FEDS DID THIS GRANT IN A DIFFERENT WAY, IN A
SENSE GAVE PARAMETERS WITH BROAD FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THE MONEY
COULD GO OUT THE DOOR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WAITING DELAYS THAT
PROCESS TO HELP FOLKS THAT ARE IMPACTED OR POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY
THE GRANT.
SECONDLY, I WILL SAY THIS, I TAKE PRIDE IN THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT, THAT
INCLUDES THE CITY MANAGER AND THE COUNCIL. NOT APPROVING THIS
GRANT TONIGHT, WHICH FRANKLY IS A ROUTINE TASK, ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU ADD THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE GOING DO TO HAVE A PUBLIC INPUT
PROCESS, I THINK FRANKLY DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR THE VIEW BY THE
RATING AGENCIES. AS YOU RECALL, WHEN YOU READ THE REPORT BACK IN


PAGE 32

Jun 28, 2020

THE SPRING, ONE THING THEY HIGHLIGHTED WAS OUR FISCAL AND
PROGRAMMATIC MANAGEMENT, NOT ACCEPTING THE $65 MILLION GRANT
IN A TIMELY MANNER TO ADHERE TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND TO
GET THE PROCESS DONE, DOESN'T NECESSARILY BODE WELL IN TERMS OF
OUR OVERALL STRATEGIES THAT IS SUCCESSFUL FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MICHELLE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. MICHELLE?
>> MICHELLE: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, IT IS WE HAVE ALREADY GONE
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ACCEPTING THE GRANT. MEANING WE HAD TO
GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT, THE ONLY PERSON IN
THE CITY THAT IS LEGALLY ABLE TO SIGN OFF AND ACCEPT THE GRANT IS THE
CITY MANAGER. THAT IS HOW WE ENDED UP GETTING OUR DISPERSEMENT
OF THE FIRST ALLOCATION. THIS IS FOR US TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT THE
GRANT IS. YOUR JOB IS TO ACCEPT IT AS A COUNCIL. WE CAN MOVE ON AND
WORK WITH YOU TO COME UP WITH THE PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO DO
TO DISPERSE THE GRANT. THERE IS URGENCY. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY
THEY GAVE IT TO US THE WAY THEY DID.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, I WILL FINISH UP. I
KNOW THERE'S MORE HANDS UP. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT. I DO THINK WE
WILL HAVE GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. I REALLY WANT TO SAY, FOR
THE RECORD, I REALLY HOPE THAT THE ROBUST COMMUNITY PROCESS IS NOT
JUST FINANCE COMMITTEE MEETINGS. YOU LOOK AT WHAT OTHER
COMMUNITIES ARE DOING TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND HEAR
FROM THEM, ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY
COVID AND ONLY EXACERBATED ALL THE INEQUITIES THAT EXISTED BEFORE
COVID. I'M REALLY HOPEFUL AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO
SOMETHING MORE AMBITIOUS THAN SOMETIMES WE HAVE OFTEN DO
AROUND COMMUNITY PROCESS.
AND I ALSO HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AT THE LAST MEETING
THAT SOME OF THE MONEY MAY GO TO REPLENISH SOME OF THE FREE CASH
THAT WAS SPENT DURING THE COVID CRISIS. I HOPE WE DON'T DO THAT. I
THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TOW REALLY DO SOME
TO REALLY DO BOLD INITIATIVES THAT COULD REALLY NOT JUST GET US BACK
TO WHERE WE WERE, BUT MAKE US BETTER THAN WHERE WE WERE. AND
SO, I REALLY WOULD HATE TO SEE HALF THIS MONEY TO REPLENISH THE
COFFERS. THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND WE CAN'T SQUANDER
IT.
>> CITY MANAGER: I AGREE AND THIS IS ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS OF MONEY,
AREN'T REPLENISHING LOST REVENUE. I KNOW THAT'S A CONCERN. AN
ELIGIBLE CONCERN, BUT IT IS NOT OUR INTENT NOR DO WE THINK IT WOULD
BE THE COUNCIL'S INTENT. I WILL NEVER SAY NEVER TO ANYTHING, CLEARLY
THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT AT THIS POINT IN TIME NOR SHOULD IT BE, TO BE
HONEST. I AGREE.

Jun 28, 2020

>> TO CLARIFY THAT, IT IS CLEAR IN THE GUIDANCE BY THE FEDS, THIS IS NOT
MEANT TO REPLENISH PENSION FUNDS, NOT MEANT TO REPLENISH RESERVE
BALANCES, TO BE USED IN THE ITEMS IN THE BROAD CAT GORES. IT WILL NOT
REPLENISH FREE CASH.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I FEEL I HAVE LEARNED AND
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE EVERYTHING MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. IF
WE VOTE NO, WE REJECT $65 MILLION. THERE IS A TIME LINKNESS HERE. IT
MAY BE OKAY IF WE WAIT, BUT IT MAY NOT BE. THIS IS ACCEPTING A LARGE
GRANT. IN A WAY, IT IS THE SAME PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY OR
FORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT A USUAL PROCESS. IT IS $65 MILLION. I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN USE IT FOR. I WAS
VERY HAPPY TO SEE, OF COURSE, IT CAN BE USED TO FUND BROADBAND,
THAT'S A UTILITY. IT IS A INFRASTRUCTURE NEED. BROADBAND IS LISTED ADD
ONE POSSIBLE USE. I HOPE IT IS NOT I HOPE IT IS BROAD BROADBAND AND
BE ABLE TO DO THE RFP FOR BROADBAND WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A
LONG TIME TO STRENGTHEN AND MAKE SURE WE GET THERE.
WHAT I HEAR AND I WANT CONFIRMATION AND I HEARD THE CITY MANAGER
AND THE TEAM SAY, IT IS A COMMITMENT TO LISTEN TO COUNCIL PRIORITIES.
THEY WILL NOT BE DISPERSED WITHOUT A DISCUSSION WITH COUNCIL, I
THINK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND CO CHAIRS AND COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN SAID, WE NEED A BROADER COMMUNITY PROCESS. I WOKE UP
TO THE GLOBE TODAY, THE CITY COUNCIL IS VOTING ON THE ALLOCATION OF
THE FUND IN PROVIDENCE. CITIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH ARE DOING THIS
AND YOU READ ABOUT PROVIDENCE, THEY CHANGE THEIR VOTE BASED ON
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK FOR A WATER FIRE. IT IS AN EXAMPLE THAT WE
HAVE TO BE CLEAR WHEN WE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS, WE ARE
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE MAY NOT KNOW
THE FIRST ROUND AND THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE LISTEN CLOSELY
SO WE CAN USE THE FUNDS THE BEST WE CAN. I UNDERSTAND THE
DISCOMFORT WE GIVE A BLANK CHECK AND ACCEPT IT. I'M GOING TO
ASSUME THIS MEMO WILL BE GUIDING US. IT IS A VERY LONG LIST, VERY
IMPORTANT NEEDS. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN FUND THEM ALL. IF WE COULD,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I THINK HAVING THE TWO MEETINGS WHERE WE
UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE SPENT AND A VERY CLOSE COLLABORATION TO
ENSURE THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY KNOWS IS SOMETHING THAT
WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, WE
HAVE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY, WE NEED TO USE THIS TO MOVE
FORWARD IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY. I SEE A LOT OF NODS, I'M HEARTENED BY
THAT AND I RECOGNIZE, IT IS CHALLENGING SOMETIMES TO SAY CAN'T WE
HOLD OFF UNTIL WE KNOW MORE. I HEAR WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE
HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD.
>> CITY MANAGER: COUNCILLOR NOLAN, I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS.
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE, WE HAVE TO REALLY
DETERMINE WHAT IS ELIGIBLE EXPENSES. I CAN TELL YOU, I KNOW MICHELLE
DOESN'T LIKE HEARING THIS NECESSARILY, THERE'S NOBODY WHO
UNDERSTANDS THIS ANYMORE THAN MICHELLE. ALL GRANTS WE GOT FROM


PAGE 34

Jun 28, 2020

THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATED TO COVID 19, THEY HAVE
COME BECOME PERFECTLY BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND
DETAIL THAT THE MOSTLY HER AT THE HELM. WHEN WE MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS, IT WILL BE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE ALLOWABLE
EXPENDITURES AND WORK WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCIL TO BE ON
THE SAME PAGE. WHEN WE ARE DOING SOMETHING, NOBODY WILL COME
BACK AND SAY, IT IS NOT ELIGIBLE. WE'LL KNOW THAT AND MICHELLE IS ON
TOP OF THAT. I WILL MAKE THAT CLEAR. WE PRESENT SOMETHING, BELIEVE
ME, WE WILL SAY IT IS VALID EXPENSE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE A FEW HANDS UP. WE WENT AROUND ONCE.
BE BRIEF, WE HAVE A LOT TO COVER. I THINK FROM WHAT I HEARD, IT SEEMS
I THINK WE CAN GO AHEAD AND VOTE ON THIS AND DO A ROLL CALL AND SEE
WHERE THE VOTES LAND. I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. AND COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND
THEN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WILL BE BRIEF. WE HAD RECENT STUDIES,
WHICH YOU ARE AWARE OF, CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, THE
NONPROFITS, AND I WOULD IMAGINE PART OF THAT WOULD BE PART OF
WHAT WE'LL REVIEW AS WELL. WHAT MAKES SENSE IN THOSE PROGRAMS.
BOTH OF THOSE ENTITIES ARE PRESENT IN THE ROOM WITH THAT IN MIND.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, YOU SAID ONLY
THE CITY MANAGER CAN ACCEPT THE GRANT AND THE COUNCIL HAS TO HELP
DISPERSE. AM I RIGHT, THE CITY HAS ACCEPTED THE GRANT?
>> MICHELLE: THE CITY MANAGER HAS TO ACCEPT IT AND SO DOES THE CITY
COUNCIL. THE CITY MANAGER HAS DONE HIS PIECE. IN APPLYING FOR THE
GRANT AND FILLING IN THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. THAT IS HOW WE
WERE ABLE TO GET A PORTION OF THE MONEY. IF YOU DECIDE YOU DON'T
ACCEPT THE GRANT, WE WILL BE FORCED TO SEND THE MONEY BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO DIFFERENT
VOTES FOR ACCEPTING AND APPROPRIATING THE GRANT?
>> MICHELLE: NO. YOU ACCEPT THE GRANT. AND THEN WE FOLLOW THE
GRANT GUIDELINES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT WILL BE GIVEN
OUT TO ALL EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WHEN WE EXPLAIN IT TO YOU ON
WHAT WE CAN SPEND THE MONEY ON. WE WILL SIT AND WE'LL GO
THROUGH IT WITH YOU AND THE COMMUNITY. WHY WOULD WE SPEND
MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY DIDN'T WANT. THIS MONEY
IS FOR US TO RAMP UP THE ECONOMY, HELP THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN
HURTING THE MOST THROUGH THE WHOLE PANDEMIC, AND JUST MEANS WE
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. AS FAR AS APPROPRIATIONS GO, THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN US THE TYPES OF EXPENDITURES WE CAN SPEND IT
ON. OKAY. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT OUR LIST AND SEE

PAGE 35

Jun 28, 2020

WHAT EVERYBODY COMES INTO CONSENSUS WITH. THIS IS A GRANT. IT IS
NOT GENERAL FUND MONEY. THE LAWS ARE DIFFERENT AROUND IT. THAT'S
IT. SORRY.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANKS. I WOULD REALLY RATHER
IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO IT SEPARATELY TO ACCEPT AND APPROPRIATE
LATER, THAT'S THE PROCESS. DO YOU THINK IT IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER
GRANTS THE CITY ACCEPTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY FOR A FEW THOUSAND OR
TENS OF THOUSANDS, BUT NOT $65 MILLION. MORE EQUIVALENT WITH THE
BUDGET. WITH THE BUDGET WE GET SPECIFIC REPORTING ABOUT HOW
MUCH IS GOING TO SALARY, HOW MUCH TO EQUIPMENT, SPECIFICALLY HOW
MANY NEW POSITIONS IT WILL CREATE. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY NEW
POSITIONS, HOW MANY JOBS IN THE CITY THIS IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON?
DO WE NOT KNOW THAT YET?
>> MICHELLE: THIS IS NOT FOR POSITIONS. THIS GRANT IS FOR PROGRAMS.
IF WE NEED HELP DISPERSING THE GRANT, HANDS ON FOR REPORTING, YOU
COULD USE SOME OVERHEAD FOR THAT. WE WILL NOT DO THAT. WE HAVE
NEVER CHARGED A GRANT LIKE THIS WITH OVERHEAD COSTS. IN THE DIRECT
GRANTS, SPEND IT ON THE ITEMS THEY BASICALLY TOLD US THAT WE COULD
SPEND IT ON. MOST PROGRAMS ARE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NEGATIVE
ECONOMIC IMPACTS, DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES, ALL
TYPE OF EXPENDITURE TYPES YOU CAN SPEND ON THAT. THEY ARE TELLING
US HOW TO SPEND IT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CREATE ANY POSITIONS WITH
THIS. ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT THE MONEY OUT THERE INTO THE
COMMUNITY. WE ALSO NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE ABOUT DOING THAT AND
REPORTING BACK WHAT WE NEED TO REPORT TO THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I UNDERSTAND IT WOULDN'T BE USED
TO CREATE PERMANENT POSITION. I IMAGINE WE CAN HIRE FOLKS TO HELP
WITH PARTS. DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH IS SPENT ON EQUIPMENT VERSUS
PROGRAMMING COSTS. DO WE HAVE THAT BREAKDOWN YET?
>> TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE GOTTEN THIS ALLOCATION, WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN
BROAD CATEGORIES FOR WHICH WE CAN SPEND THE MONEY. WHAT WE
SPENT THE LAST HALF HOUR TALKING ABOUT, HOW WE SPECIFICALLY,
PROGRAMMATICALLY, SPEND THE MONEY THAT WILL FIT IN THE CATEGORIES
OUTLINED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE ANSWER IS, IT IS NOT LIKE
ANOTHER GRANT WHERE THERE IS SPECIFICITY ABOUT WHY YOU GOT THE
GRANT. THIS ONE IS, YOU GET THIS GRANT FUND, YOU CAN SPEND IT IN
THESE CATEGORIES, IT HAS TO BE WITHIN THE CATEGORIES, AND THAT'S FOR
YOU TO DETERMINE AS LONG AS YOU SPEND IT IN THE APPROPRIATE
CATEGORIES OUTLINED BY THE TREASURY. IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THERE'S
NO THERE ARE NO SET EXPENDITURES AND THAT'S WHY WE GO THROUGH A
PUBLIC PROCESS TO DEFINE WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT WE WANT
TO FUND AND MAKE SURE THE SPECIFIC ITEMS FALL WITHIN THE BROAD
CATEGORIES ISSUED BY THE TREASURY.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK THAT'S THE KEY. WE ARE COMING TO THE
COUNCIL FOR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT. WE HAVEN'T GONE TO THE FINANCE

PAGE 36

Jun 28, 2020

COMMITTEE. WE HAVEN'T GONE TO THE PUBLIC. NO, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON. WE KNOW THE CATEGORIES
BECAUSE THAT'S ELIGIBLE. TO HAVE THE NUMBERS, IT WOULD BE NO
PROCESS WITH THE PUBLIC IF WE PRE DETERMINED THAT. THAT IS NOT
DETERMINED AND FORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE TALENT WE HAVE IN
FISCAL STAFF, WE GET THE TYPE OF GRANTS, WE DO NOT BRING ON
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO HELP ADMINISTER THEM AT THE EXPENSE OF THE
GRANT. WE CAN DO IT INTERNALLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE TO MOVE ON.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THE LAST POINT, AFTER THE COUNCIL
IS ELECTED, AFTER TONIGHT WE DON'T HAVE MORE SAY IN MILLION DOLLARS
GOES HERE AND FIVE MILLION HERE. I APPRECIATE WE'LL BE CONSULTED
AND A PUBLIC PROCESS, WHEN WE VOTE TO APPROPRIATE, WE DON'T JUST
ACCEPT, WE SIGN THE CHECK. AS SOMEONE WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY TO SIGN
THE CHECK, I WOULD LIKE SPECIFICITY AND KNOWING WHAT I SIGN FOR. I
DON'T WANT TO VOTE NO OR REJECT IT, WE CAN TABLE IT FOR NOW. I MAKE
A MOTION FOR THAT UNTIL WE CAN HAVE THE DISCUSSION. IF THE VOTES
ARE NOT THERE, I UNDERSTAND AND WE CAN MOVE ON. THAT'S MY
MOTION.
>> AGAIN, THAT IS NO DIFFERENCE THAN WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL DOES
WITH EVERY OTHER GRANT IT APPROPRIATES EVERY WEEK. THIS IS NO
CHANGE IN OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO VOTE. GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. TO THE CITY MANAGER AND
STAFF, I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION AND I FULLY UNDERSTAND IT. I
DON'T THINK I'M NOT MAKING ANY ARGUMENT THAT IT IS DIFFERENT
PROCEDURALLY FROM ANY OTHER GRANT. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN
GRANULARITY. MY QUESTION IS, CAN YOU PUT FORWARD AN
APPROPRIATION FOR $10 MILLION TO BE SPENT ON THE FOLLOWING FIVE
THINGS, $2 MILLION EACH. WE VOTE ON THAT. AND A WEEK LATER, YOU
COME BACK AND SAY, WE WANT THE APPROPRIATION FOR $5 MILLION MORE
OUT OF THE 65 TOTAL. WE'LL SPEND A MILLION EACH ON THESE FIVE ITEMS.
IS THAT NOT POSSIBLE? IF SO, WHY NOT?
>> THROUGH YOU, MAYOR, THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: WHY NOT? THANK YOU. WHY IS IT NOT
POSSIBLE?
>> AS WE EXPLAINED EARLIER, BASICALLY THE GRANT IS FOR $65 MILLION.
YOU NEED TO APPROPRIATE AND ACCEPT THE TOTAL GRANT. NOT A
PIECEMEAL APPROACH AND NEEDS TO BE DONE AT ONE TIME SO WE CAN DO
OUR REPORTING AND BASICALLY VERIFY TO THE FEDS THAT THE COUNCIL
AND THE MANAGER HAVE APPROPRIATED AND ACCEPTED THE GRANT IN THE
ENTIRETY. CAN'T BE DONE PIECEMEAL.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND. I WILL VOTE FOR


PAGE 37

Jun 28, 2020

THE MOTION TO TABLE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANT TO TALK PROCEDURALLY. I
HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD. I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL
STAND TOGETHER AND MOVE THIS APPROPRIATION SO WE CAN HAVE A FULL
DISCUSSION WITH ONLY THIS ITEM BEFORE US. IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE,
I WANT TO SAY, PROCEDURALLY, THAT THE CHAIR AND I WILL LOOK FOR THE
QUESTIONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SEND THEM TO THE
CLERK. THE CLERK WILL FORWARD THEM TO US AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION ON A GRANULAR LEVEL
ON HOW THE MONEY IS DISPERSED. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, IF WE
DON'T VOTE TO ACCEPT, WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT HOW TO SPEND IT. IT IS
IMPERATIVE THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD SO WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT
STEP, WHICH IS THE DISCUSSION. AGAIN, I REITERATE, THE CHAIR AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO SEEING YOUR QUESTIONS. FORWARD THEM TO THE CLERK,
WHO WILL SEND THEM TO ALL OF US. AND THE CHAIR AND I CAN MAYBE
WORK TOWARD MAYBE GIVING PARAMETERS ABOUT WHEN THEY SHOULD
COME TO THE CLERK TO US. I MOVE THE ADOPTION IF THERE IS NO FURTHER
DISCUSSION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE IS A MOTION BEFORE US FROM COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER THAT WAS TO TABLE THIS. WE HAVE TO DISPOSE OF
THAT MOTION. AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT GOES, IF IT FAILS, WE CAN
GO TO YOUR MOTION TO ADOPT. AND ROLL CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION.
THAT'S THE ORDER OF BUSINESS. CLERK WILSON, THERE'S A MOTION BY
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER TO PLACE THE CITY MANAGER AGENDA
ITEM ON THE TABLE.
>> MR. CLERK: PLACING CALENDAR ITEM 1 ON THE TABLE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: NO.

WOULDN'T VOTE IN FAVOR OF CHANGING THE CHARTER, PEOPLE HAVE
RAISED QUESTIONS AND IDEAS ON HOW MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE
CHARTER. I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH SOME CHANGES HERE. I
WOULD PREFER WE PLACE A NON BINDING REFERENDUM IN THE NOVEMBER
COLLECTION TO CREATE A CHARTER COMMISSION AND HAVE A ROBUST
COMMUNITY PROCESS SET UP TO REALLY DELVE INTO THE CITY CHARTER AND

EXERCISED BY
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
IN COUNCIL JUNE 21, 2021
PLACED ON THE TABLE IN
COUNCIL JUNE 28, 2021

Jun 28, 2020

WHERE TO MAKE CHANGES. MY CONCERN WITH THIS IS HOME RULE
PETITION, EACH WEEK, WE'LL HAVE A HOME RULE PETITION TO CHANGE ONE
PART OF THE CHARTER. THAT'S MY CONCERN. I RAISE CAUTION TO THE
WIND, IF WE DO THIS, I THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE COMPREHENSIVELY, ONE
PACKAGE AND MOVE FORWARD. EACH COUNCIL EVERY MONDAY NIGHT CAN
BRING IN A HOME RULE PETITION TO CHANGE ONE PART. I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD GO OVER WELL WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE. I RAISE THAT. I
THINK EACH ONE OF US CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT CHANGE OF THE CHARTER
THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE DONE. I DON'T THINK DOING IT PIECEMEAL IS THE
WAY TO GO. IT IS A MAJOR, MAJOR UNDERTAKEN AND A CHANGE IN HOW
THE CITY IS GOVERNED. WE SHOULD DO IT, LOOK AT IT COMPREHENSIVELY
AND DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. THAT'S MY OPINION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I
WOULDN'T VOTE TO CHANGE THE CHARTER, BUT PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE
THAT DISCUSSION, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE DISCUSSION. CITY WIDE
AND WITH A WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR
TOOMEY'S DISCUSSION OF AND RECOGNITION IT REALLY IS TIME AND A VERY
APPROPRIATE STEP TO TAKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE
CHARTER. THAT IS ONE OF THE CHANGES WE PROPOSE FOR THE CHARTER. IT
WOULD START NEXT YEAR, IT WOULD BE A ROBUST PROCESS WITH A
COMMISSION. AND AS WE DISCUSSED, THE POLICY ORDER BEFORE US, I
WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU FOR WORKING HARD ON THIS. IT IS A
YEAR PROCESS AND OVER THE LAST WEEK, THERE IS DISCUSSION ABOUT
MOVING THIS FORWARD. AND TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT I SAID LAST
WEEK BEFORE DISCUSSING THE AMENDMENTS SENT TO THE COUNCIL TODAY,
THE POLICY ORDER BEFORE US LAYS OUT THE NUMEROUS MEETINGS AND
MEMOS BY THE COLLINS CENTER. THE MEMOS AND BASED ON OTHER
REVIEWS IN MASSACHUSETTS WERE PRODUCED AFTER INTERVIEWING EACH
MEMBER OF THIS BODY.
AND THE THREE PROPOSED CHARTER AMENDMENTS BEFORE US ARE
ORDINARY AND STANDARD IN MANY MUNICIPALITIES IN MASSACHUSETTS.
AND YET, THE CHANGES IF ENACTED WOULD BE MEANINGFUL. IF WE PASS IT,
THE PUBLIC PROCESS WILL CONTINUE, WILL UNFOLD AND WILL BROADEN.
THERE IS NOTHING MORE PUBLIC AND OPEN AND TRANSPARENT THAN
HAVING THE DECISION ON WHETHER TO CHANGE THE CHARTER ON A BALLOT
AND LEFT UP TO THE VOTERS. I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE
COUNCIL THE POLICY ORDER AMENDMENTS SENT EARLIER TODAY.
THEY DO NOT CHANGE THE INTENT OR SUBSTANCE OF THE THREE CHARTER
AMENDMENTS. THEY AIM TO ADDRESS THE WAY THE CHARTER
AMENDMENTS END UP ON THE BALLOT BEFORE VOTERS. AND IT CLARIFIES
THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS IF THIS WERE TO PASS. FOR THE APPOINTMENT
CLARIFICATION, QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE ORIGINAL WORDING OF
WHETHER 30 DAYS IS LONG ENOUGH GIVEN SUMMER RECESS AND WHETHER
WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMETHING IF AN APPOINTMENT IS NOT APPROVED OR
REJECTED. THE NEW LANGUAGE WILL CLARIFY, IT COULD UP TO 60 DAYS, IF


PAGE 41

Jun 28, 2020

NOTHING HAPPENS IN THE 60 DAYS, THE APPOINTMENT OR REAPPOINTMENT
WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE APPROVED IF NO ACTION IS TAKEN. THAT'S
WHAT A LOT OF CHARTERS HAVE AND TO CLARIFY THE CHANGE WILL MAKE
THAT CLEAR AND SPECIFIC.
THE ORIGINAL ORDER WOULD HAVE SENT THEM TO THE LEGISLATURE. AFTER
LEARNING ABOUT ANOTHER POTENTIAL PATH LAST WEEK, THE PATH THAT
BOSTON IS TAKING, EVERYONE HAS A MEMO FROM THE COLLINS CENTER ON
THE DESK, AFFIRMING THIS WOULD BE A LEGAL PATH FOR US TO USE,
SENDING THE AMENDMENTS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DIRECTLY IS THE
BETTER PATH. IT IS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD, IT IS LESS BUREAUCRATIC,
AND FRANKLY IT IS LESS BURDENSOME FOR THE STATE DELEGATION, WHICH
HAS SO MUCH ON THEIR PLATE IT WOULD BE CHALLENGING TO SEE IF THEY
GET THIS IN TIME FOR NOVEMBER VOTE. IT WILL GUARANTEE A TIMELY
PROCESS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IF WE USE THE PROCESS, WOULD HAVE
FOUR WEEKS TO APPROVE OR DENY THE AMENDMENTS. AND IF APPROVED,
THEY ARE ON THE BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER. THE COLLINS CENTER AGREES
THE PROCESS IS LEGAL AND PRACTICAL. AND I LONG WITH THE MOTION
MAKERS BELIEVE THESE ARE THE BEST OPTIONS TO PUT THIS BEFORE THE
VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. A BIG RAIN IS TIMING. SECTION 18 NEEDS TO GIVE A
THUMBS UP OR DOWN IN FOUR WEEKS, WITH OTHERS, NO WAY TO TELL
HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH
GOING ON. TIMING MEANS THE ELECTION COMMISSION WILL HAVE
APPROPRIATE TIME TO PUT THE QUESTIONS ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT.
THAT'S A CONCERN. IT WOULD MAKE IT DONE BEFORE AUGUST, WHICH IS AN
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF TIME TO MAKE A BALLOT IF THE AG CONFIRMED IT
WAS A LEGAL QUESTION. WE CAN START THE VOTER EDUCATION PROCESS IN
A MONTH. ULTIMATELY, REGARDLESS OF THE DIRECTION, THE CHARTER
AMENDMENTS WILL REST IN THE HAND OF THE VOTERS AND THE
AMENDMENTS DO NOT CHANGE THAT FACT. AND IT WOULD BE EXCITING
FOR US TO START THIS PROCESS. ONE OF THE CHANGES WOULD MANDATE A
LARGE PUBLIC REVIEW THROUGH A COMMISSION STARTING NEXT YEAR AND
EVERY TEN YEARS. WE ARE NOT SAYING IT WON'T HAPPEN, THERE ARE TONS
OF QUESTIONS TO BE RAISED. THOSE ARE MORE APPROPRIATELY HANDLED
NEXT YEAR IF THIS PASSES WE ENGAGE IN A LONGER AND THOROUGH
PROCESS AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. I HOPE WE WILL PASS IT. I KNOW
THE AMENDMENTS ARE BEFORE US AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI, YOU MAY WANT
TO ADD TO MY COMMENTS. I WILL THANK COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER
AND COUNCILLOR CARLONE WHO ARE SPONSORS OF THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BEFORE I GO TO MY COLLEAGUES, I DID RECEIVE AN
EMAIL AT 5:19 TODAY. I WILL FORWARD IT TO YOU. I RECEIVED IT FROM
DAVID SULLIVAN, CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND FORMER STATE ELECTION
DIVISION, CHIEF LEGAL COUNCIL, THE COLLINS CENTER ADVISED YOU THE
PROCEDURE REQUIRES A 2/3 OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE STATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL APPROVAL AND PASSAGE BY THE VOTERS AT A
CITY ELECTION. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTION. I AGREE
WITH THE COLLINS CENTER ADVICE, SECTION FOUR OF THE STATE
CONSTITUTION HOME RULE AMENDMENT, AND CHAPTER 43 B, SECTION 108


PAGE 42

Jun 28, 2020

AND 18 OF THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL LAWS AUTHORIZE THIS
PROCEDURE AS LONG AS THE CHARTER CHANGE DOESN'T CHANGE THE
COMPOSITION MODE OF ELECTION OR APPOINTMENT OR TERMS OF OFFICE
OF MAJOR CITY OFFICIALS AS THIS ONE DOESN'T. MY QUALIFICATIONS TO
GIVE THIS ADVICE INCLUDE THAT AS THE FORMER STATE ELECTION DIVISION
CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL, I WROTE THE LOCAL CHARTER PROCEDURE GUIDE, I
WAS ALSO AT THE STATE SENATE CHIEF... THE STATE SENATE CHIEF LEGAL
COUNSEL FOR OVER TEN YEARS. I REVIEWED RECENT ATTORNEY GENERAL
OPINIONS ON THIS SUBJECT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
HE FURTHER WROTE THAT THE CHAPTER 43 B, REQUIRES THAT THE MAYOR'S
CONCURRENCE ONLY IF THE CITY HAS A MAYOR DEFINED AS AN OFFICER
ELECTED BY THE VOTERS AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CITY OR
OFFICER ACTING AS SUCH. CAMBRIDGE DOESN'T HAVE A MAYOR, THE
APPROVAL OF THE 2/3 IS REQUIRED.
I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH THE COUNCIL. I WILL GO TO ANY
COUNCILLORS WHO HAVE HANDS UP. I THINK I SAW COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
I'M NOT SURE. WE HAVE THE SOLICITOR HERE AND I WILL GIVE THE
SOLICITOR THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MY HAND IS NOT UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. DISCUSSION FROM COLLEAGUES? I DON'T SEE
ANY. WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US, THEY ARE AMENDMENTS. WE SHOULD
VOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS. I KNOW THE SOLICITOR IS IN THE CHAMBER
AND IF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING, YOU CAN.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EMAIL AND I DIDN'T RECEIVE A
COPY OF THE MEMORANDUM FROM THE COLLINS CENTER UNTIL LATE THIS
AFTERNOON ALSO. SO, WE ARE AT A BIT OF DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT
TO OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE IT. I WILL SAY, I LIKE TO BE CLEAR AND ON THE
RECORD, AS THE CITY'S LAWYER, WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT
WHETHER THAT PROCESS CAN BE USED IN THIS WAY. FIRST OF ALL, THE FACT
THAT BOSTON USED IS NOT RELEVANT. I AGREE WITH THAT PART THAT
DAVID SULLIVAN SAID. THE FIRST PART OF THE SECTION 10 A, REFERS TO
AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE PROPOSED WITH THE CONCURRENCE WITH THE
MAYOR WITH EVERY CITY THAT HAS A MAYOR. THAT IS ONE DISTINCTION.
THE LANGUAGE IS AMBIGUOUS. I'M SURPRISED THAT DAVID SULLIVAN FEELS
IT IS AS CLEAR AS HE SEEMS TO THINK. IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS
SECTION 10 A PROCESS IS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF CITIES THAT HAVE A
MAYOR. IF IT WERE TO BE, I AGREE WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT HE READ, BUT
I DISAGREE WITH WHAT IT MEANS. PROPOSE ANY CHANGE IN A CHARTER
RELATING TO THE COMPOSITION, MODE OF ELECTION OR TERMS OF OFFICE
OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY, OFFICE, OR CITY MANAGER. IT REALLY DEPENDS
ON WHAT TERMS OF OFFICE MEAN. IT COULD MEAN TERM IN TERMS OF
TIME. IT COULD ALSO MEAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. I HAVE NOT HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANY LEGAL RESEARCH ON THIS. THE COLLINS CENTER
MEMORANDUM IS NOT BASED ON LAW. IT IS NOT A LEGAL OPINION OR
LEGAL ANALYSIS. THEY ARE NOT LAWYERS. AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH TIME DAVID SULLIVAN HAD TO ANALYZE THIS AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY

LEGAL GUIDANCE AVAILABLE TO THE CITY COUNCIL. I DID WANT TO SHARE
MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. I ASSUME IF THE AMENDMENTS ARE PASSED, IT
GOES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND DHCD, WE'LL HEAR FROM THE STATE
IF THEY FEEL THERE ARE PROBLEMS. I WANTED TO SAVE THE COUNCIL SAVE
THAT ROADBLOCK IF THERE DOES TURN OUT TO BE AN ISSUE. OF COURSE,
THAT IS UP TO THE COUNCIL WHICH WAY TO PURSUE. I WANTED TO SHARE
THE CONCERNS I HAD ABOUT IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. ONE QUESTION I HAVE AND REALLY FOR
THE BODY, IF WE DO THE AMENDMENTS, THEY PASS, DEPENDING ON WHAT
THE AG'S OFFICE SAID, I WONDER IF THERE IS A WAY TO SAY IN THE EVENT
THAT THE AG'S OFFICE ROUTE IS NOT TENABLE, WE CAN ALSO REACH OUT TO
THE STATE LEGISLATURE WITH THE HOME RULE.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I RECOMMEND THE COUNCIL TAKE TWO VOTES IN THE
ALTERNATIVE. SO, IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES RAISE ANY CONCERNS
OR NOT AGREE WITH THE POSSIBLE APPROACH OF DOING IT THAT WAY, YOU
WOULD HAVE THE SPECIAL LEGISLATION PETITION LEAD DRAWN UP ALREADY
THE WAY YOU HAVE SO YOU CAN PERHAPS IN THE ORDER, ANOTHER ORDER
COULD SAY YOU WANT TO SUBMIT THIS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
DHCD AS CHAPTER 43 B, SECTION 10 A, IN THE EVENT THAT ROUTE IS NOT
SUCCESSFUL FOR ANY REASON, YOU VOTE IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO SUBMIT
THE HOME RULE PETITION TO THE LEGISLATURE.
>> MR. CLERK: IF I MAY? ON THAT POINT, I THINK PROCEDURALLY, IT MAY BE
SIMPLER AND EASIER TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK THAT YOU DISCUSSED TO
ADOPT THE POLICY ORDER IN THE UNAMENDED FORM. AND THEN TO TAKE
THE AMENDMENTS AS A LATE POLICY ORDER. THE OWN SEPARATE POLICY
ORDER AND SEND THEM TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE RISK THERE, THEY ARE OPEN TO CHARTER RIGHT.
THAT'S THE RISK WE LEARN AND I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO DO THAT. I
THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO PROBABLY FIGURE OUT HOW WE LOOKING
AT COUNCILLOR NOLAN. AMEND THE LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE THE
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. I'LL GIVE TIME TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO DO THAT
WHILE I GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M UNSURE WHAT THE TIME
CONSTRAINTS ARE. MAYBE THE SOLICITOR CAN HELP US WITH THAT. I
WOULD EXPECT THAT WE'D HEAR BACK FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE RELATIVELY QUICKLY. WHETHER OR NOT THEY AGREE WITH THIS
APPROACH. DOES THAT LEAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE HOME RULE
PETITION IF FOR WHATEVER THE REASON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
SAYS NO, WE CAN'T DO IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT THE TIME CONSTRAINTS? AG'S
OFFICE HAS FOUR WEEKS. I THINK IT IS MORE THEY SAY NO. IT IS FOUR
WEEKS FROM NOW, IT IS AUGUST 1. GETTING SOME TO THE LEGISLATURE
WOULD THEN HAVE TO ACT ON IT, IF THEY DO APPROVE IT, IT HAS TO GET
ELECTION COMMISSION IS INVOLVED. THEY HAVE TO PRINT BALLOTS. THE
TIMING RUNS OUT IN THAT RESPECT, IN MY VIEW.


PAGE 44

Jun 28, 2020

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IF I CAN EXPLAIN, THERE IS A TIMING ISSUE FOR
BOTH OF THESE. AS YOU INDICATED, THE CLERK DEMONSTRATED A WAY TO
DO THIS IN ONE ORDER WITH AMENDMENTS. THERE'S ALSO, LITERALLY
LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE, THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE A LONG TIME WITH
HOME RULE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND IT IS A HIGH
PRIORITY OF THE COUNCIL AND THE ELECTION COMMISSION NEEDS TO
PREPARE A THIRD BALLOT. THEY NEED TIME TO DO THAT. IF THIS GOES INTO
SEPTEMBER, IT WILL BE VERY CHALLENGING, IF NOT LOGISTICALLY DIFFICULT
GIVEN THEY WILL PREPARE BALLOTS FOR NOVEMBER AND THEY WOULD LIKE
MORE THAN TWO MONTHS. EARLY VOTING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. ABSENTEE
VOTING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. IT IS TIMING.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I'M UNCLEAR ON THE PROCESS. CAN WE SEND
IT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND TO THE LEGISLATURE AT THE
SAME TIME? IF WE HEAR BACK FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE, WE CAN NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE NEVER MIND.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FROM WHAT COUNCILLOR NOLAN SAID, IT IS TWO
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. YOU CAN'T SEND WHAT IS BEFORE US BEFORE THE
AMENDMENTS TO THE AG'S OFFICE. WE HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS. CLERK
WILSON?
>> MR. CLERK: SO, YOU CAN SEND WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU WANT TO
EITHER ENTITY. YOU CAN SEND WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU WANT TO
WHATEVER ENTITY. I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS CRAFTING SOME LANGUAGE THAT
WILL SOME ONE VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ONE
VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT ANSWERS MY
QUESTION. WE SEND IT TO BOTH OFFICES OR SENDING IT TO THE
LEGISLATURE ONLY AFTER WE HEAR BACK FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE EVENT THAT THE AG'S
OFFICE ROUTE IS UNTENABLE, I DON'T HAVE THE AMENDMENT BEFORE ME
JUST YET, COUNCILLOR NOLAN IS WORKING DILIGENTLY. AFTER SHE HAS IT,
WE CAN HAVE THAT BEFORE US.
>> MR. CLERK: FOR SIMPLICITY, IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO SEND THEM BOTH
SIMULTANEOUSLY. YOU MAY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE TIMING, BUT IT IS
WHATEVER THE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN, WE CAN DO THAT? COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR NOLAN IS WORKING ON THOSE OPTIONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GREAT. THAT IS MY PREFERENCE TO SEND IT
TO BOTH BODIES AT THE SAME TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WHILE DOING THAT, ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTION S,
FELLOW MOTION MAKERS, YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD? NO. WAIT FOR A
MOMENT


PAGE 45

Jun 28, 2020

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M SENDING SOMETHING TO THE CLERK. THE
CLERK HAS AMENDED LANGUAGE. I ALSO HAVE TWO SEPARATE
DOCUMENTS. ONE WOULD BE THE ORIGINAL. THE HOME RULE AND THE
SECOND WOULD BE WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND ONE SENT TO THE
LEGISLATURE AND ONE SEND TO THE AG'S OFFICE. I THINK WE START WITH
THE AG'S OFFICE AND HAVE THE OTHER AS A BACKUP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN SUGGEST WE DO
BOTH.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK WILSON, YOU HAVE THE AMENDMENTS TO YOUR
EMAIL SO WE CAN HAVE THE COUNCIL PREVIEW THEM?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: WE ARE ALSO AMENDING THE LANGUAGE
ITSELF. RIGHT? IN THE MECHANISM? CHANGING IT FROM 30 DAYS TO 60
DAYS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: WE CAN VOTE ON THOSE AMENDMENTS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I BELIEVE SO, YES. HOLD ON, COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. CLERK WILSON IS LOOKING AT WHAT HAS COME FROM
COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> MR. CLERK: I WILL SHARE THIS ON THE SCREEN. ADD ANOTHER ORDERED
PARAGRAPH THAT SENDS ONE VERSION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ONE
VERSION TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THERE WOULD BE TWO
DOCUMENTS. ONE DOCUMENT WOULD BE I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH
ONE IS WHICH. THIS IS THE LANGUAGE AS AMENDED. (DOCUMENT ON THE
SCREEN). IT IS A NEW ATTACHMENT. IT HAS THE 60 DAY LANGUAGE. YOU
WANT TO AMEND THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE TO CHANGE THAT TO 60 DAYS
INSTEAD OF 30.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: IT IS A LOT TO SHARE ON THE SCREEN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: DO WE KNOW WHICH LEGISLATOR WE ARE
SENDING IT TO? THE HOME RULE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO. NOT YET.
>> MR. CLERK: TRADITIONALLY, IT IS SENT TO REPRESENTATIVE DECKER.
ATTACHMENT IS AMENDED AS FOLLOWS. THE FIRST SECTION. IT IS HARD TO
SEE ON THE SCREEN. I WILL FORWARD IT TO THE COUNCILLORS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN YOU SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE?
>> MR. CLERK: I WILL FORWARD THIS TO THE BODY. CORRECT ME IF I'M
WRONG, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, THERE ARE TWO PETITIONS IN THIS ONE
ATTACHMENT. THE FIRST ONE GOES TO THE... TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
OFFICE. THE SECOND PETITION GOES TO THE LEGISLATURE. IT HAS AN
AMENDMENT MOVING FROM 30 DAYS TO 60 DAYS.


PAGE 46

Jun 28, 2020

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE ADOPT THE
AMENDED VERSION FIRST. THAT IS VERY CLEAR. GOES FIRST TO THE AG AND
SECONDLY, WE HAVE THE BACKUP FOR THE HOME RULE. IF THERE IS A WAY
THAT THE CLERK CAN ENSURE THAT'S HOW WE MOVE FORWARD, THAT
WOULD BE
>> MR. CLERK: THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO CATEGORIES. ONE AN
AMENDMENT TO THE ORDERED PARAGRAPH. I WILL SHOW ON THE SCREEN.
ADD A SECOND ORDERED PARAGRAPH, ENSURES THAT ONE VERSION GOES
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THE FIRST ORDERED PARAGRAPH.
AND THE SECOND ORDERED PARAGRAPH, SENDS THE SECOND COPY TO THE
LEGISLATURE. AND THE NEXT CATEGORY OF AMENDMENTS, AMEND WHAT
ARE THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE IN THE PETITION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. MAYBE NOT. SOLICITOR?
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I WANT TO ADD A COUPLE OF NOTES. I READ THE
SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE CHANGING IT FROM 30
TO 60 DAYS. AND ALSO ADDING AN ADDITIONAL SENTENCE THAT SAYS,
ACTION ON ANY PROPOSED CHARTER CHANGES SHALL BE AUTHORIZED BY
I'M SORRY. NOT THAT LANGUAGE.
SORRY. EXCUSE ME. THE SENTENCE WOULD BE ADDED, APPOINTMENT OR
RE APPOINTMENT SHALL TAKE EFFECT IF THE CITY COUNCIL FAILS TO ACT IN
THOSE DAYS. ANOTHER POINT OF CLARIFICATION THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT
IS TO BE FORWARD TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, IT IS FORWARDED
TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL MAKE THAT ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT.
>> MR. CLERK: TO CLARIFY. THE LANGUAGE IN THE ORDERED PARAGRAPH OR
AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE MOTION PASSES.
>> CITY SOLICITOR: I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE PUT LANGUAGE IN THE
PROPOSED ORDER THAT SAYS IT WOULD GO TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO
WHERE IT SAYS IT WOULD BE SENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IT SHOULD
ALSO ADD ALSO TO BE SENT TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S WHAT CHAPTER 43 B, SECTION 10 C,
REQUIRES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL MAKE THAT ADDITION RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU,
SOLICITOR.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE SCREEN, SEE THE BLUE PORTION... COUNCILLOR
NOLAN, THIS IS YOUR MOTION?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE ARE READY TO GO.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENTS: (ROLL CALL). EIGHT IN FAVOR AND
ONE AGAINST. ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO THE CHARTER RIGHT ITEM FOUR. THIS
WAS EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN.

Reconsideration of Calendar #2

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I MOVE MY CHARTER RIGHT ON THIS PARTICULAR
POLICY ORDER BECAUSE OF MY CONCERNS. AND THERE ARE A FEW. ANY
CHANGE AT THIS JUNCTURE WILL DELAY THIS PROJECT FOR AT LEAST ONE
YEAR. AND WITH AN INCREASED COST ABOUT $6 10 MILLION
CONSERVATIVELY SPEAKING, THIS MEANS THE TOBIN SCHOOL COMMUNITY
WON'T MOVE INTO A NEW BUILDING UNTIL AT LEAST SEPTEMBER 2026. IT
ALSO MEANS AN ADDITIONAL YEAR STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND STAFF BEING
RELOCATED. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PRE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS WILL
BE DELAYED UNTIL 2026. PROJECT TEAM HAS IDENTIFIED THE TREES TO BE
RETAINED ON THE SITE AS THOSE ON THE PERIMETER, THREE COMMUNITY
MEETINGS THIS WAS DISCUSSED. JULY 2020 AND SEPTEMBER 2020 AND
AGAIN IN DECEMBER OF 2020. THIS COMMUNITY PROCESS HAS RESULTED IN
A PREFERRED DESIGN FOR THE TOBIN, ET CETERA PROJECTS. PROPOSING TO
PLACE THE STORM WATER TANK WHICH PROVIDES SUFFICIENT FLOOD RELIEF
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THE SCHOOL, THIS AS A RESILIENCY
MEASURE THAT IS IMPORTANT IN THE AREA OF THE CITY.
THE INTENTION OF THE PROJECT TO MAXIMIZE REPLANTING AROUND THE
SITE. THE PLAN IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TREES REQUIRED BY THE
NEW TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCE AND THE DESIGN OF SUCH IS
UNDERWAY AND ONGOING FOR SOME TIME. AND COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT IS PLANNED FOR THE TREE AND LANDSCAPE DESIGN. I WANT
TO JUST SAY, I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE CITY MANAGER AND/OR THE STAFF
TO SPEAK FURTHER ON THIS. I WANT TO KNOW, THE OTHER PART OF MY
CONCERN ABOUT DELAYING THIS PROJECT, IT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. I
WILL BRING TO YOU THE ATTENTION SOMETHING THE COUNCIL MAY NOT BE
AWARE OF BECAUSE A NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS WERE NOT HERE AT THE
TIME. THAT IS THE MAIN LIBRARY. IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS AND WE ALL
BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN LIBRARY IS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING AND CLEARLY
THROUGH ENORMOUS PUSHBACK SITED AT THE ORIGINAL LOCATION WHERE
IT WAS INITIALLY SELECTED TO BE.
AND THAT WAS A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR COST, INCREASE COST BECAUSE OF
DELAYS. THE SECOND DESIGN HAD AN ESTIMATE COST OF $51 55 MILLION
WHEN THE BIDS WERE RECEIVED. THE COST CAME IN WE DELAYED IT. THE
CITY PERFORMED VALUE ENGINEERING, MEASURES TO REDUCE THE COST
AND STILL NEEDED TO APPROPRIATE AN ADDITIONAL $13 MILLION. MY
CONCERN IS, THERE ARE MEETINGS WITH THE COMMUNITY AGREED AND AS
FAR AS I KNOW AND HAVE BEEN TOLD, THIS IS THE PLAN THAT THE
COMMUNITY HAS VOTED FOR. MY CONCERN IS IF WE TRY TO CHANGE NOW,

PAGE 49

Jun 28, 2020

WE WILL INCUR A LOT OF ADDITIONAL COST AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A
WISE THING. THAT'S WHY I EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT. I RESPECTFULLY
ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO ALLOW THIS TO FAIL AND LET THE PROJECT GO
FORWARD AS THE COMMUNITY HAS AND IS AWARE OF IT GOING FORWARD.
HAVING SAID THAT, I WOULD LIKING TO HEAR IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT
CITY MANAGER DEPASQUALE OR SOMEONE FROM THE STAFF WOULD LIKE TO
ADD WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE ORDER MAY HAVE, BEYOND WHAT I ENTERED
INTO THE RECORD. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OF THE STAFF IN THE CHAMBER RIGHT
NOW. I KNOW THAT I KNOW COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND COUNCILLOR
CARLONE HAVE THEIR HANDS UP. I WILL GO TO THEM AND PERHAPS
PERHAPS CITY MANAGER MAY SHOW UP. FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING
THE NEXT FEW CONVERSATIONS, I WILL ASK VICE MAYOR MALLON TO TAKE
OVER AND I WILL BE BACK SHORTLY. I GO TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I TALKED TO THE CITY MANAGER ABOUT THIS. MY
COLLEAGUES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS ORDER. AND HE UNDERSTOOD
THAT THE ORDER IS ASKING HIM TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO WORK WITH
AND SAVE THE TREES. THERE'S NOTHING IN IT ABOUT ANY DELAY. I REALLY
APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS RAISING THAT QUESTION AND
UNDERSTANDING HER CONCERN THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO DELAY. WE
WANT THIS TO MOVE FORWARD. EVERY PERSON WHO HAS WRITTEN TO US
UNDERSTANDS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. IT
WOULD BE GREAT IF IT TOOK LESS TIME THAN WE ARE NOW EXPECTING.
QUICKLY RECAP WHAT I SAID LAST WEEK, AND REITERATE WHAT WE HEARD
IN PUBLIC COMMENT, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EMAILS. YES, THE
COMMUNITY DID TALK ABOUT AND KNOW ABOUT THIS PLAN. NOWHERE IN
THE PLANS WAS THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE TREES BEING REMOVED. A YEAR
AGO ON THE PLAN, IT HAD SOME TREES IN EXACTLY THE SPOT THAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT. MANY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSUMED IT WOULD BE THE
GLORIOUS AND LARGE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO REPLACE TREES. AND THE
COMMITTEE ON PLANTING ITSELF, CAME IN AND WEIGHED IN. THEY HEARD
ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PLANS ABOUT WHICH TREES WOULD BE REMOVED. A
FEW WEEKS AGO. AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS IS RIGHT, THIS IS A PLAN
THAT HAS BEEN REVIEWED WITH THE COMMUNITY. THE SPECIFICS ABOUT
WHICH TREES WOULD BE SAVED AND WHICH COULD BE SAVED AND WHICH
WOULD BE SCHEDULED TO BE CUT DOWN WAS NOT CLEAR. THE FULL PLAN IS
NOT IN PLACE BECAUSE IT IS NOT DETERMINED.
THERE ARE 129 TREES ON THE SITE. 94 ARE SLATED TO BE REMOVED AND
WHAT THIS PO CONCERNS, ASKING JUST THE CITY MANAGER, NOT TO DELAY
THE PROJECT, BUT TO WORK CLOSELY TO SEE IF THE TREES CAN BE SAVED.
THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING. I WILL ADD
SOMETHING ELSE I MENTIONED TO THE CITY MANAGER ABOUT THIS AND
ASKED IF HE HAD CONCERNS. HE INDICATED HE WASN'T SURE IT COULD BE
DONE. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS SOMETHING HE'D WORK TO TRY TO
DO. REVISIT AND GO BACK TO THE TEAM WORKING ON THIS TO SEE IF THERE
IS TO BE DONE. THE OTHER ELEMENT THAT I REMINDED HIM OF, WE ARE IN

PAGE 50

Jun 28, 2020

THE PROCESS SEEKING TO ACQUIRE A SLICE OF THE ARMORY LAND. AND THE
QUESTION IS, IT IS NOT TOO LATE IN THE PLAN FOR THAT ALLEVIATES THE
NEED TO TAKE DOWN THE TREE, WHICH IS CONVENIENCE FOR ELEMENTS. IT
SEEMS WORTH DOING. THE THREE OAKS MAKE UP FOR 25% OF THE CANOPY
PROPOSE FOR RENEWAL. IT WILL TAKE DECADES BEFORE THE REPLACEMENT
TREES CAN PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF THE OLD TREES AND NO GUARANTEES
THE NEW TREES WILL SURVIVE. DOESN'T HAVE TO DELAY THE PROJECT, WE
ARE RAISING THE SALIENCE OF THIS IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND PROVIDE
SHADE FOR NOT JUST THE NEIGHBORS AND THE WORKERS ON THE SITE. IF
THERE IS A WAY TO SAVE THEM AND HAVE THE PROJECT MOVE FORWARD,
WE ARE ASKING THAT TO HAPPEN. IT SEEMS INCUMBENT ON US TO DO THAT
AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE SEEN AS DELAYING THE PROJECT. ANALOGY TO
THE LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION, THAT WAS THE BUILDING. THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS SEPARATE. IT IS ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC PART OF
THIS SITE THAT CAN BE LOOKED AT, TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF WE CAN SAY IT. I
HOPE MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT IT. I KNOW THE CITY MANAGER IS NOT
PROMISING ANYTHING, WHEN I TALKED TO HIM, HE SAID HE'D TRY AGAIN. I
BELIEVE HIS TEAM KNOWS WE'D LIKE TO DO THIS. WE ARE NOT SURE IF WE
CAN. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE
AS THE CO MOTION MAKER.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I LOOKED AT THE SITE PLAN. IT IS
NOT A SURVEY ACCURATELY LOCATING THE TREE TRUNKS, BUT IT SURE
APPEARS TWO OUT OF THE THREE TREES COULD BE SAVED. THEY ARE NOT IN
THE ROADWAY, NOT IN THE CURB LINE. I DON'T KNOW THE EXTENSION OF
THE ROOT STRUCTURE UNDERNEATH. ONE TREE IS DEFINITELY IN THE WAY
OF THE ROAD LAYOUT. I UNDERSTAND WHY THE ROOT WANTS TO BE
RETAINED, I ASSUME FOR BUSES COMING IN AND OUT.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE SAVED. FELLOW LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS TELL ME
AND MAYBE THEY DON'T QUALIFY, YOU CAN MOVE SUCCESSFULLY AT A 90%
RATE A LARGE TREE. IT IS EXPENSIVE, BUT IT CAN BE DONE. THOSE TWO
THINGS ALONE, IN MY MIND, MEAN WE HAVE TO GET GREATER
INFORMATION. I NOTICED THE DPW COMMISSIONER AND HIS BOSS HAVE
RETURN ED. WE MIGHT GET MORE INFORMATION ON THIS, VICE MAYOR
MALLON. THANK YOU.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR CARLONE. I WILL GO TO
THE CITY MANAGER AND COMMISSIONER FOR ANYTHING THEY WOULD LIKE
TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION. MR. CITY MANAGER?
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU I WILL TURN IT OVER TO OWEN AND DAVID. I
WILL SAY WHEN THIS CAME UP, WE DID ASK OWEN AS WE HAD FROM DAY
ONE TO LOOK AT ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO SEE WHATEVER TREES WE CAN SAVE.
OWEN HAS LOOKED, HE TALKED TO OUR CONSULTANT. THIS IS THE
RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE. OWEN CAN GET INTO THE SPECIFICS. SINCE
THIS PROJECT HAS STARTED, WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE COULD TO
PROTECT AS MANY TREES AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S THE CITY POLICY AND A
LEADER IN MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS. THEY CAN TELL YOU SOME OF THE

PAGE 51

Jun 28, 2020

CONCERNS NOW.
>> FRANKLY, WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF LOOKING AT THIS. IT IS IRONIC
THAT WE ANTICIPATE ORDAINING A NEW TREE ORDINANCE THIS EVENING
AND HOW THIS ISSUE EMERGED. INDEED, ONE OF THE TREES AT THIS TIME IS
SCHEDULED FOR REMOVAL, EXCEPTIONAL TREE, IT COMES AS SIGNIFICANT
PAIN TO ME PERSONALLY, BUT I THINK TO EVERYBODY ELSE, THIS IS THE
PREDICAMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN.
COUNCILLOR CARLONE IS RIGHT. INDEED, WE THINK THERE ARE TWO TREES
THAT ARE VULNERABLE AS A RESULT OF THE DESIGN OF THE DRIVEWAY AND
ACCESS TO THE UNDERGROUND AREA OF THE SCHOOL. HOWEVER, THERE IS
A 1.25 MILLION GALLON STORM WATER TANK THAT IS BEING CONSTRUCTED
IN THIS LOCATION. THIS IS THE ONLY LOCATION WHERE THAT CAN BE
CONSTRUCTED.
THIS IS AN ENORMOUS TANK. MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE SEEN AN IMAGE
THAT WE COMPLETED IN PL 6, ADJACENT TO THE LARGE TALL BUILDING IN
THE PORT. THIS TANK WILL BE ABOUT THREE TIMES BIGGER THAN THAT.
AND SO, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE THE TREES ON THAT BASIS. GOING BACK
TO WHAT COUNCILLOR CARLONE SPOKE ABOUT, WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN
ACTUAL LY SAVE THESE TREES AND REPLACE THEM, THAT IS A HUGE IF YOU
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE TREES, THE SIZE OF THE CANOPY, I'M NOT
UNDERESTIMATING THE IMPACT HERE AT ALL. WE'LL LOOK AT THAT, I DON'T
THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAVE THEM, THERE ARE TWO ADDITIONAL TREES
THAT ARE SOMEWHAT ADJACENT TO THEM THAT WE'LL LOOK AT AS WELL.
WE'LL LOOK AT OTHER SPECIES, GOOD QUALITY TREES TO SEE IF THEY ARE
SAVEABLE. IN TERMS OF SAVING THESE, THE ONLY PLACE TO RELOCATE
THEM IS ON THE TOBIN FIELD. YOU CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SPACE.
THEY ARE TOO BIG TO BE TRANSPORTED OUT. THAT'S THE REALITY. YOU
CAN'T GET THEM THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
RECOGNIZE AS WELL, YOU HAVE POOR SOIL CONDITIONS IN THAT FIELD AND
THAT COMES WITH SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS. THERE
IS NOTHING STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SAVING THE TREES, FROM MY
PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT REGARD.
AS THINGS STAND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO SO AND
THAT'S WITH CONSIDERABLE REGRET. AGAIN, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT
THIS AND I HOPE WE HAVE A MORE DETAIL RESPONSE BACK TO YOU BY THE
MEETING IN AUGUST. AGAIN, WE HAVE A SCHEDULE THAT IS PRETTY
AGGRESSIVE. WE HAVE WE CLOSE DOWN THE SITE ON THURSDAY. THE
CONTRACTOR AND THE ARCHITECTS ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF WORK THAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS FALL. THIS IS WILL BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO THAT
SCHEDULE THE MORE WE DELAY. WE ARE UNDERSTAND PRESSURE TO SEE
WHETHER THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES.
ONE THING I WILL SAY IN TERMS OF THE LANDSCAPING OF THE FIELD ITSELF,
THAT IS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THAT WORK
CONTINUES TO BE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF THE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN. I
EXPECT WE'LL GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC PLANNING COMMITTEE WITH MORE
DETAILS OF THAT AS TIME MOVES ALONG. AND OUR COMMITMENT IS THAT

PAGE 52

Jun 28, 2020

WE WILL REPLACE WE'LL PLANT AS MANY TREES AS POSSIBLE IN THAT AREA.
RECOGNIZING THE OPEN SPACE HAS TO BE PRESERVED IN TERMS OF
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PLANNED FOR THAT AREA. WITH CONSIDERABLE
REGRET, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, EVERYBODY'S PERSPECTIVE, THAT THE
TREES WILL HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED. WE LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO
RETRIEVE THE SITUATION, IF POSSIBLE. AT THE MOMENT I'M NOT
OPTIMISTIC.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE HAVE WORKED HARD ON THE ARTICLE 97 ISSUES TO
BE WHERE WE ARE AT AND WE ARE CONCERNED IF WE END UP MOVING THE
THREE TREES, IT COULD CAUSE ARTICLE 97. NO GUARANTEE. THERE IS A
POSSIBLE AND WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE
ALL SET WITH THAT. THAT IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL MAJOR ISSUE THAT IS
RIGHT NOW NOT RESOLVED IF WE WERE TO MOVE THEM. I DON'T KNOW IF
OWEN WANTS TO GO FURTHER. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER STRONGLY BECAUSE
IT IS A BIG PROCESS TO GET WHERE WE ARE AT TO SAY WE ARE ALL SET TO
MOVE FORWARD. WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. AT THIS POINT IN TIME,
WHERE WE ARE WITH THE PROCESS AND WHAT WE LOOK AT, IT WILL BE
DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SAVE THEM.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: ANYTHING TO ADD ON THE ISSUE?
>> NOT AT THIS TIME.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. IT IS A BIT FRUSTRATING TO BE IN
THE POSITION AGAIN WHERE WE ARE BEING TOLD WE HAVE TO DESTROY
LARGE CANOPY TREES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CONSTRUCTION
PROJECT. I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. I'M NOT
HEARING A LOT OF OPTIMISM OR OPTIONS HERE. I DON'T SEE ANY REASON
NOT TO THE PASS THIS ORDER TONIGHT BECAUSE AS ALWAYS THE CASE
PASSING THE ORDER IS NOT INTRODUCING ANY DELAYS.
IN TERMS OF MOVING THE TREES ON THE SITE IN TERMS OF THE SOIL
CONDITION, I HOPE WE'LL IMPROVE THOSE IN ANY CASE IN ORDER FOR
WHATEVER REPLACEMENT TREES WE ARE PLANTING TO THRIVE.
I DON'T SEE THAT AS A PARTICULAR IMPEDIMENT AND I GUESS MY QUESTION
TO THE COMMISSIONER IS WHETHER THE STORM WATER TANK PRECLUDES
PUTTING THE TREES ON TOP OF WHERE THE TANK IS LOCATED. MY
COLLEAGUES HAD BROUGHT UP EXAMPLE OF THE MAIN LIBRARY AND IT IS
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THE TREES WERE REMOVED AND
LOCATED ON TOP OF THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE. IS THAT A POSSIBILITY?
>> TO PLACE THE HUGE TANK, I NEED TO MAKE THAT SPACE AVAILABLE. IT
ECONOMY THE TREES ARE PRESENTLY ON WHAT WAS A LANDFILL.
EXPOSING THAT SOIL AND THEN WE HAVE TO RELOCATE THAT TREE THAT
ROOT SYSTEM WITH THAT MATERIAL IN IT. THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL AND
SAFETY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.
THE TREE THAT WAS RELOCATED AT THE LIBRARY ULTIMATELY DIED. THERE


PAGE 53

Jun 28, 2020

WERE TWO TREES, ONE DIDN'T MAKE IT WHEN IT WAS RELOCATED. AND SO,
REPLANTING LARGE TREES THIS SIZE IS A CONSIDERABLE EFFORT. I DON'T
KNOW WHETHER THAT CAN BE DONE SUCCESSFULLY. I HAVE NO EXPERTISE
IN THIS AREA. WE ARE LOOKING AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE TO SEE IF
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO DO THIS ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND FROM A
PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE SOUND.
I DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH
ISSUE OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M ALL SET.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I BELIEVE THE MAYOR IS BACK. WE'LL GO TO
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. YOU JUST ANSWERED A
QUESTION FROM COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK IN
TERMS OF I WANT TO MAKE SURE HOW THE TREES, THE TREES WERE NOT ON
THE LOT OR ON THE CONSTRUCTION SITE FOR THE SCHOOL. AND YOU
ANSWERED THE REASON THEY ARE BEING REMOVED IS BECAUSE OF THIS
TANK THAT IS GOING UNDERGROUND. IT IS STILL THEY ARE BEING
REMOVED NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO REMOVE THEM, BUT BECAUSE IT
IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROJECT. IS THAT FAIR TO SAY.
>> THAT IS FAIR TO SAY.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: AND THE ONLY THING I'D SAY ABOUT
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN MENTIONED, WE CAN PASS THIS TONIGHT. I
WOULD SAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CITY HAS ALREADY LOOKED AT THIS
CLOSELY. ALREADY STUDIED IT AND ALREADY CONSIDERED TRYING TO SAVE
THE TREES AND COME UP WITH THE CONCLUSION THEY CAN'T. I WOULD
JUST WHY GIVE THEM MORE WORK TO DO FOR SOMETHING THEY HAVE
ALREADY DONE. I'M SATISFIED WITH THE CITY'S ANSWER. NOT THAT I'M
THRILLED ABOUT IT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF THIS WASN'T THE CASE.
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE CITY DID THIS MADE THIS DECISION
EASILY OR WITHOUT THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS
UNFORTUNATELY NECESSARY. I WILL NOT BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS
TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: ANOTHER POINT AND SORRY I MISSED SOME OF THE
MEETING. THERE IS A CONCERN WHEN YOU DO A SCHOOL, IT IS
TRADITIONALLY A FOUR YEAR WAIT AND I KNOW PARENTS HAVE TO MOVE
THE CHILDREN OUT OF THERE. THIS WILL NOW MAKE IT A FIVE YEAR WAIT.
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR PARENTS WHEN DO YOU SCHOOLS,
STUDENTS HAVE TO BE MOVED. THIS WILL DELAY TO A FIVE YEAR PROJECT
RATHER THAN A FOUR YEAR PROJECT. JUST ANOTHER CONSIDERATION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WILL SAY AND ACKNOWLEDGE, I
UNDERSTAND THE WORK THAT COUNCILLOR NOLAN HAS DONE. YEARS ON
THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE SHE A STRONG ADVOCATE ON ISSUES OF THE
ENVIRONMENT AND TREE PROTECTION. SECOND ONLY TO OUR FORMER
COLLEAGUE, MAYOR DAVIS, WHO LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR ALL THIS


PAGE 54

Jun 28, 2020

ENVIRONMENTAL WORK, TREE PROTECTION WORK, THIS IS STARTED BY
FORMER COUNCILLOR AND FORMER MAYOR DAVIS, I APPLAUD THE
EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT YOU DO, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, ON THE
ENVIRONMENT AND AROUND TREE PROTECTION. YOU STAND HEADS AND
SHOULDERS POOF MANY OTHERS WHO TAKE THIS ISSUE ON.
THIS IS NOT I BRING UP THE CONCERNS, IT IS BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE HEARD
OUR CITY EXPERTS HAVE SAID, WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS. I DON'T THINK ANY
CITY DOES AS MUCH AND GOES AS FAR AS AROUND TRYING TO DO ANYTHING
AND ALL THINGS THAT WILL PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE ONLY
REASON I BRING UP MY CONCERN, IF WE HAVE ALREADY LOOKED AT IT, WE
HAVE BEEN TOLD, WITH MOVE DISDAIN AND REFLECTION AND
CONSIDERATION, WE CANNOT MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD. I DO KNOW
THIS CAME UP MAYBE THROUGH A COMMUNITY INDIVIDUAL. WE WANT TO
ASK AND RE ASK. AT THIS POINT, I THINK WE HAVE THROUGH THE WORK OF
THE CITY COUNCIL STAFF WE HAVE EXHAUSTED OPTIONS AND TRIED TO
COME UP WITH AS GOOD A RESPONSE THAT LEAVES US A MEASURED EFFECT.
THE TREES... AS IT WAS SAID, IT PAINS HIM THAT THE TREES COME DOWN.
AND WE'LL REPLACE THEM AND NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. IT
HAS TO DO OTHER THINGS FOR THE CITY. THERE IS NO WAY AGAINST THE
ORDER YOU PUT FORWARD. IT IS JUST MY CONCERN AND WHY I WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE KNOW AND WE HAVE THE
EXEMPLARY PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAID, IF WE CAN SAVE THE TREES, WE
WOULD.
BY SAVING THE TREES, IT MAY COST US MORE AND THAT'S WHY I RAISE THAT
AS AN ISSUE TO MY COLLEAGUES. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: A QUICK QUESTION. THE REASON THE TANK HAS
TO BE THERE IS BECAUSE ELSEWHERE IS DIRECTLY OVER THE OLD GARBAGE
PIT AND CAN'T HOLD THAT WAIT. AND THIS IS NOT IN THAT ZONE. THIS IS
ADJACENT TO IT. THAT'S TOO BAD I WAS SEARCHING. THANK YOU. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: ONE MORE QUESTION. IF WE WERE TO ACQUIRE
THAT SLICE OF THE ARMORY, CAN THE TANKS BE THERE? I KNOW IT IS IN
PROCESS AND NOT GUARANTEED. IS THAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE STATUS
OF THAT? THAT SITE? IS THAT SOMETHING WE CAN...
>> WE MADE PROGRESS ON THE PURCHASE OF THE ARMORY, EVEN IF IT
TECHNICAL CAN GO ON THAT I WILL LET OWEN SAY THAT THE PROJECT
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED BECAUSE WE'D BE HELD HOSTAGE ON
THE OUTCOME WE DON'T CONTROL. TO THINK IT CAN USE A SITE THAT IT
DOESN'T OWN OR NEVER MAY OWN. I WILL SAY I THINK THE ANSWER IS I
DON'T THINK IT IS A VIABLE SOLUTION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I KNOW IT PAINS YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SITE,
GEOLOGY, WHICH IS WHAT COUNCILLOR CARLONE ASKED ABOUT, IT WAS


PAGE 55

Jun 28, 2020

APPROPRIATE IF WE KNOW.
>> THE OTHER POINT TO MAKE, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TANK IS ON THE
CRITICAL PATH. IF THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHERE THE TANK CAN BE,
EVERYTHING STOPS AS WE ACHIEVE A CERTAINTY AS TO WHERE THE
ALTERNATIVE LOCATION IS. THAT MEANS YOU LOSE THIS FALL AND WINTER.
AND THAT CERTAINLY WILL PUSH YOU OUT SIX MONTHS. IN TERMS OF A
SCHOOL YEAR, THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. SIMPLY PUT, FROM THAT
PERSPECTIVE, CHANGING THE LOCATION OF THE TANK CAUSES REDESIGN,
WHICH IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND. THE I THINK THE
REASON YOU HEAR THIS FRUSTRATION, AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, THE
PLANS ARE ON THE TABLE, THE VERY SPECIFICS OF THE TREE REMOVAL IS THE
PLANTING COMMITTEE IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO MANY PEOPLE UNTIL JUST A
FEW WEEKS AGO. THE PLANS FROM A YEAR AGO, IT WASN'T CLEAR. THE
MORE TO ENSURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, IF ANY FUTURE PROJECTS, IT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO JUST SAY, WE ARE ALL TRYING TO HONOR WHAT IT IS
THAT PEOPLE WANT.
I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T PAY
ATTENTION TO. THIS IS SOMETHING I PAID ATTENTION TO AND WHEN IT
CAME TO US A FEW WEEKS AGO, CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING. THIS IS ON
PRIVATE PROPERTY. IT WOULD COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THAT
PERSON TO TAKE IT DOWN. I UNDERSTAND, WE WANT TO SAVE IT AND I'LL
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING CAN I TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY WAY WE CAN. I
WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT.

(TECH/CAPTIONING RECONNECTION)

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SUGGEST AN UP AND DOWN VOTE.
>> WE HAVE ADJUSTED THE LANGUAGE, WHICH WE SUBMITTED EARLIER
THIS AFTERNOON. IT WAS PROPOSED THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
DEVELOPERS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING FOR TREE
PROTECTION EFFORT S THROUGH THE TREE REPLACEMENT FUND. PUTTING
THAT AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU AND I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL CAN
SUPPORT IT AND AGAIN WE WORK OUT THE LANGUAGE WITH THE MAYOR
AND THE CITY SOLICITOR AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JUST SO COLLEAGUES KNOW, I DID SHARE THE
LANGUAGE WITH MIKE JOHNSTON AND PETER AND CARL. I THINK THEY
REVIEWED IT. AND I THINK THEY ARE FINE WITH THIS AMENDMENT BEFORE
US. I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AGO,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN DID PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT AND THEN
WITHDREW IT. AND THEY DON'T LAST THE MEETING. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN SAID HE WOULD WORK ON SOME OTHER LANGUAGE. THAT'S


PAGE 56

Jun 28, 2020

BEFORE US. I SEE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S HAND UP.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. GET MY CAMERA ON HERE.
THANK YOU TO YOU AND TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND EVERYBODY
WHO WORKED ON THIS AND REFINED IT. I LIKE A LOT MORE. I FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THIS THAN THE ORIGINAL AMENDMENT. A COUPLE QUICK
QUESTIONS FOR CLARITY. WE HEARD THINGS IN PUBLIC COMMENT. I WANT
TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.
SO, THIS WOULD AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER WAS GOING FORWARD
WITH A PROJECT, AND WANTED TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO
EITHER REPLACE TREES OR SAVE TREES, THEY WOULD BE WOULD BE
ALLOWED TO DO THAT. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO DO THAT. SO, I KNOW
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK IN PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AT
JEFFERSON PARK. I THINK THAT LED TO A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION. MY
UNDERSTANDING FROM READING THIS, THIS IS OPTIONAL FOR THEM, NOT
ANOTHER REQUIREMENT, NOT ANOTHER COST OR SOMETHING THAT MAY
LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF UNITS OR ANY OF THAT. JUST IF THEY WOULD LIKE
TO REQUEST THIS MONEY, THEY NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. IS
THAT CORRECT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: OKAY. AND THEN, THERE WAS TALK ABOUT IT
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER. IF IT IS VOLUNTARY, AN AHO PROJECT COULD
REQUEST IT OR NOT REQUEST IT. I GUESS IN THAT SENSE, IT DOESN'T
MATTER. I DO WANT TO SAY FOR THE RECORD, WE DID HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF
THIS IN PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT JEFFERSON PARK. AND THE TREES. I WANT
TO POINT OUT, I ASKED MIKE JOHNSTON ABOUT THIS, THEY LOOK AT
CUTTING DOWN BETWEEN 151 AND 157 TREES. THEY ARE ADDING 194
TREES. OBVIOUSLY, I UNDERSTAND THE CANOPY, THEY ARE NOT REPLACING
THE TREES WITH THE SAME SIZE, SO IT IS A LOSS TO THE CANOPY AND THAT'S
NOT GOOD. A LOT OF THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THEY NEED TO TAKE THE
TREES DOWN TO REPLACE THE UTILITIES AND STUFF UNDERNEATH AND ADD
AN ADDITIONAL 100 UNITS. IT MADE IT SO THERE WAS PUBLIC COMMENT
THAT MADE IT SOUND LIKE THEY CUT TREES AND NOT REPLACE THEM. THEY
ARE PLANTING 194 TREES AND I UNDERSTAND THE CANOPY ISSUE. I DIDN'T
WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THEY ARE CUTTING THEM DOWN AND NOT
REPLACING. MAYBE NOT PERFECT, BUT CERTAINLY BETTER THAN PEOPLE
THINKING THEY ARE JUST CUTTING THE TREES DOWN AND DOING NOTHING
ELSE. I WILL MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE CLEAR. I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK ON
THIS AND I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR
HIS SUPPORT AND FOR THAT EXPLANATION. I DID HAVE MR. JOHNSTON SAID,
I TOURED THE SITE WITH HIM AND LOOKED AT THE TREES THAT ARE BEING
TAKEN DOWN. AS HAS BEEN SAID, IN PUBLIC COMMENT, A LOT OF TREES ARE
IN BAD SHAPE. AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED ANYWAY. NOT ALL OF
THEM.
AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, IT MAY BE THAT THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED AND THE


PAGE 57

Jun 28, 2020

LANDSCAPING IS DESIGNED AND IT TURNS OUT THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITY
TO PLANT A FEW MORE TREES. BUT THE PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE THE FUNDS
TO DO IT. WHAT THIS PROVISION WOULD PLEASURE IS THAT IN THAT
SITUATION, THEY COULD APPLY TO THE TREE REPLACEMENT FUND FOR
THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO INCREASE THE CANOPY IN THAT EXAMPLE.
SO, AGAIN MY THANKS TO YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, FOR WORKING WITH ME
ON THIS AND I HOPE WE CAN PASS THIS AND THEN ORDAIN THE
AMENDMENTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER HANDS UP ON THIS MATTER? I WANT TO
MAKE A BRING A QUICK POINT. RELATED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE
WORK, INCLUDING CHA, HAS DONE AROUND ENERGY AND REDUCING
GREENE HOUSE EMISSIONS. I THINK IT IS GREAT WE TALK ABOUT TREES
AND THEY REDUCE THE GREENE HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY OVER 31% SINCE
2010. WE TALKED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE TREES ARE UNDER IT
AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT THE CHA IS DOING TO MITIGATE AGAINST
CLIMATE CHANGE. I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
WE TALK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH. BRING UP THE CHA AND THERE'S PUBLIC
COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT CHA IS OR ISN'T DOING AND I WANT TO CLEAR THE
RECORD, BASED ON WHAT I HAVE SEEN, THEY HAVE ACTUALLY SPENT
SIGNIFICANT MONIES TO TRY TO MITIGATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I'M GLAD
THAT THE COUNCILLORS OUR COLLEAGUES AGREE WITH THE AMENDMENT
AND THANK YOU TO THE SOLICITOR AND MEGAN WHO WORKED WITH US
ON THIS. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS, WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON THE
AMENDMENT. CLERK WILSON?
>> MR. CLERK: ON AMENDING THE ORDINANCE TO INSERT A NEW SENTENCE.
EXCUSE ME. AMENDING THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE TO INSERT A NEW
SENTENCE AT THE END OF SECTION 8.66.040. DEVELOPERS OF 100%
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT NOT OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE

WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR OVER TWO YEARS, STARTING WITH
THE WORK OF FORMER VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX... FOLKS OF GREEN
CAMBRIDGE. OF COURSE, DPW AND THE URBAN FOREST TASK FORCE, IT HAS
BEEN A LONG ROAD TO GET HERE. I THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB
PROTECTING OUR TREE CANOPY, WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL. THERE ARE
RECENT ARTICLES IN THE GLOBE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF HEAT EXPOSURE IN
THE BOSTON AREA. WE'RE SEEING IT IN HOUSTON AND OREGON. WITH THE
HEAT WAVES THAT ARE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE
CHANGE. IT IS REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE PROTECT OUR TREE CANOPY AND
MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE THE BENEFITS AND LIFE SAVING BENEFITS OF THE
TREE CANOPY TO EVERYBODY IN OUR CITY. INCLUDING OUR LOW INCOME
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR ADOPTING THAT
AMENDMENT AND I HOPE WE CAN PASS THIS ORDINANCE TONIGHT. THANK
YOU.

ORDER NUMBER 1). COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. REALLY QUICK, THIS IS I QUICK FIX
TO AN ISSUE WE HEARD ABOUT THAT THERE WAS A RESIDENT WHO SPOKE
TONIGHT WHO WAS TAKING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S DOG TO HELP WITH POST
OPERATIVE CARE. AND WAS TOLD THAT SHE NEEDED A VARIANCE TO DO
THAT. WENT TO THE BZA, THEY SAID THIS DOESN'T FIT IN ANY DEFINITION, SO
WE CAN'T APPROVE YOU TO DO THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD THING. CERTAINLY IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HELP A
FRIEND OR SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY TAKE CARE OF AN ANIMAL THAT
NEEDS MEDICAL CARE, THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. HOPEFULLY,
WE CAN PASS THIS TONIGHT AND GO ON AND GET THIS DONE IN SHORT
ORDER. AND I WANT TO THANK VICE MAYOR MALLON FOR HER SUPPORT. I
WANT TO THANK ACTUALLY I WANT TO THANK... I DID PULL IN THE ADVICE
OF SOME HELP FROM PATRICK BARRETT, AN ATTORNEY, ON HOW THIS FITS
INTO THE TABLE OF USES. I THANK HIM. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THIS
DONE QUICKLY. AND OPEN THIS UP FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THIS
APPROPRIATELY AND LEGALLY. I'M SURE IT HAPPENS MORE THAN WE KNOW.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE COUNCILLOR CARLONE NEXT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS, AT LEAST MY BOOK DIDN'T HAVE MORE
OTHER THAN THE CHART AND THE DISTRICTS. IS THIS FOR ONE DOG? OR IS
THIS UNLIMITED NUMBER OF DOGS?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I DID ACTUALLY HAVE A WHOLE
BUNCH OF BACKUP INFORMATION AND WAS ADVISED TO NOT INCLUDE IT
AND HAVE THAT BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE.
THIS ALLOWS ONE ANIMAL DOG, CAT, OR HAMSTER, I GUESS. IF IT IS MORE


PAGE 61

Jun 28, 2020

THAN ONE DOG, IT IS A SPECIAL PERMIT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE CASE, BUT I WANTED
TO BE CLEAR. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO TO VICE MAYOR MALLON AS THE MOTION MAKER
AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO BE A COSPONSOR ON
THIS AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING IT ON. WE WATCHED A FEW WEEKS AGO,
MAYBE LAST WEEK, WHEN IT IT WAS AT THE BZA AND THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A QUICK FIX FOR ANYONE THAT WANTED TO DO THIS. TO ANSWER THE
QUESTION, VERY BOTTOM OF THE POLICY ORDER, IT DOES SAY, SINGLE
ANIMAL HOSPICE. THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A KENNEL OR MULTI ANIMAL.
CLEARLY SPELLED OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POLICY ORDER IN SECTION K,
SINGLE ANIMAL HOSPICE. I HOPE THAT CLEARS UP THE QUESTION AND I
HOPE OUR COLLEAGUES CAN SUPPORT US AND GO OFF TO ORDINANCE OR
THE PLANNING BOARD. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE THIS AND
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I WANT TO CONFIRM, THIS WAS A
ZONING PETITION AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE SINCE WE HEAD INTO A
RECESS THERE WAS ENOUGH TIME FOR IT TO PASS IF WE MOVE FORWARD
WITH IT TONIGHT IF THE MOTION MAKERS HAVE LOOKED AT THAT?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: WE WERE GOING TO BRING THIS IN LAST WEEK
AND WE PURPOSELY BROUGHT IT IN THIS WEEK TO GIVE MORE TIME. WE
SHOULD BE GOOD TIME WISE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. SEEING NO OTHER HANDS UP, WE'LL DO A
ROLL CALL ON THE ORDER?
>> MR. CLERK: ON REFERRING THIS MATTER TO THE PLANNING BOARD AND
ORDINANCE:

>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 4. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 4). GO TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND FILED BY COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND MYSELF.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. FIRST, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
BEING A COSPONSOR OF THIS NAME CHANGE OF THE AGASSIZ
NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE MARIA BALDWIN NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK IT IS
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY ACCOUNTER. A YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS
RAISED IN CAMBRIDGE, WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW STUDYING AT
HARVARD AND TOOK THIS ON AS A ROLE OF ADVOCACY IN RIGHTING A
WRONG. LIFT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE A MAN, I OFTEN SAY GENTLEMAN, I
DON'T BELIEVE HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF ANY MAKING, WHO PERFORMED
SHAMEFUL ACTS. IF I CAN GET MY HAND ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE
USING IN A MEMORIAL, MARKERS, AND PUBLIC ART, WHAT MEANS WHAT
SHAMEFUL ACTS CONSTITUTE... AGASSIZ CLEARLY STANDS STRAIGHT OUT.
ONE SHAMEFUL ACT IS ENGAGED IN PROFITING FROM OR KNOWN IN THE
ROLE OF SUPPORTING OF THE TRANS ATLANTIC SLAVE ACT OR PARTICIPATING
IN THE THEFT OF LAND OR ENGAGE IN WORK OR EFFORTS THAT PROMOTE
THE VIOLENCE OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE HIERARCHY OF HUMAN VALUE
BASED ON RACE. I BELIEVE ONE THING THAT AGASSIZ DID WAS WROTE AT
LENGTH AROUND THE HIERARCHY OF HUMAN VALUE. AND HUMAN VALUE
PLACED AFRICAN AMERICANS AT THE VERY BOTTOM. AND SO THIS YOUNG
WOMAN TAKES ON HERSELF, THIS ROLE OF SAYING I WANT I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD NAMED AFTER SOMEONE WHO HAS
PARTICIPATED IN WHAT WE WOULD CALL EGREGIOUS ACTS. OUR CITY IS ONE
THAT STANDS TALL ON BEING TRYING TO BE PROGRESSIVE AND
PROMOTING AND DOING THE RIGHT THINGS, EVEN WHEN WE SEE THE
WRONG THING HAS BEEN DONE, WE TRY TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE
THOSE CHANGES.
I WOULD SAY, CAMBRIDGE DOES A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE THE CHANGES. I
OFTEN SAY WE ARE ON THE ROAD, BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I THINK BACK
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE, WHEN A MEMBER MADE
THAT HORRIBLE STATEMENT. AND CERTAINLY HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO
STAND DOWN. THAT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY. THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT, THIS
IS OUR CHANCE, THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT A WRONG. AND ALSO,
TO LIFT UP A MARIA BALDWIN IN THE SECOND WHEREAS, IT IS WRITTEN, THIS
PROCESS WAS INITIALLY BROUGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL'S ATTENTION IN
FEBRUARY OF 2020. AT WHICH TIME THE COUNCIL VOTED IN FAVOR OF
ENDORSING THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS DISCUSSION AROUND THE
POTENTIAL NAME CHANGE. IT GOES FURTHER, AND THE LAST WHEREAS, THE
MEMBERS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL REPORTED THAT THERE WERE
SOME DISSENTING OPINIONS, THE MAJORITY OF THE RESIDENTS DID WISH TO
HAVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NAME CHANGE IN HONOR OF MARIA BALDWIN.
A SPEAKER EARLIER TALKED ABOUT HOW WE NAMED OUR BUILDINGS. I WILL
POINT OUT, WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON, NEIGHBORHOODS, ARE NAMED
AFTER TWO MEN. THE NAME WELLINGTON SCHOOL, ON COLUMBIA STREET


PAGE 63

Jun 28, 2020

AND THE HARRINGTON STREET ON CAMBRIDGE STREET, THAT NAME WAS
ADOPTED BY THE CAMBRIDGE REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY IN THE EARLY
1960S, DESCRIBING URBAN RENEWAL AREA. THE WELLINGTON SCHOOL,
LONG GONE, ON COLUMBIA STREET, WAS NAMED FOR DR. WILLIAM
WELLINGTON. 1814. 1896. AND THE HARRINGTON SCHOOL, AFTER CHARLES
HARRINGTON, 1953... WHO END UP BEING THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
SCHOOLS, THE BUILDING WAS TAKEN DOWN FOR THE KING OPEN. I RAISE
THAT TO SAY, WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS NAMED AFTER PEOPLE.
WELLINGTON AND HARRINGTON. I'M HOPING AND ASSUMING THEY HAVEN'T
COMMITTED ANY EGREGIOUS ACTS, WHY WOULD WE NOT FOR ALL THE
GOOD THIS WOMAN HAS DONE, FOR SO LONG HIDDEN FROM THE SIGHT,
WOULD WE NOT ONE LIFT HER UP, LIFT UP THE ATTITUDE, OPINIONS, AND
SENTIMENT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND RIGHT THIS WRONG BY TAKING
AGASSIZ'S NAME OFF OF ANYTHING THE CITY HAS THAT NAMES HIM AS PART
OF ANY NEIGHBORHOOD IN OUR CITY. I'M HOPING. I'M HOPING THAT MY
COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THIS MOTION AS ONE SMALL STEP IN THE
JOURNEY OF EQUITY. AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE GOOD WORK OF PEOPLE
THAT HAVE BEEN FOR SO LONG, MARIA BALDWIN, BEING MARGINALIZED IN
OUR OWN HISTORY.
I YIELD THE FLOOR TO YOU, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL
COMMENTS. AFTER WHICH, I HOPE MY MEMBERS WILL SPEAK FROM THEIR
HEART AND I HOPE AT THE END OF ALL THE DISCUSSION, THERE WILL BE A
VOTE TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I HAVE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE. I WILL JUST SAY
REALLY BRIEFLY, I WANT TO THANK MIA AND MANY OTHERS INVOLVED IN
THIS. IT IS RESOLVED THAT THE CITY COUNCIL GO ON RECORD ENDORSING
THE NAME CHANGE, WITH THAT SAID, I THINK YOU AND I, WE HAVE BEEN IN
TOUCH WITH SOLICITOR ON THE THERE'S A QUESTION OF IS THIS POLICY
ORDER ANYTHING THAT COMES NEXT AFTER THE POLICY ORDER. I THINK
THAT CAN BE FIGURED OUT. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO GO ON RECORD
BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID AND BASED ON WHAT IS OUTLINED AND THE
PROCESS THAT WE VOTED ON IN FEBRUARY, 2020, TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL
HAVE THIS ENDORSEMENT AND HAVE THE POLICY ORDER IN SUPPORT OF
WHAT THE COUNCIL MAY WANT.
I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE. COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU, MADAM
MAYOR, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND MIA. IT IS FUNNY, WHEN COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS WAS TALKING AND SOME OF THE ARGUMENT FOR NOT DOING
THIS ABOUT WE CAN'T NAME A NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER A PERSON. WELL,
ISN'T THAT WHAT THE AGASSIZ ALREADY NAMED AFTER. THE WRONG
PERSON. AND SO, I THINK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. I WENT TO THE AGASSIZ
AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND I SUPPORTED THE NAME CHANGE THEN
AND I SUPPORT THE NAME CHANGE NOW. AND THIS IS WE HEARD THAT


PAGE 64

Jun 28, 2020

ARGUMENT AND IT WAS SAID GREAT, IT STRUCK ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY HE
WAS A MAN OF HIS TIMES.
NOT EVERYBODY DURING THAT TIME FELT THAT WAY. AND THERE WERE
PEOPLE THAT STOOD UP AND THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T BELIEVE
THOSE THINGS. AND YOU DON'T GET OFF THE HOOK JUST BECAUSE THAT
WAS A MORE COMMON HELD BELIEF BACK THEN. YOU CERTAINLY COULD
HAVE HELD A DIFFERENT BELIEF. HE IS NOT ABSOLVED OF THAT. I WANT TO
THANK ALL OF YOU. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. AND IT IS A
LONG OVERDUE CHANGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. I TOTALLY
REMEMBER, I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SCHOOL COMMITTEE I WENT,
IT WAS STARTED IN 2002 TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL. IT IS
EXACTLY WHAT NEEDED ED TO HAPPEN AND VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE
STUDENT DRIVEN RESEARCH PROJECT TO LEAD TO THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL
CHANGE, I THINK THIS PROCESS IS ALSO A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE TO GO
FORWARD ON. AND WE DID GET A NUMBER OF EMAILS, TEN OR 15 EMAILS
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS WHO FELT LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE
NOTIFICATION ON IT. I KNOW THAT THE ANC, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE
COUNCIL, DID A SURVEY, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FEEL THEY
WERE NOT APPRISED OF IT. I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET
THAT WORD OUT.
GET THE WORD OUT TO THE PEOPLE SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE FULL
EXTENTS OF WHAT THE NOTIFICATION WAS, THE PROCESS, AND THEY DON'T
FEEL IT IS GOING ON WITHOUT THEIR NOTICE. I PERSONALLY THINK IT
SHOULD BE CHANGED, DEFINITELY. I THINK THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS GET
THE AGASSIZ OFF OF ALL OF THIS. HOWEVER, SINCE IT HAPPENED, I WILL
EXERCISE MY CHARTER RIGHT TO MOVE FORWARD AND ENSURE AND
UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN MAKE SURE THEY
UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS SO THEY DON'T FEEL BLIND SIDED BY THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, I RECOGNIZED COUNCILLOR CARLONE. I WILL LET
HIM SPEAK AND THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I TOO SUPPORT A NAME CHANGE.
THE NAME OF BALDWIN, OBVIOUSLY, IS HEAVILY RESEARCHED. I GET A LOT
OF THE MEANING OF THAT. THERE ARE 5,000 PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN AGASSIZ, I
THINK THAT IS A LITTLE OVER 2,000, I HOPE WE SEND OUT A POSTCARD SO
THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT IT. I DEGREE WITH MY FELLOW COUNCILLOR, WE
CAN SAY WE ENDORSE BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE, BUT MY
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A HORRIBLE NAME. NEIGHBORHOOD 9. I WANT TO
CHANGE IT. IF IT CHANGED IN COUNCIL AND I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT, I
WOULD BE PRETTY TICKED. I THINK JUST THINK THE PROCESS SHOULD
INCLUDE A POSTCARD NOTIFICATION OR SOME FORM OF NOTIFICATION.
AGAIN, JUST OUT OF COURTEOUS, AND PEOPLE MAY BE DELIGHTED OR
QUESTION AND WANT TO BE PART OF A BIGGER PROCESS. MY QUESTION
THAT COMES TO MIND, IS THIS WHAT THE PORT PROCESS WAS? OF COURSE,


PAGE 65

Jun 28, 2020

THE PORT WAS AN OLD NAME OF THAT AREA. SO, IT ISN'T THE SAME.
NOTIFICATION SEEMS TO ME TO BE A MISSING STEP OF ALL THE RESIDENTS
OF WHAT THEY THINK IS THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT'S WHAT I
RECOMMEND. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN EXERCISED HER CHARTER RIGHT.
WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT POLICY ORDER. POLICY ORDER 5. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 5).

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I THINK I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN
I FIRST STARTED TO WORK FOR THE CITY TO REALIZE THERE WAS NO REMOTE
WORK POLICY, NO WORK FROM HOME POLICY AT ALL. THAT WAS TRUE
BEFORE COVID AND CERTAINLY COVID HAS FORCED US ALL TO THINK ABOUT
WORKING FROM HOME AND REMOTE WORK. AND SHOWN THAT WE CAN
WORK REMOTELY. I'M IN MY BEDROOM RIGHT NOW, PERFORMING MY
WORK FUNCTION. I'M OFTEN IN MY KITCHEN OR IN MY DINNING ROOM AND
MANY OF THE WORKSTATIONS. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE CITY DIDN'T
HAVE A REMOTE WORK FROM HOME POLICY IN PLACE NOW THAT COVID HAS
EBBED AND PEOPLE ARE RETURNING TO WORK, THERE IS NO FLEXIBLE WORK
FROM HOME POLICY.

POLICY ORDER #2
City Council endorsement of
the Agassiz Neighborhood
name being changed to the
Baldwin Neighborhood in
honor of Maria L. Baldwin.
CHARTER RIGHT
EXERCISED BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN IN
COUNCIL JUNE 28, 2021

THE WORK FROM HOME POLICY THAT WENT OUT THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR
EMPLOYEES NOW UNTIL SEPTEMBER IS INCREDIBLY NARROW. YOU EITHER
HAVE TO BE EITHER IN ISOLATION YOURSELF, IN QUARANTINE YOURSELF,
HAVE A MEDICAL CONTINUE OR CHILDCARE ISSUES, THAT IS DIRECTLY
RELATED TO COVID 19. ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU ARE REQUESTING THE THEY
ARE FULLY REMOTE OPTION. NO PARTIAL REMOTE OPTION, WORK 42 FROM
HOME ON FRIDAY, MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY, THIS IS FULLY REMOTE
POLICY. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE CITY REQUIRES THAT THE CITY CAN
REQUEST PHOTOS OF THE EMPLOYEE'S WORK AREA TO VERIFY SUITABILITY.
EMPLOYEES CAN ONLY WORK FROM THE DESIGNATED WORK LOCATIONS. I
THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WORK FROM HOME AND REMOTE POLICIES,
PARTICULARLY COMING OUT OF COVID, IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY, REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A FLEXIBLE OPTION FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.
A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE MOVING VERY TOWARDS COMPANIES THAT HAD
REMOTE WORK AND FLEXIBLE WORK OPTIONS BEFORE COVID, THEY ARE
CERTAINLY MOVING TO MORE FLEXIBILITY. MY CONCERN IS, IF WE DO NOT
HAVE SOMETHING FLEXIBLE AND QUICKLY FOR OUR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE
STILL RECOVERING FROM COVID AND THE PANDEMIC, EMPLOYEES THAT
PROVIDE CHILDCARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MAY NEVER HAD THE KIDS
IN DAY CARE, IT IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO COVID, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
A PLACE FOR THEIR CHILD.
I'M CONCERNED THAT IF THERE ARE OTHER MORE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS OUT
THERE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, WE DON'T HAVE A REMOTE WORK FROM
HOME POLICY OF FLEXIBLE POLICY, WE'LL LOSE OUR VAST AND BRIGHTEST.
LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETAIN THEM AND LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
ATTRACT GREAT EMPLOYEES WHO MAY WANT TO HAVE THAT OPTION TO


PAGE 66

Jun 28, 2020

WORK FROM HOME ON THURSDAYS FOR A CHILDCARE OR PARENTAL CARE
ISSUE. I THINK WE ALSO REALLY SHOULD LOOK AT A FLEXIBLE WORK FROM
HOME SCHEDULE IF WE THINK ABOUT MEETING CLIMATE GOALS AND BEING
A LEADER, 25% OF THE TIME ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES CAN WORK FROM HOME
WILL WORK FROM HOME TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OF TRAFFIC AND GREENE
HOUSE EMISSIONS. THERE ARE REASONS THAT THE CITY SHOULD LOOK FOR
FLEXIBLE WORK SOLUTION NOW, RATHER THAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
HAS BEEN A COMMITTEE THAT IS GOING TO CONVENE TO EXAMINE THE
FEASIBILITY OF REMOTE SCHEDULE. WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE THE
RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL JANUARY OF 2022.
THAT'S SIX MONTHS FROM NOW. THIS ORDER IS REALLY TO ASK THE CITY
MANAGER AND THE PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT TO LOOK FOR AND
IMPLEMENT FLEXIBLE PERMANENT REMOTE WORK POLICIES FOR CITY
EMPLOYEES WHO CAN PERFORM TASKS REMOTELY. AND REALLY THINK
ABOUT A CLIMATE SURVEY OF SENDING THOSE OUT TO THE EMPLOYEES AND
FIND OUT, HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WANT A MORE FLEXIBLE WORK OPTION. I
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M SAYING EMPLOYEES WANT TO WORK FIVE
DAYS A WEEK FROM HOME, I'M SAYING WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE
PANDEMIC, THAT WORKING FROM HOME IS A GREAT OPTION IF YOU CAN DO
IT. IF YOU CAN DO IT AND SERVE THE RESIDENTS. I'M IN MY HOUSE, IN MY
BEDROOM, I SERVE THE RESIDENTS AND DOING IT WELL, I THINK, I THINK
EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC
AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT A WORK/LIFE BALANCE LOOKS LIKE. YOU KNOW
AND YOU KNOW, OUR EMPLOYEES ANSWER EMAILS ALL HOURS OF THE DAY
ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, WHEN WE SEND REQUESTS, RESIDENTS SEND
REQUESTS. THE REALITY IS, OUR EMPLOYEES WORK FROM HOME. THEY
DON'T HAVE A FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE THAT IS CODIFIED, THAT IS
ALLOWED BY THE CITY ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS REALLY FOR US AS A BODY
TO SAY TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATION, LOOK AT A MORE FLEXIBLE WORK
SCHEDULE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. AND THE SOONER THE BETTER. I'M
CONCERNED WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN CITY EMPLOYEES
THAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR 16 MONTHS THAT HAVE BEEN DOING AN
INCREDIBLE JOB FOR THE RESIDENTS FROM THE KITCHENS, BEDROOMS, AND
BACK PORCHES. I'M CONCERNED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A FLEXIBLE WORK
SCHEDULE AND WE WANT TO ATTRACT THE GREAT CANDIDATES, WHAT
WOULD MAKE THEM WANT TO COME TO THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IF THEY
CAN GO TO A PRIVATE SECTOR JOB OR ANOTHER MUNICIPAL JOB THAT HAS A
MORE FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT IT.
SO, THIS IS REALLY JUST ASKING THE CITY MANAGER TO LOOK AT A MORE
FLEXIBLE PROGRAM AND ASK FOR A SURVEY OF THE EMPLOYEES TO SEE HOW
WIDESPREAD THE DESIRE IS TO HAVE A MORE FLEXIBLE WORK FROM HOME
POLICY. I HOPE THAT I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND MAYOR
SIDDIQUI FOR JOINING ME ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT POLICY ORDER. I
HOPE THAT OUR COLLEAGUES CAN SUPPORT US ON THIS. THANK YOU,
MADAM MAYOR, I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR

Jun 28, 2020

ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS
AND I WILL ECHO EVERYTHING SHE SAID ABOUT THE IDEA OF BEING
RESPONSIVE TO EMPLOYEE NEEDS. THE KIND OF WORK SCHEDULES THAT
WORK FOR PEOPLE DO NOT EVER HAVE TO IMPEDE THE PRODUCTIVITY. 30
YEARS AGO WHEN JOB SHARING WAS THE RAGE, IT WILL RUIN THINGS, WHEN
IT CREATED DEDICATED EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IT GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
HAVE A WORK/LIFE BALANCE THAT MANY JOBS DO NOT. THIS ORDER
ALLOWS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOMETHING WE HAD A TRIAL OF,
WHICH IS THE LAST YEAR OF WORKING REMOTELY FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE.
AND THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING AS THE VICE MAYOR MALLON SAID
ELOQUENTLY, ATTRACTING THE BEST PEOPLE AND RETAINING THEM AND
BEING A 21ST CENTURY IT IS 2021, AN EMPLOYER TO MAKE SURE WE ARE
ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE WORKERS WHO WE HOPE TO ATTRACT THE KIND
OF JOBS THEY HOPE TO BE IN. I'M REALLY GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS. I HOPE
WE MOVE IT FORWARD AND REITERATE THE POINT THAT VICE MAYOR
MALLON MADE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET IN PLACE BECAUSE IN THE FALL
THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY WHEN SOME EXISTING TEMPORARY VERY RIGID
DEFINITION OF HOW YOU CAN WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME GO AWAY.
THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH
VICE MAYOR MALLON AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S COMMENTS. WORKING AS
A SOFTWARE ENGINEER, I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE FOR DECADES TO WORK
FROM HOME WHEN NEEDED AND AVOIDING TRAFFIC JAMS AND INCREASING
MY PRODUCTIVITY BY BEING ABLE TO SPEND LESS TIME GETTING TO WORK
AND SPENDING MORE TIME DOING THE WORK.
I DO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERY JOB POSITION IS AMENDABLE TO THAT. I
THINK IN THOSE SITUATIONS, WHERE PEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT WORK FROM
HOME, WE SHOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS SO THAT
OUT OF FAIRNESS TO THEM FOR DOING THE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN'T BE
DONE FROM HOME OR ON A MORE FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE, BUT A LOT OF THE
WORK THAT OUR STAFF ARE DOING, NOW THANKS TO TECHNOLOGY AND SO
ON, IT CAN BE DONE FROM HOME. IT IS DEFINITELY TIME THAT WE ADJUST
OUR PRACTICES ACCORDINGLY. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS ORDER. THANK YOU
TO THE MOTION MAKERS TO BRING THIS FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL BEFORE
WE ADOPT? HEARING NONE, WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.

POLICY ORDER #5
That the City Manager is
requested to confer with the
Personnel Department, and
other relevant City
departments to examine and
implement a flexible,
permanent remote work policy
for City employees who can
perform their tasks remotely.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER SIX. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 6). COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR
COSPONSORING. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MAY REMEMBER THIS YOUNG
PERSON, THEY SPOKE VERY PASSIONATELY IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL A FEW
YEARS AGO IN FAVOR OF TREE PROTECTION AS WELL AS SPECIFIC TREE ON
THE HARVARD CAMPUS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO SAVE AT THE TIME. IT IS
REALLY TRAGIC THAT WE LOST THIS VERY PASSIONATE ADVOCATE AT SUCH A
YOUNG AGE. IT WOULD BE REALLY FITTING TO MEMORIALIZE THEM WITH A
TREE PLANTING. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY AND THEY HAVE
IDENTIFIED SEVERAL POTENTIAL LOCATIONS THAT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL
TO THEM. WE'LL WORK WITH DPW AND THE PARKS DEPARTMENT TO MAKE
SURE WE FIND A SUITABLE LOCATION TO PLANT A MEMORIAL TREE.
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE FAMILY WILL BE HOLDING A MEMORIAL
TRIBUTE AND ART EXHIBITION BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO AN ARTIST THAT
WON AN AWARD FOR A PHOTOGRAPH THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE POLICY
ORDER. AND THAT WILL BE AT THE FIRST PARISH ON CHURCH STREET ON
AUGUST 21ST AT NOON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, FOR BRINGING
THIS FORWARD. VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY
CONDOLENCE TO THE FAMILY. I KNOW QUITE A NUMBER OF THEIR FRIENDS
ARE REALLY HURTING RIGHT NOW. IT IS SO AWFUL TO LOSE SUCH A YOUNG
PERSON. I'M GRATEFUL TO FOR PUTTING THIS ORDER IN AND AN EFFORT
TO MEMORIALIZE THIS YOUNG PERSON, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE LEFT BEHIND.
I WILL ADD, I WAS IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE FRIENDS, TRIED TO FIND A
SUITABLE LOCATION FOR A MEMORIAL TREE. AT A SCHOOL SITE, I
UNDERSTAND THEY WENT TO THE KENNEDY LONG FELLOW AND I STARTED
THERE AND TO SEE THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW PROCEDURE WHEN
SOMEONE WANTS TO PLANT A MEMORIAL TREE AT THE SCHOOL
DEPARTMENT. THAT CONVERSATION HAS BEEN STARTED WITH MR.
MALONEY. I CAN SEND YOU ALONG ALL THE CORRESPONDENCE THAT
HAPPENED UP TO NOW SO YOU HAVE IT, IF THAT IS HELPFUL, AS YOU MOVE
FORWARD TO FIND A SUITABLE LOCATION TO MEMORIALIZE THIS YOUNG
PERSON. I YIELD BACK. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NO OTHER HANDS UP, WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL


PAGE 69

Jun 28, 2020

ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 7. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 7).
COUNCILLOR CARLONE, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?

POLICY ORDER #6
That the City Manager is
requested to work with the
DPW and the family to install a
suitable memorial in a
meaningful location, including
a new tree planting, to honor
the life of Luca Gibson.

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. I HAVE BEEN
CONTACTED BY SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE WHO HAD CONDOMINIUM PROBLEMS,
WHERE THERE ARE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OR ROOFING PROBLEMS. AND
THEY CAN'T GET THE FULL BOARD TO VOTE ON SPENDING THE MONEY. MOST
OF THEM ARE AFFORDABLE CONDOMINIUM, IF THERE IS SUCH A THING. I'M
MORE ON THE AFFORDABLE END AND PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO SPEND
MONEY.
THE REASON I WROTE THIS, I USE 86 KIRKLAND AS AN EXAMPLE, WHICH IS
CURRENT, THE PROBLEM IS CURRENT, AND THERE IS SOME SERIOUS
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THE BUILDING SHOULDN'T BE
OCCUPIED IN THE CONDITION IT IS IN. AND THE WOMAN WHO OWNS THE
FIRST FLOOR WANTS TO RENOVATE IT, FIX IT UP, RENT IT OUT AS A BUSINESS
SITE. IT IS RIGHT NEAR SAFNERS. SHE CAN'T DO THAT. AND AFTER EACH OF
THOSE BUILDINGS, GONE TO THE CITY, THEY ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY
CAN'T FORCE SOMEONE TO FIX A SERIOUS STRUCTURAL PROBLEM OR WATER
LEAK PROBLEM.
MANY OF THESE VIOLATION S HAS BEEN SENT. THE ONLY RECOURSE,
HEATHER HOFFMAN QUESTIONED THIS AS SOME COSPONSORS, IS THE CITY
TO SUE THE CONDO ASSOCIATION AND GO TO COURT. AND IF THERE'S A WAY
TO MAKE A STRONGER EFFORTS TO GET THIS RESOLVED BEFORE A YEAR IN
COURT, WE WOULD ALL APPRECIATE THAT, INCLUDING THE RESIDENTS.
I HAVE TALKED TO THE CITY ABOUT THIS. THIS IS ONE SOLUTION. THERE IS
NO STATE LAW THAT PRECLUDES THIS. NOR FEDERAL LAW. YOU WOULD
THINK THERE IS, BUT THERE ISN'T. THIS IS JUST TO ALLOW THE CITY TO GIVE A
BUILDING PERMIT TO THE PERSON THAT WANTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
WITHOUT GETTING A WHOLE BOARD TO APPROVE IT FOR WHATEVER REASON
THEY DON'T WANT TO APPROVE IT. THIS IS A VERIFIABLE STRUCTURAL
PROBLEM WHERE A STATEMENT HAS BEEN SENT AND NOTHING HAS
CHANGED. I HOPE YOU WILL ALL APPROVE IT. ALL IT ASKS IS THAT THE
MANAGER WORK WITH THE CITY SOLICITOR AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS,
INSPECTIONAL SERVICES, TO DEVELOP AN ORDINANCE THAT WILL GIVE THE
CITY THE RIGHT TO DO THIS. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR, AND THANK YOU
TO THE COSPONSORS, INCLUDING YOURSELF, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO MAKE A QUICK
STATEMENT ON THIS POLICY ORDER. IT GOES FOR THE OTHER CONDO POLICY
ORDER 10. MY FAMILY MAY GO THROUGH A CONDO CONVERSION IN THE
FAMILY HOME. I ASK THE COMMISSION ABOUT THIS AND THEY ADVISE I NOT

TAKE PART REGARDING VOTES ON ANY CONDO.AND NOT TAKE PART IN THE
CONVERSATION AND I WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT, EXPLAIN MY VOTE.

>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE
PRESENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: POLICY ORDER NUMBER 8. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 8).
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANKS TO VICE MAYOR
MALLON AND YOURSELF FOR THE WORK ON THIS ISSUE, INCLUDING THE
POLICY ORDER YOU FILED IN APRIL THAT TALKED ABOUT A FEW ASPECTS OF
LIMITATION ON MULTI MEMBER BODIES, INCLUDING STIPENDS AND THANKS
FOR COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN TO SPONSOR THIS. AND THE BODIES ARE
REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN DECISION MAKING POWER, GREAT THAT FOLKS
ARE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME. AND NOT EVERYBODY
(INAUDIBLE)... BE UNPAID AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ENSURING
DIVERSITY, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE REACH THE FOLKS FOR WHOM
UNPAID LABOR IS A CONSIDERATION OR POSSIBILITY. THREE OTHER CITIES IN
MASSACHUSETTS THAT PROVIDE STIPENDS FOR FOLKS THAT SERVE,
MEDFORD, SOMERVILLE, LEOMINISTER, ALONG WITH CHARTER AMENDMENT
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TONIGHT. ENSURE THE BODIES REALLY
REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY, BUT THE TOWN. REACH ALL THE FOLKS THAT WE
NEED TO REACH. AND THE POLICY ORDER ASKS THE CITY MANAGER AND OUR
DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT THE CITIES THAT HAVE STIPEND MODELS AND TO
LOOK AT MULTI MEMBER BODIES AND SEE WHICH REQUIRE THE MOST TIME
AND MOST EFFORT AND LOOK... (INAUDIBLE). WOULD THAT, I WILL YIELD
BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SORRY, COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, YOU WERE
CUTTING IN AND OUT. I THINK I GOT THE GIST. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER
HANDS UP. I THINK WE CAN MOVE TO ADOPT?
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL).

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: POLICY ORDER 10. (READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER
10). I WILL BE BRIEF AND PASS, THE POLICY ORDER LAYS OUT,
MASSACHUSETTS LAW ALLOWS TOWNS AND CITIES TO ADOPT BY 2/3 VOTE
OF THEIR LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODIES, LOCAL ORDINANCE OR BYLAWS
REGULATING CONDO CONVERSION, STRONGER THAN THE OTHERWISE
DIFFER FROM THE STATE LAW AND MANY OF US FOR MANY YEARS TALKED
ABOUT THIS. AND REALLY THE CONCEPT OF THERE WAS A DISPLACEMENT
TASK FORCING, BACK THEN, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN MAYOR
APPOINTED ME CHAIR OF. WE CAME UP WITH A SET OF PRELIMINARY
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A CITY WIDE ORDINANCE AND THIS POLICY ORDER
AND THE DRAFT ORDINANCE LANGUAGE REALLY CARRIES OUT THE INTENDED
RECOMMENDATIONS AND QUESTIONS UP A POTENTIAL ORDINANCE THAT
THE COUNCIL CAN CONSIDER. AND WE HAVE ASKED THE LAW DEPARTMENT,
CDD, AND THE CITY MANAGER HOUSING LIAISON, TO REVIEW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN AWARE AND HAVE
SEEN THE SAME LANGUAGE. THIS IS WORKED ON FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF
MONTHS TO GET TO THIS POINT. I'M HOPEFUL IN THE FUTURE HOUSING
COMMITTEE MEETING AND IN THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE MEETING, WE
CAN DISCUSS AND ADOPT A FUTURE ORDINANCE ON THIS TOPIC.
ACKNOWLEDGE THE COSPONSORS ON THIS, VICE MAYOR MALLON,
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND ESPECIALLY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER,
FOR HIS TEAM AND HIS INPUT AND WORK ON THIS OVER THE PAST FEW
MONTHS. AND ALSO MY CHIEF OF STAFF, WHO REALLY DOES A GREAT JOB OF
PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEHIND THE SCENES. I WILL PASS THIS ON
TO MY COSPONSORS TO SAY A FEW WORDS. I WILL GO TO VICE MAYOR
MALLON, THEN I CAN GO TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND THEN
VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR BEING THE
LEAD SPONSOR AND FOR CHAIRING THE TASK FORCING. THAT HIGHLIGHTED
THIS AS THE NEED IN CAMBRIDGE AND SOMETHING WE COULD ACT ON. THE
CITY'S DATA SHOWS THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN PUSHED OUT OF CAMBRIDGE
BECAUSE OF HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO LIVE HERE AND OVER THE PAST FEW
YEARS AND DECADES, SOME OF THE OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT WE LIKE TO
DO OR CONSIDER ARE PROHIBITED BY STATE LAW. LIKE CONDO CONVERSION
IS NOT ONE OF THEM. WE CAN ENACT ON OUR OWN AS A COUNCIL. THIS
ORDINANCE WOULD APPLY TO BUILDINGS WITH FOUR OR MORE UNITS. IT
COULDN'T APPLY TO SMALLER BUILDINGS AND THAT'S UNDER STATE LAW.
THERE ARE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS UNDER THIS, EVICTION PROTECTIONS,
RE LOCATION ASSISTANCE, REQUIREMENTS THAT TENANT RIGHTS BE
DELIVERED TO THEM IN THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE, I'M GLAD TO HAVE
WORKED ON AND THIS TALK ABOUT IT MORE WITH THE COUNCIL. I WOULD
ADD, THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN FROM CITIES THAT HAD... INCLUDING BOSTON
AND SOMERVILLE, WHICH STRENGTHEN THEIR ORDINANCE. PROVISIONS IN
THE LANGUAGE THAT (INAUDIBLE). I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING
FORWARD WITH IT.

Jun 28, 2020

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOU
FOR THE WORK ON THIS. I KNOW YOU HAD DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF WORK ON THIS THE LAST TERM AND I'M GLAD TO SEE IT COMING
FORWARD TONIGHT. IT IS LONG OVERDUE AS YOU SAID AND AS COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER SAID, I'M GLAD WE MOVE THIS FORWARD. I THINK
THERE WERE GREAT COMMENTS IN PUBLIC COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS
THROUGH EMAIL, I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A LARGER BROADER
CONVERSATION AT THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND THEN MOVING THIS
FORWARD TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE FOR POSSIBLE ORDINATION. IT
HAS A JOURNEY AHEAD OF IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT
CONVERSATION, BUT GLAD TO HAVE THEIR FINALLY GET STARTED TONIGHT.
THANK YOU TO AND YOU TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER FOR
SPEARHEADING THIS AND MOVING FORWARD. I WILL YIELD BACK. THANKS
AGAIN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND ALL THE ONES
WHO WORKED ON THIS. HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. I DID WANT TO
UNDERSTAND, IS THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO IT... IT WASN'T
TOTALLY CLEAR TO ME, MAYBE I DIDN'T READ THE POLICY ORDER CLOSELY
ENOUGH. IS THAT A DRAFT THAT WE'D REVIEW?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GOING TO BE REFERRED TO THE HOUSING
COMMITTEE AND ALSO SAYING TO ASK THE LAW DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS
TO REVIEW IT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: RIGHT. I ASSUME THAT, IT DIDN'T SEEM EXPLICITLY
CLEAR. THIS WAS THE ACTUAL ORDINANCE THAT WOULD BE FOR US IT IS
VERY EXTENSIVE. IT IS QUITE I THINK THOROUGH IN ADDRESSING MANY OF
THE ITEMS THAT WERE LAID OUT. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK WILSON, WE CAN SAY, THIS POLICY ORDER AND
THE ATTACHED ORDINANCE, IF WE CAN MAKE IT MORE CLEAR?
>> MR. CLERK: BASED ON THE ORDER PARAGRAPH, IT WILL SEND THE POLICY
ORDER AND THE ATTACHMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE, HOUSING COMMITTEE,
AND SEND THEM TO THE CITY MANAGER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR. I THINK IT IS CLEAR.
IF THERE IS ANY CLARIFYING LANGUAGE, I'M AMENDABLE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IT IS BEING REFERRED. IT SAYS THE POLICY ORDER,
SOMEONE ASKED ME, IS THIS AN ORDINANCE. I WAS BEING EXPLICITLY
CLEAR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE'S A WHOLE ORDINANCE THAT WAS DRAFTED TO
BE DISCUSSED. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRIEFLY STATE MY
SUPPORT AS WELL. MY THANKS TO YOURSELF AND THE MOTION MAKERS
FOR ALL THE WORK DONE ON THIS. I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING IT IN

DETAIL IN COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY PASSING IT ORDAINING IT SOON SO
WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT OUR TENANTS AND PROTECT THEM EVEN
BETTER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON
THIS. MOVE TO ADOPT?
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTING THE POLICY ORDER:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: PRESENT.

POLICY ORDER #10
That the City Manager is
requested to confer with the
Law Department, Cambridge
Development Department, and
the City Manager’s Housing
Liaison to discuss and advise on
a condominium conversion
ordinance.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: SEVEN IN FAVOR, ONE PRESENT, AND ONE AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 11. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 11). I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN FIRST AND
THEN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES,
AS WE HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENT, A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT WERE
ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS PREFERENCE PERIOD HAVE BEEN DELAYED. THEY WERE
ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS, WHICH IS GOOD, BUT NONE WERE ABLE TO OPEN
DURING THAT TWO YEAR PREFERENCE WINDOW. AND PRIMARILY THAT'S, OF
COURSE, DUE TO COVID. THIS IS ONE SMALL EXAMPLE, ONE APPLICANT HAD
THE HEARING CONTINUED. THEY ARE GOING TO BE DELAYED BY SEVERAL
MONTHS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT.
WITHOUT THE EXTENSION, WE ARE NOT REALLY ABLE TO FULFILL OUR EQUITY
OBJECTIVE THAT LED TO THE ORDINANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOPEFULLY,
MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THIS. ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS A HEARING
IN THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL, THE MAYOR
AND MYSELF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT ON
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE. WE'D BRING THAT FORWARD IN THE ORDINANCE
COMMITTEE MEETING FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE'RE
GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK AT THE MORATORIUM. THE
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE, I TOUCHED UPON THE SUPPORT THAT SHOULD BE
IN PLACE IF WE WANT EE APPLICANTS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED. WE
FOUND THE BIGGEST NEED, IT IS TIME AND ALSO FUNDING. WE CAME INTO
THE PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND THAT MOST EE APPLICANTS DON'T HAVE
THE WEALTH, THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESSIBLE NO STRINGS ATTACHED START

PAGE 74

Jun 28, 2020

UP FUNDING AND MONEY IS WHAT THEY NEED TO PAY THEIR RENT.
OUTFITTING THEIR BUSINESS, PAYING TRAINED STAFF, SECURITY
CONSULTANTS AND THE LIST GOES ON. THE BIGGEST BOOST THE CITY COULD
PROVIDE EES IS TO ENGAGE IN AND LOOK AT AND HELP TO FIND AND
IDENTIFY SOURCES OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM GET OFF THE
GROUND. I HEARD THE TESTIMONY AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE
MORATORIUM SLOWED EVERYBODY DOWN. SO, AS WE GO FORWARD WITH
THIS IDEA OF LOOKING AT THE MORATORIUM WITH A VIEW TOWARD
EXTENDING IT, I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT WE INCLUDE IN THAT LOOK
BACK TWO THINGS. ONE, THERE IS COMMUNITY PROCESS TO TALK TO
PEOPLE THAT ARE STAPLES, THEY HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME. A NUMBER OF
THEM CAME BEFORE THE COUNCIL AND SAID, PLEASE TALK TO US, ENGAGE
US, AND I'M GOING TO HOPEFULLY ASK WE DO THAT IN ADDITION TO NOT
ONLY DISCUSS ABOUT HOW WE CAN EXTEND THE MORATORIUM TO ALLOW
EES TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD, BUT TO FIND OUT THROUGH THE CITY, WHAT
WAYS WE CANNOT NECESSARILY ASK TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE,
BUT IDENTIFY FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES SO THEY CAN FINANCE BY LARGE
CORPORATIONS TO BE ABLE TO STAY STAY IN THE GAME. I WOULD LIKE TO
INTRODUCE THE FOLLOWING, WE EXPLORE, ADDITION TO FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE, THE CITY HELP ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS OBTAIN
I KNOW THERE'S A PROHIBITION ON US DOING IT. FINDING WAYS AS THEY
FIND WAYS FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO ACCESS RESOURCES, TO
OBTAIN DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD, IN ADDITION, THERE BE A
COMMUNITY PROCESS TO HEAR THE VOICES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND
THE SAME WITH THE OTHER LANGUAGE IS THE SAME, SUCH A HEARING TO
TAKE PLACE NO LONGER THAN AUGUST 15, 2021. IF WE DO THIS, TO FIND
MORE TIME FOR THE MORATORIUM, WITHOUT LOOKING AT LOOKING AT
WHAT WAYS OR IDENTIFYING FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND NOT GOING TO
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PROCESS, I THINK
LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MAKE A CLEAR AND CONCISE DECISION. I THINK IT IS
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND A WAY TO LIFT UP THE ECONOMIC
EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS AS POSSIBLE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A
FLUSHED OUT DISCUSSION THROUGH THE ORDINANCE. THE AMENDMENT IS
WE EXPLORE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CITY MAY BE TO HELP ECONOMIC
EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS OBTAIN AS WELL AS HAVING A COMMUNITY
PROCESS THAT ENGAGES THE VOICES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. I YIELD THE
FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. ANY OTHER
HANDS UP ON THIS BEFORE WE MOVE TO ADOPT? JUST TO REMIND THE
PUBLIC, THERE'S PUBLIC COMMENT, THIS IS TO HAVE THE HEARING AND
HAVE A DISCUSSION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I'M OFFERING AN AMENDMENT TO THE ORDER
THAT IS TO EXPLORE WHAT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THE CITY
MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS OBTAIN
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DOES CLERK WILSON HAVE THAT? REPEAT IT FOR THE
CLERK? CLERK WILSON DOESN'T HAVE THAT IN THE EMAIL.

IN THE ORDERED, THE CHAIR OF THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE CONVENE A
HEARING TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF AMENDING THE ORDINANCE TO
EXTEND RIGHT AFTER THE WORD PERIOD. MR. CLERK, TELL ME WHEN YOU
ARE READY?
>> MR. CLERK: YOU ARE GOING IN AND OUT FOR ME.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: TELL ME WHEN YOU ARE READY?

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I CAN GET THAT TO HIM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS HOT IN HERE. WE ARE MELTING.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: SORRY TO HEAR THAT. GO TO THE NEXT SPEAKER
AND LET ME
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. WHILE WE AWAIT THE
LANGUAGE, I THINK I CAUGHT ENOUGH OF THE GIST OF IT TO COMMENT ON
IT. AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE THAT MY
COLLEAGUE IS PROPOSING. I DON'T SEE HOW IT REALLY FITS IN THIS ORDER.
THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE IS NOT THE PROPER BODY TO CONSIDER
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE PUBLIC
COMMENT, AND THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS.
IF MY COLLEAGUE INTENDS FOR A MORE ELABORATE PROCESS THAN THAT,
THAT WOULDN'T BE THE PURVIEW OF THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE. I
WOULD SUGGEST BRINGING A LATE ORDER OR SOME OTHER VEHICLE TO
ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK. I DON'T THINK IT FITS WITH THIS POLICY ORDER.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THAT IS ON THE WAY TO THE CLERK. I DIDN'T
HEAR WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. I'M ASKING, THE MAKER OF THE MOTION,
WE HAVE AN ORDINANCE COMMITTEE THAT WILL LOOK AT, EXTENDING THE
MORATORIUM, I SUPPORT THAT, I'M ASKING IN ADDITION, WE DON'T CLOSE
OFF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND IF WE IDENTIFY
THOSE, PASS THAT INFORMATION ALONG TO THE EES. WE WANT TO HEAR
FROM THE PEOPLE THAT THIS MORATORIUM WAS ORDAINED OR PUT
FORWARD TO SUPPORT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING ALL THAT
WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THE WORK WE PUT FORTH BY ADOPTING THIS
ORDINANCE IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK HAS THE LANGUAGE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: SINCE MY COLLEAGUE DIDN'T HEAR MY
EARLIER COMMENTS, I'M HAPPY TO REPEAT THEM. WHAT I SAID, I
APPRECIATED AND SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE AMENDMENTS, I DON'T
THINK THEY QUITE FIT IN THE POLICY ORDER. THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
DOESN'T HAVE PURVIEW OVER PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE
ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT APPLICANTS. AND THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
WOULD HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THAT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS. IF MY COLLEAGUES IMAGINE A MORE
ELABORATE PROCESS THAN THAT, THAT WOULDN'T BE IN THE PURVIEW
COMMITTEE. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE AN ORDER TO THE CITY MANAGER
TO EXPLORE THE ISSUES RATHER THAN THE ORDINANCE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MADAM MAYOR? I THINK REASONABLE PEOPLE
CAN DISAGREE. IF WE'LL HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND WE DON'T ALLOW THAT
TO BE ON THE TABLE, THEN IT ALSO DOESN'T ALLOW PEOPLE THAT ARE
IMPACTED BY THE WORK WE'RE DOING TO SPEAK TO IT. AND WHAT
WOULDN'T BE A MORE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR. ALL I'M ASKING IS
THAT WE LET THAT CONVERSATION BE A PART OF IT. I DON'T SEE A
