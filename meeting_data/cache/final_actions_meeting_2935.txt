WHEREAS:

The perceived influence of money in politics leads to public mistrust of government on a
federal, state and local level; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Charter gives the City Council strong influence over development,
and campaign donations from applicants give the perception, whether real or imagined, of
favoritism; and

WHEREAS:

The purpose of this proposed ordinance is to put the onus of campaign contribution
accountability on potential donors and not target individual elected officials; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council unanimously approved a policy order on June 10, 2019
requesting that the City Manager instruct the City Solicitor to provide guidance on an
ordinance to reduce or prohibit campaign donations from donors with business dealings
with the City of Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

No such guidance was provided to this date; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council deliberated numerous times on the importance of campaign
finance laws with no meaningful legislation adopted; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council adopt a municipal ordinance to reduce campaign donations where
such contributions might otherwise give the perception of unfair advantage; and be it
further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager instruct the City Solicitor to read the proposed ordinance and
provide feedback on implementation; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the ordinance language below be referred to the Ordinance Committee for
deliberation and discussion

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council has gone on record on numerous occasions in favor of
municipal campaign finance reform and

WHEREAS:

Under current state law, individuals can contribute up to $1,000 per year to municipal
candidates and

WHEREAS:

This $1,000 threshold can create an unfair playing field in municipal elections and

There is a concern that large campaign contributions may lead to unfair access and
influence, regardless of who makes those contribution; and

This policy would not only apply to those having business before the City Council but
would limit campaign contribution to anyone contributing to a City Council campaign;
and

WHEREAS:

To further ensure that there is equal access for all candidates seeking municipal elected
office in the City of Cambridge, the amount a candidate can loan their own campaigns
should be limited to $3,000 per election cycle; therefore, be it

ORDERED:

The Cambridge City Council direct the City Manager to work with the City Solicitor’s
Office to draft a Home Rule Petition that would cap campaign contributions to any
City Council candidate to $200 per person, per year, per candidate and limit candidate
loans to $3,000 per election cycle, and further be it

ORDERED:

That the City Solicitor report back to the Ordinance Committee of the City Council
