From:Jessica De Jesus Acevedo, M.Ed.
Cambridge, MA, 02141
Charter Review Committee Member 2023-2024
To the City of Cambridge Charter Review Committee
City of Cambridge City Council

The City of Cambridge: Plan E Charter Review
Committee Member Testimonial
1/16/2024
To whom this may regard,
First, my name is Jessica De Jesus Acevedo. I am a proud resident, doctoral candidate, realtor,
and minority small business owner in Cambridge. The city and staff have been nothing less than
support and a resource for myself, the children in my program, and our families. As a young
child, I attended a licensed Family Child Care program in the city ("Alba's Daycare"). As an
undergraduate, I returned to start a childcare business to support more children, families, and
early educators. I commit my effort and time to participate in local governance and engage in
diverse committee memberships with all my communities and institutions. Memberships in
committees and public community engagement are essential to developing our future. And
are constitutional and resident rights.
I want to share final reflections as we conclude our Charter Review and begin to create strategic
plans and changes in 2024 and beyond.
Strategic Systems of Inequalities: Many city meetings and plans discuss and critique how
individuals like myself, who are "of color" or a "student," do not participate or engage with our
local government or city council. Too often, in public meetings and spaces, we continue to retract
from the facts of the more extensive matter.
"If it ain't broke, Don't fix it." Mindset & Model: Historically, laws, systems, and practices
have been created to limit diverse individuals not only because of the color of their skin but
also/their age, gender, education, religion, disabilities, socioeconomic status, and familial
structure but also to uphold the affluence and power of the individuals who govern. Too often,
our government needs to make decisions with more input on the more significant impacts of the
community or the specific populations who are, without intent, negatively impacted. Within our
current structure, there needs to be more commitment to consistently engaging and promoting
public participation and feedback in a city-wide and responsive manner. The city continues
outsourcing through nonprofits and hiring consultants to provide community feedback rather
than City Managers and council members, making it a priority and a job requirement to regularly

a

attend local events and meetings and encourage public participation consistently, not only during
times of election or as individuals are rushed for 2 minutes during public comments.
Current Governance: The current structure and governance have and will continue gentrification
in Cambridge. Again, gentrification is "the process whereby the character of a poor urban area
is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses,
typically displacing current inhabitants in the process." As a small business owner and resident,
living costs and operating within the city are almost inconceivable. As our affluent community
and corporations thrive, we have residents, students, and small business owners who cannot
attain or afford food, shelter, housing, and education/childcare. Yet, citizens request more
affordable housing and rental control with no response from elective officials on our everyday
issues. However, most City Council members have been homeowners and/or landlords, making
changes of this nature of a potential conflict of interest.
City of Capitalism: The current government's structure and zoning boards have allowed and
continue to approve developments that have and will continue to change the essence of the
Cambridge neighborhood and culture. Yet, we have residents who need shelter and cannot own
property in communities where their families come from or have started. The gap between
sheltering all individuals is based on dollars rather than resources.
The City of Cambridge reports that the Community Development Department's Housing
Division oversees over 700 affordable rental units throughout the city through its Inclusionary
Housing Program. Rather than creating a city of equal opportunity to live and work, we
continue to put public responsibility on social organizations and away from the public
agencies and officials that govern.
Housing: The city reports that the median prices are based on advertised prices for apartments.
Data excludes affordable and graduate student housing owned by the universities, privatizing the
costs of rent and purchase by large institutions and organizations, not the actual financial
attainability within the community or even the real estate market.
In 2010, the City of Cambridge reported that the median of a single-family was $760,000
compared to 2020 sales of $1,724,000, which is well over a 126% increase within the last ten
years with no expectations of decreasing or becoming more accessible for the people of the city
which will continue to harbor a community of short-term renters and residents unable to
purchase land which will require more public funds and resources at the local and state level.
(Source: Housing Data - CDD - City of Cambridge, Massachusetts (cambridgema.gov) )
Some of our current residents cannot access, purchase, or acquire real estate in the city, which is
illegal. Our state and federal regulations are to uphold and reinforce the following:

The Fair Housing Law: Discrimination in housing is against the law. State and federal
law prohibit discrimination in the sale and rental of housing by property owners,
landlords, property managers, mortgage lenders, and real estate agents. These fair
housing laws make it unlawful to discriminate based on race, color, national origin,

The City of Cambridge must also uphold and dismantle all unlawful policies or practices by law.
Legislation: Our future government and city require elevated representation in Massachusetts
legislation for reform and advancement. The officials who residents vote for have the power and
funding to protect our community through policies geared toward the city's partnerships with
citizens, city officials, schools, small/large businesses, and local policymakers. A robust system
requires policymakers and legislators to advocate for and protect the rights of the people and
enhance the community.
The City of Cambridge has just conducted a Disparity Study (2023) described as a “first” of its
kind. It is unacceptable for the level of funds geared towards developing the city's economic
infrastructure not to conduct research of this nature. According to a recent survey commissioned
by the city of Cambridge, the allocation of funds towards minority- or women-owned businesses
from July 2016 to June 2021 amounted to just over 1% of the total expenditure. This finding
sheds light on the current lack of economic inclusivity within the city and raises essential
questions about the equitable distribution of resources and funds.
The report highlights the ineffectiveness of the city's race- and gender-neutral efforts in
addressing the disparities identified in contracting opportunities. The study reveals the exclusion
of Black-, Hispanic-, and women-owned businesses across various sectors. It sheds light on an
informal network of businesses with privileged access to contracting opportunities within the
city. This closed circle of businesses further perpetuates the exclusion of minority- and
women-owned businesses. While there is some recognition of Hispanic-owned firms in
professional services, the findings emphasize the need for more comprehensive and equitable
policies to ensure fair contracting opportunities for all underrepresented groups.

The City Council structure has refrained from changes, turnovers, and conducting studies to
uphold the committee's power and for the profit of private organizations. Our city falsely
advertises the new diversity and representation among the city council members, but historically,
that has not been the case. Changes are made through reforms and new laws by diverse leaders,
thinkers, educators, and policymakers, including BPOC and individuals with disabilities. It
should not be limited to an unstudied "If it ain't broke, Don't fix it" mindset and model as

proposed by Mayor Simmons and others during testimonials to the Charter Review Committee.
In illustration, Denise Simmons was Massachusetts's first openly black lesbian female mayor in
2008 and the first black female mayor in Massachusetts. Mayor Simmons has been a leader and
advocate for change in the City of Cambridge since 2002, and she is currently serving her 12th
term. However, one primary person of color or diverse background does not represent
thousands or a fair democratic government structure. The City of Cambridge, Massachusetts
Disparity Study (2023) recommended the following:
RECOMMENDATION 8: DATA REFORM GSPC encountered several challenges in
collecting data for this Study. The City recommends implementing the following data
reforms to track and monitor the other program recommendations properly:
• Vendor System/ File: Include ethnicity, gender, and other certifications.
Currently, the vendor system does not track ethnicity, only certification (MBE or
WBE).
• Bid Tabs: Create a database for bid tabs readily available to the City. This will
allow bid tabs to be extracted promptly and provide columns such as bid number,
date append, date closed, vendor info, and project details. This would also
consolidate multiple Excel or PDF files currently hosting this information.
Without question, as a millennial Hispanic resident and small business owner, I view our city as
using political practices, public funds, and people to uphold oppressive policies.
Leading the future into 2044: As I continue to celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King
Jr., I reflect on the progress and changes that have been made to ensure fairness, equal
opportunity, and safety for all. Yet, as a BPOC resident, I also sit in meetings, like the Charter
Review, where affluent residents and stakeholders continue to use the same narrative when
describing individuals within the city, primarily BPOC, not present in the meeting, often
described as "unengaged" or "not caring," which is unprofessional, unempathetic, and
undermines all the hard-working students, parents, and families of our city, black or white. It also
allows individual officials to strategically make changes, decisions, and investments without the
full scope of voices or perspectives of particularly low-income and working residents. This
violates our First Amendment right for these individuals to use their freedom of speech during
public meetings.
I acknowledge that public meetings must be announced and advertised by state laws, yet not all
residents receive notification or attend. Public announcements via emails or electronic
methods do not ensure that all public members are informed or notified of the meeting or
its relevance, especially individuals who may not have internet technology or subscribe to
the city newsletter or website. Therefore, new policymakers could significantly amend our
current structures, such as possible law violations in public meetings, change the nonexistent
engagement, increase voting, and embed communication with diverse residents and students in
Cambridge. In sum, the City of Cambridge requires change and reform based on hours of Charter

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

Review discussion, presentations, review, and professional/personal reflection. Our current
structure needs more diverse and adequate representation with the limitation of a policymaking
branch or legislator.
A Mayor-CFO form of government allows individuals to vote for their policymaker(s),
empowers diverse representation and leadership, and, more importantly, allows for real-time
changes in public policies that negatively impact citizens, including education, housing, safety,
and employment. The City of Cambridge must uphold equal opportunity for residents and
(undocumented) residents to work, live, and thrive.
The City of Cambridge has become a global hub for large organizations, higher education,
high-end real estate, and home to changemakers from past and future generations. We open our
doors to the borders, support social movements, and advocate for human beings near and far. We
have often led historical changes in education, technology, laws, practices, and humanitarian
efforts. Old Cambridge will never look the same, nor will the people or the community. The City
of Cambridge requires new leadership and changes that honor and uphold our city's
essence and hear the people's cries, not in times of shootings or emergencies, but now.
I would like to formally thank the City of Cambridge, the City Council, the Mayor, the City
Manager, UMASS Collins Center for Public Management, the City Clerk, and the Charter
Review committee members and city staff for their time, participation, and support through the
review of Plan E. All members of the public, especially the individuals who took time to provide
us feedback online or in person through this committee appointment.
Thank you for taking the time to read my testimonial and considerations.
Sincerely,
Jessica De Jesus Acevedo

To Mayor Simmons, Vice-Mayor McGovern, and the Honorable City Council:

1.

It is my privilege to submit the final report of the Cambridge Charter Review Committee to the
Cambridge City Council.
The Charter Review Committee convened thirty-six times in open meetings between August 2022 and
January 2024 for the purpose of considering changes to the Cambridge City Charter.

FT

Regarding the most fundamental aspect of the Charter, whether to amend Cambridge's existing form of
government or propose a different form of government, the Committee was not able to come to an
agreement of two-thirds of its members, as required by the ordinance that established the Committee.

R

A

The Committee did, however, reach two-thirds agreement regarding certain aspects of government
common to both the Council/Manager and Mayor/CAFO/Council forms of government. The Committee’s
areas of agreement included a codified goal-setting process for city council, expanding voter eligibility
regarding age and citizenship, moving local elections to align with state and national elections, refining
Proportional Representation to reflect modern tabulation methods, and, of particular note, the innovative
addition to government structure of a randomly selected Resident Assembly that would be tasked with
consideration of Cambridge’s most controversial issues.

D

The Committee agreed that city councillors should continue to be elected city-wide to two year terms
through a system of Proportional Representation and that a Strong Mayor (if that system prevailed) should
be elected through RCV (Ranked Choice Voting with STV (Single Transferable Vote) tabulation to a four
year term.
The Committee recommended several additional forms of resident involvement, such as recall of the
Mayor (under the Strong Mayor system) and Resident Initiative Petitions to bring matters before the
Council or directly to the voters.
Finally, the Committee identified a number of items for consideration in future Charter Review
Committees.

It is not the responsibility of the Chair to analyze the patterns, the reasons or the circumstances around the
divergence of opinion on the Charter Committee. However, I would like to offer my personal observation,
derived from the public input we received in various formats, that the residents of Cambridge, like the
members of the Charter Review Committee, are of mixed opinions about whether Cambridge should
retain (with some revisions) its current Council/Manager system of government or switch to a
Mayor/CAFO/Council system.

1.

17

In other words, I believe that the opinions of our diverse Committee are a general reflection of the
division of popular opinion in the citizenry that has participated in our meetings and other resident
engagement activities…with the important caveat that it appears that, at this point in time, despite our
outreach, which included a mailing to every household in Cambridge, a City of Cambridge webpage
devoted to Charter Review, more than thirty public meetings virtual and in-person, and social media
efforts, most Cambridge residents are not engaged in, or even aware of, the issue of Charter Reform. Most
are unaware that a re-structuring of the government is even being contemplated. When the City Council
takes up the issue in 2024 and when, eventually, the issue is about to be put to the voters, hopefully there
will be robust discussion and debate among a broader set of Cambridge residents.
Yours sincerely,

FT

Introduction
To:
Cambridge City Council
From: The Cambridge Charter Review Committee
Date: January __, 2024
The Cambridge Charter Review Committee is pleased to present our final recommendations regarding
revisions or replacements to the Cambridge City Charter. These include the proposed new modernized
charter text. This report, which we endorse, is a reflection of our deliberations.

17

The city's charter is the foundation of Cambridge city government, outlining the structure, powers, and
responsibilities of our government and its elected officials. Early in our deliberations, we voted
unanimously to draft a new city charter, moving beyond the Plan E form and outdated gender-biased
language, to modernize and clarify our city's governing document.

A
FT

1.

The final report results from 18 months of Committee meetings, deliberations, interviews, community
engagement, and public comment. The Committee held 36 public Committee meetings, heard over 250
written and verbal public comments, attended community meetings, hosted four public forums,
interviewed former and current elected officials and staff, and dedicated numerous hours of hard work and
consideration.
Below is an overview of each section of the final report

Introduction Letter
This introduction letter serves as a preamble to the report, a brief overview of the Committee's purpose
and scope, an explanation of the final report, and details of what is in each section.

Form of Government Statements and Related Recommendations
As previously stated, the Committee did not come to a formal, super-majority recommendation on the
question of form of government. This section, however, provides two statements, one from the eight
Committee members supporting the Mayor/CAFO/Council form of government and one from the seven
Committee members supporting the Council/Manager form of government. The section also includes
details of votes related solely to either of those respective forms of government.

Charter Text Mayor/CAFO/Council & Charter Text Manager/Council
This section provides proposed draft charter text for each form of government, Council/Manager and
Mayor/CAFO/Council. Because Cambridge had a plan form charter (dating back to early 1900), the
Committee knew it was necessary, in addition to highlighting the Committee's recommendations, to
include the recommendations in the context of a modern charter format and text. These draft texts include
some boilerplate text that provides context for the framing and substantive decisions set within a modern
charter text. Highlighted are the sections that reflect Committee votes

Items for Future Charter Review Committee Consideration
Because this charter review was the first review since the adoption of the charter in 1940, and because the
complete scope of topics covered by a modern charter was greater than the Committee's capacity and time
allotted, there were some topics for voting systems and campaign finance, that could not receive the full
attention and expert consultation that is merited. While the Committee addressed many relevant charter
topics, it has identified several important issues that the next charter review Committee could take up.

Proposed Modern Charter Overview

17

Cambridge’s current “Plan E” charter (see Appendix H) was written by the Massachusetts General Court
(Massachusetts state legislature) in the first half of the twentieth century as one of the charter templates
offered to Massachusetts cities. Now, after roughly 100 years, there are only 12 of these “Plan” charters
left operating in Massachusetts (and only one other “Plan E” charter). Cambridge’s Plan E charter consists
of seven pages of Massachusetts general law text. It lacks an accessible format and substance to properly
inform the public of Cambridge’s government structure and operations. As a document that is supposed to
be the foundation of our government, it does not meet the moment. For that reason, the first decision as a
Committee was to recognize that, independent of how members felt about what should replace it, the
current charter text no longer works for Cambridge in 2024. A modern form and structured charter would
better serve Cambridge’s government and residents.

Key Recommendations for New Charter
The following proposed changes to the Cambridge City Charter are a result of extensive deliberation,
comparative research, community engagement, insights from current and previous Cambridge elected
officials, background from city employees, best practices across Massachusetts, and innovative structures
in the U.S. and internationally, as well as experiences of individual Committee members. In addition, the
Committee decided to focus on a set of values to frame its deliberations.

17

Equity and Enfranchisement: Prioritizing fairness and inclusion ensures that all community
members can fully participate in and with their city government.
Participation in and Accessibility of Government: Focusing on enhancing citizen engagement
and making government processes more accessible and understandable to the diverse population
of Cambridge.

1.

Government Effectiveness: Striving for efficiency and efficacy in the functioning of government
institutions to better serve the community's needs.

A
FT

Responsiveness and Accountability: Build a structure promoting responsiveness and
accountability, ensuring that the government remains attentive and answerable to the needs and
concerns of its residents.

D

R

The following recommendations have at least two-thirds of the Committee’s support, demonstrating a
solid consensus among Committee members and meeting the requirements outlined in the ordinance
(Appendix B). These changes are recommended separately from the form of government. These
recommendations are not arbitrary but result from thoughtful Committee deliberations.

Expand Enfranchisement and Equity
The Committee examined elections and representation in Cambridge and sought paths to foster more
inclusive and equitable city elections, and increase voter engagement in city elections. The Committee's
recommendations aim to empower marginalized voices, increase election participation, and preserve the
unique strengths of Cambridge's election method and composition of elected bodies.

17

1. Maintain an At-Large city council elected by Proportional Representation. The Committee
engaged in deliberations regarding the composition and election method of the City Council.
Emphasis was placed on the strengths inherent in Cambridge's distinctive at-large, proportionally
representative model.

1.

During the discussion, the Committee considered the potential benefits of district representation,
acknowledging the community's expressed desire for more direct communication paths and
accountability. After careful consideration, the Committee concluded that alternative solutions
outside the city charter, such as neighborhood liaisons, could effectively address the identified need
for accountability. Two-thirds of the Committee voted to uphold the existing at-large, proportionally
representative model for the City Council. (See Section 2-1(a))

A
FT

Community Feedback: The Committee heard numerous comments from residents regarding their
preference for and against the at-large proportional representation model. Some residents and a few
former elected officials expressed a desire for district-based councillors, emphasizing the
advantages of clear communication channels and geographic accountability. Advocates for district
representatives argued that it would foster closer connections between elected officials and their
specific constituencies. The Committee also received significant feedback supporting the all-at-large
system. Those favoring the current system highlighted its benefits for city-wide groups whose
interests and causes transcend geographic boundaries.

Representation system in Cambridge elections.
Yes – 13, No – 0, Absent – 2

D

A motion for the Committee to recommend Cambridge maintain an at-large city council of nine
members.
Yes – 11, No – 1, Present - 1, Absent – 0

2. Enfranchise non-citizens in municipal elections. The Committee engaged in discussions
regarding the enfranchisement of non-citizens, allowing them to both vote and run for municipal
elections. The Committee recognized the significance of this proposal in fostering inclusivity and
civic participation amoung all the residents of Cambridge. Many other municipalities in
Massachusetts have submitted home rule petitions to the State Legislature seeking to enfranchise
non-citizens in local elections, including Cambridge. (See Sections 2-1(a & c) & 4-1(a & c) & 7-2)

3. Enfranchise 16- and 17-year-olds in municipal elections. The Committee also discussed lowering
the voting age in municipal elections to 16 years old, a change other municipalities have petitioned
the Massachusetts state legislature to allow. The Committee noted the benefits of establishing early
voting habits, and some Committee members emphasized the benefits of civic engagement and the
potential for enhanced political awareness among individuals at this age. The Committee also
discussed recommending lowering the age requirement to 16 to be eligible to run for municipal
office but did not reach two-thirds support. (See Sections 2-1(a) & 4-1(a) & 7-2)

4. Move municipal elections to even years. The Committee expressed concern over the low voter
turnout in local elections. Although higher than most Massachusetts municipalities, only 30% of
Cambridge's registered voters typically turnout in municipal elections. The Committee discussed
tactics to increase voter turnout and engagement in local elections. As documented from cities in
CA, TX, and MD, turnout often doubles by aligning local elections with higher-profile election
years (even-year cycles), such as those for state and federal offices. In the most recent even-year
elections, Cambridge saw a 75% turnout in 2020 and 52% in 2022. (See Section 7-1)
Community Feedback: The Committee received several comments in support of even-year
elections, noting the potential benefits for voter turnout.
Vote
A motion to hold municipal elections in even numbered years.
Yes – 13, No – 0, Absent – 2

5. Create more flexibility and modernize election voting and tabulation methods in charter
language. The Committee acknowledged the necessity to modernize and refine the election
language in the Charter, recognizing that Cambridge's current reliance on an antiquated state statute
with specific and outdated limitations hinders the city's electoral processes. The existing statute
permits proportional representation but imposes constraints, for instance, on tabulation methods,
that no longer align with the dynamic and evolving needs of the community. In light of this, the
Committee recommends that the City Council and election commission collaborate to update the
language and create more flexibility.(See Sections 7-4 & 7-5)

A motion to recommend election procedure language be changed to authorize the City to use any
tabulation method.

Participation in and Accessibility of Government for all Residents
The Committee prioritized enhancing participation and accessibility of the city government for all
residents. Hearing from the Cambridge community, the residents were eager for more accessible methods
of engaging with their elected officials and city employees and creating city priorities. Seeking
opportunities to cultivate a more inclusive and equitable civic engagement experience, the Committee
prioritized adding opportunities for thoughtful public feedback in multiple areas of the charter, expanding
requirements around tracking and publishing council actions, and developing a framework for a Resident
Assembly (representative lottery selected panel) to tackle critical city topics.

1.

17

1. Require a Resident Assembly in the Charter. A Resident Assembly is a lottery-selected panel
and a democratic system designed to address challenging policy issues governments face.
Panelists, drawn from the general population, are tasked with a critical question or city issue and
are supported with stakeholder engagement and education. The assembly deliberates,
collaborates, and makes specific recommendations for the city. The Committee envisions that the
Resident Assembly will bring new voices into city government and generate community-driven
concepts and solutions. (See Section 8-4)

A
FT

Should Cambridge adopt this Resident Assembly proposal, Cambridge would be the first
municipality in the United States to codify such a structure in a city charter. The Committee spent
extensive time discussing the intention, structure, and goals for a Resident Assembly in
Cambridge. The Committee recommended that the City Council convene at least one assembly
per term, offer adequate compensation to the panelists, and identify specific powers or decisions
that the assembly could be tasked with. The Committee acknowledged that this would be a brand
new civic structure in Cambridge and that specifics regarding the selection process, operational
requirements, and best practices will evolve and require additional definition.

R

Community Feedback: Early on, the committee had heard from the public an interest in more
collaborative city government and a desire for increased opportunities for engagement. In the
development and deliberations of establishing a resident assembly, the Committee received
positive feedback from the community and several city councillors.

D

Votes
A motion that the Committee recommend to establish a Resident Assembly in the Charter
Yes – 12, No – 0, Absent – 3
Motion to approve the Purpose section (section 1) language of the Resident Assembly draft to

discussed options for a public tool for tracking proposed policy orders, voting status, and actions
taken by the executive branch to implement approved orders. (See Section 3-2(t) & 10-9)

Effectiveness of Government
The Committee’s recommendations aim to build on Cambridge's current strengths as a regional leader
while introducing measures for a more effective government. To address community concerns, the
recommendations focus on establishing a clear process for strategic vision planning that anticipates future
challenges.

17

1. Measurable goal-setting. The Committee emphasized the need for measurable goal-setting to
establish a clear vision and a strategic plan for the city. Recognizing the absence of a clearly
defined and comprehensive strategic vision, Committee members, as well as former elected
officials and members of the public, expressed concerns about the prevalence of numerous
council orders unrelated to any previously identified priorities. The Committee acknowledged the
necessity of creating a structured vision for the city to guide elected officials in their
decision-making processes.

A
FT

1.

The proposed approach involves the implementation of measurable goal-setting once a term
during the first half of the first year of the city council's term. This strategic planning session a
crucial opportunity to frame priorities for the budget, providing a roadmap for the remainder of
the term. The Committee also recognized the importance of community involvement in this
process, providing an opportunity for residents to contribute feedback and share their priorities
for the city. (See Sections 2-3(b)(iv), 2-11 & 3-1(f)).
Community Feedback
Community feedback highlighted the perceived unstructured nature of council measures, and
pressed the need to organize council priorities into overarching goals for the city. Many residents
expressed frustration with the perceived lack of defined goals within the City Council,
emphasizing the need for a more structured and strategic approach as well for a better-defined
collective political vision.

2. Maintain 2-year terms for city councillors. The Committee extensively deliberated on the term
length for city councillors, ultimately recommending maintaining 2-year terms. The committee
thoroughly discussed the benefits of maintaining this term length, emphasizing its capacity to
hold councillors directly accountable to voters biennially. Almost all Massachusetts
municipalities with a population over 50,000 have 2-year terms for city councillors. The
Committee determined this term length was appropriate for Cambridge, ensuring more frequent
opportunities for voters to express their preferences and align the city's leadership with evolving
community dynamics. (See Section 2-1(b))

14

a

In a related decision, the Committee chose not to pursue a recall provision for city councillors.
The rationale behind this decision was anchored in the acknowledgment that the 2-year term
serves as a mechanism for accountability. The frequency of elections under the 2-year term
eliminates the need for a recall provision, as voters can express their approval or disapproval in
elections. It makes a recall provision operationally difficult, given the short time window.

1.

17

Community Feedback
Community feedback on the topic of maintaining 2-year terms for city councillors was somewhat
mixed. Supporters of the 2-year term emphasized its role in keeping elected officials directly and
frequently accountable to the voters. They highlighted the opportunity it provides for new
individuals to enter city council positions. Other community members expressed support for
longer terms, citing the need to give councillors more time to adjust and advance legislative
agendas between campaign seasons. Concerns were raised that longer terms might discourage
potential candidates from running due to the extended commitment required.

Responsiveness and Accountability
In relation to the Committee’s value of Responsiveness and Accountability, the Committee has
proactively endorsed a series of recommendations to strengthen accountability to residents. The proposed
inclusion of a defined timeline for the budget process, coupled with establishing a formalized annual
budget meeting and a process for city council budget priorities in the fall, seeks to enhance budget
transparency and strategic planning. Additionally, the Committee recommends a significant change to the
budgetary framework, granting the City Council the authority to add or increase line items.

17

To bolster resident engagement, two provisions new to Cambridge—the Resident Initiative Petition and
Group Petition—are recommended. The former allows residents to bring forth new legislation, while the
latter enables residents to prompt a city council hearing on a specific topic.

1.

Finally, the Committee recommends forming a Campaign Finance Study Committee, dedicated to
exploring avenues for implementing new programs or funding regulations.

A
FT

1. Defined budget process + City Council Budget Priorities. Currently, Cambridge's budget
process and timeline are defined by Massachusetts General Law, which requires the budget to be
submitted 170 days from the beginning of the year (~June 20) and allows the City Council 45
days to approve said budget. The Committee discussed comprehensively the budget process and
options to formally empower Cambridge's City Council with more substantial input early in the
budget process. Increasing collaborations between the executive and the City Council on the
development of the budget was a critical deliberation point for the Committee.

R

Recognizing the importance of early and defined input from elected officials, the Committee
proposed additions to the budget process. These additions include introducing a codified annual
budget meeting, delineating a straightforward process for the City Council to identify and
communicate its budget priorities, and incorporating additional public input opportunities in the
fall. These proposed steps aim to foster transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration in the city's
budgetary decision-making process. (See Sections 6-2 - 6-6)

D

Proposed Timeline
➔ Fiscal Year: begin on July 1 and end on June 30 (current practice by Massachusetts
General Law)
➔ Annual Budget Meeting: At least by Nov 1
➔ City Council Budget Priorities: by end of Calendar year (following annual budget
meeting)
➔ Submission of Budget: At least by May 1

2. City Council Power to Add or Increase Line Items in the Budget. The Committee had several
primary goals in their deliberations on potential changes to the budget process: increased
transparency, increased public engagement, and increased the City Council's role in creating the
budget. Looking at Boston's recent charter change, which allows the City Council to add or
increase line items in addition to the current state law that only allows the City Council to reduce
or eliminate budget line items, the Committee voted to recommend under either form of
government the City Council be allowed to increase or add items to the budget. This is in addition
to a formalized process for the City Council to establish and share the budget priorities for the
upcoming budget with the chief executive.. (See Section 6-5(b))

3. Enshrine Resident Initiative Provision. The Committee, in its commitment to enhancing public
engagement and participation in Cambridge city government, engaged in thorough deliberations
on the introduction of a Resident Initiative Petition provision to the city charter. Currently lacking
formal participation mechanisms, this provision would empower residents to initiate change by
collecting signatures to petition the City Council to pass a specific ordinance. If the ordinance
fails to secure approval from the City Council, the provision outlines additional steps for
residents. They may collect further signatures to place the proposed ordinance on the ballot for
Cambridge voters to decide its implementation. (See Section 8-6).

4. Enshrine Group Petition Provision. The Committee, attuned to the community's call for
increased paths for direct community participation, thoroughly considered the proposal to
enshrine a Group Petition Provision in the city's charter. This provision would empower a group
of residents to collect signatures on a specific issue, compelling the City Council to hold a public
hearing on the matter. Recognizing the importance of fostering mechanisms that amplify
residents' voices, the Committee prioritized direct resident engagement. The Committee
expressed a shared conviction in the value of establishing a democratic process that allows
residents to actively contribute to shaping the city's discourse. The Committee acknowledged and
agreed with the community's desire for increased avenues of participation and its commitment to
fostering a more inclusive decision-making framework.

A
FT

Similar to the resident initiative petition process, the City Council is expected to collaborate with
the Election Commission to determine the specific thresholds for signature collection, ensuring
that they are reasonable and attainable. This collaborative effort is essential to fine-tune the
implementation of the Group Petition Provision, ensuring its effectiveness in providing a
meaningful platform for residents to engage with civic matters and have their voices heard. (See
Section 8-5).

5. Campaign Finance Study Committee. The Committee deliberated extensively on ways to
alleviate the financial burdens associated with campaigning in Cambridge while fostering greater
diversity among candidates. Recognizing the absence of public financing options in
Massachusetts, as constrained by state regulations, the Committee identified the need for a
dedicated study Committee. This study Committee aims to explore potential programs for
Cambridge, such as a voucher program, contribution limits, and campaign spending programs,
with the overarching goal of fostering more inclusive and accessible elections within the city.
The Committee acknowledged the limitations imposed by state regulations on elections and
campaign finance reform. In response, a strategic recommendation emerged to amend the city's
charter. This proposed addition would empower the City Council, the election commission, or

Strong Mayor / CAFO / Council Statement with Related Votes
In support of a “Strong Mayor/CAFO” form of City governance

17

Eight out of fifteen members of the Cambridge Charter Review Committee, after extensive research,
discussion and ample opportunity for public comment, support a move to a “Strong Mayor” form of
government along with the development of a new position of Chief Administrative and Financial Officer
(CAFO) to oversee day to day administration of the City. While we cannot relay all that has been
discussed on this topic, we wish to convey the key reasons why eight members of the Charter Review
Committee have come to this conclusion:

A
FT

1.

1) Enhancing democracy: Democracy is the best form of government for ensuring that all residents
of Cambridge can actively participate as equals in the project of self-governance. While it is
critical that we seek to engage residents in City government in a myriad of ways, it is through the
act of voting that the greatest number of residents, including those from historically marginalized
communities, express their political choices and opinions. In our current form of government,
many voters are unaware that they do not choose the person that manages the City and its budget.
The representatives elected by the voters have only overbroad and seldom-used tools to ensure
that the actions of the City Manager reflect the will of the people. By contrast, the democratic
methods for holding an elected Mayor accountable are well known, powerful and accessible to
all. While we understand that some residents and members of the Committee believe that the
administration of the City should be “depoliticized”, we think that the “depoliticization” of city
governance ultimately means there is less ability for residents of all types to have real impact on
important City decisions.

D

R

2) History of City Manager form of government to disenfranchise voters of color: The
Committee has explored research showing a strong positive correlation between cities that
received many Black people during the Great Migration of the twentieth century and cities that
adopted a city manager form of government during the same period. The explanation of this
correlation reveals that many Progressive Era supporters of city anager governments intended to
make local government as inaccessible as possible for new immigrants and people of color. While
such reasons do not appear to have directly applied to Cambridge where the effort was mainly
directed against perceived corruption, and while we do not believe that this goal is today the
reason that other members of the Charter Review Committee support a city manager form of
government, this history provides useful lessons about how broad democracy is limited when
there are no elections for the Chief executive.
3) Influence on the City budget: Perhaps the greatest power of the City Government is the
development of a city budget which ultimately is an expression of the values and priorities of the
City. At present there is no mechanism for residents to have a direct impact on budget choices.
Under the current charter arrangement, the City Council can only reduce budget expenditures but
cannot allocate or reallocate budget items. While there may be indirect ability to impact on the

20

Packet Pg. 44

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

budget process through the ability of the City Council to hire and fire a city manager, we see a
strong Mayor system as allowing for a far more effective means for residents to express their
pleasure or displeasure with the budgets as developed by the Executive branch through the Act of
voting.

1.

17

4) Combining a Chief Financial/Administrative Officer with a Strong Mayor provides the best
of both worlds: It is critical for Cambridge to have a person in charge of administration that is a
highly skilled administrator with the background and expertise necessary to solve complex
problems and make difficult choices. We acknowledge that the qualities that make a candidate the
best candidate for Mayor are not necessarily the same qualities that make for high quality
municipal administration. For this reason, we believe the City Charter should require the City to
hire a Chief Financial and Administrative Officer with similar qualifications and responsibilities
as a City Manager. The change to the Charter we propose-a change we consider critical-is that
this new Officer should be answerable to an elected Mayor.

A
FT

5) Direct accountability to residents: Elected Mayors have a strong incentive to be responsive to
their constituency as they must win sufficient votes to remain in office. This incentive demands
that successful Mayors make themselves available to residents and change their decisions in
response to resident pressure. A move to an elected Mayor would also provide much needed
clarity to residents who currently express confusion about how and where to seek redress, make
policy suggestions or otherwise impact on government decisions.

R

6) Possibility for a bolder agenda: Direct accountability to the voters will in some instances allow
for a bolder executive branch than exists with a city manager form of government. Unrelated to
any particular city manager, a city manager may have some implicit incentive to perpetuate the
status quo and not to urge bold action on the part of the City and its many division heads who
implement policy. This may be particularly true in a city like Cambridge with enviable sources of
income, a low tax rate and AAA bond rating. We note, perhaps tangentially in this context, that
our current financial security and bond rating is not merely the product of a city manager; many
of our neighbors, including Boston and Somerville, have the same high bond rating along with
elected Mayors.

D

We believe that the current power, income, and wealth gap between residents, often correlated to
race, means that while many are thriving in the City of Cambridge, others are struggling just to
remain in this City, never mind thrive. People with this or other relevant life experience may
demand, through the act of voting and otherwise, bolder action than we have seen to date in
regard to anti-displacement, climate justice, public transportation, or the like. The debate over
how bold to be and what risks to take is critical; but true debate is most meaningful when people
truly have the power to determine the debate’s outcome – in this case through the power of the
vote.

7) Leadership in External and Regional Efforts and Policymaking: Increasingly we face
challenges like climate and housing which one municipality cannot solve. An elected Mayor

21

Packet Pg. 45

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

would have an expanded ability to represent our community, foster regional collaboration and
provide visionary leadership on these and other critical issues.

17

8) How adoption of a strong Mayor/CAFO form of government would relate to other
recommendations of the Charter Review Committee: The Charter Review Committee as a
whole (“the Committee”) recognizes the influence that money can play in the ability of diverse
candidates to successfully run for office. For this reason, the Committee is recommending that the
City Council undertake a review of the possibility of implementing some form of public financing
for elections. The Committee is also recommending additional means of enhancing direct
democracy such as the formation of a Resident Council, requesting permission from the state to
allow non-citizens and residents sixteen (16) and older to vote, and moving elections to even
years to increase voter turnout. Mayoral elections will need to be combined with other strategies
to truly enfranchise and empower a wider range of residents to engage actively in city
government.

1.

For these reasons and others each of us personally hold we favor a move to a strong Mayor/CAFO form
of government.

Council / Manager Statement with Related Votes
Reasons to prefer a City Council/City Manager form of government for Cambridge
The citizens of Cambridge have benefitted from steady, professional leadership in the position of the city
manager for decades and there are numerous strong reasons to maintain our City Council/City Manager
(Council/Manager) form of government.

1.

17

Satisfaction of Residents:
Citizen surveys over the past 20 years reflect a high level of satisfaction with Cambridge’s form of
governance, as did a significant number of the comments to the Charter Review Committee at its
December 5 meeting. This is unsurprising. The city offers a high level of services, the lowest residential
tax rate among surrounding communities, and the highest possible bond rating (which enables the city to
undertake capital improvements such as schools and parks at lower costs). Further, external stakeholders
can turn to a stable professional representative of the city with whom to partner rather than a politician
with a limited term of office. Certainly, some citizens wish certain things were different in our city. The
question for this report is whether changing the form of government would make a difference in those
matters.

A
FT

Separation of policy-making from policy-implementation.
The primary reason to maintain the Council/ Manager form of government is the separation of
policy-making from policy-execution. Policy-making should always be the responsibility of an elected
body broadly representative of the city -- the City Council. Our system of Proportional Representation
and at-large seats has, for decades, produced a richly diverse Council, currently almost precisely
representative of the demographics of our population. However, policy implementation is different by
nature. It is a highly professional, and often very technical operation, best led by a well-trained senior
executive who must oversee thousands of staff, an annual budget of nearly $1 Billion, and a labyrinth of
federal, state and local regulations.

R

Popularly elected officials should decide what we should do as a city; well-trained professionals should
decide how we do it most effectively.

D

The Council/ Manager form of government allows the broadly representative legislative body to choose
and oversee such a professional who works at their direction. Since it takes at least five city councillors
(with disparate constituencies) to vote to select a city manager, we are assured that the chief executive of
the city will need to serve a wide range of our citizens with different needs and priorities.
Further, by separating the executive from the political process, the city manager can make important and
even controversial decisions, such as hiring department heads and making contract decisions, without
undue political pressure. Nor need the city manager spend time and/or political capital raising money,
attending campaign events or seeking endorsements and financial contributions from people who may
then feel they then have a right to influence the city manager’s decisions on civic matters. The Manager
can also lean on the experience of other city and town managers who are his professional peers for

25

Packet Pg. 49

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

expertise in urban problem solving. Further, when the council is split on an issue, the Manager can offer a
politically neutral party that can help fashion collaborative solutions addressing various factions’
concerns.
Stability of government
The city manager’s status as a professional employee of the city council allows for continuity in
government. The manager can remain in office through multiple council elections as long as the new
council approves of their performance.

1.

17

Accountability
Changes to the relationship between the Council and the City Manager have been codified and
strengthened by recommendations detailed elsewhere in this report. Joint public goal-setting between the
Council and the Manager and a regular, thoughtful Manager evaluation process (as set out in our draft
sample Council/Manager Charter) by the Council are important elements in increasing accountability and
transparency in our government. The former is difficult and the latter does not exist in the case of an
elected mayor. The addition of Resident Assemblies brings another force into the governance of the city
and will ensure that more citizens are engaged and informed.

R

A
FT

Direct Oversight by the City Council
In some versions of the mayor form of government, the mayor is authorized to hire a CAFO (Chief
Administrative and Financial Officer) to administer the city while the elected mayor handles political
chores and policy making. This would bring the somewhat professional expertise of a manager-type to the
city. But, this approach consolidates power in the hands of two people (one not elected) at the expense of
the more broadly representative council. And the CAFO reports only to the Mayor, not to the Council.
Hence, the administration of city government is one step further removed from the Council and the voters
than the current City Manager is. Mayor/CAFO conversations are typically in private and not subject to
the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law. In the council/ manager form, the chief executive works for the
entire council and must respond to this broadly diverse body in open, public discussion. Policy debates
take place among our elected councillors, and the City Manager is charged with implementing the policies
that emerge.

D

Removal of the Chief Executive
While this report includes a Recall Provision for removing the mayor, it is undeniably a long and
expensive one, involving two rounds of signature gathering and the expense of a city election. Removing
a city manager only requires the votes of five city councillors and the expense of a hiring process and any
severance that is included in the manager’s contract. This is easier and faster than Recall in the case of
drastically poor performance. Further, if the manager is removed due to poor performance, the
replacement process is a purely professional one. When a mayor is recalled, it is the removal of a
popularly elected official, and more likely the result of shifting political winds, potentially alienating a
large part of the population.

17

We acknowledge the painful and problematic racist and xenophobic motives that have been attributed by
some historians to the creation of the city manager concept in the early 20th century. This is a reason to be
thoughtfully observant of how the system is implemented in our community 100 years later. But we are
aware of no indication that such motives were involved in the selection of the city manager form of
government for Cambridge in the 1940s, nor that it is an element of the current practice of the system
(and certainly not an element of the reasons to support its continuance). Sadly, American civic history is
full of examples of policy choices elites have made to consolidate power for themselves at the expense of
BIPOC and immigrant communities, regardless of the form of government in place at the time. The broad
diversity of our elected city councils for many decades and the recent choice of a person of color to carry
out administrative functions for our city are evidence that this terrible history does not apply to
Cambridge today.

A
FT

1.

Summary
We believe that Cambridge should have a professional and rational form of local government. We have a
long history of strong and broadly representative city councils including many thoughtful leaders who
have debated with great energy many of the most critical and controversial issues of their day. They have
not always agreed with each other, as one would expect in a city like ours. But they have decided. We
see no reason to doubt that this lively debate and decision-making will continue, and we hope it will be
more transparent and inclusive given other changes recommended by the Committee.
And, once this body has arrived at a conclusion of the best direction for our city to take, they should turn
those instructions over to a well-trained and nonpolitical professional who can implement those policies
efficiently and effectively. Our city deserves no less.

the Massachusetts constitution or General Laws, it is the intention and the purpose of the voters of

The powers of Cambridge under this charter are to be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specific
mention of any particular power is not intended to limit the general powers of the city as stated in the

SECTION 1-6: INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS
Subject only to express limitations in the constitution or general laws of the Commonwealth, Cambridge

ARTICLE 8: PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, PARTICIPATION, AND
COMMUNICATION
SECTION 8-1 PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CIVIC
INFRASTRUCTURE
The city shall treat public engagement as an integral part of effective and trusted governance, not just as an
occasional process or activity. The city shall treat engagement as a “multi-channel” endeavor that includes
face-to-face meetings, virtual interactions, and other online communications. The departments of city

and authorities, anchor institutions, community-based organizations, civic groups, and individual residents.

(d) Community advisory boards, including boards designated to address the concerns of specific
populations
(e) Youth commissions

SECTION 8-3 PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
To ensure public engagement centers on the needs and goals of community members, the city shall uphold
the following principles, using them as the basis of public engagement protocols and in the establishment
of public engagement structures:
(a) Equity in engagement. Principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion should guide the
design and execution of public engagement activities. When engaging community members, city
officials should identify and proactively reach out to the community in its full diversity. To ensure
that public engagement activities are not attended only by people already active in local government
and politics, city officials should regularly recruit residents through face-to-face or personal written
invitations, social media requests, and randomized selection methods. Materials should be written
in plain, comprehensible English, and should also be translated into the other predominant
languages that residents speak and read.
Traditionally excluded and marginalized individuals and communities should be included in ways
they themselves identify as authentic and meaningful. City officials should co-design engagement
processes with community members to meet the needs of the communities served. Processes should
respect a range of values, interests, perspectives, experiences, cultures, and knowledge of those
involved.
The city should expect local the organizations and networks it works with to engage their members
in equitable and deliberative ways, so that the input received is representative of their constituents.
The city should use an equity lens to evaluate data on impacts of engagement, including costs,
benefits, and responsibilities.
(b) Accountability in engagement. There should be meaningful opportunities for community
members to bring issues, concerns, and priorities to city officials to influence city policy,
ordinances, and actions. Public engagement activities should be designed to appropriately fit the
legal authority, scope, character, and potential impact of a policy, program, or project. There should
be clarity about process sponsorship, purpose, design, and how the results will be used. The purpose

23

a

and potential influence of each public engagement process should be known by all participants in
advance but should be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions during implementation.
(c) Transparency in engagement. Communications about public issues and public engagement
opportunities should ensure community members can engage effectively. Communications should
be made in the predominant languages that residents understand. Participants should have the
opportunity to bring and share their own experiences as well as information they have gathered
about the issues at hand. Full and complete results should be shared in a manner accessible to the
public, and explanations of how the results will be used or how they will influence decisions should
be provided to process participants and the broader public.
(d) Accessibility in engagement. Public engagement activities should be broadly accessible in
terms of schedule, location, facilities, and information and communication technologies. Schedules
should accommodate a variety of participants. Locations should be nearby and reachable via
affordable transit, and some engagement activities should be conducted in places where community
members already gather regularly. Facilities should be welcoming public spaces and not present
physical or cultural barriers to participation. Online engagement opportunities should use
technologies that are freely available to residents and attend to barriers people may face, such as:
no access to broadband, limited proficiency with technology, and challenges related to deaf-blind
accessibility.
(e) Collaboration in engagement. Public engagement efforts should build on and help develop longterm, collaborative working relationships and mutual learning opportunities with residents of all
ages, civic groups, organizational partners, and other governments. This may include projectspecific or ongoing community engagement initiatives.
(f) Evaluation of engagement activities. Each public engagement activity and the state of
engagement overall should be evaluated through participant feedback, analysis, and learning that
is shared publicly and broadly. The ideas, preferences, and/or recommendations contributed by
participants should be fully documented and be made available to participants and the broader
public. Lessons learned should be applied to future public engagement activities and contribute to
the city’s overall engagement plan.

place the recommendations of the Cambridge Charter Review Committee. In order
to create the full picture of what a full charter might look like with these
recommendations, the Collins Center has incorporated standard/best practices text
in places where the Committee has not voted. These parts of text should *not* be
considered Committee recommendations.

ARTICLE 8: PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, PARTICIPATION, AND
COMMUNICATION
SECTION 8-1 PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CIVIC
INFRASTRUCTURE
The city shall treat public engagement as an integral part of effective and trusted governance, not just as an
occasional process or activity. The city shall treat engagement as a “multi-channel” endeavor that includes
face-to-face meetings, virtual interactions, and other online communications. The departments of city
government shall encourage collaboration in public engagement efforts with other government jurisdictions
and authorities, anchor institutions, community-based organizations, civic groups, and individual residents.
SECTION 8-2 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT AND COORDINATE
ENGAGEMENT
The city shall establish new institutional structures or adapt existing structures to oversee, support,
coordinate, track, and measure engagement on an ongoing basis. These structures may include, but are not
limited to:
(a) Council committees that include residents and other stakeholders
(b) Departments or administrative positions
(c) Public engagement commissions
(d) Community advisory boards, including boards designated to address the concerns of specific
populations
(e) Youth commissions
(f) Participatory budgeting processes and commissions
SECTION 8-3 PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
To ensure public engagement centers on the needs and goals of community members, the city shall uphold
the following principles, using them as the basis of public engagement protocols and in the establishment
of public engagement structures:
(a) Equity in engagement. Principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion should guide the
design and execution of public engagement activities. When engaging community members, city
officials should identify and proactively reach out to the community in its full diversity. To ensure
that public engagement activities are not attended only by people already active in local government
and politics, city officials should regularly recruit residents through face-to-face or personal written
invitations, social media requests, and randomized selection methods. Materials should be written
in plain, comprehensible English, and should also be translated into the other predominant
languages that residents speak and read.
Traditionally excluded and marginalized individuals and communities should be included in ways
they themselves identify as authentic and meaningful. City officials should co-design engagement
processes with community members to meet the needs of the communities served. Processes should
respect a range of values, interests, perspectives, experiences, cultures, and knowledge of those
involved.
The city should expect local the organizations and networks it works with to engage their members
in equitable and deliberative ways, so that the input received is representative of their constituents.
The city should use an equity lens to evaluate data on impacts of engagement, including costs,
benefits, and responsibilities.
(b) Accountability in engagement. There should be meaningful opportunities for community
members to bring issues, concerns, and priorities to city officials to influence city policy,
ordinances, and actions. Public engagement activities should be designed to appropriately fit the
legal authority, scope, character, and potential impact of a policy, program, or project. There should

22

83

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

Packet Pg. 107

be clarity about process sponsorship, purpose, design, and how the results will be used. The purpose
and potential influence of each public engagement process should be known by all participants in
advance but should be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions during implementation.
(c) Transparency in engagement. Communications about public issues and public engagement
opportunities should ensure community members can engage effectively. Communications should
be made in the predominant languages that residents understand. Participants should have the
opportunity to bring and share their own experiences as well as information they have gathered
about the issues at hand. Full and complete results should be shared in a manner accessible to the
public, and explanations of how the results will be used or how they will influence decisions should
be provided to process participants and the broader public.
(d) Accessibility in engagement. Public engagement activities should be broadly accessible in
terms of schedule, location, facilities, and information and communication technologies. Schedules
should accommodate a variety of participants. Locations should be nearby and reachable via
affordable transit, and some engagement activities should be conducted in places where community
members already gather regularly. Facilities should be welcoming public spaces and not present
physical or cultural barriers to participation. Online engagement opportunities should use
technologies that are freely available to residents and attend to barriers people may face, such as:
no access to broadband, limited proficiency with technology, and challenges related to deaf-blind
accessibility.
(e) Collaboration in engagement. Public engagement efforts should build on and help develop longterm, collaborative working relationships and mutual learning opportunities with residents of all
ages, civic groups, organizational partners, and other governments. This may include projectspecific or ongoing community engagement initiatives.
(f) Evaluation of engagement activities. Each public engagement activity and the state of
engagement overall should be evaluated through participant feedback, analysis, and learning that
is shared publicly and broadly. The ideas, preferences, and/or recommendations contributed by
participants should be fully documented and be made available to participants and the broader
public. Lessons learned should be applied to future public engagement activities and contribute to
the city’s overall engagement plan.

of registrars, the council shall call a special election to be held on a date fixed by it, not less
than 35 nor more than 90 days after the date the council votes to call for the special election,
and shall submit the proposed measure, without alteration, to the voters for determination. But
if any other city election is to be held within 120 days after the date of the certification, the
council may omit the calling of the special election and cause the question to appear on the
election ballot at the next city election for determination by the voters.
(e) Publication: The full text of any initiative measure which is submitted to the voters shall be
published not less than 7 nor more than 21 days preceding the date of the election at which the

Items for Future Charter Review Committee Consideration
This Charter Review was the first review since the adoption of the Charter 80 years ago. The Committee
was tasked to make recommendations for changes to the Charter. The breadth of potential items for
consideration was daunting, acknowledging the constraints of time and capacity, the Committee focused
on addressing key aspects of the Charter. As we conclude this review, it becomes evident that numerous
considerations remain for future charter review Committees. These considerations include but are not
limited to:

Community Engagement Summary
The Committee sought to engage with the people of Cambridge to understand their expectations of city
government relating to equity, participation, accountability, transparency, justice, and democracy.
The Committee heard from - residents, community organizations, youth, neighborhood associations,
tenant organizations, political organizations, municipal stakeholders, service providers, educational
institutions, and business owners. The Committee used diverse outreach strategies to engage people where
they are, in the spaces they are comfortable in, and through the most accessible methods.

1.

17

The Committee sought to inform the public about the charter review process, the Committee's goals, and
how the charter is relevant to each person's everyday life. Not only was education central to the outreach
efforts of the Committee, but the Committee prioritized gathering feedback, opinions, and new ideas,
ensuring the incorporation of community input into all Committee discussions and deliberations. The
Committee leveraged their existing networks and community leaders to involve all residents and
community groups.

A
FT

Inform and General Education
➢ Fact sheets / Flyers.
In Fall 2022, informational flyers were distributed across the city in high-traffic areas to raise
awareness of the Charter Review Committee's formation and point residents to additional
information. In addition to physical flyers, the Committee leveraged their networks and
connections across Cambridge to distribute materials electronically - encouraging community and
organization leaders to circulate.

R

➢ Information Sessions and Initial Public Meetings.
The Committee held two initial public meetings in early 2023, one in person at the Cambridge
Main Library on January 24th and one the following weekend on Zoom, February 4th. These
meetings aimed to inform residents about the review process of what a city charter controls and
hear initial feedback and suggestions for the Committee.

D

➢ City Wide Mailer.
In June 2023, the Committee sent an informational postcard to all 69,100 Cambridge residential
addresses to provide information on the Charter Review Committee, high-level details on what a
charter is, and how residents can get involved.
➢ Newsletter.
A bi-weekly newsletter was sent to over 200 residents throughout the Committee's work to update
them on Committee topics, share meeting dates, and encourage public comment at Committee
meetings.
➢ Committee Members' Networks.
Throughout the 17 month review process, Committee members distributed materials and engaged
with their personal and professional Cambridge connections to inform and spread awareness of

94

the charter review, as well as set up times for the Committee present on charter topics and hear
from the public in organizational meetings in an effort to engage the public in familiar spaces.

17

Involve and Consult
➢ Public Comment.
At each bi-weekly charter review meeting, the Committee designated time for verbal public
comment. The Committee heard 91 verbal public comments from a wide range of Cambridge
residents during the review process. In addition, the Committee received 162 written comments to
cambridgecharterreview@cambridgema.gov, which were distributed to the entire Committee
before each meeting as part of the meeting materials.

1.

➢ Public Community Meetings.
The Committee held two additional public gatherings on May 16th at The Foundry and July 25th
at Tasty Burger Central. These informal community gatherings allowed community members to
dialogue with each other and Committee members on charter-related topics, share their top
priorities for Cambridge City Government and answer community questions. Over 40 community
members attended, as well as candidates for public office.

➢ Community Groups and Cambridge Events.
The Committee attended community organization meetings. Many of these were at the request of
the organizations. Others resulted from outreach. The goal was to engage the community in their
familiar groups, present on the Committee process, inform on charter topics, document public
feedback and answer community questions. The Committee also tabled at Cambridge community
events, like Mayfair, to increase general awareness and engage community members where they
work and play. The committee acknowledges that its community outreach efforts were only a
beginning, only a sampling, of what must be a broader and more comprehensive outreach process
before any Charter Reform proposals are put before the voters of Cambridge.

Appendix A: Operations of the Committee and Acknowledgements
Our Committee of fifteen, fully engaged Cambridge residents convened remotely, typically twice a month
from September 2022 to January 2024, for review, discussion, debate, and evaluation of city charter
options. There were thirty-six public meetings of the full Committee, plus an even greater number of
small working group sessions devoted to particular sections of the Charter, to planning the meeting
agendas and to drafting the arguments for each form of government.

17

Our work was ably guided by the consultancy of the Collins Center of UMass Boston including Michael
Ward, Patricia Lloyd, and Elizabeth Corbo. The Collins Center has provided similar services to more than
thirty municipalities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Their deep experience with Charter Review
efforts and their perspective on local government, both practical and idealist, has been invaluable.

Shortly after the Charter Review Committee was convened, it became apparent that the group needed
dedicated and impartial staff to manage communications (including a dedicated city website), to initiate
and manage public outreach and input, to facilitate civil discussion in our meetings and, in particular, to
organize the often complex choices within the decision-making process. Anna Corning, who had critical
experience with the City of Somerville’s charter review effort, was engaged to manage these tasks and she
did so brilliantly. Thanks are due to the City Manager and the Personnel Department for recognizing the
Committee’s needs and in designating this part-time position
The City of Cambridge Law Department, in particular Elliott Veloso, faithfully attended each of our
meetings to provide answers to legal questions as they arose and to be sure that we were abiding by every
aspect of the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law and the ordinances of the City of Cambridge.

R

City Clerk Diane LeBlanc took office at about at the time our Committee was constituted. She was
helpful in determining the scheduling and posting protocols for the Committee meetings. Just as our effort
commenced, the City of Cambridge gained a new Clerk of Committees, Nicole Erwin. After a much

to have Ms. Erwin cover our regular meetings and compile the minutes. These minutes (attached) have

Finally, throughout the project, Patrick Hayes aide to City Councillor Nolan, facilitated connection to the
City of Cambridge web presence, Zoom account and other liason services. Michael Scarlett, Chief of
Staff to Mayor Suddiqui, was an important liason to the Mayor for trouble-shooting and operational issues
as they arose.

Appendix B: Background and Project History
In 2020 the City Council began a focused discussion about the possibility of a revised or new Cambridge
City Charter.

17

The topic of the charter, in particular the form of government (Council/Manager vs Strong Mayor) as well
as modernization of PR (Proportional Representation), had come up periodically in earlier Council terms,
but the complexity of the process for change or replacement of the charter, coupled with a generally
perceived satisfaction with the current system and/or voter disinterest in the subject, had likely
contributed to an apathy in the past.

1.

With a nationwide focus on elections, as well as a local search process for a new city manager outside the
traditional line of succession, the Council may have sensed that it was an opportune time to take another
look at the 80-year-old structure of the Cambridge city government. In addition, there were aspects of the
Proportional Election mechanics, especially vote tabulation (distribution of the surplus votes and the
method of replacement of Council or School Committee members) which were out of step with new
technology and could not be changed without a deeper dive into charter reform.

The Collins Center of UMass Boston was engaged in January 2021 to provide the Council with public
presentations and written reports that gave some background and context on city charters in general and
the various processes for their amendments or total replacements.
Collins Center presentation notes can be found at this link:

1. Charter Review Ballot Question

R

Following the Collins Center recommendation for Charter Review, the City Council voted to place on the
November 2021 ballot an amendment to the existing Cambridge Charter setting out the terms of a regular
and repeating Charter Review. This qualified as a minor amendment and thus did not require a home rule
legislative process such as would be required for a major revision to the Charter. 15,251 voters (of a total
21,958 votes cast) approved this Charter Amendment text as follows:

D

Section 116(b). Not later than July 1, in each year ending in a 2, the City Council shall provide for a
review to be made of the city charter by a special Committee to be established by ordinance. All members
of the special Committee shall be voters of the city not holding elective office. The special Committee
shall file a report with the City Council within 1 year of its appointment recommending any changes to
the city charter which it deems necessary or desirable, unless an extension is authorized by vote of the
City Council. Action on any proposed charter changes shall be as authorized by the Massachusetts
constitution or general laws

effects that any such changes would have upon the reasonable operation and effectiveness

3. Appointment of the Charter Review Committee
The City Council, in Spring 2022, authorized an Ad Hoc Committee of four Councillors to design and
organize the selection process for the Charter Committee members. At each step of this process there was
unanimous support of the full City Council. The Cambridge Charter Review Committee is composed of
fifteen individuals who were selected by the City Council to generally represent the various demographic
characteristics of the city including, but not limited to, age, race, gender, and neighborhood. They
received no compensation for their time.

Anna Corning, Charter Review Project Manager thanked everyone who participated in Public
Comment. Anna Corning recognized Committee members for comments.
Member Kai Long shared that it is hard to make change, but to create change you have to take
the first steps, which is not always easy.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared that she would be in favor of putting the choice of form of
government to the voters.
Member Susan Shell reminded Committee members and the public that their recommendation on
form of government does become a public vote, and there are many more steps that need to be
taken before it gets to the voters of Cambridge.
Member Mina Makarious shared that the Committee has worked very hard discussing both sides
of form of government and noted that cities with strong Mayors are not necessarily doing better
with similar issues that Cambridge is facing, such as affordable housing.
Member Ellen Shachter shared that there have been strong arguments from both sides, although
she does support a strong Mayor, she recognizes that there could be challenges that come with
the change.
Member Jessica DeJesus Acevedo shared that they have reviewed all the information that has
been provided but is in favor of a strong Mayor. Member Acevedo noted the importance of

diversity and accessibility.

shared that what the Committee is discussing is having a Mayor who is directly accountable to
the Councillors and the voters. Member Afreen also shared that she would be in favor of having a
democratically elected Police Review Advisory Board (PRAB) and would like the Committee to
take a vote on it.
Member Nikolas Bowie offered comments relative to the budget and having a CAFO with a
strong Mayor, noting how it will reflect the priorities of those who vote. Member Bowie offered
comments that were in support of a strong Mayor.

Anna Corning shared that members Long and Afreen would be creating a statement relative to a
strong Mayor form of government to include in the proposed language for the Charter and asked
if any other Committee members would be available to help. Anna Corning noted that the
statement is to provide a reflection of the discussions around strong Mayor.
Member Jennifer Gilbert asked for more information relative to PRAB and why the Committee
would potentially be voting on it. Anna Corning shared that although this is not a topic that has
been discussed among the Committee, members of the public have submitted communications
on that topic.
Member Jessica DeJesus had clarifying questions for the final report and future discussions.
Anna Corning was available to respond and review the outline of the final report. Chair Born
reviewed what the next steps are for the final meeting on December 19, 2023 and that the final
report will be the record that reflects the votes and actions that were taken by the Committee.
Chair Born noted that there needs to be a 2/3 majority vote to support the final report to forward
to the City Council and shared what would happen if there was not a 2/3 majority vote.
Member Ellen Shachter shared that they feel the ending of the Committee and the final report
feels very rushed, and shared concerns about the report. Anna Cornnig shared that she is open to
having members assist with the writing of the final report and include information they believe is
important for the City Council to review.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen shared again that they would like the Committee to vote on a
democratically elected PRAB.
Member Mina Makarious agreed with comments by member Shachter regarding feeling rushed
and asked what it would look like for the Committee to potentially ask the City Council for an
additional extension. Chair Born and Anna Corning provided comments relative to extending.
Elliott Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor, advised that due to PRAB not being on the
Committee’s Agenda, he would express caution with the Committee voting on it because it
would violate the Open Meeting Law. Additionally, Elliott Veloso provided a response to the
Committee potentially asking for an extension and the process on how to extend.

and the City Council can override the veto with a 2/3 vote. Patricia Lloyd from the Collins

In addition, Committee members shared concerns with having the City Council use a 2/3
majority vote to override a veto by the Mayor.

threshold based on election turnout. Committee members were recognized for comments. After

Anna Corning, Project Manager shared that the focus of the discussion for the meeting was going
to be on the proposed language for resident assemblies. Anna Corning recognized Committee
members to offer comments and suggestions related to resident assemblies.
Anna Corning shared on the screen language from member Nikolas Bowie regarding resident
assemblies. Member Bowie noted that this language, which was provided as a communication in
advance of the meeting and included in the Agenda Packet, was created to help guide members
to create draft language that everyone agrees on relative to resident assemblies. Committee
members offered their concerns and comments on the proposed language and provided
suggestions on how they believe the proposed language would best serve the City. Member
Bowie was available to respond to questions and concerns brought forward by fellow Committee
members. Michael Ward from the Collins Center shared that the language that has been provided
is good and he believes the Committee is on track to make progress and positive change. Anna
Corning added the suggested changes to the working document on the screen as Committee
members made them during the discussion (Attachment A).
Anna Corning shared that she would like to change the focus of the meeting discussion to
elections. She made note of the suggested changes towards elections that have been brought up
in previous meetings, which included granting 16 and 17 years old as well as non-citizens the
ability to vote in municipal elections and changing the municipal election year to line up with
State and Presidential elections. Anna Corning recognized Committee members to provide
additional topics they would like to discuss relative to elections at the next meeting.
Michael Ward reminded Committee members that the Secretary of States Office is usually
opposed to municipalities moving to an even numbered year for elections and provided the
reasoning as to why they are opposed, but encouraged the Committee to continue to try and
move forward with the changes they best see fit. Member Stockard shared that it is important for
Committee members to continue with the idea of even numbers to encourage residents to come
out and vote and double the number of people who are showing up for municipal elections.
Member Mina Makarious shared that they believe it is important for the Committee to discuss
how they would like the City Council to present the new Charter language to the Legislature.
They noted that they believe the Legislature should not have the ability to take language out of
the proposed Charter.
Member Nikolas Bowie shared that at a future meeting they would like to discuss campaign
finance and noted how Cambridge currently has zero authority over elections under the State
Constitution and would like to push for the City to have some authority of campaign finance
laws. Member Bowie also shared that they would like to discuss the methods of proportional
representation.
Member Patrick Magee shared concerns about making too many changes to elections which
could potentially complicate the language moving forward in the State Legislature’s Office.
Member Magee did share he was in favor of 16 and 17 year olds and non-citizens having the
ability to vote.

Anna Corning shared that when the Charter Review working group on resident/citizen
assemblies met, the intention was to have a short-term resident/citizen group to be tasked with a
specific topic or policy that may be related to a goal from the City Council. Anna Corning asked
Committee members to consider whether that is the type of group they would be interested in
creating language for, or would they be more interested in having a resident/citizen group that is
created to meet on a long-term basis and tasked with more than one topic or policy throughout
their term. Anna Corning shared on the screen a preliminary draft document from the Collins
Center on Public Communication and Engagement, which was provided in advance of the

frame around budget priorities and the City Manager Evaluation Process (Attachment C). Anna
Corning and Committee Members offered suggestions and comments on how the Charter
Review Committee could potentially revise the time frame for the two topics in ways they
believe would be the most successful for the City. Anna Corning shared on the screen proposed
language for City Council Strategic Goals and City Council Budget Priorities (Attachment D)
and asked Committee members to share what they think is important to include in the Charter.
Member Jim Stockard shared that he agreed with all the proposed elements in the City Council
Strategic Goal section and noted that even though the City Council and the City Manager are two
separate parts of the government, it would be important to look at them as a team working
together to set goals and collaborate.
Member Kaleb Abebe shared concerns about the possibility of the City Council and City
Manager not agreeing when it comes to goal settings. Anna Corning noted that the main goal
right now is focusing on City Council goals with the possibility of bringing the City Manager
into the process and seeing what is achievable.
Member Kai Long asked how these goals are relayed to the public. Anna Corning shared that at a
future date, the Committee will be discussing City Manager responsiveness to Policy Orders and
public awareness. Member Long suggested that in relation to budget priorities, the City Council
within their budget is given funding to use towards specific goals of the Council.
Member Lisa Peterson noted that it is important that goals and priorities work together to be
successful. Member Peterson suggested adding public tracking of the goals, meeting
benchmarks, and the importance of having those available to the public.
Chair Born shared that these goals are here to help make the City Council, as a body, the policy
making and governing body of the City.
Member Patrick Magee shared that having the goal setting start at the beginning of new City
Council terms will help normalize the political culture of the City. He noted that City Council
candidates can promote their elections with their proposed goals and policies, which can then be
potentially adopted in the new term. Member Magee shared that by default it would make
candidates and those elected more accountable.
Anna Corning shared that moving forward, she will take all the thoughts and comments on the
draft City Council Strategic Goals and use them as provisions to add to the current Charter.
Member Jim Stockard offered concerns with some of the language in the potential elements
within the City Council Budget Priorities and provided suggestions on how it could be revised.

different budget priorities and how the two can work together to support Council budget
priorities.

is more diversity as well as more democracy within government.

that change is.

creative thinking moving forward and was open to suggestions on how the Committee can
accomplish the goals they are setting.
Member Lisa Peterson asked The Collins Center if there was a campaign finance reform that
could be put in place in the Charter. Elizabeth Corbo shared that this topic is something that is
very difficult to address and would have to consult with the City Solicitor and the State regarding
it. Lisa Peterson suggested that it is something that the Committee and Collins Center should
investigate more to try and include in the Charter.
Member Mina Makarious offered comments and suggestions on Council turnover and shared
they agreed with some of the comments made by previous members, but wants to be mindful in
the language that is used as to not flood the candidate pool with an already confusing voting
process and low voter turnout.
Member Jim Stockard asked for clarification on how much money can be donated by a person to

from the Collins Center shared that campaign financing is very heavily regulated by the State,

process.

reflect having different demographics be a part of City politics and having a town hall that could
be broadcast to residents.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen shared that she chose to be a part of the Charter Review
Committee to represent the groups that they are a part of. Member Afreen shared concerns about
the decision making and conversations within the Charter, noting that they feel some of the
decisions that have been made are only making it easier for those already involved in
government and not to help those who may want to pursue being involved. Member Afreen
suggested that having a citizen’s assembly could be beneficial for residents and noted that they
would like to have Committee meetings that are not just through Zoom, but in person, to promote
more engagement with the public.
Anna Corning reminded members that discussions have mostly been around the legislative and
executive branches of the Charter and plans to have conversations about engagement and other
Articles in the Charter have not been covered yet.

Corbo also noted a tool that can be used for residents is a class or seminar on how a specific local
government is run.

who are interested in running for City Council.

participation.

piece would be on why the Committee would receive a no from the State when bringing
language forward. Member Ellen Shachter responded by sharing their own experience.

around topics they wish to change and implement to be mindful with time while creating smart
goals.

Council. Anna Corning responded by sharing that there will be time before the Committee starts

revisiting the topic sooner rather than later, time can be made during a meeting for it. Anna
Corning shared that they would create an updated timeline for future meeting discussions.

and noted she would be in favor of having more conversations around citizen assemblies and
discussing representation.

Public Comment
Valerie Bonds offered comments on anti-bullying policy for Councillors in Boston, two-year
terms for Councillors, and the process of electing a Mayor.
Anna Corning, Charter Review Committee Project Manager, explained to the Committee that the
Council adopted a City Manager Agenda item at the June 26, 2023 City Council meeting making
Charter Review Committee members Special Municipal Employees.
Anna Corning shared that she would like to continue the discussion from the previous meeting
on term limits for City Councillors. Member Ellen Shachter offered comments on their
experience with participating in a Board with term limits and how to balance democracy and
participation, noting that new people will bring in new ideas.
Anna Corning recognized Member Susan Shell, Chair Kathleen Born, Member Jessica DeJesus
Acevedo, Member Mina Makarious, Member Patrick Magee, Member Nikolas Bowie, Member
Jim Stockard, Member Lisa Peterson, Member Mosammat Faria Afreen, Member Max Clermont,
and Member Kevin Chen who offered comments on term limits. Discussion included Committee
members sharing concerns and suggestions on term limits, with some members expressing that
they would be in favor of staggered terms, while others were leaning towards not having term
limits. Member Kevin Chen highlighted that the Committee should focus on what type of term
limit would serve the public’s interest the most. Committee members recognized the importance
of encouraging younger residents to be more involved with government and noted how term
limits could discourage them from pursuing their participation. It was also suggested that voting
in a Cambridge election can be overwhelming, which can push residents away from going out to
vote.
Anna Corning reminded members that the Committee took a straw poll at the previous meeting
not to xtend term limits for City Councillors and noted that it is always something the Committee
can come back to in the future to see where everyone is standing.

Anna Corning brought forward that she would like to conduct a straw poll with Committee
members sharing if they would like to continue the conversation on term limits or are content
with ending the conversation. There were nine members who shared that they would no longer
like to continue the discussion, three members that would like to continue discussion, and three
members that were absent during the poll.
Anna Corning opened discussion to Committee members on the election and powers of the
Mayor/Chair of the City Council. Committee members discussed whether the title of Mayor
should be changed to Chair of the City Council, Head of the City Council, Speaker of the
Council, or President of the City Council. Chair Born suggested that the Mayor should not be the
Chair of the School Committee and that School Committee members should be able to elect their
own Chair. Chair Born noted that she was in favor of having a member of the City Council
participate as a member of the School Committee for the purposes of budgeting. Members of the
Committee agreed that there should be a change of title as well as agreeing with comments about
the School Committee. Member Lisa Peterson commented that the Charter should reflect having
a goal setting process for every term regarding Councillors because it can have a positive effect
towards the City.
Anna Corning recognized Michael Ward from the Collins Center who noted that President and
Chair are titles that have been used in municipal bodies, but he was not familiar with Speaker
being used in Massachusetts.
Committee members continued discussion on changing the title of the Mayor and what role the
Mayor should play in the City.
Anna Corning shared with the Committee that she would like to take a straw poll on changing
the title of Mayor to Chair of the City Council, Head of the City Council, or President of the City
Council. There were eleven members that were in favor of changing the title, one member who
shared they have no opinion, and three members that were absent during the poll.
Anna Corning opened discussion to Committee members on the appointment process for
department heads and multi member bodies. Anna Corning noted that currently the City Council
appoints the City Manager, the City Auditor, and the City Clerk and noted that the City has many
multi member bodies, Boards and Commissions, and Committees. She noted that the City
Manager is currently responsible for making those appointments and that some of the Boards and
Commission require Council approval.
Anna Corning recognized member Jim Stockard who shared that he believes the City Manager
should be able to pick their own team when it comes to the executive branch and department
heads within the City. He noted that if the Council wants the City Manager to be effective, it is
not unreasonable for them to pick the team which they trust will help make the City successful.
Member Stockard also shared that the City Council approval of appointments to Boards and
Commissions is reasonable because they are policy making bodies. Many members of the
Committee shared that they agreed with the comments that were made by Member Stockard.

Anna Corning recognized Member Nikolas Bowie who suggested that the City Council should
have the power to remove or discipline department heads and offered comments on appointments
to Boards and Commissions and the importance of their role within the City. Member Ellen
Schachter shared that she was not in favor of the City Council having the power to remove
department heads. Member Max Clermont agreed. Member Kevin Chen offered suggestions on
City Council removal of department heads.
Elliot Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor, offered clarifying remarks on Boards and
Commissions and the role some department heads play in those Boards. Elliot Veloso was

Anna Corning, Project Manager, opened public comment.
Valerie Bonds thanked Anna Corning for hosting an event in the community room at 808
Memorial Drive and making herself available to questions from residents and offered comments
and suggestions on term limits for Councillors.
Anna Corning shared that she would like to conduct a straw poll to help focus meeting
discussions on topics the Committee members are most interested in and use the poll as a tool
moving forward.
The first straw poll was to determine if Committee members were interested in keeping an atlarge City Council, or continuing the discussion about adding district Councillors. Nine
Committee members were in favor of maintaining at-large Councillors, three Committee
members were in favor of continuing the discussion, and three members were recorded as absent.
The second straw poll was to determine if Committee members are interested in continuing the
conversation on term lengths for City Councillors or if they are interested in keeping the current
term length. The Committee members who were present chose unanimously to keep the current
term length for City Councillors.
The final straw poll was to determine if the Committee was interested in discussing the addition
of term limits for the City Councillors. Four Committee members were in favor of continuing the
discussion of adding term limits and eight were not in favor of continuing the discussion.
Anna Corning shared that Chair Born, Member Max Clermont, and Member Lisa Peterson have
been discussing ideas on adding additional elements for public engagement into the Charter.
Anna Corning gave an overview of the discussions between the Committee members around
engagement. Anna Corning shared that one thing that she would like the Committee to focus on
is citizen participation mechanisms, which include free petitions and group petitions, and offered
examples of both. Member Max Clermont noted that a free petition gives residents the
opportunity to bring issues forward on the City Council Agenda by submitting the petition as a
communication. Anna Corning shared with the Committee that a group petition needs a threshold
of anywhere between 150-300 resident signatures or a percentage of the voters from the last
municipal election, which could be around 2%-5%, once the petition has collected signatures it
would then and require the City Council to hold a public hearing on the matter being brought
forward through the petition. Committee members were recognized for questions and concerns
and team members from the Collins Center Michael Ward and Elizabeth Corbo were available to
respond and provide further information on petitions and public engagement. It was noted that if
more public engagement were to be proposed in the Charter, the Committee should focus on
language that would include goal setting for City Councillors and how information should be
more accessible to the public.
Anna Corning shared that Chair Born, Member Clermont, and Member Peterson discussed two
other potential provisions. The first was a resident assembly, which would include a large group
of random, diverse individuals who are given questions and topics that they are to address. Anna
Corning offered suggestions and examples of how a resident assembly could be used in

Cambridge. Member Nikolas Bowie and Member Jim Stockard shared that they strongly support
resident assemblies. Member Jennifer Gilbert and Member Susan Shell offered comments and
shared concerns about resident assemblies only having a short time together to focus on
important topics and how participants in resident assemblies are selected. Anna Corning shared
additional information on resident assemblies and made suggestions on how the Charter Review
Committee can move forward with the addition on resident assemblies in the Charter.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:30p.m.

Anna Corning introduced Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center who opened discussion on the
Legislative Branch of government to Committee Members. Anna Corning noted that there should
be three main points that Committee Members should focus on during conversation, which were:
1. Does the Committee want to recommend a change to how City Councillors represent
the City? Adding some or all district representation to the current all-at-large structure.
2. Does the Committee want to change the length of terms for City Councillors (or
include staggered terms)? Does the Committee want to establish term limits for City
Councillors?
3. Role of Mayor/Chair of City Council. How is the Mayor/Chair elected? What should
the power and duties of the Mayor/Chair of City Council be?

Member Ellen Shachter offered comments on ward representation and at large Councillors and
shared that they believed a key problem with the system is making sure minorities get the proper
representation.
Member Susan Shell shared that she agreed with comments made by Member Ellen Shachter and
noted it is important that areas of the City are not left out in decision making, which could
happen by having neighborhood representation.
Member Lisa Peterson offered comments on the possibility of district Councillors and shared it
could be beneficial to some residents in the City, but found the City being broken up into three
districts would be problematic for effective representation.
Member Mina Makarious noted that they have similar thoughts to Member Lisa Peterson, and
shared concerns about what does not work for the current system with low turnout rates and low
representation.
Member Jessica Acevedo shared that district representation is important to have individuals
represent the diverse population and noted that they were in favor of staggered terms for
Councillors.
Member Patrick Magee shared frustrations with the current City government on both the
administration and government side. Member Magee offered comments on district representation
and goal setting.
Member Kevin Chen shared that they were leaning towards the at large representation and noted
they would be interested in exploring where to direct attention on the legislative side of
government.
Member Nikolas Bowie shared that they felt very strongly about having the Mayor be called the
Chair of the City Council to reflect what they actually are and also felt strongly against district
based representation.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared the importance of accountability and having a city-wide
perspective when it comes to major changes in the City. Member Gilbert noted that they were not
in favor of switching to district representation at this time.
Member Kai Long offered the suggestion of each Councillor having different responsibilities in
representation to help direct community members who have concerns and noted that there should
be term limits for Councillors and possibly the City Manager.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that she believes that proportional representation already allows
for neighborhood representation. She is not in favor of districts. The Chair offered comments on
term limits, noting that she is not in favor of term limits, in particular eight or ten year term
limits or shorter.
Members of the Charter Review Committee continued their discussion on government by
offering concerns and suggestions on ways the Committee can continue to move forward with
topics they wish to address while forming a new Charter to propose to the Council. Anna

Corning, Elizabeth Corbo, and Michael Ward from the Collins Center were available to respond
to Committee members. Anna Corning shared that if Committee members were interested in
learning more information on the roles and power of duties of the Chair of City Council/Mayor,
she and the Collins Center would be available to provide material for future discussions.
Member Lisa Peterson shared concerns from residents on whether the Mayor should be the Chair
of the School Committee or if it should be someone that is specifically elected to be on the
School Committee. Member Peterson noted that she was in favor of having the Mayor being the
Chair, but also offered suggestions on how the Chair could be elected. Chair Born responded to
comments made by Member Peterson, sharing that if a Mayor were to be elected there should be
a discussion on what the roles and duties of the Mayor should be.
Member Patrick Magee asked if the Chair could go through the process of how the Mayor is
currently elected and share her experience while being on the Cambridge City Council. Chair
Born was available to respond and was happy to give an overview of the process.
Anna Corning reviewed the major themes that were discussed throughout the meeting and
recognized Committee Members for comments. Elizabeth Corbo offered comments on theories
on why officials are challenged less in district representation versus at large. Anna Corning
shared suggestions from the public on how the districts could potentially be divided.
Anna Corning suggested that if Members do not feel strongly about changing something, going
forward there should be votes taken in order to move on from certain discussions and topics.
Members of the Charter Review, the Collins Center, and Anna Corning discussed the City having
a “311” informational telephone number similar to Somerville to assist residents with reporting
various concerns and incidents and receiving a response in a timely manner.
Member Ellen Shachter shared concerns about term limits. Anna Corning, Michael Ward, and
Elizabeth Corbo were available to respond and provide examples of term limits in other
municipalities in Massachusetts and other States. Michael Ward noted that term limits are very
rare in Massachusetts. Anna Corning shared that she would get more information on
Massachusetts municipalities to provide to the Committee. Member Jennifer Gilbert asked the
Collins Center why Massachusetts is different from other States regarding term limits. Michael
Ward shared that he would look into it further.
Member Kai Long offered comments on term limits and noted that they would be in favor of
term limits for various reasons, including having more diversity.
Anna Corning reminded Committee members and the public of future meet and greets with
residents and noted that there will be no meeting on July 4, 2023.

government. The chart reviewed the potential decision areas which included qualifications, term
of Office, compensation, prohibitions, evaluation, goal setting, powers/duties, appointments by
Office, temporary appointments, temporary vacancy in Office, removal (City Manager), and Veto

focus moving forward and members who vote in the minority would have the opportunity to
produce a minority section on that form of government to be submitted with the final report.
Member Ellen Shacter suggested that if Members were not available to vote at the next meeting,
they could possibly submit a vote by proxy. The Chair, Kathleen Born noted that the Law
Department should be consulted on this issue.

Nikolas Bowie shared that they agree with Kai Long and Susan Shell on voter turnout and noted
that the low turnout in the City is not a good way to run the City. Nikolas Bowie noted that the
Committee can make changes within their control to change voter turnout. Anna Corning and
Michael Ward offered comments and suggestions about voter turnout and shared that the
Committee can look at other ways to increase voter participation. The Chair, Kathleen Born
asked for clarification on ways to increase participation in elections. Anna Corning and Member
Nikolas Bowie, noted that under the State’s Home Rule Amendment, municipalities are not
allowed to change voting laws without State Legislative approval.

Members of the Charter Review Committee held a roundtable meeting on Tuesday, April 25,
2023, to continue their discussion on the form of government in Cambridge.
The Chair, Kathleen Born, reminded members of the Committee and the public that it was a
roundtable meeting, noting that no public comment and no votes would be taken during the
meeting. Present at the meeting were Michael Ward and Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center
who made themselves available to respond to any questions or comments brought forward by
Committee members.
Anna Corning, Project Manager, gave an overview of the agenda for the meeting and noted that
the discussions would be on City Manager-Council-Mayor form of government and related
changes and on Mayor-Chief Administrative and Finance Officer (CAFO)-Council form of
government and related changes. Anna Corning shared that Committee members should be
concentrating on the strengths and challenges of each during the discussion.
Anna Corning recognized member Jim Stockard who led a focused discussion on City ManagerCouncil-Mayor form of government. Jim Stockard gave an overview of the pros of having a City
Manager, sharing that City Managers are not subject to political pressure and are able to choose a
successful team to run the various City Departments. Jim Stockard shared that they feel with the
many communications, public comment, and forums the Charter Review Committee has
conducted, the public seem to be leaning towards keeping a City Manager. Jim Stockard shared a
question that was brought forward by a member of the public which was, “What is the problem
you are trying to fix?”. Jim Stockard shared that that question has stuck with him and believes
that the City, for the most part, runs fairly well with the current form of government. Jim
Stockard reviewed some of the cons that have been brought up during discussion regarding City
Manager form of government, sharing the most noticeable concern with members is the City
Manager not being an elected official and having too much power overseeing the budget. After
Jim Stockard reviewed the pros and cons of the City Manager-Council-Mayor form of
government, Committee members were able to offer comments and concerns, with many
members sharing their opinion on this type of form of government.
Anna Corning recognized member Nikolas Bowie who led a focused discussion on MayorCAFO-Council form of government. Nikolas Bowie shared that no form of existing democracy
is a guarantee that an elected leader will care about everybody in the community, but what
democracy does well is create a strong incentive for elected officials to care what people think.
Nickolas Bowie noted that as members of the Committee, they have many resources to ensure
that City government is accountable. They noted that it is important, whether it is with electing a
strong Mayor, or any type of form of government, that elections are as inclusive and as
representative as possible. By stressing the importance of having representation in elections,
voters will have the ability to make the government more accountable than it currently already is.
Nikolas Bowie stressed that democratic accountability has been the biggest factor in those in
favor of a strong Mayor. Nikolas Bowie shared that they were in favor of a suggestion made by
the Collins Center, which would include a Resident Advisory Committee for strong Mayor form
of government and suggested that having a citizen jury and/or having random people chosen to
participate in decisions would be beneficial. Nikolas Bowie ended by noting that they believe
2
202

a

Packet Pg. 226

that the City will work better if everyone can equally participate in deciding how everything in
the community can flourish. After Nikolas Bowier reviewed the pros and cons of the MayorCAFO- Council form of government, discussion was open to Committee members to offer their
comments and concerns.
Anna Corning suggested that moving forward it could be a good idea for the Committee to start
focusing on other aspects of the Charter and return to a form of government discussion after
Committee members have thought about it more.
The Chair, Kathleen Born offered closing remarks about form of government and shared they
agreed with Anna Corning on the idea of taking a break on form of government discussion and
coming back to it later. The Chair shared that it is important to discuss other topics of the Charter
so the Committee can continue moving forward.
The Chater Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:30p.m.
Clerk’s Note: The City of Cambridge/22 City View records every City Council meeting and

choice ballet voting.

on March 22nd.

Members of the Charter Review Committee discussed and shared concerns around conducting a
survey within the community regarding the form of government and matters related to it. Anna

for surveying, so the Committee can execute the survey to get the best outcome possible. Anna
shared that there can be more than one way a survey is done.
Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center noted that conducting this survey will not be the last
opportunity to receive feedback from the public and reviewed what the process will look like in

Anna Corning shared that they would like to transition the topic of discussion to form of
government and have Committee members share their thoughts.

Kai Long shared that they worry about having a strong Mayor and the accountability between the
Mayor and City Council that would be involved and how they would be able to work together.

noted that a strong Mayor with a CAFO could work if the Mayor’s position would not have
complete power and the possibility of making decisions with the Council.
Nikolas Bowie shared they support a strong Mayor system and likes the idea of having a CAFO.
They stressed the importance that whoever sets the budget for the City should be accountable to
the voters.
Jim Stockard shared that they are in favor of City Manager form of government and he likes the
idea that the City Manager can stay away from campaigning and elections. Jim Stockard noted
that they would like the City Council to have a leader within the Council that is elected to
advocate for good policies to benefit the City.
Lisa Peterson noted that they are in favor of the City Manager form of government, and shared
that a good City Manager tries to balance the interests of people across the City. They shared that
if the Committee went with a strong Mayor it would be important to have an elected CAFO and
for the Council to have more authority around the budget.
Susan Shell shared that they were in favor of a strong Mayor with a CAFO and that the budget
should be overseen by elected officials.
Mosammat Faria Afreen shared that they were leaning toward having a strong Mayor form of
government due to the potential of increasing voter turnout and noted it was important to have a
strong public figure in Cambridge in terms of infrastructure and having a larger say with the
budget.

Kaleb Abebe offered comments around form of government and shared they were in favor of
keeping the current form of government.
Kathleen Born noted that a strong elected official is the best way for the City to have a future.
The Chair noted that the City is stuck right now and it would benefit the City to have someone
come in with a vision for the future and provide answers on how to get there.
Kevin Chen offered comments around the budget and noted that with a strong Mayor system,
decisions around the budget could be different. They shared that they agree with the Chair about
lack of leadership in the City and would support a strong Mayor system with a CAFO role in
place.

for the City to create leadership and prioritize the City. They shared that a Mayor is someone that
would be more accountable to lead the City in the future.
Jessica DeJesus Acevedo shared that they believe the City is going towards the direction of
change, but is concerned with having a strong Mayor form of government. They shared they
would like to look more into how the City Council can be improved and noted it would be
important to help increase the number of minorities who are represented in the City, and shared
that with a strong Mayor it would not be a full representation of citizens.
Patrick Magee shared that they support a City Manager - Council form of government and
offered comments on the budget, noting that the past City Managers have not been able to
accomplish what they have with regards to the budget without the push from the City Council.

agrees with comments made by Jim Stockard.
The meeting was extended thirty minutes by the Chair, Kathleen Born. No vote was taken.

Marilee Meyer shared they do not want to see more power from the Council and asked that the
current system stays in place.
Valerie Bonds supported the same comments made by previous speakers and shared the City
Council is not ready for a four year term.
Stephen Cellucci thanked the Committee for taking time to discuss the future of the City and
spoke in support of a strong Mayor.
Jesse Baer spoke in favor of a strong Mayor and shared that politics is democracy and politics is
under a threat and this is not the time to be moving away from politics.
Suzanne Blier spoke in favor of keeping the City Manager for now to see how the new City
Manager is in his new role. She offered suggestions around the possibility of residents voting for
the Mayor during Council elections.
Robert Winters offered many suggestions on updating and reformatting the current Charter and
shared that giving the Election Commission more flexibility in some of the ways things are done
would be beneficial.
Heather Hoffman offered comments around proportional representation and shared that done
correctly, politics is the art of getting somewhere by bringing people together.
James Williamson shared a quote from Niccolo Machiavelli and would like to see a shift of
power where citizens have input in decisions that are made and participate in the decisions that
effect their lives.
Ilan Levy shared it is important for residents to have a clear understanding of the actual
consequences of the form of government that the City will be using and voices of the people
need to be heard in the final decisions that are made.
Anna Corning, Project Manager, introduced Elizabeth Corbo and Michael Ward from the Collins
Center who gave an overview of their chart titled “Menu of Forms of Government with Example
Options for Modifications” (Attachment A). After their presentation they made themselves
available to Committee Members to respond to any questions or concerns.
Member Kai Long offered comments around strong Mayor and Manager and shared that the
possibility of modifying and working on what government the City already has could be
beneficial.

if the Committee decides to keep the City Manager he would like to see the Council and the
public be more involved with the approach of hiring a new City Manager.
Member Nikolas Bowie shared he was in favor of switching to a strong Mayor system and
realizing how much Massachusetts State Law puts into the budgetary process is a key factor that
helped him lean towards a strong Mayor.

Member Lisa Peterson shared that she believes that the current system works very well but could
use some improvement. Lisa Peterson noted that a directly elected Mayor is putting a lot of
power to one person versus having a City Council that would require a vote of five people to
make decisions within the City. Member Peterson shared that mutually agreeable goals are
needed between the Council and Manager to make progress.
Member Jim Stockard offered comments and shared that the Charter Review Committee should
not want to change the Charter just for the sake of change, but there are improvements in the
current Charter the Committee can make moving forward. He shared that he likes the idea of
keeping the current government system, noting that the City Manager is held accountable by the
City Council. Jim Stockard also agreed with statements made by member Nikolas Bowie around
the budget process and shared that the City Council should have more input and accountability
with the budget.
Member Susan Shell shared that they agreed with comments made by member Jim Stockard. She
shared that she is reluctant to change things radically without more time to deliberate and noted
that maybe this is not the best time to go with a strong Mayor but feels most of the changes that
will happen will be at the level of the City Council.
Member Jennifer Gilbert encouraged all members to speak on the topic of form of government if
they feel comfortable. They shared that they are leaning towards a strong Mayor government and
offered comments on why they are leaning that way, noting that it is hard to have a nonelected
official be the voice of the City in regards to the budget and representing the City regionally.
Member Kevin Chen shared that they appreciate hearing comments from fellow Committee
members and from listening to the conversation at the meeting, they are leaning towards strong
Mayor only if there is a Chief Administrative and Finance Officer (CAFO) role partnered with a
Mayor. Kevin Chen noted that having a Mayor will help bring accountability and transparency to
the City, which is what many residents and Committee members have voiced in their concerns,
and a CAFO will allow a manager type role that can help the City go in the right direction.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen shared that if the Committee decides to keep the current form
of government one thing they would like to see changed would be towards the budget, and noted
giving the responsibility of the budget to the elected officials is important.
Member Patrick Magee agrees with comments made around the budget process and shared it
would be helpful to look at past budgets and compare them to municipalities that have a strong
Mayor to see where Cambridge’s budget stands in comparison to those to see if members are
happy with that, or what the difference would be under different circumstances. He shared that
there could be the possibility of strong Mayor form of government not being progressive enough
and noted there is a balance of having a collective group deciding who the City Manager is could
be a good safety net.
Member Kaleb Abebe shared he had similar thoughts to Patrick Magee to compare budgetary
spending with other municipalities and how it relates to Cambridge. Kaleb Abebe offered
comments around the budget and noted that more input from elected officials and the City
4

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

Packet Pg. 236

Council, is more of a high priority for him while also maintaining the Council-Manager
relationship.
Member Jessica DeJesus Acevedo shared that she is apprehensive towards elected voting due to
the lack of representation of minorities. She offered comments around the budget and the
struggles of being a small business owner and resident in Cambridge, but noted she was in favor
of a City Manager structure because she believes that role is more accountable. She shared
suggestions around terms and noted that a four-year term would be more beneficial for the
Council and the City to accomplish goals.
Member Max Clermont noted that he was in favor of a strong Manager and Council form of
government and shared that there is more of a role that the Mayor could play as a member of the
Council and with the City Manager.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that it has been very difficult to decide on the form of
government and shared she is not ready to move away from a City Manager form of government.
She agrees there could be changes made in the Charter and a more efficient way to elect a Mayor
to Chair the City Council.
Member Kai Long shared that having nine elected leaders and helping them figure out how to
work together would be extremely beneficial and a good goal for the Committee to work
together towards.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen noted that the rise of costs in the City has played a role in how
many people who identify as a minority vote in Cambridge and shared that the idea of having
people who may not live in Cambridge, but work in Cambridge, vote as well, which could be a
benefit regarding the increase of voter turnout.
Member Lisa Peterson had a clarifying question about how much input the Boston City Council
recently got towards the budget and how they were able to make that change. Anna Corning
noted that it was a ballot question that the State gave Boston to allow new power to the Council
to allow them to amend, reject, or propose line items, as long as the overall budget number did
not increase.
Member Nikolas Bowie stressed the importance that when the Committee goes to the State
Legislature, they should approach the process from the perspective that the Charter is the vehicle
to push through the legislature the changes the people of Cambridge want.
Member Susan Shell shared it is useful to think about the residents of Cambridge who will be
here in twenty years, and noted that decisions made today may influence what the demographic
of the city is in the future.
Anna Corning noted that at the next Charter Review Committee meeting she would like to finish
the conversation and take a working consensus vote on the form of government.
The Chair, Kathleen Born extended the meeting by fifteen minutes, no vote was taken.

Member Jennifer Gilbert shared she looks forward to more conversation to help flush out and get
a better consensus on form of government.
Member Mina Makarious offered comments regarding how the Committee will vote next week
on the form of government.
Member Kai Long had a clarifying question on how the Charter can make the City Council and
City Council- Manager relationship more accountable and if a Mayor-Council would be an easier
relationship to build towards accountability. Anna Corning noted that with a Mayor system, they
are less accountable to the City Council because they do not have to report to the City Council,
whereas the City Manager does have to report to the City Council.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that she would like more information from the Collins Center
regarding what a tight goal setting process would look like to tie goals to the budget. She also
shared that understanding more about the State Legislative process and other Charters submitting
Home Rule petitions would be helpful moving forward. Anna Corning and Elizabeth Corbo were
available to respond and shared that there are many methods to use towards goal setting.
Member Kevin Chen had a clarifying question regarding the possibility of voters being able to
appoint and remove a City Manager. Elizabeth Corbo provided answers, sharing that there is the
possibility of having a form of a citizen free petition.
Member Jim Stockard shared it is important to communicate with State Representatives and
Legislators sooner so they are on the same page and have an understanding of what the
Committee is trying to address.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen thanked the Collins Center for their chart and shared a table
that represents the roles of the Manager and CAFO with a column on how they could be kept
accountable by the Council and the voters would be helpful. Anna Corning shared that a CAFO
role is person who is working for the Mayor and acts as a department head.
Anna Corning thanked everyone for participating and believes it was a very productive meeting.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 8:00p.m.

Anna Corning, Project Manager, shared that she would like to hear opinions on the proposed
timeline (Attachment B) and adopt it at the meeting. She noted that she tried to incorporate the
two main items she heard as feedback from members, which included dedicated time to review
drafted charter text, and dedicated time slots for topic-specific public forums. Anna noted that
the plan would be to propose this timeline to the Council at the meeting being held on March 22
with the understanding that the Charter Review Committee would ask for an extension through
the end of the year. Anna opened discussion to members about edits and concerns around the
proposed timeline.
Member Ellen Shachter had a clarifying question around summer meetings and the possibility of
some members being away on vacation. She noted the importance of making sure there is a
quorum for summer meetings so the Committee is able to meet. Anna Corning noted that there
will be a summer break where meetings will not be held and shared she would be reaching out to
members to confirm their availability.
Member Susan Shell had a clarifying question on how the timeline would be affected by an
extension and what it looks like moving forward. Anna Corning noted that the timeline is the
framework behind asking for the extension with the goal being to discuss the extension at the
City Council Special meeting on March 22, and shared that the timeline currently goes to midNovember, and members should think about if they are able to continue to make a commitment
to participate.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that it would be good to end in November because it is an
election year and it would be good to have the current City Council members present when the
new Charter Review language is complete and ready to be submitted. The Chair encouraged
members to look at the proposed timeline so they have a good idea of what will be happening in
the upcoming months and future meetings.
Member Kai Long offered comments and positive feedback around the proposed timeline and is
in favor of moving forward with it, and believes November is a good end date.
The Chair, Kathleen Born recognized member Ellen Shachter who made a motion to adopt
the proposed timeline. Member Patrick Magee seconded the motion.

Kathleen Born – Yes
Yes – 12, No – 0, Absent – 3. Motion passed.
The Chair, Kathleen Born reminded Committee members of the Special City Council meeting
being held on March 22nd and encouraged some members to join in the meeting, but also stressed
the importance that Charter Review Committee members that do attend have to be less than
seven to stay away from a quorum.
Anna Corning introduced City Manager Yi-An Huang who thanked the Committee for inviting
him to join the meeting. The City Manager offered opening remarks about his transition from his
previous employment to his current role as City Manager, and shared his background on what led
him to become a City Manager. He shared that he recognized the opportunity to come into the
City to build off of things that are already strong, and work towards strengthening areas in the
City where it was needed. The City Manager noted that he believes the conversation with the
Charter Review Committee is very important, and he is excited and happy to share what he has
learned, seen, and experienced since taking the role of City Manager.
Member Kevin Chen began by asking the City Manager if there were a Mayor position that had
been opened with the City, is that something he would have applied for. The City Manager
shared that he would not have applied for a political role like that, he does enjoy reading about
politics, but does not see himself as a politician. The City Manager noted that what excites him
about the role of City Manager is being able to build a strong organization and a culture where he
is able get things done.
Member Ellen Shachter offered comments and asked the City Manager what he believes is the
appropriate interface with the people in the community and the position of City Manager. The
City Manager responded by sharing he believes that it is very important to have all levels of
engagement within the community and noted that there is always room for improvement on how
the City continues to be accessible, engaging, and receiving feedback.
Member Susan Shell had a question for the City Manager regarding his relationship with the City
Council around legislation and also questioned how the City Manager, within his own office, sets
up the various divisions and demands and prioritizes what needs get met with first. The City
Manager began by noting that it is a unique governing structure. He shared that he believes the
Councillors got into their roles because they wanted to make an impact and shape their
community. He noted he believes his role when he is working with the Councillors is to try and
come to a consensus and shape policy together through dialogue, even when everyone is coming
from different perspectives, and achieve those positive impacts for the City together.
Organizationally within his Office he aspires to have short term plans where his team can see
what they are working on currently and how it will impact decisions going forward to make long
term investments. He noted that the Councillors exercise a great deal of power and influence on
the City Manager, which is applied over time, and noted how affordable housing is a great
example of that.

Member Kai Long questioned the City Manager on how much in his job description is engaging
with the public or how much within the perimeter of the job would be with the public. The City
Manager responded by sharing that it was the responsibility of the Council to hire someone who
they believed would be beneficial towards the City in all aspects, including community
engagement. He shared that when he came into the position, he had the desire of setting up
structures that have not been in place, with an example being the City Manager annual review.
He commented that he worked with the City Council to create the review, which had just been
finalized, and it offers the opportunity to achieve goal setting and feedback from the community
and other City Departments. Kai Long had a clarifying question regarding the review and was
interested in knowing if the review were something that would continue to apply once City
Manager Huang is no longer in the role of City Manager. The City Manager responded by
sharing that it could be something that becomes permanent but should be flexible as time
changes and the City evolves.
Member Lisa Peterson asked the City Manager if he was able to provide specific
recommendations that members in the Committee could think about to try and change Charter
language to accomplish more public participation. The City Manager noted that there are some
larger challenges the City is trying to solve and recognized that more public representation,
participation, and engagement is important.
Member Jennifer Gilbert offered questions around issues that are more regional and national, and
asked how, with our current form of government, where does the City stand with other cities and
towns, and how does Cambridge contribute to some of these major issues like climate change,
housing, and transportation. The City Manager offered comments, noting that it is understood
that regionally that these are issues that need to be collaborative on.
Member Patrick Magee had questions around the amount of Awaiting Reports that are on the
weekly Council Agenda and suggested that when City Councillors are elected, they try to set
their policy setting earlier in their term. Patrick Magee shared that by doing this it would help to
set the stage and allow staff to know and focus on what the two year term would look like. He
offered additional comments and asked for the City Manager’s view on a suggestion like this.
The City Manager shared that there should be a goal setting exercise between the City Council
and the City, which has been missing. He shared that this year the City and the City Councillors
will plan out what that goal setting looks like moving forward. The City Manager agreed with
Patrick Magee and believes that there is a need to be clearer about overall direction, and where
the staff time and efforts need to be focused.
Member Mina Makarious asked the City Manager from his perspective, or anything he has heard
from the City Council, on what the Charter Review Committee should be working towards to
help the Council function better as an advisory board. The City Manager noted that ultimately
the Councillors are held accountable by the voters. He shared that having a more citizen base that
are working with Councillors and paying attention to legislation could be beneficial moving
forward. The City Manager offered additional comments and noted that he enjoys working with
each Councillor and getting different perspectives from them when making decisions.

Member Jessica DeJesus Acevedo submitted questions to the City Manager and was unable to
speak during the meeting. Member Acevedo wanted to know what the City Manager’s leadership
style was, what is the most difficult part of your role, how are you ensuring policy and legislation
based on social media, and how are we supporting the BPOC and small businesses in our city to
remain in the city from your position and lens post-COVID and ARPA rollout. The City
Manager shared that he focuses on trying to assemble a good team that will focus on tackling an
issue, and he is trying to look at and build into the City a diverse group of people. The City
Manager noted that when involving groups of people, he wants to make sure they feel free to
speak and have input, and that they are listened to when they do speak.
Member Ellen Schachter had clarifying questions around decisions that come down to risk and
the ability to take risks, noting that it is critical to take risks in order to go forward, and asked
where does risk fit into the role of City Manager. The City Manager noted that there are many
risks that come with his role, sharing that there are a lot of different risks and at the end of the
day there should be an assessment of what type of risk you are taking and looking at the different
scenarios with that risk, the impact, and the reward.
The Chair, Kathleen Born thanked the City Manager for taking time to be with the Charter
Review Committee around a clearer mission for the Mayor, which is something the Charter
Review might accomplish by deciding if they go with directly electing a Mayor through rank
choice voting. The Chair, Kathleen Born asked for the City Manager’s thoughts around the
possibility of the Mayor having a different role with establishing priorities. The City Manager
noted that there is some value in having a different role for the Mayor, sharing that it could be
more attractive to voters.
Anna Corning thanked City Manager Huang for participating the Charter Review meeting and
making himself available to answer questions and be open to discussion. The City Manager
thanked all the Charter Review Committee members and thanked them for the important work
they are doing.
Anna Corning reminded members that the goal is to meet a working consensus on the form of
government topic by the end of the next meeting and asked members to submit any questions or
concerns they had around the topic to help them reach the goal of getting to a consensus.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared their concerns around the discussion about the form of
government and noted it should be thorough and thought out on how members engage in
discussion on the topic of form of government. Anna Corning suggested she can brainstorm with
The Chair and the Collins Center to help break down the questions and frame them into building
block questions that will help get to a decision in a thoughtful way.
The Chair, Kathleen Born offered her concerns around the decision of form of government and
noted she had relistened to some of the interviews and meetings that were conducted throughout
the last few months to help with her thought process.
Member Mina Makarious agreed with the Chair about her concerns. They shared that learning
about the different leadership styles has been beneficial and wants to make sure that the

Committee is conscious of the option to not make any changes to the overall form of government
in the decision making process.

options for modifications. Members from the Committee shared their questions and concerns
around the memo and the team from the Collins Center made themselves available to respond.

Lee Farris shared that it would be nice as a user or resident that when the newsletter goes out
there would be a link that would go straight to the documents that are being described in the
newsletter, it would make it easier for the reader.
Patrick Hayes shared that he and Committee members went to a Harvard Square Business
Association meeting recently to spread the word about the Charter Review Committee.
Member Jim Stockard shared discussions he has had with community members, some of whom
voiced their concerns and noted that they were not in favor of having the option to allow older
youth to vote.
Anna Corning asked for feedback on the draft proposed timeline (Attachment E) that was sent to
Committee Members and shared that she would like to have it completed before the Special
Meeting with the City Council on March 22, 2023. She noted that the proposed timeline is a way
to set goals and have topics for future meetings.
Member Ellen Shachter had a clarifying question on the timeline around the drafting of language
for the Charter. Anna Corning was able to provide more detail and feedback on what the
proposed drafting language should look like as the Charter Review Committee continues to
move forward.
Member Kevin Chen had a clarifying question regarding the proposed timeline would work
around community engagement. Anna Corning shared that the way the Charter Review has been
engaging is a good way to continue, but members should think about offering public forums or
workshops that are more structured around specific topics.
Member Mina Makarious suggested that as the Charter Review moves forward with drafting new
charter language, it may be beneficial for the City Solicitor’s Office to review all of the proposed
language.
Member Jim Stockard asked for clarity on when the Charter Review Committee should be
requesting an extension from the City Council. Anna Corning noted that it’s mostly up to the
Committee if they want to continue to volunteer meeting and noted that it would be up to the
members of the Charter Review Committee to determine a proposed timeline to bring to the City
Council when asking for an extension. Anna Corning suggested that members should think about
if they are comfortable extending the timeline and could ask for the extension at the Special City
Council meeting in March.
Member Ellen Shachter suggested that the Charter Review Committee members use specific
questions to bring to the community groups to target what the Charter Review is asking for
feedback on.

topics that included risks and responsibilities that come with mayor and manager, the role of city
councils in the two different forms of government, accountability, the leadership part of the
position and the type of visibility that comes with it, community engagement and goals,

takeaway from the presentation made by the Election Commission from the previous meeting.

voting, reviewing Chapter 54A, its repeal and how it affected Cambridge, voting turnout
numbers, the possibility of having four-year and/or alternating terms for Council members, and
even and odd year elections.
Michael Ward from the Collins Center shared that there are significant challenges with even
number year elections on the same day as State and Federal elections. He noted that there are
both State law and Federal law challenges that would have to be thought through. He shared that
the Collins Center would look more into it to try and get a better understanding and provide
information as it comes.

Member Nikolas Bowie stressed the importance of the role Charter Review Committee members
have.
Anna Corning noted that she will pull some data from other cities and towns that have elections
that fall on even years to see what the voting turnout numbers are compared to odd years.
Members Jennifer Gilbert, Jessica DeJesus Acevedo, Kevin Chen, Kai Long, and Susan Shell
shared their concerns and challenges they took away from the Election Commissions
presentation. A suggestion that was made was to have more outreach with public housing to
engage and educate to get more voters out. One concern that was brought up was around ward
based elections and ward representations, and the challenges that could come with it.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that New York currently moved to non-citizen voting for their
School Committee, which has been successful. She also noted that some communities have been
looking into Universal Suffrage, for a larger expanded group to vote, including younger people.
She shared that it is based off the premise that federal aid and representation is built out on a
census basis, which includes non-citizens and children, who are people that should be included in
the voting process.
Member Kai Long had a clarifying question regarding the possibility of having a digital option
for elections. Elizabeth Corbo responded noting that she’s not aware of any. Michael Ward
shared it is something that the Collins Center can look in to.
Member Jim Stockard offered comments around how to make residents feel more comfortable
coming out to vote and was open to suggestions on how the Charter Review Committee could
make that possible. He also offered ideas on ballot questions that could potentially help to get
more residents out to vote.
Member Patrick Magee shared thoughts on how the community can engage with university type
cities and towns, where the turnover population is always changing, and focusing on those
specific demographics.
Anna Corning asked members to share their thoughts on the Saturday, January 24, 2023, public
forum that was held on Zoom. Member Jennifer Gilbert stressed the importance that if the
Charter Review members were going to meet with one ward, it would be important to meet with
all wards. The Chair, Kathleen Born agreed and shared that it is good to broaden the Charter
Review outreach to as many groups and community members as possible.
Member Kai Long shared that she and member Patrick Magee had interviewed former Mayor
and City Council member David Maher and offered comments on what was discussed during the
interview. Kai Long noted that she had also interviewed former City Manager Robert Healy and
urged other members of the Committee to watch the interview to get his perspective.
Anna Corning shared that she is working on a draft project timeline to help categorize and add
goals to future meetings and did a brief overview of what Committee members can look forward
to at the upcoming meetings. She asked for the members to start thinking about making a
tentative decision on form of government so the Committee can start moving forward.

Members of the Committee offered comments on Mayor versus City Manager form of
government and how moving forward the Committee could possibly look at other options
besides Mayor versus City Manager. One suggestion was looking at structures within the
executive branch and having a document that would be able to summarize the different concepts
and would be able to provide pros and cons of different forms of government.
Member Nikolas Bowie noted that having a chart or document on how Councils in
Massachusetts oversee their executives would be helpful.
Anna Corning shared that the next meeting will be held on February 28, 2023 and will include a
group of Mayors and Managers from different municipalities to speak to the Charter Review
Committee members.
Member Kai Long asked if the Committee could possibly get more information from Department
Heads or other staff on how they feel about a City Manager form of government, to get a more
honest point of view.
Meeting was adjourned at 7:35p.m.

239

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

Goldberg, and the two most recent City Managers, Richard Rossi and Louis DePasquale, and
former Mayor and City Council Member Henrietta Davis.
Member Jim Stockard summarized the interviews he had with Arthur Goldberg, Richard Rossi,
and Louie DePasquale, who all shared they believed the City functions well with the current
government system. Some concerns that came up was having the budget process start sooner and
possibly having the City Council set a goal setting type meeting to help prepare for the budget.
Some commented that the City Manager should be appointing Department heads, while the City
Council appoints members to Boards and Commissions. One thing they were all in favor of was
having as much public engagement as possible.
Anna Corning reminded members of the upcoming public engagement forums on and that she
was trying to plan meetings with the School Committee and City Council in the future. After
updates, Anna Corning introduced David Kale, Assistant City Manager for Finance, who was
joined by his team, Michelle Kincaid, Assistant Finance Director, Taha Jennings, Budget
Director, and Angela Pierre, Deputy Budget Director.
David Kale began the Finance team’s presentation titled, “City of Cambridge Budget
Presentation” (Attachment B), pointing out that the City of Cambridge’s budget is a direct
reflection of its priorities and values as a community and is shaped by many sources of input.
Other members from the Finance team also spoke, sharing that the majority of Cambridge’s
revenue comes from real estate taxes, Massachusetts law dictate the annual budget’s high-level
timeline as well as the City Manager and the city Council’s role in the process, and the budget
process is a year-long, structured and collaborative effort by the City Council, department heads,
and the budget team.
After the Finance presentation, many members from the Charter Review Committee offered
questions and concerns about the City’s budget. Some topics that were brought up were Harvard
and MIT’s contribution to the City as nonprofit, how decisions get made about where and how
much funding goes towards a certain area, funding for schools, increasing funding towards other
City departments, statutory laws on budget, the Councils power when it comes to denying an
item on the budget, and the City’s free cash. David Kale and his team were available to respond,
noting that the budget is a tool to implement city programs and policies, it’s not always the first
step on the process of addressing an issue, other planning and steps must happen first and then
the budget makes sure the resources are available to make it happen.
The Chair, Kathleen Born recognized member Patrick Magee who made a motion to
extend the meeting fifteen minutes, the motion was seconded by member Kai Long.
Clerk of Committees Erwin called the roll.

The Chair, Kathleen Born opened Public Comment.
John Hawkinson highlighted comments that were made during the January 3, 2023, meeting
regarding free cash and read a paragraph from the tax rate letter regarding the FY23 budget.
Anna Corning read a Q&A that was submitted through the Zoom during the meeting from
a member of the public:
I’m still a little confused about how exactly the public is participating in the free cash
conversation. Maybe I missed it, but exactly at what meeting is public comment available to
weigh on this in particular? Is it just on the one Council meeting where the Council approves
how free cash is used in the budget to balance the budget, but not the specifics on how it’s used?
If I’m understanding correctly, there are no public meetings specifically about free cash usage,
it’s more like one small part in the budget that the council is voting on.
Members from the Finance team responded, noting that whenever the Finance team goes up to
Council for approval to use free cash that would be an opportunity for the public to weigh in.
Whenever free cash is looked to being used it must go before the Council and would be on the
Council Agenda.
Elliot Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor for the Law Department, commented on a question
member Ellen Shachter raised regarding the power of the City Council denying an item in the
budget and whether they can raise one. Due to it being a legal question that the Finance team was
unable to answer, Elliot noted that the Law Department can research this issue and bring it back
to the Committee after their review analysis.
The Chair, Kathleen born thanked Committee members and the Finance team for participating in
the meeting.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:45p.m.

Member Ellen Shachter had clarifying questions about relaying the basic fundamentals of the
charter to the public, Anna Corning responded by noting she has documents that members can
use to help the public have a better understanding.
Elliot Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor for the Law Department, commented that because the
Charter Review Committee may be starting to take official actions with scheduling community
engagement and reaching out to the public, he advises that members should be taking formal
votes because they are official acts being taken by the Committee, and by doing this there is an
official record. He advised the members that any official action that the committee is taking,
there should be a roll call vote so the Clerk can record it.
The Chair, Kathleen Born had a clarifying question about votes being taken at Planning
Subcommittee meetings. Elliot Veloso responded by noting that if there were a decision by the
Planning Subcommittee, the Subcommittee can take a vote, but that would be a vote to refer it to
the Committee as a whole.
Anna Corning opened up conversation to members of the Committee for comments and concerns
about the discussion notes from the December 20, 2022 meeting, titled “Summary of 12/20
Round Table Discussion” (Attachment C).
Member Ellen Shachter asked if Anna Corning would be able to add Ward versus At Large to
the discussion notes, to which Anna Corning agreed to add.
Member Susan Shell had a clarifying question about rank choice voting. Anna Corning
responded by noting rank choice voting was not a topic that was brought up in the previous
discussion but would add it as a piece members would like to talk about.
Elizabeth Corbo, Human Resource Auditor an Employment Operations Analyst for the Edward
J. Collins, Jr. Center for Public Management, offered comments and suggestions to the members
of the Committee about the discussion notes, stressing the importance of engagement with
community by using a form of government to do that, increasing the transparency and
accountability with voters, creating a balance of authority with the legislative and executive
branches of authority, and making a change in government more accessible to voters.
Elliot Veloso advised the Chair, Kathleen Born, to entertain a motion to place the December 20,
2022 meeting notes on file.

Anna Corning began the meeting by reviewing the next steps for interviews and opened
discussion to members for their input.
Member Ellen Shachter shared their thoughts and concerns about interview questions, and
suggested the focus be more on engagement with the City Council and less focus on the charter.
Jim Stockard noted that he didn’t want to raise expectations for residents and that the committee
should try and be as straight forward as possible to achieve goals for the City.
Member Jennifer Gilbert had a clarifying question on the surveys and suggested if they should be
anonymous because people may be more truthful with their answers. She noted that she hoped to
interview external people who have no ties to Cambridge.
Anna Corning noted that it was a good idea to make the survey anonymous to help people feel as
comfortable as possible.
Member Susan Shell made suggestions on people the Committee could interview.
Member Max Clermont agreed with comments and questions from other members and noted that
starting public engagement and seeing how the process will go sooner is a good idea, Committee
needs to start seeing data.
Member Lisa Peterson noted that if we are expecting to have thirty minute or longer interviews,
members should limit the questions to only four or five. She also suggested that the Committee
look at current and past School Committee members. Most people will have basic opinions, but
others will have very detailed feedback. She suggested focusing on elections and voting.
Chair Born noted that she liked all the suggestions being made by members and is eager to get
started with the process. She noted that it’s ok if discussion is ongoing during the work being
done.
Member Kai Long stressed her concerns about the length of the list and questioned if the
members can organize the list so it’s helpful to the Committee.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen shared concerns about talking to people who are already in the
City government, and noted that the Committees time should be focused on those who are not
currently within the government.
Member Mina Makarious noted the interviews could be productive if the Committee asks to have
members from City Council and other boards and committees allow the Charter Review
Committee interviews to be on their agenda in order to get the feedback the Committee is
looking for and it would be an opportunity for residents to be able to listen in on multiple
occasions.
Member Lisa Peterson suggested doing smaller focus groups and noted the importance of
interviewing neighborhood groups. Noting that the Committee should look in to interviewing
executive directors to get their insight on what is working and what is not working for them as
employees.

Chair Born commented that she has spoken with the City Manager, and he is more than willing
to be interviewed.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared concerns about acting on the community engagement and
interview plans. Jennifer also suggested having the option for Panel or individual survey to help
people being interviewed feel comfortable and whichever setting.
Member Max Clermont had clarifying questions for community outreach.
Anna Corning noted that in January there will be two public forums. The first on Tuesday,
January 24th at a Library for residents to provide comments and then the following Saturday
residents would have the opportunity to participate virtually.
Patrick Hayes Emphasize it is up to the committee to engage with the community and do the
hard work.
Anna Corning opened discussion to all members on what is working about the City Council/City
Manager form of government, what are the challenges about the City Council/City Manager
form of government and should the city form of government stay the same or change. What have
you heard is working well, what needs improvement from members of the community.
Members went into discussion about the challenges and concerns they feel as residents. Noting
that there is a disconnect between the political side of the government and professional side.
Many members commented that they were intrigued by a strong Mayor form government.
Members noted that a goal for the Charter should be to strengthen the government we already
have, and that we should have a government that focuses on helping residents and getting things
done, and that it’s slow to make change in Cambridge. There were comments made that there is
divide between the rich and the poor, and Cambridge does not have a strong middle class. Some
members suggested looking at the School Committee as an option to help with planning and
reorganizing. A big concern was voting for politicians and not seeing the outcome that was
promised.
Chair Born noted that the discussions tonight were very meaningful, and every member had
brought great suggestions and thoughts forward. She thanked members for their input.
Public Comment
John Hawkinson offered informational comments, noting that much of the assessment of the
system seem right now to depend on the new City Manager and the Council supervision of him.
Anna Corning offered members to discuss if there were any lingering questions or comments
based on the discussions of the meeting.
Chair Born suggested the Committee discuss how they would like to proceed with the next
meeting, with hopes that members can take the framework that has been provided and use it to
focus on future discussions.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen stressed the importance of being able to explain form of
government and how the city government operates to people.

Council members and Managers.

The next topic that Anna Corning introduced was to review the forms of government.
Michael Ward did a quick overview of the basic forms of government in Massachusetts, which
included examples from both City and Town governments. Noting that Cambridge uses City
form of government that has the option to use a Mayoral form (elected Mayor leads executive
branch) or Council- Manager form (appointed Manager leads executive branch). They opened it
up to the Committee, looking for what questions members had and what information members
need to know so the Committee can start moving forward.
Member Susan Shell asked if there was any general information, pros and cons, or any thought
out research that members could look at to help with decision making. Michael Ward responded
that it is something the Collins Center could provide. Anna Corning noted that they have also put
resources on the Charter Review website about charter and charter review.
Member Ellen Shachter questioned if the City Council or department heads from the city in the
Executive branches would be able to give feedback on their thoughts. They also questioned if a
survey is possible, to which Michael Ward responded noting that surveys have be done in the
past. Michael suggested that it could be possible to get a panel of Mayors, Managers, and
Councillors from other cities to hear their perspectives. Anna Corning mentioned the possibility
of getting a list of interviewees that could include previous mayors, managers, and department
heads from the City of Cambridge, to gather their thoughts and feedback.

other countries are run. They noted that they are interested in seeing the Charter create a form of
government which welcomes community participation.

Member Nikolas Bowie noted they would like to see what other forms of government look like
besides the two presented and the importance of expanding government to look beyond the City
of Cambridge and Massachusetts.
Member Kai Long noted they liked the idea of having both a Mayor and City Council and noted
they agreed with the idea of looking at other forms of government in other countries to help
make our politics not dependent on personality versus what they are going to do if elected.
Member Max Clermont made comments on a Town Manager and town meetings, and how the
City could incorporate something similar to a town meeting in city government because of the
positive benefits.
Member Lisa Peterson questioned what the accountability should look like for Mayors and City
Managers, what form of resident involvement is best to hold them to their accountability and if
there are any additional ways accountability can be built into the system.
Michael Ward offered final comments and answered some questions that were brought to their
attention during discussion with members.

Ms. Corning next led a review of the submission of values from members. Member Mina Markarious
explained that the writing group attempted to capture sentiments that were broad and pertinent to the
group goals specifically in its initial draft.
Members discussed the draft values document. Member Acevedo explained that the writing group used
the headings from the collective key words received from members to create a concise vision statement.
She asked members if there were sentences or words that were preferred, stating that the writing group
would welcome that feedback on the draft. Ms. Corning explained that the writing team will use the
conversation to prepare a second draft of the values to be voted on in the next meeting. Member Stockard
asked if the group needed to acknowledge the statement sent by Member Susan Shell (and shared with
the committee by Ms. Corning, as Ms. Shell was absent from the meeting). Member Max Clermont stated
that Member Shell’s statements should be considered in the same manner as other submitted thoughts.
Chair Born stated her belief that there is a way to make statements about past wrongs while avoiding
raising tensions without glossing over what has happened through word crafting. Member Peterson stated
that without Member Shell in attendance, her statement should be referred to the next meeting when
Member Shell is present and can articulate her concerns.
Ms. Corning moved the discussion on to the Community Engagement Working Document. The Committee
discussed ideas for public engagement including a revised website, newsletter, virtual/in-person forums,
and mailers to support public engagement. Chair Born stated that there is a 7-member planning committee
and suggested that their first public meeting be to discuss a thought-out plan for community engagement.
PUBLIC COMMENT
Jameson Quinn commented that they are working on a piece regarding voting systems in Cambridge and
other comparable cities and asked for help accessing raw ballot data from recent elections.
The meeting was adjourned at appx 7:35pm.

The motion to place the Communications received by the Committee passed with 13 members
voting in the affirmative and 2 members recorded as absent.
Chair Born introduced Elizabeth Corbo who presented the team from the Collin Center and their follow-up
memo, the purpose of which is to align the themes and values discussed at the last meeting with the
current Charter. Ms. Corbo identified emerging themes including enfranchising and equity, and how these
tie in with the themes of participation and accessibility. Ms. Corbo stated that while some themes can’t be
addressed by the Charter, they were kept on the list. Ms. Corbo concluded the summary of the themes
compiled in the memo with a question to the Committee of whether they would like to set a value
statement where some of the emerging themes might be included. She then asked committee members
for additional themes or questions.
Member Jessica Acevedo asked about stipends, specifically where does budget funding for these come
from and who do stipends go to.
Member Ellen Schachter asked about incorporating technology and asked for clarification on how
including this would not become obsolete quickly.
Member Susan Shell asked about deliberation beyond everyone getting a voice (good decision making)
and whether the Charter has a role in changing the City’s demographics (inclusive of working and middle
class) and making it more people balanced.
Member Nikolas Bowie asked about how the committee will proceed, whether they will go through the
charter section by section or start with key concepts and answer broader questions before narrowing
down. He asked how concepts would be ordered (value statement) and what are the values that would be
agreed upon. He asked what the method of decision making will be adopted by the committee. He also

asked for clarification on whether the value statement would be for the city (as in a preamble to the
Charter), or values to guide decisions and operations of the committee
Chair Born asked about clarifying the process going forward and agreed that the committee might start
by crafting a value statement.
Anna Corning presented a voting method called ‘Fist to Five’ as a method of gauging consensus among
members to facilitate making decisions throughout the process, before making final votes.
Member Lisa Petersen asked if translation services should be required for the general operation of the
city as a part of the theme of Enfranchising and Equity.
Member Jim Stockard stated that the committee should begin the discussion about the value statement
saying that it’s both important and limited and that he would look to the Collins Center to guide the
committee through examples such as public financing of campaigning to increase diversity.
Elizabeth Corbo and Michael Ward engaged in conversation with the members, answering some of
their questions and clarifying points in the memo. Ms. Corbo concluded the discussion of the memo by
saying that once the committee decides how they want to proceed, the Collins Center will provide
discussion memos, trend data, and research to inform discussions.
Member Susan Shell asked for clarification on what the value statement was particularly for (Committee
or the preamble for the city overall). She stated that she would be uncomfortable making a value
statement for the city overall.
Ms. Corbo stated that the only value statement being discussed was pertaining to the Charter Review
Committee alone.
Chair Born recognized a motion form Member Nikolas Bowie to discuss a value statement for the
ensuing 30 minutes, with a limit of 2 minutes per member. At the request of the Chair, the Clerk
took a voice vote, all members voted in the affirmative to proceed as stated in the motion
The committee spent the next 30 minutes discussing ideas for creation of its value statement. The
committee reviewed examples of value statements from other communities including Framingham and
Somerville, with members suggesting ideas that they would like to have incorporated. Ms. Corbo guided
the group by suggesting a 2-part solution of having a value statement and separate operating principles.
Chair Born suggested that each member email values to Anna Corning and Patrick Hayes to compile and
come up with an outline of values and principles for the writing committee to begin working off. Member
Lisa Petersen stressed the importance of clarifying through the values the lens which the committee will
define as critical in looking at the Charter. Member Nikolas Bowie made a motion to invite the Collins
Center to craft a document that mirrors the City Council's division including the discussion of this and
previous meetings. Anna Corning suggested that the committee members take this up, so that it is coming
from the committee, with members Mina Markarious and Jessica Acevedo volunteering to work with the
Collins Center to prepare such a document. Elliot Veloso (Cambridge Law Dept.) reminded the committee
that there are minutes and notes to facilitate production of a committee-driven document. Member Patrick
Magee suggested a friendly amendment to Member Bowie’s motion that the volunteer members join with
the Collins Center in a call to inform the work of the Collins Center on this document.

The motion to place communications received by the Committee on file passed.
The Chair introduced Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center to discuss the memo of the September 9
Charter Review Committee meeting, which detailed discussion questions for this meeting. Ms. Corbo
encouraged members to share things that are working well in Cambridge and things that are not working
as well, acknowledging that not all issues can be addressed through the Charter, as it is a document
dealing primarily with governmental operations. Ms. Corbo explained that these ideas will be
incorporated into the Charter later in the process. Ms. Corbo then opened the floor for members to
share their thoughts and ideas.

Member Faria Afreen asked questions about the City Manager in relation to the City Council, asking
how planning of the annual City budget can be more democratic, funding, and a question about adding
ranked choice to the Charter.
Member Kai Long talked about power, and the desire for more diversity as relates to finances required
to become a City Councillor. She mentioned the perceived inequity in who has the resources to
become a Councillor, the divide in the city between poor and rich (with the rich making decisions that
effect the poor), and how to make city government more about the community and less about money.
Member Mina Makarious expressed support for the previous members thoughts and spoke about the
need to balance the desire for more participation and democratic action without losing the benefits of
having a single unitary government. He expressed concern for what happens in smaller communities
when every single decision becomes a political process particularly the longstanding housing issues
becoming even more politicized and hopes to increase accountability and be nimbler.
Member Ellen Shachter stated the need for understood, value-driven guiding principles, regardless of the
form of government going forward. She wants the committee to explore the value of a ward system, how
to get feedback to the Council regarding departmental needs as relates to the budget, and
public participation and stipends for more representative committees.
Member Kevin Chen spoke about examining some of the structural issues in the City Manager
role, structure of the Council (and potential changes to consider and injecting values into the Charter
(preamble, equity lens provision).
Member Susan Shell shared concerns regarding clarity on what the committee is tasked with, stating that
changes made now must work for future demographics in the city. She stated that there appears to be a
lack of deliberation with a process where opinions can be expressed and there can be productive
conversation and a genuine, deliberative public process.
Member Jennifer Gilbert spoke about how to encourage participation, what can lead to increased voting,
and how the current form of government works in the context of increased need for regional thinking on
issues including housing and climate. She spoke about the need for a system that clarifies accountability
and decision-making and makes participation more approachable. She also asked if there is data
comparing costs to run in other cities using some of the proposed methods.
Member Lisa Peterson shared appreciation for the idea of looking at the Charter with an equity lens
how the City Manager and Council can work together more effectively, and what some barriers to that
might be. She called out the 2-year election cycle as one of the barriers to this efficiency, with a preference
for a 4-year term, to give greater opportunity for the Council to be a team, and act as a body. She also
spoke about the need for the Council to set or reaffirm goals at the start of each term for greater clarity.
Member Patrick Magee agreed with the members before him, adding his hope that the Collins Center
will return with information regarding all that has been suggested regarding pros and cons. He said that
for him, the challenges in Cambridge come down to transparency in the decisions from the City Manager,
how they align with what the Council is asking for, and the impact of strong financial management. He
4
275

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

Packet Pg. 299

cited the example of the Somerville public meeting process as joint meetings of Council and City staff to
increase transparency.
Member Jim Stockard wants to understand the technological advances/increase in technological capacity
going forward, and the ability to share information as relates to facilitating productive dialogue. He
shared ideas around adjusting terms and election cycles and asked if there are ways the budget could
be used to embrace ideas such as reparations, or other powers that could be enabled to better
the
community (asking what is capable through the charter).
Member Nikolas Bowie spoke on the importance of enacting legislation that is important to the people
of Cambridge (demand more local autonomy), increased fiscal autonomy, and more democratic decisionmaking within the city. He talked about the structures lending primarily to those with time, money, and
resources and how to enfranchise the disenfranchised (including those who work here, can’t afford to live
here, etc.).
Member Jessica Acevedo talked about a strength-based approach, and her hopes for some type of
action. She
sees the working-class being pushed out of Cambridge, the direct correlation to the
affordable housing crisis here and comparing national poverty line, and the threshold affordable
housing eligibility here in Cambridge. She also spoke about the other supports needed by citizens
(education, family supports), equitable compensation/support for people’s time to participate in these
conversations and comparing Cambridge to communities farther from home (higher numbers of black
and brown citizens).
Member Ellen Schachter added that there needs to be support in taking some risks, and ways
to challenge the systems within the city that tend toward the status quo and not think out of the box.
Member Kai Long stated the perception of Cambridge and progressiveness, but how the city works
o not reflect that. She said that in thinking about the Charter, the progressiveness needs to be
reflected.
Member Susan Shell compared the Charter to being like a Constitution and wondered if it’s the place
for asserting progressiveness (as related to the purpose of the Charter). She asked that
o
think more broadly about the common ground and not get too carried away with progressive as a label.
Member Mina Makarios asked
the Collins Center and the City Solicitor ould research items
stuck in legislature such as non-citizen voting, rent control, and o
remote public meetings.
Member Faria Afreen added the need to have more information on what is possible
considering legislature constraints and interest in term limits.
Member Jim Stockard followed Member Shell’s statements regarding progressiveness as part of
a preamble stating things the city strives for, including aspirational values.

Chair Born expressed her appreciation for the
discussion and spoke about elections and how
the cycles can hamper collaboration. She expressed concerns about proportional representation, and
the perceived impasses between the Council and the Manager (and clarity on how it works) and her
preference for stability over the ups and downs of different personalities. She reminded everyone of
recent successes in Cambridge,
city support for small businesses during COVID, including

minority and women-run

businesses and the key role of the City Manager in those decisions. She concluded with thoughts about
who can run for Council and how money factors into who can do so.
Ms. Corbo thanked the Committee for their thoughts and expertise, appreciating many of the common
themes. She stated that at the next meeting she will walk the group through the questions and
deliberations the group can undertake to incorporate the ideas shared.
The Chair announced that the Committee will appoint a 7-member planning subcommittee a
volunteers who will work on later drafting and writing (not a subcommittee).
Member Patrick Magee asked if there should be a Vice Chair elected to help share the work.
Elliot Veloso (City Solicitors Office) said the Law Department could look into appointing of a Vice
and suggested that the vote be taken to show that it is the will of the Committee to form a
subcommittee and state its purpose of assisting with planning agendas.
Chair Born recognized Member Ellen Schachter who made a motion to form a planning
subcommittee. The motion was seconded by Member Jessica Acevedo.
At the request of the Chair, the Clerk called the roll.

Lee Farris thanked members for the meeting and asked if there is a way to require the Manager and Council
to agree on goals and metrics. She also asked to see goals between the Manager and Council prioritized in
relationship to each other. She asked if there could be an email list where people could receive notes,
agendas, and materials to build participation.
Jameson Quinn stated their interest
expertise in voting systems and reminded the Committee that
Cambridge already has ranked-choice voting and some pros and cons of this. They hope to assist in refining
the voting systems/process to set it as a model.
John Hawkinson spoke about progressive values in the Charter being blocked by statutory or other

advertise the meetings. She also stated that there will be some updates to the Charter review website to

and hope

think about what is good for all,
regardless of the label of “progressive”.

Chair, Kathleen Born – Yes
The vote was 10 – Yes, and 5-Absent. The motion to accept the minutes from the meeting
held on September 13, 2022, passed.
The Chair gave an overview of her idea for the forming of subcommittees. The two subcommittees
described were for “Agenda Setting” and “Drafting/Writing”. The Chair clarified her goals for the
subcommittees and took a question from Member Ellen Shachter regarding the details of
subcommittees. Libby Corbo of the Collins Center answered some questions from the Chair on
their role in drafting language. Member Mina Makarious directed several questions to the City
Solicitor’s office regarding how subcommittee work relates to open meeting law. Elliot Veloso of
the City Solicitor’s office indicated that their office had concerns about the role subcommittees
could play. The Chair asked Libby Corbo how other cities across Massachusetts worked within
subcommittees and broadly the role that other city law departments played within a review
process. Libby Corbo indicated that they typically do not have much interaction with city law
departments at all during their work, but said that she had spoken on the phone with City Solicitor
Nancy Glowa who said that the City Solicitor’s Office should be involved throughout the process.
Elliot Veloso further stated his concern about the adherence to open meeting law and questioned
whether the subcommittees, as currently understood, would be feasible under the law. The Chair
and Elliot Veloso began an extended conversation about open meeting law and subcommittee
work. Lisa Peterson asked Elliot Veloso about forming less formal, non-decision making,
subcommittee groups to assist in scheduling and agenda-setting. Elliot Veloso indicated his
skepticism in the ability of the Committee to work in subcommittees without breaking the open
meeting law. Elliot Veloso then began reciting the open meeting law briefing materials from the
Massachusetts Attorney General’s website.
The Chair recognized a comment from a member of the public commenting on the subcommittee
work. Member Jennifer Gilbert asked about other ways to overcome the logistical challenges of
planning for meetings. Member Max Clermont asked about simply expanding the current planning
process to make the subcommittee less formal. Elliot Veloso again recited from the Attorney
General’s guidance on open meeting law. Member Kai Long indicated her concern about City
support for the Committee if it would be able to live up to the City Solicitor’s expectations under
the law. Other members indicated agreement with the pressures of adhering to open meeting law
without communicating outside of meeting times. Elliot Veloso indicated the law department
would need to look into the issue further. Committee staff, Patrick Hayes, indicated that the
Committee should move onto other business because of time restraints. The Chair indicated that
she preferred to come to a conclusion on the issue of subcommittee work. Libby Corbo suggested
that the discussion continue between the Chair, the law department, and the Collins Center after
the meeting, as the Committee is limited by time restraints. The Chair asked the law department
whether she could call a vote to form a subcommittee to begin agenda-setting. Elliot Veloso
indicated there were still concerns about open meeting law. The discussion continued until
approximately 6:45pm.
The Chair recognized Member Patrick Magee who made a motion to enter into the public
record the email communications from the Chair to the entire Committee from September
22, 2022 and September 29, 2022. The motion was seconded by Member Kevin Chen.

questions. A copy of the memo is attached to these minutes. The Chair recognized Member Max
Clermont who brought up a discussion of how to engage with public discussion going forward.
The Chair described in detail her ideas for public input and recognized several Members for their
ideas as well. Members Chen, Long, Clermont, Gilbert, Acevedo, Abebe, Magee, and Peterson
indicated their thoughts on public engagement.
Members Peterson and Long, and the Chair indicated their further frustrations with the law
department’s opinion on the Committee’s agenda-setting ability. Elliot Veloso again warned
members about discussing any matters of substance outside of formal meetings. The Chair noted
that she had a discussion with the City Manager about providing further staff options to assist the
Committee with its work. Elliot Veloso again recited directly from the Attorney General’s website
to assist the Committee in understanding open meeting law and their limitations.
The Chair recognized Libby Corbo to discuss the Collins Center’s role in agenda setting and the
broad timeline of their work. Members Abebe, Shachter, and Makarious added their thoughts on

The Chair indicated at 7:20pm that they should begin discussing the Collins Center memo with
discussion topics. Noting the time, Libby Corbo indicated that given the time it might be
pertinent to hear from Committee members. Kai Long talked about the ability of the City to be
responsive to the needs of the community. Mina Makarious talked about which City services can
be addressed by the Charter and which services are outside of the Charter recommendations.
Ellen Shachter spoke about how short terms for City Councillors can hamper the responsiveness
of elected officials. Lisa Peterson spoke about language barriers for folks in the City and
reiterated Ellen Shachter’s thoughts on term length for elected officials. Jessica Acevedo spoke
about working to commit as a City to business owners who are people of color and providing
more opportunities for people of color to become business stakeholders in Cambridge. Patrick
Magee brought up the pros and cons on geographical representation and at-large, elected
officials. Libby Corbo talked about how all these different issues have solutions that can be
found in the Charter review process.

10/23/2023 Jameson Quinn

My name is Dr. Jameson Quinn, a Cambridge resident and voter. You on the charter review
committee know me, as I’ve been attending most of your meetings, and have taken the
opportunity to give public comment many times. But I’d like to briefly reiterate my expertise
and interest in this matter.
I’ve long been interested in voting reform; for instance, I’ve spearheaded the reform to the
nomination voting system for the Hugo Awards, co-organized the British Columbia
Symposium on Proportional Representation which was influential in the design of the 2018
electoral reform referendum there. In fact, my interest in this field was a big part of what
spurred me to get a PhD in statistics.
When I talk to my fellow Cambridge voters about our voting system, I often hear two things
(assuming they even vote in municipal election years). On the one hand, they are proud of a
system that gives them a deeper and clearer voice than most ballots. On the other hand,
they find having so many candidates to rank to be too complex, a burden. Often, they feel
both of these things at once.
I believe that allowing voters to use equal rankings is a simple, feasible change that would
preserve and even strengthen that source of pride, while helping to ease that burden of
complexity. In this article, I will make that argument. But I also want you, the committee, to
understand this issue fully, so I’ll also do my best to lay out all the serious counterarguments
that might be made, and to share both the strengths and the weaknesses of the evidence
behind these arguments.
…
The Single Transferable Voting (STV) system that Cambridge uses was invented in the 19th
century. At the time, it was designed to be counted by putting ballots into piles. Thus, at each
step in the process, all candidates’ vote tallies had to be integers.
This necessity led to two compromises. First, when transferring overvotes, random votes
had to be chosen. For instance, if the quota was one thousand votes, and a candidate got
1,100, one hundred of those votes had to be chosen by some random process. Today,
experts agree that fractional transfer methods, such as the Weighted Inclusive Gregory
Method (WIGM), are fairer.
The other way that STV’s original design was compromised is that equal rankings were
forbidden. If my ballot ranks candidate A as first place, candidates B and C tied for second
place, and candidate D in third place, it will be thrown away as soon as A is eliminated. Even
if B and C are eliminated too, so that my vote unequivocally belongs with D, it will never
count for D. This is a limitation on voter freedom, and a risk of accidental loss of voting
power, that is completely unnecessary with modern counting methods.
As part of the Charter Review Committee’s work, you are now looking at Cambridge’s voting
system. From attending the meetings so far, I think it’s likely that you’ll want to allow election
officials to use the WIGM; after all, this is merely a technical change, invisible to the voters.
But allowing equal rankings would be a small but meaningful change to how voters use the
ballot, and as such, is something that you should consider as a committee, not just leave up
to election officials.
In the following, I’ll lay out arguments in favor of and against this change; followed by a
bibliography; and then an appendix with proposed statutory language.
Arguments in favor
The simplest, and most general, argument in favor is that if allowing equal rankings were the
status quo, essentially nobody would want to forbid them.
● Voters would not want to reduce their freedom to vote as they wished, or to risk
having their vote thrown away if they mis-marked it.
● I believe most politicians, both incumbents and challengers, would value the
less-divisive campaign environment fostered by equal rankings, and would not want
to gamble on the unpredictable individual effects of a change.
● Election administrators would not want to increase the risk of voting paradoxes (see
below).
But here are some more-specific arguments in favor.
1. Allowing equal rankings makes voting easier, possibly increasing
turnout / participation
The typical Cambridge city council election includes over two dozen candidates. Giving
preferences over all of these — or even several — is already a difficult voting task. This
difficulty is a hurdle for any attempt to increase turnout, and minimizing this hurdle is an
important goal.
It’s clearly easier for a voter to class these candidates into broad groups (“I like these two a
lot; these four seem fine; these three seem acceptable; and the rest I dislike”) than to put
each of them into a strict ranked order (“I know these four will get ranks 3 through 6, but
which is which? How can I find some arbitrary distinction so that I can put them in order?”).
Consider the following graph, taken from Maloy and Ward 2021, in a study of a hypothetical
cross-party Ranked Choice ballot for the 2020 Presidential primary in super-Tuesday states.
This shows the probability of “mismarked” ballots for various scenarios. The y axis runs from
a probability of .05 (5%) to .25 (25%). Note that it might be still possible to tally some
“mismarked” ballots in some cases, but that any “mismarking” they were looking at carries
some risk that the voter will be unintentionally disenfranchised.
Unlike the hypothetical single-winner election Maloy and Ward studied, Cambridge’s STV
system is multi-winner. But currently, the basic ballot format and rules for the voter are
similar to the “Rank Ballot” option above. If equal rankings were allowed, that would bring it
closer to the “Grade Ballot” option. In their experiment, such a change would substantially
reduce the risk of a mismarked ballot — which could leave the voter effectively
disenfranchised.
Furthermore, the Cambridge ballot typically has dozens of candidates. The experiment
above shows that even moving just from 6 to 8 candidates increases the downside of a pure
ranked ballot, and thus the relative advantage of a graded ballot that allows equal rankings.
This experiment can not directly be generalized to the Cambridge case. But I believe it does
show that the complexity of a voting system can be a serious problem, and that allowing
equal rankings could ease that problem.
2. Simplifying voting could particularly help underrepresented groups
Consider the following quote from Neely and McDaniel 2015, in a study of voting patterns in
San Francisco’s single-winner Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) system:
“Consistently, precincts where more African-Americans reside are more likely to
collect overvoted, voided ballots. And this often occurs where more Latino, elderly,
foreign-born, and less wealthy folks live. The additional years of data show no
meaningful increase or decline in these tendencies but rather bolster the earlier
study’s findings.” (Neely and McDaniel, 2015, p. 21)
As with the experimental study above, this observational study shows that a ranked system
which disallows equal rankings, comes with risks of mismarked ballots that could
disenfranchise voters. In this case, the voters thus disenfranchised would come
disproportionately from certain groups, in many cases ones that are already disadvantaged
in our political system.
(I believe these findings are relevant and convincing, but I am nevertheless obligated to
share certain caveats. First off, they are based on ecological regression, and thus rely on
unverifiable assumptions to impute from precinct-level variation to individual-level variation.
Second, “African-Americans” are not a monolithic group, and a finding in San Francisco may
not apply to Cambridge. Third, this same paper found similar issues with a “vote for up to
four” race that did not require strict rankings; though an equal-rankings-allowed ballot is
harder to spoil than “vote for up to four”, this suggests that simply moving away from strict
rankings is not necessarily enough to fix the problem. And fourth, the overall magnitude of
the effect, while enough to swing a close election, is not huge. For instance, extrapolating
their results to a precinct with 100% over-65 voters would give up to around 9% excess
spoiled ballots, while a precinct with 100% African-American voters would give 4% excess
spoiled ballots.)
Allowing equal rankings could lead to healthier campaigns
By disallowing equal rankings, the current system forces all voters to pick favorites at every
step. That forces candidates to campaign almost exclusively for first-choice votes. Voting
slates and cooperative campaigns such as A Better Cambridge do exist, but candidates are
pushed to set themselves apart more than they are to stand together.
Allowing equal rankings would moderate these incentives. I believe it would lead to less
negativity and more cooperation in campaigning. I do not pretend that it’s a panacea; politics
will always be politics. But improving the incentives can still make an important difference.
And such more-cooperative campaigns could also be more issue-based, giving voters more
a real choices of direction for the city; and less-expensive, allowing for more diversity of
candidates.
And such an improvement would not have end after campaign season. Candidates who
campaign together more-cooperatively might also govern so once they are elected.
More-robust representation of Cambridge’s diversity
From a voter’s perspective, allowing equal rankings makes it easier to seek both descriptive
and ideological representation. If there is more than one candidate from the group and/or
with the platform you want to see represented, you can vote for all of them as #1, or choose
your favorite and then vote the rest as #2.
And an equal-rankings-allowed STV tallying process would do better at respecting those
joint votes. Without equal rankings, there is an increased possibility that the candidate who
could best represent you is eliminated before your vote transfers to them, meaning your
support for them has no impact on the process. If that happens to enough voters, it could be
that the eliminated candidate actually could have won. This kind of premature elimination
can lead to voting paradoxes, such as the “participation paradox”, where a voter could get an
outcome they like more by not voting at all than by voting their true preferences.
Allowing equal rankings reduces this chance, because as long as there is more than one
surviving candidate at your current top rank your vote is divided equally between them

Community organizing including regular free, outdoor events. Listening to all voices, not just those with the most
power, influence or money.

Trust elected officials to actually represent citizens. Participatory budgeting and online input are great for small-scale
things like park improvements, but in a city of 118,000, there is no substitute for effective representation. Not
everything requires community input (why do we have to hold community meetings for minor zoning petitions?), but
engaging public events where people have the chance to talk face-to-face with their representatives are a great way to
make sure that officials get to hear from a cross-section of the city, not just the people with the time to make calls and

We have a lot of community input processes that disproportionately favor an unrepresentative slice of the city that is
privileged enough to have time to attend meetings. We should rely less on that and more on processes that have
controls to ensure they're representative like scientifically valid surveys or sortition. Additionally, elected officials
ran on a platform and got votes and that should count as representative community input in a stronger way than who
showed up to a meeting on a weeknight and they should have more leeway execute on that platform without needing
to constantly go back to the community.
I think there's an opportunity to open up committee and commission roles more often and more broadly. I feel like
every time I go look, there's never an opening on one I'm interested in or qualified to join.

modernizing the City website would help, including a more intuitive user experience. For example, in my experience,

The city already does a great job when they wish to. BEUDO was a great example of an incredibly poor outreach.
The council seems to be somewhat arbitrary about when process is necessary and CDD is too lacking in opinion and

of childcare issues, not being able to miss work, speaking a language other than English, etc. Also, not everyone feels
like their voice is valued, since they don't see change come from sharing their opinion. Furthermore, some people feel
alienated at community meetings/hearings (for example, at meetings about the AHO amendments, there was a lot of
negative sentiments being spread about people who live in public housing). The city can work on engaging with
people where they live, where they work, and where they spend their leisure time (in parks, housing developments,

City Council is basically an advisory board, and elected through a confusing process. Most of the literature calls this
'proportional representation', but that would suggest that voters would be allowed to choose a platform with a slate of
candidates, rather than ranking candidates with (often very similar) platforms from a nonpartisan list. I would rather
see a true proportional representation where candidates affiliate with a platform. Plenty of municipalities use this
system successfully, because it allows voters to choose candidates based on local priorities, rather than trying to learn
about all 22 (in last year's election) candidates, and somehow rank them. I don't believe that the council-manager

Really not a fan of the weak mayoral system. The City Manager position seems too powerful to be this far removed
from voters and without enough checks and balances. I'm a Cambridge native and am in strong favor of restructuring
the management of our city to eliminate this position and be under the control of a Mayor directly elected by, and
directly accountable to, us, the residents.
Create districts with councillors assigned to represent that district.

The current Council/Manager structure works well, particularly since we have had effective Managers who have paid
attention to the long-term financial health of the city.The two-year term for Councillors means that the Council makeup changes frequently. So though there is relative consistency over multiple terms, single-issue groups are able to
disproportionately influence and staff the Council.For these reasons, and because the Manager typically serves over
many election cycles, we benefit from a pragmatic, middle-of-the-road Manager who can keep her/his eye on the
overall picture and trends, and can temper some of the more aggressive initiatives while advancing City and Council
objectives. To put it another way, we need the Manager to be a voice of reason, balancing desires and goals with
practical realities and the overall health of the city.I believe that the City has been fortunate in this regard over at least

Cambridge residents are experiencing harm and homelessness resulting from limited action from City professional
when landlords decide to actively discriminate against tenants who have been awarded ARPA Eviction Prevention
and/or COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Funds by refusing to provide the information necessary to receive funds in
favor of evicting these Cambridge residents. I was told by City professionals that there were many people having
similar experiences. Yet I was told by the person in the City Hall finance department, that they had never heard that
landlords were refusing to take the steps to receive funds. I asked them where is the document that explains what
should happen if a landlord refuses to take the funds. They said that such a document does not exist. MAKE THAT
DOCUMENT EXSIST!!! Or be honest with your residents about not actually being concerned with their well-being

I strongly support keeping our existing proportional representation system and hope we don't move to wards. PR
ensures every election is competitive & almost every voter has an elected councilor they voted for as one of their top
preferences. The current system allows councilors to get most of their votes from one geographical area and we can
see that usually doesn't happen so it doesn't make sense to impose wards when voters don't seem to see geography of
the city as a primary issue. Ward based councilors would likely focus more on protecting the area they represent at
the expense of focusing on citywide needs.
I also think there needs to be more advanced notice and mechanisms for feedback (and then responding too and
hopefully actually incorporating) from residents before implementing polices and budgets.

Cambridge has a very vocal, highly visible, very progressive cohort, which is well-represented on the City Council.
But despite their thinking so, that cohort does not represent the entire spectrum of city residents, and may not actually
even represent the majority of the citizenry beyond the core that votes in city elections.Many of the progressive
policies and ideas are laudable, but the vigorous pursuit of them is very often not clearly thought-through. The result
is that unintended consequences seem to frequently crop up as these policies are implemented. It is also not unusual
for proponents to dismiss or disregard known downsides of some substantial initiatives because of their view that the
ends justify any means.It would be really great if we can figure out a way to get more people to vote. I think two
main reasons that people don't vote are that they don't think they know enough about the candidates and issues to vote
James Mahoney intelligently, and that they don't think their vote will matter.
Keep a strong city manager form of governance. It provides better fiscal accountability. Do away with PR voting.
Move to district-elected councilors and at large councilors. We don't need fully staffed full-time councilors in a city
our size, a very costly and unnecessary expense should be a stipend only.

Given the vast diversity in our community and our poor voter turnout having a city manager provides a good check

Cambridge is already one the most densely populated cities in the country, trying to add tens of thousands of more

Incentivize developers to build high quality middle income housing (not market rate, that is too expensive for many
professional/ academic middle class workers).
- Provide a tutorial session explaining the main concepts and nuances of the existing charter, the main concepts of
how the city government in Cambridge currently functions, and the changes that are being considered. This can be
provided both in person, with Q&A at the end, and as an online video (with a person to contact if you have
questions).- Continue to provide ways for residents to express their views, not only online, but also in-person and via
mail.- The charter review is an opportunity to educate our students. Provide a video that teachers can show at the
upper elementary/middle school/high school levels, along with some suggested discussion questions. Give the
students a mechanism for suggesting changes (e.g. a student-specific questionnaire with some open-ended questions),
so they feel involved at an early age

Landlords discriminating (Chapter 151B section 4 subsection 10) against tenants who have been awarded Cambridge

I don't think Cambridge can really address this on its own.
We need to allow for higher dense housing to be built in the city. Mix used buildings that include residential and are
not only research/office towers. Makes no sense to only build commercial/office when we have a high demand for
more affordable housing. We need to build taller structures in the city to accommodate the housing demand the city is
facing. It's ludicrous that the average rent in Cambridge is at $3000 a month. The primary obstacle to addressing it is

Sustainability. The climate crisis working group report has the answers. But also, Cambridge must address the rich
businesses that fight progress (see: Harvard claiming reducing emissions for BEUDO is impossible, as if they can’t
generate or store any energy). Eversource and the MBTA are dangerously sub-par and they make sustainability
difficult. We the people don’t have the power to fight them, so we need your help. Equality, cost of living, housing,
addiction, mental illness, lack of community and resources, are all factors that impact sustainability, which makes
people question how to prioritize. The answer comes in the only clear villain—excessive profit. When we fight big
business, we can protect our rights and quality of life. When we reflect on how Cambridge can improve, I’d naturally
question how we can align action better with belief. Everyone in our city council, if not the whole city government,
knows the threat of climate change and wants us to be more sustainable, but belief isn’t enough to make change.
Actions from our fearless leaders led to the BEUDO amendments, an incredible victory that will make Cambridge a
leader in sustainability. Actions like creating a fund to retrofit homes and apartments funded by businesses trying to
offset emissions. Actions like ensuring diversity of electricity sources to avoid the Eversource local monopoly.
Actions like banning Target’s greenwashed thick plastic bags or protecting bike lanes. I can’t wait for more

Housing affordability is certainly a big issue, but I don’t think that our City Council can do much to effectively

Lack of affordable housing for non-student workers earning less than $200,000. Lack of availability of medical
doctors, especially primary care but also specialists. I am not aware of initiatives to address either.
Increasing drug activity and violent crime.Cambridge police lack basic equipment like body cams and vehicle video
surveillance, and do not have a narcotics unit.
Crime in Central Sq, Weak School system, and lack of follow through on planning. The council largely gets in the
way of any progress in large part due to fickle interest and lack of fundamental understanding of the subject matter.
It's easier to move on or just throw money at a problem than trying to manage it better or act.
Not enough housing

Housing costs. Cambridge desperately needs more housing (as does the whole region). Folks need to stop fearing

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, all his life.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Councilor, Vice Mayor and Mayor (15 years total). Then elected to the state senate.
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
The dynamic of getting the city manager to pay attention to his priorities. Requires relationship, seniority,
and political relationships.
A mayor saw more specifics with plan e. Lawsuits at the school level, race, and class and always below
the surface in Cambridge.
Saw the mayor's role as the mediator, when there were major issues and dynamics to navigate it was a
good role for the mayor to step into rather than the manager.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
The biggest frustration is the lack of populism. I made a point to get votes across the city, and didn't want
to be viewed as someone that only had a certain constituency.
Leadership as mayor among other councilors who don’t necessarily always want you to lead initiatives
because they have to run against you. A different dynamic with the school committee who isn’t running
against you could be more of a leader.
What if no mayor?
● There are multiple different perspectives of the mayor's role. I see it as a mediator role, and I don't
think the city would benefit from not having a mayor.
● But I think we could benefit from a bit of a job description for the role because everyone sees it
differently. You need a political leader in the city.
Separately elected mayor?
● Do you have to look at it from what is the best long-term process for the city? What I would
worry about, is the long term, what if 6 councilors announce they are running for mayor and then
maybe lose a huge portion of the councilors
● If you have a separately elected mayor maybe impose a term limit
Other:
● I think part of the goal I’m hearing is increasing engagement and democracy - and I don’t think a
strong mayor or longer term for council necessarily would increase voter engagement

●
●
●

I don’t agree that the city council inherently doesn’t have power, it's built on whether there is an
incentive to work together or not.
People/ residents will often say more democracy, if you pose the question to them about a
separate election for mayor many would say yes
I think this charter review was more of a power grab than a desire for more democracy

Budget - do you think the council has enough weight on the manager's budget?
● The budget is central to the government. There should be a strategy around the budget ongoing
constantly. But I do think there is a need for more engaging ways for the public to participate in
the budget process outside of public comment.
● I do think the council has significant power in the current budget process if they work together.
Engagement
● We are lacking productive and inclusive engagement.
● We don’t inform the public - how do we inform people? It’s very easy to stack a public meeting,
but there are ways to bring individuals from different perspectives together to have a
conversation.
We should be thinking about what is going to continue to attract strong candidates for the city manager
position if we were worried about that position and the well of candidates that would fill that type of role.
If we are worried about that, then I might be more in favor of a strong mayor. However, the recent city
manager process proves there is a good talent pool and the selection and process supports the strong
Manager form of government so there is no need to look to a strong Mayor

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
No.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to the City government?
Now retired, I spent about 30 years in the law department, started as an assistant city solicitor, first
assistant solicitor, and then moved to deputy city solicitor for 8 years.
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
Acting Chair of Licensing Commission - 5 months.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you to do
your office to do its job well?
● During my time in the solicitor's office the number of attorneys grew from 6 to about 11 full time
attorneys. The growth was a result of an increase in demands of the city council, keeping up with
new initiatives, representing the city in litigation, advising boards/councils, and drafting
ordinances.
● Part of the solicitor’s office role is to interpret the city charter, when there are questions about
provisions in the charter they come to the law department whether informally or formal opinions.
● I worked under Bob Healy, Rich Rossi and Louis DePasquale. What was interesting was how
each manager interpreted their powers. Healy interpreted a bit more conservatively in terms of
their responsibility over city department heads. In the charter city councilors are not supposed to
deal directly with employees of the city manager outside of public meetings, and Healy protected
his employees very conservatively. Didn’t want city employees talking directly to city councilors,
managed everything through him. I thought this was a good separation of powers because it
protects employees and allows them to do their job within a clear administrative hierarchy.
● As Richie and then Louis moved into the city manager role they were more liberal in
allowing councilors to interact directly with city employees. Perhaps some public thought was
that Healy was too rigid with his interpretation. Under Richie councilors started meeting in
private more directly with employees about policy initiatives. Louie might have encouraged even
more. I think this dynamic can create a complicated situation for city employees.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
With any structure you are relying on good people who are willing to collaborate in those roles to make it
function well. Any form will have abuses and push limits of powers, and some people might not want to
cooperate, if that's the kind of person they are.
6. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Personalities are always at play but not structural issues.
7. Some of the items that the Charter can impact are issues such as terms for elected officers,
department head and committee appointment authority, structure of and allocation of

323

Attachment: 1_23_24 (2) Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (21973 : A communication was received from Anna Corning,

a

Packet Pg. 347

authority in City government, budget process, elections and voting. Do you have any
additional thoughts you would like to share regarding those issues?
Budget process - we’ve heard that that process could be more transparent and open to the public?
● I think the managers feel they were appointed because of their financial expertise and their
department heads know their departments best. Opening it up more to council and public has the
potential to politicize the process and perhaps make it hard to make objective decisions based on
an informed understanding of all the considerations involved in putting a complex overall city
budget together. I understand frustration from CC and the public: the manager spends months
putting together the budget, and when it comes to the council, they have limited time to ask
questions, and minimal resources to review and analyze. There could be more flexibility along the
way, it seems like now the council is giving the manager priorities and the manager is funding
their priorities.
8. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Informational Charter Elements:
● Charter Right - Process written into the council rules but comes from MGLA (Chapter 43,
Section 22 of the General Laws.).
● The current charter requires a city council vote on an expenditure of fifty dollars or more, which
probably should be changed/ reflective of inflation.
● The charter states the council will set the manager’s salary by ordinance, which isn’t done
anymore, it's defined in the contract
● Make charter language gender neutral
● Repealed MGLA Chapter 54A still applies to Cambridge proportional representation (“PR”)
voting in local elections
Current Provisions
“mayor could take control of the police if there is a vote of the council”
● This hasn't happened. And since the manager appoints/oversees the police, not sure it really
makes sense. It should be the manager.
“the right to public comment”
● Says all meetings of city council should provide opportunity for the public to be heard. I don't
think this needs to change but under OML there isn’t a right to public comment. So if you did
away with this public comment right in the charter, the Council wouldn’t have to allow public
comment in the same manner that it’s done now.
Number of Councilors
● No real opinion, doesn’t feel the number is super critical
Ward vs At-Large Councilors
● No real opinion - I know the general idea behind ward councilors - to represent specific parts of
the city. I think with PR in Cambridge, actually does empower minorities in certain areas - tim
toomey (east Cambridge) - if you have a certain minimum votes under PR, in a way for a specific
area to have a representative.
Elections on even years?
● The elections commission might have concerns about moving elections to even years. Would it
impact the PR?
Current process how councilors choose mayor - seems time consuming, done behind the scenes?

●

Probably not the best way to choose a mayor, could move to a popular vote. The other thing is
that councilors should be careful to comply with the OML, so that a quorum is not deliberating
outside of public meetings to determine who the mayor will be.
Free cash - Why isn’t it subject to budget planning in the same way?
● Not sure why it couldn't be discussed in advance, although free cash is typically addressing an
urgent need that might arise at any time during the year. But there is so much of it and some is
planned.

3. Have you held other positions with the city?
Deputy city manager
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
Allows for the manager to manage and for the elected city council to do policy/ legislation.
The basic foundation of any city is finance, if you don't have fiscal stability you can’t do all the programs
that you’d want.
Managing the city as a business with residents as the customers.
Thinks the system works well and has been stable over most of the 80 years of the charter.
How do priorities like municipal broadband get funded or not funded? How do those decisions get made
and what are the inputs?
● Cost / Benefit analysis - initial financial cost and long-term maintenance cost
● If the council / public mandate something the manager has to comply the manager reports to the
council and the council can always fire the manager.
All the various elements of the city and the organizations are a sort of extension of the city and help
provide the eyes and ears to the community.
How does information/ feedback flow to manager? Is it just through the city council?
● No, the manager also listens and hears directly from the public, the manager shouldn’t isolate
themselves
District vs At-Large Councilors
● PR works with Plan E, and I think the number of councilors is appropriate
● I don’t think a district councilor would be beneficial for the city as a whole, focused too much on
individual issues.
Elections
● I think RCV works well, if it's working well why try to break it
Mayor’s Role
● Important role on the School Committee
● The mayor is the political role of the city and needs to be out there and doing more than other
councilors
● City Council can declare a state of emergency and put Mayor in charge.

2. Have you held other positions with the city?
Currently - CEO and President of the Chamber of Commerce
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
I always felt like the plan E form of government was good. But more recently I wonder if we might be
outgrowing that form.
The current feeling feels like weekly whiplash, and I believe that is coming from the council. And part of
that is coming from not having defined goals and objectives. Which leads to a clouding of what the
council is and supposed to be.
Feels disjointed right now, doesn’t necessarily mean we need to throw it out.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
Lack of goals/objectives.
At the state level there is a very defined legislative process, but on the local level ideas and legislation are
all over the place.
There needs to be more leadership among themselves to not take on everything, and leave to the staff a
number of items they are capable of handling.
Staff should be more willing to share their expertise but they feel hesitant to do so because they often get
undermined by the council
5. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Worked with three different managers, and saw the change in their management styles.
I think the role of elected officials has morphed less of oversight to more interfering in day-to-day
operations.
● The council hasn’t done a good job of defining objectives and holding themselves to it
6. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Four-year terms for councilors?
● No, the council should be as close to the public as possible. Even though it might benefit the
councilors.
District Councilors?

I’d be worried about that change. We somewhat have them already in how the council builds its
base of voters. I think we are a small enough city that we can do this without breaking up the city
into districts.

City Council over time?
● Early on the council was much more collegial, we worked together. It wasn’t about what I wanted
or other councilors wanted but about finding common ground.
● The council now is much more in silos and they aren’t collaborating together
● Should be thinking about the council as a board/supervisors with the mayor as the chair.
○ When hiring a manager there should be clear goals and priorities that the manager can be
deemed successful against. But the council is lacking that right now.
● There is a lack of accountability/transparency. There should be x committee meetings
At the state level there is a defined legislative process:
● Filing deadline (all bills for the term need to be put forward), review period (in committee
hashing items out, public meetings), then referred from committee to full leg and vote.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, went to MIT for undergrad and has lived in Cambridge since then for 53 years.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Councilor for 10 years in 80s.
Other positions: lawyer in state government, elections division, state ethics commission, counsel for
senate ways and means, counsel for administration and finance, chief policy advisor for state senate
president.
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
Cambridge overall has a pretty successful structure and is a well-run city. Large universities, a magnet for
intelligent/successful people, transformation of Kendall square, ability to build a strong tax base,
competent civil servants.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
I like the City Council structure, don’t think it needs to change. Representative of different points of view,
ideologies, and areas of the city. The various points of view have been well represented across major issue
areas like rent control, and affordable housing. I do not favor any form of district representation, I know it
does work in some structures and without PR it’s helpful in increasing representation. PR does a great job
of accomplishing various forms of representation, you could vote for your neighborhood rep or vote based
on a larger city-wide issue, but it is left up to the voters.
Executive leadership: I think a strong mayor form of government should be strongly considered. City
Manager does a great job with efficiency, fiscal responsibility, and day-day ops, it is not as good at
changing policy. Because the city manager isn’t supposed to get involved/advocate for specific policies.
The city manager contract clause, where if the city council wants to discharge a manager they have to pay
a huge amount, which is a big disincentive for the city council. And as a result, they never discharge a
manager.
If you are trying to change a policy, it is really hard to get done without executive leadership. A Managers
teams can provide information/technical assistance but is not involved in the politics in the way an elected
mayor can be
At the state level without the governor, it would be impossible for the legislature to get stuff done. The
executive can provide political pressure necessary to get votes.
Priorities with an elected strong mayor:
● Democracy, which is hard with a city manager
● Candidate can run on a policy-related platform and can execute on it

Maybe a hybrid system with a strong mayor, with a COO hired by the mayor maybe confirmed by the
council. Could help with maintaining a strong administration.
How might stability be affected by an elected mayor that might change every 2/4 years?
● Definitely a concern, pros, and cons of all systems. Balance is the key. The nature of democracy
is that voters get to change things, including their leadership. And although stability is good for
the structure of the city, should for example one person be in a specific department head role for
10, 20 years? The balance should lean more in the direction of democratic accountability and
change when necessary, rather than towards stability.
You mentioned maybe having city council approve a coo position under a strong mayor?
● For balance, it would be good, but the potential downside is if the council doesn’t want to
approve someone. The mayor should be able to hire someone they trust and can work with. Risk
for abuse.
Sticking with Manager / Council form - what could be changed?
● Wouldn’t favor changes to the current council structure/term/size.
● Remove buy out clause in the manager contract
● Maybe modify the charter to allow manager/staff to get more involved in policy
● Is there any other remedy or recourse with the manager to hold accountable that isn’t firing?
○ No, there really isn’t
How do you see the strength of employees under a manager vs an elected mayor?
● Yes, exceptional employees with stable jobs is an obvious advantage to a citymanager. But there
are a lot of examples of exceptional employees working for elected officials at the local and state
level.
Would a change to mayor change Cambridge’s position in state politics?
● I think it could strengthen Cambridge’s role. An elected person would empower the executive for
Cambridge in relation to neighbors.
Budget Process - how might be improved?
● It is already starting to happen, the current manager is deliberately encouraging councilors to
bring ideas about the budget forward. Maybe creating a more formalized process? Implement
hearings earlier in the process to hear input.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, since just after college.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to the City government?
Left following 2 years as Mayor, before that 14 years as City Councilor, and 8 years on the
School Committee
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you to do
your office to do its job well?
There are a lot of strengths in the current form. I really care about getting policy through and
implemented. Having a good relationship with a professional staff, made a significant difference. Lots of
opinions about what to do, and helpful to see what the professionals are doing. I relied on them for their
expertise. I could do my part as Mayor to get policy through the council. I think about 3 aspects of
government the people, politicians and professionals to get things done. Helpful to think about the city in
this way and know my role.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
Not a lot of challenges with the structure. I know there is a perception around how to get popular ideas
implemented, for example broadband, I wanted to see that implemented across the city. But it hit a wall in
the manager's office, because they explained the actual cost and obstacles to getting it implemented.
NLC involvement, so I could see how things were being done in other communities. And understood
there were other communities struggling to get issues through, there are genuine obstacles to policy
initiatives.
In Cambridge, because of professional management, once we are able to work through a policy initiative
or idea, the implementation is very effective and sticks and continues to improve over time.
● Ex climate initiatives - started little by little bringing colleagues along and other parts of
government. And now a leading city in climate
● When redoing high school Manager didn't want to pay extra dollars to have an effective cafeteria
which would have an impact on the quality of food, and between the councilors, staff and public
engagement they did end up implementing it.
○ Manager maybe didn’t want to recommend the cafeteria but he said if there are at least 5
votes that's what I have to do, but an individual councilor can’t direct this. So requires
the council to coalesce around an issue or policy.

City Council Goal Setting
● During her tenure, they were doing the goal setting every other year. And it was a great
mechanism to reflect back on, because they were in agreement on what their goals were.
5. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Council Relationships
● No one person on the council could do anything, so the only way to get things done was with
majority/supermajority. Needed to create coalitions around issues, in order to move forward. I
sought support from the staff - did they buy in around an idea, was it possible?
● Elections of mayor is a starting point for coalitions. Building an idea of who you could look to for
support on ideas. .
6. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Issue around schools
● Some city councilors feel they should be able to medal in the school committee and their budget.
I want as a citizen to make sure your committee knows that is an important separation of powers
because the school committee knows best for the school system.
Running for Office / How do we get more inclusive in this system?
● It's very different now, than when she ran because they had a local newspaper and capacity for
anyone to find out what was going on in the city for free or not a lot of money. With a lack of a
local newspaper it can be difficult to figure out what is happening in the city.
● Concerned about how anyone can vote for anything, when all information needs to be sought out
online.
● I think district councilors could help fill that void.
● Always a supporter of at-large PR, good for the city, and coalesced ideas that were important all
around.. But local representation like a district councilor, a point of connection. I’m not sure if
at-large government works as well as it used to.
○ Example in Outer Cape - there is the providence town independent, you know everything
that is going on in the outer cape. Why is a building like x, what's the housing policy,
who is blocking it.
○ Maybe district government is a solution, could serve people better because someone is
accountable in your neighborhood. - ex tim toomey (east cambridge)
○ A lot of councilors come from west campaign because maybe that's where there is $$
● State Representative Race - I know very little about him as a candidate and campaign.
Term length / term limits
● I like the idea of running every two years for the state rep/senators, at least I get to see this
person every two years, and have a concept of who they are.
● 4 years might be good / better if there were district councilors
● Definitely would need more research to figure out how it really works, who’s voting, who’s not
voting, who feels like they know what’s happening
● Look at the public, instead of the person running for the office - what makes for the best
representation

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
No
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
Superintendent of Schools 2009 - 2016
Had over 20 years of superintendent experience prior to being hired in Cambridge. Superintendent in
Cambridge from 2009 - 2016. Came from 11 years as superintendent in Newton. And Lexington and
Lynnfield prior to that.
3. What else do you want us to know?
School Committee
● Surprised about the way school committee members ran every two years but were all at-large. His
prior experience with Newton had a much different composition. Newton has 8 wards; there was
1 school committee member from each ward. All members were elected city wide but only ran
against others from their same ward.
○ Charter Text: “Eight of these members, who shall be known as school committee
members, shall be nominated and elected by the voters at large, 1 school committee
member to be elected from each of the 8 wards of the city”
● His perception of the way Newton’s school committee was structured was once the committee
was seated, the incentive was to collaborate because you’d never be running against the other
members on the committee.
● Members running against each other in Cambridge created a different culture on the school
committee.
● The pay difference was significant between Newton ($7,750) / Cambridge ($38,000)
○ Cultural difference - believed the idea was to diversify the economic standing of those
running and on the Cambridge School Committee. His general sense was that most of the
members were middle class.
■ One observation was that if they were making $30k/$40k, a possible effect is that
you want to keep that income steam. If that meant competing against other
members on the board which lend itself to less than pure intentions/dynamics.
■ Some members had other jobs and others didn’t - for both groups the income was
still important, but for those that didn't have another job, the school committee
became their job. And that's a really different environment from most school
committees in MA. If this is my job I should do a lot and be really involved. In
other communities, school committees tended to focus more on high-level policy
rather than getting involved in the day-to-day functions.

He would work with CFO Claire Spinner, COO Jim Maloney, principals, staff, union and
curriculum staff, to figure out what was needed in the budget. Around January would present the
proposed budget (based on internal discussion, public meetings and meeting with city).
The superintendent's budget was always balanced
○ because would meet with the manager and finance director they would say we have x
money and need is x. And over weeks would figure out how to come to an agreement.
The City would make an effort to increase if needed and as superintendent, I would make
edits internally if needed.

Superintendent proposed budget → school committees approved budget → city council (meeting) →
pretty much they just approved what the school was doing. I can’t recall a specific time when they refuted
a specific item.
● Before we even began the budget process, would meet publicly with SC. you give us
guidelines/goals and his job was to build a budget that reflected those guidelines.
Who was it that you were talking to / oversight from when building a budget? Did you have the support
you ended to do it well?
● Hearing from school principals, curriculum leaders and teachers, and public hearings. It was
always about all of those inputs.
● I felt like the systems that were in place, I was in schools all the time, and feedback from people
who were in the schools all the time, public hearings, parents/families/caregivers, and I had
enough to put together.
Distinct structural differences between Cambridge / Other places?
● Strong city manager form vs newton's strong mayor - it was the personal relationships that
superseded any structural impediments.
○ presumably, the managers would have been more in a professional position with training/
other professional development around running a city. Able to talk to those managers in
an almost shorthand because of their professional experience.
○ Mayor system/ newton: relied on his legislative background, and I think because we built
a relationship the trust was there. Even though that mayor wasn’t exactly trained in
finance/ professional management
● Trust relationships with School Committee?
○ Some were very positive relationships and some are not so positive.
○ When I was first appointed it was originally a 5-2 vote (against - fred, denise) after the
1st vote fred said let's have a show of support, and changed his vote, denise didn’t, final
vote 6-1.
○ And again a few years later another vote, so that always creates a dynamic for
relationships because some people don’t vote for you.
Constraints on your ability to hire who you wanted to hire?
1993 reform act
● Took SC out of personal decisions
● SC power hire/fire superintendent who has the power for all other personal

The school committee never messed with any personnel appointments nor the manager.

Structural things to be done differently to address race issues?
- Desegregation
- Control choice policy, like most policies in US is about desegregating.
- A technical/ mechanical of school assignments
- Integration
- What happens within those schools once those kids are there is “integration” whether it
happens or not. Curriculum, family engagement, teachers, etc.
- 6/7/8 - Kto5 was ok and high school was pretty good, and 6/7/8 was the dead zone.
- One of the biggest ones was those teachers in 6/7/8 weren’t licensed/ in the subject areas
that they were teaching
- Comparing graduations in 8th grade, 50 at king open or 10 at the FMA school.
- Those kids in the smaller graduating class struggled because they had teachers
that were teaching across grades and subjects that they weren’t experts in
- Lack of curriculum was also a significant impact
- What is the school committee's role in maybe a struggling curriculum or teachers, etc?
Maybe wouldn’t want to have SC leading those changes because they don’t
necessarily have an educational background.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Councilor - 1 term. 2020/2021, On the housing committee and chair of the transportation committee.
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
N/A
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
It pays enough to be a full-time job, which I viewed as a positive. Especially during the pandemic which
required a lot of extra meetings and attention. Having a dedicated legislative aid to help with constituents,
notes, etc was particularly helpful.
Able to develop good relationships with other councilors, committee system was ok / worked well. Virtual
meetings were helpful.
Great that the council now has to approve appointments to certain boards and commissions, would be
great to add that oversight with department heads.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
With a strong manager/ weak council system, it was challenging to get things done as a councilor. Boston
for example with the Mayor/Council system has more clear paths for accountability that Cambridge lacks.
The process of councilors voting on the manager's contract is not clear to the public and lacks
accountability.
● The only existing mechanism for accountability is to fire the manager, which requires a lot of
money and an extensive process to replace. More challenging than having an election every 2/4
years like a mayor.
● Right now there are few ways to bring the city manager to the table on issues, if the council feels
like they aren’t heading in the right direction.
Relies on the manager to take action - like whether police have body cameras.
Council doesn’t have the ability to:
● add to the budget
● Provide oversight on personal decisions
● Infrastructure projects

Culture of funneling items through the manager, if you want to collaborate with staff on an idea or
initiative. Things take longer / potential for conflict.
Positive movement /change to pass informal goal checks on managers every # of years on certain goals.
Budget oversight:
● If the council votes down the budget its a nuclear option, but there is no other recourse in the
review of the budget
● Abiilty to move around elements of the budget.
City Solicitor
● Maybe change the structure so the solicitor reports to the council - like in Malden.
● For example, when the council tried to get rid of teargas, the solicitor wouldn’t draft the
ordinance.
● A mirror to the current system with the city clerk - the council hired the clerk and the council
could fire the city clerk.
Department Heads
● Confirmation of key department heads - like police chief / cdd.
● Would be good to set up meetings between department heads/staff and council/councilors on
items that they are trying to get answers on. It’s difficult because of the division between
council/department heads.
○ Challenging to make any electoral issue, because of limited resources for councilors.
Staff
●
●

Additional staff for the council would be helpful, maybe a centralized communications person or
another shared person for specific tasks.
Providence has 1 or 2 communication staffers so when the council passes something, they are
tasked with getting that news out. Would like to see more press releases/ interviews, spreading the
word about what Cambridge is doing.

Form of Government
● Generally supportive of an elected mayor. But even with that system, would want to strengthen
the legislative and balance that power between the branches
6. Anything else you would like us to know ?
RCV / At Large Elections / Term Lengths
● Change elections to even years - Portland, Maine
● Single transferable vote / RCV
○ Pros and cons - I wish more cities had it for comparison.
● District / At-Large
○ I did a lot of door-knocking and got 1500 renters to vote for me. If I was running to
represent one district I don't know if I would have gotten elected

●
●

Difficult to have regional representation with the current system. Maybe if you had a mix
of at large / district. Maybe multi-member districts - maybe like 3 elected RCV.
○ How lines are being drawn if there was a district councilor system.
The difficulty of the current system of single tranferable vote, is that its confusing for people. maybe explore other forms of RCV, dual transferable vote?
Right now, the people who vote get more representation. But the flip side is that certain
communities vote more and reason that others not voting.

Term lengths
● 2 years is short, and a lot of the second year is focused on running. Public financing could be
helpful to alleviate the time spent campaigning
● 4 years might be a long commitment, especially for young people looking to run. Maybe
staggered 3 year terms?
● Term limits - don't know about that, generally think more about term limits for executive but not
for legislative at least at the state level, it takes a lot of time to do the community organizing
work.
● Maybe term limits for manager or elected mayor.
Campaign fundraising
● The biggest challenge is that people are donating small amounts not 1,000 dollars to campaigns.
● CT/RH - have public financing for elections.
● Don't want to give money to people who run every two years but are not actually running, free
money. Require people to have x number of donations to get public funding.
Relationship to constituents / supposedly representing the whole city
● Constituent service is more challenging with an at-large system. Because people don't know who
their counselor is to go to. If they don't know who to go to, they email the whole council and
either get no responses or 4 councilors responding.
Why support charter review?
● Cambridge hadn’t done it in 80 years. And seemed like a good process to start
● Split throughout the process on having an appointed vs elected committee. Collins Center had
worked with elected commissions and saw that they tend to fail at higher rates.
○ Supporter of direct democracy, but always more political aspects

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Have lived in Cambridge my whole life.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Manager
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
After college I worked in the Treasury Department, eventually transferred to the budget office. Promoted
to budget director (20 years). Assistant City Manager for Finance (15 years), then City Manager (6 years).
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
The incredible team working for the city was always a highlight for me and a major appeal to apply for
manager positions. Public service is a thread throughout the team.
I have always had a customer service mindset. Government doesn’t work for everyone because people
don't come to city hall because they aren’t comfortable, but over the last 20 years the city has made
progress. We made an effort to reach out to different groups, and worked to help residents of Cambridge
see themselves in the city government.
I feel the manager system works well. Mayor structures can also be effective systems, but I think the
manager structure works for Cambridge.
In Cambridge, the City Manager understands that the city council sets policy priorities and they as the
manager are responsible to execute.
In my time as manager I worked with 3 different mayors, and I feel and I think they would as well that we
were a team. Councilors are my bosses. Cambridge is an $800,000 corporation, customer service
corporation. Important to have a skilled and experienced professional to manage that, the city wouldn’t
have the financial strength otherwise. Financial health of the city makes for a strong system. Healy
worked hard to get the city a bond rating and that was a significant first step into building what the city
has now.
The manager works for the council, but not directly for the residents, and I think that’s important. In a
mayor structure a few strong voices can really influence the mayor.
There will always be controversy in cities. But the manager doesn’t need to try to determine what or who
is right or wrong, but to try and get people to come together and compromise on issues. Manager can
make more impartial decisions, and deal with the consequences of the council. There will always be some

small number of loud voices. I tried to always do what was best for the whole city, not necessarily 1 or 2
groups of people.
In situations with Mayors, how did you compare yourself as they were elected and you were appointed?
● Mayors face a lot of similar challenges. I worked closely with Curtatone and Walsh, and we
partnered together a lot. Felt we were on a similar playing field.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
6. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Biggest challenge is when you have to do something that doesn’t agree with the council. For example
during covid the council wanted to mandate vaccines for city staff (council voted 9-0), and after speaking
with the staff I made the decision to not require that. Then Boston required vaccines for restaurant
workers and the council wanted to implement something similar but I couldn’t justify that if I wasn’t
requiring that of my staff. I think this is a healthy dynamic that allows the manager to be the bad guy
sometimes when the council is advocating for something. Can help take some heat off the City Council.
Goal was never to disagree with the mayor or council, but sometimes needed to have courage to say no
you hired me to do this and we need to do x.
● Another example was the initiative for Cambridge to have their own cable tv system - as the city
manager he couldn’t justify it with the investment and no similar systems in other municipalities
that saw success.
As the manager I tried to keep the office as open and transparent as possible. Encouraging public
engagement as much as possible.
7. Some of the items that the Charter can impact are issues such as terms for elected officers,
department head and committee appointment authority, structure of and allocation of
authority in City government, budget process, elections and voting. Do you have any
additional thoughts you would like to share regarding those issues?
At-Large vs Ward Councilors
● I think the at-large council works. There are folks that represent certain areas like Tim Toomey East Cambridge or Thomas Danehy - N. Cambridge. I think having city wide councilors is
important for them to be thinking about what is best for the whole of the city. But I’m not saying
district councilors couldn’t work, just the at-large perspective is important.
Budget Process
● Many ideas about how to get more participation in the budget process.
○ When people are satisfied they aren’t coming to council budget hearings.
○ In the past we set up neighborhood meetings to discuss the direction of the budget and
priorities. No matter the investment we did to get people to show up, at many of those
meetings I had more staff than residents.

Participatory Budgeting first started when he was finance director. Great way to start to get
people involved. Started at $100,000 and now over 1M. Budget office has done a good job, 8,000
residents participated last time.

Do you see any areas that could provide opportunity for resident involvement?
● People in the administration have a lot of experience. Wouldn’t want to see the manager in a
position where they feel like they are making a wrong decision.
● But there are definitely opportunities to increase participation and dialogue around elements in
the city operations.
Appointment of Department Heads
● Manager needs to have the authority for appointing department heads. There should be a role for
residents and councilors, they should be able to voice their opinions and preferences (a good
example is with the police commissioner)
● The role of City Council to share what they are looking for in particular roles (skills,
qualifications, background) and the manager to determine who that individual is.
● Regarding boards and commissions - as manager I always felt I was trying to find quality people
who could do the job well.
○ Should people be paid for these roles, that is an important discussion
Mayor vs Manager
Boards/commission appointments in Mayor systems some might argue is more opportune for
appointments of friends/ political favors. Do you think managers are insulated from that potential
dynamic?
● Not insulated from that as a manager, because it's about the individual person.
Public Accountability / democracy
● Every city manager is appointed by the City Council. When you are appointed, you are going to
want to do a job that makes the council feel like they made the right choice.
● The accountability is to the City Council and you want the public to know what you are doing and
why you are doing it.
● If an individual isn’t following the mandate of council / public input - yes that person should be
removed. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be instances where the manager does not execute or
do something in the way the council wants. If they said no to something they need to explain that.
● There were always situations in Somerville / Boston where residents didn’t feel the mayor was
listening to them, and that's a normal part of any structure.

Anything else you would like us to know ?
The Mayor and Manager need to have a strong working relationship.
The City / School Relationship is strong and unique in Cambridge
Cambridge has a strong council that wants to have more say, which isn’t a bad thing but you need
a line so that the manager has the final say. City council is working hard and they know what
residents want . Any way to increase the relationship, and provide more opportunity for the
council to have a say.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
4th/5th generation in Cambridge.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
Now clerk of Superior courts Middlesex county, 14 years city councilor (chair of the finance committee),
Mayor for 2 terms
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
Relationships generally, and with the administration were really important for productivity. I understood
the different roles, and powers. Everyone had different ways to engage with the administration some
councilors would meet with the manager once a week.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
The challenging part is that some of the other councilors didn’t show up to committee meetings because
there were other community events and such going on - maybe there should be a quorum requirement for
committee meetings
5. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Councilor Composition:
● 4-year term - I'm not sure what it would do. Might lose the connection to the constituents
● Ward/ District: the at-large system required me to outreach to the whole city, and I think that is a
good thing.
● Separately elected mayor? - maybe, not sure the mayor should be the most popular person
running.
○ When I was in the council the election of the mayor was very challenging for the council.
○ The Mayor’s role needs to be collaborative, the best mayors realize it is not about them it
is about working together and providing leadership.
Goal Setting
● When we did have the goal-setting sessions, I couldn’t figure out what we did with them at the
end
● Maybe more necessary if the council is struggling to come together or is having strong
disagreements
Mayor vs Manager
● I don’t think the city should move to a strong mayor system

●

There might be something to say about having one person in the city manager role for 30 years,
maybe there should be consideration around limits on the length of time a city manager can be in
the position

Budget
● Do you think the council should have more power over the budget?
○ Commitments the city makes are farther ahead than 6 months to 1 year, need to be
thinking farther ahead in terms of budgeting.
● Maybe - 2-year budgeting (statutory rules around that?)

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, I grew up in Cambridge.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Manager
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
As a kid I worked in DWP and the Water Department. Intern for City Manager, John Corcoran. Assistant
to Superintendent in the Water Department. City Purchasing Agent (3-4 years). City Manager Bob Healy
appointed me as acting and then permanent deputy city manager (32 years) then city manager for about 40
months.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you to do
your office to do its job well?
Overall I thought and still do that it’s a good system, clear lines of responsibility. City manager
responsible for the administration of the city. The City Council was responsible for policy. Manager was
in charge of implementation of those policies. Then there are different positions that manage checks and
balances like the city clerk and auditor.
General position - Cambridge has a structure that produced a system that was/is really successful. Doesn’t
mean you can’t polish it, and add more effective parts.
● Public buildings/ utilities, leader in affordable housing and climate.
● Strengths from bond rating agencies.
○ Successes because of strong fiscal health: rescuing the Cambridge Hospital, investing in
housing, capital budget process - rebuilt schools, roadways. Climate studies on
vulnerabilities.
● If you had mayors turning over all time, how would that affect employees with regularly
changing leadership?
● I think the manager always tried to be in sync and responsive to the council. Needs to be a more
public process because of the dynamics between individual councilors.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
Budget Process:
● Possible addition: In the end of summer or early fall establish public meetings with manager, key
staff and council, to capture council goals/ admin goals/ budget requests. Currently often the
council is passing goals in January, while the city staff is already ¾ of the way through creating
the budget.
○ A new process would benefit from this new mandate

344

○

Also include a finance presentation on the current financial standing of the city.

Public Engagement
● Challenge for elected officials, staff and the public to have so many public meetings, can be
difficult to know how to participate
● Example: 10 years process for the new library - years of gathering public comments. New people
come and go in the city administration, new residents, new elected officials.
● Recognizes some people/groups felt the public process wasn’t always safe in the traditional
methods, so administration would go talk with certain groups. Found surveys and workshops
created a more welcoming environment
6. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
It’s a process of relationship building, relies on all parties being positive and willing to work together. You
learn to understand your role and how processes work.
○ Example council wanted investment in affordable housing, started with a small amount of
tax revenue to being able to put 10s of million
○ For a long time the city was really worried about big tax increases to certain parts of the
city. Healy did a lot to hold the budget by not expanding jobs in administration, but now
the city has the room to add more roles.
○ Often working with local state officials and councilors on issues, like when uber came in
and cabbies were being affected, they worked to level the playing field requiring uber/lyft
to subscribe to the same rules as local cabbies. Partnering with other communities like
Somerville to encourage state action. Or green line expansion.
○ Looking to experts in other areas for advice, for example a major rodent problem, looked
to NYC experts, and brought their “tsar” to Cambridge to educate the staff.
7. Some of the items that the Charter can impact are issues such as terms for elected officers,
department head and committee appointment authority, structure of and allocation of
authority in City government, budget process, elections and voting. Do you have any
additional thoughts you would like to share regarding those issues?
Free Cash
● The city has more free cash than a lot of other major communities put together, but Cambridge
self insures all our properties that money is the insurance policy
● Some free cash is allocated in the budget to certain departments
As a City manager did you feel in conversations with other cities or orgs at the same level as a mayor?
● Felt is was an equal playing field. Cambridge was a leader on a lot of initiatives like affordable
housing/ environment/ bicycle access. Cambridge was offering the expertise and staff.
What would you think about City council approval over city manager staff?
● Prefers a system where the city manager gets to hire experts. Possible to have a structure where
the council gets to interview candidates for certain roles, but shouldn’t be for everything. If all
boards/commissions and department heads were subject to council approval it would be a huge

345

●
●

time commitment on the council. But doesn’t support denying the manager the ability to appoint
who they want, there is always recourse to terminate the manager if unhappy with administration.
There are certain positions - like housing authority or similar that council has to approve
Maybe a chair of a committee gets a review from the council.

Elections
● Important to ensure appropriate funding for whatever is needed, are computer systems up to date,
do we have the consultant we need?
Ward vs at large city councilors
● I think the city should be represented as a whole, anything that could be done that might make it
more fair/equitable should be implemented. But I don’t know what the actually solution is or have
the information
● Consider how it would impact the current voting system
● Different neighborhoods vary in makeup and needs like north cambridge vs alewife. Should
survey the public on this question.
Cambridge and its financial stability
● How would you stretch cambridge budget muscles that would be allowed within existing laws?
○ Eminent domain of a vacant building, owning the water system, reclaiming Danehy park,
are all examples of opportunities the city had to invest in the community because of its
financial strengths. Continuing to do that work.
8. Anything else you would like us to know ?
More open dialogue when there isn’t a pressing issue. Important for the city to be investing in building
constituencies all the time.
The city has a lot of resources and information like vulnerability study - could benefit from distributing
and educating residents

Charter Review Committee Member 2023-2024
To the City of Cambridge Charter Review Committee
City of Cambridge City Council

The City of Cambridge: Plan E Charter Review
Committee Member Testimonial
1/16/2024
To whom this may regard,
First, my name is Jessica De Jesus Acevedo. I am a proud resident, doctoral candidate, realtor,
and minority small business owner in Cambridge. The city and staff have been nothing less than
support and a resource for myself, the children in my program, and our families. As a young
child, I attended a licensed Family Child Care program in the city ("Alba's Daycare"). As an
undergraduate, I returned to start a childcare business to support more children, families, and
early educators. I commit my effort and time to participate in local governance and engage in
diverse committee memberships with all my communities and institutions. Memberships in
committees and public community engagement are essential to developing our future. And
are constitutional and resident rights.
I want to share final reflections as we conclude our Charter Review and begin to create strategic
plans and changes in 2024 and beyond.
Strategic Systems of Inequalities: Many city meetings and plans discuss and critique how
individuals like myself, who are "of color" or a "student," do not participate or engage with our
local government or city council. Too often, in public meetings and spaces, we continue to retract
from the facts of the more extensive matter.
"If it ain't broke, Don't fix it." Mindset & Model: Historically, laws, systems, and practices
have been created to limit diverse individuals not only because of the color of their skin but
also/their age, gender, education, religion, disabilities, socioeconomic status, and familial
structure but also to uphold the affluence and power of the individuals who govern. Too often,
our government needs to make decisions with more input on the more significant impacts of the
community or the specific populations who are, without intent, negatively impacted. Within our
current structure, there needs to be more commitment to consistently engaging and promoting
public participation and feedback in a city-wide and responsive manner. The city continues
outsourcing through nonprofits and hiring consultants to provide community feedback rather
than City Managers and council members, making it a priority and a job requirement to regularly

a

Packet Pg. 395

attend local events and meetings and encourage public participation consistently, not only during
times of election or as individuals are rushed for 2 minutes during public comments.
Current Governance: The current structure and governance have and will continue gentrification
in Cambridge. Again, gentrification is "the process whereby the character of a poor urban area
is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses,
typically displacing current inhabitants in the process." As a small business owner and resident,
living costs and operating within the city are almost inconceivable. As our affluent community
and corporations thrive, we have residents, students, and small business owners who cannot
attain or afford food, shelter, housing, and education/childcare. Yet, citizens request more
affordable housing and rental control with no response from elective officials on our everyday
issues. However, most City Council members have been homeowners and/or landlords, making
changes of this nature of a potential conflict of interest.
City of Capitalism: The current government's structure and zoning boards have allowed and
continue to approve developments that have and will continue to change the essence of the
Cambridge neighborhood and culture. Yet, we have residents who need shelter and cannot own
property in communities where their families come from or have started. The gap between
sheltering all individuals is based on dollars rather than resources.
The City of Cambridge reports that the Community Development Department's Housing
Division oversees over 700 affordable rental units throughout the city through its Inclusionary
Housing Program. Rather than creating a city of equal opportunity to live and work, we
continue to put public responsibility on social organizations and away from the public
agencies and officials that govern.
Housing: The city reports that the median prices are based on advertised prices for apartments.
Data excludes affordable and graduate student housing owned by the universities, privatizing the
costs of rent and purchase by large institutions and organizations, not the actual financial
attainability within the community or even the real estate market.
In 2010, the City of Cambridge reported that the median of a single-family was $760,000
compared to 2020 sales of $1,724,000, which is well over a 126% increase within the last ten
years with no expectations of decreasing or becoming more accessible for the people of the city
which will continue to harbor a community of short-term renters and residents unable to
purchase land which will require more public funds and resources at the local and state level.
(Source: Housing Data - CDD - City of Cambridge, Massachusetts (cambridgema.gov) )
Some of our current residents cannot access, purchase, or acquire real estate in the city, which is
illegal. Our state and federal regulations are to uphold and reinforce the following:

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 396

The Fair Housing Law: Discrimination in housing is against the law. State and federal
law prohibit discrimination in the sale and rental of housing by property owners,
landlords, property managers, mortgage lenders, and real estate agents. These fair
housing laws make it unlawful to discriminate based on race, color, national origin,
gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ancestry, genetic information,
marital status, veteran or active military status, age, familial status (i.e., children), and
source of income (i.e., Section 8 voucher). (Source: Fair Housing Law | Mass.gov)
The City of Cambridge must also uphold and dismantle all unlawful policies or practices by law.
Legislation: Our future government and city require elevated representation in Massachusetts
legislation for reform and advancement. The officials who residents vote for have the power and
funding to protect our community through policies geared toward the city's partnerships with
citizens, city officials, schools, small/large businesses, and local policymakers. A robust system
requires policymakers and legislators to advocate for and protect the rights of the people and
enhance the community.
The City of Cambridge has just conducted a Disparity Study (2023) described as a “first” of its
kind. It is unacceptable for the level of funds geared towards developing the city's economic
infrastructure not to conduct research of this nature. According to a recent survey commissioned
by the city of Cambridge, the allocation of funds towards minority- or women-owned businesses
from July 2016 to June 2021 amounted to just over 1% of the total expenditure. This finding
sheds light on the current lack of economic inclusivity within the city and raises essential
questions about the equitable distribution of resources and funds.
The report highlights the ineffectiveness of the city's race- and gender-neutral efforts in
addressing the disparities identified in contracting opportunities. The study reveals the exclusion
of Black-, Hispanic-, and women-owned businesses across various sectors. It sheds light on an
informal network of businesses with privileged access to contracting opportunities within the
city. This closed circle of businesses further perpetuates the exclusion of minority- and
women-owned businesses. While there is some recognition of Hispanic-owned firms in
professional services, the findings emphasize the need for more comprehensive and equitable
policies to ensure fair contracting opportunities for all underrepresented groups.
(Source: Cambridge Disparity Study_Full Report_Released Dec 21, 2023 - DocumentCloud)
The City Council structure has refrained from changes, turnovers, and conducting studies to
uphold the committee's power and for the profit of private organizations. Our city falsely
advertises the new diversity and representation among the city council members, but historically,
that has not been the case. Changes are made through reforms and new laws by diverse leaders,
thinkers, educators, and policymakers, including BPOC and individuals with disabilities. It
should not be limited to an unstudied "If it ain't broke, Don't fix it" mindset and model as

proposed by Mayor Simmons and others during testimonials to the Charter Review Committee.
In illustration, Denise Simmons was Massachusetts's first openly black lesbian female mayor in
2008 and the first black female mayor in Massachusetts. Mayor Simmons has been a leader and
advocate for change in the City of Cambridge since 2002, and she is currently serving her 12th
term. However, one primary person of color or diverse background does not represent
thousands or a fair democratic government structure. The City of Cambridge, Massachusetts
Disparity Study (2023) recommended the following:
RECOMMENDATION 8: DATA REFORM GSPC encountered several challenges in
collecting data for this Study. The City recommends implementing the following data
reforms to track and monitor the other program recommendations properly:
• Vendor System/ File: Include ethnicity, gender, and other certifications.
Currently, the vendor system does not track ethnicity, only certification (MBE or
WBE).
• Bid Tabs: Create a database for bid tabs readily available to the City. This will
allow bid tabs to be extracted promptly and provide columns such as bid number,
date append, date closed, vendor info, and project details. This would also
consolidate multiple Excel or PDF files currently hosting this information.
Without question, as a millennial Hispanic resident and small business owner, I view our city as
using political practices, public funds, and people to uphold oppressive policies.
Leading the future into 2044: As I continue to celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King
Jr., I reflect on the progress and changes that have been made to ensure fairness, equal
opportunity, and safety for all. Yet, as a BPOC resident, I also sit in meetings, like the Charter
Review, where affluent residents and stakeholders continue to use the same narrative when
describing individuals within the city, primarily BPOC, not present in the meeting, often
described as "unengaged" or "not caring," which is unprofessional, unempathetic, and
undermines all the hard-working students, parents, and families of our city, black or white. It also
allows individual officials to strategically make changes, decisions, and investments without the
full scope of voices or perspectives of particularly low-income and working residents. This
violates our First Amendment right for these individuals to use their freedom of speech during
public meetings.
I acknowledge that public meetings must be announced and advertised by state laws, yet not all
residents receive notification or attend. Public announcements via emails or electronic
methods do not ensure that all public members are informed or notified of the meeting or
its relevance, especially individuals who may not have internet technology or subscribe to
the city newsletter or website. Therefore, new policymakers could significantly amend our
current structures, such as possible law violations in public meetings, change the nonexistent
engagement, increase voting, and embed communication with diverse residents and students in
Cambridge. In sum, the City of Cambridge requires change and reform based on hours of Charter

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 398

Review discussion, presentations, review, and professional/personal reflection. Our current
structure needs more diverse and adequate representation with the limitation of a policymaking
branch or legislator.
A Mayor-CFO form of government allows individuals to vote for their policymaker(s),
empowers diverse representation and leadership, and, more importantly, allows for real-time
changes in public policies that negatively impact citizens, including education, housing, safety,
and employment. The City of Cambridge must uphold equal opportunity for residents and
(undocumented) residents to work, live, and thrive.
The City of Cambridge has become a global hub for large organizations, higher education,
high-end real estate, and home to changemakers from past and future generations. We open our
doors to the borders, support social movements, and advocate for human beings near and far. We
have often led historical changes in education, technology, laws, practices, and humanitarian
efforts. Old Cambridge will never look the same, nor will the people or the community. The City
of Cambridge requires new leadership and changes that honor and uphold our city's
essence and hear the people's cries, not in times of shootings or emergencies, but now.
I would like to formally thank the City of Cambridge, the City Council, the Mayor, the City
Manager, UMASS Collins Center for Public Management, the City Clerk, and the Charter
Review committee members and city staff for their time, participation, and support through the
review of Plan E. All members of the public, especially the individuals who took time to provide
us feedback online or in person through this committee appointment.
Thank you for taking the time to read my testimonial and considerations.
Sincerely,
Jessica De Jesus Acevedo
Charter Review Committee Member (2023-2024)

To Mayor Simmons, Vice-Mayor McGovern, and the Honorable City Council:

1.

It is my privilege to submit the final report of the Cambridge Charter Review Committee to the
Cambridge City Council.
The Charter Review Committee convened thirty-six times in open meetings between August 2022 and
January 2024 for the purpose of considering changes to the Cambridge City Charter.

FT

Regarding the most fundamental aspect of the Charter, whether to amend Cambridge's existing form of
government or propose a different form of government, the Committee was not able to come to an
agreement of two-thirds of its members, as required by the ordinance that established the Committee.

R

A

The Committee did, however, reach two-thirds agreement regarding certain aspects of government
common to both the Council/Manager and Mayor/CAFO/Council forms of government. The Committee’s
areas of agreement included a codified goal-setting process for city council, expanding voter eligibility
regarding age and citizenship, moving local elections to align with state and national elections, refining
Proportional Representation to reflect modern tabulation methods, and, of particular note, the innovative
addition to government structure of a randomly selected Resident Assembly that would be tasked with
consideration of Cambridge’s most controversial issues.

D

The Committee agreed that city councillors should continue to be elected city-wide to two year terms
through a system of Proportional Representation and that a Strong Mayor (if that system prevailed) should
be elected through RCV (Ranked Choice Voting with STV (Single Transferable Vote) tabulation to a four
year term.
The Committee recommended several additional forms of resident involvement, such as recall of the
Mayor (under the Strong Mayor system) and Resident Initiative Petitions to bring matters before the
Council or directly to the voters.
Finally, the Committee identified a number of items for consideration in future Charter Review
Committees.

It is not the responsibility of the Chair to analyze the patterns, the reasons or the circumstances around the
divergence of opinion on the Charter Committee. However, I would like to offer my personal observation,
derived from the public input we received in various formats, that the residents of Cambridge, like the
members of the Charter Review Committee, are of mixed opinions about whether Cambridge should
retain (with some revisions) its current Council/Manager system of government or switch to a
Mayor/CAFO/Council system.

1.

17

In other words, I believe that the opinions of our diverse Committee are a general reflection of the
division of popular opinion in the citizenry that has participated in our meetings and other resident
engagement activities…with the important caveat that it appears that, at this point in time, despite our
outreach, which included a mailing to every household in Cambridge, a City of Cambridge webpage
devoted to Charter Review, more than thirty public meetings virtual and in-person, and social media
efforts, most Cambridge residents are not engaged in, or even aware of, the issue of Charter Reform. Most
are unaware that a re-structuring of the government is even being contemplated. When the City Council
takes up the issue in 2024 and when, eventually, the issue is about to be put to the voters, hopefully there
will be robust discussion and debate among a broader set of Cambridge residents.
Yours sincerely,

FT

Introduction
To:
Cambridge City Council
From: The Cambridge Charter Review Committee
Date: January __, 2024
The Cambridge Charter Review Committee is pleased to present our final recommendations regarding
revisions or replacements to the Cambridge City Charter. These include the proposed new modernized
charter text. This report, which we endorse, is a reflection of our deliberations.

17

The city's charter is the foundation of Cambridge city government, outlining the structure, powers, and
responsibilities of our government and its elected officials. Early in our deliberations, we voted
unanimously to draft a new city charter, moving beyond the Plan E form and outdated gender-biased
language, to modernize and clarify our city's governing document.

A
FT

1.

The final report results from 18 months of Committee meetings, deliberations, interviews, community
engagement, and public comment. The Committee held 36 public Committee meetings, heard over 250
written and verbal public comments, attended community meetings, hosted four public forums,
interviewed former and current elected officials and staff, and dedicated numerous hours of hard work and
consideration.
Below is an overview of each section of the final report

Form of Government Statements and Related Recommendations
As previously stated, the Committee did not come to a formal, super-majority recommendation on the
question of form of government. This section, however, provides two statements, one from the eight
Committee members supporting the Mayor/CAFO/Council form of government and one from the seven
Committee members supporting the Council/Manager form of government. The section also includes
details of votes related solely to either of those respective forms of government.

Charter Text Mayor/CAFO/Council & Charter Text Manager/Council
This section provides proposed draft charter text for each form of government, Council/Manager and
Mayor/CAFO/Council. Because Cambridge had a plan form charter (dating back to early 1900), the
Committee knew it was necessary, in addition to highlighting the Committee's recommendations, to
include the recommendations in the context of a modern charter format and text. These draft texts include
some boilerplate text that provides context for the framing and substantive decisions set within a modern
charter text. Highlighted are the sections that reflect Committee votes

Items for Future Charter Review Committee Consideration
Because this charter review was the first review since the adoption of the charter in 1940, and because the
complete scope of topics covered by a modern charter was greater than the Committee's capacity and time
allotted, there were some topics for voting systems and campaign finance, that could not receive the full
attention and expert consultation that is merited. While the Committee addressed many relevant charter
topics, it has identified several important issues that the next charter review Committee could take up.

Proposed Modern Charter Overview

17

Cambridge’s current “Plan E” charter (see Appendix H) was written by the Massachusetts General Court
(Massachusetts state legislature) in the first half of the twentieth century as one of the charter templates
offered to Massachusetts cities. Now, after roughly 100 years, there are only 12 of these “Plan” charters
left operating in Massachusetts (and only one other “Plan E” charter). Cambridge’s Plan E charter consists
of seven pages of Massachusetts general law text. It lacks an accessible format and substance to properly
inform the public of Cambridge’s government structure and operations. As a document that is supposed to
be the foundation of our government, it does not meet the moment. For that reason, the first decision as a
Committee was to recognize that, independent of how members felt about what should replace it, the
current charter text no longer works for Cambridge in 2024. A modern form and structured charter would
better serve Cambridge’s government and residents.

Key Recommendations for New Charter
The following proposed changes to the Cambridge City Charter are a result of extensive deliberation,
comparative research, community engagement, insights from current and previous Cambridge elected
officials, background from city employees, best practices across Massachusetts, and innovative structures
in the U.S. and internationally, as well as experiences of individual Committee members. In addition, the
Committee decided to focus on a set of values to frame its deliberations.

17

Equity and Enfranchisement: Prioritizing fairness and inclusion ensures that all community
members can fully participate in and with their city government.
Participation in and Accessibility of Government: Focusing on enhancing citizen engagement
and making government processes more accessible and understandable to the diverse population
of Cambridge.

1.

Government Effectiveness: Striving for efficiency and efficacy in the functioning of government
institutions to better serve the community's needs.

A
FT

Responsiveness and Accountability: Build a structure promoting responsiveness and
accountability, ensuring that the government remains attentive and answerable to the needs and
concerns of its residents.

D

R

The following recommendations have at least two-thirds of the Committee’s support, demonstrating a
solid consensus among Committee members and meeting the requirements outlined in the ordinance
(Appendix B). These changes are recommended separately from the form of government. These
recommendations are not arbitrary but result from thoughtful Committee deliberations.

Expand Enfranchisement and Equity
The Committee examined elections and representation in Cambridge and sought paths to foster more
inclusive and equitable city elections, and increase voter engagement in city elections. The Committee's
recommendations aim to empower marginalized voices, increase election participation, and preserve the
unique strengths of Cambridge's election method and composition of elected bodies.

17

1. Maintain an At-Large city council elected by Proportional Representation. The Committee
engaged in deliberations regarding the composition and election method of the City Council.
Emphasis was placed on the strengths inherent in Cambridge's distinctive at-large, proportionally
representative model.

1.

During the discussion, the Committee considered the potential benefits of district representation,
acknowledging the community's expressed desire for more direct communication paths and
accountability. After careful consideration, the Committee concluded that alternative solutions
outside the city charter, such as neighborhood liaisons, could effectively address the identified need
for accountability. Two-thirds of the Committee voted to uphold the existing at-large, proportionally
representative model for the City Council. (See Section 2-1(a))

A
FT

Community Feedback: The Committee heard numerous comments from residents regarding their
preference for and against the at-large proportional representation model. Some residents and a few
former elected officials expressed a desire for district-based councillors, emphasizing the
advantages of clear communication channels and geographic accountability. Advocates for district
representatives argued that it would foster closer connections between elected officials and their
specific constituencies. The Committee also received significant feedback supporting the all-at-large
system. Those favoring the current system highlighted its benefits for city-wide groups whose
interests and causes transcend geographic boundaries.

R

Votes
A motion for the Committee to recommend Cambridge maintain a Proportional
Representation system in Cambridge elections.
Yes – 13, No – 0, Absent – 2

D

A motion for the Committee to recommend Cambridge maintain an at-large city council of nine
members.
Yes – 11, No – 1, Present - 1, Absent – 0

2. Enfranchise non-citizens in municipal elections. The Committee engaged in discussions
regarding the enfranchisement of non-citizens, allowing them to both vote and run for municipal
elections. The Committee recognized the significance of this proposal in fostering inclusivity and
civic participation amoung all the residents of Cambridge. Many other municipalities in
Massachusetts have submitted home rule petitions to the State Legislature seeking to enfranchise
non-citizens in local elections, including Cambridge. (See Sections 2-1(a & c) & 4-1(a & c) & 7-2)

voting habits, and some Committee members emphasized the benefits of civic engagement and the
potential for enhanced political awareness among individuals at this age. The Committee also

tactics to increase voter turnout and engagement in local elections. As documented from cities in
CA, TX, and MD, turnout often doubles by aligning local elections with higher-profile election
years (even-year cycles), such as those for state and federal offices. In the most recent even-year
elections, Cambridge saw a 75% turnout in 2020 and 52% in 2022. (See Section 7-1)

5. Create more flexibility and modernize election voting and tabulation methods in charter
language. The Committee acknowledged the necessity to modernize and refine the election
language in the Charter, recognizing that Cambridge's current reliance on an antiquated state statute
with specific and outdated limitations hinders the city's electoral processes. The existing statute
permits proportional representation but imposes constraints, for instance, on tabulation methods,
that no longer align with the dynamic and evolving needs of the community. In light of this, the
Committee recommends that the City Council and election commission collaborate to update the
language and create more flexibility.(See Sections 7-4 & 7-5)

Participation in and Accessibility of Government for all Residents
The Committee prioritized enhancing participation and accessibility of the city government for all
residents. Hearing from the Cambridge community, the residents were eager for more accessible methods
of engaging with their elected officials and city employees and creating city priorities. Seeking
opportunities to cultivate a more inclusive and equitable civic engagement experience, the Committee
prioritized adding opportunities for thoughtful public feedback in multiple areas of the charter, expanding
requirements around tracking and publishing council actions, and developing a framework for a Resident
Assembly (representative lottery selected panel) to tackle critical city topics.

1.

17

1. Require a Resident Assembly in the Charter. A Resident Assembly is a lottery-selected panel
and a democratic system designed to address challenging policy issues governments face.
Panelists, drawn from the general population, are tasked with a critical question or city issue and
are supported with stakeholder engagement and education. The assembly deliberates,
collaborates, and makes specific recommendations for the city. The Committee envisions that the
Resident Assembly will bring new voices into city government and generate community-driven
concepts and solutions. (See Section 8-4)

A
FT

Should Cambridge adopt this Resident Assembly proposal, Cambridge would be the first
municipality in the United States to codify such a structure in a city charter. The Committee spent
extensive time discussing the intention, structure, and goals for a Resident Assembly in
Cambridge. The Committee recommended that the City Council convene at least one assembly
per term, offer adequate compensation to the panelists, and identify specific powers or decisions
that the assembly could be tasked with. The Committee acknowledged that this would be a brand
new civic structure in Cambridge and that specifics regarding the selection process, operational
requirements, and best practices will evolve and require additional definition.

R

Community Feedback: Early on, the committee had heard from the public an interest in more
collaborative city government and a desire for increased opportunities for engagement. In the
development and deliberations of establishing a resident assembly, the Committee received
positive feedback from the community and several city councillors.

Effectiveness of Government
The Committee’s recommendations aim to build on Cambridge's current strengths as a regional leader
while introducing measures for a more effective government. To address community concerns, the
recommendations focus on establishing a clear process for strategic vision planning that anticipates future
challenges.

17

1. Measurable goal-setting. The Committee emphasized the need for measurable goal-setting to
establish a clear vision and a strategic plan for the city. Recognizing the absence of a clearly
defined and comprehensive strategic vision, Committee members, as well as former elected
officials and members of the public, expressed concerns about the prevalence of numerous
council orders unrelated to any previously identified priorities. The Committee acknowledged the
necessity of creating a structured vision for the city to guide elected officials in their
decision-making processes.

A
FT

1.

The proposed approach involves the implementation of measurable goal-setting once a term
during the first half of the first year of the city council's term. This strategic planning session a
crucial opportunity to frame priorities for the budget, providing a roadmap for the remainder of
the term. The Committee also recognized the importance of community involvement in this
process, providing an opportunity for residents to contribute feedback and share their priorities
for the city. (See Sections 2-3(b)(iv), 2-11 & 3-1(f)).
Community Feedback
Community feedback highlighted the perceived unstructured nature of council measures, and
pressed the need to organize council priorities into overarching goals for the city. Many residents
expressed frustration with the perceived lack of defined goals within the City Council,
emphasizing the need for a more structured and strategic approach as well for a better-defined
collective political vision.

2. Maintain 2-year terms for city councillors. The Committee extensively deliberated on the term
length for city councillors, ultimately recommending maintaining 2-year terms. The committee
thoroughly discussed the benefits of maintaining this term length, emphasizing its capacity to
hold councillors directly accountable to voters biennially. Almost all Massachusetts
municipalities with a population over 50,000 have 2-year terms for city councillors. The
Committee determined this term length was appropriate for Cambridge, ensuring more frequent
opportunities for voters to express their preferences and align the city's leadership with evolving
community dynamics. (See Section 2-1(b))

14

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 415

In a related decision, the Committee chose not to pursue a recall provision for city councillors.
The rationale behind this decision was anchored in the acknowledgment that the 2-year term
serves as a mechanism for accountability. The frequency of elections under the 2-year term
eliminates the need for a recall provision, as voters can express their approval or disapproval in
elections. It makes a recall provision operationally difficult, given the short time window.

1.

17

Community Feedback
Community feedback on the topic of maintaining 2-year terms for city councillors was somewhat
mixed. Supporters of the 2-year term emphasized its role in keeping elected officials directly and
frequently accountable to the voters. They highlighted the opportunity it provides for new
individuals to enter city council positions. Other community members expressed support for
longer terms, citing the need to give councillors more time to adjust and advance legislative
agendas between campaign seasons. Concerns were raised that longer terms might discourage
potential candidates from running due to the extended commitment required.

Responsiveness and Accountability
In relation to the Committee’s value of Responsiveness and Accountability, the Committee has
proactively endorsed a series of recommendations to strengthen accountability to residents. The proposed
inclusion of a defined timeline for the budget process, coupled with establishing a formalized annual
budget meeting and a process for city council budget priorities in the fall, seeks to enhance budget
transparency and strategic planning. Additionally, the Committee recommends a significant change to the
budgetary framework, granting the City Council the authority to add or increase line items.

17

To bolster resident engagement, two provisions new to Cambridge—the Resident Initiative Petition and
Group Petition—are recommended. The former allows residents to bring forth new legislation, while the
latter enables residents to prompt a city council hearing on a specific topic.

1.

Finally, the Committee recommends forming a Campaign Finance Study Committee, dedicated to
exploring avenues for implementing new programs or funding regulations.

A
FT

1. Defined budget process + City Council Budget Priorities. Currently, Cambridge's budget
process and timeline are defined by Massachusetts General Law, which requires the budget to be
submitted 170 days from the beginning of the year (~June 20) and allows the City Council 45
days to approve said budget. The Committee discussed comprehensively the budget process and
options to formally empower Cambridge's City Council with more substantial input early in the
budget process. Increasing collaborations between the executive and the City Council on the
development of the budget was a critical deliberation point for the Committee.

R

Recognizing the importance of early and defined input from elected officials, the Committee
proposed additions to the budget process. These additions include introducing a codified annual
budget meeting, delineating a straightforward process for the City Council to identify and
communicate its budget priorities, and incorporating additional public input opportunities in the
fall. These proposed steps aim to foster transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration in the city's
budgetary decision-making process. (See Sections 6-2 - 6-6)

D

Proposed Timeline
➔ Fiscal Year: begin on July 1 and end on June 30 (current practice by Massachusetts
General Law)
➔ Annual Budget Meeting: At least by Nov 1
➔ City Council Budget Priorities: by end of Calendar year (following annual budget
meeting)
➔ Submission of Budget: At least by May 1
◆ Including the Capital Improvement Plan (same timeline)

2. City Council Power to Add or Increase Line Items in the Budget. The Committee had several
primary goals in their deliberations on potential changes to the budget process: increased
transparency, increased public engagement, and increased the City Council's role in creating the
budget. Looking at Boston's recent charter change, which allows the City Council to add or
increase line items in addition to the current state law that only allows the City Council to reduce
or eliminate budget line items, the Committee voted to recommend under either form of
government the City Council be allowed to increase or add items to the budget. This is in addition
to a formalized process for the City Council to establish and share the budget priorities for the
upcoming budget with the chief executive.. (See Section 6-5(b))

3. Enshrine Resident Initiative Provision. The Committee, in its commitment to enhancing public
engagement and participation in Cambridge city government, engaged in thorough deliberations
on the introduction of a Resident Initiative Petition provision to the city charter. Currently lacking
formal participation mechanisms, this provision would empower residents to initiate change by
collecting signatures to petition the City Council to pass a specific ordinance. If the ordinance
fails to secure approval from the City Council, the provision outlines additional steps for
residents. They may collect further signatures to place the proposed ordinance on the ballot for
Cambridge voters to decide its implementation. (See Section 8-6).

4. Enshrine Group Petition Provision. The Committee, attuned to the community's call for
increased paths for direct community participation, thoroughly considered the proposal to
enshrine a Group Petition Provision in the city's charter. This provision would empower a group
of residents to collect signatures on a specific issue, compelling the City Council to hold a public
hearing on the matter. Recognizing the importance of fostering mechanisms that amplify
residents' voices, the Committee prioritized direct resident engagement. The Committee
expressed a shared conviction in the value of establishing a democratic process that allows
residents to actively contribute to shaping the city's discourse. The Committee acknowledged and
agreed with the community's desire for increased avenues of participation and its commitment to
fostering a more inclusive decision-making framework.

A
FT

Similar to the resident initiative petition process, the City Council is expected to collaborate with
the Election Commission to determine the specific thresholds for signature collection, ensuring
that they are reasonable and attainable. This collaborative effort is essential to fine-tune the
implementation of the Group Petition Provision, ensuring its effectiveness in providing a
meaningful platform for residents to engage with civic matters and have their voices heard. (See
Section 8-5).

5. Campaign Finance Study Committee. The Committee deliberated extensively on ways to
alleviate the financial burdens associated with campaigning in Cambridge while fostering greater
diversity among candidates. Recognizing the absence of public financing options in
Massachusetts, as constrained by state regulations, the Committee identified the need for a
dedicated study Committee. This study Committee aims to explore potential programs for
Cambridge, such as a voucher program, contribution limits, and campaign spending programs,
with the overarching goal of fostering more inclusive and accessible elections within the city.
The Committee acknowledged the limitations imposed by state regulations on elections and
campaign finance reform. In response, a strategic recommendation emerged to amend the city's
charter. This proposed addition would empower the City Council, the election commission, or

Strong Mayor / CAFO / Council Statement with Related Votes
In support of a “Strong Mayor/CAFO” form of City governance

17

Eight out of fifteen members of the Cambridge Charter Review Committee, after extensive research,
discussion and ample opportunity for public comment, support a move to a “Strong Mayor” form of
government along with the development of a new position of Chief Administrative and Financial Officer
(CAFO) to oversee day to day administration of the City. While we cannot relay all that has been
discussed on this topic, we wish to convey the key reasons why eight members of the Charter Review
Committee have come to this conclusion:

A
FT

1.

1) Enhancing democracy: Democracy is the best form of government for ensuring that all residents
of Cambridge can actively participate as equals in the project of self-governance. While it is
critical that we seek to engage residents in City government in a myriad of ways, it is through the
act of voting that the greatest number of residents, including those from historically marginalized
communities, express their political choices and opinions. In our current form of government,
many voters are unaware that they do not choose the person that manages the City and its budget.
The representatives elected by the voters have only overbroad and seldom-used tools to ensure
that the actions of the City Manager reflect the will of the people. By contrast, the democratic
methods for holding an elected Mayor accountable are well known, powerful and accessible to
all. While we understand that some residents and members of the Committee believe that the
administration of the City should be “depoliticized”, we think that the “depoliticization” of city
governance ultimately means there is less ability for residents of all types to have real impact on
important City decisions.

D

R

2) History of City Manager form of government to disenfranchise voters of color: The
Committee has explored research showing a strong positive correlation between cities that
received many Black people during the Great Migration of the twentieth century and cities that
adopted a city manager form of government during the same period. The explanation of this
correlation reveals that many Progressive Era supporters of city anager governments intended to
make local government as inaccessible as possible for new immigrants and people of color. While
such reasons do not appear to have directly applied to Cambridge where the effort was mainly
directed against perceived corruption, and while we do not believe that this goal is today the
reason that other members of the Charter Review Committee support a city manager form of
government, this history provides useful lessons about how broad democracy is limited when
there are no elections for the Chief executive.
3) Influence on the City budget: Perhaps the greatest power of the City Government is the
development of a city budget which ultimately is an expression of the values and priorities of the
City. At present there is no mechanism for residents to have a direct impact on budget choices.
Under the current charter arrangement, the City Council can only reduce budget expenditures but
cannot allocate or reallocate budget items. While there may be indirect ability to impact on the

20

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 421

budget process through the ability of the City Council to hire and fire a city manager, we see a
strong Mayor system as allowing for a far more effective means for residents to express their
pleasure or displeasure with the budgets as developed by the Executive branch through the Act of
voting.

1.

17

4) Combining a Chief Financial/Administrative Officer with a Strong Mayor provides the best
of both worlds: It is critical for Cambridge to have a person in charge of administration that is a
highly skilled administrator with the background and expertise necessary to solve complex
problems and make difficult choices. We acknowledge that the qualities that make a candidate the
best candidate for Mayor are not necessarily the same qualities that make for high quality
municipal administration. For this reason, we believe the City Charter should require the City to
hire a Chief Financial and Administrative Officer with similar qualifications and responsibilities
as a City Manager. The change to the Charter we propose-a change we consider critical-is that
this new Officer should be answerable to an elected Mayor.

A
FT

5) Direct accountability to residents: Elected Mayors have a strong incentive to be responsive to
their constituency as they must win sufficient votes to remain in office. This incentive demands
that successful Mayors make themselves available to residents and change their decisions in
response to resident pressure. A move to an elected Mayor would also provide much needed
clarity to residents who currently express confusion about how and where to seek redress, make
policy suggestions or otherwise impact on government decisions.

R

6) Possibility for a bolder agenda: Direct accountability to the voters will in some instances allow
for a bolder executive branch than exists with a city manager form of government. Unrelated to
any particular city manager, a city manager may have some implicit incentive to perpetuate the
status quo and not to urge bold action on the part of the City and its many division heads who
implement policy. This may be particularly true in a city like Cambridge with enviable sources of
income, a low tax rate and AAA bond rating. We note, perhaps tangentially in this context, that
our current financial security and bond rating is not merely the product of a city manager; many
of our neighbors, including Boston and Somerville, have the same high bond rating along with
elected Mayors.

D

We believe that the current power, income, and wealth gap between residents, often correlated to
race, means that while many are thriving in the City of Cambridge, others are struggling just to
remain in this City, never mind thrive. People with this or other relevant life experience may
demand, through the act of voting and otherwise, bolder action than we have seen to date in
regard to anti-displacement, climate justice, public transportation, or the like. The debate over
how bold to be and what risks to take is critical; but true debate is most meaningful when people
truly have the power to determine the debate’s outcome – in this case through the power of the
vote.

7) Leadership in External and Regional Efforts and Policymaking: Increasingly we face
challenges like climate and housing which one municipality cannot solve. An elected Mayor

21

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 422

would have an expanded ability to represent our community, foster regional collaboration and
provide visionary leadership on these and other critical issues.

17

8) How adoption of a strong Mayor/CAFO form of government would relate to other
recommendations of the Charter Review Committee: The Charter Review Committee as a
whole (“the Committee”) recognizes the influence that money can play in the ability of diverse
candidates to successfully run for office. For this reason, the Committee is recommending that the
City Council undertake a review of the possibility of implementing some form of public financing
for elections. The Committee is also recommending additional means of enhancing direct
democracy such as the formation of a Resident Council, requesting permission from the state to
allow non-citizens and residents sixteen (16) and older to vote, and moving elections to even
years to increase voter turnout. Mayoral elections will need to be combined with other strategies
to truly enfranchise and empower a wider range of residents to engage actively in city
government.

1.

For these reasons and others each of us personally hold we favor a move to a strong Mayor/CAFO form
of government.

Reasons to prefer a City Council/City Manager form of government for Cambridge
The citizens of Cambridge have benefitted from steady, professional leadership in the position of the city
manager for decades and there are numerous strong reasons to maintain our City Council/City Manager
(Council/Manager) form of government.

Satisfaction of Residents:
Citizen surveys over the past 20 years reflect a high level of satisfaction with Cambridge’s form of
governance, as did a significant number of the comments to the Charter Review Committee at its
December 5 meeting. This is unsurprising. The city offers a high level of services, the lowest residential
tax rate among surrounding communities, and the highest possible bond rating (which enables the city to
undertake capital improvements such as schools and parks at lower costs). Further, external stakeholders
can turn to a stable professional representative of the city with whom to partner rather than a politician
with a limited term of office. Certainly, some citizens wish certain things were different in our city. The
question for this report is whether changing the form of government would make a difference in those
matters.

A
FT

Separation of policy-making from policy-implementation.
The primary reason to maintain the Council/ Manager form of government is the separation of
policy-making from policy-execution. Policy-making should always be the responsibility of an elected
body broadly representative of the city -- the City Council. Our system of Proportional Representation
and at-large seats has, for decades, produced a richly diverse Council, currently almost precisely
representative of the demographics of our population. However, policy implementation is different by
nature. It is a highly professional, and often very technical operation, best led by a well-trained senior
executive who must oversee thousands of staff, an annual budget of nearly $1 Billion, and a labyrinth of
federal, state and local regulations.

R

Popularly elected officials should decide what we should do as a city; well-trained professionals should
decide how we do it most effectively.

D

The Council/ Manager form of government allows the broadly representative legislative body to choose
and oversee such a professional who works at their direction. Since it takes at least five city councillors
(with disparate constituencies) to vote to select a city manager, we are assured that the chief executive of
the city will need to serve a wide range of our citizens with different needs and priorities.
Further, by separating the executive from the political process, the city manager can make important and
even controversial decisions, such as hiring department heads and making contract decisions, without
undue political pressure. Nor need the city manager spend time and/or political capital raising money,
attending campaign events or seeking endorsements and financial contributions from people who may
then feel they then have a right to influence the city manager’s decisions on civic matters. The Manager
can also lean on the experience of other city and town managers who are his professional peers for

expertise in urban problem solving. Further, when the council is split on an issue, the Manager can offer a
politically neutral party that can help fashion collaborative solutions addressing various factions’
concerns.
Stability of government
The city manager’s status as a professional employee of the city council allows for continuity in
government. The manager can remain in office through multiple council elections as long as the new
council approves of their performance.

Accountability
Changes to the relationship between the Council and the City Manager have been codified and
strengthened by recommendations detailed elsewhere in this report. Joint public goal-setting between the
Council and the Manager and a regular, thoughtful Manager evaluation process (as set out in our draft
sample Council/Manager Charter) by the Council are important elements in increasing accountability and
transparency in our government. The former is difficult and the latter does not exist in the case of an
elected mayor. The addition of Resident Assemblies brings another force into the governance of the city
and will ensure that more citizens are engaged and informed.

R

A
FT

Direct Oversight by the City Council
In some versions of the mayor form of government, the mayor is authorized to hire a CAFO (Chief
Administrative and Financial Officer) to administer the city while the elected mayor handles political
chores and policy making. This would bring the somewhat professional expertise of a manager-type to the
city. But, this approach consolidates power in the hands of two people (one not elected) at the expense of
the more broadly representative council. And the CAFO reports only to the Mayor, not to the Council.
Hence, the administration of city government is one step further removed from the Council and the voters
than the current City Manager is. Mayor/CAFO conversations are typically in private and not subject to
the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law. In the council/ manager form, the chief executive works for the
entire council and must respond to this broadly diverse body in open, public discussion. Policy debates
take place among our elected councillors, and the City Manager is charged with implementing the policies
that emerge.

D

Removal of the Chief Executive
While this report includes a Recall Provision for removing the mayor, it is undeniably a long and
expensive one, involving two rounds of signature gathering and the expense of a city election. Removing
a city manager only requires the votes of five city councillors and the expense of a hiring process and any
severance that is included in the manager’s contract. This is easier and faster than Recall in the case of
drastically poor performance. Further, if the manager is removed due to poor performance, the
replacement process is a purely professional one. When a mayor is recalled, it is the removal of a
popularly elected official, and more likely the result of shifting political winds, potentially alienating a
large part of the population.

We acknowledge the painful and problematic racist and xenophobic motives that have been attributed by
some historians to the creation of the city manager concept in the early 20th century. This is a reason to be
thoughtfully observant of how the system is implemented in our community 100 years later. But we are
aware of no indication that such motives were involved in the selection of the city manager form of
government for Cambridge in the 1940s, nor that it is an element of the current practice of the system
(and certainly not an element of the reasons to support its continuance). Sadly, American civic history is
full of examples of policy choices elites have made to consolidate power for themselves at the expense of
BIPOC and immigrant communities, regardless of the form of government in place at the time. The broad
diversity of our elected city councils for many decades and the recent choice of a person of color to carry
out administrative functions for our city are evidence that this terrible history does not apply to
Cambridge today.

Summary
We believe that Cambridge should have a professional and rational form of local government. We have a
long history of strong and broadly representative city councils including many thoughtful leaders who
have debated with great energy many of the most critical and controversial issues of their day. They have
not always agreed with each other, as one would expect in a city like ours. But they have decided. We
see no reason to doubt that this lively debate and decision-making will continue, and we hope it will be
more transparent and inclusive given other changes recommended by the Committee.
And, once this body has arrived at a conclusion of the best direction for our city to take, they should turn
those instructions over to a well-trained and nonpolitical professional who can implement those policies
efficiently and effectively. Our city deserves no less.

The purpose of this working draft mayor-cafo-council form charter is to put in one
place the recommendations of the Cambridge Charter Review Committee. In Order
to create the full picture of what a full charter might look like with these
recommendations, the Collins Center has incorporated standard/best practice text
in places where the Committee has not voted. These parts of text should *not* be

Subject only to express limitations on the exercise of any power or function by a municipal government in
the Massachusetts constitution or General Laws, it is the intention and the purpose of the voters of

individually enumerated in this charter.
SECTION 1-5: CONSTRUCTION
The powers of Cambridge under this charter are to be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specific
mention of any particular power is not intended to limit the general powers of the city as stated in the

general law adopted by the city, the provision of this charter shall prevail.
SECTION 1-6: INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS
Subject only to express limitations in the constitution or general laws of the Commonwealth, Cambridge
may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions, and may participate in their financing, jointly
or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with the Commonwealth or any agency or political subdivision
of the Commonwealth, or with the United States government or any of its agencies. The City Council and

ARTICLE 8: PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, PARTICIPATION, AND
COMMUNICATION
SECTION 8-1 PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CIVIC
INFRASTRUCTURE
The city shall treat public engagement as an integral part of effective and trusted governance, not just as an
occasional process or activity. The city shall treat engagement as a “multi-channel” endeavor that includes
face-to-face meetings, virtual interactions, and other online communications. The departments of city
government shall encourage collaboration in public engagement efforts with other government jurisdictions
and authorities, anchor institutions, community-based organizations, civic groups, and individual residents.
SECTION 8-2 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT AND COORDINATE
ENGAGEMENT
The city shall establish new institutional structures or adapt existing structures to oversee, support,
coordinate, track, and measure engagement on an ongoing basis. These structures may include, but are not
limited to:
(a) Council committees that include residents and other stakeholders
(b) Departments or administrative positions
(c) Public engagement commissions
(d) Community advisory boards, including boards designated to address the concerns of specific
populations
(e) Youth commissions
(f) Participatory budgeting processes and commissions
SECTION 8-3 PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
To ensure public engagement centers on the needs and goals of community members, the city shall uphold
the following principles, using them as the basis of public engagement protocols and in the establishment
of public engagement structures:
(a) Equity in engagement. Principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion should guide the
design and execution of public engagement activities. When engaging community members, city
officials should identify and proactively reach out to the community in its full diversity. To ensure
that public engagement activities are not attended only by people already active in local government
and politics, city officials should regularly recruit residents through face-to-face or personal written
invitations, social media requests, and randomized selection methods. Materials should be written
in plain, comprehensible English, and should also be translated into the other predominant
languages that residents speak and read.
Traditionally excluded and marginalized individuals and communities should be included in ways
they themselves identify as authentic and meaningful. City officials should co-design engagement
processes with community members to meet the needs of the communities served. Processes should
respect a range of values, interests, perspectives, experiences, cultures, and knowledge of those
involved.
The city should expect local the organizations and networks it works with to engage their members
in equitable and deliberative ways, so that the input received is representative of their constituents.
The city should use an equity lens to evaluate data on impacts of engagement, including costs,
benefits, and responsibilities.
(b) Accountability in engagement. There should be meaningful opportunities for community
members to bring issues, concerns, and priorities to city officials to influence city policy,
ordinances, and actions. Public engagement activities should be designed to appropriately fit the
legal authority, scope, character, and potential impact of a policy, program, or project. There should
be clarity about process sponsorship, purpose, design, and how the results will be used. The purpose

23

51

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 452

and potential influence of each public engagement process should be known by all participants in
advance but should be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions during implementation.
(c) Transparency in engagement. Communications about public issues and public engagement
opportunities should ensure community members can engage effectively. Communications should
be made in the predominant languages that residents understand. Participants should have the
opportunity to bring and share their own experiences as well as information they have gathered
about the issues at hand. Full and complete results should be shared in a manner accessible to the
public, and explanations of how the results will be used or how they will influence decisions should
be provided to process participants and the broader public.
(d) Accessibility in engagement. Public engagement activities should be broadly accessible in
terms of schedule, location, facilities, and information and communication technologies. Schedules
should accommodate a variety of participants. Locations should be nearby and reachable via
affordable transit, and some engagement activities should be conducted in places where community
members already gather regularly. Facilities should be welcoming public spaces and not present
physical or cultural barriers to participation. Online engagement opportunities should use
technologies that are freely available to residents and attend to barriers people may face, such as:
no access to broadband, limited proficiency with technology, and challenges related to deaf-blind
accessibility.
(e) Collaboration in engagement. Public engagement efforts should build on and help develop longterm, collaborative working relationships and mutual learning opportunities with residents of all
ages, civic groups, organizational partners, and other governments. This may include projectspecific or ongoing community engagement initiatives.
(f) Evaluation of engagement activities. Each public engagement activity and the state of
engagement overall should be evaluated through participant feedback, analysis, and learning that
is shared publicly and broadly. The ideas, preferences, and/or recommendations contributed by
participants should be fully documented and be made available to participants and the broader
public. Lessons learned should be applied to future public engagement activities and contribute to
the city’s overall engagement plan.

in decision making, the city council has the authority to establish and maintain one or more Resident

technology.
g) Subject to appropriation, the city shall provide resources for staff support to the

determination by the voters.

government shall encourage collaboration in public engagement efforts with other government jurisdictions
and authorities, anchor institutions, community-based organizations, civic groups, and individual residents.
SECTION 8-2 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT AND COORDINATE
ENGAGEMENT
The city shall establish new institutional structures or adapt existing structures to oversee, support,
coordinate, track, and measure engagement on an ongoing basis. These structures may include, but are not
limited to:
(a) Council committees that include residents and other stakeholders
(b) Departments or administrative positions
(c) Public engagement commissions
(d) Community advisory boards, including boards designated to address the concerns of specific
populations
(e) Youth commissions
(f) Participatory budgeting processes and commissions
SECTION 8-3 PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
To ensure public engagement centers on the needs and goals of community members, the city shall uphold
the following principles, using them as the basis of public engagement protocols and in the establishment
of public engagement structures:
(a) Equity in engagement. Principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion should guide the
design and execution of public engagement activities. When engaging community members, city
officials should identify and proactively reach out to the community in its full diversity. To ensure
that public engagement activities are not attended only by people already active in local government
and politics, city officials should regularly recruit residents through face-to-face or personal written
invitations, social media requests, and randomized selection methods. Materials should be written
in plain, comprehensible English, and should also be translated into the other predominant
languages that residents speak and read.
Traditionally excluded and marginalized individuals and communities should be included in ways
they themselves identify as authentic and meaningful. City officials should co-design engagement
processes with community members to meet the needs of the communities served. Processes should
respect a range of values, interests, perspectives, experiences, cultures, and knowledge of those
involved.
The city should expect local the organizations and networks it works with to engage their members
in equitable and deliberative ways, so that the input received is representative of their constituents.
The city should use an equity lens to evaluate data on impacts of engagement, including costs,
benefits, and responsibilities.
(b) Accountability in engagement. There should be meaningful opportunities for community
members to bring issues, concerns, and priorities to city officials to influence city policy,
ordinances, and actions. Public engagement activities should be designed to appropriately fit the
legal authority, scope, character, and potential impact of a policy, program, or project. There should

22

83

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 484

be clarity about process sponsorship, purpose, design, and how the results will be used. The purpose
and potential influence of each public engagement process should be known by all participants in
advance but should be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions during implementation.
(c) Transparency in engagement. Communications about public issues and public engagement
opportunities should ensure community members can engage effectively. Communications should
be made in the predominant languages that residents understand. Participants should have the
opportunity to bring and share their own experiences as well as information they have gathered
about the issues at hand. Full and complete results should be shared in a manner accessible to the
public, and explanations of how the results will be used or how they will influence decisions should
be provided to process participants and the broader public.
(d) Accessibility in engagement. Public engagement activities should be broadly accessible in
terms of schedule, location, facilities, and information and communication technologies. Schedules
should accommodate a variety of participants. Locations should be nearby and reachable via
affordable transit, and some engagement activities should be conducted in places where community
members already gather regularly. Facilities should be welcoming public spaces and not present
physical or cultural barriers to participation. Online engagement opportunities should use
technologies that are freely available to residents and attend to barriers people may face, such as:
no access to broadband, limited proficiency with technology, and challenges related to deaf-blind
accessibility.
(e) Collaboration in engagement. Public engagement efforts should build on and help develop longterm, collaborative working relationships and mutual learning opportunities with residents of all
ages, civic groups, organizational partners, and other governments. This may include projectspecific or ongoing community engagement initiatives.
(f) Evaluation of engagement activities. Each public engagement activity and the state of
engagement overall should be evaluated through participant feedback, analysis, and learning that
is shared publicly and broadly. The ideas, preferences, and/or recommendations contributed by
participants should be fully documented and be made available to participants and the broader
public. Lessons learned should be applied to future public engagement activities and contribute to
the city’s overall engagement plan.

consideration was daunting, acknowledging the constraints of time and capacity, the Committee focused
on addressing key aspects of the Charter. As we conclude this review, it becomes evident that numerous
considerations remain for future charter review Committees. These considerations include but are not
limited to:

Community Engagement Summary
The Committee sought to engage with the people of Cambridge to understand their expectations of city
government relating to equity, participation, accountability, transparency, justice, and democracy.
The Committee heard from - residents, community organizations, youth, neighborhood associations,
tenant organizations, political organizations, municipal stakeholders, service providers, educational
institutions, and business owners. The Committee used diverse outreach strategies to engage people where
they are, in the spaces they are comfortable in, and through the most accessible methods.

The Committee sought to inform the public about the charter review process, the Committee's goals, and
how the charter is relevant to each person's everyday life. Not only was education central to the outreach
efforts of the Committee, but the Committee prioritized gathering feedback, opinions, and new ideas,
ensuring the incorporation of community input into all Committee discussions and deliberations. The
Committee leveraged their existing networks and community leaders to involve all residents and
community groups.

Inform and General Education
➢ Fact sheets / Flyers.
In Fall 2022, informational flyers were distributed across the city in high-traffic areas to raise
awareness of the Charter Review Committee's formation and point residents to additional
information. In addition to physical flyers, the Committee leveraged their networks and
connections across Cambridge to distribute materials electronically - encouraging community and
organization leaders to circulate.

R

➢ Information Sessions and Initial Public Meetings.
The Committee held two initial public meetings in early 2023, one in person at the Cambridge
Main Library on January 24th and one the following weekend on Zoom, February 4th. These
meetings aimed to inform residents about the review process of what a city charter controls and
hear initial feedback and suggestions for the Committee.

D

➢ City Wide Mailer.
In June 2023, the Committee sent an informational postcard to all 69,100 Cambridge residential
addresses to provide information on the Charter Review Committee, high-level details on what a
charter is, and how residents can get involved.
➢ Newsletter.
A bi-weekly newsletter was sent to over 200 residents throughout the Committee's work to update
them on Committee topics, share meeting dates, and encourage public comment at Committee
meetings.
➢ Committee Members' Networks.
Throughout the 17 month review process, Committee members distributed materials and engaged
with their personal and professional Cambridge connections to inform and spread awareness of

the charter review, as well as set up times for the Committee present on charter topics and hear
from the public in organizational meetings in an effort to engage the public in familiar spaces.

Involve and Consult
➢ Public Comment.
At each bi-weekly charter review meeting, the Committee designated time for verbal public
comment. The Committee heard 91 verbal public comments from a wide range of Cambridge
residents during the review process. In addition, the Committee received 162 written comments to
cambridgecharterreview@cambridgema.gov, which were distributed to the entire Committee
before each meeting as part of the meeting materials.

1.

➢ Public Community Meetings.
The Committee held two additional public gatherings on May 16th at The Foundry and July 25th
at Tasty Burger Central. These informal community gatherings allowed community members to
dialogue with each other and Committee members on charter-related topics, share their top
priorities for Cambridge City Government and answer community questions. Over 40 community
members attended, as well as candidates for public office.

➢ Community Groups and Cambridge Events.
The Committee attended community organization meetings. Many of these were at the request of
the organizations. Others resulted from outreach. The goal was to engage the community in their
familiar groups, present on the Committee process, inform on charter topics, document public
feedback and answer community questions. The Committee also tabled at Cambridge community
events, like Mayfair, to increase general awareness and engage community members where they
work and play. The committee acknowledges that its community outreach efforts were only a
beginning, only a sampling, of what must be a broader and more comprehensive outreach process
before any Charter Reform proposals are put before the voters of Cambridge.

➢ Interviews with Previous Cambridge Elected Officials and City Employees. The Committee
conducted 11 interviews with former city councilors, city managers, an assistant city solicitor, and
a school superintendent during March and April 2023. These discussions, led by various
Committee members, sought insights from the individuals working within the government and
city charter. They shared the strengths and challenges of their roles and ideas for enhancing the
city’s foundational structures.

➢ coUrbanize. In Spring 2023, the Committee launched an online community engagement platform
to provide an additional avenue for Cambridge residents to learn about the charter review, find
resources, respond to Committee questions and dialogue with other members of the Cambridge
community. Active through the end of Summer 2023, the site received 1392 unique visitors, 108
comments and 208 poll responses.

Appendix A: Operations of the Committee and Acknowledgements
Our Committee of fifteen, fully engaged Cambridge residents convened remotely, typically twice a month
from September 2022 to January 2024, for review, discussion, debate, and evaluation of city charter
options. There were thirty-six public meetings of the full Committee, plus an even greater number of
small working group sessions devoted to particular sections of the Charter, to planning the meeting
agendas and to drafting the arguments for each form of government.

17

Our work was ably guided by the consultancy of the Collins Center of UMass Boston including Michael
Ward, Patricia Lloyd, and Elizabeth Corbo. The Collins Center has provided similar services to more than
thirty municipalities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Their deep experience with Charter Review
efforts and their perspective on local government, both practical and idealist, has been invaluable.

Shortly after the Charter Review Committee was convened, it became apparent that the group needed
dedicated and impartial staff to manage communications (including a dedicated city website), to initiate
and manage public outreach and input, to facilitate civil discussion in our meetings and, in particular, to
organize the often complex choices within the decision-making process. Anna Corning, who had critical
experience with the City of Somerville’s charter review effort, was engaged to manage these tasks and she
did so brilliantly. Thanks are due to the City Manager and the Personnel Department for recognizing the
Committee’s needs and in designating this part-time position
The City of Cambridge Law Department, in particular Elliott Veloso, faithfully attended each of our
meetings to provide answers to legal questions as they arose and to be sure that we were abiding by every
aspect of the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law and the ordinances of the City of Cambridge.

R

City Clerk Diane LeBlanc took office at about at the time our Committee was constituted. She was
helpful in determining the scheduling and posting protocols for the Committee meetings. Just as our effort
commenced, the City of Cambridge gained a new Clerk of Committees, Nicole Erwin. After a much
appreciated initial contribution from Naomi Stephens of the City Council Office, it was our good fortune
to have Ms. Erwin cover our regular meetings and compile the minutes. These minutes (attached) have
been individually reviewed and approved by our Committee as an accurate record of our proceedings.

D

Finally, throughout the project, Patrick Hayes aide to City Councillor Nolan, facilitated connection to the
City of Cambridge web presence, Zoom account and other liason services. Michael Scarlett, Chief of
Staff to Mayor Suddiqui, was an important liason to the Mayor for trouble-shooting and operational issues
as they arose.

Appendix B: Background and Project History
In 2020 the City Council began a focused discussion about the possibility of a revised or new Cambridge
City Charter.

17

The topic of the charter, in particular the form of government (Council/Manager vs Strong Mayor) as well
as modernization of PR (Proportional Representation), had come up periodically in earlier Council terms,
but the complexity of the process for change or replacement of the charter, coupled with a generally
perceived satisfaction with the current system and/or voter disinterest in the subject, had likely
contributed to an apathy in the past.

1.

With a nationwide focus on elections, as well as a local search process for a new city manager outside the
traditional line of succession, the Council may have sensed that it was an opportune time to take another
look at the 80-year-old structure of the Cambridge city government. In addition, there were aspects of the
Proportional Election mechanics, especially vote tabulation (distribution of the surplus votes and the
method of replacement of Council or School Committee members) which were out of step with new
technology and could not be changed without a deeper dive into charter reform.

A
FT

The Collins Center of UMass Boston was engaged in January 2021 to provide the Council with public
presentations and written reports that gave some background and context on city charters in general and
the various processes for their amendments or total replacements.

1. Charter Review Ballot Question

R

Following the Collins Center recommendation for Charter Review, the City Council voted to place on the
November 2021 ballot an amendment to the existing Cambridge Charter setting out the terms of a regular
and repeating Charter Review. This qualified as a minor amendment and thus did not require a home rule
legislative process such as would be required for a major revision to the Charter. 15,251 voters (of a total
21,958 votes cast) approved this Charter Amendment text as follows:

D

Section 116(b). Not later than July 1, in each year ending in a 2, the City Council shall provide for a
review to be made of the city charter by a special Committee to be established by ordinance. All members
of the special Committee shall be voters of the city not holding elective office. The special Committee
shall file a report with the City Council within 1 year of its appointment recommending any changes to
the city charter which it deems necessary or desirable, unless an extension is authorized by vote of the
City Council. Action on any proposed charter changes shall be as authorized by the Massachusetts
constitution or general laws

effects that any such changes would have upon the reasonable operation and effectiveness
of City government;
(v) submit a written report to the City Council within one (1) year of its appointment,

3. Appointment of the Charter Review Committee
The City Council, in Spring 2022, authorized an Ad Hoc Committee of four Councillors to design and
organize the selection process for the Charter Committee members. At each step of this process there was
unanimous support of the full City Council. The Cambridge Charter Review Committee is composed of
fifteen individuals who were selected by the City Council to generally represent the various demographic
characteristics of the city including, but not limited to, age, race, gender, and neighborhood. They
received no compensation for their time.

Anna Corning, Charter Review Project Manager thanked everyone who participated in Public
Comment. Anna Corning recognized Committee members for comments.
Member Kai Long shared that it is hard to make change, but to create change you have to take
the first steps, which is not always easy.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared that she would be in favor of putting the choice of form of
government to the voters.
Member Susan Shell reminded Committee members and the public that their recommendation on
form of government does become a public vote, and there are many more steps that need to be
taken before it gets to the voters of Cambridge.
Member Mina Makarious shared that the Committee has worked very hard discussing both sides
of form of government and noted that cities with strong Mayors are not necessarily doing better
with similar issues that Cambridge is facing, such as affordable housing.
Member Ellen Shachter shared that there have been strong arguments from both sides, although
she does support a strong Mayor, she recognizes that there could be challenges that come with
the change.

if any other Committee members would be available to help. Anna Corning noted that the
statement is to provide a reflection of the discussions around strong Mayor.

on that topic.

Anna Corning was available to respond and review the outline of the final report. Chair Born

report will be the record that reflects the votes and actions that were taken by the Committee.

to the City Council and shared what would happen if there was not a 2/3 majority vote.

feels very rushed, and shared concerns about the report. Anna Cornnig shared that she is open to

democratically elected PRAB.

and asked what it would look like for the Committee to potentially ask the City Council for an
additional extension. Chair Born and Anna Corning provided comments relative to extending.

Committee’s Agenda, he would express caution with the Committee voting on it because it
would violate the Open Meeting Law. Additionally, Elliott Veloso provided a response to the
Committee potentially asking for an extension and the process on how to extend.

and the City Council can override the veto with a 2/3 vote. Patricia Lloyd from the Collins
Center was available to provide some insight on veto power with Mayor and how it is used in

majority vote to override a veto by the Mayor.

Anna Corning, Project Manager shared that the focus of the discussion for the meeting was going
to be on the proposed language for resident assemblies. Anna Corning recognized Committee
members to offer comments and suggestions related to resident assemblies.
Anna Corning shared on the screen language from member Nikolas Bowie regarding resident
assemblies. Member Bowie noted that this language, which was provided as a communication in
advance of the meeting and included in the Agenda Packet, was created to help guide members
to create draft language that everyone agrees on relative to resident assemblies. Committee
members offered their concerns and comments on the proposed language and provided
suggestions on how they believe the proposed language would best serve the City. Member
Bowie was available to respond to questions and concerns brought forward by fellow Committee
members. Michael Ward from the Collins Center shared that the language that has been provided
is good and he believes the Committee is on track to make progress and positive change. Anna
Corning added the suggested changes to the working document on the screen as Committee
members made them during the discussion (Attachment A).
Anna Corning shared that she would like to change the focus of the meeting discussion to
elections. She made note of the suggested changes towards elections that have been brought up
in previous meetings, which included granting 16 and 17 years old as well as non-citizens the
ability to vote in municipal elections and changing the municipal election year to line up with
State and Presidential elections. Anna Corning recognized Committee members to provide
additional topics they would like to discuss relative to elections at the next meeting.
Michael Ward reminded Committee members that the Secretary of States Office is usually
opposed to municipalities moving to an even numbered year for elections and provided the
reasoning as to why they are opposed, but encouraged the Committee to continue to try and
move forward with the changes they best see fit. Member Stockard shared that it is important for
Committee members to continue with the idea of even numbers to encourage residents to come
out and vote and double the number of people who are showing up for municipal elections.
Member Mina Makarious shared that they believe it is important for the Committee to discuss
how they would like the City Council to present the new Charter language to the Legislature.
They noted that they believe the Legislature should not have the ability to take language out of
the proposed Charter.
Member Nikolas Bowie shared that at a future meeting they would like to discuss campaign
finance and noted how Cambridge currently has zero authority over elections under the State
Constitution and would like to push for the City to have some authority of campaign finance
laws. Member Bowie also shared that they would like to discuss the methods of proportional
representation.
Member Patrick Magee shared concerns about making too many changes to elections which
could potentially complicate the language moving forward in the State Legislature’s Office.
Member Magee did share he was in favor of 16 and 17 year olds and non-citizens having the
ability to vote.

Anna Corning were available to respond to comments and concerns from Committee members.
Many Committee members offered comments that were in support of a resident assembly or
citizen panel, and shared their excitement and suggestions on how the Charter and the City can
move forward with one. In addition to Anna Corning and Member Clermont, representatives
from the Collins Center, Michael Ward and Patricia Lloyd, were available to provide information
on the topic. Committee members shared that they would like to continue the discussion on
resident assemblies and citizen panels to have the opportunity to create language that would be
appropriate to bring to the City Council.
Anna Corning shared that when the Charter Review working group on resident/citizen
assemblies met, the intention was to have a short-term resident/citizen group to be tasked with a
specific topic or policy that may be related to a goal from the City Council. Anna Corning asked
Committee members to consider whether that is the type of group they would be interested in
creating language for, or would they be more interested in having a resident/citizen group that is
created to meet on a long-term basis and tasked with more than one topic or policy throughout
their term. Anna Corning shared on the screen a preliminary draft document from the Collins
Center on Public Communication and Engagement, which was provided in advance of the
meeting and included in the Agenda Packet. The document included two proposed options for

frame around budget priorities and the City Manager Evaluation Process (Attachment C). Anna
Corning and Committee Members offered suggestions and comments on how the Charter
Review Committee could potentially revise the time frame for the two topics in ways they
believe would be the most successful for the City. Anna Corning shared on the screen proposed
language for City Council Strategic Goals and City Council Budget Priorities (Attachment D)
and asked Committee members to share what they think is important to include in the Charter.
Member Jim Stockard shared that he agreed with all the proposed elements in the City Council
Strategic Goal section and noted that even though the City Council and the City Manager are two
separate parts of the government, it would be important to look at them as a team working
together to set goals and collaborate.
Member Kaleb Abebe shared concerns about the possibility of the City Council and City
Manager not agreeing when it comes to goal settings. Anna Corning noted that the main goal
right now is focusing on City Council goals with the possibility of bringing the City Manager
into the process and seeing what is achievable.
Member Kai Long asked how these goals are relayed to the public. Anna Corning shared that at a
future date, the Committee will be discussing City Manager responsiveness to Policy Orders and
public awareness. Member Long suggested that in relation to budget priorities, the City Council
within their budget is given funding to use towards specific goals of the Council.
Member Lisa Peterson noted that it is important that goals and priorities work together to be
successful. Member Peterson suggested adding public tracking of the goals, meeting
benchmarks, and the importance of having those available to the public.
Chair Born shared that these goals are here to help make the City Council, as a body, the policy
making and governing body of the City.
Member Patrick Magee shared that having the goal setting start at the beginning of new City
Council terms will help normalize the political culture of the City. He noted that City Council
candidates can promote their elections with their proposed goals and policies, which can then be
potentially adopted in the new term. Member Magee shared that by default it would make
candidates and those elected more accountable.
Anna Corning shared that moving forward, she will take all the thoughts and comments on the
draft City Council Strategic Goals and use them as provisions to add to the current Charter.
Member Jim Stockard offered concerns with some of the language in the potential elements
within the City Council Budget Priorities and provided suggestions on how it could be revised.

creative thinking moving forward and was open to suggestions on how the Committee can
accomplish the goals they are setting.

could be put in place in the Charter. Elizabeth Corbo shared that this topic is something that is

it. Lisa Peterson suggested that it is something that the Committee and Collins Center should
investigate more to try and include in the Charter.
Member Mina Makarious offered comments and suggestions on Council turnover and shared
they agreed with some of the comments made by previous members, but wants to be mindful in

process and low voter turnout.

Committee to represent the groups that they are a part of. Member Afreen shared concerns about

government and not to help those who may want to pursue being involved. Member Afreen

would like to have Committee meetings that are not just through Zoom, but in person, to promote

Corbo also noted a tool that can be used for residents is a class or seminar on how a specific local

who are interested in running for City Council.

Council. Anna Corning responded by sharing that there will be time before the Committee starts

discussing representation.

Public Comment
Valerie Bonds offered comments on anti-bullying policy for Councillors in Boston, two-year
terms for Councillors, and the process of electing a Mayor.
Anna Corning, Charter Review Committee Project Manager, explained to the Committee that the
Council adopted a City Manager Agenda item at the June 26, 2023 City Council meeting making
Charter Review Committee members Special Municipal Employees.
Anna Corning shared that she would like to continue the discussion from the previous meeting
on term limits for City Councillors. Member Ellen Shachter offered comments on their
experience with participating in a Board with term limits and how to balance democracy and
participation, noting that new people will bring in new ideas.
Anna Corning recognized Member Susan Shell, Chair Kathleen Born, Member Jessica DeJesus
Acevedo, Member Mina Makarious, Member Patrick Magee, Member Nikolas Bowie, Member
Jim Stockard, Member Lisa Peterson, Member Mosammat Faria Afreen, Member Max Clermont,
and Member Kevin Chen who offered comments on term limits. Discussion included Committee
members sharing concerns and suggestions on term limits, with some members expressing that
they would be in favor of staggered terms, while others were leaning towards not having term
limits. Member Kevin Chen highlighted that the Committee should focus on what type of term
limit would serve the public’s interest the most. Committee members recognized the importance
of encouraging younger residents to be more involved with government and noted how term
limits could discourage them from pursuing their participation. It was also suggested that voting
in a Cambridge election can be overwhelming, which can push residents away from going out to
vote.
Anna Corning reminded members that the Committee took a straw poll at the previous meeting
not to xtend term limits for City Councillors and noted that it is always something the Committee
can come back to in the future to see where everyone is standing.

Anna Corning brought forward that she would like to conduct a straw poll with Committee
members sharing if they would like to continue the conversation on term limits or are content
with ending the conversation. There were nine members who shared that they would no longer
like to continue the discussion, three members that would like to continue discussion, and three
members that were absent during the poll.
Anna Corning opened discussion to Committee members on the election and powers of the
Mayor/Chair of the City Council. Committee members discussed whether the title of Mayor
should be changed to Chair of the City Council, Head of the City Council, Speaker of the
Council, or President of the City Council. Chair Born suggested that the Mayor should not be the
Chair of the School Committee and that School Committee members should be able to elect their
own Chair. Chair Born noted that she was in favor of having a member of the City Council
participate as a member of the School Committee for the purposes of budgeting. Members of the
Committee agreed that there should be a change of title as well as agreeing with comments about
the School Committee. Member Lisa Peterson commented that the Charter should reflect having
a goal setting process for every term regarding Councillors because it can have a positive effect
towards the City.
Anna Corning recognized Michael Ward from the Collins Center who noted that President and
Chair are titles that have been used in municipal bodies, but he was not familiar with Speaker
being used in Massachusetts.
Committee members continued discussion on changing the title of the Mayor and what role the
Mayor should play in the City.
Anna Corning shared with the Committee that she would like to take a straw poll on changing
the title of Mayor to Chair of the City Council, Head of the City Council, or President of the City
Council. There were eleven members that were in favor of changing the title, one member who
shared they have no opinion, and three members that were absent during the poll.
Anna Corning opened discussion to Committee members on the appointment process for
department heads and multi member bodies. Anna Corning noted that currently the City Council
appoints the City Manager, the City Auditor, and the City Clerk and noted that the City has many
multi member bodies, Boards and Commissions, and Committees. She noted that the City
Manager is currently responsible for making those appointments and that some of the Boards and
Commission require Council approval.
Anna Corning recognized member Jim Stockard who shared that he believes the City Manager
should be able to pick their own team when it comes to the executive branch and department
heads within the City. He noted that if the Council wants the City Manager to be effective, it is
not unreasonable for them to pick the team which they trust will help make the City successful.
Member Stockard also shared that the City Council approval of appointments to Boards and
Commissions is reasonable because they are policy making bodies. Many members of the
Committee shared that they agreed with the comments that were made by Member Stockard.

Anna Corning recognized Member Nikolas Bowie who suggested that the City Council should
have the power to remove or discipline department heads and offered comments on appointments
to Boards and Commissions and the importance of their role within the City. Member Ellen
Schachter shared that she was not in favor of the City Council having the power to remove
department heads. Member Max Clermont agreed. Member Kevin Chen offered suggestions on
City Council removal of department heads.
Elliot Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor, offered clarifying remarks on Boards and
Commissions and the role some department heads play in those Boards. Elliot Veloso was
available to respond to questions and concerns from the Committee. Michael Ward shared
examples of how the City Council is involved with the hiring process from other municipalities.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:30p.m.

Anna Corning, Project Manager, opened public comment.
Valerie Bonds thanked Anna Corning for hosting an event in the community room at 808
Memorial Drive and making herself available to questions from residents and offered comments
and suggestions on term limits for Councillors.
Anna Corning shared that she would like to conduct a straw poll to help focus meeting
discussions on topics the Committee members are most interested in and use the poll as a tool
moving forward.
The first straw poll was to determine if Committee members were interested in keeping an atlarge City Council, or continuing the discussion about adding district Councillors. Nine
Committee members were in favor of maintaining at-large Councillors, three Committee
members were in favor of continuing the discussion, and three members were recorded as absent.
The second straw poll was to determine if Committee members are interested in continuing the
conversation on term lengths for City Councillors or if they are interested in keeping the current
term length. The Committee members who were present chose unanimously to keep the current
term length for City Councillors.
The final straw poll was to determine if the Committee was interested in discussing the addition
of term limits for the City Councillors. Four Committee members were in favor of continuing the
discussion of adding term limits and eight were not in favor of continuing the discussion.
Anna Corning shared that Chair Born, Member Max Clermont, and Member Lisa Peterson have
been discussing ideas on adding additional elements for public engagement into the Charter.
Anna Corning gave an overview of the discussions between the Committee members around
engagement. Anna Corning shared that one thing that she would like the Committee to focus on
is citizen participation mechanisms, which include free petitions and group petitions, and offered
examples of both. Member Max Clermont noted that a free petition gives residents the
opportunity to bring issues forward on the City Council Agenda by submitting the petition as a
communication. Anna Corning shared with the Committee that a group petition needs a threshold
of anywhere between 150-300 resident signatures or a percentage of the voters from the last
municipal election, which could be around 2%-5%, once the petition has collected signatures it
would then and require the City Council to hold a public hearing on the matter being brought
forward through the petition. Committee members were recognized for questions and concerns
and team members from the Collins Center Michael Ward and Elizabeth Corbo were available to
respond and provide further information on petitions and public engagement. It was noted that if
more public engagement were to be proposed in the Charter, the Committee should focus on
language that would include goal setting for City Councillors and how information should be
more accessible to the public.
Anna Corning shared that Chair Born, Member Clermont, and Member Peterson discussed two
other potential provisions. The first was a resident assembly, which would include a large group
of random, diverse individuals who are given questions and topics that they are to address. Anna
Corning offered suggestions and examples of how a resident assembly could be used in

Cambridge. Member Nikolas Bowie and Member Jim Stockard shared that they strongly support
resident assemblies. Member Jennifer Gilbert and Member Susan Shell offered comments and
shared concerns about resident assemblies only having a short time together to focus on
important topics and how participants in resident assemblies are selected. Anna Corning shared
additional information on resident assemblies and made suggestions on how the Charter Review
Committee can move forward with the addition on resident assemblies in the Charter.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:30p.m.

Legislative Branch of government to Committee Members. Anna Corning noted that there should
be three main points that Committee Members should focus on during conversation, which were:
1. Does the Committee want to recommend a change to how City Councillors represent
the City? Adding some or all district representation to the current all-at-large structure.
2. Does the Committee want to change the length of terms for City Councillors (or
include staggered terms)? Does the Committee want to establish term limits for City
Councillors?
3. Role of Mayor/Chair of City Council. How is the Mayor/Chair elected? What should
the power and duties of the Mayor/Chair of City Council be?

Member Ellen Shachter offered comments on ward representation and at large Councillors and
shared that they believed a key problem with the system is making sure minorities get the proper
representation.
Member Susan Shell shared that she agreed with comments made by Member Ellen Shachter and
noted it is important that areas of the City are not left out in decision making, which could
happen by having neighborhood representation.
Member Lisa Peterson offered comments on the possibility of district Councillors and shared it
could be beneficial to some residents in the City, but found the City being broken up into three
districts would be problematic for effective representation.
Member Mina Makarious noted that they have similar thoughts to Member Lisa Peterson, and
shared concerns about what does not work for the current system with low turnout rates and low
representation.
Member Jessica Acevedo shared that district representation is important to have individuals
represent the diverse population and noted that they were in favor of staggered terms for
Councillors.
Member Patrick Magee shared frustrations with the current City government on both the
administration and government side. Member Magee offered comments on district representation
and goal setting.

they would be interested in exploring where to direct attention on the legislative side of
government.

Chair of the City Council to reflect what they actually are and also felt strongly against district
based representation.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared the importance of accountability and having a city-wide
perspective when it comes to major changes in the City. Member Gilbert noted that they were not
in favor of switching to district representation at this time.
Member Kai Long offered the suggestion of each Councillor having different responsibilities in
representation to help direct community members who have concerns and noted that there should
be term limits for Councillors and possibly the City Manager.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that she believes that proportional representation already allows
for neighborhood representation. She is not in favor of districts. The Chair offered comments on
term limits, noting that she is not in favor of term limits, in particular eight or ten year term
limits or shorter.
Members of the Charter Review Committee continued their discussion on government by
offering concerns and suggestions on ways the Committee can continue to move forward with
topics they wish to address while forming a new Charter to propose to the Council. Anna

Corning, Elizabeth Corbo, and Michael Ward from the Collins Center were available to respond
to Committee members. Anna Corning shared that if Committee members were interested in
learning more information on the roles and power of duties of the Chair of City Council/Mayor,
she and the Collins Center would be available to provide material for future discussions.
Member Lisa Peterson shared concerns from residents on whether the Mayor should be the Chair
of the School Committee or if it should be someone that is specifically elected to be on the
School Committee. Member Peterson noted that she was in favor of having the Mayor being the
Chair, but also offered suggestions on how the Chair could be elected. Chair Born responded to
comments made by Member Peterson, sharing that if a Mayor were to be elected there should be
a discussion on what the roles and duties of the Mayor should be.
Member Patrick Magee asked if the Chair could go through the process of how the Mayor is
currently elected and share her experience while being on the Cambridge City Council. Chair
Born was available to respond and was happy to give an overview of the process.
Anna Corning reviewed the major themes that were discussed throughout the meeting and
recognized Committee Members for comments. Elizabeth Corbo offered comments on theories
on why officials are challenged less in district representation versus at large. Anna Corning
shared suggestions from the public on how the districts could potentially be divided.
Anna Corning suggested that if Members do not feel strongly about changing something, going
forward there should be votes taken in order to move on from certain discussions and topics.
Members of the Charter Review, the Collins Center, and Anna Corning discussed the City having
a “311” informational telephone number similar to Somerville to assist residents with reporting
various concerns and incidents and receiving a response in a timely manner.
Member Ellen Shachter shared concerns about term limits. Anna Corning, Michael Ward, and
Elizabeth Corbo were available to respond and provide examples of term limits in other
municipalities in Massachusetts and other States. Michael Ward noted that term limits are very
rare in Massachusetts. Anna Corning shared that she would get more information on
Massachusetts municipalities to provide to the Committee. Member Jennifer Gilbert asked the
Collins Center why Massachusetts is different from other States regarding term limits. Michael
Ward shared that he would look into it further.
Member Kai Long offered comments on term limits and noted that they would be in favor of
term limits for various reasons, including having more diversity.
Anna Corning reminded Committee members and the public of future meet and greets with
residents and noted that there will be no meeting on July 4, 2023.

government. The chart reviewed the potential decision areas which included qualifications, term
of Office, compensation, prohibitions, evaluation, goal setting, powers/duties, appointments by
Office, temporary appointments, temporary vacancy in Office, removal (City Manager), and Veto
(Mayor). While reviewing the chart, comments and concerns that were brought forward by
Committee members were added to the document (Attachment B). Members from the Collins
Center and Anna Corning were available to respond to questions and concerns from Committee
members.
Member Ellen Shachter shared concerns about the procedure for the Committee moving forward
with decision making. Anna Corning noted that the plan was to try and finish up the form of
government discussion at the current meeting with the goal of a vote being taken at the next
meeting. Anna Corning shared that the majority vote on form of government would then be the
focus moving forward and members who vote in the minority would have the opportunity to
produce a minority section on that form of government to be submitted with the final report.
Member Ellen Shacter suggested that if Members were not available to vote at the next meeting,
they could possibly submit a vote by proxy. The Chair, Kathleen Born noted that the Law
Department should be consulted on this issue.
Members Kai Long and Susan Shell offered comments on democracy and voter turnout. Member
Nikolas Bowie shared that they agree with Kai Long and Susan Shell on voter turnout and noted
that the low turnout in the City is not a good way to run the City. Nikolas Bowie noted that the
Committee can make changes within their control to change voter turnout. Anna Corning and
Michael Ward offered comments and suggestions about voter turnout and shared that the
Committee can look at other ways to increase voter participation. The Chair, Kathleen Born
asked for clarification on ways to increase participation in elections. Anna Corning and Member
Nikolas Bowie, noted that under the State’s Home Rule Amendment, municipalities are not
allowed to change voting laws without State Legislative approval.

Members of the Charter Review Committee held a roundtable meeting on Tuesday, April 25,
2023, to continue their discussion on the form of government in Cambridge.
The Chair, Kathleen Born, reminded members of the Committee and the public that it was a
roundtable meeting, noting that no public comment and no votes would be taken during the
meeting. Present at the meeting were Michael Ward and Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center
who made themselves available to respond to any questions or comments brought forward by
Committee members.
Anna Corning, Project Manager, gave an overview of the agenda for the meeting and noted that
the discussions would be on City Manager-Council-Mayor form of government and related
changes and on Mayor-Chief Administrative and Finance Officer (CAFO)-Council form of
government and related changes. Anna Corning shared that Committee members should be
concentrating on the strengths and challenges of each during the discussion.
Anna Corning recognized member Jim Stockard who led a focused discussion on City ManagerCouncil-Mayor form of government. Jim Stockard gave an overview of the pros of having a City
Manager, sharing that City Managers are not subject to political pressure and are able to choose a
successful team to run the various City Departments. Jim Stockard shared that they feel with the
many communications, public comment, and forums the Charter Review Committee has
conducted, the public seem to be leaning towards keeping a City Manager. Jim Stockard shared a
question that was brought forward by a member of the public which was, “What is the problem
you are trying to fix?”. Jim Stockard shared that that question has stuck with him and believes
that the City, for the most part, runs fairly well with the current form of government. Jim
Stockard reviewed some of the cons that have been brought up during discussion regarding City
Manager form of government, sharing the most noticeable concern with members is the City
Manager not being an elected official and having too much power overseeing the budget. After
Jim Stockard reviewed the pros and cons of the City Manager-Council-Mayor form of
government, Committee members were able to offer comments and concerns, with many
members sharing their opinion on this type of form of government.
Anna Corning recognized member Nikolas Bowie who led a focused discussion on MayorCAFO-Council form of government. Nikolas Bowie shared that no form of existing democracy
is a guarantee that an elected leader will care about everybody in the community, but what
democracy does well is create a strong incentive for elected officials to care what people think.
Nickolas Bowie noted that as members of the Committee, they have many resources to ensure
that City government is accountable. They noted that it is important, whether it is with electing a
strong Mayor, or any type of form of government, that elections are as inclusive and as
representative as possible. By stressing the importance of having representation in elections,
voters will have the ability to make the government more accountable than it currently already is.
Nikolas Bowie stressed that democratic accountability has been the biggest factor in those in
favor of a strong Mayor. Nikolas Bowie shared that they were in favor of a suggestion made by
the Collins Center, which would include a Resident Advisory Committee for strong Mayor form
of government and suggested that having a citizen jury and/or having random people chosen to
participate in decisions would be beneficial. Nikolas Bowie ended by noting that they believe

a

Packet Pg. 603

that the City will work better if everyone can equally participate in deciding how everything in
the community can flourish. After Nikolas Bowier reviewed the pros and cons of the MayorCAFO- Council form of government, discussion was open to Committee members to offer their
comments and concerns.
Anna Corning suggested that moving forward it could be a good idea for the Committee to start
focusing on other aspects of the Charter and return to a form of government discussion after
Committee members have thought about it more.
The Chair, Kathleen Born offered closing remarks about form of government and shared they
agreed with Anna Corning on the idea of taking a break on form of government discussion and
coming back to it later. The Chair shared that it is important to discuss other topics of the Charter
so the Committee can continue moving forward.
The Chater Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:30p.m.

proportional representation.
Gleb Bahmutov spoke in support of keeping rank choice voting and at large City Councillors.

Jameson Quinn offered comments around staggered Council terms and suggestions on rank
choice ballet voting.
Kai Long shared that it would be important to create and collect the data that is being submitted
from communications to help the Committee have a better understanding of what the residents
are saying. Anna Corning, Project Manager, shared that she would be happy to start tallying and
creating an overall summary of the opinions and information that is being received from the
public.
Anna Corning, Project Manager, noted that they are in the process of creating an online survey
with members Lisa Peterson and Jennifer Gilbert as well as Chair Born. Anna Corning shared

on March 22nd.

Members of the Charter Review Committee discussed and shared concerns around conducting a
survey within the community regarding the form of government and matters related to it. Anna
Corning noted that it is important for Committee members to share their suggestions and ideas
for surveying, so the Committee can execute the survey to get the best outcome possible. Anna
shared that there can be more than one way a survey is done.
Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center noted that conducting this survey will not be the last
opportunity to receive feedback from the public and reviewed what the process will look like in

instances where input will be gathered from the public.
Anna Corning shared that they would like to transition the topic of discussion to form of
government and have Committee members share their thoughts.

Mayor and a Chief Administrative and Finance Officer (CAFO). They noted that in their
experience, they have seen more accountability with a Mayor.
Kai Long shared that they worry about having a strong Mayor and the accountability between the
Mayor and City Council that would be involved and how they would be able to work together.
Mina Makarious shared that they are leaning closer to a City Manager form of government and
noted that a strong Mayor with a CAFO could work if the Mayor’s position would not have
complete power and the possibility of making decisions with the Council.
Nikolas Bowie shared they support a strong Mayor system and likes the idea of having a CAFO.
They stressed the importance that whoever sets the budget for the City should be accountable to
the voters.
Jim Stockard shared that they are in favor of City Manager form of government and he likes the
idea that the City Manager can stay away from campaigning and elections. Jim Stockard noted
that they would like the City Council to have a leader within the Council that is elected to
advocate for good policies to benefit the City.
Lisa Peterson noted that they are in favor of the City Manager form of government, and shared
that a good City Manager tries to balance the interests of people across the City. They shared that
if the Committee went with a strong Mayor it would be important to have an elected CAFO and
for the Council to have more authority around the budget.
Susan Shell shared that they were in favor of a strong Mayor with a CAFO and that the budget
should be overseen by elected officials.
Mosammat Faria Afreen shared that they were leaning toward having a strong Mayor form of
government due to the potential of increasing voter turnout and noted it was important to have a
strong public figure in Cambridge in terms of infrastructure and having a larger say with the
budget.

Kaleb Abebe offered comments around form of government and shared they were in favor of
keeping the current form of government.
Kathleen Born noted that a strong elected official is the best way for the City to have a future.
The Chair noted that the City is stuck right now and it would benefit the City to have someone
come in with a vision for the future and provide answers on how to get there.
Kevin Chen offered comments around the budget and noted that with a strong Mayor system,
decisions around the budget could be different. They shared that they agree with the Chair about
lack of leadership in the City and would support a strong Mayor system with a CAFO role in
place.

for the City to create leadership and prioritize the City. They shared that a Mayor is someone that
would be more accountable to lead the City in the future.
Jessica DeJesus Acevedo shared that they believe the City is going towards the direction of
change, but is concerned with having a strong Mayor form of government. They shared they
would like to look more into how the City Council can be improved and noted it would be
important to help increase the number of minorities who are represented in the City, and shared
that with a strong Mayor it would not be a full representation of citizens.
Patrick Magee shared that they support a City Manager - Council form of government and
offered comments on the budget, noting that the past City Managers have not been able to
accomplish what they have with regards to the budget without the push from the City Council.

agrees with comments made by Jim Stockard.
The meeting was extended thirty minutes by the Chair, Kathleen Born. No vote was taken.

Marilee Meyer shared they do not want to see more power from the Council and asked that the
current system stays in place.
Valerie Bonds supported the same comments made by previous speakers and shared the City
Council is not ready for a four year term.
Stephen Cellucci thanked the Committee for taking time to discuss the future of the City and
spoke in support of a strong Mayor.
Jesse Baer spoke in favor of a strong Mayor and shared that politics is democracy and politics is
under a threat and this is not the time to be moving away from politics.
Suzanne Blier spoke in favor of keeping the City Manager for now to see how the new City
Manager is in his new role. She offered suggestions around the possibility of residents voting for
the Mayor during Council elections.
Robert Winters offered many suggestions on updating and reformatting the current Charter and
shared that giving the Election Commission more flexibility in some of the ways things are done
would be beneficial.
Heather Hoffman offered comments around proportional representation and shared that done
correctly, politics is the art of getting somewhere by bringing people together.
James Williamson shared a quote from Niccolo Machiavelli and would like to see a shift of
power where citizens have input in decisions that are made and participate in the decisions that
effect their lives.
Ilan Levy shared it is important for residents to have a clear understanding of the actual
consequences of the form of government that the City will be using and voices of the people
need to be heard in the final decisions that are made.
Anna Corning, Project Manager, introduced Elizabeth Corbo and Michael Ward from the Collins
Center who gave an overview of their chart titled “Menu of Forms of Government with Example
Options for Modifications” (Attachment A). After their presentation they made themselves
available to Committee Members to respond to any questions or concerns.
Member Kai Long offered comments around strong Mayor and Manager and shared that the
possibility of modifying and working on what government the City already has could be

if the Committee decides to keep the City Manager he would like to see the Council and the
public be more involved with the approach of hiring a new City Manager.
Member Nikolas Bowie shared he was in favor of switching to a strong Mayor system and
realizing how much Massachusetts State Law puts into the budgetary process is a key factor that
helped him lean towards a strong Mayor.

Member Lisa Peterson shared that she believes that the current system works very well but could
use some improvement. Lisa Peterson noted that a directly elected Mayor is putting a lot of
power to one person versus having a City Council that would require a vote of five people to
make decisions within the City. Member Peterson shared that mutually agreeable goals are
needed between the Council and Manager to make progress.
Member Jim Stockard offered comments and shared that the Charter Review Committee should
not want to change the Charter just for the sake of change, but there are improvements in the
current Charter the Committee can make moving forward. He shared that he likes the idea of
keeping the current government system, noting that the City Manager is held accountable by the
City Council. Jim Stockard also agreed with statements made by member Nikolas Bowie around
the budget process and shared that the City Council should have more input and accountability
with the budget.
Member Susan Shell shared that they agreed with comments made by member Jim Stockard. She
shared that she is reluctant to change things radically without more time to deliberate and noted
that maybe this is not the best time to go with a strong Mayor but feels most of the changes that
will happen will be at the level of the City Council.
Member Jennifer Gilbert encouraged all members to speak on the topic of form of government if
they feel comfortable. They shared that they are leaning towards a strong Mayor government and
offered comments on why they are leaning that way, noting that it is hard to have a nonelected
official be the voice of the City in regards to the budget and representing the City regionally.
Member Kevin Chen shared that they appreciate hearing comments from fellow Committee
members and from listening to the conversation at the meeting, they are leaning towards strong
Mayor only if there is a Chief Administrative and Finance Officer (CAFO) role partnered with a
Mayor. Kevin Chen noted that having a Mayor will help bring accountability and transparency to
the City, which is what many residents and Committee members have voiced in their concerns,
and a CAFO will allow a manager type role that can help the City go in the right direction.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen shared that if the Committee decides to keep the current form
of government one thing they would like to see changed would be towards the budget, and noted
giving the responsibility of the budget to the elected officials is important.
Member Patrick Magee agrees with comments made around the budget process and shared it
would be helpful to look at past budgets and compare them to municipalities that have a strong
Mayor to see where Cambridge’s budget stands in comparison to those to see if members are
happy with that, or what the difference would be under different circumstances. He shared that
there could be the possibility of strong Mayor form of government not being progressive enough
and noted there is a balance of having a collective group deciding who the City Manager is could
be a good safety net.
Member Kaleb Abebe shared he had similar thoughts to Patrick Magee to compare budgetary
spending with other municipalities and how it relates to Cambridge. Kaleb Abebe offered
comments around the budget and noted that more input from elected officials and the City

Council, is more of a high priority for him while also maintaining the Council-Manager
relationship.
Member Jessica DeJesus Acevedo shared that she is apprehensive towards elected voting due to
the lack of representation of minorities. She offered comments around the budget and the
struggles of being a small business owner and resident in Cambridge, but noted she was in favor
of a City Manager structure because she believes that role is more accountable. She shared
suggestions around terms and noted that a four-year term would be more beneficial for the
Council and the City to accomplish goals.
Member Max Clermont noted that he was in favor of a strong Manager and Council form of
government and shared that there is more of a role that the Mayor could play as a member of the
Council and with the City Manager.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that it has been very difficult to decide on the form of
government and shared she is not ready to move away from a City Manager form of government.
She agrees there could be changes made in the Charter and a more efficient way to elect a Mayor
to Chair the City Council.
Member Kai Long shared that having nine elected leaders and helping them figure out how to
work together would be extremely beneficial and a good goal for the Committee to work
together towards.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen noted that the rise of costs in the City has played a role in how
many people who identify as a minority vote in Cambridge and shared that the idea of having
people who may not live in Cambridge, but work in Cambridge, vote as well, which could be a
benefit regarding the increase of voter turnout.
Member Lisa Peterson had a clarifying question about how much input the Boston City Council
recently got towards the budget and how they were able to make that change. Anna Corning
noted that it was a ballot question that the State gave Boston to allow new power to the Council
to allow them to amend, reject, or propose line items, as long as the overall budget number did
not increase.
Member Nikolas Bowie stressed the importance that when the Committee goes to the State
Legislature, they should approach the process from the perspective that the Charter is the vehicle
to push through the legislature the changes the people of Cambridge want.
Member Susan Shell shared it is useful to think about the residents of Cambridge who will be
here in twenty years, and noted that decisions made today may influence what the demographic
of the city is in the future.
Anna Corning noted that at the next Charter Review Committee meeting she would like to finish
the conversation and take a working consensus vote on the form of government.
The Chair, Kathleen Born extended the meeting by fifteen minutes, no vote was taken.

Member Jennifer Gilbert shared she looks forward to more conversation to help flush out and get
a better consensus on form of government.
Member Mina Makarious offered comments regarding how the Committee will vote next week
on the form of government.
Member Kai Long had a clarifying question on how the Charter can make the City Council and
City Council- Manager relationship more accountable and if a Mayor-Council would be an easier
relationship to build towards accountability. Anna Corning noted that with a Mayor system, they
are less accountable to the City Council because they do not have to report to the City Council,
whereas the City Manager does have to report to the City Council.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that she would like more information from the Collins Center
regarding what a tight goal setting process would look like to tie goals to the budget. She also
shared that understanding more about the State Legislative process and other Charters submitting
Home Rule petitions would be helpful moving forward. Anna Corning and Elizabeth Corbo were
available to respond and shared that there are many methods to use towards goal setting.
Member Kevin Chen had a clarifying question regarding the possibility of voters being able to
appoint and remove a City Manager. Elizabeth Corbo provided answers, sharing that there is the
possibility of having a form of a citizen free petition.
Member Jim Stockard shared it is important to communicate with State Representatives and
Legislators sooner so they are on the same page and have an understanding of what the
Committee is trying to address.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen thanked the Collins Center for their chart and shared a table
that represents the roles of the Manager and CAFO with a column on how they could be kept
accountable by the Council and the voters would be helpful. Anna Corning shared that a CAFO
role is person who is working for the Mayor and acts as a department head.
Anna Corning thanked everyone for participating and believes it was a very productive meeting.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 8:00p.m.
Clerk’s Note: The City of Cambridge/22 City View records every City Council meeting and

Anna Corning, Project Manager, shared that she would like to hear opinions on the proposed
timeline (Attachment B) and adopt it at the meeting. She noted that she tried to incorporate the
two main items she heard as feedback from members, which included dedicated time to review
drafted charter text, and dedicated time slots for topic-specific public forums. Anna noted that
the plan would be to propose this timeline to the Council at the meeting being held on March 22
with the understanding that the Charter Review Committee would ask for an extension through
the end of the year. Anna opened discussion to members about edits and concerns around the
proposed timeline.
Member Ellen Shachter had a clarifying question around summer meetings and the possibility of
some members being away on vacation. She noted the importance of making sure there is a
quorum for summer meetings so the Committee is able to meet. Anna Corning noted that there
will be a summer break where meetings will not be held and shared she would be reaching out to
members to confirm their availability.
Member Susan Shell had a clarifying question on how the timeline would be affected by an
extension and what it looks like moving forward. Anna Corning noted that the timeline is the
framework behind asking for the extension with the goal being to discuss the extension at the
City Council Special meeting on March 22, and shared that the timeline currently goes to midNovember, and members should think about if they are able to continue to make a commitment
to participate.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that it would be good to end in November because it is an
election year and it would be good to have the current City Council members present when the
new Charter Review language is complete and ready to be submitted. The Chair encouraged
members to look at the proposed timeline so they have a good idea of what will be happening in
the upcoming months and future meetings.
Member Kai Long offered comments and positive feedback around the proposed timeline and is
in favor of moving forward with it, and believes November is a good end date.

Yes – 12, No – 0, Absent – 3. Motion passed.
The Chair, Kathleen Born reminded Committee members of the Special City Council meeting
being held on March 22nd and encouraged some members to join in the meeting, but also stressed
the importance that Charter Review Committee members that do attend have to be less than
seven to stay away from a quorum.
Anna Corning introduced City Manager Yi-An Huang who thanked the Committee for inviting
him to join the meeting. The City Manager offered opening remarks about his transition from his
previous employment to his current role as City Manager, and shared his background on what led
him to become a City Manager. He shared that he recognized the opportunity to come into the
City to build off of things that are already strong, and work towards strengthening areas in the
City where it was needed. The City Manager noted that he believes the conversation with the
Charter Review Committee is very important, and he is excited and happy to share what he has
learned, seen, and experienced since taking the role of City Manager.
Member Kevin Chen began by asking the City Manager if there were a Mayor position that had
been opened with the City, is that something he would have applied for. The City Manager
shared that he would not have applied for a political role like that, he does enjoy reading about
politics, but does not see himself as a politician. The City Manager noted that what excites him
about the role of City Manager is being able to build a strong organization and a culture where he
is able get things done.
Member Ellen Shachter offered comments and asked the City Manager what he believes is the
appropriate interface with the people in the community and the position of City Manager. The
City Manager responded by sharing he believes that it is very important to have all levels of
engagement within the community and noted that there is always room for improvement on how
the City continues to be accessible, engaging, and receiving feedback.
Member Susan Shell had a question for the City Manager regarding his relationship with the City
Council around legislation and also questioned how the City Manager, within his own office, sets
up the various divisions and demands and prioritizes what needs get met with first. The City
Manager began by noting that it is a unique governing structure. He shared that he believes the
Councillors got into their roles because they wanted to make an impact and shape their
community. He noted he believes his role when he is working with the Councillors is to try and
come to a consensus and shape policy together through dialogue, even when everyone is coming
from different perspectives, and achieve those positive impacts for the City together.
Organizationally within his Office he aspires to have short term plans where his team can see
what they are working on currently and how it will impact decisions going forward to make long
term investments. He noted that the Councillors exercise a great deal of power and influence on
the City Manager, which is applied over time, and noted how affordable housing is a great
example of that.

Member Kai Long questioned the City Manager on how much in his job description is engaging
with the public or how much within the perimeter of the job would be with the public. The City
Manager responded by sharing that it was the responsibility of the Council to hire someone who
they believed would be beneficial towards the City in all aspects, including community
engagement. He shared that when he came into the position, he had the desire of setting up
structures that have not been in place, with an example being the City Manager annual review.
He commented that he worked with the City Council to create the review, which had just been
finalized, and it offers the opportunity to achieve goal setting and feedback from the community
and other City Departments. Kai Long had a clarifying question regarding the review and was
interested in knowing if the review were something that would continue to apply once City
Manager Huang is no longer in the role of City Manager. The City Manager responded by
sharing that it could be something that becomes permanent but should be flexible as time
changes and the City evolves.
Member Lisa Peterson asked the City Manager if he was able to provide specific
recommendations that members in the Committee could think about to try and change Charter
language to accomplish more public participation. The City Manager noted that there are some
larger challenges the City is trying to solve and recognized that more public representation,
participation, and engagement is important.
Member Jennifer Gilbert offered questions around issues that are more regional and national, and
asked how, with our current form of government, where does the City stand with other cities and
towns, and how does Cambridge contribute to some of these major issues like climate change,
housing, and transportation. The City Manager offered comments, noting that it is understood
that regionally that these are issues that need to be collaborative on.
Member Patrick Magee had questions around the amount of Awaiting Reports that are on the
weekly Council Agenda and suggested that when City Councillors are elected, they try to set
their policy setting earlier in their term. Patrick Magee shared that by doing this it would help to
set the stage and allow staff to know and focus on what the two year term would look like. He
offered additional comments and asked for the City Manager’s view on a suggestion like this.
The City Manager shared that there should be a goal setting exercise between the City Council
and the City, which has been missing. He shared that this year the City and the City Councillors
will plan out what that goal setting looks like moving forward. The City Manager agreed with
Patrick Magee and believes that there is a need to be clearer about overall direction, and where
the staff time and efforts need to be focused.
Member Mina Makarious asked the City Manager from his perspective, or anything he has heard
from the City Council, on what the Charter Review Committee should be working towards to
help the Council function better as an advisory board. The City Manager noted that ultimately
the Councillors are held accountable by the voters. He shared that having a more citizen base that
are working with Councillors and paying attention to legislation could be beneficial moving
forward. The City Manager offered additional comments and noted that he enjoys working with
each Councillor and getting different perspectives from them when making decisions.

Member Jessica DeJesus Acevedo submitted questions to the City Manager and was unable to
speak during the meeting. Member Acevedo wanted to know what the City Manager’s leadership
style was, what is the most difficult part of your role, how are you ensuring policy and legislation
based on social media, and how are we supporting the BPOC and small businesses in our city to
remain in the city from your position and lens post-COVID and ARPA rollout. The City
Manager shared that he focuses on trying to assemble a good team that will focus on tackling an
issue, and he is trying to look at and build into the City a diverse group of people. The City
Manager noted that when involving groups of people, he wants to make sure they feel free to
speak and have input, and that they are listened to when they do speak.
Member Ellen Schachter had clarifying questions around decisions that come down to risk and
the ability to take risks, noting that it is critical to take risks in order to go forward, and asked
where does risk fit into the role of City Manager. The City Manager noted that there are many
risks that come with his role, sharing that there are a lot of different risks and at the end of the
day there should be an assessment of what type of risk you are taking and looking at the different
scenarios with that risk, the impact, and the reward.
The Chair, Kathleen Born thanked the City Manager for taking time to be with the Charter
Review Committee around a clearer mission for the Mayor, which is something the Charter
Review might accomplish by deciding if they go with directly electing a Mayor through rank
choice voting. The Chair, Kathleen Born asked for the City Manager’s thoughts around the
possibility of the Mayor having a different role with establishing priorities. The City Manager
noted that there is some value in having a different role for the Mayor, sharing that it could be
more attractive to voters.
Anna Corning thanked City Manager Huang for participating the Charter Review meeting and
making himself available to answer questions and be open to discussion. The City Manager
thanked all the Charter Review Committee members and thanked them for the important work
they are doing.
Anna Corning reminded members that the goal is to meet a working consensus on the form of
government topic by the end of the next meeting and asked members to submit any questions or
concerns they had around the topic to help them reach the goal of getting to a consensus.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared their concerns around the discussion about the form of
government and noted it should be thorough and thought out on how members engage in
discussion on the topic of form of government. Anna Corning suggested she can brainstorm with
The Chair and the Collins Center to help break down the questions and frame them into building
block questions that will help get to a decision in a thoughtful way.
The Chair, Kathleen Born offered her concerns around the decision of form of government and
noted she had relistened to some of the interviews and meetings that were conducted throughout
the last few months to help with her thought process.
Member Mina Makarious agreed with the Chair about her concerns. They shared that learning
about the different leadership styles has been beneficial and wants to make sure that the

Committee is conscious of the option to not make any changes to the overall form of government
in the decision making process.

Lee Farris shared that it would be nice as a user or resident that when the newsletter goes out
there would be a link that would go straight to the documents that are being described in the
newsletter, it would make it easier for the reader.
Patrick Hayes shared that he and Committee members went to a Harvard Square Business
Association meeting recently to spread the word about the Charter Review Committee.
Member Jim Stockard shared discussions he has had with community members, some of whom
voiced their concerns and noted that they were not in favor of having the option to allow older
youth to vote.
Anna Corning asked for feedback on the draft proposed timeline (Attachment E) that was sent to
Committee Members and shared that she would like to have it completed before the Special
Meeting with the City Council on March 22, 2023. She noted that the proposed timeline is a way
to set goals and have topics for future meetings.

for the Charter. Anna Corning was able to provide more detail and feedback on what the
proposed drafting language should look like as the Charter Review Committee continues to
move forward.
Member Kevin Chen had a clarifying question regarding the proposed timeline would work
around community engagement. Anna Corning shared that the way the Charter Review has been
engaging is a good way to continue, but members should think about offering public forums or
workshops that are more structured around specific topics.
Member Mina Makarious suggested that as the Charter Review moves forward with drafting new
charter language, it may be beneficial for the City Solicitor’s Office to review all of the proposed
language.
Member Jim Stockard asked for clarity on when the Charter Review Committee should be
requesting an extension from the City Council. Anna Corning noted that it’s mostly up to the
Committee if they want to continue to volunteer meeting and noted that it would be up to the
members of the Charter Review Committee to determine a proposed timeline to bring to the City
Council when asking for an extension. Anna Corning suggested that members should think about
if they are comfortable extending the timeline and could ask for the extension at the Special City
Council meeting in March.
Member Ellen Shachter suggested that the Charter Review Committee members use specific
questions to bring to the community groups to target what the Charter Review is asking for
feedback on.
Michael Ward from the Collins Center introduced the panelists that were invited to join the
Charter Review Committee meeting. They included Alex Morse, current Manager of
Provincetown and former Mayor of Holyoke, Joe Curtatone, former Mayor and Alderman of

Senator. Panelists made themselves available to answer questions and concerns of Charter
Review Committee members.
For the remainder of the meeting, Charter Review Committee members and the panelists went
into discussion about strong mayor versus strong manager, with panelists offering their personal
experiences in those roles. Charter Review members engaged with the panelists and spoke on
topics that included risks and responsibilities that come with mayor and manager, the role of city
councils in the two different forms of government, accountability, the leadership part of the
position and the type of visibility that comes with it, community engagement and goals,
limitations with community engagement specific to the type of role, the disconnect with diverse
citizens and accessibility to information, lining the community needs with the budget, the budget
process including more engagement from the Council or the community, and racial and social
representation within government,

Anna Corning began the meeting by introducing Michael Ward, Patricia Lloyd and Elizabeth
Corbo from the Collins Center who did an overview of their memo (Attachment H). After the
presentation members from the Collins Center made themselves available to Committee
members who had any questions or concerns.
Members from the Charter Review Committee went into discussion about elections and their
takeaway from the presentation made by the Election Commission from the previous meeting.
Members offered comments and suggestions, with some of the topics focused on rank choice
voting, reviewing Chapter 54A, its repeal and how it affected Cambridge, voting turnout
numbers, the possibility of having four-year and/or alternating terms for Council members, and
even and odd year elections.
Michael Ward from the Collins Center shared that there are significant challenges with even
number year elections on the same day as State and Federal elections. He noted that there are
both State law and Federal law challenges that would have to be thought through. He shared that
the Collins Center would look more into it to try and get a better understanding and provide
information as it comes.

Member Nikolas Bowie stressed the importance of the role Charter Review Committee members
have.
Anna Corning noted that she will pull some data from other cities and towns that have elections
that fall on even years to see what the voting turnout numbers are compared to odd years.
Members Jennifer Gilbert, Jessica DeJesus Acevedo, Kevin Chen, Kai Long, and Susan Shell
shared their concerns and challenges they took away from the Election Commissions
presentation. A suggestion that was made was to have more outreach with public housing to
engage and educate to get more voters out. One concern that was brought up was around ward
based elections and ward representations, and the challenges that could come with it.
The Chair, Kathleen Born shared that New York currently moved to non-citizen voting for their
School Committee, which has been successful. She also noted that some communities have been
looking into Universal Suffrage, for a larger expanded group to vote, including younger people.
She shared that it is based off the premise that federal aid and representation is built out on a
census basis, which includes non-citizens and children, who are people that should be included in
the voting process.
Member Kai Long had a clarifying question regarding the possibility of having a digital option
for elections. Elizabeth Corbo responded noting that she’s not aware of any. Michael Ward
shared it is something that the Collins Center can look in to.
Member Jim Stockard offered comments around how to make residents feel more comfortable
coming out to vote and was open to suggestions on how the Charter Review Committee could
make that possible. He also offered ideas on ballot questions that could potentially help to get
more residents out to vote.
Member Patrick Magee shared thoughts on how the community can engage with university type
cities and towns, where the turnover population is always changing, and focusing on those
specific demographics.
Anna Corning asked members to share their thoughts on the Saturday, January 24, 2023, public
forum that was held on Zoom. Member Jennifer Gilbert stressed the importance that if the
Charter Review members were going to meet with one ward, it would be important to meet with
all wards. The Chair, Kathleen Born agreed and shared that it is good to broaden the Charter
Review outreach to as many groups and community members as possible.
Member Kai Long shared that she and member Patrick Magee had interviewed former Mayor
and City Council member David Maher and offered comments on what was discussed during the
interview. Kai Long noted that she had also interviewed former City Manager Robert Healy and
urged other members of the Committee to watch the interview to get his perspective.
Anna Corning shared that she is working on a draft project timeline to help categorize and add
goals to future meetings and did a brief overview of what Committee members can look forward
to at the upcoming meetings. She asked for the members to start thinking about making a
tentative decision on form of government so the Committee can start moving forward.

Members of the Committee offered comments on Mayor versus City Manager form of
government and how moving forward the Committee could possibly look at other options
besides Mayor versus City Manager. One suggestion was looking at structures within the
executive branch and having a document that would be able to summarize the different concepts
and would be able to provide pros and cons of different forms of government.
Member Nikolas Bowie noted that having a chart or document on how Councils in
Massachusetts oversee their executives would be helpful.
Anna Corning shared that the next meeting will be held on February 28, 2023 and will include a
group of Mayors and Managers from different municipalities to speak to the Charter Review
Committee members.
Member Kai Long asked if the Committee could possibly get more information from Department
Heads or other staff on how they feel about a City Manager form of government, to get a more
honest point of view.
Meeting was adjourned at 7:35p.m.
The Charter Review Committee received seven written communications, Attachments A-G

239

Attachment: 1_23_24 Cambridge Charter Review Agenda & Meeting Materials (COF 2024 #4 : A communication was received from Anna

a

Packet Pg. 640

Goldberg, and the two most recent City Managers, Richard Rossi and Louis DePasquale, and
former Mayor and City Council Member Henrietta Davis.
Member Jim Stockard summarized the interviews he had with Arthur Goldberg, Richard Rossi,
and Louie DePasquale, who all shared they believed the City functions well with the current
government system. Some concerns that came up was having the budget process start sooner and
possibly having the City Council set a goal setting type meeting to help prepare for the budget.
Some commented that the City Manager should be appointing Department heads, while the City
Council appoints members to Boards and Commissions. One thing they were all in favor of was
having as much public engagement as possible.
Anna Corning reminded members of the upcoming public engagement forums on and that she
was trying to plan meetings with the School Committee and City Council in the future. After
updates, Anna Corning introduced David Kale, Assistant City Manager for Finance, who was
joined by his team, Michelle Kincaid, Assistant Finance Director, Taha Jennings, Budget
Director, and Angela Pierre, Deputy Budget Director.
David Kale began the Finance team’s presentation titled, “City of Cambridge Budget
Presentation” (Attachment B), pointing out that the City of Cambridge’s budget is a direct
reflection of its priorities and values as a community and is shaped by many sources of input.
Other members from the Finance team also spoke, sharing that the majority of Cambridge’s
revenue comes from real estate taxes, Massachusetts law dictate the annual budget’s high-level
timeline as well as the City Manager and the city Council’s role in the process, and the budget
process is a year-long, structured and collaborative effort by the City Council, department heads,
and the budget team.
After the Finance presentation, many members from the Charter Review Committee offered
questions and concerns about the City’s budget. Some topics that were brought up were Harvard
and MIT’s contribution to the City as nonprofit, how decisions get made about where and how
much funding goes towards a certain area, funding for schools, increasing funding towards other
City departments, statutory laws on budget, the Councils power when it comes to denying an
item on the budget, and the City’s free cash. David Kale and his team were available to respond,
noting that the budget is a tool to implement city programs and policies, it’s not always the first
step on the process of addressing an issue, other planning and steps must happen first and then
the budget makes sure the resources are available to make it happen.
The Chair, Kathleen Born recognized member Patrick Magee who made a motion to
extend the meeting fifteen minutes, the motion was seconded by member Kai Long.

The Chair, Kathleen Born opened Public Comment.
John Hawkinson highlighted comments that were made during the January 3, 2023, meeting
regarding free cash and read a paragraph from the tax rate letter regarding the FY23 budget.
Anna Corning read a Q&A that was submitted through the Zoom during the meeting from
a member of the public:
I’m still a little confused about how exactly the public is participating in the free cash
conversation. Maybe I missed it, but exactly at what meeting is public comment available to
weigh on this in particular? Is it just on the one Council meeting where the Council approves
how free cash is used in the budget to balance the budget, but not the specifics on how it’s used?
If I’m understanding correctly, there are no public meetings specifically about free cash usage,
it’s more like one small part in the budget that the council is voting on.
Members from the Finance team responded, noting that whenever the Finance team goes up to
Council for approval to use free cash that would be an opportunity for the public to weigh in.
Whenever free cash is looked to being used it must go before the Council and would be on the
Council Agenda.
Elliot Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor for the Law Department, commented on a question
member Ellen Shachter raised regarding the power of the City Council denying an item in the
budget and whether they can raise one. Due to it being a legal question that the Finance team was
unable to answer, Elliot noted that the Law Department can research this issue and bring it back
to the Committee after their review analysis.
The Chair, Kathleen born thanked Committee members and the Finance team for participating in
the meeting.
The Charter Review Committee adjourned at approximately 7:45p.m.

Member Ellen Shachter had clarifying questions about relaying the basic fundamentals of the
charter to the public, Anna Corning responded by noting she has documents that members can
use to help the public have a better understanding.
Elliot Veloso, First Assistant City Solicitor for the Law Department, commented that because the
Charter Review Committee may be starting to take official actions with scheduling community
engagement and reaching out to the public, he advises that members should be taking formal
votes because they are official acts being taken by the Committee, and by doing this there is an
official record. He advised the members that any official action that the committee is taking,
there should be a roll call vote so the Clerk can record it.
The Chair, Kathleen Born had a clarifying question about votes being taken at Planning
Subcommittee meetings. Elliot Veloso responded by noting that if there were a decision by the
Planning Subcommittee, the Subcommittee can take a vote, but that would be a vote to refer it to
the Committee as a whole.

about the discussion notes from the December 20, 2022 meeting, titled “Summary of 12/20
Round Table Discussion” (Attachment C).

the discussion notes, to which Anna Corning agreed to add.
Member Susan Shell had a clarifying question about rank choice voting. Anna Corning
responded by noting rank choice voting was not a topic that was brought up in the previous
discussion but would add it as a piece members would like to talk about.
Elizabeth Corbo, Human Resource Auditor an Employment Operations Analyst for the Edward
J. Collins, Jr. Center for Public Management, offered comments and suggestions to the members
of the Committee about the discussion notes, stressing the importance of engagement with
community by using a form of government to do that, increasing the transparency and
accountability with voters, creating a balance of authority with the legislative and executive
branches of authority, and making a change in government more accessible to voters.
Elliot Veloso advised the Chair, Kathleen Born, to entertain a motion to place the December 20,
2022 meeting notes on file.
Chair Born recognized a motion from member Jim Stockard and seconded by member
Susan Shell to add the “Summary of 12/20 Round Tanle Discussion (Attachment C) to the

Anna Corning began the meeting by reviewing the next steps for interviews and opened
discussion to members for their input.
Member Ellen Shachter shared their thoughts and concerns about interview questions, and
suggested the focus be more on engagement with the City Council and less focus on the charter.
Jim Stockard noted that he didn’t want to raise expectations for residents and that the committee
should try and be as straight forward as possible to achieve goals for the City.
Member Jennifer Gilbert had a clarifying question on the surveys and suggested if they should be
anonymous because people may be more truthful with their answers. She noted that she hoped to
interview external people who have no ties to Cambridge.
Anna Corning noted that it was a good idea to make the survey anonymous to help people feel as
comfortable as possible.
Member Susan Shell made suggestions on people the Committee could interview.
Member Max Clermont agreed with comments and questions from other members and noted that
starting public engagement and seeing how the process will go sooner is a good idea, Committee
needs to start seeing data.
Member Lisa Peterson noted that if we are expecting to have thirty minute or longer interviews,
members should limit the questions to only four or five. She also suggested that the Committee
look at current and past School Committee members. Most people will have basic opinions, but
others will have very detailed feedback. She suggested focusing on elections and voting.
Chair Born noted that she liked all the suggestions being made by members and is eager to get
started with the process. She noted that it’s ok if discussion is ongoing during the work being
done.
Member Kai Long stressed her concerns about the length of the list and questioned if the
members can organize the list so it’s helpful to the Committee.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen shared concerns about talking to people who are already in the
City government, and noted that the Committees time should be focused on those who are not
currently within the government.
Member Mina Makarious noted the interviews could be productive if the Committee asks to have
members from City Council and other boards and committees allow the Charter Review
Committee interviews to be on their agenda in order to get the feedback the Committee is
looking for and it would be an opportunity for residents to be able to listen in on multiple
occasions.
Member Lisa Peterson suggested doing smaller focus groups and noted the importance of
interviewing neighborhood groups. Noting that the Committee should look in to interviewing
executive directors to get their insight on what is working and what is not working for them as
employees.

Chair Born commented that she has spoken with the City Manager, and he is more than willing
to be interviewed.
Member Jennifer Gilbert shared concerns about acting on the community engagement and
interview plans. Jennifer also suggested having the option for Panel or individual survey to help
people being interviewed feel comfortable and whichever setting.
Member Max Clermont had clarifying questions for community outreach.
Anna Corning noted that in January there will be two public forums. The first on Tuesday,
January 24th at a Library for residents to provide comments and then the following Saturday
residents would have the opportunity to participate virtually.
Patrick Hayes Emphasize it is up to the committee to engage with the community and do the
hard work.
Anna Corning opened discussion to all members on what is working about the City Council/City
Manager form of government, what are the challenges about the City Council/City Manager
form of government and should the city form of government stay the same or change. What have
you heard is working well, what needs improvement from members of the community.
Members went into discussion about the challenges and concerns they feel as residents. Noting
that there is a disconnect between the political side of the government and professional side.
Many members commented that they were intrigued by a strong Mayor form government.
Members noted that a goal for the Charter should be to strengthen the government we already
have, and that we should have a government that focuses on helping residents and getting things
done, and that it’s slow to make change in Cambridge. There were comments made that there is
divide between the rich and the poor, and Cambridge does not have a strong middle class. Some
members suggested looking at the School Committee as an option to help with planning and
reorganizing. A big concern was voting for politicians and not seeing the outcome that was
promised.
Chair Born noted that the discussions tonight were very meaningful, and every member had
brought great suggestions and thoughts forward. She thanked members for their input.
Public Comment
John Hawkinson offered informational comments, noting that much of the assessment of the
system seem right now to depend on the new City Manager and the Council supervision of him.
Anna Corning offered members to discuss if there were any lingering questions or comments
based on the discussions of the meeting.
Chair Born suggested the Committee discuss how they would like to proceed with the next
meeting, with hopes that members can take the framework that has been provided and use it to
focus on future discussions.
Member Mosammat Faria Afreen stressed the importance of being able to explain form of
government and how the city government operates to people.

The next topic that Anna Corning introduced was to review the forms of government.
Michael Ward did a quick overview of the basic forms of government in Massachusetts, which
included examples from both City and Town governments. Noting that Cambridge uses City
form of government that has the option to use a Mayoral form (elected Mayor leads executive
branch) or Council- Manager form (appointed Manager leads executive branch). They opened it
up to the Committee, looking for what questions members had and what information members
need to know so the Committee can start moving forward.
Member Susan Shell asked if there was any general information, pros and cons, or any thought
out research that members could look at to help with decision making. Michael Ward responded
that it is something the Collins Center could provide. Anna Corning noted that they have also put
resources on the Charter Review website about charter and charter review.
Member Ellen Shachter questioned if the City Council or department heads from the city in the
Executive branches would be able to give feedback on their thoughts. They also questioned if a
survey is possible, to which Michael Ward responded noting that surveys have be done in the
past. Michael suggested that it could be possible to get a panel of Mayors, Managers, and
Councillors from other cities to hear their perspectives. Anna Corning mentioned the possibility
of getting a list of interviewees that could include previous mayors, managers, and department
heads from the City of Cambridge, to gather their thoughts and feedback.

other countries are run. They noted that they are interested in seeing the Charter create a form of
government which welcomes community participation.

besides the two presented and the importance of expanding government to look beyond the City
of Cambridge and Massachusetts.
Member Kai Long noted they liked the idea of having both a Mayor and City Council and noted
they agreed with the idea of looking at other forms of government in other countries to help
make our politics not dependent on personality versus what they are going to do if elected.
Member Max Clermont made comments on a Town Manager and town meetings, and how the
City could incorporate something similar to a town meeting in city government because of the
positive benefits.
Member Lisa Peterson questioned what the accountability should look like for Mayors and City
Managers, what form of resident involvement is best to hold them to their accountability and if
there are any additional ways accountability can be built into the system.
Michael Ward offered final comments and answered some questions that were brought to their
attention during discussion with members.

There was some clarifying conversation on when the ‘Fist-to-Five’ vote would be used. Elliot Veloso
(Cambridge Law Dept.) explained that ‘Fist-to-Five’ would be used to gauge consensus during discussions,
then when there is a final decision a roll call vote would be taken in accordance with Robert’s Rules. Ms.
Corning further clarified that this method will be used for tentative matters/gauging consensus on matters.
Ms. Corbo stated that anything requiring formal action or adoption could be decided by a formal vote. The
discussion concluded with Ms. Corning stated the wish of the committee to use ‘Fist-to-Five’ as a discussion
tool and retain the use of formal voting for procedural and formal decisions.
On a motion from Member Jim Stockard to adopt the ‘Fist-to-Five’ voting method (as amended) as
a decision-making tool. The motion was seconded by Max Clermont.

Ms. Corning next led a review of the submission of values from members. Member Mina Markarious
explained that the writing group attempted to capture sentiments that were broad and pertinent to the
group goals specifically in its initial draft.
Members discussed the draft values document. Member Acevedo explained that the writing group used
the headings from the collective key words received from members to create a concise vision statement.
She asked members if there were sentences or words that were preferred, stating that the writing group
would welcome that feedback on the draft. Ms. Corning explained that the writing team will use the
conversation to prepare a second draft of the values to be voted on in the next meeting. Member Stockard
asked if the group needed to acknowledge the statement sent by Member Susan Shell (and shared with
the committee by Ms. Corning, as Ms. Shell was absent from the meeting). Member Max Clermont stated
that Member Shell’s statements should be considered in the same manner as other submitted thoughts.
Chair Born stated her belief that there is a way to make statements about past wrongs while avoiding
raising tensions without glossing over what has happened through word crafting. Member Peterson stated
that without Member Shell in attendance, her statement should be referred to the next meeting when
Member Shell is present and can articulate her concerns.
Ms. Corning moved the discussion on to the Community Engagement Working Document. The Committee
discussed ideas for public engagement including a revised website, newsletter, virtual/in-person forums,
and mailers to support public engagement. Chair Born stated that there is a 7-member planning committee
and suggested that their first public meeting be to discuss a thought-out plan for community engagement.
PUBLIC COMMENT
Jameson Quinn commented that they are working on a piece regarding voting systems in Cambridge and
other comparable cities and asked for help accessing raw ballot data from recent elections.
The meeting was adjourned at appx 7:35pm.

The motion to place the Communications received by the Committee passed with 13 members
voting in the affirmative and 2 members recorded as absent.
Chair Born introduced Elizabeth Corbo who presented the team from the Collin Center and their follow-up
memo, the purpose of which is to align the themes and values discussed at the last meeting with the
current Charter. Ms. Corbo identified emerging themes including enfranchising and equity, and how these
tie in with the themes of participation and accessibility. Ms. Corbo stated that while some themes can’t be
addressed by the Charter, they were kept on the list. Ms. Corbo concluded the summary of the themes
compiled in the memo with a question to the Committee of whether they would like to set a value
statement where some of the emerging themes might be included. She then asked committee members
for additional themes or questions.
Member Jessica Acevedo asked about stipends, specifically where does budget funding for these come
from and who do stipends go to.
Member Ellen Schachter asked about incorporating technology and asked for clarification on how
including this would not become obsolete quickly.
Member Susan Shell asked about deliberation beyond everyone getting a voice (good decision making)
and whether the Charter has a role in changing the City’s demographics (inclusive of working and middle
class) and making it more people balanced.
Member Nikolas Bowie asked about how the committee will proceed, whether they will go through the
charter section by section or start with key concepts and answer broader questions before narrowing
down. He asked how concepts would be ordered (value statement) and what are the values that would be
agreed upon. He asked what the method of decision making will be adopted by the committee. He also

Chair Born asked about clarifying the process going forward and agreed that the committee might start
by crafting a value statement.
Anna Corning presented a voting method called ‘Fist to Five’ as a method of gauging consensus among
members to facilitate making decisions throughout the process, before making final votes.
Member Lisa Petersen asked if translation services should be required for the general operation of the
city as a part of the theme of Enfranchising and Equity.
Member Jim Stockard stated that the committee should begin the discussion about the value statement
saying that it’s both important and limited and that he would look to the Collins Center to guide the
committee through examples such as public financing of campaigning to increase diversity.
Elizabeth Corbo and Michael Ward engaged in conversation with the members, answering some of
their questions and clarifying points in the memo. Ms. Corbo concluded the discussion of the memo by
saying that once the committee decides how they want to proceed, the Collins Center will provide
discussion memos, trend data, and research to inform discussions.
Member Susan Shell asked for clarification on what the value statement was particularly for (Committee
or the preamble for the city overall). She stated that she would be uncomfortable making a value
statement for the city overall.
Ms. Corbo stated that the only value statement being discussed was pertaining to the Charter Review
Committee alone.
Chair Born recognized a motion form Member Nikolas Bowie to discuss a value statement for the
ensuing 30 minutes, with a limit of 2 minutes per member. At the request of the Chair, the Clerk
took a voice vote, all members voted in the affirmative to proceed as stated in the motion
The committee spent the next 30 minutes discussing ideas for creation of its value statement. The
committee reviewed examples of value statements from other communities including Framingham and
Somerville, with members suggesting ideas that they would like to have incorporated. Ms. Corbo guided
the group by suggesting a 2-part solution of having a value statement and separate operating principles.
Chair Born suggested that each member email values to Anna Corning and Patrick Hayes to compile and
come up with an outline of values and principles for the writing committee to begin working off. Member
Lisa Petersen stressed the importance of clarifying through the values the lens which the committee will
define as critical in looking at the Charter. Member Nikolas Bowie made a motion to invite the Collins
Center to craft a document that mirrors the City Council's division including the discussion of this and
previous meetings. Anna Corning suggested that the committee members take this up, so that it is coming
from the committee, with members Mina Markarious and Jessica Acevedo volunteering to work with the
Collins Center to prepare such a document. Elliot Veloso (Cambridge Law Dept.) reminded the committee
that there are minutes and notes to facilitate production of a committee-driven document. Member Patrick
Magee suggested a friendly amendment to Member Bowie’s motion that the volunteer members join with
the Collins Center in a call to inform the work of the Collins Center on this document.

The motion to place communications received by the Committee on file passed.
The Chair introduced Elizabeth Corbo from the Collins Center to discuss the memo of the September 9
Charter Review Committee meeting, which detailed discussion questions for this meeting. Ms. Corbo
encouraged members to share things that are working well in Cambridge and things that are not working
as well, acknowledging that not all issues can be addressed through the Charter, as it is a document
dealing primarily with governmental operations. Ms. Corbo explained that these ideas will be
incorporated into the Charter later in the process. Ms. Corbo then opened the floor for members to
share their thoughts and ideas.

The Chair took the following Communications received from the Committee to be placed on file as follows:

Packet Pg. 675

Member Faria Afreen asked questions about the City Manager in relation to the City Council, asking
how planning of the annual City budget can be more democratic, funding, and a question about adding
ranked choice to the Charter.
Member Kai Long talked about power, and the desire for more diversity as relates to finances required
to become a City Councillor. She mentioned the perceived inequity in who has the resources to
become a Councillor, the divide in the city between poor and rich (with the rich making decisions that
effect the poor), and how to make city government more about the community and less about money.
Member Mina Makarious expressed support for the previous members thoughts and spoke about the
need to balance the desire for more participation and democratic action without losing the benefits of
having a single unitary government. He expressed concern for what happens in smaller communities
when every single decision becomes a political process particularly the longstanding housing issues
becoming even more politicized and hopes to increase accountability and be nimbler.
Member Ellen Shachter stated the need for understood, value-driven guiding principles, regardless of the
form of government going forward. She wants the committee to explore the value of a ward system, how
to get feedback to the Council regarding departmental needs as relates to the budget, and
public participation and stipends for more representative committees.
Member Kevin Chen spoke about examining some of the structural issues in the City Manager
role, structure of the Council (and potential changes to consider and injecting values into the Charter
(preamble, equity lens provision).
Member Susan Shell shared concerns regarding clarity on what the committee is tasked with, stating that
changes made now must work for future demographics in the city. She stated that there appears to be a
lack of deliberation with a process where opinions can be expressed and there can be productive
conversation and a genuine, deliberative public process.
Member Jennifer Gilbert spoke about how to encourage participation, what can lead to increased voting,
and how the current form of government works in the context of increased need for regional thinking on
issues including housing and climate. She spoke about the need for a system that clarifies accountability
and decision-making and makes participation more approachable. She also asked if there is data
comparing costs to run in other cities using some of the proposed methods.
Member Lisa Peterson shared appreciation for the idea of looking at the Charter with an equity lens
how the City Manager and Council can work together more effectively, and what some barriers to that
might be. She called out the 2-year election cycle as one of the barriers to this efficiency, with a preference
for a 4-year term, to give greater opportunity for the Council to be a team, and act as a body. She also
spoke about the need for the Council to set or reaffirm goals at the start of each term for greater clarity.
Member Patrick Magee agreed with the members before him, adding his hope that the Collins Center
will return with information regarding all that has been suggested regarding pros and cons. He said that
for him, the challenges in Cambridge come down to transparency in the decisions from the City Manager,
how they align with what the Council is asking for, and the impact of strong financial management. He

Member Jim Stockard wants to understand the technological advances/increase in technological capacity
going forward, and the ability to share information as relates to facilitating productive dialogue. He
shared ideas around adjusting terms and election cycles and asked if there are ways the budget could
be used to embrace ideas such as reparations, or other powers that could be enabled to better
the
community (asking what is capable through the charter).
Member Nikolas Bowie spoke on the importance of enacting legislation that is important to the people
of Cambridge (demand more local autonomy), increased fiscal autonomy, and more democratic decisionmaking within the city. He talked about the structures lending primarily to those with time, money, and
resources and how to enfranchise the disenfranchised (including those who work here, can’t afford to live
here, etc.).
Member Jessica Acevedo talked about a strength-based approach, and her hopes for some type of
action. She
sees the working-class being pushed out of Cambridge, the direct correlation to the
affordable housing crisis here and comparing national poverty line, and the threshold affordable
housing eligibility here in Cambridge. She also spoke about the other supports needed by citizens
(education, family supports), equitable compensation/support for people’s time to participate in these
conversations and comparing Cambridge to communities farther from home (higher numbers of black
and brown citizens).
Member Ellen Schachter added that there needs to be support in taking some risks, and ways
to challenge the systems within the city that tend toward the status quo and not think out of the box.
Member Kai Long stated the perception of Cambridge and progressiveness, but how the city works
o not reflect that. She said that in thinking about the Charter, the progressiveness needs to be
reflected.
Member Susan Shell compared the Charter to being like a Constitution and wondered if it’s the place
for asserting progressiveness (as related to the purpose of the Charter). She asked that
o
think more broadly about the common ground and not get too carried away with progressive as a label.
Member Mina Makarios asked
the Collins Center and the City Solicitor ould research items
stuck in legislature such as non-citizen voting, rent control, and o
remote public meetings.
Member Faria Afreen added the need to have more information on what is possible
considering legislature constraints and interest in term limits.

a preamble stating things the city strives for, including aspirational values.

cited the example of the Somerville public meeting process as joint meetings of Council and City staff to
increase transparency.

Chair Born expressed her appreciation for the
discussion and spoke about elections and how
the cycles can hamper collaboration. She expressed concerns about proportional representation, and
the perceived impasses between the Council and the Manager (and clarity on how it works) and her
preference for stability over the ups and downs of different personalities. She reminded everyone of
recent successes in Cambridge,
city support for small businesses during COVID, including

Chair, Kathleen Born – Yes
The vote was 10 – Yes, and 5-Absent. The motion to accept the minutes from the meeting
held on September 13, 2022, passed.
The Chair gave an overview of her idea for the forming of subcommittees. The two subcommittees
described were for “Agenda Setting” and “Drafting/Writing”. The Chair clarified her goals for the
subcommittees and took a question from Member Ellen Shachter regarding the details of
subcommittees. Libby Corbo of the Collins Center answered some questions from the Chair on
their role in drafting language. Member Mina Makarious directed several questions to the City
Solicitor’s office regarding how subcommittee work relates to open meeting law. Elliot Veloso of
the City Solicitor’s office indicated that their office had concerns about the role subcommittees
could play. The Chair asked Libby Corbo how other cities across Massachusetts worked within
subcommittees and broadly the role that other city law departments played within a review
process. Libby Corbo indicated that they typically do not have much interaction with city law
departments at all during their work, but said that she had spoken on the phone with City Solicitor
Nancy Glowa who said that the City Solicitor’s Office should be involved throughout the process.
Elliot Veloso further stated his concern about the adherence to open meeting law and questioned
whether the subcommittees, as currently understood, would be feasible under the law. The Chair
and Elliot Veloso began an extended conversation about open meeting law and subcommittee
work. Lisa Peterson asked Elliot Veloso about forming less formal, non-decision making,
subcommittee groups to assist in scheduling and agenda-setting. Elliot Veloso indicated his
skepticism in the ability of the Committee to work in subcommittees without breaking the open
meeting law. Elliot Veloso then began reciting the open meeting law briefing materials from the
Massachusetts Attorney General’s website.
The Chair recognized a comment from a member of the public commenting on the subcommittee
work. Member Jennifer Gilbert asked about other ways to overcome the logistical challenges of
planning for meetings. Member Max Clermont asked about simply expanding the current planning
process to make the subcommittee less formal. Elliot Veloso again recited from the Attorney
General’s guidance on open meeting law. Member Kai Long indicated her concern about City
support for the Committee if it would be able to live up to the City Solicitor’s expectations under
the law. Other members indicated agreement with the pressures of adhering to open meeting law
without communicating outside of meeting times. Elliot Veloso indicated the law department
would need to look into the issue further. Committee staff, Patrick Hayes, indicated that the
Committee should move onto other business because of time restraints. The Chair indicated that
she preferred to come to a conclusion on the issue of subcommittee work. Libby Corbo suggested
that the discussion continue between the Chair, the law department, and the Collins Center after
the meeting, as the Committee is limited by time restraints. The Chair asked the law department
whether she could call a vote to form a subcommittee to begin agenda-setting. Elliot Veloso
indicated there were still concerns about open meeting law. The discussion continued until
approximately 6:45pm.
The Chair recognized Member Patrick Magee who made a motion to enter into the public
record the email communications from the Chair to the entire Committee from September
22, 2022 and September 29, 2022. The motion was seconded by Member Kevin Chen.

ideas as well. Members Chen, Long, Clermont, Gilbert, Acevedo, Abebe, Magee, and Peterson
indicated their thoughts on public engagement.
Members Peterson and Long, and the Chair indicated their further frustrations with the law
department’s opinion on the Committee’s agenda-setting ability. Elliot Veloso again warned
members about discussing any matters of substance outside of formal meetings. The Chair noted

Committee with its work. Elliot Veloso again recited directly from the Attorney General’s website
to assist the Committee in understanding open meeting law and their limitations.

10/23/2023 Jameson Quinn

My name is Dr. Jameson Quinn, a Cambridge resident and voter. You on the charter review
committee know me, as I’ve been attending most of your meetings, and have taken the
opportunity to give public comment many times. But I’d like to briefly reiterate my expertise
and interest in this matter.
I’ve long been interested in voting reform; for instance, I’ve spearheaded the reform to the
nomination voting system for the Hugo Awards, co-organized the British Columbia
Symposium on Proportional Representation which was influential in the design of the 2018
electoral reform referendum there. In fact, my interest in this field was a big part of what
spurred me to get a PhD in statistics.
When I talk to my fellow Cambridge voters about our voting system, I often hear two things
(assuming they even vote in municipal election years). On the one hand, they are proud of a
system that gives them a deeper and clearer voice than most ballots. On the other hand,
they find having so many candidates to rank to be too complex, a burden. Often, they feel
both of these things at once.
I believe that allowing voters to use equal rankings is a simple, feasible change that would
preserve and even strengthen that source of pride, while helping to ease that burden of
complexity. In this article, I will make that argument. But I also want you, the committee, to
understand this issue fully, so I’ll also do my best to lay out all the serious counterarguments
that might be made, and to share both the strengths and the weaknesses of the evidence
behind these arguments.
…
The Single Transferable Voting (STV) system that Cambridge uses was invented in the 19th
century. At the time, it was designed to be counted by putting ballots into piles. Thus, at each
step in the process, all candidates’ vote tallies had to be integers.
This necessity led to two compromises. First, when transferring overvotes, random votes
had to be chosen. For instance, if the quota was one thousand votes, and a candidate got
1,100, one hundred of those votes had to be chosen by some random process. Today,
experts agree that fractional transfer methods, such as the Weighted Inclusive Gregory
Method (WIGM), are fairer.
The other way that STV’s original design was compromised is that equal rankings were
forbidden. If my ballot ranks candidate A as first place, candidates B and C tied for second
place, and candidate D in third place, it will be thrown away as soon as A is eliminated. Even
if B and C are eliminated too, so that my vote unequivocally belongs with D, it will never
count for D. This is a limitation on voter freedom, and a risk of accidental loss of voting
power, that is completely unnecessary with modern counting methods.
As part of the Charter Review Committee’s work, you are now looking at Cambridge’s voting
system. From attending the meetings so far, I think it’s likely that you’ll want to allow election
officials to use the WIGM; after all, this is merely a technical change, invisible to the voters.
But allowing equal rankings would be a small but meaningful change to how voters use the
ballot, and as such, is something that you should consider as a committee, not just leave up
to election officials.
In the following, I’ll lay out arguments in favor of and against this change; followed by a
bibliography; and then an appendix with proposed statutory language.
Arguments in favor
The simplest, and most general, argument in favor is that if allowing equal rankings were the
status quo, essentially nobody would want to forbid them.
● Voters would not want to reduce their freedom to vote as they wished, or to risk
having their vote thrown away if they mis-marked it.
● I believe most politicians, both incumbents and challengers, would value the
less-divisive campaign environment fostered by equal rankings, and would not want
to gamble on the unpredictable individual effects of a change.
● Election administrators would not want to increase the risk of voting paradoxes (see
below).
But here are some more-specific arguments in favor.
1. Allowing equal rankings makes voting easier, possibly increasing
turnout / participation
The typical Cambridge city council election includes over two dozen candidates. Giving
preferences over all of these — or even several — is already a difficult voting task. This
difficulty is a hurdle for any attempt to increase turnout, and minimizing this hurdle is an
important goal.
It’s clearly easier for a voter to class these candidates into broad groups (“I like these two a
lot; these four seem fine; these three seem acceptable; and the rest I dislike”) than to put
each of them into a strict ranked order (“I know these four will get ranks 3 through 6, but
which is which? How can I find some arbitrary distinction so that I can put them in order?”).
Consider the following graph, taken from Maloy and Ward 2021, in a study of a hypothetical
cross-party Ranked Choice ballot for the 2020 Presidential primary in super-Tuesday states.
This shows the probability of “mismarked” ballots for various scenarios. The y axis runs from
a probability of .05 (5%) to .25 (25%). Note that it might be still possible to tally some
“mismarked” ballots in some cases, but that any “mismarking” they were looking at carries
some risk that the voter will be unintentionally disenfranchised.
Unlike the hypothetical single-winner election Maloy and Ward studied, Cambridge’s STV
system is multi-winner. But currently, the basic ballot format and rules for the voter are
similar to the “Rank Ballot” option above. If equal rankings were allowed, that would bring it
closer to the “Grade Ballot” option. In their experiment, such a change would substantially
reduce the risk of a mismarked ballot — which could leave the voter effectively
disenfranchised.
Furthermore, the Cambridge ballot typically has dozens of candidates. The experiment
above shows that even moving just from 6 to 8 candidates increases the downside of a pure
ranked ballot, and thus the relative advantage of a graded ballot that allows equal rankings.
This experiment can not directly be generalized to the Cambridge case. But I believe it does
show that the complexity of a voting system can be a serious problem, and that allowing
equal rankings could ease that problem.
2. Simplifying voting could particularly help underrepresented groups
Consider the following quote from Neely and McDaniel 2015, in a study of voting patterns in
San Francisco’s single-winner Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) system:
“Consistently, precincts where more African-Americans reside are more likely to
collect overvoted, voided ballots. And this often occurs where more Latino, elderly,
foreign-born, and less wealthy folks live. The additional years of data show no
meaningful increase or decline in these tendencies but rather bolster the earlier
study’s findings.” (Neely and McDaniel, 2015, p. 21)
As with the experimental study above, this observational study shows that a ranked system
which disallows equal rankings, comes with risks of mismarked ballots that could
disenfranchise voters. In this case, the voters thus disenfranchised would come
disproportionately from certain groups, in many cases ones that are already disadvantaged
in our political system.
(I believe these findings are relevant and convincing, but I am nevertheless obligated to
share certain caveats. First off, they are based on ecological regression, and thus rely on
unverifiable assumptions to impute from precinct-level variation to individual-level variation.
Second, “African-Americans” are not a monolithic group, and a finding in San Francisco may
not apply to Cambridge. Third, this same paper found similar issues with a “vote for up to
four” race that did not require strict rankings; though an equal-rankings-allowed ballot is
harder to spoil than “vote for up to four”, this suggests that simply moving away from strict
rankings is not necessarily enough to fix the problem. And fourth, the overall magnitude of
the effect, while enough to swing a close election, is not huge. For instance, extrapolating
their results to a precinct with 100% over-65 voters would give up to around 9% excess
spoiled ballots, while a precinct with 100% African-American voters would give 4% excess
spoiled ballots.)
Allowing equal rankings could lead to healthier campaigns
By disallowing equal rankings, the current system forces all voters to pick favorites at every
step. That forces candidates to campaign almost exclusively for first-choice votes. Voting
slates and cooperative campaigns such as A Better Cambridge do exist, but candidates are
pushed to set themselves apart more than they are to stand together.
Allowing equal rankings would moderate these incentives. I believe it would lead to less
negativity and more cooperation in campaigning. I do not pretend that it’s a panacea; politics
will always be politics. But improving the incentives can still make an important difference.
And such more-cooperative campaigns could also be more issue-based, giving voters more
a real choices of direction for the city; and less-expensive, allowing for more diversity of
candidates.
And such an improvement would not have end after campaign season. Candidates who
campaign together more-cooperatively might also govern so once they are elected.
More-robust representation of Cambridge’s diversity
From a voter’s perspective, allowing equal rankings makes it easier to seek both descriptive
and ideological representation. If there is more than one candidate from the group and/or
with the platform you want to see represented, you can vote for all of them as #1, or choose
your favorite and then vote the rest as #2.
And an equal-rankings-allowed STV tallying process would do better at respecting those
joint votes. Without equal rankings, there is an increased possibility that the candidate who
could best represent you is eliminated before your vote transfers to them, meaning your
support for them has no impact on the process. If that happens to enough voters, it could be
that the eliminated candidate actually could have won. This kind of premature elimination
can lead to voting paradoxes, such as the “participation paradox”, where a voter could get an
outcome they like more by not voting at all than by voting their true preferences.
Allowing equal rankings reduces this chance, because as long as there is more than one
surviving candidate at your current top rank your vote is divided equally between them

Be more transparent! Don't publish documents on your website that talk about strenuous guidelines for ARPA
program selections, but then make it difficult to find the actual program accountability structure. Don't share federal
ARPA documentation on your webpage, if City approved programs and/or employees have no intention of upholding
Federal guidance. Similarly, don't train City professionals to talk about City resources and then allow/tell them to not
connect residents to those services. There is so much talk about tenants rights here. Be specific about how the City

Community organizing including regular free, outdoor events. Listening to all voices, not just those with the most
power, influence or money.

Trust elected officials to actually represent citizens. Participatory budgeting and online input are great for small-scale
things like park improvements, but in a city of 118,000, there is no substitute for effective representation. Not
everything requires community input (why do we have to hold community meetings for minor zoning petitions?), but
engaging public events where people have the chance to talk face-to-face with their representatives are a great way to
make sure that officials get to hear from a cross-section of the city, not just the people with the time to make calls and

We have a lot of community input processes that disproportionately favor an unrepresentative slice of the city that is
privileged enough to have time to attend meetings. We should rely less on that and more on processes that have
controls to ensure they're representative like scientifically valid surveys or sortition. Additionally, elected officials
ran on a platform and got votes and that should count as representative community input in a stronger way than who
showed up to a meeting on a weeknight and they should have more leeway execute on that platform without needing
to constantly go back to the community.
I think there's an opportunity to open up committee and commission roles more often and more broadly. I feel like
every time I go look, there's never an opening on one I'm interested in or qualified to join.

Walk the walk when it comes to transparency and accountability instead of postering and passing the buck. The most
egregious example of this is the Cambridge Police still refusing to release the names of the officers involved in
shooting and killing Faisal. I can not respect my local government when they actively conspire to obstruct justice and

This is a tough question. Since most of us are busy living, we have little time to keep tabs on the early stages of city
proposals and developments. Consequently, I think most of us are in "react" mode when it comes to City proposals
and programs.The City does a good job with its daily email newsletter. Perhaps the Council could issue something
like that in the week following its meeting, to include an *objective* synopsis of what was discussed and what the
outcomes were. That might help us to know earlier what's being considered or proposed.Generally, improving and
modernizing the City website would help, including a more intuitive user experience. For example, in my experience,
trying to search on most things returns old or mostly irrelevant results, and doesn't seem to source all of the
information that the site holds (e.g., searching on a Council proposal number never seems to work).Although not a

I have found in my community, that people often accept that nobody cares about their opinion, that organizations
(companies, usually) don’t change because of feedback. Unless genuinely and directly prompted to give feedback,
they don’t offer it. Surveys like this are a great way to get it, people just need to find out about it without having to be
in the circle of politically active lobbyists. Mailings may be wasteful, but they work, and when it’s this important, it’s
worth it. Posters, ads online? I think people care a lot about Cambridge, they just don’t know if anyone would listen

The city already does a great job when they wish to. BEUDO was a great example of an incredibly poor outreach.
The council seems to be somewhat arbitrary about when process is necessary and CDD is too lacking in opinion and
direction to be taken seriously or lead. There aught to be a better flow chart of how process in the city should work
and make it the responsibility of citizens to engage or not.

Meet people where they are: not everyone can participate in community meetings or City Council meetings becuase
of childcare issues, not being able to miss work, speaking a language other than English, etc. Also, not everyone feels
like their voice is valued, since they don't see change come from sharing their opinion. Furthermore, some people feel
alienated at community meetings/hearings (for example, at meetings about the AHO amendments, there was a lot of
negative sentiments being spread about people who live in public housing). The city can work on engaging with
people where they live, where they work, and where they spend their leisure time (in parks, housing developments,
community centers, social service organizations, food pantries etc.). People need more civics education, education

City Council is basically an advisory board, and elected through a confusing process. Most of the literature calls this
'proportional representation', but that would suggest that voters would be allowed to choose a platform with a slate of
candidates, rather than ranking candidates with (often very similar) platforms from a nonpartisan list. I would rather
see a true proportional representation where candidates affiliate with a platform. Plenty of municipalities use this
system successfully, because it allows voters to choose candidates based on local priorities, rather than trying to learn
about all 22 (in last year's election) candidates, and somehow rank them. I don't believe that the council-manager
form of government is right for Cambridge. I'd like to see an executive that is accountable to citizens, and an election

Really not a fan of the weak mayoral system. The City Manager position seems too powerful to be this far removed
from voters and without enough checks and balances. I'm a Cambridge native and am in strong favor of restructuring
the management of our city to eliminate this position and be under the control of a Mayor directly elected by, and
directly accountable to, us, the residents.
Create districts with councillors assigned to represent that district.

The current Council/Manager structure works well, particularly since we have had effective Managers who have paid
attention to the long-term financial health of the city.The two-year term for Councillors means that the Council makeup changes frequently. So though there is relative consistency over multiple terms, single-issue groups are able to
disproportionately influence and staff the Council.For these reasons, and because the Manager typically serves over
many election cycles, we benefit from a pragmatic, middle-of-the-road Manager who can keep her/his eye on the
overall picture and trends, and can temper some of the more aggressive initiatives while advancing City and Council
objectives. To put it another way, we need the Manager to be a voice of reason, balancing desires and goals with
practical realities and the overall health of the city.I believe that the City has been fortunate in this regard over at least

<0.002% of residents answered this survey. With each city newsletter, provide a mail in survey (no stamp required)
asking residents about their view. Be inclusive and provide the questions/answers in different languages, and allow
write-in answers. No deadline, provide a questionnaire with each newsletter. The City Council can best represent
Residents if they understand their problems and perspectives.

Prior to the Healy administration council positions were part time. We should return to this. Further the position of
council aide never existed and doesn't need to exist. They are not regulated by the charter and thus act as proxies for
activities that would otherwise be illegal for councilors to participate in. The charter review itself is promulgated by
Patrick Barrett an aggressive few councilors who see their positions more akin to state legislators than a board of directors.
Yes. Elected officials do not have enough power and responsibility in the present form. Over the years, they have
allowed the City Manager to operate almost entirely without oversight, creating the situation where he (and it has
Pete X
always been he) can often ignore requests from the council.
Sam Bosbach
More oversight over the unelected City Manager.
Ideally a strong mayor system and not a city manager. This makes it difficult for residents to feel involved in
government process in Cambridge because it's run like a business and not a democratic process. Additionally City
Sergio Coronado Council elections at large also contribute to this, the City council should be elected via neighborhood representation

Cambridge residents are experiencing harm and homelessness resulting from limited action from City professional
when landlords decide to actively discriminate against tenants who have been awarded ARPA Eviction Prevention
and/or COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Funds by refusing to provide the information necessary to receive funds in
favor of evicting these Cambridge residents. I was told by City professionals that there were many people having
similar experiences. Yet I was told by the person in the City Hall finance department, that they had never heard that
landlords were refusing to take the steps to receive funds. I asked them where is the document that explains what
should happen if a landlord refuses to take the funds. They said that such a document does not exist. MAKE THAT
DOCUMENT EXSIST!!! Or be honest with your residents about not actually being concerned with their well-being
and having somewhere to live in hard times.

Traffic flow and safety has become a mess, especially in North Cambridge. Please have an impartial study of such

I strongly feel that the electoral system in Cambridge is outdated, and an equal mix of proportionally elected at-large
seats (elected from issues-based slates) and local members would yield better results. That way, you know who to
contact when something in your neighborhood needs to be fixed, but there are also people on the council with a

mandate from the whole city, to ensure that the big picture doesn't get ignored.

I strongly support keeping our existing proportional representation system and hope we don't move to wards. PR
ensures every election is competitive & almost every voter has an elected councilor they voted for as one of their top
preferences. The current system allows councilors to get most of their votes from one geographical area and we can
see that usually doesn't happen so it doesn't make sense to impose wards when voters don't seem to see geography of
the city as a primary issue. Ward based councilors would likely focus more on protecting the area they represent at
the expense of focusing on citywide needs.
I also think there needs to be more advanced notice and mechanisms for feedback (and then responding too and
hopefully actually incorporating) from residents before implementing polices and budgets.

Cambridge has a very vocal, highly visible, very progressive cohort, which is well-represented on the City Council.
But despite their thinking so, that cohort does not represent the entire spectrum of city residents, and may not actually
even represent the majority of the citizenry beyond the core that votes in city elections.Many of the progressive
policies and ideas are laudable, but the vigorous pursuit of them is very often not clearly thought-through. The result
is that unintended consequences seem to frequently crop up as these policies are implemented. It is also not unusual
for proponents to dismiss or disregard known downsides of some substantial initiatives because of their view that the
ends justify any means.It would be really great if we can figure out a way to get more people to vote. I think two
main reasons that people don't vote are that they don't think they know enough about the candidates and issues to vote
James Mahoney intelligently, and that they don't think their vote will matter.
Keep a strong city manager form of governance. It provides better fiscal accountability. Do away with PR voting.
Move to district-elected councilors and at large councilors. We don't need fully staffed full-time councilors in a city
our size, a very costly and unnecessary expense should be a stipend only.
JOHN REARDON
Given the vast diversity in our community and our poor voter turnout having a city manager provides a good check
and balance to the power of the Council. I also have come to appreciate the PR system of voting, but would like to
Kelly Dolan
see much more education to constituents for how it works.
Cambridge is already one the most densely populated cities in the country, trying to add tens of thousands of more
residents before we are even able to keep up the current infrastructure is a mistake. Our environment is greatly
suffering and the livability of the city is diminishing. Perhaps we cannot solve the national housing crisis on our
own? Over-development and expanding universities/colleges are causing the crunch, turns out not everyone who
lc
wants to live here can, and those with the most $ seem to win out, forcing out many long-term residents.
The city is profligate in its spending of taxpayer money and beholden to ideological interests rather than the people
who live in its neighborhoods. It’s truly amazing to see how the city spends money to needlessly change

Think of your number one concern in Cambridge, what is it? What do you think is stopping Cambridge from addressing this
Landlords discriminating (Chapter 151B section 4 subsection 10) against tenants who have been awarded Cambridge
ARPA Eviction Prevention Program and/or Cambridge COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program, by refusing to
complete documents necessary to receive the award funds for the resident. Lack of accountability and oversight on
ARPA funded programs approved by the City Council/City Manager, has left City professionals without alternative
means of supporting residents who have already been approved for housing support. As a result, Cambridge residents
are being unjustly sent to housing court for eviction AFTER being notified about steps to receive award funding,

I don't think Cambridge can really address this on its own.
We need to allow for higher dense housing to be built in the city. Mix used buildings that include residential and are
not only research/office towers. Makes no sense to only build commercial/office when we have a high demand for
more affordable housing. We need to build taller structures in the city to accommodate the housing demand the city is
facing. It's ludicrous that the average rent in Cambridge is at $3000 a month. The primary obstacle to addressing it is
Jun 14, 2023 Daniel Arredondothe lack of clear policy that the city is putting forward.

Sustainability. The climate crisis working group report has the answers. But also, Cambridge must address the rich
businesses that fight progress (see: Harvard claiming reducing emissions for BEUDO is impossible, as if they can’t
generate or store any energy). Eversource and the MBTA are dangerously sub-par and they make sustainability
difficult. We the people don’t have the power to fight them, so we need your help. Equality, cost of living, housing,
addiction, mental illness, lack of community and resources, are all factors that impact sustainability, which makes
people question how to prioritize. The answer comes in the only clear villain—excessive profit. When we fight big
business, we can protect our rights and quality of life. When we reflect on how Cambridge can improve, I’d naturally
question how we can align action better with belief. Everyone in our city council, if not the whole city government,
knows the threat of climate change and wants us to be more sustainable, but belief isn’t enough to make change.
Actions from our fearless leaders led to the BEUDO amendments, an incredible victory that will make Cambridge a
leader in sustainability. Actions like creating a fund to retrofit homes and apartments funded by businesses trying to
offset emissions. Actions like ensuring diversity of electricity sources to avoid the Eversource local monopoly.
Actions like banning Target’s greenwashed thick plastic bags or protecting bike lanes. I can’t wait for more

Housing affordability is certainly a big issue, but I don’t think that our City Council can do much to effectively

Lack of affordable housing for non-student workers earning less than $200,000. Lack of availability of medical
doctors, especially primary care but also specialists. I am not aware of initiatives to address either.
Increasing drug activity and violent crime.Cambridge police lack basic equipment like body cams and vehicle video
surveillance, and do not have a narcotics unit.
Crime in Central Sq, Weak School system, and lack of follow through on planning. The council largely gets in the
way of any progress in large part due to fickle interest and lack of fundamental understanding of the subject matter.
It's easier to move on or just throw money at a problem than trying to manage it better or act.
Not enough housing

Housing costs. Cambridge desperately needs more housing (as does the whole region). Folks need to stop fearing
change of character and realize that the character will be gone if no one can afford to live here but the rich.
Livability is a huge concern. We are city with ample resources and yet lack affordable housing for all walks of life. I

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, all his life.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Councilor, Vice Mayor and Mayor (15 years total). Then elected to the state senate.
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
The dynamic of getting the city manager to pay attention to his priorities. Requires relationship, seniority,
and political relationships.
A mayor saw more specifics with plan e. Lawsuits at the school level, race, and class and always below
the surface in Cambridge.
Saw the mayor's role as the mediator, when there were major issues and dynamics to navigate it was a
good role for the mayor to step into rather than the manager.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
The biggest frustration is the lack of populism. I made a point to get votes across the city, and didn't want
to be viewed as someone that only had a certain constituency.
Leadership as mayor among other councilors who don’t necessarily always want you to lead initiatives
because they have to run against you. A different dynamic with the school committee who isn’t running
against you could be more of a leader.
What if no mayor?
● There are multiple different perspectives of the mayor's role. I see it as a mediator role, and I don't
think the city would benefit from not having a mayor.
● But I think we could benefit from a bit of a job description for the role because everyone sees it
differently. You need a political leader in the city.
Separately elected mayor?
● Do you have to look at it from what is the best long-term process for the city? What I would
worry about, is the long term, what if 6 councilors announce they are running for mayor and then
maybe lose a huge portion of the councilors
● If you have a separately elected mayor maybe impose a term limit
Other:
● I think part of the goal I’m hearing is increasing engagement and democracy - and I don’t think a
strong mayor or longer term for council necessarily would increase voter engagement

I don’t agree that the city council inherently doesn’t have power, it's built on whether there is an
incentive to work together or not.
People/ residents will often say more democracy, if you pose the question to them about a
separate election for mayor many would say yes
I think this charter review was more of a power grab than a desire for more democracy

Budget - do you think the council has enough weight on the manager's budget?
● The budget is central to the government. There should be a strategy around the budget ongoing
constantly. But I do think there is a need for more engaging ways for the public to participate in
the budget process outside of public comment.
● I do think the council has significant power in the current budget process if they work together.
Engagement
● We are lacking productive and inclusive engagement.
● We don’t inform the public - how do we inform people? It’s very easy to stack a public meeting,
but there are ways to bring individuals from different perspectives together to have a
conversation.
We should be thinking about what is going to continue to attract strong candidates for the city manager
position if we were worried about that position and the well of candidates that would fill that type of role.
If we are worried about that, then I might be more in favor of a strong mayor. However, the recent city
manager process proves there is a good talent pool and the selection and process supports the strong
Manager form of government so there is no need to look to a strong Mayor

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
No.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to the City government?
Now retired, I spent about 30 years in the law department, started as an assistant city solicitor, first
assistant solicitor, and then moved to deputy city solicitor for 8 years.
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
Acting Chair of Licensing Commission - 5 months.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you to do
your office to do its job well?
● During my time in the solicitor's office the number of attorneys grew from 6 to about 11 full time
attorneys. The growth was a result of an increase in demands of the city council, keeping up with
new initiatives, representing the city in litigation, advising boards/councils, and drafting
ordinances.
● Part of the solicitor’s office role is to interpret the city charter, when there are questions about
provisions in the charter they come to the law department whether informally or formal opinions.
● I worked under Bob Healy, Rich Rossi and Louis DePasquale. What was interesting was how
each manager interpreted their powers. Healy interpreted a bit more conservatively in terms of
their responsibility over city department heads. In the charter city councilors are not supposed to
deal directly with employees of the city manager outside of public meetings, and Healy protected
his employees very conservatively. Didn’t want city employees talking directly to city councilors,
managed everything through him. I thought this was a good separation of powers because it
protects employees and allows them to do their job within a clear administrative hierarchy.
● As Richie and then Louis moved into the city manager role they were more liberal in
allowing councilors to interact directly with city employees. Perhaps some public thought was
that Healy was too rigid with his interpretation. Under Richie councilors started meeting in
private more directly with employees about policy initiatives. Louie might have encouraged even
more. I think this dynamic can create a complicated situation for city employees.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
With any structure you are relying on good people who are willing to collaborate in those roles to make it
function well. Any form will have abuses and push limits of powers, and some people might not want to
cooperate, if that's the kind of person they are.
6. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Personalities are always at play but not structural issues.
7. Some of the items that the Charter can impact are issues such as terms for elected officers,
department head and committee appointment authority, structure of and allocation of

323

Packet Pg. 724

authority in City government, budget process, elections and voting. Do you have any
additional thoughts you would like to share regarding those issues?
Budget process - we’ve heard that that process could be more transparent and open to the public?
● I think the managers feel they were appointed because of their financial expertise and their
department heads know their departments best. Opening it up more to council and public has the
potential to politicize the process and perhaps make it hard to make objective decisions based on
an informed understanding of all the considerations involved in putting a complex overall city
budget together. I understand frustration from CC and the public: the manager spends months
putting together the budget, and when it comes to the council, they have limited time to ask
questions, and minimal resources to review and analyze. There could be more flexibility along the
way, it seems like now the council is giving the manager priorities and the manager is funding
their priorities.
8. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Informational Charter Elements:
● Charter Right - Process written into the council rules but comes from MGLA (Chapter 43,
Section 22 of the General Laws.).
● The current charter requires a city council vote on an expenditure of fifty dollars or more, which
probably should be changed/ reflective of inflation.
● The charter states the council will set the manager’s salary by ordinance, which isn’t done
anymore, it's defined in the contract
● Make charter language gender neutral
● Repealed MGLA Chapter 54A still applies to Cambridge proportional representation (“PR”)
voting in local elections
Current Provisions
“mayor could take control of the police if there is a vote of the council”
● This hasn't happened. And since the manager appoints/oversees the police, not sure it really
makes sense. It should be the manager.
“the right to public comment”
● Says all meetings of city council should provide opportunity for the public to be heard. I don't
think this needs to change but under OML there isn’t a right to public comment. So if you did
away with this public comment right in the charter, the Council wouldn’t have to allow public
comment in the same manner that it’s done now.
Number of Councilors
● No real opinion, doesn’t feel the number is super critical
Ward vs At-Large Councilors
● No real opinion - I know the general idea behind ward councilors - to represent specific parts of
the city. I think with PR in Cambridge, actually does empower minorities in certain areas - tim
toomey (east Cambridge) - if you have a certain minimum votes under PR, in a way for a specific
area to have a representative.
Elections on even years?
● The elections commission might have concerns about moving elections to even years. Would it
impact the PR?
Current process how councilors choose mayor - seems time consuming, done behind the scenes?

Probably not the best way to choose a mayor, could move to a popular vote. The other thing is
that councilors should be careful to comply with the OML, so that a quorum is not deliberating
outside of public meetings to determine who the mayor will be.
Free cash - Why isn’t it subject to budget planning in the same way?
● Not sure why it couldn't be discussed in advance, although free cash is typically addressing an
urgent need that might arise at any time during the year. But there is so much of it and some is
planned.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
No
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Manager for 32 years, deputy city manager prior to that - 39 total in Cambridge.
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
Deputy city manager
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
Allows for the manager to manage and for the elected city council to do policy/ legislation.
The basic foundation of any city is finance, if you don't have fiscal stability you can’t do all the programs
that you’d want.
Managing the city as a business with residents as the customers.
Thinks the system works well and has been stable over most of the 80 years of the charter.
How do priorities like municipal broadband get funded or not funded? How do those decisions get made
and what are the inputs?
● Cost / Benefit analysis - initial financial cost and long-term maintenance cost
● If the council / public mandate something the manager has to comply the manager reports to the
council and the council can always fire the manager.
All the various elements of the city and the organizations are a sort of extension of the city and help
provide the eyes and ears to the community.
How does information/ feedback flow to manager? Is it just through the city council?
● No, the manager also listens and hears directly from the public, the manager shouldn’t isolate
themselves
District vs At-Large Councilors
● PR works with Plan E, and I think the number of councilors is appropriate
● I don’t think a district councilor would be beneficial for the city as a whole, focused too much on
individual issues.
Elections
● I think RCV works well, if it's working well why try to break it
Mayor’s Role
● Important role on the School Committee
● The mayor is the political role of the city and needs to be out there and doing more than other
councilors
● City Council can declare a state of emergency and put Mayor in charge.

1. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
School Committee - 1991-1998,
City Council - 1999-2018
Mayor - 2010–2011 & 2014–2015
2. Have you held other positions with the city?
Currently - CEO and President of the Chamber of Commerce
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
I always felt like the plan E form of government was good. But more recently I wonder if we might be
outgrowing that form.
The current feeling feels like weekly whiplash, and I believe that is coming from the council. And part of
that is coming from not having defined goals and objectives. Which leads to a clouding of what the
council is and supposed to be.
Feels disjointed right now, doesn’t necessarily mean we need to throw it out.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
Lack of goals/objectives.
At the state level there is a very defined legislative process, but on the local level ideas and legislation are
all over the place.
There needs to be more leadership among themselves to not take on everything, and leave to the staff a
number of items they are capable of handling.
Staff should be more willing to share their expertise but they feel hesitant to do so because they often get
undermined by the council
5. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Worked with three different managers, and saw the change in their management styles.
I think the role of elected officials has morphed less of oversight to more interfering in day-to-day
operations.
● The council hasn’t done a good job of defining objectives and holding themselves to it
6. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Four-year terms for councilors?
● No, the council should be as close to the public as possible. Even though it might benefit the
councilors.
District Councilors?

●

I’d be worried about that change. We somewhat have them already in how the council builds its
base of voters. I think we are a small enough city that we can do this without breaking up the city
into districts.

City Council over time?
● Early on the council was much more collegial, we worked together. It wasn’t about what I wanted
or other councilors wanted but about finding common ground.
● The council now is much more in silos and they aren’t collaborating together
● Should be thinking about the council as a board/supervisors with the mayor as the chair.
○ When hiring a manager there should be clear goals and priorities that the manager can be
deemed successful against. But the council is lacking that right now.
● There is a lack of accountability/transparency. There should be x committee meetings
At the state level there is a defined legislative process:
● Filing deadline (all bills for the term need to be put forward), review period (in committee
hashing items out, public meetings), then referred from committee to full leg and vote.
○ A big issue might take a year, but it allows a full airing out of policies/initiatives.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, went to MIT for undergrad and has lived in Cambridge since then for 53 years.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Councilor for 10 years in 80s.
Other positions: lawyer in state government, elections division, state ethics commission, counsel for
senate ways and means, counsel for administration and finance, chief policy advisor for state senate
president.
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
Cambridge overall has a pretty successful structure and is a well-run city. Large universities, a magnet for
intelligent/successful people, transformation of Kendall square, ability to build a strong tax base,
competent civil servants.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
I like the City Council structure, don’t think it needs to change. Representative of different points of view,
ideologies, and areas of the city. The various points of view have been well represented across major issue
areas like rent control, and affordable housing. I do not favor any form of district representation, I know it
does work in some structures and without PR it’s helpful in increasing representation. PR does a great job
of accomplishing various forms of representation, you could vote for your neighborhood rep or vote based
on a larger city-wide issue, but it is left up to the voters.
Executive leadership: I think a strong mayor form of government should be strongly considered. City
Manager does a great job with efficiency, fiscal responsibility, and day-day ops, it is not as good at
changing policy. Because the city manager isn’t supposed to get involved/advocate for specific policies.
The city manager contract clause, where if the city council wants to discharge a manager they have to pay
a huge amount, which is a big disincentive for the city council. And as a result, they never discharge a
manager.
If you are trying to change a policy, it is really hard to get done without executive leadership. A Managers
teams can provide information/technical assistance but is not involved in the politics in the way an elected
mayor can be
At the state level without the governor, it would be impossible for the legislature to get stuff done. The
executive can provide political pressure necessary to get votes.
Priorities with an elected strong mayor:
● Democracy, which is hard with a city manager
● Candidate can run on a policy-related platform and can execute on it

Maybe a hybrid system with a strong mayor, with a COO hired by the mayor maybe confirmed by the
council. Could help with maintaining a strong administration.
How might stability be affected by an elected mayor that might change every 2/4 years?
● Definitely a concern, pros, and cons of all systems. Balance is the key. The nature of democracy
is that voters get to change things, including their leadership. And although stability is good for
the structure of the city, should for example one person be in a specific department head role for
10, 20 years? The balance should lean more in the direction of democratic accountability and
change when necessary, rather than towards stability.
You mentioned maybe having city council approve a coo position under a strong mayor?
● For balance, it would be good, but the potential downside is if the council doesn’t want to
approve someone. The mayor should be able to hire someone they trust and can work with. Risk
for abuse.
Sticking with Manager / Council form - what could be changed?
● Wouldn’t favor changes to the current council structure/term/size.
● Remove buy out clause in the manager contract
● Maybe modify the charter to allow manager/staff to get more involved in policy
● Is there any other remedy or recourse with the manager to hold accountable that isn’t firing?
○ No, there really isn’t
How do you see the strength of employees under a manager vs an elected mayor?
● Yes, exceptional employees with stable jobs is an obvious advantage to a citymanager. But there
are a lot of examples of exceptional employees working for elected officials at the local and state
level.
Would a change to mayor change Cambridge’s position in state politics?
● I think it could strengthen Cambridge’s role. An elected person would empower the executive for
Cambridge in relation to neighbors.
Budget Process - how might be improved?
● It is already starting to happen, the current manager is deliberately encouraging councilors to
bring ideas about the budget forward. Maybe creating a more formalized process? Implement
hearings earlier in the process to hear input.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, since just after college.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to the City government?
Left following 2 years as Mayor, before that 14 years as City Councilor, and 8 years on the
School Committee
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you to do
your office to do its job well?
There are a lot of strengths in the current form. I really care about getting policy through and
implemented. Having a good relationship with a professional staff, made a significant difference. Lots of
opinions about what to do, and helpful to see what the professionals are doing. I relied on them for their
expertise. I could do my part as Mayor to get policy through the council. I think about 3 aspects of
government the people, politicians and professionals to get things done. Helpful to think about the city in
this way and know my role.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
Not a lot of challenges with the structure. I know there is a perception around how to get popular ideas
implemented, for example broadband, I wanted to see that implemented across the city. But it hit a wall in
the manager's office, because they explained the actual cost and obstacles to getting it implemented.
NLC involvement, so I could see how things were being done in other communities. And understood
there were other communities struggling to get issues through, there are genuine obstacles to policy
initiatives.
In Cambridge, because of professional management, once we are able to work through a policy initiative
or idea, the implementation is very effective and sticks and continues to improve over time.
● Ex climate initiatives - started little by little bringing colleagues along and other parts of
government. And now a leading city in climate
● When redoing high school Manager didn't want to pay extra dollars to have an effective cafeteria
which would have an impact on the quality of food, and between the councilors, staff and public
engagement they did end up implementing it.
○ Manager maybe didn’t want to recommend the cafeteria but he said if there are at least 5
votes that's what I have to do, but an individual councilor can’t direct this. So requires
the council to coalesce around an issue or policy.

City Council Goal Setting
● During her tenure, they were doing the goal setting every other year. And it was a great
mechanism to reflect back on, because they were in agreement on what their goals were.
5. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Council Relationships
● No one person on the council could do anything, so the only way to get things done was with
majority/supermajority. Needed to create coalitions around issues, in order to move forward. I
sought support from the staff - did they buy in around an idea, was it possible?
● Elections of mayor is a starting point for coalitions. Building an idea of who you could look to for
support on ideas. .
6. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Issue around schools
● Some city councilors feel they should be able to medal in the school committee and their budget.
I want as a citizen to make sure your committee knows that is an important separation of powers
because the school committee knows best for the school system.
Running for Office / How do we get more inclusive in this system?
● It's very different now, than when she ran because they had a local newspaper and capacity for
anyone to find out what was going on in the city for free or not a lot of money. With a lack of a
local newspaper it can be difficult to figure out what is happening in the city.
● Concerned about how anyone can vote for anything, when all information needs to be sought out
online.
● I think district councilors could help fill that void.
● Always a supporter of at-large PR, good for the city, and coalesced ideas that were important all
around.. But local representation like a district councilor, a point of connection. I’m not sure if
at-large government works as well as it used to.
○ Example in Outer Cape - there is the providence town independent, you know everything
that is going on in the outer cape. Why is a building like x, what's the housing policy,
who is blocking it.
○ Maybe district government is a solution, could serve people better because someone is
accountable in your neighborhood. - ex tim toomey (east cambridge)
○ A lot of councilors come from west campaign because maybe that's where there is $$
● State Representative Race - I know very little about him as a candidate and campaign.
Term length / term limits
● I like the idea of running every two years for the state rep/senators, at least I get to see this
person every two years, and have a concept of who they are.
● 4 years might be good / better if there were district councilors
● Definitely would need more research to figure out how it really works, who’s voting, who’s not
voting, who feels like they know what’s happening
● Look at the public, instead of the person running for the office - what makes for the best
representation

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
No
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
Superintendent of Schools 2009 - 2016
Had over 20 years of superintendent experience prior to being hired in Cambridge. Superintendent in
Cambridge from 2009 - 2016. Came from 11 years as superintendent in Newton. And Lexington and
Lynnfield prior to that.
3. What else do you want us to know?
School Committee
● Surprised about the way school committee members ran every two years but were all at-large. His
prior experience with Newton had a much different composition. Newton has 8 wards; there was
1 school committee member from each ward. All members were elected city wide but only ran
against others from their same ward.
○ Charter Text: “Eight of these members, who shall be known as school committee
members, shall be nominated and elected by the voters at large, 1 school committee
member to be elected from each of the 8 wards of the city”
● His perception of the way Newton’s school committee was structured was once the committee
was seated, the incentive was to collaborate because you’d never be running against the other
members on the committee.
● Members running against each other in Cambridge created a different culture on the school
committee.
● The pay difference was significant between Newton ($7,750) / Cambridge ($38,000)
○ Cultural difference - believed the idea was to diversify the economic standing of those
running and on the Cambridge School Committee. His general sense was that most of the
members were middle class.
■ One observation was that if they were making $30k/$40k, a possible effect is that
you want to keep that income steam. If that meant competing against other
members on the board which lend itself to less than pure intentions/dynamics.
■ Some members had other jobs and others didn’t - for both groups the income was
still important, but for those that didn't have another job, the school committee
became their job. And that's a really different environment from most school
committees in MA. If this is my job I should do a lot and be really involved. In
other communities, school committees tended to focus more on high-level policy
rather than getting involved in the day-to-day functions.

He would work with CFO Claire Spinner, COO Jim Maloney, principals, staff, union and
curriculum staff, to figure out what was needed in the budget. Around January would present the
proposed budget (based on internal discussion, public meetings and meeting with city).
The superintendent's budget was always balanced
○ because would meet with the manager and finance director they would say we have x
money and need is x. And over weeks would figure out how to come to an agreement.
The City would make an effort to increase if needed and as superintendent, I would make
edits internally if needed.

Superintendent proposed budget → school committees approved budget → city council (meeting) →
pretty much they just approved what the school was doing. I can’t recall a specific time when they refuted
a specific item.
● Before we even began the budget process, would meet publicly with SC. you give us
guidelines/goals and his job was to build a budget that reflected those guidelines.
Who was it that you were talking to / oversight from when building a budget? Did you have the support
you ended to do it well?
● Hearing from school principals, curriculum leaders and teachers, and public hearings. It was
always about all of those inputs.
● I felt like the systems that were in place, I was in schools all the time, and feedback from people
who were in the schools all the time, public hearings, parents/families/caregivers, and I had
enough to put together.
Distinct structural differences between Cambridge / Other places?
● Strong city manager form vs newton's strong mayor - it was the personal relationships that
superseded any structural impediments.
○ presumably, the managers would have been more in a professional position with training/
other professional development around running a city. Able to talk to those managers in
an almost shorthand because of their professional experience.
○ Mayor system/ newton: relied on his legislative background, and I think because we built
a relationship the trust was there. Even though that mayor wasn’t exactly trained in
finance/ professional management
● Trust relationships with School Committee?
○ Some were very positive relationships and some are not so positive.
○ When I was first appointed it was originally a 5-2 vote (against - fred, denise) after the
1st vote fred said let's have a show of support, and changed his vote, denise didn’t, final
vote 6-1.
○ And again a few years later another vote, so that always creates a dynamic for
relationships because some people don’t vote for you.
Constraints on your ability to hire who you wanted to hire?

● Took SC out of personal decisions

The school committee never messed with any personnel appointments nor the manager.

Structural things to be done differently to address race issues?
- Desegregation
- Control choice policy, like most policies in US is about desegregating.
- A technical/ mechanical of school assignments
- Integration
- What happens within those schools once those kids are there is “integration” whether it
happens or not. Curriculum, family engagement, teachers, etc.
- 6/7/8 - Kto5 was ok and high school was pretty good, and 6/7/8 was the dead zone.
- One of the biggest ones was those teachers in 6/7/8 weren’t licensed/ in the subject areas
that they were teaching
- Comparing graduations in 8th grade, 50 at king open or 10 at the FMA school.
- Those kids in the smaller graduating class struggled because they had teachers
that were teaching across grades and subjects that they weren’t experts in
- Lack of curriculum was also a significant impact
- What is the school committee's role in maybe a struggling curriculum or teachers, etc?
Maybe wouldn’t want to have SC leading those changes because they don’t
necessarily have an educational background.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Councilor - 1 term. 2020/2021, On the housing committee and chair of the transportation committee.
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
N/A
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
It pays enough to be a full-time job, which I viewed as a positive. Especially during the pandemic which
required a lot of extra meetings and attention. Having a dedicated legislative aid to help with constituents,
notes, etc was particularly helpful.
Able to develop good relationships with other councilors, committee system was ok / worked well. Virtual
meetings were helpful.
Great that the council now has to approve appointments to certain boards and commissions, would be
great to add that oversight with department heads.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
With a strong manager/ weak council system, it was challenging to get things done as a councilor. Boston
for example with the Mayor/Council system has more clear paths for accountability that Cambridge lacks.
The process of councilors voting on the manager's contract is not clear to the public and lacks
accountability.
● The only existing mechanism for accountability is to fire the manager, which requires a lot of
money and an extensive process to replace. More challenging than having an election every 2/4
years like a mayor.
● Right now there are few ways to bring the city manager to the table on issues, if the council feels
like they aren’t heading in the right direction.
Relies on the manager to take action - like whether police have body cameras.
Council doesn’t have the ability to:
● add to the budget
● Provide oversight on personal decisions
● Infrastructure projects

Culture of funneling items through the manager, if you want to collaborate with staff on an idea or
initiative. Things take longer / potential for conflict.
Positive movement /change to pass informal goal checks on managers every # of years on certain goals.
Budget oversight:
● If the council votes down the budget its a nuclear option, but there is no other recourse in the
review of the budget
● Abiilty to move around elements of the budget.
City Solicitor
● Maybe change the structure so the solicitor reports to the council - like in Malden.
● For example, when the council tried to get rid of teargas, the solicitor wouldn’t draft the
ordinance.
● A mirror to the current system with the city clerk - the council hired the clerk and the council
could fire the city clerk.
Department Heads
● Confirmation of key department heads - like police chief / cdd.
● Would be good to set up meetings between department heads/staff and council/councilors on
items that they are trying to get answers on. It’s difficult because of the division between
council/department heads.
○ Challenging to make any electoral issue, because of limited resources for councilors.
Staff
●
●

Additional staff for the council would be helpful, maybe a centralized communications person or
another shared person for specific tasks.
Providence has 1 or 2 communication staffers so when the council passes something, they are
tasked with getting that news out. Would like to see more press releases/ interviews, spreading the
word about what Cambridge is doing.

Form of Government
● Generally supportive of an elected mayor. But even with that system, would want to strengthen
the legislative and balance that power between the branches
6. Anything else you would like us to know ?
RCV / At Large Elections / Term Lengths
● Change elections to even years - Portland, Maine
● Single transferable vote / RCV
○ Pros and cons - I wish more cities had it for comparison.
● District / At-Large
○ I did a lot of door-knocking and got 1500 renters to vote for me. If I was running to
represent one district I don't know if I would have gotten elected

●

Difficult to have regional representation with the current system. Maybe if you had a mix
of at large / district. Maybe multi-member districts - maybe like 3 elected RCV.
○ How lines are being drawn if there was a district councilor system.
The difficulty of the current system of single tranferable vote, is that its confusing for people. maybe explore other forms of RCV, dual transferable vote?
Right now, the people who vote get more representation. But the flip side is that certain
communities vote more and reason that others not voting.

Term lengths
● 2 years is short, and a lot of the second year is focused on running. Public financing could be
helpful to alleviate the time spent campaigning
● 4 years might be a long commitment, especially for young people looking to run. Maybe
staggered 3 year terms?
● Term limits - don't know about that, generally think more about term limits for executive but not
for legislative at least at the state level, it takes a lot of time to do the community organizing
work.
● Maybe term limits for manager or elected mayor.
Campaign fundraising
● The biggest challenge is that people are donating small amounts not 1,000 dollars to campaigns.
● CT/RH - have public financing for elections.
● Don't want to give money to people who run every two years but are not actually running, free
money. Require people to have x number of donations to get public funding.
Relationship to constituents / supposedly representing the whole city
● Constituent service is more challenging with an at-large system. Because people don't know who
their counselor is to go to. If they don't know who to go to, they email the whole council and
either get no responses or 4 councilors responding.
Why support charter review?
● Cambridge hadn’t done it in 80 years. And seemed like a good process to start
● Split throughout the process on having an appointed vs elected committee. Collins Center had
worked with elected commissions and saw that they tend to fail at higher rates.
○ Supporter of direct democracy, but always more political aspects

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Have lived in Cambridge my whole life.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Manager
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
After college I worked in the Treasury Department, eventually transferred to the budget office. Promoted
to budget director (20 years). Assistant City Manager for Finance (15 years), then City Manager (6 years).
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
The incredible team working for the city was always a highlight for me and a major appeal to apply for
manager positions. Public service is a thread throughout the team.
I have always had a customer service mindset. Government doesn’t work for everyone because people
don't come to city hall because they aren’t comfortable, but over the last 20 years the city has made
progress. We made an effort to reach out to different groups, and worked to help residents of Cambridge
see themselves in the city government.
I feel the manager system works well. Mayor structures can also be effective systems, but I think the
manager structure works for Cambridge.
In Cambridge, the City Manager understands that the city council sets policy priorities and they as the
manager are responsible to execute.
In my time as manager I worked with 3 different mayors, and I feel and I think they would as well that we
were a team. Councilors are my bosses. Cambridge is an $800,000 corporation, customer service
corporation. Important to have a skilled and experienced professional to manage that, the city wouldn’t
have the financial strength otherwise. Financial health of the city makes for a strong system. Healy
worked hard to get the city a bond rating and that was a significant first step into building what the city
has now.
The manager works for the council, but not directly for the residents, and I think that’s important. In a
mayor structure a few strong voices can really influence the mayor.
There will always be controversy in cities. But the manager doesn’t need to try to determine what or who
is right or wrong, but to try and get people to come together and compromise on issues. Manager can
make more impartial decisions, and deal with the consequences of the council. There will always be some

small number of loud voices. I tried to always do what was best for the whole city, not necessarily 1 or 2
groups of people.
In situations with Mayors, how did you compare yourself as they were elected and you were appointed?
● Mayors face a lot of similar challenges. I worked closely with Curtatone and Walsh, and we
partnered together a lot. Felt we were on a similar playing field.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
6. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
Biggest challenge is when you have to do something that doesn’t agree with the council. For example
during covid the council wanted to mandate vaccines for city staff (council voted 9-0), and after speaking
with the staff I made the decision to not require that. Then Boston required vaccines for restaurant
workers and the council wanted to implement something similar but I couldn’t justify that if I wasn’t
requiring that of my staff. I think this is a healthy dynamic that allows the manager to be the bad guy
sometimes when the council is advocating for something. Can help take some heat off the City Council.
Goal was never to disagree with the mayor or council, but sometimes needed to have courage to say no
you hired me to do this and we need to do x.
● Another example was the initiative for Cambridge to have their own cable tv system - as the city
manager he couldn’t justify it with the investment and no similar systems in other municipalities
that saw success.
As the manager I tried to keep the office as open and transparent as possible. Encouraging public
engagement as much as possible.
7. Some of the items that the Charter can impact are issues such as terms for elected officers,
department head and committee appointment authority, structure of and allocation of
authority in City government, budget process, elections and voting. Do you have any
additional thoughts you would like to share regarding those issues?
At-Large vs Ward Councilors
● I think the at-large council works. There are folks that represent certain areas like Tim Toomey East Cambridge or Thomas Danehy - N. Cambridge. I think having city wide councilors is
important for them to be thinking about what is best for the whole of the city. But I’m not saying
district councilors couldn’t work, just the at-large perspective is important.
Budget Process
● Many ideas about how to get more participation in the budget process.
○ When people are satisfied they aren’t coming to council budget hearings.
○ In the past we set up neighborhood meetings to discuss the direction of the budget and
priorities. No matter the investment we did to get people to show up, at many of those
meetings I had more staff than residents.

Participatory Budgeting first started when he was finance director. Great way to start to get
people involved. Started at $100,000 and now over 1M. Budget office has done a good job, 8,000
residents participated last time.

Do you see any areas that could provide opportunity for resident involvement?
● People in the administration have a lot of experience. Wouldn’t want to see the manager in a
position where they feel like they are making a wrong decision.
● But there are definitely opportunities to increase participation and dialogue around elements in
the city operations.
Appointment of Department Heads
● Manager needs to have the authority for appointing department heads. There should be a role for
residents and councilors, they should be able to voice their opinions and preferences (a good
example is with the police commissioner)
● The role of City Council to share what they are looking for in particular roles (skills,
qualifications, background) and the manager to determine who that individual is.
● Regarding boards and commissions - as manager I always felt I was trying to find quality people
who could do the job well.
○ Should people be paid for these roles, that is an important discussion
Mayor vs Manager
Boards/commission appointments in Mayor systems some might argue is more opportune for
appointments of friends/ political favors. Do you think managers are insulated from that potential
dynamic?
● Not insulated from that as a manager, because it's about the individual person.
Public Accountability / democracy
● Every city manager is appointed by the City Council. When you are appointed, you are going to
want to do a job that makes the council feel like they made the right choice.
● The accountability is to the City Council and you want the public to know what you are doing and
why you are doing it.
● If an individual isn’t following the mandate of council / public input - yes that person should be
removed. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be instances where the manager does not execute or
do something in the way the council wants. If they said no to something they need to explain that.
● There were always situations in Somerville / Boston where residents didn’t feel the mayor was
listening to them, and that's a normal part of any structure.
8.
●
●
●

Anything else you would like us to know ?
The Mayor and Manager need to have a strong working relationship.
The City / School Relationship is strong and unique in Cambridge
Cambridge has a strong council that wants to have more say, which isn’t a bad thing but you need
a line so that the manager has the final say. City council is working hard and they know what
residents want . Any way to increase the relationship, and provide more opportunity for the
council to have a say.

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
4th/5th generation in Cambridge.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
Now clerk of Superior courts Middlesex county, 14 years city councilor (chair of the finance committee),
Mayor for 2 terms
3. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you/ your
office to do its job well?
Relationships generally, and with the administration were really important for productivity. I understood
the different roles, and powers. Everyone had different ways to engage with the administration some
councilors would meet with the manager once a week.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
The challenging part is that some of the other councilors didn’t show up to committee meetings because
there were other community events and such going on - maybe there should be a quorum requirement for
committee meetings
5. Anything else you would like us to know ?
Councilor Composition:
● 4-year term - I'm not sure what it would do. Might lose the connection to the constituents
● Ward/ District: the at-large system required me to outreach to the whole city, and I think that is a
good thing.
● Separately elected mayor? - maybe, not sure the mayor should be the most popular person
running.
○ When I was in the council the election of the mayor was very challenging for the council.
○ The Mayor’s role needs to be collaborative, the best mayors realize it is not about them it
is about working together and providing leadership.
Goal Setting
● When we did have the goal-setting sessions, I couldn’t figure out what we did with them at the
end
● Maybe more necessary if the council is struggling to come together or is having strong
disagreements
Mayor vs Manager
● I don’t think the city should move to a strong mayor system

There might be something to say about having one person in the city manager role for 30 years,
maybe there should be consideration around limits on the length of time a city manager can be in
the position

Budget
● Do you think the council should have more power over the budget?
○ Commitments the city makes are farther ahead than 6 months to 1 year, need to be
thinking farther ahead in terms of budgeting.
● Maybe - 2-year budgeting (statutory rules around that?)

1. Are you/were you previously a Cambridge city resident? If yes, for how long?
Yes, I grew up in Cambridge.
2. What is your current (former) role / relationship to City government:
City Manager
3. Have you held other positions with the city?
As a kid I worked in DWP and the Water Department. Intern for City Manager, John Corcoran. Assistant
to Superintendent in the Water Department. City Purchasing Agent (3-4 years). City Manager Bob Healy
appointed me as acting and then permanent deputy city manager (32 years) then city manager for about 40
months.
4. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government allow(ed) you to do
your office to do its job well?
Overall I thought and still do that it’s a good system, clear lines of responsibility. City manager
responsible for the administration of the city. The City Council was responsible for policy. Manager was
in charge of implementation of those policies. Then there are different positions that manage checks and
balances like the city clerk and auditor.
General position - Cambridge has a structure that produced a system that was/is really successful. Doesn’t
mean you can’t polish it, and add more effective parts.
● Public buildings/ utilities, leader in affordable housing and climate.
● Strengths from bond rating agencies.
○ Successes because of strong fiscal health: rescuing the Cambridge Hospital, investing in
housing, capital budget process - rebuilt schools, roadways. Climate studies on
vulnerabilities.
● If you had mayors turning over all time, how would that affect employees with regularly
changing leadership?
● I think the manager always tried to be in sync and responsive to the council. Needs to be a more
public process because of the dynamics between individual councilors.
5. What aspects of the structure and processes of Cambridge government create(d) challenges
for your office to do its job?
Budget Process:
● Possible addition: In the end of summer or early fall establish public meetings with manager, key
staff and council, to capture council goals/ admin goals/ budget requests. Currently often the
council is passing goals in January, while the city staff is already ¾ of the way through creating
the budget.
○ A new process would benefit from this new mandate

344

○

Also include a finance presentation on the current financial standing of the city.

Public Engagement
● Challenge for elected officials, staff and the public to have so many public meetings, can be
difficult to know how to participate
● Example: 10 years process for the new library - years of gathering public comments. New people
come and go in the city administration, new residents, new elected officials.
● Recognizes some people/groups felt the public process wasn’t always safe in the traditional
methods, so administration would go talk with certain groups. Found surveys and workshops
created a more welcoming environment
6. What do you think worked well in the relationship between city council and the city
manager? What are/were some of the challenges?
It’s a process of relationship building, relies on all parties being positive and willing to work together. You
learn to understand your role and how processes work.
○ Example council wanted investment in affordable housing, started with a small amount of
tax revenue to being able to put 10s of million
○ For a long time the city was really worried about big tax increases to certain parts of the
city. Healy did a lot to hold the budget by not expanding jobs in administration, but now
the city has the room to add more roles.
○ Often working with local state officials and councilors on issues, like when uber came in
and cabbies were being affected, they worked to level the playing field requiring uber/lyft
to subscribe to the same rules as local cabbies. Partnering with other communities like
Somerville to encourage state action. Or green line expansion.
○ Looking to experts in other areas for advice, for example a major rodent problem, looked
to NYC experts, and brought their “tsar” to Cambridge to educate the staff.
7. Some of the items that the Charter can impact are issues such as terms for elected officers,
department head and committee appointment authority, structure of and allocation of
authority in City government, budget process, elections and voting. Do you have any
additional thoughts you would like to share regarding those issues?
Free Cash
● The city has more free cash than a lot of other major communities put together, but Cambridge
self insures all our properties that money is the insurance policy
● Some free cash is allocated in the budget to certain departments
As a City manager did you feel in conversations with other cities or orgs at the same level as a mayor?
● Felt is was an equal playing field. Cambridge was a leader on a lot of initiatives like affordable
housing/ environment/ bicycle access. Cambridge was offering the expertise and staff.
What would you think about City council approval over city manager staff?
● Prefers a system where the city manager gets to hire experts. Possible to have a structure where
the council gets to interview candidates for certain roles, but shouldn’t be for everything. If all
boards/commissions and department heads were subject to council approval it would be a huge

●

time commitment on the council. But doesn’t support denying the manager the ability to appoint
who they want, there is always recourse to terminate the manager if unhappy with administration.
There are certain positions - like housing authority or similar that council has to approve
Maybe a chair of a committee gets a review from the council.

Elections
● Important to ensure appropriate funding for whatever is needed, are computer systems up to date,
do we have the consultant we need?
Ward vs at large city councilors
● I think the city should be represented as a whole, anything that could be done that might make it
more fair/equitable should be implemented. But I don’t know what the actually solution is or have
the information
● Consider how it would impact the current voting system
● Different neighborhoods vary in makeup and needs like north cambridge vs alewife. Should
survey the public on this question.
Cambridge and its financial stability
● How would you stretch cambridge budget muscles that would be allowed within existing laws?
○ Eminent domain of a vacant building, owning the water system, reclaiming Danehy park,
are all examples of opportunities the city had to invest in the community because of its
financial strengths. Continuing to do that work.
8. Anything else you would like us to know ?
More open dialogue when there isn’t a pressing issue. Important for the city to be investing in building
constituencies all the time.
The city has a lot of resources and information like vulnerability study - could benefit from distributing
and educating residents

Section 103. City
manager;
appointment;
qualifications;
compensation;
removal

Section 103. The city council shall appoint a city manager who shall be sworn to the faithful
performance of his duties and who shall be the chief administrative officer of the city and shall be
responsible for the administration of all departments, commissions, boards and officers of the city,
whether established before its adoption of this plan or thereafter, except that of the city clerk, city
auditor, any official appointed by the governor or any body elected by the voters of the city. He
shall be appointed on the basis of his administrative and executive qualifications only, and need not
be a resident of the city or commonwealth when appointed. He shall hold office during the pleasure
of the city council and shall receive such compensation as it shall fix by ordinance. No member of
the city council shall during his term of office be chosen as city manager, and no person who has
within two years been elected to or served in any elective office in the city or in the county in
which the city is located shall be chosen as city manager.
Before the city manager may be removed, if he so demand, he shall be given a written statement of
the reasons alleged for his removal and shall have the right to be heard publicly thereon at a
meeting of the city council prior to the final vote on the question of his removal, but pending and
during such hearing the city council may suspend him from office. The action of the city council
in suspending or removing the city manager shall be final, it being the intention of this provision to
vest all authority and fix all responsibility for such suspension or removal in the city council. In
case of the absence, disability or suspension of the city manager, the city council shall designate
the head of some department to perform the duties of city manager during such absence, disability
or suspension, and, in case the office of city manager becomes vacant, the city council shall
designate the head of some department to serve as acting city manager until a new city manager is
appointed.

Chapter 43:
Section 104.
Powers, rights
and duties of city
manager

Section 104. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, it shall be the duty of the
city manager to act as chief conservator of the peace within the city; to supervise the
administration of the affairs of the city; to see that within the city the laws of the commonwealth
and the ordinances, resolutions and regulations of the city council are faithfully executed; and to
make such recommendations to the city council concerning the affairs of the city as may to him
seem desirable; to make reports to the city council from time to time upon the affairs of the city;
and to keep the city council fully advised of the city’s financial condition and its future needs. He
shall prepare and submit to the city council budgets as required of the mayor by section thirty-two
of chapter forty-four and, in connection therewith, may, to the extent provided by said section
thirty-two in the case of a mayor, require the submission to him, by all departments, commissions,
boards and offices of the city, of estimates of the amounts necessary for their expenses. He shall
make all appointments and removals in the departments, commissions, boards and offices of the
