Appendix 2: Evidenced-Based Intervention Additional
Information
What is evidence-based?
For the purposes of the SLFRF, evidence-based refers to interventions with strong or
moderate evidence.
Preliminary evidence means that the evidence base can support conclusions about
the program’s contribution to observed outcomes. The evidence base consists of at
least one non-experimental study. A study that demonstrates improvement in program
beneficiaries over time on one or more intended outcomes OR an implementation
(process evaluation) study used to learn and improve program operations would
constitute preliminary evidence. Examples of research that meet the standards
include: (1) outcome studies that track program beneficiaries through a service
pipeline and measure beneficiaries’ responses at the end of the program; and (2) preand post-test research that determines whether beneficiaries have improved on an
intended outcome.

COF 2021 #108
IN CITY COUNCIL
December 1, 2021

12/1/2021
Dear Colleagues,
I look forward to discussing the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds at this evening’s Finance
Committee meeting. I am writing to share a few examples from other cities about processes that have
been used for deciding how to allocate these funds. The City Council passed a policy order on October
18, 2021 requesting “...a task force that will hold regular public meetings to solicit ideas and feedback
from residents on the distribution of ARPA funds,” and I believe this is necessary if we expect equitable
engagement.
Cities across the country have so far spent very little of their respective ARPA funds. Each city is
engaging in some form of a longer-term process, balancing the urgent needs that people are facing with a
judicious and fair process. Cambridge has begun to appropriate funds, but we have not yet engaged in a
critical community process. There is an Ideas Form on the Cambridge ARPA website, but to solicit ideas
from a range of community members I believe more must be done. Cities that have already formed more
comprehensive plans that bridge high-level goals with project-level details—such as Boston, Buffalo, and
others—offer us useful frameworks for how to engage residents in Cambridge.
Examples of community processes:
The City of Boston established an Equitable Recovery Coordinating Committee to help determine the
allocation of ARPA dollars
• Made up of stakeholders from across City government to “ensure equitable, transparent, and
accountable distribution of these funds for economic and social recovery”
o 35 people from a range of sectors
o recover@boston.gov - to email with any ideas or questions about the process
• Boston also has a dashboard where all funds are categorized by type and amount with additional
info and a project lead listed (with contact information) for every project
o The website format is accessible and makes the process easy to understand
The City of Detroit initially planned 25 public meetings to engage the residents and communities.
• However, due to the overwhelming interest, the City instead held 65 public meetings to discuss
the 411 community meeting responses and 739 online survey responses.
• These meetings were convened to ensure that all voices were heard whether verbally at public
meetings or online through the City’s publicly available online survey. The results are available
by zip code and category.
• The residents and communities identified the following funding priorities shown in Figure 4.
• Upon conclusion of these meetings, it was decided that ARPA funds would be used for 15 major
appropriations. The City will divide each of the appropriations into projects that will focus on
equitable outcomes across a broad spectrum of populations, prioritizing those facing poverty,
homelessness, unemployment, disability, gun violence, and other communities of need. While the
details of these projects are still being formed, the City has created a rigorous review process

Packet Pg. 23

to facilitate that projects are created in a manner that selects the best-equipped community
organizations to provide equitable outcomes for the groups in need.
The City of Buffalo has described their spending plan as a “targeted anti-poverty program.”
• They held a series of meetings and attempted to reach people from across the entire city. This
report shows their plans.
• City policymakers were in regular contact with housing services providers, community advocates,
public health advocates, and neighborhood leaders to identify immediate needs. These
conversations became the basis for a series of meetings that went on to help shape many of the
proposals that have been formulated in this proposal.
• Advertised a survey through city’s media channels - The survey was structured so that residents
could identify what priority areas they would like to see stimulus funds invested. Residents who
did not have access to the internet could also call the City’s 311 line and provide their feedback
through that service.
I am looking forward to discussing these frameworks further this evening.
Sincerely,

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor
