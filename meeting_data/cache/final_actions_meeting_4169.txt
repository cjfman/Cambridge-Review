Re:

Policy Order #O-10 dated August 1,2022, regarding $44 million received through
incentive zoning since 2019.

Deputy Director
Chief Planner

In response to the above referenced Policy Order, we submit the following.
Section 11.202, the incentive provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, was amended in 2015,
with a significant increase to the per square foot contribution rate and an expanded
applicability of the incentive provisions of the Zoning Ordinance to a broader range of
developments. From 2015 to 2020, the contribution rate increased from $12.00 to
$17.10 per square foot of qualifying non-residential development because of increases
that were written into the Zoning Ordinance and annual inflation adjustments based on
the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 2020, the Council amended the Zoning Ordinance to
increase the rate to $20.10, subject to annual CPI adjustments. The current rate is
$21.02.
The first housing contributions under the 2015 zoning amendment were received in
FY19. From FY19 through FY22, $44,366,046.63 in housing contributions have been
received. The following is the list of projects with their use, qualifying non-residential
Gross Floor Area (GFA), applicable contribution rate, and contribution date.

Pursuant to Section 11.202(a) of the Zoning Ordinance, the contribution rate for a
development is set at the rate in effect at the time the Building Permit is issued. (There
is an exception in the Zoning Ordinance for buildings in Cambridge Crossing where the
rate is set at the rate in effect at the time of issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.)
The payment for all projects is due at the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
Therefore, as can be seen, there is not a correlation between the contribution date and
the rate, since the rate was determined when the Building Permit was issued (except for
Cambridge Crossing) and construction times vary greatly among developments.

Planning Board Questions
Which uses are subject to Incentive Zoning and which are exempt?
Incentive Zoning generally applies to non-residential development. Article 2.000 of the Zoning
Ordinance specifically identifies the following uses listed in Section 4.30 of the Zoning Ordinance as
being subject to Incentive Zoning if a project exceeds 30,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area (GFA):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

4.31 i-2 (Hotel or motel),
4.32 f (Radio and television studio),
4.33 b-5 (College or University not exempt by statute, specifically including those uses and
facilities listed in Subsection 4.56 c-4, c-5, and c-6),
4.33 c (Noncommercial Research Facility),
4.33 d (Health Care Facilities),
4.33 e (Social Service Facilities),
4.34 (Office and Laboratory Use),
4.35 (Retail or Consumer Service Establishments),
4.36 (Outdoor Retail or Consumer Service Establishments),
4.37 (Light Industry, Wholesale Business and Storage), and
4.38 (Heavy Industry).

All other uses listed in Section 4.30 are not subject to Incentive Zoning, including religious uses, other
educational uses (including elementary schools and dormitories), and government facilities.
How do different land uses impact housing supply and demand?
The “nexus” for the Incentive Zoning requirement is based on the direct impact of a particular
development on the City’s need to provide affordable housing. This does not account for the broader
impact of economic development and job growth in Cambridge and across the region, which impacts
affordability by increasing competition for housing overall, but is not linked to any one development or
any one community.
The 2019 Nexus Study that formed the basis for the current rates projected the number of employees by
use and industry to calculate the number of workers demanding housing in Cambridge. The impact of
each use on housing supply and demand varies based on a number of factors, including employment
density (i.e., the number of employees per square foot), the average income for jobs in that industry,
and the likelihood that employees will move to Cambridge. The Nexus Study determined that the
percentage of new employees who are expected to demand housing in Cambridge is 26.5% for
employees at educational institutions; 13.3% for office workers; 12.3% for retail, restaurant and hotel
employees; and 11.3% for employees in research and development firms. The below table from the
Nexus Study shows how these percentages interact with the projected number of gross new jobs per
industry as well as the projected incomes of those employees:

Incentive Zoning Rate Increase Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

a

The demand for affordable housing was projected for these uses based on the total housing demand
and the share of employees earning wages that qualify for affordable housing programs. For example,
while IT-related office jobs will result in 737 new employees demanding housing in Cambridge,
approximately 75% of those employees earn 100% or more of the Area Median Income (AMI). In
contrast, while restaurants will result in 123 new employees demanding housing in Cambridge, only four
of those employees earn 100% or more of AMI.
How could the proposed rate change affect the amount of funds collected? How many additional units
of housing would it create?
The attached Policy Order Response summarizes Housing Contributions made in Fiscal Years 2019
through 2022. It shows that during those four years there has been approximately $44 million in
contributions made from about 2.7 million square feet of qualifying non-residential development.
Because it typically takes 3-4 years for development subject to a particular rate to come to completion,
most of these contributions are based on rates lower than the current $21.02 per square foot.
The 2019 Nexus Study projected approximately 5,840,000 square feet of new qualifying non-residential
development over 10 years. This projection is highly variable due to market conditions and is a snapshot
of the development climate at that point in time. The study recommended increasing the Housing
Contribution Rate from $17.10 to $19.10 in the first year, then to $23.10 (plus any adjustments for
inflation) over four years. With a projection of roughly 600,000 square feet of qualifying development
each year on average, that would result in roughly $134 million (plus inflation) over 10 years, with
roughly $14 million (plus inflation) per year at the highest rate.
It is difficult to predict the effect of a higher rate on the pipeline of qualifying projects, as discussed
further below. Assuming the same amount of annual development that was projected in the Nexus
Study, the proposed rate of $33.34 per square foot would result in about $20 million per year in
contributions, compared to $14 million at the highest rate recommended by the Nexus Study. However,
the actual amount of funding generated by the Housing Contribution Rate depends on the amount of
actual qualifying development that is permitted. It also depends on any exemptions that are built into
the rate system.

Incentive Zoning Housing Contributions are made to the Affordable Housing Trust, and are used by the
Trust to create and preserve affordable housing. Incentive funds have been used to assist in the
preservation of 166 affordable rental units as well as to create new affordable housing. The number of
units created with Trust funds depends on many factors including the type of development, the specifics
of the project, and what other fundings sources can be applied. For example, recent funding
commitments for new affordable housing approved by the Trust have been in the range of $150,000$200,000 per unit for rental housing. Commitments for new affordable homeownership units range up
to approximately $425,000 for units purchased through the HomeBridge program.
How could the rate change affect development? How could the rate change affect tenants,
particularly retail tenants?
The 2019 Nexus Study discussed the effect of the Housing Contribution Rate on developers and tenants
(see pages 64-67). The main policy issue identified in setting the rate was how it would impact
Cambridge’s competitiveness in a regional real estate market. In other words, would a higher rate
encourage developers to build in surrounding communities to get a better return on equity? Similarly, if
higher contribution rates are passed along to tenants through higher commercial rents, could that
encourage tenants to look for space elsewhere? The Nexus Study also discussed the impact that any
additional commercial development, whether in Cambridge or in surrounding communities, would have
on the regional housing market, which would in turn create more demand for housing in Cambridge.
The study evaluated these factors and noted that Cambridge’s Class A office/lab market remained
strong in relation to competing areas, even though Cambridge has a higher Housing Contribution Rate
than communities such as Boston and Somerville. That showed a capacity to raise the Housing
Contribution Rate, but the study cautioned against a sudden increase that would widen the gap
between Cambridge and surrounding communities. The study recommended raising the rate gradually
over time so that changes could be more easily absorbed into the market, thus lowering the risk of
impacting Cambridge’s competitiveness.
Recently, commercial laboratory development has expanded in inner core communities other than
Cambridge, including Boston, Somerville, and Watertown. Those communities are currently in the
process of reassessing their own housing linkage rates. These factors make it more difficult to assess
impacts on competitiveness. Changes to the larger U.S. and global economy and recent increases in
construction costs are also major factors affecting development that cannot be fully anticipated. The
Nexus Study also noted concerns from developers about the uncertainty of how other City requirements
might affect development costs.
Effects on retail uses are more complex. There is a nexus between retail uses and the need for
affordable housing because retail and restaurant workers tend to have lower average wages than office
and laboratory workers (see above). However, most new retail development in Cambridge is a smaller
component of larger office/lab or mixed-use developments, where the goal is to promote activation and
amenities for workers and residents. As a result, the cost of the retail space tends to be absorbed into
the larger project, and in some cases is subsidized by the property owner. Different property owners
might choose how much to subsidize retail rents to achieve their desired goals, but the Housing
Contribution Rate is not likely to have a significant effect on that decision. Moreover, in some areas

a

where new ground-story retail is encouraged, it is exempt from GFA calculations, so it does not factor
into the Incentive Zoning contribution. The scenarios where the effects might be more significant are on
stand-alone retail developments of over 30,000 square feet, which are proposed from time to time but
are relatively rare, as discussed below.
How appropriate is the 30,000 square-foot threshold?
The 30,000 square-foot threshold has been in place since the Incentive Zoning provisions were first
adopted in 1988. Having a threshold is important because property owners need to have the ability to
choose to undertake a project without being subject to the requirement. Subsequent nexus studies
supported maintaining the 30,000 square-foot standard.
The following are some examples of projects that have been permitted in recent years that have been
under the 30,000 square-foot threshold. Notably, many of them have been hotel developments. There
are also a couple recent examples of smaller as-of-right office/lab developments, which had previously
been less common.

For a variety of reasons, there tend to be few commercial developments between 25,000 and 50,000
square feet in size. Developers may try to avoid projects that are just over the 30,000 square-foot
threshold, but the conditions of development sites and district zoning limitations tend to be stronger
determinants of a project’s size. If the threshold were changed to a different number, a similar issue
would arise at whatever new threshold is chosen. The suggestion of treating the threshold as a
“deduction” – i.e., the first 30,000 square feet are not counted in calculating the Housing Contribution –
could mitigate the impact on developments that are just above the threshold, but would reduce the
total contribution amounts as it would apply to large and small developments. At the current rate of
$21.02, deducting 30,000 square feet would reduce contributions by $630,000 per development.
What has been the reaction from the development community?
Thus far, comments have been received from the Chamber of Commerce, the Harvard Square Business
Association, and property owners of medium-sized sites in areas such as Harvard Square and Central
Square. The concerns have focused entirely on disproportionate impacts on smaller development sites
and on retail or hotel development in particular, as discussed above.
No feedback has been received from larger-scale commercial property owners or developers, or from
large institutional property owners or developers.

Incentive Zoning Rate Increase Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

How does this proposal align with Envision Cambridge?
The 2019 Envision Cambridge comprehensive plan establishes broad housing strategies to “Encourage
affordable housing production for low-, moderate-, and middle-income households through regulatory
and zoning incentives” and to “Expand resources for affordable housing production and preservation.” It
sets a target of creating at least 3,175 new affordable housing units between 2017 and 2030, through a
combination of inclusionary housing and directly subsidized affordable housing development. It also sets
a target of increasing annual funding to affordable housing from $13 million to $20 million. It
acknowledges Incentive Zoning as an important source of funding for affordable housing, along with
Community Preservation Act and other public funding sources, but does not make specific
recommendations as to the contribution rate.

Housing Contribution Rate. The Housing Contribution Rate effective upon ordination shall be
twenty dollars and ten cents ($20.10) thirty three dollars and thirty four cents ($33.34) per
square foot of Gross Floor Area, excluding the first 30,000 sqft., devoted to the uses that qualify
the new development as an Incentive Project. The effective rate shall be subject to annual
escalation equal to annual percentage increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Housing
Index for Boston-Brockton-Nashua, MA-NH-ME-CT or similar index to reflect changes in dollar
values over time; however, annual decreases in CPI shall not cause the contribution rate to be
decreased. The table below is intended to administratively track changes to the Housing
Contribution Rate as it is adjusted over time.

Article 2 - Definitions

construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings to accommodate uses in the
above list, (2) substantial rehabilitation of buildings to accommodate uses in the above list for
which the buildings were not originally used, or (3) Gross Floor Area whose use is changed from
a use not included in the above list to a use included in the above list. In no case shall Gross
Floor Area devoted to a Municipal Service Facility or Other Government Facility be considered
an Incentive Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this definition shall not apply to existing
floor area that is demolished and subsequently rebuilt as part of a building project.
