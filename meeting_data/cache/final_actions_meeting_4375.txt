Awaiting Report 23-31 regarding potential amendments to the
Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO)

Deputy Director
Chief Planner

The Community Development Department (CDD) has put together the following
information in response to the Council’s Policy Orders related to proposed
amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay zoning.
Review of Proposed Amendments to the AHO and Additional Suggested
Amendments
Attached hereto for the Council’s consideration is a red line of the Council’s
offered zoning language as part of Awaiting Report 23-31, for the purpose of
language clarity and consistency, and to improve the construction of the overall
zoning text.
In consultation with local affordable housing builders, an additional suggested
edit was made to the red lined text which allows particularly small lots (5,000
square feet or less) to waive required open space when the lot abuts a Public
Open Space that consists of at least 1,500 square feet of contiguous area. The
result would allow smaller lots to redevelop under the AHO where providing
open space on the lot itself would be infeasible, while ensuring future residents
would have access to open space resources directly adjacent to the site.
Consultation with Local Affordable Housing Builders on Proposed Amendments
In preparing this response, we consulted with Cambridge affordable housing
builders regarding the proposed modifications to the AHO and confirmed their
support for the amendments being proposed. They expressed broad interest in
exploring ways to maximize the affordable housing benefits of a site by building
taller buildings and welcomed the proposed change to the AHO to allow heights
of 12 stories in the corridors and 15 stories in the squares. Notwithstanding this
interest, builders noted that, for the near future, it is unlikely that many AHO

developments will exceed 11 or 12 stories due to other constraints beyond
zoning:
•

Funding: A fully affordable building of larger size requires substantial
financing subsidies from multiple sources. While local funds are more
readily accessible, it is challenging to secure the amount of state and
federal funding needed to complete a development of that scope.

•

Construction Technology: At this time the most feasible option for
affordable housing construction is light-gauge steel, which has its own
limitations as a construction method. It is expected that building
technology will keep improving and will provide a wider range of options
to make high-rise construction more feasible in the future, including
buildings taller than 15 stories. This includes emerging construction
technologies such as mass timber, that are emerging and should expand
what is feasible, construction-wise, for 100% affordable housing
developments.

Viability of Mass Timber Construction Pathways for Affordable Housing
Mass timber construction, also known as cross-laminated timber (CLT), is
construction that uses multiple thick, compressed layers of wood, either nailed
or glued together, as structural components to a building. This is not to be
confused with heavy timber, which is a traditional construction method using
heavy beams to create a framing system.
Mass timber construction is allowed in jurisdictions that have adopted the 2021
International Building Code (2021 IBC). Under this building code, the use of mass
timber is allowed for buildings up to 18 stories in height. The Massachusetts
Board of Building Regulation Standards (BRRS) is currently considering the
adoption of the 2021 IBC, which would include the new mass timber
construction pathways (types IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C). BBRS has been meeting since
2022 regarding this potential change, and a vote is expected in Summer or Fall
2023. If approved, mass timber construction will be permitted use in buildings up
to 18 stories in Massachusetts.

Two buildings in Massachusetts have already been built using mass timber:
UMass Amherst John Oliver Design Building and 201 Hampden Street in Boston.
Though mass timber is not yet allowed in Massachusetts, both projects were
able to obtain a variance that allowed them to do so.
While mass timber is not yet widely available, it is an emerging technology which
could be useful for building affordable housing in the future. We expect that
once approved for use in Massachusetts, there will be some time for builders to
learn about how best to utilize the technology, and to assess its cost in
comparison to other construction types. Staff will continue to monitor the
approval of the 2021 IBC and this new construction approach. When the new
building code is adopted here, staff will work with affordable housing builders to
understand where it might be advantageous to consider this construction
approach to build new affordable housing.
