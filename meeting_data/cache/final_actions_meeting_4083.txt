MEMORANDUM

FROM:

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development

Date:

RE:

Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance – Proposed Amendments

SANDRA CLARKE
Deputy Director
Chief of Administration

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Please find attached proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance. The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
adopted in 2014 and requires energy and water reporting from commercial
properties over 25,000 square feet and residential properties over 50 units. This
regulates approximately 1,100 buildings in Cambridge which are responsible for
approximately 75% of the building sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The ordinance has successfully increased transparency and awareness of energy
and water consumption by the regulated buildings. BEUDO includes a provision
requiring that the Community Development Department review the impact of the
ordinance on energy performance of covered properties, and recommend
amendments to improve building energy performance if it has not improved
significantly. Analysis performed in 2018 concluded that energy performance of
covered properties had not improved significantly and therefore CDD initiated a
performance requirement policy development process with participation of over
35 unique entities, representing private commercial and residential building
owners, universities, affordable housing providers, and green building
professionals. The attached proposal is the result of this collaborative process.
These proposed BEUDO amendments are intended to introduce GHG
performance requirements for BEUDO properties and achieve science-based
GHG reductions consistent with other leading cities including Boston, New York,
and Washington D.C. The performance requirements:
•

344 Broadway
Cambridge, MA 02139
Voice: 617 349-4600
Fax: 617 349-4669
TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

Eliminate GHG emissions from regulated properties by 2050, with the
following intermediate targets compared to an individual 2018-2019
baseline for most buildings:
o 20% by 2025
o 40% by 2030

Community Development Department

o 60% by 2035
o 80% by 2040
o 90% by 2045
•

Provide multiple compliance pathways including energy efficiency
improvements, electrification, on-site renewable energy, off-site
renewable energy, electricity grid improvements, and alternative
compliance payments.

•

Provide flexibility including an optional early baseline to account for early
action, alternative compliance timeframes for laboratories and affordable
housing, and portfolio level compliance for campus owners and affordable
housing.

•

Leverage technical support and access to state and federal financial
incentives through the existing Building Energy Retrofit Program.

The attached proposal for amendments to BEUDO represents an essential step in
Cambridge’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. The Net Zero Action Plan
adopted in 2015 and updated in 2021 identifies BEUDO performance
requirements as an integral part of a comprehensive suite of actions which
together will phase out GHG emissions from new buildings, many existing
buildings, and much of the energy supply system in Cambridge. This Plan has
been created and updated by a Net Zero Task Force representing stakeholders
throughout the community and is being overseen by the Climate Protection
Advisory Committee. Both stakeholder groups have urged the prompt
advancement of strong BEUDO performance requirements.
We are pleased to present these amendments to move forward the discussion of
emission reductions from the largest buildings in Cambridge based on a
comprehensive and collaborative stakeholder engagement process.

Exemptions: A Covered Property will be exempted by the Department from the
requirements of 8.67.100 if it qualifies as one of the following:
(a) New construction: For Covered Properties that receive an initial Certificate of
Occupancy after the start of the default Baseline years, the Baseline shall be the
average Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the first two full calendar years following the
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. Such Covered Properties shall be exempt
from the requirements of 8.67.100 for the five years following the conclusion of this
Baseline period. The performance requirements for each subsequent five-year
period shall be determined by a linear reduction to net zero emissions by 2050.
(b) A Net Zero Emissions Building;
(c) Vacancy: The Covered Property is fully vacant for the full year;
(d) The Covered Property is to be fully demolished within the forthcoming calendar
year;
(e) Financial Distress: Owners of a financially distressed Covered Property may apply for
an extension until the end of the current compliance period. Owners must provide a
form of third-party verification to substantiate an exemption request due to
financial distress. A building is considered in financial distress if it meets one of the
following criteria:
(i) The Covered Property is qualified for sale at a public auction due to arrears of
public taxes within two years of the start of the compliance period.
(ii) The Covered Property is controlled by a court-appointed receiver due to financial
distress.
(iii) The Covered Property is owned by a financial institution through default by the
borrower.
(iv) The Covered Property has been acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure.
(v) The Covered Property has a senior mortgage which is subject to a notice of
default.
The following building type-specific compliance pathways shall be permitted:
(a) Campus:
(i) A Campus may choose to comply with the requirements of Section 8.67.100 at
the level of each Covered Property or at the level of the aggregate Campus

greenhouse gas emissions. Campus Owners must determine their Baseline
according to the method by which they intend to comply with the requirements.
Owners may request to adjust their Baseline to include in the aggregate Campus
any new buildings that receive their Certificate of Occupancy after the start of the
Baseline years.
(ii) If the Covered Property that is part of a Campus is included in an institutional
comprehensive plan and a corresponding energy management plan, and these
plans have reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions from buildings at the institutional
level by the required amount for that compliance period, then the Covered
Property shall be considered to be in compliance. To show compliance with this
pathway, the Owner must provide copies of the institutional comprehensive plan,
institutional energy management plan, and the completed institution-wide
greenhouse gas inventory for buildings for the compliance period.
(b) Laboratories and Affordable Housing:
(i) Laboratories and Affordable Housing shall have the option to comply with the
following alternative compliance schedule:
1. Compliance Period 1: 2027 to 2033; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 66.7% of the default Baseline
2. Compliance Period 2: 2034 to 2040; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 33.3% of the default Baseline
3. Compliance Period 3: 2041 to 2049; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 16.6% of the default Baseline
4. Compliance Period 4: 2050 onwards; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions are
net zero.
(ii) Laboratory and Affordable Housing owners choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit documentation to the Department showing
that the Covered Property qualifies as a Laboratory or Affordable Housing at the
start of each 5-year compliance period.
(iii) Laboratories and Affordable Housing choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan to
the Department four years prior to the start of each alternative compliance
period detailing how the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirement for
that compliance cycle will be met.
(iv) For newly constructed Laboratories and Affordable Housing that choose to follow
the alternative compliance schedule and receive an initial Certificate of
Occupancy after the start of the default Baseline years, the Baseline shall be the
average Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the first two full calendar years following
the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. Such Laboratories and Affordable
Housing shall be exempt from the requirements of 8.67.100 for the seven years
following the conclusion of this Baseline period. The performance requirements
for each subsequent seven-year period shall be determined by a linear reduction
to net zero emissions by 2050.
(v) For Laboratories and Affordable Housing that request an alternative Baseline
pursuant to 8.67.100 (2), the adjusted performance requirements shall be as
follows; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will not exceed the indicated
