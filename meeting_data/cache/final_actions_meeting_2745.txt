The Public Safety Committee will meet to discuss traffic enforcement and PO 2020 #178
1.

The City Manager look into transferring primary traffic enforcement responsibilities from the
Cambridge Police Department to unarmed, trained enforcement personnel in the Traffic & Parking
Department, Department of Public Works, Health & Human Services, or another suitable
department

WHEREA
S:

Routine traffic stops disproportionately impact Black and Brown drivers, who are
pulled over and searched more often than white drivers, leading to potentially
stressful interactions with the police; and

WHEREA
S:

This racist outcome is not the result of biases by individual officers, although those
may play a role, but rather is primarily the result of systemic biases, including
over-policing in Black neighborhoods, and training of police officers to be
hypervigilant and to expect violent resistance, despite such incidents being very
rare; and

WHEREA
S:

The presence of an armed police officer during a routine traffic stop raises the
tension of the encounter unnecessarily and can itself lead to conflict, causing
harmful stress to both parties and damaging the relationship between police and the
community; and

WHEREA
S:

Routine traffic enforcement can be conducted by unarmed employees of the city,
which would reduce the possibility of violence during such encounters; and

WHEREA
S:

The police would still be responsible for apprehending known criminals,
dangerous or erratic drivers, and other related situations that clearly go beyond
routine traffic enforcement; now therefore be it

ORDERE
D:

That the City Manager look into transferring primary traffic enforcement
responsibilities from the Cambridge Police Department to unarmed, trained
enforcement personnel in the Traffic & Parking Department, Department of Public
Works, Health & Human Services, or another suitable department; and be it further
