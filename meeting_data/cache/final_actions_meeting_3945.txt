The fifth-floor windows are now
surrounded by a lighter red brick,
which gives the sense of greater
depth of a different material.

The right-hand side windows were
grouped in a bay like manner by
recessing the brick around them
and changing the color of the brick
slightly.

The windows were resized and
relocated.

Comment: The first floor already articulates
the existing character of the building as a
former one-story facade and this wraps into the
forecourt. We believe it would be contradictory
to also differentiate the facade on the upper
floors from their sides.

PLAN (DIAGRAM)

1. Sufficient FAR is not available without ‘clear-cutting’ the site
which would include removing a listed NHS building.
2. Building in this location would require breaking long-term
leases.
3. Retaining the existing facade would likely be a mandatory
requirement from the CHC. This affects the viability of a
second floor with windows.
4. The Project is designed to allow future addition along front
should the space become available and the zoning by-law
change to allow the additional FAR.
