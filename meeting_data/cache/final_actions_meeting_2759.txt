Why Perform a Digital Equity Study?

We often hear:
“More broadband is
the answer!”

First, let’s understand
the problems in
greater detail

Actionable solutions
can be found
• They will differ by
community
• Buildouts are expensive &
not always feasible

Communities need
research & strategic
planning

Middle School
Principal Calls for
Ubiquitous Access…
“Providing equitable access to
devices & Wi-Fi to middle
school students was a new
effort prompted by Covid-19.
This needs to be nonnegotiable: that every student
has access to a laptop & highquality Wi-Fi to keep the digital
divide erased. That is a lot
more radical than it sounds.”

… But Also Advises on Avoiding ‘Addiction’
” By middle school, habits or even tech
addictions are already formed; the City
needs caregiver education by second
grade to help families think through
setting rules around internet access &
tech usage well before they give
smartphones & laptops to their
children.”

Packet

Strategy Development (examples)
Boost programs that provide devices and training; good target for grants
and philanthropy
Show gap in adoption of subsidy programs—explore options for funding
subscriptions and removing signup barriers
Identify targeted infrastructure solutions (public housing, Wi-Fi in certain
public areas)

Build awareness and facilitate communication—sometimes people are
not aware of other local efforts
