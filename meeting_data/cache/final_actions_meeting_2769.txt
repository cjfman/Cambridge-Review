Calculation – refer to Table 2.C.1 above and Sheet Z-3 for supporting graphics
and summaries:
- The allowable non-residential GFA in BB per ZBL Table 5.1 is FAR 2.75 X Lot
Area of 21,262-SF = 58,471-GSF
- Non-residential GFA without Basement Area Waiver = 46,476-GSF
- Non-residential GFA with Basement Area Waiver = 33,320-GSF
Conclusion – yes, in both cases, the standard is met.

b. Does the Project meet the requirement in Article 20.304.3.4 to allow a FAR of
4.0 provided that at least 50% of the project is Residential?
Calculation – refer to Sheet Z-3 for supporting graphics and table. :
- Without the Basement Exemption, the ratio is 49.8% commercial and 50.2%
Residential. (46,476 Comm / 93,263Tot) + (46,787 Res / 93,263 Tot) = 100%.
In this case the GFA is 4.39.
- With the Basement Waiver granted, the Ratio of Commercial Use to
Residential Use is 42% commercial and 58% Residential with the
Inclusionary Incentives applied. (33,320 Comm / 79,203 Tot) + (45,883 Res /
79,203Tot) = 100%. In this case the GFA is 3.73.
Conclusion - yes, both with or without the Basement Waiver, compliance is
shown below.

7. 20.304.3.5 FAR Exemption for Residential Balconies [and Terraces]
FAR exemption for Residential Balconies. In the Business B district only, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Zoning Ordinance, the Gross Floor Area of balconies, porches, stoops, or
mezzanines on any floor of a structure that are accessory to residential uses and not exceeding
six (6) feet in depth measured back from the adjacent wall plane of a building shall be exempted
from the calculation of Gross Floor Area permitted on the applicable lot. Also, terraces that are
created by stepping back the upper floors of a building, provided that they are open to the sky
and a minimum of eight (8) feet in depth measured from the façade of the story beneath, shall be
exempted from the calculation of Gross Floor Area permitted on the lot.

Response – The project plans show that the project does qualify for this Exemption. The
building’s balconies do not exceed 6-ft in depth and the terraces a minimum of 8-ft in depth.

(i)

The total development authorized on the site is reduced to ninety (90) percent of the
maximum permitted on the lot; or a cash contribution is made to the Central Square
Improvement Fund to be established by the City of Cambridge in an amount equal to fifty
(50) percent of the cost of construction of the parking spaces not provided, said
contribution to be used by the City of Cambridge for one or more of the following
improvements in the Central Square Overlay District:

Response – The proposed development qualifies for the Waiver. A project is required to
have no more than 90% of the maximum permitted on the lot. In this case, the maximum
permitted on the lot is calculated to be approx. 4.99 FAR with Incl Incentives and granting
of Special Permits and Waiver equivalent to this Application. This simulation is
demonstrated in the Zoning Narrative Part 2, Section C.3.b, including a diagrammatic
graphic.

Communication: 600MassAve_20201208 (PB-369)

ZONING CRITERIA AND COMPLIANCE

With a Basement GFA Waiver, the proposed Project’s FAR is 3.73, which is 75% of the
maximum permitted on the lot. Without a Basement GFA Waiver, the Project’s FAR is 4.39,
likewise is less than the maximum permitted at the lot at 88%.
(1) Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;
(2) Programming, events, and infrastructure that contribute to the Cultural District
established in Central Square;
(3) Improvements to public parks, or restoration of historic structures, monuments and other
features owned by the City of Cambridge or other public agency or a nonprofit
organization;
(4) Improvements to public pedestrian and bicycle facilities such as sidewalks, crosswalks,
dedicated cycling paths and bicycle parking.
The Central Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make comments on any
proposal for the expenditure of such cash contributions. The funds shall not be used for
ordinary maintenance activities normally undertaken by the City of Cambridge. The value
of the cash contribution shall be determined by the Community Development Department
assuming equivalent structured parking spaces and using generally accepted cost
estimation methods customarily used by architects and engineers or using actual
construction costs for comparable contemporary parking construction in Cambridge.

Response – (1) through (4) are not applicable.

- The lot is cleared of all buildings (there are no National Registry structures
on the Lot and it would be assumed that demolition approval would be
granted or the delay period would expire).

c. Conclusion
In comparison to the FAR of the proposed Project presented in Table 2.C.1, the
ratio would be:
-

3.73 FAR (with equivalent Basement GFA Exemption) / 4.99 Maximum
Permitted on the Lot = 75% of Maximum Permitted on the Lot.
