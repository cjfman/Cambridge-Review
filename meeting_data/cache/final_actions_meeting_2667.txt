Station Plaza Design Review
PB #179
Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Chairwoman Connolly and Members of the Board:
DivcoWest Real Estate Services and its affiliates, DW NP Property, LLC and DW Q, R, V Property, LLC
(collectively “DivcoWest”), respectfully submit the enclosed revisions to the design for the Station Plaza
at Cambridge Crossing and request the Planning Board’s approval of such revisions. As you are aware,
the Planning Board approved the design of the Station Plaza at their October 15, 2019 meeting. The
revisions reflected in the enclosed materials respond to the questions and comments raised by the
Planning Board at the October 15, 2019 meeting, and improve the connectivity of the Station Plaza with
the abutting areas of Cambridge Crossing, including, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s
(“MBTA”) new Lechmere Station, which is currently under construction.
We note that significant portions of the Station Plaza are located on parcels of land owned by the
MBTAA and delineated as “Station Plaza West” and “Station Plaza East” on the enclosed plans. In
working with the MBTA, DivcoWest has made some minor adjustments to the design to better align the
pedestrian space and amenities with MBTA’s final design of the Lechmere Station. At the October 15,
2019 meeting, the Planning Board raised two (2) primary concerns relative to Station Plaza.
More specifically, the Planning Board raised concerns as to whether the stairs and retaining wall that
separated the westerly end of Station Plaza East from the abutting sidewalk along North First Street
would create a barrier to use of the Plaza, thereby making it difficult to traverse and less welcoming to
pedestrians. The Planning Board also questioned whether the alignment of the planters and brick bands
in Station Plaza West could be better aligned with the new Lechmere Station amenities along the
southerly and westerly ends of the Plaza.

Communication: CX Station Plaza_20200630 (PB-179)

Ms. Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair
Cambridge Planning Board
344 Broadway
Cambridge, MA 02139

In order to address these questions and concerns, DivcoWest has made the following changes to the
design of each side of the Plaza:

Cambridge Crossing - Appendix
Station Plaza Design Review Update

Packet Pg. 4031

Station Plaza East:
 Stone wall layout was shifted to wrap around the MBTA bicycle storage instead of aligning with
North First Street.
 Stairs and steps were eliminated with the change in the stone wall layout.
 Brick bands were re‐orientated within the plaza.
 Backless benches were added under the viaduct beam along North First Street.
 Blue Bike Station was enlarged to 23 bays and set parallel to North First Street.
 Plant bed along Monsignor O’Brien Highway was revised to improve pedestrian circulation.
DivcoWest believes that this modified design will make Station Plaza a more inviting area and lead to
greater utilization and activation by the public. DivcoWest is excited to provide you with the enclosed
revised plans for your consideration and approval and is excited to meet with the Planning Board to
present the same to you.
Sincerely,
DIVCOWEST REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS
Mark Johnson, FAIA
Director of Development
Exhibits:

Communication: CX Station Plaza_20200630 (PB-179)

Station Plaza West:
 Two Brick Bands were re‐orientated to avoid conflicts with GLX light poles.
 Stone Planter layout was adjusted and three trees were added to the Stone Planter.
 Plant bed along GLX property was enlarged by moving a brick band. The plant bed
accommodates the difference between GLX grading and the DivcoWest final plaza grading.
 Plant bed along GLX property will be installed with the construction of Building Q2.
 Planting during Station Plaza construction will include street trees along North First Street, vines
on Parcel Q1, and trees in the Stone Planter. The remainder of the plant beds along Monsignor
O’Brien Highway and Parcel Q2 will be installed in future phases. The updated planting list on
page 21 of the enclosed Planning Board update reflects this.
