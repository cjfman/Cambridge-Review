December 16, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $250,000 from Free Cash to the
General Fund Library Salary and Wages account to allow for a continuation of extended hours at
the O’Connell Branch Library. This is also in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19158.
The O’Connell Branch Library is well utilized by the neighborhood and an important community
resource. During construction of the Valente Branch as part of the King Open and Cambridge
Street Upper School Community Complex project, the O’Connell Branch was open to the public
for extended hours, and for 5 days a week, in order to accommodate increases in demand while
the Valente Branch was under construction. This was accomplished by using staff and resources
that would have otherwise been dedicated to the Valente Branch.
The new Valente Branch, completed in Fall 2019, is now open to the community six days per
week Monday through Saturday. Since that time, there has been a clear interest from library
users, neighborhood residents, and the City Council to maintain extended hours at the O’Connell
Branch.
Library administration worked closely with the City Manager’s office to understand
the level of use at library branches, scheduling considerations, community needs, and necessary
staffing levels to allow for extended hours at the O’Connell Branch.
I am very pleased to announce that this appropriation will allow the O’Connell Branch to hire
additional staff in order to remain open at its current level (5 days/ 46 hours a week) throughout
the end of the current fiscal year. The City also intends to maintain this level of service for the
O’Connell Branch as part of the FY21 budget.
The City Manager’s office will also continue to work with the Library and the City’s fiscal team
to develop a strategy to provide the same level of service and hours at other library branches
including Boudreau, Collins and O’Neill, as part of the FY21 Budget. This means that by
FY21, the City anticipates that all library branches will be open at least 5 days a week. The

1.1

Library will also work with neighborhoods to understand demand for Saturday openings at
branches as well.
Through the work and efforts of staff at the Main Library and branches, tens of thousands of
patrons continue to access materials, programs, and quality services. This appropriation, and
efforts moving forward, are further examples of the City’s continued dedication to the library
system, which is a well-used and well-loved resource in the City, and a model for other library
systems in Massachusetts and nationally.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager

prescription reimbursement costs for the remainder of the fiscal year for Library personnel
injured in the performance of their duties.

Re:
Hate Crimes
_________________________________________________________________________________________
The purpose of this response is to address Council Order O-8 (Awaiting Report 19-150) requesting a report on
“Cambridge’s threat level from hate crimes and other related events and what an appropriate response might be.”

The Hate Crimes Reporting Act, M.G.L. c. 22C, §§ 32-35, was enacted to monitor incidents involving biasrelated conduct. M.G.L. c. 22C, § 32 and 501 CMR 4.02 define a “hate crime” as any criminal act coupled with
overt actions motivated at least in part by racial, religious, ethnic, handicap, gender, gender identity or sexual
orientation prejudice or bias. Any violation of the following statutes is considered a per se reportable hate crime:
M.G.L. c. 265, § 37 (Interference with Civil Rights); M.G.L. c. 265, § 39 (Assault, Assault & Battery or Property
Damage for the Purpose of Intimidation); M.G.L. c. 266, § 127A (Defacing a Religious Structure); or M.G.L. c.
272, § 98 (the Public Accommodation Law). Determining whether an incident qualifies as a hate crime depends
on a thorough and complete investigation and evaluation of all relevant evidence. To that end, the same bias
indicators that support a civil rights charge are also considered when determining whether a particular crime
should be classified as a hate crime. See attached 501 CMR 4.02. Although an extensive list of bias indicators is
provided by regulation to assist law enforcement in making this determination, these criteria are not all inclusive,
and each case must be examined on its own facts and circumstances, utilizing common sense judgement. See
attached 501 CMR 4.04.

1.3.a

To facilitate this investigative process, the Cambridge Police Department has promulgated a comprehensive
policy and procedure to guide officers through any potential hate crime investigation. See attached Cambridge
Police Department Policy and Procedures #505.1. Policy #505.1 dictates, in detail, the responsibilities of the

investigation. The policy also outlines, in detail, the follow-up investigative and reporting procedures that are
required for the Department’s designated Civil Rights Officer, the assigned case investigator, and the Family
and Social Justice and Procedural Justice Sections. As can be gleaned from this policy, the Cambridge Police
Department is committed to safeguarding the state and federal civil rights of all individuals, irrespective of
their race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, or gender, and to aggressively
investigate any reported acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes
that appear motivated by bias against or hatred of a particular group.

In terms of hate crimes data, there were 16 hate crime incidents reported in Cambridge in 2018. The bar graph
below features the breakdown of each hate crime in 2018 by bias type. The graph actually features 17 hate crime
incidents because one of the incidents involved threats with both racially and religiously biased language, so both
categories were accounted for. The 16 incidents in 2018 break down into the following categories: religiously
motivated (50%), racially motivated (38%), and one incident (6%) each based on gender, gender identity/sexual
orientation, and disability.

The next chart provides a breakdown of bias type by year for 2018 and the five years prior. Race, religion, and
sexual orientation/gender identity (not necessarily in that order) are consistently the bias types that tend to be

The total of 16 hate crime incidents reported in 2018 is a 78% increase over the nine reported in 2017 but is only
23% above the 10-year average of 13. Cambridge tends to fall in the low to mid-teens when it comes to yearly
hate crime numbers, with occasional fluctuations above or below the average. In recent years, the City has ranged
from a low of seven in 2010 to a high of 25 in 2016. Spikes like the one seen in 2016 logically tend to raise
questions about possible causes. Although there was no clear explanation for the large increase in hate crimes in
2016, it could be speculated that part of the increase stemmed from the many differing political opinions and
overall emphasis on inequality that emerged throughout the country during that time.

most prevalent in Cambridge.

Although hate crimes appear to be trending slightly upwards in Cambridge over the past decade (which can
be seen in the chart above via the dotted blue line), hate crimes account for less than 0.4% of the City’s overall
crime during that time period. As such, the threat level from hate crimes appears to be very low.

I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions or information needed
regarding this matter, please let me know.
Respectfully,

Policy # 505
Accreditation Standards:

501 CMR 4.00; Cambridge Municipal Code
Chapter 2.76; Gov Baker Hate Crime
Recommendations 11/6/2017

I.

PURPOSE:
This policy is designed to assist officers to identify and respond to crimes which are
motivated, in whole or in part, by hatred or bias against an individual based on his or her
race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or gender,
and to define appropriate steps for assisting victims and apprehending suspects.

II.

POLICY:
The Cambridge Police Department is committed to safeguarding the state and federal
civil rights of all individuals irrespective of their race, color, religion, national origin,
ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, or gender, and to aggressively investigate any
reported acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other
crimes that appear motivated by bias against or hatred of a particular group. Toward that
end, officers of this department will fully investigate, document, and respond to all
allegations of bias or hate-motivated crime. The Cambridge Police Department shall
designate a “Civil Rights Officer”. The Civil Rights Officer shall be the Deputy
Superintendent that commands the Procedural Justice Section. (See Pg. 10 of this policy
for the responsibilities of the Civil Rights Officer). Additionally, a Deputy Civil Rights
Officer will be assigned to the Procedural Justice Section and will support the Deputy
Superintendent in the critical functions of department operations and management
systems key to ensuring that hate crimes data is transparently reported and easily
accessible to affirm the public’s confidence in the Department’s response to hate crime
incidents.

III.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND GUIDELINES:
A successful law enforcement response to hate crimes requires a close partnership with
targeted communities. A relationship of trust and cooperation between the police and
these communities is essential to combat the violent expression of racism and bigotry,
reduce community fear, and deter bias-related incidents. Citizens of all backgrounds must
feel encouraged to come forward whenever a hate crime occurs and must have
confidence that the police will handle these matters with appropriate seriousness,

#505 – Hate Crimes and/or Incidents

Page 2 of 14

Hate crimes are viewed very seriously by this Department and will be given the highest
priority. The Department will use every available resource to rapidly and decisively
identify the perpetrators, arrest them, and take vigorous enforcement action. Hate crimes
not only adversely affect the quality of life for its victims, but also creates a very negative
impact on the community as a whole. The failure of law enforcement to respond
appropriately to hate crimes can sour productive and cordial relationships with affected
groups within the community. Likewise, if a community demonstrates even the slightest
tolerance for hate crimes, it risks developing a reputation that runs counter to the many
good qualities it may actually possess. How a community responds to hate crimes speaks
directly to the quality of life within that community.
Victims of hate crimes may experience unique trauma and distress. In the larger
community, hate crimes create fears of reprisal and escalation of violence, and may
create far-reaching negative consequences in the targeted community. This Department
will be particularly alert to the security and safety concerns of the immediate victims, as
well as the concerns of their families, neighbors, and other members of the community
affected by the crime.
IV.

DEFINITIONS:
A.

Advocacy Organization: Any non-profit group which represents or serves
constituencies targeted in hate crimes motivated by the forms of bias enumerated
in 501 CMR 4.02(3), or which gathers information relating to the incidence,
circumstances, patterns, causes, or nature of hate crimes or incidents or any
specific type(s) of hate crimes or incidents.

B.

Bias Indicators: Objective facts, circumstances, or patterns attending a criminal
act which, standing alone or in conjunction with other facts or circumstances,
suggest that the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by any
form of bias enumerated in 501 CMR 4.02.

C.

Bias Motive: Hatred, hostility, or negative attitudes towards, or prejudice against
any group or individual on account of race, religion, ethnicity, handicap, gender,

commission of a criminal act. A bias motive can be inferred from the presence of
one or more bias indicators. The specific form of bias covered by the Hate Crime
Reporting Act are:

gender; or
(b) does not conform to conventional gender role expectations for his or
her biological or birth gender. Bias is usually attributed to the
circumstance of traditional gender role conventions being openly violated.
This bias constitutes gender bias because a “transgender person” is

the offender’s action was motivated, in whole or in part, by bias or hate. The following
criteria can assist law enforcement officers in determining whether a particular crime
should be classified as a hate crime. These criteria are not all inclusive and each case
must be examined on its own facts and circumstances. Common sense judgment should
also be applied in determining whether a crime should be classified as a hate crime.
While one fact may be conclusive, the following factors, particularly when combined,
may support a finding of bias/hate:
A.

Differences between Individuals/Groups: The offender and the victim were of
different racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, handicap, and gender or sexual
orientation groups. For example, the victim was black and the offenders were
white.

B.

Incident Coupled with Bias Statements/Gestures: Bias-related oral comments,
written statements, or gestures were made by the offender that indicates his/her
bias. For example, the offender shouted a racial or anti-gay epithet at the victim or
made an abusive or pejorative reference based on gender.

C.

Bias-Related Drawings or Markings: Bias-related drawings, markings,
symbols, or graffiti were left at the crime scene. For example, a swastika was
painted on the door of a synagogue.

D.

Bias Symbol or Rituals: Certain objects, items, or things which indicate bias
were used (e.g., the offenders wore white sheets and white hoods) or were left
behind by the offender(s) (e.g., a burning cross was left in front of the victim’s
residence).

E.

Bias Related to Location of Residence: The victim is a member of a racial,
religious, ethnic/national origin, handicap, gender or sexual orientation group that
is overwhelmingly outnumbered by members of another group in the area where
the victim lives or works and the incident took place.

F.

Bias Incidents Based on Location: The victim was visiting a location where
previous hate crimes had been committed against other members of his/her racial,
religious, ethnic/national origin, handicap, gender or sexual orientation group, and
where tensions remain high against his/her group.

INDICATORS OF A POSSIBLE HATE CRIME INCIDENT:
In attempting to determine whether a particular crime or incident should be classified as a
Hate Crime/Incident, the responding officers should evaluate the presence of the
following factors:


An Act, threat, or attempt:
1. That constitutes an expression of hostility toward members of a particular racial,
religious, ethnic, handicap, gender or sexual orientation group; or
2. That is intended injure, intimidate, interfere with or oppress any person or group
in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the

or ethnicity, handicap, gender or sexual orientation group; or
3. Symbolic gestures, drawings, markings, or graffiti with racial, religious,
ethnic/national origin, handicap, gender or sexual orientation connotations.
VII.

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
A.

Responsibilities of Initial Investigating Officer: It is the responsibility of each
officer to be alert to the fact that a criminal offense may have been directed at an
individual, private property, or public property for motives based upon prejudice
or discrimination of a person or group’s particular race, religion, ethnic
background, handicap, gender or sexual orientation group. Hate Crime Incidents
may generate fear and concern among victims and the community. These
incidents have the potential of reoccurring, escalating and possibly causing
counter violence. Therefore, Hate Crime Incidents require a thorough and
comprehensive response on the part of all sworn officers charged with the
investigation of such incidents.
1. If an officer either suspects or confirms that an incident was the result of
discrimination or bias, that officer will immediately notify her/her supervisor.
2. The officer will begin to conduct a thorough and complete preliminary
investigation which shall include:
a. The identification of all persons who may have witnessed or be acquainted
with the circumstances of the incident.
b. The identification and apprehension of the actor (s) who committed such
an offense, based upon sufficient probable cause.
c. Any information which may be obtained concerning suspects, including
possible motives for the act, person (s) and /or property targeted in the act,
how targeted, means of the attack, time of incident, characteristics of the
incident, and information provided by the victim or other witnesses.
d. All investigating officers must be sensitive and responsive to the victim’s
concerns for safety, and the psychological affects that are associated with
victimization.

1

It is important to note that not every use of a slur or epithet will make an incident rise to the level of a hate crime.
Officers and supervisors must evaluate all the circumstances of the incident, including the use of slurs or epithets, to
determine whether bias or hostility toward a particular group was the motivating factor in the crime.

CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT
Packet Pg. 56

Attachment: hate crimes response 121619 (CMA 2019 #330 : Awaiting Report 19-150 RE: hate crimes)

1. Telephone calls, writings or oral statements1 that contain slurs or epithets against
a particular racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, handicap, gender or sexual
orientation group ;

1.3.a

Page 9 of 14

Assure that the crime scene is properly protected, preserved, and processed,
and ensure that all physical evidence of the incident is photographed,
collected, labeled, and submitted according to the Department’s Property and
Evidence procedures. If evidence of an inflammatory nature cannot be
physically removed (e.g., painted words or signs on a wall) the owner of the
property shall be contacted to remove such material as soon as possible once it
has been photographed.

4. Include all pertinent details of the investigation in a typed incident report,
classifying the report as a “Hate Crime by means of ____________.” The
report must include all the facts and information gathered that support the
conclusion that the act was prompted or motivated by bias.
5. All investigating officers have a duty to respect the dignity and integrity of the
victim.
B.

Responsibilities of the Supervisor: Because of the complexity of hate crimes,
and the need to reach a swift resolution for any incident that may be based upon
prejudice and discrimination, it is imperative that all such investigations be
properly supervised.
1. Once a supervisor has been notified of a suspected Hate Crime Incident, that
supervisor (or shift commander, if a supervisor is unavailable) shall respond to
the crime scene to be fully briefed by the investigating officer, and to
supervise the investigation. Additionally, the supervisor should notify the
Civil Rights Officer and provide a briefing as to the circumstances in order
determine whether the incident has met the threshold of a hate crime.
2. It will be incumbent upon the supervisor to determine if a detective (or
designated Civil Rights Officer) should be immediately dispatched to continue
with the investigation at that point in time. The supervisor should keep in
mind that photographs of the victim and/or the scene may be extremely
beneficial to the investigation.
3. The supervisor shall be mindful that bias-related incidents have a tendency to
escalate or create a great sense of alarm to victims and the public, and
therefore, he/she shall take every precaution to ensure that an escalation of
hostilities or retaliatory violence does not occur. Such precautions may
include immediately increasing patrols throughout the affected area, assigning
an officer to protect the scene and/or victim or witnesses, and referral to the
Family and Social Justice Section.

Shift Briefing email.
2. The officer assigned to review reports shall be alert for any factors that
suggest that the incident was targeted at a person, private property, or public
property due to bias, prejudice, or discrimination.
3. All cases having been identified as a Hate Crime Incident shall be clearly
identified as such, and flagged so that the reports may be forwarded when
transcribed. All Hate Crime Incident reports will have copies emailed to the
following offices:

VIII. FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIVE & REPORTING PROCEDURES:
A.

Responsibilities of the Civil Rights Officer: Victims of Hate Crime Incidents,
like other victims of crime, tend to experience emotional stress as a result of their
victimization. The special nature of hate crimes, including an increased feeling of
threat or personal violation, may heighten this stress for a victim. Whenever
possible, the department’s designated Civil Rights Officer will be assigned as the
point person on Hate Crime Incident cases. The Civil Rights Officer’s function
would be to serve as a community liaison and to participate in appropriate
community outreach, to review incident reports for potential hate crimes and to

serve as a resource for the community on any issue related to hate crimes. The
Civil Rights Officer will also work closely with the Crime Analysis Unit to ensure
that hate crimes data is transparently reported, publically available, and easily
accessible to the public ensuring the public’s confidence in our response to hate
crime incidents. To ensure the uniform and accurate reporting of data, Hate Crime
data will continue to be entered through National Incident Based Reporting
System (NIBRS). Also the Civil Rights Officer should be prepared to report all
Hate Crime data through a designated portal to be developed by the EOPSS.
Crime Analysis will continue to have a dedicated summary page of all Hate
Crime data made available as part of the CPD Annual Report.
The Civil Rights Officer shall work closely with the Deputy Superintendent of the
Criminal Investigations Section to ensure prompt case assignment of a detective
for follow up and timely victim contact to support and aid a victim’s recovery.
B.

Responsibilities of the Investigator assigned:
1. The investigator assigned to a Hate Crime Incident investigation shall be
responsible for reporting on the progress of the case to her/her immediate
supervisor on a regular basis.

The assigned investigator will determine the primary elements of the
incident and obtain information to complete the date elements of the
Uniform Crime Report’s Supplementary Hate Crime Incident Offense
Report. Primary elements of the investigation include:
 Persons Targeted
 Objects Targeted
 Time & Dates Involved
 Means of Attack
 How Targeted
 Trademarks Involved

2. Assist the victim(s) or witness (es) in obtaining appropriate support services,
if necessary.
3. The investigator assigned to the Hate Crime Incident investigation shall be
sensitive to the safety concerns of the victim (s) and witnesses, and arrange for
appropriate security measures to be implemented to protect persons and
property.

6. Provide ongoing information to the victim about the status of the criminal
investigation.

8. Complete any reports necessary to comply with the statistical reporting
requirements for Hate Crimes.
C

Responsibilities of the Family and Social Justice Section: While not all Hate
Crimes Incidents can be anticipated or prevented, crime prevention services shall
be provided for each suspected or confirmed Hate Crime Incident, as appropriate.
Hate Crime Incidents are not only crimes against the targeted victim, but also as a
crime against the victim’s racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, handicap,
gender or sexual orientation group as a whole. After a hate crime incident, it is
essential that the police department work constructively with segments of this
larger community to help reduce fears, stem possible retaliation, help prevent the
occurrence of additional Hate Crimes and/or Incidents, and encourage any other
previously victimized individuals to step forward and report these crimes.
Towards this end, the Family Justice Group, Social Justice Unit and Clinical
Support Unit shall adhere to the following:
1. In all cases that have been identified as a Hate Crime Incident, it shall be the
responsibility of the Deputy Superintendent of the Family and Social Justice
Section to coordinate with the Deputy Superintendent of the Investigations
Section and the primary investigator assigned the case to ensure the timely
contact of the victim of such an offense and to offer services provided by the
unit.
2. It shall be the responsibility of the Family and Social Justice Section to review
all directives issued in connection with Hate Crime Incident Investigations
and become familiar with those agencies that are designed to assist in such
cases.
3. Where appropriate, it shall be the responsibility of the Family and Social
Justice Section to see that the victim of a hate crime incident and his or her
family are made aware of services provided by social services and related
advocacy groups. Further, the assigned member of the Family and Social
Justice Section will assist the social services and related advocacy groups to
the extent possible.
4. As resources become available, and in those cases where it is appropriate, the
assigned member (s) of the Family and Social Justice Section will coordinate
with the Civil Rights Officer to provide information to community groups in

CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT
Packet Pg. 60

Attachment: hate crimes response 121619 (CMA 2019 #330 : Awaiting Report 19-150 RE: hate crimes)

7. Contact the victim(s) periodically to determine whether he/she is receiving
adequate and appropriate assistance.

1.3.a

#505 – Hate Crimes and/or Incidents

Page 13 of 14

5. The assigned member (s) of the Family and Social Justice Section will also
coordinate with the Civil Rights Officer to meet with neighborhood groups,
residents in target communities, and other identified groups to allay fears,
reaffirm the Department’s commitment to respond to this and related
incidents, reduce the potential for counter-violence, and provide safety,
security, and crime prevention information.
6. Expand, where appropriate, existing preventative programs, such as anti-hate
seminars for school children.
D.
Responsibilities of the Procedural Justice Section: An important component of
the Hate Crime Incident Investigation is to provide sufficient information through central
coordinating agencies, so that such incidents may be clearly identified and measures are
taken to preclude the risk of further injury, property, damage, and reprisals.
1. Under the Procedural Justice Section, it shall be the responsibility of the
Crime Analysis Unit and the Rights & Liberties Unit to work under the
supervision of the Civil Rights Officer to assess the Department’s compliance
with statutes, ordinances, and regulations aimed at mandating accountability
and to ensure that all Hate Crimes are properly reported.


If additional information becomes available, an amended report or
additional data or information shall be submitted to the Crime Analysis
Unit.



All reported crimes shall be referenced and identified by the case number
assigned by the police department, the time and date of the incident, and
other particularized information deemed relevant by the Crime Analysis
Unit and the Rights & Liberties Unit.

2. It shall be the responsibility of the Crime Analysis Unit to see that all reports
that have been identified as a Hate Crime Incident are amended to reflect the
appropriate classification.
It shall also be the responsibility of the Crime Analysis Unit, working with the
Civil Rights Officer, to ensure that hate crimes data is transparently reported,
publicly available, and easily accessible to the public ensuring the public’s
confidence in our response to hate crime incidents. To ensure the uniform and
accurate reporting of data, Hate Crime data will continue to be entered through
National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Also the Crime Analysis
Unit should be prepared to report all Hate Crime data through a designated portal
to be developed by the EOPSS. Crime Analysis shall also continue to have a

Description

DPW

Building Asset Inventory

$200,000

This project involves the implementation of
Cartegraph which provides an improved way to
maintain capital investments. The initial phase will
include an inventory of assets by a third-party vendor
retained by Cartegraph, which will provide a better
understanding of building assets, and how to maintain
those assets from both a reactive and proactive
standpoint. This will also allow for streamlining
facility operations from beginning to end with energy
management coordination.

CDD

BEUDO Compliance and
Data Management
Platform

$130,000

The Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance (BEUDO), adopted by City Council in
2014, requires owners of buildings that are on parcels
greater than 25,000 s.f. or 50 residential units, to
annually report their energy and water use to the City
using the EPAs Portfolio Manager (PM) tool. The
City collects the data to track compliance, map data,
help property owners monitor building performance,

Packet Pg. 66

1.5

and identify opportunities for increased efficiency and
energy and cost savings. Through the ordinance, the
City currently collects about 700 Portfolio Manager
reports each year, and each report contains about 200
variables related to the building’s operations, energy
and water use. There are currently over 2,800 data
records and 560,000 data points. This project will
allow for the development of an integrated platform
for collecting BEUDO data; managing the data in a
relational database that matches records over time;
tracks and automates communication about
compliance; and supports continuity in
communications about building improvements.
Library

Main Library Lecture
Hall AV Upgrades

$150,000

Funding will be used to make AV improvements in the
Lecture Hall and adjacent Community Room. The
Lecture Hall has a seating capacity of 220 and is used
extensively for events for the community. The room
was booked for 223 events in 2018. An increasing
number of events are also being lived streamed. In
addition, high-profile speakers often require streaming
video from the Lecture Hall into other library spaces
to accommodate overflow crowds. This project will
provide infrastructure to support acoustic lighting, and
technology upgrades as well as improved live
streaming.

Library

RFID Security Gates at
Library Branches

$76,300

The RFID gates at Library branches enhance security
and serve as a visitor count system. The visitor count
function allows for a more accurate measure of a key
service metric that is reported to both the City
Manager’s Office and Massachusetts Board of Library
Commissioners. A uniform system of gates with
integrated reporting will enable the Library to have a
more complete picture of usage and to make more
data-driven service decisions.

Police

Digital Investigation and
Evidence Management
System

$92,900

Funding will be used for an automated Digital
Investigation and Digital Evidence Management
Software (DEMS) Solution that automates the entire
digital investigation and evidence management
process, for the Police, Fire and Emergency
Communications Departments. The volume and
variety of digital evidence continues to grow with
technology advancements. This system will allow
cases to close faster and streamline access to, and
retrieval of, information relative to the cases, which is
currently done manually by investigators and support

The Finance Department in collaboration with the School Department is working on determining
the number of Cambridge high school students at other high schools who would be eligible to
receive this benefit, as well as evaluating if there are current structures in place at these schools
to issue MBTA passes including understanding if these schools already offer a free or discounted

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $1,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment
Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account to support the design and construction
of Elm Street between Hampshire Street and the Somerville line, as part of the Complete Streets
Reconstruction Program.
The goal of the Complete Streets Program is to reconstruct streets and sidewalks to provide high
quality infrastructure with an emphasis on designing streets for all users and supporting the city’s
commitment to Complete Streets and Vision Zero. Funding for Complete Streets is included in
the FY20 budget.
This appropriation will provide additional funding to improve this section of Elm Street,
including: addressing the condition of the paving; reconstructing the sidewalks to be fully ADA
accessible; incorporating traffic calming elements to enhance the safety and comfort of the street
for pedestrians and cyclists; incorporating green infrastructure; planting additional street trees;
and strengthening the character and operation of Elm Street for the community.
This appropriation will also allow the City to further accelerate implementation of the
Cambridge Bicycle Plan. Enhancing bicycle safety and infrastructure is an increasingly
important priority for the City. During discussions regarding Webster Avenue earlier this year,
Elm Street and Tremont Street were highlighted as critical links in the north-south bicycle
network that should be prioritized for improvements. The Cambridge Bicycle Plan’s bicycle
network map identifies a north-south connection between Cambridge Street and the
Cambridge/Somerville boundary, using Elm Street in the northbound direction and Tremont
Street in the southbound direction. Tremont Street is included in the 5 Year Plan for 2023 and
this additional funding will allow Elm Street between Hampshire Street and the Somerville to be
added to the 5 Year Plan immediately.

These streets are designated as low-speed/low-volume connections, meaning that they would
operate as streets that can be safely and comfortably shared with motor vehicles based on their
operational characteristics and traffic calming elements. The low-speed / low-volume streets are
a critical element of the bicycle network and complement the network of protected bike lanes.

Subject:

Awaiting Report 19-156 – Bicycle Markings on Broadway

This memo is in response to Order 2 from the November 25, 2019 City Council
Meeting (Awaiting Report 19-156) in reference to a request to restore shared
lane markings (also known as sharrows) on Broadway between Windsor Street
and Portland Street.
Prior to the summer of 2019, Broadway provided a single wide travel lane in
each direction with shared lane markings located approximately 11 feet from
the curb (see cross section in Figure 1). During the summer of 2019, the
Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department upgraded the striping on
Broadway to provide bicycle lanes within the existing space of the vehicular
travel lane. The lanes were placed consistent with other roadways of similar
width across Cambridge, including a 7-foot parking lane, a 5-foot bicycle lane,
and a 10-foot general purpose vehicle travel lane (see cross section in Figure
2). This cross section is consistent with several other major bicycle corridors in
Cambridge, including Broadway east of Portland Street, Hampshire Street,
Main Street, and Cambridge Street east of Prospect Street.
The new bicycle facilities have several beneficial impacts for both cyclists and
other users of the roadway. The narrower vehicular travel lanes have been
proven both locally and nationally to reduce the travel speeds of motorists. By
defining the 5-foot wide bicycle facility, cars are encouraged to drive farther to
the left and provide more space for cyclists in the adjacent bike lane.
The Department’s policy for shared lane markings is to install them in locations
that are identified as bike routes where bike lanes, separated bike lanes, or offstreet paths do not exist. We do not install shared lane markings adjacent to
existing bike facilities unless there is a need to identify a path for turning
bicycles entering a shared turn lane. Providing parallel markings for shared
lanes and exclusive bike lanes would provide a confusing message to both
cyclists and drivers. In addition, guidance for the installation of shared lane
markings indicate that the markings should be placed 11 feet off of the curb in

locations with on-street parking. This would place the markings within the
recently installed bike lane, where they previously were located.
In September of this year, staff from the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation
and Community Development Departments met with a group of cycling
advocates to discuss the concerns that had been expressed about this new
layout. This led to a better understanding of the reasons behind the change in
the street layout, as well as some suggestions for additional signs to help
communicate with both cyclists and pedestrians. Based on the meeting, we
determined that additional changes to the cross-section of Broadway were not
necessary at this time.
While this segment of Broadway was not designated as a corridor for separated
bicycle lanes under the 2015 Bicycle Network Plan, the recently installed bike
lanes would not preclude future additional upgrades to the corridor to provide
separated facilities. The process for the development of a revised bicycle
network plan is underway and expected to be complete in mid-2020, and this
segment of Broadway was been mentioned as a possible addition to the
network. If improved facilities are called for on Broadway, they would be
evaluated as part of a future capital or quick-build project, including performing
public engagement to explain the benefits and impacts.

To:

Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager

From:

Joseph E. Barr, Director

Date:

December 11, 2019

Subject: Awaiting Report 19-103 – Potential for a traffic signal at the intersection of
Massachusetts Avenue at Garfield Street
This memo is in response to Order 33
from the July 30, 2019 City Council
Meeting (Awaiting Report 19-103) to
report on pedestrian safety concerns for
pedestrians crossing Massachusetts
Avenue at Garfield Street.
The existing intersection provides a
crosswalk across the side street approach
and a crosswalk across Massachusetts
Avenue on the south side of the
intersection. Vehicle traffic at the
intersection is controlled by a STOP sign
on the Garfield Street approach. The
crosswalk across Mass Ave is
supplemented by a flashing pedestrian
beacon, with flashing lights located on
both sides of the roadway as well as on
the median. The beacon is pushbutton
activated to warn drivers of pedestrians
crossing the roadway.
While the Garfield Street crosswalk is not
controlled by a signal, signalized crossing
opportunities are provided 400 feet to the
north at Linnaean Street and 700 feet to
the south at Wendell/Shepard Streets.
If traffic signal control were to be provided
at this crosswalk, it would be through a full
traffic signal controlling all approaches to
the intersection. Installation of a
Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon (HAWK Signal)

at this location would likely cause confusion for drivers approaching from Garfield
Street, who would not be provided with signal indications and may be confused as to
whether they may proceed.
Installation of a new traffic signal is guided by a warrant analysis per criteria set forth in
the federal Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2009 Edition. There are 9
warrants based on a combination of safety criteria and the volume of roadway users.
Our warrant analysis showed the following results for the Garfield Street intersection:
•

•

•
•

•
•
•

•
•

Warrant 1 – ✅ Met – Eight Hour Vehicular Volume
o The traffic volumes show this warrant to be met for a total of 8 hours of
the day.
Warrant 2 – ✅ Met– Four Hour Vehicular Volume
o The traffic volumes show this warrant to be met for a total of 6 hours of
the day.
Warrant 3 – ❌ Not Met – Peak Hour Vehicular Volume
o Not applicable at this location
Warrant 4 – ❌ Not Met – Pedestrian Volume
o Pedestrian volume crossing Mass Ave does not meet the minimum
threshold of 107 pedestrians per hour during any time period.
Warrant 5 – ❌ Not Met – School Crossing
o Not applicable – nearest school is not proximate
Warrant 6 – ❌ Not Met – Coordinated Signal System
o Not applicable at this location
Warrant 7 – ❌ Not Met – Crash Experience
o This warrant requires five or more reported crashes, of types
susceptible to correction with a traffic signal, within a 12 month period.
Crash data from Cambridge police show an average of three crashes
per year at the intersection.
Warrant 8 – ❌ Not Met – Roadway Network
o Not applicable at this location
Warrant 9 – ❌ Not Met – Intersection Near a Railroad Crossing
o Not applicable at this location

The analysis indicates that the installation of a traffic signal would be warranted
based on the volume of vehicles at the intersection. Careful consideration must be
given to the potential changes to traffic patterns in the adjacent neighborhood that
may result from installation of a new signal. Improvement to the access to Mass
Ave from Garfield Street would likely attract a significant number of diverted vehicle
trips from other adjacent roadways.
Based on other recent projects in Cambridge, we expect that the cost for
construction of a new traffic signal would be approximately $250,000 to $300,000,
and would thus require an appropriation of capital funds.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-153, regarding plans designed to mitigate the
impact of the closing of Windsor House on Cambridge seniors, Assistant City Manager for
Human Services Ellen Semonoff, reports the following:
New Communities Services, the parent organization for Windsor House Adult Day Health, made
the difficult decision to close Windsor House effective at the end of December 2019 because of
the significant gap between the state funding for adult day health and the cost of providing
quality care. Many adult day health programs around the state have closed and Windsor House
itself had consolidated its programs over the last several years at the Senior Center. New
Communities Services made efforts to find an alternative service provider to takeover the
service, but no other provider was interested in taking on the operation.
The Windsor House staff have worked closely with the state Department of Public Health and
with the families and caregivers of all participants. All 21 of the Cambridge participants have
been successfully assisted in finding alternative placements, most in Arlington and Everett. The
26 participants from other communities are also in the process of finding new placements.
Because of a change in the Mass Health requirements for Adult Day Health, it was very
complicated and time consuming to transfer clients from one Mass Health approved program to
another. The Windsor House staff have worked tirelessly to support their long-time participants
in accessing new placements.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
Re: Surveillance Use Policy and Related Documents
Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge
Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting the following to the City Council for review
and discussion at the December 9, 2019 Council Meeting:
•
•
•

A proposed Surveillance Use Policy, which has been approved by the City Solicitor and
the City Manager and requires Council approval;
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, describing Surveillance Technologies which
are subject to the Ordinance, which require Council approval; and
An Annual Surveillance Report compiled from Department-specific Annual
Surveillance Reports concerning the Surveillance Technologies used by those City
departments since December 10, 2018, which requires Council approval.

The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, the Information Technology
Department, the Police Department and all other City departments have worked to complete
these materials for submission to the City Council. Since this is my first submission to the City
Council under the Ordinance, I am also providing background information on the compliance
process which the City Council may find helpful.
Background
The Ordinance was adopted by the City Council on December 10, 2018, after extensive
work between the City Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts
(“ACLUM”), Cambridge residents, and City staff. The Ordinance regulates Surveillance
Technology that may be acquired or used by the City and balances the right to privacy with the
need to promote and ensure safety and security. The Ordinance also provides for informed
public discussion about Surveillance Technologies and any impacts they have on the civil rights
and liberties of individuals, communities and groups in the City.
Surveillance Ordinance Requirements
The Ordinance addresses the following key components:

Packet Pg. 90

Attachment: Surveillance Ordinance_All Submissions_Cover Letter 120919 (CMA 2019 #319 : Surveillance Use Policy and related documents)

2.2.a

•

•

•

•

A Surveillance Use Policy, applicable to each City department that possesses or uses
Surveillance Technology or foresees doing so in the near future. The Surveillance Use
Policy must be approved by the City Solicitor and the City Manager and submitted by the
City Manager to the City Council for review and approval.
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, which relate to specific Surveillance
Technologies, must be submitted by the City Manager to the City Council before the City
seeks funds for or acquires Surveillance Technology, uses Surveillance Technology in a
way not previously approved by the City Council, or enters into an agreement to share
Surveillance Technology or the Surveillance Data it gathers with a non-City entity.
An Annual Surveillance Report, submitted by the City Manager to the City Council,
pertaining to each City department whose use of Surveillance Technology has been
previously approved by the City Council in the past year. The first Annual Surveillance
Report is due to the City Council by December 10, 2019. In 2020, and annually
thereafter, the Report is due by March 1.
The City Council must hold a meeting by May 31 of each year to discuss the City’s
Annual Surveillance Reports and must also release a public report summarizing the
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports received by the City Council during the prior
year.

Timing & Content of the Attached Surveillance Use Policy and Reports
The Ordinance requires the City Manager to submit a proposed Surveillance Use Policy
within 180 days after its effective date. The Ordinance took effect on September 10, 2019.
Therefore, a proposed Surveillance Use Policy is due to be submitted to the City Council by
March 8, 2020. Because the first Annual Surveillance Report, which is due to the City Council
by December 10, 2019, assumes the existence of a Surveillance Use Policy, I am transmitting a
proposed Surveillance Use Policy at this time, along with the Surveillance Technology Impact
Reports and Annual Surveillance Report, for the Council’s review and approval.
•

•

•

Specifically, the proposed Surveillance Use Policy includes the following five (5)
appendices:
o Appendix A–a form for City departments’ internal report to the City Solicitor of
technologies that may be Surveillance Technology as defined in the Ordinance.
o Appendix B–a Surveillance Technology Impact Report form.
o Appendix C–an Annual Surveillance Report form.
o Appendix D–a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Report form.
o Appendix E–a checklist for City departments and Compliance Officers to use as a
guide when completing the above-referenced forms.
The attached Surveillance Technology Impact Reports completed by City departments
relate to existing Surveillance Technology covered by the Ordinance. Therefore, the
dates and costs listed are the original deployment dates and known costs.
As this is the first submission of an Annual Surveillance Report under the Ordinance, the
attached Annual Surveillance Report for this year to date does not include information

regarding complaints about Surveillance Technology or about violations of the
Surveillance Use Policy.
Department Compliance Process
For each Surveillance Technology that was determined to be subject to the Ordinance,
Department Heads were asked to review and confirm the applicability of the Ordinance to such
Surveillance Technologies, complete a Surveillance Technology Impact Report, and complete an
Annual Surveillance Report. The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, and the IT
Department worked with each department to review all technologies that potentially fall under
the Ordinance and to ensure that each department’s submission was complete.
Continued Compliance
The City Solicitor will coordinate further trainings to ensure continued compliance with
the Surveillance Ordinance:
• Compliance Officers. Each Department that currently possesses Surveillance
Technology and any Department that seeks to acquire Surveillance Technology in the
future must designate a Compliance Officer. As further explained in the Surveillance
Use Policy, the Compliance Officer will oversee record-keeping within their department
in order to ensure that the department complies with the Ordinance and the Surveillance
Use Policy.
• Training. The Law Department has held several meetings with other City departments
in order to familiarize City staff with the provisions of the Ordinance, the proposed
Surveillance Use Policy, and the types of Surveillance Technologies that must be
reported to the City Council under the Ordinance. I will continue to work with City
departments to continue training about the Ordinance and the Surveillance Use Policy for
City staff.
I respectfully request that the City Council approve the attached proposed Surveillance
Use Policy as well as the Surveillance Technology Impact Reports and the Annual Surveillance
Report that I have also submitted herewith.
I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the December 9, 2019
City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.

Oversight.

The Department Head of each City department which currently possesses, uses or
anticipates seeking to acquire or use Surveillance Technology shall submit to the City Manager
the name of a designated Compliance Officer assigned by the Department Head to keep and
maintain records on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data by
that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data to ensure that the
requirements of the Ordinance and this Policy are followed.
The Department Head or Compliance Officer for that City department shall be
responsible for internal record keeping on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or
Surveillance Data by that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data, to
ensure compliance with this Policy.
A. Data Collection.
Surveillance Technology produces Surveillance Data upon which the City relies for
governmental functions. It is the policy of the City to ensure that the Surveillance Technology it
uses collects no more Surveillance Data than is necessary to achieve the specific, authorized
purposes of that particular Surveillance Technology.
In accordance with the Ordinance, the City has reviewed all of the Surveillance
Technology currently in use by City departments as of the Effective Date. The Surveillance
Technology, the departments that use or propose to acquire or use the Surveillance Technology,
the purposes for which the particular Surveillance Technology is used, the nature of the
Surveillance Data the Surveillance Technology collects, and information as to whether the
minimum amount of Surveillance Data necessary is being collected, shall be submitted in a
report to the City Manager by each Department Head for each City department which uses or
proposes to use Surveillance Technology. If any employee, agent, or contractor of any City
department becomes aware of any inaccuracies concerning the use of Surveillance Technology
or Surveillance Data that is collected by a department’s Surveillance Technology other than as
outlined in that City department’s report to the City Manager, that employee, agent, or contractor
is required to immediately report the collection of such Surveillance Data or use of such
Surveillance Technology to the department’s Compliance Officer, the Department Head, the City
Manager, the City Solicitor, or the Personnel Director.
B. Data Protection.
No Surveillance Data shall be stored, accessed, or transmitted without proper encryption,
access and password controls, and access-oversight approved by the City’s Chief Information

Officer or his/her designee in the Information Technology Department (“ITD”). Each City
department’s Compliance Officer shall complete and submit to ITD a list of each type of
Surveillance Technology currently used by that department, the Surveillance data it collects, the
staff who have access to the Surveillance Data, and all other information required under
Subsection A above. ITD shall ensure that proper procedures are in place to protect all
Surveillance Data. In the event that any department is, in the judgment of ITD, unable to
implement the security measures necessary to adequately protect Surveillance Data, ITD shall
immediately contact the City Manager and the City Solicitor, and propose additional measures to
protect Surveillance Data from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure.
C. Data Access.
City employees may only have access to Surveillance Data when such access is necessary
for their official duties. The Department Head or Compliance Officer of each City department
shall report to ITD, the City Manager and the City Solicitor, the name of each employee,
contractor, or other agent that requires access to Surveillance Data. The Department Head or
Compliance Officer shall state the specific Surveillance Data to which each individual may have
access. The City may, at any time, with or without notice to the individual, terminate any
individual’s access to Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data.
D. Data Retention.
Surveillance Data will not be maintained any longer than is necessary to achieve its
approved purpose(s), provided that the City will retain Surveillance Data for the periods required
by the Massachusetts Public Records Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10, the Massachusetts Municipal
Records Retention Schedule, or any other applicable laws or regulations.
Exceptions to the Massachusetts Municipal Records Retention Schedule may be
requested from the Commonwealth by the City Solicitor at the request of a Department Head as
follows:
1. A Department Head may seek exceptions for a particular type of Surveillance Data by
seeking the exception explicitly in a Surveillance Technology Impact Report or
Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy; or
2. A Department Head may seek an exception for a particular type of Surveillance Data
from the City Manager on a case-by-case basis.
All exceptions and the reasons therefor shall be included in a department’s Annual
Surveillance Report.

Public and Third-Party Access.

The City shall comply with its obligations pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records
Law, (G. L. c. 4, § 7 cl. 26, and G. L. c. 66, § 10 et seq.), Chapter 2.126 of the Cambridge
Municipal Code (the “Open Data Ordinance”), and any other applicable law, regulation, or order
of a court or state or federal administrative agency of competent jurisdiction that requires the
disclosure of particular Surveillance Data.
The City’s intent is to make as much information as possible available to the public
without compromising the privacy of any Identifiable Individual(s), as defined in Section
2.128.020(C) of the Ordinance. The City shall, to the extent possible and permitted in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, anonymize, aggregate, and/or geomask
Surveillance Data where necessary to protect the privacy of Identifiable Individuals. While some
data may not on its own reveal the personal information of Identifiable Individuals, when
combined with other data it may reveal information that would otherwise be exempt from
disclosure by law. In the event that a City employee suspects that the release of data would
present such a risk, the employee shall report that risk to the Department Head or the
Compliance Officer for that employee’s department and the Department Head or the Compliance
Officer shall contact the City Manager and City Solicitor requesting a legal opinion from the
City Solicitor as to whether the data is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law or
other applicable law or regulation.
Surveillance Data may only be accessed by authorized City employees, as described in
Section IV(C) above, and may only be distributed to third parties in accordance with this Section
V of this Policy. However, any department may share Surveillance Data with the Police
Department under Exigent Circumstances.
VI.

Training.

Upon beginning employment or within a reasonable time after commencing employment,
any City employees or City contractor who will be involved in the collection of Surveillance
Data or use of Surveillance Technology will be given a copy of the Surveillance Ordinance and
this Policy for their review and trained by their Department Head, supervisor, or other
appropriate person assigned to conduct such trainings in ensuring that the activities to be
performed by that staff or contractor comply with the Surveillance Ordinance and this Policy.

“Impact” in this context may mean that a population is disproportionately the target of a
Surveillance Technology, disproportionately penalized as a result of the City’s use of a
Surveillance Technology, or disproportionately excluded from reaping the benefits of the
City’s use of a Surveillance Technology.
Pay particular attention to low-income communities, communities of color, or any
community that is marginalized in the City. If any disproportionality exists, explain either the
department’s proposed remedy or why the disproportionality is appropriate. Use quantitative
data whenever possible. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. Of the 1,000 vehicles
stopped due to use of ALPRs, 400 were driven by African-Americans and 200 were driven
by Hispanics. This is significantly disproportionate to the population of Cambridge. The
department will adjust patrols in order to ensure that ALPRs are not deployed
disproportionately in communities inhabited by African-American and Hispanic residents.”

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Description
With the alarming news that Eversource has reached maximum capacity in Cambridge for its
electrical infrastructure and is moving ahead with transfer station expansions at Alewife and
Putnam Ave, as well as planning a new transfer station in East Cambridge, at Fulkerson St., it’s
becoming glaringly obvious that our planning and approval processes for large developments in
the city do not fully account for the utility infrastructure needs of additional buildings. Upon
reviewing the zoning code we determined that the following changes may begin to address this
concern, and so we put them forward as a proposal for consideration by the council.
ADD TO Section 19.24: This section outlines the application procedures for large projects,
which require a Project Review Special Permit. It lists requirements such as a parking study, a
tree study, sewer and water infrastructure narratives, and a noise mitigation narrative. So it
seems relevant and appropriate to add requirements to this section around electrical service
infrastructure and gas service infrastructure narratives, which is what we have proposed below.
ADD TO Section 19.25.2: Add a “project specific urban design overview” requirement. This
requires a project specific urban design analysis and set of recommendations that are
presented to the planning board and the public.
ADD Section 19.25.3: Utility Impact Findings. This section requires the planning board to grant
the permit only if it finds that the utility impacts of the project would not be significant.
We further recommend that if these provisions are adopted, the application form be changed via
regulation to add the following requirements:
Electricity Service Infrastructure Narrative Project Review Special Permit (19.20)
(certified by Electrical Dept.)
Gas Service Infrastructure Narrative Project Review Special Permit (19.20) D
(certified by Dept. of Public Works)

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 8 DISTRICT

13.101

Purpose. The PUD-8 District is intended to provide for the creation of a vibrant mixed-use
district of high quality general and technical office and lab use, active commercial use,
including retail, fitness and restaurant, components of residential use and enhancement of
open space to serve residents of the District and the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as
workers, students and visitors. The PUD-8 District encourages strong connections between
the neighborhoods of eastern Cambridge and new development in that area, particularly along
First Street, the East Cambridge riverfront (focusing on Lechmere Canal) and the PUD-8
area. It also promotes retail- and service-oriented ground floors that will activate surrounding
public streets and spaces, such as First Street and Lechmere Canal Park. The expectation is
for the District to continue to be a recognizable center of activity and economic viability for
East Cambridge and the surrounding neighborhoods in light of the changing landscape of
brick and mortar retail. Development in the PUD-8 District is expected to meet high
standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental sustainability and open space
design. To the extent reasonably practicable and subject to the provisions of Section 13.107.5
below, new buildings shall be generally consistent with the policy objectives set forth in the
Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001, the guidance provided in the Eastern
Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan
dated May 1978, the East Cambridge Development Review Process and Guidelines dated
June, 1985 and the Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011.
PUD-8 Special Permit.
Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.100, an applicant
may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the Planning Board
approving a Final Development Plan for the Development Parcel located within the PUD-8
District which, at the time of application for a PUD-8 Special Permit, (i) contains at least
100,000 sf of retail and/or restaurant space on the ground-floor allowed pursuant to a valid
special permit under the PUD-4 District, (ii) contains at least 7.5 acres in area and (iii) is
within 600 feet of 3 acres of Public Open Space. The Development Parcel within the PUD-8
District may contain contiguous or noncontiguous lots elsewhere in the PUD-8 District or
within another PUD District that are situated within twelve hundred (1200) feet of the
boundaries of the PUD-8 District.
PUD-8 Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-8 Special Permit
approving a Final Development Plan for the Development Parcel upon finding that the Final
Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, all other criteria applicable
to approval of any other special permits being sought, and upon consideration of the PUD-8
Guidelines and Principles (as hereinafter defined). Any modification to a Final Development
Plan, the need for which arises for any reason, shall require a major or minor amendment in
accordance with Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance and the provisions of the PUD-8

13.102.3

Special Permit. A PUD-8 Special Permit approving a Final Development Plan may specify a
range of modifications that may be approved as minor amendments to the PUD-8 Special
Permit, which are subject only to written approval of the Planning Board, if such
modifications are found by the Planning Board not to significantly alter the concept of the
approved PUD-8 Special Permit.
PUD-8 Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel, the locations of
streets and open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, and general PUD-8 lots,

13.102.8

bounded by other lots or by streets, and which is designated by the developer thereof to be
used, developed or built upon as a unit.
Condominium Property Regime. Nothing in this Section 13.100 shall prevent a developer
from submitting a building(s) subject to a PUD-8 Special Permit to a condominium property
regime. The violation of the conditions of a PUD-8 Special Permit by one owner or occupant
of a condominium unit within a development shall not be deemed to be a violation by any
other owner or occupant within the development, but shall be deemed to be a violation by the
owner or occupant of the condominium unit(s)/premises violating the conditions of the PUD8 Special Permit. Nothing herein shall limit the rights of a condominium association against a
violating owner or occupant.
Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. The requirements of this Section
13.100 may be satisfied for the entire Development Parcel on any lot(s) located within the
limits of such Development Parcel or, with respect to Section 13.105 (Open Space), on other
land within 1,000 feet of the PUD-8 District; provided, however, the requirements of this
Section 13.100 shall not be applied to individual PUD-8 lots or ownership units comprising

conforming PUD-8 lot whether or not such Development Parcel is in single or multiple
ownership. A violation, with respect to an individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the
Development Parcel, of any provision of this Section 13.100 shall not constitute a violation
with respect to any other individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development
Parcel.
Phasing Plan and Lapse. Any development within the Development Parcel shall
commence and, to the extent built in multiple phases over a period of time, be constructed in
accordance with the time limits set forth in the Final Development Plan. Any changes to the
Phasing Plan after issuance of the PUD-8 Special Permit are subject only to written approval
by the Planning Board.

In no event shall any portion of the development approved by a PUD-8 Special Permit for
which a building permit has been issued and construction has commenced be deemed to have
lapsed due to the fact that any other phase of the development approved by a PUD-8 special
permit has not been commenced or completed.
13.102.9 Relationship to PUD-4. With respect to the Development Parcel, the rights granted
pursuant to a PUD-8 Special Permit shall be in addition to any rights previously granted
under a PUD-4 special permit and the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern with respect to
such additional rights. The previously issued PUD-4 special permit shall remain valid and in
full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, any remaining land outside of the
Development Parcel subject thereto, provided that the terms of such PUD-4 special permit
shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any rights granted to the
Development Parcel pursuant to the PUD-8 Special Permit.
To the extent the Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or more PUD
District(s), special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the
issuance date of a PUD-8 Special Permit granted hereunder and the provisions of such PUD
District(s) or existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-8 Special Permit,
the provisions of the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern.

13.107
13.107.1

In approving a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board may waive any maximum
parking requirements applicable in the PUD-8 District and the underlying Zoning District.
Shared Parking Study. A Development Proposal for development in the PUD-8 District
shall include an analysis of existing and anticipated parking demand for all uses in the
development throughout the course of a typical day and week. The purpose of this analysis is
to consider parking demands for different land uses that have peak parking demands at
different times of day, thus enabling parking facilities to be used more efficiently.
Accordingly, this analysis may identify opportunities for reducing the total amount of parking
required to serve all uses through the sharing of parking spaces by multiple uses. Based on
this analysis, the Planning Board, with guidance from City staff, may approve a reduced
minimum or maximum parking requirement upon finding that the approved amount of
parking will be sufficient to serve all permitted uses. This analysis may be approved by the
Planning Board as a working study that can be adjusted by written approval of the Planning
Board over time, as dictated by changes in parking demands.
Loading. The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may waive any
requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities within the PUD-8
Development Parcel, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across various uses and
PUD-8 lots within the PUD-8 District or adjacent PUD-4 Districts.
Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 of this
Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the requirements

The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings within an
approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall incorporate best practices
in the following areas:
(a)
Energy and Emissions. Each new or renovated building must conserve building
energy and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer, with
each new or renovated building within the PUD-8 District, will evaluate the potential for
implementation of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include
rooftop solar pv) within the PUD-8 District in the context of ownership, economic viability
and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas emissions analysis for
each new or renovated building and will implement energy efficiency mitigation for such
building to achieve the maximum energy reductions possible identified in such analysis.
(b) Urban Site and Landscaping; Water Management. The Developer, for each new building,
must explore opportunities for potable water use reductions and the ability to enhance
indigenous plantings in and around the development site.
(c) Cool Roofs. All new buildings approved in the PUD-8 District must employ Functional
Green Roofs (as such term is defined in Article 22.000 of this Zoning Ordinance), highalbedo “white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing system.
(d) Monitoring. All new buildings in the PUD-8 District shall be required to conform to the
requirements of the Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance, Chapter 8.67 of
the Municipal Code.
(e) Healthy Living and Working. All new buildings in the PUD-8 District shall provide
people with access to daylight and enhance the visual and thermal comfort of people living
within the PUD-8 District.
(f) Transportation. Final Development Plans within the PUD-8 District shall encourage
multimodal transportation, provide facilities for cyclists and provide an infrastructure to
support alternative energy vehicles.
(g) Flood Resiliency. All new buildings must incorporate the City of Cambridge’s most upto-date standards to address projected future flooding impacts.
(h) Site Cooling Strategies. Final Development Plans within the PUD-8 District shall
incorporate measures to reduce urban heat island effects and identify interior and exterior
spaces in designated locations to act as cooling areas.
13.107.5

PUD-8 Design Guidelines and Principles.
(a)
To the extent reasonably practicable, new buildings constructed within the PUD-8
District shall be generally consistent with: (i) the policy objectives set forth in the Eastern
Packet Pg. 256

2.5

Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001; (ii) the guidance provided in the Eastern
Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; (iii) the East Cambridge Riverfront
Plan dated May 1978; (iv) the East Cambridge Development Review Process and Guidelines
dated June, 1985; and ( v) the Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011 (collectively, the
“PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles”); provided, however, that the provisions of this Section
13.100 shall govern with respect to process, uses, density, open space and streetwalls, and
new buildings constructed within the PUD-8 District shall be generally consistent with the
following provisions in lieu of the provisions pertaining to height, setback, stepbacks and
materials in the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles:
i.

Height and Setbacks: A diversity of height and massing as permitted in Section
13.104.3 is encouraged to be located in buildings immediately fronting on First
Street, Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard and designed to create a rich
and varied skyline along streets abutting the Development Parcel.
1. Buildings fronting on First Street are encouraged to establish a recognizable
base, activated by commercial, residential, retail, dining and entertainment
uses, of a scale and proportion to support an active, pedestrian-oriented
public realm.
2. New buildings fronting on First Street will enhance the public realm by
providing a setback of at least 10 feet or more as may be necessary to
provide a sidewalk that allows comfortable pedestrian circulation in
addition to street furniture, bicycle parking, tree plantings and other
streetscape features.
Bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other
architectural elements may project 5 feet into this setback zone, beginning at
the second floor, to establish scale compatible with the neighboring
structures and to modulate the massing of the buildings so that they are read
as distinct and individual buildings.
3. Buildings along First Street are encouraged to create separation between
buildings and to adopt massing strategies within the building facades to
create visual interest on the street.
4. Mechanical penthouses, attic stories and other architectural treatments will
be utilized to create tops to the buildings that will contribute to a varied
skyline and unique reading of each building.
5. Maintaining the existing pedestrian atrium, which provides a connection
between Charles Park and Lechmere Canal Park, at its height as of the
effective date of the enactment of this Section 13.100 is encouraged.

ii.

Stepbacks.
1. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that exceed 85 feet in
height shall provide (a) a 10-foot stepback of the building façade at an
elevation of approximately 65 feet in height and (b) a 10-foot stepback of
the building façade at an elevation of approximately 135 feet in height (if
applicable), provided in each case that bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and
other architectural elements may project 5 feet into this stepback zone to
establish scale compatible with the neighboring structures, and to modulate
the massing of the buildings so that they are read as distinct and individual
buildings.
2. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that do not exceed 85
feet in height are encouraged to provide a distinct horizontal articulation at a
datum height of approximately 65 feet, through means other than a stepback
Packet Pg. 257

2.5

(significant change in material, projecting cornice/fin/shade, etc.).
3. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District shall provide a 15foot stepback of the rooftop mechanical penthouses.
iii.

Building Spacing: New buildings shall be designed to provide for appropriate
spacing to preserve adequate light, air and view corridors for the benefit of the
East Cambridge neighborhood. New buildings should, to the extent feasible, be
separated by courtyards or other significant breaks to avoid long lengths of
unbroken building mass. Along First Street, such breaks should be aligned with
Spring and Hurley Streets to the extent possible.

iv.

Materials and Details: A diverse and varied use of finishes and façade elements
is encouraged in new and renovated buildings to further contribute to the
reading of individual buildings along First Street, Cambridgeside Place and
Land Boulevard. Individual, architecturally expressive buildings may be
supported if they are positive additions to the East Cambridge neighborhood.
1. Exterior finishes may include high quality, durable, warm, rich and varied
materials such as, but not limited to, brick, terra cotta, natural and cast stone,
and, to a lesser extent, pre-cast and high performance concrete panels and
cast shapes and curtain wall recognizing that the base of the buildings will be
primarily masonry and glass.
2. A variety of exterior façade elements may be incorporated to create visual
texture and interest, including bays, residential balconies, fixed or operable
windows, roof decks, terraces, shutters and shading devices.

(b)
In its approval of a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board may (i) make a
determination that one or more provisions of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles are
inapplicable to new buildings to be constructed within the PUD-8 District, or (ii) waive or
modify any provisions of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles set forth above upon making a
determination that such waiver or modification maintains an architectural character consistent
with the planning and design goals of this Section 13.107.5.
13.107.6

Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated December 4, 2019 by Stephen R.
Karp is incorporated herein by reference and made part of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance
and shall be binding upon New England Development and CambridgeSide Galleria
Associated and its successors and assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of
Commitment are inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 13.100, the more stringent
provisions shall govern.

IN CITY COUNCIL
December 16, 2019
MAYOR MCGOVERN
COUNCILLOR KELLEY
COUNCILLOR SIDDIQUI
WHEREAS:

The City Council passed Chapter 2.128 Surveillance Technology Ordinance on
December 10, 2018, which imposed a requirement that the City Manager seek approval
from the City Council prior to acquiring or using certain surveillance technology,
including Biometric Surveillance Technology and facial recognition software and
databases; and

WHEREAS:

Notwithstanding this existing check on the City’s authority to acquire and use face
recognition technology or data derived thereof, the potential threats to residents’ civil
rights and civil liberties that are unique to face recognition technology warrant its
outright ban; and

WHEREAS:

Facial recognition software can discriminate based on classes like race and gender; a
2018 report out of the MIT Media Lab and Microsoft “Gender Shades: Intersectional
Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification” found that while the
“maximum error rate for lighter-skinned makes is 0.8%” in commercial gender
classification systems, “darker skinned females are the most misclassified group (with
error rates up to 34.7%);” and

WHEREAS:

The use of face recognition technology can have a chilling effect on the exercise of
constitutionally protected free speech, with the technology being used in China to
target ethnic minorities, and in the United States, it was used by police agencies in
Baltimore, Maryland, to target activists in the aftermath of Freddie Gray’s death; and

WHEREAS:

State Representative Dave Rogers (whose district includes parts of Cambridge) has
filed legislation that would impose a moratorium on face recognition technology, and
as recently as Thursday, July 25, 2019, Representative Ayanna Pressley introduced a
bill before Congress that would:
1. Prohibit the use of biometric recognition technology in public and assisted
housing units funded under HUD; and
2. Require HUD to submit a report to Congress that provides analysis on any
known use of facial recognition technologies in public housing units; the impact
of emerging technologies on tenants; the purpose of installing the technologies
in the units; demographic information of impacted tenants, and; the impact of
emerging technologies on vulnerable communities in public housing, including
tenant privacy, civil rights and fair housing includes HUD federally assisted
rental dwelling units;

Packet Pg. 287

2.6

WHEREAS:

Three cities have already banned the use of facial recognition technology by municipal
authorities, including San Francisco, Oakland (CA), and next door in Somerville; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached amendment to Chapter 2.128 Surveillance Ordinance Technology be
forwarded to the Public Safety Committee for a hearing as soon as possible.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 8 DISTRICT

13.101

Purpose. The PUD-8 District is intended to provide for the creation of a vibrant mixeduse district of high quality general and technical office and lab use, active commercial
use, including retail, fitness and restaurant, components of residential use and
enhancement of open space to serve residents of the District and the surrounding
neighborhoods, as well as workers, students and visitors. The PUD-8 District
encourages strong connections between the neighborhoods of eastern Cambridge and
new development in that area, particularly along First Street, the East Cambridge
riverfront (focusing on Lechmere Canal) and the PUD-8 area. It also promotes retailand service-oriented ground floors that will activate surrounding public streets and
spaces, such as First Street and Lechmere Canal Park. The expectation is for the District
to continue to be a recognizable center of activity and economic viability for East
Cambridge and the surrounding neighborhoods in light of the changing landscape of
brick and mortar retail. Development in the PUD-8 District is expected to meet high
standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental sustainability and open
space design. To the extent reasonably practicable and subject to the provisions of
Section 13.107.5 below, new buildings shall be generally consistent with the policy
objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001, the
guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15,
2001, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May 1978, the East Cambridge
Development Review Process and Guidelines dated June, 1985 and the Cambridge
Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011.

13.102

PUD-8 Special Permit.

13.102.1 Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.100, an
applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for the Development Parcel
located within the PUD-8 District which, at the time of application for a PUD-8 Special
Permit, (i) contains at least 100,000 sf of retail and/or restaurant space on the groundfloor allowed pursuant to a valid special permit under the PUD-4 District, (ii) contains
at least 7.5 acres in area and (iii) is within 600 feet of 3 acres of Public Open Space.
The Development Parcel within the PUD-8 District may contain contiguous or
noncontiguous lots elsewhere in the PUD-8 District or within another PUD District that
are situated within twelve hundred (1200) feet of the boundaries of the PUD-8 District.
13.102.2 PUD-8 Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-8 Special
Permit approving a Final Development Plan for the Development Parcel upon finding
that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, all other
criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought, and upon
consideration of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles (as hereinafter defined). Any
modification to a Final Development Plan, the need for which arises for any reason,
shall require a major or minor amendment in accordance with Section 12.37 of this
Zoning Ordinance and the provisions of the PUD-8 Special Permit. A PUD-8 Special
Permit approving a Final Development Plan may specify a range of modifications that
may be approved as minor amendments to the PUD-8 Special Permit, which are subject

functions such as retail establishments and other active uses, and residential and office
lobbies at the ground floor of each building in the Development Parcel, as well as the
locations and anticipated sizes of Active Uses that may be required by the specific
provisions of this Section 13.100 and strategies for programming and activating those
spaces.
(g)
Housing Plan — providing the approximate number and mix of housing unit
types proposed on the residential site, and identifying the anticipated location of
dwelling units that may be required by specific provisions of this Section 13.100.

accordance with the City’s ongoing planning efforts and current Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection standards.
(i)
Demonstrating a commitment to implementing a Transportation Demand
Management and Mitigation Program consistent with the reduced parking mandated in
this PUD zoning and the capacity limitations of the transportation network that serves
the area, including roadways and public transportation systems. In approving a Final
Development Plan, the Planning Board shall refer to Article 18.000 and Section 19.20
of this Zoning Ordinance, plans and guidelines applicable to the PUD-8 District, and
consider other City transportation planning efforts for the surrounding area (including
the Kendall Square Mobility Task Force and Cambridge Bicycle Plan, with a particular
focus on initiatives to improve north-south connections along First Street), and may

13.102.5 PUD-8 Lot. A lot within the PUD-8 District is a parcel of land that may be in more
than one ownership, provided that the developer thereof has control over the entirety
of the parcel, whether via fee ownership, long-term lease or enforceable easement
rights, which parcel is bounded by other lots or by streets, and which is designated by
the developer thereof to be used, developed or built upon as a unit.
13.102.6 Condominium Property Regime. Nothing in this Section 13.100 shall prevent a
developer from submitting a building(s) subject to a PUD-8 Special Permit to a
condominium property regime. The violation of the conditions of a PUD-8 Special
Permit by one owner or occupant of a condominium unit within a development shall
not be deemed to be a violation by any other owner or occupant within the development,
but shall be deemed to be a violation by the owner or occupant of the condominium
unit(s)/premises violating the conditions of the PUD-8 Special Permit. Nothing herein
shall limit the rights of a condominium association against a violating owner or
occupant.
13.102.7 Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. The requirements of this
Section 13.100 may be satisfied for the entire Development Parcel on any lot(s) located

requirements of this Section 13.100 shall not be applied to individual PUD-8 lots or
ownership units comprising such Development Parcel, but shall be applied as if such
Development Parcel were a single conforming PUD-8 lot whether or not such
Development Parcel is in single or multiple ownership. A violation, with respect to an
individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any
provision of this Section 13.100 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any other
individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel.
13.102.8 Phasing Plan and Lapse. Any development within the Development Parcel shall
commence and, to the extent built in multiple phases over a period of time, be
constructed in accordance with the time limits set forth in the Final Development
Plan. Any changes to the Phasing Plan after issuance of the PUD-8 Special Permit are
subject only to written approval by the Planning Board.
In no event shall any portion of the development approved by a PUD-8 Special
Permit for which a building permit has been issued and construction has commenced
be deemed to have lapsed due to the fact that any other phase of the development
approved by a PUD-8 special permit has not been commenced or completed.
13.102.9 Relationship to PUD-4. With respect to the Development Parcel, the rights granted
pursuant to a PUD-8 Special Permit shall be in addition to any rights previously granted
under a PUD-4 special permit and the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern with respect
to such additional rights. The previously issued PUD-4 special permit shall remain
valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, any remaining land
outside of the Development Parcel subject thereto, provided that the terms of such
PUD-4 special permit shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any
rights granted to the Development Parcel pursuant to the PUD-8 Special Permit.
To the extent the Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or more PUD
District(s), special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to
the issuance date of a PUD-8 Special Permit granted hereunder and the provisions of
such PUD District(s) or existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the
PUD-8 Special Permit, the provisions of the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern.
13.102.10 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a Development Proposal, the
developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD Pre-Application
Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance and a similar
conference with the full City Council or Ordinance Committee. The purpose of the
conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site arrangement, building
massing, circulation systems and public space arrangement, as well as general
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the developer to receive
informal feedback from the Planning Board prior to preparing the materials required
by Section 13.102.3 above. As set forth in Section 12.33.2, any statement made by the
Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application Conference shall not be legally
binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3, the developer shall present graphic and
written materials as needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development
alternatives

District.
13.106.5 Shared Parking Study. A Development Proposal for development in the PUD-8 District
shall include an analysis of existing and anticipated parking demand for all uses in the
development throughout the course of a typical day and week. The purpose of this
analysis is to consider parking demands for different land uses that have peak parking
demands at different times of day, thus enabling parking facilities to be used more
efficiently. Accordingly, this analysis may identify opportunities for reducing the total
amount of parking required to serve all uses through the sharing of parking spaces by
multiple uses. Based on this analysis, the Planning Board, with guidance from City
staff, may approve a reduced minimum or maximum parking requirement upon finding
that the approved amount of parking will be sufficient to serve all permitted uses. This
analysis may be approved by the Planning Board as a working study that can be
adjusted by written approval of the Planning Board over time, as dictated by changes
in parking demands.
13.106.6 Loading. The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may waive
any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities within the

fronting on First Street, Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard and
designed to create a rich and varied skyline along streets abutting the
Development Parcel.
1. Buildings fronting on First Street are encouraged to establish a
recognizable base, activated by commercial, residential, retail, dining
and entertainment uses, of a scale and proportion to support an active,
pedestrian-oriented public realm.
2. New buildings fronting on First Street will enhance the public realm
by providing a setback of at least 10 feet or more as may be necessary
to provide a sidewalk that allows comfortable pedestrian circulation in
addition to street furniture, bicycle parking, tree plantings and other
streetscape features. Bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other
architectural elements may project 5 feet into this setback zone,
beginning at the second floor, to establish scale compatible with the
neighboring structures and to modulate the massing of the buildings so
that they are read as distinct and individual buildings.
3. Buildings along First Street are encouraged to create separation
between buildings and to adopt massing strategies within the building
facades to create visual interest on the street.
4. Mechanical penthouses, attic stories and other architectural treatments
will be utilized to create tops to the buildings that will contribute to a
varied skyline and unique reading of each building.
5. Maintaining the existing pedestrian atrium, which provides a connection
between Charles Park and Lechmere Canal Park, at its height as of the
effective date of the enactment of this Section 13.100 is encouraged.
ii.

Stepbacks.
1. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that exceed 85
feet in height shall provide (a) a 10-foot stepback of the building
façade at an elevation of approximately 65 feet in height and (b) a 10foot stepback of the building façade at an elevation of approximately
135 feet in height (if applicable), provided in each case that bays,
balconies, tapers, cornices and other architectural elements may
project 5 feet into this stepback zone to establish scale compatible
with the neighboring structures, and to modulate the massing of the
buildings so that they are read as distinct and individual buildings.
2. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that do not
exceed 85 feet in height are encouraged to provide a distinct
horizontal articulation at a datum height of approximately 65 feet,
through means other than a stepback (significant change in material,

3. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District shall provide a
15-foot stepback of the rooftop mechanical penthouses.
iii.

Building Spacing: New buildings shall be designed to provide for
appropriate spacing to preserve adequate light, air and view corridors for
the benefit of the East Cambridge neighborhood. New buildings should,
to the extent feasible, be separated by courtyards or other significant
breaks to avoid long lengths of unbroken building mass. Along First
Street, such breaks should be aligned with Spring and Hurley Streets to
the extent possible.

iv.

Materials and Details: A diverse and varied use of finishes and façade
elements is encouraged in new and renovated buildings to further
contribute to the reading of individual buildings along First Street,
Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard. Individual, architecturally
expressive buildings may be supported if they are positive additions to the
East Cambridge neighborhood.
1.

Exterior finishes may include high quality, durable, warm, rich and
varied materials such as, but not limited to, brick, terra cotta,
natural and cast stone, and, to a lesser extent, pre-cast and high
performance concrete panels and cast shapes and curtain wall
recognizing that the base of the buildings (which, for this purpose,
shall mean the facade of a building measured from grade to an
elevation of approximately 65 feet in height) will be primarily
masonry and glass.

2.

A variety of exterior façade elements may be incorporated to create
visual texture and interest, including bays, residential balconies,
fixed or operable windows, roof decks, terraces, shutters and
shading devices.

(b)
In its approval of a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board may (i) make a
determination that one or more provisions of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles are
inapplicable to new buildings to be constructed within the PUD-8 District, or (ii) waive
or modify any provisions of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles set forth above upon
making a determination that such waiver or modification maintains an architectural
character consistent with the planning and design goals of this Section 13.107.5.
13.107.6 Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated _____________ by

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 8 DISTRICT

13.101

Purpose. The PUD-8 District is intended to provide for the creation of a vibrant
mixed-use district of high quality general and technical office and lab use, active
commercial use, including retail, fitness and restaurant, components of residential use
and enhancement of open space to serve residents of the District and the surrounding
neighborhoods, as well as workers, students and visitors. The PUD-8 District
encourages strong connections between the neighborhoods of eastern Cambridge and
new development in that area, particularly along First Street, the East Cambridge
riverfront (focusing on Lechmere Canal) and the PUD-8 area. It also promotes retailand service-oriented ground floors that will activate surrounding public streets and
spaces, such as First Street and Lechmere Canal Park. The expectation is for the
District to continue to be a recognizable center of activity and economic viability for
East Cambridge and the surrounding neighborhoods in light of the changing
landscape of brick and mortar retail. Development in the PUD-8 District is expected
to meet high standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental
sustainability and open space design. To the extent reasonably practicable and subject
to the provisions of Section 13.107.5 below, new buildings shall be generally
consistent with the policy objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Planning
Study dated October 2001, the guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design
Guidelines dated October 15, 2001, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May
1978, the East Cambridge Development Review Process and Guidelines dated June,
1985 and the Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011.

PUD-8 District shall be generally consistent with: (i) the policy objectives set forth in
the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001; (ii) the guidance provided
in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; (iii) the East
Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May 1978; and (iv) the East Cambridge
Development Review Process and Guidelines dated June, 1985; and (v) the
Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011 (collectively, the “PUD-8 Guidelines
and Principles”); provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 13.100 shall
govern with respect to process, uses, density, open space and streetwalls, and new
buildings constructed within the PUD-8 District shall be generally consistent with the
following provisions in lieu of the provisions pertaining to height, setback, stepbacks
and materials in the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles:
i.

Height and Setbacks: A diversity of height and massing as permitted in
Section 13.104.3 is encouraged to be located in buildings immediately
fronting on First Street, Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard and
designed to create a rich and varied skyline along streets abutting the
Development Parcel.
1. Buildings fronting on First Street are encouraged to establish a
recognizable base, activated by commercial, residential, retail, dining
and entertainment uses, of a scale and proportion to support an active,
pedestrian-oriented public realm.
2. New buildings fronting on First Street will enhance the public realm
by providing a setback of at least 10 feet or more as may be necessary
to provide a sidewalk that allows comfortable pedestrian circulation
in addition to street furniture, bicycle parking, tree plantings and other
streetscape features. Bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other
architectural elements may project 5 feet into this setback zone,
beginning at the second floor, to establish scale compatible with the
neighboring structures and to modulate the massing of the buildings
so that they are read as distinct and individual buildings.
3. Buildings along First Street are encouraged to create separation
between buildings and to adopt massing strategies within the building
facades to create visual interest on the street.
4. Mechanical penthouses, attic stories and other architectural treatments
will be utilized to create tops to the buildings that will contribute to a
varied skyline and unique reading of each building.

feet in height shall provide (a) a 10-foot stepback of the building
façade at an elevation of approximately 65 feet in height and (b) a
10-foot stepback of the building façade at an elevation of
approximately 135 feet in height (if applicable), provided in each case
that bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other architectural elements
may project 5 feet into this stepback zone to establish scale
compatible with the neighboring structures, and to modulate the
massing of the buildings so that they are read as distinct and
individual buildings.
2. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that do not
exceed 85 feet in height are encouraged to provide a distinct
horizontal articulation at a datum height of approximately 65 feet,
through means other than a stepback (significant change in material,
projecting cornice/fin/shade, etc.).
3. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District shall provide a
15-foot stepback of the rooftop mechanical penthouses.

iii.

Building Spacing: New buildings shall be designed to provide for
appropriate spacing to preserve adequate light, air and view corridors for
the benefit of the East Cambridge neighborhood. New buildings should,
to the extent feasible, be separated by courtyards or other significant
breaks to avoid long lengths of unbroken building mass. Along First
Street, such breaks should be aligned with Spring and Hurley Streets to
the extent possible.

iv.

Materials and Details: A diverse and varied use of finishes and façade
elements is encouraged in new and renovated buildings to further
contribute to the reading of individual buildings along First Street,
Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard. Individual, architecturally
expressive buildings may be supported if they are positive additions to
the East Cambridge neighborhood.

Since his wife Vice Mayor Jan Devereux surprised him by taking a mid-career detour

before the Council, serving as a sounding board with difficult decisions; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council and School Committee recently discussed the Universal PreKindergarten Report, an effort that would cost roughly $20,000,000 annually in
addition to construction costs, as a next step in providing a better education for
children in Cambridge despite the fact that roughly 40% of pre-school (age 4) students
are no longer in CPSD by 4th grade; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge Public School Department (CPSD) efforts, while very well-intentioned, do
not provide an equal education to all children in Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

Racial and ethnic minorities as well as economically disadvantaged students have long
suffered from a massive achievement gap, that has shown no improvement, and a lack
of equity in our current model; and

WHEREAS:

According to CPSD, “achieving racial equity requires proactive and continuous
investment in communities of color” and CPSD is committed to ensuring each student
“will have access to the opportunities, resources, and support they need to attain their
full potential”; and

WHEREAS:

The results of educational investments are unseen when CPSD’s goals expect white
children to outperform black children threefold in 8th grade math scores on the MCAS
(75% for white students, 25% for black students, 30% for economically disadvantaged
in 2020); and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge has immense financial resources, including both Free Cash and
excess tax levy, we could choose to spend to finance educational-related efforts, in and
out of school to help disadvantaged students succeed; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the CPSD
Superintendent to ensure that the CPSD budget is enough to meet the educational
needs of all children in Cambridge rather than a formulaic increase over past CPSD
budgets.

continuing to engage in anti-bias training; and

WHEREAS:

This past May, the City Council adopted a Policy Order asking the City Manager to

officials and members of the City’s administrative team in the first half of 2020; and

This anti-bias training is all the more critical in light of the fact that there shall be new
members joining both the City Council and the School Committee in January, and this

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 8 DISTRICT

13.101

Purpose. The PUD-8 District is intended to provide for the creation of a vibrant
mixed-use district of high quality general and technical office and lab use, active
commercial use, including retail, fitness and restaurant, components of residential use
and enhancement of open space to serve residents of the District and the surrounding
neighborhoods, as well as workers, students and visitors. The PUD-8 District
encourages strong connections between the neighborhoods of eastern Cambridge and
new development in that area, particularly along First Street, the East Cambridge
riverfront (focusing on Lechmere Canal) and the PUD-8 area. It also promotes retailand service-oriented ground floors that will activate surrounding public streets and
spaces, such as First Street and Lechmere Canal Park. The expectation is for the
District to continue to be a recognizable center of activity and economic viability for
East Cambridge and the surrounding neighborhoods in light of the changing
landscape of brick and mortar retail. Development in the PUD-8 District is expected
to meet high standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental
sustainability and open space design. To the extent reasonably practicable and subject
to the provisions of Section 13.107.5 below, new buildings shall be generally
consistent with the policy objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Planning
Study dated October 2001, the guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design
Guidelines dated October 15, 2001, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May
1978, the East Cambridge Development Review Process and Guidelines dated June,
1985 and the Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011.

Nothing herein shall limit the rights of a condominium association against a violating
owner or occupant.
13.102.7

Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. The requirements of this
Section 13.100 may be satisfied for the entire Development Parcel on any lot(s)
located within the limits of such Development Parcel or, with respect to Section
13.105 (Open Space), on other land within 1,000 feet of the PUD-8 District; provided,
however, the requirements of this Section 13.100 shall not be applied to individual
PUD-8 lots or ownership units comprising such Development Parcel, but shall be
applied as if such Development Parcel were a single conforming PUD-8 lot whether
or not such Development Parcel is in single or multiple ownership. A violation, with
respect to an individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel,
of any provision of this Section 13.100 shall not constitute a violation with respect to
any other individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel.

13.102.8

constructed in accordance with the time limits set forth in the Final Development
Plan. Any changes to the Phasing Plan after issuance of the PUD-8 Special Permit are
subject only to written approval by the Planning Board.
In no event shall any portion of the development approved by a PUD-8 Special Permit
for which a building permit has been issued and construction has commenced be
deemed to have lapsed due to the fact that any other phase of the development
approved by a PUD-8 special permit has not been commenced or completed.

13.102.9

Relationship to PUD-4. With respect to the Development Parcel, the rights granted
pursuant to a PUD-8 Special Permit shall be in addition to any rights previously

shall remain valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, any
remaining land outside of the Development Parcel subject thereto, provided that the
terms of such PUD-4 special permit shall be applied to such remaining land without
regard to any rights granted to the Development Parcel pursuant to the PUD-8 Special
Permit.
To the extent the Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or more PUD
District(s), special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to
the issuance date of a PUD-8 Special Permit granted hereunder and the provisions of
such PUD District(s) or existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the
PUD-8 Special Permit, the provisions of the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern.

13.102.10 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a Development Proposal, the
developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD Pre-Application
Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance and a similar

within said area.
13.106.2

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Ordinance shall not
restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that will most
efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all approved uses.

13.106.3

Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the
PUD-8 District; provided, however, in approving a Final Development Plan, the
Planning Board may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review and
analysis of Transportation Impact Studies and other relevant information on parking
demand provided in application documents, including the Shared Parking Study as
required below, and with the guidance of City agencies. The Planning Board, through
its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall make a finding that the Final
Development Plan provides adequate parking for proposed residential uses.

13.106.4

Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a PUD-8 shall be limited by
applying the rates set forth below to each use within the PUD-8 and taking the
summation of the result for all uses. For any use not listed below, the maximum
parking ratio set forth in Article 6.000 shall apply.
(a)
Maximum of 5.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail, consumer service and
restaurant use.
(b)

Maximum of 0.9 spaces per 1,000 square feet of GFA for office use.

(c)

Maximum of 0.8 spaces per 1,000 square feet of GFA for laboratory use

Maximum of 1.0 space per residential dwelling unit.

In approving a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board may waive any maximum
parking requirements applicable in the PUD-8 District and the underlying Zoning
District.
13.106.5

Shared Parking Study. A Development Proposal for development in the PUD-8
District shall include an analysis of existing and anticipated parking demand for all
uses in the development throughout the course of a typical day and week. The purpose
of this analysis is to consider parking demands for different land uses that have peak
parking demands at different times of day, thus enabling parking facilities to be used
more efficiently. Accordingly, this analysis may identify opportunities for reducing
the total amount of parking required to serve all uses through the sharing of parking
spaces by multiple uses. Based on this analysis, the Planning Board, with guidance
from City staff, may approve a reduced minimum or maximum parking requirement
upon finding that the approved amount of parking will be sufficient to serve all
permitted uses. This analysis may be approved by the Planning Board as a working

(a)
To the extent reasonably practicable, new buildings constructed within the
PUD-8 District shall be generally consistent with: (i) the policy objectives set forth in
the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001; (ii) the guidance provided
in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; (iii) the East
Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May 1978; and (iv) the East Cambridge
Development Review Process and Guidelines dated June, 1985; and (v) the
Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011 (collectively, the “PUD-8 Guidelines
and Principles”); provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 13.100 shall
govern with respect to process, uses, density, open space and streetwalls, and new
buildings constructed within the PUD-8 District shall be generally consistent with the
following provisions in lieu of the provisions pertaining to height, setback, stepbacks
and materials in the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles:
i.

Height and Setbacks: A diversity of height and massing as permitted in
Section 13.104.3 is encouraged to be located in buildings immediately
fronting on First Street, Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard and
designed to create a rich and varied skyline along streets abutting the
Development Parcel.
1. Buildings fronting on First Street are encouraged to establish a
recognizable base, activated by commercial, residential, retail, dining
and entertainment uses, of a scale and proportion to support an active,
pedestrian-oriented public realm.
2. New buildings fronting on First Street will enhance the public realm
by providing a setback of at least 10 feet or more as may be necessary
to provide a sidewalk that allows comfortable pedestrian circulation
in addition to street furniture, bicycle parking, tree plantings and other
streetscape features. Bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other
architectural elements may project 5 feet into this setback zone,
beginning at the second floor, to establish scale compatible with the
neighboring structures and to modulate the massing of the buildings
so that they are read as distinct and individual buildings.
3. Buildings along First Street are encouraged to create separation
between buildings and to adopt massing strategies within the building
facades to create visual interest on the street.
4. Mechanical penthouses, attic stories and other architectural treatments
will be utilized to create tops to the buildings that will contribute to a
varied skyline and unique reading of each building.

connection between Charles Park and Lechmere Canal Park, at its
height as of the effective date of the enactment of this Section 13.100
is encouraged.

Stepbacks.
1. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that exceed 85
feet in height shall provide (a) a 10-foot stepback of the building
façade at an elevation of approximately 65 feet in height and (b) a
10-foot stepback of the building façade at an elevation of
approximately 135 feet in height (if applicable), provided in each case
that bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other architectural elements
may project 5 feet into this stepback zone to establish scale
compatible with the neighboring structures, and to modulate the
massing of the buildings so that they are read as distinct and
individual buildings.
2. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that do not
exceed 85 feet in height are encouraged to provide a distinct
horizontal articulation at a datum height of approximately 65 feet,
through means other than a stepback (significant change in material,
projecting cornice/fin/shade, etc.).
3. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District shall provide a
15-foot stepback of the rooftop mechanical penthouses.

iii.

Building Spacing: New buildings shall be designed to provide for
appropriate spacing to preserve adequate light, air and view corridors for
the benefit of the East Cambridge neighborhood. New buildings should,
to the extent feasible, be separated by courtyards or other significant
breaks to avoid long lengths of unbroken building mass. Along First
Street, such breaks should be aligned with Spring and Hurley Streets to
the extent possible.

iv.

Materials and Details: A diverse and varied use of finishes and façade
elements is encouraged in new and renovated buildings to further
contribute to the reading of individual buildings along First Street,
Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard. Individual, architecturally
expressive buildings may be supported if they are positive additions to
the East Cambridge neighborhood.
1.

Purpose. The PUD-8 District is intended to provide for the creation of a vibrant mixeduse district of high quality general and technical office and lab use, active commercial
use, including retail, fitness and restaurant, components of residential use and
enhancement of open space to serve residents of the District and the surrounding
neighborhoods, as well as workers, students and visitors. The PUD-8 District
encourages strong connections between the neighborhoods of eastern Cambridge and
new development in that area, particularly along First Street, the East Cambridge
riverfront (focusing on Lechmere Canal) and the PUD-8 area. It also promotes retailand service-oriented ground floors that will activate surrounding public streets and
spaces, such as First Street and Lechmere Canal Park. The expectation is for the District
to continue to be a recognizable center of activity and economic viability for East
Cambridge and the surrounding neighborhoods in light of the changing landscape of
brick and mortar retail. Development in the PUD-8 District is expected to meet high
standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental sustainability and open
space design. To the extent reasonably practicable and subject to the provisions of
Section 13.107.5 below, new buildings shall be generally consistent with the policy
objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001, the
guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15,
2001, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May 1978, the East Cambridge
Development Review Process and Guidelines dated June, 1985 and the Cambridge
Riverfront Plan dated Spring 2011.

requirements of this Section 13.100 shall not be applied to individual PUD-8 lots or
ownership units comprising such Development Parcel, but shall be applied as if such
Development Parcel were a single conforming PUD-8 lot whether or not such
Development Parcel is in single or multiple ownership. A violation, with respect to an
individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any
provision of this Section 13.100 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any other
individual PUD-8 lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel.
13.102.8 Phasing Plan and Lapse. Any development within the Development Parcel shall
commence and, to the extent built in multiple phases over a period of time, be
constructed in accordance with the time limits set forth in the Final Development
Plan. Any changes to the Phasing Plan after issuance of the PUD-8 Special Permit are
subject only to written approval by the Planning Board.
In no event shall any portion of the development approved by a PUD-8 Special
Permit for which a building permit has been issued and construction has commenced
be deemed to have lapsed due to the fact that any other phase of the development
approved by a PUD-8 special permit has not been commenced or completed.
13.102.9 Relationship to PUD-4. With respect to the Development Parcel, the rights granted
pursuant to a PUD-8 Special Permit shall be in addition to any rights previously granted
under a PUD-4 special permit and the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern with respect
to such additional rights. The previously issued PUD-4 special permit shall remain
valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, any remaining land
outside of the Development Parcel subject thereto, provided that the terms of such
PUD-4 special permit shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any
rights granted to the Development Parcel pursuant to the PUD-8 Special Permit.
To the extent the Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or more PUD
District(s), special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to
the issuance date of a PUD-8 Special Permit granted hereunder and the provisions of
such PUD District(s) or existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the
PUD-8 Special Permit, the provisions of the PUD-8 Special Permit shall govern.
13.102.10 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a Development Proposal, the
developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD Pre-Application
Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance and a similar
conference with the full City Council or Ordinance Committee. The purpose of the
conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site arrangement, building
massing, circulation systems and public space arrangement, as well as general
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the developer to receive
informal feedback from the Planning Board prior to preparing the materials required
by Section 13.102.3 above. As set forth in Section 12.33.2, any statement made by the
Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application Conference shall not be legally
binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3, the developer shall present graphic and
written materials as needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development
alternatives

District.
13.106.5 Shared Parking Study. A Development Proposal for development in the PUD-8 District
shall include an analysis of existing and anticipated parking demand for all uses in the
development throughout the course of a typical day and week. The purpose of this
analysis is to consider parking demands for different land uses that have peak parking
demands at different times of day, thus enabling parking facilities to be used more
efficiently. Accordingly, this analysis may identify opportunities for reducing the total
amount of parking required to serve all uses through the sharing of parking spaces by
multiple uses. Based on this analysis, the Planning Board, with guidance from City
staff, may approve a reduced minimum or maximum parking requirement upon finding
that the approved amount of parking will be sufficient to serve all permitted uses. This
analysis may be approved by the Planning Board as a working study that can be
adjusted by written approval of the Planning Board over time, as dictated by changes
in parking demands.
13.106.6 Loading. The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may waive
any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities within the
PUD-8 Development Parcel, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across
various uses and PUD-8 lots within the PUD-8 District or adjacent PUD-4 Districts.
13.106.7 Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its

fronting on First Street, Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard and
designed to create a rich and varied skyline along streets abutting the
Development Parcel.
1. Buildings fronting on First Street are encouraged to establish a
recognizable base, activated by commercial, residential, retail, dining
and entertainment uses, of a scale and proportion to support an active,
pedestrian-oriented public realm.
2. New buildings fronting on First Street will enhance the public realm
by providing a setback of at least 10 feet or more as may be necessary
to provide a sidewalk that allows comfortable pedestrian circulation in
addition to street furniture, bicycle parking, tree plantings and other
streetscape features. Bays, balconies, tapers, cornices and other
architectural elements may project 5 feet into this setback zone,
beginning at the second floor, to establish scale compatible with the
neighboring structures and to modulate the massing of the buildings so
that they are read as distinct and individual buildings.
3. Buildings along First Street are encouraged to create separation
between buildings and to adopt massing strategies within the building
facades to create visual interest on the street.
4. Mechanical penthouses, attic stories and other architectural treatments
will be utilized to create tops to the buildings that will contribute to a
varied skyline and unique reading of each building.
5. Maintaining the existing pedestrian atrium, which provides a connection
between Charles Park and Lechmere Canal Park, at its height as of the
effective date of the enactment of this Section 13.100 is encouraged.
ii.

Stepbacks.

feet in height shall provide (a) a 10-foot stepback of the building
façade at an elevation of approximately 65 feet in height and (b) a 10foot stepback of the building façade at an elevation of approximately
135 feet in height (if applicable), provided in each case that bays,
balconies, tapers, cornices and other architectural elements may
project 5 feet into this stepback zone to establish scale compatible
with the neighboring structures, and to modulate the massing of the
buildings so that they are read as distinct and individual buildings.
2. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District that do not
exceed 85 feet in height are encouraged to provide a distinct
horizontal articulation at a datum height of approximately 65 feet,
through means other than a stepback (significant change in material,

projecting cornice/fin/shade, etc.).
3. New or renovated buildings within the PUD-8 District shall provide a
15-foot stepback of the rooftop mechanical penthouses.
iii.

Building Spacing: New buildings shall be designed to provide for
appropriate spacing to preserve adequate light, air and view corridors for
the benefit of the East Cambridge neighborhood. New buildings should,
to the extent feasible, be separated by courtyards or other significant
breaks to avoid long lengths of unbroken building mass. Along First
Street, such breaks should be aligned with Spring and Hurley Streets to
the extent possible.

iv.

Materials and Details: A diverse and varied use of finishes and façade
elements is encouraged in new and renovated buildings to further
contribute to the reading of individual buildings along First Street,
Cambridgeside Place and Land Boulevard. Individual, architecturally
expressive buildings may be supported if they are positive additions to the
East Cambridge neighborhood.

fixed or operable windows, roof decks, terraces, shutters and
shading devices.

(b)
In its approval of a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board may (i) make a
determination that one or more provisions of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles are
inapplicable to new buildings to be constructed within the PUD-8 District, or (ii) waive
or modify any provisions of the PUD-8 Guidelines and Principles set forth above upon
making a determination that such waiver or modification maintains an architectural
character consistent with the planning and design goals of this Section 13.107.5.
13.107.6 Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated _____________ by

Re: End of Term Report from Housing Committee
Dear Mr. Clerk:
Please include this correspondence on the agenda as part of the Communications and Reports
from City Officers for the City Council meeting scheduled for December 16, 2019. With the end of
the 2018-2019 City Council term upon us, I am writing to summarize the work I have engaged in as
Co-Chair of the Housing Committee throughout the course of this term, and I am including
recommendations for what I hope the Housing Committee and the City Council will continue to work
on in the 2020-2021 City Council term.
At the start of this City Council term, when I first became Co-Chair of the Housing
Committee along with Councilor Siddiqui, I steered this committee through a series of initial
hearings designed to narrow our focus on which policies from the Comprehensive Housing Plan I
had presented to the City Council on September 18, 2017 should be explored during the new term. I
had worked closely with a number of Affordable Housing experts in drafting that Comprehensive
Housing Plan, and perhaps no one figure was more central to creating this document than CherylAnn Pizza-Zeoli. I had the pleasure of working closely with Ms. Pizza-Zeoli on housing issues for
many years, and so many of us were devastated when she passed away this past April. Nevertheless,
her work lives on in this incredible document that she worked so tirelessly on, which has served as
something of a legislative roadmap during this Council term, and which I very much hope the City
Council can continue to draw upon going forward.
In recent years, the City Council has made undeniable progress in addressing the affordable
housing challenges that impact this region. We have raised the linkage fees that developers of
commercial buildings must pay into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund from $4.58/square foot
(which was the rate for more than a decade) up to $15/square foot as of 2018. We doubled the rate
(and expanded the scope) of Inclusionary units that must be included in new residential buildings,
which now sits at 20 percent of all new buildings of 10 or more units. Together, these two policies
are expected to yield millions of new dollars, and hundreds of new affordable units, in the coming
years. And yet, the City must take significant additional measures, from a variety of different

7.2.a

7.2.a

One of the items called for in the Comprehensive Housing Plan was the need for the City to
devote more funding towards the preservation and creation of affordable units. To that end, in April
2018 Councilor Siddiqui and I sponsored a Policy Order urging the City to commit to spending an
additional $100 million over the next five years for the preservation of expiring use affordable
units, and the creation of brand new affordable units; this would be in addition to the funds that had
already been committed to this use. Increasing this funding would be an important factor in giving
the City much greater flexibility in preserving and creating affordable units throughout the
community.
Another big achievement this term was the establishment of the new Housing Liaison to the
City Manager – this executive-level position, which was one of the policy recommendation in the
Comprehensive Housing Plan, was created to better serve the tenants living in our Inclusionary units,
to strengthen the ties between the City and the various management companies that preside over
these buildings, to problem-solve for any issues that Inclusionary tenants may be facing as a result of
policy inadequacies, and to review the policies (and suggest improvements to the City Manager) that
govern our Inclusionary program. Maura Pensak, who did extraordinary work for many years at the
Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership (and who played a critical role in helping to find new
housing for the over 100 displaced residents of the York Street fire in December 2016), was hired to
fill this role and started working in September 2019. Ms. Pensak is a knowledgeable, dynamic new
addition to the City’s leadership team and I am excited to see what she will accomplish in the coming
years. I very much believe that this new position will go a long way towards improving the alreadyimpressive Inclusionary Housing program that is offered by the City.
Without question, the largest legislative venture that the Housing Committee undertook this
term was the conceiving, vetting, and deliberating of the proposed citywide Affordable Housing
Overlay District. This was an ambitious piece of legislation, which – again – had been a policy
recommendation from the Comprehensive Housing Plan, although the discussions around the need
for such an overlay date back many, many years. At its core, this legislation had been envisioned as a
tool to allow for the relief of certain height and density restrictions for developments that are
designated as 100 percent affordable in perpetuity, and it would streamline the process under which
such housing could be built. The AHOD, as it was known, would be used in combination with other
legislative and planning tools to add upwards of 60-100 brand new affordable units across the city
each year, it would create more favorable conditions for developers of affordable housing to
competitively acquire land on which to build, it would allow money devoted to creating affordable
housing to be stretched further, and it would more evenly and equitably distribute such housing
throughout the city. The process, from the initial discussions in the Housing Committee, to the votes
asking the Community Development Department to begin conceptualizing and drafting the zoning
language, to converting this into legislative language, to educating the members of the Council and
the members of the public as to what the legislation would and would not do, to holding numerous
Ordinance Committee hearings and Roundtables and moving this to the full City Council for
deliberation, spanned around 15 months and encompassed dozens of public meetings. I thank
everyone from the affordable housing advocates to the City employees who worked so hard and put
countless hours into researching, envisioning, drafting, and answering questions about the proposed
legislation. It was a long, difficult, and at times frustrating process as those of us who supported the
AHOD had to fight against a fair amount of misinformation that was being circulated about it. I
remain convinced that the AHOD would ultimately be an important tool in the City’s continuous
efforts to provide greater access to affordable housing for a greater number of our residents. The City
Council ultimately chose to table this legislation toward the end of this Council term, but I remain

approaches, in order to truly make a meaningful impact on the affordable housing crisis that threatens
to displace countless longtime residents from our community.

Another large housing initiative that operated outside the purview of the Housing Committee
but that was nonetheless a critical undertaking and worth noting in this letter was the Mayor’s Task
Force on Tenant Displacement (for those reading this letter online, that link should take you to the
report of this task force), which was led by my Housing Committee Co-Chair, Councilor Siddiqui.
Over the course of numerous meetings throughout the past year, Councilor Siddiqui diligently led her
sub-committee on an exploration of different practices, policies, and initiatives that could be
implemented to prevent tenant displacement and help stabilize the housing for many Cambridge
residents. The report has just been released to the Council and the public this month, and I very much
hope that the next City Council will carry this important work forward. Councilor Siddiqui and her
sub-committee members worked incredibly hard on tackling an issue that impacts tenants all across
our community, and we owe them all our gratitude for digging in, doing the work, and coming up
with some workable ideas to resolve a complex host of problems.
Of course, there were many other policies that the Housing Committee discussed, debated, or
suggested that the City consider throughout this term. These policy orders and recommendations
often asked the City Manager and his staff to explore addressing the problem of creating greater
access to affordable housing, or helping to stabilize existing tenancies, from other angles. Among
those policy orders that have been passed by the City Council and that have not yet received a
formal response from the City Manager include the following:
(From December 12, 2016)
ORDERED:

That the City Manager is requested to report back to the City Council
regarding the potential of building below market rental housing on Cityowned parking lots along Bishop Allen Drive.

(From December 19, 2016)
ORDERED:

That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Assistant City Manager
for Community Development to determine if people displaced because of
events that qualify for Emergency Status and are using a Section 8 voucher in
another city or town can retain their resident preference for the purpose of the
Inclusionary Housing application

(From March 26, 2018)
ORDERED:

That the City Manager conduct, compile, and publish an inventory of all Cityowned vacant buildings and lots with the City's plans for them, if any [plans
exist].

(From February 25, 2019)
ORDERED:

That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Community
Development Department on a process for establishing a formal, thorough
review of the City’s Affordable Home Ownership programs, incorporating a
plan for obtaining and analyzing substantial quantitative data inclusive of all
types of units.

hopeful that the tremendous amount of hard work and good-faith efforts invested in this process may
yet yield some version of the AHOD in the coming years.

ORDERED:

That the Co-Chairs of the Housing Committee are requested to schedule
hearings to take up the attached proposed Comprehensive Housing Plan for
review and consideration in the near future.

These orders look at different aspects of the various housing issues facing our community,
and as there likely will be a new composition of the Housing Committee in the ‘20-‘21 City Council
term, it will be important that each of these aspects get the full investigation, exploration, and vetting
they deserve.
There have also been a number of other items raised in the Housing Committee over the
past two terms that, while not issued as policy orders, have been discussed throughout our
hearings and/or been raised as part of the Comprehensive Housing Plan that I introduced in
2017 that should be considered as this conversation continues into 2020. These items include
concepts such as:
•

Pathways out of Homelessness – The City must be more proactive in creating options for
those whose income lifts them just beyond the income brackets for CHA housing, and who
could be prime candidates for Inclusionary housing or home ownership programs.

•

Eligibility for Inclusionary Program – The CDD has been reviewing the criteria for who is
given preference for its Inclusionary units, and it is my hope and expectation that this matter
shall be discussed, and recommendations shall be made for deliberation and adoption, early
in the new year. Among the hoped-for discussions that are related to this topic are:
o Discussing the possibility of a revised “local preference” category for those with
roots in Cambridge who have been temporarily displaced for a set number of years
and are looking to return to the community.
o The possibility of a revised category for those who have risen above the income
eligibility for CHA housing, and who are now possible candidates for CDD housing
or homeownership through CDD programming.
o The possibility of a revised eligibility formula for those who are coming from CHA
housing who have poor credit scores, but who otherwise have unblemished housing
records.
o Additionally, there have been repeated concerns raised that those who live in
Inclusionary Units are treated differently, and with less civility and respect, than their
counterparts who live in the market-rate units. It will be important for the City
Council to address this as we move into the new term.

•

Condo Conversion Fees and Ending Predatory Developers – The Housing Committee
was greatly impacted in 2015 by the testimony of those tenants in Harvard Towers and on
Harding Street, which highlighted the perils for renters when their affordable buildings are
sold out to developers who are uninterested in working with the City to retain affordability.
Nearly five years later, it remains imperative that the City deliberate on what actions can be

7.2.a

•

Quarterly Roundtables With the CHA, HRI, JAS, and other Major Affordable Housing
Providers – I have long urged that the City take pains to institutionalize these types of
meetings so that there becomes a predictability as to when these meetings will transpire, and
so that policies and upcoming projects can be shared amongst each other, challenges can be
recognized, and working relationships can be strengthened. If we do this correctly, such
meetings will gradually become part of our city’s DNA, long outlasting the people who
currently serve in elected office, in the City’s administration, and at the head of the various
housing agencies. These information-sharing meetings, held in full view of the public, will
ultimately enable us all to be far more effective in the work that we’re undertaking on the
public’s behalf.

There have been many housing-related challenges discussed during this term, and the
Housing Committee has covered a great deal of ground over the past two years. Along with my CoChair, Councilor Siddiqui, and the other members of the Housing Committee, I am proud of the work
we have undertaken throughout this term. It would be a disservice to the incoming City Council, and
to the people we serve, to let any of this work languish or be forgotten about, simply because we
have entered a new calendar year. It is my great hope that the next Housing Committee will revisit
the work we have undertaken this term and will hit the ground running in picking up the threads and
advancing the work further. Whether I am on this committee going forward or not, I will certainly
make myself available to the next Housing Committee, and I look forward to continuing the work in
my capacity as a City Councilor in the New Year. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL

December 16, 2019
To Mayor McGovern and all the city councillors who have served with me since 2016 -- Dennis Carlone, Leland
Cheung, Craig Kelley, David Maher, Alanna Mallon, Nadeem Mazen, Sumbul Siddiqui, Denise Simmons, Tim
Toomey, and Quinton Zondervan:
In my last official communication in office, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you all on the record
for your service and commitment to the City of Cambridge. The past four years have taught me a great deal
about what it means to represent, to serve, and to lead, and each of you has contributed to shaping and
enriching my experience as a city councillor.
No one who has not sat in our awkwardly oversized chairs knows better than we do what it feels like to be
part of the “improv troupe” that assembles in the Sullivan Chamber on Monday nights and on countless other
afternoons and evenings for live performances of “Local Government In/Action.” It is an experience and a role
unlike any other, one I am honored and grateful that voters in Cambridge twice cast me in. I am proud to have
fully committed to “faithfully and impartially performing and discharging the duties of, according to the law
and the best of my ability.”
Craig: Seven consecutive terms on the Council is an impressive length of service that few have bettered. I
respect your persistence and what you have accomplished. You and I didn’t always agree, but I appreciate
that you always continued to look for common ground and never seemed to hold a grudge. I look forward to
comparing notes as we both transition back to civilian life.
To the returning councillors: I wish you the very best as you start another season with two new members, and
I will watch with interest how the story unfolds. Carrying the spirit of this season into the next term, I know
you will be generous with and forgiving of each other.
And last but not least, to City Manager DePasquale and all his staff too numerous to name here but far too
important not to thank and acknowledge for working so hard to respond to our many, often conflicting
demands, with grace and good humor.
