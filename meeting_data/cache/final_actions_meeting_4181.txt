I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,409,562 from Free Cash to the Community Benefits
Stabilization Fund. During FY22, the City received mitigation revenues slated for Community Benefits
from MIT Cambridge Real Estate, LLC. By law, all mitigation revenues must be deposited into the
General Fund and can only be appropriated after the Free Cash Certification is complete.
The $1,409,562 appropriated to the Community Benefits Stabilization Fund is the only the appropriation
from Free Cash attributed to Community Benefits Stabilization and will be used to fund specific future
projects, which will require separate individual appropriations by the City Council.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Re: Council Order No. O-6 of 8/1/22 Re: That the City Manager be and hereby is
requested to direct the appropriate City to determine how and when such a City
Employee ID badge program can be implemented, and to report back to the City
Council on this matter in a timely manner.
Dear Councilors:
City staff and I have reviewed the above-referenced Council Order and provide the
following response. The City is supportive of broader, more consistent and comprehensive use of
visible photo IDs by City employees, particularly those who interact with or are more likely to
encounter members of the public. I have directed the Personnel, Licensing, and Information
Technology Departments to review and implement both short- and long-term programs to fulfill
this initiative.
Background:
•
•
•
•

The City currently issues photo IDs produced by the Licensing Commission. These IDs were
updated in 2018 to incorporate a more modern and less replicable design.
City photo IDs are currently available upon request by departments, business units, and
employees with supervisory approval.
Although these IDs are available, they are generally not used as a visible badge for employee
identification purposes.
Other City departments including the Library, Water, and School Departments maintain and
issue their own photo IDs.

Next steps:
•

The Personnel Department will work with other City departments to develop and implement
a program that will include more comprehensive use and tracking of existing photo IDs by
City employees. Personnel will work with Information Technology, Licensing, and other
departments to develop end to end, centralized onboarding and offboarding processes to

Packet Pg. 28

1.3

•

support the issuance, maintenance, and security of existing photo IDs and in anticipation of a
more advanced ID system that could possibly incorporate other “smart” features.
Information Technology will work with Personnel, Licensing, Law, and other departments to
develop options, recommend scope, indicate benefits and risks, and estimate the cost of more
sophisticated “smart” IDs that could incorporate features such as building access control
(physical security), systems access (IT security), and other embedded information through
the EGov process.

We anticipate being able to develop and implement a policy and expand usage of existing
ID cards this fiscal year, while the work on more sophisticated “smart” IDs will be incorporated
into the FY24 Budget.
I am available to answer any questions you may have.
Very truly yours,

Yi-An Huang
City Manager

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Re: Response to Awaiting Report No. 22-25 of 4/25/22 Re: Report on How the City
can Meet the Goals for Diversity and Inclusion While Ensuring that Any Required
Professional Expertise and/or Specific Knowledge that May be Statutorily Required will
Continue to be Represented; and
Response to Awaiting Report No. 21-52 of 6/28/21 Re: Report on examining stipend
models for the City’s multi-member board and commission bodies.
I am strongly committed to ensuring that board and commission appointments are made in an
equitable and transparent manner, that the membership of these groups represents the diversity of
the Cambridge community, and that we create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all
members and the public. This response will address five items of inquiry in AR No. 22-25 in the
order which the City Council presented them for ease of reference (with AR No. 21-52 being
addressed in Section V. Stipends).
I should note that the focus of this response is the group of boards and commissions where all
or some members are subject to City Council approval. In conjunction with this report, City staff
have prepared a series of charts (Attachment A) which provides detailed information about all
the boards, commissions, task forces, working groups, and advisory committees that have been
identified in the City of Cambridge. Charts 1 and 2 of Attachment A identify the twenty-four
(24) Boards and Commissions where all or some members are subject to City Council approval.
Chart 3 of Attachment A also identifies three (3) groups, the Housing Authority, Redevelopment
Authority, and Industrial Development Financing Authority, that, while not Boards or
Commissions, already have members that are appointed by the City Manager subject to City
Council approval as required under state law. The remaining thirty-five (35) boards,
commissions, task forces, and working groups do not have members subject to City Council
approval.

I. Recruitment
Developing a standard operating procedure for recruiting candidates to Boards and
Commissions which is better aligned with current City staff recruitment standard operating
procedures, including but not limited to: where to advertise and for how long, in what
languages, what personal criteria should be added to the application process to ensure
diversity (gender, age, race, ethnicity, rent/owner, etc.)

Packet Pg. 30

1.4

In 2021, an outside consulting firm, Working Ideal, completed its report on the City’s
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: A Workforce Plan for Recruitment, Hiring, and Promotion
(RHP) Project (RHP Report), which assessed the City’s recruitment, hiring, and promotion
(RHP) practices through a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) lens and made recommendations
related to improving structure, practices, policies, and culture. The workplan associated with
implementing these improvements is scheduled to be ongoing through 2024.
While the RHP Report is specifically focused on City employees, many of the
recommendations- such as those around structuring recruitment and selection, developing
diverse screening and interview panels, ensuring a diverse slate of applicants, and reducing
potential barriers created by the wording of job postings - are directly transferable to supporting
diverse boards and commissions. In addition to the recommendations referenced in the RHP
Report, others will be further developed as the workplan is implemented.
A. Draft a Clear and Inclusive Posting
Below are some guidelines that have been established for recruitment to boards and
commissions. These guidelines have been informed in part by the principles articulated in TenPoint Job Description Best Practice Checklist (Working Ideal, 2022) (Attachment B). Our
intention is to develop and implement a policy that reflects these objectives, which we expect to
do in 2023.
•

Use the clearest, simplest language possible in the posting
o Provide a description of the board or commission’s mission, scope, duties, and
responsibilities,
o List any conditions or requirements applicable to membership on the
board or commission,
▪ Be sure anything listed as “required” is truly necessary for an
individual to serve.
o Highlight particular interests, skills, or other conditions that would be
helpful to the applicant in order to serve on the board or commission, and
o Include the following Anti-Racism, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
statement in all postings:
The City is committed to advancing a culture of
antiracism, diversity, equity, and inclusion(1). All

________________________
(1) Antiracism is an active commitment to dismantling institutional structures, beliefs and behaviors that perpetuate
inequity based on race. It is the practice of opposing the devaluing of human beings at the individual, interpersonal,
and systems levels.
Diversity is the mosaic of people who bring a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, values, and beliefs as assets to
groups and organizations in which they interact.
Equity is the presence of impartial access to opportunities, resources, and supports and the absence of disparities,
biases and barriers that are systematically associated with social and historical advantage and disadvantage.
Inclusion is the act of creating environments in which any individual or group can be and feel welcomed, respected,
supported, and have unobstructed access to participation. An inclusive and welcoming climate embraces differences
and values all people in words and in actions.

Packet Pg. 31

1.4

board and commission members in Cambridge
must have the ability to work and interact
effectively with individuals and groups with a
variety of identities, cultures, backgrounds, and
ideologies.
Women, minorities, veterans, members of the
LGBTQ+ community, and persons with disabilities
are encouraged to apply.
B. Where to Advertise

•

o City’s home page,
o The board or commission’s webpage on the City website,
o Notice of the initial posting in the City’s daily email (which currently reaches
16,000 subscribers)
o Postings in local newspapers and social media, and
o Outreach to the City’s neighborhood groups, community partners, and local
businesses as appropriate to the board or commission.
Based on the demographic composition of current membership and/or the diversity of
responses to initial outreach, the City Manager or their designee may require more
targeted outreach to diverse professional and community organizations.

C. Length of Posting Period
In general, board and commission vacancies will be posted for 30 days. However, this
posting period may be shortened in cases where having qualified members in sufficient numbers
to maintain a quorum is vital to avoid legal penalties that may be incurred due to the board or
commission’s failure to act in a timely manner.
D. Language
The City continues to build on the work of the Family Policy Council to support language
justice, which is the right to understand and be understood in the language in which a person is
most comfortable. The City recently hired a full-time Language Access Manager in the
Cambridge Human Rights Commission’s new Language Justice Division. The Language Access
Manager will provide support and collaborate across City departments to produce tools and
deliver training for City staff and to ensure that best practices are utilized. While there are no
plans to post board and commission vacancies in languages other than English at this time, the
City Manager’s Office will actively collaborate with the Language Justice Division to ensure that
the boards and commissions process reflects any new language practices that may be developed.
E. Demographic Information

Packet Pg. 32

1.4

The City is assessing how to request and utilize demographic information in the board and
commission application process. The City has developed a working draft Standard Demographic
Battery (Attachment C) to improve the quality and consistency of the demographic data
collected across City surveys. This battery has been approved as a set of best practices by
Cambridge’s Data Governance Committee and will be widely accessible to City staff through the
soon-to-be launched internal Data Services Portal. The questions have also been pre-loaded into
the City’s enterprise account survey software so they can be easily added to public facing
surveys. This demographic battery was used as a framework for Demographic Section to the
Boards and Commission Application. (Attachment D). Answering questions is voluntary.
F. Screening and Interviewing Applicants
After the close of the posted application deadline and receipt of all applications, the City
Manager’s Office will send all applicant packets to the applicable department representative.
The department will arrange for a diverse screening committee to screen applications and to
recommend candidates for interview. The City’s interview panels will also be composed, to the
extent practicable, to reflect the diversity of the City’s government and what is being sought for
each board and commission. Prior to finalizing the screening and interview panel, the
department will receive confirmation from the Director of Equity and Inclusion that the panel
meets the City’s expectation for diversity.
Additionally, prior to conducting interviews with recommended applicants, the department
will forward the list of candidates to the Director of Equity and Inclusion so the diversity of the
slate can be reviewed. The definition of a diverse slate is not a fixed number or percentage of
candidates in different demographic categories, but rather depends on factors like the current
composition of the board, the size of the board or commission, and any affinity focus the board
or commission may have.
Should the Director of Equity and Inclusion determine that a department’s proposed slate of
candidates to interview is not sufficiently diverse, no candidates will be removed; rather, the
department will be required to seek additional candidates from more targeted outreach.

II. Onboarding
Developing a comprehensive strategy to provide anti-bias training and onboarding to new
Boards and Commission members and exit interviews to members upon leaving.
A. Orientation Packets
It has been the City’s past practice to have onboarding, training, and off boarding of board
and commission members conducted primarily by department staff. While role-specific training
will still be needed and valuable at the department level, certain aspects of these processes will
be coordinated by the City Manager’s Office going forward.
In the short-term, the City Manager’s Office will work with departments to implement
introduction packets for all new board and commission members that contain the following
documents:

Packet Pg. 33

1.4

•
•

Important contact information,
Applicable provisions of state laws, Municipal Code, and any other rules, and
regulations applicable to the board or commission (e.g. BZA, Planning Board),
• City’s Sexual Harassment Policy,
• City’s Workplace Violence Policy,
• Summary of Conflict-of-Interest Law for Municipal Employees, and
• Information about Open Meeting Laws.
All the City’s board and commission members, like all the City’s employees, must abide by
these policies and procedures. Violation of or failure to comply with these policies will be
considered grounds for removal and a bar to future service on the City’s boards and commissions
to the extent legally permissible.
B. Training
The City currently requires that all employees take the following trainings: Preventing Sexual
Harassment and Valuing Anti-Racism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (previously called
Valuing Diversity). The City will begin to offer these classes to Board and Commission
members starting in 2023.
Starting in 2023, the City will begin to offer the following trainings to all employees:
•
•
•

Identity Awareness and Structural Racism
Microaggressions in the Workplace
Unconscious Bias in the Workplace
Any anti-bias training or educational seminars the City conducts with its employees will also
be made available to and may be required of the City’s board and commission members,
resources and personnel permitting. Refusal to participate in any required trainings may be
considered grounds for removal and a bar to future service on the City’s boards and commissions
to the extent legally permissible.
In addition, members of the Law Department will continue to be available to provide training
on laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations related to the work of particular boards or
commission, conflict of interest and ethics laws, the Open Meeting Law, and the Public Records
Law, as they have in past years.
C. Exit Interviews
Starting in 2023, the City will implement a structure to offer voluntary exit interview
procedures for board and commission members who voluntarily leave their positions to garner
feedback on their experiences. These interviews may be conducted by City staff or by an
independent third party contracted by the City. Feedback received will be shared with the City
Manager’s Office, the Office of Equity and Inclusion, and relevant departments to support
process improvements to the administration of boards and commissions going forward.

III.

Term Limits

Provide a report of Boards and Commission that have term limits where applicable and a
strategy for imposing term limits based on best practices.
A survey of the City’s boards and commissions finds that, with certain exceptions, none
Packet Pg. 34

1.4

impose term limits on their members. The City recognizes the value of fresh leadership and
diverse perspectives in its boards and commissions, and the desire is for maximum terms to land
around 10-15 years. However, it is not our intention to implement fixed term limits and rather to
allow for flexibility around unique circumstances. This could include difficulty in recruiting new
candidates or the need for extension given specific leadership or technical capabilities. For
instance, the last two years of confronting the COVID pandemic reveal the practical need to
retain stable leadership.

IV. Standardization of Appointments
Developing a standardized presentation of appointments and re-appointments to City
Council including, but not limited to, number of applicants, length of opening, current
demographic breakdown of the Board or Committee, where outreach was done etc.
For each recommended appointment or reappointment forwarded to the City Council, the
City Manager will provide:
•
•
•

A copy of the posting including opening and closing dates,
A description of outreach done,
A summary of the screening and interview process including how many applications
were received and how many candidates were interviewed,
• A statement from the City Manager describing the efforts that were made to seek a
diverse slate,
• A brief biography of each recommended candidate including a description of the
particular background, skills, or experience the member contributes to the board or
commission,
• The term of the appointment, and a summary of any other current or upcoming
vacancies on the board or commission, and what the department’s plan is for filling
those positions (public posting, additional reappointments). This information is
intended to provide the City Council with additional context relating to expected
turnover on the board or commission.
• In cases where the City Manager recommends a reappointment to the City Council,
the City Manager will also include information about the time the member has
already served on the board and commission.
In keeping with best practices around ensuring applicant demographic information is kept
private to the extent possible, the City Manager’s recommendation will not include specific
demographic data on the applicant pool or the board or commission. Many of these groups are
so small as to make anonymizing data impossible. Instead, the City Manager will address the
diversity of the slate of applicants interviewed as determined by the Director of Equity and
Inclusion.

V. Stipends
Exploring ways we can provide stipends to boards and commission members,
particularly those who meet more regularly like the Planning Board and Board of Zoning
Appeals.
The City acknowledges that members of the Planning Board (PB), Board of Zoning Appeals
(BZA), and the Historical Commission provide substantial volunteer hours as compared to those
Packet Pg. 35

1.4

on other boards and commissions. During the period from October 2021 through October 2022,
PB held thirty-eight meetings, BZA held twenty-three meetings, and Historical Commission held
fourteen meetings. Any of these meetings can last for 3-5 hours and include hours of advance
preparation time. By comparison, many other boards and commissions meet for two hours or
less, approximately ten times per year.
Things like childcare during meetings and travel to and from meetings can create a barrier for
many residents when they consider whether to apply for the Planning Board or the Board of
Zoning Appeal as well as other boards and commissions and could potentially limit board and
commission member diversity.
A survey of other Massachusetts communities’ approach to these types of stipends
(Attachment E) indicates that the provision of stipends to Planning Board and Zoning Board of
Appeal members is uncommon but does occur. Perhaps the most relevant comparable
community to focus on is Somerville, which provides its Planning Board and Zoning Board of
Appeals members a stipend of $5,943.96 annually.
Cambridge will begin to provide a $6,000 annual stipend to all Planning Board members
starting in January 2023. This stipend is intended to offset the annual out of pocket costs
incurred by Board members in connection with participation on the Board.
Cambridge will begin to provide a $2,500 annual stipend to all Cambridge Historical
Commission Members starting in January 2023. This stipend is intended to offset the annual out
of pocket costs incurred by Commission members in connection with participation on the
Commission.
Cambridge also intends to provide a $3,500 annual stipend to all full members of the BZA
starting in January 2023, assuming the Municipal Code is amended to allow this. This stipend is
intended to offset the annual out of pocket costs incurred by Board members in connection with
participation on the Board.
Additionally, Cambridge intends to provide a $2,000 stipend to all associate members of the
BZA starting in January 2023 if the Municipal Code is amended accordingly. BZA associate
members attend meetings on an as-needed basis when full-members are not available. Previous
patterns of participation indicate that this could average 50% of meetings attended by full
members.
Because Section 10.12 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance requires that BZA members
serve without compensation, the Zoning Ordinance would need to be amended to remove that
provision and to authorize providing a stipend to BZA members. The City Solicitor has prepared
the attached proposed zoning amendment (Attachment F) to allow for the provision of stipends
to BZA members. I recommend that the Council adopt it as a City Council zoning petition and
refer it to the Ordinance Committee and Planning Board for hearing.
There are other City Boards and Commissions as to which certain statutes, special acts, or
ordinances prohibit or limit the City’s ability to provide stipends to their members. There is,
however, no limitation on providing stipends to Planning Board members, so it is not necessary
to amend the Zoning Ordinance or Municipal Code to do so.
Packet Pg. 36

1.4

The City will continue to evaluate the time involved and barriers to participation in
volunteering for other City boards and commissions and may consider allowing for the provision
of additional board or commission stipends in the future based on this evaluation.

VI.

Concluding Thoughts

The City’s boards and commissions have important business to complete on behalf of the
Cambridge community and therefore must have sufficient members to ensure that the quorums
necessary to complete this business are achieved and staff to support the work of the boards and
commissions. Therefore, as we work to develop and implement the process improvements
described above, I will continue to submit appointment recommendations for Council approval
and request that these recommendations be acted on in a timely manner.
Boards and commissions play a critical role in our civic landscape, and I’m looking forward
to further discussions and input on how we ensure that these bodies are healthy, effective, and
representative of our diverse community.
Very truly yours,

Yi-An Huang
City Manager

General Guidance
•

•
•

Unless otherwise noted, these questions should appear at the end of your survey.
You should preface the demographic questions with this statement: “The following questions
are optional. Answering them will help the City to determine whether the survey respondents
are a representative sample of the Cambridge population.”
You should provide information (like a web page link) on how people can view the results of
the survey once it is complete.
If you are using survey software such as SurveyMonkey that allows you to anonymize the
responses (meaning you will not see the IP address of respondents), you should select that
option, and include language like this at the beginning of the survey:
“Your responses to this survey are anonymous. No personally identifiable
information is captured unless you voluntarily include personal or contact
information in your responses. Your IP address may be recorded by
SurveyMonkey but is not stored with or linked to the survey results made
available to the City of Cambridge.”

Neighborhood

For online or in-person surveys,
this question should include a
labeled map of Cambridge
neighborhoods like that included
here. If your survey software
allows, you can let respondents
click on the map to select their
neighborhood.
For telephone surveys or other
situations where you cannot show
the respondent the map, use the
alternative version that groups
neighborhoods into three areas.
This question can appear at the
end of the survey for
demographic purposes, or you
can place it at the beginning if
you are using it as a screener question.

WHEREAS:

In recent years, the City has worked to address a number of different, critical issues
that impact the wellbeing of our community and our planet via a number of different
policies and initiatives that are tied to the development of new commercial and
residential buildings; and

WHEREAS:

From increasing the linkage fees that developers must pay into the Affordable Housing
Trust Fund, to increasing the mandatory amount of inclusionary units in new
residential buildings of ten units or more, to our Net Zero policies, to the proposed
BEUDO amendments, to the Affordable Housing Overlay, to the possibility of
eliminating parking minimums, there have been a number of new or refreshed
initiatives enacted by the City over the past half decade; and

WHEREAS:

While each of these policies addresses a very real need, it would be prudent for the
City to take a moment to request that an analysis be conducted to determine what
impact, if any, all of these combined policies have had upon local commercial and
residential development, and what impact may yet be felt by these combined policies
in the near term; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Community
Development Department to conduct an assessment and analysis of the impacts of the
combined, above-referenced policies upon local commercial and residential
development over the past half decade, and the anticipated impact of these policies
over the next half decade, and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a
timely manner.

2.2.b

2.2.c

Dear Councilors,
We are writing today as Officers of the Fresh Pond Residents Alliance, the
recognized neighborhood association for West Cambridge. This letter is in regards
to a curb cut request by the MacArthur Construction Company for their recently
purchased property at 52 Standish Street.
Before indicating approval or disapproval for this project, there are several
questions for which we would like to have more information. Our questions are as
follows:
1) Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance states that lighting shall be provided to
properly illuminate parking areas. What will be done to satisfy this
requirement, while also minimizing light trespass towards the neighboring
properties?
2) Article 6 also specifies requirements for the screening of parking areas. The
application shows only a plan view of the curb cut and driveway, but says
nothing about the plans for screening. Can the applicant provide more details
regarding their intentions as relates to screening?
3) Flooding, both surface and sub-surface, is a major concern in our neighborhood,
and the abutting foundation at 56 Standish Street is located only a few feet away
from the proposed driveway. Beyond using porous paving, what else does the
applicant propose in order to control runoff from paved areas?
4) As a part of the just-begun renovation efforts at 52 Standish Street, the
developer recently installed new storm water and sewer lines to the street. This
required excavation within the public way, resulting in Standish Street being
closed to through traffic, including City garbage trucks, for over a week. These
closures were not announced in advance to the neighborhood, nor was a police
detail ever present to redirect traffic. Now that the street has been reopened
and the excavations covered with steel plates, what assurances does the
community have that street closures will be announced in advance in the
future? Also, will the developer pay for a full-width repaving of the excavated
section of roadway, or will the neighborhood now be forced to deal with steel
road plates and potholes forever?

Attachment: Neighborhood Assoc questions Curb Cut Letter- 52 Standish Street - Copy (APP 2022 #48 : 52 Standish Street Curb Cut)

September 21st, 2022

5) Since the applicant also owns 201.5 Lakeview Avenue, a landlocked property
now under construction immediately to the rear of 52 Standish Street,
conversion of the driveway at 52 Standish Street into an access corridor for
201.5 Lakeview would eliminate any potential parking benefits of the curb cut
to the Standish Street neighborhood, as well as increase car noise to the
immediate abutters at all times of the day. As such, we would request that the
applicant be clear and honest with all concerned parties regarding his true
intentions for this curb cut. In short, what are the applicant’s long-term
intentions as relates to a potential driveway easement servicing the rear
parcel?
6) And regarding the matter of concerned parties itself, under state law “Parties in
Interest” to be notified in matters related to land use include “owners of land
directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the
abutters within three hundred feet of the property line of the petitioner.” Rather
than using this higher standard of public engagement, the applicant instead
chose to restrict his notifications to the much narrower definition of abutters
used in the Cambridge curb cut guidelines, meaning that few if any neighbors
were informed of his plans. This has been a continuing issue with this applicant.
Going forward, we would ask that he explain how he intends to better inform
neighbors of his intentions.
7) Finally, we would also note that this proposal received a letter of disapproval
from abutters on both sides of the property. It is a general policy of the FPRA to
support the amicable settlement of disputes and disagreements among
neighbors. As such, we believe that the applicant must negotiate further with
his abutters in order to reach an agreement on the matter, and that unless the
applicant and his neighbors are able to amicably resolve their current
differences, that you as the governing authority should deny approval of this
proposal.
Thank you for your time and attention in this important matter.
Sincerely,
Ann Sweeney

1) Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance states that lighting shall be provided to properly illuminate
parking areas. What will be done to satisfy this requirement, while also minimizing light
trespass towards the neighboring properties?
We do not see anything in Article 6 that pertains to illumination of a single parking space for a 12 family house. Please provide the exact section and wording to which you are referring.
That said, we plan to illuminate this parking space with a single exterior wall sconce similar to a
typical porch light.
2) Article 6 also specifies requirements for the screening of parking areas. The application shows
only a plan view of the curb cut and driveway, but says nothing about the plans for screening.
Can the applicant provide more details regarding their intentions as relates to screening?
Again, we don’t believe the screening requirement in Article 6 applies to a single space driveway
for a 1-2 family house. References to screening in Article 6 seem to apply to parking facilities of
five or more spaces. Please provide the exact section and wording to which you are referring.
3) Flooding, both surface and sub-surface, is a major concern in our neighborhood, and the
abutting foundation at 56 Standish Street is located only a few feet away from the proposed
driveway. Beyond using porous paving, what else does the applicant propose in order to
control runoff from paved areas?
Permeable pavers to be pitched toward the street and not toward abutting properties. We are also
installing gutters that did not previously exist on the house which will directly empty to the city
storm drain. We are, therefore, improving the water management on the lot overall.
4) As a part of the just-begun renovation efforts at 52 Standish Street, the developer recently
installed new storm water and sewer lines to the street. This required excavation within the
public way, resulting in Standish Street being closed to through traffic, including City garbage
trucks, for over a week. These closures were not announced in advance to the neighborhood, nor
was a police detail ever present to redirect traffic. Now that the street has been reopened and the
excavations covered with steel plates, what assurances does the community have that street
closures will be announced in advance in the future? Also, will the developer pay for a fullwidth repaving of the excavated section of roadway, or will the neighborhood now be forced to
deal with steel road plates and potholes forever?
We have done everything required in line with our permit with DPW, including requesting police
details. Unfortunately, requests are not always fulfilled and we have no control if the police
department sends a detail or not. Our work has been completed and the street patched according
to DPW requirements.

5) Since the applicant also owns 201.5 Lakeview Avenue, a landlocked property now under
construction immediately to the rear of 52 Standish Street, conversion of the driveway at 52
Standish Street into an access corridor for 201.5 Lakeview would eliminate any potential parking
benefits of the curb cut to the Standish Street neighborhood, as well as increase car noise to the
immediate abutters at all times of the day. As such, we would request that the applicant be clear
and honest with all concerned parties regarding his true intentions for this curb cut. In short,
what are the applicant’s long-term intentions as relates to a potential driveway easement
servicing the rear parcel?
We are asking for one parking space for 52 Standish Street only. That is the intent of this
application. We have no plans to create an “access corridor” through to 201.5 Lakeview Avenue
and have no idea where this idea is coming from. 201.5 Lakeview is not landlocked and already
has its own access through a private way and its own driveway.
6) And regarding the matter of concerned parties itself, under state law “Parties in Interest” to be
notified in matters related to land use include “owners of land directly opposite on any public or
private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line
of the petitioner.” Rather than using this higher standard of public engagement, the applicant
instead chose to restrict his notifications to the much narrower definition of abutters used in the
Cambridge curb cut guidelines, meaning that few if any neighbors were informed of his plans.
This has been a continuing issue with this applicant. Going forward, we would ask that he
explain how he intends to better inform neighbors of his intentions.
We have fulfilled the city guidelines and curb cut application requirements by notifying all
required abutters. The comment about a “continuing issue with this applicant” is inflammatory
and wholly untrue.
7) Finally, we would also note that this proposal received a letter of disapproval from abutters on
both sides of the property. It is a general policy of the FPRA to support the amicable settlement
of disputes and disagreements among neighbors. As such, we believe that the applicant must
negotiate further with his abutters in order to reach an agreement on the matter, and that
unless the applicant and his neighbors are able to amicably resolve their current differences, that
you as the governing authority should deny approval of this proposal.
It's true that we received letters of disapproval from both 48 Standish and 56 Standish. They
were attached to the permit application along with six approval letters from the remaining
abutters. After receipt of the negative responses, we reached out on August 9, 2022 via email to
Christine McEvoy of the trust that owns 56 Standish. Their property is most directly affected by
this proposed work. We asked that she share her specific concerns about the project so that we
could attempt to resolve them but received no response back.

WHEREAS:

Some residents in Cambridge drive and benefit from off-street parking spaces; not
every resident, however, drives a car, and so the City should not require, but still allow,
homes to have off-street parking spaces; and

WHEREAS:

Parking minimums can force homeowners and residential & commerical developers to
accommodate space for more parking than they deem necessary, leading to higher
project costs and a decrease in the number of units or amount of open space; and

ORDERED:

That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge be amended by substitution as
follows:
6.30 - PARKING QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS
6.31 Required Amount of Parking. Off street parking facilities shall be provided for
each use of a lot or structure in the amount specified in the schedule of parking
requirements contained in Subsection 6.36. Said schedule specifies the amount of
accessory off street parking required for each type of land use listed in "Table of Use
Regulations" in this Ordinance. The amount of required parking is also based on the
intensity of development permitted in the district in which the use is located.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the zoning, the minimum accessory parking
required for all uses shall be zero (0) parking spaces, including in all overlay districts.
a. Developers building more than 4 units of housing and/or Projects subject to Article
19 (Project Review Special Permit) shall provide a written report as part of the public
record and permitting process detailing the number of proposed parking and loading
spaces, and how that number was determined, including any surveys, parking demand
studies or other research that was conducted.
b. The Community Development Department shall provide the City Council with an
impact report no later than July 2025 detailing the number of parking spaces and
residential housing units that were added subsequent to the adoption of this provision.
and any discernible impacts the ordinance has had on the availability of on-street
parking.

THIS DOCUMENT SHOWS THE ORDINANCE AS AMENDED THROUGH OCTOBER 17, 2022

Amend Article 6.000 to read as follows
ARTICLE 6.000 OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS AND NIGHTTIME CURFEW ON
LARGE COMMERCIAL THROUGH TRUCKS
6.10 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY OF PARKING, BICYCLE PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
6.11 Intent. It is the intent of this Article 6.000 to reduce traffic congestion, noise, vibrations, fumes and safety
hazards caused by large commercial trucks, thereby promoting the safety, health and welfare of the
public, by establishing requirements for off street parking, bicycle parking and loading and restrictions on
the use of City street during the night-time by large commercial trucks with points of origin and
destinations outside the City of Cambridge in order to implement the purposed of the The Zoning Act,
Section 2A of Chapter 808, and Article 1.000. Section 1.30 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance,
including:
•

to lessen congestion in the streets;

•

to conserve health;

•

to conserve the value of land and buildings;

•

to prevent pollution of the environment;

•

to protect residential neighborhoods from incompatible activities; and

•

to preserve and increase the amenities of the city.
The regulations for parking, bicycle parking and loading spaces herein vary according to type, location
and intensity of development in the different zoning districts, and to proximity of public transit facilities.
This Article 6.000 allows development to provide adequate parking facilities to meet the reasonable
needs of all building and land users without establishing regulations which unnecessarily encourage
automobile usage. The parking and bicycle parking standards contained herein are intended to
encourage public transit, bicycle usage and walking in lieu of automobiles where a choice of travel mode
exists. It is also the purpose of this Article to allow flexibility in providing parking through shared or off site
arrangements in order to accommodate the automobile in the urban environment in a less disruptive
way. Development regulations and design standards have been established to reduce hazard to
pedestrians on public sidewalks, to ensure the usefulness of parking, bicycle parking and loading

facilities, and where appropriate, to avoid potential adverse impacts on adjacent land uses, and to
enhance the visual quality of the city.
6.12 Applicability. The off street parking and loading provisions of this Article 6.000 shall apply as follows:
(a) For new structures erected and new uses of land established or authorized after the effective date of
this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto, as well as for external additions of Gross Floor Area to
existing structures for any use, accessory off street parking and loading facilities shall comply with the
regulations for the districts in which such structures or uses are located.
In the case of an addition of Gross Floor Area to an existing structure (lawfully erected prior to the
effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto), which addition contains nonresidential
uses, loading facilities shall only be required when the total of such additions occurring from the
effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto increases the Gross Floor Area of the
existing structure by fifteen (15) percent or more and shall be provided for the total increase in
intensity subsequent to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto.
(b) When the intensity of an existing use within any existing structure (or lot in the case of 6.36.7 l and m
and 6.36.8 f and g) is increased through addition of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity or
other units of measurement specified in Section 6.30 or Section 6.60 (but not including any uses in a
new external addition to that structure, which shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (a)
above), loading facilities shall be provided as required for such increase in intensity of use and
accessory off-street parking may be provided if it conforms to the regulations for the use and district.
However, a nonresidential use lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or
any amendment thereto shall not be required to provide loading facilities for such increase unless and
until the aggregate increase in units of measure shall equal fifteen (15) percent or more of the units of
measurement existing upon said effective date. If such an increase occurs, additional loading facilities
as required herein shall be provided for the total increase in intensity subsequent to the effective date
of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto.
(c) When the use of an existing structure (but not including the use of a new external addition to that
structure, which shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (a) above) is changed to a new
nonresidential use, compliance with the schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36 and the
schedule of loading requirements in Subsection 6.60 shall be required. Any maximum requirements
specified in Subsection 6.36, as well as minimum requirements, shall be applicable to such changes
in use.
However, if said structure was lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any
amendment thereto, additional loading facilities shall be required only to the extent that the required
amount for the new nonresidential use would exceed the amount required for the previous use if said

previous use were subject to the schedule of parking and loading requirements.
(d) When the nonresidential use of an existing structure is changed to a residential use, off street parking
facilities shall conform to the schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36. Any maximum
requirements specified in Subsection 6.36, as well as minimum requirements, shall be applicable to
such changes in use.
(e) Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided according to the requirements set forth in Section
6.100. Wherever the term "parking" is used in this Zoning Ordinance without specific reference to
bicycles, such term shall refer to parking for motor vehicles and not bicycles.
However, if said structure was lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any
amendment thereto and the nonresidential use of the structure is proposed to be changed to an
Affordable Housing Project as herein defined, additional off street parking facilities shall be required
as provided above, except that for that portion of the Project consisting of Affordable Units additional
off street parking shall be provided at the rate of 60% of the parking otherwise required in Section
6.36.
For purposes of this Section 6.12 (d) an Affordable Housing Project shall be a residential
development in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling units are considered Affordable Units
for occupancy by Eligible Households as defined in Section 11.200 of the Zoning Ordinance.
6.13 Scope of Off Street Parking Regulations. All accessory parking facilities shall conform to all regulations set
forth in this Article governing the use, design and operation of such facilities. However, the provisions of
this Article 6.000, notwithstanding, any special parking requirements for townhouse developments
specified in Section 11.10, for planned unit developments specified in Article 13.000, for projects in the
Mixed Use Development District specified in Article 14.000 or for special permits specified elsewhere in
this Ordinance shall be applicable for those projects, except that the minimum accessory off-street
parking required for all uses in those instances shall be zero (0) parking spaces.
6.14 Restoration. When an existing structure or use is restored and resumes operation after being destroyed or
damaged by fire, explosion, or other catastrophe, bicycle parking and loading facilities shall be provided
at least equivalent to that in existence at the time of such destruction or damage. If the extent of such
damage is such that the cost of restoration is fifty (50) percent or more of the replacement value of the
structure or use, bicycle parking and loading facilities meeting the requirements of this Article 6.000 shall
be provided. However, in no case shall it be necessary to replace or continue any bicycle parking or
loading facilities which were in excess of those required by the requirements for equivalent amounts of
new uses or construction.

located, to the nearest transit station entrance, or to the nearest street line or other boundary of another
specified area.
6.23 Control of Off Site Parking Facilities. Where accessory parking facilities are allowed on land other than the
lot on which the use being served is located said other land shall be in identical ownership or binding
commitments shall exist to guarantee, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Superintendent of Buildings or
to the special permit granting authority, that the off site parking will continue to be available for the period
during which the use or uses that the parking serves may be expected to be in existence. Such

6.24 Carsharing Provisions. The provisions of this Section 6.24 shall govern the allowed use parking spaces for
Carsharing. Where the provisions of this Section 6.24 may conflict with any requirements set forth
elsewhere in this Ordinance, the provisions of this Section shall control.
6.24.1 Intent. This Section 6.24 is intended to allow the limited use of parking spaces for Carsharing as a means
to provide mobility options for Cambridge residents, employees and visitors who may not possess a
private automobile, thereby promoting City goals by increasing mobility, reducing reliance on automobile
ownership and use, and lessening the total demand for parking spaces.
6.24.2 Definitions. For the purpose of this Ordinance, Carsharing shall mean the use of parking spaces by
Carsharing Vehicles and Carsharing Organizations, as defined below:
(a) Carsharing Vehicle shall be defined as a private motor vehicle that is made available to members of a
Carsharing Organization primarily for hourly or other short-term use through a self-service fully
automated reservation system, but not by means of a separate written agreement that is entered into
each time a vehicle is transferred to a customer. A Carsharing Vehicle must be owned, maintained or
administered by a Carsharing Organization.
(b) Carsharing Organization shall be defined as a membership-based entity with a distributed fleet of
Carsharing Vehicles that charges a use-based fee related to a specific vehicle.
6.24.3 General Limitations:
(a) Carsharing Vehicles shall only be allowed in parking facilities that are lawfully established and
conforming to the dimensional and other requirements of Article 6.000, or, if not, are lawfully nonconforming.
(b) A Carsharing Vehicle authorized to this Section 6.24 shall be properly registered with the Registry of
Motor Vehicle.
(c) A Carsharing Vehicle located within an authorized parking facility shall be maintained for active use
by authorized operators and not stored for other purposes. No sales, servicing, dead storage, repair,
administrative or similar functions shall occur and no personnel shall be employed on the site except
for occasional short-term maintenance of vehicles (such as interior vacuuming) unless otherwise
permitted by the use regulations in the zoning district.
(d) Carsharing Vehicles administered by a Carsharing Organization shall be routinely accessed directly
by users without any assistance or supervision by company personnel.
(e) All owners of that portion of a lot accommodating the operation or parking of a Carsharing Vehicle, or
their legally authorized representative, including a condominium association where applicable, shall
be required to grant permission for the operation or parking of a Carsharing Vehicle on their property.
(f) Parking spaces devoted to Carsharing Vehicles shall be registered with the Traffic, Parking and
Transportation Department (TPTD), which shall keep a recorded of the address, location, number of

Attachment: Ordinance # 2022-5 -Amend Article 6.000 (Parking Requirements) (POR 2022 #19 : Direct

2.3.d

Packet Pg. 127

spaces, property ownership, and Carsharing Organization if applicable, and certify that such spaces
may accommodate the operation of Carsharing Vehicles in accordance with all applicable laws, rules,
or regulations. If any such spaces are relocated within a facility, or if the property ownership or
Carsharing Organization is changed, then the registration with TPTD shall be updated accordingly
within one month. TPTD may promulgate more detailed regulations pertaining to the safe operation
as to which parking spaces on a lot are best suited to Carsharing Vehicles operations.
(g) Prior to assigning parking spaces for use by Carsharing Vehicles, the Carsharing Organization shall
send a written notification to all residential dwellings within one hundred (100) feet of the facility in
which the spaces are located, including any access and egress drives. Notifications shall be sent to
individual dwelling units or to a residential building manager if applicable, to distributed to residents.
The notification shall, at a minimum, provide contact information for the Carsharing Organization so
that residents may ask questions or report concerns related to the operation of the Carsharing
Vehicles. A copy of notification and a list of the addresses to which it was sent shall be provided to
TPTD upon register the parking spaces.
6.25.4 Principal Use Parking Provisions:
(a) Within principal use parking facilities established under the provisions of Section 4.32(b) (Automobile
Parking Lot for Private Passenger Car) or Commercial Parking Facilities registered with the
Department of Traffic, Parking and Transportation per the provisions of Chapter 10.16 of the
Cambridge Municipal Code, there shall be no limitations on the number of Carsharing Vehicles that
may be maintained for active use at the facility.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the maintenance of Carsharing Vehicles
for active use within a principal use or commercial parking facility in accordance with this Section 6.24
shall not cause any change in the use designation of that facility or affect any other regulation that
may be applicable to that facility.
6.24.4 Accessory Parking Provisions.
(a) Within parking facilities that are accessory to non-residential uses, there shall be no limitation on the
number of Carsharing Vehicles that may be maintained for active use at the facility.
(b) Within parking facilities that are accessory to residential uses, the number of parking spaces
maintained for active use by Carsharing Vehicles shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of either
the minimum number of parking spaces required by zoning or special permit or the number of parking
spaces provided to serve the principal residential use on the lot, whichever is greater.
(c) Driveways of single-family residential homes may not be used by Carsharing Vehicles, except when
the Carsharing Vehicle is being used by a resident of or visitor to the single family home.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the maintenance of Carsharing Vehicles
within an accessory parking facility in accordance with this Section 6.24 shall not cause any change
in the use of that facility nor any violation of the accessory parking requirements applicable to the

Attachment: Ordinance # 2022-5 -Amend Article 6.000 (Parking Requirements) (POR 2022 #19 : Direct

2.3.d

Packet Pg. 128

principal uses served by that facility, provided that such Carsharing Vehicles are available for use by
any occupant of the principal use that is otherwise qualified to operate a motor vehicle. Where a
Carsharing Vehicle is owned or operated by a Carsharing Organization, ordinary fees and other terms
of service may apply.
6.24.5 Allowed Modifications.
(a) Grandfathering. Parking spaces that were lawfully used by Carsharing Vehicles as of the date of the
first publication of notice of the public hearing by the Planning Board of this Section 6.24 shall be
allowed to continue to be maintained for active use by Carsharing Vehicles regardless of whether or
not the limitations of this Section 6.24 are met. All such parking spaces must be registered with the
Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department in accordance with Section 6.24.3,
paragraph (g) within six months of the date of adoption of this Section.
(b) Special Permit. The Planning Board may approve any modifications to the limitations set forth in
Section 6.24.5 upon issuance of a special permit, which shall be granted if the Planning Board finds
that the requested modification is consistent with the intent set forth in Section 6.24.1 and conforms to
the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43 of this Zoning Ordinance.

6.30 PARKING QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS
6.31 Required Amount of Parking. Off street parking facilities shall be allowed for each use of a lot or structure in
the amount specified in the schedule of parking requirements contained in Subsection 6.36. Said
schedule specifies the maximum amount of accessory off street parking allowed for each type of land use
listed in "Table of Use Regulations" in this Ordinance. The maximum amount of allowed parking is also
based on the intensity of development permitted in the district in which the use is located.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Zoning Ordinance, the minimum accessory parking required
for all uses shall be zero (0) parking spaces.
(a) Developers building more than 4 units of housing and/or Projects subject to Article 19 (Project Review
Special Permit) shall provide a written report as part of the public record and permitting process detailing
the number of proposed parking and loading spaces, and how that number was determined, including any
surveys, parking demand studies or other research that was conducted.
(b) The Community Development Department shall provide the City Council with an impact report no later
than July 2025 detailing the number of parking spaces and residential housing units that were added
subsequent to the adoption of this provision and any discernible impacts the ordinance has had on the
availability of on-street parking.
6.31.1 The schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36 specifies the unit of measure regulating the
provision of parking spaces. Square footage requirements are geared to gross floor area. Each unit of

Attachment: Ordinance # 2022-5 -Amend Article 6.000 (Parking Requirements) (POR 2022 #19 : Direct

2.3.d

Packet Pg. 129

measure, however, shall specifically not apply to any Gross Floor Area devoted to parking facilities, which
shall not require the provision of any accessory parking.
6.31.2 In general the schedule in Subsection 6.36 specifies a maximum amount of parking [Example: for a general
office use (6.36.4 d) in a Business C district, the maximum is one space per 400 square feet of gross floor
area.] Where there are two such listings the first is the minimum requirement and the second is the
maximum limitation. Relief from the parking requirements may be obtained only after the grant of a special
permit as provided in Section 6.35 below. With the grant of a special permit the maximum parking limitation
may be exceeded provided, however, that the provisions with regard to gross floor area as set forth in
Section 6.31.3 are met.
6.31.3 Any parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum requirements specified in Section 6.36 shall be
counted in determining Gross Floor Area. In such cases a proportional share of the entire parking facility
(not only the area of the spaces) shall be credited toward Gross Floor Area. The area counted as Gross
Floor Area shall be determined by multiplying the total area of the parking facility by the percentage that
the proposed number of spaces exceeds the maximum allowed number of spaces.
6.31.4 For uses not listed in Subsection 6.36, the Board of Zoning Appeal shall determine the required amount of
parking if it issues a use variance for such use.
6.31.5 All commercial uses shall also be required to provide a parking space for each commercial vehicle
customarily used in conjunction with the operation of such use at such location.
6.32Parking Exemptions.
6.32.1 Small Business. The minimum amount of parking required by Subsection 6.36 Schedule of Parking and
Loading Requirements shall be waived for any nonresidential use in an office, business, or industrial district
if such use would require four (4) or fewer spaces, and such nonresidential use is located in a building or
row of attached buildings which contains a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less of gross floor
area devoted to nonresidential use. Furthermore, for a new nonresidential use within a building in existence
on or before October 19, 2020, no new accessory parking shall be required.
6.32.2 Institutions. Where an institution provides dormitory, fraternity, faculty, employee or other residence
accommodations, the number of parking spaces provided as a result thereof may be deducted from the
requirements established to satisfy the needs of classrooms, libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, similar
educational areas or dining facilities normally used by such residential occupants. In order to qualify for
such deduction, the institutional applicant shall submit to the Building Department the institution's current
residential parking plan clearly indicating the location of all existing and proposed residential parking
facilities available at the institution.
6.33 Computation. Where a building or lot is used by two or more activities that fall into different classes of use in
Subsection 6.36, the off street parking requirements shall be the sum of the requirements for each individual
use. Parking spaces for accessory uses shall be determined in the same manner as for principal use. Where
the computation results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one.

Attachment: Ordinance # 2022-5 -Amend Article 6.000 (Parking Requirements) (POR 2022 #19 : Direct

2.3.d

Packet Pg. 130

Where the computation of parking requirements for a building with more than one class of use results in
multiple fractional numbers, such fractions shall be carried to the final sum.
6.34 Parking Space Size Allocation. In all parking facilities containing five or more spaces, a combination of regular
and compact spaces may be provided; however, no more than fifty (50) percent of the provided spaces
shall be designed for compact cars (as specified in Subsection 6.42). All off street parking facilities shall
contain spaces designed for handicapped access. The number of such spaces shall be determined by the
requirements of the currently applicable "Rules and Regulations of the Architectural Barriers Board of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts."
6.35 Relief from Parking Requirements. Any required amount of parking may be reduced by issuance of a special
permit from Board of Zoning Appeals, as provided below. However, handicapped parking required by
Subsection 6.34, and commercial vehicle parking required by Subsection 6.31.5 shall not be reduced from
the original requirement. Bicycle parking requirements may not be modified pursuant to this Section 6.35,
and may be modified only as allowed in Section 6.100. The parking maximum limitation may be exceeded
only with the grant of a special permit from the Planning Board, as provided below, subject to the provisions
with regard to Gross Floor Area as provided in Section 6.31.3.
6.35.1 Reduction of Required Parking. Any minimum required amount of parking may be reduced only upon
issuance of a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals. A special permit shall be granted only if
the Board determines and cites evidence in its decision that the lesser amount of parking will not cause
excessive congestion, endanger public safety, substantially reduce parking availability for other uses or
otherwise adversely impact the neighborhood, or that such lesser amount of parking will provide positive
environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot and the neighborhood, including specifically, among
other benefits, assisting in the provision of affordable housing units. In making such a determination the
Board shall also consider whether or not less off street parking is reasonable in light of the following:
(1) The availability of surplus off street parking in the vicinity of the use being served and/or the proximity
of an MBTA transit station.
(2) The availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of the use being served
provided the requirements of Section 6.23 are satisfied.
(3) Shared use of off street parking spaces serving other uses having peak user demands at different
times, provided that no more than seventy-five (75) percent of the lesser minimum parking
requirements for each use shall be satisfied with such shared spaces and that the requirements of
Subsection 6.23 are satisfied.
(4) Age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level of auto usage; and
(5) Impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the affected lot or the adjacent lots
including reduction in green space, destruction of significant existing trees and other vegetation,
destruction of existing dwelling units, significant negative impact on the historic resources on the lot,

Attachment: Ordinance # 2022-5 -Amend Article 6.000 (Parking Requirements) (POR 2022 #19 : Direct

2.3.d

Packet Pg. 131

impairment of the urban design objectives of the city as set forth in Section 19.30 of the Zoning
Ordinance, or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways.
(6) The provision of required parking for developments containing affordable housing units, and
especially for developments employing the increased FAR and Dwelling unit density provisions of
Section 11.200, will increase the cost of the development, will require variance relief from other
zoning requirements applicable to the development because of limitations of space on the lot, or will
significantly diminish the environmental quality for all residents of the development.
For a project seeking a reduction in required off-street parking for residential uses, a Parking Analysis
shall be required as part of the Special Permit Application as set forth in Section 6.35.3.
6.35.2 Exceeding Maximum Allowed Parking. Any maximum allowed amount of parking may be exceeded only
upon issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board. Any parking area in excess of the maximum
limitation will have an impact on calculation of gross floor area as provided at Section 6.31.3. The Planning
Board shall grant a special permit to allow exceedance of a maximum limitation only upon making the
following determinations:
(1) Reasonable parking and transportation demand management measures are being implemented to
reduce the need for the additional off street parking;
(2) The additional spaces reflect parking demand that exceeds that which is common for this use as
categorized in Section 6.36, owing to unique characteristics of the users or the activity that result in a
high level of automobile parking demand;
(3) The additional parking demand cannot reasonably be accommodated through contract or other
arrangement making use of available off-site parking;
(4) The additional parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot, to
the neighborhood and the City which outweigh adverse effects, after consideration of the following:
congestion, traffic increases on residential streets, danger to public safety or deterioration of travel
conditions for pedestrians, cyclists or users of public transit.
In its decision the Planning Board shall cite evidence supporting its determinations, and may impose
such conditions as are necessary to mitigate all negative impacts on the neighborhood and the
environment which would otherwise result from the greater allowed amount of parking.
6.35.3 Parking Analysis.
6.35.31 The purpose of a Parking Analysis is to provide quantitative data to assist a special permit granting authority
in considering certain projects. A Parking Analysis shall be submitted where it is specifically required by
any provision of this Zoning Ordinance. A special permit granting authority may also request that elements
of a Parking Analysis be provided when considering a project that proposes a deviation from parking

Attachment: Ordinance # 2022-5 -Amend Article 6.000 (Parking Requirements) (POR 2022 #19 : Direct

2.3.d

Packet Pg. 132

requirements specified in the Zoning Ordinance or an increase in development density above the maximum
allowed as-of-right under base zoning regulations.
6.35.32 Where a Parking Analysis is specifically required by any provision of this Zoning Ordinance, the proponent
shall first consult with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department to determine the scope and
methodology of such an analysis. The results of the Parking Analysis shall be included in any Special Permit
Application for the project.
6.35.33 For residential projects, a Parking Analysis shall include some or all of the following, with the specific type
and level of analysis to be determined by the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department based on the
relevant characteristics of the proposal:
(a) Estimates of the project's parking demand, as evidenced by vehicle ownership rates and peak
parking occupancy data for comparable nearby residential projects, resident parking permit and motor
vehicle registration data for the area, and/or other indicators of parking demand. These estimates
should account for daytime and nighttime parking. Estimates may account for differences in parking
demand given the occupancy of units, such as owner-occupied vs. rental units, market-rate vs.
below-market-rate units, or elderly-oriented vs. conventional units. Estimates may also account for
anticipated vacancy rates.
(b) Maps showing the distance to alternate transportation options in the area, including MBTA rapid
transit stations and bus routes, bike facilities, and car-sharing services.
(c) Studies of on-street parking capacity and utilization in the vicinity of the project. Such studies should
be conducted at night, and should account for the normal activity hours of other land uses in the area.
(d) Where applicable, inventories and peak occupancy data for nearby off-site parking that will be
available to the project's residents or visitors, either on a round-the-clock basis or by way of a shared
use arrangement. Private, off-site parking shall only be applicable to the analysis if a long-term
leasing arrangement is proposed to be made. Shared parking arrangements should be studied
thoroughly to determine the minimum amount of parking required to satisfy the demand from all
proposed land uses during any given time period.
(e) A description of measures that will be implemented to reduce demand for private automobile use,
such as the availability of car-sharing programs and/or incentives for residents or employees to walk,
bicycle, or use public transportation, and estimates of the anticipated impact of those measures on
parking demand.
6.36 Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements. Off street parking shall be provided as shown in the
following table. Where one entry is given in the table, it is the maximum requirement. All square foot
measurements refer to gross floor area unless specified otherwise. The abbreviation "d.u." means
dwelling unit. The abbreviation n/a means not applicable. In cases where a requirement is expressed in
number of seats, twenty (20) square feet of public floor area shall equal one seat if there are no fixed
seats. One column of the table contains the loading requirement standard applicable under Section 6.80

FIRST IN COUNCIL
October 24, 2022

COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

Over 100 million animals are killed annually for their fur; and

WHEREAS:

These animals are bred and confined and forced to live in cramped, wire bottom cages
and deprived of the ability to engage in natural behaviors; and

WHEREAS:

Egregious animal cruelty is the norm in the fur industry. Animals are killed in
inhumane ways such as crude gassing or anal electrocution; and

WHEREAS:

There are no federal laws or animal welfare standards to protect animals on fur
farms leading to immense suffering; and

WHEREAS:

The fur trade poses serious risks to public health, for example, in wildlife markets in
China, foxes and raccoon dogs were found to have been infected with the SARS
coronaviruses and on US and European fur farms, mink tested positive for the virus
that causes COVID19, resulting in the death of over 5 million mink and the Dutch
government said it is “very likely” that the farmed mink spread the virus to humans;
and

WHEREAS:

The fur industry also poses serious environmental threats. On fur farms, waste runoff
from animals pollutes the soil and waterways and the tanning and dying process uses
toxic and carcinogenic chemicals like chromium and formaldehyde to prevent the skin
from decaying; and

WHEREAS:

Banning fur sales eliminates the demand for cruel products and ensures that humane
minded consumers can shop with confidence; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge, currently does not have stores that sell fur, but nothing in our municipal
code would prevent fur shops or sales; and

WHEREAS:

Communities in Massachusetts including, Plymouth, Brookline, Weston,
and Wellesley have passed local ordinances to prevent this cruel industry from
operating in their municipalities; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council meet to amend the
Cambridge Municipal Code by adding a chapter numbered 6.24, titled Sale of Fur
Apparel Products.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE That the
Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is hereby amended by adding a
chapter, to be numbered Chapter 6.24, which said Chapter reads as follows:

6.24.010 – Council Findings
(a) The City Council finds that animals that are slaughtered for their fur endure
tremendous suffering. Animals raised on fur farms typically spend their entire lives in
cramped and filthy cages. Fur farmers typically use the cheapest killing methods available,
including suffocation, electrocution, gas and poison.
(b) The City Council finds that fur farms are reservoirs and transmission vectors for
dangerous zoonotic diseases, including SARS coronaviruses, that threaten public health,
including in the City of Cambridge. COVID-19 infections have been confirmed at fur farms
in Europe and the United States, and scientific studies have linked mink, raccoon dogs, and
foxes – the animals most commonly farmed for their fur – to a variety of coronaviruses.
(c) The City Council finds that the fur production process is energy intensive and has a
significant environmental impact, including air and water pollution. Runoff from the fur
production process contains high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen, which are the
most common forms of water pollution in the United States. In addition, the tanning and
dying processes used in fur production use toxic chemicals and heavy metals like chromium
and formaldehyde.
(b) Considering the wide array of alternatives for fashion and apparel, the City Council
finds that the demand for fur products does not justify the unnecessary killing and cruel
treatment of animals, harm to the environment, and the public health risks to the people of
the City of Cambridge caused by these practices.
(c) The City Council believes that eliminating the sale of fur products in the City of
Cambridge will decrease demand for these cruel and environmentally harmful products and
promote community awareness of animal welfare and, in turn, will foster a more humane
environment in the City of Cambridge and enhance the reputation of the City.
6.24.020 - Definitions
The following definitions shall apply in this section:
(a) Fur shall mean any animal skin or part thereof with hair, fleece, or fur fibers
attached thereto, either in its raw or processed state.
(b) Fur product shall mean any article of clothing or covering for any part of the body, or
any fashion accessory, including but not limited to handbags, shoes, slippers, hats,
earmuffs, scarves, shawls, gloves, jewelry, keychains, toys or trinkets, and home accessories
and décor, that is made in whole or part of fur. “Fur product” does not include any of the
following:

with the provisions of G.L. c.40, § 32, and no earlier than January 1, 2023.

ORDINANCE NO. 2022-17 - FIRST PUBLICATION
In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty-two
AN ORDINANCE
In amendment to the Ordinance entitled “Cambridge Municipal Code.”
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE That the
Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is hereby amended by adding a
chapter, to be numbered Chapter 6.24, which said Chapter reads as follows:
Chapter 6.24 Sale of Fur Apparel Products.
6.24.010 – Council Findings
(a) The City Council finds that animals that are slaughtered for their fur endure
tremendous suffering. Animals raised on fur farms typically spend their entire lives in
cramped and filthy cages. Fur farmers typically use the cheapest killing methods available,
including suffocation, electrocution, gas and poison.
(b) The City Council finds that fur farms are reservoirs and transmission vectors for
dangerous zoonotic diseases, including SARS coronaviruses, that threaten public health,
including in the City of Cambridge. COVID-19 infections have been confirmed at fur farms
in Europe and the United States, and scientific studies have linked mink, raccoon dogs, and
foxes – the animals most commonly farmed for their fur – to a variety of coronaviruses.
(c) The City Council finds that the fur production process is energy intensive and has a
significant environmental impact, including air and water pollution. Runoff from the fur
production process contains high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen, which are the
most common forms of water pollution in the United States. In addition, the tanning and
dying processes used in fur production use toxic chemicals and heavy metals like chromium
and formaldehyde.
(d) Considering the wide array of alternatives for fashion and apparel, the City Council
finds that the demand for fur products does not justify the unnecessary killing and cruel
treatment of animals, harm to the environment, and the public health risks to the people of
the City of Cambridge caused by these practices.
(e) The City Council believes that eliminating the sale of fur products in the City of
Cambridge will decrease demand for these cruel and environmentally harmful products and
promote community awareness of animal welfare and, in turn, will foster a more humane
environment in the City of Cambridge and enhance the reputation of the City.
6.24.020 - Definitions
The following definitions shall apply in this section:

Dear City Council Members and City Manager Huang:
Please consider the damage that will be inflicted on small to mid-sized businesses and property owners, and to the
future of affordable housing in Cambridge and make no further changes to the PO #84 as amended.
We are in the grips of a recession, interest rates continue to climb precipitously, and construction costs are skyrocketing.
Please do not let Cambridge lose its character and diversity. Do not jeopardize affordable housing objectives and further
marginalize small businesses.
Please do not let Cambridge become a city of labs, corporate offices, and big box stores, losing its small-businesses,
affordable housing, and pushing younger families farther out the the suburbs.
Thank you,
Vickey Bestor

Parking Minimums

Honorable Mayor, City Manager, and Cambridge City Councillors,
I urge you to read some of the recent studies on parking minimums before the vote on removing them in Cambridge.
A recent peer review study of Buffalo NY’s decision to end parking minimums HERE points out that the results of their
decision have been very mixed. While new “mixed use” buildings (say labs and housing, or offices and housing) did
decrease their parking amounts by 53%. “New single use” buildings (commercial, civic, or residential) increased parking
allotments above the prior minimums after this change (64% for commercial, 117% for civic, and 17% for residential.
They do note that “Well-connected corridors and the central core appear more likely to support dense, mixed-use
developments with fewer parking spaces.” This is what our own Envision report encouraged. In Cambridge new singleand two-family homes (market rate infill structures primarily, or current residential demolitions) will still probably
include parking because of the huge demand for this and the sizable profit for residences with parking. This is what new
owners of multi-million-dollar homes expect. Unfortunately, the Buffalo report left out both new single-family and twofamily homes there and properties under 5,000 square feet so we have no real comparative data.

In addition to this recent Buffalo New York overview, we also have a study from Portland Oregon impacts of
parking minimum changes, where we learn that:
"In general, the survey of residents does not show a relationship between the availability of on-site
parking and car ownership among residents…. Residents at buildings with on-site parking and those
without had similar levels of vehicle ownership."
In short if the aim of this new city-wide zoning ordinance is to lower the number of vehicles on Cambridge
streets, this decision is not likely to help – and may make things worse. While there is downwards trend in car
ownership nationally, since we are increasing the number of residential units and commercial workers so
significantly, we are unlikely to see our vehicle ownership or vehicle registrations diminishing. What is
surprising moreover is that the City also seems to have no idea how many cars there will be per 100 new units
on the city streets.
One additional concern that has been raised about this decision is whether the Ordinance is written in such a
way that will allow people to plug in (and rent out) mobile homes or similar forms on their properties.
If this goes forward, it will be important in our 3-year study that ALL new buildings (and significant additions)
be included in the analysis all new residential structures (single family, two-family, and larger residences) be
addressed from the vantage of added parking and/or vehicles of property owners, as well as any increase or
decrease in car registrations, parking registrations, and or traffic congestion. See also this Boston
Globe article.

Harvard Square Zoning Petition - revision re. financial institutions

Honorable Mayor, City Manager, and Cambridge City Councillors,
The Harvard Square Neighborhood Association has submitted a revision of the Harvard Square Zoning Petition to
address specifically the linear ground floor frontage of financial institutions in Harvard Square. The earlier Harvard
Square zoning petition was approved unanimously by both the Planning Board and City Council and we hope that this
one also will be well received. This petition clarifies the original language; the revision is a very simple one that limits
financial institutions to a TOTAL of 25 linear frontage feet on all ground floor street facing façades. We urge you to
support this revised zoning petition.
Recently two banks have begun work to open offices in Harvard Square in prime ground floor corner properties. Chase
bank will take up a large space in the newly rebuilt Regency (Urban Outfitter) building. This bank will have two prime
locale entries – one on Brattle St. and one on JFK –– surpassing the 25 foot minimum that was the intent of our original
petition. They are doing so by distributing this footage across two different streets. Santander bank in turn will move
from its current locale near Bank of America into another (larger) prime corner property with a frontage that exceeds
the 25 linear feet ground floor frontage. By limiting financial institutions to a TOTAL of 25 linear feet, rather than a
percentage of the whole ground floor frontage, we hope to prevent future financial institutions from doing the same
thing.
The reasons that this is important is not only that most people now bank on line but also that financial institutions (and
others) use Harvard Square locales as billboards to attract future student customers. Moreover, the large spaces taken
up by banks make it more difficult for smaller local businesses to move into Harvard Square because banks drive up
lease prices and take up critically needed commercial spaces. In addition, the Harvard Square Conservation District
guidelines call for transparent windows to enliven the pedestrian experience and banks must have window coverings or
opaque windows to prevent passersby by from seeing financial documents, making financial institutions less appealing
in such settings. The 25 feet frontage allotment is enough space to allow such instutions to have machines for bank
withdrawals as well as access to elevators or stairs so that employees and customers can reach bank offices on other
levels. Similar guidelines have long been in place in some other cities, including Burlington, Vt.
Recently we have learned of a significant drop in the percentage of local businesses in Harvard Square ground floor
properties in relation to national chains (formula businesses) so the issue of both available commercial properties and
lease prices is especially critical.
In our petition revision, we also have added language to preclude financial institutions from creating faux art
galleries/display areas along their facades to mitigate the 25 feet requirement. Such spaces often are so narrow that
they are not accessible to the art going public and do not meet disability requirements.

Cordially,
Suzanne Preston Blier
President

Massive Linkage increase from $20 to $33 is insane on the heels of Covid + Inflation +
Recession? Bad idea, Bad Timing, Bad Reasoning, Bad precedent set in S.F.

Is this a desperate action akin to swinging for a homerun at the bottom of the ninth but to what
desperate end? Look at the reasonable increases over the years compared to the massive jump you
are proposing right now--reasonable is always the way to go, not this dramatic jump which will kill not
achieve your goals.
And right on the heels of Covid which is not really over despite what re-election seeking politicians
keep espousing. Inflation is real and is getting worse and you know what the FED will continue doing
to interest rates and how that will affect real estate and construction costs while rent and salaries try
to catch up. And there isn't a single CEO of any major company that doesn't think there is a recession
in force now and for the foreseeable future. You will be chasing developers out of Cambridge when
now is the time to help them continue building. Small business owners/developers will be
disproportionately affected and are the least able to deal with this Herculean increases as they have
no pricing power over labor or materials. The building of the biotech hub for the entire world is in
jeopardy, and you want to bite the hands that feed all of Cambridge? Surely the majority of you can
see the perfect storm that is upon us but you want to add a massively negative variable to this perfect
storm to tip further into the negative?
I urge you to reconsider and perhaps scuttle this entire Shakespearean-sized tragic proposal and/or
reasonably amend it to reflect today's & tomorrow's ACTUAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC
REALITIES not some platonic ideal that you aspire to. Math is math, economics are economics, and
wishful thinking that usually resides in Communist five year plans like this never work--jumping from
$20 to $33 reeks of the failed communist aspirations that my family ran away from decades ago.
Learn from their mistakes or be fated to repeat them--killing a golden goose during a time of
starvation doesn't solve problems, it creates problems.
Is this the future you are building for Cambridge: https://www.spur.org/news/2018-11-08/how-hassan-francisco-run-out-money-affordable-housing the pathway you are proposing will, just like SF,
lead you to the opposite direction.

October 19th: Cambridge Street Study: Findings and Recommendations Update

Hi,
I wanted to write to express some general reflections upon viewing the materials produced at public meetings and in
this findings report.
First, I want to express my deep appreciation for the extensive process of public engagement with the future of
Cambridge Street. I have called Inman Square and Cambridge Street home for the last 3+ years, and while I was not as
directly involved with many of these meetings as I would have liked, besides through online surveys, I can see a really
concerted effort to understand our collective vision for its future through the materials created and ultimately the
presentation of last week's meeting.
Second, I wanted to express my strong support for all proposals that look to celebrate the rich history of Cambridge St,
and provide additional cultural and community programming, while also maintaining significant spaces for quiet daily
use.
Third, I would like to express my support for efforts to leverage incentive funding on developments to help maintain
affordable rents for specifically local and community-oriented businesses.
Fourth, I would like to express my strong support for the strongest possible mixed-use zoning proposals. For me, this fits
with the character and goals of Cambridge St, and can very easily see up to 6 story mixed use development in some
areas and perhaps up to 9-10 stories in other areas. The impact of even the 11 story maximum (which I would like to see
restricted to development with a high % of affordable housing, say 40-50%) does not seem too burdensome.
Fifth, and most importantly, I would like to express my strong support for an outright ban on the presence of labs on
Cambridge St. There is more than adequate space elsewhere, and we already have a crisis of continued biotech and lab
development causing displacement throughout Cambridge. Moreover, Cambridge St as a celebration of its surrounding
community and intended for its use would not be benefited by additional lab development.
All the best,

City Council Meeting, October 17th

Hi,
I'd like to write to express:
- Strong support for CMA 2022#193
- Strong support for POR 2022#19, related to minimum parking requirements
- Support for POR2022#84, except with the qualification that the exemption for "existing floor area that is demolished
and subsequently rebuilt as part of a building project" should be removed. There is no principled reason why we should
be incentivizing demolition of existing structures in this way (vs. renovation of an existing space, which is taxed), this
takes unnecessarily away from money that can go to affordable housing, and support for businesses who wish to pursue
demolition and reconstruction that is widely supported can be accessed differently.
- Strong support for POR2022#175
- Support for the Harvard Square zoning petition limiting frontage for banks
- Tentative support for POR2022#267: I agree with the main premise, that we should always be looking to understand
retrospectively the effect of these policies, and CDD should be doing this work. However, I do not agree with part of the
policy order that mentions that it would be prudent to do this work "before the City looks to enact further policies or
initiatives related to development." Time is scarce and the crisis is present, and it will only be clear in years, not
months, the effect of each of these policies.

HOMELESS EMPLOYMENT HIRING TAX CREDIT?

Peace Be Unto You
Dear City Clerk, would you added the follow Communication Agenda Item to the upcoming City Council Agenda or next
available one? Thank you. It is as follows:
HOMELESS EMPLOYMENT HIRING TAX CREDIT?
The City of Cambridge, Massachusetts should enact into local law a " Homeless Employment Hiring Tax Credit (HHTC), it
should be made available to a qualified taxpayer that employs a homeless individual. The reason for this local legislation
is to create good jobs and living wages for homeless individuals. The Cambridge Continuum of Care (CoC) should be
designated as the Certifying Agency. A Certifying Agency will confirm employer and employee eligibility, and provide the
certification for the employer. The HHTC certification is to be completed by the Cambridge CoC, or a community based
service provider to certify that the eligible individual, is experiencing homelessness as defined by Massachusetts law.
Only organizations that are connected to the local coordination system or to a local homeless management system may
certify an eligible individual. The certificate should expire one year after issuance.
Yours In Peace

Pro Bono Technical Assistance to Jurisdictions Seeking Extra Capacity to Advance
Prevention and Rehousing Initiatives

Dear Colleagues,

I am excited to announce a call for applications for pro bono technical assistance as part of
the Government Performance Lab’s new Homelessness Prevention & Rehousing
Accelerator — an initiative through our Homelessness & Housing practice designed to
support jurisdictions implementing reforms to reduce homelessness in their communities.
In our work at the GPL, we’ve heard from jurisdictions across the country that homeless
response systems that were intended to address temporary housing emergencies have
become stretched too thin. Jurisdictions urgently need to reduce the rising numbers of
unhoused individuals, but they are also struggling to build sustainable systems that prevent

Technical assistance to reduce homelessness
Summary
Today, jurisdictions of all sizes are facing a crisis of housing affordability and availability, struggling to support
a homeless response workforce that is strained from more than two years of managing the pandemic, and
grappling with what will happen as pandemic-related resources and protections come to an end. But the
pressure has been mounting on homeless response systems since long before the pandemic. Local systems
originally intended to address temporary housing emergencies have been stretched too thin, responsible for
managing the rising numbers of unhoused individuals1 while also recognizing the urgent need to build a
sustainable system that incorporates prevention for future inflow and expanded housing options for outflow.
Many jurisdictions are eager to test innovative solutions in homelessness reduction and are seeking additional
capacity to support these efforts. The Government Performance Lab (GPL) can provide hands-on support
protected from the day-to-day emergencies of agencies’ operational work to help move these efforts towards a
sustainable model that reduces homelessness.
Government Performance Lab Homelessness Prevention & Rehousing Accelerator
The Government Performance Lab (GPL) is offering selected jurisdictions dedicated capacity to move
prevention and/or rehousing initiatives forward over the course of one year. Selected jurisdictions will be
awarded pro bono technical assistance from the GPL for 12 months with the possibility of extension. There will
be a limited number of pro bono slots available. The GPL plans to provide support in the following areas:
Prevention: Reduce inflow to homelessness through upstream systems or community intervention
points and targeting of housing assistance investments.
• Topic #1: Reduce the likelihood of individuals exiting a system (e.g. criminal justice, child welfare) into
homelessness by bringing agencies together to develop shared goals, improve discharge and aftercare
processes, and align on prioritized access to housing resources.
• Topic #2: Support individuals to retain their housing in communities with high rates of eviction, rent-burden,
or homelessness entry by leveraging trusted local organizations and coordinating services to improve
connections to best-fit housing resources.
• Topic #3: Mitigate the harm of reductions in pandemic-related federal rental assistance by designing new,
local rental assistance programs or redesigning pre-existing programs.
Rehousing: Optimize existing subsidized housing opportunities by shortening the lease-up time
through streamlined, client-centered processes and expand housing opportunities for priority
populations through new models.
• Topic #4: Reduce the amount of time it takes for individuals to move into subsidized housing by making the
referral and eligibility verification process more effective, efficient, and client-centered.
• Topic #5: Address structural rehousing barriers for specific homeless populations (e.g. justice involved,
young adults, medical needs) by aligning on priorities, improving processes, and developing new
programs.
Application Process
Who should apply: This opportunity is open to state or local jurisdictions or Continuum of Care (CoC)
Collaborative Applicants in conjunction with a government partner.
How to apply: To apply, please complete and submit this application by 5 PM PST on Friday, November 18,
2022. This initial application should take no more than 30 minutes to complete. Register here for our upcoming
informational webinar on November 2, 2022, at 2 p.m. EST to learn more.
Process: Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Following submission of the first-round application
above, the GPL may invite applicants to participate in 1-2 phone interviews starting in late fall to better
understand current work around identified initiatives and needs for support. As part of the final selection
process, we may also request letters of support from leadership or other relevant stakeholders and an
agreement to sign a memorandum of understanding.

Overview of Prevention & Rehousing Accelerator Technical Assistance
The GPL will provide selected jurisdictions with significant dedicated capacity for 12 months with the possibility
to extend longer. The GPL team will work shoulder-to-shoulder with government staff and other stakeholders
on discrete initiatives, from diagnosing key challenges through to implementing and sustaining new initiatives.
In addition to dedicated staffing, selected jurisdictions will also receive:
• Exposure to relevant models from other jurisdictions and facilitated opportunities to workshop
implementation efforts with jurisdictions tackling similar initiatives.
• Training modules to build agency staff capacity on core GPL tools around data-driven performance
management, designing service arrays and referral pathways, and/or procurement.
Prevention & Rehousing Accelerator Topic Descriptions
Below you will find a fuller description of each topic within the Prevention and Rehousing Accelerator along
with potential questions the GPL can help jurisdictions answer. This is meant to be a starting point to spark
your thinking about potential work that the GPL can lead within your jurisdiction. Note that every GPL project
begins with a diagnosis phase to better understand the jurisdiction’s unique context and specific opportunities,
and solutions are shaped in close collaboration with the jurisdiction.
Prevention:
Homelessness cannot be solved without a strategy for preventing individuals and families from becoming
homeless in the first place and cannot be solved by homeless response systems alone. The GPL can help
jurisdictions implement prevention efforts that are efficient (targeted to those most likely to become homeless),
effective (successfully prevent homelessness), and equitable (focused on fairness of outcomes). To that end,
the GPL can support jurisdictions in the following topic areas:
•

Topic #1: Reduce the likelihood of individuals exiting a system (e.g. criminal justice, child welfare)
into homelessness by bringing agencies together to develop shared goals, improve discharge and
aftercare processes, and align on prioritized access to housing resources.

People experiencing homelessness frequently touch other systems prior to becoming homeless, such as the
child welfare system2, the criminal justice system3, domestic violence shelters4, or ER rooms/hospitals5. This
presents an early opportunity to intervene and prevent homelessness, as well as an opportunity to support
other partner system goals (e.g. decreased risk of child removal for families who are stably housed6). However,
jurisdictions may struggle to act because they have limited data and unclear ownership of these cross-system
dynamics. The GPL can help jurisdictions tackle key questions such as:
• What systems do our homeless populations encounter prior to becoming homeless?
• How can we identify individuals in other systems that are at the highest risk of becoming homeless
(e.g. through screening)?
• What new discharge and referral processes/aftercare can we implement to reduce the likelihood of
individuals exiting a system into homelessness?
• Are there housing resources that should be earmarked for certain populations most at risk of
chronic homelessness, such as individuals cycling between jail, ER, and homelessness?
• How can we connect multi-system involved individuals and families (e.g. families at risk of child
removal due to homelessness) with housing resources that best fit them?
The GPL can help jurisdictions bring systems together to align on goals and jointly implement interventions,
including by creating or adapting screening tools to identify individuals at high risk of becoming homeless and
piloting new discharge, referral, and aftercare processes to connect people to best-fit housing resources. This
work could be positioned from a Mayor’s or Governor’s Office, jointly supported by two agencies (e.g. the
homeless & child welfare agencies) or positioned in one agency but with support from a partner agency.

•

Topic #2: Support people to retain their housing in communities with high rates of eviction/rentburden/homelessness entry by leveraging trusted local organizations and coordinating services to
improve connections to best-fit housing resources.

Due to the legacy of racist housing policies and systemic disinvestment, jurisdictions see certain zip codes,
neighborhoods, or micro-neighborhoods with high rates of rent-burdened families and evictions. Ultimately,
these areas may see a disproportionate number of residents become homeless. Individuals in these
communities often interact with a variety of trusted local organizations, including faith-based organizations and
libraries, that could be leveraged to disseminate information and resources related to tenants’ rights and
eviction prevention. Local eviction prevention services may also be siloed, duplicative, or not comprehensively
integrated into communities most in need. The GPL can help jurisdictions tackle key questions such as:
• Are there certain neighborhoods, zip codes, or micro-neighborhoods with disproportionate levels of
families being evicted (or at risk of eviction) and becoming homeless?
• How can we meet individuals where they are, screen them for eviction risk, and connect them to the
resources that best meet their needs?
• Are there gaps or duplications within the local eviction prevention service array? Do we need to
procure for new services?
• Are our eviction prevention/rental assistance service providers coordinating and collaborating to
maximize the reach and efficacy of services?
The GPL can support jurisdictions to identify high risk communities and then bring together stakeholders to
identify available supports, assess gaps, and improve coordination, dissemination of information, and referral
processes.
•

Topic #3: Mitigate the harm of reductions in pandemic-related federal rental assistance by
designing new, local programs or redesigning pre-existing programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted unprecedented new federal supports to prevent homelessness.
Unfortunately, by the end of 2022, many of these new supports will have expired,7 but people, particularly
people of color, continue to face challenges in maintaining stable, safe, and affordable housing.8 Many
jurisdictions are interested in unpacking what worked and what didn’t in their targeting and administration of
these large, federal rental assistance programs, particularly as they consider what smaller local investments
might look like to prevent a surge in housing insecurity and evictions. The GPL can help jurisdictions tackle key
questions such as:
• What can we learn from the pandemic-related program investments re: targeting, outreach, and
administration of rental assistance programs?
• How do we apply these learnings to smaller, more targeted local rental assistance programs?
• How can we monitor programs for equitable reach?
The GPL can help jurisdictions uncover learnings from federal pandemic-related eviction prevention
investments and then design new, smaller, more targeted local housing assistance programs (or improve the
targeting and coordination of preexisting rental assistance programs).
Rehousing:
Homelessness cannot be solved without a strategy for optimizing and increasing access to deeply affordable
housing. The national crisis of housing affordability has led to increasingly competitive markets with a limited
pool of available units9 that pits deeply low-income households against one another. Landlords have little
incentive to participate in complicated or burdensome housing programs when demand is high in the private
market, often shrinking the pool of housing stock further. The GPL can help jurisdictions maximize their
dedicated housing stock that currently exists through quick lease-ups, improve the experience for both
landlords and housing seekers alike, and address inequities in access to housing for discrete homeless

populations that face additional barriers. To these ends, the GPL plans to support jurisdictions in the following
topic areas:
•

Topic #4: Reduce the amount of time it takes for individuals to move into subsidized housing by
making the referral and eligibility verification process more effective, efficient, and client-centered.

Requirements for landlords and unhoused individuals entering subsidized housing can be cumbersome and
confusing, resulting in move-in delays that leave precious housing stock unoccupied for months. It can be
difficult for jurisdictions to estimate the timeframe to rehouse individuals, hindering their ability to use
performance metrics and track progress. Many jurisdictions also struggle to entice landlords to participate in
subsidized housing. These communities strive for a frictionless process that would help them recruit new and
retain existing landlords. The GPL can help jurisdictions tackle key questions such as:
• What are the current timeframes for key steps of the process to move into subsidized housing
(Public Housing Authorities, vouchers, or Permanent Supportive Housing)?
• Where are there inefficiencies and opportunities to streamline and standardize requirements?
• What are the key challenges faced by clients, housing navigators, and landlords in this process?
• How can we monitor the process in real-time?
The GPL can help jurisdictions measure the baseline process, set ideal timeframes for completion of key
move-in process steps, develop monitoring systems to spot delays in real time, create toolkits and templates
for scalable efficiencies, and co-design user-friendly training materials for clients, landlords, and/or housing
staff.
•

Topic #5: Address structural rehousing barriers for specific homeless populations.

For homeless individuals who are young adults, have a history of justice-involvement, or have physical
disabilities or medical needs, the challenge of securing housing is compounded. In most jurisdictions, landlords
can deny housing to individuals based on prior convictions and even low-threshold subsidized housing (Public
Housing Agencies, Permanent Supportive Housing) typically has some subjective screening process. Young
adults may face resistance based on their age and lack of housing history, or they may need alternate housing
arrangements such as room or home shares that aren’t currently supported by subsidies. Individuals with
medical needs that require support such as wheelchair access or home health care are limited to ADA
compliant buildings with elevators. The GPL can help jurisdictions tackle key questions such as:
• How can we crosswalk PSH eligibility requirements based on chronic homelessness with periods of
incarceration, hospitalization, or foster care?
• Where is information on justice-involvement currently being gathered in publicly supported housing,
what are the best practices in assessing risk, and how should it inform housing acceptance
decisions?
• How can we support young adults who may prefer or need different types of housing assistance,
such as room shares or rent contribution towards a household?
• How can we ensure that homeless individuals with disabilities or medical needs have priority
access to appropriate units?
The GPL can help jurisdictions pilot population-specific housing initiatives with an aim to address the specific
challenges young adults, individuals with a criminal justice history, and individuals with disabilities or medical
needs face in the private and subsidized housing markets.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is the Government Performance Lab?
The mission of the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab (GPL) is to speed up our nation’s
progress on difficult social problems by improving how state and local government human service agencies
function and how their dollars are spent. We hire and train full-time employees, pairing them with government
agencies to lead 12-36 month intensive reform projects. The GPL conducts research on how governments can
improve the results they achieve for their citizens. An important part of our research model involves providing
technical assistance to state and local governments. Through this hands-on involvement, we gain insights into
the barriers that governments face and the solutions that can overcome these barriers.
2. When is this application due?
Completed applications are due by 5 PM PST on Friday, November 18, 2022.
3. What is required to submit an application?

Dear Friends & Neighbors,
I have lost count of all the school building committee meetings I have attended over 8+ years. Bruce and I don't have
kids, but we are passionate about quality education to establish and guide the generations that come after us.
Wow! Wow! Wow! This smashing video is a “must watch” for everyone, of all ages, in our community! Our school will be
the 2nd Net Zero Energy LEED Platinum high school in the country. For a small city of 35,000+ people, we have thought
big and will now carry out our aspirations. I love living in a "can-do" community. and this comes on top of building two
new elementary schools and renovating a third.
Thank you to Council President Mark Sideris for his leadership as Chair of the School Building Committee and all the
members of the SBC, Jim Jordan and the Ai3 architectural team, Christy Murphy and Tim Bonfatti of the Compass Project
Management team, and all my fellow residents who attended numerous meetings and shared their thoughts and
suggestions. Here is the extraordinary result of all these folks' efforts.

Harvard Square Zoning - Banks and Financial Institutions

To Whom This May Concern,
Even the most fervent fans of money would object to the senseless and almost complete
takeover of Harvard Square retail spaces by banks and related financial institutions. For that
reason, I urge the City Council to adopt the Harvard Square Zoning Petition Modification
regarding Frontage of Financial Institutions.
With few exceptions, Harvard Square banks have hardly any walk-in customers. The spaces they
occupy are empty mausoleums that exist solely to promote a banking brand. At a time when
online banking technologies have taken over the industry, it is difficult for genuine local
business; our bookstores, restaurants and clothing shops to draw customers to our city squares.
The aforementioned Zoning Petition modification would limit the retail footprint of further bank
tenants. It will hopefully discourage their arrival entirely.
Thank you for your attention.

ABC statement regarding linkage fee amendment

Dear Cambridge City Councillors:
Thank you for your work to raise the Incentive Zoning linkage fee to $33/sqft. Cambridge's shortage of affordable
housing has left over 20,000 families struggling to get by. With residential developers being asked to contribute on the
order of $100/sqft to affordable housing through our inclusionary zoning policy, asking commercial developers to
contribute $33/sqft to partially mitigate the impact they have on our housing crisis is the least we can do.
We share the concerns raised by CDD and the Affordable Housing Trust regarding a proposed deduction for demolished
floor area, which could significantly undercut this progress. While it may sound reasonable in the abstract, it has not
been made clear what public policy goal is supposed to be served by this deduction, nor why such a goal would be more
important than funding desperately needed affordable housing, nor why such a goal cannot wait a year to be more fully
explored in the coming nexus study. As CDD noted, many questions about the intended scope of the deduction remain
unresolved. It has not been analyzed what the impact of such a deduction would be on funding for affordable housing,
nor whether such a deduction would inappropriately incentivize environmentally destructive demolitions in situations
where they are not warranted.
The A Better Cambridge board opposes the inclusion of such a demolition deduction in this iteration of the Incentive
Zoning policy, and hopes that you will move swiftly to ordain the full un-deducted $33/sqft fee so that fewer of
Cambridge's affordable housing needs can go unmet. We look forward to moving on to discussions of the coming nexus
study and a holistic look at how all fees on development impact our housing crisis. We also look forward to discussions
of other budgetary ways to fund the rest of our affordable housing needs.
Thank you, on behalf of the board,
Allan Sadun, co-chair
Becca Schofield, co-chair

Inman Square Project

Dear Ms. Kelleher,
Thank you for your communication on the upcoming work in Inman Square. It is helpful to know in
advance to avoid this area which I travel through routinely on my way to my East Cambridge
business. I am glad this project is finally coming to its conclusion although later than expected and at
far greater cost than estimated.
Now that the completed project is coming into focus, I am dismayed by the final design. Instead of
improving the acknowledged complicated traffic flow in Inman Square, it appears to have made it
much more complicated. From my own personal experience, it has not improved traffic flow on
Cambridge St. I was stuck in the intersection trying to turn onto Cambridge Street from Prospect and
encountered traffic completely backed up from Prospect Street to the light at Hampshire. This is
clearly defeating one of the Council's goals of reducing emissions as traffic congestion prolongs the
travel time through Inman Square. While I too support pollution control efforts, the City needs to
consider how to realistically make the situation better and not contribute to the problem in the short
term.
While it is the City Council's goal to reduce cars in the city, it is very naive of the council to think that
making it harder to drive in Cambridge will achieve this goal. Some persons have no option other than
to use a vehicle for work. Trucks still need to use the streets to deliver goods to local businesses.
Some street users are not even Cambridge residents but residents from Somerville and Arlington
passing through to get home. For me, I am moving inventory to my business which is not feasible
other than by car. Drivers will move from main streets to side streets to get to their destination and
they will not magically disappear. And unless you install gates at the city's boundaries, drivers will
need to travel through Cambridge to other locations.
The narrowness of the new traffic lane raises serious safety concerns for emergency vehicles
traveling on this section of Cambridge Street in particular ambulances trying to access the emergency
room at Cambridge Hospital. It remains to be seen if cycling safety is improved as the new
complicated intersections appear to me to make it more difficult to safely travel through Inman Square
and presents more opportunity for bike /vehicular accidents. I hope I am wrong when the completed
project is unveiled.
All these issues were raised by concerned citizens and business owners during the design phase of
the project and dismissed by the Traffic Department and the City Council. This project is testament to
how disconnected the city is from the realities of life in Cambridge and how our roadways operate.I
urge the city to listen seriously to concerns raised by the residents and businesses that routinely use
the streets and not assume you all know best.

LINKAGE FEE AMENDMENT

Please vote to increase the Linkage Fee for developers so that more dollars can be directed to developing
affordable housing.
BUT, PLEASE VOTE NO ON THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD EXCLUDE 'DEMOLISHED'
FLOOR AREA FROM THE SQUARE FOOTAGE ON WHICH THE LINKAGE FEE IS BASED. Every square
foot of new development in Cambridge -- residential or commercial -- effectively drives up housing costs for
people in Cambridge. Finding ways to reduce the linkage fee is simply wrong!

City Council: Projecting Sign Process!, Central Rock Gym, 20 Brattle St., App. 2 (2022 #
47), 10/17/22

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon and City Councillors:
I know that this is minor. But why can’t we at least get this process regularized so the Council and the public know what
you’re being asked to sign off on?
I object to the City’s completely “a-camel-is-a-horse-designed-by-a-committee” application and approval “process” for
signs that will project into a public way.
But, do you or we know how will this 24 sq. ft., double-sided, internally illuminated blade sign look? This 58-page
application for a sign to project into Brattle St., a public way, doesn’t even perform its primary purpose! Only 2 of the 56
application pages (pp. 46 & 56) give any even vague idea. To even decipher the tenant’s name, Central Rock Gym, I had
to enlarge the sign image to 150%. PLEASE review those pages of the application yourselves.
Yet, you can review detailed screw specifications at pp. 34-43.
Won’t someone in some department finally take primary responsibility for limiting and refining submission requirements for
projecting signage instead of allowing applicants to throw everything at the wall?
I respectfully suggest that ISD, CDD and whoever else develop a sign- approval requirements that clearly illustrate and
focus on the subject at hand.
Thank you, as always, for your time and attention.

Subject: Letter opposing eliminating the minimum parking requirements.
Dear Council Members,
I am writing in opposition to the Zoning Petition to amend section 6.36 of The City of Cambridge Zoning Articles which
removes minimum parking requirements for all zoning use classifications.
There hidden crisis happening in the City right now, a parking crisis. Every day public parking and on-street parking is
disappearing at an alarming rate. It’s best known to people who don’t have off street parking spaces and rely on onstreet permit parking.
Just in East Cambridge, we are losing a 900-space parking garage to the CambridgeSide redevelopment, losing about 400
spaces in the First St garage to the former Courthouse development, losing multiple surface parking lots to new
development, and have AHO projects that require no parking. This all adds more burden to an already over taxed piece
of critical City infrastructure, on-street permit parking.
More recently constructed buildings with reduced parking requirements, like Twenty|20 at 20 Child Street in East
Cambridge, have insufficient parking already and always has a wait list. The current wait list for a parking space is 4months long (Sep 2022), up from 3-months last year. Where do those people park? Public parking garages, if they can
find a space, or on-street permit parking.
Leaving developers, the choice to build little or no parking without oversite is irresponsible. It is the City’s duty is to
protect critical infrastructure, like on-street permit parking, not a developer. They are beholden to their investors, as
they should be, that’s why we have zoning to control unbridled capitalism. Excess parking spaces can be repurposed,
like leased to a car rental company, but creating new parking is problematic.
It’s a good idea to review parking minimums on a periodic basis, but it needs to be done precisely from detailed data
collection and analysis not a proverbial axe. My recommendation is that a through survey of buildings and their parking
be examined, before any sweeping zoning amendments are adopted.[Chuck Hinds] This letter is written on my own
behalf and not on the behalf of any other organization I am associated.
Very truly yours,

Re: Second Reading of Ordinance #2022-5 on 10/17/2022 City Council Meeting
Opposing Policy Order #4 and #9 2_7_22.pdf

Dear Mayor, City Manager, City Councillors and City Staff,
I want to thank Councillor Carlone for standing firm on his conviction and casting the lone dissenting vote on passing the
Ordinance #2022-5. And I agree 100% with Councillor Carlone that the "communication from Assistant City Manager for
Community Development Iram Farooq regarding the Accessory Parking Requirements Zoning Petition" is confusing and
backwards.
Her communication dated October 13, 2022 stated that
"At the September 21, 2022 hearing of the Ordinance Committee on the Accessory
Parking Requirements Zoning Petition (the “Petition”), CDD staff and City Councillors
discussed the potential that the Petition in its current form could cause unanticipated
conflicts or ambiguity with other sections of the Zoning Ordinance. We remarked that
we could try to identify some of these issues before the Council votes on ordination, but
that we would probably not be able to resolve every issue in that timeframe."
I wish I had seen the minutes of the Ordinance Committee hearing and I wish I had seen Assistant City Manager Iram
Farooq's communication before I sent in the email below. It is beyond belief that the Ordinance Committee voted 8 to 1
in favor of the Accessory Parking Requirements Zoning Petition in spite of the Planning Board recommending against it
unanimously (with the exception of one absent member) and discussing with CDD staff that the Petition in its current
form could cause "unanticipated conflicts or ambiguity with other sections of the Zoning Ordinance."
Why couldn't the Ordinance Committee delay their vote until the CDD could resolve the " unanticipated conflicts or
ambiguity with other sections of the Zoning Ordinance"?
Why couldn't the City Council delay the Council debate on the “Petition” until the City Manager could transmit a
"communication regarding the Accessory Parking Requirements Zoning Petition"
(City Manager Agenda Item 12; CMA 2022 #202). The agenda item description doesn't include the usual "relative to
Policy Order" O-n dated Month Day, 20nn. Was there even a Policy Order or equivalent Ordinance Committee order?
But most importantly, why didn't the CDD Staff review the Zoning Ordinance for "unanticipated conflicts or ambiguity
with other sections of the Zoning Ordinance" when the Zoning
Petition by the City Council to amend section 6.36 was first introduced as a Policy Order O-2 on 2/7/2022"? At the
same, City Council meeting Policy Order O-9 ordered "That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct staff
from the Community Development and Law Departments to examine the Zoning Ordinance and provide amendment
language for commercial parking maximums. And it is only now after the Petition had passed the first reading that we
see the full text of CDD's recommended parking maximum and with only Councillor Carlone questioning the "parking
maximum" requirement?
I am attaching the comment I submitted for the 2/7/2022 voicing against these two Policy Orders.

Dear Mayor, City Manager, City Councillors and City Clerk,

I urge you not to pass Ordinance #2022-5. Rather return it to the Ordinance Committee and the Planning Board and
direct them to rework it with the Community Development Department with robust community involvement to
formulate an amendment that they can all agree on and that fits into the long-term vision for the City.

The Ordinance Committee Report #5 to the City Council on October 3, 2022, showed that they voted 8 to 1 in favor of
motion to amend Zoning Ordinance 6.31 Required Amount of Parking to add “Notwithstanding any other provision in
the zoning, the minimum accessory parking required for all uses shall be zero (0) “

On September 21, 2022, City Manager Huang transmitted “a Planning Board report, with a negative recommendation
on the Accessory Parking Requirements Zoning Petition.” In that report, “The Planning Board voted with 7 members in
favor transmitting the above (negative) recommendation. One member was absent.”

When a zoning amendment proposal that affects everyone has such diametrically opposing decisions between the
volunteer Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee of elected City Council, there is definitely something wrong
and the proposed amendment should be reworked to reach a more balanced consensus decision.

This proposed amendment is the latest example of the City of Cambridge succumbing to the special interest agenda
and governing by “wish for the best; plan for the best” rather than “hope for the best; plan for the worst.” Wishing for
the best that benevolent developers will sacrifice their profits and provide the necessary accessory parking as not to
disrupt the neighborhood and planning for the best by taking a chain saw rather than scalpel to address the problem of
“Parking minimums can force homeowners and residential & commercial (sic) developers to accommodate space for
more parking than they deem necessary, leading to higher project costs and a decrease in the number of units or
amount of open space.”

The City is a shining star on many fronts of city governance but at the same time this proposed amendment exposes
many examples of all the reforms needed in the City governance. To cite just 3 such needed reforms, please consider

1. No database to track lessons learned from previous changes/initiatives such as Cambridge's ambitious goal of
reducing the ratio of cars owned by Cantabrigians by 2020. The Boston Globe reported in 2/29/2019 that the goal “set
in 2014, was to lower ownership to about 0.8 cars per household, but with about a year left on the clock, Cambridge is
less than halfway there.” According to public records request response (please see the attached), there is no final
report that shows what measures the City took to achieve that goal; what was the result of that initiative; and
postmortem analysis of why it failed so miserably. And there is no database that tracks special permit requests asking
for relief from minimum accessory parking requirements and the status of these requests per Zoning Project Planner
Swaathi Joseph (see attached).
2. Inadequate data collection of pre-existing conditions and impact studies as was with the Cycle Safety Ordinance
implementation. Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department (TP&T) assumed there will be no economic impact or
traffic impact with quick build separated bike lanes to the local small businesses and to automobile users, so it didn’t
require Engineering Support contractors to conduct economic impact study or traffic survey. Where is data analysis
that shows removing accessory parking requirements will lead to lower car ownership without negative impact to all
stakeholders?
3. Lack of community input before changes are introduced. TP&T awarded engineering support contracts for the
quick build separated bike lanes and then held community meetings after the designs are well underway by the
contractors without revealing the designs are done by outside “house doctors.” Were any community meetings held or
surveys conducted before the zoning amendment to remove minimum accessory parking requirements was
proposed? Public comments during City Council meetings, City Council Committee meetings, and Planning Board
hearings should not be considered as substitutes for community meetings.

I voiced my opposition to Policy Orders #4 and #9 of Feb. 7, 2022, but it seems my concerns were not heard. From
Councillor Nolan's vote to amend Zoning Ordinance 6.31, her concerns must have been addressed satisfactorily but I
wish I knew how. I am attaching copies of the email exchanges.

Dear Mayor, City Councillors and City Clerk,
Policy Orders #4 and #9 yet again order the Zoning Ordinance to be amended without robust discussions with all the stakeholders involved.
I strenuously object to Policy Order #9 that "the City Manager ... requested to direct staff from the Community
Development and Law Departments to examine the Zoning Ordinance and provide amendment language ... to remove all other references to parking minimums".
If such a Zoning Ordinance amendment were to be passed, it would allow the developers to build projects that meet the Zoning Ordinance requirements as of right
without any parking regardless of its impact on the community. Such a drastic change in the Zoning Ordinance must first carefully consider all the ramifications and
impacts. This Policy Order doesn't even present reasons or rationale in the form of "whereas."
Policy Order # 4 orders that "section 6.36 ... be amended by substitution with the language attached. Has the substitution language even been discussed with the
community and the businesses?
Any zoning ordinance changes related to parking should be first discussed in public forums with all the stakeholders.
Please reject these Policy Orders,
Respectfully your,

Dear Young Kim,

Thank you for writing regarding POR 2022 #24. Councillor Azeem introduced this policy order requesting that the City Manager and staff examine the Zoning
Ordinance and provide amendment language for consideration by the City Council to remove all references to parking minimums. In addition, the policy order

Personally, I am supportive of the goal and concerned about how to implement in a way that is inclusive and thoughtful. I will be asking about how to ensure that
working towards eliminating parking minimums is done with an analysis of current parking and with sufficient community outreach. Eliminating parking minimums
might allow for more housing, improve walkability of our neighborhoods, and help with emissions reductions. Depending on how such a policy is implemented
parking can and will still be built.

The idea of setting parking maximums (the companion request) is also worth discussing, and should happen with a full understanding of potential
consequences. There will be tradeoffs which should be laid out and understood. I believe that this policy order has the potential if done well to move us in the right
direction for Cambridge’s housing affordability and climate goals and has the potential if done poorly to divide us.

Sincerely,
Patty

requests language regarding parking maximums. This conversation will be challenging - we live in a city where most households own cars and many rely on cars
and in a world where cars are a huge part of the problem of climate change and livability. It’s a good time to have the discussion in a comprehensive manner.

Hello Young,
Thank you so much for reaching out about my policy order to remove parking minimums in the City.
The policy will not remove a single spot of parking in Cambridge. It will change the law such that homeowners can choose to not
have a parking lot - only if they don't want it.
The goal is to allow the 1/3rd of Cambridge households that do not own a car to be able to use that space on their property that they
are currently required to have, but for something else, such as a garden.
I hope this alleviates some concerns.

Thank you Councillor Azeem for responding to my letter on your Policy Order.
I am afraid your explanation does not alleviate my concerns.
Yes, I completely understand and agree that the policy will not remove a single spot of parking in Cambridge. But I am afraid you completely missed my point.
My concern is the unintended consequence of the policy. Let's say the policy order becomes a reality and the Zoning Ordinance is amended as you envisioned. I
think only in Utopia will a homeowner turn unneeded driveway into green space. More likely, all the developers will take advantage of the no minimum parking
ordinance to pack in as dense development as possible. As I stated in my letter, if a developer wants to build a building that meets all the Zoning requirements with
no parking, then he can build it as of right no matter what negative impact that might have to the community.
Call me a pessimist but I have seen too many projects where a developer will try to pack as dense project as possible to maximize his profit. Yes, I fully agree the
developer has the right to make a profit. But what I am pushing for is a reasonable development preserving the character of Cambridge I love and want to leave as
my legacy to my children. I do not want to hand down a concrete jungle devoid of green spaces and intangible treasures of the Cambridge.
Allow me to tell you a story from my college days in NYC during the student uprising days of late 60s. A group of anarchists marched into the campus and
demanded to tear down US form of government because it doesn't work. So, I asked them what the alternative was, and they replied that doesn't matter; that we
will build something much better afterwards. We can't gut entire zoning requirement without first carefully weighing all the potential consequences. And the Zoning
Ordinance has been amended over many years and provisions for a requirement are all over the place and all intertwined with other provisions.

Homelessness Seats On Boards(BOD"s/ BOC's!

Dear City Clerk: An Item for the Upcoming City Council Agenda.
Peace Be Unto You,
Dear Cambridge,MA,
It is time for all community boards of directors, board of commissions, and nonprofits that are receiving federal, state,
and local government funding in Cambridge,MA to allow qualified members from the local homeless sector and mosaic,
to share a seat at the table. Yes, it time to make way for members of the homelessness segment of the community to
have a seat on your board of directors, commissioners,etc., because full participation of the homeless in community
organization, is mandated now into government law, if the entities receives any type of government funding.
Specifically, I call for the Cambridge Community Preservation Committee, The Cambridge Housing Authority, and the
Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Funds to start considering preparing seats on their boards for local homeless
citizens. Federal mandates now dictate that this action be carried out locally. Our local city,state, and federal legislative
policy makers must join in the efforts to have homeless members of the community, elevated to positions on
government funded board operations. Cambridge is lagging behind other proactive municipalities in including the
homeless sector and mosaic to government mandated seats in organization, public and private, that receive any type of
government funding to support their community operations.
Once again, the Cambridge Community Preservation Committee (CCPC), the Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA), and
the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust (CAHT) must help out in the task to open up seats on their boards for homeless
members. Insensitivity and hardheartedness, towards the homeless should have no place in 21st Century Cambridge,MA
Yours In Peace

Communicating Information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Tuesday, October 18th, 2022, the School Committee held a regular meeting. The data team at
CPS provided a presentation about the MCAS scores, comparing the 2019 and 2022 Math, ELA
and Science Technology and Engineering (STE) percentage of students exceeding or meeting
expectations. Due to a significant increase in absenteeism, students' access to instruction was
severely disrupted. Overall, MCAS scores were lower in 2022 in comparison to 2019 across
most grade levels. CPS has widening performance differences across demographic groups that
are greater than the state in some areas.
Although MCAS scores were lower in 2022 in comparison to 2019, CPS is above the state in
every grade and subject, except 6th grade math. CPS’s declines from 2019 were less significant
than the state’s declines across every subject and grade. Several initiatives are being designed to
address MCAS performance.
The ELA Department is focusing on adopting a high-quality literacy screening and diagnostic
tools to provide targeted instruction and intervention to prevent and correct reading difficulties
early on. The ELA Department is also expanding the Literacy Leadership Team to include JK-12
participants to build shared knowledge and align implementation of the Instructional Focus. CPS
will begin an elementary math pilot to align instructional routine and smooth transitions between
grades. CPS will offer curriculum training for new teachers to support the implementation of a
common curriculum long term. CPS will use iReady to individualize instruction to support
students with previous foundational skills.

The School Committee also passed a motion to begin an inclusive process for renaming Vassal
Lane due to John Vassal Jr.’s history of enslaving multiple people on his Cambridge property
and his family enslaving hundreds of individuals in the Jamaican sugar industry.
Following Motion #22-202, CPS will now provide transportation to students attending DHSP
after school programs at a location other than their home school, students living in public
housing, and students attending who did not receive a DHSP spot and who enrolled in another
community after school program. Transportation will begin on or before Monday, October 24.
Families have been encouraged to contact the Superintendent Office if they do not receive
notification from DHSP or their schools by Friday, October 21.
My office organized a fun pumpkin painting and story time event at the Cambridge Public
Library. It was a wonderful time to connect with parents and our young constituents and paint
pumpkins.
We hope to see many more residents at our Diwali event at the Cambridge Public Library on
Saturday, October 22nd at 12:00pm and at our trick or treat event on City Hall Lawn on October
31st at 4:00pm.
There will be a round table discussion about the RSTA program on Tuesday, October 25th at
6:00pm. There is a School Committee retreat on Thursday, October 27th at 6:00pm. The next
regular School Committee meeting is on Tuesday, November 1st, 2022, at 6:00pm. Please do not
hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
