CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL

(MEETING PROTOCOLS/MEMBERSHIP ROLL CALL)

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, ALL OF TONIGHT'S VOTES WILL BE BY ROLL
CALL. WE'LL OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. I ASK YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND
ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND THE ITEM ON THE AGENDA THAT YOU ARE
SPEAKING ON. PLEASE DIRECT ALL COMMENTS TO THE CHAIR. THE FIRST
PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS JACOB.

Public Comment

>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.

May 24, 2021

>> OKAY. I'M JACOB, I LIVE AT TEN COOPER WAY STREET AND I URGE THE
CITY COUNCIL AND THE MANAGER OF CAMBRIDGE TO SUPPORT POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 232. THE CITY WILL INCLUDE THE INPUT OF THE
COMMUNITY THAT USES CARL BARRON PLAZA DAILY AND THE PROPOSED
REDESIGN. THE REDESIGN AS OF NOW LIMITS THE NUMBER OF BENCHES AND
SEATS IN THE AREA AND MAKES MANY OF THE SEATS AND TABLE REMOVABLE
AS A WAY TO CONTROL PEOPLE WHO MAY UTILIZE THE AREA AND WHAT
TIMES THEY MAY DO SO. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOSTILE ARCHITECTURE.
AND IT ITSELF IS ONE OF EXAMPLE AMONG MANY OF CRIMINALIZING
UNHOUSED PEOPLE FOR TRYING TO MEET THEIR MOST BASIC NEEDS.
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY AND
THEY HAVE EQUAL ACCESS AND INPUT TO THE DESIGN OF PUBLIC SPACES
AND RESOURCES. THEY SHOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN CONSULTED, BUT THUS
FAR HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF PLANNING. AND IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR,
CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED POLICY ORDER NUMBER
23, ELIMINATING HOSTILE ARCHITECTURE, WHICH APPLIES DIRECTLY HERE.
COMMUNICATION NUMBER TEN, PETITION SIGNED BY ALMOST 40 MEMBERS
OF THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY WAS SENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND THEY
CALL FOR A SERIES OF DEMANDS, INCLUDING INSTALLATION OF DRINKING
FOUNTAINS, COMMUNITY MICROWAVE AND REFRIGERATOR AND SETTING UP
OF NARCAN DISTRIBUTION BOXES TO MAKE THE AREA SAFE. I BELIEVE THIS
INPUT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY FURTHER REDESIGNS AND EDITS TO THE
REDESIGN OF THE CARL BARRON PLAZA. CAMBRIDGE HAS FAILED TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF THE UNHOUSED POPULATION IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. AND
THIS IS SIMPLY ONE IN A LONG LINE OF THE FAILURES. AND I BELIEVE IT IS
IMPERATIVE THE PUBLIC HEARING IS HELD TO INCLUDE THE INPUT OF THE
COMMUNITY AND ENSURE THAT UNHOUSED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
ARE ELEVATED TO THE POSITION THEY DESERVE TO HAVE, WHICH IS
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LORRAINE THOMAS AND THEN
HUMA GUPTA.
>> LORRAINE IS NOT ON. HUMA, GO AHEAD.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> I'M HUMA, I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, WHO LIVED HERE FOR OVER TEN
YEARS AT 950 MASS AVENUE. I URGE YOU AND THE CITY MANAGER TO
SUPPORT PO 2021, NUMBER 232. INCLUDE THE INPUT OF THE COMMUNITY
THAT USES CARL BARRON PLAZA ON A DAILY BASIS. AS JACOB ARGUED, THE
PROPOSED REDESIGN OF THE PLAZA, I THINK, SHOULD ABSOLUTELY INCLUDE
THE VOICES OF THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ESPECIALLY
HIGHLIGHTING AND CENTERING THE DEMANDS THAT WERE ARTICULATED IN
THE PETITION SIGNED BY NEARLY 40 UNHOUSED COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
I THINK, I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT EVERYTHING JACOB SAID, SOMETHING
THAT IS CRITICAL IS THAT AS A HOUSED MEMBER OF THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY, THERE ARE MANY, MANY PUBLIC SPACES WHERE I FEEL

PAGE 2

May 24, 2021

WELCOME, WHERE I FEEL THAT I CAN BE IN COMMUNITY WITH MY FRIENDS,
MY COLLEAGUES, I CAN FEEL SAFE, YOU I THINK FOR UNHOUSE THE
COMMUNITY MEMBERS, CARL BARON PLAZA IS A SPACE WHERE THEY CAN
FEEL SAFE, CONNECT, AND BE SEEN AND CONNECT WITH OTHER MEMBERS
OF THE COMMUNITY. AND I THINK. IT IS REALLY DISHEARTENING TO SEE THE
REDESIGN OF THE PLAZA NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE DEVASTATING
IMPACT THAT A REDESIGN OF THIS PLACE, WHICH REDUCES THE NUMBER OF
SEATS FOR INSTANCE OR REDUCES THE ACCESS THAT THE UNHOUSED
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WOULD HAVE TO THE PLACE. WHAT IT WOULD DO
TO THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE IN CAMBRIDGE SYSTEMATICALLY
DEHUMANIZING, DISPLACING, AND DISPOSSESSING COMMUNITY MEMBERS,
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE UNHOUSED. AND I THINK THIS IS JUST ONE IN A
WHOLE RANGE OF EFFORTS TO DO THAT TO INVISIBLE THEM.
I REALLY URGE YOU THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE CITY MANAGER TO TAKE THE
INPUT OF UNHOUSED COMMUNITY MEMBERS VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. AND
REALLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, I THINK, WHAT ARE EXTREMELY
REASONABLE DEMANDS. INSTALLATION OF DRINKING FOUNTAINS AND
WATER BOTTLE REFILL STATIONS THAT PROVIDE FREE AND CLEAN DRINKING
WATER FOR THOSE WHO OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE A RELIABLE WATER
SOURCE. THE ADDITION OF A SIGNAL STRUCTURE TO HOUSE A MICROWAVE
AND REFRIGERATOR. ALLOW THOSE WHO ARE UNHOUSED ACCESS TO A
WARM MEAL. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NARCAN DISTRIBUTION BOXES
AND SHARPS CONTAINERS THAT MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO MAY
WITNESS AN OVERDOSE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS THEMSELVES.
THEY CAN SAVE A LIFE IN AN EMERGENCY. I HOPE YOU TAKE MY COMMENTS
AND MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS UNDER CONSIDERATION. AND PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE CENTER THE VOICES OF THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY
MEMBERS IN THE REDESIGN OF CAROL BARRON PLAZA. THANK YOU FOR THE
TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO LORRAINE THOMAS WHO IS BACK AND
FOLLOWED BY LAURA.
>> HI, APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGEPORT. I WILL SPEAK
IN OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT REDESIGN OF THE CARL BARON PLAZA. I
WILL NOTE, RIGHT NOW THE PLAZA REPRESENTS A SUCCESS IN OUR
COMMUNITY. IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE PEOPLE SPEND THEIR TIME, THE CARL
BARON PLAZA IS IN USE AND THAT'S A SHAME WE'RE TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING TO UNDERMINE THAT.
PART OF THE IDEA OF BEING A SQUARE IS A PLACE WHERE COMMUNITIES
GATHER AND PEOPLE ARE PRESENT. AND FOLKS WHO ARE UNHOUSED ARE
PART OF THE COMMUNITY. AND SO, I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF LITTLE
PARKS THAT TOTALLY FAIL AND NOBODY GOES TO. AND TO DIMINISH THAT
BY MAKING THIS PLAZA LESS ACCESSIBLE, LESS WELCOMING AND LESS
ENCOURAGING IS DISAPPOINTING. I PRESUME THAT THE REASON FOR THAT
INVOLVES PEOPLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HOMELESSNESS. AND I
THINK THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR FOLKS
WHO ARE HOMELESS, BUT TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO


PAGE 3

May 24, 2021

BE A COMMUNITY AND GATHER. THAT IS A DESIRABLE AND VALUABLE PART
OF OUR CITY.
AND IF THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADOPT, WE SHOULD
LOOK AT HOW HOW TO HANDLE, WE SHOULD LOOK AT SATISFYING THE
NEEDS OF THE RELEVANT COMMUNITY AND ASKING FOR SUPPORT AND
INPUT, RATHER THAN JUST SAYING THIS IS NOT A PLACE WE WANT YOU TO
BE. THAT'S REALLY I HAVE TO SAY. I WANT TO SAY THAT ALL OF MY OPINIONS
ARE OBVIOUSLY MINE, WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT, ARE THE OPINIONS OF
THE PEOPLE AFFECTED AND THAT'S WHO WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE IN THE
REDESIGN. ANYTHING THAT MAKES THE ARCHITECTURE MORE HOSTILE AND
LESS ACCESSIBLE IS A STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THANKS FOR YOUR
TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LAURA, FOLLOWED BY DEBBIE. NO PAULA JUST WANTS
TO WATCH VIA ZOOM. LAURA?
>> OKAY. I'M LAURA. MY OPINION ABOUT THIS IS THAT I DO THINK THAT
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A THRIVING COMMUNITY THERE AT THE CARL
BARRON PLAZA. I DON'T KNOW IN DETAIL WHAT THE CHANGES THAT WERE
PROPOSED ARE; HOWEVER, I FEEL THAT THE PEOPLE THAT USE THAT SPACE
SHOULD BE CONSULTED. THERE SHOULD BE AN EFFORT AT SOME HEARING
THAT WOULD BE PUBLICIZED TO THE PEOPLE THAT HANG OUT THERE THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A HEARING. THEY ARE ALL WELCOME TO COME AND
GIVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS
INCLUDED.
THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE THERE THAT HAVE DIFFERENT OPINION FROM
THAT IN THE PRESENT PETITION AND MAYBE HAVE ADDITIONAL INPUT. I WAS
THINKING IT WOULD BE NICE, THIS MAY NOT BE PART OF THE PROPOSAL, BUT
TO HAVE A PERSON REPRESENTING THE CITY THAT COULD KIND OF HANG
AROUND THERE AND HELP PEOPLE IF THEY NEED HELP, LIKE WHATEVER. I
THINK SOME OF THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW LIKE HOW THEY WOULD GO TO
CITY HALL. HOW THEY WOULD TESTIFY. THAT KIND OF DETAILS. I THINK
PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INTERNET, THEY DON'T HAVE EASY ACCESS
TO WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS HARDER FOR THEM TO FIGURE OUT THE
OVERALL SCENE. AN ACTUAL PERSON THERE HANGING AROUND MIGHT BE
HELPFUL.
I ALSO AM WONDERING ABOUT PUTTING SOME KIND OF A LITTLE AREA, I
NOTICE A LOT OF PEOPLE SIT IN THE BUS STOPS AND PART OF THE REASON IS
THERE IS A ROOF THERE. IT IS NICE AND COZY AND ON A RAINY DAY, YOU CAN
BE PROTECTED. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE CONSIDER TO BE PART OF
THE REDESIGN. I'M VERY IN FAVOR OF REFIXING THE BRICKS. I DO NOT
MYSELF USE THAT AREA TO SIT ON THE SEATS, BUT I DO WALK THROUGH
THERE QUITE OFTEN AND IT IS A BIG IRREGULAR FOOTING. THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DEBBIE BONILLA? FOLLOWED BY EMILY.
>> HI, I'M SPEAKING ON AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 231. I'M DEBBIE, I LIVE AT 15
CARLISLE STREET. I'M ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF EQUITY ROADMAP,

FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. ON BEHALF OF THE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE TEAM, I THANK
THE CITY COUNCIL FOR THE UNANIMOUS VOTE SPECIAL THANK YOU TO VICE
MAYOR MALLON AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN
BRINGING OUR PROPOSAL FORWARD AS WELL AS MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR COSPONSORING THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU TO
CITY MANAGE ER FOR SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM WITH THIS FREE CASH
APPROPRIATION. AND FOR HIS SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE. THANK YOU ELLEN
SEMONOFF FOR HER SUPPORT AND WORKING WITH US THROUGHOUT THE
PROCESS.
I WANT TO THANK MATT NELSON AND ADAM AS WELL. THEY HAVE BEEN
ACCOMMODATING AND PATIENT WITH US. AND THANK YOU TO THE
VOLUNTEERS FOR THE CONSISTENT SUPPORT AND TO SCHOLARS THAT
ATTEND THE PROGRAMMING. THANK YOU TO THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE
SEEN THE IMPACT OF FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE ON THEIR CHILD'S WELL BEING AND
ADVOCATED FOR US. IT BEGAN AS A PILOT PROGRAM TWO MONTHS
PANDEMIC CLOSED SCHOOLS. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE HAS EXPANDED ITS REACH
TO ALL OF THE CPS UPPER SCHOOL SCHOLARS AND NOW SERVES ALL MIDDLE
SCHOOL AGE YOUTH IN CAMBRIDGE. MANY KIDS FELT DISCONNECTED
THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL CLOSURE, FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE FUNCTION AS A
MEANS TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS
TO TRUSTED ADULTS. FUN, THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITIES, MENTORSHIP AND HOT
MEAL. THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN US AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND
SUPPORTING US TO ENSURE THIS IS A SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO
KIDS WHO NEED IT MOST. WE APPRECIATE YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO EMILY SILAS.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M EMILY. RESIDENT OF 126 HANCOCK STREET AND I
WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK REGARDING AGENDA ITEM 231. I WANT TO SPEAK IN
SUPPORT OF THE APPROPRIATION FOR THE EQUITY ROADMAP FRIDAY NIGHT
HYPE PROGRAM BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN WHAT A POSITIVE IMPACT IT HAS ON
MY SON WHO IS IN NINTH GRADE AND SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS.
IT IS A WONDERFUL MODEL THAT REALLY EXCELS THE CONNECTING YOUNG
PEOPLE TO ADULTS AND CONNECTING YOUNG PEOPLE TO OTHER YOUNG
PEOPLE IN A POSITIVE SUPPORTIVE SETTING.
WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THAT THE ADULTS BUILD THE CONNECTIONS WITH THE
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND OFFER SUPPORT
AND SERVICES IN A LOW KEY KIND OF WAY. AND OF COURSE, WE ARE SEEING
HOW MUCH YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO REINTEGRATE INTO THE
SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK THAT FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE CAN PLAY A
TREMENDOUS ROLE IN THE CITY DOING WHAT THEY SAID THROUGHOUT THE
PANDEMIC, PROVIDING THE KIND OF CONNECTIONS. WE KNOW THAT SO
MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE STRUGGLE WITH CHILDREN IN
SCHOOLS IN VARIOUS TOWNS AND CITIES IS THAT THEY LACK CONNECTION.
AND THEY NEED THE SUPPORT AND CONNECTION THEY GET FROM THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS. AND ALL OF THIS CAN SERVE TO PREVENT CONFLICT AND
OTHER ISSUES GOING FORWARD. I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE PROGRAM AND I'D


PAGE 5

May 24, 2021

LOVE TO SEE IT EXPAND FURTHER. MY SON IS GOING TO BE SERVING AS A
JUNIOR MENTOR, NOW HE IS DONE WITH MIDDLE SCHOOL, WHICH IS VERY
EXCITING. THANK YOU TO THE CITY COUNCIL, TO THE CITY MANAGER AND
FOR EVERYONE SUPPORTING THIS APPROPRIATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: UP NEXT, WE HAVE OBI CARRION.
>> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU EVERYONE. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT
OTHERS JUST SHARED. I'M IN TOTAL SUPPORT TO COMPLETE THE FRIDAY
NIGHT HYPE FOR OUR YOUTH OF CAMBRIDGE. IT'S EQUITABLE. IT IS A
COMMUNITY SPACE FOR TEENS AND PRE TEENS. A SAFE SPACE THAT IS
PROVIDED FOR OUR KIDS. OUR KIDS WANT TO BE THERE. MENTORS WANT
TO BE THERE AND I'M A MENTOR AND HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING A
MENTOR AT FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT FRIDAY
NIGHT HYPE. A MET A LOT OF THE CHILDREN IN THE CITY, EVEN MORE
CHILDREN. I'M A LIAISON FOR ONE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND I BRING
MY KIDS, MY CHILDREN, THE KIDS FROM MY PUBLIC SCHOOL GO. THEY LOOK
FORWARD TO FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. AND IT IS A SAFE SPACE. KEEPS OUR KIDS
OFF THE STREET. YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, WE HAD
SOMETHING CALLED NIGHT STOP, IT WAS VERY SIMILAR, VERY COMMUNITY,
GOT KIDS TOGETHER. WE LEARNED MANY THINGS AT NIGHT STOP. AND WE
HAD RESOURCE OFFICERS AT NIGHT STOP. AND ONCE YOU GOT TO A
CERTAIN AGE, YOU WERE ABLE TO WORK AT NIGHT STOP. I DEFINITELY IN
SUPPORT OF HOPEFULLY FUNDING FOR THE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. I THANK
YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, IT IS TIMMY SULLIVAN.
>> HI, EVERYBODY. I'M TIMMY SULLIVAN. SPECIAL THANK YOU TO
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI FOR
SPONSORING THE POLICY ORDER. FOR YOU TO SUPPORT THE DEBT FREE
FUTURE ACT. THE COUNCIL VOTED TO ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO
CANCEL STUDENT LOAN DEBT TO PROMOTE EQUITY IN EDUCATION
ATAINMENT, STIMULATE THE ECONOMY, AND THE IMPACT OF DEBT. THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CANCEL STUDENT DEBT, IT
IS OUR STATE LEGISLATORS, WHICH IS THE MANUFACTURE OF THE STUDENT
DEBTS AND THEREFORE THEY HOLD THE POWER TO PREVENT CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS AND PROSPECTIVE COLLEGE STUDENTS THIS IS A DIRECT
PRODUCT OF THE DISINVESTMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS FROM PUBLIC
EDUCATION OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. THE SHARE OF FUNDING HAS
DECLINED SO DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THAT OUR
PUBLIC COLLEGE SYSTEM FOR ARE NOT MAJORITY PUBLICLY FINANCED.
FINANCED BY DEBT NOW. MASSACHUSETTS, WHICH USED TO BOAST THE
SECOND LOWEST STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN THE COUNTRY, NOW HAS THE
TENTH HIGHEST NATIONAL STUDENT AVERAGE AND THE FASTEST GROWING
DEBT TOTAL IN THE COUNTRY, WITH PUBLIC COLLEGE STUDENTS
DISPROPORTIONATELY GRADUATING WITH DEBT IN OUR COMMONWEALTH
COMPARED TO PRIVATE COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE DEBT FREE FUTURE ACT,
LEGISLATION YOU ARE CONSIDERING TO SUPPORT TONIGHT, WOULD
REVERSE THIS TREND AND GUARANTEE A DEBT FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION AS A


PAGE 6

May 24, 2021

RIGHT TO RESIDENTS. IT IS PART TWO OF THE RESOLUTION PASSED BY THIS
COUNCIL IN MARCH. I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS IMPORTANT STEP, THE
RIGHT TO LEARN AND THE RIGHT TO BE CURIOUS TO ALL PEOPLE,
REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE EMMET SHEEHAN.
>> PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. LAURENT, YOU HAVE
THE FLOOR. GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I'M LAURENT, EIGHTH GRADER, I LIVE ON HARVARD STREET AND SPEAK
ON AGENDA ITEM 231. I GO TO FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE BECAUSE I REALLY WANT
TO SUPPORT MY SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING IT DOES. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE IS
IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE YOU GET TO MEET NEW PEOPLE, WHO MOST
LIKELY ALL THE TIMES YOU CAN GO YOU CAN HANG OUT WITH YOUR
FRIENDS.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CITY COUNCIL FOR SUPPORTING THE PROGRAM.
AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. IS EMMET BACK?
>> IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVE TO THE NEXT PERSON. MY SCREEN IS ACTING
UP.
>> PETER VALENTINE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PETER, JUST PRESS THE BUTTON.
>> OKAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: KEEP YOUR MASK UP, PLEASE. THANKS.
>> PETER VALENTINE, 37 BROOKLINE STREET. LONG TIME RESIDENT. IT IS A
PLEASURE TO BE HERE IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECTS THE RIGHT OF
THE PEOPLE TO PURSUE THEIR HIGHEST IDEALS. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
THAT MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL ARE NOT HERE AND IN MY OPINION,
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESENT HERE.
ON THE MATTER OF WHY I'VE COME, WE DON'T JUST LIVE IN A CITY AND IN A
COUNTRY AND IN A PLANET, WE LIVE IN THE COSMOS. AND THEREFORE A
NEW DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE CREATED, WHICH REPRESENT S AND STUDIES
OUR RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COSMOS. THE FACT IS,
THERE ARE BILLIONS OF CIVILIZATIONS IN THE COSMOS AND SOME LIKE US
AND SOME DON'T AND SOME WOULD LIKE TO TAKE OUR PLANET AWAY. A
NEW DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE CREATED, WHICH REPRESENTS THE
DEPARTMENT OF COSMIC AWARENESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE RICHARD HARDING?
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M HERE TO GIVE A PLUG FOR FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. THE
CREW DO A GREAT JOB AND I CAME TO THANK YOU ALL IN THIS ORDER NO
PARTICULAR ORDER FOR THE ENORMOUS SHOW OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT
ON BEHALF OF THE MOSES FAMILY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. I WANT TO GO


PAGE 7

May 24, 2021

ON RECORD REPRESENT, THE MOSES FAMILY (LISTING NAMES). THANK YOU
ALL FOR HELPING TO SEND A CIVIL RIGHTS ICON OFF THE WAY, NEVER SEEN IN
THE CITY. AS I SAID, BOB MOSES WOULD BE ON THE MOUNT RUSHMORE OF
CIVIL RIGHTS IF THERE WERE SUCH A THING. I THANK THE CITY STAFF,
COUNCILLORS, THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING A RESOLUTION. ALL THE FOLKS
AT TRAFFIC AND PARKING, MIT, CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, AND
A HOST OF OTHERS, WHO REALLY MADE THIS DAY, WHICH WAS AN EVENT,
REALLY HAPPENED. IT WAS A GREAT DISPLAY OF COMMUNITY AND ONE THAT
WOULD MAKE BOB REALLY, REALLY PROUD. I WANT TO THANK THE CENTRAL
SQUARE BID AND MIKE, HE WAS GREAT, HIM AND OTHERS WHO HELPED TO
ORGANIZE THE WHOLE THING WITH THE FAMILY.
I WANT TO GO ON RECORD. MANY OF THE MOSES FAMILY MEMBERS ARE
OUT OF TOWN. I WAS OVERDUE BECAUSE I WAS TRAVELLING. THANK YOU
ALL FOR AN AMAZING DISPLAY OF HUMANITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS EMMETT BACK?
>> HELLO. THIS IS EMMETT. I'M SORRY. I'M NOT ACCUSTOM TO USING
THESE THINGS. I'M ON THE PHONE. I'M A RESIDENT OF 237 FRANKLIN
STREET, LITERALLY A FEW YARDS FROM BARON PLAZA AND I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO THAT ISSUE. THIS IS THE ONLY PARK IN CENTRAL SQUARE, THOSE MATURE
TREES, CAME OUT OF A DESIGN 30 YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS FIRST INITIATED,
AND CURRENTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE AT YOUR OWN DOORSTEP OF
THE MANY PEOPLE WHO GATHER IN FRONT OF CITY HALL, WHY? BECAUSE
THERE'S NO PARK. SO PLEASE DON'T CUT DOWN THE TREES. THESE TREES
CAN BE REPURPOSED, BUT STAY ON SITE. DON'T PUT IN SAPLINGS TEN FEET
HIGH THAT WON'T MATURE TO LONG AFTER I'M DEAD. AND OTHER PEOPLE
IN THAT PLAZA. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO USE THIS. NOT JUST THE
HOMELESS. IT IS THE DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE, THE POOR PEOPLE OF
CAMBRIDGE. AND THE SENIOR CITIZENS WHO LIVE STEPS AWAY FROM IT.
AND THAT'S REALLY ALL MY WHOLE ISSUE. PLEASE DON'T CUT DOWN THE
TREES. WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE GLEB, FOLLOWED BY PATRICK.
>> HELLO. I'M GLEB, AND THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING MY COMMENT
TODAY. I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT BRIDGE ON MASS AVENUE, ACROSS
CHARLES RIVER TO BOSTON. AND I SUPPORT ADDING PROTECTIVE BIKE
LANES. I RIDE THAT BRIDGE MANY TIMES AND IT IS SCARY. THAT BRIDGE IS
FLAT AND CARS ACCELERATE. I'M ALWAYS THINKING WHILE RIDING HOW THE
WHEELS CAN SLIP AND I WILL FALL UNDER THE WHEELS OF THE SPEEDING
CAR. WINDY DAY IS SCARY BECAUSE IT CAN PUSH YOU WHILE RIDING. I
NEVER TAKE MY SON ACROSS THE BRIDGE EVEN IF WE RIDE TOGETHER. THIS
BRIDGE IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. I FEEL THE SAFEST DURING
RUSH HOUR WHEN THE BRIDGE IS FULL OF CARS AND GOING NOWHERE AND I
PASS ON THE RIGHT. MASS AVENUE HAS AN EXCELLENT BIKE
INFRASTRUCTURE.
AND IT SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO BOSTON TO MAKE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
WORK AND ADDING PROTECTED BIKE LANE WILL MAKE THE BRIDGE BETTER


PAGE 8

May 24, 2021

AND LESS RISKY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE PATRICK BARRETT. FOLLOWED BY
HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> 41 PLEASANT STREET. THANK YOU. I'M CALLING HERE BECAUSE OF POLICY
ORDER NUMBER FOUR, REGARDING CAROL BARON PLAZA AND ASK YOU
REJECT THE PROPOSAL. THE RECONSTRUCTION GROUP MET OVER THE PAST
TWO AND HALF YEARS, AT ANYTIME, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DIRECT ALL COMMENTS TO ME AS CHAIR.
>> AT ANY GIVEN TIME, THE COUNCIL COULD HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD ANY
ONE OF RECOMMENDATIONS, QUESTIONS ABOUT OUTREACH, ABOUT
ANYTHING THAT THIS GROUP HAD BEEN DOING. IT IS ALSO PUBLIC
INFORMATION. YOU CAN GO ON THE WEBSITE, LOOK UP THE PROCESS, AND
JUST CONTROL F, THE WORD UNHOUSED POPULATION OR THE INDIGENOUS
POPULATION TO CAROL BARON PLAZA HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION.
THERE IS NOT A MEETING WITH THE UNHOUSED MEETING HAS NOT BEEN
BROUGHT UP. WHAT I FIND JUST ABSOLUTELY BAFFLING ABOUT THIS POLICY
ORDER IS THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE SPEAKING TONIGHT ABOUT THE THING THE
BID IS ALREADY DOING. WE HAVE SHARP CONTAINERS AND WE REPAIR THE
BIG BELLIES. WE HAVE POWER AT CARL BARON PLAZA TO PLUG IN THE CELL
PHONE. IN THE NEW DESIGN, THE REASON WHY THINGS ARE REMOVABLE,
WE WANT TO PROGRAM IT. BE ABLE TO PUT EVENTS THERE, HAVE A
STARLIGHT STAGE TWO. WHEN STARLIGHT GETS KICKED OUT WHERE IT IS,
WE HAVE ABILITY TO PROGRAM CARL BARON PLAZA FOR THE FIRST TIME.
WHEN I JOINED THE CSBA, MUCH NICER PERSON I WAS CHARGED WITH
TRYING TO PROGRAM IT. IT IS A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE WITHOUT CREATING
ADA ISSUES AND ISSUES WITH POWERING THE SPACE. THE NEW DESIGN IS
GORGEOUS. IT INCLUDES EVERYBODY, NOT JUST UNHOUSED POPULATION,
BUT EVERYBODY. THAT'S WHY IT IS IMPORTANT. THAT'S WHY IT IS SPECIAL, IT
IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR EVERYBODY. WE CAN'T KEEP GOING FOR THE PUBLIC
PROCESSES AND HAVING CITIZENS SPEND HOURS AND HOURS AND DAYS,
TWO AND HALF YEARS OF THEIR TIME AND ONLY TO HAVE A COUNCILLOR
BRING A POLICY ORDER AT THE LAST MINUTE. WE ARE A WEEK AWAY. I
CAN'T HELP THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION TO THAT. NOT HOSTILE IN THE
ARC TEXTURE, ONLY IN THE LATE POLICY ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS HEATHER HOFFMAN, FOLLOWED BY JAMES
WILLIAMSON.
>> HELLO. HEATHER HOFFMAN, 213 HURLEY STREET. I WILL START WITH
MUNICIPAL BROADBAND. I HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN PUBLIC
HOUSING THAT THEIR INTERNET IS ABOUT AS CRAPPY AS MINE, MAYBE
CRAPPIER. THEY DEFINITELY NEED IT, BUT THEY ARE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES.
WE REALLY, REALLY NEED MUNICIPAL BROADBAND.
WITH RESPECT TO REALTIME COLLISION REPORTING. FIRST, I SUGGEST YOU
SUBSTITUTE THE WORD COLLISION FOR ACCIDENT. IT IS THE MORE CURRENT
TERM AND PROBABLY THE MORE ACCURATE TERM. AND YES, WE SHOULD
HAVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. WITH RESPECT TO DEBT FREE

PAGE 9

May 24, 2021

PUBLIC COLLEGE, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A FULL RIDE TO COLLEGE. I
WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR MY KID'S PUBLIC COLLEGE.
AND I KNOW THAT IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO DEAL WITH THAT AFTER. IT IS
A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT IN THE WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY TO
MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO LEARN STUFF. AND BECOME MORE
EDUCATED.
WITH RESPECT TO MASS AVE AT BANK STREET. ONE THING I KEEP HEARING
ALL OVER THE CITY IS PEOPLE SPEAKING DISPARAGINGLY OF CAR STORAGE ON
OUR PUBLIC STREETS. AS AN ASIDE, I WILL POINT OUT, IN CAMBRIDGE THE
STREETS ARE NORMALLY TAKEN IN SOME PLACES LIKE BOSTON PREFER
EASEMENT. CAMBRIDGE PREFERS METER TAKE YOUR SIGNS OUT OF THE
PUBLIC SIDEWALK, YOU DON'T OWN THEM. WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS CAR
STORAGE AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN
CONSEQUENCES AND WHO MIGHT ACTUALLY NEED THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS POLICY ORDER TALKS ABOUT. I HOPE THAT WE'LL TAKE IT TO HEART.
WITH RESPECT TO CAROL BARRON PLAZA, I THINK THAT THIS HIGHLIGHTS
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR YEARS. YES, WE HAVE
THE PUBLIC PROCESSES AND SOMETIMES THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN
SAY TO PEOPLE THAT WILL ALERT THEM SO THEY ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND
THAT SOMETHING IS BEING DISCUSSED. BUT THERE ARE ALSO SITUATIONS
WHERE PEOPLE ARE IGNORED. AND A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE ASKS
THEMSELVES WHETHER THE CITY IS EVER LISTENING TO ANY OF US. AND I
THINK THAT PERHAPS ONE OF YOUR GOALS IN THE NEXT COUNCIL IS TO
ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, HEATHER. JAMES WILLIAMSON?
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. JACKSON PLACE, JEFFERSON PARK. AND I APPRECIATE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT BARON PLAZA. AND
JUST FOR BACKGROUND, I LIVED IN CENTRAL SQUARE FOR 35 YEARS. I GOT
DISPLACED AND ENDED UP THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP IN JEFFERSON PARK
AND I HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE CAPACIOUSNESS OF JEFFERSON PARK AND
REALLY NICE THINGS ABOUT IT.
AND I'M SORRY TO THINK IT IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED AND THE PLAN IS
REALLY NOT GREAT. NOT THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE MODERNIZATION, BUT
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NICE ABOUT IT SINCE I COME TO APPRECIATE IT
THAT I THINK SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND I WORRY ARE NOT GOING TO BE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT.
BECAUSE I TOOK ONCE I GOT UP HERE, I TOOK THE 83 BUS EVERY NIGHT TO
GET HOME. AND SO I CONTINUE TO BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PLAZA
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE BUS IS. AND WHEN THE IDEA OF EXPANDING
THE PLAZA BEGAN TO APPEAR, I THINK I WAS AMONG A SMALL NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO SAW REALLY GOT INVOLVED EARLY AND WITH A LOT OF
ENTHUSIASM THOUGHT THERE WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE


PAGE 10

May 24, 2021

PLAZA AND TO HAVE MORE OF AN AMENITY FOR THE PUBLIC. AND IT MIGHT
RELIEVE A LITTLE PRESSURE ON THE CONFLICTS THAT ARISE WITH SOME OF
THE PEOPLE THAT HANG OUT IN THE EXISTING PLAZA.
A MORE EXPANSIVE PLAZA WOULD BE A NICE OPPORTUNITY. AND AS THE
PROCESS DEVELOPED, THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT APPRECIATED THIS.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED, I BELIEVE, IS THAT THE
PROJECT, THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS ESSENTIALLY HIJACKED BY CITY STAFF,
WHOSE ONLY REAL INTEREST WAS IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY A BICYCLE EXTENDING THE BICYCLE LANE THAT IS
GOING TO BE UP RIVER STREET, THROUGH THE PLAZA. THE PLAN NOW
ACTUALLY HAS A SEPARATED SORT OF A CYCLE TRACK GOING RIGHT
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS EXPANDED PLAZA AREA, BASICALLY
RENDERING IT UNUSABLE FOR ANYBODY BUT PEOPLE WHO MAY BE WAITING
FOR BUSES OR RIDING THEIR BIKES THROUGH THE AREA.
IT IS AN UNNECESSARY PLAN IN THAT RESPECT. THE BIKE LANE, THERE COULD
BE A BIKE LANE, THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIKE LANE, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAZA AND THEY REFUSE TO CONSIDER THE FEASIBILITY
OF ALTERNATIVES. DESPITE THE FACT MEMBERS OF THE RIVER STREET
RECONSTRUCTION WORKING GROUP CALLED THIS OUT AND OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE CALLED IT OUT. IT IS NOT THE ONLY FLAW IN
THE PLAN, BUT IT IS A CENTRAL ONE AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE PART OF THE
DISCUSSION AND WE DO NEED A BROADER
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. THAT CONCLUDES
EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE MOTION BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT, ROLL CALL?

THE TEAM WERE WILLING TO ATTACK THE ISSUE AT ALL OF THE ANGLES AND I
TRULY APPRECIATE. ALTHOUGH, THERE'S A NEED TO CREATE NEW
PROGRAMS TO FILL IN THE GAPS THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO LIFT
UP AND SUPPORT THE AMAZING GROUPS THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK IN
THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE THE TRUST OF RESIDENTS. THE FRIDAY NIGHT
HYPE TEAM, CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES, THEY HAVE BEEN
PROVIDING THE MONTHLY PROGRAMMING FOR THE STUDENTS USING THEIR
OWN MONEY. THEY HAVE ESTIMATED THEY PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
FROM THEIR POCKETS AND HAVE BEEN UNPAID FOR THE ADDITIONAL WORK
AND SERVICE TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE. I'M PLEASED TO SEE THIS CRITICAL
PROGRAM SUPPORTING OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE
LEVEL OF FUNDING THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND TO CONTINUE TO
SURVIVE AND THRIVE. I KNEW THERE WERE A LOT OF MEETINGS, A LOT OF
BUDGETS TO GET TO THIS PLACE, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CITY
MANAGER FOR LOOKING AT THE MANY SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUE OF
SUPPORTING THE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH HEALTHY FUN ACTIVITIES THAT
PROVIDE THAT DEEP MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS, I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND I WANT TO SEE I DIDN'T
KNOW IF YOU WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ITEM
AND THE ALLOCATION AND THE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE TEAM.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #2
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
reappointment of the following
persons as a members of the
Conservation Commission:
Kathryn Hess, David Lyons
and Elysse Magnotto-Cleary.

>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR, THE CITY
COUNCIL, AND THE GREAT COMMUNICATION WORKING TOGETHER. MATT
AND ELLEN WHO WERE LEADS REPRESENTING THE CITY. I WANT TO THANK
FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE, WHO CAME IN AND HAD A PLAN IT BLEW ME OUT OF
THE WATER ON WHAT THEY DO AND HOW WELL THEY DO IT. WORKING WITH
US AND A TEAM EFFORT AND AFTER THE FIRST MEETING, IT WAS WORKING
ON DETAILS. THEY DO GREAT WORK AND I'M JUST SO PLEASED TO HAVE
THEM AS A PARTNER NOW. AND WE PRESENT THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR, IT
WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE BUDGET. AND WE STILL HAVE WORK TO
DO, IT IS A GREAT ORGANIZATION. IT IS A GREAT GROUP. AND THE MORE WE
CAN USE THEM, THE BETTER OFF WE'LL ALL BE. I KNOW MATT PLAYED A KEY
ROLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING. I WANT TO
THANK HIM.
>> MATT: MOST OF ALL OF IT, BUT IT HAS BEEN A PLASH TO WORK WITH THE
CREW AT FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO THEIR KICK
OFF EVENT IN THE NEW WORLD, AT THE FIELDHOUSE, AT THE HIGH SCHOOL,
WHICH PRIOR TO THAT, THEY HAD BEEN STRUGGLING TO FIND SPACE. AS
THEY CONTINUE TO GROW, THE FIELDHOUSE BECAME A GREAT PLACE AND A
GREAT OPPORTUNITY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT
AND THE ATHLETICS DEPARTMENT WHO HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS. AND
ELLEN IS ON. I DON'T KNOW IF ELLEN WANTS TO CHIME IN, TOO.
>> THROUGH YOU, I THINK YOU SAID IT ALL. IT IS EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM, WHICH SO DEEPLY SUPPORTS OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUING WORK WITH
THEM.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I IT IS NICE TO ANNOUNCE THEY


PAGE 12

May 24, 2021

HAVE A BUDGET ALLOCATION TONIGHT, BUT THEY HAVE A NEW HOME AT
THE WAR MEMORIAL SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO STRESS ABOUT SPACE EVERY
MONTH TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY HAVE
INVITED YOU FRIDAY NIGHT TO CHECK OUT THE ACTIVITIES IN PERSON. I
HOPE YOU TAKE THEM UP ON IT AND I THINK YOU WILL BE PLEASED. THANK
YOU.
>> I THINK THEY WILL SEE ME AND MATT THERE. IT WAS THE LATEST.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO OFFER MY THANKS TO
NOT ONLY THE CITY, BUT TO VICE MAYOR MALLON, WHO REALLY TOOK THIS
BY THE REINS AND THE MAYOR AS WELL. THIS IS A FANTASTIC PROGRAM
THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE A REAL GAME CHANGER FOR A LOT OF YOUNG
PEOPLE IN THE CITY. THANK YOU TO DEBBIE AND TO EVERYBODY WHO DOES
THIS. IT IS SOMETHING THAT GREW OUT OF THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS
THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. IT IS REALLY EXCITING AND I'M GLAD WE
ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO IT. I HAVE SOME MIDDLE SCHOOLERS NOW WHO MAY TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANT TO JUST SAY I WAS VERY
PLEASED TO SEE THIS ON THE AGENDA. I WILL SPEAK TO BETTY, AND WHAT
SHE HAS DONE. WHEN SHE THANKED AND ACKNOWLEDGED PEOPLE,
LETTING US KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS
PROGRAM ON THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, THIS IS A REALLY EXAMPLE OF
SOMETHING BEING ORGANIC, COMING FROM THE COMMUNITY, AND BEING
SUPPORTED BY THE COUNCIL. I LOOK FORWARD TO ALL THE DIFFERENT
PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN. I'M
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE MENTORSHIP PART OF IT BECAUSE IT IS BUILDING
AS WE CLIMB. GOOD FOR US. GOOD FOR FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. AND A
SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MENTIONED THAT I DON'T
KNOW THE NAMES TO MENTION. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR STEADFAST
SUPPORT AND WORKING ON THE PROGRAM. AND NOW WE HAVE THIS
WONDERFUL CITY COLLABORATION, I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO THE
OUTCOMES THAT ARE GOING TO BE QUITE BENEFICIAL FOR OUR YOUNG
PEOPLE. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND APPROVE THIS
APPROPRIATION ON THE ROLL CALL VOTE?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THAT MOTION:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO THE CALENDAR. WE HAVE A CHARTER
RIGHT ITEM FROM LAST WEEK. IT WAS A COMMUNICATION FROM THE
COMMUNITY REGARDING CARL BARON PLAZA RECONSTRUCTION. EXERCISED
BY COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. I'D LIKE TO
MOVE SUSPENSION TO BRING FORWARD POLICY ORDER NUMBER FOUR AS
WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THAT, ROLL CALL?

Motion to suspend the rules to
bring forward Policy Order #4

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. AS WE HEARD IN PUBLIC
COMMENT, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON WITH THIS PROJECT. AND THIS POLICY
ORDER I DO WANT TO THANK MY COSPONSORS AS WELL, IT CALLS FOR A
COMMITTEE HEARING IN HEALTH ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN SERVICES. A
JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING TO PUBLICLY DISCUSS SOME OF THE CONCERNS
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE
ALREADY SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS ARE ALREADY BEING INCORPORATED
INTO THE DESIGN. THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE AND
THEN ALSO TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT HAVEN'T
BEEN ADDRESSED YET IN THE HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS AN EVEN
BETTER PROJECT.
I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE WILL BE REDESIGNING THE PLAZA
AND THIS POLICY ORDER IS NOT IN ANY WAY MEANT TO INTERFERE WITH
THAT. IT IS SIMPLY MAKING SURE WE HEAR ALL OUR COMMUNITIES
MEMBERS AND THEIR CONCERNS AND ADDRESS AS MANY OF THEM AS WE
POSSIBLY CAN. I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A GOOD HEARING AND HAVE AN
EVEN BETTER PROJECT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS I'M VERY GLAD WE ARE
CONSIDERING INCLUDING AND HOW IT INCLUDE THE VOICES OF THE ENTIRE
COMMUNITY, AND NOTABLY THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY. WE GOT THE
PETITION AND AS NOTED, SOME SUGGESTIONS INCLUDED HAVE ALREADY
BEEN COMPLETED, PERHAPS PARTIALLY, PERHAPS NOT, IN THE REDESIGN
PROPOSAL AND WE HEARD THERE ARE A LOT OF DESIGN MEETINGS WITH
ATTEMPTED OUTREACH TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY. WE KNOW FROM A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT


PAGE 14

May 24, 2021

OUTREACH IS NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNCIL
AND THE COMMUNITY TO KNOW HOW INPUT IS RECEIVED, WHAT INPUT HAS
BEEN RECEIVED, WHAT HAS BEEN DONE, WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED,
RATIONALE AND THE REASONING BEHIND CHANGES. IT WILL BE A COUPLE
YEAR PROCESS, I BELIEVE. WE SHOULD HAVE A RECORD OF HOW PEOPLE ARE
INCLUDED AND HOW TO FURTHER INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S A BIG
CHALLENGE IN CENTRAL SQUARE AND THERE ARE MEETINGS, THE BID DID A
LOT OF WORK. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME AND PERHAPS FOR THE COUNCIL
AND THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE A REPORT BACK ON THE RANGE OF
ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN AND WHAT ELSE IS PLANNED. THE
ISSUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY
MANNER. HAVING TRIED TO SCHEDULE A COMMITTEE MEETING AND BEING
TOLD IT IS AT LEAST SEVERAL WEEKS OUT, IF NOT A MONTH, I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE SCHEDULING OF COMMITTEE MEETINGS SINCE
THE DESIGN PROCESS IS UNDERWAY. IT IS CLOSING IN. I SPOKE TO THE CITY
MANAGER, HE SAID HE COULD REPORT BACK QUICKLY IN RESPONSE TO
CONCERNS RAISED. RATHER THAN WAITING FOR SCHEDULING A JOINT
MEETING, I PROPOSE WE STRIKE THE RESOLVE PARAGRAPH ABOUT THE
MEETING AND HAVE A STRONGER STATEMENT AND AMEND IT TO READ... I
JUST WROTE IT UP AS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. THE CITY MANAGER BE AND
HEREBY REQUESTED TO REPORT BACK TO THE COUNCIL ON ALL WORK DONE
ON THE REDESIGN PROCESS AND ALL FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY,
INCLUDING THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
PETITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN TWO WEEKS. WE WOULD BE
ABLE TO GET FEEDBACK SOONER. AFTER THAT, WE NEED ANOTHER
COMMITTEE MEETING TO REVIEW IT, IT MAKES SENSE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN UP NEXT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. BEFORE I COMMENT ON THE
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE PART, I WANT TO SAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WORK REALLY, REALLY HARD ON THIS PROCESS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. I
KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME FEELINGS THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS WERE
MADE IN A TO UNDERMINE THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY THAT IS OFTEN
USES CARL BARON PLAZA. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE OR THE INTENT OF
THE FOLKS THAT WORKED ON THIS COMMITTEE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE IDEA TO HAVE FURNITURE THAT MOVES, MOVABLE
FURNITURE, IT IS REALLY TO TRY TO PROGRAM THE SPACE AS WE HEARD IN
PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE STATED PURPOSE. AND I
WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT TO THE FOLKS IN THE
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY. IF WE'LL HAVE ENTERTAINMENT THERE,
EVERYBODY CAN ENJOY. I HOPE THAT WE DON'T AUTOMATICALLY JUST
ASSUME BAD INTENT ON PEOPLE'S BEHALF. I THINK PEOPLE SPENT A LOT OF
TIME ON THIS. WITH THAT SAID, I DO THINK, AS I SAID LAST WEEK, I THINK
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS IN THE LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED THAT MAKE A
LOT OF SENSE TO ME. A LOT OF THEM ARE BEING DONE. SOME OF THEM
PROBABLY CAN'T BE DONE. THE AMAZON PIECE OF HAVING THE DOORS
OPEN INWARD, THAT'S A FIRE CODE. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, I


PAGE 15

May 24, 2021

DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT. YOU
CAN'T HAVE DOORS THAT OPEN INWARD.
AND THE NARCAN BOX WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IS BEING
DISCUSSED FOR YEARS. IT HAD SOME MOVEMENT BEHIND IT UNTIL COVID
HIT AND EVERYBODY SORT OF THINGS GOT HAYWIRE. THAT'S BEEN
DISCUSSED FOR A LONG TIME AND CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THIS SHOULD
BE PART OF THE PLAN.
I DON'T WANT TO HOLD UP THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. I'D BE FINE IF
WE GET A REPORT BACK FROM THE CITY MANAGER FROM THIS IN TWO
WEEKS. I THINK ANYTHING LONGER THAN IS UNACCEPTABLE. I DO THINK WE
SHOULD HAVE A SUB COMMITTEE HEARING SO PEOPLE CAN PARTICIPATE
ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION BACK. THAT'S OFTEN WHAT WE DO.
WE ASK THE MANAGER FOR A REPORT AND REFER THAT REPORT BACK TO A
SUB COMMITTEE MEETING.
THAT IS SOMETHING I GUESS, WE DIDN'T REFER THIS LETTER TO THE CITY
MANAGER. IT WAS THE CHARTER RIGHT. WE CAN REFER IT TO THE CITY
MANAGER, GET A RESPONSE, AND THEN LOOK TO HOLD THE MEETING DOWN
THE LINE. I DON'T WANT TO HOLD UP ANY DISCUSSIONS ON THIS PROJECT. I
DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER FOLKS HAVE TO SAY. I FEEL THERE'S A LOT OF
THINGS ON THE LIST THAT ARE PART OF THE PROJECT, WHICH IS REALLY
GOOD. IT DOES SORT OF SPEAK TO ME THAT THE FACT THERE'S A LETTER
SOME THINGS ARE INCLUDED IN AND IN THE LETTER, IT IS MAYBE A
BREAKDOWN IN THE COMMUNICATION A LITTLE BIT. THEY ARE BEING DONE
AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THEY ARE BEING DONE. THAT TELLS ME THERE
WAS SOME DISCONNECT ALONG THE WAY AND WE HAVE TO BE BETTER
ABOUT THAT. I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY. I DID
WANT TO MAKE NOTE OF THE FACT THE PEOPLE WHO DID WORK ON THE
PROCESS, I BELIEVE, DID SO IN GOOD FAITH. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE, YOU ARE NEXT?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN WHEN HE SAYS EVERYBODY WORKED IN GOOD FAITH AT
KNOWING THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THIS. PUBLIC SPACE IS PROBABLY
THE MOST DIFFICULT KIND OF DESIGN TO DO. SORRY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC
SPACE BECAUSE IT DOES INVOLVE EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY'S INPUT.
SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT THE RATIONALE FOR MOVABLE SEATS WAS FOR
FLEXIBILITY. OF COURSE, THAT MAKES SENSE, BUT THE OTHER THING IS
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC PLACES ALLOW YOU
TO MOVE YOUR SEATS TO TALK TO ONE PERSON YOU WANT TO TALK TO OR
TO FORM A GROUP OF FIVE. THAT'S THE FLEXIBILITY. THE OTHER THING,
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT MAKE A SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC SPACE,
SOMEONE IS RESPONSIBLE, SOMEONE IS OVERSEEING IT, SOMEONE'S TAKING
THE CHAIRS IN OR OUT. I ASSUME THAT'S THE CASE, BUT WE DON'T TEND TO
DO THIS. LASTLY, ONE OF THE REASONS THERE'S SO MANY INTERESTS IN THIS
SPACE, AS I SAID MANY TIMES, WE LACK OPEN SPACE. AND IN OUR SQUARES
MAYBE MORE SO, LIKE CENTRAL SQUARE. THIS COMPOUNDS THE NEED TO
GET IT RIGHT. THAT'S WHY I AGREED TO COSPONSOR THIS IS JUST TO MAKE

PAGE 16

May 24, 2021

SURE COSPONSOR THE WISH TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING IS JUST TO MAKE
SURE THAT ALL INTERESTS ARE THERE.
WHEN YOU HAVE A MICROWAVE AND A REFRIGERATOR, THOSE ARE HARD
THINGS TO INCLUDE IN AN OUTDOOR SPACE. MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE IN THE
SO CALLED POLICE STATION, WHICH I THINK IS UNDERPERFORMING
ENORMOUSLY AS A POSITIVE ON THE SQUARE THERE. THESE ARE ALL
NORMAL DISCUSSIONS. AGAIN, THE SMALLER THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE,
THE MORE EVERYBODY'S LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT SUITS THEIR
NEEDS. SO, WE IN ESSENCE, HAVE MAINTAINED THIS WITHOUT THINKING
ABOUT IT, LACK OF OPEN SPACE IN THE CITY AND THE OVER PROGRAMMING
NEED THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD, VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION TONIGHT. I THINK WE SHOULD ASK FOR A REPORT FROM THE
CITY MANAGER AND REFER IT TO THE MEETING THAT IS PROPOSED, THE
JOINT MEETING BETWEEN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN
SERVICES. I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE
CONSTRUCTION IN CENTRAL SQUARE THAT IS HAPPENING AT CARL BARON
PLAZA AND THE RIVER STREET RECONSTRUCTION. I WANT TO SAY THAT I
HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME TO
THE TABLE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND
RETHINK CARL BARON PLAZA SO IT IS A SPACE FOR EVERYBODY, SO WE CAN
HAVE ARTS, A STARLIGHT SQUARE PART 2. I HOPE I REALLY HOPE WHEN WE
HAVE THE CONVERSATION AT THE MEETING, WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE OUR CITY
STAFF THERE, WHO ARE LEADING THE YEAR'S LONG CONVERSATION. I THINK
SOMETIMES CITY STAFF GET LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATIONS AND THE
COMMITTEE HEARINGS. KATHY WATKINS, SHERRY, THOSE FOLKS NEED TO BE
THERE AT THE MEETING AND GIVE US A SENSE OF THE PROCESS. WHO IS
THERE, WHAT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUP VOICES ARE HEARD AND
WHO WASN'T. THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE EASY PICK UPS, SOME
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THIS. SOME ARE PLANNED IN FOR THE DESIGN.
THAT'S EVEN STATED IN THE POLICY ORDER. SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS
INCLUDED IN THE PETITION MAY ALREADY COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY
INCLUDED IN THE REDESIGN PROPOSAL.
I GUESS I WANT TO SAY, I DON'T THINK CARL BARON PLAZA CAN INVOLVE FOR
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT WE NEED IN CENTRAL SQUARE. IT CAN'T BE
EVERYTHING. WE HAVE LOCAL PARTNERS THAT CAN HELP US WITH THE
CRITICAL NEEDS, LIKE REFRIGERATORS AND MICROWAVE. COUNCILLOR
CARLONE MENTIONED SPACE THAT IS UNDERUTILIZED. WE HAVE PARTNERS
IN THE SQUARE THAT CAN HELP US. I WORK ON THE ISSUE OF FOOD
INSECURITY, I'D LOVE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT BETTER FOOD OPTIONS FOR
THE UNHOUSED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
THAT WHOLISTICALLY. HOW TO USE THE PARTNERS TO MEET THAT NEED OR
THE OTHER SPACES. IT JUST DOESN'T NEED TO BE PLACED ON CARL BARRA
PLAZA AND ZOOM OUT AND THINK ABOUT CENTRAL SQUARE AND WHAT WE
ARE ASKING FOR CARL BARON PLAZA TO BE. AS I THINK ABOUT THE


PAGE 17

May 24, 2021

RECONSTRUCTION, I DON'T KNOW IF THE CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE CENTERED AROUND WHERE OUR PEOPLE
GOING TO GO FOR 24 MONTHS DURING THIS CONSTRUCTION. HOW ARE WE
CARING FOR THE UNHOUSED RESIDENTS DURING THE TIME. HOW DO WE
PROVIDE SERVICES, HOW ARE WE PROVIDING SPACE, HOW ARE WE CARING
FOR FOLKS DURING A REALLY DISRUPTIVE TIME IN CENTRAL SQUARE. I THINK
WE NEED THAT LARGER MEETING AND I WANT US TO ZOOM OUT OF CARL
BARON PLAZA AND WANT US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CARE FOR THE
UNHOUSED RESIDENTS IN CENTRAL SQUARE. AS A WHOLE. HOW DO WE
LEVERAGE THE PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT
CARING FOR FOLKS IN A REALLY WHOLISTIC WAY RATHER THAN THE NITPICK
THING AROUND WHICH OUTLETS ARE IN WHAT PLACES. ALTHOUGH, I
UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT, TOO. I'M NOT MINIMIZING
THOSE. I WANT US TO HAVE A ZOOMED OUT CONVERSATION. I DO THINK
THAT HAVING A JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING IS A GOOD IDEA WITH THAT
REPORT FROM THE CITY MANAGER THAT WILL TELL US EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED. I WANT TO SAY, I REALLY WANT THE CITY STAFF TO BE THERE
AND INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO HAVE A
LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE TWO YEARS.
THOSE ARE MY LONG THOUGHTS. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR, I YIELD
BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR TOOMEY NEXT?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN
GOING ON FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. THERE'S A LOT OF INPUT, I ASSUME ALL
STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS. THE UNHOUSED AND
COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, THE CITY STAFF, CENTRAL SQUARE BUSINESS
ASSOCIATION. WE TALK ABOUT HAVING ANOTHER MEETING, MY FEAR IS
THAT ANOTHER MEETING THEN BECOMES TWO OR THREE MORE OTHER
MEETINGS. AND I'M JUST SITTING HERE AND I WALK BY CARL BARON PLAZA
MANY TIMES, DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE LOT SIZE OF THAT? I DON'T THINK
IT IS AN ACRE IN THE LOT SIZE. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH WE CAN ACTUALLY
PUT ON THAT LITTLE SITE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND HOW TO
ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THAT.
I ASSUME THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS MET FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
HAS DELVED INTO THAT ISSUE. I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE LOT SIZE AND WITH
THE PANDEMIC AND HAVING ALL THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND CLOSENESS OF
PEOPLE IN THAT VERY, VERY SMALL AREA I'M CURIOUS. I KNOW WE ARE
PROVIDING MANY, MANY SERVICES AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE
SERVICES THERE, BUT THIS IS A VERY, VERY SMALL LOT SIZE. AND TO THINK
WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES, I
GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. I QUESTION HOW THAT IS GOING TO
BE ACCOMPLISHED. I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ANYMORE PUBLIC
MEETINGS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS NOT SPOKEN WHO WOULD
LIKE TO BE HEARD? I'LL JUST GO BRIEFLY. I THINK WHAT HAS GO AHEAD,
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.


PAGE 18

May 24, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU, I WAS SLOW ON GETTING THE HAND
UP. I WANT TO ECHO WHAT COUNCILLOR TOOMEY SAID. I REMEMBER
WHEN THE DISCUSSION AROUND CARL BARON PLAZA IN THE UPDATING
EXCUSE ME UPDATING OF RIVER STREET BEGAN. AND I KNOW THE
COUNCIL, I IN PARTICULAR, HAVE SAID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL
THE VOICES ARE HEARD AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. I ASKED AND THE
CITY RESPONDED THAT A LOT OF THE EXCUSE ME WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE 237 FRANKLIN BUILDING SO SENIORS COULD BE INVOLVED. A LOT OF
SENIORS IN THAT AREA, 237 FRANKLIN... 114 NORFOLK STREET EXCUSE ME.
IT IS IMPORTANT LOOKING THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SENIORS WE
HEARD THE VOICES AND MANY OTHERS. AND ALTHOUGH I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN THE PETITION, I WOULD SAY, HAVE THE
PETITION BE A PART OF THE RECORD THAT GOES FORWARD AS THEY
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT DESIGN. BUT TO HAVE ANOTHER PUBLIC
PROCESS, I THINK IT LIES IN THE FACE OF GENUINE COMMUNITY
INVOLVEMENT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN HAD. WE ARE DOING YEOMAN'S
WORK AND TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS AND
INDIVIDUALS THAT USE THE SQUARE PARTICULARLY MORE DELICATE
RESIDENTS, CITIZENS, THAT ARE IN CENTRAL SQUARE.
I HAVE TO ALSO SAY EXCUSE ME WHEN YOU HAVE THE ENGAGEMENT OF
SO MANY PEOPLE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE
THROWING OUT WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY, IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM
TO COME BACK AND PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY FEEL AS THOUGH I SPENT
ALL THIS TIME AND WASN'T HEARD. NO MATTER HOW GENUINE THIS MAY
SEEM, THESE PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE ADDED TO AS IT
HAPPENS BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE PLAZA TO BE
DEVELOPED. RIVER STREET ITSELF WILL TAKE A LONG TIME. I RESPECTFULLY
ASK THIS BE WITHDRAWN. I SUSPECT THAT WON'T HAPPEN. I'M JUST NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. ALTHOUGH, BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S
OTHER WAYS THAT THOSE VOICES CAN BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION. THANK
YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK THAT'S ALL WHO WANTED TO RAISE THEIR
HANDS ON THE TOPIC. THEN I WILL GO BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. I
WILL JUST SAY, I CONQUER WITH THE EARLIER POINTS THAT COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN MADE AROUND REFERRING THIS, GETTING AN UPDATE, AND I'M
FINE WITH HAVING AN ADDITIONAL MEETING ON THIS TO GO OVER
WHATEVER THAT REPORT SAYS. I THINK WE HAVE HEARD FROM AT LEAST
EVERYONE ONCE. I THINK I KNOW THE PULSE OF WHERE FOLKS ARE AT. I
WOULD SUGGEST WE AFTER I GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, WE EITHER
VOTE THIS UP OR DOWN AND GO FROM THERE. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. I CONQUER.
THAT WAS MY SUGGESTION. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THE
POLICY ORDER AT ALL. IT ALREADY ASKS FOR A REPORT FROM THE MANAGER.
I SUGGEST WE REFER THE PETITION TO THE POLICY ORDER AND THEN REFER
THE POLICY ORDER TO WE ADOPT THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT MADE EARLIER,


PAGE 19

May 24, 2021

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. COUNCILLOR NOLAN, CAN YOU SPEAK THAT INTO
THE RECORD? YOU CAN SAY IT AGAIN FOR EVERYBODY? WE HAVE TO
DISPOSE OF IT BEFORE WE VOTE.
>> THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT AND I WILL SHARE IT ON THE SCREEN.
DELETE THE EXISTING RESOLVED PARAGRAPH AND THEN TO AMEND THE
ORDERED PARAGRAPH TO READ AS... REPORT BACK ON THE REDESIGN
PROPOSAL AND ALL FEEDBACK WITH THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PETITION AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE AND WITHIN TWO WEEKS. THAT'S THE AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED
BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THOUGHTS ON THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. IF WE REMOVE THE RESOLVED
PARAGRAPH OKAY. I SEE IT. REPORT BACK TO THE FULL COUNCIL RATHER
THAN HAVING A SEPARATE MEETING. THAT'S WHAT THE AMENDMENT
WOULD DO? RIGHT? THROUGH YOU TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT'S WHAT I PROPOSE. INSTEAD, WE WANT TO
SAY AFTER THIS REPORT IT BE REFERRED THE REPORT BE RECEIVED BY THE
FULL COUNCIL AND SUBSEQUENTLY I THINK YOU CAN AMEND AN
AMENDMENT ONCE. I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE
WANT IT TO MOVE FORWARD. IT IS THE END OF THE LONG PROCESS AND I'M
HOPEFUL WE CAN BE CLEAR ON HOW IT IS THAT WE CAN BEST MOVE
FORWARD AND KNOW WHAT KIND OF INPUT HAS HAPPENED ALREADY. AND
IF IT IS NOT AS INCLUSIVE AS WE'D HOPE, PRESUMABLY THIS REPORT WILL LET
US KNOW THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WILL DEFER THIS QUESTION THROUGH YOU
TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. MAYBE WE COULD I KNOW THE HEARING
SCHEDULE IS REALLY BACKED UP. BEING ONE OF THE CO CHAIRS OF THE
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND KNOWING IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT AND WITH
HOLIDAYS COMING AND VARIOUS THINGS THAT CERTAIN DAYS ARE OFF THE
CALENDAR. THROUGH YOU AND TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, WHAT ARE
THE THOUGHTS ON CHARTER RIGHT THIS ORDER FOR THIS WEEK SO YOU AND
I CAN TALK TO THE CLERK AND OTHERS ABOUT WHEN A MEETING COULD BE
SCHEDULED. THAT MIGHT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN THIS WEEK ANYWAY.
THAT MIGHT HELP US FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE FASTEST ROUTE TO HAVE
THIS DONE. I'D BE INTERESTED I'M NOT GOING TO EXERCISE THAT
WITHOUT WANTING TO HEAR BACK FROM COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, IF HE
FEELS THAT IS APPROPRIATE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL JUMP IN BEFORE I GO BACK TO COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. IF THAT PASSES WITH THE AMENDMENT, PER THE CLERK,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AS CHAIR CAN CALL A MEETING ON THIS TOPIC
ANYWAY. SO, YOU HAVE THAT OPTION. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THROUGH YOU TO MY
COLLEAGUE, I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DO ANYTHING. I THINK WE JUST
PASS THIS ORDER AS IS. AND WE'LL BEGIN THE SCHEDULING PROCESS

PAGE 20

May 24, 2021

IMMEDIATELY. AND WE'LL SCHEDULE A MEETING AS SOON AS THAT IS
POSSIBLE ON THE CALENDAR. AND WE'LL WORK WITH THE MANAGER TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE A REPORT AVAILABLE AT THE MEETING AND
THE STAFF WILL BE AT THE MEETING TO SPEAK TO IT. I DON'T THINK WE
NEED TO DO ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN JUST PASSING THIS
ORDER AND SENDING THE PETITION ALONG WITH IT TO THE MANAGER.
THEN WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE AND WE ALL WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I HAD A DIFFERENT SUGGESTION,
WHICH WOULD BE ON THE ORIGINAL POLICY ORDER TO AMEND BY
SUBSTITUTION THE LAST ORDERED... IMPLEMENTING THE SUGGESTIONS AND
REPORT BACK AND REPLACE IT WITH COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S ORDERED, WHICH
ASK FOR A FULL REPORT ON ALL WORK DONE ON THE REDESIGN PROPOSAL
AND ALL FEEDBACK. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR HERE
TONIGHT TO DISCUSS AT THE FUTURE MEETING. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE
TO REPLACE BY SUBSTITUTION THE LAST ORDERED WITH COUNCILLOR
NOLAN'S ORDERED... AND PASS THIS AND MOVE ON AND GET THIS ROLLING.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES, WHAT THAT MEANS, INSTEAD OF STRIKING
THAT RESOLVED, WE KEEP THE RESOLVED AND LAST ORDERED THAT'S THE
WILL OF THE BODY. I THINK IT WILL MOVE US FORWARD. WE NEED THE
FEEDBACK AND RESPECT THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE AND GET THAT
REPORT BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING. THEY WILL SCHEDULE A MEETING. IF
THAT IS VICE MAYOR MALLON'S SUGGESTION, THAT'S WHAT WE CAN VOTE
ON.
>> MR. CLERK: ARE YOU ACCEPTING A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO NOT
DELETE THE RESOLVE PARAGRAPH AND INSTEAD AMEND THE ORDERED
PARAGRAPH AS SHOWN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: FOR CLARITY AND FOR THE RECORD. THE NEW AMENDMENT
WILL NOT DELETE THE EXISTING RESOLVED PARAGRAPH. IT WILL AMEND THE
ORDERED PARAGRAPH TO READ AS IT APPEARS ON SCREEN. ON THAT VOTE...
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: SORRY. POINT OF ORDER. I'M CONFUSED ON
WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON.
>> MR. CLERK: THE AMENDMENT NOW, TO AMEND THE ORDERED
PARAGRAPH, KEEP THE REST OF THE POLICY ORDER THE SAME. TO AMEND
THE ORDERED PARAGRAPH TO READ, THE CITY MANAGER BE AND HEREBY
REQUESTED TO REPORT BACK TO THE COUNCIL ON ALL WORK DONE ON THE
REDESIGN PROPOSAL AND ALL FEEDBACK, INCLUDING THE UNHOUSED
COMMUNITY... (READING FROM THE DOCUMENT). ON THE MOTION:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.

Motion by Councillor Nolan to
amend the ordered paragraph
of Policy Order #4: “That the
City Manager be and herby is
requested to report back to the
full council on all work done on
the redesign proposal and all
feedback from the community
including the unhoused
community in conjunction with
the petition as soon as possible,
and within two weeks”

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.

NUMBER 1). COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANK VICE MAYOR
MALLON FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO WORK
ON IT. WE HAVE GOTTEN EMAILS ABOUT THE CRASHES THAT RESULTED IN
INJURIES WITH PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS. THERE WAS SEVEN INCIDENTS
THIS MONTH ALONE. THEY OFTEN ONLY MAKE THE NEWS AND RARELY IN
THE PUBLIC MIND. EACH OF THEM ARE LIFE CHANGING EVENTS. WHEN I


PAGE 24

May 24, 2021

WAS IN A CRASH THAT INVOLVED A CAR, IT RESULTED IN TWO LOST TEETH,
WHICH WAS HOURS OF REALLY PAINFUL DENTAL WORK AND WITH
INSURANCE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET. THOSE ARE LIFE
CHANGING MOMENTS AND MAKING THEM PUBLIC AND MORE AWARE GOES
ALONG WITH VISION ZERO, WHICH THE COUNCIL ADOPTED AND WILL HELP
TO BRING URGENCY TO THIS IF IT IS NOT JUST THE COUNCIL GETTING THIS
NEWS. GETTING IT OUT IN THE PUBLIC REALM AND I HOPE WE CAN MAKE
THIS PRETTY SOON AND IT SHOULD BE AN EASY TECHNICAL SOLUTION.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY COSPONSOR,
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE PUBLIC
FACING WAY TO REPORT THE CRASH INFORMATION WE SEE IN THE EMAIL SO
THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS. THE POLICE DASHBOARD HAS THIS AND IT IS
DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A WAY TO REPORT THESE
SEPARATELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND PUBLICLY. WE HAD A LOT OF
CONVERSATIONS IN THIS ROOM AND OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM AROUND THE
URGENCY AROUND BUILDING BETTER PROTECTED BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE.
THIS WILL HELP TO PROVIDE THAT DATA AROUND THE FREQUENCY OF THE
CRASHES TO ALL RESIDENTS AS A PART OF THE LARGER CONVERSATION
AROUND THE URGENCY OF PROTECTING THE CYCLISTS ON THE STREETS. I
HOPE OUR COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN US IN ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION TO
BE MADE PUBLIC. AND HOPEFULLY IT CAN BE DONE PRETTY QUICKLY. THANK
YOU, I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS ORDER. I
WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED TO IT AS WELL. I DO AGREE THAT IT MAY BE
USEFUL TO SPEAK OF THESE AS COLLISIONS RATHER THAN ACCIDENTS. IN ALL
OF THE CONVERSATION THAT IS GOING ON AROUND ADDED PROTECTIVE BIKE
LANES, WE AS THE COUNCIL ARE ACCUSED OF GIVING INTO THE DEMAND OF
THE BIKE LOBBY OR TO ONLY LISTEN TO PARTICULAR CONSTITUENCY, THE
REALITY IS THAT WE ARE SEEING THE CRASHES BEING REPORTED. AND THE
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE NOT SO THEY MAY NOT BE FULLY AWARE OF
HOW BIG A PROBLEM THIS IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS HOW WE ADD THIS
PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET
THIS DONE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: A QUESTION TO VICE MAYOR MALLON,
THROUGH YOU. IT ASK FOR CRASH INFORMATION. WILL IT ALSO IS SHE
THINKING THAT THIS DATA WILL INCLUDE PEDESTRIAN CRASHES OR
INCIDENTS THAT INVOLVE PEDESTRIANS?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THROUGH YOU, THE FIRST WHEREAS DOES
REFERENCE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING ACCIDENTS. WE DO SEE THEM IN THE
EMAIL EVERY DAY. THEY ARE BOTH PEDESTRIAN COLLISIONS AND BIKE
COLLISIONS. THAT IS THE SPIRIT AND INTENTION BEHIND THIS POLICY ORDER
AS OUTLINED BY THE FIRST WHEREAS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: VERY GOOD. I MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED IT.

PAGE 25

May 24, 2021

THANK YOU. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU MUTED YOURSELF, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M GLAD I WILL BE ABLE TO
SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, ALTHOUGH IT
DOESN'T MENTION SPECIFICALLY SENIORS, WHICH I THINK IS AN
UNDERSIGHT. I HAVE HEARD THROUGH SO MANY SENIORS AS I WILL SPEAK
TO SHORTLY, WHO HAVE BEEN HURT WHILE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE OUR
STREETS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE COLLECT DATA THAT GIVES US THE FULL
PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING SO EVERYBODY, REGARDLESS OF THE
METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION... WE COLLECT THAT DATA SO WE HAVE A
FULL AND BROAD PICTURE. IN THAT REGARD... I SUPPORT THE ORDER.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER HANDS UP ON THIS. WE CAN
ADD COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN TO IT AND THEN DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADDING COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AS A COSPONSOR?
(ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST. ON ADOPTION OF THE ORDER
AS AMENDED.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.

Zondervan as a cosponsor to

POLICY ORDER #1
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
That the City Manager is
requested to confer with
relevant City departments on
ways to report pedestrian and
cyclist accidents in real time to
residents

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST. AND POLICY ORDER NUMBER
TWO. (READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER 2). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE SENIORS
THAT REACHED OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS AND TO BRING UP
WHAT HAS BEEN MORE THAN AN INCONVENIENCE FOR THEM. IT HAS BEEN
ACTUALLY A REAL HARDSHIP. I KNOW THE ISSUE TOUCHES ON THE BICYCLE
SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE CITY IS PUTTING UP AND THIS IS ONE OF
THE ISSUES THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FRAMING AS HAS TO BE ALL
ONE THING OR THE OTHER.
I REALLY REJECT THAT FRAMING. THE TRUTH IS, YOU CAN BE PRO BICYCLE
SAFETY AND PRO SENIOR AND PRO BICYCLE AND PRO LOCAL BUSINESS. I
REJECT THE IDEA THAT WE CAN'T HAVE CIVIL BALANCE, EVEN NUANCED...
EXCUSE ME. NUANCED DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES AROUND HOW TO KEEP
THE STREETS SAFE FOR EVERYBODY, WHILE PROTECTING SENIORS AND THOSE

PAGE 26

May 24, 2021

WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS. I HAVE BEEN BEAT UP FOR THOSE HIDING
BEHIND SENIORS AND SAY I'M BEING USED BY GRUMPY SENIORS WHO WANT
TO BE LIKE THEY WERE 50 YEARS AGO OR THAT SENIORS JUST EXAGGERATE
CONCERNS OF SOMEONE WHO KNOWS AND SPEAKS WITH SENIORS IN THE
COMMUNITY ALL THE TIME, I FEEL THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE SOMEWHAT
OFFENSIVE AND IGNORANT. I CAN ONLY PRAY THOSE WHO LOBBY THE
ACCUSATIONS ARE BLESSED TO HAVE MOBILITY AND HEALTH INTO THEIR OLD
AGE. IN A WAY, MANY SENIORS EXCUSE ME.
OKAY. IN A WAY, MANY OF THE SENIORS I REGULARLY HEAR FROM HAVE NOT
HAD I'M URGING ALL OF US, NOT JUST ON THIS ONE ISSUE OR JUST THIS
DISCUSSION, LET US STRIVE TO HAVE SOME EMPATHY AND COMPASSION.
AND UNDERSTANDING FOR ALL OUR NEIGHBORS, EVEN WHEN ESPECIALLY
WHEN THEY ARE EXPERIENCES AND VIEWPOINTS DIFFERENT FROM OUR
OWN. I OFTEN SAY, WE NEED TO DO BETTER ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT
THING. AND NOT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING THE WRONG
WAY.
BY FREEZING OUR SENIORS AND THOSE WHO HAVE MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS
ARE THE PLANNING DISCUSSIONS, WE DO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE
THEY DO HAVE SHOULD HAVE SOME INPUT CREATING A CITY WIDE
NETWORK OF BICYCLE SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE THE WRONG WAY BECAUSE
WE DON'T HAVE ALLOWANCES FOR HOW THIS MIGHT IMPACT SOME OF THE
MORE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS.
WE DON'T PLAN ANY MITIGATIONS TO ENSURE WE ARE NOT
UNINTENTIONALLY CREATING HARDSHIPS FOR PEOPLE AND SO WE
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED WHEN HAVING GONE AHEAD WITH SOME OF
WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WE HAVE CREATED HARDSHIPS.
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THE ATTEMPT BEHIND THIS POLICY ORDER AND
WHAT THE ASK IS... THE CITY HAS BEEN ABLE IMMEDIATE SPACES AROUND
AND NEAR MANY WHERE MANY SENIORS LIVE. THE HOME HEALTH AIDES
THAT USE THE PARKING SPACES CAN NO LONGER ACCESS THEIR CLIENTS. I'M
NOT ASKING YOU TO REVERSE COURSE OR RIP UP A BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE
AND PUT METERED PARKING EVERYWHERE. I DID RAISE THIS ISSUE TO THE
CITY MANAGER IN THE DIRECTOR OF PARKING AND TRAFFIC A FEW WEEKS
BACK, THE PARKING ENFORCEMENT WAS STEPPED UP, THE PROBLEM IS NOT
RESOLVED. THIS ASK TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND FIGURE OUT
A VIABLE, LONG TERM SOLUTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SOLUTION IS, I
DO HOPE THAT THE BICYCLE ADVOCATES, SENIORS, AND THOSE WITH
MOBILITY ISSUES AND PEOPLE FROM THE LOCAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY ARE
ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD BECAUSE FOR MORE PEOPLE
IN THE MIX, HELPING TO COME UP WITH THE CITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES
AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE THOUGHTFUL AND DURABLE ARE VERY
IMPORTANT.
MADAM MAYOR, I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN NEXT.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. AND I DO
WANT TO SEND MY BEST WISHES TO MY COLLEAGUE SHE SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS
DEALING WITH SOME ISSUES THERE. I WILL TRY TO SAY THINGS SO SHE
DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY THEM.
I JUST WANT TO FIRST OF ALL, I DO SUPPORT THE ORDER AND I HAVE NO
PROBLEMS WITH ASKING THE MANAGER TO HELP FIND SOLUTIONS. IT SEEMS
TO ME, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR VISITING VISITOR PARKING PERMITS COULD BE
PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF CORRECTIONS.
I BELIEVE THAT THE AREA THAT IS BEING REFERENCED IS ON MT. AUBURN
STREET AND NOT MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. THERE'S NO BIKE FACILITIES
THERE. A BUS LANE WAS ADDED, WHICH LED TO THE REMOVAL OF THE
METERED PARKING.
I THINK IF MY COLLEAGUE AGREES, THEN WE SHOULD AMEND THE ORDER TO
REPLACE MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE WITH MT. AUBURN STREET.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES, I'M SORRY? YES?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE SUGGESTION IS TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN,
YOUR SPECIFIC SUGGESTION IS TO CHANGE BANK STREET? I'M SORRY. YOU
ARE SAYING IT SHOULD BE MT. AUBURN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: MT. AUBURN STREET AND NOT
MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON THE AMENDMENT.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT, AMEND THE FIRST ORDERED
PARAGRAPH TO DELETE MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE AND IN THE PLACE YOU
PLACE MT. AUBURN STREET. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR,
ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED? (ROLL CALL). NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER SIX. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 6). COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. THIS WAS
REQUESTED BY THE MANAGER THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE OF IT. I WANTED TO
INTRODUCE THIS ORDER AND SEE IF WE CAN EXTEND THE PERIOD WHEN THE
SPACE IS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO RECREATE. WHILE THE WEATHER
PERMITS. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT IT AND OPEN TO ADDING
ANY COSPONSORS. IF FOLKS WANT TO ADD TO THE ORDER.

Motion to amend the first
ordered paragraph of Policy
Order #2 to delete
Massachusetts Avenue and
replace with Mt. Auburn

POLICY ORDER #2
ADOPTED AS AMENDED
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to direct
the Director of the Traffic,
Parking, and Transportation
Department that in addition to
stricter parking enforcement in
this area, a viable long-term
strategy must be developed to
mitigate the issues created by
the removal of the metered
parking spaces along
Massachusetts Avenue near
Banks Street to ensure that
those providing home-based
services to seniors in this
neighborhood are fully able to
do so

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO HANDS UP. I THINK WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.

POLICY ORDER #6
ADOPTED
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to confer
with DCR on the possibility of
again extending closures until
at least the final Sunday in
December 2021, if not longer,
weather permitting

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: ABSENT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE ON TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER SEVEN.
(READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER SEVEN). COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. IT IS QUITE TIMELY ACTUALLY
AND WE'LL HEAR MORE LATER. IN THE COMMUNICATION ABOUT OUTCOMES
OF OUR STUDENTS FROM HIGHER EDUCATION, THERE'S A SENTENCE IN
THERE THAT SAYS BUNKER HILL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS WITH THE MOST CPS
ENROLLMENT... SO JUST FROM THE NUMBERS, WE HAD OVER 500 OF OUR
GRADUATES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS ATTEND THESE PUBLIC HIGHER
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE POLICY ORDER
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE SHOULD SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING THE
COMMUNICATION FORWARD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. SURE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU ARE DISCUSSING IT. AND THEN WE CAN DISPOSE
OF IT. COMMUNICATION RECEIVED FROM ME TRANSMITTING INFORMATION
FROM THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING
FORWARD COMMUNICATION NUMBER TWO. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR,
ZERO AGAINST.

Suspend the Rules to bring
forward Communications and
Reports from Other City
Officers #2

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. AS YOU CAN
SEE FROM THE POLICY ORDER, A LOT OF THE STUDENTS END UP TAKING ON A
SIGNIFICANT DEBT BURDEN. AS IS CLEAR FROM THE COMMUNICATION, THE
GRADUATION RATES OF THESE STUDENTS FROM COLLEGE IS NOT GREAT. WE
DON'T SEEM TO HAVE DATA AND THE SUPPORT FROM AFTER 2015. THE 2015
NUMBER THAT REALLY STUCK OUT AT ME IS 50%. A LOT OF THE STUDENTS
TAKING ON DEBT AND THEN MAYBE THEY DON'T GRADUATE. MAYBE THEY


PAGE 29

May 24, 2021

DON'T HAVE THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WERE HOPING FOR THAT
WOULD HELP THEM PAY DOWN THIS DEBT.
IT IS REALLY AN INCREDIBLY UNFAIR AND UNJUST SYSTEM THAT WE ARE
USING THAT PUTS THE BURDEN OF PAYING FOR THEIR EDUCATION ON THE
MOST SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THIS IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT ACT AND SUPPORT THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THESE
STUDENTS WOULDN'T BE BURDENED IN THIS WAY GOING FORWARD. AND AS
WE CAN SEE, THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IS IMPACTING STUDENTS OF COLOR,
WOMEN, AND ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS. I HOPE THAT MY
COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THIS. AND IF PEOPLE ARE WILLING, I'D OFFER TO
HAVE EVERYBODY ADDED AS COSPONSORS TO ADD EXTRA WEIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL ADD EVERYONE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO BE ADDED AS A
COSPONSOR. I WAS GOING TO MENTION IT AND THANK YOU FOR THE
COMMUNICATION THAT YOU PUT IN FROM THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE. THINK
THEY ARE EXTREMELY WELL DONE AND HELPFUL. THIS POLICY ORDER IS
BASICALLY GOING ON RECORD SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT IS AT THE
STATE HOUSE, WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE DO A LOT. I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
DOES IT LEAVE A LITTLE OUT OF OUR HANDS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THE
STATE LEGISLATURE. ONE THING I MENTIONED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
WHICH I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT AND MAYBE SOMETHING SOME OF THE
FEDERAL MONEY WE ARE RECEIVING CAN BE USED FOR, WE HAVE STUDENTS
WHO GRADUATE FROM OUR HIGH SCHOOL WHO HAVE BEEN IN OUR SCHOOL
SYSTEM THEIR ENTIRE ACADEMIC CAREER. AND STILL HAVE TO TAKE
REMEDIAL CLASSES IN COMMUNITY CLASSES BECAUSE THEY DON'T PASS THE
PLACEMENT TEST. THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CLASSES. THEY DON'T GET
CREDIT FOR THE CLASSES AND IT IS ANOTHER BARRIER TO THEM
FORWARDING EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL BARRIER. ONE THING TO PUT OUT
THERE AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS, MAYBE IT IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
WE HAVE A KID FOR 12 OR 13 YEARS AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE A REMEDIAL
CLASS, WE HAVE FAILED THAT KID. MAYBE WE CAN DO SOMETHING ON THE
LOCAL LEVEL, NOT AS BROAD AS PAYING FOR ALL FOUR YEARS OF SCHOOL,
THERE ARE SOMETHING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE SUPPORT OUR
GRADUATES WHO QUITE HONESTLY, WE HAD A KID FOR 12 YEARS, WE FAILED
THEM IF THEY HAVE TO TAKE A REMEDIAL CLASS AT BUNKER HILL. I LIKE TO
PUT THAT OUT THERE AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION TO THINK ABOUT. AND
WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT
MORE. THAT'S A FAILURE ON US AND WE SHOULDN'T PUT THAT FINANCIAL
BURDEN ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I THINK COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S
IDEA IS RIGHT ON TARGET. AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE OWE OUR
STUDENTS. I HAVE SAID BEFORE, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE
PROGRAM WHERE A BENEFACTOR PAID FOR A COLLEGE TUITION IF THE KIDS
AT THE OLD HARRINGTON SCHOOL NO LONGER AROUND GRADUATED. AND
THAT OPPORTUNITY DEFINITELY CHANGED THE LIVES OF MANY OF THE KIDS

PAGE 30

May 24, 2021

IN THAT PROGRAM WHO WERE AT THE TIME TESTING AT THE LOWER END.
SO, THIS NOTION, EVEN IF WE'RE ONLY SUPPORTING IT, AND MAYBE IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY, IT DOES MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. IT
OPENS UP OPPORTUNITIES AND ALLOWS MENTORS TO ENCOURAGE ALL THE
KIDS. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO SUPPLY, THE MENTORS, TO SEEK OUT THE
ADVANTAGES. WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL, GRANTED IT WAS A LONG TIME
AGO, BOTH HARVARD TUITION WAS $4,000. IT JUST SHOCKING AND I
THOUGHT THAT WAS A LOT BACK THEN.
SO, THIS IS TRULY NEGLIGENCE AND I CONGRATULATE THE SPONSORS ON
THIS. AND GLADLY WOULD ADD MY NAME. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. I DEFINITELY
CERTAINLY THE POLICY ORDER I SUPPORT. I'M ALREADY A SPONSOR OF IT.
AND I APPRECIATE THE REPORT THAT YOU BROUGHT FORTH AND AS
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SAID, I APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING US APPRISED. IT
IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE CITY'S OFFERINGS. I WANT TO NOTE AND
HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING YOU SAID, WHICH IS MUCH OF THE COLLEGE
ENROLLMENT DATA, WE HAVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ABOVE THE STATE
IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES. WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. ECONOMIC
DISADVANTAGE, VOCATIONAL, TECHNICAL LEARNERS AND LATINX, I THINK WE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THAT SUCCESS HAPPENS. I HOPE IN THE
FUTURE, THROUGH YOU TO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL COMMITTEE, TO REALLY
SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND TRY TO ASSESS THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. WE
HAVE A LOT OF PARTNERS AND WE KNOW IN THE PAST DID NOT HESITATE
HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF UNDERSTANDING WHICH PARTNERS PROVIDED THE
MOST EFFECTIVE CHANGE. I SAW SOME BREAKOUT FOR A COUPLE OF THE
PROGRAMS, notably BREAK THROUGH, WHICH ARE HIGHER THAN THE
DISTRICT AVERAGE. I THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THE
PROGRAMS, IF WE CAN GET THAT DATA. AND I'D SAY WE STILL HAVE NOT
EVALUATED MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE, INCLUDING
LEVEL UP. I'M ON THE RECORD OF SAYING THERE ARE TROUBLING NOT JUST
ANECDOTES, BUT DATA WE SAW THAT IT DIDN'T FULFILL THE GOALS FOR THE
FIRST FEW YEARS. I HOPE IT IS REVERSED AND I HOPE IT IS TRUE. I LOOK
FORWARD TO FUTURE REPORTS FROM YOU SHOWING THAT IT HAS BEEN
EVALUATED AND REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED.
THE OTHER THING I NOTE, WE REALLY GOOD ON THE ATTAINMENT. IT
SHOWS COLLEGE TO ALSO SHOW IF THERE IS OTHER ATTAINMENT. IF THEY
ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR COLLEGE, MAYBE WENT TO TRADES, MAYBE THEY
HAD ANOTHER PATH NOT JUST TO COLLEGE. IT WOULD BE REALLY
IMPORTANT WE HIGHLIGHT, WE UPLIFT THAT AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS
THE STUDENTS ARE DOING. THAT'S JUST AS MUCH A SUCCESS AS ANYONE
WHO IS ENROLLING IN A TWO OR FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION TO SHARE FROM
THAT MEETING. I CAN PROBABLY GET YOU MORE TO COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN'S POINT AND OTHERS. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN
THE AREA. AND HOW WE HELP OUR STUDENTS, WHETHER IT IS PAYING FOR
THE COURSES OR PAYING FOR TWO OR FOUR YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND

PAGE 31

May 24, 2021

UNIVERSITIES. AS OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE. 100%. I THINK IT WILL GO A
LONG WAY IN SEEING SOME OF OUR STUDENTS ACTUALLY GRADUATE FROM
THESE INSTITUTIONS. THESE A LOT OF ISSUES COMING UP AND THE SCHOOL
COMMITTEE, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DATA AT THE MEETING. AND
THERE'S A LOT OF IT. IT IS TROUBLING AND SOME IS GOOD AND A LOT OF IT
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I'LL KEEP THE COUNCIL UPDATED ON ANY
OF THE FOLLOW UP THAT COMES OUT FROM THIS DISCUSSION.
SO, WE CAN GO AHEAD AND ADD EVERYONE TO THIS POLICY ORDER AND
THEN GO AHEAD AND PLACE THE COMMUNICATION ON FILE AFTER WE ALSO
ADOPT THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADDING THE ENTIRE COUNCIL AS COSPONSORS TO POLICY
ORDER SEVEN. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST. NEXT MOTION

(READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER 8). COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER,
YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. LIKE A LOT OF THE
RESIDENTS, I HAVE TAKEN THE BUS AND BIKED ACROSS THIS BRIDGE MANY
TIMES. THE MOST RECENT TIME I WAS ON IT, I BIKE OVER TO WATCH PART
OF THE BOSTON MARATHON A FEW DAYS AGO. FOLKS MENTIONED, IT IS
REALLY DANGEROUS TO GET ACROSS RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER PIECE I WANT
TO MENTION, IT IS REALLY CRITICAL BUS INFRASTRUCTURE. THE NUMBER
ONE BUS HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST RIDERSHIP AND DELAYS IN THE SYSTEM.
BUS LANES WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE AND HELP COMPLETE THE
NETWORK THAT WE SEEN POP UP AROUND THE PANDEMIC WITH MORE BUS
LANES AND BIKE LANES WE TALK ABOUT IN CAMBRIDGE. IT WOULD BE A BIG
STEP FOR CAMBRIDGE TO CALL ON THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION HERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. AND THANKS
TO MY COSPONSORS. I WANT TO OFFER TO VICE MAYOR MALLON IF SHE
WANTS TO BE ADDED. WE REACHED OUT TO HER AND WERE NOT ABLE TO
