WHEREAS:

The roll out and implementation of separated bike lanes has caused a lot of concern
among the small business community who have felt left out of the process; and

businesses; and

WHEREAS:

Economic studies are often cited from other cities about the impact of bike lanes to
small businesses, and how they will improve sales; and

WHEREAS:

The City will be implementing bike lanes along business corridors each year until 2026
per the recent ordinance change, this provides an opportunity to collect relevant data
and real time experience; and

Having local information will help shape future conversations and implementations of
separated bike lanes and can help inform needed mitigation strategies along
commercial corridors; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Economic
Development division and other appropriate departments with the intention of
conducting a study to collect relevant economic data relating to business impacts from
bike lane installations, positive or negative, which will help inform future installations
of bike lanes along commercial corridors; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with appropriate
departments on what the standard public process will be prior to implementing new
sections of bike lanes consistent with the Cycling Safety Ordinance, and what general

be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on

OVERVIEW
The City of Cambridge conducted an online business and nonprofit
survey from February 7 – February 20, 2023. This survey utilized a
non-probability convenience sample, and the results should be
considered within that context.

Over 80% of respondents work in an organization with few than 20
employees (approximately 57% of all respondents work in an
organization with 5 or fewer employees).

The survey was advertised to the business and nonprofit
community, promoted in City email communications, on the City’s
website, and via social media.

63% of respondents work for an organization located in a
commercial building/space, and 66% of respondents have operated
a business or nonprofit in Cambridge for more than 10 years.

229 business owners or non-profit executives completed the entire
survey. Approximately 71% of the respondents were for-profit
businesses and 20% were nonprofits.

This presentation provides a high-level overview of select questions
from the survey. The full survey is availble for download at

The lack of support for small business. Having thriving small businesses clustered together
helps bring customers to our shop. All along Mass Ave there are too many empty storefronts,
and lack of accessible roads and parking. The new businesses being proposed and moving
into our area are labs and pot shops. Small unique businesses offering goods and services are
being pushed out. The city’s redesign of major roadways is making driving, parking, and
access more difficult. It is making the situation worse and the roads more dangerous.
Programs offered by the city mostly focus on loans that work against small business by
increasing their debt. We need roads that work, and vibrant business sections that attracts
shoppers.

Our customer demographic has always been middle class families, even some low income
families, and I think it has become so expensive to live here that we do not have as large of a
customer base as we used to. My business is located in Central Square, and since the
Pandemic, the Square and the surrounding area has become more fraught with crime. It is
possible that is deterring customers from registering for classes because they are worried
about safety.

The disparity of wealth as the backdrop for liberal politics. I think hands-down the cost of living
(mainly housing cost) combined with the competitive job market is at odds with all of the
wonderful things that Cambridge offers. Why should a family feel blessed for a tiny apartment
in a hi-rise? Why is it expected that some folks would feel "lucky" when that same situation is
clearly not ok for others? (This is partly in response to a recent message sent to a public
listserv from one of the City Councilors.) I think some people are simply working too hard to
get by and others are simply giving up and many people can't afford or don't want to be
bothered to be a part of something that might improve society and community. For years, the
education system has been grooming our kids to accept this notion that they have to be
prepared, they have to be competitive, when in reality, there is not nearly the system in place
to support where they are going and where the "carrot" has been dangled, so to speak...for
them to be on the track to financial independence and a full and healthy life. Community
service and volunteer work, civic-minded activities should all be mandatory but manageable
across the board and otherwise, the governing fiscal bodies and the wealthiest citizens should
be sharing the responsibility to meet the needs of everyone. It has to be so. Otherwise, all
political and humanitarian expressions are only lip service. Internships are outdated. No one

Removal of Street Parking for Bike Lanes seriously threatens the survival of my small
business in an area where parking is already inadequate. As a specialty business who draws
60% of my customers from far and wide, this proposes a major obstacle to the growth and
health of my business.

Our kid is at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. During the past several years, a number of
the high students or alumni passed away. The families did not reveal the causes of the deaths
of their kids due to privacy. If the City of Cambridge educates the community about causes of
the young people's deaths, that would prevent deaths of young residents in the future.

There is no equal and fair support from non profit organizations to all small businesses. Few
non profit organizations help and support their friends and relatives and exclude other
marginalized women of color business owners. Few organizations take business owners' ideas
and create projects by using these women of color business owners' ideas without giving them
credit and without allowing them to be the founder of these projects. Few non profit
organizations don't accept and don't allow me to be a vendor in many events. I was harassed
and manipulated by a few non profit organizations by attending public events in public places
and I was threatened to attend the same event and other events and they spread bad repetition
about my business and later they hacked my business Instagram and they made my
Instagram disappear. I am a homeless, low income and small business woman owner.
Empowering women are for women who already have privilege and have powerful positions.
Empowering women don't include marginalized and low income women like me. How could I
grow my small business when few non profit organizations prevent me from improving? Life
was not created only for you to grow your businesses, I deserve as any human being and
marginalized women of color minority to grow my business. Please, don't give funds to non
profit organizations that help only their friends and relatives but they don't support the
community and they don't help all residents equally.

i think cambridge is number one important city in massachusetts because of 2 important
univercity but the housing and homeless in this city is the biggest issue i saw so many things
as business owner there , one chinese turrist was recording from one group of home less and
explain like please look this is in america look how many homeless people in the street they
bothering us asking for food and money they sleep in the street. and they always come to
store in lunch time and bothering our professional customers. and officers in cambridge said
we have order from judge to do not arrest them bc they do not have a space to keep them and
all homeless people know that things and they do worses things.

I am not sure this is related to Cambridge but foot traffic seems to be down in the area and
there is less interest in our offerings as a result. Fewer people working in the office, so fewer
people around to partake in our yoga classes, etc...

The overall cost of living and operating in Cambridge is very high and climbing, while the job
market for the most part cannot sustain these costs. This in turn affects my and most
businesses, in that people have less disposable income, and because in the case of non-profit
arts organizations like ours, Cambridge-based artists, for the most part, cannot afford to live in
Cambridge, and therefore have the added expenses of traveling into Cambridge to work, while
it hasn't been possible to raise the prices for arts & culture programming for the past 20 years
or more, so likewise, artist pay has only slightly increased all these years, while rents and
other costs of living have doubled (food) to tripled (rent).

The single most important issue facing the City of Cambridge today is the lack of affordable
housing. This issue affects me and my business or nonprofit in a number of ways. First, the
lack of affordable housing makes it difficult for me to attract and retain employees. Many of
my employees are young professionals who are just starting out in their careers and cannot
afford to live in Cambridge. This means that they have to commute from outside of the city,
which can be time consuming and expensive. This can lead to higher turnover rates and lower
morale among my employees. Second, the lack of affordable housing makes it difficult for me
to attract customers. Many of my customers are also young professionals who cannot afford
to live in Cambridge. This means that they are less likely to patronize my business or
nonprofit, as they may not be able to make the commute from outside of the city. Finally, the
lack of affordable housing affects the overall quality of life in Cambridge. As more and more
people are priced out of the city, the diversity of the population decreases, and the city
becomes less vibrant and less attractive to potential customers and employees. The lack of
affordable housing is a major issue facing the City of Cambridge today, and it affects me and
my business or nonprofit in a number of ways. It is essential that the city take steps to
address this issue in order to ensure that Cambridge remains a vibrant and attractive place to
live, work, and do business.

The installation of the bike lanes on Massachusetts Avenue and many other streets, which is
decimating small retail businesses and restaurants and forcing them out of business. With no
places for consumers and customers to park, sales are down 30%-50+% for small retailers
and restaurants, thereby resulting in steep losses for otherwise healthy going concerns.
Restaurants and retailers in Cambridge can not survive on sales generated solely by the few
cyclists who traverse the city streets. Regular out-of-town clients no longer frequent many
Cambridge restaurants and local families, unless they live within a block or two, are not all
biking or taking the T to go out to eat, buy furniture, do other shopping, or use service
establishments. If you have a nail or hair salon, your clients are not going to fight looking for
parking blocks away to get an appointment - they are plenty of salons with available street or
surface parking they can go to. The net result is increasing retail vacancies, leading to fewer
service and retail options for Cambridge residents, lower commercial property values and lower
taxes paid by commercial property owners. This will force the City to raise taxes on residential
owners, making the Cambridge even more expensive for anyone to live.

I would recommend that the city government focus on improving public transportation.
Cambridge is a densely populated city, and many of its residents rely on public transportation
to get around. Unfortunately, the current public transportation system is inadequate and
unreliable. The city government should invest in improving the public transportation system, so
that residents can get to where they need to go quickly and safely.

Prior Studies: Overview
• There are a limited number of published studies that address the
impacts of bike infrastructure on retail sales in North America
• Generally, these compare the “treatment” area against one or more
control areas and citywide trends, plus a before-vs.-after comparison
• Data sources vary by location due to data availability
• Overall, the studies generally show small changes that range from
neutral to slightly positive
• Variations by city, location, and business type (e.g., dining vs. general retail)
• The small size of the impacts can be difficult to separate from broader
economic trends

Prior Studies: Details
• NYC DOT: The Economic Benefits of Sustainable Streets

• Based primarily on city tax filings, plus commercial lease data and city tax
assessments

• City of Toronto: Bloor Street West Bike Lane Pilot Project Evaluation

• Based on transaction data from a point-of-sale terminal provider and surveys
of businesses and pedestrians

• Portland State University: Understanding Economic and Business
Impacts of Street Improvements for Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility

• 14 corridors across 6 cities (Indianapolis, Memphis, Minneapolis, SF, Seattle &
Portland)
• Primary data sources were employment/wage databases including Census
LEHD

Data Availability Issues
• The ideal data source would be actual retail transaction data or the
associated sales tax records
• However…

• Unlike NYC, Cambridge has no truly local sales/retail taxes – even the local option
meals tax is administered by the state
• Mass. DOR is unable to release granular data due to taxpayer privacy and other
concerns
• US point-of-sale terminal providers do not appear willing to share this data, and
the data may not be representative of the market as a whole

Data Availability Issues
• Government products such as Longitudinal Employer-Household
Dynamics (LEHD) and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
(QCEW) can be used at a macro level
• But the more granular, geographically specific data that could be used
to analyze bike project impacts are not publicly available
• Would require a lengthy application and authorization process far beyond the
timeline of this study

• These datasets also focus on employment and wages, which are
indirect and lagging indicators of retail activity

Proposed Data Sources
• Analysis of changes in retail rent levels and occupancy/vacancy,
derived from a subscription database

• Commercial real estate variables provide an indirect measure of retail activity
and were used in the NYC study

• City-wide survey of businesses

• Provides direct estimates of retail impacts, though subject to potential biases
in response patterns

• Additional data sources used for context:

• Pedestrian, bike, and motor vehicle traffic counts
• Parking inventory data
• LEHD data on employment and wages at citywide and Census block levels

Business Survey - Outreach
• City staff will send a mailed invitation letter to all known ground
floor businesses in Cambridge, explaining the purpose of the survey
and providing a link to the online questionnaire – May 2023
• Including the whole city helps with the comparison of project corridors
against controls and to provide data on citywide trends
• Unique survey URLs for each business location will help avoid duplicate
responses
• As a representative sample is important for validity, city staff will conduct
follow-up with non-respondents by email and/or in-person visits
