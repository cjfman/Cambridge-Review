Sustainability

• Eliminate basement
apartments

• Passive House & Enterprise
Green Communities certified

• All units built above 2070
100-year flood plain

• All electric HVAC, gas hot
water (ready for conversion)

• Relocate mechanical
equipment to roofs

• Rooftop solar panels

• Provide storm water
control and infiltration

• Reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by over 50%
(equal to planting 24,000+
trees annually)

• Central AC and operable
windows in all apartments

• Healthy materials

•

Sustainable Design: Avoid
locating critical building
functions in areas that are
at risk of future ﬂooding.
On roofs, exterior walls,
and paved surfaces, use
materials to minimize heat
absorption and localized
heat island eﬀect. Employ
renewable and low-carbon
energy features where
feasible. Select and design
building systems and
equipment within units to
facilitate future conversion
to all-renewable energy
systems. Use materials
with no volatile organic
compound emissions in all
walls, ﬂoorings, ceilings,
furniture, acoustic and
thermal insulation, and
facades exterior applied
products.
