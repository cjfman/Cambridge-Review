PUD-3 AND PUD 3A DISTRICTS: DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
Unless otherwise indicated in this Section 13.40, the following provisions apply equally to
all PUD-3 districts. Where standards or other requirements applicable to development with
the PUD-3 District pursuant to this Section 13.40 conflict with any other provision of the
Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of Section 13.40 shall apply.

13.41

Purpose. The PUD-3 districts are intended to provide for the creation of a high quality
general and technical office environment which permits larger scale development and
supporting commercial activities and which encourages strong linkages between new
development at Kendall Square and along the East Cambridge riverfront. The PUD 3A
District specifically is intended to permit larger scale development along the Binney Street
corridor, consistent with the scale of development permitted in the abutting PUD-3 District,
which also creates large areas of contiguous Public Open Space in the PUD 3A district or
in adjacent PUD Districts in order to create a better transition from neighborhoods to
commercial areas. As required by Section 13.48 and 13.59, any Final Development Plan
for a Development Parcel in a PUD-3A District containing increased density and heights as
described in Sections 13.43.1(2) and 13.44.4 shall minimize noise from rooftop mechanical
equipment; contain environmentally sustainable buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the
sidewalks, an improved pedestrian environment, pedestrian connections to public transit,
and a sense of neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting, lively, and active
presence at street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail, and other uses as part of the
Final Development Plan and by providing attractive exterior through-block connector space;
provide parking which is primarily located underground and is maintained at lower ratios
than customarily required by the Zoning Ordinance, so as to eliminate surface parking lots
and promote public transportation and other parking and traffic demand measures which
will reduce automobile trips; be consistent with the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines
dated October 15, 2001; and preserve certain existing structures which add to the
character of the neighborhood. Any such Final Development Plan encompassing land area
in excess of 10 acres is expected to be constructed over a lengthy period of time of up to 20
years. By meeting these requirements and providing large areas of contiguous Public
Open Space, a Final Development Plan in the PUD 3A district meeting these requirements
will promote the goals of the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and
the public health, safety, and welfare.

13.41.1

Establishment and Scope of Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District.
The PUD-3 District may be divided into Subdistricts as described below for the purpose of
defining requirements that may not apply to the District as a whole. All provisions of the
PUD-3 shall apply equally to each Subdistrict, except as provided for elsewhere in Section
13.40.

Packet Pg. 2

13.41.2

Description of the Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District.

13.41.2.1 The Board Canal Subdistrict is the area bounded by the point in the centerline of Third
Street that is consistent with the point of intersection that the northern sideline of Lot #36
on Assessor’s Map 14 would have with said centerline if said northern sideline were
continued in a straight line to said centerline, then easterly by the northern boundary of said
parcel and the northern boundary of the Broad Canal to the western sideline of Edwin H
Land Boulevard, then running south across the canal and along the eastern sideline of Lot
#23 on Assessor’s Map 13 to the centerline of the MBTA Right of Way, then westerly to a
point in the centerline of the MBTA Right of Way that is consistent with the point of
intersection that the western sideline of Lot #26 on Assessor’s Map 14 would have with
said centerline if said western sideline were continued in a straight line to said centerline,
then north along said western sideline and the western sideline of Lot #36 on Assessor’s
Map 14, then running west along the southern sideline of said Lot #36 to the centerline of
Third Street, then running north along said centerline.

the Planning Board that such use is consistent with the objectives of the Broad Canal
Subdistrict.

13.43

District Dimensional Regulations.

13.43.1

(1) PUD-3 District: The maximum ratio of floor area to the total area of the Development
Parcel shall be 3.0 for Residential Uses, 4.31 a-h, and Dormitory Uses, Section 4.33 b (7),
and 2.0 for all other permitted uses.
A portion or portions of the existing or former Broad Canal without reference to ownership
may be counted in calculating the area of the Development Parcel. Each portion so
counted shall be included in computing the development parcel area for one planned unit
development.
(2) PUD-3A District: The maximum ratio of floor area to total area of the Development
Parcel shall be 1.25 except that the Planning Board may approve a Final Development Plan
with a maximum FAR exceeding 1.25 but not to exceed a maximum FAR of 3.0 where the
Final Development Plan meets the requirements of Section 13.59.
Pursuant to Sections 13.59.4 and 13.59.9, certain building areas may be excluded from
Gross Floor Area for purposes of calculating such FAR.
(3) Broad Canal Subdistrict: Notwithstanding Section 13.43.1(1) above, the Permitted
Gross Floor Area (GFA) in the Board Canal Subdistrict shall be a maximum of one million,
four hundred thousand (1,400,000) square feet of GFA, given the area of the parcel

Packet Pg. 4

exceeds 80,000 square feet.
13.43.1.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance, including the definition of
Gross Floor Area in Article 2.000, the Gross Floor Area of a Performing Arts Center in the
PUD-3 District shall include only publicly accessible, above grade, circulation,
performance, and amenity spaces as measured from the interior face of walls of each
space provided that all other dimensional requirements, limitation on the permitted number
of seats, or other requirements imposed under a PUD-3 District Special Permit, as
amended, have been found by the Planning Board to have been satisfied.
13.43.2

The minimum size of the Development Parcel for a PUD shall be two (2) acres. A
Development Parcel within the PUD-3 may contain noncontiguous lots elsewhere in this
PUD district or within adjacent PUD districts.
A Development Parcel within the PUD-3A District may contain noncontiguous lots
elsewhere in one or more of the PUD-3A District, the PUD-4C District and, solely for the
purpose of including lots to be dedicated to Public Open Space, the PUD-2 District subject
to the provisions of Section 13.59.
There shall be no specified minimum lot size for lots located within a Development Parcel.
Planning Board approval of all proposed lots located within a Development Parcel shall be
required.

13.43.3

For the purpose of computing residential density, the minimum lot size for each dwelling
unit shall be three hundred (300) square feet. Residential density shall be computed
based on the entire Development Parcel.

13.43.4

There shall be no minimum width for the Development Parcel and no minimum width for
lots located within the Development Parcel. There shall be no other minimum required
front, rear and side yard requirements for a Development Parcel or for lots located within
a Development Parcel. The Planning Board shall approve all such building setbacks.
Any buildings on a parcel abutting the Broad Canal should be set back or so designed as
to provide a pedestrian pathway along the canal’s edge.

13.43.4.1 In a PUD-3A District, there shall be a setback of ten (10) feet from the streetline of Binney
Street at and above a point between 78 and 85 feet above grade (the exact location of such
point to be determined by the Planning Board in its review of the Development Proposal
and Final Development Plan). Up to one-third of façade length on a cumulative basis may
be exempted from this requirement.
13.44

Height.

13.44.1

In the PUD-3 District the maximum height of any building shall be two hundred and
thirty (230) feet, except as modified in Section 13.44.2.

13.44.2

In the PUD-3 District the Planning Board shall not approve any Final Development Plan
in which twenty-five (25) percent or more of the land area of the Development Parcel is
covered with such buildings or parts of buildings not exempted by Section
5.23 in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet in height or in which fifteen (15)
percent or more of the land areas of the Development Parcel is covered with such
buildings or parts thereof in excess of two hundred (200) feet in height. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its discretion, may accept for review an application
for a Special Permit based on a Development Proposal which deviates from the aforesaid

Packet Pg. 5

provisions of this Section 13.44.2, provided that the Final Development Plan is in
conformity with such provisions. Except as allowed by Section 13.44.21 below, lower
buildings or building elements are encouraged closer to the Charles River while taller
buildings or building elements are encouraged closer to Kendall Square.
13.44.2.1 In the Broad Canal Subdistrict, no more than one building shall be allowed to exceed two
hundred fifty (250) feet in height. In reviewing a Development Proposal or Final
Development Plan including a building that exceeds two hundred fifty (250) feet in height,
the Planning Board shall give consideration to a building that is designed to be a distinctive
architectural landmark. In no event shall any building having a height in excess of three
hundred fifty (350) feet be permitted.
13.44.3

In the PUD-3 District, in evaluating a Development Proposal providing building height in
excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet, the Planning Board shall give consideration
to evidence presented on the following:
(a) that increased height will not cast shadows or alter air currents in ways that will
unreasonably limit the amount of light and air reaching other buildings in the vicinity
to a significantly greater extent that if the building height did not exceed one hundred
and twenty (120) feet;
(b) that increased height would mitigate detrimental environmental impacts such as
excessive ground coverage, diminution of open space, and monotonous
development;
(c) that increased height would not adversely affect and would result in increased
sensitivity to the visual and physical characteristic of the particular location through
more harmonious relationships to the terrain and to the proposed and existing
buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationships to the proposed
building;
(d) that increased height would result from actions taken to lessen the impact of traffic and
parking on the surrounding area; and
(e) that the orientation and location of the proposed structure would not otherwise
diminish the health and safety of the area around the development parcel.

13.44.4

In the PUD-3A District, the maximum height of any building shall be one hundred twenty
(120) feet, except that the Planning Board may approve a Final Development Plan with a
building height within the PUD-3A District of one hundred forty (140) feet subject to the
requirements of Section 13.59.

13.45

Open Space. The minimum ratio of open space to the total area of the Development
Parcel as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 shall be fifteen (15) percent except as
modified below.

13.45.1

As part of a Special Permit for a PUD, the Planning Board may reduce the open space
requirement if the development is located adjacent to a Public Open Space and if the
development is physically and functionally integrated with the Public Open Space by
means of building orientation, location of building entrances, pedestrian linkages between
major activity centers, or similar factors, or if the development provides for contiguous
Public Open Space as described in Section 13.59.

Packet Pg. 6

13.45.2

Open space shall include parks, plazas, landscaped areas open to the sky, playgrounds,
balconies, roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage, and pedestrian ways such
as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified by the Planning Board.

13.46

Perimeter and transition. Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an existing
street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and harmonize with
adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, height, landscaping, and
screening. Development in the PUD-3 districts should provide integrated pedestrian
circulation systems, particularly strong linkages between the riverfront and Kendall Square.
Development in the PUD-3A District should enhance the pedestrian experience along
Binney Street. See Section 13.59.3

13.47

Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the PUD-3 district shall conform to
the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as
modified by this Section 13.47. In the PUD-3A district these provisions shall be further
modified by Section 13.59 for any development subject to the provisions of Section 13.59.

13.47.1

Off street parking facilities shall be provided as follows:

13.47.2

(1)

Notwithstanding Sections 13.47.1 and 13.47.2, development in the Broad Canal Subdistrict
shall conform to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000,
except as modified by this Section 13.47.3 as follows:
(1) Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a PUD in the Broad Canal
Subdistrict shall be limited by applying the rates set forth below to each use within the
PUD and taking the summation of the result for all uses. Exceeding the maximum
allowed parking shall require a waiver from the Planning Board of maximum parking
required under the general provisions of Article 6.000.
(2) Maximum of 0.9 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area for office uses,
excluding technical office (Section 4.34(a-e)).
(3) Maximum of 0.8 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area for laboratory use

(6) Maximum of 1 space per 4 sleeping rooms for hotel use (Section 4.31(i)(2)).
13.47.4

The parking requirements of this Section 13.47, and as modified in Section 13.59 for
development subject to the provisions of Section 13.59, may be satisfied anywhere on the
Development Parcel, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Article 6.000.

13.47.5

The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan in the Broad Canal
Subdistrict for a Development Parcel, may waive any requirements for the amount, location
and design of parking or loading facilities within a Development Parcel, and may permit
loading facilities to be shared across various uses and lots within the PUD-3 District.

13.48

Where indicated in this Section 13.40, the provisions of Section 13.59 shall apply
equally in the PUD-3A District. The Planning Board shall include in any Special
Permit conditions that require ongoing compliance with any and all applicable
provisions of Section 13.59.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Packet Pg. 9

February 24, 2021
To the Honorable, the City Council,
On behalf of RREEF AMERICA REIT II CORP, PPP, owner of One and 101 Main Street, we respectfully submit
to the City Council a petition to amend Section 13.4 of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to create
the “Broad Canal Subdistrict” within the PUD-3 District. The purpose of this letter is to provide an overview
of the proposed revisions to the PUD-3 Zoning contained within the petition, and to introduce the petition
and supporting exhibits.
Project Description
One and 101 Main Street were originally permitted as PUD Special Permit #1 in 1985, prior to Kendall
Square’s extraordinary transformation evident today. Although the building and its immediate environs
have been well maintained over the last 35 years, the ground floor experience and access to the Broad
Canal provide for poor pedestrian and other connections and fail to activate this unique area. This is
evidenced by the retail along Main Street, which is currently partially hidden under an arcade. However,
under the proposed petition, the space will be expanded out to the street wall improving connectivity
visibility and the pedestrian experience. Similarly, the building currently turns its back on the Broad Canal,
but the proposal will reinvigorate this underutilized local amenity (see Exhibit E).
The petition will allow for the construction of up to 582,000 additional square feet in the form of an infill
building between the two existing buildings and the expanded retail space, which in turn will facilitate
greater activation of the ground floor and the public realm along Main Street and the Broad Canal. In fact,
an exciting piece of the zoning petition is to incorporate a series of Canal Uses to transform the canal into
a destination for residents and visitors alike.
Zoning Petition
This zoning petition seeks to improve the gateway of Cambridge in a manner commensurate with recent
petitions in the immediate surroundings (see Exhibit B). The petition has been drafted to be in line with
recent zoning amendment approvals in the area, including MIT (PUD-5), PUD-MXD, Volpe (PUD-7),
Cambridgeside Galleria (PUD-8), and BioMed Realty (PUD-CDK). Therefore, we believe the petition is
appropriate in scope and presents a balance of proposed development and substantial improvements and
mitigation measures.
District Boundaries
The petition creates a subdistrict within PUD-3 called the “Broad Canal Subdistrict” that is essentially
comprised of the area within PUD-3 that is not the Veolia power station and is not within the proposed
PUD-CDK district. More specifically, the Broad Canal Subdistrict includes Lot 36, Map 14 and Lot 23, Map
13 and the portions of public ways abutting those parcels.

Packet Pg. 10

a

Uses
All existing uses remain unchanged, but the petition adds Institutional Uses such as Clinic Uses (Section
4.33(d)) and Canal Uses that are required or intended to have direct access to the Broad Canal. Such uses
may include but are not limited to floating restaurants, open air places of entertainment, kayak or similar
rentals and launch, marinas, public walkways, facilities for fishing, and waterborne transportation
facilities.
Gross Floor Area
The total gross floor area of the Broad Canal District shall not exceed 1.4 million square feet. Currently,
there is approximately 818,000 square feet developed, so the maximum potential for future development
is 582,000 square feet. The formatting of this section and intended density is comparable to the language
in the Volpe (PUD-7) zoning.
Height
Within the Broad Canal Subdistrict, only one building may exceed 250 feet in height. Such a building may
be designed to be a distinctive architectural landmark given its location at the gateway to Cambridge and
shall not exceed 350 feet. The formatting of this section is also comparable to the language of the Volpe
(PUD-7) zoning. Exhibit C includes a series of maps depicting existing and proposed building heights in the
immediate Kendall Square area. Although we have not designed a proposed building, Exhibit D illustrates
what one would potentially look like in relation to the two existing buildings.
Parking and Loading
Instead of parking minimums, the petition for the proposed subdistrict includes parking maximums that
are comparable to the MIT (PUD-5) zoning and the Volpe (PUD-7) zoning. This is in line with the City’s
efforts to reduce parking and encourage non-vehicular travel. Given that the proposed subdistrict is within
walking distance to the Kendall Red Line station and the Lechmere Green Line station and near bicycling
and pedestrian pathways, we agree such maximums are appropriate.
Lastly, the petition includes language that allows the Planning Board to waive requirements for the
amount, location, and design of parking or loading facilities within the subdistrict and may permit shared
loading. This is comparable to the Volpe (PUD-7) zoning.
Public Outreach
From the beginning, public engagement has been a priority while drafting this zoning petition. Over the
course of the last year, we have met with Community Development Department (CDD) staff, individual
Councilors, local neighborhood groups like the East Cambridge Planning Team, and the public to solicit
feedback and gather input on potential improvements to this area of Cambridge (see Exhibit F). Prior to
the pandemic, these interactions were in person, but during the last ten months we have utilized the
coUrbanize platform to communicate and interact with the public to the greatest extent possible. We
have included a summary of these efforts, via coUrbanize reports, in Exhibit G.
Based on this information, we have tailored our petition so that we are requesting no more than is
necessary while ensuring the proposed benefits align with what the community actually wants. We will
continue to engage with the public throughout the permitting process and will be responsive to feedback.

Benefits of Petition
Throughout the public engagement process, we have compiled a list of benefits for the local community
and City as a result of this petition. While there are the financial benefits typical of a proposal of this scope,
we are particularly interested in those features that will contribute to a truly well-rounded and engaging
environment. The following are potential items that will improve the historic, environmental, and social
facets of this part of Cambridge:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Activation of the ground floor along Main Street and the Broad Canal, including a cut-through
connecting the two
Ground floor uses that complement existing amenities and attract residents of all demographics
Floating restaurant in the Broad Canal
Establishment of a “Cambridge Historical Trail” similar to the Freedom Trail in Boston
Broad Canal restoration and maintenance
Pedestrian and traffic safety improvements
Environmentally friendly initiatives tailored to the subdistrict
Tightening parking on-site to incentivize transit, bicycling, and walking as primary modes of
commuting
Upgrades to Poor Man’s Landing in the Charles River
Restoration of the DCR Boathouse (old MDC Boathouse) near the Museum of Science

Conclusion
The result of this zoning petition will be a striking new building bookended by existing buildings and
anchored by a convivial public realm along Main Street and the Broad Canal. We believe such a result
would be illustrative of Kendall Square’s current eminence and its nascent origins, respectively. We look
forward to working with the City Council, the Ordinance Committee, and the Planning Board to continue
to advance the Broad Canal Subdistrict Zoning Petition.
Sincerely,
Beals Associates, Inc.

PUD-3 AND PUD 3A DISTRICTS: DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
Unless otherwise indicated in this Section 13.40, the following provisions apply equally
to all PUD-3 districts. Where standards or other requirements applicable to
development with the PUD-3 District pursuant to this Section 13.40 conflict with any
other provision of the Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of Section 13.40 shall apply.

13.41

Purpose. The PUD-3 districts are intended to provide for the creation of a high quality
general and technical office environment which permits larger scale development and
supporting commercial activities and which encourages strong linkages between new
development at Kendall Square and along the East Cambridge riverfront. The PUD
3A District specifically is intended to permit larger scale development along the Binney
Street corridor, consistent with the scale of development permitted in the abutting
PUD-3 District, which also creates large areas of contiguous Public Open Space in the
PUD 3A district or in adjacent PUD Districts in order to create a better transition from
neighborhoods to commercial areas. As required by Section 13.48 and 13.59, any
Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel in a PUD-3A District containing
increased density and heights as described in Sections 13.43.1(2) and 13.44.4 shall
minimize noise from rooftop mechanical equipment; contain environmentally
sustainable buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the sidewalks, an improved
pedestrian environment, pedestrian connections to public transit, and a sense of
neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting, lively, and active presence at
street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail, and other uses as part of the Final
Development Plan and by providing attractive exterior through-block connector space;
provide parking which is primarily located underground and is maintained at lower
ratios than customarily required by the Zoning Ordinance, so as to eliminate surface
parking lots and promote public transportation and other parking and traffic demand
measures which will reduce automobile trips; be consistent with the Eastern
Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; and preserve certain existing
structures which add to the character of the neighborhood. Any such Final
Development Plan encompassing land area in excess of 10 acres is expected to be
constructed over a lengthy period of time of up to 20 years. By meeting these
requirements and providing large areas of contiguous Public Open Space, a Final
Development Plan in the PUD 3A district meeting these requirements will promote the
goals of the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and the public
health, safety, and welfare.

13.41.1

Establishment and Scope of Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District.
The PUD-3 District may be divided into Subdistricts as described below for the
purpose of defining requirements that may not apply to the District as a whole. All
provisions of the PUD-3 shall apply equally to each Subdistrict, except as provided for
elsewhere in Section 13.40.

13.41.2

Description of the Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District.

PUD-3 AND PUD 3A DISTRICTS: DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
Unless otherwise indicated in this Section 13.40, the following provisions apply equally
to all PUD-3 districts. Where standards or other requirements applicable to
development with the PUD-3 District pursuant to this Section 13.40 conflict with any
other provision of the Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of Section 13.40 shall apply.

13.41

Purpose. The PUD-3 districts are intended to provide for the creation of a high quality
general and technical office environment which permits larger scale development and
supporting commercial activities and which encourages strong linkages between new
development at Kendall Square and along the East Cambridge riverfront. The PUD
3A District specifically is intended to permit larger scale development along the Binney
Street corridor, consistent with the scale of development permitted in the abutting
PUD-3 District, which also creates large areas of contiguous Public Open Space in the
PUD 3A district or in adjacent PUD Districts in order to create a better transition from
neighborhoods to commercial areas. As required by Section 13.48 and 13.59, any
Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel in a PUD-3A District containing
increased density and heights as described in Sections 13.43.1(2) and 13.44.4 shall
minimize noise from rooftop mechanical equipment; contain environmentally
sustainable buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the sidewalks, an improved
pedestrian environment, pedestrian connections to public transit, and a sense of
neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting, lively, and active presence at
street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail, and other uses as part of the Final
Development Plan and by providing attractive exterior through-block connector space;
provide parking which is primarily located underground and is maintained at lower
ratios than customarily required by the Zoning Ordinance, so as to eliminate surface
parking lots and promote public transportation and other parking and traffic demand
measures which will reduce automobile trips; be consistent with the Eastern
Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; and preserve certain existing
structures which add to the character of the neighborhood. Any such Final
Development Plan encompassing land area in excess of 10 acres is expected to be
constructed over a lengthy period of time of up to 20 years. By meeting these
requirements and providing large areas of contiguous Public Open Space, a Final
Development Plan in the PUD 3A district meeting these requirements will promote the
goals of the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and the public
health, safety, and welfare.

13.41.1

Establishment and Scope of Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District.
The PUD-3 District may be divided into Subdistricts as described below for the
purpose of defining requirements that may not apply to the District as a whole. All
provisions of the PUD-3 shall apply equally to each Subdistrict, except as provided for
elsewhere in Section 13.40.

thirty (230) feet, except as modified in Section 13.44.2.

13.44.2

In the PUD-3 District the Planning Board shall not approve any Final Development
Plan in which twenty-five (25) percent or more of the land area of the Development
Parcel is covered with such buildings or parts of buildings not exempted by Section
5.23 in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet in height or in which fifteen (15)
percent or more of the land areas of the Development Parcel is covered with such
buildings or parts thereof in excess of two hundred (200) feet in height.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its discretion, may accept for
review an application for a Special Permit based on a Development Proposal which
deviates from the aforesaid provisions of this Section 13.44.2, provided that the Final
Development Plan is in conformity with such provisions. Lower Except as allowed by
Section 13.44.21 below, lower buildings or building elements are encouraged closer
to the Charles River while taller buildings or building elements are encouraged closer
to Kendall Square.

13.44.2.1 In the Broad Canal Subdistrict, no more than one building shall be allowed to exceed
two hundred fifty (250) feet in height. In reviewing a Development Proposal or Final
Development Plan including a building that exceeds two hundred fifty (250) feet in
height, the Planning Board shall give consideration to a building that is designed to be
a distinctive architectural landmark. In no event shall any building having a height in
excess of three hundred fifty (350) feet be permitted.
13.44.3

In the PUD-3 District, in evaluating a Development Proposal providing building height
in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet, the Planning Board shall give
consideration to evidence presented on the following:
(a) that increased height will not cast shadows or alter air currents in ways that will
unreasonably limit the amount of light and air reaching other buildings in the
vicinity to a significantly greater extent that if the building height did not exceed
one hundred and twenty (120) feet;
(b) that increased height would mitigate detrimental environmental impacts such as
excessive ground coverage, diminution of open space, and monotonous
development;
(c) that increased height would not adversely affect and would result in increased
sensitivity to the visual and physical characteristic of the particular location
through more harmonious relationships to the terrain and to the proposed and
existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationships to the

(d) that increased height would result from actions taken to lessen the impact of traffic
and parking on the surrounding area; and
(e) that the orientation and location of the proposed structure would not otherwise
diminish the health and safety of the area around the development parcel.

13.44.4

In the PUD-3A District, the maximum height of any building shall be one hundred
twenty (120) feet, except that the Planning Board may approve a Final Development
Plan with a building height within the PUD-3A District of one hundred forty (140) feet
subject to the requirements of Section 13.59.

Open Space. The minimum ratio of open space to the total area of the Development
Parcel as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 shall be fifteen (15) percent except
as modified below.

13.45.1

The As part of a Special Permit for a PUD, the Planning Board may reduce the open
space requirement if the development is located adjacent to a Public Open Space
and if the development is physically and functionally integrated with the Public Open
Space by means of building orientation, location of building entrances, pedestrian
linkages between major activity centers, or similar factors, or if the development
provides for contiguous Public Open Space as described in Section 13.59.

13.45.2

Open space shall include parks, plazas, landscaped areas open to the sky,
playgrounds, balconies, roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage, and
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified
by the Planning Board.

Perimeter and transition. Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk,
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-3 districts should
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages between
the riverfront and Kendall Square. Development in the PUD-3A District should
enhance the pedestrian experience along Binney Street. See Section 13.59.3

13.47

Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the PUD-3 district shall conform
to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except

4A and PUD-4B districts shall be generally consistent with the policy objectives set
forth in the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and the guidance
provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001 and
with the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated October 15, 2001. The PUD-4A and
4B districts specifically are intended to encourage a mix of uses with a substantial
component of housing, with the housing, where possible, located within the
development parcel adjacent to the existing residential neighborhood. In the PUD-4A
District reuse of existing historic industrial structures for mixed residential, retail and
office uses is encouraged. It is the intent of these Districts to encourage an active
urban setting around the Lechmere Canal and along public and private streets both
during and after customary business hours. Ground floor building spaces oriented
toward the Lechmere Canal and public streets should primarily contain retail or
consumer service office uses to the extent possible. Extensive ground level building
frontage along the Lechmere Canal developed to institutional or office uses is not
encouraged.
Purpose. The PUD-4C District is intended to provide for the creation of quality
development that enhances the pedestrian experience along Binney Street, creates a
transition between commercial development along the Binney Street corridor and
residential neighborhoods to the north, and creates large areas of contiguous Public
Open Space in the PUD-4C District or in adjacent PUD Districts. As required by
Section 13.59, any Final Development Plan in a PUD-4C District containing increased
density and heights as described in Sections 13.53.1(4) and 13.54.4 shall minimize
noise from rooftop mechanical equipment; contain environmentally sustainable
buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the sidewalks and pedestrian connections to
public transit, and a sense of neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting,
lively and active presence at street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail and

Volpe just presented their plan for their parcel last night to the Planning Board. Their
plan included a pedestrian, multimodal promenade along the length of Broad Canal Way
just across Third Street. It would be great to seamlessly connect this to your Broad
Canal Way plans be raising the street and creating a similar pedestrian, multimodal
promenade closed mainly to cars/trucks. Access for deliveries can be granted or can
use the connection to Broad Canal Way from Main St.

Thinking about community benefits, access to this project and the example of the broad
canal bridge, it would be a great benefit to the community and to access to this project
to add a cantilevered or similar style bridge as the broad canal one over behind the
Museum of Science. This would help connect the entire river front and provide access

The existing kayak rental, Paddle Boston, would be greatly enhanced by an indoor
office/restrooms, changing areas, lockers. Look at the Community Boating facility in
Boston. As part of Chapter 91 you should incorporate a facility to enable even more use
of the Broad canal. Check with PaddleBoston -- Kendall Sq. is busiest operation. ALSO,
Broad Canal is filthy after a rain event-- something needs to be done about storm water
outfall.

joseph rose
Oct 8, 2020

Given the limited information presented, here are some initial comments: 1) Housing
should be include on site. This project is in the heart of Kendall Square and should
promote non-transit housing 2) Historic Preservation for the Broad Canal is
underwhelming. The canal is mostly fine and perhaps efforts should be made to provide
more connections along the Charles. There is talk about a similar boardwalk being
necessary behind the Museum of Science to connect the Charles 3) Project increases
parcel size about 50% without any real justification 4) Given the Broad Canal Road is
part of PUD, consider closing road to cars or use as a shared street to provide a plaza
between two sides of the street. Similar work has been done in Harvard square. 5)
Curious how no new parking will be required to accommodate such a large upsizing. 6)
Open space should not be “enhanced”, it should be increased. 7) Connectivity. North
South connectivity would be best served with open air, wide corridors, not internal
atrium.

In light of climate change, anything less than an all-electric, fossil-fuel free building is
not consistent with the science. Please build it net-zero ready by making it all electric so
that it will be easier to transition to full net zero over time. I'm very concerned about the
lack of housing; a housing trust contribution is great, but there are still many hurdles in
the way of putting that money to work. What other assistance could you offer? For
example, what if you actually bought land in Cambridge or nearby and donated that for
100% affordable housing construction? Lastly, whatever you do, please plant lots of
trees!

I don't share the vision of the canal as an important draw for the activities outlined in the
proposal. The Main St side has never been highly used, despite the two office buildings
right there. The area is almost always in the shade, and the canal can smell like one,
especially in the summer. Right across you have the steam plant, which while attractive
in some esoteric ways, is certainly not to the general public. The plant also at times
emits large amounts of noise. In addition, the waterway is in fact quite small, and I can't
see it as a big draw in the summer. The proposed amenities do not justify a zoning
change to allow yet more office space.

I share this opinion that the proposed amenities as they are do not justify a

Sally- I agree that the area definitely needs more retail. By that I don't mean more
banks, cell phone stores, and chain coffee shops. In terms of housing the CRA
just released their annual Kendall Square Annual Transportation Report and it
glaringly shows a lack of people living and working in the area. Large numbers of
people travel by car etc to the area. It would be much better to have more
housing to reduce traffic, etc and provide a sense of community.

Bjorn Poonen

With every zoning amendment to add housing in Kendall Square in recent years,
a much greater amount of commercial floor area has been added. The result is
that many more people are going to need to commute into Kendall Square in the
next few years, straining the transportation system. From this point of view, the
idea to create more commercial development here and to make a payment for
housing elsewhere makes no sense and is actually harmful.

Trees for sure. Also the part of Kendall street that sweeps around (running North) in
front of Genzyme could stand to be narrowed (it's a single lane anyway), and the
sidewalks on both sides could include parking/dropoff PLUS landscaping. The idea
there would be to consider of the sidewalk as a PATH THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE
(rather than "a sidewalk with trees as an afterthought"), so you could - visually and
conceptually - landscape the entire area FIRST, THEN add a path and cut-throughs as
needed.

This is way too massive. There should be space for pedestrians, runners, and bicycles
along this canal area to take in the canal. Where is the engagement with the
community? Where is any sense of openness? Also the ground floor facade of the
building looks one massive largely opaque wall; ground floors out-facing walls on the
public way should be areas with visual interest to people walking by - transparent
windows for people to get a sense of the vitality of the area - and doors leading small
businesses, places for coffee, music, drinks). This building looks sterile, confrontational
and anti-neighborhood to an extreme.

While Cambridge favors permanent, dominant playgrounds, I would hope the city would
opt for something like a splash pad or something cheap and flexible like a ropes course
(example: https://www.instagram.com/parkup.tw/) that everyone could enjoy. The
current playgrounds favor small children and do little to inspire wonder. I don't think the
city has given children enough credit for running around, and I hope if a permanent
playground is included that it will be much smaller than the ones that take up all of the
open space in mid-Cambridge.

VOLPE DESIGN GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE
Built Form
■

Create rich and varied, humanly scaled building with continuous ground level pedestrian realm

■

Create strong streetwalls to frame streets, parks, squares, and plazas

■

Mitigate building bulk to minimize adverse impacts on the microclimate, including shadows, wind, and urban heat island effects

■

Make positive contributions to the Cambridge skyline and important views

■

Look for opportunities to enrich urban pattern by breaking or modulating it by responding to elements of adjoining buildings, spatial
axes, views, significant corners, etc., or to elements of the building’s own structure or program

■

Differentiate massing and materials, color, fenestration, bay patterns, etc.

■

Design four integrated zones: pedestrian frontage zone, streetwall, tower, and building top

Pedestrian Frontage Zone
■

Accommodate access needs of all users, and incorporate ’visitability’ measures where possible

■

Ground floor level flush with or easily accessible from sidewalks and readily convertible to retail storefronts

■

Break up the scale of the pedestrian frontage zone, create variation in façade treatment at an intimate scale, distinguish from
streetwall & tower

■

Second-floor façade should be visually connected with ground floor façade, differentiated from Streetwall Zone above by its desi gn,
or serve as a mediating element linking the ground floor and the streetwall zone

■

Building facades should maximize the visibility of ground floors containing retail, restaurant, and limited office space

■

Where appropriate, retail awnings should be provided to offer an active, vital marketplace image, while protecting pedestrians

Attachment: Broad Canal Subdistrict Ordinance Committee Presentation (COM 227 #2021

a

Packet Pg. 124

VOLPE DESIGN GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE
Streetwall Zone
■

Streetwall facades should use rhythmic patterns, carefully considered bay dimensions,detail, proportion, color, materials, and other
architectural elements to create a coherent and visually rich pedestrian experience

■

The streetwall should be warm and inviting, and should include a variety of materials

Building Towers
■

Articulate tall buildings to avoid a monolithic appearance, and emphasize slender, vertically-oriented proportions. Changes in plane,
material, fenestration pattern, color, etc. may be used to break up the bulk of building towers. Consider:
–

Emphasizing corners using taller elements such as towers, turrets, and bays.

–

Using at least two distinct finish materials and colors on each building.

–

Variation in forms to present different profiles to different vantage points.

Building Tops
■

The penthouse design and materials should be of equivalent quality to the rest of the building and enhance the overall buildi ng
design.

■

All mechanical penthouses and other projections should be architecturally integrated within the overall form and individual
elevations of the building. The penthouse should enhance, not detract from, the overall building appearance and balance.

Attachment: Broad Canal Subdistrict Ordinance Committee Presentation (COM 227 #2021

a

Packet Pg. 125

VOLPE DESIGN GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE
Building Massing
■

Pedestrian frontages should align on the build-to line, with exceptions for recessed retail or other entrances and shopfronts.

■

Streetwalls should align to the build-to line for 80% or more of the façade width.

■

A taller streetwall may be appropriate on Broadway and Third Street and on wide streets

■

In some cases, the direct extension of the tower’s verticality through the streetwall to the ground plane may enhance the sen se of
place by creating a point of strong vertical emphasis.

■

Reinforce distinction between building’s streetwall and tower by the use of contrasting strategies of homogeneity and heterogeneity.
Vary the design, scale, color, materials, massing, fenestration, etc. across the width of the streetwall or tower as vertical zones.

■

Floorplates of the upper portions of tall buildings should be limited to create slender towers... Adequate separation should be
maintained between tall buildings above the streetwall to allow for views of the sky.

Community Spaces
■

Community spaces should have their own distinct visual identities. Their main entrances should be directly accessible from streets
and other public open spaces.

Energy Performance and Embodied Energy
■

Avoid excessive use of glass both for its poor thermal performance and high embodied energy.

■

Incorporate passive design strategies such as building orientation, external shading, operable windows, and other approaches for
natural ventilation/cooling.

■

Maximize the thermal performance of building envelopes, such as use of thermal mass, high performance insulation, etc.

■

Design roofs to be “solar ready,” employ green roofs where possible, otherwise use high-albedo “white roofs”.
