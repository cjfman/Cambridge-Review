Incentive Zoning Rate Increase Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

The Petition proposes to amend the Incentive Zoning provision in the Zoning Ordinance by increasing
the Housing Contribution Rate from the current rate of $21.02 per square foot to $33.34. The Petition
does not propose any substantive changes to Incentive Zoning provisions beyond the rate increase.
Incentive Zoning in Cambridge
The City of Cambridge first established an Incentive Zoning Ordinance (IZO) in 1988. The purpose of the
zoning is to meet the City’s goal of providing a full range of housing choices by mitigating the impacts of
non-residential development on the need for housing that is affordable to low-, moderate-, and middleincome households. As such, the zoning requires developers to make a financial contribution to mitigate
the impact of new office, research and development, and retail space on housing demand from low-,
moderate-, and middle-income workers in these buildings who will need housing that is affordable to
them.
In 2015, the City Council amended the IZO to expand its application to most non-residential
development projects over 30,000 square feet, increase the housing contribution level, and clarify that
an annual inflation adjustment of the contribution rate would be made based on the Consumer Price
Index (CPI). This amendment also added a provision to allow for the City to review and update its
housing contribution levels every three years through a nexus study. The study quantifies the impact of
future non-residential development on the demand for affordable low-, moderate-, and middle-income
housing in Cambridge and recommends any necessary changes to the housing contribution rate to
mitigate these impacts.
Currently, the Incentive Zoning provisions apply to new development that consists of at least 30,000
square feet of Gross Floor Area devoted to non-residential uses, including hotels, offices and
laboratories, retail establishments, industrial uses, college/university uses, health care facilities, social
service facilities, and noncommercial research facilities. “New development” includes the construction
of new buildings or additions to existing buildings, the substantial rehabilitation of existing buildings,
and a change in use from an exempt use to a non-exempt use.
Incentive Zoning Funds
Financial contributions generated by Incentive Zoning are made to the Affordable Housing Trust (“the
Trust”). Housing Contributions are calculated when a building permit is issued and made when
developments are completed. The below chart shows the amount of money that the Trust has received
from Incentive Zoning Housing Contributions per fiscal year in millions of dollars:

Summary of Petition

a

This chart shows that the amount of funding generated by Housing Contributions increased significantly
after the 2015 Incentive Zoning amendments took effect. The first development subject to the revised
Incentive Zoning provisions was completed in FY19, and the total amount of Housing Contributions
made since that time are now $44,366,047. This compares to the $6,426,630 which was received in
Housing Contributions under the provisions prior to the 2015 amendment. Since initial adoption, the
Incentive Zoning provisions have generated $50,792,677 in Housing Contributions.
2019 Nexus Study
The most recent Incentive Zoning nexus study was prepared by Karl F. Seidman Consulting Services in
December 2019. The study calculates what is called a “maximum determined rate” by determining the
amount of money that would be needed to subsidize the creation of affordable housing needed to meet
the demand for housing among low-, moderate-, and middle-income workers created by the amount of
new development projected in the city over the next 10 years. The analysis found that the rate to fully
cover the City's share would be $33.34 per square foot of new development.
The study did not recommend adopting the maximum determined housing contribution rate because it
would be far higher than similar rates in Boston and Somerville, and significantly increasing
development costs and rents would risk the city's regional competitiveness. Housing is a regional issue,
and if more development moves to neighboring communities, Cambridge would still experience housing
demand without the benefit of the financial mitigation to address that demand. The study also noted
that increased development costs are passed on to tenants, meaning increased rents for businesses. The
study authors write, “A recommended increase in the contribution rate involves balancing public policy
goals and considering both the needs to address increased demand for affordable housing and the
potential impacts of an increased rate on the city's future development.”

Incentive Zoning Rate Increase Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

a

The study recommended increasing the housing contribution rate by $6 over four years, with an initial
increase of $2 followed by annual $1 increases. This would have entailed increasing the then-current
rate of $17.10 to $19.10 in 2020 followed by $1 increases in 2021, 2022, and 2023. The study also
recommended continuing with the current practice of adjusting the rate annually to account for
increases to the CPI. The study concluded that the $6 increase combined with the annual CPI
adjustments would bring the housing contribution rate close to the midpoint between the current rate
and the maximum determined rate over the next several years without sacrificing Cambridge’s
competitiveness in a regional real estate development market.
Following the last nexus study, in January 2020, the City Council voted to increase the Housing
Contribution Rate by $3 from $17.10 to $20.10. No additional increases were enacted since that time,
but the rate has been CPI-adjusted twice since the last City Council amendment. The current rate as of
November 30, 2021 is $21.02 (see memo here). The following chart tracks changes in the Housing
Contribution Rate since the 2015 amendment:

$17.10 per square foot.
$20.10 per square foot.
$20.31 per square foot.
$21.02 per square foot.

Comparison to Other Communities
The combined housing and jobs linkage fee in Boston is $15.39 per square foot, of which $13.00 is
dedicated to affordable housing and $2.39 is dedicated to workforce training. Boston’s incentive zoning,
called the Linkage Program, only applies to large scale commercial developments over 100,000 square
feet. In Somerville, the combined housing and jobs linkage fee is $13.98 per square foot, of which
$11.23 is dedicated to affordable housing and $2.75 is dedicated to job creation and retention. The
housing linkage fee applies to non-residential development in excess of 30,000 square feet and the jobs
linkage fee applies to commercial development over 15,000 square feet. Boston, Somerville, and
Watertown are all currently conducting nexus studies to assess the appropriate rates for these various
required contributions.
