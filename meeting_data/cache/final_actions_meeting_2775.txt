SUBSEQUENT PHASES3 TOTALS: APPROXIMATELY $68,000,000 IN BENEFITS
3 For the purposes of this matrix, “Subsequent Phases” means construction of the 80 & 90 First Street building (i.e., new building to replace the Upper Garage building) and the 110 First Street building (i.e., new building to replace the former Best Buy building)
and the associated landscape and streetscape improvements. The specific timing threshold for each of the Subsequent Phase commitments described in this matrix are as set forth in the Letter of Commitment and PUD-8 District zoning, as applicable. While
the specific timing threshold varies for each of the commitments, all commitments identified under the Subsequent Phases heading will be implemented prior to issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the third new building.
