1.a

Basic information missing from ShotSpotter
surveillance report
• ShotSpotter does collect human conversations, not just “gunfire-like sounds”
• Memo from former Commissioner Bard in 2021 went into ShotSpotter statistics
• Over 6.5 years, only 35 out of 105 ShotSpotter activations could be confirmed as a shooting
incident; that’s a false positive rate of over 65%.
• During that time, only 13 arrests were attributable to ShotSpotter, and we don’t know what
they were for, or whether there were any convictions, or injuries.
• At a subscription cost of $50,000 per year, that translates into $25,000 per arrest

• Other cities, including Fall River, MA, have ended their ShotSpotter contracts
• RECOMMENDATION: END SHOTSPOTTER CONTRACT

Boston Regional Intelligence
Center (“BRIC”)
The local mini-NSA that tracks and polices domestic dissent

Packet Pg. 9

Basic information missing from BRIC: Omega
Dashboard surveillance report
• BRIC has a long track record of harassing and surveilling dissidents, ethnic and
religious minorities and immigrants in the greater Boston area. Particularly worried
about cross-class and cross-race links between Harvard/MIT students and Roxbury
• CPD cites to BRIC’s Privacy and Civil Liberties Policy, but the policy isn’t real, and
we know it
• BRIC claims falsely to follow a regulation, 28 CFR Part 23, that limits them to
collecting only information based on reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime.
• RECOMMENDATION: WITHDRAW CPD FROM PARTICIPATION IN BRIC’S
OMEGA DASHBOARD, PENDING AN OUTSIDE, INDEPENDENT, RANDOM
SPOT AUDIT OF BRIC’S FILES ON CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS

Thomson Reuters CLEAR
A massive database that contracts with police to help them
identify people who have had abortions, have performed
“homosexual acts”, or have “anarchist” political leanings

Packet Pg. 11

Basic information missing from Thomson Reuters
CLEAR surveillance report
• Thomson Reuters CLEAR is a data broker product, with profiles on hundreds of
millions of Americans
• CLEAR’s “risk inform” product tracks whether people have had an abortion, whether
they have “anarchist” leanings, whether they “possess a weapon” and whether they
have performed a “homosexual act.” Several of CLEAR’s “risk inform” flags are
automatically triggered if the targeted individual changes their name. Members of
groups that are more likely to change their names—such as women who marry,
victims of domestic violence, trans people, and Muslim converts—are thereby more
likely to be tagged as “risky” by CLEAR’s “risk inform” product.
• RECOMMENDATION: END THOMSON REUTERS CLEAR CONTRACT
