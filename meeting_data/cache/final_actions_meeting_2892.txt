CDBG & HUD-CARES Act Grant Programs
Relief, Recovery, and Winter Grants were funded
through Community Development Block Grants
(CDBG) from the US Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) as well as HUD-CARES
Act Funding. Funds were available to CDBG-eligible
brick and mortar businesses.
CDBG eligibility guidelines ensure that federal
funding assists residents and businesses in
predominantly low-moderate income areas
(known as Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy
(NRS) areas) or are low-moderate income microenterprises.
An eligible Cambridge brick and mortar business
owner either has a business location in the NRS
area(s), a home address in the NRS area(s) or is a
micro-enterprise business.

Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund &
Cambridge Redevelopment Authority
Round 1 (Spring 2020) distributed grants through the City of Cambridge
Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund (MDRF) and loans offered by the Cambridge
Redevelopment Authority (CRA) which targeted brick and mortar
businesses outside CDBG-eligible areas and home-based businesses
located in Cambridge.
Round 2 (Spring 2021) distributed grants only (no loan component)
through both MDRF and CRA which prioritized those who hadn't received
any prior city, state, or federal government funding, Women- and Person
of Color-owned businesses, and small businesses owners who make (or
have employees who make) less than $75,000/year.

Zina Thompson, owner of Zina’s
Hair Salon and recipient of HUD
Grants.
“I applied for help because unfortunately I
did not have enough money in my
business account to pay all the business
bills while being closed. The City was so
very helpful in so many ways because
without their support I may not have
been able to open. I am using the money
to pay all bills to date and to get more
supplies for the salon and sanitizing
products.”

Hiroko Takeshita, owner of Hanaya
Floral Design and recipient of MDRF
Grant funds.
"As a recent grant recipient of the Mayor’s Disaster
Relief Fund, I’d like to express my sincere gratitude
to the City of Cambridge for providing financial
support to my minority and women owned small
business during this very difficult time.
This funding is crucial to the survival of my Huron
Village flower shop that has experienced a
significant loss of sales and staff resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic. I started Hanaya Floral Design
on Concord Avenue in 2006 and plan on operating
at this location for years to come. This grant is a
huge help and will greatly assist us in reopening to
a new and brighter future.”

“As the owner of a brand-new, tiny business
just beginning to tap roots in Cambridge, I
couldn’t be more thankful for my MDRF grant.
The financial support will surely help me ride
out this strange Spring and Summer and
prepare for the Holiday season. But more
importantly, the grant exemplifies the
community spirit of the City of Cambridge and
its residents and the tremendous value that
they place on unique, independent businesses
like mine. With my grant, I will strive in every
way to continue to contribute to the colorful
fabric of this city.”
