The establishment of the FY22 property tax rate by the Board of Assessors, subject to the approval
of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, is the final step in the fiscal process that begins in
the spring with the submission of the annual budget to the City Council. With this memo, I am
transmitting to you my recommendations for the required votes necessary to minimize taxes on
residential properties. In addition, you will find analyses of the FY22 property tax levy, property
values, and other supporting information.
COVID-19 IMPACTS
Since COVID-19 emerged in our community, the City’s priority has been to mitigate the spread
of the virus, and to provide critical services to our most vulnerable residents. Over the past year
we have demonstrated our ability to continue to provide city services while also supporting
COVID-19 related services and programs. We also anticipated that COVID-19 related uncertainty
and financial impacts would continue into FY22, and possibly into FY23.
Several key non-property tax revenues are projected to remain below historical levels for FY22,
including Parking Fund revenues, Hotel/Motel taxes, Meals taxes, other departmental revenues,
and water and sewer revenues. In addition, some of the one-time strategies used in FY21 to help
offset revenue shortfalls are no longer available for FY22.
We anticipate that non-property tax revenues that are have been budgeted at lower levels based on
actual receipts for FY22 can be increased in FY23, as we continue to closely monitor revenues and
expenditures. Our financial flexibility allows us to strategically use reserves and minimize the tax
burden on residential property owners, as fiscal circumstances continue to transition from, the most
severe impacts of COVID-19, to a return to normal.
Hotel Motel Excise Tax revenue- will continue to be impacted throughout FY22, based on
reduced occupancy levels, reduced room rates and continued limits on travel and event
cancellations. This revenue is budgeted at $3.975 million in FY22 which is significantly lower
than actual amounts collected pre-COVID-19 (approximately $16.3 million in FY19).
Meals Excise Tax revenue- is budgeted at $3 million in FY22, a slight increase from FY21, but
significantly lower than actual amounts collected pre-COVID-19 (approximately $5.2 million in
FY19). While most indoor capacity limits have been lifted, we anticipate that this revenue will
continue to be impacted in the near future because of lower overall restaurant activity as well as
fewer gatherings, such as weddings, conferences, and seminars.
Department of Human Service Programs (DHSP) revenue- FY22 revenues are projected to be
significantly lower than Pre-COVID actual revenues collected and will continue to be impacted
by COVID-19 related changes to programming and services, including in person preschools,
afterschool childcare, community schools, and the King Open Extended Day.

To The Honorable, the City Council:

a

Interest earnings- Interest earnings are projected to be $475,000 lower than budgeted due to
continued very low interest rates.

•

The property tax levy increase to support the Budget for FY22 will be lower than what was
estimated as part of the FY22 Budget.

•

The City will again be able to provide to a majority of the residential taxpayers (58.2%) a
reduction, no increase, or an increase of less than $100 in their FY22 property tax bill.

•

A reduced commercial property tax rate, which directly benefits small retail and restaurants,
some of our most intensely impacted property owners during the pandemic.

•

As we anticipated, and have been consistently able to do, we will use a limited amount of
additional Free Cash and other reserves to offset projected non-property tax revenue shortfalls
in FY22. This allows for the current projected levy increase.

•

Ability to avoid employee layoffs and furloughs or a reduction in services to our residents in
FY22.

•

The City will continue to fill vacancies, especially those related to City Council goals and
priorities.

Free Cash
In large part because of our practice and ability to monitor and control expenditures during the
past fiscal year, the City has a certified Free Cash amount of $214.4 million (which includes $6.7
million in unappropriated mitigation receipts), an increase of $4.5 million or 2.2% from the
previous year’s certification. We typically provide the City Council a separate notification of our
certified Free Cash amount once it is received. However, the FY21 (as of June 30, 2021)
certification was received this past week, therefore we are using this communication as the
notification to City Council. Our Free Cash position demonstrates yet another benefit of our longstanding fiscal policies and management. It also provides critical flexibility to effectively address
key community needs while managing fiscal uncertainties that face us during FY22 and beyond.
In FY21, the City expended $76.4 million in Free Cash. This amount supported key initiatives of
the City administration and City Council including (but not limited to): Green Line Extension
Payment ($5 million); Public Safety Record Management System ($921,000); Radio System
Infrastructure ($1.25 million); Foundry Building Construction Support ($6 million); School
Department COVID-19 Support ($9.3 million); Open Space Acquisition ($18.5 million);
Standardized Trash Barrels ($1.5 million); Cambridgeport School Window Replacement ($2.2
million); School Buildings Assessment ($1 million); Danehy Park Evaluation and Testing
($850,000); War Memorial Facility and Pool Repairs ($1 million); Central Square Library
Feasibility Study ($500,000); COVID Sewer Testing ($475,000); Patio Heater Reimbursement
Program ($100,000).
I am recommending that a total of $22.5 million in Free Cash be used to reduce the FY22 property
tax levy. This year’s Free Cash authorization also offsets $2.5 million in additional funding for
affordable housing included in the FY22 Adopted Budget.

Packet Pg. 5

Attachment: FINAL FY22 Tax Rate Letter (CMA 2021 #220 : FY22 Tax Rate)

Even with these challenges, the City remains uniquely positioned financially due to our adherence
to prudent fiscal policies and practices over the past several years. I am pleased to report that with
the adoption of the recommendations contained in this communication:

a

•

$9 million in the Free Cash authorization which is typically requested from the City’s Free
Cash balance in order to reduce the property tax levy increase and is consistent with our
financial plan.

•

An additional $11 million in Free Cash as a net revenue offset to reduced estimated nonproperty tax revenue in FY22. We anticipate that in future years, these non-property tax
revenues will recover from COVID-19 related reductions.

•

$2.5 million to offset additional funding for affordable housing.

While the City is fortunate to be in a financial position to be able to use and replenish Free Cash,
it is anticipated that in future years we will be able to resume our prior practice of using a portion
of Free Cash to replenish other reserve funds, such as the Debt Stabilization Fund, as certain nonproperty tax revenues recover from COVID-19 impacts.
The Department of Revenue (DOR) does not allow formal authorizations of Free Cash by the City
Council until the DOR has certified a Free Cash balance at the conclusion of the fiscal year.
Non-Property Tax Revenue Increases
The use of additional non-property tax revenues and reserve funds have allowed an overall
reduction of $20 million from the original projected property tax levy for FY22.
Certain non-property tax revenues have been adjusted, based on actual FY21 receipts, to allow an
overall reduction in the property tax levy. For FY22, the following increases have been made:
Motor Vehicle Excise Tax ($250,000); Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) ($700,000); Building
Permits ($13,420,857); Health Claims Trust Fund ($3,000,000); Debt Stabilization Fund
($1,000,000).

This is an increase of $5.5 million from what was approved as part of the FY22 Adopted Budget,
and represents:

a

OVERVIEW

The FY22 Adopted Operating Budget increased by 4.6% over the FY21 Adopted Operating
Budget. The FY22 Budget adopted by the City Council in June 2021 projected a property tax levy
increase of $42.3 million, or 8.95%, to $514,805,115 in order to fund operating and capital
expenditures.
With approval of these recommendations, the property tax levy increase will be lowered to 4.7%.
The property tax levy increase is below the five-year (FY18-FY22) annual average increase of
5.84%, and the ten-year (FY13-FY22) annual average increase of 5.17%.
The FY22 Budget continues to demonstrate the City’s extraordinary commitment to creating and
preserving affordable rental and homeownership opportunities for low, moderate, and middleincome families. Affordable housing funding in FY22 includes: $5.85 million funded from
building permit and department revenue, an additional $10 million funded from property taxes,
and $2.5 million funded from Free Cash. This is in addition to $14 million appropriated by the
City Council from FY22 Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds.
A total of $32.35 million of direct financial support is provided to the Affordable Housing Trust
in FY22, which is an increase of $5.1 million, or 18.7%, from FY21 ($27.3 million). In FY19, I
made a commitment to double the amount of funds ($13.65 million in FY19) dedicated to
affordable housing in Cambridge within 3-5 years. FY22 funds dedicated to affordable housing
represent an increase of 137% for a total of $93.5 million since FY19.
The City also increased property tax support to schools by 5.3% or $10,003,460, to $198,419,015.
The FY22 School budget is $223,718,190 and includes 36 new full time equivalent (fte) positions.
The FY22 Budget includes funding for an expansion of branch library hours, which was delayed
from FY21 due to the COVID-19 crisis. As part of the plan, expansion of hours will begin at
physical locations, eventually increasing from a collective total of 313 hours/week to
approximately 359 hours/week. It is anticipated that all branch locations will offer at least five
days and three nights of service, and Saturday hours will be offered at three branches.
The FY22 Budget maintains strong support for traffic safety initiatives including Vision Zero and
implementation of the City’s Bicycle Network Plan, including installation of separated bike
facilities per the Cycling Safety Ordinance on multiple street segments.
In FY22, the City will start a Small Business Compost Pilot for up to 100 small businesses, which
has the potential to help businesses recover economically from the pandemic and will provide a
sustainable option for disposing of food waste.
The FY22 Budget includes funding for a new Cambridge Firefighter Cadet Program which will be
modeled after the successful Cambridge Police Cadet Program and provide opportunities for
Cambridge residents aged 18-23 interested in a career in the Fire Department. It is anticipated that
a program would include a two-year commitment as well as a salary, classroom, and cooperative
training education to prepare participants to become a Cambridge firefighter.

The actual FY22 property tax levy is $494,731,992. This is an increase of $22,211,844 or 4.7%
from FY21 and reflects the City Council goal to “Ensure the City’s Budget allocates resources
responsibly and responsively.” As in years past we have been able to provide an actual increase
that is lower than the estimated increase projected in June 2021, and what was presented to the
rating agencies in February. Responsible and responsive fiscal policies and practices are key to
addressing the challenge of balancing expansion and investment in new programs and initiatives,
while also minimizing the impact of increases in the tax levy.

a

The city is also increasing a small business tax exemption for personal property accounts. Last
year, in FY21, the city provided this exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than
$10,000 in assessed value which exempted 1,194 small businesses from receiving a personal
property tax bill. For FY22, Cambridge’s home rule petition to increase the exemption amount to
$20,000 was accepted by the City Council and will exempt 1,553 small business accounts. The
City is also recommending that certain licensing fees continue to be reduced by up to 40% in FY22
in order to provide additional financial relief to businesses affected by COVID-19.

Based on a property tax levy of $494.7 million, the FY22 residential tax rate will be $5.92 per
thousand dollars of value, subject to Department of Revenue approval. This is an increase of $0.07,
or 1.2% from FY21. However, as can be seen in Table III, the median residential tax bill has only
moderately increased. The commercial tax rate will be $11.23, which is a decrease of $0.62, or 5.2% from FY21. Establishing the tax rate is a straightforward calculation: the total tax levy
divided by the total assessed valuation (less any exemptions), equals the tax rate for FY22.
In June, the City Council was informed that due to COVID-19 there was still some uncertainty
regarding many non-property tax revenue projections, and that the City may not be able to use
additional non-property tax revenues when determining the actual levy.
As has consistently been our strategy, once actual prior year receipts and final state aid figures
were known, we have been able to increase certain non-property tax revenues along with reserve
funds to allow for a reduction in the property tax levy from what was presented with the budget.
These strategies have allowed for an overall reduction of $20 million from the original projected
property tax levy for FY22.
This letter includes a recommendation to use $25 million in reserve accounts to lower the property
tax levy: $2.5 million from overlay surplus and $22.5 million in Free Cash. The certified Free Cash
amount of $214.4 million, an increase of $4.5 million or 2.2% from the previous year’s
certification. This amount includes $6.7 million in unappropriated mitigation receipts. Per MGL
Chapter 144 Section 53, these receipts must flow through the Free Cash certification process before
being available for appropriation by the Council. Excluding mitigation receipts, net certified Free
Cash is $207.7 million. The City Manager will be coming before the City Council with a
recommendation for the appropriation of mitigation receipts later in the fiscal year.
There is a recommendation to use $9.5 million from the City Debt Stabilization Fund to offset
increases in debt service costs that would otherwise have been funded from property taxes. This
is an increase of $1.5 million from FY21. At the end of FY21, the Debt Stabilization Fund had
balance of $48.5 million.
Prudent use of reserves allows the City to maintain stability in both current and future property tax
increases while investing in significant capital and infrastructure projects. This strategy of using
an increased amount of non-property tax revenues and reserves to lower property taxes will not
jeopardize our long-term fiscal health. However, if the City used too much of its reserves in one
year to artificially reduce property taxes, it would mean that in the following year, the City would
be required to either increase taxes significantly or dramatically reduce expenditures.

The FY22 Budget also supports capital improvements including funds to implement the winning
projects from cycle seven of the Participatory Budget program, and major capital projects
including our multi-year Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan, sewer/stormwater improvement
projects, technology initiatives, and Complete Streets reconstruction projects.

a

The City’s strategy for the use of reserves has also been positively recognized by the three major
credit rating agencies and is reflected in our AAA credit rating. It is also important to recognize
that a healthy balance of development between residential and commercial be continued to ensure
homeowner’s real estate taxes remain affordable.

This will be the seventeenth year in a row that a majority of residential taxpayers will see a
reduction, no change, or an increase of less than $100 in their tax bill. This reflects our long
standing commitment and strategy to provide an adequate level of predictability and stability
regarding tax bills. In fact, in FY22, 58% of residential taxpayers will see a reduction, no increase
or an increase of less than $100; and 75% of residential taxpayers will see an average increase of
less than $250. This is a slight decrease from FY21, where 59% of residential taxpayers saw a
reduction, no increase, or an increase of less than $100 and 77% of residential taxpayers saw an
increase of less than $250.
Over the past ten years (FY13-22), the City has seen an average of 69.3% of residential taxpayers
see a reduction, no increase, or an increase of less than a $100 to their residential tax bill, and
63.4% over the past five years (FY18-22). Even while facing the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
financial uncertainties related to it, the city has been able to consistently achieve these results while
maintaining and expanding City and school services that citizens have come to expect and also
while providing a robust capital improvement program.

COVID-19 has been particularly impactable on single-family values and sales during calendar
year 2020. With mortgage rates remaining at near record lows, persistent demand for single family
homes and a constricted supply of inventory, the City saw larger assessment increases for the
single-family class then in prior years (single family median tax bill increased by 9.5% for FY22
compared to a 4.5% increase last year). The strategies that the city applied to blunt the impact of
higher residential tax bills are notably important in this tax year. The larger increase in values for
the single-family class act as a double impact for homeowners who have had income or job losses

IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS

a

due to COVID-19 while having a significantly larger tax bill. The strategies employed by the city
to mitigate the larger tax bills helped to decrease the impact of higher tax bills for residential
properties.
MEDIAN TAX BILLS

The Budget: If the City Council adopts the proposed recommendations, there will be a 4.7%
increase in the property tax levy required to balance the FY22 Budget, which supports the City
Council Goal to “Ensure the City’s Budget allocates resources responsibly and responsively.”
Commercial-Residential Property Tax Classification: Tax classification allows municipalities
to tax commercial taxpayers at a higher rate than residential taxpayers. In FY22, commercial
property owners will pay 65.4% of the property tax levy, the same share as in FY21. Consequently,
residential property owners’ share of the FY22 tax levy is 34.6%, also the same as in FY21.
Property Values: Every January 1st, the City of Cambridge must meet Department of Revenue
requirements to certify that property values represent full and fair market value. As a result of the
market activity in calendar year 2020, which is the basis of the FY22 property assessment, total
residential property values increased by 2.9%. Total commercial property values increased by
11.0%. This year’s increase in total values reflects both the increase in some classes that have been
untouched by the impact of COVID-19 as well as the negative effects of the pandemic and COVID19 mitigation strategies. Cambridge is well positioned by having much commercial and lab space
that has been unaffected by work changes wrought by the pandemic. While the City has no control
over the increase in property values, it does have control over levy increases, which ultimately
impact taxes paid by property owners. As was the case last year, the residential rate will increase
while the commercial rate decreases. This is due to the Minimum Residential Factor calculated
by the Department of Revenue. One of the requirements that are affecting the rate this year is that
residential taxpayers cannot pay less than the lowest percentage share of the levy they have paid
since classification began. However, as can be seen in Table III, the median residential tax bill
has only moderately increased. Additionally, a major concern going forward is that if residential
value increases outpace commercial/industrial/personal property increases, the City could hit the
ceiling for the property tax classification shift. Once the classification ceiling is reached, the
residential class will bear the majority of any tax levy increase.
As part of the process, the City must successfully complete the Department of Revenue’s (DOR)
five-year Revaluation certification process of the City’s real and personal property values, system,
and methodologies.

The analysis that follows explains in further detail how the City determined property values and
property tax rates for FY22. There are three major factors which determine a property tax bill: 1)
the Budget, 2) Commercial-Residential Property Tax Classification, and 3) Property Values. As
discussed below, all three factors contributed to lower tax bills for many homeowners.

CITY-WIDE ASSESSED VALUES
FY22 values are based on market activity that occurred during calendar year 2020, during which
the commercial classes valuations split due to the uneven impact of COVID-19. Residential
activity was also up for most classes, but the single families were most affected by a low supply
of inventory and record low mortgage rates. The Class A Office and lab sectors increased while
the retail and hotels were most affected by COVID-19 restrictions and saw increased vacancies
and lowered room rates. The major components which impact the commercial values are the
construction of life science buildings and the personal property associated with these
developments.
For FY22, the total assessed value of taxable property in the City equals $63,952,953,737
approximately $3.7 billion, or a 6.2% increase, over FY21 values. The actual FY22 total assessed
values are greater than the projections presented to the rating agencies in February 2021 due to
continued strength and resilience in the Cambridge real estate market.
COVID-19 PROPERTY TAX IMPACTS
The FY22 assessments, unlike the FY21 assessments, reflect the impact of COVID-19. The
Assessing Department saw a divergence within the commercial classes and a strong increase
within the single-family sales. As seen elsewhere in the country, the single-family values
increased above all other residential classes with a 6.4% increase. Near record low mortgage rates,
persistent demand and constricted supply continue to increase single house prices. The pandemic
has increased interest in standalone homes that allow for individual entrances and separate spaces.
Shared spaces that include communal amenities that are usually found in the larger condo
complexes are in less demand due to the pandemic. Additionally, the two and three families also
saw increases of 3.7% and 3.4% respectively.
The commercial values separated along different class types. The Class A offices and Lab Space
continued to increase in value while other business sectors, such as retail and the hospitability
industry were among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 mitigation strategies used in Massachusetts.
The Assessing Department continues to meet with the Commonwealth's Department of Revenue
to discuss economic concerns based on the impact of COVID-19. The Assessing Department has
been meeting with and updating the neighborhood business associations, the Cambridge Chamber
of Commerce, and local business owners with information to clarify the basis for the FY22
property tax bills.
As noted above, the City is required to assess properties at full and fair market value. Therefore, it
is extremely important to control the increase in the property tax levy in order to limit the impact

on tax bills. While property values have increased significantly, residential tax bills have increased
more moderately. As a result, the City has consistently received a limited number of abatement
applications annually.

The table below breaks out new construction values and tax base levy growth due to new
construction by property type. This new construction growth, coupled with moderate budget
increases, has allowed the City to maintain the classification of taxes and increase the City’s excess

For FY22, the City was able to increase its levy limit by approximately $31.6 million, to $691.3
million. Approximately $15.1 million of this increase was due to new construction and amended
FY21 new growth. State law allows the City to increase its tax levy limit by an amount equal to
the total FY22 value of newly constructed or renovated property, multiplied by the FY21 tax rate.
The remaining $16.5 million is the 2.5% increase over the FY21 levy allowed by Proposition 2½.
The City’s excess levy capacity increased by approximately $9.4 million, or 5.03%, to $196.6
million in FY22.

In FY22, the market for some commercial properties and most residential properties increased at
a faster pace than most of the Greater Boston area, resulting in the continuation of a tax distribution
similar to FY21 between commercial taxpayers and residential taxpayers. Despite this
environment of increasing values, it is important to note that due to the City’s ability to control
taxes and therefore produce tax bills with moderate increases, the City has incurred a limited
number of abatement requests annually. This has allowed for a $2.5 million overlay surplus to be
applied towards lowering the FY22 property tax levy, as has been our practice in prior years.

FY22 REVALUATION PROCESS
Each year, the Board of Assessors conducts a reappraisal of all property within the City. The
residential and commercial valuation models are refined each year to reflect market conditions
which have impacted assessed values. This fiscal year, the Department of Revenue (DOR)
conducted a deeper review of the Assessing Department’s statistical validation of the models due
to this being a five-year Revaluation.
The FY22 valuation model is based upon sales of property that occurred during calendar year
2020, to establish the market value of all property as of January 1, 2021. For FY22, the number
of assessing districts has remained unchanged. In prior years, some consolidation of districts took
place to create a larger sales sample size.
The ultimate test for any mass appraisal model is the comparison between actual sales not part of
the model building process and the predicted value from the model. Comparing the FY21 model
to calendar year 2020 sales data, the model showed the following results.

The assessment ratios were between 81%-94% of calendar year 2020 sales, reflecting increasing
market values during the last year.
Calendar year 2020 sales demonstrated that the FY21 model needed to be updated based on current
market trends and overall property class statistics. The individual neighborhoods also showed
some inconsistent growth trends and required review. As a result, sales data from the calendar
year 2020 real estate market has been utilized, along with what was learned from the prior year
abatement activity, to establish the FY22 assessed values as of January 1, 2021. Using technologies
such as the Geographical Information System (GIS) allowed for a more in-depth review of data.
Using GIS, the Board of Assessors was able to visually display market activity and thereby validate
the assessing districts using this information.
Modifications were made to the residential and condominium models, as well as to residential land
values. The residential land had adjustments for neighborhood, while the residential model was
recalibrated for use, grade, finished basements and condition adjustments. The condominium
model was adjusted by neighborhood for market conditions as of the assessment date. Due to
COVID-19, interior inspections were halted, and only exterior reviews were preformed along with
analysis of all sales data available. The analysis for determining property values depends on
several factors: the trends of the real estate market in the areas of sales; property improvements;
changes in the economics of real estate finance and the high demand for real estate in the city. To
arrive at full and fair cash values for all 26,174 parcels, the Assessing Department uses a state-ofthe-art Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal system (CAMA). Market adjusted cost approach
models, extracted from residential sales for calendar year 2020, were refined to best reflect the
equity of comparable properties as demonstrated in the various neighborhoods. Sales of almost
800 houses and condominium units were analyzed to develop these valuation models by property
type (one-family, two-family, three-family, and condominium units).
COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT SURCHARGE
In November 2001, Cambridge voters approved adoption of the Community Preservation Act
(CPA), a State law that allows the City to receive matching funds from the State for money raised
locally in support of affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space. The local portion
of CPA funding is raised through a 3% surcharge on taxes.
However, the State match has enabled the City to provide additional funding for these initiatives.
To date, Cambridge has received more CPA matching funds from the Commonwealth than any
other participating community. Consequently, Cambridge residents will continue to benefit from
affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space initiatives throughout the City for years
to come.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. That the City Council vote to authorize the use of $22,500,000 in Free Cash to reduce the FY22
tax rate.
2. That the City Council vote to authorize $2,500,000 in overlay surplus/reserves to be used for
reducing the FY22 tax rate.
3. That the City Council vote to authorize $9,500,000 from the City Debt Stabilization Fund to
be used as a revenue source to the General Fund Budget, which is an increase of $1,000,000
than what was included in the FY22 Adopted Budget.
4. That the City Council classify property within the City of Cambridge into the five classes
allowed for the purpose of allocating the property tax. It is further recommended that the City
Council adopt a minimum residential factor of 62.9395%.
5. That the City Council approve the residential exemption factor of 30% for owner occupied
homes, which should result in a residential tax rate of $5.92 upon final approval by the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue. In addition, based upon final approval by the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue the commercial tax rate is anticipated to be $11.23.
6. That the City Council vote to double the normal value of the statutory exemptions.
7. That the City Council vote to increase the FY22 exemption allowed under Massachusetts
General Laws (MGL) Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 17D from $341 to $346.
8. That the City Council vote to increase the FY22 asset limits allowed under Massachusetts
General Laws (MGL) Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 17E from $67,379 to $68,322.
9. That the City Council vote to increase the FY22 income and assets limits for elderly persons
(age 65 or older). Income limits of $27,860 to $28,250 for those who are single and $41,792

to $42,377 for those who are married, asset limits of $55,718 to $56,498 for those who are
single and $76,612 to $77,685 for those who are married, as allowed under MGL, Chapter 59,
Section 5, Clause 41D.

ISSUES/REQUIRED VOTES
As the City Council is aware, by the time the classification vote is taken in the fall of each year,
the options for the City are fairly limited. Failure to approve the recommended classification,
residential exemption and the doubling of statutory exemptions would result in significantly higher
taxes for residential property owners. After the classification vote is taken, the establishment of
the tax rate is a fairly simple mathematical calculation: the tax levy required to support the City
budget, divided by the total assessed valuation (less any exemptions), equals the tax rate for FY22.
The following is a summary of the votes required by the City Council.
•

Authorize $22,500,000 in Free Cash to Reduce the FY22 Tax Levy. For the fiscal year that
ended June 30, 2021, the City of Cambridge has a certified Free Cash balance of $214,409,840
an increase of approximately $4.5 million from the previous year. This balance includes
approximately $6.7 million in unappropriated mitigation receipts which, according to MGL
chapter 44 section 53, must flow through the Free Cash certification process before the receipts
are available for appropriation by the Council. After the reduction of mitigation funds, the net
certified Free Cash Balance is $207.7 million.
The $22.5 million in the Free Cash authorization is requested at this time from the City’s Free
Cash balance in order to reduce the property tax levy increase. This year’s Free Cash
authorization helps offset $2.5 million in funding for affordable housing included in the FY22
Adopted Budget.
The Department of Revenue (DOR) does not allow formal authorizations of Free Cash by the
City Council until the DOR has certified a Free Cash balance at the conclusion of the fiscal
year.

•

Transfer of Excess Overlay Balances. The City is authorized to increase each tax levy by up
to five percent as an “overlay” to provide for tax abatements. If abatements are granted in
excess of the applicable overlay, the excess is required to be added to the next tax levy, or
transfers may be made from surplus balances from prior fiscal years.
Overall, the City has approximately $19.4 million in overlay balances as of June 30, 2021.
However, there are cases pending at the Appellate Tax Board for which the City must have
sufficient balances to cover abatements if it loses these cases. Based upon the overall size of
the overlay surplus, I am recommending that the City use $2.5 million of this surplus to
decrease the tax levy. This conservative approach will allow the City to maintain a sufficient
overlay reserve while reducing older overlay balances to help lower the tax levy.

13
Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: FINAL FY22 Tax Rate Letter (CMA 2021 #220 : FY22 Tax Rate)

10. That the City Council vote the income limit for deferral of real estate taxes by elderly persons
(at least 65 years old) as determined by the Commissioner of Revenue for the purposes of
MGL, Chapter 62, Section 6, subsection (k), for a single person who is not head of household
($61,000) and for a married couple ($92,000), as allowed under MGL Chapter 59, Section 5,
Clause 41A. The reduction of the interest rate to 4% for deferred taxes, which was approved
by the City Council previously, will continue.

•

Authorize $9,500,000 in City Debt Stabilization Funds. In recognition of increases in debt
service costs related to major capital projects, the City established a City Debt Stabilization
Fund. The Adopted FY22 Budget included $8.5 million from this source, which has been
increased to $9.5 million, to fund debt service costs related to the elementary school
reconstruction program.

•

Classify Property and Establish Minimum Residential Factor. Since 1984, the City
Council has voted annually to follow State law allowing the classification of property
according to use (residential or commercial) and to allocate the legal maximum portion of the
tax levy to the commercial class. State law allows the residential portion of the tax levy to be
as low as 50% of what it would be if there were single tax rates. However, there are two
exceptions to the 50% minimum:
The residential percent of the levy cannot drop to less than its lowest level since classification
was initially voted by the City Council (34.5615% in 1985 in Cambridge); and the 50% level
does not cause the commercial class to bear a portion of the levy greater than 175% of what it
would be if both classes were taxed equally.
Under the requirements for classification, the City Council sets the levy distribution each year
by voting for a Minimum Residential Factor. The result of voting for the Minimum Residential
Factor of 62.9395% this year will be a residential property share of the total tax levy of
34.5615%. This means that Commercial property will pay the remainder, 65.4385% of the
levy. The commercial portion of the levy is 145.136% of what it would be with a single tax
rate if classification was not adopted.

•

Residential Exemptions. Home Rule Legislation allowing the City to increase the residential
exemption from 20% to 30% was filed by a unanimous vote of the City Council and signed
into law in September 2003. This change enables the City to grant owner occupants of
residential properties a deduction of up to 30% of the average residential parcel value before
the tax rate is applied. I am recommending that the City Council accept the Residential
Exemption at 30%. This amount is deducted from the assessed value of each owner-occupied
property prior to applying the tax rate. The residential exemption serves to reduce the effective
tax rate on lower valued properties while raising it on higher valued properties. Since the same
amount is deducted from every value, its impact is greatest on the lower valued properties. The
residential exemption is paid for by raising the residential tax rate sufficiently to cover the
number of taxpayers claiming the residential exemption.
For FY22, there are approximately 14,100 residential exemptions on the Assessing Department
files on owner-occupied homes. The Assessing Department conducts random audits and
responds to inquiries about individuals claiming the residential exemption, to ensure the
validity of the program.
If Cambridge did not adopt a residential exemption, the residential tax rate would be $4.87
instead of $5.92. The higher tax rate results in a "break-even" value over which the higher
valued residential properties are assessed higher taxes than would be the case if there were no
residential exemption. In FY22, the break-even assessed value is approximately $2,497,800.

The first allows cities and towns to double the statutory amount of exemption for taxpayers
whose tax bills have increased over the prior year's bill. The City Council votes annually for
this increase. I am recommending that the Council do this for FY22, as it has since FY87.
The second allows cities and towns under Massachusetts General Laws (MGL) Chapter 59,
Section 5, Clause 17D to increase the amount of the exemption for a senior citizen 70 or older,
surviving spouse, or minor with a deceased parent, by the increase in the cost-of-living as
measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The cost of living adjustment (COLA), as determined by the DOR, is measured by the increase
in the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index
for Urban Consumers, Boston (CPI-U) for the previous calendar year. The percentage increase
for this period was 1.4%. Therefore, the FY22 exemption amounts, income limits or asset limits
under these local options will increase over the FY21 amounts and limits. Therefore, the FY22
exemption will be $346 from $341.
In addition, under Clause 17E, which Cambridge has already adopted, cities and towns can
increase the asset amounts by the CPI percentage for this same group. The FY22 amounts
increases to $68,322 from $67,379.
MGL Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 41D allows cities and towns to increase the income and
assets limits for elderly persons (age 65 or older) by the CPI percentage. For FY22, the income
limits will be $28,250 for those who are single, $42,377 for those who are married, and the
asset limits will be $56,498 for those who are single and $77,685 for those who are married.
● Income Limit for Tax Deferral. Another form of tax relief available to property owners
under state law is found in MGL Chapter 59, Section 3, Clause 41A. This statute allows
taxpayers who are at least 65 years old to defer tax payments until they are deceased, or the
property is transferred. The statutory income limit for this deferral is $40,000. However, a
change in the statute, allows the City Council to vote to increase the income limit for deferral
of real estate taxes by elderly persons (at least 65 years old) from $40,000 to the amount
determined by the Commissioner of Revenue for the purposes of subsection (k) of section 6 of
chapter 62, (currently $61,000 for a single person and $92,000 for a married couple, which
may be indexed by Massachusetts DOR for FY22), as allowed under MGL Chapter 59, Section
5, Clause 41A. I am recommending that the City Council vote to adopt the deferral amount.
The City Council has previously voted to reduce the interest percentage to 4% on deferred
property tax balances.

15
Packet Pg. 18

Attachment: FINAL FY22 Tax Rate Letter (CMA 2021 #220 : FY22 Tax Rate)

● Double Statutory Exemptions/Exemption Increases. State legislation requires cities and
towns to grant a variety of tax exemptions to elderly taxpayers, blind taxpayers, veterans and
surviving spouses who qualify by virtue of residency, income, and assets. There are also two
pieces of legislation which authorize cities and towns to increase the amounts of these
exemptions.

a

CONCLUSION
While our focus remains on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and providing critical services to
our most vulnerable residents, the City Council also adopted a balanced FY22 Budget that provides
continued and expanding support to important City priorities and initiatives. The Budget includes
additional funding for affordable housing, school services, library expansion, small business
support, traffic safety, and climate initiatives. It also includes a robust capital plan, including
funding to support municipal facilities improvements, important sewer/stormwater improvement
projects, technology initiatives, and major street projects.

Approximately 66% of the revenues that fund the City’s operating budget are raised through property
taxes. Massachusetts communities are limited in how they can raise revenues, resulting in a greater
reliance on the property tax, since it is the largest and most stable revenue. The City has been able to
achieve a lower property tax rate and lower residential property tax bill than surrounding communities
due to its ability to generate diverse non-property tax revenues, foster new construction, control budget
growth, and plan prudent use of reserves. In addition, a strong, stable commercial tax base is a key
component of our ability to limit impacts on residential taxpayers.
Overall, continued sound financial management and planning have enabled the City Council to
limit the growth of residential property taxes in FY22. In addition, with City Council approval, the
City will use $25 million of reserves (Free Cash/overlay surplus) in FY22 to lessen the amount to
be raised from the property tax levy, which translates into a lower property tax burden for the
taxpayers of the City. This amount includes $22.5 million from Free Cash and $2.5 million from
the Overlay Surplus. The Free Cash amount used this year includes an additional $11 million as a
net revenue offset to reduced estimated non-property tax revenue in FY22. We anticipated that in
future years we will be able to resume our prior practice of using a portion of Free Cash to replenish
other reserve funds, as certain non-property tax revenues recover from COVID-19 impacts.
With the approval of this recommendation, the Debt Stabilization Fund is projected to have a FY22
year-end balance of $39 million to help offset some of the future debt service costs related to major
capital projects including the school reconstruction program. The City will continue to pursue
opportunities for reimbursement through the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA)
program for smaller repair projects; these funds are not included in our current financial
projections.
Our current four-year debt schedule (FY22-25) which is under review, is projected to be
approximately $621.8 million, which is comprised of $469.2 million in tax supported debt and
$152.6 million of sewer debt. The multi-year school reconstruction program makes up $224
million of this total and includes the construction of the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper
School project. However, it should be noted that with this projected debt issuance, the City’s ability
to fund additional major projects is limited.
The City used $76.4 million in Free Cash in FY21. With the approval of these recommendations,
the City will use $22.5 million in Free Cash, reducing the net Free Cash balance to $191.9 million.
The City has used an average of $60.2 million in Free Cash annually over the last 5 years. The
strategic use of Free Cash is not only used to reduce the current tax levy and stabilize the impact
of future debt supported capital projects, but is also available to fund one-time items. This planned
approach has allowed us to maintain our Free Cash balances, enabled us to weather uncertain

Attachment: FINAL FY22 Tax Rate Letter (CMA 2021 #220 : FY22 Tax Rate)

Because of strong City management and sound fiscal policies adopted by the City Council we are
in a financial position to achieve this while also minimizing the tax burden placed on residential
property owners.

economic times, and is the City’s insurance policy against unforeseen catastrophes.

Even while a significant level of economic uncertainty remains due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the long-term outlook for Cambridge continues to be very strong and reinforces the City’s practice
of managing our resources wisely. Although significant impacts on several key revenues for the
city are expected to remain in the near future, the past fiscal year was relatively strong financially
for the City based on several indicators, with total assessed values continuing to increase; total
actual revenues which exceeded projections and prior year collections; and controlled
expenditures. We will continue to closely monitor revenues as well as expenditures, and use our
five-year financial and capital plan, debt and reserve policies, and the City Council goals, as a
blueprint for our long-range planning.
The current crisis will also likely have both immediate and long-term effects on valuations, so it
is still important to maintain a healthy balance of development between residential and commercial
to ensure that homeowners’ real estate taxes remain affordable. As we plan for the FY23 Budget
process, it is clear that we will need to continue to be prudent in developing the budget, which
again may not have the same expansion of positions and services that we have been able to include
in prior years.
It is important to acknowledge that the flexibility to adjust the tax levy in a way that helps minimize
the impacts on property owners, while also maintaining a high level of service and expanding key
City initiatives, is provided by adherence to long standing fiscal practices and policies, maintaining
sufficient reserves, and controlling the budget.
As we had previously noted and anticipated, the past fiscal year was one of both fiscal uncertainty
and challenges. However, we were also in the fortunate position to be able to effectively use our
fiscal resources to bridge the most severe challenges, while providing a high level of service to the
community, and lessen the tax burden of our taxpayers. As demonstrated through the
recommendations in this letter, we expect this fiscal year to also serve as part of a continuing
transition period even as we anticipate a return to increased fiscal stability and predictability in
future years.
After 20 years of service with the City as Assistant City Manager for Finance, and as City Manager,
this is my last tax rate letter to the City Council. I am extremely proud of what we have been able
to accomplish in collaboration with staff, City Council and the community. Working together, we
have created a strong fiscal framework that has consistently resulted in stable and moderate tax
increases.
At the same time however, we have also invested heavily in affordable housing, our capital
infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and programs and services for our residents. Just some
of the major undertakings in recent years has included:
•

Introducing property taxes and building permit revenues as sources of funding for affordable
housing which, when combined with Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds, has resulted

It is anticipated that there will be several additional recommendations for significant Free Cash
expenditures in FY22 which will likely result in a decrease in next year’s certified Free Cash
balance. Subject to City Manager recommendation and City Council approval, a partial list of the
possible items to be recommended for appropriation from Free Cash in FY22 include: additional
school and COVID-19 costs; additional school repairs; munincipal building repair projects;
Alternative Public Safety Response Initiative; Friday Night Hype program; municipal building
security; radio replacement; E-Gov projects; broadband feasibility; fire apparatus; open space;
snowstorm related expenses; and others as necessary.

•

The construction of 2 new elementary and upper school complexes (MLK Elementary and
Putnam Ave Upper School Complex; King Open and Cambridge Street Upper School
Complex), and the design of the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper School Complex.
Together, these projects will total over $500 million in city funding.

•

Comprehensive municipal building projects including City Hall improvements; the Foundry
Building; Department of Public Works Complex improvements; Fire Station renovations; and
Library improvements and expansion.

•

Investment in environmental initiatives and infrastructure including municipal building
sustainability and improvement projects; water and sewer system upgrades; an expanded tree
canopy; major transportation corridor and street safety improvements; and implementation of
the Bicycle Network Plan.

•

Several major open space renovations and acquisitions including the recent purchase of over 4
acres of open space (Buckingham Field) owned by Buckingham Browne and Nichols School
(BB&N); the renovation of Glacken Field; creation of a new Universal Design playground;
and construction of the new Toomey Park in East Cambridge.

•

Expanded investment in services and initiatives for our residents including increased school
funding; expanded early education and human service programs; funding and services to
support our unhoused community; funding to implement Police and Fire cadet programs;
funding for innovations in public safety; and investments in improving equity and inclusion
efforts both within the City and throughout the community.

•

Since March 2020, the City has implemented a comprehensive COVID-19 pandemic response
to protect the health and well-being of our community and launched various direct financial
and programmatic support initiatives to aid individuals, families, small businesses, and nonprofits impacted by the pandemic. Our collective efforts have helped Cambridge’s COVID-19
metrics remain lower than state and national levels.

We have been able to finance projects such as the ones above, and many more, both planned and
unforeseen, without placing the burden on residential and commercial taxpayers. This is because
our adopted policies and practices have allowed us to maintain fiscal stability, predictability, as
well as the flexibility to address unexpected challenges.
I would like to thank the City Council for their continued guidance and support as well as staff for
their hard work, that makes Cambridge the most fiscally sound city in the Commonwealth.
Very truly yours,
