EARLIER THIS WEEK. LAST WEEK, BASED ON THE METRIC, CAMBRIDGE IS
ONCE AGAIN DESIGNATED A GREEN LOW-RISK COMMUNITY. I BELIEVE WE
ARE THE ONLY CITY OF OUR SIZE TO BE DESIGNATED AS A GREEN
COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE HOW FAR WE HAVE
COME IN A FEW MONTHS. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS EFFORT DIDN'T
HAPPEN ON ITS OWN. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE USED THE DATA COMING
FROM THE COMMONWEALTH TO HELP INFORM OUR DECISIONS, AND
BECAUSE WE HAD A STRATEGIC USE OF OUR WORKING PLAN WITH THE
EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL, PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, CITY DEPARTMENTS,
BUSINESS ASSOCIATION, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. IN THE LOW
NUMBERS ARE A RESULT OF THE PUBLIC FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE WE
HAVE ISSUED IN GETTING VACCINATED. I THANK ALL PARTNERS AND
RESIDENTS FOR THEIR COLLABORATION.
AND ALSO I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE MUST REMAIN CAUTIOUS. YOU KNOW,
WE RECORDED A COVID-19 DEATH TODAY. I WILL SHARE MY CONDOLENCE
WITH THE FAMILY. IT HAS TAKEN A TOLD ON US AND GOING FORWARD,
WE'LL CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT ASSERTIVE APPROACH TO ENSURE WE
PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS AND MAKE
ADJUSTMENT TO THE STRATEGIES BASED ON CURRENT DATA. WE MUST

REMAIN VIGILANT AND GET VACCINATED TO REMAIN RISK. CAMBRIDGE HAS
SEEN A DECREASE IN THE SEVEN-DAY MOVING AVERAGE PER CONFIRMED
HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE REPORT 3.1 CASES COMPARED TO 7.2 ON MAY 3.
AND 8.3 ON APRIL 25TH. AND 20.8 ON APRIL 12. THIS IS GREAT PROGRESS.
ADDITIONALLY, OUR PERCENT POSITIVITY HAS DECREASED BY 27% FROM THE
PREVIOUS WEEK. IT IS NOW AT POINT 32. AS REPORTED IN THE MAY SIX
COMMONWEALTH REPORT. AS OF TODAY, THE SEVEN-DAY AVERAGE
PERCENTAGE OF POSITIVITY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH IS DECREASED. TO
1.26. IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING TO SEE OUR LOWER CASE NUMBERS
FOLLOWING POSITIVITY RATE AND INCREASE VACCINATION TO CONTINUE
TRENDING IN THE POSITIVE DIRECTION.
WITH THE CONTINUED EFFORT OF THE CITY'S TEAM AND THE RESIDENT, I'M
CONFIDENT WE CAN REMAIN A GREEN LOW-RISK COMMUNITY. ACCORDING
TO THE VACCINATION REPORT, AS OF MAY 4, 62% OF THE CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE. UP 5%
FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK AND 38%. RESIDENTS ARE VACCINATED AND UP
18%. I THANK CAMBRIDGE FIRE AND POLICE AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM
FOR THE WORK THEY DID LAST WEEK IN RUNNING THE WALK-IN VACCINE
CLINICS. I WANT TO THANK CAMBRIDGESIDE AND BECAUSE OF THE CHURCH,
PARTNERING WITH US TO USE THE FACILITY. CLAUDE WILL PROVIDE AN
UPDATE ON THE RESULTS OF THE CLINICS DURING THE PRESENTATION. IN
TERMS OF THE REOPENING EFFORTS, ON FRIDAY IT ANNOUNCED IT WILL
REMAIN IN PHASE FOUR, STEP ONE, AND WON'T ADVANCE TO STEP TWO AT
THIS TIME. AS YOU KNOW, EFFECTIVE TODAY, ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE
PERMITTED IN THE STATE PURSUANT TO THE COMMONWEALTH'S
REOPENING PLAN. THE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES, INDOOR SINGING AND
VENUES WILL NOT BE PERMITTED IN CAMBRIDGE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
ADDITIONALLY, THE CITY ANNOUNCED IT HAS RESCINDED THE AMENDED
TEMPORARY EMERGENCY CONSTRUCTION ORDER ISSUED ON JUNE 22, 2020.
MOVING FORWARD, ALL CONSTRUCTION IN THE CITY SHALL COMPLY WITH
THE COMMONWEALTH MANDATORY SAFETY STANDARDS FOR WORKPLACES
AND PROTOCOLS. I WILL ADDRESS QUESTIONS FROM THE VICE MAYOR
MALLON AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO
CLAUDE TO ADDRESS MAYOR SIDDIQUI'S QUESTIONS. ONE OF VICE MAYOR
MALLON'S QUESTIONS IS... CAN DPW AND ISD GIVE AN UPDATE ON
RESTAURANT PATIOS AND THE PROCESS AND HOW ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED.
PATIOS HAVE BEEN DELAYED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AND WE HEARD SEVERAL
OTHER PATIOS ARE DELAYED FOR VARIOUS REASONS. GIVEN THE URGENCY,
HOW ARE WE CLEARING HURDLES FOR RESTAURANTS TO OPEN AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE. ONCE THE GOVERNOR SIGNAL THE START OF OUTDOOR DINING, I
HAVE A TEAM WHICH IS COORDINATED BY NELSON AND MY OFFICE, DPW,
INSPECTIONAL SERVICES, LAW, LINES AND TRAFFIC, WE HAVE RECEIVED 188
APPLICATIONS. NEW EXTENSIONS ON THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WAYS AS
WELL AS SPACE FOR APPROVED OUTDOOR AREAS. OF THOSE 39 NEW FROM
CALENDAR YEAR, 21 ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED IN A DIFFERENT
STAGE OF REVIEW. OUR AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME FROM APPLICATION

May 10, 2021

APPROVED FASTER. SOME WITHIN 24 HOURS.
PATIO APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN LONGER ARE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT
SUPPORTING PLANS OR DOCUMENTS FROM THE APPLICANT AS WELL AS
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE REQUESTING PLANS THAT ARE NOT
COMPLEMENTED WITH THE STATE OR CITY STANDARDS. DEPENDING ON THE
ISSUE, STAFF FROM DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS HAVE RESPONDING AT ALL
HOURS WHILE BEYOND REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.
OUR TEAM IS RESPONDING NIGHTS, WEEKENDS, AND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO
ACCOMMODATE THE RESTAURANTS. WE HAVE APPROVED THE USE WITH NO
ADDITIONAL FEE APPROXIMATELY 163 PARKING SPOTS ACROSS THE CITY FOR
OUTDOOR DINING. INCLUDING 115 METERED PARKING SPOTS. THE REST OF
THE SPACE ARE A COMBINATION OF LOADING ZONE, RESIDENT PARKING AND
UNRESTRICTED. WE HAVE INSTALLED 7515-MINUTE PICKUP SPACES
SUPPORTING BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS. WE HAVE ISSUED THIRD
SIDEWALK BUSINESS USE PERMITS AND INSTALLED OVER 145 JERSEY BARRIER
RESTAURANTS TO USE SEPARATE FROM THE SEATING ON THE ROADWAY.
COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASKED, WITH THE PANDEMIC CHANGING, MODES OF
TRANSIT AND COMMUNITY, DOES THE CITY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO
HAVE PLANNING TO ENSURE UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION FOR
IMPLEMENTATION OF BIKE PLAN AND ENHANCEMENT TO PUBLIC TRANSIT.
THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT REPORT THE FOLLOWING MONITOR SYSTEMS ARE
IN PLACE. MULTIMODAL TRAFFIC VOLUMES. WE HAVE DATA FROM 12 MILE
VISION COUNT STATIONS, INCLUDING COUNTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES,
PEDESTRIAN BIKES FOR OVER 18 MONTHS. KENDALL SQUARE GAVE A GOOD
INDICATION FOR TRENDS. BICYCLE RIDERSHIP IS STRONG AS A WAY OF
TRAVEL AROUND THE CITY AND SOCIALLY DISTANT WAY. THE
IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS TO BE COORDINATED WITH THE FIVE-YEAR
STREETS AND SIDEWALK PLAN. AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ARISE WITH
CONJUNCTION. WE WORKED WITH THE MBTA AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE
PASSENGER COUNTS. THEY SHARE INFORMATION ON CROWDING ROUTES,
CHANGING IMPACTS OF TRANSIT TRAVEL TIME. STAFF DISCUSS TRAFFIC
TRENDS WITH THE MBTA AND ADVOCATE FOR BRINGING BACK SERVE THAT
WERE CUT DURING THE PANDEMIC AS RIDERSHIP RETURNS. BLUE BIKES. WE
USE RIDERSHIP DATA AND PLANNING SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS. THE PUBLIC
OWNERSHIP OF BLUE BIKES, WE DO NOT -- DID NOT DECREASE THE LEVEL OF
SERVICE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND HAVE BEEN MONITORING RIDERSHIP
TO ENSURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT SERVICES IN THE HIGH-TRAFFIC AREAS.
PARKING, FROM THE PASSPORT SYSTEM, WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION AND
DOESN'T REPRESENT ALL PARKING ACTIVITY, IT IS A GOOD INDICATOR. STAFF
IS REGULARLY MONITORING SOURCES OF REGIONAL, ECONOMIC,
GOVERNMENTAL, EDUCATIONAL AND HOUSING REPORTS FOR UPDATES OF
ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS AND SITES OF PANDEMIC HAVE PROGRESSED. IN
ADDITION, THE KENDALL SQUARE ASSOCIATION IS WORKING WITH A
FOUNDATION TO DO ANOTHER SURVEY OF EMPLOYEE COMMUTING
ATTITUDES, SIMILAR TO THE SPRING OF 2020 TO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES
ON COMMUTE TRAVEL. STAFF IS PARTICIPATING IN THIS EFFORT. THIS

INCLUDES MY RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS TO THE COUNSELS. I ASK THE
RESIDENT TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND DON'T LET THE GUARD DOWN. WEAR
HIGH-QUALITY MASKS AND WHEN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR, WHEN UNABLE
TO SOCIAL DISTANCE. WASH HAPPENS, PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCE, LIMIT
GATHERINGS WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE. I WILL TURN IT OVER
TO CLAUDE TO ANSWER FINAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO
PROVIDE THIS WEEK'S COVID REPORT. I WILL MENTION, I'M HAVING ISSUES
WITH MY SIGNAL. I'M OFF CAMERA, BUT APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. I'M
JOINED BY DR. DOBBERTEEN AND WILL FIELD VERIFYING QUESTIONS. CAN
YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: BEFORE I SHARE THIS WEEK'S HIGHLIGHTS, I WILL REFLECT
ABOUT THE JOURNEY. JUST PICKING ON THE COMMENTS BY THE CITY
MANAGER, WE ARE IN THE 15 MONTH WHEN WE DECLARED A PUBLIC
HEALTH EMERGENCY IN THE CITY, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE
MITIGATION ACTIVITIES THAT THE CITY TOOK, THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR
PARTNERS OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. WITH THAT, WHAT YOU SEE IS THE
SUCCESS THAT WE HAD IN MITIGATING COVID-19 IN THE CITY, IT IS
REASONABLE TO CONSIDER THE CAMBRIDGE IS THE BEST PERFORMING CITY
AMONG THE CITIES OF OUR SIZE IN THE COMMONWEALTH. WE CALL
OURSELVES THE -- (AUDIO BREAKUP)... LAWRENCE, LOWELL, WORCESTER,
SPRINGFIELD, ET CETERA. CAMBRIDGE WAS THE FIRST CITY TO PROVIDE
ON-SITE SURVEILLANCE TESTING, OVER 2700 TESTS WERE CONDUCTED
DURING PRE-ROUNDS AND THINK ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, WE WENT
FURTHER TO COMMENCE TESTING IN ELDERLY FACILITIES, WE TESTED OVER
700 THIS MONTH. AND WE LAUNCHED A MOBILE TESTING PROGRAM IN THE
PORT NEIGHBORHOOD. I ACKNOWLEDGE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS WHO
BROUGHT UP THE OBSERVATION BASED ON WHAT WE SAW ABOUT THE HIGH
RATES OF COVID INFECTION FOR BLACK, LATINX, ET CETERA. AND WE STOOD
UP FOUR OTHER SITES OPERATING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK UNDER THE
CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE. AGAIN, THIS GOES BACK TO THE
LAST SUMMER AND FALL. ON NOVEMBER 1, WE LAUNCHED A
DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING PROGRAM OVER AT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE MALL
AND I THANK THEM. AND THROUGH THIS, YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN, WE
HAVE THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY HOMELESS SHELTER AT THE WAR
MEMORIAL AND WORKED WITH THE PARTNERS AT THE WARMING CENTER.
THANKS TO HUMAN SERVICES AND DID CARRY THE FORWARD THE PROJECT
TO SPAULDING HOSPITAL, WHERE WE HOUSE 60 RESIDENTS. ACKNOWLEDGE
THE STRONG COMMITMENT BY THE CITY. I WILL PROVIDE A SNAPSHOT OF
WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE GROUND, INCLUDING OUTREACH EFFORTS. WE
ARE CLOSING IN THE TEN MONTH OF HAVING NEIGHBORHOOD
AMBASSADORS TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF. WE HAVE ONE PERSON
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. (ECHO IN THE BACKGROUND). IS THAT ME
ECHOING? THAT'S NOT ME.

May 10, 2021

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: IT IS USUALLY WHEN CLAUDE IS ON TWICE. I
THINK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT IS NOT ME. JAMES WILLIAMSON IS ON. I DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO WAIT FOR THE WHOLE PRESENTATION. WE'LL GO TO JAMES
AND THEN CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. NAOMI, I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU.
>> JAMES. GO AHEAD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. IF YOU CAN UNMUTE
YOURSELF AGAIN, YOU DO HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: Déjà vu. HE LOOKS UNMUTED. IT LOOKS MUTED. I
DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN HEAR US. JAMES, CAN YOU UNMUTE YOURSELF OR
TRY? (SILENCE). ALL RIGHT. THIS IS UNFORTUNATE. AND FRUSTRATING. I'M
NOT SURE WHAT IS HAPPENING. I THOUGHT HE WAS HERE. I THINK HE IS
HERE. WE CAN'T -- SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. WHAT WE'LL DO, WE'LL GO
BACK TO THE PRESENTATION. LET ME... GIVE IT A MINUTE. ONE SECOND,
CLAUDE. SORRY ABOUT THAT. IF HE DOES COME BACK ON, I WANT TO SEE IF
-- JAMES, CAN YOU HEAR US? DARN. THERE'S SOMETHING UP. IT LOOKS
UNMUTED. JAMES? NOBODY HEARS ANYTHING, RIGHT? YOU CAN CONFIRM
THAT? (SILENCE)
JAMES? ALL RIGHT. IT IS NOT WORKING. I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER NUMBER
THAT CALLED IN. IS THAT JAMES? THE HAND IS UP.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE YOU ARE.
>> PARTICIPANT: WHAT A NIGHTMARE. I REALLY WISH THIS COULD BE
ADDRESSED. THANK YOU. SORRY TO INTERRUPT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR
PATIENCE. JAMES, 1000 JACKSON PLACE. A MOUNTAIN OF MATERIAL ABOUT
THE MASS AVENUE BIKE -- I WILL CALL IT THE BIKE CORRIDOR. I WANT TO
SPEAK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF MY EXPERIENCE OVER MANY YEARS TAKING
THE NUMBER ONE BUS ALONG THE MASS AVENUE CORRIDOR. AND HOW THE
WAY IN WHICH THE -- HOW TO DESCRIBE IT ADVANCING AN AGENDA
AROUND SEPARATED BIKE LANES HAS THE -- THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC TRANSIT.
IT BEGINS WITH A STORY ABOUT HARVARD SQUARE. THE NUMBER ONE BUS
IN HARVARD SQUARE WAS UP NEAR THE HARVARD STATION. ONE PRINCIPLE
IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS CONNECTIVITY.
WHAT HAPPENED SOME YEARS AGO, THAT NUMBER ONE BUS WAS PUSHED
BACK TO OPPOSITE IN FRONT OF MKEEN GATE. THAT IS A REALLY LONG
DISTANCE FROM HARVARD STATION. AND IT IS VERY DISCONCERTING TO
COME AROUND THE CORNER AT HARVARD SQUARE, WAY OFF IN THE
DISTANCE, SEE THE NUMBER ONE BUS, AND WORRY IF YOU WILL MAKE IT
BEFORE IT PULLS AWAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS DONE TO ACCOMMODATE
PARKING METERS THAT WERE MOVED -- THERE ARE SIX METERED SPACES IN
FRONT OF THE BUS. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS TO ACCOMMODATE METER
SPACES TO ACCOMMODATE TOUR BUSES ON MOUNT AUBURN. IT WAS
EXPLAINED TO ME IT WAS DONE TO ACCOMMODATE A BIKE LANE. WHERE
BICYCLISTS DON'T CONSIDER A BIKE LANE. GO FIGURE. BICYCLISTS DON'T
CONSIDER IT A BIKE LANE. TRAVEL LANE WAS ELIMINATED IN HARVARD


PAGE 6

May 10, 2021

SQUARE RECENTLY AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAYBE CORRECT THAT
SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE
RIGHT-OF-WAY. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. DOWN BY MIT, THE
RECONFIGURATION OF TRAVEL LANES TO ACCOMMODATE SEPARATED BIKE
LANE SLOWED DOWN THE NUMBER ONE BUS. IN FRONT OF MASS AND
MAIN, A SEPARATED BIKE LANE WAS INTRODUCED AT THE TIME IT WAS
DESCRIBED AS A PILOT OR A POP-UP AND THERE WOULD BE FURTHER PUBLIC
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. IT NEVER HAPPENED. IT WAS ROLLED INTO THE
MITIGATION PLAN FOR MASS AND MAIN. I KNOW IT IS NOW MANDATORY TO
DO ALL THIS STUFF, THAT'S THE NEW LINGO. IS IT MANDATORY TO BUG THE
PUBLIC TRANSIT AS THE BIKE IS PUSHED MORE AGGRESSIVELY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. I THINK THAT'S ALL
WHO SIGNED UP. ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO CLOSE PUBLIC
COMMENT, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: MAYOR? FOUR MORE MINUTES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SPOKE TOO FAST. WE'LL GO BACK TO THE
PRESENTATION, CLAUDE. THANK YOU.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THANK YOU. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, YOU HAVE THE
WEEKLY SNAPSHOT. YOU SEE ON THE SLIDE, LAST WEEK, CAMBRIDGE MOVED
FROM BEING A MODERATE RISK LEVEL COMMUNITY TO A LOW RISK GREEN
LEVEL COMMUNITY. I WILL THANK AND APPLAUD THE CITY'S LEADERSHIP,
THE MANAGER AND ALL THE PARTNERS FOR HELPING US. WE SHOULD BE
PROUD OF THIS AND KNOW OUR PERFORMANCE IS NOT BY ACCIDENT. WE
HAVE TALENTED STAFF, INCREDIBLE PARTNERS AND REALLY DR. ASSAAD
SAYAH AND THE CITY MANAGER IS RELENTLESS IN MAKING SURE WE STAY
THE COURSE. WITH THAT SAID, WE ARE STILL AT 6,100 REPORTED CASES.
THE SLIDE SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO REFLECT 123 REPORTED DEATHS AS
REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. THAT HAPPENED LATE IN THE DAY TODAY
SADLY. WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE
WITH THE FAMILY. KEEP IN MIND, OUR OVERALL POSITIVITY AS REPORTED BY
DPH IS AT ABOUT A THIRD OF 1%. AND KNOW, THE NUMBER OF DAILY
CONFIRMED CASES, IT IS DROPPED BY MORE THAN HALF FROM APRIL 1, THEY
LOOK BETTER AND BETTER WITH EACH WEEK. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PAST
SATURDAY, FOR THE PAST WEEK, WE HAD 28 NEW CONFIRMED CASES,
WHICH TRANSLATES TO ABOUT 3.4 PER HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS.
WE DO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO GET
VACCINATED AND NOT TO LET UP ON MASK WEARING INDOORS, PHYSICAL
DISTANCING, AND PRACTICING GOOD HAND HYGIENE.
I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE A QUESTION POSED BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN. WHAT
HAS THE CITY LEARNED ABOUT NEW VARIANTS AND HOW THAT MIGHT
AFFECT FUTURE NEED FOR BOOSTER VACCINATIONS? AS I SHARED BEFORE,
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR VARIANTS OF CONCERN, STATEWIDE AND HERE.
THE VARIANT WE WATCH CLOSELY IS THE VARIANT B.1.1.7, IT IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR 44% OF CASES NATIONWIDE. OF THE 18 KNOWN VARIANTS REPORTED
HERE IN CAMBRIDGE, 12 ARE OF THE VARIANT B.1.1.7. AND I WILL REMIND
YOU, ALL THREE VACCINES ARE PROTECTIVE AGAINST THE VARIANT B.1.1.7,

PAGE 7

May 10, 2021

WITH PFIZER AND MODERNA PROVIDING THE BEST PROTECTION. THEY ARE
ACTIVITY WORKING ON VACCINE FORMULATION AGAINST OTHER VARIANTS,
SUCH AS THE VARIANT B.1.351 OR VARIANT P.1. COUPLE OF THINGS, THE
BOOSTER SHOTS COULD BE USED TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST VARIANTS AS
WELL AS WANING IMMUNITY AND KEEP IN MIND, DECISIONS REGARDING THE
NEED FOR BOOSTERS WON'T BE MADE AT OUR LEVEL, THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL,
BUT BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AS WELL AS
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. NEXT SLIDE.
COMMUNITY TESTING. WE PROVIDE THIS SNAPSHOT EACH WEEK. TESTING
CONTINUES TO DECLINE AS IT HAS. MORE CAMBRIDGE TEENS AND ADULTS
ARE VACCINATED, THIS DECLINE IS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AS I SAID, THE CITY
IS MAINTAINING FOR NOW THE SEVEN-DAY A WEEK TESTING PROGRAM.
WITH UPCOMING GRADUATION, WARMER WEATHER, THEY HAVE MORE
GET-TOGETHERS, THIS IS A REMINDER TO MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL OF TESTING
WHILE ADJUSTING STAFFING AND LOGISTICS. WE HAVE FOUR SITES SEVEN
DAYS A WEEK AND LOOKING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BY THE END OF THE
MONTH. WE'LL REPORT BACK.
AS A REMINDER, APRIL 27, THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT
MASSACHUSETTS WILL REOPEN SOME OUTDOOR PHASE FOUR, STEP TWO
INDUSTRIES. BEGINNING TODAY, MAY 10. AND THESE ARE HIGHLIGHTS OF
THE CHANGES. AMUSEMENT PARKS AND OTHER OUTDOOR INDUSTRIES ARE
ABLE TO OPEN AT 50% CAPACITY. YOUTH AND ADULT AMATEUR SPORT
TOURNAMENTS. ROAD RACES AND OTHER LARGE OUTDOOR EVENTS WILL
HAVE STAGGERED STARTS AND SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE. AND SINGING
INDOOR WITH STRICT DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS AT PERFORMANCE VENUES,
RESTAURANTS, ET CETERA. THE VIEWING AUDIENCE, THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE IS STILL REMAINING AT PHASE FOUR, STEP ONE, UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE AND DIDN'T MOVE AHEAD WITH THE CHANGES AND WILL REPORT
BACK IN TERMS OF ADJUSTMENTS.
NEXT SLIDE. MASSACHUSETTS RANKS THIRD IN THE NATION FOR PERSONS
HAVING RECEIVED ONE PLUS DOSES ADMINISTERED PER CAPITA. WE
REPORTED LAST WEEK WE WERE NUMBER TWO. WE ARE NOW NUMBER
THREE. ON MAY 1, THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THE OPENING OF THE
METRO NORTH VACCINE PARTNERSHIP. A CONSORTIUM OF NINE CITIES,
INCLUDING THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE AND TUFTS UNIVERSITY AS
THE ANCHOR ORGANIZATIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE CITY MANAGER AND
THE ADVOCACY FOR MAKING SURE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE MAYOR AND
THE REPRESENTATIVE BECKER TO MAKE SURE THIS DID TAKE PLACE. THE
PARTNERSHIP S SITES ARE OPEN AND FULLY OPERATIONAL IN SOMERVILLE,
MEDFORD, AND EVERETT. THEY ALLOW WALK-IN AND THOUGH
APPOINTMENTS ARE ENCOURAGED. THE THREE SITES OFFER BOTH
MODERNA AND PFIZER VACCINES. VACCINE TEENS WHO ARE 16 AND
17-YEAR-OLDS. NEXT SLIDE.
REGARDING OUR CITY-LEVEL VACCINE UPDATE. AS OF SATURDAY, OVER 4,000
PEOPLE HAD RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF MODERNA OR SINGLE SHOT
OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. VICE MAYOR MALLON POSED A QUESTION, I WILL


PAGE 8

May 10, 2021

READ -- TWO QUESTIONS. WHAT HAS THE COUNT BEEN AT SUBSEQUENT
CLINICS FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON HOLD ON MAY 5 AND 7. IS THIS MORE OR
LESS THAN YOU ANTICIPATED? HAVE THERE BEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
MODERNA OR PFIZER BE THE PREFERRED OPTION IF THE COUNTS ARE LESS
THAN EXPECTED? AGAIN, WE ARE MONITORING NATIONWIDE TRENDS, JUST
KNOW, THE CITY-RUN VACCINE CLINIC THIS PAST SATURDAY AT RESERVOIR
CHURCH, OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEK, WE ADMINISTERED 450 DOSES OF
THE SINGLE SHOT OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. WE ARE PLEASED AT THE CLINIC
NUMBERS INCREASED AT THE FIRST CLINIC THANKS TO THE PUSH FROM THE
CITY AND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CORPS IN
COLLABORATION WITH THE STATEWIDE PARTNERS. WE HAVEN'T TABULATED
THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, WE CAN TELL YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, LAST
WEDNESDAY, WE DOCUMENTED OVER 85% -- 83% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAD
SOME LINK TO CAMBRIDGE WELL, THEY WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE OR
RESIDENTS. OVER 60% WERE RESIDENTS. WE KNOW THAT ABOUT 40% OF
THE CLINIC WERE LESS THAN THE AGE OF 40. AND WE NOTICE A PATTERN
THAT MOSTLY MEN THAT CAME TO THAT CLINIC. WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR MESSAGING AND OUTREACH. WE ARE NOT SEEING
THE FOOT TRAFFIC WHEN WE FIRST STARTED VACCINATING, WE ARE
REACHING A POINT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, MOST PEOPLE ARE EAGER
TO GET VACCINATED AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY MAY HAVE ALREADY
DONE SO. WE ARE EXPLORING A NUMBER OF OPTIONS WITH PARTNERS AT
PRO-EMS, CAMBRIDGE FIRE, THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, TO BE SURE
NOT A DOSE IS WASTED. YOU SEE HERE, WE HAD DROP-IN AND THIS IS STATE
REPRESENTATIVE OWENS WITH STAFF, MIKE DONOVAN FROM THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS OUR ASSOCIATE CHIEF OF CLINICAL SERVICES. OUR
STAFF, PARTNERS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
WE CONTINUE ON OUR QUEST TO CONDUCT TARGETED OUTREACH TO
NEIGHBORHOODS, COMMUNITIES, AND RESIDENTS THROUGH
COMMUNICATIONS, FORUMS. AND I THANK THE MAYOR FOR HELPING
AMPLIFY THE MESSAGING THROUGH THE OFFICE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THE CITY MANAGER'S SUPPORT AND HIS STAFF FOR MAKING SURE WE GET
THE WORD OUT, WHETHER IT IS ROBOCALLS OR ANYTHING ELSE TO NOTIFY
RESIDENTS.
BEFORE I MOVE ON, MAYOR SIDDIQUI ASKED, HOW IS CPH -- THE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT THINKING ABOUT VACCINATION FOR 12-15-YEAR-OLDS? LET
ME JUST SAY, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF ELIGIBLE TEAMS
WILL GET THEIR PFIZER VACCINE FROM SOME LOCAL PHARMACIES OR ONE OF
THE NEW METRO NORTH REGIONAL SITES, SOMERVILLE OR MEDFORD. OUR
DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITH THE METRO NORTH REGIONAL
COLLABORATIVE ON ALL OPTIONS FOR WHEN IT IS APPROVED FOR SUCH USE.
I BELIEVE IT OCCURRED EARLIER TODAY AND I WILL ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN TO
COMMENT AFTER THIS PRESENTATION. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT
OUR DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO VACCINATE 12-15-YEAR-OLDS, WE'LL CONDUCT
VERY TARGETED OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS FOCUSSED ON
PARENTS THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND VENUES. NEXT SLIDE.
SO, THIS IS THE NEXT FEW SLIDES SHOW THE PROGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO


PAGE 9

May 10, 2021

VACCINATION RATES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. AS OF MAY 4, YOU HEARD
FROM THE CITY MANAGER, 62% OF RESIDENTS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE
OF VACCINE, INCLUDING THE SINGLE SHOT OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. AND
OVER A THIRD -- 38% ARE FULLY VACCINATED. THE DATA COME DIRECTLY
FROM THE STATE'S WEEKLY COVID-19 MUNICIPALITY VACCINATION REPORT.
WITH REGARD TO RACE AND ETHNICITY, CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO
OUTPACE THE STATE FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF ASIAN, BLACK, HISPANIC, AND
WHITE RESIDENT WHO RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE.
EACH CATEGORY INCREASE BY 2-5% POINTS FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK. THIS
SLIDE DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC CATEGORIES
PROVIDED IN THE STATE'S DATE AND NOTABLY OVER 5,800 RESIDENTS IN THE
OTHER AND UNKNOWN CATEGORY RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF
VACCINE. AGAIN, LIKE TO THANK THE CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC
COLLABORATIVE TEAM, THE MAYOR, AND OTHER PARTNERS FOR THE
ONGOING GRASSROOTS OPTION TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE VACCINE.
WITH THIS, WITH THE PREVIOUS SLIDE, CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO OUTPACE
THE STATE IN EVERY CATEGORY IN PROPORTION OF TEENS AND ADULTS BY
AGE AND GENDER. RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE. WE
DIDN'T SEE ANY BIG JUMPS IN ANY AGE GROUP OR BY GENDER THIS WEEK.
WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE MODEST INCREASES AMONG ALL RESIDENTS,
ESPECIALLY THOSE 16-19. NEXT SLIDE.
REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS. I'LL WRAP UP. THE CITY CONDUCTED A
MULTIFACETED OUTREACH TO ADVERTISE RESERVOIR CHURCH. THIS
INCLUDED CITY-WIDE CODE RED CALLS EMAILS, TEXTS, AND
COMMUNICATIONS SENT TO THE FAITH COMMUNITY, THROUGH THE MY
BROTHER'S KEEPER, RESTAURANTS -- NOTICE TO CITY EMPLOYEES AND THE
PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEES OF THE
CAMBRIDGESIDE SMALL. AND AT THE MALL AND DANEHY PARK TO GET THE
WORD OUT. WE'LL CONTINUE THE COMMUNICATIONS BASED ON THE
DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND KEEP IN MIND IT WILL INCLUDE ROBUST
COMMUNICATION AROUND THE PFIZER VACCINE FOR THOSE 12-15 NOW
THAT WE RECEIVED WORD ABOUT THE APPROVAL. AND ONE LAST REMINDER
AT THE BOTTOM, A CORRECTION THAT WE ARE HOLDING TWO SPEAKER
BUREAUS. ONE IS HELD FOR THE HAITIAN COMMUNITY AND SHOULD READ
MAY 19TH. WEDNESDAY MAY 19TH. AND THAT IS HELD IN HAITIAN CREOLE
AND ONE IN SPANISH, HELD ON THURSDAY, MAY 27. AND WE'LL MAKE THAT
CORRECTION AND GET THAT OUT TO FOLKS. LAST SLIDE.
AS I TRY TO END THE WEEKLY REPORT AND SHARE AN ANECDOTE BEHIND THE
NUMBERS. THIS IS NATIONAL NURSES WEEK AND BEING CELEBRATED MAY
6-12. IT IS FITTING FOR ME TO RECOGNIZE AND HONOR THIS NURSE AND ALL
NURSES. JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WORK BEFORE AND AFTER THE
PANDEMIC. THIS EXCERPT ON THE SLIDE IS PART OF THE SALUTE TO NURSES
FEATURE THAT WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY, SUNDAY NIGHT, IN THE "BOSTON
GLOBE". I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BAM
FAMILY IS EXPERIENCING A DEVASTATING LOSS AT THIS TIME, INCLUDING


PAGE 10

May 10, 2021

WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT IN INDIA, NEPAL, AND BRAZIL. IT WILL REMIND US
WE ARE ALL CONNECTED. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE MY APPRECIATION FOR
SHAMSHER AND ALL PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND SCHOOL NURSES, IN OUR
DEPARTMENT. THE STAFF THAT WORKED TIRELESSLY, SELFLESSLY, AND WITH
PASSING THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
I HAVE SEEN WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF VACCINE. HE HELPED TO
CONDUCT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CONTACT TRACING. WORKING WITH
STATE-LEVEL PARTNERS AND CONTINUES TO WORK, IN ADDITION TO THE DAY
JOB, WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE CITY'S TUBERCULOSIS CLINIC AT THE
HOSPITAL CAMPUS. HE IS AS HUMBLE AS THEY COME. A QUIET STORM AND
QUIET AND UNKNOWN HERO. I THANK TRACY FOR SUBMITTING THIS
NOMINATION TO THE "BOSTON GLOBE" AND HOW IT WAS REFLECTED AND
AMPLIFIED BY THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE. NO MATTER HOW TIRED
AND SPENT THE TEAM IS, THEY BRING THEIR BEST SELVES EVERY DAY TO HELP
PROTECT RESIDENTS. I WILL STOP. THIS IS A LONGER REPORT, I WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK OUR CLINICAL TEAM, CELEBRATING NATIONAL
NURSES WEEK AND KEEPING THE BAM FAMILY AND OTHERS IN THE
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AS WE STILL DEAL WITH THE REALITIES OF
COVID-19. THAT CONCLUDES MY REPORT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. ECHO YOUR SENTIMENTS -- WE HAVE TO
MUTE CLAUDE. I ECHO YOUR SENTIMENTS ABOUT THE WHOLE TEAM. IT IS A
PRIVILEGE TO KNOW THEM AND SEE AN IMPORTANT WORK THEY ARE DOING.
IT IS A GREAT TEAM. INCLUDING MIKE DONOVAN FROM FIRE. THEY ALL
MAKE A FIERCE TEAM. I HAVE SEEN IT IN ACTION. WE'LL OPEN UP TO
QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL. WE'LL START WITH VICE MAYOR MALLON
AND THEN GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. TO MR. JACOB AND THE TEAMS, I
ECHO THE THANKS TO ALL YOUR TEAM FOR PUTTING ON THE EFFORT TO GET
THE RESIDENTS VACCINATED. IT SHOWS IN THE NUMBERS. I WANT TO
QUICKLY ASK, I KNOW YOU SPOKE TO THE 12-15-YEAR-OLDS, IT WAS
APPROVED TODAY. IT WAS APPROVED FOR THE PFIZER VACCINE FOR
12-15-YEAR-OLDS. THERE'S A LOT OF PARENTS RIGHT NOW WHO WONDER
WHERE TO BRING THE CHILDREN TOMORROW TO BE VACCINATED. I WILL
FOLLOW UP, THE SOMERVILLE LOCATION, AND MEDFORD, THEY ARE
AVAILABLE FOR WALK-UP. DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR
WALK-UP FOR PFIZER FOR 12-15-YEAR-OLDS? TOMORROW? IS THERE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU, VICE MAYOR MALLON. THANK YOU,
CLAUDE. THE FDA APPROVED THE VACCINE TODAY. THE ADVISORY
COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES WILL BE MEETING ON
WEDNESDAY. AT THE TIME, THEY WILL ISSUE THE FINAL APPROVAL FOR
12-15-YEAR-OLD AND EVERYBODY EXPECTS IT WILL COME THROUGH. ONCE
THAT IS THROUGH, THEN THERE WILL BE ACTIVE PLANNING AND
ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT WHEN 12-15-YEAR-OLDS WILL BE ACCEPTED AT

ANY OF THE METRO NORTH COLLABORATIVE SITES.
RELATED TO THIS, ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PLANNING WITH THE METRO
NORTH COLLABORATIVE ON AN EFFORT TO TARGET CAMBRIDGE RINDGE AND
LATIN STUDENTS AND WE SHOULD HAVE NEWS ABOUT THAT. VERY EXCITING
TIME AND PARENTS JUST HANG ON A BIT LONGER AND WE'LL GET THE SHOTS
IN YOUR KIDS ARMS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THERE'S AN ANXIOUS GROUP OF
PEOPLE AWAITING THAT MEETING ON WEDNESDAY AND ANY GUIDANCE YOU
HAVE AS SOON AS IT IS AVAILABLE. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE
ABOUT THE CRLS INTERVENTION AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. THANKS
TO THE TEAM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE. THANKS. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: MY THANKS TO THE CITY MANAGER AND
STAFF FOR THE UPDATES. AND ALL THEIR HARD WORK. I SEE THE NUMBERS
AND CASE COUNTS COMING DOWN, WHICH IS REALLY GREAT NEWS. OF
COURSE, IT IS TRAGIC THAT WE STILL LOST SOMEONE, BUT THAT'S TO BE
EXPECT ED THAT THE DEATH WILL ALWAYS TRAIL THE SURGE. WE'RE STILL
SEEING REALLY LOW NUMBERS AND LOW TRANSMISSIONS. I'M CERTAINLY
COMFORTABLE WITH CHANGES WE MADE TO THE OUTDOOR MASK
MANDATE. I'M GLAD WE ARE STAYING IN PHASE FOUR, STEP ONE. I WANT
TO ASK THE EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL RECOMMENDATION, THEY
RECOMMENDED TWO OUT OF THREE BEHAVIORS, AVOID INDOOR
GATHERINGS, MAINTAIN SAFE DISTANCE, AND USE AN EFFECTIVE MASK. I
WONDER IF WE PLAN TO ADOPT THAT MESSAGING? IT SEEMS REALLY GOOD
AND HELPFUL.
I THINK WE PROBABLY WILL NEED TO BE CONTINUING TO WEAR MASKS TO
SOME DEGREE FOR QUITE SOME TIME TO COME. AND DR. FAUCI MADE
SOME REMARKS WHERE WE MAY WANT TO CONTINUE MASK WEARING
DURING FLU SEASON BECAUSE THE FLU CASES AND DEATHS HAVE BEEN
REALLY LOW BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE TO COVID. I'M JUST WONDERING IF
WE ARE PLANNING TO FOLLOW THAT ADVICE FROM THE EXPERT ADVISORY
PANEL?
>> CITY MANAGER: CLAUDE, YOU WANT TO START?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: I WILL TAKE THAT. JUST ACKNOWLEDGING, THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF CAMPAIGNS BEING LAUNCHED BY THE CDC, CENTERS FOR
DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, THAT IS BEING ONE. TRYING TO GAUGE
HOW WELL THAT CAMPAIGN IS ANCHORING AND OVERLAID IN THE
COMMONWEALTH. WE HAVEN'T MADE THE DECISION ABOUT AMPLIFYING
THE CAMPAIGN AS OF YET. WE ARE MAKING SURE TO PAY ATTENTION TO
HOW WE CAN BECOME BETTER AT MESSAGING THIS HERE LOCALLY. WE
HAVE SEEN WITH OUR CHANGES TO THE MASK ORDER, FOLKS BY AND LARGE,
THEY HAVE BEEN IN COMPLIANCE IS WHAT WE OBSERVED AS WE EYE-BALL IT.
THANK YOU, BUT WE HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION AT THIS TIME. WE ARE
AWARE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND REPORT
BACK THROUGH THE CITY MANAGER AND THE COUNCIL.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT

PAGE 12

May 10, 2021

THE SCHOOLS. I DID SEE WE ARE GOING TO FULL ATTENDANCE TODAY. DOES
THAT MEAN STUDENTS CAN NO LONGER PARTICIPATE ONLINE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO. WE HAVE ABOUT 47% OF THE HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENTS WHO ARE IN-PERSON AND THE REST ARE REMOTE. THE REMOTE
OPTION IS ALIVE AND WELL. AS YOU MAY KNOW, A LOT OF DISTRICTS AT THE
HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND DIFFERENT VARIOUS LEVELS ARE NOT OPEN. WE
STILL NEED ACCOMMODATIONS FOR TEACHERS WHO NEED TO BE REMOTE
AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE GIVEN STUDENTS THAT OPTION AS WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GREAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SORRY. THANK YOU. IT IS VERY EXCITING TO BE IN
THIS POSITION TO BE SEEING THE OPENING UP. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON
THE QUESTION THAT VICE MAYOR MALLON ASKED AND COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. FOLLOW UP ON STUDENTS. I'M EXCITED AND THAT IS
WONDERFUL TO BE REACH OUT TO CRLS. I HOPE WE REACH OUT -- 20% OF
THE STUDENTS GOING TO EITHER -- COUPLE OF INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS IN
CAMBRIDGE. WE HAVE TWO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLS IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M
CURIOUS TO MAKE SURE WE REACH OUT TO THEM AS WELL. AND FOR ALL OF
THE STUDENTS IN THAT AGE GROUP, CAN WE TAKE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO ENSURE THEIR PARENTS ARE VACCINATED. IT WOULD REALLY BE
INCUMBENT ON US TO MAKE SURE IF THE PARENTS ARE NOT, IT IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE GROUP OF RESIDENTS HAS ACCESS TO THE
VACCINE. I KNOW THIS IS CAMBRIDGE, CERTAINLY BOTH COMMUNITY
CHARTER SCHOOL OF CAMBRIDGE HAVE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN OTHER
CITIES WHO MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING ACCESS AND SUCH
COMMUNICATION TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE NO APPOINTMENT
WALK-IN VACCINE APPOINTMENT. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THAT IS
PART OF THE PLAN TO WORK WITH THAT LARGER COMMUNITY TO MAKE
SURE WE GET THE VACCINATION NUMBERS UP AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE.
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: THANK YOU. WE'LL WORK WITH ALL -- WE
ALWAYS CONSIDER THE HEALTH OF ALL STUDENTS IN ALL SCHOOLS IN
CAMBRIDGE. WE'LL LOOK AT IT ALL CAREFULLY. WE CERTAINLY WILL DIRECT
PARENTS TO THE COLLABORATIVE SITES BECAUSE IT IS ALL DEPENDENT ON
VACCINE AVAILABILITY AND HOW MUCH WE HAVE. AND I GUESS I'D LOVE TO
VACCINATE EVERYBODY, ALL STUDENTS BRING THEIR FAMILIES, I DON'T THINK
WE'LL HAVE THE CAPACITY IN VACCINE NUMBERS TO DO THAT. WE CAN DO A
NICE EDUCATIONAL PUSH AT THE SAME TIME AND SEND PARENTS TO ANY OF
THE COLLABORATIVE SITES. IT MAY WORK FOR SOME OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF
SOME OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS BETTER. WE'LL THINK ABOUT
THEM ALL.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. I SEE NO OTHER
QUESTIONS, SO WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON CLOSING PUBLIC COMMENT
ALONG WITH PLACING CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM ONE AND
COMMUNICATION REPORTS -- CITY OFFICERS NUMBER ONE ON FILE. CLERK

PAGE 13

May 10, 2021

WILSON?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM FIVE.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 5)

Motion to close public
comment, place City Manager
Agenda #1 and
Communications and Report
from other City Officers #1 on
file

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO THE CITY
MANAGER FOR PROVIDING THIS REPORT. THE REPORT ON BUDGET
REALLOCATIONS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR. I DID HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. I'M WONDERING IF THE MANAGER WANTED TO
SPEAK TO IT IN GENERAL AND THEN WE CAN HAVE SOME SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK WE REALLY FELT IF WE HELD SOME POSITIONS IN
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, IT WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE POSITIONS THE
COUNCIL HAD CONCERNS WITH. WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF COVID. WE
MONITOR THE BUDGET CLOSELY AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU DON'T FILL
POSITIONS, IT WILL ALLOW US TO TAKE CARE OF THE LOSSES WE FACE IN
REVENUE. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE
POSITIONS THAT THE COUNCIL ASKED US TO LOOK AT THAT WERE GOING TO
BE HELD UNTIL APRIL TO HAVE THEM MOVE UP. AS YOU SEE THIS LIST, WE
HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB TRYING TO GET THE POSITIONS MOVING. THERE'S A
STRATEGY, WITH THE COVID INFORMATION, WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING AND
ALL OF THAT TO MAKE SURE THE NEW STAFF MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO
COME INTO WORK. IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH.
I'M PLEASED WITH WHERE WE ARE AT AND WE'LL MONITOR IT. BE HAPPY TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. LOOKING AT THE LIST, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE FIRST HIRE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE WAS IN DECEMBER?
DECEMBER OF 2020?
>> CITY MANAGER: HOUSING LIAISON POSITION. CORRECT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: IT LOOKS LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE FOUR
PEOPLE. THEN THE OTHER POSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN HIRED YET OR FILLED?
>> CITY MANAGER: MOST ARE IN THE PROCESS. WE HAVE TRIED TO -- WITH
THE COVID RESTRICTIONS ON CAPACITY, WE HAVE BEEN LIMITED BETWEEN -THE STATE SAYS 50, WE STAY BETWEEN -- WE SLOW IT DOWN AND EVERY
ONE IS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD NOW.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WE'RE
NOT SHOWING WE ARE DELAYED UNTIL APRIL AND THE OTHER ONE, WE CAN
HIRE THE OTHER ONE SOONER, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HIRE TWO PEOPLE. ONE
IN DECEMBER, ONE IN JANUARY, AND THE OTHERS ARE MARCH AND APRIL.
WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE DELAYED POSITIONS. IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE THEM.
>> CITY MANAGER: TO BE HONEST, WE HAVEN'T HIRED ANY OF THE DELAYED
POSITIONS OTHER THAN THESE. IT HAS DELAYED THE HIRING PROCESS,
BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL POSITION, BECAUSE OF THE COVID SANCTIONS


PAGE 14

May 10, 2021

ON HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING. WE HAD A PERMANENT FREEZE
ON FILLING ANY -- I WILL SAY 36 NEW POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET, EXCEPT FOR
THESE. THESE ARE THE ONLY ONES WE HAVE MOVED ON. THAT'S WHY THEY
ARE FUNDED IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. WE HAVE NOW STARTED THE
PROCESS TO LOOK AT THESE AND WE'LL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO
LOOK AT THE END OF THE MONTH. IT IS REALLY A HOLD ON ALL POSITIONS,
UP UNTIL ABOUT A MONTHS AGO WHEN WE STARTED TO OPEN UP. DAVID IS
THE POINT PERSON TO FILL POSITIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTS TO ADD
ANYTHING. IT IS A FINANCIAL BALANCE. COVID BALANCE. CAPACITY AND
TRYING TO GET POSITIONS FILLED. DAVID?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU ARE MUTED.
>> DAVID: CLEARLY, WE HAVE BEEN STRATEGIC IN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
FILLING. CLEARLY, INSPECTIONAL SERVICES HAD VACANCIES AND WE
WORKED TO FILL THEM JUST BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD
INSPECTORS AVAILABLE DURING THIS TIME TO HELP US WITH
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARTICULAR REGULATIONS AND ORDERS. THERE
HAS BEEN SOME POSITIONS FILLED. AGAIN, THERE'S A COMPLICATION WITH
ON-BOARDING NEW EMPLOYEES. I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO
POST MORE POSITIONS AND BE MORE STRATEGIC. A GOOD CHUNK OF THE
FISCAL YEAR WE WERE NOT FILLING POSITIONS JUST BECAUSE OF THE THINGS
THAT THE MANAGER MENTIONED A FEW MINUTES AGO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANKS. I THINK ONE CONCERN IS THAT WITH
THE HOUSING LIAISON OFFICE, THE HIRES STARTING IN DECEMBER, IT IS THE
STATE LIFTED THE EVICTION MORATORIUM, WE NOW LOOK AT THE CDC
MORATORIUM BEING VACATED BY THE SUPREME COURT. WE DON'T HAVE
THE EXTRA CAPACITY THAT WE NEED IN THE MULTISERVICE CENTER.
CERTAINLY, I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES FROM COVID
TO THE BUDGET AND TO THE HIRING PROCESS. IT STILL FEELS TO ME LIKE WE
WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCELERATE THE HIRES VERY MUCH. UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED DURING THIS
CHALLENGING TIME.
>> CITY MANAGER: I DISAGREE WITH THE SUPPORT WE NEED. MAURA AND
HER OFFICE HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL. I THINK THE MULTISERVICE CENTER
HAS STEPPED BEYOND WHAT WE COULD IMAGINE. AND MAYBE MAURA CAN
ADDRESS SOME OF THIS. ARE THOSE POSITIONS, ONE IN IS IN PLACE, ONE
WILL BE IN PLACE IN TWO WEEKS, AND I DON'T THINK WE MISSED A BEAT. I
KNOW I HAVE TALKED TO MAURA ABOUT QUESTIONS WITH THE BUDGET. I
DON'T KNOW IF MAURA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: POINT OF INFORMATION, THE COVID-19 EVICTION
DIVERSION INITIATIVE, THROUGH THAT, THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY THROUGH
THE STATE THAT WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NONPROFIT LEGAL AIDE PROVIDERS
TO HIRE ATTORNEYS, TO HIRE CAPACITY. I THINK IF YOU LOOK -- MAURA CAN
GO INTO IT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THERE ARE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS
WITH MULTISERVICE CENTER, WITH THE LEGAL AID, GREATER BOSTON LEGAL
SERVICES TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS FALLING THROUGH AND IF
THERE WERE FINANCIAL ISSUES, THERE WAS THIS -- A LOT OF RANGE OF

PAGE 15

May 10, 2021

RESOURCES THAT HAVE EXISTED THROUGHOUT THIS TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF
MAURA HAS MORE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ALL-HANDS ON DECK WITH
WHAT IS HAPPENING.
>> CITY MANAGER: MAURA OR ELLEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD
ANYTHING?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK I SEE ELLEN.
>> ELLEN: SURE. I WOULD SAY THAT WE FIRST THE AMOUNT OF WORK -- I
DON'T THINK WE HAVE TURNED AWAY ANY CLIENTS AT ALL FROM THE
MULTISERVICE CENTER AND THE COMBINATION OF THE WORK THAT MAURA
AND SYLVIA HAVE BEEN DOING, TOGETHER WITH MARIE AND HER TEAM, IN
PROVIDING SUPPORT BOTH THROUGH THE MULTISERVICE CENTERS, RENTAL
ASSISTANCE, THROUGH THE FIRST THE MAYOR'S DISASTER RELIEF FUND AND
NOW THE HSP PROGRAM. THE AMOUNT OF LEGAL SERVICES THAT ARE BEING
PROVIDED AND FUNDED, BOTH THROUGH DE NOVO AND THROUGH GREATER
BOSTON LEGAL SERVICES, IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE LOTS OF
TENANTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN NEED, BUT I'D SAY THAT THERE ARE
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AVAILABLE. WE ALSO JUST LEARNED TODAY THAT
THE CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED ADDITIONAL
EMERGENCY VOUCHERS THROUGH HUD THAT WE WILL HAVE AND BE ABLE
TO BEGIN TO SUPPORT BOTH THROUGH THE HOUSING LIAISON AND THE
MULTISERVICE CENTER AND SOME NONPROFIT PARTNERS FOR INDIVIDUALS
EXITING HOMELESSNESS.
ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT IS GOING TO BE ADDED IN ADDITION TO THE NEW
STATE FUNDING AND POTENTIALLY MORE FEDERAL FUNDING. IT IS NOT THAT
THERE ARE NOT NEEDS, THERE CLEARLY ARE, BUT THE STAFFING RESOURCE, I
THINK AT THE MOMENT, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT STAFFING RESOURCES AND
THE CITY MANAGER HAS BEEN PRETTY CLEAR BOTH WITH THE HOUSING
LIAISON AND WITH THE MULTISERVICE CENTER THAT AS WE MOVE
FORWARD, IF THE HOUSING RESOURCE, THE STAFFING RESOURCE DOESN'T
MATCH OUR NEED, THAT HE IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH US AROUND WHAT
IS NECESSARY. AS THE CITY MANAGER INDICATED, THE NEW CASE MANAGER
FOR THE MULTISERVICE CENTER IS STARTING IN TWO WEEKS. IT IS SOMEONE
WHO BRINGS SOME CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH VETERANS
AS WELL AS WORKING IN HOUSING SEARCH GENERALLY. WE ARE VERY
ENTHUSIASTIC TO WELCOME HIM TO OUR CITY.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GREAT. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. I
LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW HIRE AND HELPING MORE PEOPLE OUT. WE
HAVE CLEARLY SEEN AN INCREASE IN NEED AND IN MY OFFICE AS WELL AND
TRYING TO SUPPORT MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING OUT
THERE. THE MORE WE CAN DO TO HELP FOLKS, THE BETTER.
TO THE CITY MANAGER, DID WE END UP HIRING OR FILLING ANY POSITIONS IN
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT? IT WASN'T CLEAR FROM THE REPORT? WHETHER
IT HAPPENED OR NOT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER, YOU ARE MUTED.

>> CITY MANAGER: WE HAVE IN THE MEANTIME AS WE STATED, WE DELAYED
THE CLASS OF THE NEW POLICE OFFICE FOR SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE STARTED
THAT PROCESS AND COMMISSIONER BARD IS ON THE LINE, MAYBE OTHER
POSITIONS. WE MET THE GUIDELINES THAT WE SAID WE'D DO WITH THE
BUDGET. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO COMMISSIONER BARD.
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: THAT'S IT. THE MANAGER TOUCHED ON IT. WE
ONLY ON-BOARD ED SEVERELY DIMINISHED ACADEMY CLASS. FAR LESS THAN
WHAT WE HOPE TO ANSWER TO ON-BOARD PRIOR TO THE HIRING FREEZE,
I'LL CALL IT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE CITY COUNCIL ON THIS
BEFORE WE PLACE IT ON FILE? I DON'T SEE HANDS. WE CAN GO AHEAD AND
DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE ON
FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM SEVEN.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 7)
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PUTTING
THIS REPORT ON THE AGENDA. I'M DISAPPOINTED WE WON'T HAVE A
VACCINE BUS, I HAVE SEEN THEM IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO, THEY ARE
INTERESTING WAYS TO GET OUT TO HARD-TO-REACH COMMUNITIES. I DID
HEAR THAT DURING THE COVID UPDATE, BOTH DR. DOBBERTEEN AND MR.
JACOB TALKED ABOUT CREATIVE WAYS TO GET MORE MOBILE VACCINATION
SITES TO THE COMMUNITY. MAYBE PARTNERING WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL OR
LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS OR -- I THINK THE FAITH-BASED ORGANIZES. I'D
LOVE TO GIVE MR. JACOB OR DR. DOBBERTEEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK
ABOUT SOME UPCOMING WAYS THAT WE THINK ABOUT BEING CREATIVE TO
GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO DO THOSE. I THINK WE ARE HITTING THE
POINT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LINING UP AND
CLAMORING FOR THE VACCINE, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. HOW DO WE GET
INTO THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE SURE WE REACH EACH AND EVERY
RESIDENT?

City Manager Agenda #5
placed on file.

CITY MANAGER ITEM #5
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-11
regarding filling vacant
positions.

>> CLAUDE JACOB: I WILL START AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO DR.
DOBBERTEEN. I KNOW THAT CHIEF MAHONEY IS ALSO ON THE LINE. JUST
KNOW, WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST YEAR, OVER THE LAST
FEW MONTHS ESPECIALLY, IT IS SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT
VACCINE AND REDUCING BARRIERS, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR,
LOW-INCOME, AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, IMMIGRANTS AND
POCKETS OF THE COMMUNITY. I MENTION THAT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST
CLINICIAN SPEAKER BUREAU AND I WILL ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN TO TALK
ABOUT IT. IT IS HER BRAIN CHILD SUPPORTED BY ONE OF THE STAFF, JODY,


PAGE 17

May 10, 2021

AND AMPLIFIED BY THE CITY MANAGER STAFF AND LEE GIANETTI. WE PUSH
TO GET THE WORD OUT. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY CORPS, WE ESTABLISHED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AMBASSADORS
LAST JULY TO GO TO AREA PLAY LOTS AND PARKS AND WE THEN IMPORTED
THAT STAFFING COMPLEMENT TO TARGET THE PUBLIC HOUSING
DEVELOPMENTS, SENIOR BUILDINGS AND WE WORK IN CONCERT WITH
MEMBERS OF THE BLACK PASTER ASSOCIATION, ET CETERA, AND AREAS IN
HIGHEST NEED. I WILL ASK LISA TO TALK ABOUT ACTIVITY THAT TAKES PLACE
THIS COMING WEEKEND AS ILLUSTRATION OF THE COLLABORATION. THE
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE IS, GIVEN WHERE WE ARE, LOW-RISK, GREEN-LEVEL
COMMUNITY, THAT'S A DESIGNATION WE HAVEN'T HAD SINCE LAST
OCTOBER. CLEARLY, I WILL DEFER TO THE LABOR AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,
THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS ON IDENTIFYING RESIDENTS OR GROUPS THAT
FACE PHYSICAL OR SOCIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS THE VACCINATION SITES.
TRYING TO TAILOR SOLUTIONS TO FIT THE PROBLEM. I WILL ASK LISA TO
SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE HAVE QUEUED UP AS AN INNOVATIVE
PARTNERSHIP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DR. DOBBERTEEN, I THINK SHE IS NOT ONLINE.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: THAT'S RIGHT. APOLOGIES. I APOLOGIZE. SHE HAD SENT
ME A NOTE AND SIGNED OFF. I WILL SAY THIS, IN SHORT FORM, WE ARE
WORKING WITH MY BROTHER'S KEEPER, AND THE PROVIDER GROUP THAT
HAS LINKAGE TO THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, WE WORK WITH FIRE,
WORK WITH THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER ON CALENDAR STREET.
THIS IS A WAY FOR US TO WORK WITH THE PARTNERS ON THE GROUND. THE
REQUEST WAS FOR MORE EQUIPMENT TO TAKE IT TO THE STREETS. SINCE
JANUARY 20TH, THANKS TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE PARTNERS AT
PRO-EMS, WE MOBILIZED MOBILE STRIKE FORCE, AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
CALLS IT. WE HAVE BEEN NIMBLE AND AGILE ON THE GROUND, GOING
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF THE CITY. IT IS NOT A TRUCK OR A BOOK MOBILE
OF SORTS, IT IS THE PEOPLE POWER ANCHOR TO THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY CORPS AND THE NETWORKS IN THE CITY THAT HELP US TO GET
THE WORD OUT THROUGH TRUSTED SOURCES TO ENSURE FOLKS SHOW UP
TO GET THE VACCINE. WE DO HAVE AN ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE AT THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER THIS COMING SATURDAY. MAY 15TH. WE
WORK IN CONCERT WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE, IT IS
A COLLABORATION SO WE CAN GET THE TARGETED MESSAGE OUT TO BLACK
AND BROWN FOLKS IN THE CITY. THE PARTNERS HAVE BEEN AN AMPLIFIER. I
WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. CREATIVITY, IT IS LEANING IN, WHICH IS WHAT
WE'RE DOING, AND THE DATA AND THE ANECDOTES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS IN GETTING TO RESIDENTS AS WE GO
THROUGH THIS, NOT JUST HERE, BUT COAST TO COAST. APOLOGIES I DID
REALIZE THAT DR. DOBBERTEEN DID DESIGN OFF.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK DR. DOBBERTEEN ENDED UP COMING BACK. I
THINK CLAUDE COVERED IT. (ECHO IN THE BACKGROUND). PLEASE MUTE
YOURSELF.
THANK YOU. FOLLOW UP?

May 10, 2021

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND WE ARE HAVING
SOUND ISSUES. I WILL SAY, I THINK WHAT MR. JACOB WAS TALKING ABOUT, A
COLLABORATION THIS SATURDAY WITH MBK, WITH THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY CENTER, IN DOING VACCINATION ON SITE. I KNOW THERE WAS
A PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THIS WITH THE TUFTS MEDICAL GROUP, I THINK.
IT WAS REALLY AN AMAZING EVENT. BALLOONS, MUSIC, AND THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER HAS A BUILT-IN CONSTITUENCY AND THEY
ARE A TRUSTED PERSON. I LOVE THAT WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THEM
DIRECTLY. THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS
HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT DOING THAT MORE AND COLLABORATING
WITH OUR NONPROFITS, LIKE THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER, MAYBE
OUR PRE-SCHOOLS, FAITH-BASED COMMUNITY? I THINK THIS IS REALLY THE
NEXT STEP OF THE VACCINATIONS IS PARTNERING WITH TRUSTED
STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THEIR BUILT-IN CONSTITUENCY TO COME AND GET
THE VACCINES WHERE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE THEY KNOW PEOPLE, TRUST PEOPLE. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S ONE
COLLABORATION COMING UP ON SIDE. -- COMING UP ON SATURDAY. I'M
EXCITED ABOUT THAT. DR. DOBBERTEEN MENTIONED A CLINIC DIRECTED
TOWARDS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. THAT'S GREAT. WE CAN'T HAVE A BUS, I
THINK JUST HAVING THE MOBILE VACCINE LOCATIONS AROUND TOWN WITH
THE RESOURCES IS GOING TO BE A HUGE, HUGE WAY FOR US TO GET THE
REST OF THE PERCENTAGE OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS WHO AREN'T GOING
TO A CVS OR GO TO A BIGGER VACCINATION SITE, BUT WOULD GO TO THE
PLACE DOWN THE STREET THEY GO ANYWAY. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY. I'M
DISAPPOINTED WE'RE NOT GETTING A BUS, I HOPE WE MOVE FORWARD
WITH SOME OF THE REALLY INTENSE AND INTENTIONAL COLLABORATIONS
WITH THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THE WORK.
GET MORE SHOTS IN ARMS. THANKS FOR THE REPORT. I LOOK FORWARD TO
MORE CREATIVE WAYS THAT YOU WILL ROLL OUT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL
MONTHS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU TO DR. DOBBERTEEN WHO -- WE WORK
CLOSELY WITH HER PUTTING TOGETHER THE SATURDAY EVENT. WE ARE
GRATEFUL FOR ALL THAT SHE IS DOING AND HER TEAM. FURTHER
QUESTIONS? FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS REPORT? I DON'T SEE ANY, SO
WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON PLACING THIS CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM
NUMBER SEVEN ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THAT MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA NUMBER EIGHT.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 8)
THIS WAS PULLED BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

City Manager Agenda Item #7
placed on file.

CITY MANAGER ITEM #7
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-12,
regarding a report on the
feasibility of retrofitting
existing vehicles or renting
vehicles to create a mobile
vaccine clinic program.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I'M THRILLED WE'RE CONTINUING TO
MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR SEWER OVERFLOW. IT IS A CRITICAL PART OF
THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL REALLY HELP OUR
LONG-TERM PLANS FOR A WHOLE HOST OF AREAS IN THE AREA OF WATER
AND CLIMATE PREPARATION. MY QUESTION IS, WHETHER WE HAVE LOOKED

PAGE 19

May 10, 2021

AT -- I BELIEVE I ASKED THIS IN THE PAST AND I WILL RAISE IT AGAIN -- WE
OPEN UP STREETS, IF WE LAYING CONDUIT IN ANTICIPATION OF BROADBAND
AND BE SURE WE BUILD A BACKBONE OF FIBER CABLE IN THE CITY WHEN WE
WORK ON THE STREETS?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL JUST IN. I'M NOT SURE OWEN IS ON THE PHONE.
WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH -- I SEE OWEN. THIS IS JUST THE FIRST TIME THE
COUNCIL SEES IT. WE ASK THE QUESTIONS AT THE BUDGET HEARINGS. AND I
KNOW DAVID WAS GOING TO MAKE THAT SUGGESTION AND THERE'S A VOTE
AT THE BUDGET FOR ADOPTION. OWEN CAN JUMP IN. I THINK IT WOULD BE
BETTER FOR NUMBER EIGHT AND TEN, IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, TO
MAKE SURE I HAVE THE DEPARTMENT THAT IS HERE. TRADITIONALLY WE
HAVE DONE THEM BUDGETED. OWEN IS ON THE LINE. I WILL LET HIM
JUDGE?
>> OWEN: THANK YOU. AGAIN, I THINK KATHY IS NOT ON THE LINE AND
MAYBE SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER MORE COMPLETELY THAN I CAN.
WE USE THE EXPRESSION OPENING UP A STREET WHEN WE DO SEWER
SEPARATION. IT IS INACCURATE EXPRESSION. WHAT WE DO, WE EXCAVATE
FOR A GIVEN UTILITY. THE STORM WATER LINE, SEWER LINE, A DRAIN LINE,
OR A GAS LINE. AND EACH OF THESE HAVE ITS OWN COST ASSOCIATED WITH
IT. THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON, WHEN YOU RESTORE THE
STREET ITSELF, YOU RESTORE BECAUSE OF THE VARIOUS EXCAVATIONS.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PUTTING IN AN EXTRA CONDUIT FOR
COMMUNICATION PURPOSES, THAT'S AN EXTRA EXCAVATION AND IT HAS AN
EXTRA COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I DON'T HAVE THE COST OFF THE TOP OF
MY HEAD. WE WENT THROUGH AN EXERTION WHEN WE COMPLETED THE
SEWER SEPARATION IN THE NEW CONCORD AREA AND WE ESTIMATE THE
COST OF PUTTING IN THE EXTRA CONDUIT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROJECT.
IT WAS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.
SO, IT IS NOT AS THOUGH YOU ARE NOT SPENDING ANYMORE MORE. IT IS A
SIGNIFICANT ADDED COST. I RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THAT REGARDLESS. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT ADDED COST.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. AS SOMEONE
WHO LIVED ON THE STREET, I SAW THE STREET GET RIPPED UP SEVERAL
TIMES. IT IS AN ADDITIONAL COST, AS THE COMMISSIONER AND I HAVE
TALKED ABOUT, THERE'S ALREADY REQUIREMENT IN OUR -- ALL OF THE
ORDINANCE AT ANYTIME STREETS ARE OPENED AND CONDUIT IS LAID,
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHAT CONDUIT CAPACITY IS THERE. I
DO KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE FAR LESS EXPENSIVE, EVEN IF IS TENS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, CHEAPER TO DO IT NOW THAN OTHER PLACES. I
RAISE THE QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THE CITY MANAGER'S SUGGESTION
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE BUDGET. I'M HIGHLIGHTING THIS IS PART
OF THAT DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION GIVEN WE
MOVE TOWARD THE SITUATION WHERE IT IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE
INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER, IF IT IS NOT
ALREADY IN THERE, IF IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO CONSIDER IT BEING PART OF
THE PROJECT. AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI, WE CAN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION

IN FURTHER BUDGET DISCUSSIONS, UNLESS THERE'S OTHER THINGS TO SAY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. PER THE CLERK, ON THE MOTION ON THIS
IS TO MOVE EIGHT--CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA ITEM 8 TO A SECOND
READING. WE CAN GET TO TEN AND DO IT AS WELL. CLERK, WE'LL DO IT ON
EIGHT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO TEN AND DO THE SAME.
>> MR. CLERK: ON PASSING CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA ITEM EIGHT TO A
SECOND READING. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

City Manager Agenda Item #8
passed to a second reading.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: BEFORE YOU ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL GO TO 10, READ IT AND THEN TO YOU. MOVING
TO CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA TEN. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM
NUMBER 10).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. MY QUESTIONS
ARE VERY GENERAL AND NOT SPECIFIC. I ASSUME THE MUNICIPAL FACILITIES
IMPROVEMENT PLAN IS AN ONGOING PLAN THAT EVERY YEAR YOU
EVALUATE. I SEE THE MANAGER SAYING YES. EVERY YEAR YOU EVALUATE
THE NEEDS AND THEN PICK A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROJECTS THAT ARE
MOST IN NEED.
IS THERE SUCH A THING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE? IS THERE AN
INFRASTRUCTURE EVALUATION AND PLAN?
>> OWEN: SO, WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN FOR BOTH MUNICIPAL
UTILITIES AND FOR STREETS AND SIDEWALK WORK. THE FIVE-YEAR STREET
AND SIDEWALK PLAN AND A TEN-YEAR SEWER AND DRAIN PLAN FOR THE
CITY. IN TERMS OF OUR -- THE WATER DEPARTMENT IS INCLUDED IN THAT.
IN TERMS OF MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE ARE PLANS THAT EXIST AT
THIS POINT IN TIME AND THEY ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, COUNCILLOR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. ON SEEING NO OTHER HANDS -- ACTUALLY,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ON
THE MOSES YOUTH CENTER. I KNOW THEY HAD A PROPOSAL IN THE
PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING THAT WAS NOT FUNDED. I'M WONDERING IF WE
HAVE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO FUND SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMMING
NEEDS AS WELL?
>> CITY MANAGER: I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY WERE, TO BE HONEST, OFF
THE TOP OF MY HEAD. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT TO THE HUMAN
SERVICES, I CAN GET THE ANSWER. I DON'T KNOW IF DAVID OR MATT ->> WHAT IS THE QUESTION AGAIN?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE. I WILL LET YOU SAY IT. WE'LL

May 10, 2021

HAVE TO GET IT AT A FUTURE POINT. GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE QUESTION IS AROUND THE
MOSES YOUTH CENTER. I KNOW THEY HAD A PARTICIPATORY BUDGET
PROJECT THAT WAS NOT FUNDED. IT WAS TO FUND SOME OTHER
PROGRAMMING NEEDS. I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT PROJECT TO BE GET FUNDED. I UNDERSTAND YOU
MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW, BUT IF WE CAN GET AN ANSWER
TO THAT.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL LOOK AND TALK TO DAVID AND OTHERS AND GET
BACK TO YOU, IF THAT IS OKAY?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YUP. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO FURTHER QUESTION ON THIS. WE'LL DISCUSS
LATER ON. ROLL CALL ON CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA NUMBER TEN AND PASS
IT TO A SECOND READING.
>> MR. CLERK: PASSAGE TO A SECOND READING: (ROLL CALL).

City Manager Agenda Item #10
passed to a second reading.

EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 12.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 12)
PULLED BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES. THANK YOU. PARDON ME AND MR. BARR,
THE REASON I PULL THEM. THEY ARE ACCIDENTS DURING WORKING,
SOMEONE SLIPPING OR HURTING THEIR BACK. WHAT TYPE OF ACCIDENTS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? IN GENERAL. I DON'T NEED SPECIFICS.
>> JOE BARR: I WOULDN'T GET INTO ANY SPECIFICS OF A MEDICAL
SITUATION. IT IS TYPICALLY SOMEONE SLIPs AND FALLS OR HURTS THEIR
BACK. I'D SAY PARTICULARLY FOR THE OFFICERS, IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB AND
THERE CAN BE INJURIES THAT OCCUR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. MY IMAGINATION KEPT GOING UP
AND UP ON WHAT THIS COULD BE. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS
NOTHING SERIOUS. THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. WE HAVE REALLY TRIED TO DO
SOME SAFETY INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDES FOR THE EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY AT
PUBLIC WORKS. TO HELP KEEP THEM SAFER, BUT THEY DO COME UP. I
KNOW WE HAVE REALLY TRIED TO STRESS -- WE HAVE SAFETY OFFICERS NOW
AND OFFICERS TO WORK WITH THE EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, SEEING NO OTHER HANDS ON THIS, WE CAN DO A
ROLL CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE APPROPRIATION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 13.

CITY MANAGER AGENDA
ITEM #12
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
transfer of $30,000 from the
General Fund Traffic, Parking
and Transportation Salary and

May 10, 2021

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I WAS GLAD TO SEE THIS
ON THE AGENDA AS REQUIRED BY THE CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE AND SEE
THE WEBSITE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT, WHICH IS HELPFUL. IT IS A
LENGTHY REPORT. I KNOW I HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON IT AND
OTHER COUNCILLORS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS DID AS WELL. I MAKE A
MOTION TO REFER IT TO HAVE A HEARING ON IT TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE. IF
THERE WERE COUNCILLORS WHO HAVE QUICK QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW,
HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN THAT BEFORE MAKING THE MOTION BECAUSE I KNOW
SOMETIMES NOT EVERYBODY CAN MAKE IT TO A COMMITTEE MEETING. I DO
THINK THE COMMITTEE MEETING WILL GIVE FOLKS MORE TIME TO DIG INTO
IT. THAT'S THE MOTION.

Wages account to the General
Fund Traffic, Parking and
Transportation Travel and
Training (Judgment and
Damages) account to cover
current and anticipated
medical services and/or
prescription reimbursement
costs for the remainder of the
fiscal year for Traffic and
Parking personnel injured in
the performance of their duties.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. THE RECOMMENDED ACTION IS TO REFER
TO THE TRANSPORTATION AND UTILITIES COMMITTEE. BEFORE WE DO THAT,
I DO SEE TWO HANDS. WE'LL GO TO THEM BRIEFLY BEFORE ROLL CALL.
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. IT IS A VERY LENGTHY REPORT
AND I AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER THAT IT NEEDS MORE
-- A CLOSER LOOK. I WILL POINT OUT, WE HAD COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER AND I HAD A COUPLE OF MEETINGS WITH THE CITY
STAFF, AND CAMBRIDGE BIKE SAFETY, I THINKS THERE A LOT OF GOOD WORK
AND COLLABORATION DONE, EVEN IF PEOPLE AREN'T ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT
ON WHAT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD.
I DID WANT TO -- I SPOKE WITH FOLKS FROM CAMBRIDGE BIKE SAFETY
TODAY, THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS REPORT BEFORE IT APPEARED ON THE AGENDA.
I WANT TO SAY TO CONTINUE OUR COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP AND
EFFORT, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE IN A
COMMITTEE MEETING WITH THEM AND HAVE THE CONVERSATION. I'D
JUST... I DIDN'T READ IT AS THOROUGHLY AS I SHOULD HAVE BEFORE
TONIGHT. I DO WANT TO MAKE A NOTE OF THAT WE TRY TO BE CAREFUL OF
-- AT LEAST THOUGHTFUL ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE IN
OUR REPORTS. SOME LANGUAGE WAS PRETTY... THIS IS GOING TO BE A
DISASTER TYPE OF THING. IT DOES TEND TO SWAY THE CONVERSATION ONE
WAY AND AWAY FROM -- IT GIVES AN IMPRESSION THAT LEANS IN ONE
DIRECTION. I THINK IT CAN GET PEOPLE NERVOUS. ADD WE WRITE THE
REPORT, I HOPE WE PAY ATTENTION TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE. I DO
APPRECIATE IT. IT WAS A TON OF WORK. I DO APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT
TRAFFIC AND PARKING AND OTHERS PUT INTO THIS AND INTO THE MEETINGS.
I WANT TO KEEP THE COLLABORATION GOING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I JUST FINISHED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE REPORT AND
LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING IT IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. I


PAGE 23

May 10, 2021

WILL SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ANSWER IN THE REPORT. IT
BASICALLY SAYS WE CAN'T OR SHOULDN'T DO A QUICK BUILD AND THAT
REALLY MEANS WE'RE LOOKING AT YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE WE
GET PROTECTED BIKE LANES ON THIS SECTION OF MASS AVENUE, IF WE
FOLLOW THIS PLAN. ANY KIND OF CAPITAL PROJECT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS
TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ACCEPTABLE
ANSWER. I THINK WE NEED TO FIND A WAY FORWARD TO PUT IN PLACE
PROTECTIVE BIKE LANES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SO WE CAN PROTECT
OUR RESIDENT LIVES AS THEY NAVIGATE OUR CITY ON BICYCLES.
AGAIN, I DO APPRECIATE THE REPORT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION,
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE CONTENT OF IT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUICK COMMENT. I
GREATLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY. IT IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD
IN LARGE PART. I SEE IT EVERY DAY. I KNOW THE CITY IS ALSO CONSIDERING
BUS LANE S. I THANK COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER FOR PULLING IT AND
HAVING A GREATER DISCUSSION ON WHAT IS POSSIBLE. SOME OF US, IF NOT
ALL OF US, HAVE SEEN OTHER DESIGNS THAT WERE CREATIVE AND TO EVEN
DISCUSS THOSE WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THE MEETING. THANK YOU. THAT'S
ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I SEE NO OTHER HANDS. WE'LL DO A ROLL
CALL ON REFERRING THIS, CALENDAR ITEM NUMBER 13, TO THE
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO THE CALENDAR. THERE ARE NO CHARTER
RIGHT ITEMS. I THINK COUNCILLORS ASKED FOR AN UPDATE ON NUMBER
ONE. I THINK THE CITY MANAGER HAS SAID HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK. STAY
TUNED ON THAT. WE'LL GO PASS THE CALENDAR TO APPLICATIONS AND
PETITIONS. MORE OF THE CITY COUNCIL? ON THE MOTION...
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: NUMBER THREE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO ONE ELSE, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING
APPLICATION AND PETITION NUMBERS ONE AND TWO.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO APPLICATION AND PETITION NUMBER
THREE. (READING APPLICATION NUMBER THREE).
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DID NOTICE THE DESIGN WAS
MISSING, BUT WE GOT THE UPDATED DESIGN EARLIER TODAY. I'LL SAY, I WAS
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BY THE DESIGN AND CERTAINLY NO DISRESPECT TO
THE ARTIST WHO DESIGNED IT. IT DIDN'T FEEL TO ME LIKE IT WAS REALLY AS
CREATIVE AND AS COMMUNICATIVE AS WHAT WE SAW, FOR EXAMPLE, IN
APPLICATION NUMBER TWO FOR CENTRAL SQUARE. IT WAS LISTING THE
NAMES OF SPECIFIC BUSINESSES AND WHEREAS THE BANNERS ARE SHOWING
MORE GENERIC ACTIVITY, BUT NOT REALLY PROMOTING ANY SPECIFIC
BUSINESSES.

was referred to the
Transportation Committee.

APPLICATONS AND
PETITIONS #1

SO, I'LL VOTE FOR IT. I THINK IT IS NOT OUR JOB TO DESIGN THESE THINGS,
BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE COULD USE MORE CREATIVE AND
COMMUNICATIVE DESIGN TO STIMULATE SUPPORT FOR OUR BUSINESSES IN
INMAN SQUARE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I HAVE TO SAY, I'M REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. I NEVER
USUALLY CALL THAT INTO QUESTION. THE BANNERS, IT IS MY
UNDERSTANDING, DESIGNED BY A LOCAL ARTIST IN COOPERATION WITH THE
BUSINESSES IN THE INMAN SQUARE AREA. I GUESS, EVERYBODY HAS A
DIFFERENT OPINION WHAT ART IS, THIS IS WHAT THE COMMUNITY CAME UP
WITH AND THE LOCAL ARTIST. I THINK IS INSULTING WE SIT HERE AND
QUESTION THE BANNERS THAT ARE BEING PUT UP. A LOT OF WORK, TIME,
AND ENERGY IS PUT INTO THIS BY VOLUNTEERS. THAT'S NOT THE RESPONSE
THAT IS WARRANTED IN THIS SITUATION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. GOING TO -- I
THINK THAT'S ALL WHO RAISED THEIR HANDS. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE. I
LIKE THE BANNERS AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE OTHER WAYS TO PROMOTE
COMING UP IN THE FUTURE. SO, ON THE ROLL CALL TO ADOPT... YES. ROLL
CALL TO ADOPT. THANK YOU.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO COMMUNICATIONS. GOING TO RESOLUTIONS.
PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL? I'M GOING TO PULL SIX FOR A QUICK
CORRECTION. HEARING NO ONE ELSE, ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING THE
BALANCE.
>> MR. CLERK: FOR THE RECORD, IT IS 1-5 AND 7. ON ADOPTING THE
RESOLUTIONS: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION NUMBER SIX. CONDOLENCE
TO THE FAMILY OF SUSAN COAL, WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY MAY 1ST. SHE
WAS A 40-YEAR RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. YOU CAN SEE FROM THE
RESOLUTION, REALLY HUGE COMMITMENT THAT SHE HAD TOWARDS HER
WORK AND THE COMMUNITY. THERE WAS A TYPO ON THE DATE OF BIRTH
THAT I'D LIKE TO AMEND. 1968 TO 1948. IF YOU DON'T MIND, ROLL CALL ON
THE AMENDMENT.

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: MOVE FOR ADOPTION.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I'D LIKE TO PULL BOTH OF THEM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. WE PULL BOTH. (READING POLICY ORDER 1).
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE QUESTIONS. I'D SAY I
HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE BID. WITH THE CITY MANAGER. BOTH ARE
INTERESTED AND INTRIGUED WITH THIS POSSIBILITY AND WANT TO MOVE
THIS FORWARD FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

Policy Order #1 Charter Right
by Councillor Zondervan

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AS WE PULL OUR WAY OUT OF THIS
PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT IT WILL HAVE LONG, LONG -- LONG, LONG
EFFECT ON OUR LIVES, OUR CITY. PARTICULARLY, OUR BUSINESSES. AND IN
CENTRAL SQUARE, THE BID, MICHAEL AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS, THEY HAVE
BEEN WORKING OVERTIME TRYING TO FIND OUT WAYS TO MAKE OUR
BUSINESS COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY THE RESTAURANTS, HEALTHY AGAIN.
IF YOU DRIVE THROUGH CENTRAL SQUARE, YOU CAN SEE THE OUTDOOR
PATIOS OPENING UP AGAIN, WHICH IS GREAT. I WENT OVER TO THE TAVERN
ON FRIDAY TO MAKE A RESERVATION FOR BRUNCH, I ATE AT HOME BECAUSE
IT WAS FULL. IT WAS NICE TO KNOW THEY HAVE FULL CAPACITY. THEY DO
APPRECIATE WHEN THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS THEM AND THEY SEE IT
THROUGH POLICY ORDERS AND INITIATIVES TO SAY WHAT WE CAN DO TO
HELP YOU FLOURISH. YEARS AGO, AS MY TENURE AS MAYOR, WE ATTEMPTED
TO CLOSE CENTRAL SQUARE ONCE AGAIN TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC, SORT OF
RECREATING THE CENTRAL SQUARE FAIR ON THE WEEKEND BASES TO REALLY
SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES.
THIS IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY AND AS MY COLLEAGUE AND PRIMARY
SPONSOR OF THIS POLICY ORDER HAS SAID, WE ARE IN CONVERSATION WITH
THE CENTRAL SQUARE BID, WE'RE NOT PULLING THIS OUT OF OUR SHOE. WE
ARE ASKING FOR AN ADVISORY TO SEE IS IT SOMETHING WE CAN DO. IT DOES
TWO THINGS. ONE, IF IT PASSES, IT SAYS TO THE CENTRAL SQUARE BID AND
THE PATRONS AND -- WE CARE AND WE WANT TO MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE.
WE WANT TO MAKE IT VIBRANT AND BRING THANK THAT VIBRANCY IT HAD.
WE LOST THE MIDDLE EAST, IT WAS A TREMENDOUS LOSS FOR US. THE LONG
AND SHORT OF IT, I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL STAND TO SEE IF WE GET A
CITY RESPONSE THAT WILL SUPPORT THIS IDEA. AND LET US ALL PULL IN THE
SAME DIRECTION TRYING TO SUPPORT OUR SQUARES, PARTICULARLY IN THIS
CASE, CENTRAL SQUARE. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, VICE MAYOR MALLON, AND
COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE
INTENT OF THIS ORDER. I SUPPORT THAT INTENT OF CLOSING THE STREETS
TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC TO PROMOTE OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES. THE LOCAL
BUSINESSES IN CENTRAL SQUARE DURING THOSE TIMES. WHAT I DO FIND A
LITTLE CURIOUS, IT IS REALLY SUPER FOCUSSED ON THE BUSINESSES BECAUSE
OF THE TIME FRAMES AND REALLY NOT FOCUSSED AT ALL ON THE RESIDENTS.


PAGE 26

May 10, 2021

DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN WE ASKED FOR STREET CLOSURES, THERE
WAS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND THAT. A LOT OF CONTROVERSY TO
CLOSE THE STREETS FOR THE RESIDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS.
WHY NOT CLOSE THEM, CLOSE THE STREETS ON SUNDAYS AS WELL TO HAVE
TIME WHERE RESIDENTS CAN ENJOY THAT SPACE. OF COURSE, SOME
BUSINESSES CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TIME FRAME AS WELL. I WANT
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE MAKERS AND SEE IF WE CAN ADJUST IT
SO IT CAN REALLY BE BENEFIT TO BOTH THE BUSINESSES AND THE RESIDENTS.
I AM EXERCISING THE CHARTER RIGHT AND SEE IF WE CAN COME TO AN
AGREEMENT ON THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I CALLED TWO NAMES ALREADY. CAN I GO TO THEM?
>> MR. CLERK: TECHNICALLY, THE CHARTER RIGHT WOULD END DEBATE AND
MOVE ON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CHARTER RIGHT IS EXERCISED AND MOVE TO POLICY
ORDER TWO. IT IS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE BILL NUMBER 3559. I WILL GO TO
COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS A POLICY ORDER THAT WE
WANT TO CONTINUE THE COUNCIL'S LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING
ELECTRIFICATION AND ENCOURAGING THE STATE TO DO MORE IN THIS AREA.
I'M HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT IT. THERE'S SOME THINGS IN THE POLICY
ORDER AND I THINK YOU AND THE -- THANK YOU AND THE VICE MAYOR
MALLON FOR JOINING ME. I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD, BUT I'M
NOT SURE I HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD, UNLESS COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN HAS
SOME TYPE OF QUESTIONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT ORDER,
BUT IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE A RESOLUTION. I PULLED IT
BECAUSE THE LAST WHEREAS, I THINK SHOULD SAY RESOLVED INSTEAD OF
WHEREAS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK? IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE RESOLUTIONS?
I KNOW SOMETIMES YOU PUT IN RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF THE ORDER.
>> MR. CLERK: THAT'S THE REASON.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WASN'T QUESTIONING WHERE IT WAS, BUT
THE FINAL WHEREAS, IT SHOULD READ RESOLVED. IT IS SAYING THE COUNCIL
GO ON RECORD IN SUPPORT OF THIS ->> MR. CLERK: THAT CAN BE AMENDED. THE COUNCIL MAKES A MOTION TO
AMEND THAT PARAGRAPH.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: RIGHT. ON THE ORDERED, I DON'T KNOW IF IT
SHOULD SAY ORDERED OR RESOLVED. THAT'S A QUESTION TO THE CLERK.
>> MR. CLERK: ORDERED IS APPROPRIATE AS IT IS AN INSTRUCTION TO A CITY
OFFICIAL, IN THIS CASE, BEING THE CLERK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THAT'S GOOD. MY AMENDMENT IS TO
CHANGE THE LAST WHEREAS TO RESOLVE.

PROPOSE THIS BE UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSED. IT MEANS MUCH MORE BY THE
STATE -- THE MORE CITIES THAT UNANIMOUSLY. I RELEASE NOT EVERYBODY
MAY WANT IT, IF NOT, THEN I ASK TO BE ADDED. THIS IS A CRITICAL ITEM
AND IDEALLY, ALL OF WOULD ENDORSE IT.
