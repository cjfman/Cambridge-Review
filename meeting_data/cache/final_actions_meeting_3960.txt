>> PADDLE AND PICKLE BALL ARE IMPORTANT TO RESIDENTS, WHY DO I SAY
THIS? IN THE PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING PROCESS, I SAW THE PEOPLE'S
PADDLE PETITION RECEIVED THE SECOND LARGEST NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS
AND THE LARGEST NUMBER OF COMMENTS FOR ALL PROPOSALS IN THE
CATEGORY OF FACILITIES, PARKS, AND REC. THAT IS EVERYTHING FROM
TENNIS TO DOG PARKS AND GYMS.
>> YOU GET TENNIS AND PICKLE BALL PLAYERS IN COMPETITION FOR THIS
SPACE BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYED IN THE SAME SEASON.
>> WE HAVE A GRANTS AND LOANS COMMITTEE, WHICH THE MANDATE IS
TO HELP FUND PUBLIC ACCESS COURTS. AND AS IT WAS SAID, THERE ARE
FEW AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE GIVE GRANTS AND LOANS TO A COUPLE OF
OTHER CITIES, THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE KIND IN MASSACHUSETTS. WE ARE
VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

Public Comment

THERE IS WAY MORE DEMAND TO PLAY THIS GAME THAN THERE IS SUPPLY
RIGHT NOW. AND PARTICULARLY AS THEY MENTIONED, PUBLIC ACCESS
SUPPLY. THIS IS THE KIND OF PROJECT THAT OUR ORGANIZATION WOULD BE


PAGE 1

Jun 1, 2020

VERY EXCITED TO GET BEHIND. AS THEY SAID, IT IS A FAST GROWING SPORT,
NOT QUITE AS PICKLE BECAUSE, IT IS MUST CHEAPER TO BUILD AND EASIER
TO PLAY, LIKE THEY SAID, PLATFORM TENNIS AND PADDLES IS EASIER THAN
TENNIS, IT IS FIND THE FACILITIES TO PLAY. SO, THE AMERICAN PLATFORM I
CAN SPEAK FOR THE AMERICAN PLATT FORM TENNIS ASSOCIATION TO SAY
WE'D BE EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND WOULD OFFER OUR SUPPORT
BEHIND IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ADRIANA HAUSMANN.
>> THEY HAVE NOT JOINED. TINA, GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. I'M TINA ALU. 113 PLEASANT STREET. AND TONIGHT I'M
TESTIFYING AS BOTH THE DIRECTOR OF CEOC AND AS THE CO CHAIR OF THE
CITY WIDE LANGUAGE JUSTICE WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT OF POLICY
ORDER NUMBER THREE. IT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY SUPPORT TO DEVELOP
AND IMPLEMENT A LANGUAGE JUSTICE PLAN. THE WORKING GROUP,
INCLUDING PEOPLE FROM THE SCHOOLS, CITY DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING
POLICE, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEAM, THE
CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY, AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS
HAVE BEEN MEETING OVER MANY MONTHS IN A DISCOVERY PHASE.
RESEARCHING THE EFFORTS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY AND
ADMINISTERING SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS. THERE IS NOT A CONSISTENT
LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN IN THE CITY, MULTILINGUAL STAFF ARE ASKED TO
HELP WITH TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION, BUT NOT PAID OR TRAINED
TO DO THE WORK. AND THE BURDEN OF UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION
AND NAVIGATING SYSTEMS IS STILL OFTEN PLACED ON COMMUNITY
MEMBERS WHO NEED THE MOST HELP.
IN THE PAST YEAR, THE CITY HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND LANGUAGE
JUSTICE, FOR EXAMPLE, BY PROVIDING COVID AND CENSUS INFORMATION IN
A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES, BUT THERE IS STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE. I
SEE THIS MYSELF ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS WE WORK HARDER ON THIS
ISSUE AT CEOC. AND I ENCOURAGE THE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT
BY BOTH ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT IS THE RIGHT OF EVERY PERSON TO
COMMUNICATE IN THE LANGUAGES THAT EMPOWER THEM AND THEY FEEL
MOST COMFORTABLE AND BY PROVIDING THE NECESSARY STAFFING AND
RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HEATHER HOFFMAN, FOLLOWED BY
JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> 213 HURLEY STREET. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST ABOUT THE ORDER
CONCERNING A DIVERSE CITY WORKFORCE AND LEADERSHIP. I'M HAPPY TO
SEE IT AND I HOPE THAT TRAINING INCLUDES TRAINING, NOT JUST IN THE
AREA OF WORK, BUT ALSO IN THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BE A GOOD MANAGER
AND A GOOD LEADER.
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE IN BORN IN SOME PEOPLE, BUT MOST PEOPLE
HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT AND IT IS NOT EASY AND MY OBSERVATION
THAT THE CAMBRIDGE CITY GOVERNMENT COULD PLACE A WHOLE LOT
MORE EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING THE SKILLS IN THE WORKFORCE AND THAT

PAGE 2

Jun 1, 2020

WOULD BE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MANAGING AND THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING MANAGED.
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT LANGUAGE JUSTICE. I WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR
THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER TALK ABOUT IT. I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER
ASPECT. MY CHILD ATTENDED ONE OF THE CITY'S BILINGUAL SCHOOL S AND
WHAT I FOUND WAS A WHOLE LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS
MEANS AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOSTILITY TO THE WHOLE NOTION OF
BILINGUALISM INSTEAD OF VIEWING IT AS THE TREMENDOUS ASSET THAT
CERTAIN LY THE PEOPLE PUTTING THIS FORWARD KNOW IT TO BE. I
REMEMBER HEARING A FEW YEARS AGO, THE SOMERVILLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
HAD A PROGRAM IN INTERPRETATION. AND THERE WAS A SUGGESTION AT
THE TIME THAT CAMBRIDGE LOOK INTO DOING THAT. WE HAVE SO MANY
PEOPLE IN THIS CITY WHO SPEAK MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE AND SO MANY
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE INTERPRETATION. BOTH CULTURALLY AND
LINGUISTICALLY.
SO, I DON'T SEE WHY THE CITY SHOULDN'T MAKE USE OF THIS TREMENDOUS
RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE AND PUT IT TO MAKING THE GOVERNMENT MORE
RESPONSIVE AND THE WHOLE CITY MORE RESPONSIVE TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE AND VISIT HERE. AND WORK HERE.
AND ONE LAST THING, WOULD YOU PLEASE REVISE THE PUBLIC COMMENT
SUBMISSION CONFIRMATION SO IT DOESN'T SAY THAT ZOOM STOPS AT THE
END OF PUBLIC COMMENT. I MENTIONED THIS BEFORE. PLEASE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS, HEATHER. NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES
WILLIAMSON.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> YOU CAN HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU CAN'T HEAR US?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO. JAMES? HAVE WE LOST YOU?
>> JAMES IS STILL ON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES, CAN YOU HEAR US?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN NOW.
>> OKAY. THANK YOU. JAMES WILLIAMSON, JACKSON PLACE, JEFFERSON
PARK IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE. I WILL SPEAK TO THE RINDGE AVENUE
QUESTION THAT IS ON THE TABLE. AND I WANT TO SAY A LITTLE ABOUT WHY
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CITY OF


PAGE 3

Jun 1, 2020

CAMBRIDGE IS WE FIND OUT ABOUT PLANS AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE, THEY
HAVE ALREADY BEEN BAKED, THERE'S A PERFUNCTORY OF FAKE PUBLIC
MEETING, THEY CHECK THE BOX, HAVE THE PUBLIC MEETING, AND THEY
CHECK OFF GO AHEAD CITY STAFF AND CITY ADMINISTRATION GO AHEAD
WITH THE PLANS THEY DECIDED ON. IT IS A PRETTY INSULTING EXPERIENCE
FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE CITY. IF ANYBODY HAS DOUBT ABOUT
IT, LOOK AT THE REACTION TO WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE PLAN
FOR SEPARATED BIKE LANES AND ONE BUS LANE IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE
BETWEEN DUDLEY AND THE ARLINGTON LINE. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE FEEL
THEY LEARNED ABOUT IT AFTER LABOR DAY AND THE PLAN CALLS FOR
SOMETHING BEING IMPLEMENTED BEFORE THE END OF NOVEMBER.
BUSINESS OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS ARE APPARENTLY QUITE UPSET ABOUT
IT. SO, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
THE PLAN FOR RINDGE AVENUE TO BE INVOLVED AND ENGAGED NOW
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE IT IS
A DONE DEAL. THE FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND HAVE DONE AN ADMIRABLE
JOB OF RAISING POINTING OUT THE OPPORTUNITY AND ADVOCATING FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP THE JERRY'S PIT OR POND TO BE A MUCH
BETTER EXPERIENCE AND A MUCH BETTER ENVIRONMENT FOR ESPECIALLY
FOR PEOPLE THAT LIVE ALONG RANGE AVE. THE CITY STAFF CAME IN AT THE
LAST MINUTE AFTER A YEAR OF MEETINGS AND INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF A
TWO WAY BIKE LANE, WHICH THEY ARE MISLEADINGLY LABELLING A
MULTIUSE LANE. CAN I SAY MISLEADING BECAUSE THE SO CALLED MULTIUSE
LANES IN THE RUSSELL FIELD AREA ARE BASICALLY RACE COURSES FOR
BICYCLISTS. PEOPLE WANT A BOARDWALK ON THE EASTERN SIDE WHERE IT
MAKES SENSE. AND THIS IS ALL PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE WHAT IS DONE
BY CITY STAFF WITHOUT ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT IMPROVEMENTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. THAT'S ALL WHO
SIGNED UP. WE'LL KEEP IT OPEN UNTIL 6:00. WE'LL MOVE THROUGH THE
AGENDA AND ADJOURN AT 6:30 FOR THE TAX RATE HEARING. THERE ARE NO
RECONSIDERATIONS. WE ARE MOVING TO THE CITY MANAGER AGENDA.

STANDARDS OUTLINED IN THE POLICY ORDER THAT WAS PASSED. IT WAS
SAID IT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US TO DIRECT THE CDD IN THEIR PLANNING
AND GRANTING OF SPECIAL PERMITS TO MATCH BOSTON'S STANDARDS. TO
REMIND YOU, THIS IS BOSTON STANDARDS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE
THAT 25% OF ALL NEW PARKING SPOTS NEED TO BE EV CHARGER INSTALLED
AND 100% READY. AND THAT'S WHAT OUR GOAL WAS AND THIS IS REALLY
WONDERFUL WITH THE VOLPE, HAVING TALKED PREVIOUSLY TO STAFF, THEY
INCREASE THEIR PERCENTAGE OF EV INSTALLED, HOWEVER, IT FALLS BELOW
WHERE BOSTON IS NOW REQUIRING OF 25%. THE QUESTION IS, IN ORDER
FOR US TO REACH THAT, IS THERE A SENSE THAT THE POLICY ORDER WE
PASSED MAY NOT BE ENOUGH AND WE SHOULD CONSIDER AN ORDINANCE
CHANGE AND HOW IT THAT THE CITY MANAGER AND STAFF WE CAN GET TO
A POINT WHERE ALL THE PROJECTS MATCH BOSTON IF NOT GOING BEYOND.
>> CITY MANAGER: I KNOW WE PEOPLE ON THE LINE AND I WILL ASK THEM
TO JUMP IN. WHOEVER WANTS TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THE QUESTION.
>> MS. FAROOQ: THANK YOU. THE POLICY ORDER THAT WAS PASSED, GAVE
US A REALLY GOOD PLATFORM TO BEGIN TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT IN
A MORE DETAILED AND SPECIFIC WAY THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY WITH
DEVELOPERS AROUND INCREASING THE ELECTRIC REFILE CHARGING
STATIONS IN THE PARK ING GARAGES. THE TRICKY PIECE IS, ANYTIME WE
HAVE ANY WE ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT MY GOODNESS.
IT IS NOT ASSURED THAT WE'LL GET THE COMPLETE OUTCOME THAT IS
DESIRED WHEN IT IS PART OF A CONVERSATION AND NEGOTIATION WITH A
LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED AROUND MITIGATION. I
THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE SWITCH WITH VOLPE, IT HAS BEEN A
VERY POSITIVE TREND BECAUSE THE BIGGEST PART OF THE FRAMEWORK,
INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK, IT IS ACTUALLY HAVING ALL OF THE PARKING
SPOTS BEING EV READY SO THAT THE SWITCH CAN HAPPEN AS NEEDED. THE
10% THAT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO DOING UP FRONT IS I'M
SORRY. THE PERCENTAGE IS LOWER THAN THE DESIRED 25%; HOWEVER,
THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SWITCH BASED ON MONITORING DOES EXIST. IF THE
COUNCIL WANTS THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT, THEN I THINK THE WAY TO DO
IT WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY CREATE THAT REQUIREMENT. I KNOW THAT WAS
DISCUSSED WHEN WE HAD CONVERSATIONS OF THE TRANSPORTATION
COMMITTEE AROUND PARKING ISSUES.
SO, CERTAINLY IT COULD BE AS COUNCIL CONTEMPLATING MAKING
CHANGES, THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE PIECES THAT COULD BE
CONTEMPLATED AT THE TIME.
>> THROUGH YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, I WOULD JUST ADD, THIS
CONVERSATION CAME UP FAIRLY LATE IN THE GAME AS IT WERE IN TERMS OF
THE REVIEW OF VOLPE'S MITIGATIONS. I THINK IT WAS NOT SPRUNG ON
THEM AS A SURPRISE, BUT WE HAD BEEN FAIRLY ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS
AND FAIRLY ALONG IN THE DESIGN OF THE FACILITY. I THINK THE FACT THAT
WE WOUND UP WITH 10% IN THIS CASE, I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY IT IS
INDICATIVE WE COULDN'T GET TO 25% WITH OTHER PROJECTS. THIS WAS
MIDSTREAM AND GETTING THE 10% WAS QUITE GOOD. HONESTLY, I THINK A

PAGE 5

Jun 1, 2020

LOT OF DEVELOPERS ARE COMING TO SEE THIS AS A TENTATIVE AMENITY
THEY WANT TO PROVIDE. IT WASN'T A PUSHBACK ON THE CONCEPT, IT IS
WHAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE DAY ONE AND WHAT WE PROVIDE AS TIME
GOES BY. I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY IN THE FUTURE, THE 25% INSTALLED AT
THE BEGINNING WILL BE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. AND DIRECTOR FAROOQ AND
DIRECTOR BARR, AS I WAS SAID, I APPRECIATE VOLPE WAS ALREADY
UNDERWAY. THERE ARE MANY PROJECTS, WHETHER IT IS IQHQ THAT ARE
EARLIER ON IN THE PROCESS. I WOULD HOPE WE TALK VERY CLEARLY TO
THEM THAT WE HAVE PASSED A POLICY ORDER THAT DID SAY IT 25% EV
INSTALLED. AS DOTED AS DIRECTOR BARR AND ALL OF US KNOW, BY 2030
AND 2035, CAR MANUFACTURES WON'T BE PRODUCING CARS THAT ARE NOT
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THIS IS SOMETHING EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD THINK
ABOUT, WHETHER IT IS 25% OR 50% INSTALLED. CERTAINLY, MAKE SURE WE
POSITION OURSELVES TO ENSURE THAT WHOEVER IS IN THE CITY, IF THEY ARE
BUILDING PARKING SPOTS, WHICH IS ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT
WHETHER VEHICLE USE WILL INCREASE OR NOT, FOR ALL VEHICLES WE HAVE,
THEY ALL HAVE TO BE TRANSFORMED TO EV. I'M GLAD TO HEAR AS WAS
SAID, IT COULD BE FUTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE ONLY NOW AND IN EARLY
STAGE, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WILL BE IT IS ALREADY ON THE RECORD. IF
YOU START NOW, THIS IS ON THE RECORD, I'M HEARING WE THINK IT MAY BE
A MORE FEASIBLE GOAL? YET, THE COUNCIL CAN CONSIDER PUTTING THIS
INTO A MORE FORMAL REQUEST IN OUR ORDINANCE? THOSE ARE TWO
QUESTIONS. IF THAT MAKES SENSE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO HEAR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYBODY GOING TO ANSWER?
>> MR. BARR: SORRY. ON THE SECOND QUESTION, I THINK, YES, SOMETHING
THAT LIKELY TO HAVE MORE SUCCESS AND WE ARE HAVING WITH GETTING
25% AT THE BEGINNING AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH DEVELOPERS AS
PROJECTS COME THROUGH. AS THE RESPONSE NOTED, IT HAPPENED WE HAD
A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BEFORE US THAT DON'T ACTUAL IT IS A
GOOD THING BUT THEY DON'T REQUIRE EXPANSION OF PARKING OR
MAKING USE OF EXISTING PARKING. THE OPPORTUNITY DIDN'T EXIST IN
QUITE THE SAME WAY. WE'LL STILL BE TALKING WITH THOSE PEOPLE ABOUT
THE NEED TO BE READY AS COUNCILLOR NOLAN SAID FOR FUTURE WHERE
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE COMMON AND EVENTUALLY MAKE UP THE VAST
MAJORITY OF THE FLEET.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: GREAT. THANK YOU. AS WE SAY AND KNOW, THIS
IS LITERALLY SOMETHING THAT IS COMING QUICKER THAN WE REALIZE. I
KNOW THE CLIMATE CRISIS WORKING GROUP IS WORKING ON THIS AREA AND
I'M GLAD TO HEAR I ENCOURAGE TO LET YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STATED
POLICY OF 25% EV INSTALLED AND 100% EV READY. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. OF COURSE,
NOTHING IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THE MOMENT UNDER VOLPE, OTHER

PAGE 6

Jun 1, 2020

THAN THE FEDERAL FACILITY. AND MANY MODIFICATIONS ARE MADE BEFORE
CONSTRUCTION AND DURING CONSTRUCTION. SO, IF I UNDERSTAND
CORRECTLY, BEING READY TO INSTALL ELECTRICAL DEVICES FOR CARS, SO I
ASSUME THE ELECTRICAL WIRING WILL BE DONE AND WHATEVER MOUNTING
IS NECESSARY WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE DESIGN TO TAKE THE FUTURE
DEVICE. WHEN THEY SAY THEY WILL BE READY OR JUST PROVIDING SPACE TO
WIRE AND PUT THE MOUNTING IN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT READY MEANS,
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING.
>> MS. FAROOQ: IT IS MORE THAN THE SPACE. IT DOES INCLUDE THE WIRING
AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE IN PLACE SO IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO SWITCH
TO AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGER AS NEEDED. I THINK PART OF I THINK
EVERYBODY, ON THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, IS ALSO STARTING TO
RECOGNIZE THE ITEMS THAT ARE BEING POINTED OUT BY COUNCILLORS THIS
IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IS MOVING IN. SO, THEY
CERTAINLY SEE, I'D SAY THE VALUE OF HAVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN
PLACE SO THEY CAN RETROFIT. I WILL SAY, THE SLIGHT RELUCTANCE IS
AROUND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY VEHICLES
WOULD BE AT THE VERY START OF THE OPENING OF THEIR PROJECT ELECTRIC
VEHICLES. I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THING WE HEAR. THE RELUCTANCE, IF IT
IS AN EV CHARGING SPOT, INTERNAL COMBUSTION PEOPLE, CANNOT PARK
THERE. AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE TRYING THE LEAST THIS IS THE
CONVERSATION WITH VOLPE, THEY ARE TRYING TO EVALUATE AND FIGURE
OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE DRIVING EV VEHICLES. AND INCREASE THE
CHARGING LOCATIONS AS NEEDED.
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE FIRST STEP AND IT WOULD BE A LOT HARDER IF
THE WIRING WERE NOT IN PLACE. WHEREAS, ONCE YOU HAVE THAT, IT IS A
MUCH EASIER SWITCH OVER TIME.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU FOR THAT. THROUGH YOU, MADAM
MAYOR, I MIGHT SUGGESTION IN YOUR NEGOTIATIONS, WHATEVER THE
PERCENTAGE IS, IT IS THE FIRST PARKING SPACES YOU SEE. JUST TO REMIND
EVERYBODY, WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF I HAD AN ELECTRIC CAR. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. GLAD TO SEE
THIS REPORT. I DID WANT TO COMMENT ON BRIEFLY AS MR. BARR SAID, THE
SILVER LINING OR THE GOOD NEWS IN THE REPORT, MOST OF THE
DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT TRYING TO ADD PARKING. THAT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN HAVING PARKING WITH EV CHARGING. IF OUR GOAL IS TO REQUIRE A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EV CHARGING STATIONS, WHY NOT JUST PUT THAT IN
THE ZONING. SO IT IS REQUIRED RATHER THAN NEGOTIATED. KEEP IN MIND,
THIS IS ALL IMPACTING NEW CONSTRUCTION, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DEAL
WITH THE EXISTING PARKING FACILITIES. AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE
GOING TO GET MORE CHARGING CAPACITY THERE.
THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. I'M PLANNING TO INTRODUCE A
REDUCTION IN PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ULTIMATELY A BIGGER GOAL HERE


PAGE 7

Jun 1, 2020

IS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT WE'RE ADDING. WE'RE NOT
GOING TO NEED THAT MUCH IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP ON THIS. WE CAN
DO A MOTION TO PLACE THIS ON FILE AND THEN WE DO HAVE SOMEONE
WHO HAS COME BACK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WE'LL GO TO HER.
>> MR. CLERK: ON PLACING THIS ITEM ON FILE: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR,
ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE MADELINE MCDOWELL?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> MY GOODNESS. SUCH TROUBLE FOR US NERDS. I HAVE FOUR TOPICS,
NONE OF WHICH ARE ON THE AGENDA.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, IF THEY ARE NOT ON THE AGENDA, I'M SORRY, YOU
CAN'T SPEAK TO THEM.
>> WELL, HOW CAN I GET TO COMPLAINING ABOUT THE RANK CHOICE? OR

THE CITY COUNCIL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. SHE'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW TO
REACH US AND YOU CAN WRITE OR SHARE SHE WILL SHARE INFORMATION
HOW TO GET IN CONTACT WITH ALL OF US.
>> I'D BE DELIGHTED AND THANK YOU. THIS IS A VERY GOOD THING. AND I

DECADES. WORKED IN THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT. IN THE FOOD SERVICE
DEPARTMENT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE
FITZGERALD COMMUNITY SCHOOL PROGRAM. IT IS SO ODD TO BE ADVISED
OF THE PASSING, TWO WEEKS AGO SHE WAS SITTING ON THE PORCH HAVING
A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WEATHER AND OTHER THINGS, APPEARED TO
BE FIT AND IN THE BEST OF HEALTH. TO HEAR THAT SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY
WARNING THAT SHE HAD PASSED. I PLACE THIS RESOLUTION IN FRONT OF
THE COUNCIL AND I HOPE THAT ALL THE MEMBERS WILL JOIN IN MARKING

AMAZING EVENT THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER 50 DIFFERENT DISTANCE

PAGE 9

Jun 1, 2020

COMMUNITIES FROM EVERY TRADITION YOU CAN IMAGINE, OPEN TO THE
STREETS OF CAMBRIDGE. IT WAS DONE SAFELY, IT WAS DONE IN
PARTNERSHIP WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT NOT ONLY DANCE STYLES BUT
AGE OF DANCERS AND MUSICIANS. IT WAS A JOYFUL EVENT. I HOPE IT IS A I
HOPE CAMBRIDGE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE FUTURE AS WE HAVE MORE
FESTIVALS. THIS COUNCIL TALKS ABOUT ART ORGANIZATIONS STRUGGLING
AND I STOPPED BY AND THERE WAS SOME APPRECIATION FOR WHAT WE TRY
TO DO AND A PLEA FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE. THERE IS SUCH A
GREAT NEED OUT THERE AMONG THE ARTS COMMUNITY. THEY ARE JUST
SOME OF THEM HAVE GONE UNDER AS WE KNOW, AND I KNOW VICE MAYOR
MALLON SHAKING HER HEAD, SHE IS AWARE OF THIS AND HAVING SPENT
TIME ON THIS. THE COMBINED APPRECIATION, GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS,
GLAD THE CITY DID WHAT IT COULD, THERE IS A REAL SENSE TO DO MORE TO
MAKE SURE THE ACTIVITIES WITH RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS CAN CONTINUE
INTO THE FUTURE SO WE CAN BRING THE JOY AND THE ARTS INTO OUR CITY
AND THE MANY WAYS WE'D LIKE TO. I THANK ALL OF THE COSPONSORS FOR
THIS AND I KNOW WE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH THE LEADERS OF
THAT ORGANIZATION, JOSE AND SCOTT, THEY TRY TO KEEP IT GOING DESPITE
DESPERATE TIMES. THANK YOU AND I YIELD.

RESOLUTION #10
Resolution on the death of
Donald Burroughs.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT OR EXCUSE ME.
TAKE A STEP BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT THE MAKER OF THIS
RESOLUTION A LOT ME TO BE JOINED AS A COSPONSOR OF THE RESOLUTION
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS KNOWN AND HAD HER CHILDREN LEARN UNDER HIM
AND PERSONALLY KNOW HIM. IT WAS SHOCKED AND SADDENED TO SEE HE
HAD PASSED AT A YOUNG AGE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE'S INDULGENCE, I
WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU ARE ADDED ALREADY.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WILL SAY BRIEFLY, I KNEW DONALD AND HAVE
TO ADMIT HE TAUGHT AT PILOT WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL, IN HIGH SCHOOL. I
DIDN'T HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ACTUALLY HAVING HIM AS A TEACHER AS I
WAS NOT IN PILOT. UNFORTUNATELY. KNEW HIM VERY WELL, KNEW A LOT
OF HIS STUDENTS, AND IT IS JUST ACTUALLY A TESTAMENT TO HIM AS A
PERSON AND EDUCATOR, HE INFLUENCED PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY
IN HIS CLASS. AND I KNEW HIM FOR A LONG TIME, POST GRADUATION, AND
HE IS GOING TO BE SORELY MISSED. HE WAS TRULY, TRULY, TRULY
WONDERFUL INDIVIDUAL. SO, MY CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY AND
EVERYBODY WHO LOVED HIM.

WERE MISPRINTED. I SPOKE TO THE CLERK AND HE SAID THEY CAN BE DONE
ADMINISTRATIVELY AND WE DON'T HAVE TO ROLL CALL.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO BRIEFLY CALL
ATTENTION TO THIS WONDERFUL EVENT THAT HAPPENED ABOUT A WEEK
AGO IN DANEHY PARK, WITH THE HELP OF DPW AND SEVERAL
ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS SEVERAL NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN. WE WERE
ABLE TO PLANT A MINI FOREST IN THE PARK. AND THE RESOLUTION
INCLUDES A PICTURE OF THE PLANTINGS, AS WELL AS LINKS TO THE WEBSITES
FOR THIS ORGANIZATION THAT HELP DESIGN AND ORGANIZE THIS EVENT. I
ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUES AND THE PUBLIC TO LOOK INTO IT, ESPECIALLY TO
GO VISIT THE FOREST AND ENJOY IT AS IT GROWS INTO MATURITY. THANK
YOU.

NUMBER 1). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES, THANK YOU, I WANT TO AMEND THIS BY
ADDING YOU AS A SPONSOR AS WELL. AND THEN SECOND TO THAT, I BRING
THIS FORWARD, I HAVE SPOKEN TO A FEW COLLEAGUES, COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, AROUND THIS ISSUE. BACK IN
2002, WE TRIED TO DO A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND THEN AGAIN IN 2010. AS
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE POLICY ORDER, IT RAN FROM APRIL 2011. THE
PROGRAM STILL STANDS AND CAMBRIDGE PEOPLE DO PARTICIPATE, BUT THE
IDEA BEHIND THE PROGRAM WAS REALLY FOR IT TO BE BASED HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE AND REALLY BRING IN THE COMMUNITY OF COLOR, BLACK MEN,
IN PARTICULAR, BUT NOT EXCLUDING BLACK WOMEN OR LATINX OR OTHER
MARGINALIZED GROUPS. AS YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TELL AND OFTEN SEE,
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, IT IS WOEFULLY
ABSENT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND NOT THEY TAKE A DISINTEREST IN THE
AREA OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THERE ARE OTHER PRESSING ISSUES, SUCH AS
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY WAY, I BELIEVE, FOR US
TO DO TWO THINGS. ENGAGE AND ENLARGE THE INTEREST OF THIS OFTEN
MISSED COMMUNITY IN THE CONVERSATION AROUND AND IN THE WEALTH
BUILDING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS BRING IT BACK INTO
CAMBRIDGE.

DHSP that engages key
stakeholders that includes, but
is not limited to, the Agenda for
Children, current and former
out of school time staff and
leadership, and out of school
time community benefit
organizations. Such a council
will receive reports as ordered
by Policy Order 2021 #201 that
describe who applied and were
enrolled, capacity, staffing, and
outreach efforts.

I HAVE TALKED TO CHRIS JONAH, WE STARTED THE GREEN JOBS PROGRAM
TOGETHER SO VERY MANY YEARS AGO. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORDER, IT
CALLS THAT WE ENGAGE THE CIVIC UNIT, TALKS ABOUT FAIRNESS, HUMAN
SERVICES, SUPPORTS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND TALKS ABOUT WEALTH
BUILDING, AND HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE IT IS AN
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE WE TALK ABOUT. AND I HOPE, IN FACT I'M SURE,
THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL GET TOGETHER AND WE'LL REINVENT,
REALIGN, REASSIGN, AND REASSESS THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM, BUILDING ON
THAT. AND BUILDING A PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO BE STRONGLY
SUCCESSFUL SO THAT IT WOULD BE A MODEL, I HOPE, FOR OTHER CITIES AND
TOWNS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT WILL BE EMPLOYMENT, BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR
AREA. I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES MAYOR SIDDIQUI, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US AND I HOPE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL VOTE FAVORABLY FOR
THIS ORDER SO WE CAN GET THE WORK STARTED. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I DEFINITELY
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS WITH YOU AND OTHERS. IT IS A
REALLY IMPORTANT AREA. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON IT. WE'LL
DO A GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. AND WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR
NOLAN AND THEN GO FROM THERE. GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND THE COSPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I'M GLAD
TO SEE THIS COMING BACK TO THE COUNCIL'S ATTENTION. AS YOU MAY
KNOW, I PUT FORWARD THE GREEN NEW DEAL ZONING PETITION, WHICH
ALSO CALLS FOR A GREEN JOBS PROGRAM AND WORKING WITH THE MAYOR
AND OTHER COLLEAGUES TO CODIFY THAT INTO A SEPARATE ORDINANCE AS


PAGE 12

Jun 1, 2020

IT WAS ADVISED TO US THAT PIECE DOESN'T FIT IN THE ZONING ITSELF.
I THINK THIS CONVERSATION OF LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE OVER
THE LAST TEN OR 20 YEARS, WHAT HAS WORKED AND WHAT HAS NOT
WORKED, IT IS REALLY VALUABLE IN MAKING SURE THAT AS WE MOVE
FORWARD, WE ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL. I HAVE BEEN
SPEAKING WITH PRACTITIONERS IN THE PROGRAM, PARTICULARLY IN ENERGY
EFFICIENCY AREAS. AND THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME CHALLENGES THERE
AROUND RECRUITMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
BEING TRAINED FOR THE TYPES OF JOBS ARE SUITABLE FOR DOING THAT TYPE
OF WORK. WE HAVE SEEN RENEWED INTEREST AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND MAKING A LIVING IN THAT SPACE AS
WELL. THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE. A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO
TAP INTO. IT NEEDS MORE FUNDING AND THE GREEN NEW DEAL PETITION
PROPOSES A NEW FUNDING MECHANISM BY CHARGING FOR EMISSIONS
FROM COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO CREATE MORE
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND TO EXPAND THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT WE
THINK ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GREEN JOBS. THERE'S A LOT MORE
ACTIVITY IN THE CITY AROUND URBAN AGRICULTURE, URBAN FORESTRY, FOR
EXAMPLE. OPPORTUNITIES IN ELECTRIC AL THERE'S AN IMPORTANT LINK
WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS, THE RISHTA PROGRAM, WE SHOULD
EXPLORE TO MAKE SURE THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO THESE CAREER
OPPORTUNITIES EARLY ON SO THAT LATER IN THEIR LIFE, AS THEY LOOK FOR
JOBS OR TRY TO DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION TO GO IN, THEY HAVE THAT
RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO THEM, THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT THE TYPE OF JOBS
ARE OUT THERE AND THE PROGRAMS THE TRAINING PROGRAMS EXIST TO
HELP THEM GET PREPARED AND REALLY BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO OBTAIN
THE JOBS.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
CONTINUING TO WORK IN PARALLEL ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL PIECE AS
WELL. AND HOPEFULLY, WE'LL HAVE EVEN BETTER RESULTS THAN WE DID IN
THE PAST. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I GO TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. AND THANK YOU TO
THE MAKERS OF THIS. I'M THRILLED TO SUPPORT THIS. WOULD LOVE TO BE
ADDED, IF THAT MAKES SENSE. THIS IS SOMETHING I WAS AWARE OF. AS
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID, ON THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE, IT WAS TALKED
ABOUT SOMETHING AS WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THERE'S
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE YOUTH ACROSS ALL AGES, IN PARTICULAR YOUNG
PEOPLE. PARTICULARLY, I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS BRINGING TOGETHER A
RANGE OF COMMITTEES SO WE CAN APPROACH IT FROM A NUMBER OF
PERSPECTIVES AND SPECIFICALLY TO ASK FOR AND EVALUATION AND
MONITORING OF WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED IN THE PROGRAM, WHAT WERE
THE REASONS THAT FIVE OF WHO WERE PLACED IN JOBS AND FOUR
WORKING IN THE FIELD A YEAR LATER. WHAT ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT AND
WHAT WERE THE BARRIERS THAT PREVENTED THE OTHERS. THAT'S THE
THINKING AND OVERSIGHT THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR US TO INCLUDE IN


PAGE 13

Jun 1, 2020

SO MANY MORE OF THE WORK AS WE MUCH THIS WORK FORWARD, WE CAN
FASHION A PROGRAM THAT WILL YIELD THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO SEE
AND WHILE THESE ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS TO SEE IF WE CAN GET
MORE. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SO, WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. JUST BRIEFLY, I MOVE THAT ALL
COUNCILLORS BE LISTED AS SPONSORS. THIS IS A CITY WIDE EFFORT. AND
THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE CLEARER TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WE ALL
WANT THIS. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE MOTION TO ADD THE REST OF THE COUNCIL,
ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL): NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED.

Councillor Carlone motion to
add all Councillors to Policy
Order #1

Policy Order #1 as amended
That the City Manager is
requested to make available the
appropriate staff and
information pertaining to past
efforts to establish a Green
Jobs program.

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 2. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 2). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT
TO AMEND THIS IS BLACK, LATINX, AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE
OF COLOR. I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, SEVERAL YEARS
AGO, MAYBE ABOUT FOUR AT THIS POINT, I INSTITUTED THE PAY EQUITY
INITIATIVE. AND WHAT WE SAW WAS A GLARING DISPARITY, PARTICULARLY
AMONG BLACK WOMEN, LATINX WOMEN, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, BUT I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR,
BASICALLY MEANS NON WHITE. THEY WERE UNDERREPRESENTED WHEN YOU
WENT UP THE PAY SCALE. AND THIS CONTINUES TO BE THE PROBLEM. WHAT
WE DO, AS YOU LOOK AT THE PYRAMID, THE WORK PYRAMID, THERE ARE
PEOPLE OF COLOR, BLACK PEOPLE, LATINX, I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, SOMETHING WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE, THERE IS
MORE DIVERSITY. AS YOU GO UP THE RANKS, IT IS GLARINGLY APPARENT WE
DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF DIVERSITY THAT WE HOLD OTHER PEOPLE
ACCOUNTABLE TO. AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME, I THINK FOR THIS
COUNCIL, WE ARE VERY PROACTIVE ABOUT RIGHTING THIS WRONG. AS WE
CELEBRATE ON OCTOBER 7, THE BIRTHDAY OF KITTY KNOX, A BLACK WOMAN
THAT REVOLUTIONIZED BIKING
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS 6:30. I'M SORRY.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I CAN FINISH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL LET YOU FINISH AND THEN DO THE VOTE. AND
WE'LL COME BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: KITTY KNOX REVOLUTIONIZED BIKING OR
ELIZABETH (UNKNOWN NAME), SUED FOR FREEDOM, I'M TALKING ABOUT

WOMEN, WHOSE BACKS ARE A BRIDGE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S SUCCESS. WE
HAVE DONE SO POORLY FOR SO LONG AND SO I'M BRINGING THIS FORWARD
AND I'M HOPING THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL NOT ONLY ADOPT IT, BUT THEY
WILL PUT THEIR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL OF MOVING EQUITY AND ACCESS
FORWARD FOR UNDERREPRESENTED PEOPLE AND TO WOMEN IN OUR CITY.
IF WE CAN NOT ASK OTHERS TO DO WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE OURSELVES. I
YIELD THE FLOOR.

Amend Policy Order #2 to
insert “LatinX” into first
ordered paragraph

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. WE WILL WE HAVE
AN AMENDMENT. IT IS, FOR THE RECORD, TO ADD LATINX AFTER BEFORE
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE? I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR FOR THE CLERK?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: BLACK PEOPLE, LATINX, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE,
AND PEOPLE OF COLOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. ON THAT AMENDMENT, ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE POLICY ORDER
FORWARD. VERY IMPORTANT. WE'LL DO I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO, WE
CAN GO TO THE TAX HEARING AND THEN GO BACK TO THE POLICY ORDER.
WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON ADJOURNING FROM COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: ADJOURNING OR RECESSING?
Recess regular meeting to Tax
Rate hearing

RATE? (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL PARKS AT DIFFERENT TAX RATES. WE'LL REVIEW


PAGE 15

Jun 1, 2020

TAX RATES CLASSIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY THE CITY MANAGER AND THE
BOARD OF ASSESSORS. THE VOTES WILL BE TAKEN AND WILL RESULT IN
PROPERTY TAX RATE THAT REFLECT THE CITY'S PROPERTY TAX LEVEE FOR
FISCAL YEAR 2022. WE'LL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST AND THEN GO TO
THE PRESENTATION. WE'LL START WITH CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT. I ASK YOU
STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. AND YOU WILL HAVE
THREE MINUTES.
>> CHRISTOPHER, 17 LAUREL STREET. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND TO
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. THANK YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER TO PUT
TOGETHER A TAX LETTER TO SUMMARIZE THE TAX POSITION. I APPRECIATE
THE POSITION THE CITY IS IN AND THE ABILITY IT GIVES YOU TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH THE EXCELLENT PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES IT DOES
PROVIDE. AS I HAVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS, I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
SOME OF THE REQUESTS IN THE TAX LETTER. MANY OF THE VOTES YOU WILL
TAKE TONIGHT ARE REASONABLE AND NECESSARY TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE
TAX LOADS AND HANDLING OF SENIOR CITIZENS AND INCREASING
ALLOWANCES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY ARE GREAT AND VOTE
YES. HOWEVER, AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, THE CITY MANAGER REQUESTED
THAT THE CITY USE MONEY FROM FREE CASH TO LOWER ITS TAX LEVEE. TO
BE CLEAR, THIS IS LOWERING THE TAX LEVEE FROM WHAT THE COUNCIL
APPROVED IN JUNE. THE COUNCIL VOTED TO APPROVE IT AND THE CITY
MANAGER IS ASKING TO REDUCE IT NOW. AND THE TAX LETTER ASSERTS A
WITH THE PROJECTED DEBT NEGOTIATIONS, THE CITY'S ABILITY TO FUND
PROJECTS IS LIMITED. THIS IS THE POSITION WE SHOULD SEEK TO NOT BE IN.
AND ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE, WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO ADDITIONAL
PROJECTS, NOT NECESSARILY WITH ALL THE PREPARATION. TO MITIGATE THE
COST OF THE DEBT SERVICES, THEY USE 9.5 OF DEBT STABILIZATION FUND.
GIVEN THE CALLS FOR DEBT ISSUANCE, DAWNING DOWN THE FUNDS SEEMS
UNWISE. I'M NOT AN EXPERT, IF I MANAGE MY BUDGET, THAT WOULD SEEM
STRANGE. OUR FREE CASH COST REMAIN HIGH. AND THE CITY SPENT MORE
THAN $75 MILLION FROM FREE CASH THIS YEAR AND THOSE THINGS HAVE
GONE TO VERY IMPORTANT COSTS, LIKE IMPROVING SCHOOLS, CIRCULATION,
COVID TESTING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A
PANDEMIC AND HAVE COSTS THAT WILL COME UP THAT WE CAN'T FORESEE.
AND THIS YEAR, IT IS A YEAR WITH A CHANGE TAX ASSESSMENT MODEL, THE
CHOICE HAS SEEN A LOW NUMBER OF ABATEMENT REQUESTS, EXPECTING
THAT TO CONTINUE IS DUBIOUS AND EXPECT THE OVERLAY BALANCE AS
WELL. THE CITY MANAGER DOES A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS AND THE
COUNCIL HAVE DONE A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS TO ACHIEVE GOALS, I
THINK THERE ARE MORE TO DO. ASIDE, THE CITY COUNCIL JUST VOTED TO
APPROVE THE TAX LEVEE. TAKING WHAT WE HAVE THE HIGH DEBT LOAD AND
INABILITY TO PURSUE OTHER PROJECTS AND LOWERING THE FREE CASH IT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE ON THE FIRST
VOTE YOU WILL TAKE TONIGHT TO LOWER THE TAX LEVEE BY 22.5 MILLION
FROM FREE CASH. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ITAMAR TURNER TRAURING.


PAGE 16

Jun 1, 2020

>> HELLO. I'M SPEAKING ON THE $TWO MILLION IN FREE CASH THAT IS
GOING TO 22 IN FREE CASH. WE BOUGHT A CONDO IN CAMBRIDGE IN 2014.
AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT IS, IT IS APPROXIMATELY
PROPERTY VALUE OF ABOUT 50% SINCE THEN. AND THIS IS NOT BECAUSE OF
ANYTHING WE DID, IT IS JUST YOU KNOW THE VALUE FALLING FROM THE
SKY. IT IS REALLY TERRIBLE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, RISING PROPERTY VALUES,
YOU HAVE HIGHER (INAUDIBLE)... THE BROADER THING GOING ON,
EVERYBODY THAT OWNS PROPERTY IN CAMBRIDGE, IS DOING IN THE END
REALLY QUITE WELL ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE PROPERTY VALUES GO
UP. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE QUITE LOW PROPERTY TAXES. AND
BASICALLY WHAT THE CITY MANAGER IS PROPOSING IS TO SAY... INSTEAD OF
KEEPING THE MONEY WHERE WE CAN SPEND IT, PRESUMABLY MOST
SPENDING GOING ON PEOPLE NEED IT, YOU CAN SPEND $22 MILLION ON
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS MONEY IS GOING TO PROPERTY OWNERS,
WHOSE VALUES HAVE GONE UP QUITE A LOT.
LANDLORDS, PROPERTY OWNERS IN KENDALL, THE PROPERTY VALUES KEEP
GOING UP. AND SO, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD USE OF $22 MILLION.
GIVING IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT IN THE CITY AND THE COMPANIES
THAT NEED IT IN THE CITY. I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE ITEM
FOR TAKING MONEY FROM FREE CASH AND THE PROPERTY TAXES. WE HAVE
QUITE LOW PROPERTY TAXES, IT IS OKAY FOR PEOPLE TO PAY SLIGHTLY MORE,
COMPANIES TO PAY MORE, AND HAVE 22 MILLION YOU CAN SPEND ON MORE
USEFUL THINGS, FOR EXAMPLE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S ALL THAT SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
WE HAVE SOMEONE ON ZOOM, BETHANY STEVENS, WHO SIGNED UP FOR
POLICY ORDER 5. WE MOVED ON FROM THAT PUBLIC COMMENT. BETHANY,
PLEASE DO EMAIL US. AND WE'LL LOOK. I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT'S IT? 22
million.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT.

Roll Call to close Public
Comment

>> MR. CLERK: (ROLL CALL):
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL GIVE A BRIEF STATEMENT AND TURN IT OVER TO
DAVID KALE. 20 YEARS AGO, THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO, WE HAD A MAJOR
INCREASE IN THE PROPERTY TAX BILLS. WE HAD A LOT OF RESIDENTS UP
HERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR BILLS AND ASSESSING DEPARTMENT. AND THE
FINANCE DEPARTMENT. THEY WENT OUT TO WORK WITH THE PROPERTY TAX
OWNERS TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. DURING THAT YEAR, THE CITY
MANAGER AND THE CITY MANAGER FOR FINANCE, WHICH WAS MYSELF,
COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE MOVING FORWARD OUR TAX BILLS WILL BE
STABLE. MODERATE INCREASES AND PREDICTABLE. AND THE TAXES WOULD
BE PREDICTABLE, NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RESIDENTS, BECAUSE WE STILL
PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES AND MAINTAINING THE STRONGEST
FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE STATE. 20 YEARS LATER, WE ACCOMPLISH THAT.
WE HAVE THE STRONGEST FINANCIAL CITY IN THE STATE, WE USE FREE CASH
WHEN NEEDED AND CONTROLLED BILLS. AND THIS PLAN CONTINUES TO DO
THIS. I WILL RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS,
BUT WHEN WE MADE THAT PREDICTION, NOBODY EXPECTED TWO YEARS OF

PAGE 17

Jun 1, 2020

COVID. IT HANDCUFFED MANY CITIES AND TOWNS TO BE IN REAL BAD
FINANCIAL POSITION. OUR POLICIES OF CONTROLLING TAXES, KEEPING
AVAILABLE BALANCES, HAS PUT THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE AS THE ENVY OF
EVERY CITY IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO. THE FREE
CASH AND FINANCE POSITION, WHILE USING IT, FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS TO
HELP REDUCE TAXES, LAST YEAR RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT DUE TO COVID,
WE NEED TO HELP CERTAIN AREAS THAT WERE NOT ANYWHERE IN THE
FINANCE PROGRAM TO SAY THIS WAS COMING.
WE TOOK A LOOK AT $9 MILLION FOR COVID, 19 RELIEF IN TERMS OF FOOD
AND LODGING AND SHELTERS, ESPECIALLY AROUND HOMELESS POPULATION,
UNHOUSED, $9 MILLION FOR SCHOOL ISSUES, OPEN SPACE PROPERTY CAME
UP, NOT PREPARED, $18.5, WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT. WE KNEW IT WAS THE
RIGHT THING. WE ADDRESSED FOUNDRY, WAR MEMORIAL AND SNOW.
AGAIN, WITH OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, THIS YEAR OVER $60 MILLION, MOST
NOT PREDICTED, BUT DUE TO COVID, WE COULD HANDLE. WE'LL CONTINUE
TO LOOK AT THAT. I THINK MORE AMAZINGLY, WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO
PRODUCE IN THE FY 22 BUDGET. WE INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AS I
STATED IN THE PAST, WE COMMIT TO DOUBLE IT IN THE 3 5 YEAR PERIOD
AND NOW IN A THREE YEAR PERIOD, WE ARE UP 137%. WE ARE PROUD OF
THAT. SCHOOL BUDGETS IN MANY CITIES AND TOWNS WERE REDUCED, WE
WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THE BUDGET BY 5.3%. SOMETHING WE ARE PROUD
OF. AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE MAJOR CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IN THE CITY AND NOT MAKING CAPITAL IN AN
AREA WE'D BALANCE OUT. AS WELL AS EXTENDING PROGRAMS IN MANY
AREAS.
WITH THAT, THIS CURRENT RATE WILL ALLOW 75% OF OUR RESIDENTS TO
HAVE AN INCREASE OF LESS $250, WHICH WE FEEL IS VERY IMPORTANT,
ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF COVID. I THINK THIS YEAR, DUE TO COVID, WE
HAVE SEEN ONE CLASS CATEGORY, SINGLE FAMILIES, DUE TO THE INCREASE
IN ASSESSMENTS BILLS INCREASE BEYOND WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY HAD.
THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER TO KEEP THAT BALANCE, WE FEEL $22 MILLION
IS THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER. I WILL REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE
THIS IS A A 1 2 YEAR RESPONSE USING THE EXTRA $11 MILLION, WITHOUT
FURTHER ADO TO COVID WE LOST $20 MILLION IN RECEIPTS. SO I'M REALLY
PLEASED TO SAY THIS IS A BUDGET AND A TAX RATE THAT THE RESIDENTS
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE MODERATE INCREASES AND WILL CONTINUE TO
PROVIDE THE SERVICES WE FEEL IS NECESSARY THAT THEY EXPECT AND THAT
WE WANT TO GIVE AND REALLY ADDRESS COUNCIL PRIORITIES, WHICH IS ONE
OF THE GOALS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS TAX RATE TO MAKE SURE WE PUT
NUMBERS IN THAT RESPECT THE GOALS OF THE COUNCIL. WITH THAT, I WILL
TURN IT OVER TO DAVID TO GET INTO SPECIFIC NUMBERS. THANK YOU.
>> DAVID KALE: THANK YOU MR. MANAGER. HOUSEKEEPING, WE SENT TO
THE COUNCIL THIS MORNING AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY DOCUMENT THAT
TAKES THE TAX LETTER AND CONDENSES IT INTO TWO PAGES. IF YOU NEED A
COPY, I HAVE EXTRA COPIES HERE. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE COMPLETED
SENDING OUT OUR FIRST NEWSLETTER TO RESIDENTS. AND OUR SECOND


PAGE 18

Jun 1, 2020

NEWSLETTER, WITH THE VOTES TONIGHT, THEY WILL BE SENT OUT SHORTLY.
AND IN TERMS OF HIGHLIGHTS, I THINK THE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT
THE MANAGER MENTIONED, WE WERE IN A FORTUNATE POSITION PRIOR TO
THE PANDEMIC TO GENERATE $16 MILLION IN MOTEL/HOTEL EXCISE
REVENUE, IT WAS REDUCED TO $4 MILLION IN THE 20 BUDGET AND REMAIN
THERE AT THE 22 BUDGET. THE HOTELS SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD SUMMER,
THEY CLEARLY WERE IN A POSITION WHERE OCCUPANCY WAS DOWN. AND
RATES WERE DOWN ALSO. THAT IS A REVENUE THAT WE CLEARLY HAVE HAD
A REDUCTION. HOPEFULLY, IT WILL COME BACK IN LARGE PART FOR THE FY23
BUDGET, WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED TO USE MORE IN FREE CASH.
MEALS TAX, WE COLLECTED ALMOST $5 MILLION IN THE FY22 BUDGET. AND
WE BUDGETED AT 3. THAT APPEARS TO BE A FAIRLY REASONABLE ESTIMATE.
AGAIN, THAT'S LESS THAN WHAT WE ANNUALLY COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE
PANDEMIC.
PARKING FUND REVENUES, AGAIN, THEY ARE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. FROM
WHAT WE BUDGETED IN THE PAST. AND WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE
REVENUE WILL COME BACK AS BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES RETURN
TO WORK. AGAIN, IT WILL BE A SLOW TRANSITION AS WELL AS WATER AND
SEWER REVENUES THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED AS PART OF THE WATER AND
SEWER RATE THAT YOU VOTED IN THE SPRING. AGAIN, INTEREST EARNINGS IS
ANOTHER AREA WE SEE CONTINUED REDUCTION BASED UPON THE LOW
INTEREST RATES. AGAIN, WE HAVE USED FREE CASH AS A STRATEGIC BRIDGE.
WE TYPICALLY USE $9 MILLION ANNUALLY. AGAIN, WE ARE USING ANOTHER
11 THIS YEAR TO OFFSET THE REVENUES THAT WE CANNOT INCREASE THAT
WE'D LIKE TO INCREASE, BUT TO BASICALLY BE IN A POSITION TO USE THAT AS
IF YOU WOULD A REVENUE SOURCE TO BASICALLY REPLENISH WHAT
REPLACE WHAT WE DON'T THINK WE'LL GET IN ANOTHER NONPROPERTY TAX
REVENUE. I'D SAY, I THINK THE $20 MILLION WE RECOMMEND FOR FREE
CASH, I THINK IT REFLECTS A SENSITIVITY TO RESIDENTIAL HOME OWNERS
AND SMALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS. YOU RECALL LAST YEAR
WHEN WE WERE SITTING HERE, COVID HIT IN MARCH OF 20. THE VALUES
WERE 1120, THE IMPACT ON BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY
OWNER WASN'T REFLECTED IN THE VALUES. ASSESSING OFFICE HAS GONE
BACK BECAUSE THE VALUES TONIGHT ARE AS OF 1/1/21. AND TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT WHAT THE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN ON COVID. AND SO, I THINK THAT
ALLOWS US, WITH THE $20 MILLION, TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND TO BE
REALIST, AND SENSITIVE ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SOME OF THE
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.
AS I MENTIONED, WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF
FREE CASH IN THE FUTURE. TAX RATE HEARINGS, AS NONPROPERTY TAX
REVENUES IN THE AREAS I MENTIONED COME BACK. WITH THE
RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU, 58.2% OF THE RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS
WILL SEE A REDUCTION, NO INCREASE OR INCREASE OF LESS THAN $100 IN
THE TAX BILL. AND THAT INCREASE IS 75% OF TAXPAYER INCREASE OR
REDUCTION INCREASE OF $250. THE PROPERTY TAX LEVEE INCREASE TO
SUPPORT THE BUDGET IS 4.7%. IT IS LOWER THAN WHAT WE ESTIMATED
WHEN WE WERE IN THE SPRING AT 8.95%. AND TYPICALLY BEEN OUR


PAGE 19

Jun 1, 2020

PRACTICE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
WITH THIS, WITH THIS THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE ANNUAL INCREASE OF THE
LEVEE IS 5.84%. AND THE TEN YEAR AVERAGE IS 5.17%. AND OUR ASSESSED
VALUES IS $64 MILLION. IT IS A 3.7 MILLION INCREASE OR 6.2%.
I THINK THE MANAGER MENTIONED THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO,
IN THIS BUDGET, INCREASE OUR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
AND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, SINCE 93.5 MILLION TOWARDS
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 5.85 FROM BUILDING PERMIT, 10 MILLION FROM
PROPERTY TAX, ADDITIONAL 2.5 THAT HAS BEEN ADDED IN THE FY22 BUDGET,
WHICH WILL BE FUNDED FROM FREE CASH. AND 14 MILLION DOLLARS YOU
VOTED FOR THE CPA A FEW WEEKS BACK. AGAIN, I THINK WE ARE OVER $32
MILLION IN ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, I THINK THE MANAGER MENTIONED OUR BUDGET
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WITH THE
CITY COUNCIL ACTION LAST YEAR, THE CITY WILL ALSO BE INCREASING THE
SMALL BUSINESS TAX EXEMPTION FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY ACCOUNTS FOR
FY22, CAMBRIDGE HOME RULE PETITION PASSED AND ADOPTED, ALLOW
FOR $20,000 EXEMPTION, IT WILL AFFECT OVER 1,500 SMALL BUSINESSES.
THEY WON'T RECEIVE A BILL.
AND AGAIN, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE FOR THIS YEAR, THE
LICENSING FEES BY 40%. AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. AND I WOULD
POINT OUT THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR DEBT SCHEDULE AND
THAT'S STILL IN TACT. WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE FUNDED THROUGH OUR NORMAL
COURSE.
AND THIS IS THE 17TH YEAR IN A ROW THAT THE TAXPAYERS WILL SEE A
MAJORITY OF THE TAXPAYERS WILL SEE A REDUCTION, NO CHANGE, OR
INCREASE LESS THAN $100. THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE
DONE. THE TEN YEAR AVERAGE IS 69.3. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS PAY 65% OF WHAT WE RAISE IN TAXES.
RESIDENTIAL DOES 35%.
I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT AS THE MANAGER MENTIONED, BECAUSE OF
THE MARKETPLACE SINGLE FAMILY VALUES HAVE INCREASED BY 6.4%. TWO
FAMILY BY 3.7. AGAIN, I THINK WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION, WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THE INCREASES IN FOLK'S TAX BILL. I WILL POINT TO
YOU THAT IF YOU GO TO CHART... ON PAGE 8, THE TAX BILLS FOR SINGLE
FAMILY WILL BE INCREASING BY OVER 9%. AND TWO AND THREE IS CLOSE TO
OVER 5%, EVEN WITH THE USE OF THIS $20 MILLION IN FREE CASH.
THAT IS OUR REPORT. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. I
KNOW GAIL, SO I CANNOT FORGET, GAIL OUR DIRECTOR OF ASSESSMENT IS
HERE, ANDREW IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ASSESSING, MICHELLE IS
ASSISTANT FINANCE DIRECTOR, TAHA, BUDGET DIRECTOR, AND ANGELA,
BUDGET DIRECTOR AND DANIEL FROM THE BUDGET OFFICE. WE'LL BE HAPPY
TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS,
YOU PULLED THIS. WE'LL GO TO YOU?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AS YOU HAVE HEARD, WE HAD THE
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR CITY MANAGER THAT THE COUNCIL WILL
TAKE RELATED TO THE TAX RATE THAT CAN HELP MINIMIZE TAXES ON THE
RESIDENTS. MOST PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW, THIS IS THE FINAL STEP IN THE
FISCAL PROCESS FOR 2022, THAT BEGAN WITH THE ANNUAL BUDGET LAST
SPRING. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE AND WE HAVE HEARD IT IN
PUBLIC COMMENT, WE ARE STILL BEGINNING TO EMERGE OUT OF THE
WORST OF THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC, WE ARE STILL GOING TO BE FACED
WITH A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES, PARTICULARLY FOR THE
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.
THAT COUPLED WITH THE UNCERTAINTY THAT COMES FROM THE IMPACT,
THAT WILL IMPACT THE CITY FINANCES, DESPITE THIS, WITH THE APPROVAL
OF THE RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT, THE CITY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A
MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS WITH A REDUCTION, NO INCREASE, OR
INCREASE OF LESS THAN $100 ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL. THE
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TAX RATE IS REDUCED FROM LAST YEAR. THERE'S
AN INCREASE IN THE RESIDENTIAL EXEMPTION, WHICH I'M PLEASED TO SEE.
AND THE PROPERTY TAX LEVEE WILL INCREASE BY 4.7% FROM LAST YEAR. IT
IS LOWER THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED WITH THE ADOPTED BUDGET LAST
SPRING.
THE FISCAL 22 BUDGET INCLUDES NO STAFF LAYOFFS, FURLOUGHS OR
REDUCTION IN SERVICES. THE COUNCIL WILL VOTE FOR RECOMMENDATION
TO INCREASE EXEMPTIONS FOR ELDERLY TAX PAPERS, BLIND TAXPAYERS,
VETERANS, AND SURVIVING SPOUSES THAT QUALIFY. WITH THESE
RECOMMENDATIONS, THE CITY WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND FUNDING IN
FISCAL 22 FOR IMPORTANT CITY COUNCIL PRIORITIES, SUCH AS AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, SCHOOLS, SUSTAINABILITY, VISION ZERO, SMALL BUSINESS
SUPPORT, AND AS WELL AS OUR EQUITY INCLUSION AND ACCESS PROGRAMS
AND PROJECTS THAT I KNOW THIS COUNCIL HAS BEEN VERY, VERY STRONG
ON AND WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEM COME TO FRUITION
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS.
THE FISCAL 22 BUDGET INCLUDES OVER $35 MILLION IN FUNDING TO THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST. INCREASE OFF MORE THAN $5 MILLION FROM
FISCAL 2021. AND THIS HAS AN INCREASE OF OVER $18 MILLION FROM
FISCAL 19 WHEN WE STATED THE INTENTION WAS TO DOUBLE IT WITHIN 3 5
YEARS. AND THE FISCAL 22 BUDGET INCREASES PROPERTY TAX TO THE
SCHOOLS FOR OVER $10 MILLION. AND IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT
THE BALANCE OF COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAXES TO REMAIN AFFORDABLE. AS WE HAVE DONE
IN THE PAST, THE CITY WILL CONTINUE TO HOST TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE
MEETINGS, WHICH WE VIRTUAL ZOOM DROP IN SESSIONS THIS YEAR. I WILL
SAY AND IT WILL BE ON THE WEBSITE, IT IS NOVEMBER 3 AND 4, FROM 10 12.
NOVEMBER 9 AND 17, FROM 2 4. AND NOVEMBER 15, 11:30 1:00. I WILL
YIELD SO THE COUNCIL CAN DISCUSS AND ASK QUESTIONS. AS I DO YIELD, I


PAGE 21

Jun 1, 2020

WILL GO TO MY CO CHAIR OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF HE WANTS
TO OFFER REMARKS BEFORE WE OPEN THE FLOOR FOR DISCUSSION. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN I SEE
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND THEN WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT. I
RECOGNIZE, WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT COVID HAS HAD A DRAMATIC IMPACT
AND THAT THE CITY HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF TRYING TO
STRENGTHEN BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. AND YOU SHOULD BE
APPLAUDED FOR THAT. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT. AS I
READ THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS HANDED OUT, WHICH WAS AMAZINGLY IN
DETAIL, AGAIN, I THANK YOU FOR THAT. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
QUESTIONS. I WON'T GO OVER ALL OF THEM NOW. JUST FOR
CLARIFICATION, WHEN WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO PUT $20 MILLION FROM
FREE CASH TO REDUCE TAXES, WE ALSO SHOULD SAY, THAT REDUCES TAXES
AT $12 A MONTH ON THE AVERAGE HOUSE. OR $150 A YEAR. I REALIZE THE
MANAGER AND HIS TEAM DEEM THAT VERY IMPORTANT, BUT $20 MILLION
COULD GO TO LAND ACQUISITION, IT COULD GO TO PRE K EXPANSION. WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE BUILDING A PUBLIC PRE SCHOOL SOMEWHERE IN LIEU OF IT
NOT BEING AT TOBIN.
IT COULD GO INTO ENVIRONMENTAL, FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IT CAN
GO INTO ROADS WHERE WE PUT VERY LITTLE MONEY INTO MAKING ROADS
SAFER AND SLOWER TO MEET OUR SPEED LIMIT. IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS NOT THE
APPROPRIATE TIME TO ASK A NUMBER OF THE QUESTION S I WANT TO
MENTION 28% OF THE BUDGET OF THE TAX LEVEE LIMIT IS UNUSED.
BOSTON, BROOKLINE, SOMERVILLE, IT IS ABOUT POINT ONE OR POINT 2%.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE INCREASE TAXES DRAMATICALLY, BUT THERE ARE
OTHER USES. IT GETS ME TO THE BIG QUESTION. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
OUR FIVE WE THE COUNCIL, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FIVE YEAR, TEN
YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IS. TO ME, THAT INCLUDES SCHOOLS,
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, ROAD WORK, AND PARKS.
SO, WE ARE DOING THIS IN THE DARK IN A CERTAIN WAY. I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT THE MANAGER AND HIS TEAM ARE LOOKING AT THAT, BUT WE DON'T
HAVE THAT INFORMATION. THERE ARE OTHER POINTS, WHAT ARE THE FIVE
CLASSES I ASSUME IT IS RESIDENTIAL MENTIONED ON PAGE 12. HOW MANY
DEBT SERVICE WILL THERE BE REMAINING AFTER THE VOTE. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE WHAT WE PAY FOR CONSTRUCTION AT CITY HALL. THAT'S
GREAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THE SCOPE OF THAT.
MAYBE IT IS AN ADDITIONAL DOCUMENT THAT EXPLAINS WHAT EVERYTHING
IS IN THE FUTURE, BUT I DO THINK IT IS NECESSARY. AT THE SAME TIME, I
INTEND TO VOTE FOR YES ON THIS TONIGHT. I KNOW WE'RE AT A DEADLINE.
I SURE HOPE IT IS DIFFERENT NEXT TIME OR I WON'T BE IN THAT POSITION.
SO, I WANT TO BE OPTIMISTIC, BUT WE NEED MORE INFORMATION AND TO
UNDERSTAND WHY SAVING $12 A MONTH ON THE AVERAGE DWELLING IS
WORTH NOT HAVING AN ADDITIONAL $20 MILLION FOR THE USES WE NEED.

THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR, I'M DONE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I GUESS I CAN RESPOND, IF THAT IS OKAY? CHAIR
CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: PLEASE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION, PREDICTABLE TAX BILL
THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER, WHAT PEOPLE FACE UNDER THE COVID
GUIDELINES, IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN. WE ARE
LOOKING AT A $500 MEDIAN INCREASE FOR RESIDENTIAL FAMILIES, I THINK
THAT'S MORE THAN THE PAST AND WE FELT IT WAS THE APPROPRIATE
NUMBER. I RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN FINANCE
DIRECTOR AND I HAVE BEEN CITY MANAGER, FOR 20 YEARS, I HAVE MADE THE
FINANCES OF THE CITY A PRIORITY AND NOT ONCE, IN 20 YEARS, HAVE WE
NOT RESPONDED THAT ANY COUNCIL REQUEST BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF
FUNDING. I WILL MAKE CLEAR, THIS IS MY LAST TAX RECOMMENDATION AND
I HAVE LEFT THE CITY WITH MORE MONEY IN FREE CASH THAN YOU CAN
IMAGINE, THE HIGHEST STABILIZATION, THIS CITY IS BEING LEFT IN AN
INCREDIBLY STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, IS
THIS $20 MILLION ARTIFICIALLY IMPACTING ANY IMPACT OF FUTURE NEEDS
OF THE CITY. I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THE REPUTATION, HOW I BALANCE
FINANCES. I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONING, I WANT TO ASSURE THE
COUNCIL AND THE PUBLIC, THIS BUDGET IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM,
ARTIFICIALLY LOWERING TAXES THAT WILL AFFECT ANY CAPITAL PROJECT IN
THE FUTURE THAT I CAN SEE. I THINK THE $60 MILLION THAT WE USED THIS
YEAR AS ITEMS CAME UP, IT REPRESENTS THAT. I'M CONFIDENT IN WHAT WE
LEFT IN DEBT STABILIZATION AND WHAT WE LEFT IN FREE CASH. I WILL NOT
CAUSE ANY NEW CITY MANAGER NOT TO DO SOMETHING. IT WILL BE THEIR
DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEEL IT IS APPROPRIATE. IT WILL NOT BE
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDS. I REALLY THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO
BRING HOME. WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A POLICY THAT PEOPLE AGREE OR
DISAGREE, THAT'S A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT. 20 YEARS AGO WHEN WE
STARTED, WE SAID ONCE YOU PUT FREE CASH IN, IT IS DIFFICULT TO TAKE IT
OUT BECAUSE IT WILL CAUSE A MAJOR INCREASE. OVER THE LAST TWO
YEARS, I ADMIT, WE HAD ADDITIONAL FREE CASH BECAUSE OF COVID. THAT
IS NOT OUR INTENT. I BELIEVE THAT IN FY23, THE NEW MANAGER WILL BE
ABLE TO REPLACE THAT AFTER LONG DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. KALE AND TAHA
JENNINGS. I'M PROUD OF THIS RECOMMENDATION AND I THINK IT WILL DO
THE TAXPAYERS WELL. I THINK IT WILL KEEP THE CITY IN A STRONG FINANCIAL
POSITION AND THIS WAS ALL PLANNED AND EXPENDITURES AS WE PRETTY
MUCH WENT TO THE RATING AGENCY AND DISCUSSED WHAT WE'LL USE FOR
DEBT STABILIZATION AND THE BONDING. I THINK WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR
PLAN. WE HAVE A CAPITAL BUDGET. THE BONDING SCHEDULE IS
SOMETHING WE REALLY HAVE NOT GONE OVER IN THE FUTURE AND WE'LL BE
HAPPY IF SOMETHING CAN BE SQUEEZED IN TO ADDRESS THAT. WE HAVE A
SCHOOL BUDGET INFRASTRUCTURE MEETING COMING UP WITH THE TWO
FINANCE CHAIRS. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. I
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONS. I THINK THEY ARE APPROPRIATE, BUT I


PAGE 23

Jun 1, 2020

REALLY THINK AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. THANK
YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WILL BE VERY QUICK. I'M NOT ATTACKING
ANYONE IN THE CHAMBER ON THIS. I'M REALLY JUST ASKING QUESTIONS.
AND EVERY YEAR I HAVE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL, WE HAVE PUT $20 MILLION
BACK IN TO REDUCE TAXES. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN. I SAID THAT
COVID CHANGED THAT THIS YEAR, BUT I'M NOT ATTACKING WHAT YOU HAVE
DONE. AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT. I'M JUST ASKING BASIC
QUESTIONS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR THE CITY'S
INFRASTRUCTURE, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT. I WANT A TEN YEAR PLAN OF
HOW WE'LL BUILD UNIVERSAL PRE K. OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE
TALKED ABOUT FROM MY EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S ALL I'M RAISING. AND YOU
HAVE SAID THERE'S ENOUGH. I BELIEVE YOU. I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. AND
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. TRUST YES, ABSOLUTELY. WE ARE BEYOND TRUST.
THIS IS A COUNCIL/MANAGER RELATIONSHIP. I'M NOT I'M TRYING NOT TO
BE CRITICAL. I'M JUST STATING ISSUES. THEY NEED TO BE DISCUSSED
BECAUSE COVID WAS DIFFERENT. IT IS THE SAME ALL ALONG. WE'RE IN
GREAT SHAPE. WE HAVE MONEY IN OUR POCKETS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO
USE IT. THAT'S ALL I'M GETTING AT. WHERE ARE WE PUTTING THAT MONEY
IN THE FUTURE. WE HAVE NEEDS, AS I SAID, INCLUDING OPEN SPACE AND
VERY UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS.
I'LL LEAVE IT LIKE THAT. I THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. AND AS I
WROTE DAVID KALE TODAY, I WILL VOTE FOR ALL THIS. I WANTED TO RAISE
THE ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. MANAGER.
>> CITY MANAGER: IF I CAME ACROSS TOO DEFENSIVE. I APOLOGIZE, WE
HAD THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE PAST AND I APPRECIATE THEM. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER. AND
THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. AND THEN I HAVE COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN. AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I HAD A COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS AND THEN THOUGHTS ON THIS. THE FIRST IS ON THE FREE CASH
ORDER. ACCORDING TO THE TAX RATE LETTER, WE HAVE 214.4 IN FREE CASH.
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW 22.5 MILLION IS ARRIVED ON THE FIGURE
TO REDUCE THE TAX LEVEE BY?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MR. KALE. WE USED $9 MILLION
BEFORE COVID AND HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THAT. LAST YEAR, WITH
THE LOSS OF THE COVID REVENUE, ONE WAY WE FELT TO CONTROL TAXES IS
TO TAKE FREE CASH. WE WENT TO THE RATING AGENCIES, WE FELT WE
WOULD USE THAT NUMBER FOR 1 2 YEARS. WE WANT TO USE A NUMBER
THAT IS REPLACEABLE. SO, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 19 22, WE FEEL THAT
FROM THE, $13 MILLION IS AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER. BY FY23, HOPEFULLY
WE ARE BACK IN A BETTER POSITION AND START TO REPLENISH THAT. IT IS A
COMBINATION OF WHAT WE'LL LOSE. WE LOST OVER $20 MILLION IN
REVENUE. HOW MUCH CAN WE GET BACK SO WE DON'T TAKE ARTIFICIALLY

PAGE 24

Jun 1, 2020

USE FREE CASH. AFTER A DISCUSSION, WE FELT IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE
NUMBER. DAVID CAN ADD MORE OF THE SPECIFICS.
>> MR. KALE: THROUGH YOU, MADAM MAYOR, TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER. THE BUDGET ITSELF HAD AN ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF FREE CASH
AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREASE IT SLIGHTLY. LOOKING AT SOME OF
OTHER REVENUE, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THOSE THAT OUTLINED
IN THE LETTER. I THINK THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OUR
FREE CASH POSITION STAYED STRONG AS THE MANAGER MENTIONED. WE
FUNDED A VARIETY OF PROJECTS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLENISH THAT
WITH OUR FREE CASH CERTIFICATION OF $214 MILLION. INCREASING WHAT
WE ANTICIPATED TO $20 MILLION BASED UPON WHAT THE POSITION WAS IN
TERMS OF THE NEW CERTIFICATION. AGAIN, LOOKING AT THE LIGHT AT THE
END OF THE TUNNEL, IS A ONE TIME ADDITIONAL AMOUNT THAT BASICALLY
WILL ALLOW US TIME TO GET NONPROPERTY TAX REVENUE BACK TO WHERE
THEY WERE. IT IS A COMBINATION OF WHAT WAS A CERTIFICATION
AMOUNT, WHAT WE HAD FOR OTHER NONPROPERTY TAX REVENUES
ACTUALS, AND IS IT AN AMOUNT THAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN REPLENISH SO
BASICALLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO USE FREE CASH TO FUND THE ITEMS THAT
THE MANAGER HAD JUST MENTIONED THAT WE DID LAST YEAR, TOTALLING
$75 MILLION IN FISCAL 21 AND ALMOST $100 MILLION IN THE PREVIOUS
FISCAL YEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THAT'S HELPFUL. WHAT I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND, WE TAKE THIS AMOUNT AND USE IT TO REDUCE THE TAX
RATE, WE TRY TO GET THE TAX RATE BELOW A CERTAIN NUMBER? LOOKING
AT FREE CASH AND SAYING, WE CAN TAKE 10% OF THIS EACH YEAR? TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND, WORKING BACK FROM A NUMBER ON THE TAX RATE OR
THE OVERALL FREE CASH AMOUNT AND SAYING, WE CAN TAKE X PERCENT? IS
IT A MIX OF THE TWO?
>> CITY MANAGER: LITTLE OF EVERYTHING. WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY, FOR 15
YEARS, TAKEN THE $9 MILLION. WE FELT IT WAS REPLENISHABLE. YOU DON'T
WANT TO TAKE MONEY YOU WON'T REPLENISH. WHEN COVID HIT AND WE
KNEW WE'D LOSE REVENUE, WE FELT THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THAT
WITHOUT HAVING A TAXPAYER BURDEN, USE THE FREE CASH NUMBER. LAST
YEAR WE USED A PORTION OF IT AND THIS YEAR WE INCREASED IT. WHEN
WE WENT TO THE RATING AGENCY, WE MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS NUMBERS WE
HAVE USED PRIMARILY BASED ON WHAT WE CAN REPLENISH AS WE MOVE
FORWARD AND GET INTO BETTER TIMES. THE ORIGINALLY NUMBER IS A
NUMBER WE USED THAT WE FELT COULD STABILIZE AND REPLENISH. THE
SECOND ONE IS THE NUMBER WE CAN REPLENISH DUE TO THE COVID 19
TURNAROUND. IT WILL AFFECT THE RESTAURANTS, HOTELS AND OTHERS. IT
IS A COMBINATION OF ALL THINGS TO COME UP WITH A NUMBER. THERE'S
NO MAGIC FORMULA. IT IS A DISCUSSION BACK AND FORTH AND TRYING TO
COME UP. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO DAVID.
>> MR. KALE: IT SUMMARIZES TO APPROPRIATELY. A COMBINATION OF
FACTORS TO SEE WHERE YOU CAN AFFORD AND HOW MUCH YOU LOOK TO
MAKE YOUR PROPERTY TAX, ESPECIALLY FOR THE RESIDENTIAL MODERATE, IT


PAGE 25

Jun 1, 2020

IS A MELDING OF THE TWO OR THREE ITEMS.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTION,
AS FOLKS SAID, WE SET A CERTAIN PROPERTY TAX RATE IN THE SPRING WHEN
WE PUT THE BUDGET TOGETHER. AND SO TO TAKE FREE CASH AND SEEK TO
REDUCE THAT, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PROPERTY OWNERS NOT BEING
ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY THEIR TAXES OTHERWISE. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND, DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT PERCENT OF PROPERTY
OWNERS REQUESTED ABATEMENTS OUT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FOLKS
PAYING PROPERTY TAXES?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL HAVE I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH ONE THING.
INCREASE FROM THE BUDGET FOR FREE CASH IS MINIMUM. INCREASE HAS
BEEN WHAT WE USED EVERY YEAR. WHEN THE BUDGET SUBMITTED, WE
DON'T HAVE ACTUALS, BECAUSE IT IS SUBMITTED IN APRIL. FOR 20 YEARS,
ONCE WE FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR ACTUAL NUMBER IS IN, COME SEPTEMBER,
WE USE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM REVENUE, NOT FREE CASH, TO LOWER
THE RATE. THIS IS NOT A LOWERING OF THE RATE FROM ALL FREE CASH. IT IS
PRIMARILY ADDITIONAL REVENUE BASED ON THE 630 ACTUALS 6/30
REVENUES. THANK YOU.
>> GAIL: THANK YOU. LAST YEAR, WE HAD 430 ABATEMENT APPLICATIONS.
PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY FILE ABOUT THE VALUE. WHAT THEY ARE FILING
ABOUT IS THE IMPACT. AND WHEN THE MANAGER TALKED ABOUT, YEARS
AGO WE DID HAVE A TAXPAYER REVOLT. THAT WAS ABOUT FILING ABOUT
THE IMPACT OF THE BILLS. NOT NECESSARILY THE VALUE. PEOPLE LOOK AT
WHAT DID I PAY LAST YEAR, WHAT WILL I PAY THIS YEAR, AND THAT'S WHERE
THE PINCH POINT IS.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THAT 430 APPLICATIONS. HOW MANY
TOTAL? FOLKS PAYING PROPERTY TAX? TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE
PERCENT?
>> TO DEFINE THAT, I THINK WHAT WE SAID BEFORE, IN LAST FISCAL YEAR'S
TAX RATE SETTING PROCESS, THE VALUES WERE AS OF 1/1/20, THAT IS
BEFORE COVID HIT. THIS VALUE AS OF 1/1/21, THAT REFLECTS, IN TERMS OF
SUM VALUES FOR SOME PROPERTIES, THE IMPACT OF COVID, ESPECIALLY FOR
THE SMALL BUSINESSES. SOME CASES, OUR RESIDENTIAL FOLKS WHO MAY
HAVE BEEN HURT BY NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO RENT OUT UNITS AND THE
LIKE. I THINK WE LOOK BACK, BUT I'D SAY THAT IT IS REALLY THE IMPACT OF
TRYING TO BALANCE A LOT OF THINGS, WHICH ARE VALUES AND TAX RATE SO
BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE A FLOOD OF ABATEMENTS WHEN WE SEND OUT
THE BILLS. GOING BACK LAST YEAR, IT WAS A TYPICAL YEAR BECAUSE
FRANKLY EVERYBODY KNEW AND IT DIDN'T REFLECT THE IMPACT OF COVID. I
SUGGEST IF WE WERE NOT SENSITIVE TO THE FACT OF THE IMPACTS TO
SOME OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS THIS YEAR, WE'D HAVE A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS FOR ABATEMENT FILED. I DON'T KNOW IF GAIL
OR THE MANAGER HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT?
>> GAIL: YES, I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IN LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS
FROM LAST YEAR, THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE AMOUNT OF OUTREACH


PAGE 26

Jun 1, 2020

THAT THE ASSESSING DEPARTMENT DID TO TALK TO TAXPAYERS THAT COVID
WAS NOT PART OF THE EQUATION FOR THE ASSESSMENTS. WE MET WITH
HOTEL OWNERS, WE MET WITH SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, WE DID AS
MUCH OUTREACH AS WE COULD TO BRING TO PEOPLE'S ATTENTION THAT WE
WERE NOT GOING TO TAKE COVID WE WERE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO
TAKE COVID INTO ACCOUNT WITH THE ASSESSMENTS. I THINK THAT'S THE
REFLECTION THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE ABATEMENT NUMBERS FROM LAST
YEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE ALL THE
WORK THAT GOES INTO THIS. SETTING THE TAX RATE AND THE BUDGET
OVERALL. I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR MOST ORDERS OVERALL. USING THE FREE
CASH AND THE OVERLAY SURPLUS TO REDUCE THE TAX RATE. HERE'S WHERE
WE DISAGREE AND THAT'S A POLICY DISAGREEMENT AND IT IS AN HONEST
ONE. I ASKED ABOUT THE RATE OF THE ABATEMENTS, WE KNOW 50% OR
MORE OF ALL RENTERS ARE COST BURDEN WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING.
THAT'S AN AREA THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE $22 MILLION AND THERE ARE
MANY OTHER PRIORITIES, DIGITAL EQUITY, AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS, THEY
COULD AS WELL. WITHOUT THIS, WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST PROPERTY
TAX RATES OF ANY CITY IN MASSACHUSETTS. AND JUST TRYING TO SEE
COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE IT FURTHER THAN THAT.
AND IF WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHICH WE ALL DO,
WE NEED TO SEE THAT NEED TO GIVE BACK $22 MILLION RATHER THAN
SPEND IT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE ARE TRYING TO HELP HOME
OWNERS THAT STRUGGLE WITH THE TAXES OR SMALL BUSINESSES OR
INCENTIVIZE PROPERTY OWNERS TO KEEP RENT LOW, THERE ARE BETTER
POLICY TOOLS TO DO THAT THAN REDUCING THE TAX RATE. BY DOING THIS,
WE ARE GIVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AWAY TO THE BIGGEST LAND
OWNERS, LIKE BLACKSTONE GROUP, WHO DON'T REALLY NEED THE HELP AND
OTHER PRIORITIES, LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I CAN'T SUPPORT THE
ORDER ON FREE CASH AND THE OVERLAY SURPLUS AND WILL VOTE NO. I
EXPECT THE VOTES WILL BE TO PASS THEM. I THINK THERE'S AN INTEREST TO
DIG INTO THIS AND UNDERSTAND ALL OPTIONS. I DID SUBMIT A LATE POLICY
ORDER ABOUT HOSTING A MEETING ON THE FISCAL BUDGET TO DIG INTO THE
CONSIDERATIONS A LITTLE BIT MORE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN,
AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. IT FEELS LIKE A DEJA VU, WE ARE
HERE EVERY YEAR HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION. I WANT TO COMMEND
YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE CITY FOR ALL THE
YEARS. AND RECOGNIZE THAT COVID HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT CRISIS,
OBVIOUSLY, FOR THE CITY. NONETHELESS, AS YOU SAY, WE ARE IN GOOD
FINANCIAL POSITION. I THINK WHAT YOU ARE HEARING FROM SOME OF US IS
THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE A MORE EQUITABLE POLICY IN TERMS OF HOW WE
TAX OUR RESIDENTS RATHER THAN THIS ACROSS THE BOARD LOWERING OF
TAXES, WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT HOME OWNERS WHOSE
PROPERTIES ARE VERY VALUABLE AND FOR THE MOST PART, WOULDN'T HAVE


PAGE 27

Jun 1, 2020

ANY PROBLEMS PAYING A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS EXTRA. IF THAT MEANT
FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR CITY.
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ALSO HOW THIS WORKS FUNDAMENTALLY. THE
FREE CASH IS JUST PROPERTY TAXES FROM PRIOR YEARS. I GUESS I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW WE TAKE $9 MILLION OUT OF FREE CASH, THEN SAY
WE'RE GOING TO REPLENISH IS, WHICH MEANS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND
THAT $9 MILLION IN THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET? I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND
HOW IT WORKS.
>> CITY MANAGER: IT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. SO, THE WAY FREE CASH
IS DEVELOPED, YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND SAY, AT THE END OF THE
YEAR, WHAT DIDN'T YOU SPEND. WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT WE ARE NEVER
100% OF STAFFING. OFTEN THE INSURANCE BUDGET IS INCREASED.
NORMALLY, IN A GOOD YEAR, WE CAN SAVE 5 10 MILLION IN THE BUDGET.
FROM SAVINGS. THAT WOULD REPLENISH THE $9 MILLION. YOU LOOK AT
REVENUES. WHAT REVENUES HAVE BEEN GREATER THAN WHAT YOU USED
WHEN YOU SET THE TAX RATE. WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE IN CAMBRIDGE
TO EXCEED OUR REVENUES EVERY YEAR FROM WHAT WE BUDGETED. AND
THAT'S ALLOWED. YOU TAKE THE TOTALLY REVENUE, TOTAL EXPENDITURES,
YOU BALANCE THEM TO WHAT THE BUDGET SAYS. AND THAT IS HOW YOU
DETERMINE HOW MUCH YOU REPLENISH. LIKE DAVID SAID, WE SPENT ABOUT
$50 60 MILLION IN FREE CASH APPROPRIATIONS OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WE
USED IN THE BUDGET. WE HAD INCREDIBLE STRONG YEARS, IT ALLOWED US
TO REPLENISH FREE CASH. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. KNOWING THAT THE WAY
BUDGETS WORK, ESPECIALLY IN OUR FORM, WE KNOW WE'LL REPLENISH A
CERTAIN PART BASED ON WHAT WE LEAVE IN THE BUDGET. WE MONITOR
THE BUDGET, ON COVID ESPECIALLY, MONITOR CLOSE AND WE DIDN'T FILL
POSITIONS FOR A WHILE. AND WE WATCHED OVERTIME INCREDIBLY CLOSELY
AND MONITOR REVENUES, THAT'S WITH THE REDUCTIONS WE GAVE TO
LICENSES, TO VARIOUS RESTAURANTS AND BUSINESSES, WE FELT WE NEEDED
TO DO THAT. IT IS REALLY JUST MAKING SURE FREE CASH IS NOT A WAY TO
LOWER YOUR TAX RATE. IF IS A ONE TIME DEAL, IT DOESN'T WORK. IT HAS
TO BE A WAY TO BE REPLENISHABLE, IT IS AN ONGOING SITUATION. THAT'S
HOW WE HAVE DONE IT. IF IT WASN'T A COVID SITUATION, WE'D STAY AT $9
MILLION BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE LOST THE REVENUE. IT IS A
STRATEGY DECISION. I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS AN AREA WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON. I CAN RESPECT THAT. AS SOMEONE
WHO HAS MET A LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE CITY THAT OWN SINGLE
FAMILIES, MAYBE PROPERTY RICH, BUT NO INTENTION IN LEAVING THE CITY
AND THE INCOME DOESN'T MATCH THE WAY THE ASSESSMENT GOES UP. IF
WE TAKE THAT AND INCREASE THEIR TAXES, BASED ON VALUE AND BASED ON
NOT USING FREE CASH, A LOT OF THEM HAVE TOLD ME THEY WOULD HAVE
TO SELL. THEY DON'T WANT TO, THEY LOVE LIVING IN THE CITY. I DO BELIEVE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF TAXPAYERS WHO BASE THEIR RENTS ON WHAT THEIR
TAX BILLS ARE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS, I THINK THIS IS
A WAY TO PROTECT THE SENIORS, PEOPLE WHO HAVE OWNED PROPERTY FOR
A LONG TIME. ALSO PEOPLE WHO ARE RENTING, HOPEFULLY PEOPLE THAT
OWN TWO AND THREE FAMILIES, CONTROLLING BILLS AND RENT. AND WE


PAGE 28

Jun 1, 2020

BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE. YOU NEVER KNOW. AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK.
THAT'S ONE REASON THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTROL BILLS.
PREDICTABILITY IS SOMETHING WE TAKE IN GREAT PRIDE OF AND LIKE I SAID,
THE DIFFICULTY IS ONCE YOU USE THIS SYSTEM, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO STEP
BACK BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE A MAJOR INCREASE ON TAX BILLS THE YEAR
YOU ADJUST IT. IF THAT IS THE DECISION THE COUNCIL WANTS TO DO, THAT
WILL BE THE OUTCOME. THAT WILL BE THE COUNCIL'S DECISION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING
THAT. AND THAT DEFINITELY HELPS. AGAIN, I THINK WE ALL AGREE, WE
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE
FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE. AND I GUESS WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS ARE THERE
NOT OTHER POLICY TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE WHILE STILL
COLLECTING ENOUGH REVENUE SO WE CAN INCREASE SPENDING ON THE
PRIORITIES. THAT ALSO PROTECTS PEOPLE WHO ARE EVEN MORE
FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE, AS WE ALL KNOW, WITH COVID, WE SPEND EXTRA
MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE PAY THE RENT. GET FOOD. AND BASIC NEEDS LIKE
THAT. AND IN MY MIND, THAT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING
SINGLE FAMILY HOME OWNERS FROM SEEING A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
DOLLARS INCREASE IN THEIR TAXES.
WE'RE CERTAINLY I'M SENSITIVE TO THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T WANT TO
PUSH OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE RICH AND CASH POOR AND ALL OF THAT.
WE DO HAVE AN ABATEMENT PROCESS, ARE THERE NOT OTHER POLICY
TOOLS WE CAN USE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PROTECT THOSE
INDIVIDUALS WHILE ALLOWING PROPERTY TAXES TO RISE SLIGHTLY SO THAT
WE CAN DO MORE TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE?
>> I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. ABATEMENTS ARE NOT ABOUT INABILITY TO
PAY. THEY ARE ABOUT THE VALUE BEING TOO HIGH COMPARED TO EITHER
SALES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR OTHER ASSESSMENTS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR SIMILAR PROPERTIES. IT IS NOT AT ALL ABOUT ABILITY
TO PAY.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WOULD ADD, I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION. I DO
THINK ONE THING THAT WE I HAVE TO KEEP ON BRINGING HOME, WE HAVE
NOT NOT BEEN ABLE TO FUND ANY PRIORITY THAT I'M AWARE OF. FRESH
POND APARTMENTS CAME UP, WE CAME UP WITH $15 MILLION. OPEN
SPACE PIECE OF PROPERTY CAME UP BECAUSE THE COUNCIL LOOKS FOR
OPEN SPACE, FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, WE FOUND IT. WE CAME UP WITH $18
MILLION. WHEN WE WANTED TO ADDRESS OUR UNHOUSED, WE CAME UP
WITH $9 MILLION. WHEN THE SCHOOL WAS HURTING, WE CAME UP WITH $9
MILLION. WE GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS HERE. WE CAN CONTROL OUR
TAXES, BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF ADDRESSING CITY NEEDS, ESPECIALLY IN
IMPORTANT ONES LIKE HOUSING AND CONCERNS AROUND COVID. IT IS A
BALANCE. I THINK IF WE WERE NOT COMING UP WITH THE FREE CASH TO
ADDRESS THE ISSUES, I CAN UNDERSTAND IT BETTER. I THINK WE ARE


PAGE 29

Jun 1, 2020

GETTING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. LIKE I SAID, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOUT 137%. I'M PROUD OF THE FACT
THAT I'M THE FIRST CITY MANAGER TO PUT PROPERTY TAXES INTO
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE HAVE DONE IT FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT
YEAR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. TO SOME
EXTENT, YOU HAVE SPOILED US AND WE JUST WANT MORE. LIKE MY
PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE WHO SPOKE, I WILL BE VOTING YES ON USING THE
FREE CASH VOTING NO ON FREE CASH AND WILL SUPPORT THE OTHER
ORDERS. NOT MEANT AS CRITICISM OR REBUKE, WE FEEL WE SHOULD SPEND
MORE MONEY ON THE OTHER PRIORITIES AND ALLOW PROPERTY TAXES TO
GO UP SLIGHTLY TO FUND THAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE
PRESENTATION, MR. MANAGER. AS YOUR LAST GO AT THIS. THANK YOU
ALSO FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE. I DO THINK MAYBE WE HAVE NOT
ALWAYS AGREE, I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL ALWAYS AGREE WITH EACH
OTHER. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE HERE.
I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE ACROSS THE AISLE HERE, COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN, I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE SPOILED IN SOME REGARD. YOU HAVE
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY, CERTAINLY AROUND THE STATE,
CLOSING SCHOOLS, CLOSING FIRE STATIONS, CAN'T DO THE INFRASTRUCTURE
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. THEY ARE NOT BUILDING THREE SCHOOLS AT
HALF A BILLION WITH NO TAX INCREASES OR NO STATE MONEY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS. YET, WE KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE IN
THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN
AND SHOULD DO BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE POSITION TO DO THAT. IT IS
NEVER AS GOOD AS IT IS. IT IS NOT PERFECT AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WE
HAVE TO BE DOING. I DO AGREE ALSO THAT I THINK YOU SEE THIS OFTEN
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BUDGETS AND WHATNOT. PEOPLE SAY, IF WE DON'T
SPEND IT HERE, THAT MEANS WE LOSE IT HERE. I'M NOT SURE THERE'S THAT
CORRELATION. WHAT IS IN FRONT OF ME NOW, WE CAN SPEND $22 MILLION
ON LOWER FOLKS' TAX BILL BY $200 OR TAKE THAT $22 MILLION AND PUT
INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT COULD BE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WHERE THE MONEY IS SPENT. ON THE
HOUSING ISSUE, WORKED AS HARD AS ANYBODY ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING
ISSUES. WE HAVE INCREASED THE TRUST BY $137%. MONEY IN THE BANK
ACCOUNT ONLY GOES SO FAR AND APPROVE PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD
AND SPEND IT. WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT, IT DOESN'T
MEAN WE'LL GET THE HOUSING SADLY.
SO, I DO SHARE THE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN STOLE MY LINE, DEJA VU ALL
OVER AGAIN, I HATE TO QUOTE A YANKEE, WE DO GET HERE EVERY YEAR. WE
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. IT IS TOO LATE. TOO LONG A CONVERSATION TO
HAVE. TOO DETAILED A CONVERSATION. AND WE KICK THE CAN TO THE
NEXT YEAR. I DO APPRECIATE THAT A LATE ORDER IS COMING IN FROM

PAGE 30

Jun 1, 2020

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER ABOUT REALLY TRYING TO HAVE SOME OF
THE DISCUSSIONS EARLIER. WHOEVER IS HERE ON THE COUNCIL NEXT TERM.
I WONDER IF THAT SHOULD BE A FINANCE MEETING RATHER THAN HOUSING.
WE CAN DEBATE THAT WHEN IT COMES UP.
I DO HOPE WHEN THIS ISSUE COMES UP AGAIN NEXT YEAR, WE HAVE WE
HAD CONVERSATIONS AHEAD OF TIME. WE HAD THAT DEBATE AHEAD OF
TIME SO WE'RE NOT IN THIS POSITION AGAIN. I DO AGREE WITH I DON'T
KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT. I UNDERSTAND I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT TO... I'M FINE WITH GIVING TAX RELIEF TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE
HOUSE RICH AND CASH POOR. WE HEAR THAT A LOT. WE GIVE THAT MUCH
LARGER TAX BREAK TO MIT AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE LOTS AND LOTS
OF MONEY, I GET A LITTLE LESS COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I DON'T KNOW, IT
GOES TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S QUESTION, THIS IS SOMETHING WE'LL
HAVE TO DISCUSS, ARE THERE THINGS WE CAN DO? IS THE RESIDENTIAL
EXEMPTION HOW CAN WE DO IT? I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN MY EYES BETWEEN GIVING NOT INCREASING
TAXES ON FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT MORE VERSUS SOME OF
THE LARGER REAL ESTATE OWNERS THAT ARE ALSO GETTING THIS BENEFIT. IF
WE CAN KIND OF TRY TO CRACK THAT ISSUE A LITTLE BIT AND SEE IF THERE'S
A WAY WE CAN DO THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY MOVING FORWARD, I
THINK IT IS A WORTHWHILE CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. I WILL VOLT FOR THIS TONIGHT VOTE
FOR THIS TONIGHT. I DO HOPE THAT THE NEXT COUNCIL REALLY DOES DO
THE WORK TO TALK ABOUT THIS. EVERY YEAR WE SAY THE SAME THING. WE
NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE FUTURE AND WE DON'T. WE REALLY WE
REALLY NEED TO DIG IN AND DO THAT. SEE IF THERE ISN'T A WAY WE CAN'T
FIGURE THIS OUT BETTER SO WE'RE NOT IN THIS POSITION NEXT YEAR.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MY COLLEAGUES WHO
SPOKE BEFORE ME AND THE STAFF. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
RELATED TO THIS. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY SMALL LANDLORDS ARE
INCLUDED IN THE PARCELS? INCLUDING NATURALLY OCCURRING
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT IS EASY TO TALK ABOUT BIG LANDLORDS. MAYBE
I'M SENSITIVE. I OWN A TWO FAMILY, MY TAXES WENT UP $600 LAST YEAR.
HI TO GO TO THE TENANT TO SEE IF THEY COULD AFFORD A $25 INCREASE.
THERE ARE LANDLORDS THAT ARE BIG. THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO OWN
TWO AND THREE FAMILIES. MAYBE RENT OUT THEIR SINGLE FAMILY. DO WE
HAVE AN EXTENT OF THAT WITHIN THE CITY? I THINK IT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS TO THINK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT AS
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN WAS SAYING, THERE'S A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE
IN THE CITY, FOR WHOM THE CITY MANAGER AND OTHERS INDICATED, A FEW
HUNDRED DOLLARS IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY PAY THE
TAXES. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR SINGLE AND TWO
FAMILY OWNERS AND THREE FAMILY, ALL WHO PAYING ON AVERAGE


PAGE 31

Jun 1, 2020

BETWEEN 5 10% MORE THIS YEAR AND THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AS WELL.
>> I WANT TO CLARIFY? YOU LOOK FOR A COUNT OF OWNER OCCUPIED?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: HOW MANY SMALL LANDLORDS INVOLVED. MAYBE
CONDOS, SMALL LANDLORDS, MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER. I
REALIZED I DIDN'T SEND IT IN ADVANCE. I WONDER IF WE HAVE A SENSE OF
THE UNIVERSE OF THAT, HOW MANY OF THE PARCELS AND THE UNITS ARE
COVERED BY SMALL LANDLORDS OPPOSED TO LARGE ONES?
>> GAIL: ARE YOU QUALIFYING SMALL LANDLORD BY COUNT OF UNITS?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> GAIL: FOR TWO FAMILY, PARCEL COUNT IS 2332. FOR THREE FAMILY,
PARCEL COUNT IS 1185. AND I KNOW BASED ON SOME OF THE WORK WE DID
FOR THE CONDO HEARING WE HAD ABOUT 60% OF THE TWO FAMILY ARE
OWNER OCCUPIED AND 50% OF THE THREE FAMILY ARE OWNER OCCUPIED.
AND THEN FOR SOME OF THE APARTMENT, NOT REALLY BROKEN OUT IN THE
WAY YOU LOOK FOR, 843 PARCELS ARE FOR THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. IF
YOU WANT IT BROKEN OUT INTO SMALLER STRATIFICATION, WE CAN DO
THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OF THE WE HEARD ABOUT SOME RESIDENTIAL
PARCELS MAY BE OWNED BY LLCs. THEY COULD BE A FAMILY TRUST OR A
FAMILY WHO HAS DONE PLANNING. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY
ARE FOREIGN OWNED OR INVESTORS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO CAMBRIDGE?
>> NO. AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED QUESTION. WE DO HAVE SOME
HOME OWNERS WHO LIVE IN THE HOUSE AND DO PUT IT IN LLC. THAT'S PART
OF A FINANCIAL STRUCTURE THEY HAVE CHOSEN. THE REASON THAT YOU
TYPICALLY PUT IT IN AN LLC IS FOR YOUR PROTECTION AGAINST BEING SUED.
AND ALSO TO PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY. I CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD FROM
SOME HOME OWNERS WHO MAY BE IT WAS STALKING OR THINGS LIKE THAT.
THEY PUT THEIR HOUSE INTO AN LLC SO THEY CAN'T BE FOUND.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. AND WHERE DOES CHA OR OTHER
OWNED PARCELS? DO THEY APPEAR IN THIS OR INCLUDED IN THE
RESIDENTIAL ASSESSMENT AND IN THE PARCEL COUNTS?
>> GAIL: THEY ARE INCLUDED IN WHAT WE SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
REVENUE. THEY DO NOT PAY TAXES ON THEIR PARCELS. THEY INSTEAD PAY A
PILOT ON THE PARCELS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THEY WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED IN THE RESIDENTIAL
ASSESSMENTS BY VALUE. THE SUMMARIES YOU GAVE US OR THE COUNT?
>> GAIL: NO. THE SUMMARIES ARE... THEY ARE ALL RESIDENTIAL USE. AND
SO THE CHA PARCELS ARE UNDER EXEMPT USE AND NOT SOMETHING WE
TRACK.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IT IS EXEMPT RESIDENTIAL. I WANT TO CLARIFY.
SORRY IF I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT. I AM HAPPY TO
VOTE FOR ALL OF THIS. I WANT TO SAY THAT, AS I GO AROUND THE CITY AND


PAGE 32

Jun 1, 2020

TALK TO MY NEIGHBORS, THERE HAS I'M VERY GLAD AND VERY
APPRECIATIVE THAT WE ARE USING THIS RELATIVELY SMALL, BUT VERY
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FREE CASH TO KEEP THE TAX RATE STABLE. AS THE
VALUES GO UP, EVEN IF THE TAX RATE STAYS LOW, FOR MANY PEOPLE IT IS
STILL SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AND WHILE WE RENTERS
WAS RAISED. IT IS HOME OWNERS WHO OWN SOMETHING AND RENT OUT.
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION. THEIR RATE GOES UP AND THEIR
PROPERTY TAX GOES UP. THEIR RENTS WILL GO UP IF THERE IS NOT THIS
ABATEMENT. IT IS NOT JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL HOME OWNER, BUT SOME
FLOW TO RENTERS WHO WON'T HAVE TO GET THE RENT INCREASE BECAUSE
THE HOME OWNER WON'T HAVE TO INCREASE THEIR RENT TO COVER IT. I'M
HAPPY TO SEE THAT.
ALSO, I'M VERY COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOUBLING, AS
IT WAS SAID, UP TO HOW MANY YEARS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE ABLE
TO SPENT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY CAN
BE PROUD OF. IT IS $30 MILLION DIRECTLY. THERE'S ANOTHER 10 20
MILLION IN SERVICES FOR FOLKS IN THE HOUSING AREA IS SOMETHING THAT
THE CITY HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO AND CONTINUE TO FUND. THERE'S
MANY OTHER WAYS IN WHICH THE CITY, AS WE MOVE FORWARD, AS THE
CITY MANAGER SAYS, WE HAVE NEEDS IN THE CITY. THE FOREMOST WE DEAL
WITH EVERY DAY THAT TIES EXACTLY TO OUR EQUITY GOALS AND OUR
COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT FOLKS ACROSS THE CITY GET SERVICES.
WE ARE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF MORE MONEY ON ADDRESSING CLIMATE
CHANGE ISSUES BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT
ALREADY AFFECTING SO MANY AREAS OF THE CITY. WE HAVE TO BE AWARE
OF THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TAX HEARING. AND THE OTHER
ELEMENTS OF THIS, I'M THRILLED TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF USING SOME OF
THE FREE CASH IN THIS WAY. AND THE OTHER EXEMPTIONS ABOUT
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF EXEMPTIONS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
IS EXACTLY ALSO THE WAY WE SHOULD GO. I WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT
AND I REALIZE THERE ARE 11 VOTES. AS I REVIEW THEM. HALF ARE RELATED
TO ENSURE THE VULNERABLE POPULATION, INCREASING THE ASSET VALUE
FOR MANY OF THESE, THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE IN THE CITY AND WE
WANT TO KEEP IN THE CITY. AND MANY OF THEM WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP
IN THE CITY IF WE DON'T FIND WAYS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN UNDER THE
CURRENT LAWS TO APPROVE THAT AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT UPWARDS SO
THEY CAN STAY HERE.
AND I WILL NOTE, AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN THE FUTURE, WE'LL TALK ABOUT
WAYS TO INCREASE TAXES, I THINK MIT PROVIDES 15% OF THE ENTIRE TAX
BASE FOR THE ENTIRE CITY THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AS
WELL AS SOME PILOTS. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE INSTITUTIONS. I THINK
THERE'S AN ISSUE LONGER TERM ABOUT HOW IT IS WE ARE HAVE BECOME
SO ACCUSTOM TO DEVELOPMENT DOLLARS AND NEW DEVELOPMENT. 1.5
BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL VALUE THAT IS CREATED IN THE LAST YEAR,
IF I READ THIS CORRECTLY. AND IF THAT IS WHAT OUR TAX BASE IS
PREDICATED ON, WE NEED THAT TO CONTINUE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE
ALONG WHERE WE ARE GOING, I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE


PAGE 33

Jun 1, 2020

THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE ACTUALLY EVER DISCUSSED AND TALKED
ABOUT. I HOPE AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE FUTURE, THOSE ARE THE
QUESTIONS WE TALK ABOUT. HOW IF WE RELY ON THE CONTINUED
INCREASE IN VALUE IN DEVELOPMENT, THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THAT
THAT HAVE AFFECT THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE CITY. I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE DISCUSSIONS. I'M QUITE HAPPY TO SUPPORT ALL OF THIS. AND AS I
LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS, I WILL PROBABLY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. I
APPRECIATE BOTH FORMS OF MEMO. THE LONG VERSION AND THE
SUMMARY YOU PROVIDED. I HOPE THEY WILL APPEAR ON THE WEB SO
PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS WE ARE ABOUT TO
DO WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE A VOTE THAT IS QUITE
MONUMENTAL TO THIS. I YIELD, MAYOR SIDDIQUI.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE AND
APPRECIATE THIS IS YOUR LAST TAX RATE HEARING. I WAS SURPRISED TO
HEAR YOU SAY THAT, OF COURSE, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I JUST WANTED TO
TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR LEAVING THE CITY IN A STRONG
FINANCIAL POSITION, ESPECIALLY DURING COVID. I THINK WE WERE THE
ENVY OF THE OTHER 350 CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE COMMONWEALTH IN
THE WAY WE RESPONDED TO THE PANDEMIC. I WANTED TO SAY THAT TO
YOU AND TO YOUR TEAM.

>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I HAVE TO SAY, I'M FRUSTRATED BY THIS
CONVERSATION TONIGHT ONLY BECAUSE AS MONEY SAID EARLIER, IT DOES
FEEL LIKE DEJA VU. THIS IS THE FINAL STEP. THIS IS TOO LATE TO BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION. WHAT TO DO WITH THIS FREE CASH POSITION AND
HOW WE USE IT. I AGREE THERE ARE MAYBE BETTER POLICY TOOLS TO
PROTECT RENTERS AND THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. I'M WILLING TO
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. MR. KALE HAD TO LISTEN TO ME THIS
MORNING. I WANTED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE LATE POLICY ORDER THAT COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER HAS ON THE AGENDA TO HAVE AN ACTUAL HEARING ABOUT WHAT
ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S TAX RATE. IF THERE ARE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT BETTER
POLICY TOOLS TO PROTECT RENTERS. WHY WE DO THIS AND SHOULD IT BE A
PROCEDURE THAT WE USE GOING FORWARD.
THAT CONVERSATION SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AT THIS HEARING. I AGREE, IT
NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND AS COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SAID, MAYBE A BETTER
PLACE TO HAVE IT IN THE FINANCE MEETING. WE HAVE BEEN ASKING TO
HAVE THIS IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE FOR A WHILE NOW. IT JUST HAS NOT
HAPPENED. PERHAPS IT IS A JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING BETWEEN HOUSING
AND FINANCE TO GET IT GOING AND TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. I THINK
THE RESIDENTS HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY WE DO THIS EACH
AND EVERY YEAR. I KNOW HEARING FROM ALL THE COLLEAGUES TONIGHT, IT
SOUNDS LIKE WE ALL HAVE QUESTIONS. LET'S HAVE THAT MEETING AND
CONVERSATION. AND AS THE CITY MANAGER SAID, THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF
THINGS THAT THE COUNCIL PRIORITIES AND GOALS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED

PAGE 34

Jun 1, 2020

THROUGH FREE CASH. I AGREE. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE
BEEN COUNCIL PRIORITIES AND THINGS WE THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT
THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED OUT OF FREE CASH AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT I LOOK AT THE AWAITING REPORTS
LIST. MUNICIPAL BROADBAND, UNIVERSAL PRE OCCUR, CITY OWNED VACANT
BUILDINGS AND LOTS, JOBS PROGRAM, ALEWIFE PARCELS TO MEET CITY
GOALS. THERE ARE THINGS TO DO WITH $22.5 MILLION IF IT IS SOMETHING
WE DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AND NOT CONTINUE WITH THIS
PRACTICE.
THE WAY TO DO THAT, HAVE THAT HEARING. TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
AND BRING VOICES TO THE TABLE WHO CAN HELP US ANSWER SOME OF THE
REALLY TRICKY QUESTIONS. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT MEETING
AND FINALLY, STARTING THIS CONVERSATION. I WILL BE VOTING TO MOVE
ALL OF THESE FORWARD, AS I SAID, TONIGHT IS NOT THAT TIME TO HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION. I APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS
GONE INTO GETTING US TO THIS POINT BY OUR STAFF, BY OUR CITY
MANAGER, BY OUR FINANCE TEAM, AND ALL PEOPLE SITTING IN HERE IN THE
AUDIENCE, WHO WORK AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH COVID TO
MAKE SURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS WERE PROTECTED AND CARED FOR
DURING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.
AS I SAID, I WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TONIGHT. I VOTE YES, BUT I
LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND FINALLY TALKING
ABOUT THIS PRACTICE. AND HOW WE MAY WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.
THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR, I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE I THINK WE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY ONCE.
COUNCILLOR CARLONE, I SEE YOUR HAND IS UP. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
BRIEF TO ADD?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES, I DO. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR,
THROUGH YOU TO THE MANAGER. I WANT TO KNOW, WHEN I REREAD THE
DOCUMENT, I REALIZED THAT ALTHOUGH COMMERCIAL TAXES ARE 2/3 AND
PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED, I
ASSUME THAT'S BUILT OUT FACILITIES AND LABS AND OFFICES. I DON'T
KNOW. THERE'S VIRTUALLY VERY LITTLE ON THE COMMERCIAL RELATED
INFORMATION. THIS IS FOR THE NEXT YEAR, MR. KALE, HIS TEAM, AND THE
ASSESSOR, GAIL. WE NEED TO INCLUDE THAT. I REALIZE WHY RESIDENTIAL IS
THE FOCUS BECAUSE THE RESIDENTS AND THE COUNCIL JUST A THOUGHT
TO DO THAT.
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY, I REMEMBER THE TIMES WHEN NO
MONEY, OTHER THAN THE COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT, WENT INTO
HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THE COUNCIL TALKED TO THE
MANAGER AND HIS TEAM ABOUT THIS. WHEN YOU GO FROM LESS THAN A
MILLION DOLLARS INCREASE A YEAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN THE LAST
FEW YEARS, THAT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE. WE ALL THANK YOU FOR THAT
AND LISTENING AND RESPONDING.
ALL WE'RE DOING NOW, JUST ABOUT ALL THE COUNCILLORS SAID,


PAGE 35

Jun 1, 2020

INCREASING THE SCOPE OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT. THAT LIFE IS MORE THAN
BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A PRIME CATEGORY.
IT'S AFFORDABLE OPEN SPACE, AFFORDABLE PRE K, AND OTHER THINGS TO
EXPAND. WE HAVE THE MEANS AND THAT'S WHY WE DISCUSS IT. IT DOESN'T
BELITTLE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. MAYBE BECAUSE WE ARE COMING TO THE
TRANSITION POINT, WE ARE RAISING THE ISSUES MUCH MORE. I THINK THE
REPORT WAS MORE DETAILED AND MORE INFORMATIVE THAN THE PAST. I
COULD BE WRONG. IT LED TO QUESTIONING WHAT IS IN IT. I THINK THAT'S A
GOOD THING. THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE FURTHER QUESTIONS. I WILL JUST I
WON'T REPEAT WHAT COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. I AGREE WITH A LOT OF IT.
ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE, IT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY FOLKS HAVE
REACHED OUT ABOUT, THE INTERPLAY WITH THE AMERICAN RESCUE MONIES
COMING, $64 MILLION. SOME OF WHICH CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF THE
STUFF WE'LL BE USING FOR FREE CASH. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT? I THINK
WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE FINANCE CO CHAIRS ABOUT THAT PROCESS.
BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE INTERPLAY FOR THE PUBLIC?
>> CITY MANAGER: SO, ME AND DAVID WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY
AS WE LOOK AT WHAT COULD BE FREE CASH ELIGIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT. IF
GETTING READY FOR THE MEETING WE'LL HAVE. DAVID AND MICHELLE
KINKAID HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE IN MAKING SURE WHAT PROJECTS WE DO
COME UP MEET THE GUIDELINES. I'LL LET DAVID TALK ABOUT SOME OF
THOUGHTS WE HAVE ON THIS.
>> MR. KALE: SO, WE HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS OF REALLY
UNDERSTANDING DEEPLY THE ELIGIBLE CATEGORIES FOR WHICH WE CAN USE
THE MONEY FOR. WE HAVE GOT SOME OUTSIDE EXPERTISE. AND MICHELLE
KINKAID IS THE POINT. SO, AS THE CO CHAIRS INDICATED, WE'LL HAVE
ADDITIONAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN MEETINGS. WE'LL WELCOME
SUGGESTIONS BY THE COUNCIL. I THINK WE HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE
THINGS YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT. AND I THINK THE LESSON WE HAVE
LEARNED IS THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS TO MAKE SURE ANY MONIES WE
SPEND FROM THE GRANT CAN CLEARLY PASS THE TEST OF RECOVERY TO
COVID. AND I THINK THAT IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE GIVE IT
CREDIT FOR. AGAIN, WE'LL WORK WITH THE COUNCIL TO SOLICIT AND
ACCEPT THE IDEAS AND DO THE ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THOSE THINGS CAN
BE FUNDED FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE. THAT IS THE PLAN OF THE
FINANCE CO CHAIRS TO HAVE CONTINUED MEETING DIALOGUE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T HAVE A MEETING ON THE BOOKS FOR THAT
YET. I WILL LOOK FOR THE CO CHAIRS IF THERE IS ONE SENT OUT. I DON'T
THINK IT HAS BEEN SCHEDULED YET. WHAT I'M HEARING, IT WILL BE
SCHEDULED. OKAY. TO EVERYBODY'S EARLIER POINTS, TO VICE MAYOR
MALLON'S POINT, THERE ARE DIFFERENT NEEDS THAT HAVE COME UP,
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVID. I THINK THINGS HAVE BEEN FURTHER
EXACERBATED AND ALSO THE POINT AROUND HOW WE BEEN OUR EVOLVING
GOALS AS A COUNCIL. WITH THIS NEW TRANSITION AND WITH THE NEW
PEOPLE ON COUNCIL, IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE TWO


PAGE 36

Jun 1, 2020

THINGS TOGETHER AND HOW THEY INFORM THE TAX HEARING AND THE
POLICIES IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU, CITY MANAGER AND THE TEAM, FOR
THE PRESENTATION AND THEIR WORK. WE HAVE 11 VOTES BEFORE US.
WE'LL GO BACK TO YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: FIRST, I WANT TO THANK THE TEAM WHO HAS WORKED
HARD, THE BUDGET, ASSESSING, FINANCE, AND THE DEPARTMENT AS
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN MENTIONED, THE REASONS WE HAVE FREE CASH IS
BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENTS REALLY PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO THEIR
BUDGET. IT IS A PROCESS THAT EVERYBODY HAS BOUGHT ON AND I WANT TO
THANK EVERYBODY. ESPECIALLY THANK THE CHAIRS, WHO HAVE REALLY
PUSHED TO MAKE SURE WE COME UP WEAPON NEW IDEAS AND MAKE NEW
INITIATIVES. AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THEM AND THANK THE
COUNCIL FOR ALL THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT
HAS PUT US IN THE POSITION. THANK YOU.

Policy Order #2 as amended
That the City Manager is
requested to establish a written
plan designed to ensure that
Black people, Indigenous
people, and people of color will
be recruited by the City,
trained, and placed in
leadership positions throughout
the municipal government.

>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER THREE. DIRECT
APPROPRIATE STAFF TO DEVELOP A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. FILED BY MYSELF,
VICE MAYOR MALLON, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER. PULLED BY VICE MAYOR MALLON. AND WE'LL BRIEFLY BEGIN AND
STATE THAT VICE MAYOR MALLON AND I ARE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
POLICY COUNCIL. I CHAIR THE COUNCIL. AND ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY
POLICY COUNCIL, WE ARE REALLY HAPPY TO BE BRING THIS FORWARD
TONIGHT. WE'RE ALSO BRINGING IT FORWARD, MYSELF AND MEMBER
WILSON, WHO SITS ON THE FAMILY POLICY COUNCIL, WE BRING IT FORWARD
TO THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE TOMORROW. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE
FAMILY POLICY COUNCIL HAS BEEN MEETING REGULARLY TO THINK ABOUT
HOW CAMBRIDGE CAN BE A LEADER ON ACCESS AND PROMOTING
LANGUAGE JUSTICE. AS THE POLICY ORDER STATES, LANGUAGE JUSTICE IS
THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, EVERYONE HAS TO COMMUNICATE AND
UNDERSTOOD IN THE LANGUAGES THEY FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE. I THINK
IT IS A STATEMENT WE AGREE ON, WE DON'T HAVE THAT ACTUAL PLAN THAT
SHOWS HOW WE PRIORITIZE LANGUAGE JUSTICE.
THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL OF THE POLICY ORDER IS. COME UP WITH THIS PLAN
WITH A SPECIFIC TIMELINE, BUDGET, STAFFING, AND GOALS, TO ENSURE
CAMBRIDGE ADVANCES LANGUAGE JUSTICE. THERE'S BEEN SO MANY
MEETINGS. WE HAVE KEPT THE COUNCIL INFORMED THROUGH SOME
COMMUNICATIONS FROM OTHER OFFICERS ON THE VARIOUS MEETINGS
THAT HAVE OCCURRED. THE KEY LEARNINGS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND.
THERE'S BEEN, AS YOU HEARD FROM TINA, CO CHAIRING ALONG WITH THE
SCHOOLS, ROBIN HARRIS, WHO HAVE BEEN REALLY DIGGING INTO THIS DEEP
WORK. IT IS EXCITING TO BE REALLY AT THIS POINT. JUST TO ADDRESS A
POINT AROUND SOMEONE MADE AROUND PUBLIC COMMENT AND THE
INTERPRETATION POTENTIAL INTERPRETATION PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN
DISCUSSED. I'M HOPEFUL THERE'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME FORWARD AS THIS WORK CONTINUES.

COSPONSORS. I WILL GO TO VICE MAYOR MALLON?

THROUGH THE TWO YEAR PROCESS TO GET IT HERE AND. AND THANKS TO
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER FOR JOINING
US IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD TONIGHT. THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING NIGHT,
I THINK, FOR US TO THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS HERE IN THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN ENSURING THAT
ALL OF THE RESIDENTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN CIVIC LIFE.
AS THE MAYOR MENTIONED, FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS, MYSELF, THE
SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBER, AND MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY POLICY
COUNCIL, HAVE WORKED ON THIS AND HEARING FROM CITIES IN THE
COUNTRY, LIKE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, DENVER, COLORADO, AND BOSTON,
MASSACHUSETTS. THEY HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE
INTERACT WITH THEM AND SEE THE BEST PRACTICES. AND THERE HAVE BEEN
MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS TO FIGURE OUT HOW DEEP THE NEED IS FOR
LANGUAGE ACCESS PROGRAM HERE IN CAMBRIDGE AND HOW TO DEPLOY
THE RESOURCES. YOU HEARD FROM TINA FROM CEOC IN PUBLIC COMMENT,
THIS IS A DEEP, MEANINGFUL AND COLLABORATIVE WORK. INCLUDING CITY,
SCHOOLS, HEALTH DEPARTMENT, POLICE DEPARTMENT, COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS, FAMILIES AND SO MANY MORE.
JUST TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT LANGUAGE ACCESS LOOKS LIKE IN
DIFFERENT CITY, IT CAN BE A PRACTICE TO DO TRANSLATION IN MULTIPLE
LANGUAGE FOR CITY AND SCHOOL COMMUNICATION, ENSURE EACH PUBLIC
FACING DEPARTMENT, THERE'S EMPLOYEES WHO ARE BILINGUAL OR
MULTILINGUAL AND HAVING A PHONE TRANSLATION INTO MULTIPLE
LANGUAGE. THE MEETINGS ARE CLOSED CAPTIONED, LIVE TRANSLATION,
WRITTEN AND ORALLY AND UNDERSTANDING PLAIN LANGUAGE IS AN ISSUE.
LANGUAGE WE USE CAN BE READ AND UNDERSTOOD BY A LARGE MAJORITY
OF RESIDENTS. AND WHEN WE DON'T PRIORITIZE TRANSLATING MATERIALS
FROM THE SCHOOLS, WE KNOW THAT OUR CHILDREN BECOME
INTERPRETERS FOR PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS WHEN THEY LEARN TO READ. A
CITY LIKE CAMBRIDGE, WE SHOULD TAKE THIS BURDEN OFF THE CHILDREN
AND ENSURE KIDS DON'T HAVE TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION.
DURING THE PANDEMIC, WE SAW THAT AS A PUBLIC HEALTH IMPERATIVE TO
TRANSLATE PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO BE
ACCESS THROUGH MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. THIS YEAR, THE CITY'S BUDGET,
WE ADDED AROUND $250,000 FOR TRANSLATION IN THE CITIES AND THE
SCHOOL, THIS POLICY ORDER IS A CULMINATION OF TWO YEARS WORK BY
THE FAMILY POLICY COUNCIL AND WE'RE EXCITED TO PUT THIS FORWARD
FOR BUDGETARY APPROVAL. AND FOR FISCALLY 23, WHICH WILL START IN
JULY. WE REALLY HOPE THAT OUR COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN US IN MOVING
THIS FORWARD FOR CONSIDERATION IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. I YIELD BACK.

requested to direct appropriate

THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL. COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I BRING THIS FORWARD FOR MY
COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH US TO ADOPT THIS POLICY ORDER. THE
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS GO BACK A GOOD 30 YEARS, I MAY BE WRONG, IT
WAS AN INSTITUTION THAT PROVIDED ACCESS FOR RESIDENTS IN THEIR
NEIGHBORHOODS TO HAVE INPUT PRIMARY TO LOCAL PROGRAMMING. AND
WHAT MADE ME THINK OF THIS AND WHY I ASKED MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN
IN, WE AS THE COUNCIL HAVE SPOKEN TO ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO
IMPROVE AND INCREASE FAMILY AND INDIVIDUAL INVOLVEMENT IN
GOVERNANCE AND CITY AFFAIRS.
THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL, NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS DID, THEY TALKED
ABOUT THE PROGRAMMING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
FROM SENIOR PROGRAMS, RIGHT DOWN TO CHILDREN AND FAMILY
PROGRAMMING. I BELIEVE HAD WE HAD THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE
COMMUNITY SCHOOL NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS IN PLACE, SOME OF THE
DISCUSSIONS THAT FAILED TO HAPPEN AROUND THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS
AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED FAR EARLIER.
THIS IS A REQUEST, I'M HOPING FROM US TO THE CITY MANAGER, TO SAY IF
WE BELIEVE IN AUTHENTIC CITIZENSHIP INVOLVEMENT, GO BACK TO AN
IMPORTANT LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT WE USED TO HAVE, WHICH ARE THE
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS, IN THE HOPE THAT FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS
WILL BE MORE INFORMED ABOUT PROGRAMMING IN THE CITY. THE OTHER
THING I WANT TO MENTION, AS SENIOR PROGRAM HAS BEGUN TO LAG IN
THE CITY, I KNOW A NUMBER OF THE SENIORS FROM THE SENIOR ADVISORY
COMMITTEE, THEY SAID, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE HAD THESE
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS, WHICH ARE BASED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
TALKED ABOUT WHAT SERVICES THAT WE WERE GETTING.
IT DOESN'T BELITTLE OR DIMINISH WHAT THE COUNCIL ON AGING, THE
SENIOR CENTER, IS DOING, BUT TO ENHANCE AND INCLUDE SERVICES ON A
BROADER SCALE. JUST ONE EXAMPLE, WHEN WE DID HAVE A
NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL IN THE PORT, THERE WAS SENIOR PROGRAMMING
WHAT THE IS NOW CALLED THE MOORE YOUTH CENTER, COMMUNITY
CENTER. THAT SENIOR PROGRAM HAS CEASED TO EXIST, IN PART BECAUSE
THERE'S NO NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL AT THE FLETCHER MAYNARD
ACADEMY. I STAND OFFERING THIS ORDER WITH THE REPORT OF MY
COLLEAGUES AND HOPE THE BALANCE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL STAND IN
SUPPORT AND LET US MOVE FORWARD IN TRYING TO REINSTITUTE OUR
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I DON'T SEE ANY
OTHER HANDS UP. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.

Adopt Policy Order #4
That the City Manager is
requested to re-establish the
Community School
Neighborhood Councils

>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO ROUNDTABLE MINUTES. THERE ARE
