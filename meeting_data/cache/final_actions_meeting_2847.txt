“WHEREAS: single-family only zoning is an unnecessary artifact of historically
exclusionary housing practices, and two-family zoning can have similar eﬀects...”

“Adjust zoning in residential districts to be more compatible with prevailing

● Create a zoning category for residential neighborhoods that allows up
to three stories of multi-family housing

●

From 1980 to 2019, Cambridge added 45,000 jobs but only 13,000 units

●

Household sizes have declined (72% of households are 1 or 2 people), but
unit sizes remain large, especially in detached/semi-detached houses
○

Many small households have few options to downsize and live in larger units than
they need, taking space away from larger households
“I want Cambridge to expand its housing supply so that there are more units that
families and young people can move to. Cambridge has good schools, transit
access, job access, etc that should be available to more people.”

Cambridge Has a Severe Housing Shortage

Cambridge Vacant Storefront Database, CDD

“Every year, at high school graduation,
leaders tell CRLS graduates that Cambridge
is their home. But we need to add housing
so that Cambridge's children have some
hope of being able to return to the city
they've always been proud to call home.”
- Public Commenter, 2/17/2021

The Housing Shortage Damages Our Community
●

People pushed out of Cambridge include
municipal employees (teachers, police), church
community members, high school graduates,
artists, friends, etc.

●

Nearly half of Cambridge residents are
rent-burdened; even those who can stay do
not have security for the future

●

With rising rents and without more local
patrons, local businesses have to work
harder to succeed
