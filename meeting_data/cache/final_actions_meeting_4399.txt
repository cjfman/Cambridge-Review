Trash Disposal Concerns for New England
Limited landfill/incinerator capacity=MA has
highest trash disposal cost of all states.
• In 2014, 700,000 tons of trash was exported
out of state.
• In 2020, 2.2M tons was exported.
Exporting is expected to increase as MA landfills
close.
Nearby States have limited capacity too:
• CT exports 40% of their trash
• ME has banned out‐of‐state trash

Bill Title: An Act to Expand the Bottle Bill, S2014 & H3690 Lead Sponsors: Senator Cynthia Creem and Representative
Marjorie Decker
Deposits are the single most successful tactic for recycling beverage containers. But the bottle bill has not been updated since it
became law 40 years ago. This bill would expand the deposit to cover water bottles, nips. vitamin drinks and other containers---the
vast majority of which end up as litter or waste. It also raises the deposit from 5 to 10 cents.
Bill Title: An Act Reducing Plastic Bag Pollution, H784 &S477 Lead Sponsors: Representative Mindy Domb and Senator
James Eldridge
Nothing we use for an average of 6 minutes should pollute our environment for years. Plastic bags litter our parks and open space,
choke marine animals, and waste millions of gallons of petroleum, one of their main ingredients. This bill would follow the 150 +
cities and towns in our state, including Boston, which have already restricted single use plastic bags.
Bill Title: An Act to Save Recycling Costs in the Commonwealth, H779 & S572 Lead Sponsors: Representative Michael Day
and Senator Michael Rush
This bill will reduce packaging waste and improve recycling by creating a “polluter pays” model of producer responsibility for
packaging and other items, making producers responsible for funding collection and recovery of materials they use and sell.
Bill Title: An Act to Restrict the Use of Polystyrene, H3627 & S1328 Lead Sponsors: Representative Marjorie Decker and
Senator Michael Barrett
For decades, we’ve known that one of the worst forms of plastic pollution is polystyrene foam—what most of us call Styrofoam.
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that Americans throw away an estimated 25 billion polystyrene cups every year, or
about 82 cups per person. Polystyrene doesn’t degrade, is not recyclable, and as a result it clogs our landfills, litters our streets,
and pollutes our environment. This bill prohibits the sale and use of most single-use polystyrene containers.
