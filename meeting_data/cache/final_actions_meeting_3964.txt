FIRST PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS... WE'LL ADJUST THE TIME TO TWO
MINUTES. I'M READ THE NAME. JOHN, HOLD TIGHT. WE'LL GET TO YOU IN A
FEW SECONDS. JOHN, GO AHEAD?
>> GOOD EVENING. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M JOHN. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT FOR
POLICY ORDER 246. AND THAT IS A TEMPORARY PAUSE ON OFFICE LAB IN THE
ALEWIFE QUADRANGLE. TWO YEARS AGO, THEY PURCHASED THE QUAD AND
PETITION TO CHANGE THE ZONING TO BUILD A HUGE LAB. THEY CLAIM THEY
WERE FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES FROM WILL ALEWIFE DISTRICT PLAN TO
THAT ALLOW THE HEIGHT, THEY LEFT OUT THE FACT THE SAME PLAN CALLED
FOR WIDER STREETS AND SIDEWALKS. IN THE GUISE OF CONFORMING TO
THE ALEWIFE DISTRICT PLAN, THEY WERE CHERRY PICKING TO WHAT IS THEIR
ADVANTAGE BY OBSCURING WHAT IS NOT. A DEVELOPER KNOWN FOR LAB
BUILDINGS ACQUIRED MOST HOLDINGS, IN ADDITION TO OTHER PROPERTIES
AMOUNTING TO 36 ACRES. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO, WE
CAN'T REPEAT THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID IN THAT WE CAN'T BE CAUGHT
OFF GUARD WITHOUT HAVING THE ENVISION AND ALEWIFE DISTRICT PLAN BE
REVIEWED AND ORDAINED BY THE CITY. I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO START A
PUBLIC REVIEW PROCESS OF THE ENVISION CAMBRIDGE AND ALEWIFE
DISTRICT PLAN SO THAT WE CAN TURN THE PLANS INTO CITY ZONING AND
JUST A NOTE THE QUAD IS ALREADY A SURROUNDED BY SATURATED TRAFFIC
ALONG THE FRESH POND PARKWAY AND CONCORD AVENUE. AND WE
CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE OVERDEVELOPMENT IN THE QUAD. AND WE'D
LIKE TO HAVE THE PROCESS TO BEGIN SO THAT WE HAVE CLEAR STRATEGIC
PLANNING IN PLACE FOR THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUAD. THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON, IS YOUNG KIM.
>> YOUNG KIM, GO AHEAD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> YES. I CANNOT SEE MY SCREEN. CAN YOU REMOVE THE SCREEN SO CAN I
READ FROM MY SCRIPT.
>> IF YOU PRESS ESCAPE, IT SHOULD RETURN TO YOUR NORMAL SCREEN, BUT
WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. THIS IS YOUNG KIM, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS.
I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE MY LETTER THAT I SENT THIS MORNING. AN
EXPLANATION OF WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK. FIRST, THANK YOU, MAYOR
SIDDIQUI AND COUNCILLORS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON ORDER
NUMBER FIVE OF MASS AVENUE BIKE LANE IMPROVEMENTS. I WANT TO
THANK COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND OTHERS WHO MADE THE COMMUNITY
MEETING POSSIBLE AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR INTRODUCING THIS
ORDER. HOWEVER, THIS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
AND TRANSPARENCY. I REQUEST THAT THIS ORDER BE MODIFIED TO ASK THE
CITY MANAGER TO SEIZE THE PROJECT UNTIL A MEMORANDUM SIMILAR TO
THE RINDGE AVENUE, MIDDLESEX STREET, INTERSECTION IS ALLOWED. THE


PAGE 2

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

PLAN IS FULL OF FLAWS DUE TO INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS. I WILL NAME A
FEW OF THEM AND THOSE ARE ALL EXPLAINED IN MY EMAIL.
INBOUND 4 6, WHICH CAUSE CONFLICT BETWEEN BUS AND THE CARS. THE
FOUR WAY STOP AT HARVARD STREET WILL CAUSE CARS TO BACK UP TO
MASS AVENUE. AND 270 FEET OF MASS AVENUE TO THE ALEWIFE PARKWAY,
IT IS A GATEWAY FOR COMMUTERS. IT IS VERY SHORT PERIOD IS GOING TO
CAUSE DANGEROUS CONFUSION AND GRIDLOCK. WHERE ARE THE
DELIVERIES AND SERVICE...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU CAN
EMAIL THE REMAINDER TO US. SIX PERSON IS CYNTHIA HUGHES. WE HAVE A
VERY SMALL BUSINESS, WE HAVE BEEN THERE 18 YEARS. AND WE ARE GOING
TO GET KILLED WITH THIS. PUT OUT OF BUSINESS. A LOT OF BUSINESS WILL
STRUGGLE, IT JUST WON'T WORK, NOT JUST FOR US, BUT FOR A LOT. BLOCK
DOWN IS 2464 MASS AVENUE, OFFICE BUILDING WITH 60 OFFICES IN IT. I
HAVE CUT THE HAIR OF SEVEN PEOPLE RECENTLY WHO KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS. 60 OFFICES AND IF YOU HAD ONE CUSTOMER PER HOUR IN
EACH OFFICE, 480 VISITORS A DAY. PARKING IS NOT ALLOWED BY
CUSTOMERS. ONLY FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE BACK. WHERE ARE THEY GOING
TO PARK? PRE COVID IN 2018 AND THIS YEAR, I HAD 912 HAIRCUTS IN ONE
WEEK. COVID KILLED US, BUT WE ARE CRAWLING OUT. AFTER COVID,
DOUBLE VACCINATION, WE HAD 447 SHOTS THIS TIME OF YEAR AND THIS
WEEK.
WHEN CONSTRUCTION STARTED, LAST WEEK I DID 270 CUTS. I TOOK TURNS
ASKING EVERYBODY WHO AND HOW THEY GOT THERE. I HAD 17 BICYCLES.
57 PEOPLE WALKED. I HAD 196 PEOPLE DRIVE TO MY SHOP LAST WEEK.
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO PARK? YOU TAKE 82 PARKING SPOTS FROM THE
ENTIRE PROJECT AND YOU ARE LOCATING 12 METERED SPOTS ON VARIOUS
SIDE STREETS BETWEEN 11 BLOCK RADIUS. WHERE ARE MY CUSTOMERS
GOING TO PARK? WHO IS GOING TO PAY MY MORTGAGE AND MY CHILD
THAT GOES TO COLLEGE? I WILL BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AND NOBODY
DISCUSSES THE BIKE PATH THAT RUNS BEHIND THIS ENTIRE FIRST SECTION,
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE. IF THEY ARE GOING TO
INCONVENIENCE US WITH NO PARKING, WHY CAN'T WE ASK THEM TO DRIVE
THE BICYCLE DOWN A HALF BLOCK OR A BLOCK AND ACCESS THAT PATH FOR
THIS FIRST SECTION UNTIL YOU GET THIS RIGHT AND SLOW IT DOWN AND DO
IT RIGHT. YOU ARE GOING TO COMPLETELY CRIPPLE THE SMALL BUSINESSES
OF CAMBRIDGE. PEOPLE ARE FOLDING ALREADY FROM THIS. I REALLY JUST
GOT MY FIRST MORTGAGE AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JUSTIN SAIF.
>> HI, JUSTIN. HURLEY STREET. EAST CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO STATE MY
STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE CAMPAIGN FINANCES. THE RULES ARE TOO
BROAD AND VAGUE AND RISK CAMBRIDGE FACING AN EXPENSIVE LAWSUIT.
BESIDES BEING DEAD ON ARRIVAL AT THE LEGISLATURE. THE ORDINANCE HAS
ELEMENTARY LEVEL DRAFTING ERRORS. IT DEFINES APPLICANT. IT FAILS TO
DEFINE TECHNICAL TERMS USED IN ELECTION LAWS WITH MEANING. LIKELY
FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES. I KNOW COMPARED THIS PROPOSAL TO

PAGE 3

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

SOMERVILLE, THIS HAS VERY IMPORTANT AND HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC
DIFFERENCES. THIS PROPOSAL APPLIES BROADLY. AND WITH UNCLEAR
DEFINITION. SUCH THE RULES CAN APPLY TO HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY OF THEM KNOWING. THE SOMERVILLE ORDINANCE IS
ON SHAKY GROUND AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO LEGAL CHALLENGE, EVEN IF ONE IS
NOT MOUNTED. PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE ON THE MOST IMPORTANT
PUBLIC DEBATE, INCREASING THE HOUSING SUPPLY SOME RESPONSE TO THE
CRISIS. IN TERMS OF OVERDRAFT, THE RULES APPLY TO WORKERS AND MANY
RESTAURANTS THAT PROVIDED MORE THAN 25,000 IN MEALS AS WELL AS
SPOUSES AND CHILDREN. RULES APPLY TO RECIPIENTS OF MORTGAGE DOWN
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE AND SPOUSES AND CHILDREN. THE RULES APPLY TO
MANY NONPROFITS RECEIVING CITY GRANTS AND THEIR SPOUSES AND
CHILDREN. IT APPLIES TO ANY UNDERDEFINED AFFILIATES OF THOSE PEOPLE.
RULES APPLY TO SO MANY PEOPLE, DISTANCE FROM MANY DONATION OR
SOLICITATION, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ETHNIC COMMISSION TO KEEP
TRACK. I FIND IS IRONIC WE ADDRESS A BAD GOVERNANCE... AS A CITY
SOLICITOR OFFICE MADE CLEAR, THE RULES ARE HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC AND I
URGE YOU TO SEND THEM BACK OR PUT THEM ON THE TABLE RATHER THAN
PUSH FORWARD TO AN OVERREACHING BOONDOGGLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANN STEWART.
>> HI. I LIVE IN WHEELER STREET IN THE QUAD. I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU
UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 246 BECAUSE I THINK HAS THE
POTENTIAL TO GET NEIGHBORS, CDD, AND THE COUNCIL OUT OF THE STREET
WARS WHERE WE HAVE TO RESPOND PROJECT BY PROJECT TO SPECIAL
PERMITS. CDD ANNOUNCED IT IS INVITING THE PUBLIC TO SHAPE THE
APPROACH TO PARKS AND OPEN SPACES FOR THE NEXT 7 10 YEARS. AND THE
FIRST MEETING HAPPENS BY ZOOM IN TWO DAYS. I'D LIKE TO SEE OPEN
SPACE IN THE HIGHLAND QUADS TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF THE FRESH POND
RESERVATION PATH WHERE I BELIEVE UP TO AT LEAST 1,500 PEOPLE PER DAY
USE IT.
MY CASE IN POINT, THIS SUMMER A RENTAL CONDO IN THE QUAD WAS
MARKETED AS BEING NEAR GLORIOUS FRESH POND, WHICH GIVES YOU
EXAMPLE OF HOW PRECIOUS THAT AREA IS. ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THAT CDD HAS THE TIME, TOOLS, AND THE FUNDING, THIS ORDER WILL GIVE
THAT TO THEM, I HOPE. I'D LIKE TO SEE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT
FOLLOWS THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THE PUBLIC, AND THE ALEWIFE WORKING
GROUP AND GET THIS ONE RIGHT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANNETTE OSGOOD.
>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> CLIFTON STREET AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER FIVE,
SPONSORED BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN THAT REQUESTS A STUD TOW KEEP
PARKING ALONG MASS AVENUE AND DUDLEY STREET. THIS COMPROMISE
WILL HELP TO ADDRESS CONCERNS CAUSED BY THE MOVE OF OVER 80
PARKING SPACES TO EXPAND THE EXISTING BIKE LANE IN COMPLIANCE TO

PAGE 4

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

THE CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE. I URGE THE COUNCIL TO APPOINT A CITY
WIDE PROJECT MANAGER IN CHARGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF ALL THE
BICYCLE LANES THROUGHOUT CAMBRIDGE THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO
REACH OUT TO THE NEEDED CITY DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.
THE CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE REQUIRES OVER 25 MILES OF PROTECTED
BIKE LANES AND THE REDESIGN OF ALL OF MASS AVENUE. IT NEEDS CITY
WIDE PROJECT MANAGEMENT WORKING WITH THE GROUP OF
STAKEHOLDERS THAT IS SPECIFICALLY CHARGED WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF
SEEING HOW ALL THE MILES OF PROTECTED LANES AFFECT THE CITY AS A
WHOLE. THE DEPARTMENT OF TRAFFIC ALONE CAN'T DESIGN THIS PLAN IN
ISOLATION. THIS ORDER PUT FORTH TODAY, JUST REQUESTING A REPORT,
SHOULD HAVE ALREADY HAD BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE WE GOT IN THIS FAR IN
THE PLANNING. A PROJECT MANAGER AND WORKING GROUP SHOULD HAVE
THE ABILITY TO GATHER DATA ON TRAFFIC MBTA USES, EMERGENCY
SERVICES, AND ENSURE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IS BEING DONE TO CREATE
SAFE STREETS AND SUPPORT BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS AND COMMUTERS
OF ALL TRANSPORTATION. THERE ARE CURRENTLY ON THE CITY AGENDA
RIGHT NOW, THREE ITEMS AWAITING REPORT THAT HAVE TO DO WITH
SHARED PARKING. THESE SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE PLANNING OF THE
PROTECTED BIKE LANES TO ENSURE PARKING IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL THAT
NEED IT. A PROJECT MANAGER OR A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS WILL GIVE
PEOPLE OF CONCERN ONE PLACE TO TURN KNOWING THAT GROUP WOULD
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH OTHER CAMBRIDGE DEPARTMENTS.
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW, EVALUATE, AND ADJUST THE COMPLETED
SECTIONS THAT NEED ATTENTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SORRY. THAT'S TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE PUBLIC
COMMENT. NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANN TENNIS.
>> GOOD EVENING. I LIVE ON GRISWOLD STREET AND SPEAK ON POLICY
ORDER 246. I'M ASKING THAT THIS BE PASSED. THE CITY HAS BEEN MEETING
FOR APPROXIMATELY 40 YEARS WITH THE GOAL OF CHANGING THE ZONING
AND THE QUADRANGLE PART OF ALEWIFE. MANY PROGRAMS AND PLANS
HAVE BEEN PROPOSED OVER THE YEARS AND NEVER IMPLEMENTED. WITH
THE FINAL ONE BEING ENVISION ALEWIFE DISTRICT PLANNING IN 2019.
AS ALL OF THE PLANS READ, THE QUADRANGLE NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED
WITH CLIMATE ISSUES, SPECIFICALLY FLOODING IN MIND, ALONG WITH BEING
DEVELOPED AS A NEIGHBORHOOD MIX, RETAIL, HOUSING, OPEN SPACE,
LIBRARY, POLICE, FIRE, ET CETERA. PLEASE PASS POLICY ORDER 246, WHICH
SIMPLY ASKS THAT THE QUAD BE ZONED WITH THE APPROPRIATE VENUES IN
CONSULTATION WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF THE HIGHLAND QUAD
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS
OF OUR CITY. WE DO NOT NEED NOR WANT ANOTHER KENDALL SQUARE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE DANICA. AND FOLLOWED BY
DAVID.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?


PAGE 5

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 246.
MY NAME IS DANICA, AND LIVE ON NORMANDY AVENUE. A COUPLE OF
QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT THAT IS WHERE DID MY COMMENTS GO? I'M
SORRY. A PARCEL LIKE THIS, IT IS A REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY, BUT ALSO A
VERY BIG VULNERABILITY. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE AREA IS SET UP FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, THE AREA BEING THE QUADRANGLE,
BEFORE ANY DEVELOPMENT BEGINS. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TOW
CORRECT THE LACK OF GREEN SPACE IN THE QUAD AND WE HAVE TO STUD
WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED BEFORE WE STRESS
THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T MATTER IF PEOPLE
CAN'T GET IN OR OUT OF IT. THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS TO BE
INCORPORATED THAT WE NEED A REAL COMPREHENSIVE PLAN BEFORE ANY
DEVELOPMENT PROCEEDS. THANK YOU. I YIELD MY TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, DAVID, FOLLOWED BY KATHY. AND THEN
ALAN. CAN YOU PUT THAT ON, WE'LL HEAR YOU CLEARER ONCE THE
MICROPHONE IS ON.
>> HELLO. I'M DAVID. CAMBRIDGE STREET. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF
POLICY ORDER NUMBER FIVE. I WORSHIP AT ST. PAUL'S AT HARVARD
SQUARE. WE HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION OF PARKING SPACES ON MASS
AVENUE, WHICH IS PREVENTING ELDERLY AND DISABLED PARISHIONERS
FROM ATTENDING MASS AT THE CHURCH. AND IT IS ALSO AFFECTING THE
ABILITY OF THE MINISTERS TO VISIT HOMEBOUND PARISHIONERS. THAT
WOULD BE A FACTOR ON THE UPPER MASS AVENUE SITUATION, WHICH IS
DEVELOPING. IT SEEMS TO SOME PARISHIONERS, CAMBRIDGE IS NOW
EMPHASIZING THE YOUNG AND THE FIT. THIS IS AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THIS
ON NEXT DOOR, THE WEBSITE. SOMEONE SAID, YOU CAN'T WALK FOR FIVE
MINUTES, YOU SHOULDN'T YOU DON'T BELONG IN THE CITY. THIS SEEMS
TO BE THE CONCERN THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. CAMBRIDGE NEEDS TO
SHOW MORE RESPECT FOR THE ELDERLY, DISABLED PEOPLE, SO THEY CAN
RECEIVE THEIR SPIRITUAL NEED THE MET FROM THEIR PARISHES. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE KATHY DUTRA.
>> KATHY HAS NOT JOINED.
>> HI, I'M ALLAN. UNION STREET AND FIRST REGARDING THE ALEWIFE
MORATORIUM, POLICY ORDER 24, I SUPPORT THIS, I CALL ATTENTION TO THE
BIGGER PICTURE, THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLICATED ZONING AND
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES COMING FOR THE CITY. THE COUNCIL REALLY WANTS
TO PRIORITIZE, I THINK. AND IN ORDER TO HANDLE THE COMPLICATED AND
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, WE NEED QUALITY ENGAGEMENT FROM THE COUNCIL
TO SET LEADERSHIP, PRIORITIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. FROM
WHAT I SEE THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY WHAT THEY NEED AND I URGE
YOU TO LOOK AT BOTH PROBLEMS. TO GET ALEWIFE ZONING DONE, WE'LL
NEED THAT CAPACITY AS WELL AS TO GET ALL THE OTHER ZONING DONE. I'M
HERE REGARDING THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCE, COMMITTEE


PAGE 6

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

REPORT FOUR. EVERY TIME I LOOKED AT THE TEXT, I FIND A PROBLEM. THIS
IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF NOT HAVING CAPACITY TO LOOK AT ISSUES. IT
PLACE A LARGE NUMBER OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS IN A CONFUSING
POSITION OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY. IF YOU SIGNED A ZONING PETITION CITY
WIDE OR MIT EMPLOYEE WHO SOLICITED DONATION FOR A FRIEND OF
THEIRS, I KNOW THE TEXT OF THE ORDINANCE CAME FROM A SIMILAR
MEASURE THAT SOMERVILLE PASSED, IT WAS MORE CONTAINED, MORE
SPECIFIC. AND ALMOST ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TALKED TO
HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCE.
THEY HAVE COME FROM CHANGES THAT ARE NOT IN SOMERVILLE'S VERSION.
I URGE YOU TO GIVE THIS MATTER ATTENTION AND I URGE YOU TO GIVE THE
MATTER OF GENERAL STAFF AND COUNCIL CAPACITY TO LEGISLATIVELY
DETAIL ATTENTION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE RUTH RYALS.
>> RUTH AND BARBARA ARE NOT ON THE ZOOM. MARK, GO AHEAD?
>> HELLO. I'M MARK. WALDEN STREET IN CAMBRIDGE. AND I'M SPEAKING
ABOUT POLICY ORDER NUMBER FIVE. THE UPPER MASS AVENUE BIKE LANES.
I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT CONDITIONS OF CYCLING ON NORTH
MASS AVENUE AND THE NEEDED CHANGES THERE. LOOKING AT THE CDD
CRASH DATA, IT IS CLEAR THERE'S AN ELEVATED CRASH RATE IN THE SECTION
BETWEEN DUDLEY STREET AND ALEWIFE BROOK PARKWAY. THEY MAY LOOK
LIKE BLUE OR YELLOW BUBBLES ON THE MAP, BUT THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS
AND WHERE RESPONDERS HAVE BEEN CALLED. SOME COUNCILLORS BEGAN
TO SHARE REPORT S. AND CRASH RATES, THIS ROADWAY IS
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN CARS. TEENAGERS ON BIKE
AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY FROM OTHER PARTS TO DANEHY PARK, RUSSELL
FIELD, IT IS TERRIFYING TO WATCH AS THEY RIDE NEXT TO LARGE FAST
MOVING TRUCKS. NOBODY WANTS THEIR CHILD TO EXPERIENCE THAT AND
NOT ON A ROUTINE BASES. THIS YEAR I BEGAN DOING FOOD PANTRY
DELIVERIES USING A CARGO BIKE, DELIVERING FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO
FAMILIES IN NEED ALONG MASS AVENUE AND OTHER PARTS OF CAMBRIDGE.
CURRENT CONDITIONS MAKE IT STRESSFUL AND DANGEROUS THAN IT
SHOULD BE.
FOR THE REASONS, I URGE YOU TO AMEND THIS AND THE CITY MANAGER
EXPLORE THE INFORMATION, SUCH THERE IS NO DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION.
THAT IS NOT CLEAR AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. I UNDERSTAND
IMPLEMENTATION MAY HAVE STARTED TODAY, CAN THIS COUNCIL PLEASE
ENSURE THAT IT PROCEEDS AS PLANNED? THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE MARJORIE DAVIES.
>> HELLO. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE NET ZERO ACTION PLAN IS A
THOROUGH AND IMPRESSIVE DOCUMENT AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
PLACES WHERE THE PLAN SHOULD SPEED UP. LARGE BUILDINGS ARE THE BIG
SOURCE OF GREENE HOUSE EMISSIONS IN CAMBRIDGE, THE BEUDO
PERFORMANCE SHOULD BE AS STRONG AND EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE. THE
REQUIREMENTS ARE BEFORE THE COUNCIL, I HAVE QUESTIONS. FIRST,


PAGE 7

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

METHOD FOR SETTING EMISSIONS TARGETS? WHY IS IT BETTER TO USE A
PERCENTAGE REDUCTION METHOD RATHER THAN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT THAT
BUILDINGS MUST REACH? AND PERCENTAGE METHOD ALLOWS A BIG
GREENE HOUSE GAS EMITTER TO CONTINUE TO EMIT LARGE AMOUNTS, EVEN
IF IS A REDUCED PERCENTAGE. AND THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS USE
THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT APPROACH, WHY NOT CAMBRIDGE? SECOND,
ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE CREDITS. ARE THE AMOUNTS SET HIGH ENOUGH,
PAYMENT OWNERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE IF THEY DON'T MEET THE
TARGETS. THEY HAVE TO BE HIGH ENOUGH SO THE OWNERS REDUCE THE
EMISSIONS INSTEAD OF PAYING AN ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE CREDIT.
COVERING MORE BUILDINGS. TO GET REDUCTIONS, CAN WE EXPAND THE
REQUIREMENTS TO MORE BUILDINGS? WHY NOT INCLUDE BUILDINGS WITH
MORE THAN 15 UNITS RATHER THAN THE 50 UNIT FLOOR. THE BOSTON
REQUIREMENTS HAVE A 15 UNIT FLOOR FOR RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES,
WHY NOT CAMBRIDGE? THE CRISIS IS AN EMERGENCY, PUBLIC HEALTH
EMERGENCY AND ECO LOGICALLY EMERGENCY. AND CAMBRIDGE HAS THE
CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES AS WE HAVE SHOWN IN THE CITY'S
IMPRESSIVE RESPONSE TO THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC. AND LET'S MAKE SURE
WE JOIN OTHER CITIES IN SHOWING THE WAY TO RESPONDING TO THE
EMERGENCY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. SUSAN AGGER?
>> HI, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER NUMBER 246. THIS
POLICY REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO DEVELOPING AN URBAN DESIGN
PLAN FOR THE QUADRANGLE THAT WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ENVISION ALEWIFE DISTRICT PLAN. THIS AREA
WILL CONNECT WEST HIGHLAND TO CAMBRIDGE AND AFFORDS US A HUGE
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE SURROUNDING AREAS, WHICH
IN MY MIND, INCLUDE THE FRAGILE GREEN SPACE AREAS, AS WELL AS
ALEWIFE AND FRESH POND. I LIVED IN THE AREA IN THE HIGHLANDS FOR 31
YEARS AND I ATTENDED MOST CITY COUNCIL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS
RELATED TO THE UPZONING PETITIONS BY THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPER.
I'M HOPEFUL THIS ORDER IS A STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF NOT ALLOWING
DEVELOPERS TO DICTATE WHAT THE AREA WILL BECOME, INSTEAD AFFORDS
US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A THOUGHTFUL PLAN SATISFYING VARYING
NEEDS, CLIMATE RESILIENCE INITIATIVES, INCREASING TREE CANOPY,
ADDITIONAL GREEN SPACE AND PROTECTION OF GREEN SPACE, WHICH
INCLUDES PROTECTING THE HYDROLOGY OF THE AREA. I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS
THAT THE CITY MUST GO BEYOND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ALEWIFE
DISTRICT PLAN TO CREATE A PHYSICAL URBAN DESIGN PLAN FOR THE
QUADRANGLE TO SATISFY INITIATIVES, WHICH ENSURES CONNECTIVITY TO
THE AREA TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BEFORE BUILDING, THERE MUST BE
AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT DONE REGARDING THE IMPACT OF
FLOODING, STORM WATER, AND INCREASE SEWER OUTFLOW. WE KNOW
FLOODING IS NOT A MATTER OF IT, BUT A MATTER OF WHEN AND HOW. WE
NEED TO BEEN THIS AS WE PUT TOGETHER A PLAN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ELENA FAGOTTO.


PAGE 8

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY. BIG LOW STREET AND I HAVE BEEN A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT FOR 21
YEARS. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF MOTHER'S OUT FRONT, CIVIC ORGANIZATION
OF WOMEN MOBILIZING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M HERE TO SPEAK
INTEREST THE BUILDING ENERGY USE DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE PROPOSED
AMENDMENTS. AS YOU CONSIDER REVISING, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE BOLD
AND AMBITIOUS. WE NEED LEADERSHIP IF WE ARE TO FIGHT THIS
EMERGENCY. I URGE YOU TO MAKE YOUR TARGETS FOR GREENE HOUSE
GRASS CUTS MORE AMBITIOUS. I URGE YOU TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE
ORDINANCE TO INCLUDE BUILDINGS THAT MEASURE LESS THAN 25,000
SQUARE FEET. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WITH
FEWER THAN 50 UNITS. AND EXPAND INVESTMENTS AND SWITCH TO
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. CLIMATE CHANGE HURTS THE
ENVIRONMENT, BUT IT HURTS OR HEALTH AND REPERCUSSIONS ARE HARDER
ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I'M THE
MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN, AND YOUR DECISIONS ARE IN THE
FUTURE OF ALL CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY. YOUR DECISIONS ARE
CRITICAL. THEY WILL IMPACT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS EQUITY AND
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THEY WILL IMPACT THE
CLIMATE RESILIENCE OF CAMBRIDGE. I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING
YOUR DECISION ON THIS CRITICAL MATTER AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE SCOTT BOHN.
>> GOOD EVENING. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> I'M SCOTT. CAMBRIDGE PARK DRIVE. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF A
PROPERTY. I SPEAK ON ITEM 4, UNDER THE POLICY ORDERS. YOU ARE
AWARE, THEY HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL PROPERTIES IN THE ALEWIFE
QUADRANGLE. I WILL STRESS AT THE OUTSET, WE ARE COMMITTED TO
WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH THE CITY, COMMUNITY GROUPS AND
STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THIS PROPERTY IN A WAY THAT ACHIEVES KEY
COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES, AT THE SAME TIME CREATING A GREAT PLACE TO
LIVE AND WORK. A FEW WORDS ABOUT HEALTH PEAK, WE DEVELOP REAL
ESTATE FOR THE LONG TERM. WE ARE NOT A DEVELOPER AND SELL. THIS IS
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND DILIGENT IN THE PLANNING
PROCESS TO ENSURE WE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO PLAN AND BUILD
ICONIC BUILDINGS THAT BECOME INTERWOVEN INTO COMMUNITIES THAT
PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR OUR RESIDENTS. WE SPENT TIME STUDYING THE
PLAN AND IT IS A GUIDING DOCUMENT FOR WHAT WE SEEK TO DEVELOP IN
THE AREA. WE EMBRACE THE OVERARCHING THEMES OF THE PLAN,
INCLUDING A MIXED USE DISTRICT, INCLUDING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND
RESIDENTIAL USES WITH FOCUS ON URBAN FORM, MOBILITY, TRAFFIC
MITIGATION, CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY, AND PUBLIC GREEN SPACE.
PUTTING AT THIS TIME THE PROPERTIES THAT INCLUDE OVER 36 ACRES IN
THE QUAD, HEALTH PEAK IS IN A POSITION TO AFFECT WAIT THE CHANGE

PAGE 9

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

THAT THE VISION PLAN SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE. A PROJECT OF THIS SCALE
REQUIRES AN EXTREMELY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO PLANNING, WITH
INPUT FROM MANY PARTIES. WE PLAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE PLANNING
PROCESS HAND IN HAND WITH THE CITY AND THE COMMUNITY AND OPEN
AND TRANSPARENT MANNER TO CREATE A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT IS
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. ON BEHALF OF HEALTH PEAK, I REITERATE OUR
EXCITEMENT TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU FOR
YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT.
>> I WANT TO COMMENT ON THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE POLICY ORDER
ORDINANCE. I THINK OTHERS HAVE SAID IT BETTER, I REALLY DO THINK THIS
PROVIDES A REALLY CONFUSING SET OF GUIDELINES. A CONFUSING SET OF
TEXT. AND I THINK IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE WHAT IT SETS OUT TO OR WHAT HAS
BEEN ACHIEVED IN OTHER CITIES, LIKE SOMERVILLE. I REALLY SAID EARLIER, I
SUPPORT LOWERING CAMPAIGN FINANCE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS ACROSS
THE BOARD. AND I HAVE SAID THAT I THINK HAVING SOMETHING THAT
CREATES DATA WHEN PEOPLE APPLY FOR PERMITS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE
CITY, IT MAKES GOOD SENSE. THAT'S GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS CAMPAIGN
FINANCE POLICY ORDER OR ORDINANCE LANGUAGE IS NOT GOOD
GOVERNANCE. IT IS INCOMPLETE. AND FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT IS
IMPORTANT TO US MOVE BEYOND THE CONSTANT CLAIMS OF NEGATIVE
INFLUENCE IN OUR POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS. I THINK THEY ARE HARMFUL TO
ALL AND BETTER OFF IF WE COULD MOVE PASS THEM AND UNDERSTAND
THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING AT THIS TIME TO CREATE A BETTER CITY.
I WANTED TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE ZONING MORATORIUM OR BUILDING
MORATORIUM IN THE QUAD. I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER
ZONING IN PLACE THERE. I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNCIL AND THE
COMMUNITY CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK WITH THE
DEVELOPERS, PROPERTY OWNERS, AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY, TO CREATE
BETTER OUTCOMES. THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITY THERE. WE WORK CLOSE
TO TRANSIT AND CAN BECOME BETTER CONNECTED IF WE DO IT RIGHT. I
LOOK FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL TAKING THAT AND MAKING IT A VERY
SERIOUS EFFORT. THANK THE COUNCIL FOR THAT. AND FINALLY, ON PO
NUMBER 5. REGULARLY HAVING CLOSE CALLS WITH CAR, BUILD A SAFE
SPACE. IT IS NOT JUST BAD FOR CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS, IT IS BAD FOR
DRIVERS. IT IS NOT GOOD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. LINDA?
>> LINDA HAS NOT JOINED. MIKE, GO AHEAD?
>> HELLO. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. I'M HAVING AUDIO PROBLEMS. THIS
IS MIKE. MADISON AVENUE, NORTH CAMBRIDGE. HELLO. I'D LIKE TO THANK
COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI
FOR... IT IS EASY TO LOOK HOW MUCH IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT STATE
OF DEVELOPMENT IN ALEWIFE AND THINK ANYTHING IS BETTER. THE AREA
HAS COMPLEXITY THAT MAKE IT EASY TO DO THE WRONG THING. AND BE
STUCK WITH THE RESULTS PERMANENTLY. THE ALEWIFE AREA IS IDENTIFIED


PAGE 10

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

AS MOST CRITICAL AREA FOR CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY. THE
COUNCIL AGREED YEARS AGO THERE WAS A CRISIS THAT NEEDED ATTENTION
AND VOTED FOR A POLICY ORDER FOR THE CITY MANAGER TO FIX. THREE
YEARS AGO, THE CITY MANAGER HAD A TASK FORCE, AND THE FINAL
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE ARE STILL BEING DRAFTED FOR THE
LAST FEW MONTHS. MANY OTHER PLANS CREATED BY THE CITY THAT ARE
WAITING ACTION, ARE TOLD THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
IS TOO BUSY TO REVIEW PROJECT APPLICATIONS THEY CAN'T GET AROUND TO
FINISHING WORK ON THE PLANNING PROCESS. TOO MUCH WORK, HIRE
MORE PEOPLE. WE CONTINUE TO KEEP TABS ON THE DEVELOPMENT
PROJECTS THAT TRY TO MEET NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE OUR MORE
CITY SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT. WE HAVE TO CODIFY THE PLANS AND THIS
POLICY ORDER IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BALANCE THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS
HAPPENING SO WE CAN APPROVE THE ALEWIFE IMPROVEMENTS UNDER THE
DISTRICT PLAN. AND PUT PRESSURE TO ACT QUICKLY.
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON POLICY ORDER FIVE. BEEN A LOT OF
NEIGHBORHOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MASS AVENUE CHANGES TO BUS
AND BIKE LANES. THERE'S MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE AFFECT ON
BUSINESSES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. I SUPPORT GATHERING THE
INFORMATION AND THEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN THEN DISCUSS. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, KATHERINE BEATY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI, KATHERINE HAS NOT JOINED. BUT RUTH IS ON, IF WE
WANT TO TAKE HER?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. RUTH?
>> I'M HERE, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. IS KATHERINE ON? NO?
>> KATHERINE HAS NOT JOINED. NEXT PERSON GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I'M ON. HANG ON. JANIE. I WANTED TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM
FOR SO MANY OF THE COUNCILLORS HAVING SIGNED THIS BIKE SAFETY
PLEDGE AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF SAFER BICYCLING IN CAMBRIDGE. FIT
INTO MANY CATEGORIES. A 40 YEAR RESIDENT OF NORTH CAMBRIDGE,
CYCLIST, TRANSIT USER, DRIVER, WIFE, AND A PARENT OF OTHER CYCLISTS
AND TRANSIT USERS AND SOMETIMES DRIVERS. I'M A SENIOR. I AM A
SHOPPER WHO PATRONIZING EXCLUSIVELY LOCAL AND INDEPENDENT
BUSINESSES IN MY AREA. I'M CAR FREE. AND I'M I CALLED IN TO STRONGLY
SUPPORT OR STRONGLY URGE YOU TO NOT DELAY THE CITY'S
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROTECTED BIKE LANES ON NORTH MASS AVENUE,
SCHEDULED TO BE INSTALLED NOW. IT IS A LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE. I HAVE
HEARD OF SO MANY HIGH SCHOOL KIDS, MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS, THEY HAVE
HAD CLOSE CALLS OR BEEN HIT IN THIS AREA. AND IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE TO
DELAY THIS IMPLEMENTATION. IT WOULD BE HEARTBREAKING IF A CYCLIST
WERE TO HIT ON THIS STRETCH THIS WINTER BECAUSE OF THIS DELAY.
ONCE THEY ARE INSTALLED, I GUESS ALSO WE HAVE THIS CLIMATE


PAGE 11

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

CONFERENCE GOING ON NOW. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SOMETHING
TO ADDRESS OUR OWN THINGS WITHIN OUR OWN CONTROL. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT WE AS A CITY HAVE COMMITTED TO DOING AND WE NEED
TO DO ENABLE MODE SHIFT. SO, FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT
WHAT I THINK IS A FALSE DICHOTOMY THAT IS RAISED AS AN OBJECTION
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY. THAT'S TIME. FEEL FREE TO EMAIL US YOUR
TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, WE HAVE STEPHEN HELFER?
>> STEPHEN HAS NOT JOINED. LEE, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. PLEASE UNMUTE
YOURSELF. LEE FERRIS, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS UP NEXT. GIVE ME A SECOND. GIVE ME A
SECOND TO GET MY COMMENTS. OKAY. SO, I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT IN
SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER NUMBER FOUR. ON THE ALEWIFE DEVELOPMENT
MORATORIUM. AND FOR LAB AND OFFICE SPACE. AND MEMBERS OF THE
RESIDENTS ALINES WERE SUPER INVOLVED IN THE ENVISION PROBLEM FOR
ALEWIFE AND THE CITY. WE LIKE TO SEE THE ENVISION GOALS ENACTED INTO
ZONING AND WE THINK THE MORATORIUM SHOULD GIVE YOU THE TIME
THAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT. WE SUPPORT THE ENVISION ALEWIFE PLAN
THAT ENVISION THE ALEWIFE QUAD AS A MIXED USE DISTRICT WITH
DEVELOPMENT THAT PROMOTES THE CREATION OF GOOD PAYING, LOW
BARRIER TO ENTRY LIGHT INDUSTRY JOBS. ADDITIONAL HOUSING, A BRIDGE
OVER THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND SOME KIND OF POND OR WATER
RETENTION SYSTEM AND GREEN CORRIDOR. WE KNOW THE PLAN INCLUDED
NO LABS. THOSE LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY JOBS WILL HELP EXCUSE ME
HELP PRESERVE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY, WHICH IN TURN, IT WILL HELP
PRESERVE RACIAL DIVERSITY IN THE CITY. AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THE
TIME THAT WE WANT TO ZONE FOR WHAT WE WANT INSTEAD OF JUST
GETTING WHATEVER WE CAN FROM DEVELOPERS. WE SAW WITH CCF THAT
APPROACH DOESN'T WORK. LET'S TRY CREATING ZONING WITH THE
RESIDENTS THAT FOLLOWS THE PLAN LAID OUT BY ENVISION, WHICH HAD
VERY HIGH RESIDENT PARTICIPATION.
ALSO, I WILL SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM. AND I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL EITHER PASS THAT OR IDENTIFY
WHATEVER CHANGES THEY THINK NEED TO BE MADE AND SEND IT AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE STATE HOUSE FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED AS A
HOME RULE PETITION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ITAMAR TURNER TRAURING.
>> HELLO. I'M TALKING ABOUT POLICY ORDER FIVE. THE NORTH MASS
AVENUE LANES ARE GOING TO BE INSTALLED POSSIBLY EVEN TOMORROW,
THEY START TONIGHT. THEY HAVE MANY BENEFITS. BUSES, THE 77 LINES IS A
TOP 20 LINE FOR THE MBTA. IT IS USED BY 4,000 PEOPLE ON WEEKDAYS. AT
PEAK, IT WAS ALMOST 8,000, AND BUS USAGE HAS BEEN RECOVERING. IT
WILL PROBABLY HIT THAT. PEOPLE ON THE BUS WILL HAVE A FASTER RIDE,

ESPECIALLY DURING RUSH HOUR. IT WILL BE SAFER FOR PEOPLE RIDING
BIKES. PEOPLE ARE INJURED, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED ON MASS AVE. ALL
OF MASS AVENUE IS DANGEROUS WITHOUT PROTECTED BIKE LANES. BIKING
NEXT TO TRUCKS AND SAFER BIKE LANES MAKE IT SAFER. UNTIL THIS
PROJECT, THERE WERE NO ACCESSIBLE PARKING SPOTS AT ALL IN THIS AREA.
PART OF THE PROJECT, THE CITY WILL INSTALL ACCESSIBLE PARKING SPOTS
FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SO, THIS IS LEGALLY MANDATED BY THE
SAFETY ORDINANCE, BUT IT HAS BENEFITS FOR OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. IT IS
A CHANCE FOR TO REVISION THE STREET AND SEE HOW THINGS CAN BE DONE
BETTER. IS THE PLAN PERFECT? NO. NO PLAN IS PERFECT. WE CAN'T SPEND
YEARS DEBATING EVERY SINGLE PLAN UNTIL IT IS UTMOST PERFECTION
BECAUSE WE DON'T REACH PERFECTION. VERY EASY TO CHANGE, VERY
CHEAP TO CHANGE. WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN
PARALLEL, CAN SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO IMPROVE IT. I HOPE YOU WILL
AMEND THE ORDER FOR TODAY TO THAT EFFECT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER CASSA.
>> HI. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WANT TO I'M SORRY. I WANT TO ECHO THE
COMMENTS FROM ITAMAR AND OTHER SPEAKERS EMPHASIZING HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE PROTECTED BIKE LANES ON MASS AVENUE. YOU
CAN SEE ARLINGTON AND BOSTON, OUR NEIGHBORS, ARE BUILDING OUT A
PROTECTED NETWORK THAT WILL GO PASS BOSTON INTO BMC. WE'LL NEED
THE NETWORK AND ALL OF MASS AVENUE COVERED. TO GET THERE, IT
WON'T BE EASY. I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF COMPROMISES AND
CHANGES MADE ALONG THE WAY. WE NEED TO DO IT. AND THE CITY
TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT HAS HIRED THE CONTRACTOR, THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO START TONIGHT, AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND. WE DON'T WANT
TO DELAY THIS. WE SHOULD PUT THE LANES IN NOW AND FIGURE OUT IN
CONSULTATION WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHAT ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE
MADE. AS FAR AS THE POLICY ORDER GOES, I VERY MUCH SUPPORT FINDING
WAYS TO MAINTAIN THE TWO HOUR PARKING THAT IS THERE RIGHT NOW
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN THE LOADING ZONE SPACES INTO SOME OF
THAT.
TO ACCOMMODATE THE BUSINESSES AND I REALLY THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE
FORWARD ON THIS AND FIGURE IT OUT. WE ARE DIVIDING THE CITY EVERY
SINGLE TIME WE DELAY THESE THINGS. AND MAKING PEOPLE THINK THIS IS
THE THE ORDINANCE IS NOT A LAW THAT HAS TO BE DONE ON A TIMELINE.
IT IS. WE NEED TO BUILD THIS OUT. IT WILL TAKE COMPROMISES AND WE'LL
HAVE TO PUSH FORWARD. THE LONGER WE DELAY EVERY SINGLE ONE, IT
WILL SET A BAD EXAMPLE FOR THE REMAINING STRETCHES AND DIVIDE EVERY
NEIGHBORHOOD. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. LET'S PUSH FORWARD AND
MAKE BOLD CHANGES FOR CLIMATE, RESILIENCE, AND FOR MODE SHIFT.
THANKS FOR ATTENTION AND THANKS FOR THE WORK YOU DO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: REBECCA NEUMAN NEXT?
>> HELLO. HI. I LIVE AT 267 CONCORD AVENUE BY HIGHRISE. I WANT TO


PAGE 13

NOVEMBER 8, 2021

THANK ALL OF THE COUNCILLORS FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF CYCLING SAFETY.
AND TO THE CITY STAFF FOR ALL THE WORKING YOUR DOING TO ADHERE TO
THE NAN THAN AND ULTIMATE ORDINANCE AND MAKE THE STREETS SAFER.
I WILL REPEAT WHAT OTHERS SAID, I HONESTLY DON'T THINK IT CAN BE SAID
ENOUGH. THE SAFETY OF CYCLISTS IS URGENT AND AFFECTS PEOPLE OF
AGES. THERE ARE SO MANY OLDER PEOPLE THAT BIKE AND MANY WHO
WANT TO BIKE, BUT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T BECAUSE IT IS NOT SAFE.
I KNOW RECENTLY I SAW VICE MAYOR MALLON POSTED ON TWITTER, SHE
RECEIVED SIX EMAILS ABOUT CYCLING RELATED CRASHES IN THREE DAYS.
THOSE ARE JUST THINGS THAT ARE REPORTED. LAST MONTH, I GOT I
FOLLOW OFF MY BIKE WHILE BIKING ON APPLETON STREET. AS YOU KNOW,
IT IS MUCH LESS TRAVEL AND CHAOTIC THAN MASS AVENUE. I WAS RATTLED
AND LUCKY THERE WASN'T A CAR BEHIND ME. I DIDN'T REPORT THIS. TO
SHOW THERE'S A LOT OF CRASHES THAT ARE VERY SCARY THAT ARE
HAPPENING THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF. LIKE MANY SAID, I LIKE A LOT OF
THE IDEAS IN THE POLICY ORDER. I RECOMMEND AMENDING IT. I THINK WE
SHOULD INVESTIGATE TWO HOUR PARKING, MAKE SURE THERE ARE SPOTS
FOR THE HANDICAP, AND I THINK THAT CAN HAPPEN IN PARALLEL WITH
IMPLEMENTING THE PROTECTED BIKE LANES. I THINK ANY CHANGES THAT
WOULD NEED TO BE MADE TO ACCOMMODATE MORE PARKING WOULD BE
RELATIVELY CHEAP AND EASY TO DO AFTER THE BIKE LANES ARE IN PLACE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHICO?
>> HELLO. I LIVE AT FAIRWEATHER STREET. WE HAVE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE
ON MASS AVENUE AND THEY RELY ON AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORT TO
PATIENTS THERE. POST OPERATIVE AND MANY ARE ELDERLY AND ON
CRUTCHES AND BOOTS. HERE'S AN OFFICE THAT SEES A LOT 30 40 PATIENTS
A DAY. THEY RELY ON AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORT TO GET PATIENTS THERE.
AND FEEL THE POLITICAL PROCESS IS STACKED AGAINST THE LOCAL
BUSINESSES AS THE BIKE LOBBY IS HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND ORGANIZED AND
THE LOCAL BUSINESSES HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE POLITICAL
PROCESS AND MIDDLE EAST OF US WERE NOT CANVASSED ABOUT THIS, THE
PROPOSED CHANGES UNTIL AFTER THE CITY COUNCIL HAD VOTED ON IT.
I THINK OUR BUSINESSES AND LAND OWNERS IN THE AREA REALLY FELT LEFT
OUT OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, I'D LIKE TO VOICE MY
SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPING THE ALEWIFE AREA TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
POSSIBLE. I FEEL LIKE CAMBRIDGE IS REALLY BLESSED WITH THIS INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE
WHOLE PLANET, NOT JUST A SMALL BENEFIT FOR A TAX BASE OR OPEN SPACE
OR WHATEVER HERE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY PROVIDE THE
SPACE FOR OUR SCIENTISTS TO WORK AND DEVELOP DRUGS THAT BENEFIT
EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET, JUST LIKE MODERNA HAS SHOWCASED. THANKS
FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE PATRICK BARRETT?
>> THANK YOU. I WILL SPEAK FIRST ON THE POLICY ORDER 1. LOUIS

DEPASQUALE IS A FANTASTIC MANAGER AND A GREAT FRIEND TO CENTRAL
SQUARE. IT IS MY HOPE THIS IS THE FIRST DEDICATION TO HIM AND MAYBE A
PERMANENT STARLIGHT FACILITY IN HIS NAME. AND POLICY ORDER FOUR
AND FIVE, HAVE A COMMON THREAD. TALKING ABOUT FOUR, I THINK A
MORATORIUM IS NOT A TERRIBLE IDEA, BUT IT IS A STRANGE IDEA WHEN YOU
HAVEN'T APPROACHED THE CURRENT DEVELOPER AND OWNER OF THE
PROPERTY TO FIND OUT THE PLANS. AND I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THEY DON'T
WANT ANOTHER KENDALL SQUARE I THINK THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD
RECONSIDER THAT NOTION. KENDALL SQUARE IS A VEHICLE FOR ALL
WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE CITY AND BAD PLANNING IDEAS. KENDALL
SQUARE IS NOT A FUN PLACE TO GO AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. MAYBE WE
CAN TAKE THOSE THINGS WE DIDN'T IMPLEMENT IN KENDALL SQUARE AND
THINK ABOUT FOR ALEWIFE. THE ISSUES WITH THE BIKE LANES, THE SMALL
BUSINESSES, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF THE
DAMAGE CAUSED BY COVID. AND HOW ALL OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES, UP
AND DOWN, THEY BARELY SURVIVED. AND TO HAVE THIS COMPOUNDED
UPON THEM, A PLACE LIKE FAST PHIL'S, WHERE THEY CHILDREN GET THEIR
HAIRCUT, THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE CITY. I DON'T
THINK THEY REALLY GIVEN THE DEFERENCE THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN. DOES
THAT MEAN RIP UP THE BIKE LANE? OF COURSE NOT, THE BID IS NOT
OPERATING ON MASS AVENUE, WE ARE HAPPY TO HELP WITH THE OUTREACH
PORTION BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. AND I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING AMEN
TO WHAT PATRICK SAID ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES BEING THE LIFE BLOOD OF
THE CITY. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE SO
MANY OF THE POLICIES THAT WE SEEM TO PURSUE ARE HARMFUL. I'D LIKE
TO PROCEED TO A VERY QUICK THING. APPROVE THE STANDARDS NOW THAT
WE KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. AND I'M STILL NOT HAPPY THAT YOU
