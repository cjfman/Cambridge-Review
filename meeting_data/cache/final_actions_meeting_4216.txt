Overview

▪ Data show an increase in troubling activity (e.g., overdoses, assaults) in Central Square
▪ While an increase or change in residents who are unhoused has been brought up as a potential
driver, this does not tell the whole story; more analysis of underlying drivers is required
▪ The City and its partners (e.g., Cambridge BID, Baycove, Healthcare for the Homeless) are
responding to the increase in activity and ongoing needs of our unhoused residents in Central
Square in a myriad of ways, which will be summarized today
▪ While the current response is robust, even more work needs to be done, with more internal and
external coordination, likely incorporating a regional response given inherent cross-city
interdependencies
▪ Moving forward, we will evaluate recommendations from both the January 2022 Ad Hoc
Homelessness sub-committee and FY22 Substance Use Advisory Committee and come back to
this forum with a recommended path forward in early 2023

Attachment: Central Square Committee 2022.11.29 (COF 2022 #148 : A communication

CPD’s data-driven approach has led to increased patrols in Central Square

▪ Extensive visibility and data-driven work is being done
within our Operations and Criminal Investigations Units

▪ This approach helped identify need to hire additional officer
for late afternoon/evening shift 7 days a week to enhance
visibility in each Square’s high-activity locations
▪ High-impact patrols are also conducted during the day and
night shifts, 7 days a week, in areas that have seen an
increase in quality of life and disorder complaints.
̶ Undercover officers are also deployed in the Squares to
monitor and act on any criminal activity.
▪ Also develop intelligence on specific issues and
places and refer individuals in need for follow-up
▪ These high impact patrols supplement foot patrol officers
assigned to the Squares every shift (7 days a week) and
officers are assigned to both Central and Harvard Square
▪ Strategically using Community Court arrest and summons
process as a tool for people who are resistant to services
and involved in petty crime
