The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Toner who made a motion to close
Public Comment at approximately 2:43 p.m.
Deputy City Clerk Crane called the roll.
Councillor Burhan Azeem – Yes
Councillor Dennis J. Carlone – Yes
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon – Yes
Councillor Marc C. McGovern – Yes
Councillor Patricia Nolan – Absent
Councillor E. Denise Simmons – Absent
Councillor Paul Toner – Yes
Councillor Quinton Y. Zondervan – Yes
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui – Yes
Yes-7. Absent-2. Motion Passed.
Mayor Siddiqui recognized Owen O’Riordan, Deputy City Manager, who stated that the City
Manager is recommending that the City purchase 41 Bellis Circle via a “friendly” eminent
domain proceeding, CMA 2023 #220, which was provided in advance of the meeting and
included in the agenda packet. He stated that the City became aware of the property later this
year and began a conversation with the existing owner with a proposal to purchase the property
for municipal operations. He said that there has been discussion about what the nature of the
property will ultimately become. He noted the significant needs in the City in terms of affordable
housing but there is also an existing need for Public Works operations. He noted that there will
be discussions with the community regarding options for the space and then come back to the
City Council with what the community has indicated. He noted that regardless of whether the
City ultimately ends up using this property for affordable housing or DPW purposes, the City
believes that it can accommodate the storm water and sewer system controls in this space. City
Manager Huang added that the process after purchase would be to include all voices and have
more specific conversations. He said that he is committed to having conversations before major
decisions are made.
Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor McGovern who stated that address of the location being
listed as a Sherman Street address would make a lot of sense. He stated that the City should look
at the fact that this parcel is located next to a railway and research any potential issues that this
may bring about. He asked about the rapid timeframe of the negotiations. Mr. O’Riordan
explained that the seller wanted to ensure that the transaction was executed by the end of August
so that is the reason for the Special City Council meeting. Gayle Willett, Director of Assessing,
added that the non-market sale was never exposed to the market in 2023. She said that in her

Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, Cambridge, MA, offered comments as a Title Examiner
and urged the City to look at laws related to railroads and land owned by railroad companies,
specifically Chapter 40 Section 54A.

1

Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Toner who concurred with the comments by Councillor
McGovern. He stated that he feels that the City should purchase the property so that the City can
be in control of the process and ensure that residents play a role in helping the City determine
what that property will be used for. He said that one of the prime directives by the City Council
to the City administration is to buy any piece of property at what is a fair, reasonable market
price. He said that if a private developer gets hold of the property, it may not be affordable
housing or DPW operations but a large, residential property. He noted that the City will be far
more receptive in listening to the residents.
Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Azeem who echoed the comments of his colleagues. He
added that this is not the first location that he would look at for affordable housing. He stated that
there is also a shortage of space for DPW operations. He asked Mr. O’Riordan to talk about the
severe shortage and the properties that the City is losing. Mr. O’Riordan stated that at present,
the DPW has a permanent facility at 147 Hampshire Street which is 2.8 acres in size. It is in poor
shape and needs a lot of upgrades. He explained that over the last 5-6 years, they have shifted a
lot of their operations to spaces that the City has leased on Mooney Street, which is a short-term
lease which will expire May of 2024. The hope is that a portion of that lot will continue to be
used for DPW but that remains to be seen. There are other satellite spaces throughout the City
which will disappear within the next two years. Kathy Watkins, Commissioner, Department of
Public Works, added that DPW has over 270 employees, 9 divisions with over 150 pieces of
equipment. She said having long term homes is important so that the City can build the
infrastructure to support the various departments.
Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Zondervan who echoed the comments made by his
colleagues. He stated that he supports this purchase. He said that the City does not have the
luxury to debate how to use the space until it is purchased. He said that the biggest loser in this
situation is the Montessori School who did not think to contact the City in January to see if it
would be interested in purchasing the property.
Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor Carlone who stated that entry on Sherman Street makes
sense. He said that this is achievable. He said that he is optimistic, and he is in favor of purchase
of this property.
Mayor Siddiqui spoke about the timeline and asked how long the sale will take after this vote.
Mr. O’Riordan replied that the expectation is that the transaction will be completed by the end of
August 2023. In terms of community process, the City may want to have an architect work with
the City because it will take time to pull the pieces together. He expects that the process may not
begin until the new year. Mayor Siddiqui stated that communication is vital to the City Council
and the neighborhood.
The Chair, Mayor Siddiqui recognized Councillor McGovern who made a motion to
approve the Transfer Appropriation Order to Pro Tanto in the amount of $3,676,500.00.

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that the City of Atlanta, with
support of the Atlanta Police Foundation and private investors, has approved
the construction of an Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, dubbed “Cop
City”, on approximately 85 acres of deforested land in the Weelaunee Forest;
and

WHEREAS:

If built, the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center would be the largest police
training facility in the US nearby a predominantly Black residential town just
outside of Atlanta. The Center would hold shooting ranges, a helicopter pad,
and a “tactical village” meant to mimic an Atlanta neighborhood. It would
enhance the militarization of not just the Atlanta Police Department, but any
municipal, state or federal agency invited to train there. The military-inspired
style of training will assuredly make Black, disabled, poor, and other
marginalized communities more vulnerable to the violence of over policing;
and

WHEREAS:

In May, 2009 the Cambridge City Council declared a climate emergency and
we understand that the climate crisis is borderless. According to the Georgia
Forestry Commission, Atlanta forests remove about 19 million pounds of air
pollutants each year and the Weelaunee (South River) Forest is one of the last
unspoiled forested areas in the metro Atlanta area; and

WHEREAS:

The area that the Center is planned to be placed on was stolen from the
Muskogee Creek Nation by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, it had been used
for Indigenous burial and ceremonial sites. The land then housed a prison farm
where many Black people were incarcerated and enslaved for accusations of
violating Jim Crow laws. Building the Center would disturb this important land
once again and “continue its long history of racism”; and

WHEREAS:

Atlanta Police murdered Manuel “Tortuguita” Terán by shooting them 57 times
during a multi-agency raid of the Weelaunee Forest (also known as the South
River Forest). Autopsy reports show that Tortuguita had their hands raised
when they were killed and there is no evidence that they were armed.
Embedded in a long tradition of environmental activism, Tortuguita among
many others was camping in the Weelaunee forest in order to prevent
deforestation and construction. They were murdered over 4 months before the
Atlanta City Council had even approved public funds for the Center; and

WHEREAS:

In a survey written by lender Cadence Bank, the Atlanta Police Foundation’s

policing system that violates constitutional and human rights; and

Chicago, Baltimore, Tennessee, and Houston have already built or proposed

Weelaunee Forest and the building and implementation of the Atlanta Public

This policy order was passed without discussion as part of the balance of items being voted upon

me some concerns about some of the language that is contained in this policy order, and that is my reason
for filing Reconsideration. I thank you for your attention to this matter.

September 18, 2023
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am hereby recommending the appointment of Lauren Reznick, effective September 18, 2023, to the
Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) for a five-year term to begin immediately. Ms. Reznick fills
a vacancy left on the CRA by long-term CRA member and former City Clerk, Margaret Drury.
The City Manager’s office posted a request for applications on the city website from March 5, 2023,
through April 3, 2023. Extensive outreach was done through the City’s traditional outreach channels
such as the Daily Update email. More outreach efforts were made by the CRA through their website,
listserv and social media channels. A total of 20 applications were received. Applications were shared
with the City’s Director of Equity and Inclusion. Representatives from the CRA and City Manager’s
office reviewed applications to narrow the list down to four candidates for interviews. Those four
candidates with interview by the current CRA Chair, Kathy Born and myself.
Amongst an applicant pool with many compelling candidates, Ms. Reznick stood out because of her
passion for the City of Cambridge and its future as an inclusive and vibrant community and her subject
matter expertise in real estate law. It is clear that she will be committed to listening to and engaging with
fellow residents to inform the work of the CRA with a community-based perspective toward
development.
Ms. Reznick is a resident of Central Square and for the past 15 years has practiced as an attorney in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She brings diverse legal experience working in private practice and the
public court system. Ms. Reznick currently works for the Land Court in Boston and will bring to the CRA
a valuable legal perspective on issues pertaining to real estate and land use that are central to its activities
as a real estate entity working in the public interest.
I am confident Ms. Reznick will both contribute her own expertise and invite the perspective of other
Cambridge residents to the important issues before the CRA including the development of affordable
housing, stewardship of accessible commercial space, enhancement of public open space, and investments
in vital community infrastructure.

Packet Pg. 58

September 18, 2023
To the Honorable, the City Council:
Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for
FY2024. For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Taha
Jennings, dated September 8, 2023.
The CPA process included a virtual public hearings held on June 26, 2023 to solicit proposals and ideas
on CPA projects for FY2024 and July 28, 2023 to solicit recommendations on the percentage of CPA
funds allocated to each funding category (Affordable Housing, Historic Preservation, and Open Space).
The CPAC also received online submissions and emailed comments regarding potential CPA projects and
the allocation percentages. The CPAC, on September 7, 2023, voted unanimously for an allocation of
80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic Preservation projects and 10% for Open Space projects.
In accordance with the CPAC’s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a
total of $20,610,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2024 CPA surcharge, the FY2023 state match
funds received in FY2024 and a portion of the existing CPA Fund Balance.
For this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2024 will
total $13,000,000, added to an anticipated FY2023 state match of $3,000,000 and an additional
$4,600,000 from CPA Fund Balance. Additionally, $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance will go to the
City’s annual membership in the Community Preservation Coalition.
On September 7, 2023 the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these FY2024 funds. The
CPAC recommended to the City Council, through the City Manager, that the CPA funds be
allocated and appropriated as follows:
VOTE 1: Fiscal Year 2024 Local Funds ($13,000,000)
Vote 1A
80% of FY2024 CPA Local Fund revenues ($10,400,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and

Community Preservation Act: History & Overview

• Affordable Housing
• Historic Preservation
• Open Space

The Community Preservation Act (CPA) was created in 2000 by state law (G.L. c. 44B) to help cities and
towns preserve the character of their communities. In 2001, Cambridge residents voted to adopt the
CPA locally, which allowed the City to implement a 3% surcharge on Property Tax bills (with certain
residential exemptions) to fund affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space initiatives.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides matching funds in addition to those raised locally by the
surcharge. The percentage of the state match varies from year to year, depending on two factors: the
amount of fees paid at Registries of Deeds throughout the state, and the number of communities that
have adopted the CPA locally (thereby receiving a share of the state match). In 2019, state legislation
raised the registry fees that support the state match, increasing funds provided to Cambridge. While
registry fees have declined recently due to economic uncertainty, in the past, the legislature has
provided supplementary funding to ensure communities continue to receive a percentage of matching
funds. CPA revenues are maintained in a dedicated City account – the CPA Fund.
Each year, the City is required to spend at least 10% of its annual CPA revenues on each CPA category –
affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space. The remaining percentage can be used
towards any of the three funding categories. In July 2012, the state statute was amended to allow
greater flexibility in the use of CPA open space funds. Open space funds may also go toward active and
passive recreational uses such as parks, playgrounds, community gardens and athletic fields.
The CPA process is overseen by the Community Preservation Act Committee. The Committee is a ninemember public body, responsible for evaluating the City’s community preservation needs. The
Committee receives input from the public and city staff and makes funding recommendations to the City
Manager and City Council.

A percentage of the funds from each source is in turn dedicated to one of three CPA funding

least 10% of the CPA funds each year. Funds dedicated to Affordable Housing are transferred to the
Affordable Housing Trust, while funds dedicated to Historic Preservation and Open Space typically go
toward specific projects. A summary of the allocations and appropriations from each funding source,

In each fiscal year, CPA funds are appropriated and allocated from three distinct sources: (1) CPA Local
Funds generated by the 3% Property Tax bill surcharge; (2) State Match revenues generated by the
Commonwealth’s matching funds; and (3) the CPA Fund Balance, made up of monies in the CPA Fund
not appropriated in earlier fiscal years.

Affordable Housing
Funds dedicated to Affordable Housing initiatives are typically transferred to the Affordable Housing
Trust rather than being allocated to a particular project by the CPA Committee. The Trust leverages its
expertise to direct CPA funds to a variety of critical affordable housing initiatives throughout the City.

COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program

In June 2020, in recognition of the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CPA Committee
recommended $1,000,000 in one-time, direct funding for a new COVID-19 Housing Stabilization
Program. This short-term financial assistance program is administered jointly by the City Manager’s
Office through the Office of the Housing Liaison, the Department of Human Services Programs through
the Multi-Service Center, and the Community Development Department.
Maximizing Affordable Housing Support

CPA funds provide more than a one-time direct appropriation; CPA funds committed to affordable
housing have leveraged more than $500 million from other public and private sources in FY02-23.
CPA funds are a critical source of funding for the Affordable Housing Trust. In FY21, based upon a
commitment by the City Manager, the City doubled the amount of total City funding dedicated to
creating and preserving affordable housing from its FY19 funding, going from $13,626,000 to
$27,254,630 in two years, which was ahead of schedule. Although budgeted building permit revenues
decreased from a high of approximately $45 million in FY23, the City has maintained the same level of
support for affordable housing from building permits ($10,245,750). In addition, in FY24, $14.1 million
of general fund revenue will be used to provide funding to the Affordable Housing Trust. The FY24
budget also includes $300,000 in Short-Term Rental Community Impact Fees for the Affordable
Housing Trust. This totals $24,645,750 in the FY24 Budget to directly support the development and
preservation of affordable housing. These funds will supplement FY24 Community Preservation Act
(CPA) funds as well as federal funding. Through these combined sources, 80% of CPA funds allocated
to the Affordable Housing Trust in FY24, the City will provide over $41.1 million in direct financial
support for the Affordable Housing Trust in FY24, an increase of 6.3% (or $2.4 million) from FY23.

Preservation Grants
A large portion of CPA funding for historic preservation is distributed through the Historical
Commission’s Preservation Grants program. Grants are available in two categories: Affordable Housing
Preservation Grants and Institutional (Non-profit) Preservation Grants.
The Historical Commission has made preservation grants available to affordable housing agencies and
income-eligible homeowners since 1975, initially using Community Development Block Grants. After
CPA funds became available in 2003, the Commission began offering grants to non-profit owners of
significant buildings.
108 Affordable Housing Preservation Grants totaling $4.02 million have been awarded since FY03; 90
projects have been completed and 18 are cleared to proceed, under construction, or paid in part. 151
Institutional Preservation Grants totaling more than $8.0 million have been awarded to 75 different
non-profit organizations since FY05; 133 projects have been completed and 21 are cleared to proceed,
under construction, or paid in part.

The Historical Commission oversees historic preservation efforts in the City and works to preserve the
integrity of Cambridge’s varied historical resources. Preservation efforts have included restoring
significant buildings; conserving historic monuments and cemeteries, and landscapes; and digitizing
and preserving Cambridge-focused archival collections.

2.2.b

Cambridge has a variety of public open spaces, from its major natural resource areas such as the
Charles River, Alewife Brook, and Fresh Pond Reservation, to the neighborhood parks and playgrounds
embedded across the City. CPA funds have been used to increase the amount of open space – by
acquiring land or converting property – and to improve existing open space resources. Efforts have
included playground redevelopment and watershed protection.

Many open space improvements in Cambridge are realized through larger capital development. Open
space projects are therefore regularly funded through revenue sources other than CPA funds, including
Property Taxes, Water Service Charges, Free Cash, and Bond Proceeds. From FY2011 through FY2023,
open space projects received $104,453,250 in funding from non-CPA Fund sources.

Upcoming New Developments
The Affordable Housing Trust has also recently committed or is now reviewing requests for funding for
several new developments which have been proposed throughout the city, including:

Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) will create 46 new affordable rental units in the former
Sacred Heart school, rectory, and convent buildings at 49 Sixth Street in East Cambridge, while the
church and chapel will continue to be used by the Archdiocese. The Trust has committed $7,750,000 to
this development which is expected to begin construction next year.
1627 Massachusetts Avenue

Homeowners Rehab Inc. (HRI) purchased 1627 Mass. Ave from Lesley University in August 2022. Under
the AHO, HRI will preserve and convert the existing historic building into affordable housing, as well as
create a new additional building next to create a total of 29 new affordable rental units. The location of
the building is near the MBTA red line, Harvard Square, and other neighborhood amenities, making it
an ideal area for affordable housing. The Trust has committed $7,925,000 to HRI’s 1627 Mass. Ave
development.

6,582 square foot site located in Cambridgeport.
The property contains an existing vacant threefamily building which was most recently owned by
the late artist Peter Valentine, a well-known
member of the community. They will replace the
triple-decker with a new four-story building that is
compliant with the provisions of the AHO and
would be built to Passive House standards. The
Trust has committed $2,014,000 to JAS’s 37
Brookline Street project.

HomeBridge: Homebuyer Assistance Program
First-Time Homebuyers can access funds to help them purchase homes on the market. HomeBridge
offers income-eligible buyers up to 65% of the cost of buying a home on the market to make
homeownership more affordable while expanding the City’s stock of affordable homes. More than 120
buyers have purchased homes through HomeBridge and its predecessor programs, including six in the
past year.

CPA funds would support rehabilitation, including replacing damaged and deteriorated exterior wood
features at the front porch, soffit, siding, window shutters, cornice, brackets, and trim with appropriate
finishes to maintain the silhouettes and form. Any deterioration of the Mansard roof will be replaced
with appropriate materials. Original windows will undergo repair, if possible; otherwise windows will
be replaced by energy efficient windows that closely match dimensions of the two-over-two original
windows. Other non-historical elements of the house that will be removed include the existing exterior
metal fire escapes, the accessible ramp along the side of the house to the front porch, and the two
through wall window A/C units. The existing chimneys appear to be in good condition and will be
preserved with possible repointing and flashing as necessary.
Interior rehabilitation includes retaining details such as the historic, front doors, non-functioning
fireplaces, curved stair and railing, parquet floor, ceilings with crown moldings, and wood trim
including window and door surrounds and baseboards. Any window trim that cannot be salvaged with
the installation of the new windows will be replaced with trim closely matching the existing condition.

Legislative Records Preservation Processing

In FY23, using CPA funds, 132 cubic feet of permanent legislative records (86,834 documents), with
dates ranging from 1847 to 1974 were scanned, resulting in 461,024 scanned images. Average per box
scanning cost was approximately $1,100.
An estimated 400 additional cubic feet of permanent material remains to be processed at a basic level,
re-warehoused and scanned. The FY24 project would include funding for preservation actions,
including basic level processing, description, inventorying, light cleaning, removing staples, clips, etc.
and warehousing in appropriate archival quality containers. These actions will ensure preservation of
the City's permanent and historic legislative records and allow greater public access to the materials.
Preservation Grants

Faith Lutheran Church, 311 Broadway (1909)

A large portion of CPA funding for historic preservation is distributed through the Historical
Commission’s Preservation Grants program. Grants are available in three categories: Affordable
Housing Preservation Grants, Institutional (Non-profit) Preservation Grants, and, new in FY24, grants to
non-profit owners of significant buildings to address potential fire hazards.

Packet Pg. 87

Attachment: FY24 Project Recommendations Book (CMA 2023 #240 : FY24 CPA Recomendations)

The City Clerk requests funding to continue the preservation processing and scanning of permanent
and historic records in the office’s custody, including primarily legislative records and related indexes,
and to create an inventory to allow the materials to be more accessible to users.

Affordable Housing Preservation Grants
Income-eligible homeowners apply through an affordable housing agency for funds to restore or
replace original exterior features. Housing agencies may apply to restore multi-family properties.
Grants are generally part of a larger funding package involving overall housing rehabilitation. The
program offers eligible homeowners fully reimbursable grants up to $30,000 per project. Affordable
housing agencies are offered fully reimbursable grants up to $100,000. Grants to homeowners are
administered by two local non-profit organizations that operate Home Improvement Programs for
income-eligible homeowners.
Institutional Preservation Grants
Many non-profits, especially churches and community groups, own significant buildings in need of
restoration and/or rehabilitation. Organizations apply directly to the Historical Commission for
assistance with building envelope repairs, restoration, structural safety issues, and accessibility
projects where historic fabric is directly involved. The Institutional Preservation Grant program offers
every non-profit an initial fully reimbursable grant of up to $50,000 to help address immediate needs
from deferred maintenance. With a capital plan in place, organizations may apply for additional
matching grants of up to $100,000.
Fire Protection Grants.
The recent church fire on Broadway suggests that other significant buildings owned by non-profit
organizations (including approximately 30 churches that have already received Institutional
Preservation Grants) may exhibit similar vulnerabilities. The proposed new program would offer
outright grants of up to $25,000 to remedy potential fire hazards, risks, or deficiencies revealed in an
inspection by the Cambridge Fire Department’s Fire Protection Bureau or a certified fire protection
consultant. Funds could be used to upgrade existing detection and alarm systems, establish
connections to central station monitoring services, prepare plans for sprinkler system installation, and
support other actions needed to improve fire safety. If successful, this pilot program will be renewed in
future years.
Preservation Projects Administrator
The demand for CHC participation in CPA-funded projects has outstripped the Commission’s ability to
respond effectively. The Preservation Grants program now occupies about 20% of the Executive
Director’s time and 10% of the Assistant Director’s. This is manageable, but leaves no time to execute
other CPA-funded projects such as the replacement of older African American trail markers and the
composition, fabrication and installation of new markers. The Preservation Projects Administrator
would assume some responsibilities for execution of these programs in support of senior staff.

Sennott Park originated as Broadway Common in the earliest days of Cambridgeport. Portions also
served as a burial ground for Cambridgeport and East Cambridge until the city established the present
Cambridge Cemetery in 1854. Since 1865 Sennott Park has served as the largest public open space in
the neighborhood. The Community Development Department has requested the CHC to prepare a
historic site marker to complement the recent restoration of the park.
Stony Brook Gatehouse

The gatehouse atop the Stony Brook Dam in Waltham continues to perform essential functions as part
of Cambridge’s water supply system. The 1887 structure requires masonry restoration, a project made
more complicated by the general location and the difficulty of accessing the waterfront façade

Preservation processing of Newspapers, Assessors’ Records, Reference Collection
With prior CPA funding, the Cambridge Public Library has been able to preserve historically important
documents and make them freely available online to the public. Efforts have been successful as each
online collection receives impressive statistics on use. Currently, there are more than 30 collections
with 80,000 historic items, ranging from photographs to yearbooks to videos. The historic Cambridge
Newspaper Collection, has 8 titles, including the Cambridge Chronicle, nearly 1.8 million articles, and
over 250,000 views annually. Overall, over 300,000 pages from the collections are viewed each year.
The Library request additional funds to continue this important work in the following areas:
Newspapers: The Library requests funds to microfilm and process the Cambridge Chronicle from 2020
to the present as well as secure funding to update the collection through 2025. Additionally, funding
will support microfilming recently received copies of the Cambridge Tab and process the existing
microfilm, making the newspaper available online from 1983 to 2009, and some additional issues of
the Cambridge Tribune from the 19th Century that need to be processed. Adding these issues to the
newspaper database will strengthen the collection and allow users to explore new historic Cambridge
newspaper titles and issues.
Assessor’s Records: To date, the Library has conserved 40% of the collection or 148 volumes from
1864-1887. The Library is requesting more funding to offset the increased supply costs and additional
labor so that this project can be completed and the historic records can be made available to the
public. In addition, funds are requested to make the records readily available online for the use of
historians, genealogists, sociologists, economists, and others interested in researching Cambridge
property and neighborhood development.
Reference Collection: The Library has processed a
significant portion of the Archives and Special Collections
Reference Collection over the past decade, including
Cambridge City Directories, Cambridge Annual Reports, High
school yearbooks (both public and private), High School
publications, and School Committee Minutes (among other
material.) As with other collections, these online Reference
materials receive an enormous amount of use, having been
viewed over 200,000 times since the collection went live in
2013. The Library requests funds to continue to process the
Reference Collection to include Cambridge Annual Budgets,
School Department Reports, and Street Listings.
Additionally, the Library has a fantastic collection of
newsletters that document neighborhoods (i.e., 4Word:
News and Views in Area 4), projects (i.e., the Concord
Alewife Update), and historical topics (i.e., rent control) that
should also be made available. These resources are popular
with genealogists, those researching neighborhoods, and
historians.

improvements would also include new tree plantings. The project received $100,000 in CPA FY23

Rafferty Park is a community park in the Cambridge Highlands neighborhood. Located behind the
Sancta Maria Nursing Facility, the park also serves neighborhood users and area schools. Rafferty Park

in previous fiscal years, the City maintains two reserve accounts: the Historic Preservation Reserve and the Open
Space Reserve. These accounts include funds that were allocated and appropriated for spending on Historic

Operations/Case Management Software

1. Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will
collect Surveillance Data.
Community Safety will use an operations/case management software application, Reach
by Julota, to collect and store information about the services and interventions provided by the
CARE (Community Assistance, Engagement and Response) Team. For each encounter, the CARE
Team will collect and record basic demographic data, service needs identified by community
members, referrals made, and any follow up plans. Additionally, the CARE team will use Reach
by Julota for case management support to keep track of ongoing services provided and where
responders made referrals.
Reach is a cloud-based application hosted by Microsoft Azure, designed with a highly
customizable front end that is user friendly. It also includes out of the box standard reports along
with a data warehouse to provide quick and simple reporting necessary to track the success of the
program. The data set captured is basic demographics for tracking services. The data will not be
shared with third parties.
2. What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology?
The purpose of the Surveillance Technology is to provide a comprehensive continuum of
care for the community members served by CSD. The technology will assist the team in ensuring
we are following up on the requests for ongoing services and keeping track of any previous
assessments and interventions. Additionally, the technology will assist in assessing progress with
program goals and program evaluation. CSD intends to provide statistical anonymized data to the
City and the communities it serves on the effectiveness of our services and interventions. Reach
is designed to provide a custom reporting engine and many out of the box reports to simplify report
generation.

SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IMPACT REPORT

3. Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

Packet Pg. 119

This is a cloud-based service, hosted by Microsoft Azure, that will be accessible to the
CSD team on their laptops and phones. CSD team members will enter information after each call
to ensure timely and accurate representation of their encounters in the community. This technology
is targeted to be available November 2023.
4. What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?
Reach by Julota will provide up to date information to the team of CSD Clinicians and
Responders to ensure seamless care across various staff members. The data collected will be kept
confidential. This will ensure that our team does not unnecessarily repeat any assessment questions
or duplicate services. Community members will benefit from this information sharing within the
team.

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

Accountability

As a reminder, the Community Safety’s Steering Committee assisted in developing the follow mission
and values statements.
Mission Statement:
The Cambridge Community Safety Department’s CARE (Community Assistance, Response and
Engagement) Team provides an alternative approach to the criminal legal system through
compassionate and community-centered prevention and intervention efforts.
The Community Safety Department is guided by the following values:
1. We are continuously learning, evolving and reimagining our approach in order to best meet the
needs of the community we serve. Our department culture embraces a growth mindset and
values curiosity, humility and our shared humanity.
2. We commit to continue exploring restorative practices in order to build empathy, compassion
and help repair trust in the community in creative ways.
3. We center relationships, partnerships, authentic collaboration and joy in all of our work. We are
guided by the wisdom, insights and experiences of those who came before us and those who are
doing the work today to build solutions in community. We are intentionally laying groundwork
for the future we envision.
4. We are consciously not reproducing systems of oppression and aim to create equitable, antiracist and non-discriminatory ways of serving our community.
5. We acknowledge the historical implications of the criminal legal system and the harm it has
done to our communities. With this understanding, we value the dignity and humanity of all
people
Training plan
Starting the second week of September, our responders and clinicians will undergo 8 weeks of highly
specialized training before responding to calls in the community. Internally, our team spent the summer
thinking strategically about what information would be beneficial for our responders to learn. Together,
with input from behavioral health experts in the community, we put together a comprehensive list of
subjects ranging from technical training in CPR and sharps disposal to interpersonal development in
topics like conflict mediation and harm reduction. Our responders will also be equipped with knowledge
around issues of suicidality, gender violence, homelessness, and boundary setting, to name a few. In

Community Engagement

Together, with help from our Steering Committee, our staff worked with graphic designer Reagan
McCain to create a distinct and recognizable look for our CARE Team. For our logo, we landed on a
powder blue design, which is a color that's psychologically proven to reduce anxiety and stress while
elevating feelings of peace and trustworthiness. Our design includes a graphic of two people embracing,
which nonverbally communicates our values and lets people know what we’re about. Additionally, it’s
important for our responders to be easily identifiable in the community, especially in moments of crisis.
It’s not lost on us that our responders could face racial bias and unfair suspicion if they show up to a
wellness check, or an active scene, in plain clothes. With that said, we also understand and empathize
with the position that uniforms create barriers between people. With all that in mind, we landed on a
softer look, with t-shirts in visible colors that are fun, accessible, and soothing.

We’ve been privileged to have so many thoughtful and intelligent individuals serve as a part of our
Steering Committee over the past few months. They have been a tremendous resource to our
department and have helped to fill our various knowledge gaps. Going forward, we want to continue
learning from the community. That's why we'll be repurposing the Steering Committee as the
Community Safety Think Tank. This will provide an opportunity for neighborhood leaders, organizations,
and nonprofits to embrace a collaborative process around public safety in Cambridge. We'll organize
breakout groups, host guest speakers, and deliver updates on our work. Later this year, we will be
setting up an application process that's accessible to all residents –– including students!
Lastly, we’re launching a Community Safety newsletter starting this fall. Follow the link to join our
mailing list and stay up to date with everything CSD. We have also launched a basic webpage at

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Introduction
I can hardly believe it’s been a year since my first day! I’m incredibly grateful to the Mayor, Vice Mayor,
City Councilors, City leaders and staff, and so many in the community who I’ve gotten to work with over
the last twelve months. I have felt the weight and demands of this job, but I have also continued to have a
deep appreciation and respect for the role. I have worked hard to find consensus within the City Council,
to follow their direction, to balance the many voices in our diverse community, and to bring forward the
professional experience and expertise of City department leaders and staff.
One of my goals has been to bring greater transparency to our City and to help everyone understand what
we are working on and how decisions are made. I provided an initial 90-day update in December 2022
and a Spring update in April 2023. In this Fall update, I’m excited to highlight some of the major areas of
work over the last six months.
FY24 Budget
The City’s FY24 Budget was submitted in May, discussed across two and a half days of public hearings,
and adopted in June. I’m thankful to Councilors Nolan and Carlone for their leadership as co-chairs of the
Finance Committee and to David Kale, our Assistant City Manager of Finance who retired this past July
after a long career in public service. David guided me through my first budget cycle and, over the last
year, helped me understand the City’s complex financials. He has been a steady hand and has left the City
in a strong financial position and with the ability to continue to invest in our collective priorities.
Over the years, our budget document has become increasingly detailed and transparent, including dollars
spent across priority areas, key initiative descriptions, data and trends, and long-term capital plans. Our
FY24 budget reflects that continued practice and I encourage everyone who wants to better understand
the City to engage with this document.

2.5.a

1. Affordable housing continues to be one of our highest priorities. We have allocated $46
million in FY24, including $41 million into the Affordable Housing Trust. We have a lot more
work to do to address high housing costs and we are making unprecedented contributions, with
our annual financial commitment more than tripling over the last decade.
2. Supporting our unhoused community continues to be an important priority. The City has
allocated $16 million across homelessness and housing stability. In FY24, we added $2.8 million
in new funding to maintain our shelter capacity coming out of the pandemic. Providing support to
our unhoused while maintaining thriving city squares continues to be a focus across city
departments.
3. Universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) represents the largest new financial investment across
FY24 and FY25. The application and matching process for the City’s UPK program will begin
this year with classes beginning in Fall 2024 that would offer all four-year-olds and prioritized
three-year-olds high-quality pre-school programs.
4. We are facing a global climate crisis and Cambridge is rising to meet it. We have allocated
$18 million in FY24 toward reducing building emissions, vehicle electrification, and investments
in renewable energy with significant City ordinances and programs rolling out this year.
5. Finally, making our streets safer for all is a key priority for the City. We continue to invest in
our urban infrastructure to repair damaged roads, improve accessibility, address dangerous
intersections, and expand protected bike lanes.
This year, the City made adjustments to the budget process to increase transparency and engagement with
the Council. The City worked closely with the City Council Finance Committee Co-Chairs and held
several public hearings prior to budget submission. We also engaged in substantive discussions on the
budget and the City Council made formal requests for budget increases for affordable housing and for the
public health department. The City worked to meet these requests and built in additional funding in the
final adopted FY24 budget. I believe this collaborative approach is a good foundation for us to build on
and continue.
An area where we need to improve is developing greater community input into our budget process. We
already have a robust participatory budget program and I’m excited about expanding this as we enter our
tenth year. We will also explore ways to bring greater community engagement into the overall FY25
budget process and will look forward to sharing more.
Climate Change
Climate change is the fight of our generation. Warnings from scientists are only getting more dire and
2023 is likely to be the hottest year on record, driving extreme weather events both around the world and
very close to home. The transformation we need is not going to be easy and we are facing a massive
restructuring of our economy, energy production, and infrastructure.

Attachment: 2023 Fall Update 09-18-2023 (CMA 2023 #243 : CM Fall UPdate 2023)

The FY24 budget reflects the Council’s priorities, and we have made significant commitments across
these major areas:

The last five months have seen us grapple with climate action as a city. How do we set aggressive goals
and policies while mapping a realistic path that is achievable for our businesses and residents? How do
we act on a ten-year plan while recognizing that science and technology are rapidly evolving? And how
do we balance the difficult trade-offs that we will have to make as a community?
I’m proud of where we have landed together and this has been an incredibly productive City Council
term. We have adopted climate-resilient zoning that builds efficiency standards and protections against
future heat and flooding into our building codes. We have amended our Building Energy Use and
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) to include a 2035 net zero target for large commercial buildings that
Packet Pg. 134

2.5.a

The city also continues to build programs to support our residents and businesses through this transition,
especially with the new regulations we have passed. The City has launched Electrify Cambridge, a new
program that provides no-cost technical consultation to residents on clean and green home energy
upgrades such as heat pumps, solar panels, and induction stoves. We have continued to build out public
electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and even developed accommodations for EV charging across
sidewalks, recognizing the limited number of driveways in the city and the need for our sidewalks to
remain accessible. And we are developing new technical assistance programs that can provide support to
small business and property owners.
There is still so much work ahead of us and we are committed to doing this together as a community. This
is a global challenge but the local work that we are doing is a critical piece. There can be federal and state
policies and actions, but cities and towns are where we live and our decisions matter. I believe that the
real changes we are making will become a model for municipalities and I’m excited about the path and
work ahead.
Alewife Zoning
Alewife is the last large area of the city with opportunity for major planning and redevelopment.
Prompted by the rapid acquisition of 35 acres of land by Denver-based developer Healthpeak, the City
Council imposed a construction moratorium for new commercial development until new zoning was
adopted. The Council asked City staff to convene an Alewife Zoning Working Group to build off the
recommendations from the 2019 Alewife District Plan and provide zoning rules that would guide the
creation of a vibrant new neighborhood that enabled commercial development while also advancing the
City’s goals of housing production, economic vitality, and environmental resilience.
Over the last 18 months, city staff led an inclusive working group process that brought together the
diverse interests of residents, business community, institutions, property owners, and developers. I’m
excited to report that the process resulted in a shared vision for a mixed-use district that balances
economic growth with housing development and delivers significant infrastructure improvements. The
final zoning that was adopted 9-0 by the Council creates the framework for a multimodal, resilient, and
sustainable neighborhood with strong community amenities. The zoning incentivizes the construction of a
bike/pedestrian bridge over the railroad tracks and requires commercial development over a certain
threshold to contribute to our housing supply and fund infrastructure improvements. Estimated
development projections by 2040 would result in approximately 3,500 new housing units, including 700
affordable units.

Attachment: 2023 Fall Update 09-18-2023 (CMA 2023 #243 : CM Fall UPdate 2023)

represent the largest portion of our carbon footprint. And we are on track to participate in the state’s
Fossil Fuel Free pilot which would eliminate fossil fuel installations for new construction and major
renovations with limited exemptions. These ordinances were vigorously debated, and I have seen us bring
together diverse voices into the conversation, rely on our hard-working staff and expert opinions, and
make compromises and adjustments while staying true to our ambitious goals.

This process showcases the tremendous work we can accomplish when we come together as a
community, listen to differing opinions, and identify pathways to reach our shared goals and values. I’m
incredibly thankful to the members of the Alewife District Working Group who spent so much time
together over the last year to make this a reality, to the City Council for their leadership, city staff for their
expertise and guiding an inclusive and effective process, and to Healthpeak for their engagement and
vision for development that is collaborative and aligns with the community’s needs and desire.

Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Following the Planning Board’s public hearings on the Affordable Housing
Overlay (AHO) Zoning Petition (the “Petition”), staff from the Community
Development Department (CDD) and Law Department have reviewed the latest
version of the Petition and offer a revised version of the Petition text. These
revisions have the purpose of clarifying certain provisions and minimizing the
possibility of doubt or conflicting interpretations when applied.
Markups are shown in the version below, and annotations are provided to
explain specific changes.
In addition to these changes, staff suggest simplifying the provision in which the
normal height limits can be exceeded if a certain density standard is met.
Calculating the allowed density based on open space requirements could lead to
ambiguous or unintended interpretations, especially where open space
requirements are reduced or waived.
Also attached hereto for the Council’s consideration is the Planning Board’s
report on the Petition.

Amend Article 2.000 as follows:
AHO Lot – A Lot, as defined in this Article 2.000, on which an AHO Project is proposed, whether or not
there are other existing or proposed uses on the Lot that do not meet the definition of an AHO Project.
AHO Corridor Lot – An AHO Lot that has a Front Lot Line One or more Lots with frontage on one or more
of the following streets: Albany Street, Alewife Brook Parkway, Bishop Allen Drive, Broadway, Cambridge
Street, Concord Avenue, First Street, Fresh Pond Parkway, Massachusetts Avenue, Memorial Drive,
Mount Auburn Street, Prospect Street, and Sidney Street.
AHO Square District – One of the following Zoning Districts or areas: One or more Lots located entirely
within the confines of the Central Square Overlay District, Harvard Square Overlay District, Lesley Porter
Overlay District, or the area bounded by the centerline of Elm Street to the west, the
Somerville/Cambridge municipal boundary to the north, the centerline of Windsor Street to the east,
and Cambridge Street to the south; but not including the premises shown on Cambridge Assessor’s Map
#81 ML Lots 81-50, ML 81-101, or ML 81-100.

Amend Section 11.207 as follows:
11.207.5.1 General Provisions
(a) For the purposes of this Section, the phrase "District Development Standards" shall refer to
the development standards of the base zoning district as they may be modified by the
development standards of all overlay districts (with the exception of this Affordable Housing
Overlay) that are applicable to a lot.
(b) District Dimensional Standards shall include the most permissive standards allowable on a
lot, whether such standards are permitted as-of-right or allowable by special permit. A
District Dimensional Standard that is allowable by special permit shall include any
nondiscretionary requirements or limitations that would otherwise apply.
(c) An AHO Project that conforms to the following development standards shall not be subject
to other limitations that may be set forth in Article 5.000 or other Sections of this Zoning
Ordinance, except as otherwise stated in this Section.

Because many of the new provisions
refer to “lots,” it is helpful to specify
exactly what is meant by a lot on
which an AHO is proposed. There
can sometimes be ambiguity when
an AHO Project is proposed on a lot
that may have existing uses.
This also clarifies that an AHO
Corridor is defined based on the
characteristics of a lot while the
AHO Square functions more as a
district.

(d) An AHO Project containing more than one base zoning district shall follow the requirements
of the zoning district that covers the largest percentage of the area of the lot or
development parcel, as if the entirety of the lot was served by a single zoning district.
Section 3.32 shall generally not apply to development that proceeds under the provisions of
this Section 11.207.
(e) Where an AHO Project may have various applicable Building Height and Stories Above Grade
limitations as specified in 11.207.5.2.1, the most permissive height limitations shall generally
control. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Section 11.207.5.2.1, an AHO Project
may match the height of an existing building on an adjacent lot.

This paragraph is moved to the
section on height for clarity.

11.207.5.2.1 Building Height and Stories Above Grade. For an AHO Project, the standards set forth
below shall apply in place of any building height limitations set forth in the District Development
Standards.
(a) Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth a maximum residential building height of
forty (40) feet or less, an AHO Project shall contain no more than four (4) Stories Above
Grade and shall have a maximum height of forty-five (45) feet, as measured from existing
Grade. For AHO Projects containing active non-residential uses on the ground floor, the
maximum height may be increased to fifty (50) feet but the number of Stories Above Grade
shall not exceed four (4) stories.
(b) Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth a maximum residential building height of
more than forty (40) feet but not more than sixty-five (65) feet, an AHO Project shall contain
no more than nine (9) Stories Above Grade and shall have a maximum height of one
hundred (100) feet, as measured from existing Grade, except as further limited below.
(i)
Except where the AHO Project abuts a non-residential use, portions of an AHO
Project that are within thirty-five (35) feet of a lot whose District Dimensional
Standards allow a maximum residential building height of forty (40) feet or less shall
be limited by the provisions of Paragraph (a) above.
(c) The height of an AHO Project on an AHO Corridor Lot may be increased from the height
limits in Paragraphs (a) or (b) above, not to exceed twelve (12) Stories Above Grade and a
building height of one hundred and forty (140) feet, subject to the limitations in Section
11.207.5.2.1(b)(i) above.

The ordering of some paragraphs is
changed so that the allowed heights
increase sequentially, instead of
varying between taller and shorter
heights, helping to remove doubt
that the standards are intended to
be increasingly permissive.

height of more than sixty-five (65) feet, an AHO Project shall contain no more than thirteen

feet, as measured from existing Grade, except as further limited below.
(i)
Except where the AHO Project abuts a non-residential use, portions of an AHO
Project that are within thirty-five (35) feet of a district whose District Dimensional
Standards allow a maximum residential building height of forty (40) feet or less shall
be reduced to a minimum of five (5) Stories Above Grade or a maximum height of
sixty (60) feet, as measured from existing Grade, except that if the AHO project

Subject:

Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Amendments Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board makes the following report with no positive or
negative recommendation.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On August 8 and August 29, 2023, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to
discuss the AHO Amendments Zoning Petition (the “Petition”). City Councillors Marc
McGovern, Quinton Zondervan and Burhan Azeem presented the Petition at the hearing. Staff
from the City’s Community Development Department (CDD) also attended the hearing and
answered questions from the Board. Following a presentation by the Petitioners, and extensive
public comment, Board members posed a number of questions to the Petitioners and City staff,
and discussed the merits of the Petition. Following deliberation, the Board voted to forward a
report to the City Council summarizing the Board’s comments, without making a positive
or negative recommendation.
The following is a summary of the main comments made by Board members:
•

Board members agreed that building more affordable housing is a top policy priority for
the City. Envision Cambridge set a discrete goal for the number of new affordable
housing units to be produced by 2030, and the units produced through inclusionary
zoning and other means will not be sufficient to achieve that goal. Further, some Board
members noted that the affordable housing crisis deserves urgent action, and waiting for
area-specific planning to conclude could delay the City’s ability to solve the crisis in
sufficient time.

•

Board members offered a variety of solutions for addressing potential impacts from the
proposed heights under the Petition. Solutions could include new design requirements to
mitigate shadow and wind impacts; adding an additional community meeting for certain
types of AHO projects; and/or updating the AHO Design Guidelines to address the new
building scale that would be enabled by the Petition.

•

Some Board members expressed concern about the process, and noted that the original
AHO included a provision for annual reporting as well as a five-year “look back” to
determine the success of the original zoning. They felt that it would be better to wait for

the five-year review to determine if and what changes are needed. Conversely, some
Board members noted that the AHO was originally established with a competitive edge
over market-rate developments, and that competitive edge has eroded with further zoning
changes that are applicable to all new developments, such as the elimination of parking
minimums citywide.
•

Board members believe that the advisory design review process under the AHO is
effective, and that initial concerns about AHO projects have been addressed as design
development occurs. Board members noted that the original AHO eliminated the
Planning Board’s discretionary vote on certain projects, but was balanced by a reasonable
expectation on what could be built in certain parts of the city and what the impacts of
height and setbacks would be. Some were concerned that without careful study, that same
predictability is not as easy to surmise under the current Petition.

•

While some Board members were comfortable with the heights proposed established in
the Petition, other Board members were concerned that the heights may not be
appropriate in all of the areas proposed for rezoning and felt that additional study and
modeling should be done before arriving at specific dimensional requirements. Some
Board members also expressed concern about the proposed elimination of the side yard
setbacks, noting the negative impact this could have on adjacent properties.

•

Board members had differing opinions on the proposed heights as illustrated in the
following range of comments and as such were not able to reach consensus on either a
positive or negative recommendation. Comments included:
o Taller heights and density around transit nodes and corridors is an
environmentally friendly and sustainable development pattern.
o Taller heights may introduce additional impacts and compatibility challenges with
the smaller scale adjacent development in some areas of the City.
o It is difficult to determine what heights are needed and feasible for affordable
housing developers without supporting study and analysis.
o While the height increases appear significant, it may be unlikely that a large
number of development proposals advance at the maximum allowed heights due
to other limitations and constraints; such as funding, construction technology and
the cost of high-rise construction.

Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Mary Flynn, Chair.

WHEREAS:

To undo decades of racial discrimination and denial of homeownership opportunities
to Black and Brown residents, Cambridge must intentionally change its policies and
regulations to promote and create homeownership opportunities for disenfranchised
communities; and

WHEREAS:

The existing financing mechanisms for affordable housing development preferentially
generate income-restricted rental housing, which is also the greatest need, but further
limits homeownership opportunities for people who have been economically
disenfranchised; and

WHEREAS:

The current low-rise residential height and density limitations in our zoning code
perpetuate historically racist housing policies, but simply removing them would
produce additional luxury housing that remains largely unaffordable to economically
disenfranchised community members; and

WHEREAS:

The opportunity exists to conditionally allow for more height and density if a portion
of the additional units produced by private market rate developers are made available
for purchase through our income restricted affordable homeownership programs; and

WHEREAS:

Our existing affordable homeownership programs understandably include limited
equity provisions to maintain the limited supply of affordable units that is produced,
but permanently limiting the equity that affordable homeownership participants can
recover is a further perpetuating of historical and ongoing racist and economic
disenfranchisement; and

WHEREAS:

Utilizing the private market rate developers to produce additional affordable
homeownership units creates a potentially renewable supply of affordable
homeownership units, and hence could allow for less strict limited equity requirements
for our affordable homeownership units; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with relevant departments
including the Affordable Housing Trust, Community Development Department and

Notwithstanding other provisions in the zoning code, a developer may build as of right multi-family housing, up
to 3 stories tall (35’) or taller if allowed by the underlying base district, including standalone, attached, and
semi-attached structures, up to 9 total units per lot, with no limits on density, and no minimum lot size per unit,
but meeting the setback requirements of Section 11.207.5.2.3 “Yard Setbacks”, and the open space
requirements of Section 11.207.5.2.4 “Open Space” of the Affordable Housing Overlay, provided that the
developer make a portion of the units available to the city under a right of first refusal affordability covenant as
follows:

Prior to obtaining a building permit, the developer will confer with CDD to identify the affordable units to confirm
that the city is interested in purchasing them at cost plus a fee. The price shall be negotiated and agreed upon
prior to the issue of a building permit. The requirements of Section 11.203.3, “Standards for Providing
Affordable Dwelling Units Created through Inclusionary Housing”, shall apply to the affordable units.
The city will not agree to participate in any project involving the demolition of an existing structure, unless the
existing structure is not suitable for conversion to residential use, has been condemned, or is otherwise in a
state of disrepair so severe that demolition is the only option.
Upon completion of construction (certificate of occupancy obtained), the affordable units will be offered to the
city for purchase under an expiring limited equity affordability covenant. The city will have up to 60 days (with a
30 day extension if needed) to complete the purchase, either via the AHT, through a designated third party
(e.g. CHA, JAS, HRI, etc.), or through an income-restricted qualified home buyer(s).
The city will make every effort to make the units available for purchase to qualified first-generation home
buyers already living in Cambridge.
The city may purchase the unit and operate it as an affordable rental unit, managed by a third party of its
choosing. However, the preferred option will be to sell the unit to a qualified home buyer, via the affordable
homeownership resale pool.
If the city or its designee fails to complete the purchase within 90 days, the developer may choose to sell the
unit on the open market, however, 80% of the net proceeds above the cost plus fee pre-negotiated with the city
shall be contributed to the Affordable Housing Trust. Net proceeds shall not include any transaction fees or
other carrying costs associated with selling the property on the market.

If the unit is purchased by qualified home buyer(s), full market equity in the property shall vest at a rate of 5%
per year, so that after 20 years of continuous ownership by the same individual buyer(s) or their heirs, they will
have 100% full equity in the property. After 20 years, the unit may be sold on the open market by the owner(s).

22.30 - GREEN ROOFS
22.31 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to remove potential impediments to the development of
green roof systems on new and existing buildings by clarifying that such systems should not count
against a building's Gross Floor Area, and by providing for limited access and enjoyment of green roofs
by occupants of a building, and to require new buildings of substantial size to include vegetation and/or
solar energy roofing systems on much or most of the available roof area.
22.32 Green Roof Area as defined in Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance may be accessible by
means of a roof entrance.
22.33 Floor Area Exemptions for Green Roof Area.
22.33.1 Spaces meeting the definition of Green Roof Area, which are to be accessed only for
maintenance purposes and are not intended to be used by building occupants or others, shall be
exempt from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of a building.
22.33.2 Spaces meeting the definition of Green Roof Area, which are intended to be accessed for use
by occupants of the building or others, and which are located above the third floor of the building, may
be exempted from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of a building only after the granting of a special
permit by the Planning Board. The proponent seeking such a special permit must demonstrate that the
Green Roof Area is designed such that the vegetation will withstand the foot traffic associated with its
anticipated use. The Planning Board shall also consider the potential visual, noise and privacy impacts
of the anticipated use on neighbors. Unless such a special permit is granted, any Green Roof Area

In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty-Three
AN ORDINANCE
In amendment to the Ordinance entitled “Cambridge Municipal Code”
PASSED TO A SECOND READING ON AUGUST 7, 2023
AMENDED IN CITY COUNCIL ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2023
That the Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge be amended in Chapter 2.78
entitled “Historical Buildings and Landmarks” as follows:
2.78.140 Purpose.
The City Council finds it necessary to enact this article under Section 6 of the Home
Rule Amendment in order to preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of
the City; to improve the quality of its built environment through identification,
conservation and maintenance of neighborhoods, areas, sites and structures which
constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, political,
economic, racial, or social history of the City; to foster appropriate use and wider
public knowledge and appreciation of such neighborhoods, areas or structures; to
welcome a diverse set of residents and broaden appreciation for individuals with
marginalized identities who have shaped Cambridge’s history; and by furthering these
purposes in balance with other City priorities such as affordable housing construction,
environmental sustainability, and accessibility to promote the public welfare by
making the City a more attractive, desirable, affordable, diverse, equitable, accessible,
and inclusive place in which to live and work. To achieve these purposes, the City
may designate neighborhood conservation districts and landmarks to be administered
as set forth in this article.
2.78.160 Neighborhood conservation district commission—Established—Membership
requirements.
A. Upon designation as provided in Section 2.78.180 of this article of any
neighborhood conservation district, and unless the designation provides that the
Historical Commission itself shall exercise authority with respect thereto, the City
Manager shall appoint a neighborhood conservation district commission to consist of

have demonstrable knowledge and concern for improvement, conservation, and
enhancement of the district, and whose composition represents the diversity of the
designated neighborhood in terms of age, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual
orientation, and property ownership or tenancy. Appointments shall reflect the City’s
goals for anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Members and alternates must
have the ability to work and interact effectively with individuals and groups with a
variety of identities, cultures, backgrounds, and ideologies. The membership shall be
as follows:
Member 1. District homeowner
Member 2. District renter
Member 3. District resident
Member 4. District resident
Member 5. District business operator/owner or District resident

within the district. The City Manager shall prioritize applicants representing retail
establishments, local service establishments, or restaurants that employ no more than
50 full-time equivalent employees. The requirement to seat a district business
operator/owner shall not apply when a district does not contain any portion of a
commercial district or when the City Manager is unable to fill the seat after an
exhaustive search. Whenever the requirement does not apply, the seat shall be filled
by a district resident.

The position for a Cambridge resident with professional qualifications shall be
occupied by someone who possesses training or experience in historical preservation,
architecture, and/or a similar field. Three years after establishment of the district the
requirement that one member be a member or alternate of the Historical Commission
shall cease and a district resident shall be appointed to that position. Under no other
circumstance may an individual serve at once on both the Historical Commission and
a NCDC.
Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions shall act solely in the exercise of
those functions described in this article which are applicable to the district under its
administration.
B. Members shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diversity of
residents within and surrounding the district. Such members shall serve for a term of
three years, except that the initial appointments shall be for one member to serve one
year and one member to serve two years, and vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired term of office. No member shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
Each member and alternate may continue in office for up to six months after
expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly appointed and qualified. The
City Manager may further extend an appointment until such time as a qualified
successor is duly appointed.
C. Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and study committees shall
elect annually a Chair and Vice-Chair from their own number. In the case of absence,
inability to act, or unwillingness to act because of self-interest on the part of a
member, their place shall be taken by an alternate member designated by the Chair, if
available, otherwise by the Vice-Chair if available, otherwise by a majority vote of the
members and alternate members of the Commission present. The person exercising
the function of Executive Director of the Historical Commission or their designee,
shall serve as secretary of each neighborhood conservation district commission.
Persons serving as members or alternate members of a neighborhood conservation
district commission shall, as a result of such service, be considered as "special
municipal employees" for purposes of Chapter 268A of the General Laws.
2.78.170 Powers and duties.
A. The Historical Commission and each neighborhood conservation district
commission shall have like powers, functions and duties with respect to each
landmark and neighborhood conservation district over which it has jurisdiction as is
provided Historic District Commissions under clauses (a) through (g) under Section
10 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws with respect to historic districts, including

A. The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a
landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature
or object which it
determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or
events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social
history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or architecturally
significant (in terms of period, style, method of construction or association with a
famous architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures;
may recommend for designation as a neighborhood conservation district any area
within the City containing places and structures which it determines are of importance
to the architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of the
City, and which considered together cause such area to constitute a distinctive
neighborhood or to have a distinctive character in terms of its exterior features; and
may recommend amendments to any designation of landmark or neighborhood
conservation district theretofore made.
B. Prior to the recommendation of designation or amendment of designation of any
landmark or neighborhood conservation district an investigation and report on the
historical, architectural and other relevant significance thereof shall be made. The
report shall recommend the boundaries of any proposed landmark or neighborhood
conservation district and shall recommend for incorporation in the order of the City
Council designating each landmark or neighborhood conservation district general
and/or specific standards and appropriate criteria consistent with the purposes of this
article and the provisions of Section 2.78.190 of this article that are to be applied in
making any determination of the type referred to in Sections 2.78.170, 2.78.210 and
2.78.220 of this article, with respect to the designated landmark or within the
designated neighborhood conservation district.

district, and whose composition represents the diversity of the neighborhood itself in
terms of age, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and property
ownership or tenancy. Appointments shall reflect the City’s goals for antiracism,
diversity, equity, and inclusion. Members must have the ability to work and interact

process of designating a landmark or amending or rescinding any such designation
theretofore made. Any one hundred registered voters of the City may petition that the
Historical Commission initiate the process of designating a neighborhood
conservation district or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore
made. The Commission shall within sixty days following the filing of such request or
petition hold a preliminary hearing and arrange for the preparation of a report and, if
required, request the appointment of a study committee. In the event the Historical
Commission requests the
appointment of a study committee, the approval of the formation of such committee
shall be by order of the City Council. If a petition for a landmark designation is not
accepted by the Historical Commission or a request to initiate a study of a
neighborhood conservation district is not recommended by the Historical Commission
or approved by the City Council, the Historical Commission shall not reconsider a
proposed designation, amendment or rescission of designation within two years of its
previous hearing thereon. No later than sixty days after the transmittal of a report to
the Commission pertaining to a proposed designation, the Commission shall hold a
public hearing. The Commission shall give not less than fourteen days notice of such
public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and by
mailing notice thereof to the owner of the proposed landmark and to every registered
voter and property owner abutting the proposed landmark or within the proposed
neighborhood conservation district, each such voter and owner to be determined from
the then current records of the Assessing Department and Election Commission, and
to the City Manager, the Planning Board and the City Clerk.
E. Prior to the public hearing, the Commission shall transmit copies of the report to
the Planning Board for its consideration and recommendations.
F. The recommendation of the Historical Commission with regard to any designation,
amendment or rescission shall be transmitted to the City Manager and to the City
Clerk with a copy of the approved designation report. When making recommendations
pertaining to Neighborhood Conservation Districts only, the Historical Commission
shall include in their report information on the impact of the designation on housing
and renovation costs in the district. The Historical Commission shall obtain and
include a letter from each business association within, or within 500 yards of, the
proposed district setting out their views on the proposed district, or they shall
otherwise provide a statement that no response was received. The Historical
Commission shall include each written public comment that was properly received
during the Study Committee process. The Historical Commission shall provide a
review of current and available academic and industry research on the price effects of
historical preservation districting and shall provide a written summary of that research
and relevant citations as part of the report. Designation of a landmark or a

neighborhood conservation district or amendment or rescission of designation shall be
by order of the City Council. In the case of a designation, the order shall include a
statement of the reasons for such designation and a statement of standards which the
Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission is to apply
under Sections 2.78.170 and 2.78.190 through 2.78.220 of this article.
G. No designation, amendment or rescission of designation shall become effective
until a map setting forth the boundaries of the landmark or neighborhood conservation
district or change in the boundaries thereof, has been filed with the City Council and
has been recorded with the Registry of Deeds for the South District of Middlesex
County.
H. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district contains
provisions for both regulatory and educational/incentive programs, the regulatory
provisions of the order shall not be effective unless and until the educational/incentive
provisions of the order are funded.
I. Following acceptance of a landmark designation petition by the Historical
Commission, no application for a building permit for new construction or alterations
on the premises of a property being considered for landmark designation shall be
granted until reviewed by the Commission as though the property were designated as
a landmark under this Article III. Beginning with the acceptance of a designation
petition or a vote to initiate a landmark designation study and until (a) the Historical
Commission makes a negative recommendation on a proposed designation, (b) the
City Council determines not to enact the proposed designation, or (c) one year has
elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission shall review all proposed construction,
demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other than
color, of the structures on the premises of a proposed landmark. The Commission
shall have no jurisdiction over issuance of building permits in a neighborhood
conservation district study area except in the case of properties that are already
designated as landmarks or protected by a preservation restriction or with regard to
applications to demolish buildings pursuant to Ch. 2.78.Article II.
J. Notwithstanding the prior provisions of this section 2.78.180, a neighborhood
conservation
district previously established by order of the City Council, in accordance with this
section, which order instructs that there be a review of the activities of the
neighborhood conservation district commission established pursuant to that order,
following one or more public hearings by such neighborhood conservation district
commission and by the Historical Commission, and a report to the City Council by
such commissions containing a summary of testimony at such hearings and

recommendations by such commissions for amendments to the powers,
responsibilities and procedures of such neighborhood conservation district
commission (including amendments to the boundaries of the affected neighborhood
conservation district), may be amended by the City Council, in a manner consistent
with the recommendations of such report, or be rescinded without the necessity of the
appointment of a new study committee or of a de novo study process.
2.78.190 Review procedures.
A. Except as the order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood
conservation district may otherwise provide in accordance with this article, the
Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission having
jurisdiction shall review all construction, demolition or alteration that affects the
exterior architectural features, other than color, ADA compliance features,
accessibility features, climate resiliency features, or renewable energy features of any
landmark or within any neighborhood conservation district.
B. The order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation
district may provide that the authority of the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall not extend to the review of
one or more of the following categories of structures or exterior architectural features
of the landmark or within the neighborhood conservation district in which event the
structures or exterior architectural features so excluded may be constructed or altered
without review by the Commission:
1. The application of exterior wall material in a manner that does not require the
removal or enclosure of any cornice, fascia, soffit, bay, porch, hood, window or door
casing, or any other protruding decorative element;
2. Alterations to the exterior of existing structures that do not increase or diminish the
size and location of windows and doors, cause the removal of any bay, porch, hood,
window or door casing or any other protruding decorative element, or alter the
appearance of a roof;
3. The exterior appearance of a new structure that does not require a variance or
special permit under the zoning ordinance then in effect;
4. Signs, temporary structures, lawn statuary, or recreational equipment, subject to
such conditions as to duration of use, dimension, location, lighting, removal and
similar matters as the Commission may reasonably specify;

5. Terraces, walks, driveways, sidewalks and similar structures substantially at grade
level;
6. Walls and fences;
7. Storm doors and windows, screens, window air conditioners, lighting fixtures,
antennae, trellis work and similar appurtenances.
C. The Historical Commission or a neighborhood conservation district commission
may determine from time to time after a public hearing that certain categories of
exterior architectural features or structures, including, without limitation, any of those
enumerated in this section, if the provisions of the applicable order do not limit the
authority of such commission with respect thereto, may be constructed or altered
without review by such commission without causing substantial derogation from the
intent and purposes of this article.
D. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district
provides, the determination of a neighborhood conservation district commission shall
be binding only with regard to applications to construct a new building, to demolish
an existing structure if a demolition permit is required, to construct a parking lot as a
principal use, and to construct an addition to an existing structure that would increase
its gross floor area, and in all other cases the determinations of a commission shall be
advisory only and not binding on an applicant. In no case shall a building permit be
issued until the commission has made a determination under the applicable provisions
of this article.
E. A determination of the Historical Commission with regard to an application to
construct a residential building in which a majority of the units are permanently
reserved for households at or below 100% of area median income through the
Affordable Housing Overlay or any other means on the premises of a designated
landmark shall be advisory only and not binding on the applicant.
F. Applications for temporary accessibility features shall be granted Temporary
Certificates of Hardship for the length of the ownership or tenancy of the disabled
applicant. Such certificates shall be issued through administrative procedures within
one business day. A determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission with regard to an application to construct permanent accessibility
features shall be advisory only and not binding on the applicant. A determination of
the Historical Commission with regard to an application to construct such permanent
features on the premises of a designated landmark shall be binding, but the
Commission shall not in any case deny all accessibility improvements necessary to

comply with provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and relevant
Massachusetts statutes.
G. A determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard
to an application to construct climate resiliency and renewable energy features shall
be advisory only and not binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical
Commission with regard to an application to construct such features on the premises
of a designated landmark shall be binding but not unreasonably denied.
2.78.210 Certificates of appropriateness, non-applicability or hardship.
A. Except as the order establishing or amending a landmark or neighborhood
conservation district may otherwise provide, no structure designated a landmark or
within a neighborhood conservation district shall be constructed or altered in any way
that affects exterior architectural features unless the Historical Commission or
neighborhood conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall first have
issued a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate
of hardship with respect to such construction or alteration.
B. Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the Historical Commission or
neighborhood conservation district commission shall file with the Commission an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a
certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as the commission may
reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations, specifications, material
and other information, including in the case of demolition or removal a statement of
the proposed condition and appearance of the property thereafter, as may be
reasonably deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a determination
on the application.
C. No building permit for alteration of an exterior architectural feature of a landmark
or construction of a structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature
within a neighborhood conservation district and no demolition permit for demolition
or removal of a landmark or of a structure within a neighborhood conservation district
shall be issued by the City or any department thereof until the certificate required by
this article has been issued by the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission having jurisdiction.
D. This provision does not apply to proposals for, or existing, affordable housing that
either is developed under the Affordable Housing Overlay, as defined in Section
11.207 of the Zoning Ordinance, or has a majority of units permanently reserved for
households at or below 100% of Area Median Income, in a neighborhood
conservation district, over which no neighborhood conservation district commission

has jurisdiction. The Historical Commission shall have only advisory jurisdiction with
regard to such affordable housing.
2.78.220 Factors considered by Commissions.
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new
construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the
size and shape of the structure, and a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to
those required by applicable provision of the zoning ordinance. A Commission shall
not consider interior arrangements or architectural features not subject to public view.
B. A Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not make any
recommendation or requirement except for the purpose of preventing proposals
incongruous to the historic aspects, architectural significance or the distinctive
character of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.
C. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall also consider community goals as may from
time to time be expressed by the City Council, including the need to provide
additional housing, affordable and otherwise, and to promote the sustainable use of
energy and capacity for climate resilience.
2.78.270 Enforcement and remedies.
The Historical Commission and any neighborhood conservation district commission
are each specifically authorized to institute any and all actions, proceedings in law and
in equity, as it deems necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the
requirements of this article or to prevent a threatened violation thereof. Any violation
of any provision of this article may be punished to the like extent provided in Section
13 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws for a violation of said Chapter 40C. In
addition to the foregoing, no building permit shall be issued, with respect to any
premises upon which a landmark or a structure within any neighborhood conservation

Policy Order #1 06.26.2023

Policy Order #1 06.26.2023 requests “… an explanation of the legal standard that is used to compel changes or deny projects reviewed by the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions.”
The basic historic preservation law in Massachusetts is the Historic Districts Act, M.G.L. Ch.
40C, which was adopted in 1960 to enable municipalities to establish historic districts within
which the issuance of building permits for publicly visible exterior construction or alterations is
regulated by local historic district commissions. Historic preservation laws have been upheld as
permissible under the inherent authority of the state to regulate, protect, and promote public
health, safety, morals, or general welfare.
The intent of the Historic Districts Act is described in Section 2:
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the educational, cultural, economic and
general welfare of the public through the preservation and protection of the distinctive characteristics of buildings and places significant in the history of the commonwealth and its cities and towns or their architecture, and through the maintenance and improvement of settings for such buildings and places and the encouragement of design compatible therewith.

Section 6 of Ch. 40C establishes regulatory procedures for historic districts:
Except as the ordinance or by-law may otherwise provide in accordance with section eight or said section eight or nine, no building or structure within an historic
district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects exterior architectural
features unless the commission shall first have issued a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship with respect to
such construction or alteration.

Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the commission shall file with
the commission an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of
non-applicability or a certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as
the commission may reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations,
specifications, material and other information, including in the case of demolition
or removal a statement of the proposed condition and appearance of the property
thereafter, as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the commission to enable
it to make a determination on the application.
No building permit for construction of a building or structure or for alteration of an
exterior architectural feature within an historic district and no demolition permit for
demolition or removal of a building or structure within an historic district shall be
issued by a city or town or any department thereof until the certificate required by
this section has been issued by the commission.

Section 7 specifies the criteria historic district commissions are to employ in evaluating applications for certificates of appropriateness:
In passing upon matters before it the commission shall consider, among other
things, the historic and architectural value and significance of the site, building or
structure, the general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the features involved, and the relation of such features to similar features of buildings and
structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new construction or additions to
existing buildings or structures the commission shall consider the appropriateness
of the size and shape of the building or structure both in relation to the land area
upon which the building or structure is situated and to buildings and structures in
the vicinity, and the commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and
set-back requirements in addition to those required by applicable ordinance or bylaw. When ruling on applications for certificates of appropriateness for solar energy
systems, as defined in section one A of chapter forty A, the commission shall also
consider the policy of the commonwealth to encourage the use of solar energy
systems and to protect solar access. The commission shall not consider interior
arrangements or architectural features not subject to public view.
The commission shall not make any recommendation or requirement except for
the purpose of preventing developments incongruous to the historic aspects or
the architectural characteristics of the surroundings and of the historic district.

The City Council established the Cambridge Historical Commission in 1963 as both an historic
district commission under M.G.L. Ch. 40C and an historical commission under M.G.L. Ch. 40,
Section 8D. The Council designated four historic districts (consolidated into the Old Cambridge
Historic District in 1976) and assigned the commission several additional duties, including historical research and publications, establishment of additional districts, providing advice to other
city boards and departments, and preparation of nominations to the National Register of Historic
Places.
Twenty years later, the City Council enacted Ch. 2.78, Article III of the Cambridge Municipal
Code to enable the Historical Commission to initiate studies for designation of neighborhood
conservation districts and individual buildings as landmarks.
Section 2.78.140 states the purpose of the neighborhood conservation district and landmarks ordinance:

The City Council finds it necessary to enact this article under Section 6 of the
Home Rule Amendment in order to preserve, conserve and protect the beauty
and heritage of the City and to improve the quality of its environment through
identification, conservation and maintenance of neighborhoods, areas, sites and
structures which constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City; to resist and restrain environmental influences adverse to this purpose; to foster appropriate use and
wider public knowledge and appreciation of such neighborhoods, areas or structures; and by furthering these purposes to promote the public welfare by making
the City a more attractive and desirable place in which to live and work. To
achieve these purposes, the City may designate neighborhood conservation districts and landmarks to be administered as set forth in this article.

For administrative convenience, Article III incorporated by reference several sections of the Historic Districts Act, M.G.L. Ch. 40C. Section 2.78.170 enumerates these:
The Historical Commission and each neighborhood conservation district commission shall have like powers, functions and duties with respect to each landmark
and neighborhood conservation district over which it has jurisdiction as is provided Historic District Commissions under clauses (a) through (g) under Section 10
of Chapter 40C of the General Laws with respect to historic districts, including
without limitation with respect to the approval and disapproval of certificates of
appropriateness, nonapplicability and hardship, the dating and signing of such
certificates, the keeping of records and adoption of rules and regulations, the filing
with the City Clerk and Building Department of certificates and determinations of
disapproval by it, and the determination of designs of appurtenances (excluding
colors) which will meet the requirements of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

Section 2.78.220 of the Cambridge Municipal Code describes the criteria and factors to be considered by commissions when evaluating applications for certificates of appropriateness in
neighborhood conservation districts and landmarks:
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic
and architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of
such features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case
of new construction or additions to existing structures a commission shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both in relation
to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in the vicinity, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the
zoning ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural features not subject to public view.

B. A Commission shall not make any recommendation or requirement except for
the purpose of preventing developments incongruous to the historic aspects, architectural significance or the distinctive character of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

The Historical Commission (in its administration of the Harvard Square Conservation District,
historic districts, and designated landmarks) and the three neighborhood conservation district
commissions have issued thousands of Certificates of Appropriateness since the adoption of Ch.
2.78, Article III in 1983. While many determinations have involved negotiation and an amendment of proposed projects, outright denials are rare. No major new construction project has ever
been fully blocked under the authority of this Article, but some have been modified to receive
approval.
•

The Cambridge Historical Commission has received 5,069 applications for properties under its jurisdiction over a 60-year period. Forty-five (0.89%) were denied. Twenty-one of
the denials involved landmarks or properties in the Harvard Square Conservation District;
two of these were major construction projects that were subsequently approved in a different form. All other denials involved additions, minor alterations, signs, cell phone antennas. and the like.

•

The Mid Cambridge NCD Commission has processed 6,693 applications since 1985. The
Commission has recorded denials of 101 applications over 37 years, but 92 of these were
non-binding decisions involving siding or inappropriate window replacement and the applicants were able to proceed as they wished at the conclusion of the review. The nine
binding applications that were denied involved properties listed on the National Register.
Eight denied applications were for alterations and one was for demolition and replacement with a new building.

•

The Avon Hill NCD Commission has processed 800 applications since 1999. Seven applications (0.88%) have been denied. Two of these cases involved garages and five inappropriate window replacement.

•

The Half Crown-Marsh NCD Commission has received 589 applications since 2007.
Eleven (1.9%) have been denied; three of these were modified and subsequently approved. Six denied cases involved fences.

Spreadsheets documenting denied applications are available on request.
Finally, applicants aggrieved by a finding of an NCD commission may appeal to the Cambridge
Historical Commission. Cambridge Historical Commission decisions can be appealed to the Superior Court.

Re:

Response to Proposed Amendments to Ch. 2.78, Art. III [Updated 8.7.23]

On August 7, the City Council will consider a number of proposed amendments to Ch. 2.78, Art
III of the Cambridge Municipal Code, the Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCD) and
Landmarks Ordinance. Council Order O-1 of 6/26/23 requests a review of the proposed
amended ordinance language.
The amendments originated with a citizens’ petition filed in May, 2021 that was refiled in
somewhat amended form at the beginning of the present Council term. I have submitted several
memos analyzing the petition, some provisions of which were opposed by the Historical
Commission, and proposed amendments intended to make the NCD and landmark designation
process more efficient and effective.
Law Department and CHC staff attended several Ordinance Committee hearings and CHC staff
have participated in informal sessions of stakeholders convened by Councillors McGovern and
Zondervan. The outcome of those discussions is reflected in a document prepared by the City
Clerk titled “Attachment D Final Clean Version of 2.78 for August 7”.
With two exceptions, the amendments contained in Attachment D are acceptable to the
Commission. These both appear in Section 2.78.220, “Factors considered by Commissions.”
Section 2.78.220, paragraph A describes the factors to be considered by the Historical
Commission and NCD commissions in evaluating requests for certificates of appropriateness. It
also authorizes commissions to make determinations about dimensions and setbacks that may be
more restrictive than permitted by zoning. The paragraph in its entirety presently reads as
follows:
In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic
and architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general

design, arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the
relation of such features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area.
In the case of new construction or additions to existing structures a commission
shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both in
relation to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in
the vicinity, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional
and setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision
of the zoning ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements
or architectural features not subject to public view.
The proposed language contains two amendments objectionable to the Historical Commission.
The proposed amended version of this paragraph reads as follows:
In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or neighborhood
conservation district commission shall consider, among other things, the historic
and architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of
such features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case
of new construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the
size and shape of the structure, and a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to
those required by applicable provision of the zoning ordinance. A Commission
shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural features not subject to
public view (emphasis added).
The first amendment to this paragraph would prohibit commissions from considering “the
appropriateness of the size and shape of additions and new buildings.” The ability of
commissions to consider such features is fundamental to their mission. A commission
prohibited from reviewing the size and shape of new construction cannot adequately protect
properties that the City Council has designated under this ordinance.
The second amendment would eliminate a commission’s ability to “impose dimensional and
setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance.” This provision of the Ordinance tracks a similar provision of M.G.L. Ch. 40C, the
Historic Districts Act. Although rarely used, it is an important regulatory tool and its loss
would weaken commissions’ ability to negotiate appropriate outcomes.
In addition, the Law Department recommends against adoption of the following underlined
amendment to Section 2.78.160, paragraph B:
Members shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diversity of
residents within and surrounding the district. Such members shall serve for a term
of three years, except that the initial appointments shall be for one member to
serve one year and one member to serve two years, and vacancies shall be filled
for the unexpired term of office. No member shall serve more than two
consecutive terms. Each member and alternate may continue in office for up to six
months after expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly appointed and
qualified. The City Manager may extend an appointment by another six months if
no such duly appointed and qualified successor has been appointed at the point of

expiration, provided the City Council votes to approve the extension (emphasis
added).
The Law Department comments that this provision may result in a situation where there are not
enough members to vote on an application. Normally, after a member's term expires a member is
in holdover status which is a legal status that allows the member to continue to take action until a
new member is appointed. This provision eliminates the possibility that members can serve in
holdover status and could result in vacant positions. If there are not enough members to vote on
an application, an application can be constructively approved by operation of law, pursuant to the
procedures in G.L. c.40C, §11, that are incorporated into Chapter 2.78. The Law Department
recommends removing this language to avoid that possibility. The following existing provision
of the Ordinance should remain in place:
Each member and alternate shall continue in office after expiration of his or her
term until a successor is duly appointed and qualified, except that no member
shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
The attached document contains several redlined editorial revisions that I do not consider
controversial and restores in part the original language of Section 2.78.160, paragraph B, and
Section 2.78.220, paragraph A.
The text has been reviewed by the Law Department, which considers that the amendments before
the Council constitute issues of policy rather than law.

2.78.140 Purpose.
The City Council finds it necessary to enact this article under Section 6 of the Home Rule
Amendment in order to preserve, conserve and protect the beauty and heritage of the City; to
improve the quality of its built environment through identification, conservation and
maintenance of neighborhoods, areas, sites and structures which constitute or reflect distinctive
features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic, racial, or social history of the City; to
foster appropriate use and wider public knowledge and appreciation of such neighborhoods,
areas or structures; to welcome a diverse set of residents and broaden appreciation for individuals
with marginalized identities who have shaped Cambridge’s history; and by furthering these
purposes in balance with other City priorities such as affordable housing construction,
environmental sustainability, and accessibility to promote the public welfare by making the City
a more attractive, desirable, affordable, diverse, equitable, accessible, and inclusive place in
which to live and work. To achieve these purposes, the City may designate neighborhood
conservation districts and landmarks to be administered as set forth in this article.

2.78.160 Neighborhood conservation district commission—Established—
Membership requirements.
A.

Upon designation as provided in Section 2.78.180 of this article of any neighborhood
conservation district, and unless the designation provides that the Historical
Commission itself shall exercise authority with respect thereto, the City Manager
shall appoint a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission to consist of seven
members and three alternates who shall by reason of experience or education have
demonstrable knowledge and concern for improvement, conservation, and
enhancement of the district, and whose composition represents the diversity of the
designated neighborhood in terms of age, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual
orientation, and property ownership or tenancy. Appointments shall reflect the City’s
goals for anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Members and alternates must
have the ability to work and interact effectively with individuals and groups with a
variety of identities, cultures, backgrounds, and ideologies. The membership shall be
as follows:
Member 1. District homeowner
Member 2. District renter
Member 3. District resident
Member 4. District resident
Member 5. District business operator/owner or District resident
Member 6. Historical Commission member/CHC alternate or Cambridge
resident

Member 7. Cambridge resident with professional qualifications
Alternate 1. District resident
Alternate 2. District resident
Alternate 3. District resident
The district business operator/owner seat shall be occupied by someone who owns or
operates a business within the district that is not a formula business as defined in
Article 2.000 of the Zoning Ordinance, or a representative of a business association
within the district. The City Manager shall prioritize applicants representing retail
establishments, local service establishments, or restaurants that employ no more than
50 full-time equivalent employees. The requirement to seat a district business
operator/owner shall not apply when a district does not contain any portion of a
commercial district or when the City Manager is unable to fill the seat after an
exhaustive search. Whenever the requirement does not apply, the seat shall be filled
by a district resident.
The position for a Cambridge resident with professional qualifications shall be
occupied by someone who possesses training or experience in historical preservation,
architecture, and/or a similar field. Three years after establishment of the district the
requirement that one member be a member or alternate of the Historical Commission
shall cease and a district resident shall be appointed to that position. Under no other
circumstance may an individual serve at once on both the Historical Commission and
a NCDC.
The Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall act solely in the
exercise of those functions described in this article which are applicable to the
district under its administration.
B.

C.

Members shall be appointed by the City Manager with regard to the diversity of
residents within and surrounding the district. Such members shall serve for a term of
three years, except that the initial appointments shall be for one member to serve one
year and one member to serve two years, and vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired term of office. No member shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
Each member and alternate may continue in office for up to six months after
expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly appointed and qualified. The
City Manager may extend an appointment by another six months if no such duly
appointed and qualified successor has been appointed at the point of expiration,
provided the City Council votes to approve the extension. Each member and alternate
shall continue in office after expiration of his or her term until a successor is duly
appointed and qualified, except that no member shall serve more than two
consecutive terms.
The Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and study committees shall
elect annually a Chair and Vice-Chair from its their own number. In the case of
absence, inability to act, or unwillingness to act because of self-interest on the part of
a member, their place shall be taken by an alternate member designated by the Chair,
if available, otherwise by the Vice-Chair if available, otherwise by a majority vote of
the members and alternate members of the Commission present. The person
exercising the function of Executive Director of the Historical Commission or his or

Commission. Persons serving as members or alternate members of a Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall, as a result of such service, be considered as
"special municipal employees" for purposes of Chapter 268A of the General Laws.

2.78.170 Powers and duties.
A.
The Historical Commission and each Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall have like powers, functions and duties with respect to each landmark
and neighborhood conservation district over which it has jurisdiction as is provided
Historic District Commissions under clauses (a) through (g) under Section 10 of Chapter
40C of the General Laws with respect to historic districts, including without limitation
with respect to the approval and disapproval of certificates of appropriateness, nonapplicability and hardship, the dating and signing of such certificates, the keeping of
records and adoption of rules and regulations, the filing with the City Clerk and Building
Department of certificates and determinations of disapproval by it, and the determination
of designs of appurtenances (excluding colors) which will meet the requirements of the
landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

2.78.180 Designation procedures.
A. The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a
landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or
object which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more
historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political,
economic or social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or
architecturally significant (in terms of period, style, method of construction or association
with a famous architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of
structures; may recommend for designation as a neighborhood conservation district any
area within the City containing places and structures which it determines are of
importance to the architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of
the City, and which considered together cause such area to constitute a distinctive
neighborhood or to have a distinctive character in terms of its exterior features; and may
recommend amendments to any designation of landmark or neighborhood conservation
district theretofore made.
B. Prior to the recommendation of designation or amendment of designation of any
landmark or neighborhood conservation district an investigation and report on the
historical, architectural and other relevant significance thereof shall be made. The
report shall recommend the boundaries of any proposed landmark or neighborhood
conservation district and shall recommend for incorporation in the order of the City
Council designating each landmark or neighborhood conservation district general
and/or specific standards and appropriate criteria consistent with the purposes of this
article and the provisions of Section 2.78.190 of this article that are to be applied in
making any determination of the type referred to in Sections 2.78.170, 2.78.210 and
2.78.220 of this article, with respect to the designated landmark or within the
designated neighborhood conservation district.
C. In the case of a landmark, preparation of the report shall be directed by the Historical
Commission. In the case of a neighborhood conservation district, preparation of the report
shall be directed by a study committee consisting of three members or alternates of the

The district business operator/owner seat shall be occupied by someone who owns or
operates a business within the district that is not a formula business as defined in Article
2.000 of the Zoning Ordinance, or a representative of a business association within the
district. The City Manager shall prioritize applicants representing retail establishments,
local service establishments, or restaurants that employ no more than 50 full-time
equivalent employees. The requirement to seat a district business operator/owner shall
not apply when a district does not contain any portion of a commercial district or when
the City Manager is unable to fill the seat after an exhaustive search. Whenever the
requirement does not apply, the seat shall be filled by a district resident.
D. Any thirty registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission
initiate, or the Historical Commission on its own may initiate, the process of designating
a landmark or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore made. Any one
hundred registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission initiate
the process of designating a neighborhood conservation district or amending or
rescinding any such designation theretofore made. The Commission shall within sixty
days following the filing of such request or petition hold a preliminary hearing and
arrange for the preparation of a report and, if required, request the appointment of a study
committee. In the event the Historical Commission requests the appointment of a study
committee, the approval of the formation of such committee shall be by order of the City
Council. If a petition for a landmark designation is not accepted by the Historical
Commission or a request to initiate a study of a neighborhood conservation district is not
recommended by the Historical Commission or approved by the City Council, the
Historical Commission shall not reconsider a proposed designation, amendment or
rescission of designation within two years of its previous hearing thereon. No later than
sixty days after the transmittal of a report to the Commission pertaining to a proposed
designation, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The Commission shall give not
less than fourteen days notice of such public hearing by publication in a newspaper of

general circulation in the City and by mailing notice thereof to the owner of the proposed
landmark and to every registered voter and property owner abutting the proposed
landmark or within the proposed neighborhood conservation district, each such voter and
owner to be determined from the then current records of the Assessing Department and
Election Commission, and to the City Manager, the Planning Board and the City Clerk.
E. Prior to the public hearing, the Commission shall transmit copies of the report to the
Planning Board for its consideration and recommendations.
F. The recommendation of the Historical Commission with regard to any designation,
amendment or rescission shall be transmitted to the City Manager and to the City Clerk
with a copy of the approved designation report. When making recommendations
pertaining to Neighborhood Conservation Districts only, the Historical Commission shall
include in their report information on the impact of the designation on housing and
renovation costs in the district. The Historical Commission shall obtain and include a
letter from each business association within, or within 500 yards of, the proposed district
setting out their views on the proposed district, or they shall otherwise provide a
statement that no response was received. The Historical Commission shall include each
written public comment that was properly received during the Study Committee process.
The Historical Commission shall provide a review of current and available academic and
industry research on the price effects of historical preservation districting and shall
provide a written summary of that research and relevant citations as part of the report.
Designation of a landmark or a neighborhood conservation district or amendment or
rescission of designation shall be by order of the City Council. In the case of a
designation, the order shall include a statement of the reasons for such designation and a
statement of standards which the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation
District Commission is to apply under Sections 2.78.170 and 2.78.190 through 2.78.220
of this article.
G. No designation, amendment or rescission of designation shall become effective until a
map setting forth the boundaries of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district or
change in the boundaries thereof, has been filed with the City Council and has been
recorded with the Registry of Deeds for the South District of Middlesex County.
H. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district contains
provisions for both regulatory and educational/incentive programs, the regulatory
provisions of the order shall not be effective unless and until the educational/incentive
provisions of the order are funded.
I. Following acceptance of a landmark designation petition by the Historical Commission, no
application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises of a
property being considered for landmark designation shall be granted until reviewed by the
Commission as though the property were designated as a landmark under this Article III.
Beginning with the acceptance of a designation petition or a vote to initiate a landmark
designation study and until (a) the Historical Commission makes a negative
recommendation on a proposed designation, (b) the City Council determines not to enact
the proposed designation, or (c) one year has elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission
shall review all proposed construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior
architectural features, other than color, of the structures on the premises of a proposed

landmark. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction over issuance of building permits in
a neighborhood conservation district study area except in the case of properties that are
already designated as landmarks or protected by a preservation restriction or with regard
to applications to demolish buildings pursuant to Ch. 2.78.Article II.
J. Notwithstanding the prior provisions of this section 2.78.180, a neighborhood
conservation district previously established by order of the City Council, in accordance
with this section, which order instructs that there be a review of the activities of the
Neighborhood Conservation District Commission established pursuant to that order,
following one or more public hearings by such Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission and by the Historical Commission, and a report to the City Council by
such commissions containing a summary of testimony at such hearings and
recommendations by such commissions for amendments to the powers, responsibilities
and procedures of such Neighborhood Conservation District Commission (including
amendments to the boundaries of the affected neighborhood conservation district), may
be amended by the City Council, in a manner consistent with the recommendations of
such report, or be rescinded without the necessity of the appointment of a new study
committee or of a de novo study process.

2.78.190 Review procedures.
A. Except as the order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation
district may otherwise provide in accordance with this article, the Historical Commission
or Neighborhood Conservation District Commission having jurisdiction shall review all
construction, demolition or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other
than color, ADA compliance features, accessibility features, climate resiliency features,
or renewable energy features of any landmark or within any neighborhood conservation
district.
B. The order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation district may
provide that the authority of the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation
District Commission having jurisdiction shall not extend to the review of one or more of
the following categories of structures or exterior architectural features of the landmark or
within the neighborhood conservation district in which event the structures or exterior
architectural features so excluded may be constructed or altered without review by the
Commission:
1. The application of exterior wall material in a manner that does not require the
removal or enclosure of any cornice, fascia, soffit, bay, porch, hood, window
or door casing, or any other protruding decorative element;
2. Alterations to the exterior of existing structures that do not increase or diminish
the size and location of windows and doors, cause the removal of any bay,
porch, hood, window or door casing or any other protruding decorative
element, or alter the appearance of a roof;
3. The exterior appearance of a new structure that does not require a variance or
special permit under the zoning ordinance then in effect;
4. Signs, temporary structures, lawn statuary, or recreational equipment, subject
to such conditions as to duration of use, dimension, location, lighting,
removal and similar matters as the Commission may reasonably specify;

5. Terraces, walks, driveways, sidewalks and similar structures substantially at
grade level;
6. Walls and fences;
7. Storm doors and windows, screens, window air conditioners, lighting fixtures,
antennae, trellis work and similar appurtenances.
C. The Historical Commission or a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission may
determine from time to time after a public hearing that certain categories of exterior
architectural features or structures, including, without limitation, any of those enumerated
in this section, if the provisions of the applicable order do not limit the authority of such
commission with respect thereto, may be constructed or altered without review by such
commission without causing substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this
article.
D. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district provides, the
determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall be binding
only with regard to applications to construct a new building, to demolish an existing
structure if a demolition permit is required, to construct a parking lot as a principal use,
and to construct an addition to an existing structure that would increase its gross floor
area, and in all other cases the determinations of a commission shall be advisory only and
not binding on an applicant. In no case shall a building permit be issued until the
commission has made a determination under the applicable provisions of this article.
E. A determination of the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission with regard to an application to construct a residential building in which a
majority of the units are permanently reserved for households at or below 100% of area
median income through the Affordable Housing Overlay or any other means on the
premises of a designated landmark shall be advisory only and not binding on the
applicant.
F. Applications for temporary accessibility features shall be granted Temporary Certificates
of Hardship for the length of the ownership or tenancy of the disabled applicant. Such
certificates shall be issued through administrative procedures within one business day. A
determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard to an
application to construct permanent accessibility features shall be advisory only and not
binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical Commission with regard to an
application to construct such permanent features on the premises of a designated
landmark shall be binding, but the Commission shall not in any case deny all accessibility
improvements necessary to comply with provisions of the Americans With Disabilities
Act and relevant Massachusetts statutes.
G. A determination of a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission with regard to an
application to construct climate resiliency and renewable energy features shall be
advisory only and not binding on the applicant. A determination of the Historical
Commission with regard to an application to construct such features on the premises of a
designated landmark shall be binding but not unreasonably denied.

2.78.210 Certificates of appropriateness, non-applicability or hardship.
A. Except as the order establishing or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation

district may otherwise provide, no structure designated a landmark or within a
neighborhood conservation district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects
exterior architectural features unless the Historical Commission or Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission having jurisdiction shall first have issued a certificate
of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship with
respect to such construction or alteration.
B. Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the Historical Commission or
Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall file with the Commission an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a
certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as the commission may
reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations, specifications, material and
other information, including in the case of demolition or removal a statement of the
proposed condition and appearance of the property thereafter, as may be reasonably
deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a determination on the
application.
C. No building permit for alteration of an exterior architectural feature of a landmark or
construction of a structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature within a
neighborhood conservation district and no demolition permit for demolition or removal
of a landmark or of a structure within a neighborhood conservation district shall be
issued by the City or any department thereof until the certificate required by this article
has been issued by the Historical Commission or Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission having jurisdiction.
D. This provision does not apply to proposals for, or existing, affordable housing that either
is developed under the Affordable Housing Overlay, as defined in Section 11.207 of the
Zoning Ordinance, or has a majority of units permanently reserved for households at or
below 100% of Area Median Income, in a neighborhood conservation district, over which no
neighborhood conservation district commission has jurisdiction. The Historical Commission
shall have only advisory jurisdiction with regard to such affordable housing.

2.78.220 Factors considered by Commissions.
A. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall consider, among other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the site or structure, the general design,
arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and the relation of such
features to similar features of structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new
construction or additions to existing structures a Neighborhood Conservation District
Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure,
and a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not impose dimensional and
setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance. In the case of new construction or additions to existing structures a
commission shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both
in relation to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in the
vicinity, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback
requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the zoning
ordinance. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural

Commented [SCM3]: This section has been supplanted
by 2.78.190.E and is no longer necessary.

Commented [SCM4]: A) The ability to consider the
appropriateness of the size and shape of a new structure is
fundamental to the purposes of the ordinance.
B) The ability to impose dimensional and setback
requirements beyond zoning is an important if rarely used
regulatory tool. I have restored the original language of this
section.

Packet Pg. 191

features not subject to public view.
B. A Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not make any recommendation
or requirement except for the purpose of preventing proposals incongruous to the
historic aspects, architectural significance or the distinctive character of the landmark or
neighborhood conservation district.
C. In passing upon matters before it, the Historical Commission or Neighborhood
Conservation District Commission shall also consider community goals as may from time
to time be expressed by the City Council, including the need to provide additional
housing, affordable and otherwise, and to promote the sustainable use of energy and
capacity for climate resilience.

2.78.270 Enforcement and remedies.
The Historical Commission and any Neighborhood Conservation District Commission are each
specifically authorized to institute any and all actions, proceedings in law and in equity, as it
deems necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this article or to
prevent a threatened violation thereof. Any violation of any provision of this article may be
punished to the like extent provided in Section 13 of Chapter 40C of the General Laws for a
violation of said Chapter 40C. In addition to the foregoing, no building permit shall be issued,
with respect to any premises upon which a landmark or a structure within any neighborhood
conservation district has been voluntarily demolished otherwise than pursuant to a certificate
granted after compliance with the provisions of this article, for a period of two years after the
date of the completion of such demolition (the word "premises" for the purposes of this sentence
referring to the parcel of land upon which the demolished structure was located and all adjoining
parcels of land under common ownership or control.)

2.78.280 Decennial Review.
A. Every ten years beginning in 2024, the City Council shall review each existing
Neighborhood Conservation District according to the following schedule:

Half Crown Marsh

Years ending in 4
(2024, 2034, 2044, etc.)

The site is designed such that it provides convenient, safe and secure access and egress for
customers and employees arriving to and leaving from the site using all modes of
transportation, including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation users.

(b)

On-site loading, refuse and service areas are designed to be secure and shielded from
abutting uses.

(c)

The building and site have been designed to be compatible with other buildings in the area
and to mitigate any negative aesthetic impacts that might result from required security
measures and restrictions on visibility into the building's interior and/or from restrictions on
direct access by consumers.

(d)

If the proposed Cannabis Production Facility is not proposed to include a Medical Marijuana
Treatment Center, it will nevertheless provide programs to assist qualifying patients within
the city or neighborhood who are registered through the Massachusetts Medical Use of
Marijuana Program in obtaining services under that program.

Technical amendments to Affordable Housing Overlay Petition &
Planning Board Report

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Following the Planning Board’s public hearings on the Affordable Housing
Overlay (AHO) Zoning Petition (the “Petition”), staff from the Community
Development Department (CDD) and Law Department have reviewed the latest
version of the Petition and offer a revised version of the Petition text. These
revisions have the purpose of clarifying certain provisions and minimizing the
possibility of doubt or conflicting interpretations when applied.
Markups are shown in the version below, and annotations are provided to
explain specific changes.
In addition to these changes, staff suggest simplifying the provision in which the
normal height limits can be exceeded if a certain density standard is met.
Calculating the allowed density based on open space requirements could lead to
ambiguous or unintended interpretations, especially where open space
requirements are reduced or waived.
Also attached hereto for the Council’s consideration is the Planning Board’s
report on the Petition.

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,
Please vote NO on this blanket proposal that attempts to bypass thoughtful planning for
Cambridge construction/development. The current AHO should remain in place and get
the chance to be evaluated.
As far as building very high near transit hubs goes, not all proposed locations are
appropriate for housing many people. For example, 2072 Mass Ave is not--please see
the Safety section of p.1 on northwaldenneighbors.org A wise City Council would
require a traffic safety-and-flow study of this location.
Thank you for your commitment to good planning.

Combined outdoor dining and bike lanes

Hello Council,
The protected bike lanes on mass ave have made such a large improvement to being able to bike safely down a busy
street. I used to avoid the street as much as possible due to how busy it is, but now I often take it as it's a great place to
ride! Losing the protected lanes and replacing with just painted ones would be a huge loss in terms of safety and
usability. Cars do not respect painted bike lanes, and I am always having to go into the road to get around them as they
park there. There are many restaurants with takeout on mass ave, and I would imagine that having painted lanes would
increase the number of delivery drivers pulled over.
Please vote to keep the protected lanes along with the outdoor dining. Cars are not meant to be the main method of
transportation in such a large city.
Thank you,
Adam

Cycling Safety Ordinance Amendment From Policy Order 17

Hello,
I have shared the below concern already with the City Councillor Burhan Azeem @Azeem, Burhan as well as Council
Member Patricia Nolan (pnolan@cambridgema.gov) who have both expressed their intention to keep bikers' safety at
the forefront of their policy decisions. I thank you both for taking the time to reply to me, hope you continue to keep
bikers safety as a top concern, and wish you well in your decisions
I am sharing this with you now, Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang, in hopes to express the personal impact this
amendment imposes and plead for your support in keeping bikers like myself safe
My name is Alex Zicaro. I am a resident of Everett who commutes to Cambridge multiple days a week. I recently moved
to Everett a few months ago from Lawrence. Previously my commute via the Commuter Rail and EZ Ride would take at
minimum an hour and fifteen minutes to get in. I explicitly moved to Everett with the intent of bicycling into Cambridge
for work, which takes about 30 minutes. If I were to use public transport, it would take about an hour and if I were to
drive it would take about 40 minutes; so bicycling is my best option, especially with all the construction going on on the
roads and the public transportation
I love the ability to take my bicycle into Cambridge specifically because my entire commute has separated bicycle lanes. I
feel safer knowing that there is a dedicated space on the road for me to travel in. Motorists in my experience are not
cognisant of bicyclists which brings major hazards into my commute. Without the dedicated bicycle lanes, I would feel
much more uncomfortable and unsafe on my commute, to the point where I would no longer elect to bicycle in to work.
By no longer taking my bicycle, I will be adding to the thousands of cars commuting into the city, adding to
emissions and further taxing the crippling public transport infrastructure. I know I am not alone in my thoughts and my
single impact will be multiplied by the hundreds if not thousands of other commuters who will no longer feel
comfortable commuting via bicycle
In addition, painted on lanes do not do enough to keep me safe. The new dedicated and elevated bicycle lanes near the
new Casino is an exemplary example of putting bicyclists safety as the utmost priority. We are completely exposed to
thousands of pounds of steel with minimal protection. Paint is not enough as double parking is rampant in the city
There are already locations in Cambridge that only have painted bike lanes and on countless occasions I see vehicles
driving and parking in these lanes. In these locations I have to be on high alert as a rider to ensure vehicles that are in my
designated area are aware of my presence and do not hit me. Separated bike lanes are the only solution to this problem
As much as I like outdoor restaurant seating and want these businesses to succeed, the safety of the residents and
commuters in Cambridge should take precedence. I sincerely hope my concerns do not fall on deaf ears and hope safety
is kept as the number one priority
Thank you for your time and good luck with your decision

AHO, making good use of CDD's attention, and Central Square

Dear City Councillors,
First, I hope you are all doing as well as can be after the loss of Atieno Simmons and in this busy season. I want to
express my condolences.
Second, I'm glad to see y'all make progress on AHO amendments, Alewife zoning, and revising NCD regulations. I hope
you can get these all over the finish line soon. I urge you to move forward with them and to reject PO #8 which I view as
a last-ditch effort to derail the amendments and waste CDD's already extremely-fragmented time in the process. I will
do my best to give my answers to the questions offered in PO #8:
(A) If heights on AHO corridors were based on a multiple of base zoning such as 1.3 or 1.5, it would completely
undercut the effectiveness of the proposal, as base zoning is currently significantly less than 12 / 1.5 = 8 stories on
almost every single one of the proposed AHO corridors.
(B) Requiring a portion of AHO units to be reserved for middle-income earners would significantly decrease the
effectiveness of the AHO, because in order to cobble together a variety of funding sources, AHO projects must comply
with a wide variety of constraints on the income mix of their residents - they do not have a lot of wiggle room to meet
highly specific city constraints as well. (If we want more middle-income units, we should either ask the city to finance a
new type of mixed-income housing or we should work on creating modest market-rate multi-family housing - we
shouldn't try to force the hand of primarily-non-city-financed projects.) Additionally, doing so would reduce the good
done by the AHO because the middle-income units in CDD's portfolio are in significantly less demand than the lowincome units.
(C) The proposed amendments to the AHO will better protect open space than the current AHO, because they allow
buildings to have more height if they provide additional open space. Jefferson Park would have had more open space if
these amendments had been passed.
Third, I want to suggest that PO #9 - the "affordable homeownership overlay" - be revised. A friend of mine saw this and
thought it had to do with the AHO, but based on my conversations with Councillor Zondervan months ago, my
understanding is that this proposal is best understood as a part of the ongoing CDD / Housing Committee conversations
about how to end exclusionary zoning and maximize the production of modest multi-family housing. I am concerned
that the text of PO #9 does not clearly explain the proposal's motivations and the constraints and principles that it was
designed under, and that without such a clear explanation, a response from CDD will not be as helpful as it could be.
Fourth, I want to suggest that PO #5 - regarding the Quality of Life in Central Square - should advance the zoning and
non-zoning components on parallel tracks rather than tying one to the other. As the PO notes, there have been a bevy of
planning and zoning studies regarding Central Square; the zoning conversations are well-progressed and we know what
kinds of zoning we need for the area. We could even simply adopt the C2 zoning. Meanwhile, the quality of life issues,
which appear to be the concern of the bulk of the PO, have very little to do with zoning, require a very different set of
stakeholders, and would produce a very different work product. I am worried that having a single task force coordinate
both efforts would result in one of them getting dropped or sidelined.
With the departure of at least three of you from the Council heading into next term, I believe it is extremely important
for you all to consider what kinds of legislative and planning procedures have been most and least effective this term,
and what kinds of precedents can be set that will maximize CDD and the next Council's productivity and focus.

In support of the AHO amendments

Dear City Councilors,
I understand that at your upcoming meeting tomorrow, you'll be voting on the proposed AHO amendments.
I live one block from Mass Ave in Porter Square. Cambridge is an incredible place to live, and my hope is that the AHO
will allow residents to stay as long as they want, without getting priced out, and allow us to invite many new neighbors
in to enjoy it.
Height is our best available resource for producing additional housing on a fixed amount of land - at all, not to mention
efficiently. It also seems inevitable that new residents would support the businesses and take advantage of existing
transit and bike infrastructure along our more commercial corridors. Especially for folks who might not be able to afford
a car, that access is a game-changer. From what I can tell, in terms of real, material impacts, it's all upside.
Considering the simultaneous housing affordability and climate crises we're facing, this is a moment to use every arrow
in our quiver to enable development of affordable units that are integrated with existing social, commercial, and
physical resources.
That's why I support these amendments and hope you will too.
Respectfully,
Amalia Child

Vote No on AHO2 and diminishing guidelines for architectural preservation

Dear Members of the Planning Board,
I have consistently opposed the AHO 2 proposal and supported alterna ves put forward by Councilors Toner and Nolan
to review obstacles and propose carefully considered solu ons to expand AHO without ruining our ﬁne city forever.
There is no reasonable purpose to double the AHO height limit. The developers are the only ones who will proﬁt from
this mistake and the tax payers will end up foo ng the enormous bill. Please invest in neighborhood scale aﬀordable
housing where residents will enjoy a be er quality of life than if they are in towers. We cannot and should not be
responsible to house every person who desires to move to Cambridge , MA. Our small city is already among the densest
ci es in the country per capita. What some of the council members are proposing is going to destroy the fabric of our
city and what makes it desirable to live in. Our historic houses should be protected and embraced, not dwarfed by a 12‐
15 story buildings that are proposed all over the city. Please listen to the advice and wisdom of city planners and historic
commissioners and do not rush this impac ul decision. To remove oversight and height restric ons with new buildings in
Cambridge allows for incongruous development and shows a lack of respect for our ﬁne historic buildings and our city as
a whole.Setbacks and green spaces are crucial to providing a livable city. We take pride in our city’s history and
architecture. We are at a pivotal me right now and your vote ma ers a great deal on this issue.Please do not take away
neighborhood involvement and architectural preserva on input.
This will be an enormous mistake if this is implemented. There is no way back once historic buildings are torn down or
marred by the proximity of 12‐15 story buildings . They will cause a blight on the city. Dennis Carlone stated it perfectly in
his ar cle on the subject. Qualiﬁed people who are architects, city planners, and/or historians should be the requirement
to be on the NCD. Otherwise ill advised and hasty decisions will and are being made by people who have zero creden als
on the ma er.Conserva on and preserva on are crucial to maintaining Cambridge’s character and heritage.The residents
in Cambridge are closely watching this decision.
This could not be a more important decision to all of the residents of Cambridge.
Sincerely,

RE: AHO "Amendments" zoning for 12-15 story buildings: Staggering Consequences!

Dear City Councilors,
We need the promised 5 year study of the AHO so we can make informed decisions about any warranted expansion, and
the best way to proceed. Nearly all Cambridge is united in their wish for more affordable housing. We can find
mechanisms to achieve this which do not pit environmental/ social/ fiscal responsibility and city/community oversight all
against one another - these should all work hand in hand!
Current AHO concerns will be exacerbated with the massive AHO expansion proposed by the AHO
"Amendments". There are likely staggering environmental consequences, among the numerous other unaddressed
issues of these "Amendments."
Exponentially increasing the AHO height and reach throughout Cambridge will exponentially increase the problems
accompanying this massive construction initiative that will now Far Exceed neighborhood norms.
Under the AHO "Amendments":
- Some of the largest buildings will be allowed by zoning right throughout Cambridge, without meaningful city
planning/neighborhood review. The current AHO also forgoes some review, but the consequences would be far more
consequential under the expansive "Amendments"!
- Issues of height and setbacks are inappropriately left to the discretion of investors/developers due to additional
zoning rights in these "Amendments". Site specific concerns require city and/or community review - zoning is not the
correct tool for this.
- The zoning is so wide - there is no mechanism to ensure appropriate siting for these huge buildings. Not every lot will
be appropriate.
- There are no restrictions on the number of buildings that will be constructed.
- There are huge environmental concerns in redevelopment as construction is one of the most disruptive processes in
the city. The massive increase in embodied carbon produced by redevelopment goes against all our emission reduction
goals. Embodied carbon is expected to increase from about 11% to closer to 75% of building emissions over the next 10
years in the US making up far more of our emissions than operating building emission.* In Cambridge these numbers
will be far more extreme as our building emissions are currently around 80% rather than the US average of 39%. This
aspect alone requires better understanding as Cambridge's actions may be replicated widely! We need to meet and
exceed our climate goals - the consequences of not doing so are a matter of survival.
- Lack of setbacks decreases tree canopies and increases heat island effects.
- All infrastructure needs for large buildings need to be considered on a case by case basis. When removing parking
requirements for buildings, there needs to be feasible alternatives for all transportation needs. Since this is lacking additional vehicles and traffic pollution/congestion can be expected with additional housing.
- Extreme cost overruns of nearly 1 million for some units not including land places actual "Affordability" of these units
in question.
- Community recommendations for current AHO construction have not been given due consideration. We are now
talking about redevelopment of heavily settled streets and squares. Many people will be impacted and displaced,
exacerbating this concern.
- There is an attempt to undercut the Cambridge historic organization's recommendations even though these have not
resulted in any notable disruption in the past. Historic organizations help to prioritize preservation, and better integrate
design into the neighborhood. Do we want to integrate, or erase historic architecture and neighborhoods?

There is much that makes Cambridge special. If we plan better, rather than implementing wide rezoning, we can build
needed housing without destroying neighborhoods and unnecessarily disrupting communities.

AHO 2.0

Dear City Council,
I'm writing to continue to express my strong support for AHO 2.0 as a resident and voter in Cambridge. I urge you to
continue to push this critical measure forward so that we can start building housing commensurate with the scale of the
affordability crisis in our city.
Like so many residents, I have endured double-digit rent increases in the past few years. This is hardly a surprise. Until
the supply of housing in Cambridge begins to grow at a rate that matches the city's population increase, rents will keep
rising. Fast. Anyone who pretends otherwise is not grappling with reality.
There are reasonable questions about the particulars of AHO 2.0, as there would be with any important law. But the
fundamental truth is that Cambridge desperately needs more housing, of all types, as quickly as possible. Those who
oppose AHO 2.0 often fail to provide an alternative that actually meets our needs. There are legitimate other interests
involved -- e.g. protecting tree cover -- but opponents of AHO 2.0 offer either no solution or limited measures that will
barely make a dent in the housing crisis. This is quintessential NIMBYism. It should be resisted, particularly when it is
paired with messages about our not having space for more 'outsiders' who want to move to our city. We have heard
these messages many times before, over many decades. They were wrong in decades past, and they are wrong now.
I hope that the Council will continue to exercise leadership by pushing forward with this essential initiative.

The Vote on Housing and Historic Preservation

Dear Members of the Cambridge City Council,
I urge you to hold off voting on the AH-2 plan until more thought can be brought to the financing of affordable housing.
Developers are not our saviors., They will produce expensive and luxury housing but
little affordable housing. Densification of the city (which is already very dense) along major corridors and near public
transportation stations is laudable, but not at the expense of development that ignores the amenities of public space,
the design of buildings in the public interest, and the integration of historic buildings.
Please keep the present safeguards for Historic Preservation and focus on enabling development along major
corridors such as Mass. Avenue and public transit access points.
Thank you.

In support of 100% AHO Amendments!

Greetings City Council,
I hope it's not too late to share my strong and enthusiastic support for the 100% Affordable Housing
Overlay amendments that will be voted on tonight. Cambridge desperately needs more housing and
especially more affordable housing. While the AHO shows great promise to help with this urgent
problem, it will be better able to do so if these amendments are passed.
As a current Cambridge homeowner, I've been so disheartened to see individual NIMBY activists put
an end (or at least long delays) to many excellent new housing projects that were carefully designed
and could have provided hundreds more families with safe, affordable housing in our city. I hope the
City Council will solidify the AHO with these amendments and help our city become a more affordable
and inclusive place.
Thank you for your work in service to Cambridge,
Annie

comments AGAINST proposed revisions to "AHO 2.0"

Dear Members of the Cambridge City Council:
I am writing to express my strong opposition to revisions that have been proposed for the
Affordable Housing Overlay (informally known as “AHO 2.0”).
The revisions this time around remain far too extreme, and they should not be adopted.
City Councilor Dennis Carlone has written several thoughtful, cogent, and concise expositions
on what affordable housing initiatives can –and should—look like here in Cambridge.
I strongly support his perspectives and his calm, reasoned, practical approach.
I commend his opinions to your attention, and I thank him and the other City Council
members who do not support the changes that are currently under consideration.
Please see the following:

Day on 5/1/23;

Cambridge Day on 3/20/23;

Policy order on outdoor dining and bike lanes

Dear Cambridge City Council,
I wanted to make a comment regarding the policy order being considered tomorrow (Monday 9/10) focused on how to
combine outdoor dining installations with bike lanes. I really love the expansion of outdoor dining in the city and I feel
like it makes the city much more welcoming and exciting. Especially in summer, these kinds of facilities are really perfect
and enable my friends and I to enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery of the city.
Another aspect of life in Cambridge that I greatly enjoy is the freedom to bike to do my local errands, for recreation
and, often, to dine outdoors! I feel safer with the expansion of protected bike lanes on places like Inman Square and
Mass Ave. They are vast improvements over the painted lanes, which were routinely ignored or even blocked by
vehicles. Taking away that vital avenue of travel would make it difficult for me, an able cyclist, and I can only imagine
the impact it would have on vulnerable populations that may not be as confident about cycling so close to vehicles.
There's plenty of examples of these protected lanes being modified to accommodate outdoor dining. I don't see any
reason to replace them and cause confusion to cyclists and drivers. I can't imagine that would be any better for business
than removing the dining spaces.
I hope you all will consider the city's position as a national leader in inclusive transportation. Thank you for all you do.
Best,

Outdoor dining and bike lanes

City Council,
I whole-heartedly support outdoor dining options for restaurants and would support expanding this option.
I do not support jeopardizing cyclists' safety by replacing separated bike lanes with paint-only lanes.
I am an occasional cyclist but on nearly 100% of my bike rides (especially through Central Square) I encounter cars
double parked or parked in a bike lane. Having to merge with motor vehicle traffic in these situations negates the point
of having bike lanes in the first place. For this reason, I urge you to reject any "safety measure" that includes paint-only
bike lanes; separated lanes are the only way cyclists begin to feel safe.
Thanks for your consideration,

AHO 2.0

Dear City Council,
I haven't written before about this issue and want now to add my voice to others who oppose this
proposal. I am fortunate to be a longtime Cambridge resident, and I chose Cambridge for my home in
part because of its city streets with single, two-family, and three-family homes. Of course, universities
and businesses will need bigger buildings to accommodate their needs, taller buildings along our
main streets provide commercial space, and we all know about the lack of affordable housing in our
city. But developing huge, tall buildings isn't the only way to add to our housing stock. I'm concerned
that some of the proposed developments can be done without design oversight, setbacks, or parking.
Please consider the views of the citizens who write to you and vote accordingly. Thank you.

Re: Sept 11 vote on housing density proposal

Dear Mr. McGovern,
I agree with much of what you say however I think the objection many of us have regarding this policy is the original
AHO had a five year review process as part of the agreement and already changes are being proposed without what
seems is a lot of reflection. Perhaps the timeframe of the review should be considered but to change the original
agreement creates distrust.
The changes also seem extreme in the face of an agreed upon AHO. Sure, small apartment buildings are not feasible in
housing an additional 6,500 people, or the 21,000 on the list, but what is the logic to go to 15 stories anywhere in the
city? It appears that urban planning has taken a back seat or been rejected entirely. This is suddenly turning into a
divisive issue where the opposers are suddenly made out to look like they do not want affordable housing of any kind. I
think we are objecting to the process and the extreme proposal. We are all adults and we should be treating each other
as such.
One of the biggest questions I have is related to the setback, or lack thereof. We are attempting to get more people in
this city to walk and bike, many of these buildings will not have any parking or minimal parking. Why then would we not
want space in front to walk or sit in some shade (other than the shade of the building itself)? Perhaps while people wait
for a bus? It seems counterproductive to the City’s other goals.
I ask for a no vote.
Thank you.

waiting list. These are members of our community. They matter. I believe we should be trying to help
them remain in out community. Cambridge has some of the highest rents in the country, and people
need a hand. If we leave housing up to the market, lower income people are going to lose. ThecAHO is
for 100% affordable housing. Not market. Not luxury.
I keep hearing that THE THING that makes Cambridge special is our historic architecture. I'm not saying
that isn't ONE thing that makes us special, but to me it is not THE THING. I think what makes us special
is our diversity and the people who live here, and we are losing that as more people, mostly lower and
middle income, are priced out. Personally, I would rather our city look a bit different aestheticaly then
become a bigger Wellesley.

Cambridge doesn't have a lot of land to build on. Add to that that building and land prices in Cambridge
are incredibly high, and funding for affordable housing is difficult to come by, and you can see that we
have a very complex issue. Let's say that we want to build affordable housing for the 6,500 people on
the list. If we were to do that by building housing that "fits in",(which is also debatable because we have
many tall buildings in Cambridge that are also part of our landscape, you live in one!) we would have to
build thousands of smaller structures. Tell me where we are going to do that? We DO NOT have the
space to build another Cambridge Port.
If we could start from scratch, maybe your plan of solving this crisis by building smaller structures could
work, but we are not starting from scratch. We are trying to address a complex problem with the cards
we have. I'm not interested in fantasy plans that we may wish could be true but aren't reality. And let's
be clear, no one is saying that the AHO is going to solve this problem. It is one tool. We may see 3 tov5
of these taller buildings, spread out on main corridors across the city, over the next 10 to 15 years. This
mantra that this will make us Manhattan is silly and a scare tactic. We are already like Manhattan when
it comes to our rental prices.
Now, on to the issue of "hi rise buildings are bad." First, I think it is insulting for people to be saying that
there is no community in buildings like Fresh Pond Apartments. Especially, because most of the people
saying that haven't stepped foot in those apartments. There is a thriving, supportive, wonderful
community there, as there is in Manning Apartments (19 stories), Millers River Apartments (19 stories)
and other tall buildings in Cambridge.
The high rise buildings of urban renewal are not what we are building. Since aesthetics seems to be your
priority, they look nothing like those concrete monstrosities of the past. They look better. They are built
better. They have more amenities. They have social/community space and programming. In addition,
those buildings didn't fail because they were tall. They failed because they were built away from local
businesses, public transportation, parks, schools and other amenities. They were built cheaply and were
falling apart soon after being built. They concentrated only the poorest people in these buildings, and
they were underfunded. They would have failed if they were three stories tall.
AHO buildings are going to be built on main corridors. Near stores and retail, public transportation,
schools and parks. They ate going to be built with better materials (our affordable housing regularly wins
awards). They are going to have a range of inches, from thise with housing vouchers to households that
earn over $100,000 a year. Apples and oranges. Not comparable to failed urban renewal.
Now, I don't know your background or the background of all the people you have included on this
email, but I am a social worker. For 30 years I have worked with some of the most vulnerable people in
our community and across the state. These people matter to me and everything flows from housing.
Every outcome: educational, occupational, physical health, mental health, on and on, are improved with
stable housing. Don't thise of us who have stable housing have a moral obligation to help those who
don't? The reality is, if 3 to 5 of these buildings get built over the nextv10 to 15 years, your life won't
change. But the lives of the people who will live in these homes will be saved.
Just a month ago, I sat with a 60 year old woman and her 28 year old, special needs son. They have to
leave their apartment because the rent is increasing. They have never lived apart. They are not on any of
the affordable housing lists. The result? She is going to a women's shelter and he is going to a male
shelter. She could be placed on the Cape and he could be placed in Springfield. What kind of community
ate we that we will object to building housing that they could have lived in? These are stories I hear
everyday and I will not prioritize the look of our city over these people's lives.

The bottom line is this. If you truly care about affordable housing, maintaing our
diversity and helping people have housing they can afford, then you will sacrifice
something for it. If you don't want to do that, that's fine. You are entitled to support
whatever you want, but I'm asking you to give up a little something, for others in our
community who need our help. This is a moral issue for me.
Cambridge architecture has changed over the years. The look of Cambridge today is
not the look of Cambridge when I was a child. The Cambridge of my childhood was
not the Cambridge of my mother's and on and on going back generations. Just over
100 years ago no one was building triple deckers. Zoning changed to allow those
buildings to be built. They were the affordable housing of the time. Would you have
been one of the people arguing, as people did, that these buildings didn't "fit in?"
Now, triple deckers are the types of housing that people want to protect. Cities
change and evolve based on many factors. You can't (and shouldn't) lock a city in
time.
So, we may just have a fundamental difference of opinion about what makes
Cambridge special, and that's fine. But I am always going to put people in need first.
Sorry for the long email but this is complicated.

Many thanks for your reply. You seem to suggest that your “goals” should be rapidly perused no matter

You have not presented a cost/benefit analysis nor evidenced a concern for the impact on our city’s

Dear Councilman Zondervan.
Recently my neighbor, Prof. Hout, wrote to the Council setting out his
analysis of why the proposed housing density measure would be most
unwise and harmful (see below for his letter). Prof. Hout is a very wise
and fair-minded person who understands the need for affordable housing
and, as do I, is very sympathetic to creating more affordable housing in
our wonderful city. For the reasons he has set out the current proposals
should not be accepted. I have been privileged to live in Cambridge since
1963 and fear that these unwise provisions will be detrimental to the wellbeing of the city and its residents while failing to accomplish their stated
goal.
For those reasons I strongly urge you to please vote against these
proposals and promise to actively campaign for those who do and
campaign against those who vote in favor of these most unwise
proposals.
Sincerely yours,

Hout Letter to the Council:
Cambridge City Council,
I’ve been a Cambridge resident since 1972.
I understand you are soon voting on whether to revise the HHO to allow 12-15 story
buildings on major Cambridge streets and intersections for the purpose of providing
Affordable Housing.
Affordable housing is important and Cambridge needs to build more, but this particular
proposal, if passed, will, I think, years down the road will be regretted. It will be
regretted for the same reasons the quick fix of the elevated Southeast Expressway in
Boston built mid-20th century was regretted because it adversely changed the nature of
the city and eventually had to be torn down. Cambridge is very dense and has very
little green space. The only thing that keeps it feeling like a community and with
tolerable traffic and appealing street life is the absence of high-rise buildings.
Cambridge has the money to do Affordable Housing correctly, which is to purchase
single or double family homes which are for sale throughout our neighborhoods and
either convert or rebuild them into multiple (3 to 4 unit) Affordable Home structures. I
have watched how Martha’s Vineyard has developed Affordable Housing with this
approach, and everyone, including both the residents of the affordable housing and
their neighbors, is much happier. I have talked to those living in them, and they greatly
appreciate the effort to make their housing integrate well with their neighbors. They do
not feel they live in a project.
Of course this is more expensive, but it is the right way to create affordable
housing. Cambridge has the money to do this—we have a tremendous and growing tax
base. Not all municipalities do. Cambridge works hard and has the money to creatively
to build new, well-laid out and well-equipped public parks. Why would be not apply the
same intelligence and judgment to our plan for affordable housing?
So I urge you to vote No on this proposal, and develop a more distributed, small scale
building approach to affordable housing.
Sincerely,
Thomas Hout

I’ve been a Cambridge resident since 1969.

Affordable Housing.
Affordable housing is important and Cambridge needs to build more, but this particular
proposal, if passed, will, I think, years down the road will be regretted. It will adversely
changed the nature of the city with the feeling of a harmonious community with tree
lined streets and homes. Cambridge has the money to do Affordable Housing correctly,

I am a member of the Cambridge Plant and Garden Club that funds and supports the
planting of trees throughout the city. The Urban Forestry division of Public Works
states: “A healthy forest is a vital part of a healthy city. The City of Cambridge is
committed to maintaining a healthy urban forest, which includes trees on streets, in
parks, on private property and campuses. These trees provide essential shade, clean the
air and support a living ecosystem, benefitting water quality and providing food and
habitat for mammals, birds, and insects.” All streets should have trees, and buildings
must have setbacks to allow for this.
So I urge you to vote No on this proposal, and develop a more distributed, small scale
building approach to affordable housing along with the planting of trees in front of all
buildings.
Warm regards,
Janet Plotkin

Outdoor Dining and Bike Safety

Hello!
I am a Cambridge resident writing to urge you to not replace separated bike lines with paint. Paint-only bike lanes are
dangerous and can be blocked by double-parking. I have personal experience with this - I was knocked into a doubleparked truck by a city bus a few months ago in a paint-only bike lane. The experience was scary and showed me how
important having a separated bike lane is. I do support outdoor dining and would love to see even more of it, with
increased flexibility in designs, but ask you to continue to support separated bike lanes rather than paint-only bike
lanes, as the latter are significantly less safe. Paint is not adequate protection, and should not be considered as part
of this policy order.
These examples–right here in Cambridge and Somerville–show that bike lanes can be designed around outdoor
dining, or outdoor dining can be added to existing bike lanes (including with seasonal removal, when the right kind of
flexposts are used; Cambridge already has removable flexposts in some locations).

Need more than paint for bike lanes

Good day,
I am writing to respond to the idea that paint is as good as lanes. Having the experience of nearly
hitting bike riders over many years and knowing friends who have been killed riding their bikes, I
am really THRILLED with the new bike lanes Cambridge has made.
Years ago I bought a bike to cut down on the use of my gas fueled car for short errands. I quit
riding it because there were no bike lanes and I was scared to share a street with the drivers who
felt I was “less” for not driving a car.
Keep doing everything for bikes to share the streets with cars, trucks and buses. And, please
educate bikers to pay attention to lights. I’ve had bikers not look “both ways” before running a
red light. It is frightening. In fact, one ran into me running a red light. Fortunately, there was no
damage to him. I did get some scratches to my car which didn’t bother me, but what a terrible
thing to have someone fall off their bike when just tapping my car.
I feel the best traffic solutions are to use public transportation and leave the cars at home.
I am very pleased with Cambridge’s green restricted bike paths. I feel your work has made a big
improvement on my awareness driving especially with the increase of Blue Bikes.
Thank you all for being proactive for BIKES. We need more than just paint.
Sincerely,
Carolyn Manson

Re: AHO 2.0

Please vote against AHO 2.0 tonight. I understand your sense of urgency to respond to our housing emergency, but AHO2 is not the answer.
Do we really want 15-story buildings at Harvard, Porter and Central Squares, casting shadows, without setbacks, and without any review by the
Planning Board and neighborhoods?
The good news is that Cambridge is already almost half way to our 2030 Envision Cambridge new affordable housing (AH) unit goal. 1,500
units are in play. Why change what’s already working?
Proponents of AHO2 have hijacked the conversation. There are other ways to create more affordable housing and there are broader questions
that we should be asking. For example, how can we lower development costs? Currently AH costs almost $1m per unit.
We should consider creative financing and look at Montgomery County, MD’s Housing Production Fund as a model. And we should look at the
ITASCA Project in Minneapolis, MN: a collaboration of businesses, philanthropies and public sectors. We should also look at how they create
social housing in the Netherlands, where non-profits, not private equity firms, own 2/3rds of the rental units.
And what about creating more shared housing?
We need to consider the unintended consequences of giving developers carte blanche to build high, and, most importantly, to come to
consensus about our goal. Currently, 15% of our housing, 8,500 units, is income restricted. Most of our neighboring communities have 6-7%
AH. They will soon be producing more units as required by the MBTA Communities Act. Housing is a regional issue; its solutions will be
regional, too.
If our goal is to increase our Affordable Housing stock to 20%, adding another 3,000 units, how will we pay for this? At $1 million a unit, 3,000
units would cost $3 billion. Our annual budget is about $1 billion and our FY2023 tax levy was $5.3 million. Will we raise taxes or allow high
rises to be built everywhere to get the “free” (but not actually “free,” since they increase the cost of market rate units) inclusionary units?
We must change and broaden our conversation and move from a quick fix mentality to a nuanced discussion about our goals and how we can
best achieve them, considering all the longterm implications.

Strong support for AHO amendments

To City Councilors:
I am writing in strong support of the AHO amendments. I attended both Planning Board
meetings on the amendments. While they did not issue a favorable recommendation, neither did
they recommend against it. The City Council is responsible for policy, and it is unfortunate
those opposed did not factor that more strongly into their determination. (The council’s latest
vote was 6-3 in favor of adoption.) Planning board members opposed coalesced around
“process”; that we have not yet reached the 5-year mark where a review would be undertaken
of the AHO. However, our housing crisis is getting worse and if there was found a way to do
something that would result in more homes sooner rather than later, I believe there lies a moral
obligation on elected leaders to pursue it and implement it. All other concerns fall away in the
face of the need to take all actions we can.
These amendments in particular, have been backed by the non-profit housing developers to
provide them with one more tool enabling them to be more competitive in the acquisition and
development of sites for 100% affordable housing. We are losing more and more low- and
moderate-income residents every day. We are a city—with room to grow, adapt and embrace
more people and the diversity we say we value.

Thank you.

I am writing to express my strong support for Policy Order 2023 #159
That the City Council go on record in opposition to the Cambridge Police Department and the City of
Cambridge government sending trainees to, participating in any collaborations with, or supporting the
Atlanta Public Safety Training Center or any similar facilities, in any way.
The euphemistically named Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, also known as “Cop City” is a project to tear
down an 85 acre forested area adjacent to Atlanta to erect a simulation police and fire services training center
for local and national uses. Objections to this plan have come from local and national community members,
environmentalists, racial justice advocates, public safety alternative supporters and most recently those
concerned with democracy and civil liberties.
Since 2021, the site has been the subject of public gatherings and protests. Community events including skill
shares, guided hikes, and musical performances have been held. In January 2023, 26-year-old[ nonviolence
protestor Manuel Esteban Paez Teran was fatally shot by police. According to a lawyer working on behalf of
Teran's mother, an independent autopsy revealed "Both Manuel's left and right hands show exit wounds in both
palms. The autopsy further reveals that Manuel was most probably in a seated position, cross-legged when
killed.
The state has raised the level of threats through escalated legal charges to dissuade the peaceful protestors. Five
protestors were arrested in December 2022, and twenty-three protestors were arrested in March 2023, all
charged with domestic terrorism (comparable to the January 6th insurrectionists!) which are felony charges . In
September 2023, sixty one activists affiliated with the Defend the Atlanta Forest group were charged with
racketeering under the national RICO laws used previously for Mafia and other violent criminal affiliations.
Accused of representing outside forces, in June 2023, a coalition of activist groups opposed to the construction
project have petitioned to force a referendum on Cop City. They have obtained the signatures of more than
116,000 Atlanta residents which Atlanta officials are refusing to verify.
While this Cambridge resolution is limited in scope, it is an important measure of solidarity with those seeking
to question Cop City. This is an issue with both enormous impacts on the peoples of Atlanta and also for
national environmental/racial/safety justice/democracy supporting advocates. The fact that it comes from
CRLS students who learned about the situation and wanted to make a difference is even more honorable. As a
decades’ long trainer on nonviolence direct action , one who stands in the long line of those seeking social
change through fierce peaceful means and is touch many trainers involved in the Atlanta protest, I hope the
Council will support them.

In Support of Proposed AHO Amendments

Dear Councilors,
I am a resident of East Cambridge and I strongly support the proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing
Overlay.
The city of Cambridge desperately needs more housing of every type, and thus far housing production in Cambridge has
fallen far short of both the City's goals and the region's needs. The AHO amendments will help expand the creation of
the kind of housing that is most critically missing from our city: units that are attainable to a broad cross section of the
local and regional population.
Cambridge is one of the densest places in all of New England, with comparatively excellent access to transit and services.
This is the ideal community for increased affordable housing density. Furthermore, the establishment of AHO Corridors
and Squares is an intelligent, context-sensitive approach to identifying the places where even greater density is
beneficial and appropriate. These changes will facilitate more private, affordable development; support local legacy
businesses by providing a larger customer base; and enhance the income diversity of our neighborhoods, schools, and
workforce.
As a Cambridge resident and as a professional urban planner and designer, I cannot emphasize enough how valuable
these changes would be. I urge you to vote to adopt these amendments and help fulfill Cambridge's promises and
potential.
Sincerely,
Chris Herlich
139 Otis St.

Please vote IN FAVOR of the AHO Amendments

Dear City Councilors,
Now that the Planning Board has punted to you, I write again to express my very strong support for the proposed
amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay zoning regulations. In briefest terms: WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING IN CAMBRIDGE.
Now that I’m done shouting, please remember the basics: housing is allocated through a market, market prices are
responsive to supply and demand, and hence, the only real way to keep Cambridge housing prices from continuing to
skyrocket is by increasing supply, especially for those without endless gobs of money to spend on housing. The
incredibly long waiting lists for affordable housing here attest quite clearly to the needs, right now, right here.
In addition, density is a positive good for our city—yes, we are a city, not a rural suburban idyll. I hope we can prevent
Cambridge from becoming a mono-class city available only to the deep-pocketed lucky few.
A special thank you to Councilors Azeem, McGovern, Simmons and Zondervan, who have been leading, and continue to
support, this change.
Please increase affordable housing supply and continue to sensitively increase our urban density by supporting the
amendments to the AHO.
Thanks,
Chris Zurn

9/11/23 City Council Agenda - OPPOSITION to AHO Amendment

To the City Clerk:
Please add the following letter (sent to the Planning Commission in August) to the Agenda Packet for tonight's (9/11/23)
City Council meeting.
Thank you.
Dan Tenney
************************************************************
August 29, 2023
To The Cambridge Planning Board:

plannngboardcomments@cambridgema.gov

My name is Daniel Tenney. I am a practicing architect with over 35 years’ experience, and I have lived in Cambridge
for over 40 years. This letter will express my opposition to the proposed Amendments to the Affordable Housing
Overlay (AHO
As the Board is well aware, the original AHO was enacted three years ago. At that time it was a major alteration to
the existing Zoning By-Law, and contained broad provisions intended to foster and accelerate the development of
affordable housing in the City. The AHO was specifically intended to be formally evaluated after 5 years, in 2025.
Instead, we are now presented with a fast-track, radical expansion and re-write of the AHO. This Amendment would
essentially eliminate any current Zoning classifications, dimensional and use controls, and community oversight in an
expanded set of designated AHO squares and corridors.
The proponents of the Amendment have now maneuvered it to a point of near-passage without meaningfully
explaining why it is really needed, except to satisfy the apparent impatience and frustration of affordable-housing
developers. It is a distinctly developer-friendly proposal, and it is distinctly flawed. The Amendment is unlikely to
have a positive long-term effect on the development of truly affordable housing in Cambridge, but will set a powerful,
irresistible example for the future construction of oversized market-rate and commercial projects which will point to
it as precedent.
The proposed AHO Amendment language is undemocratic, radical and deceptive. For example, certain subparagraphs
call for respecting the existing height limits of abutting zoning districts, but then removes this restriction if a proposed
AHO parcel happens to abut a non-residential use. This would apply to virtually any parcel in the designated AHO
squares and many parcels along the AHO corridors.
In June of this year the Community Development Department reported to the City Manager that it had consulted
affordable housing builders (actually developers) with regard to this proposed Amendment, but makes no mention of
any outreach to the citizens, taxpayers and voters of the City who would be adversely affected. This has not been a
transparent process.
The Planning Board certainly understands that changes to the City’s planning and zoning need to be approached
clearly, honestly, openly and deliberatively. The proposed AHO Amendment meets none of those criteria. It is bad
zoning, bad (or absent) planning, and bad public policy. If enacted, it will have negative long-term ramifications for
the character and livability of the City.

The original AHO should remain in effect and be openly and thoughtfully reviewed on its intended 5-year cycle. This

in creating more transparent, inclusive and sustainable ways to promote the development of genuinely affordable
housing in Cambridge and its neighboring communities.

agenda thoughts

Hello all,
I oppose the policy order suggesting amendments that would weaken the AHO proposal before you. I think it would be a
waste of CDDs valuable time to ask them to complete this work over the next few weeks. PO #8 doesn't propose specific
language and the petition itself expires on November 1 - are proponents hoping it will be allowed to expire? Don't forget
about the clock.
I think the framing of PO #5 is completely off base. Why so uncharitable toward unhoused residents of our city? Why
does this order call for the creation of a new task force without even acknowledging the recently completed mayor's ad
hoc working group on homelessness and the recommendations they made which seem to be collecting dust? It seems to
me that proponents may not see the implementation of those recommendations as critical to addressing "issues in
Central Square". Where is the day shelter? Where is the non-emergency response team? Policing and criminalization
isn't going to clean up the square. Most of them are not crooked drug dealers from Mass & Cass, contrary to the
narrative some have pushed. They just have nowhere to go. It is worth noting that one of the recommendations of the
working group was that it should continue meeting on an on-going basis -- and as a reminder, that group had
perspectives from all sides (including three police officers). My suggestion here would be for someone to exercise their
charter right so that proponents can work with two other colleagues to make sure that the language acknowledges the
humanity and the perspective of the unhoused residents, to make sure that we aren't reinventing the wheel with a new
task force when we already have one that just completed its work, and to call for the manager to implement the
recommendations of that task force, using local dollars if necessary, as the primary strategy for "addressing the issues in
Central Square". Remember that unhoused people are experiencing trauma and a struggle for survival on a daily basis.
Our response should reflect that.
I support the affordable homeownership zoning proposal - it certainly needs work like any other zoning proposal does,
but as we seek to "end exclusionary zoning" we need to be thinking about how to generate affordability in projects that
fall under the threshold for inclusionary housing. AHO has proven not to be a tool that will generate much inside the
neighborhoods, so if we don't come up with something else we are essentially conceding that new housing will only be
for the wealthy inside the neighborhoods, which would be a shame. Note that Councillor Zondervan could have
introduced this as a zoning petition but he chose a slower, more collaborative approach and I hope you will not punish
him for doing so. The idea deserves consideration.
Best,
Dan Totten

surely we can do better!

Hi Yi-An,
I'm pretty disappointed that this morning's staff memo was released to councillors a mere 5 minutes before the hearing,
and that it was not made publicly available. The order that passed on June 5th specifically asked for a minimum of 48
hours, and then the hearing was graciously rescheduled over the summer because the staff needed more time. The
memo itself appears to be dated September 8, which would have been a great time to share it publicly. What happened
here? There has to be a way to conduct business in a way that is more respectful of everybody's time. This was not it.
I hope that the council will bring together the legal advocates who drafted this language (pro bono) with the city staff
who proposed the new changes to make sure that what passes will accomplish the intended goals. We aren't doing this
to check a box or to feel good about ourselves, we are doing this to protect residents from discrimination. And yes there
are many residents of our city who would be members of this new protected class. Let's include the legal advocates at
Harvard Law School's LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic and the Polyamory Legal Advocacy Clinic as we move forward. Please?
Thanks to Councillors McGovern, Zondervan, Azeem, Simmons, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Mayor Siddiqui for being
present this morning.
Best,
Dan Totten

In Support of the AHO Amendment

To the Cambridge City Council,
My name is Daniel Blinderman and I am a Cambridge resident and renter. I live at 21 Marcella St., Cambridge, MA 02141.
I am writing to express my strong support for the amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay. There is a grave
shortage of livable, affordable housing in Cambridge. Building more affordable housing will serve our community's
interest and help realize our city's values in the following three ways.
We face a climate crisis. Walkable, dense urban areas served by public transportation are far more efficient and climate
friendly than car-dependent exurbs. By constructing lots of affordable housing, and allowing Camrbdige to grow, we will
create more opportunities for people to live near where they work, to bike, to walk and to ride public transit. All of this
will help facilitate a green transition, and ensure we build a livable, just world for the next generation.
Building more housing and welcoming more people into Cambridge will make our city more dynamic. More people will
mean more small businesses sprouting up in Cambridge and more people employed at jobs that treat them well and pay
them fairly. More people means more students will join our schools. More economic dynamism means more tax
revenue for the city, which means more resources for public transit, public schools and housing. And of course, more
resources for the teachers, bus drivers and city employees who deliver these crucial services every day. More housing
means more prosperity for everyone.
Lastly, building more affordable housing will mean that Cambridge will be a place that embodies democratic equality.
One of my friends recently had to move out of Cambridge because his landlord raised his rent past what he could afford.
I have many other friends and colleagues who would love to live here but cannot afford to do so. Cambridge should not
just be a place for the affluent. It should be a city where anyone who wants to be a part of our community, or already
contributes to our community, can live. To be a democratic and progressive community, we need to make it possible for
us to say "anyone is welcome in Cambridge" without the silent caveat: if you can afford the rent.
I therefore ask the City Council to support the AHO amendments and to pass these amendments into law.
Thank you,
Daniel Blinderman

Strong Support for AHO Amendments

Dear City Council,
As a younger homeowner and resident of Cambridge, I am writing to urge you to support the AHO
amendments being proposed.
Due to what I see as a complete abdication of leadership and political will over the past decade, sustainable
solutions such as legalizing/abetting the construction of housing types that already exists throughout
Cambridge and represents a majority of this city's housing (triple-deckers, mid-rise 4-6 story apartment
buildings) is untenable as a solution, given the nature of the crisis. That isn't to imply that this council can even
agree to do that, because it can't and hasn't.
The situation the city now finds itself in is a problem of its own making, and it is up to you as our elected
leaders to do your job and fix it. Of course, you can vote this down and we can all continue watching families
splinter as children are forced to move away, businesses shutter as they continue to lack people to work shifts,
and essential services wither away as the people who work them get priced out, all to continue to act like
Cambridge is a Levittown rather than the thriving mixed-use, mixed-development City that it always has been.
Frankly, I would much prefer to see zoning reform that celebrates what Cambridge already is rather than
continuing to maintain a zoning code that excludes people and makes most of the city's existing housing
illegal. But that isn't even on the table, so here we are.
I will be closely watching the votes on this issue for the upcoming election.
Thank you,

Thank you David

Cambridge Council -

My name is David; I'm your neighbor on 42 Union St. in Wellington-Harrington. My partner, Leah (CC'd), and I
have engaged the city and neighborhood a few times through a few means concerning parking in our
neighborhood, and now we are trying again as it has reached (and passed) its breaking point.

Both of us commute by foot, bike, T, and car regularly, and we both have professional demands (as well as
basic errands, like groceries) that require we drive our own vehicle. As you may be aware, we do not have a
full grocery store within a mile's radius of our home. We, like many others, sometimes leave
Boston/Cambridge limits for business. We also, like many neighbors, are renters without dedicated, private
parking.

Union Street is a one-way residential street with already extremely limited parking —several spots are
reserved for handicapped drivers, blocked for fire hydrants, or blocked for curbs and defunct
driveways. Regularly, cars and service vehicles park illegally on the left-hand sidewalk or, at times, in the
middle of the road, blocking through-traffic. Select neighbors with multiple vehicles opt for streetside spots
instead of their personal driveways, too, which leaves us with even fewer options.

We have had several services refuse delivery/work because of parking/congestion issues on our street, and
fulfilling basic home maintenance has become very difficult. Today, we had somebody visit our home for
maintenance — at 10:30 am on a weekday — and there was not a single spot within a walkable radius for
them to park.

Where parking already has been extremely difficult, now it simply is unachievable. There seems to be a
severe lack of coordination and communication among the different players restricting parking.

Today, Cambridge DPW had street sweeping, which removed all parking on Union St and all odd-sided
parking on neighboring streets from 8 AM to 2 PM. Traffic Enforcement made multiple rounds on our street to
issue $50 tickets to violators. I saw three people on my street sitting in their cars, parked with their motors on
because they did not want to get a ticket but they literally had nowhere else to go.

Meanwhile, and with 0 days notice, Eversource — a non-government operated energy supplier — has
blocked all parking spots on both sides of Lincoln St (an intersecting cross-street) for two months —
which eliminates at least 20 additional spaces.

There has been ongoing construction on Windsor, which has cut an additional 5-30 spots, depending on the
day, for weeks now.

And, perhaps most consequentially, the CSO has eliminated over 30 spots permanently from our
neighboring blocks of Hampshire Street.

That's not to mention tree-trimming without warning over the past three weeks on Union and Hampshire, nor
the myriad of spots blocked in recent weeks for moving vans.

Not only have literally hundreds of spots in Wellington-Harrington been interrupted or eliminated, but the
same amount of people with vehicles as before are competing for the few spots that do remain.

Today I called Parking Enforcement and DPW to ask if our service vendor could park on our street once it
appeared the sweeper had serviced it. Parking Enforcement hung up on me without responding to
my question, and DPW told me to "use my discretion" without providing any useful insight.

I fully support safety for bikers, robust public transit, traffic reduction, and a move toward a city with fewer gasemitting vehicles. But the reality is that real people — specifically, people who cannot afford homes with
private driveways and do not have the luxury to work from home — are being crushed by these sudden,
uncoordinated, overlapping parking reductions and eliminations.

For our part, on nearly a daily basis — even when one of us is home during business hours — we are lucky to
find parking within half a mile.

It appears as though we have no sitting members from 02141, and so I hope you will consider the full context

I'd appreciate replies suggesting whether you've considered my note and whether we might expect any
reprieve from this exceptional, unlivable inconvenience.

I am sharing with you comments I will provide at tonight’s City Council mee•ng regarding the proposed amendment to
the AHO. I look forward to con•nuing to work with you on this. Thanks you for your a•en•on and interest.

Good evening,
My name is David Webster.
I am a Senior Project Manager of B’nai B’rith Housing.
I am speaking on Commi•ee Reports #2, the proposed amendments to the A•ordable Housing Overlay District.
As some of you may be aware, B’Nai B’rith recently acquired a parcel on Blanchard Road for the purpose of
developing a•ordable senior housing. The A•ordable Housing Overlay Zoning has been a cri•cal element of our decision
to pursue this opportunity. Cambridge needs a•ordable senior housing and we are about to embark on a process to
sa•sfy that need on this site. We have had preliminary conversa•ons with neighbors and City sta• and are in the midst
of scheduling a Community mee•ng early next month to share our ideas and solicit community feedback.
We recently discovered that one of the amendments to the AHO Zoning Ordinance being considered by the City Council
would have a seriously detrimental impact on our ability to pursue our project.
I am referring to the proposed paragraph (d) to Sec•on 11.207.5.1. Under this amendment, an AHO Project that is
located in more than one base zoning district would be developed pursuant to the dimensional standards of the zoning
district that covers the largest percentage of the parcel, as if the en•re lot was located in that zoning district.
We recognize that this and other amendments that are under considera•on were proposed in order to further facilitate
the development of a•ordable housing. However, for our parcel, this amendment would have the opposite e•ect,
resul•ng in a project with far fewer a•ordable units that the current AHO zoning would allow.

provision in such a way that would allow those projects that are not enhanced by this change to be able to proceed
under the base zoning district as is currently the case.

Separated bike lanes

Dear City Councillors,
As much as I love outdoor dining and hope to see even more of it in future years, what I really value is separated bike
lanes. They feel much, much safer than painted bike lanes running along the road. Despite signage, cars park in painted
bike lanes, veer into them, and trucks routinely unload in them. If we want to encourage more cycling in Cambridge, we
have to make new cyclists feel like they're not risking their lives.
Please keep going with separated bike lanes!
With many thanks,

Dear Council Members,
I urge your support for outdoor dining and the continued prioritization of separated bike lanes over paint-only

In support of Solar Requirement Green Roofs Amendment

Dear City Councilors,
As a Cambridge resident, a mother of two young children, and a member of Mothers Out Front, I write in sport of the
Solar Requirement Green Roofs Amendment by Nolan and Zondervan.
Our city needs to do all it can to keep Cambridge a healthy and livable city for future generations. Green roofs help cool
down buildings and improve our air quality, among other things, and they are fully compatible with solar systems. They
actually make solar even more efficient because they help cool down the panels.
Please invest in our children's future and pass this amendment, it's a step in the direction of climate resiliency that all
residents will benefit from.
Thanks for your hard work,

City Council; City Manager; City Clerk; Planning Board Comment
Please VOTE NO on AHO 2.0/ Please VOTE YES to retain Cambridge Historical Society

Dear City Councillors,
Please VOTE NO on AHO 2.0:
Reasons as outlined below:
•

The AHO 2.0 is not proposed in our Envision Report. The review of AHO 1.0 has not
yet been undertaken.
• The model of 12-15 story income-restricted towers is a model from the 1950s and 1960s
that is no longer supported by urban planners. Many of these now are being taken
down in other communities.
• Greater density also will lead to the increasing heat island factors we are facing in the
city – negatively impacting health and other considerations in our denser
neighborhoods.
• The AHO 2.0 developments will be done without design oversight, setbacks, or parking.
Note the Planning Board is excluded from any oversight role in these decisions. Their
views are only advisory.
• The pre-AHO Frost Terrace complex that people often cite was created with both
strong neighborhood and Planning Board input. It was created prior to the AHO.
• We need for city-owned land to be used for this purpose - then leased to developers.
• AHO units are now sometimes costing nearly $1 million apiece, nearly double what
market rate units. Here too there is no oversight.
• We also need to use city money for these developments so that we can focus on
housing our own city residents. There is scarcer Federal and State funding and the
AHO process is framed around this funding, which also means that 2/3 of the
applicants on the AHO lists are not city residents.
•

Secondly, please VOTE YES to retain the Cambridge Historic Society/ Neighborhood Conservation Districts.
Reasons as outlined below:

Issues on gutting of architectural preservation guidelines (Neighborhood Conservation
Districts – NCDs).
• Cambridge

is an historic city. Historic buildings are a key part of its charm and
livability. Even though we are a very dense city (4th-5th most dense city in the country
with a population over 100,000.
• Our historic homes are also the most naturally affordable housing in the city.

no longer require parking, and without the requisite setbacks a new structure or
addition could expand directly against the property lines.
• To destroy historic buildings to create far larger structures (labs, McMansions or other
homes) without design oversight on new heights or setbacks will dramatically
transform our neighborhoods and is potentially problematic for neighbors and
neighborhoods alike.
• This move will also be highly destructive for the environment – filling dump sites and
requiring the cutting down of more trees, in addition to the energy expenses of
manufacturing new materials.
I wrote this email to the City Of Cambridge Planning Board on 8/25/23:
Dear Planning Board Members,
I wrote this letter individually to the City of Cambridge City Councillors in an effort to have them VOTE NO on AHO 2 to
no avail. I am so hoping our historic city will not be negatively affected by this failed, outdated 50's-60's urban design
that other cities are tearing down as I type. What a waste of money!
Please read below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MY VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTION DEPENDS ON THIS CRITICAL CITY PLANNING AHO 2.0 VOTE.: VOTE NO on the
AHO 2.0 and support the Cambridge Historic Preservation Society.
Our quality of life depends on it!
The current AHO 1.0 is doing a great job of integrating historic buildings with Affordable Housing projects that will
house 3,000-3,500 current Cambridge residents seeking affordable housing, with future plans/ newly added funding to
purchase new properties for the total of 7,000 city residents/workers seeking affordable housing with the current input
from the local residents, the Cambridge Planning Board and the Cambridge City Urban Design Group. THIS IS GOOD
NEWS!!! Cambridge DESERVES a comprehensive city-wide Affordable Housing strategy that promotes good urban
design, supported by Non-profit Affordable Housing developers.
Supporting poor urban design that catapults the City of Cambridge, already the fourth to fifth most dense city in the
USA for our population size, into an even denser city spells DISASTER IN THE MAKING!!! This is NOT GOOD
NEWS! OUR CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER AND SO DO THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE LIVING IN 12 TO 15 STORY
BUILDINGS, with no parking and diminished green space, as unequivocally required in other Cambridge city-wide
building projects.
Is this the legacy the current Cambridge City Councillors want to impart to our beloved, historic Cambridge? I hope
not!
We need to go back to BLOCK by BLOCK, NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD to ensure lower income residents have
decent homes and the chance to build equity. These families deserve better design and planning, just like Cambridge
requires for all other builders in our fair city. Massive towers will cut off light and air quality for all the residents who
live either beside or near these 12 and 15 story buildings, not to mention the commercial enterprises that will encounter
less business as they will be dwarfed and diminished by these towers.
My understanding to date is that Cambridge residents have yet to see the data on actual current city resident needs
or that AHO 1.0 is not working as planned. If AHO 1.0 was not working, why would the AHO 2.0 use the existing 5 story
affordable housing development near Porter Square, with 3 historic homes as its “POSTER CHILD”? Isn’t this considered
false advertising?

Lastly, we need the City of Cambridge Historical Society, as never before, in the wake of this move to demolish and

NO on the new AHO

Dear Members of the Council,

I urge you to vote no on the rushed and ill‐considered revisions to the AHO. The original AHO has a built‐in review
process a er 5 years; and there is nothing to keep the City from beginning that assessment now, with more informa on
available every year. But no meaningful assessment has been done and now you are considering throwing every tenet of
good urban design out the window.
If the AHO is failing as you seem to think it is, perhaps you should look at the deeper causes. One obvious factor is the
lack of oversight on costs.
Where is the Council when it comes to audi ng the absurd costs run up by poorly managed projects in the City? And
housing projects across the country, even fully permi ed ones, are languishing thanks to the highest interest rates in 22
years.
To a hammer, everything is a nail. And to some members of Council, every issue requires tearing out the heart of the City
in order to build bigger, not be er, buildings.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Houghteling

Update - Committee Report #2 - Do Not Accept Ordinance Committee's
Recommendation on AHO Petition
Affordable Housing Comparison.pdf

Dear All,
I do not know the outcome of the AHO Zoning Amendment Petition at last night's meeting but because I still felt that
this issue is being debated without full facts, I decided to compare states Chapter 40B and Cambridge's AHO Zoning
Ordinance (AHO ZO). Please see the attached result.
A startling revelation, at least to me, is that since AHO ZO was adopted in October 2020, just under 3 years ago, a

total of 616 100% affordable units to be deed restricted in perpetuity are in the pipeline. In my letter (see
below) to the City Council, I suggested that the goal of Envision Cambridge for new affordable housing units to
be built from 2019 to 2030, a span of 12 years, should be 1724 new SHI units based on 25% growth of SHI
units based on 2020 census data. Extrapolating the number of AHO rental units over 3 years, AHO as is
currently in the books, would produce 2,464 100% affordable units deed restricted in perpetuity. This
exceeds my suggested goal and is 78% of the currently stated Envision Cambridge goal. This shows that AHO
as currently ordained is working! I certainly hope you find this analysis startling as well.
I highly recommend 100 Percent Affordable Housing Overlay - CDD - City of Cambridge, Massachusetts
(cambridgema.gov) be updated to include the total number of AHO units in the pipeline.

Respectfully,
Young Kim

Dear Mayor, City Councillors and City Clerk,

In Committee Report #2, Cambridge City Council’s Ordinance
Committee recommended favorably the Affordable Housing Overlay
(AHO) Petition. On the other hand, Planning Board “(m)embers agreed to
provide only comments on the proposed changes, noting concerns such
as whether changed guidelines would cast neighborhoods in shadow
from taller buildings and questioning whether the council should wait for
the original AHO’s built-in five-year review as reported by Cambridge
Day.
Before you deliberate on the proposed amendments, please consider misconceptions of AHO
Zoning Ordinance (ZO) and the unattainable goal in the Envision Cambridge Final Plan that is
driving these amendments. In addition to this letter, you will find my correspondences on this
Petition in the Agenda Packet (Communications 146, 166 , 169; July 31, 2023 public comment at
the Ordinance Committee meeting, pg. 2691)
First is that the developers will abide by the intention of AHO ZO and voluntarily incorporate
public comments and the Planning Board’s (PB’s) advisory review recommendations. If you
adopt these amendments against the PB’s concerns, it will send a loud and clear message to them
that they, too, can go against PB review recommendations for the sake of the critical need of
affordable housing.
The second is that because "AHO Dwelling Units shall be created and conveyed subject to
recorded covenants approved by CDD guaranteeing the permanent availability of the AHO
Dwelling Units for AHO Eligible Households (see Note 1)," only non-profit developers will
utilize AHO. State’s Chapter 40B limits a for-profit developer to be a limited dividend entity to
guard against excessive profit and requires binding state funding agency’s Project Eligibility
review and Board of Zoning Appeal’s (BZA’s) Comprehensive Permit (CP) Review. In spite of
these more stringent requirements, at least one for-profit developer, CC HRE, found ways to
circumvent them to make 100% affordable housing development In Cambridge financially
feasible long before AHO was adopted (see notes 2,3) in October 2020. For 2072 Mass Ave
project, CC HRE went out of their way to state "(t)he affordability will be in perpetuity" in the CP
Application when Chapter 40B only required use restriction (as described in GUIDELINES
(mass.gov)) that is not in perpetuity. But when they threatened to reject the application if they

did not reduce density, they withdrew their application rather than complying. Please beware of
unintended consequences of developers misusing amended AHO ZO that would destroy the
vision created by “Envision Cambridge, the blueprint for the future of our city.”
Envision Cambridge Final Plan set the “(s)hare of new housing produced in Cambridge (between
2019 – 2030) that is dedicated as affordable” to 25% or “minimum of 3,175 net new affordable
housing units” which mean one out of every four NEW houses built should be affordable If this
was the true goal, yes, I agree we need a shotgun approach and build 12-15 story buildings
scattered helter-skelter throughout the main corridors and squares destroying the vision of the
future Cambridge.
The Subsidized Housing Inventory (SHI), dated 6/29/2023, lists 53,467 Year-Round Housing
Units of which 6,896 are SHI Units, or 12.9%, for Cambridge based on 2020 census data. Is
adding almost 50% more SHI units in 12 years a realistic goal? Or did Envision Cambridge
intended SHI units to grow at the same rate as total housing units or about 25% growth in that
period which would be more modest 1724 new SHI units. This could be achieved by more
nuanced, targeted approach that would seamlessly fit into the overall Envision Cambridge
vision. Please wait until AHO’s built-in five-year review before making any amendments.
Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim

Thank You - An example of an apparent House Doctor Contract in Action

Dear Mayor, City Councillors, City Manager and City Clerk,
I know I have written countless times to bring up issues that need your attention. But this morning, I am writing to
thank you and the City for a prompt service.
A sewer repair was starting up this morning on Norris Street and I had quite an interesting talk with one of the crew. It
turned out the repair was to fix a sinkhole that the City discovered (I don't know if this was reported on SeeClickFix or
discovered by DPW crew) and had placed a steel plate over it temporarily. Apparently, due to recent heavy rains, many
such sinkholes have been occuring and he mentioned there are several others in the vicinity of Norris Street. And also
judging from the conversation, this company has a "House Doctor" service contract to fix them. This is a great example
of how House Doctor contracts should work whereas the Designer Service House Doctor contracts cover way too broad
territory from engineering support for separated bike lanes to facilitating CSO Implementation Advisory Group, by the
same contractor no less.
So, thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the great services City is providing that I just can't thank individually,
Respectfully your,
Young Kim

I am here today as a former resident of Cambridge, on Wendell St., and as a concerned community member. I
am here to show my deep support of Policy Order #159 and of this council actively condemning the
construction of Cop City. I am here to say that Cambridge must not send its police department to this proposed
Cop City or to any other similar training facility; this community and this council must not support acts of
harm that perpetuate the climate crisis and injustice.
Any officers sent to the proposed Cop City would be trained to be more violent, more militaristic, and more
devastating to our community; they would be training within earshot of a high school, where students could
hear shots fired, and this would only normalize the use of guns around our youth and all our neighbors. As
Kwame Olufemi of Community Movement Builder wrote, “the facility includes shooting ranges, plans for
bomb testing, and [those there] will practice tear gas deployment.” These are not necessary. Police involved in
this training will be learning how to hurt this community, and we know that the anti-Blackness and classism
ingrained in our society means that Black people and other people of color, poor people, and our unhoused
neighbors will feel the brunt of this harm. This is absolutely unacceptable. Cambridge cannot send the police
to this cop training facility, or any other one across the country.
I am also here today as someone who, while living in Cambridge, went to Atlanta to stand in solidarity with
Stop Cop City. I have seen the damage already caused by the little construction that has been completed. I saw
torrential downpours that sent soil from the razed forest areas all throughout the city, but that is just the
beginning of what would happen if Cop City construction were to continue. The immediate impact of that
deforestation would be devastating for air quality and general safety, but we know that the climate crisis is
borderless - the impact of removing that carbon sink would be devastating for all of us. To support Cop City is
to support the continuation of climate catastrophe and that is not in the spirit of this council and its
constituents.

to you, namely
One - that the developers will abide by the intention of affordable housing overlay zoning
ordinance and voluntarily incorporate public comments and the Planning Board’s advisory

Two – that only non-profit developers will utilize Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning because of
deed restrictions in perpetuity to keep the Affordable Housing Overlay Dwelling Units available
for Eligible Households. But CC HRE, for one, found ways to circumvent more stringent State’s
Chapter 40B guidelines to make 100% affordable housing development In Cambridge financially
feasible long before Affordable Housing Overlay was adopted in October 2020 even
guaranteeing the affordability in perpetuity" for 2072 Mass Ave. project, when Chapter 40B
didn’t require use restriction in perpetuity.
Three – that Envision Cambridge Final Plan’s goal of “minimum of 3,175 net new affordable
housing units” will mean one out of every four NEW houses built should be affordable and will
increase Cambridge’s Subsidized Housing Inventory units by almost 50%.

Proposed AHO Amendment "AHO 2.0" (Affordable Housing Ordinance)

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,
Please reconsider your support for proposed AHO 2.0 Amendment. Give the decision making process more
time. The potential negative consequences of this amendment are extreme. At your August meeting, Councilor
Carlone’s Actions proposed ways forward that would allow for a more informed outcome.
I understand that the “proposal guts the city’s longstanding architectural preservation policies; this ordinance
would disallow any discussion of height or setbacks in any building discussion before the commissions citywide, and would replace professionals with non-professionals on these committees.”(HSNA).
The potential outcome of the City’s proposals should generate cheers not tears.

Correction - Committee Report #2 - Do Not Accept Ordinance Committee's
Recommendation on AHO Petition

Dear All,

My apologies but I left out a key word in my earlier email.
I stated that "State’s Chapter 40B limits a for-profit developer to be a dividend entity." In trying to
shorten my letter, I inadvertently left out a key word. The sentence should have read "State’s
Chapter 40B limits a for-profit developer to be a limited dividend entity" as I have corrected in red
below.
Thank you for your understanding,

your consideration on housing projects and historic preservation

Dear members of the Cambridge City Council:
Cambridge is an attractive place to live because it has distinct neighborhoods each with its own
character. The Cambridgeport area has managed to preserve the neighborhood scale and found a good
balance between old and new. Another city asset is the well preserved historic areas. They lend
character and continuity. Let's not look at all of Cambridge solely as creating more opportunities for
luxury developments.
I am wholeheartedly in favor of densification along the major corridors and around transit hubs. I'm
also in favor of
requiring a percentage of affordable units in any new development of 4 units or more. I strongly
suggest a windfall
tax on value created by upzoning or rezoning. The windfall tax should be earmarked for subsidies to
encourage low income and affordable housing.
Please do not curtail the role of historic preservation as an essential ingredient for ensuring that
Cambridge maintains the very things that make the city so liveable.
Sincerely
Urs Gauchat

supporting separated bike lanes, and a harrowing incident

Dear City Council,
I am writing in support of separated bike lanes.
I am a 60-year-old bike commuter who uses the dedicated bike lanes seven days a week. While the painted bikes
lanes are better than nothing, they do not provide bicyclists protection from motorists. Here is first-hand evidence:
On three separate occasions in the past four months, I have had motorists drive into the painted bike lanes. On two
of those incidents the driver cut in front of me forcing me to brake and maneuver out of the bike lane into traffic, thus
seriously endangering me. The third incident, the automobile was parked in the bike lane obstructing the entire lane.
When I politely informed the driver who was seated in the parked car, he first threatened to harm me, then exited the
vehicle and proceeded to threaten to kill me. I immediately lifted my bike onto the sidewalk and fled the scene.
Please understand that outdoor dining and separated bike lanes can exist together. This is not an either-or situation.

George Soule

Hello!
In reflecting in the recent policy order on combining outdoor dining installations with separated bike lanes, I just to take
a moment to advise you that while I do support outdoor dining and would love to see more it is also imperative that
we continue to support separated bike lanes rather than paint-only bike lanes, as the latter are significantly less safe.
Paint is not adequate protection, and should not be considered as part of this policy order.

I urge the City Council to adopt the AHO amendments WITHOUT DELAY. I have spoken in the past in support of the AHO
and will not repeat my comments here. The AHO amendments are only one tool to assist in mee•ng the a•ordable
housing crisis. We have very li•le land to u•lize for building new all a•ordable housing and these amendments will allow
us to increase units while preserving as much open space as possible.
I also urge the Council to increase funding for a•ordable housing, both rental and home ownership. We have a one
billion dollar budget and a•ordable housing funding must be increased.
I note that there are last minute a•empts to delay the vote by again raising unfounded fears about the impact of the
AHO amendments and by a•emp•ng to suggest that AHO supporters are not commi•ed to valuable resources such as
open space. Nothing can be further from the truth.
Vote for the AHO amendments on September 11!

Support for physically separated bike lanes

Hi City Council members,
I am writing about the Policy Order on the agenda for Monday about combining outdoor dining installations with
separated bike lanes.
I love outdoor dining and would like to see more, but it must be done in combination with physically separated bike
lanes. Paint is not adequate protection.
I am an 8 year and counting Cambridge resident who uses my bicycle as my primary mode of transit. Too many of my
friends have been hit or doored by cars while they were cycling in Cambridge, and physically separated bike lanes make
us all safer. For example, one of my friends sustained a concussion while cycling home from her research lab at MIT on
Main Street between Ames St. and Vassar St. Though she was going slowly, a car door opened suddenly in front of her,
causing her to fall off her bike and sustain a concussion, significantly disrupting her PhD research at MIT and preventing
her from participating in upcoming athletic events at MIT. Physically separated bike lanes would have kept her safe.
I encourage Cambridge to increase outdoor dining opportunities such as those found at Veggie Galaxy on Mass Ave in
Central (outdoor dining with jersey barriers to separate the bike lane from traffic) and Pammy's, also on Mass Ave (flex
posts separating the bike lane from traffic).
I love outdoor dining, but I will not patronize places where outdoor dining has come at the expense of potential bodily
injury for cyclists like me. Ahead of the election this fall I am excited to see Cambridge continue to make gains in
separated bike lane infrastructure.

please support AHO amendments

Dear City Councillors,
The AHO and their amendments are necessary for affordable-housing developers to compete with for-profit
companies. Additional units have been unable to be built because of the current AHO height restrictions.
One example I find particularly heartbreaking is 116 Norfolk Street (under development through Cambridge
Housing Authority).
116 Norfolk St. provides supportive housing to chronically-homeless individuals. Some chronically homeless
people have very serious mental illnesses and they are a particular population that usually thrives in supported
housing. Many are unable to engage in services they need while un-housed because their everyday focus is on
survival. When street teams finally gain their trust, the window of opportunity to house them is very small.
Even just one extra story on this property would have meant a difference to about 15 people. These individuals
are sick through no fault of their own. A broken and severely under-funded mental health system combined with
a lack of available affordable housing leaves this vulnerable population forgotten. They are too ill to fight for
themselves.
That is merely one example of the people-aspect of why these amendments are necessary. Please hear their
voices and help them attain a chance for peace and comfort through secure housing.
Thank you,

Outdoor Dining and CSO - Re Monday's Agenda

can and should have both of these in plentiful supply in our city.
An extensive network of protected, well-connected bike lanes is key to safe, sustainable transportation. I regularly bike
to outdoor dining locations. Both are good business sense and both are a better use of our limited space than subsidized
private car storage.

Cycling Safety Ordinance Changes - Against Paint-only Bike Lanes

Good morning,
I heard about the suggested changes to the Cycling Safety Ordinance and wanted to voice my opinion from the
perspective of both a biker and a driver.
Separated bike lanes are a huge benefit to both cyclistsand drivers. By physically separating cars from cyclists, separated
bike lanes add another layer of protection to bikers and dissuade drivers from suddenly pulling into or parking in bike
lanes. The latter also means bikers are less likely to be suddenly forced into traffic. As a result, drivers benefit from
separated bike lanes by keeping bikers in one space, allowing drivers to focus on other cars and the road itself rather
than worrying about an errant cyclist.
I've also found that paint-only bike lanes are particularly more dangerous in areas with shifting traffic patterns. As traffic
weaves and winds around construction, dining areas, and unique intersections, cars tend to pull into bike lanes as
needed to avoid other cars, stopped Uber/Lyft/Doordash/etc drivers, or even to keep their path as simple as possible.
Separated bike lanes protect cyclists in areas where drivers are already distracted, and actually simplify complex traffic
patterns by dictating exactly where drivers and bikers should stay.
Cyclists will bike in areas they feel most safe - by implementing separated bike lanes into outdoor dining
plans, cyclists who ride in those areas are more likely to stop and shop, contributing to the vibrant local
economy that Cambridge thrives off of. Cyclists are much less likely to bike in regions that feel unsafe, and
particularly less likely to stop in those regions. Paint-only bike lanes, with shifting traffic patterns used in many
outdoor dining plans, put bikers at risk and discourage them from stopping to explore the outdoor dining they
just passed.
Outdoor dining and cyclist safety are two great causes that Cambridge has put so much into already. As a
cyclist, a driver, and a big fan of outdoor dining, I believe that these two can be done well, simultaneously,
without taking from the other. In fact, separated bike lanes protect cyclists, protect drivers, simplify changing
traffic patterns, and promote a vibrant community and economy around outdoor dining areas.
Please consider keeping separated bike lanes in these new changes to outdoor dining plans.
Best,
Tatiana

PO on outdoor dining and bicycle infrastructure

Hello all,
Thank you for the hard work and persistent effort you all put into making Cambridge such a wonderful city to live in. I
very much appreciate that you all are trying to find better ways to utilize our public spaces by devoting more of the
street space to pedestrians, micro-mobility users, and outdoor diners rather than for cars. As a car owner myself, I
actually really appreciate that the roads are being designed for slower speeds and better safety. Because of all the great
bicycle infrastructure, I tried biking around Cambridge and found it to be a wonderful experience. I now do most of my
business in Cambridge and by bicycle or public transit. Through this process, I have also become a more patient and
safer driver as I now understand the fear that many cyclists have while biking through the parts of our greater Boston
area without protected lane infrastructure.
I am very supportive of efforts to expand outdoor dining and crate more space for the people of our community that is
devoid of cars. With that in mind, there should never be a reason to sacrifice safety to provide outdoor dining to small
businesses. Outdoor dining must be safe for both the diners and the vulnerable road users and if only one of the two can
can exist, we must choose lives over livelihoods. It is not acceptable to have a paint only lane to accommodate outdoor
dining. There must always be vertical bolards, concrete barriers or curbs that prevent vehicles from entering the lane.
Compromises have already been made for bus stops and accessible parking which puts pedestrian safety above the
safety of those using micro-mobility methods, but outdoor dining is a luxury not a necessity. It hurts to bike around the
city and see Jersey Barriers protecting diners while the cycle lane is completely exposed to traffic. It is as if the city is
saying that there is one group worthy of being protected because they bring money to our local economy, but the
people using the cycling lanes are not worth protecting because they do not. This is far from the truth.
This war between small businesses and the effort to build safe cycling infrastructure is tiresome. The cyclists are not
calling for roads to be closed or for cars to be banished from Cambridge. There is already compromise in that they are
calling for one measley lane built in the quickest and cheapest way. Still it has taken almost a decade since the plan was
originally put together. It is not okay to compromise safety. As a former paramedic and having been in the first
responder community, the first rule was always to ensure your own safety before giving care because even when others
are in danger it is not okay to compromise safety. Why then would we compromise the safety of our vulnerable road
users to accommodate outdoor dining. We must have both.
I am calling on the council members to put themselves, their families, their children on bikes to commute around
Cambridge instead of using their cars. If they truly feel that it is safe for their families, then maybe I am wrong here, but I
find it difficult to believe that anyone would feel comfortable biking next to their 10 year old through the streets of
Cambridge.
Support small business and outdoor dining, but do not compromise safety to do so for any reason. Paint isn't
protection.

Five Yays and Four Nays for today's City Council meeting

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
Five Yays and Four Nays for Today’s City Council meeting:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Please support the plaque to honor Denise Simmons’ daughter on a city hall bench.
Please support the policy order to Improve Central Square
Please support the ordinance on maintaining trees.
Please support the Nolan petition for non-gas-powered lawn equipment
Please support the Toner and Nolan amendment to the AHO 2.0 petition.
Please oppose the massive city-wide upzoning AHO 2.0 amendment. The Planning Board was not in
support; one pointed out that it appears to have been written specifically to add more tall towers in
East Cambridge specifically.
a. Please ask the City Manager also to reconcile key differences between this petition and the
city’s environmental ordinance(s) before it is passed.
b. It was a real mistake to end parking minimums, because that is one of the things that allowed
affordable housing developers to compete with market rate ones. And what did we get out of
this? Fewer vehicles? No. But more building mass means more heat island impacts, and most of
these larger new luxury homes keep parking because the developers can sell them for more.
c. We should not be allowing For Profit affordable housing developers to receive the same “deal”
as non-profits. How many other cities do that? Why are affordable housing units at Jefferson
Park costing nearly $1 million, nearly double what market rate units cost and without the need
to acquire land?
d. Why are we not requiring regular independent surveys of affordable housing tenants. We are
learning that sometimes (as at Walden Square) are really terrible.
e. Why are we not being transparent about the numbers. Cambridge unlike other cities does not
remove anyone from its affordable housing list OR require yearly renewal. We likely have many
(most?) on those lists who have already found homes here or elsewhere. We need to get our
house in order and be far more transparent.
f. Not every avenue or part of a square is conducive to tall housing complexes 12 and 15 stories.
Planning must be done on a block-by-block basis.
g. We must require our universities and large commercial employers to provide housing for their
affiliates (students, post docs, staff) in the area along with related transportation.
h. Can’t we do something about investors buying so much property here – too often leaving them
empty because property values go up c.8% here no matter what the circumstances.
7. Please oppose the gutting of our architectural preservation policies (NCDs). The only reason anyone
would want to remove height and setbacks from preservation discussion is to make it as easy as
possible for any developer or investor from anywhere to build whatever they want here, however they
want be it another McMansion, larger lab building – you name it. Before voting, please also contact

Denise Jillson of HSBA who will be happy to explain why and how the Harvard Square Conservation
District works so well – we are getting greatly designed new buildings here – why? Because the
building owners and architects are getting a lot of CHC and other neighborhood and professional input.
a. Our older buildings remain among the most environmentally sustainable – and they provide the
most naturally affordable housing in the city.
b. It is a lie to suggest that our zoning laws and red lining were based on race in Cambridge. We
are and were a city of factories and the pollution that they caused was a serious health risk to
the neighborhood, so it is those neighborhoods that were largely red-lined. Some of our most
important black neighborhoods were and are in West Cambridge (the Fresh Pond area is one
such example). Lewisville was another.
8. Please oppose the Zondervan zoning petition on replacement housing. There are some interesting
things in it (included also in CCC’s Advancing Housing Affordability Petition in 2022 (the Donovan
Petition), but NO MORE HOUSING-LINKED ZONING PETITIONS should be done without a real plan in
place that addresses issues of design standards, infrastructure, preserving our still sustainable housing
and more.
Cordially,
Suzanne Blier

I support protected bike lanes & outdoor dining in Cambridge!

Hello Council members,
I am writing to ask you to support outdoor dining in Cambridge, with even more capacity, and flexible designs, and keep
separate bike lanes with protective barriers instead of paint only lanes. I bike through Cambridge and Massachusetts
Avenue often. I know that the most dangerous parts of my ride are in the paint-only bike lanes where cars and trucks
park in the bike lane, forcing bikers into traffic, or risk being doored. Outdoor dining and protected bike lanes can coexist
and enhance one another. Please keep and expand the existing protected bike lane network - they are truly the only way
to keep cyclists safe. And allow them to work in cohesion with outdoor dining with flexible designs.
Thank you for the attention to this important matter and I look forward to enjoying Cambridge as a bike-friendly,
restaurant-friendly space.

Support for protected bike lanes around outdoor dining

Hello,
I'd like to write in strong support that the CSO requirements to provide safe bike facilities throughout the city are not
degraded using the excuse of outdoor dining. Outdoor dining is amazing and we as a city should be working diligently to
build a lively city, which outdoor dining is a critical component of. However, we should absolutely not make the city
more dangerous in this pursuit, especially since we already have numerous examples throughout the city of how to
create wonderful outdoor dining experiences while maintaining or enhancing the safety of adjacent bike lanes.
Pitting outdoor dining against safe travel is a false dichotomy and this effort should be acknowledged for what it is, an
trojan horse to start weakening the highly successful CSO from continuing to make the city safer for the city's residents
as they travel throughout the city via bike.
Thank you,
Scott Kilcoyne

A no vote is the only reasonable response to AHO2

I am in disbelief that it is predicted that a supermajority ofCambridge City Coucil is planning on voting yes to
the AHO2 proposal.
I want you to know that I and many other like minded citizens and tax payers of Cambridge plan to work
against the re-election of any Councilor who votes in favor of this proposal that strips away any ability of the
citizens or relevant governmental bodies to influence the design and building of affordable housing in
Cambridge.
AHO2 gives 100% control to the developers. I fully appreciate that developers need to have a reasonable
return on their investment but as they demonstrated in their interactions with neighborhood residents
regarding the Walden Street project, they resent that neighbors expect developers to listen to and make a
good faith effort to respond to their requests. I believe that a majority of the Council must believe that asking
developers to work with the community is an undue burden. I know that is not the case. Citizens of
Cambridge see the need for more affordable housing development. However I and many others resent that
council is about to turn over all control to those who will profit from maximizing development without regard
to green space, parking, and set backs.
As one who has genuine concern of the impact of the proposal being considered tonight, I refuse to accept
being called a privileged old white guy. To ignore what at least 50% of Cambridge's population see as wrong
headed and the advice and concerns raised by the governmental agencies who are charged with developing
policy and guidelines for affordable housing is the height of arrogance.
I implore you one last time, vote no to AHO2.

Keep protected bike lanes!

Hi City Council and City Manager Huang,
I'm writing to ask you to continue to support the construction of protected bike lanes as called for in the CSO.
Just yesterday I was walking my 9yo and 6yo to school along Cambridge Street, and I saw two middle school kids biking
responsibly in the painted bike line, and right next to them was an enormous construction truck. I have taught my own
kids to bike safely in the street, but it really gave me pause when seeing these two kids just feet away from such a
deadly machine.
There is just no way that we can achieve our goals for bike friendliness and bike safety without protected bike lanes. As a
city, we have reaffirmed our support for the CSO many times, and I hope you will continue this support.
Best,
Sam

Support for the amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay zoning by-laws

I strongly support the amendments to the Affordable
Housing Overlay zoning by-laws. The amendments are essential to end
exclusionary zoning, create more affordable housing and preserve
economic diversity.
I say this as a homeowner and business owner in Cambridge since 1985. I also say this as a parent of two now
young adults. Growing up they saw classmates forced out of Cambridge. Now at 27 and 31 - one is in a public
interest job. Neither can afford to live in the city in which they spent their entire lives. These youn google with jobs so
are better off than many - but we need to make our city open to all.

re: 11 September 2023 Committee Report #2/ POR 2023 #156
Dear City Councilors,
These amendments will provide a flexibility to AHO developments in very limited areas of
Cambridge. Refusing to allow limited increases in height in the proposed areas is a very backward way of
defining this City and residents.
The CHA development at 116 Norfolk Street would have been allowed to add some height/additional
units and provide more open space. The current AHO zoning did not allow for that kind of configuration
and limited the supportive housing Cambridge is in dire need of to serve its residents.
I thank you for your attention to this issue and hope you will vote favorably tonight.

Please do NOT PASS the NCD AMENDMENTS

9-9-23
Dear City Council,
Please do not pass the amendments aimed at eliminating Historical Commission and neighborhood
Conservation District functions.
The “Amendments” to conservation districts and historical Commission (which agrees with most
updates) is NOT ABOUT HISTORIC PRESERVATION OF MATERIAL CULTURE- BUT ABOUT THE AHO
2.0 without guardrails.
QUICK VOTES LEAD TO MISTAKES.
If NCD “amendments” are passed on Monday, Sept 11th, the function of the Historical Commission (CHC) and
Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCDs) to protect neighborhoods and contributions to the character of
Cambridge may no longer be relevant.
What began as retaliation by against an East Cambridge Conservation District is now being imposed city-wide.
AS with the AHO 2.0, which is driving this bus—it is being likened to lighting a candle with a blowtorch!.
Two loyalists to the original author are now supporting the activist councilors making preservation ineffectual
and development easier. The amendments on Monday continue to focus more on intangible social issues than
the historical commission’s purview of protecting material culture.
Unlike the stricter historic protections of Beacon Hill, Provincetown and Salem for example, an NCD is a
customized flexible board overseeing mostly non-binding guidelines, design review and suggestions. The
commission EXISTS to prevent incongruous development by overseeing appropriateness of size and shape and
dimensional and set back requirements. BUT NOW-- In the case of new construction or additions to existing
structures a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not consider the appropriateness of the size
and shape of the structure, and a Neighborhood Conservation District Commission shall not impose
dimensional and setback requirements . That dictate effectively guts the CHC/ NCD.
IF COUNCILORS PAID ATTENTION, THEY WOULD SEE SEVERAL RECENT CASES at CHC WHERE VINTAGE
BUILDINGS WERE ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN DOWN FOR HOUSING including Porter Sq and East Cambridge.
Just last Thursday, the CHC allowed two East Cambridge workers’ cottages to be replaced by 19 housing units.
But it wasn’t fast enough for one of the amendment sponsors. He and his followers (including key Councilors)
want A CITY-WIDE roadblock to process.
They have no regard for democratic deliberation- which can be slow- or PROCESS. BUT the DESIRED OUTCOME
WAS STILL REALIZED- SO THE SYSTEM IS WORKING!
result: the public got a better building.

The city's biggest problem is DISREGARD OF PROCESS. NOT ONE YEAR AFTER THE AHO 1 PASSED
WITH PROVISO OF A 5 YR REVIEW, PROPONENTS WERE EXPANDING AND RE-WRITING THE POLICY. IT
MAKES COUNCILORS UNTRUSTWORTHY.
There are Four Conservation Districts. From the CHC, of over 5000 applications for buildings or
renovations under its jurisdiction, only 45 were denied. 2 of the cases were later approved after redesign.
In Mid-Cambridge NCD, of 6700 applications since 1985, 101 were denied over 37 yrs but 92 were nonbinding concerning details and builders proceeded as they wished. In Avon Hill, of the 800 applications
since 1999, 7 applications were denied, 2 of the cases involved garages. In Half-Crown- since 2007, of 589
applications 11 were denied of which 3 were modified and later approved. 6 cases involved fences.
The argument that NCDs hold up or deny development is specious, and the public got a better-designed
building. Nor do NCDs exacerbate rent prices or property values.
These “AMENDMENTS”, WHICH RE-WRITE THE INTENTION OF THE NCDS, CHC OR ANY HISTORIC PROTECTION,
push for:
1) 100 signatures instead of the standard 10 signatures for a petition making it harder for citizen input. iNSTEAD
OF PUNISHING THE CHC- City criteria should all be the same.
2) REMOVAL OF expertise, professional training, architects, historians, LAWYER, people in related fields in favor
of social make-up- gender, racial, equality to oversee “enhancement” of a district and “improvement” of a
conservation district. The make-up of the CURRENT Historical Commission is one of the most diverse in the city
while having members QUALIFIED FOR THE TASK AT HAND, THAT OF PROTECTING MATERIAL CULTURE.
IF THE CHC IS REQUIRED TO HAVE THESE DIVERSITY SECTIONS, THEN ALL DEPARTMENT CHARTER SHOULD
HAVE THEM.
3) This is not a vanity commission but a certified profession. THAT INCLUDES PLANNING BOARD AND BZA.
4) The Council has been given more oversight WHEN ITS MEMBERS ARE UNQUALIFIED TO MAKE SUCH
JUDGEMENTS ON HOW, WHEN, WHY BUILDINGS AND DISTRICTS SHOULD BE PROTECTED.
5) CHC doesn’t have jurisdiction over population distribution or enforced involvement. And “ideology” is
actually listed as criteria, not protection of material culture.
6) Council is not qualified to designate or identify the significance of a potential NCD; it can rescind an NDC
district without study. The original AHO respected the conservation districts and historical commission. Not so
here. THESE ARE NOT AMENDMENTS BUT REDIRECTION.
By taking the teeth out of a 60 yr program helping to shape the city, Council is using historic
preservation divisively making it easier for developers without the perceived road blocks. These
NCD “amendments” have been TENATIOUSLY kept alive by Councilors McGovern and Mallon, and their
posses by CONFLATING TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES, AHO 2.0 AND NCDS- without understanding how the
Historical commission helps regulate and guide the city of Cambridge making it the #1 city people want
to move to.
Please charter right or postpone the NCD amendments until after the election. Too bad if several councilors
don’t get their signature policies before leaving. It is not about them, it is about the city.

Re: Outdoor Dining and Bike Lanes

Hi all,
I would like to add an amendment that I wrote to a response to this email, and perhaps should have included in the
original. Thank you:
""
Police aren’t enforcing bike lanes unless they are protected, so if they aren’t protected, that would just mean people
park in them and it’s unpredictable. Honestly I would prefer no bike lane than these curvy ones (that avoid outdoor
dining) because cars always end up blocking the entrance and exit. If the police enforced the laws, it would be another
story, but until then…
""
And it brings me to another overarching point, which is that it is outrageous how little the police do to enforce parking in
bike lanes. I regularly bike by a car in the bike lane and see an officer (or many officers) with a complete view of the car
who do not do anything about it. Could the city council do something to change this behavior?
On Fri, Sep 8, 2023 at 2:59•PM Sam Melton <sam.melton@gmail.com> wrote:
Hi there,
I think outdoor dining is great, but the space needed for outdoor dining should come from the activity that takes up the
vast majority of our city space: cars.
Making bike lanes less safe creates a backwards response from the city. If we take away a bit of car territory, people
will get to their destination a bit slower, or maybe they will even decide not to drive and get there in a different way. If
we take away bike territory, it puts the cyclist in physical danger. On my daily commute, I pass through many protected
bike lanes, which are really nice. The new one on Brattle Street is awesome. My wife will bike around to cafes and
restaurants with me, but only if we can go on protected bike lanes, because she does not feel safe otherwise. As a
result, she would prefer to just stay home sometimes because biking there feels dangerous.
The bike lane legislation is fantastic and could change Cambridge meaningfully so that more people are biking, walking,
and visiting the businesses around town. This amendment takes a step backwards, and should be rejected.
Thank you

Paint is NOT protection

Hi Cambridge City Council The policy order on bike lanes/dining installations today includes an attachment with suggested changes to the Cycling
Safety Ordinance that would allow replacing separated bike lanes with paint.
From a data perspective, this INCREASES the danger of biking: https://usa.streetsblog.org/2023/09/07/study-paint-onlybike-lanes-may-increase-crashes
From a personal perspective, this is also incredibly alarming. I live in Cambridgeport and bike to daycare with my three
year old daughter. Every day we have to carefully navigate the roads. Every time I need to swerve into a vehicle lane
because a car has double parked in a painted bike lane is a choice by that driver and City Council to put my daughter's
life in danger. It doesn't have to be that way. There have been some amazing changes, like the protected bike lanes on
Mass Ave over the Harvard Bridge, that has increased bike safety immensely. Please keep the right trajectory!

NO on AHO2

The vote before you tonight has the potential to significantly change Cambridge in ways that are NOT supported by the
majority of Cambridge residents.
NO ONE I've spoken with is against expanding affordable housing in the city. There are numerous ideas on how to best
do this but building towers as if it's the 1960's and '70's is NOT the way to go. Even affordable housing advocate, Susan
Connelly, has pointed out how contrary to best practice this proposed policy is.
Yes to affordable housing.
Yes to AHO as presented in the envision report.
Yes to allowing the original overlay policy to work and evaluate progress in 5 years.
NO to allowing and incentivizing 12 and 15 story buildings, with no green space, parking or design input from
neighborhoods.
It is not just wrong-headed...it is simply the wrong solution to a very real issue that will take cooperation and
collaboration amongst planners, residents, developers and policy makers to solve.
I urge you to vote no tonight.

Support for keeping separated bike lanes!

Hello!
I’m writing to the city council in support of keeping both outdoor dining and separated bike lanes in Cambridge. I’ve
been a resident of Cambridge for the past 8 years and over the past four years I’ve ditched having a car at all and
completely rely on biking and public transit to get around Cambridge, Somerville and Boston. I bike to work from Central
to Boynton Yards in Somerville every day in all seasons (including and especially the winter when biking makes my
commute much shorter!).
When I first started biking, I was very intimidated. I don’t think people realize that when you bike, you are much closer
to cars moving fast than you are on a sidewalk. Irritated drivers are quick to honk and swerve around you if they don’t
want to wait for you to make a left turn or even roll down their window to yell if you’re going too slow for them. As
Cambridge has implemented more and more protected bike lanes I’ve become a much more confident biker and
absolutely love biking to work every day. Protected bike lanes make me much safer and should also give drivers more
peace of mind - if bikers can stay out of their way, there are many fewer opportunities for the two to clash in a lane and
potentially crash.
I also love outdoor dining in Cambridge and live very close to Plough and Stars on Mass Ave where there is a great
example of a protected bike lane integrated with outdoor dining. Without the protection, I know that biking there would
become much scarier as cars constantly block bike lanes that don’t have barriers or flex posts, forcing bikers to merge
into the street in a tricky spot.
Truly, one of the things I love best about Cambridge is my ability to live without a car, visit a ton of wonderful
restaurants, stores, and places to hang out and see friends by biking to walking around. Getting rid of protected bike

place to live.

say "no" the amendment to PO #17 allowing painted bike lanes

Honorable Councilors and City Manager Huang,
Please do not approve the amendment to PO #17 regarding substituting paint for separated bike paths in the cycling
safety ordinance. As a long time cyclist with 3 children who are now regular cyclists and 2 grandchildren who are
starting to ride, the separated paths are much safer for everyone. And as a driver, I prefer the cyclists to be separated
from vehicular traffic. Paint is not a substitute for separation and is well known to pose greater risks to cyclists.
Regarding outdoor dining (POR 2023 #145 ), I fully support facilities for outdoor dining and I do not see them as
incompatible with separated bike lanes. We can have both, indeed there are already several areas in the city with both.
I don't see why this would require a change to the CSO, there is nothing in the CSO that prohibits outdoor dining
facilities.
Best regards,
Roy Russell

Dear Council,

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,
I'm writing to urge you to vote in favor of passing the Affordable Housing Amendment Overlay
amendments at this Monday's upcoming City Council meeting. These amendments are a crucial tool
for keeping Cambridge diverse by meeting the housing needs of more low and moderate income
people who either live here or want to move here. More broadly, it is my hope that you will broadly
support more housing of all kinds so that smart, creative people who want to live here can do so and

Re: AHO 2.0
Cambridge City Council, Cambridge City Clerk, Cambridge City Manager,
I again write to the City Council to stress that the inappropriate proposal by some members of this City
Council with a radical rewrite of the original AHO citywide without further study and consideration of
the negative impacts this will have on Cambridge housing affordability, livability and especially the
environment, is totally uncalled for.
First of all, do we have the infrastructure to support a city-wide zoning change of this magnitude? As far
as I can tell there has been no consideration to the impact on potable water, sewage systems, flood
maps, storm drain requirements, wetlands protection, nor on the city's electrical power requirements
nor on the city school system. Also, as currently written, the AHO2 proposal will adversely impact
climate resilience by removing tree canopy, open space and permeable space from the city for decades.
This proposed AHO2 gives as of right benefits to developers while eliminating input from the Planning
Board and Cambridge residents.
This is a highly undemocratic maneuver and is contrary to over two hundred years of national zoning
traditions. I believe that the uncalled-for risk of totally unexpected and unforeseen consequences would
be better managed if the AHO2 were restricted in a logical and appropriate way as has been done in
other cities across America.
Prior planning prevents poor performance. This AHO2 proposal totally lacks the concept of prior
planning with the glaring and too big to be ignored issues of climate and racial inequality while totally
disregarding anything that could possibly go wrong. Worse of all this proposal ignores racial disparity in
housing and makes no mention of help to aid the funding of home purchases by minority residents who
need that kind of help. Where is the innovative thinking that should back-up such a wide-ranging
proposal as this? Where are the assurances that this will distribute housing opportunities equitably?
Where is it stated that these changes will support the ability of current Cambridge residents to actually
remain in Cambridge? Where is it stated that these changes call for a variety of options for people with
disabilities and that housing for them will have access to public transportation? Where are the specific
details that explain how passing this city-wide proposal will work? Are there any details of any aspect at
all of even how this proposal is supposed to work?
Has the city tried to help remove the burden on its nonprofit developers? Has the city purchased land
itself whenever available which it could provide to the nonprofit developers on a long-term lease with a
minimum charge? Are commercial developers required to pay reasonable sums into affordable housing
or nonprofit trust funds or even provide developable sites for additional affordable units as many major
corporations have done in other high-tech cities? There are no specifics available for AHO 2.0. There is
no legitimate proposal here. There is no real planning here. There is only a proposal that demands
“Give us what we want, now, and then we’ll figure it out later.” This AHO 2 is a recipe for disaster.

Please use your power to help people; please pass the expanded AHO

Dear Council,
I'm writing to you in support of the expanded AHO. I'm not sure what I can tell you that you haven't already heard; you
know the arguments in favor. You know the need for affordable housing is dire. You know a lack of affordable housing
contributes to displacement, financial instability, homelessness, and poor physical and mental health outcomes. You
know high quality, low-barrier affordable housing allows families, young people, and retirees to live here who otherwise
would not be able to, and you know these people contribute to our community in countless ways.
You also know that the many of the same people and groups who protested against the first AHO now point to it as a
model of "best practices" in building affordable housing. It used to be that the AHO was going to destroy the city; now
it's working so incredibly well there is no need to expand it. That's quite the turnaround!
You know that affordable housing is broadly popular, and you know that 12-story buildings don't hurt anyone. You know
that long commutes, severe rent burden, displacement, and homelessness do hurt people. The people those things are
hurting are not "transients." They are your constituents and your neighbors.
You know everything you need to in order to vote on this. It's just a matter of deciding which you care more about placating an angry, securely housed minority with their vague cries of "character," or helping people who need help. It
really is that simple. Please vote to help people by expanding the AHO to allow for more affordable housing in our city.

Jessica Sheehan

Affordable Housing Ordinance

To the Councillors,
I've been a Cambridge homeowner for 43 years (first in Inman Square and more recently in North Cambridge)
and I'm writing to express my very strong support for the proposed amendment to the Affordable Housing
Ordinance.
There's a desperate shortage of affordable housing in our City. The housing market here serves only the
wealthy and near-wealthy (and, perhaps, the very overcrowded). The number of "Cambridge residents" on
affordable-housing waitlists doesn't even reflect the enormity of the housing shortage, as most Cambridge
residents needing affordable housing have long since had to depart for less unaffordable towns.
Currently, developers who aim to build affordable housing in Cambridge aren't able to outbid market-rate
developers for land acquisition, because a market-rate developer can offer land prices based on anticipated skyhigh rents or sales prices. Thus the logic of the proposed AHO amendment: to give all-affordable project
developers an advantage (more housing units, thus more federal/state subsidy) sufficient to enable them to
compete more fairly with other developers.
Please support this necessary amendment.

for separated bike lanes rather than paint-only bike lanes (the latter are significantly less safe).
As both a resident and a regular biker in the city of Cambridge, I have experienced first hand that paint is not

Support PO #8 and oppose NCD amendments

Dear City Councillors,
I'm speaking in support of Policy Order 8 asking for analysis of different building heights along AHO defined
corridors and in opposition to the current draft amendments to the Historical Building and Landmarks
Ordinance also referred to NCD ordinance.
These two seemingly disparate items are very much linked in an attempt to remove as many barriers to
development as possible whether it is for affordable housing or redevelopment of existing buildings into luxury
dwellings. The potential outcome if both are approved as drafted is for new or renovated buildings to be very
much out of character with neighboring buildings or to have the historic and architectural value and significance
of a location or structure to be permanently or materially impacted.
Change is necessary to meet our housing goals. It keeps our community's housing stock interesting and adds
vibrancy to our neighborhoods.
I urge the council to carefully consider the impact as you vote on both these ordinances and hope you can come
to the conclusion it is worth developing housing within the context of a neighborhoods’ character and livability,
and for preserving the role of neighborhood conservation districts, neighborhoods and neighbors to have
meaningful input into changes that directly impact them.
Thank you.

In support of AHO amendments

Dear Councillors,
I have lived in Cambridge for just over 30 years at 18 Watson St in Cambridgeport. I strongly support the AHO
amendments because Cambridge is becoming a city that only the uber-rich can afford to live in. As a small example, two
not that wonderful houses (no yard, 3 bedroom) -- one next door and the other across from my block on Pearl St -- are
selling for $2.3 million. How absurd is that? The amendments won't solve that, but they are important tools to provide
some affordable housing.

AHO 2.0

Councillors:

• The AHO 2.0 is not proposed in our Envision Report. The review of AHO 1.0 has not yet been
undertaken.
• The model of 12-15 story income-restricted towers is a model from the 1950s and 1960s that is no
longer supported by urban planners. Many of these now are being taken down in other communities.
• Greater density also will lead to the increasing heat island factors we are facing in the city –
negatively impacting health and other considerations in our denser neighborhoods.
• The AHO 2.0 developments will be done without design oversight, setbacks, or parking. Note the
Planning Board is excluded from any oversight role in these decisions. Their views are only advisory.
• The pre-AHO Frost Terrace complex that people often cite was created with both
strong neighborhood and Planning Board input. It was created prior to the AHO.
• We need for city-owned land to be used for this purpose - then leased to developers.
• AHO units are now sometimes costing nearly $1 million apiece, nearly double what market rate
units. Here too there is no oversight.
• We also need to use city money for these developments so that we can focus on housing our own
city residents. There is scarcer Federal and State funding and the AHO process is framed around this
funding, which also means that 2/3 of the applicants on the AHO lists are not city residents.

Dear City Council,
My name is Rachel Sandalow-Ash and I am a Cambridge resident and renter -- I live at 21 Marcella St. Apt. 3. I am writing
to express my strong support for the amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay. We have a crisis of affordable
housing in our city. I know too many friends and neighbors who have been forced to leave Cambridge due to rising rents,
and many more friends and colleagues who would love to live here but will never be able to move in. Simply put,
Cambridge should not just be a city for the wealthy. The educators and school staff who teach and support our kids;
janitors who keep our labs and office buildings clean; and grocery and retail clerks who staff our local businesses should
be able to live in Cambridge, too.
We need to build more affordable housing as quickly as possible, and the AHO amendments are a crucial way to achieve
this goal.
I therefore ask the City Council to pass these amendments into law.
Thank you,
Rachel Sandalow-Ash

Cambridge resident supporting POR #159

Dear Cambridge City Council,
My name is Rachel Sandalow-Ash and I am a Cambridge resident -- I live at 21 Marcella St, Apt. 3. I am writing in support
of Policy Order #159, calling for the City Council to formally oppose the Cambridge Police Department collaborating in
any way with the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.
I support this Policy Order for two main reasons:
1. The Atlanta Public Safety Training Center -- "Cop City" -- is training police to suppress protests and dissent, and
particularly, to suppress protests calling for racial justice and an end to police violence. Police training at Cop City have
already killed one protester. Cambridge police should not be training at or working with such a facility. Instead,
Cambridge police should focus on building trust with the community, respecting all residents' civil liberties and civil
rights, and developing and implementing non-violent strategies to respond to emergencies when they arise.
2. The policy order also calls for the City Council to urge our Senators and Representatives in congress to oppose the
building of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. This is particularly important because Georgia's attorney general,
Chris Carr, is currently bringing RICO charges against 61 Cop City protesters in what appears to be a broad-based attack
on the right to protest. (Given that convicted felons in Georgia lose the right to vote, Carr's indictment is also an attempt
to disenfranchise opponents of police militarization.) Given the fragile state of our democracy, the federal government
should take action to investigate the civil rights violations at Cop City protect the right to protest nationwide.
Thank you,
Rachel

Policy Order 2023 #147

Hi there,
I just wanted to submit some thoughts in opposition to Policy Order 2023 #147 as currently written. My main concerns
are that the proposed buffer protected bike lanes do not offer sufficient protection to cyclists, nor will they prevent cars
from parking in the bike lane. I also fear that this could become a workaround to "satisfy" the CSO, without actually
building the intended separated bike lanes (especially if some of the anti-CSO folks make it onto the Cambridge City
Council in the next election).
I believe that cars parking in the bike lane is a very real concern, especially if the intent is to use these buffer protected
bike lanes in conjunction with outdoor dining. People often take Uber and Lyft to restaurants, and rideshare drivers are
not shy about parking in bike lanes.
However, I understand the desire to retain flexibility for the installation of outdoor dining. My suggestion would be to
update the CSO amendment such that it requires the street to be fully closed to motor vehicle traffic in order to replace
a separated bike lane with one of these buffer protected bike lanes. And the amendment should also stipulate that the
buffer protected bike lane shall only count towards the required CSO mileage as long as the street remains closed to all
motor vehicle traffic.
Thanks,
Jonathan Haber

In Support: Affordable Housing Overlay Amendments

Dear Cambridge City Council,
I am writing in support of the proposed Affordable Housing Overlay amendments. I

have lived in Cambridge since 1966 and at my current address, 98
Lexington Avenue in West Cambridge, for almost 50 years.
Like many cities, and perhaps more than most, we have a serious
housing shortage, particular for affordable housing. The AHO was a
good step in providing more affordable housing in Cambridge. The
AHO amendments will build on the AHO. The tools provided by the
AHO amendments, which are also supported by all of
the affordable housing builders working in the city, will
help Cambridge build more affordable housing. At the same time,
these tools will strengthen our city's diversity, which is one of
the wonderful and distinguishing traits of our community.
Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.
Very truly yours,
Peter Sturges

Policy Order for evaluation of outdoor dining installations with separated bike lanes

I am writing in support of the Policy Order requesting the City of Cambridge staff to evaluate how to combine outdoor dining
installations with separated bike lanes, but I am opposed any changes to the Cycling Safety Ordinance which would allow for
replacing separated bicycle lanes with paint markers.

Outdoor dining installations with separated bicycle lanes should be encouraged. However, paint markers are an ineffective measure to
insure bicycle safety for several reasons: motor vehicles regularly cross paint markers into bicycle lanes, motor vehicles regularly stop
in bicycle lanes only separated by paint markers (to allow passengers to disembark, to pick up or make deliveries, etc.) Separated
bicycle lanes are a proven safety measure. Paint markers are not. We should not be reducing transportation safety in the city.

Thank you for your consideration.

In Support of Painted Bike Lanes

City Councilors, City Manager, and City Clerk,
Cambridge Bicycle Safety is urging Cantabrigians to lobby against the policy order to be discussed at the
September 11 City Council Meeting that would allow painted bike lines in our city. I would like to present the
case that painted bike lanes are acceptable—sometimes preferred—ways to demarcate space on our streets.
I am a 68-year-old longtime Cambridge resident. I bicycled to work my entire career, and have not owned a car
for a decade. Bicycling is my primary means of transit. I have cycled all 48 contiguous United States and have
logged over 100,000 miles on bicycles. In urban areas, I prefer painted bicycle lanes over separated bike lanes.
The primary challenge of any urban bicyclist is to be seen. Motor vehicles are larger and faster than me; in an
accident, I will suffer greater damage. I want them to see me. I want them to pass me at an appropriate speed
and if there isn’t enough room to pass, I want them to stay behind me—patiently— until it is safe to pass. I can
be seen best when I am riding in their sight, going the same direction.
In the past decade Cambridge has built all manner of bicycle/pedestrian/motor vehicle configurations.
Sometimes we cyclists are on the same plane as pedestrians (Concord Avenue near Belmont). Sometimes we
are on two-way dedicated sections separated from vehicles by stanchions (Brattle Street). Sometimes we are
parallel to vehicles with stanchions (Cambridge Street). Sometimes we run contra-flow (Follen Street). I don’t
even know how to describe Garden Street, which has a combination of bike lanes, stanchions, cars parked midstreet and one-way vehicle traffic.
Throughout Cambridge, there is little consistency in the relationship between cars and bicycles. This proves
confusing for both. The organization of bike lanes changes often, and frequently breaks down at intersections.
When I ride west on Follen Street and want to proceed west on Concord Ave, I stop at the intersection of
Garden Street, totally perplexed: I cannot figure out how I am supposed to navigate it legally.
Most accidents occur at intersections, and when parked cars block cyclists from moving vehicles, the vehicles
cannot see us as we approach intersections. Similarly, when separated bike lanes disintegrate at intersections,
moving vehicles are less likely to see us then if we are alongside each other the entire way.
The best bike lane layout in the city, I believe, is Huron Avenue between Concord and Fresh Pond Parkway.
There is a clear painted bike lane right next to the moving vehicles, going the same direction, with a buffer zone
between cycles and parked cars, so we don’t get doored. So simple, so clear, so effective.
An additional concern I have about all the separated bike lanes is how difficult it makes providing city services.
I often ride east on Brattle during collection days. Trucks driving west are a dozen feet away from the
receptacles placed along the curb of houses on the north side. Sanitation workers have to cross the two-lane
bikeway to retrieve cans, pull them across the bike-way, unload them, repeat the process—all while blocking
the vehicle traffic moving west. I feel sorry for sanitation workers for all the hassle the separated bike lanes
cause them.

I believe that the best way to achieve safer streets for everyone in Cambridge would be to enforce traffic laws.
In over thirty years, I have never seen anyone, in any kind of conveyance, stopped for driving too fast, running a
red light, or jaywalking. If the city gave out citations to pedestrians and cyclists who flout signs and signals, and
for drivers exceeding 20 mph, the drivers would slow down, the cyclists would obey lights, the pedestrians
would go to crosswalks, and everyone would be much safer than they are by creating more dedicated lanes and
their inevitable blind spots.
Cambridge should be in the business of encouraging folks to get out of their cars; to walk and to cycle. Our
public thoroughfares are only so wide, and from a sustainability perspective, we should not be paving them
wider. Our streets serve multiple purposes and multiple means of transport. Cutting them up into dedicated
lanes is not always in everyone’s best interest. Drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians do best when we can all see
each other. Oftentimes the clearest way to do that is with a simple painted line.
Thank you for your service to our city.

Similarly, I know a Cambridge firefighter who bemoans how difficult it has become to navigate emergency
vehicles along Garden Street and other roads that have been chopped up into so many defined corridors.

Strong Support for 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Amendments

Dear all,
I write to express my strong support for the proposed amendments to the 100% Affordable
Housing Overlay. These amendments will make more sites viable for our local non-profit
affordable homebuilders to acquire and allow more affordable homes to be built on acquired
sites. The amendments will allow funds from our Affordable Housing Trust to go further and
create more homes. Leaders from Just-A-Start, HRI, the Cambridge Housing Authority, and the
AHT have all reviewed and offered their strong support for these amendments.
We badly need more affordable housing for the thousands of Cambridge families on our
affordable housing waitlists. I do not understand why anyone would oppose more affordable
housing over aesthetic concerns knowing that children will be displaced from our schools and
families from our City if we fail to act. We need to do more to meet our Envision goals for almost
3200 new affordable homes by 2030.
I live in East Cambridge near several taller CHA buildings, including the Truman Apartments
within the neighborhood (that are NOT on a corridor OR in a square), and they completely blend
into the fabric and character of my neighborhood. It was the right thing to do to build those
homes then, and it is the right thing to do to support allowing similar affordable residences to be
built now.
To close, the Cambridge Housing Authority recently released a profile of a single mother, Daisy
Ozuna, originally from the Dominican Republic, who waited NINE YEARS for an affordable home
in Cambridge. She described it as life-changing. Here’s more of what she said:
“My self-esteem has gone through the roof because I have a home of my own now in such an
amazing city. Ask my friends, they all see me as a ball of light now, no more darkness.
Cambridge is a healthy environment. It is safe, beautiful, accessible, and has great transportation
options. These are things everyone should be able to enjoy.
I love it here. I am at peace. I am home.”
Please think of families like Ms. Ozuna’s when you make your decision this evening. I hope you
will vote to allow more Cambridge families to be able to afford to live here.
Thank you,
Justin Saif

Amendment to enhance solar on green roofs

Dear City Councilors,
As a Cambridge voter and a member of Mothers Out Front, I support the amendment to the Green Roof Ordinance that
will enhance the use of solar panels on green roofs.
I supported the Green Roofs Ordinance when It was proposed and voted on in 2021. I recall that research shows that
green roofs and solar panels are a mutually beneficial match.
I urge you to vote for the amendment.

Please enact the AHO amendments

Dear Councilors:
There is a desperate need for the additional affordable housing that could be created
within the increased building space allowed by the AHO amendments you will be
voting on this week. Households who are doubled up or split up, or living in
inadequate spaces, or waiting on waitlists while paying half or more of their income
for rent need this housing. People who are being forced out of Cambridge where they
have their family, medical and social supports, need this housing.
The homes that can be built over the next years under the new AHO provisions will
certainly not meet all their needs, but they will be an essential contribution that
Councilors can make now by voting in favor of the amendments!
Thank you for standing for a Cambridge that can change, grow, and thrive by allowing
this expansion of affordable housing.

AHO 2.0

As a resident of Cambridge for over 25 years I am writing to register my strong disagreement with AHO 2.
First of all there has not even been a review of AHO 1 yet!
Other issues which are very problematic include the fact that the Planning Board is only advosry and therefore
has no oversight role. This when the green canopy, set backs, and parking are no longer being protected.
While affordable housing is extremely important it needs to be done in a way that is thoughtful and keeps the
neighborhoods and Cambridge the unique city it is.

Secretary of Transportation
US Department of Transportation
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE
Washington, DC 20590
RE: Letter of support for Cambridge RCN grant application for Pedestrian and Bicycle Crossing of the MBTA
Fitchburg Rail Line
Dear Secretary Buttigieg:
The City Council fully supports the City of Cambridge grant application for planning and design of a
pedestrian and bicycle crossing over the Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line. This grant request for the amount of
$2,400,000 to design this crossing will reconnect the Rindge Avenue neighborhood with nearby open space
resources, retail stores and jobs that are cut off by this transportation corridor. It will also fill a critical gap in
the sustainable transportation network in North Cambridge and beyond, connecting regional multi-use
paths to adjacent communities in the Alewife area. Providing active transportation options to neighbors in
this area is of the utmost importance as we continue to seek opportunities to support environmental justice
and equitable access to healthy transportation options. The crossing project also includes an at-grade multiuse path from Steel Place, near Alewife Station, to Sherman Street, creating a direct connection to transit
and the proposed crossing project.
The City of Cambridge supports and promotes walking, bicycling, and transit use through a variety of
successful programs and policies. The City is actively working to increase the use of walking, bicycling, and
transit with a focus on equity and environmental justice to reduce congestion, increase the livability of
North Cambridge, reduce transportation’s impact on the climate, and offer safe and convenient options for
people walking, bicycling and taking transit.
The pedestrian and bicycle crossing over the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Fitchburg
Commuter Rail line is a critical connection between three high-rise multi-family affordable housing
properties, plus Cambridge Housing Authority’s Jefferson Park complex along Rindge Avenue and
Cambridge’s largest open space, Danehy Park, as well as Fresh Pond Reservation just to the south, and the
Fresh Pond Shopping Center. These destinations are divided by the MBTA Fitchburg Commuter Rail train
tracks and this connection will provide direct access to recreation opportunities and regional employment
options for the more than 1,200 housing units along Rindge Avenue, the majority of which are protected
affordable housing. A dedicated bicycle and pedestrian crossing in this area would have many benefits:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Connecting dense multi-family housing and Cambridge’s largest open space via a direct, safe,
convenient transportation option to several other multi-use paths enabling access to Belmont,
Somerville, Watertown, Arlington, and Lexington
Reduce unsafe, at-grade crossings of the tracks through holes in perimeter fencing
Creating an off-road path connection to the MBTA Alewife rapid transit station for residents in the
neighborhood and employees of the Fresh Pond Mall area, solving the last mile problem
Enabling area residents quicker access to the jobs, grocery stores, schools, recreational facilities, and
other everyday destinations inside and outside of North Cambridge
Directly involving disadvantaged and environmental justice populations in the planning and design
process of the proposed project
Incorporating innovative stormwater features and adding tree canopy and landscaped areas

Each of these benefits will contribute to reducing vehicle trips by making it quicker and safer to make trips
by transit, biking, and walking. The Cambridge City Council feels that this project will help connect and
transform the North Cambridge area to one that is rich in transportation options. We strongly encourage
