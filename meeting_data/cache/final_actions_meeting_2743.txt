Realizing the Vision
•

Relocation of GTS

•

Arts and Cultural Center with 250-300 seat theater requires significant
investment. A 30,000 SF state-of-the-art facility of this kind has not been built in
more than 20 years in the Greater Boston area.

•

Sustainable Operating Model:
• Startup Costs, including Executive Director and ticketing infrastructure
• Pricing Structure that enables time for community theater use
• Ongoing operational support

Communication: Kendall PUD Biomed_20201110 (Public Hearings)

Financial Investments

Market Realities
•

Only lab space can command the rents necessary to support both the relocation
of the GTS and the level of investment necessary for a meaningful arts and
cultural center of this scale.
