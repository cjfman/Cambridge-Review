Virtual Meeting

Overview
The Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) will meet to advance its purpose act on the Guiding
Principles for Community Benefits Funding set forth in the Community Needs Assessment.
I. CBAC Meeting Norms
CBAC Meeting Norms:
• Step up/ step back
• Stay on topic and strive to be succinct
• Listen for understanding
• Share your wisdom and expertise
• Honor wisdom and expertise of other members and the Committee as a whole
• Elicit and honor divergent perspectives
• Strive to move beyond standard solutions
• Advance the group process – maintain focus on what we aim to accomplish, and take iterative approach to
integrating new information that helps us move forward
• Respect and value work that preceded us
• Indicate that we want to speak and wait to be called on by facilitator
• Acknowledge current reality is very different – a lot has changed, and so CBAC’s approach may need to look
different
Proposed additions:
• As a complement to “Respect and value the work that preceded us”, something to the effect of, “Welcome new
members and questions they may have”
• Centering our beneficiaries (people that are supposed to be benefiting from Community Benefits Funds) within
the conversation

II. Acceptance of Minutes
CBAC unanimously accepted minutes from its meetings on:
• January 21, 2021
• March 1, 2021

• March 22, 2021

III. Review of CBAC Context – including Milestones, Guiding Principles, Strategic Priorities, & Key Responsibilities
Discussion:
• CDD Quarterly Development Log – include Community Benefits Funds in it?
• Who controls future of Community Benefits Funds – how might CBAC engage/ share feedback with City Councilors? And
what is CBAC role relative to long-term sustainability?
• How might CBAC share lessons learned from Partnerships and engage in community-wide conversation about the use of
the Funds?

Be explicit about communicating back to Partnerships and public with the information we gather – who do we share it with,
and how?
When will the Citywide Needs Assessment need to be redone? CBAC has unique insights – what role might it play?
o And it would be useful to understand where the Needs Assessment fits in the scope and sequence of how we do
things
In re: CBAC’s responsibility to “Hold the vision and what systems change entails” – revisit that, both what that vision is, and
that it may have changed from what it was originally, both due to Covid and what Partnerships face
CBAC’s responsibilities also entail supporting collaboration within and across Partnerships, seeing the City’s role differently,
and the ultimate goal of helping residents get what they need to live and thrive
o The goal is to help the Partnerships succeed vs. just being a gatekeeper to resources – helping Partnerships
succeed
In re: CBAC’s responsibility to “Monitor performance” – add, “and tracking/ documenting context” – i.e., CBAC’s
responsibility includes staying cognizant and aware of contextual changes

IV. Logic Model & Evaluation Plan – Presentation with Health Resources in Action
CBAC reactions & discussion:
• Timing of network survey administration – will happen annually, likely around November
• A lot to digest on the spot – want to keep mulling it over
• Concept of “baseline” challenged due to Covid-19, and baseline is tricky given the pretty high bar to even apply for this
grant – favored organizations with existing partnership(s) and connections to other nonprofit organizations
o We may consider as a committee what we mean by baseline, and how we prioritize accessibility of funding for a
broader range of nonprofits
o It takes a high level of organizational capacity to support partnerships, establish relationships
• And CBAC struggles with, What is our role? (How) Do we support these Partnerships – what assumptions did we make and
were they accurate (such as that organizations are siloed)?
• Logic Model assumes organizations will be able to partner in a certain way, and that residents will benefit from Logic Model
o If there are organizations that don’t have relationships – what does that mean for them? Does it mean they won’t
be able to do it? What does it mean for CBAC and/or the Logic Model?
• Thread on left side of Logic Model around technical assistance from CBAC/HRiA to support partnering – we didn’t actually
do that
• “Happy accident” – What might have happened had Covid hit with organizations that didn’t already have deep partnership?
• Some of the ideas around partnerships – partnership development is tied to outcomes, both for partnerships and families
served, as well as to the systems change CBAC talked about in early days
• Seeing the partnership and network piece – important for us to learn more about as time goes on; maybe outcomes/
needles aren’t moved as much as we had anticipated
o We need to see progression and implementation over time for outcomes to be realized
• [Meeting ended early due to technical issues]
