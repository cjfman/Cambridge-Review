CAMBRIDGE WATER SYSTEM
PROVIDING A CLEAN and RELIABLE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER
• IN THE MID 1800s IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WAS NOT AN ADEQUATE LOCAL SUPPLY OF FRESH
DRINKING WATER TO MEET THE RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
• CAMBRIDGE’S GOVERNING BODY WERE PROACTIVE AND WANTED TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT AND
RELIABLE SOURCE OF FRESH CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE CITY’S OWN
GROWING POPULATION AND HELP STRENGTHEN AND ENCOURAGE ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH INITIATED
THE CENTURIES LONG COMMITMENT TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT WATER SYSTEM TO MEET THOSE NEEDS
• ACQUIRED LAND/EASEMENTS:
• FROM MULTIPLE TOWNSHIPS AND BUILT DAMS TO CREATE THE HOBBS BROOK AND STONY BROOK RESERVOIRS THAT NOW MAKE
UP CAMBRIDGE’S INDEPENDENT SOURCE WATER SUPPLY

• WITHIN WALTHAM AND WATERTOWN ALLOWING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STONY BROOK CONDUIT TO CONVEY
WATER TO FRESH POND

• CONSTRUCTED A WATER TREATMENT PLANT IN 1923 TO CLEAN AND DISINFECT THE RAW WATER REMOVING
ORGANICS AND ADDING CHLORINE TO KILL COMMON WATER BORNE DISEASES SUCH AS CHOLERA,
TYPHOID AND HEPATITIS

CAMBRIDGE WATER SYSTEM
CONTINUOUS COMMITMENT to CLEAN and RELIABLE DRINKING WATER

• ACQUIRED LAND IN BELMONT CREATING THE PAYSON PARK RESERVOIR TO STORE A LARGE VOLUME OF
TREATED WATER TO SUPPLY BY GRAVITY AN UNINTERRUPTED ON DEMAND SOURCE OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER
AND FIRE PROTECTION TO THE CITY

• CONTINUED LAND ACQUISITION TO BETTER PROTECT THE SOURCE WATER SUPPLY FROM URBAN DEVELOPMENT
AND ENCROACHMENT
• CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF THE UP-COUNTRY RESERVOIRS AND FRESH POND RESERVATION AS SOURCE
WATER PROTECTION
• CONTINUOUS UPGRADES TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PIPING ENSURING RELIABLE SUPPLY FOR ADEQUATE
FIRE PROTECTION AND DOMESTIC WATER AT EVERY TAP

• BECAME A FULL MEMBER/CONNECTED TO THE MDC (NOW MWRA) WATER SUPPLY FOR FULL REDUNDANCY
• CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART WJ SULLIVAN PLANT IN 2001 AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST
INCREASING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND NEW EMERGING CONTAMINANTS OF CONCERN
