Subject:

Cannabis Amendments Zoning Petition

Recommendation:

The Planning Board recommends ADOPTION.

To the Honorable, the City Council,
On June 13, 2023, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss a Zoning
Petition by City Council (the “Council”), to amend Article 4.000 and Article 11 of the
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to remove the special permit requirement for “Cannabis Retail
Store” and “Cannabis Delivery Operator” and instead make these uses permitted as-of-right,
subject to the requirements of Section 11.800 Cannabis Uses.
The Board heard a presentation from CDD staff, followed by public comment and discussion
among Board members. Following the discussion, the Planning Board voted unanimously to
forward a positive recommendation to City Council.
Board members generally expressed enthusiasm for the proposed change. Board members noted
the large volume of cannabis-related special permit applications that have come before the Board
over the past three years, and generally agreed that it was not a productive use of the Board or
the public’s time to continue to review special permit applications when there is already an
extensive permitting process in place between state licensing requirements, Host Community
Agreement requirements, and building permit and certificate of occupancy review.
Some Board members expressed the importance of urban design guidance on proposed façade
designs, in order to minimize the deleterious effects of opaque retail storefronts that seek to meet
state requirements around the concealment of cannabis products from public view. However,
Board members generally agreed that this guidance could live on in Host Community Agreement
requirements, or as part of building permit review. Board members also suggested that City staff
could develop guidelines to show applicants best practices in storefront design that meet state
licensing requirements.
Board members asked several questions related to the implications of the proposed amendment
on existing special permits, should the amendment be adopted. Specifically, Board members
asked what action, if any, the Planning Board will need to take to void existing special permits
for Cannabis Retail stores once a special permit requirement is removed. Board members also
sought clarification on the applicability of various special permit conditions, including traffic
mitigation fees, that apply to existing special permits for which a building permit or certificate of
occupancy has not yet been issued.
