SEWERS | COMBINED VS SEPARATED

Communication: Utility_dpw-cwd_20210525 (General Business)

Combined

Cambridge’s sewer system is approximately 55%
separated, where sewage goes to the MWRA for
treatment and the stormwater discharges directly to
Alewife Brook or the Charles River.
The remaining system is combined sewer, where the
sewer and stormwater share a common pipe and can
be directed to the MWRA for treatment during dry and
wet weather, and to the Alewife Brook or the Charles
River during wet weather CSOs.

Separated

INTRODUCTION COMPLETE STREETS
Complete Streets are streets for everyone. They are designed and operated to enable safe
access for all users. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportation (transit) users of
all ages and abilities are able to safely move along and across a Complete Street. Complete Streets
make it easy to cross the street, walk to shops, and bicycle to work. They help buses run on time
and make it safe for people to walk to and from train stations.
More sidewalks and bicycle facilities are included in Complete Streets, which provide increased
accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists.
During design and construction of Complete Streets, the City’s goal is to communicate projects with
neighborhoods, facilitate an integrated design process, minimize disruption to community life, and
provide reasonable access for all users during reconstruction.

PRIORITIES HIGH PRIORITY AREAS
• Areas within a 150-foot buffer of parks, major
squares, libraries, schools, youth centers,
senior housing, and senior centers.
• Areas within a 40-foot buffer of bus routes.
• Major thoroughfares to maintain the structural
integrity of streets under heavy traffic.
• Streets on Cambridge Bicycle Plan’s Bicycle
Network Vision.
• Priorities identified by the Commission for
Persons with Disabilities.

Just over 50% of City sidewalks
and streets are located outside
High Priority Areas. These
corridors serve residential
connections and need to be
maintained to the extent that
funding allows.

Approximately 20% of street
and sidewalk funding will be
reserved for areas located
outside High Priority Areas.

5 YEAR PLAN SCOPE OF WORK

Communication: Utility_dpw-cwd_20210525 (General Business)

Our approach emphasizes streets designed and operated for everyone. The following elements
allow pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit users of all ages and abilities to safely move
along and across Complete Streets.

Accessibility: Ensure pedestrian
ramps and sidewalks are
accessible for all, and
implement universal design

Vision Zero: Eliminate fatalities
and serious injuries resulting
from traffic crashes

Transit: Provide accessibility of
bus stops and prioritization
of transit

Bicycle network: Support people
of all ages and abilities to bike
safely throughout the City

Street trees & green infrastructure:
Reduce urban heat island and
improve water quality

Infrastructure: Maintain and improve
City infrastructure; coordinate with
private utilities to facilitate upgrades
Packet Pg. 18

Our climate is changing, bringing more severe storms, more extreme floods, and more intense
heat waves. Through projects in the Five Year Plan, we have opportunities to implement resiliency
strategies, ranging from green infrastructure to improved drainage to additional tree plantings.

PROGRAMS HEALTHY FOREST - HEALTHY CITY

The City maintains over 19,000 trees and has developed an Urban Forest Master Plan to guide
the development of the urban forest into the future. The goals are: increase canopy cover where
lacking; enhance canopy cover in the public realm to create “cool corridors”; and incentivize
each landowner to increase canopy cover.

The images above show the cooling impact on a 90-degree day relative to streetscape. As the
tree canopy increases, the “feels like” temperature decreases. It is our common responsibility
to plant and maintain trees every year to sustain our urban forest and foster a healthy city.
Packet Pg. 20

Communication: Utility_dpw-cwd_20210525 (General Business)

A healthy urban forest is a vital part of a healthy city. Trees - whether they are on streets and
in parks, on private properties and campuses - help us lower sidewalk temperatures in the
summer, reduce home cooling costs, improve air quality, and support a living ecosystem.

What are the benefits of Geothermal
Energy?

What is the Geothermal
Pilot Program?

As a low carbon resource, geothermal
networks have the potential to be a critical
resource in supporting Massachusetts'
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission goals.

Eversource is piloting the
use of networked
geothermal heating and
cooling technology at scale
in an eastern
Massachusetts
neighborhood as a potential
option to complement or
replace delivered fuels and
natural gas service for
heating and cooling.

How Does it Work?
The networked geothermal system pulls
the earth's heat out of the ground
to warm buildings in winter and pumps
heat from buildings back into the
ground in summer to cool them.

Packet Pg. 45

Communication: Utility_eversource_20210525 (General Business)

Eversource Geothermal Pilot Program

8

Target Group for Pilot Program:
Eversource is looking for a
mixed group of about 100
residential and commercial or
industrial customers in the
same neighborhood.

Applicants must currently
receive either delivered fuels
(heating oil or propane) or
Eversource natural gas
service in the qualifying
territory.

Load Forecasting
Econometric forecasting approach allows us to:
▪ Calculate how much of the monthly historical changes in peak
demands are due to heating, cooling and economic conditions.
▪ Types of economic variables include non-manufacturing
employment, retail sales or gross metro product.
▪ Include adjustments for company sponsored energy efficiency (EE),
behind-the-meter solar and electric vehicles.
▪ Capture pockets of load growth by identifying known large customer
projects.

COVID-19 & Electric Summer Load

Communication: Utility_eversource_20210525 (General Business)

The load forecast was finalized in Spring 2021 capturing the latest ‘large
customer’ assumptions and updated economic projections
▪ Overall, the 2021 load forecast is slightly higher than last year’s forecast
due to known large customer additions
▪ The company's load forecast assumes COVID-19 restrictions will no
longer negatively impact peak demands beginning next summer
(summer 2022)

Repercussions of COVID-19 restrictions will (again)
result in reduced peak loads in Summer 2021:
▪ Reduced staffing levels / remote working
▪ Less “foot traffic” / hesitant tourism
Potential long term increases to forecast:
▪ Robust Air purification
▪ Adoption rate of electric cars
