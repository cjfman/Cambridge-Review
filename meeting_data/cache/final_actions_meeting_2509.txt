Re: Refiled Zoning Petition-Grand Junction Pathway Overlay
District

Dear Ms. Lopez:
As our November 29, 2018 petition has expired, please find enclosed for filing, on behalf of
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., and the owners of affected land, an updated zoning
petition proposing the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District.
Our November 29, 2018 petition has been revised to reflect input from interested parties. Key
changes include lowering of proposed building height, the addition of a transition zone for
bu ilding height and a decrease in project density.
We look forward to continuing the review process and are eager to revitalize the affected land
and advance the Grand Junction Pathway.

20.1001

Establishment and Scope.

There is hereby establi shed the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District, which is governed by
the regulations and procedures speci tied in this Section 20.1000. It is the intent of this Section
that these regulations will apply to land within the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District,
which is comprised of Grand Junction Land and Development Land, as defined below.
20.1002

The October 200 I East Cambridge Planning Study identified the Grand Junction corridor as a
means to provide a significant transportation and recreational resource and enhance non-auto
mobility in the City. The October 2006 Grand Junction Rail-with-Trail f-easibi lity Study
highlighted the public benefits of the pathway, including recreation and open space, but noted
that acq uiring rights in the land to develop the pathway was a key limiting issue. The August
2017 Final Report of the Kendall Square Mob ility Task Force underscored the importance of
enhancing non-auto mobility in the City and the Grand Junction Pathway in meeting that goal.
