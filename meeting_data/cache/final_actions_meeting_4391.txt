LONG-TERM FLEXIBLE APPROACH
● These changes won’t all happen at once! This work presents a suite of
possibilities that will likely occur over 10+ years and it will be important to reevaluate changing needs over time
● A phased approach can respond to new construction technologies, funding
opportunities, and transportation demand management
● Economic costs & considerations will be an important part of future
conversations

What comes first

Creates new opportunities
and closes down others
