COUNCILLOR AZEEM
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

The Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) has so far generated a healthy pipeline of six
projects since it was first ordained in 2020; and

WHEREAS:

Though there is much to celebrate about the work that has been done, two years of
implementation have also revealed that the somewhat inflexible dimensional
requirements of the AHO have proven to be more of an obstacle than expected; and

WHEREAS:

The recent annual report revealed ten instances where affordable housing providers
“decided not to pursue” and four instances where they actually made an offer but it was
rejected; and

WHEREAS:

The proposal to build 49 affordable units at 2072 Mass Ave was not able to take
advantage of the AHO and was withdrawn in August 2021 after it became apparent
that a feasible version of the project wouldn’t be approved under 40B; and

WHEREAS:

It is clear that some refinements to the AHO would result in more new affordable
housing and fewer missed or stalled opportunities; and

WHEREAS:

Offering substantially relaxed dimensional requirements on a citywide network of
corridors and squares will allow more projects to advance, especially considering the
recent linkage fee increase; and

WHEREAS:

Permitting additional height when green area open space is protected or expanded will
add flexibility and expand options around providing such space without sacrificing any
affordable housing production; and

WHEREAS:

The active affordable housing developers in Cambridge are in agreement that these
changes will make a big difference; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council refer the attached zoning petition to the Housing and
Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration
Committees

the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement, or may be reduced
to the average of the front yard setbacks of the four (4) nearest pre-existing principal buildings
that contain at least two Stories Above Grade and directly front the same side of the street as the
AHO Project, or may be reduced to a minimum of ten (10) feet in the case of an AHO Project on
a corner lot. Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth different requirements for
residential and non-residential uses, the non-residential front yard setback requirement shall apply
to the entire AHO Project if the Ground Story contains a non-residential use as set forth
in Section 11.207.4 Paragraph (b) above; otherwise, the residential front yard setback shall
apply.no minimum front yard setback requirement.
(c) Side Yards. An AHO Project shall have a minimum side yard setback of seven and one-half (7.5)

rear yard setback set forth in the District Dimensional Standards for residential uses that is not
derived by formula if it is less restrictive. For all other AHO projects, no minimum rear yard
setback is required.
(e) Projecting eaves, chimneys, bay windows, balconies, open fire escapes and like projections which
do not project more than three and one-half (3.5) feet from the principal exterior wall plane, and
unenclosed steps, unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet
beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above Grade, may
extend beyond the minimum yard setback.
(f) Bicycle parking spaces, whether short-term or long-term, and appurtenant structures such as
coverings, sheds, or storage lockers may be located within a required yard setback but no closer
than seven and one-half (7.5) feet to an existing principal residential structure on an abutting lot.
11.207.5.2.4 Open Space
(a) Except where the District Dimensional Standards establish a less restrictive requirement or as
otherwise provided below, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area for an AHO Project
shall be thirty percent (30%). However, the minimum percentage of open space to lot area may be

(b)

(c)
(d)

(e)

(f)

reduced to no less than fifteen percent (15%) if the AHO Project includes the preservation and
protection of an existing building included on the State Register of Historic Places.
The required open space shall be considered Private Open Space but shall be subject to the
limitations set forth below and shall not be subject to the dimensional and other limitations set forth
in Section 5.22 of this Zoning Ordinance. Private Open Space shall exclude parking and driveways
for automobiles.
All of the required open space that is located at grade shall meet the definition of Permeable Open
Space as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.

required open space may be located at higher levels, such as balconies and decks, only if it is
accessible to all occupants of the building.
For the purpose of this Affordable Housing Overlay, area used for covered or uncovered bicycle
parking spaces that are not contained within a building shall be considered Private Open Space.
In any AHO project where pre-existing contiguous Green Area Open Space will be preserved
and/or expanded, or new Green Area Open Space will be created, in excess of what would
otherwise be required for the project, including through consolidation and/or relocation of some
portion of the Green Area Open Space to another part of the lot, without reducing the size of any
contiguous portion, the project may exceed the applicable height limit without restriction,
provided that the maximum possible FAR for the lot shall not be exceeded. If the AHO project is
not subject to an FAR restriction, the effective FAR not to be exceeded under this provision shall
be calculated using the dimensional requirements that apply to the AHO project, including the
original height restriction and open space requirements.

Our Cambridge Goals:
•

We need to create over 3,000 new units of
affordable housing by 2030 (per Envision
Cambridge) with a family housing focus

•

To do that we need to use all available
instruments of the city, and develop and tap
new sources of funding

•

We do not have to compromise on design to
achieve these goals

•

Good design can and should enhance
community connections and quality of life
for both residents and neighborhoods

•

Learn from what actually works in Greater
Boston to around the World and implement
similar practices

Housing As If People Mattered excerpts
Most residents appreciate an image that reflects
local prevailing middle-class norms
Low-income residents prefer housing schemes
that do not stand out in the neighborhood
Residents prefer building materials of comparable
quality & image to those in local owner- occupied
housing to minimize the likelihood of stigma

The needs of children and their parents will be
best served if there is direct, level access from a
fence yard to a safe communal play area
The whole environment should be designed with
the safety needs of children in mind
Clare Cooper Marcus and Wendy Sarkissian,
University of California

Provide as many dwellings as possible with a
private entrance at ground level
Each building entry should serve no more than 3
to 8 households
Avoid corridor-access buildings for households

10 Principles For Developing Affordable
Housing excerpts
Build community trust: [Remove] preconceived
notions formed by failed high-rise public housing
projects developed decades ago
Know your market and your customers: In-depth
knowledge of the community allows developers
to anticipate community concerns and proactively
address them
Select sites for opportunity and choice: Public
land or property can be conveyed to affordable
housing developers under land grants or longterm leases
Affordable housing can be incorporated into new
public uses (libraries, & municipal buildings)

Use design to foster community, safety, and pride:
Scale projects to respect the neighborhood
In some neighborhoods, rehabbing of existing
units may be appropriate
The proper scale will promote a healthy
connection between the development & its
surrounding neighborhood

“The most fascinating finding that came out of
the data analysis presented was... the influence
of building height and the number of units per
entry in predicting crime rate.
Regardless of the social characteristics of
inhabitants, the physical form of housing was
shown to play an important role in reducing crime
and in assisting residents in controlling behavior
in their housing environments.”

The City must think creatively and act decisively to achieve
its stated affordable housing goals
1) Substantially increase funding for affordable housing through:
• Real estate taxes ($20m = $150 tax / year)
• Proposed real estate transfer fees (generating $23m / year)
• Advocate for greater Federal, State, Institutional, Union, & private investments
2) Proactively secure & lease new sites for affordable housing development through:
• Converting city-owned lots for housing use
• Buying new sites for mixed-use development with Pre-K, needed retail on 1st floor
• Using eminent domain/negotiation to develop prime sites (e.g. converting singlestory retail to 6-story mixed-use with affordable homes)
• Use Up-Zoning & Plan Unit Development conditions for site acquisition
3) Leverage existing city resources towards affordable housing goals:
• Funds which are or could be used for housing development (CAHT, CRA)
• Support programs for affordable homeownership & rental assistance
• Incentives programs for landlords & developers (IHP)
• Build affordable housing above new, and possibly existing, city buildings
• Lease city-owned properties for affordable housing at $1.00 for 99 years

1) Consider Modest Improvements to the AHO
• Evidence-based evaluation of specific examples and needs
• Modest revisions to be approved in 2023
• Monitoring & evaluation plan to track results and future needs
2) Establish an Affordable Housing Task Force
• Multi-stakeholder group (city government, AH developers, experts in AH design, policy
and finance; AH residents & neighborhood representatives)
• Mandated to help develop, guide, and facilitate community input to the city’s
Affordable Housing Strategy and Implementation Plan
3) Develop an Affordable Housing Strategy and Implementation Plan
• Commit to a clear goal (such as 3,000 units by 2030) and explicit Terms Of Reference
• Conduct a rigorous review of best practices & innovations in affordable housing
• Define a set of options for siting, design and financing of the 3,000 units
• Present actionable options for consideration by City government and residents

Why is this important?
●

Zoning is about building for the future.

●

Without allowing more opportunity and flexibility to build affordable homes,
the future of Cambridge is one where more and more low and middle income
people will be priced out and we will lose the diversity we say we love.

●

We contend that due to issues of financing and space, we must allow greater
heights if we are going to address our affordable housing crisis.

The bulk of the research that shows ill-effects of high-rise living are from the
1960s-1980s in public housing projects where the Federal government
required that the housing was for only the poorest of the poor, resulting in
racial segregation.
Many of the studies a point to other external factors as being the main issue,
instead of simply architectural design.

Ghetto, (Harvard University Press,2000), contends this failure had less to do
with the height of the buildings and more to do with their location, lack of
amenities, lack of open space, concentration of people in poverty, lack of
support and quality management as well as overall lack of funding.

St. Louis’ Pruitt-Igoe development
●

Katharine G. Bristol (UC Berkeley) traced the development of the “The
Pruitt-Igoe Myth” in the Journal of Architectural Education (44:3,163-171),
published in 1991. She stated, “there is clearly ample evidence that
architectural design was but one, and probably the least important, of several
factors in the demise of the project.”

AHO housing is different
●

AHO homes will be in the community, not on the outskirts.

●

AHO homes will be surrounded by retail, transportation, parks, schools etc.

●

AHO homes will be mixed-income and will not concentrate people in poverty

●

AHO homes will have amenities, and be quality and sustainable construction

●

AHO homes will have programming, such as events, tenant councils,
common spaces

●

AHO homes will have minimum open space requirements

●

AHO homes are integrated, not segregated

The AHO is mixed income housing
Those who qualify for these homes can earn from 0-100% AMI. So, in one
building, there will be residents with little to no income and some earning as much
as $98,200 or more per year.

Conclusion

We believe that by allowing more height along main corridors and in our squares, we will
build more affordable homes
We believe that without building more affordable housing, the character of Cambridge’s
diversity will be lost.
We believe in prioritizing people over the height of buildings.
We believe that the failures of urban renewal of the 60’s and 70’s, do not correspond to the
housing that we are proposing and agree that we should not make the mistakes of the past.
We support the calls for the City to purchase land and build on land we own, and believe
that zoning needs to be in place to allow heights that will produce affordable housing to
meet our needs.
