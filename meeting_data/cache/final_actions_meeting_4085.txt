Please find attached the Cambridge Net Zero Action Plan 2021 Update and
Executive Summary. The Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP) was originally adopted in
2015 and provides a roadmap for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from
existing and new buildings in Cambridge by 2050.
The 2015 NZAP included a commitment that the plan would undergo a
comprehensive review of its impact and the current scientific, policy, and
technology context every 5 years. The first such review began in 2020 with
consultant support and the formation of a 25-member City Manager-appointed
Task Force representing stakeholders throughout the community. The attached
report is the result of this collaborative update process. This update:
• consolidates actions to focus resources on the most effective strategies,
• integrates administrative actions into the implementation plan, and
• adds new actions to address embodied carbon from buildings and off-site
renewable energy supply.
The updated plan will now more fully encompass the range of activities the City
is carrying out to support greenhouse gas reductions from buildings throughout
the community.
The NZAP 2021 Update thus represents a comprehensive and community-based
approach to support the City’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050. The
updated Plan serves as the FY21 NZAP Annual Report and will continue to be
overseen by the Climate Protection Action Committee. Further progress reports
will be made on an annual basis in advance of the next 5-Year Review to be
initiated in 2025.

DEFINITION OF
NET ZERO

Net Zero Emissions are defined in the Net Zero Action Plan as a
community of buildings for which annually all greenhouse gas emissions
produced through building operations are offset by carbon-free energy.

Packet Pg. 8

Net Zero Action Plan 5-Year Review
•

•

The Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP) was adopted by the City
Council in 2015 following an 18-month stakeholder
process to identify a phased set of actions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing buildings
and develop a renewable energy supply strategy for
Cambridge buildings.
As part of the original NZAP, the Task Force proposed that
the whole suite of actions be reviewed every five years to
allow for the overall strategy to adjust based on changing
economics, technology, and stakeholder needs.

Why Net Zero Buildings?
• 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in
Cambridge are from building construction
and operations. Since the original NZAP was
issued in 2015, more than 8 million square
feet of buildings have been added. If the city
can get to net zero in the building sector, we
will have made major progress toward
achieving our carbon neutral commitment.

Science

b

• Since the adoption of the Net Zero Action Plan in June 2015,
the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body
responsible for assessing the science related to climate
change, has issued special reports on the impacts of global
warming.
• The latest gap report indicates that to keep to within 1.5 deg
C above pre-industrial levels, emissions need to be reduced
45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and 100% by 2050 maintain
the ability to reach this target1.
• With every passing year, there is more urgency in the
scientific imperative, the years since 2015 have been the
hottest on record

Policy

b

• At the Federal Government Level:
• A slowdown in federal policy under the Trump administration
for energy efficiency, especially for plug loads created a gap in
behavioral energy use reductions
• Federal pollution regulations and tax credits will play a role in
clean energy procurement for the City
• National building codes such as the 2021 IECC set the
baseline for state code updates
• Whether policy objectives under the Biden administration are
realized could have a large impact on GHG emissions, though
they may have less of a direct impact on local building sector
emissions

Policy (continued)

b

• At the State Level:
• The current Three-Year Energy Efficiency Plan for gas and
electric utilities expires in 2021 and may shift to focus
more on GHG emissions. Although the Plan is
implemented at the state level, the City can advocate for
alignment with local objectives and advance programs for
hard-to-reach sectors like multifamily buildings.
• Recent State Legislation:
― An Act Setting Next Generation Climate Policy
(S.2477) sets statewide net-zero emissions limit for
the year 2050: It also sets sub-limits for specific
sectors
― An Act Relative to Energy Savings Efficiency (S.2478)
that enacts appliance efficiency standards
Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: NZAP_Executive_Summary_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan

Policy (continued)

b

• At the Local Level:
• Cambridge has now committed to achieving carbon neutrality by
2050. The faster Cambridge can reduce emissions within its
borders, the more the City can lead by example in the global
effort to combat climate change
• Cambridge voted on the proposed changes to the IECC in
December 2019 that would advance EE in new construction.
• The City will continue to advocate for a net zero stretch code at
the state level
• A fossil fuel ban was considered, however, Brookline’s effort to
ban on fossil fuel was struck down by the State Attorney General.
Still other pathways are open for consideration.

Analysis of GHG Emissions Trends
The inventory data shows that although emissions fluctuate year to year, the general building
sector emissions trend has increased slightly since 2012. A regression analysis of possible
contributing factors was performed by DNV which considered degree day data, policies
enacted during this time, and commercial and residential floor area data and found that
overall:
• The commercial sector has twice the impact on emissions trends as the residential sector.
• More cooling degree days (an amount of time during the year when cooling is in demand in
buildings) correlates with higher GHG emissions.
• Floor area added within the City from new construction projects was not statistically
associated with changes in total emissions, as emission increases from new buildings were
balanced out by increased efficiency and renewable electricity supply to the existing
building stock.

Net Zero Action Impacts To-date
The impact assessment involved a review of community-wide emissions trends in recent years in relation
to future goals as well as a bottom-up assessment of the NZAP actions adopted in 2015. The combination
of these two approaches helped determine the overall impacts of the NZAP since 2015. The review of the
original NZAP actions found that:
•

The 2015 NZAP has laid the groundwork to reduce emissions from the City of Cambridge
building stock with quantifiable impacts from five strategies aimed at increasing the energy efficiency
of buildings, improving the performance of new construction, and providing more renewables in the
energy supply.

•

Nearly 1,100 buildings in the City now report their energy and water usage to the City
annually through the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO), providing valuable
information for planning and with future performance requirements currently being planned.

•

Of the five NZAP Actions that were identified as contributing to measurable results to-date; there are
improvements needed in data collection and program tracking. The emissions savings could
only be calculated for four of those actions based on availability of data, representing only 1% of the
of the total buildings sector emissions in 2015.

Projects that align with these standards include:
• The King Open School (2019) – Fossil fuel free
• 859 Mass Ave (2017) – Deep energy retrofit with GSHPs
• Martin Luther King School (2016) – 69% energy performance improvement
Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO)
• Enacted in 2016 has led to nearly 1,100 buildings in the city that now report
their energy and water usage to the city annually
• While no emissions savings are currently attributed at this time, we
anticipate that the addition of the performance improvement requirement
will result in significant impacts in the coming years

Overview
The intent of this action is to ensure that small-med
residential and small commercial buildings are operating
optimally and, where possible, are retrofitted to maximize
efficiency and GHG reductions. In addition to these
requirements, other tools and policies will be directed
broadly across all building types, where appropriate, in
order to achieve the necessary emissions savings.
This Action will have 3 areas of focus:
•

Multifamily Custom Retrofit

•

LMI Multifamily Engagement

•

Small Commercial Custom Retrofit

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
The custom retrofit programs are instrumental for engaging
residents and small business owners in the implementation
of the NZAP. They align well with the principles of the NZAP,
in particular: engaging affected stakeholders; developing
informative and replicable models; and demonstrating
commitment to equity and social justice.

b

This Action aims to enable retrofitting of existing
homes and businesses in Cambridge to achieve
more efficient operations and energy savings. It
has positive equity impacts because more energy
efficient homes and businesses improve indoor
comfort and air quality and lower energy bills,
with particular benefits for vulnerable
populations.

Cross-cutting Issues

1.2 BEUDO Requirements
Overview
The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance covers
commercial buildings >25,000sf and residential buildings
>50 units. While a small proportion of the total number of
buildings in Cambridge, these largest buildings account for
over 50% of the square footage and approximately 80% of
building-generated GHG emissions in Cambridge. By
targeting these buildings for improvement, Cambridge will
see significant progress in GHG emission reductions. This
Action has two tracks:
1.2.1 Performance Requirements
1.2.2 BEUDO Resource Hub

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
1.2.1 – Performance Requirements: The BEUDO
Performance Requirement is essential for meeting the
City’s net zero emissions goal. By adopting performance
standards, owners (or real estate managers) of buildings
that make up the largest source of emissions in the City will
be required to find ways to reduce their emissions to net
zero over time.

Medium Term (3-5 years)
3. Monitor building performance and support
compliance; review and adjust
requirements as appropriate

Equity: Flag
While this action places the greatest amount of
responsibility on the largest emitters in the City to
assist in the transition to a net zero emissions city, it
must be noted that the costs of building upgrades may
get passed on to tenants and for large multi-family
buildings subject to BEUDO increase housing costs,
creating a potential equity pitfall for vulnerable
residents and businesses. The current BEUDO
performance requirement proposal would give
increased flexibility to affordable housing and allow
affordable housing developers to access financial
support to meet their upgrade requirements.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
1.2.2 BEUDO Resource Hub: The intention of the BEUDO
Resource Hub is to arm building owners with the
knowledge and the tools to identify areas of improvement,
take action, and achieve net zero emissions in their own
buildings. Key issues the resource hub should seek to
address are electrification, fossil fuel free district energy,
and renewable energy procurement options, including
solicitation, contracting, and pricing resources.

Key Activities:

Overview
Studies commissioned by Cambridge on this topic
have projected that by 2050, all building area will
be sold and/or touched by a renovation permit,
with many being sold or renovated multiple times
over that period. The intent of this Action is to
ensure that transaction points in building life-cycles
are leveraged to achieve energy improvements.

At the same time, transaction points may provide
access to financing, such as mortgages, which can
make energy upgrades more accessible to building
owners.
Upgrades at the time of building transaction points
also have the potential for equity benefits. Building
upgrades will result in more energy efficient homes
and businesses, which improve indoor comfort and
air quality, and lower energy bills.

Overview

Key Activities

The initial net zero new construction targets
developed for the NZAP are considered outdated and
require alignment with current standards practices,
state-level code initiatives, and the urgency of
addressing climate impacts from new construction
activities. These original targets can be used as a
reference point but should be adjusted as more
information becomes available.

Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Advocate for a state-level net zero stretch code
approach that aligns with Cambridge’s net zero
emissions priorities
2. Compile net zero resources and templates for
the building community to achieve net zero
standards by construction type
3. Adopt state net zero stretch code
4. Revisit and assess timeline for net zero new
construction by building type based on state
code structure
5. Monitor and assess opportunities to avoid
fossil fuel use in new construction

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
The originally recommended targets were intended to
show leadership and create an environment of
innovation, yet regardless of how the state stretch
code for net zero new construction affects the target
years, this action is anticipated to contribute to the
net zero goals by avoiding emissions that would
otherwise be added by new buildings.

Medium Term (3-5 Years)
6. Monitor performance of new construction

0 MT

10 Million MT

Equity: Flag

Although recent experience shows that the cost of
constructing net zero roughly aligns with the cost of
traditional construction for many building types, in
adopting the new code, the City must consider any
incremental cost of net zero buildings – that is,
costs above and beyond non-net zero buildings –
that may be passed on in the form of increased
housing or rental costs, creating a potential equity
pitfall.
Net zero buildings also entail potential equity
benefits. Net zero buildings are more energy
efficient, improve indoor comfort and air quality,
and can lower building operational costs.

Cross-cutting Issues

Renewable Thermal: Fossil fuel free new
construction should be considered as part of net
zero design
Climate Change Preparedness / Resilience: Ensure
that NZE aligns with all-electric construction with
resilient design strategies. Consider requiring a
resilience narrative as a part of permit process
Electric Transport: Consider requiring charging
station access or charging station ready design
Capacity / Local Carbon Fund: For any building
unable to achieve ZNE, contributions should be
made to the carbon fund; will need to determine
what those contributions are and when the
fund/CCA will be able to accept payments

2.1 Net Zero Requirements for New Construction

b

Overview
The Zoning Ordinance is a regulatory tool that
Cambridge can use to incrementally require higher
standards of green building and energy efficiency for
large commercial projects. Large buildings, subject to
Special Permit requirements, are currently required
to design to a certain LEED or other similar green
building standard. As a result, project developers are
delivering buildings that are higher quality. This
action also provides the opportunity for the City to
address another not previously considered but highly
impactful source of carbon emissions: embodied
carbon
Contribution to Net Zero Objective
This regulatory approach is a strong tool to
demonstrate the City’s commitment and leadership
on sustainable new construction. Going forward, Net
Zero projects should consider the impact of both
embodied carbon and operational carbon. Including
embodied carbon neutrality in the NZAP is an
important step in the pathway to achieve a net zero
carbon future.

Equity: Flag
A potential equity pitfall would occur if the incremental costs of
either the green building requirements or materials with lower
embodied carbon content are passed on to tenants and increase
housing or rental costs.
Lower embodied carbon buildings may also provide benefits beyond
emissions, including site sustainability, indoor environmental
quality, non-toxic building materials, reductions in waste generation
and water use, and increasing access to alternative transportation

Cross-cutting Issues

2.3 Net Zero Requirement for New Construction + Deep Retrofits of
Municipal Buildings
Overview

To demonstrate leadership, the City has for several
years been designing and constructing new municipal
buildings to be fossil fuel free and, since 2020,
required to be net zero . This also applies to “gut
renovations” where a building is being completely
renovated with new electrical, mechanical, interior,
and envelope systems. This commitment to the net
zero and renewable thermal objectives will become a
formal policy and provide a showcase for others for
new technologies
Contribution to Net Zero Objective

There is significant benefit to the City demonstrating
leadership by committing to achieving net zero
emissions in its own building stock. This shows the
City’s commitment, demonstrates that net zero is
achievable, will generate savings and chart a path to
net zero for private industry.

3.1 Carbon-free Energy Supply
Key Activities

Overview
Achieving net zero emissions and improving climate
resiliency will require a significant shift from fossil fuelbased heating and hot water to low-carbon, renewable
thermal systems. Specifically, this action will include
continuing to support the electrification of individual
buildings’ heating and hot water systems, as well as
enabling low-carbon district energy systems where suitable.
In addition, the transition to renewable thermal will
translate to changes in grid infrastructure and the gas
network, and Cambridge should engage and lead on
planning for an equitable, effective transition to renewable
thermal energy supply.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
About half of the emissions attributed to the building sector
are from fossil fuel use. Accordingly, transitioning buildings
to renewable thermal systems will be an important part of
achieving progress on Cambridge’s Net Zero goals.
Electrification, using heat pumps and heat pump water
heaters, enables buildings to eliminate fossil fuel use,
instead using electric systems that can be powered by
renewable electricity. District energy will continue to play an
important role in commercial and institutional hubs.

Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Continue to build the Cambridge Clean Heat Program
and expand targeted outreach efforts
2. Expand support for multifamily building electrification
3. Engage with development teams and partner
organizations on district energy
4. Engage the electric utility and building owners on
deploying grid-interactive technologies
5. Identify possible demonstration projects for lowcarbon microgrids
6. Lead engagement with utility and state partners to
understand infrastructure needs
Medium Term (3-5 Years)
7. Create a program to facilitate local district energy
connections
8. Examine ways to ensure the uptake of low-carbon
district energy by new buildings where feasible
9. Workforce Development
10. Engage building owners in expanding building to grid
or grid interactive tech
11. Ensure inclusion of renewable thermal in any rental or
transaction-point renovation
Long Term (5+ Years)
12. Use Community Choice Aggregation to provide new
mechanisms for renewable thermal deployment
13. Work with district energy system operators and legacy
utilities to plan for decarbonized transition

Equity: Flag

The City must take into account that the cost
of district energy and renewable thermal
energy systems may get passed on to
consumers in the form of increased energy
costs, creating a potential equity pitfall for the
most vulnerable residents. There might also
be inequities in access to renewable thermal
technologies.
Equity benefits could come from lower or
more stable energy costs. The City also has
the potential to take advantage of positive
equity impacts because district energy
systems enhance localized, more reliable
energy resources, which is of the greatest
benefit to vulnerable households.

Cross-cutting Issues

3.2 On-site Renewable Electricity Access (Part 1)
Overview
On-site renewable energy access is intended to promote
on-site renewable energy systems and provide support to
building owners who may install these types of systems.
This may include rooftop photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal,
battery storage or fuel cells – systems capable of supplying
renewable electricity to the host building. This Action will
have two tracks:
3.2.1 Rooftop Solar Requirements
3.2.2 Community Solar Access

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
3.2.1 Rooftop Solar Requirements - The purpose of this
requirement is to ensure that all new buildings, and in the
future, existing buildings have access to on-site solar
generation or could easily be retrofitted at a later date
where feasible.

Anticipated Annual GHG Reductions by 2050
While the installation of renewable electricity systems such
as rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels produces emissions-free
electricity, emissions reductions from such projects are not
included as contributing to the goals of the NZAP, as the
RECs from these systems are likely to be traded and counted
as emissions reductions elsewhere.

Key Activities
Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Study the potential to integrate a solar
installation requirement with existing
green roof requirements in collaboration
with universities
Medium Term (3-5 Years)
2. Adopt a solar PV or solar thermal
installation requirement for new buildings
based on the feasibility study
3. Consider expanding solar ready
requirement to existing buildings by
applying the requirements for solar ready
to major roof replacements.
Long Term (5+ Years)
4. Enhanced solar requirement: Determine
means to increase on-site renewable
generation requirements on existing
buildings.

Equity: Flag

The City must take into account that the costs of
rooftop solar energy sources could get passed on
in the form of increased energy and/or housing
costs, creating one or more potential equity
pitfalls.
The operational costs of renewable electricity are
very low and can result in energy cost savings for
vulnerable Cambridge residents, depending on
the ultimate distribution of program costs and
benefits. When paired with energy storage,
rooftop solar is also more reliable.

Cross-cutting Issues

Renewable Thermal Systems: Improved the
costs-effectiveness of renewable thermal options
Climate Change Preparedness / Resilience:
Strong overlap, enables greater access to on-site
back-up power supply for when larger grid is
down
Electric Transport: On-site renewables may serve
as a source of energy for charging electric
vehicles
Capacity / Local Carbon Fund: Carbon fund may
be used to offset costs of solar installations.

3.2 On-site Renewable Electricity Access (Part 2)
Overview
Community Solar Access: building off the solar
initiatives undertaken to-date, Cambridge should
pursue implementing a third-party administered
on-site solar action initiative. The primary aim of
this program will be to enable the installation of
solar on underutilized existing roofs and to give
more residents access to the economic and
resilience aspects of solar electricity.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
3.2.2 Community Solar Access- The purpose of
this action is to use market forces to add solar
photovoltaics to existing buildings connecting
developers to consumers who cannot add solar
themselves.

Anticipated Annual GHG Reductions by 2050
While the installation of community solar projects
produces emissions-free electricity, emissions reductions
from such projects are not considered to be contributing
to the emissions reductions goals because it is uncertain
where ownership of the RECs will lie.

Short Term (1-2 Years)
1. Further design of solar administrator
program, including function, structure,
and funding
2. Implement community solar program
based on program design
Medium Term (3-5 Years)
3. Continue to expand access to on-site
solar for all populations
4. Integrate program with virtual microgrid
concepts
Long Term (5+ Years)
5. Integrate with the enhanced community
aggregation program

Equity: Positive
The City has the potential to take advantage of
positive equity impacts because community
solar programs have the potential to reduce
energy costs for participants who are unable to
install solar on their own homes, and the
customer receives a bill credit for the energy
generated by their share. Access to community
solar projects should be prioritized for
vulnerable populations.

3.3 Off-site Renewable Electricity Access
Key Activities

Overview
While energy efficiency and on-site renewable
generation will contribute to buildings achieving net
zero emissions, they are not enough on their own to
achieve the net zero goals of the City. The dense urban
context in Cambridge requires that off-site renewable
electricity access be a part of the mix. Not all off-site
renewable contracts have the same impact, however.
When seeking to procure off-site renewables, it is
necessary to adhere to certain criteria to have a
positive impact. Under this action, criteria will be
adopted more formally so that corporate entities and
others have the guidance they need to enter into
renewable power purchase agreements.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
This action is considered enabling and is designed to
facilitate access to renewable energy resources when
demand reduction, on-site renewables, and
improvements to the state electricity grid are not
adequate for meeting NZE performance targets.

Equity: Neutral

The City should be mindful that the cost of offsite renewable energy sources (if those
resources turn out to be more costly) are likely
to get passed on in the form of increased energy
costs, creating a potential equity pitfall.
Alternatively, the low operational costs of
renewable electricity can result in energy cost
savings and less price volatility for vulnerable
Cambridge residents. As the state-wide, regionwide, and nation-wide share of renewable
energy grows, there is less need for existing or
new fossil fuel resources which often
disproportionately impact vulnerable
populations.

Action 4.1 Local Carbon Fund (Enhanced
Community Aggregation)

Packet Pg. 60

Overview
For Cambridge to become a net zero community, it will
require an annual emissions balance across the entirety of the
City’s building stock. The primary goal of this action is to
create a single point from which financial and technical
resources may be deployed in order to support the emissions
reductions in the other actions, thereby creating greater
flexibility and coordination of compliance with those actions.
The new approach to Community Choice Aggregation
recommended here, also known as Aggregation 3.0, moves
away from the boilerplate green energy business products of
deregulated energy retailers and utilities towards a local
ownership pathway allowing for widespread local deployment
of DERs, and energy improvements including efficiency
improvements and electrification.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
This action is considered essential for increasing the number
of energy efficiency and electrification projects completed. To
date the City, CEA, and Energy Advisor programs have had
good results in engaging building owners in energy efficiency
programs, but few projects have moved forward through
completion. This action provides a mechanism by which
projects, companies and individuals can achieve net zero
emissions through having better access to energy efficiency
and electrification resources and be able to participate in
renewable energy purchasing programs.

Anticipated Annual GHG Reductions by 2050
This action is considered an enabling action. By implementing
this action and providing access to financing as well as capacity
for building owners to take action on energy improvement
projects, emissions reductions will be realized in Action 1.1,
Action 1.2, Action 1.3, Action 2.1, and Action 3.3.

Projected Emissions Reductions by Source
When looking at the project savings potential for the updated set of Actions, we see that while energy efficiency and
demand reduction play a role in achieving the net zero goals, it is the ability of corporate entities, residents, and small
businesses to switch off of fossil fuel-based thermal energy and access enough renewable electricity that will determine
if the net zero goals are achieved.

•

Action 1.1: MassSave provides financial support and technical services for energy efficiency
building and infrastructure improvements to Massachusetts residents and businesses

•

Action 2.1: The state building code regulates energy use in new construction and is
established by the Board of Building Regulations and Standards, building off of the International
Energy Conservation Code

•

Action 3.2: The Department of Energy Resources regulates incentives such as the Solar
Massachusetts Renewable Target based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the
state legislature

•

Action 3.3: The Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the state legislature governs the
amount of renewable electricity which must be purchased by competitive electricity suppliers

INTRODUCTION
The City of Cambridge shares increasing global concerns about the climate change
crisis and the many challenges it presents. This crisis threatens the ability of the planet
to support secure, healthy, productive, and enriching lives for current and future
generations.

The climate imperative:
Climate change poses a
growing set of risks and
challenges to cities.

gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector, the United Nations (UNEP) issued its fifth Emission Gap report – an
analysis of the gap in emissions reductions needed worldwide to limit global warming in this century to a 2°C increase.
This was the level deemed necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global climate change. The report concluded that to
stay within the 2°C limit, global carbon neutrality must be achieved between 2055 and 2070. The most recent Gap
report found that, despite a decade of increased political and societal focus on climate change, emissions have not
been curbed and the gap is larger than ever. 1 This current science calls for a 50% reduction in emissions vs. 2015
levels by 2030 and 100% reduction by 2050. 2
In Cambridge, buildings are both part of the problem and part of the solution for addressing climate change. Over 80%
of greenhouse gas emissions are from building construction and operations 3. In our thriving economy, new buildings
continue to be developed. Since the original NZAP was issued (2015), more than 8 million square feet of buildings have
been added. If the City can get to net zero in the building sector, major progress toward achieving the U.N.’s goal of
carbon neutrality in our city will have been made. This is why Cambridge aims to achieve net zero emissions from
buildings by no later than 2050.
The current Net Zero Task Force wishes to underscore the urgency surrounding climate action. While the scientific
GHG emission reduction targets listed above should be the starting point for Cambridge’s activity, given the City’s
strong technical and financial resources and history of leadership by example, the Task Force recommends that
Cambridge seek to exceed the current science-based targets to drive innovation that can help other communities follow
suit at the pace needed to meet the global targets. To achieve even more aggressive action, the City should continue to
monitor and pursue emerging opportunities and technologies to accelerate GHG emission reductions and adapt the Net
Zero Action Plan appropriately on a regular basis. The stakeholders represented by Task Force members can help
achieve this innovation through peer learning activities, and state and federal government should be engaged to
advance the enabling policies and resources needed to achieve decarbonization of buildings at the local level. The Task
Force also recommends centralizing GHG emission reductions as a priority across City administrative, decision-making
and budgeting activities, including City Boards and Committees.
Net Zero Emissions are defined in the Net Zero Action Plan as a community of buildings for which annually all
greenhouse gas emissions produced through building operations are offset by carbon-free energy.

1.1

Background

The City of Cambridge has long been steadfast in addressing climate change. In 2002, the City adopted the Climate
Protection Action Plan. This was the first attempt at proposing emissions reduction targets and recommendations to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At that time, a goal was set to reduce emissions 80% by 2050. Over the years the

In November 2014, when Cambridge was examining strategies for reducing greenhouse

c

City has committed to a range of initiatives to support sustainable lifestyles and move the community toward greater
resilience to climate change. Some of the key initiatives undertaken over the years are listed in Table 1-1.
By 2013 there was growing concern in the community that any new development would make the goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions harder unless new developments were built to be net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Out
of this concern, a group of Cambridge residents filed a zoning petition (the Connolly Petition) requiring that all new
met with considerable apprehension. The main objections were that the types of buildings constructed in Cambridge
could not physically achieve a net zero performance on site and that the offset requirements would drastically increase
development costs, and thereby drive business out of Cambridge and stifle the local economy. While the Connolly
petition was met with concern, it was the catalyst in bringing the issue of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings to
the forefront.
In response, the City convened the Getting to Net Zero Task Force to foster a deep conversation among stakeholders
to advance the goal of setting Cambridge on a trajectory to becoming a “net zero community,” with a focus on carbon
emissions from building operations. To ensure a collaborative process, the City appointed representatives across
sectors to study the technical aspects in greater detail and develop comprehensive, actionable long- and short-term
recommendations.
The Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP) was adopted by the City Council in 2015 following an 18-month stakeholder process
to identify a phased set of actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing buildings. That plan
targeted a 70% reduction in City-wide building GHG emissions by 2040 to place the community on the pathway to net
zero emissions by mid-century, consistent with the 2014 UNEP Emission Gap report.
As part of the 2015 NZAP, the Task Force proposed that the whole suite of actions be reviewed every five years. These
reviews were intended to allow for the overall strategy to adjust based on changing economic, technology, and
stakeholder needs. The review process was to be similar to the initial work of the Task Force in that it would be
supported by staff and informed by a similar group of stakeholders. Driven by the principles laid out in the NZAP, the
five-year review would revisit both the full set of actions and the timeline and make recommendations for adjustments to
the Plan targets, actions, and tracking mechanisms moving forward. The resulting deliverables will serve as ongoing
evaluation tools, justification for adjustments, and an implementation plan for the updated Net Zero Action Plan.
The review of the NZAP began in 2019 with an evaluation of the plan’s impacts to date. The five-year review Task Force

Purpose and goals of the five-year review

The update to the 2015 NZAP was a cooperative effort between the City, the consulting team, and the Net Zero Task
Force. Driven by the principles laid out in the Net Zero Action Plan and with extensive stakeholder input, both the full set
of actions and the timeline of the original plan were revisited. In addition, the process of reviewing and identifying
adjustments to the plan considered the implications of actions with respect to equity and social justice; meaning the
not place undue burdens on vulnerable populations. In accordance with the governance plan, the study’s purpose was
to review the overall strategy to ensure that the framework continues to evolve in the desired manner. The objectives of
this review were:

APPROACH

The NZAP covers many different aspects of constructing, operating, and managing buildings. It is a complex plan that seeks
to achieve significant levels of emissions reductions from assets that are traditionally energy- and emissions-intensive. In
this plan we must consider how energy is used, where it comes from, and how it is distributed to commercial businesses and
residences within the community. We must also consider the implications of such a plan on costs, people’s livelihoods, and
various touchpoints of the plan, incorporated extensive stakeholder feedback, and reflected upon how to implement the plan
in an equitable way. This section presents a summary of the approach.

2.1

NZAP frameworks

There are three frameworks from which decisions about possible adjustments to the NZAP were made. The first is the
original NZAP principles. The second is a Science, Technology, Policy, and Equity review. Third, a framework for assessing
other benefits to the community beyond emissions reductions – co-benefits – was developed. In addition, the plan refers to
the Three Pillars of Decarbonization. These are three key strategies to decarbonize energy systems that align with the
United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and include energy efficiency, switching end-uses of fossil fuels to
electric-based equipment, and decarbonizing electricity (using renewable energy to produce electricity).

Three Pillars of Decarbonization
The set of ten principles that were developed during the 2015 NZAP process were intended to ensure that each time the
plan was reviewed it would evolve in a manner aligned with the original intentions. These principles were updated prior to
the 2021 NZAP review process to incorporate equity. With this latest addition, the driving principles for Actions included the
NZAP are:
•

Supports climate goals and healthy economic strategies

•

Uses science, market, and data-driven analysis to inform decision making

•

Supports an openness to new ideas when circumstances change

•

Commits to allowing the principle of offsets

•

Commits to measuring and monitoring impact over time

•

Ensures consultation is comprehensive and engages affected stakeholders

•

Commits to developing models that are replicable and informative to industry practitioners

•

Commits to implementing the Net Zero Action Plan through a racial equity and social justice lens (NEW as of 2020)

our economy. For this review, City staff worked closely with the consulting team to define a process that covered all the

c

Along with these ten principles, City staff and the consulting team worked with the Net Zero Task Force to consider
adjustments to the NZAP Actions through a Science, Technology, Policy, and Equity lens (see Appendix E for details). That
is, when considering adjustments:
•

For Science: What do the latest scientific assessments say about emissions reductions needed? Current guidance
is that they need to be reduced 50% below 2010 levels by 2030 4 and 100% by 2050 to stay below a 1.5-degree

•

For Technology: What enabling technologies have emerged since the 2015 NZAP efforts that may affect strategy?

•

For Policy: What Federal, State, and Local Policies have changed that support these efforts to reach the goals
(e.g., building energy codes)?

•

For Equity: It is necessary to recognize the social equity implications of policy choices and use an equity
assessment framework to help guide the process and ensure just outcomes (see Section 3.2).

In addition to the NZAP principles and the Science, Technology, Policy, and Equity lens, the team reviewed the potential cobenefits for each Action. This was a high-level qualitative assessment of what other benefits may be realized by adopting the
Actions being considered. The co-benefits assessments covered six main categories as shown in Table 2-1, with Equity built
into and spanning each. The co-benefits assessment was also used to determine priorities for action when the
implementation timeline was created (see Appendix A).

Equity and Net Zero Task Force Engagement Process
Equity and engagement process

A key element ensuring the continued forward-thinking of the Net Zero Action Plan is the plan's mandate that a detailed
review of the whole suite of actions be conducted every five years. The 2021 NZAP update is the first such review
conducted since the plan's adoption in 2015. The City of Cambridge is committed to implementing the Net Zero Action Plan
Applied Economics Clinic (AEC) as consultants to lead the City's stakeholder engagement process and to provide equity
and justice input on the City's Net Zero Action Plan. That work began with assembling a broadly representative stakeholder
Task Force. Throughout January and February 2020, the City – with support and guidance from AEC – invited participants
to the Task Force to best represent the City’s various stakeholders and vulnerable groups. The Task Force sought
representatives from a variety of backgrounds, including:
•

Community advocates and residents,

•

University representatives,

•

Planning board members,

•

Business, finance, property owner, and developer representatives,

•

Subject matter experts,

•

Community equity and environmental justice organization representatives,

•

Youth representatives,

•

Utility representatives,

•

Faith leaders,

•

Affordable housing representatives, and

•

Climate change advocates.

The final Net Zero Task Force included 25 members representing a range of technical expertise and community interests
(see list above). Despite efforts to recruit a diverse set of participants, more work can be done to engage the broader
community in the work of reducing GHG emissions from buildings.
The Net Zero Task Force held five remote full group meetings between November 2020 and June 2021. Two additional
meetings were held in fall 2021 to review and provide feedback on the draft Net Zero Action Plan Update. Each meeting was
two hours in duration, was open to the public, and included public comments in the last 10 minutes of the meeting. There
were also six remote working group meetings to flesh out sector-specific strategies to recommend back to the full group.
AEC provided equity guidance and input throughout the process as the Task Force worked to propose and evaluate
adjustments to the Net Zero Action Plan. For summary of meeting content and outcomes and meeting slides, see Appendix

By treating science, policy, technology, and equity as consistent and equal foundational principles throughout the interactive
planning process, the Task Force has assembled an implementation plan that represents a broad understanding of the
challenges and opportunities faced by the City as it moves toward Net Zero buildings.

2.2.2

Equity summary

The actions included in the City of Cambridge’s 2021 NZAP Update intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
Cambridge’s buildings by improving design and operational efficiency and using renewable energy sources. In this report,
each Net Zero Action has been evaluated and given an equity rating – positive, neutral, or flag – that is meant to reflect
whether the Action, as currently written, is likely to entail more potential equity benefits, neutral equity impacts, or requires
deliberate design to avoid equity pitfalls and maximize benefits, respectively. Net Zero Task Force members provided
feedback on these ratings in Meeting 5.
Potential equity benefits include:
•

Improved indoor comfort and air quality, which may be lower for vulnerable residents who struggle to pay energy
bills to condition their homes and who may suffer from respiratory health conditions,

•

Lower energy bills, which have the greatest positive impact on cost-burdened households (that is, housing and/or
energy costs that account for more than 30 percent 10 of income),

•

Increased access to financing and funding, particularly for those residents and businesses who lack upfront capital
and strong credit for loans,

•

Enhanced energy reliability, which is particularly important for residents with in-home medical equipment or other
reliance on consistent power supply, and

•

Increased resident engagement, awareness, and participation among all populations.

Potential equity pitfalls include:
•

Housing, rental, and energy cost increases, which have the greatest negative impact on cost-burdened
households,

Once an action is implemented, the following steps should be taken to monitor its equity impact and make adjustments as
needed:
•

Tracking as many adjustment metrics as possible (e.g., housing and energy costs, program participation,
improvements made, retrofits undertaken, pay-outs, renewable energy installations) to facilitate evaluation of the
distribution of impacts on residents;

•

Collecting disaggregated data that can shed light on the distribution of program impacts across Cambridge
residents and businesses;

•

Committing to reviewing program performance and providing public updates to facilitate transparency and
accountability;

•

Building in policy flexibility so that policies can be adjusted if inequitable outcomes arise;

•

Providing updates that are easy to find and understand and available in multiple languages; and

•

Engaging the community if a policy is adjusted– with representation from vulnerable residents – to provide
guidance and feedback.

Not all the data needed to track the distribution of Net Zero Action Plan equity impacts as described above currently exists or
is available to the City. Additional efforts would be required to access and create appropriate data and to measure progress
toward equitable and just community impacts, with roles both for the City and stakeholders including utilities and building
owners.

GHG EMISSIONS: RECENT TRENDS AND IMPACTS OF ACTIONS TO-DATE

To begin this process of updating the NZAP, DNV conducted an assessment of recent GHG emissions trends and the
impacts of the actions taken over the first five years of the plan’s implementation. This assessment provided both a topdown view of year-over-year building sector GHG emissions overall, and context from a bottom-up perspective where the
impacts of different activities were measured. This section provides an overview of the building sector emissions and

3.1

Building sector GHG emissions profile

City staff have been tracking emissions through community-wide inventories as part of the commitment the City of
Cambridge has made to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. These inventories have provided a necessary foundation for
enabling Cambridge to set emissions reductions targets and engage specific market sectors in actions to reduce emissions.
The most recent full community-wide inventory was completed in 2017 and covers emissions from buildings’ energy use,
transportation, solid waste, and wastewater management for the baseline year of 2012. 11 This inventory showed the building
stock contributes nearly 80% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the City, making it the key sector to address to
meet the City’s emissions reduction goals. As part of this review, the Buildings Sector inventory was updated for the years
2012 through 2019. Emissions by building and fuel types were analyzed to aid in the assessment of recent building-related
emissions trends.
The updated inventory data provides a year-over-year emissions profile from building-related energy use in the City. The
emissions calculations are based primarily on electric and gas consumption in the City but include fuel oil consumption and
distribution systems losses as well. The consumption data were aggregated to broad industry sectors and building types
within the City following standard methodologies for calculating emissions set forth in the Global Protocol for Communityscale GHG Inventories 12. The detailed methodology is included as an Appendix F. Table 3-1 provides the emissions by
year and sector for this time. Figure 3-1 provides a graphic charting these trends.

The inventory data shows that although emissions fluctuate year to year, the general building sector emissions trend has
increased slightly since 2012. There are many external factors that lead to fluctuations in emissions, including electric grid
emissions factors, weather, and occupied floor area. DNV performed a regression analysis on the emissions data to better
understand what may be driving the year-to-year changes. The analysis considered degree day data, policies enacted
during this time, and commercial and residential floor area data and found that overall:
•

The commercial sector has twice the impact on emissions trends as does the residential sector.

•

More cooling degree days (an amount of time during the year when cooling is in demand in buildings) correlates
with higher GHG emissions.

•

Floor area added within the City from new construction projects was not statistically associated with changes in
total emissions, as emission increases from new buildings were balanced out by increased efficiency and
renewable electricity supply to the existing building stock.

While the primary drivers of emissions trends cannot be determined for certain, this analysis offers clues as to what has
influenced emissions changes in recent years. Per the findings above, it should be expected that in the coming years as
temperatures increase due to global warming that cooling demand will also increase. This will contribute to more emissions
unless these systems are supplied with electricity from renewable resources. As for commercial buildings, addressing
emissions from this sector will have a greater influence on the current trends than the residential sector. The current
inventory does not take into account voluntary green power purchases, which could result in lower electricity sector
emissions. Without emissions reductions from this segment, there will be little change in the emissions trajectory.
Figure 3-2 provides a comparison of the current trajectory versus the business as usual (BAU) projections and the 1.5°C
UNEP target. The current trajectory is shown as the Recent Emissions Trendline in the chart below and was based on the
emissions data from 2012-2019. The BAU forecast is the expected emissions forecast into the future from 2015 if no

intervention had taken place to curb emissions at the state or local level beyond the electricity emissions savings expected
from the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is based on historical population and jobs growth. What is clear is that if
the current trends persist, the gap between actual emissions and the reductions needed to meet the UNEP targets will
continue to increase, making it more and more difficult to achieve the City’s goals for 2030 and beyond.

Through this review, it was found that the primary focus over the first five years of the NZAP has been on confirming the
feasibility of actions, designing the policies and programs from which the actions will be implemented, and getting the
appropriate regulatory and reporting structure in place. Of the actions adopted in 2015, six were found to be beyond the
feasibility and program design phase and were being implemented (i.e., the policy or program has been established and is
being executed). Based on the review of the NZAP action-related documents, we noted the following:
•

Four NZAP actions were determined likely to have had measurable impacts in the first five years of the program:
Custom Retrofit Program (Action 1.1.1), Green Building Requirements (Action 2.3), Renewal of Municipal Building
(Action 2.4.2), and Rooftop Solar Ready Requirements (Action 3.2).

•

The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) enacted in 2014 is considered part of the NZAP, but
emissions impacts will not exist until the performance improvement requirement is added.

•

The Community Choice Aggregation program (CCA) was not an action originally adopted within the NZAP, but it is
supportive of the Energy Supply action (NZAP Action 3).
The City’s renewable energy production goals are being met by multiple solar-related initiatives including Sunny
Cambridge, Custom Retrofit Solar Advisor, and Rooftop Solar Ready, and are further influenced by the Article 22,
Green Buildings Requirements.

The bottom-up review confirmed that significant efforts have been made to lay much of the groundwork for future success
including policy planning, design, and regulatory action. Through the actions that are being implemented, there have been
quantifiable emissions impacts, but the quantifiable impacts are not necessarily fully reflective of the efforts to date. Overall,
the review and assessment of the NZAP actions found that:
•

The 2015 NZAP has laid the groundwork to reduce emissions from the Cambridge building stock with quantifiable
impacts from five strategies aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, improving the performance of
new construction, and providing more renewables in the energy supply.

•

Nearly 1,100 buildings in the City now report their energy and water usage to the City annually through the Building
Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO), providing valuable information for planning and with future
performance requirements currently being planned.

•

Of the five NZAP Actions that were identified as contributing to measurable results to-date, improvements to data
collection and program tracking are needed. The emissions savings could only be calculated for four of those
actions based on availability of data, representing only 1% of the of the total buildings sector emissions in 2015.

There is a long lead time in obtaining project performance data for some of the NZAP actions, making it difficult to determine
the real impacts of the program over the initial five-year period. To mitigate this, a recommendation was made to create a
more robust system for reporting and tracking project-level performance data. While saving significant work, time, and
money over having to collect performance data periodically, it will also provide the City more insight into the progress and
performance of actions on an ongoing basis. Further, while it is expected the emissions trajectory will turn downward in the
coming years as more impactful measures are taken, at both the state and local level, and more robust data management
practices are implemented, the City needs to remain vigilant in its approach and find additional ways to cut emissions.

As may be seen from the table, some of the original actions have been removed. There were several reasons for removal of
an action: the action having been substantially completed in the last five years; the action being integrated with another
action because of its fit; or there not being enough return on the action to justify continuing to pursue it. The following are the
actions that were removed from the NZAP:
•

Action 1.1.4, Operations and Maintenance Plans for New Construction: This action is incorporated into the Green

and a robust technical analysis of the possible impacts of the actions in the coming decades. These adjustments provide the

•

Action 2.2.1 Market Based Incentive Program: Removed due to revenue neutral policy constraints.

•

Action 2.2.2, Height and FAR Bonus: This action was determined to require a significant legislative push for these
incentives to be implemented, and that they would become obsolete when the net zero new construction standards
are adopted in the coming years.
Action 2.5, Removal of Barriers to Increased Insulation: This action was substantially completed when in 2019, the
City adopted amendments to Article 22 that allow for increased flexibility in the installation of exterior insulation.

•

Action 5.1, Communications Strategy: This strategy is on-going and was integrated with the NZAP Operation
Requirements (Section 6).

•

Action 5.2, Ongoing Capacity to Manage NZAP: Integrated with the NZAP Operation Requirements (Section 6).

•

Action 5.3, Net Zero Lab Standards: This action was integrated with Action 2.1, Net Zero Requirements for New
Construction.

In addition to the removal of some actions, Action 2.2 Green Building Requirements was substantially reworked to
emphasize embodied emissions as net zero new construction standards (Action 2.1) are phased in to address operational
emissions. Action 3.3, Off-Site Renewable Electricity Access, was re-worked to help address a need for assistance and
guidance when businesses seek out options for purchasing grid-supplied electricity from renewable resources.
In creating this new structure, the overlap between the implementation of actions as well as the cross-cutting themes (issues
that may be influenced by multiple actions) was taken into consideration. The cross-cutting themes were equity, energy
resilience, the renewable thermal energy transition, electric transport, and local capacity. Each of these themes was heavily
weighed when thinking through possible adjustments. The reason for continuously reflecting upon these issues was to
create a set of actions that would enhance a fair and just clean energy transition, seek out opportunities to improve the
energy resilience of the community while reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based energy, and ensure that a structure was in
place and that resources would be available to implement this plan.
In reviewing the updated list of Actions, it is useful to keep in mind that some actions are “Enabling Actions,” while others
have a direct impact on emissions. The Enabling Actions are those Actions designed to support the emissions reductions in
another Action. Whether an Action is enabling or has direct impacts is noted in the Action descriptions, along with a brief
description of the interplay between Actions.
This relationship between the Actions is emphasized in Figure 4-1 below. Here one can observe the organization of the
Actions as they address existing buildings, new buildings, and energy supply through complementary approaches of
requirements, incentives and technical support, and enabling actions. The success of the Net Zero Action Plan hinges on
the interplay of these approaches, with requirements to drive action in buildings coupled with incentives, support, and
enabling actions to facilitate the significant activity needed to achieve the NZAP goals across each sector. This framework
strategy to decarbonizing buildings means that the Net Zero Action Plan should be taken as a whole versus relying on any
single action or approach to reducing GHG emissions from buildings in Cambridge.

The NZAP Actions should also be assessed in regard to City control and where there is reliance on regional and state actors
to achieve the Action goals. In some cases, the City may be precluded from carrying out specific activities, such as providing
direct financial support to private entities due to statutory limitations, which would therefore require outside action.
Partnerships and advocacy should be established with the appropriate institutions to accomplish the activities of each
Action. For example:
•

Action 1.1: MassSave provides financial support and technical services for energy efficiency building and
infrastructure improvements to Massachusetts residents and businesses. MassSave is governed by 3-Year Plans
established by the Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee convened by the Department of Energy Resources and
approved by the Department of Public Utilities.

•

Action 2.1: The state building code regulates energy use in new construction and is established by the Board of
Building Regulations and Standards, building off of the International Energy Conservation Code. The Act Creating a
Next Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts adopted in March 2021 tasks the Department of Energy Resources
to create a Net Zero Stretch Code for optional municipal adoption by late 2022.

•

Action 3.2: The Department of Energy Resources regulates incentives such as the Solar Massachusetts
Renewable Target based on the Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the state legislature.

•

Action 3.3: The Renewable Portfolio Standard adopted by the state legislature governs the amount of renewable
electricity that retail electricity suppliers must obtain and provide to their customers. The Act Creating a Next
Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts authorizes additional offshore wind procurement to further increase the
amount of renewable energy provided to the electricity grid.

4.1

Action Area 1 – Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is one of the three pillars of decarbonization, along with electrification and renewable energy supply. The
energy transition cannot happen without the more efficient use of energy in buildings, especially when considering that
energy demand will grow as the City continues to grow. In addition, coupled with another pillar of decarbonization,
electrification, the need for more energy efficient electricity using equipment becomes more apparent. As end-users switch
such as heat pumps and electric vehicles, demand for grid-supplied electricity will continue to grow.
Within the Energy Efficiency Action Area, this report focuses on three actions, each of which provide value beyond
emissions reductions. They are:
•

Action 1.1 – Custom Retrofit Program for Residential Buildings and Small Businesses

•

Action 1.2 – BEUDO Emissions Reductions Requirements for Large Buildings

•

Action 1.3 – Upgrades at Transaction Points

While BEUDO is expected to have the largest impact on emissions in the City overall, the Custom Retrofit plays a significant
role in engaging residents and businesses (those not covered by the BEUDO requirements) in this effort. Further, when
considering the economic potential of emissions reductions sources (energy efficiency, on-site renewable energy
generation, and renewables purchased from sources outside the City – off-site renewables) the updated NZAP Model
indicates that about 18% of the reductions needed to reach net zero by 2050 can be expected to come from energy
efficiency related activities.

Action 1.1 – Custom Retrofit Program for Residential (up to 50 units) and Small
Commercial
Overview
and small commercial buildings are operating optimally and, where
possible, are retrofitted to maximize energy efficiency. As part of this
Action, the City of Cambridge develops and implements programs to
help Cambridge residents and small businesses better access energy
efficiency resources through outreach, technical assistance, and other
support services. These programs are currently administered by the
Cambridge Energy Alliance (CEA) in collaboration with Eversource
and are designed to help residents connect with vendors, statewide
incentives, and other resources for energy upgrades.
Over time, tools and policies may be directed broadly across building
types, but to achieve the necessary emissions reduction in the near
term, this Action will have three areas of focus:
•

Multi-Family Custom Retrofit

•

Low- and Moderate-Income Multi-Family Engagement

•

Small Commercial Custom Retrofit

Interplay with other Actions:
Action 1.3 – Upgrade at Transaction
Points
In the years to come, as the requirements
for energy efficiency improvements at point
of sale or time of renovation are adopted,
the projects savings from the Custom
Retrofit program will have greater overlap
with the Action 1.3. To simplify accounting
of savings, all savings will be attributed to
Action 1.3 after 2025.

Action 4.1 – Local Carbon Fund and
Community Aggregation
One of the main barriers to scaling energy
efficiency improvements is access to
financing. Action 4.1 would enable a greater
amount of custom retrofit projects to be
completed if that action is implemented.

As these programs continue to be implemented, the City will work with Eversource, the energy efficiency program
administrators, and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to refine state-level incentive programs in ways that address
the needs of the community. City staff will continue to monitor the uptake and participation in these programs by population
segment and location and coordinate with Eversource on ways to adjust and achieve greater results.

Equity
This Action aims to enable retrofitting of existing homes and businesses in Cambridge to achieve

increased risks from poor indoor air quality (such as residents with respiratory conditions or residents
that are home-bound) and households and businesses experiencing energy burdens. This Action is unlikely to impact
housing costs on its own, since it focuses on helping residents to access existing retrofit programs rather than changing the
way those retrofit programs work.

Implementation and Key Activities
The key activities for implementation of this action are provided in Table 4-2. As the pilot retrofit programs are well underway
now, it is important that as part of the NZAP the performance of the programs to-date be reflected upon and evaluated. From
this the City will be able determine what adjustments should be made to the programs as they expand and attempt to
engage harder to reach participants. As such, in the implementation of this Action, the initial steps are centered on
completing this evaluation work. From there, opportunities will be sought out to expand program outreach and set the stage
for success in the coming years.

benefits, including potential for jobs creation, reduced building operational costs and improved
comfort for building occupants.

Short Term Activities (1-2 Years)
1.

Evaluate Pilot Programs

As part of the roll-out of the retrofit pilots, an evaluation of the current programs will be completed, and the value of the
technical support currently offered will be verified. Experience has shown that the target participants for the programs,
including small businesses and multi-family properties, are often hard to reach. The evaluation will aim to identify
strategies and adjustments that may be made to maximize participation.

2.

Determine program adjustments

There are three aspects to this activity:
•

Informed by the evaluation of the pilots, coordinate and align Retrofit Advisor services with MassSave
program structures and delivery mechanisms.

•

Identify a pathway building on current low and moderate income (LMI) and community assistance programs

•

Continue to establish the CEA as a resource hub for energy management information for homes and small
businesses

3.

Advocate for state energy efficiency program alignment

Since the City generally cannot provide direct funding to private entities, the state-level utility sponsored MassSave
program is critical to providing financial assistance to building energy retrofit projects in Cambridge. The City should
continue to advocate for MassSave program alignment with Cambridge’s needs and goals through the Energy Efficiency
Advisory Council three year planning process to deliver maximum support for Cambridge buildings.
4.

Integrate Resilience and Electrification w/EE

The retrofit action presents an opportunity for improving resilience in homes and businesses as well as an opportunity to
make electrification improvements. As part of this program, the City should seek to build in an electrification opportunities
and resilience improvement assessment as part of any energy audit.
5.

Identify means access to project financing

One of the key barriers preventing many homeowners and small businesses from completing energy upgrades as
identified through the NZAP stakeholder workshop process is access to capital and financing. Therefore, it will be
important to identify funding or financing vehicles that owners currently have access to, understand where there are
gaps, and, if needed, create a support structure that links retrofit activities to capital. These investigative activities could
become a basis for designing a local carbon fund/community aggregation program in later years. This activity will
continue into the medium term
6.

Increase transparency in program implementation

As a means to engage residents and businesses in taking a more active role in energy management, better energy data
access and sharing needs to be available. As part of this activity, an appropriate energy data sharing platform should be
identified and made available. This activity will continue into the medium term
Long Term (5+ Years)

Integrate with Enhanced Community Aggregation Program

As the City works to assess and develop a carbon fund and enhanced community energy aggregation programs (see

regulation. At the core of this action is the existing Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance adopted in 2014, 13 which enables City staff and the public to monitor building energy and water use
over time and ensure that emissions are moving toward the net zero objective. In addition, this data provides building
owners an understanding of how their building’s energy use compares to that of their peers and helps them determine where
improvements can be made.
Under this action, technical support and information about state-level financial resources for building owners will be made
available to help them achieve significant energy savings. This will build on the Building Energy Retrofit Program 14 currently
administered by the City in partnership with Eversource as the state-level energy efficiency program administrator.

costs would be most harmful to vulnerable residents and businesses – particularly those already experiencing housing cost
burden. That said, housing costs in Cambridge are driven by a variety of market forces such as the balance of supply and
demand, so the specific impact of energy upgrades is uncertain. The current BEUDO performance requirement proposal
would give increased flexibility to affordable housing and allow affordable housing developers to access financial support to
meet their upgrade requirements.
BEUDO requirements also entail potential equity benefits. Building upgrades will result in more energy efficient homes and
businesses, which improve indoor comfort and air quality and lower energy bills. Such improvements are of the greatest
benefit for vulnerable households and businesses, particularly those with increased risks from poor indoor air quality (such
as residents with respiratory conditions or residents that are home-bound) and households and businesses experiencing
energy burdens.

decarbonized buildings in a way that is financially feasible by
tapping into financing streams that become available at
transaction points. Transaction points may include time of sale,
time of lease, and time of renovation/permit application.

Interplay with other Actions:
Action 1.1 – Custom Retrofit for
Residential and Small Commercial
As the requirements for energy efficiency
improvements from this action are adopted,
there will be overlap with savings from the
Custom Retrofit program. To simplify
accounting of savings, all savings will be
attributed to this action after 2025, the year
this action is anticipated to be implemented.

Transactions may also include time of replacement for heating

opportunities for this equipment before 2050. A key challenge to address with this action will be the issue of condominiums
which may have common HVAC systems, especially in older buildings.

in building operational costs, thereby increasing housing costs. At the same time, transaction
points may provide access to financing, such as mortgages, which can make energy upgrades more accessible to building
owners. Higher housing costs would be most harmful to vulnerable residents and businesses – particularly those already
experiencing housing cost burdens.
Upgrades at the time of building transaction points also have the potential for equity benefits. Building upgrades will result in
more energy efficient homes and businesses, which improve indoor comfort and air quality, and lower energy bills.
Vulnerable residents, like those with increased risks from poor indoor air quality due to respiratory conditions or lack of
mobility, would benefit most from more energy efficient homes.

Action Area 2 – New Construction

Cambridge has been a consistent leader on the issue of green design and sustainability in new construction. Fifteen years
ago, there were no LEED certified buildings in Cambridge. Today there are more than 95, including 54 that were built or
renovated in the last five years. As the green building industry has continued to mature, additional green building standards
are being developed. At the state level, new legislation requires the development of a net zero building stretch energy code.
requirements. In addition, embodied carbon in building design and construction has become an important issue for building
professionals to address. By only focusing on emissions from the operation of buildings, the impacts of new construction
may be substantially underrepresented. Material production for new buildings, including steel and concrete, are energyintensive processes with their own emissions profiles, and there are strategies that can be used to curb emissions resulting
from these processes that the City can control, such as encouraging adaptive re-use, which would lessen the need for
producing new materials. The Actions for new construction have been adjusted to reflect these changing market conditions,
and a new focus on embodied carbon has been added.
The timeline for the proposed Cambridge net zero new construction targets will follow the development and release of the
Massachusetts net zero stretch code, which is expected to be available for adoption in 2022. The green building
requirements will continue to exist to take advantage of the environmental and social benefits associated with green building
practices, but will also be the key mechanism for addressing embodied carbon in new construction projects. The City should
continue to show its leadership and create an environment of innovation through the municipal building net zero standards.
All of these net zero targets for new construction projects should continue to be tracked and evaluated at regular intervals to
measure the carbon impact of the actions.

practices, state-level code initiatives, and the urgency of addressing
climate impacts from new construction activities. These original targets
can be used as a reference point but should be adjusted as more
information about the state net zero stretch code becomes available.
It is anticipated that the Commonwealth will take into consideration the
feasibility and rate of market adoption of net zero design for different
building types. Still, Cambridge will need to continue to be an advocate
at the state level to ensure that state standards reflect local needs while
aligning with net zero goals. Engagement with stakeholders involved in
laboratory design will continue to be a key aspect to ensuring a
successful rollout plan for net zero adoption. Any target dates for
adopting sector-based NZE, whether set by code or not, will
continuously be monitored and revisited as needed.

Action 2.3 – Increase Green Building
Requirements
As the requirements for net zero new
construction are adopted, there will be
overlap with savings from the Green Building
Requirements. To simplify accounting of
savings, all savings from non-municipal new
construction projects will be attributed to this
action after 2025.
Action 3.3 – Off-site Renewable
Electricity Access
Because many new construction projects
cannot achieve net zero status without the
ability to purchase grid-supplied renewable
energy, the criteria for purchasing that
electricity defined in Action 3.3 will be used
to achieve the goals of this action.

code, the City must consider any incremental cost of net zero buildings – that is, costs above
and beyond non-net zero buildings – that may be passed on in the form of increased housing
or rental costs, creating a potential equity pitfall. The State is required to solicit significant public input, including specifically
from underserved communities, in the stretch code development process.
Net zero buildings also entail potential equity benefits. Net zero buildings are more energy efficient, improve indoor comfort
and air quality, and can lower building operational costs. Such improvements are of the greatest benefit for vulnerable
households and businesses, particularly households with increased risks from poor indoor air quality and small businesses
with narrow profit margins.

Implementation and Key Actions
The key activities for implementation of this action are provided in Table 4-6. Since this action depends on action at the state
level, there will be a need for advocacy at the state level to ensure that proposed policies and implementation timelines align
with the interests of Cambridge. In the meantime, the City should continue to explore and identify ways to fill the gaps left by
state policies.

As we begin to transition to net zero codes, however, this action will also continue to evolve. While green buildings reduce
energy consumption, they also provided opportunities for overlapping sustainability outcomes, including social equity,
human health, and environmental stewardship. This action also provides the opportunity for the City to address another not
previously considered but highly impactful source of carbon emissions: embodied carbon. Worldwide, construction materials
are responsible for over 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions, with particular impact in the short term. 15 The purpose of
this action will change over time from a focus on energy use to a focus on reducing GHG emissions from construction and
choice of materials. These emissions will be targeted through the calculation and assessment of potential standards for
managing embodied carbon in the construction and renovation of new and existing buildings.

Greener commercial and residential buildings also entail potential equity benefits because more energy efficient buildings
improve indoor comfort and air quality and lower building energy costs. Greener buildings also provide benefits beyond
energy, including site sustainability, indoor environmental quality, non-toxic building materials, reductions in waste

Action Area 3 – Energy Supply

Heating and cooling demand within the buildings in Cambridge is the largest source of emissions in the City. Addressing this
issue will result in the largest emissions impact if electricity and natural gas supply is converted to a low carbon energy
supply system. Achieving a low carbon energy supply, however, will be a significant challenge with complex parts to be
addressed, many of which are not under the City’s direct control. Many of the components needed to change the mix of

Successfully decarbonizing the energy supply systems will require a combination of approaches over time. This section
focuses on three main components: electrification of thermal systems; local (on-site) renewable energy supply; and
procurement of renewable energy credits (RECs) from acceptable sources outside of the City (off-site renewable electricity).
Electrification of buildings with grid-supplied electricity will play a central role in decarbonizing energy systems, as will the
introduction of district energy systems in areas of high energy demand. While the actions in this section mainly focus on
building-level strategies, district energy should remain as an option as it offers increased system efficiency, resilience, and
flexibility of energy sources.
The Actions in this section cover all three aspects of transitioning to a low carbon energy supply system. Action 3.1, Carbon
Free Energy Supply, covers electrification and the development of fossil fuel free energy systems such as air- and groundsource heat pumps. Action 3.2, On-site Renewable Electricity Access, seeks to cover the deployment of renewable
electricity systems within the City of Cambridge, including on-site solar photovoltaics arrays and other distributed energy
resources. Where there are emissions remaining from grid-supplied electricity that is not produced from renewable
resources, there will need to be a means for procuring grid-suppled renewable electricity that complies with a city standard
for RECs. This is the intention of Action 3.3 – Off-site Renewable Electricity Supply.

Action 1.3 – Upgrades at Transaction
Points
The Transaction points action is intended to
increase energy efficient retrofits in homes
and small businesses; however, that action
will also encourage electrification. There is
likely to be some overlap between those
electrification projects and emissions
reductions achieved here through the Clean
Heat program.

Cross-Cutting Issues

Renewable Thermal Systems

• This action would be supportive of and have direct influence over
the expansion of renewable thermal systems in the city

Climate Change Preparedness &
Resilience

• In addition to providing an opportunity to move equipment out
of flood-prone basements, these systems provide needed cooling
during times of extreme heat. On the flip side, electrified systems
depend on a functioning grid.

Contribution to Net Zero Objective
About 49% of the emissions attributed to the building sector are from fossil fuel use.
Accordingly, transitioning buildings to renewable thermal systems will be an important part of
achieving progress on Cambridge’s Net Zero goals. Electrification, using heat pumps and
heat pump water heaters, enables buildings to eliminate fossil fuel use, instead using electric

systems that can be powered by renewable electricity. District energy will continue to play an
important role in commercial and institutional hubs, and potentially in other neighborhoods
through the emerging ‘geomicrodistrict’ model. Existing district energy systems that are currently fossil-fuel based will need
to transition to low-carbon sources of energy.

form of increased energy costs, creating a potential equity pitfall. Increased energy costs would be
of the greatest harm to the City’s most vulnerable residents and small businesses. Inequitable
uptake of renewable heating solutions – for example, if wealthy, homeowner residents are the program’s primary
beneficiaries rather than renters, low-income residents, or even condo owners who may have greater difficulty switching to
renewable thermal systems, this is another potential equity pitfall. Should that happen – that is, primarily wealthy residents
are converting away from fossil fuel heating sources – another equity pitfall is created whereby lower income utility
customers are left behind and face increased fossil fuel heating costs because those costs are spread over fewer
customers.
The City also has the potential to take advantage of positive equity impacts because district energy systems enhance
localized, more reliable energy resources, which is of the greatest benefit to vulnerable households that face increased risks
from heating interruptions – for example, households with young children, or infirm or elderly members. Removing fossil fuel
combustion from inside of homes is also a key equity benefit by addressing a major source of indoor air pollution.

Implementation and Key Activities
The key activities for implementation of this action are provided below. This action seeks to find ways to scale up the
adoption and installation of electrified heating and hot water systems, to enable the expansion of low-carbon district energy
where appropriate, and to prepare the electrical grid and natural gas network for the transition to renewable thermal energy
supply.

Continue to build the Cambridge Clean Heat Program and expand targeted outreach efforts

The Cambridge Clean Heat program, which currently supports residents through technical guidance on heat pumps and
solar hot water, should continue to grow. Expanded outreach to residents, including to likely adopters and through
such as air conditioner replacement, will connect people to the Cambridge Clean Heat program at useful engagement
points. Finally, continued data collection through the program, such as information on existing conditions in buildings, will
help inform program needs. The City should continue to implement and expand the clean heat program through strategic
outreach to residents who have adopted other climate-friendly measures (e.g., electric vehicle owners), targeting
buildings with planned AC replacement, and coordinating outreach with community partners and continuous improvement
using the learnings from the CEA evaluation (2021).

Expand support for multifamily building electrification

The Cambridge Multifamily Retrofit Advisor should expand its work to support electrification, through preliminary
feasibility assessments and recommendations for renewable thermal, additional educational resources, and identification
of installers
3.

Engage with development teams and partner organizations on district energy

To identify potential demonstration projects, City staff should seek to engage with project development teams to explore
options for clean district or renewable thermal energy systems for new buildings. The City will continue to follow the
developments of the shared geothermal model or “geomicrodistrict” – a study sponsored by Eversource to assess the
feasibility of geothermal district systems. The geomicrodistrict approach would offer buildings the ability to access shared
geothermal heating and cooling, with infrastructure installed and managed by the utility. The geomicrodistrict model may
offer a pathway to high-efficiency electrification that is scalable, taps into load balancing opportunities across a
neighborhood, and would create less demand on the grid than individual building electrification. The City will continue to
engage the partners at the local, state, utility, and U.S. Department of Energy that are supporting this work and will
examine the role it can play in new district energy systems in Cambridge. This activity will continue into the medium term.
4.

Engage the electric utility and building owners on deploying grid-interactive technologies

City staff should continue to engage with the electric utility in conversations aimed at identifying and deploying
flexible/grid-interactive technologies that can support electrification, including planning for grid capacity in context of
distributed energy resources that could be adopted through an enhanced aggregation (Action 4). This activity will
continue into the medium term.

4.3.2

Action 3.2 – On-Site Renewable Electricity Access

Overview
On-site renewable energy access is intended to promote on-site renewable energy systems and provide support to building
owners who may install these types of systems. This may include rooftop photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal, battery storage

3.2.1 Rooftop Solar Requirements
3.2.2 Community Solar Access
For Action 3.2.1 – Rooftop Solar Requirement, Cambridge will continue to pursue a requirement for onsite renewable energy
generation for new buildings, with a focus on solar. For roofs on new construction projects with available area, especially
those where the potential to generate significant amounts of solar energy relative to building energy consumption, policies
should aim to include solar PV and/or thermal. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that suitable new buildings and,
in the future, existing buildings have access to on-site solar generation or could easily be retrofitted at a later date where
feasible.
For Action 3.2.2 – Community Solar Access; building off the solar initiatives undertaken to date, Cambridge should pursue
implementing a third-party administered on-site community solar initiative. The primary aim of this program will be to enable
the installation of solar on underutilized existing roofs and to give more residents access to the economic and resilience
aspects of solar electricity. The program should be designed to overcome current roadblocks in deploying rooftop solar
including: lack of building owners’ upfront capital, challenges with building owners receiving technical and financial decisionmaking information, and owner/tenant split incentive challenges. This program will be designed to facilitate further
development of solar and other distributed energy resources on-site. While reducing emissions at the state level, the
program is also intended to promote resilience and enable access to solar for community members where there would
otherwise exist ownership and economic barriers.

available rooftop area have onsite solar energy systems. In doing so, the City must take into
account that the costs of rooftop solar energy sources could get passed on in the form of

increased housing costs, creating a potential equity pitfall.
Renewable electricity produced on-site also entails potential equity benefits. The operational costs of solar electricity are
very low and can result in energy cost savings for vulnerable Cambridge residents, depending on the ultimate distribution of
program costs and benefits. When paired with energy storage, rooftop solar is also more reliable and resilient than electricity
from the grid, which is of the greatest benefit for households that face increased risks from power outages, like those that
require refrigerated medicines or rely on oxygen machines or nebulizers. An indirect equity benefit of increased on-site
renewable energy is that it serves to increase the total share of electric demand being met with renewables and decrease
the need for existing or new fossil fuel resources. The communities that shoulder the greatest burden of fossil fuel resources
– and therefore stand to benefit the most from greater amounts of renewable energy – are vulnerable communities beyond
Cambridge’s borders.

Implementation and Key Actions
The key activities for implementation of this Action are provided in the tables below. For this Action, the mandate moves
from requiring new roofs to be “solar ready” to requiring installation of e rooftop solar systems. One item that needs to be
coordinated to implement this Action is the recently adopted requirement for green roofs.
Table 4-10. Key activities for implementation of Action 3.2.1 – Rooftop Solar Requirement
Short Term Activities (1-2 Years)
1.

Integrate Solar Requirement with Green Roof Requirement for New Construction

One possible conflict with a solar requirement for new roofs is the recently adopted green roof requirement. Before
adopting a solar requirement, the City should study the potential to integrate a Solar Requirement for New Buildings with
Green Roof requirements in collaboration with universities. If on-site solar is not required through the state net zero
stretch code (see Action 2.1), a policy should then be developed for appropriate new buildings to be required to have
solar panels installed. These may be either or both photovoltaic and solar thermal.

Action 3.2.2 Community Solar Access
Contribution to Net Zero Objective
The purpose of this action is to add solar photovoltaics to existing buildings and connecting consumers who cannot add
solar themselves to the financial benefits of community solar.

Anticipated Level of GHG Reductions
While the installation of community solar projects produces emissions-free electricity, emissions reductions from such
projects are not considered to be contributing to the emissions reductions goals because the State’s SMART incentives for
community solar automatically sell the solar systems RECs to the utilities to meet the State’s Renewable Portfolio Standard.
With the exception of municipal solar projects, most if not all private solar projects, participate in SMART 17.

Equity
Under Action 3.2.2, Cambridge would give more residents the ability to access the financial
benefits of low-cost solar electricity by implementing an initiative to enable the installation of

Equity Rating:

community solar systems on existing buildings. The City has the potential to take advantage of

positive equity impacts because community solar programs reduce energy costs for participants.
Community solar programs allow multiple customers to select the portion of the solar panels they
own, and the customer receives a bill credit for the energy generated by their share. Vulnerable residents and businesses
benefit most from lower energy costs, particularly those experiencing energy burdens. A potential equity pitfall would be an
inequitable distribution of access to renewable energy generation from community solar projects, for example, if wealthier
residents are the program’s primary beneficiaries. This pitfall could be avoided by designating some or all of the community
solar specifically for low and moderate-income residents.

Implementation and Key Actions
The key activities for implementation of this action are provided in the tables below. For this Action, the intent is to design,
develop and implement a program that will provide greater support to residents and businesses for installing community
solar systems and providing the community solar generated discount electricity to Cambridge residents and businesses.

2.

Action 2.1 – Net Zero New Construction
Because many new construction projects
cannot achieve net zero status without
purchasing RECs, the criteria defined in this

achieve the NZE goals of Action 2.1.

The RECs must be assigned to the building or aggregated
portfolio of buildings in Cambridge and cannot be traded for
the duration of the contract;

3.

The source is a renewable energy generating system that meets City guidelines.

Under this action, these criteria will be adopted more formally so that corporate entities and others have the guidance they
need to enter into renewable power purchase agreements that meet the standards of the City. Further, this action aims to
provide residents and small businesses access to renewable energy through aggregation, levering the combined purchasing
power of the community. The pace of increased renewable electricity on the grid through the state Renewable Portfolio
Standard will affect the priority of this action, and the City should support efforts to accelerate the development of renewable
electricity at the state level.

should be mindful that the cost of off-site renewable energy sources (if those resources turn out to
be more costly) are likely to get passed on in the form of increased energy costs, creating a potential equity pitfall. Increased
energy costs would be of the greatest harm to the City’s most vulnerable residents and small businesses – particularly those
paying energy costs greater than 30 percent of their income.
Procuring off-site renewable energy also entails potential equity benefits. The low operational costs of renewable electricity
can result in energy cost savings and less price volatility for vulnerable Cambridge residents, depending on the ultimate
distribution of program costs and benefits. As the state-wide, region-wide, and nation-wide share of renewable energy
grows, there is less need for existing or new fossil fuel resources. An indirect potential equity benefit is that vulnerable,
frontline communities beyond Cambridge’s borders stand to benefit the most from the reduction of fossil fuel use.

Action Area 4 – Financing and Capacity Building

Identifying upfront capital to achieve long-term energy savings and GHG reductions is often cited as the greatest obstacle to
building owners completing more energy retrofit projects. This revised action is aimed at providing building owners the
resources they need to make informed decisions about energy improvements and a means to access financing or funding
for their projects. Further, this action is intended to lay the groundwork for various aspects of an enhanced Community
to own distributed energy resources (DER) using “green bond” financing to purchase the distributed energy systems and
have customers opt to buy shares in the DERs, thereby conferring an ownership share to the participants and allowing the
participants to realize the cost savings that occur with DER installations. By buying shares in DERs, customers can
participate in DER ownership without high upfront capital costs or good credit, or even participate as renters. CCA 3.0
resolves to disengage from, rather than mitigate the impacts of fossil fuel power plants by planning and facilitating voluntary
investment in local renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. Furthermore, CCA 3.0 facilitates voluntary
investment in small DERs on homes and businesses that reduce demand for grid and pipeline resources, rather than
centralized renewable generation that adds to infrastructure demand. CCA 3.0 achieves equitable energy ownership, as
opposed to equitable consumption of energy. 18

so would provide the City with the potential to take advantage of positive equity impacts because:
•

More energy efficient homes and businesses improve indoor comfort and air quality and lower energy bills –
improvements that are of the greatest benefit for vulnerable populations, particularly those with increased risks from
poor indoor air quality (such as residents with respiratory conditions or residents that are home bound) and
households and businesses experiencing energy burdens;

•

More financing and funding for efficiency and electrification upgrades has the potential to increase access to these
improvements among Cambridge residents and overcome existing equity barriers like creditworthiness and capital
expenditures;

•

Energy aggregation purchasing programs enhance customer engagement, which helps ensure procedural equity
and broadens and deepens customer participation in energy aggregation programs;

•

Energy aggregation purchasing programs enhance customer investment and ownership structures, which create
new value structures that are designed to benefit all community members – including those that cannot invest
directly; and

•

Energy aggregation purchasing programs enhance flexibility by allowing customers to choose whether to invest
directly and whether to participate in the program at all.

Implementation and Key Actions
The key activities for implementation of this action are provided in the table below. The primary goal of this action is to create
a single point from which financial and technical resources may be deployed in order to support the emissions reductions in
the other actions.

3.

Identify a pathway for establishing revolving loan fund

The proposed amendments to the BEUDO ordinance contemplate a mechanism for building owners to make alternative
compliance payments if unable to achieve required GHG reductions. A revolving fund should be established in a manner
that avoids conflicting with statutory limitations on investment of city funds and allows funds to be earmarked for
programs and projects that reduce GHG emissions throughout the building sector. The City should also continue to
feasibility study.
4.

Program design - Enhanced Community Aggregation model development

In addition to these other short-term activities, the City should continue to explore and define the structure for a CCA 3.0
model for Cambridge leveraging the relevant activities from other NZAP actions that are supportive of the design of the
CCA 3.0 to build the case for a comprehensive aggregation program.
5.

Investigate acquiring State energy efficiency funds

Study the potential advantages, disadvantages, and feasibility of acquiring the state energy efficiency and renewable
energy funds collected through utility bills by establishing a Program Administrator. Such a role may provide a funding
source and information instrumental to a successful CCA 3.0 program.

Medium Term Activities (3-5 Years)
6.

Develop the operational model for the CCA 3.0

Building on the above activities, a mechanism should be identified to collect and distribute the funding needed to
complete energy efficiency and electrification projects. The City should then reassess and confirm the practicality and
feasibility of pursuing a CCA 3.0 model.
7.

Link relevant activities from other Actions

If the feasibility of the aggregation program is confirmed, activities from other actions would be linked to capital and
needs and offered through the aggregation program.
Long Term (5+ Years)

Implement Enhanced Community Aggregation Program

Over the longer term, a Carbon Fund/CCA 3.0 program should be implemented. The program would be established as
the primary vehicle for facilitating net zero emissions actions for homeowners, renters, and business owners by providing
them access to resources for demand reduction, electrification projects and renewable energy resources and creates
universal ownership opportunities.

ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF ADJUSTED ACTIONS

Throughout the NZAP review and update process, estimates of emissions impacts were made to inform Task Force
discussions and arrive at a mix of actions that could achieve the net zero emissions goals. As the adjustments to the list of
actions came into focus, a more comprehensive model providing future emissions projections was created. This modeling
showed that the net zero emissions reduction goals are achievable with the mix of actions proposed as part of the 2021
reductions activities including significant action by BEUDO buildings, additional renewable energy from the electrical grid,
and rapid decarbonization of thermal energy supply through electrification and/or district energy technology.
It should be noted that any model is merely a representation of the future and therefore should not be relied on as a precise
prediction. The Net Zero Action Plan is meant to be a high-level framework for action to reduce GHG emissions from
buildings and lacks the specificity needed to model precise results, such as exact kWh and therms reduced by an action in a
certain building sector. Therefore, rather than expecting the NZAP model to determine whether Cambridge will hit specific
GHG reduction targets, it should be used to observe the general magnitude of impact of each action relative to the other
actions and the interaction between them, such as whether renewable electricity will come from the grid versus local
renewable electricity procurements. The model is a tool that can be adjusted over time and used to track more specific
outcomes as individual actions are implemented. Appendix G explains the methodology and assumptions behind the NZAP
model.
The emissions reductions achieved by the Net Zero Action Plan are associated with three main strategies: energy efficiency,
renewable energy, and electrification of thermal emissions. These strategies align with the three pillars of decarbonization.
Achieving the net zero goals also relies on the wider electricity grid becoming cleaner, with more renewables generating
power being integrated over time, which will be driven by Commonwealth policy and goals. Figure 5-1 shows the share of
emissions reductions anticipated from each of these to meet the 2050 goals.

The 2021 NZAP Model was built
to consider the emissions

example), then the emission reductions are the sum reductions from the efficiency improvements and renewables.
When looking at the projected savings potential from the decarbonization strategies in both Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2, it can
be seen that, while energy efficiency and demand reduction play a role in achieving the net zero goals, it is the ability of
corporate entities, residents, and small businesses to switch off of fossil fuel-based thermal energy and access enough

This finding differs from the 2015 NZAP, which determined that to meet the net zero goal, the majority of emissions
reduction would need to come from load reduction (energy efficiency). The difference is that access to off-site renewable
electricity was not considered in the original NZAP model outside of the state Renewable Portfolio Standard. The general
approach was focused on maximizing on-site solar potential and mitigating the remaining emissions through load reduction
strategies. The analysis used for the 2021 NZAP Update considered historical participation in energy efficiency programs, as
well as the technical and economic feasibility of significantly reducing energy consumption in existing buildings. With energy
efficiency potential limited by technical and economic constraints, it was determined that the majority of emissions reductions
will likely need to come from the procurement of renewable energy. Since most on-site solar is incentivized by state
programs that re-sell the RECs (renewable energy attributes) to other parties, those emissions savings cannot be attributed
to Cambridge. Figure 5-2 shows the projected emissions reductions by decarbonization strategy through 2050 with these
limitations factored into the updated NZAP model.
Figure 5-2: Projected emissions reductions by decarbonization strategy through 2050

renewable electricity that will determine if the net zero goals are achieved.

Figure 5-3 and Figure 5-4 shows the estimated emissions reductions by action. They show the anticipated emissions
reduction for actions that are considered to have direct emissions impacts, assuming rates of adoption/policy requirements
as described in Section 4 of this Plan and current state policy. Enabling actions are not shown. The figures highlight the
importance of the BEUDO Performance Requirements (Action 1.2) and the state grid emission reductions with respect to the
other actions and the overall goals. The electrical grid and BEUDO emission reductions are also highly interactive; the more
renewable electricity that is provided by the electrical grid, the less renewable electricity that has to be directly procured by
BEUDO buildings, and vice-versa. The state grid mix similarly affects the impact of additional renewable electricity
procurement for non-BEUDO buildings via the City’s aggregation program. Independent of the state grid are the emissions

from fossil fuel combustion that must be eliminated by BEUDO buildings, non-BEUDO residential buildings (Action 1.3), and
non-BEUDO commercial buildings (Action 3.1). The rate of decarbonization of these buildings will be impactful in meeting
the 2030 UNEP goal. The decarbonization of these thermal energy uses, however, will ultimately also be dependent on
access to renewable electricity either through direct procurement or the state grid.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND
IMPLEMENTATION

While there is a need to demonstrate bold leadership and set goals today, there is also a need for ongoing management of
this initiative to ensure that the targets remain relevant and achievable for the community. The City should continue to work
to identify tools, innovative ideas, training opportunities and other resources to support residents and commercial property
management and operational requirements for implementing the NZAP. As noted in Section 4, two Actions from the 2015
NZAP have been integrated into this operational plan and are no longer considered Actions on their own. These include:
•

Action 5.1, Communications Strategy: This strategy is on-going it has been integrated here with the NZAP
operation requirements

•

Action 5.2, Ongoing Capacity to Manage NZAP: Similarly, this is considered part of the on-going management of
the NZAP

6.1

NZAP prioritization

Successful implementation of the updated Net Zero Action Plan will require careful planning, coordination, and partnerships
to move the many Actions and Activities forward on schedule. Appendix A shows a proposed implementation timeline for
the updated Actions and key Activities. The timeline seeks to reflect the prioritization of each Action that was discussed and
agreed on by the Net Zero Task Force in meeting 5. As shown in Figure 6-1, each Action was rated for its GHG reduction
potential, resilience benefits, other co-benefits, equity, and “Consider.it” polling results of the Task Force members. The
Task Force considered each of these factors and worked together to arrive at an “adjusted ranking” for each action to
indicate the holistic prioritization of that Action in the view of the Task Force. While all of the final recommended Actions are
important and should be pursued, this prioritization is helpful for assessing the amount of resources assigned to each Action
and the order in which they may be pursued. The results of this prioritization will be discussed in the annual implementation
reports going forwards and can be reviewed and adjusted by Climate Protection Action Committee oversight as well as the
next five-year review.

Key partnerships

While the Community Development Department will remain the primary implementation agency for the Net Zero Action Plan,
support from and coordination with other City departments such as the Department of Public Works and Inspectional
Services along with external actors will be essential to the success of each Action.

•

Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) – CDD staff will ensure that annual progress updates proceed and
are reviewed by CPAC to ensure accountability and transparency.

•

Resilient Cambridge – The climate adaptation plan resulting from the Climate Change Preparedness and
Vulnerability Assessment with a range of recommendations for buildings in Cambridge, including energy resilience.

•

Envision Cambridge – The citywide plan adopted in 2019 centered on the core values of livability, diversity and
equity, economic opportunity, sustainability and resilience, community health and wellbeing, and learning. The plan
includes goals, indicators, and targets for climate and environment, including a 2030 emissions reduction target of
50% below 2012 levels.

•

City Council Climate Crisis Working Group – A group of community advocates and local and state climate experts
working over the course of fall 2021 to provide a prioritized list of specific actions the City can take to address the
urgent challenge of climate change.

As noted in Section 4, partnerships should be sought with outside entities that are instrumental for enabling the success of
the Net Zero Action Plan. Key examples include state and local government along with the regional utilities which control
essential policies, resources, and infrastructure related to NZAP Actions including the amount of renewable electricity
provided by the grid and incentives for building energy retrofits. Ongoing engagement with local and regional stakeholders is
also essential, beginning with those stakeholders represented by the Net Zero Task Force members. Each Action will
continue to include targeted stakeholder engagement through working groups and other forums as appropriate.
Furthermore, the Task Force recommended encouraging peer learning opportunities for Net Zero stakeholders to share best
practices, troubleshoot barriers, and identify lessons learned that can help accelerate implementation of the Plan. The City
will collaborate with the Task Force members to arrange these peer exchanges on a regular basis.

6.3

Continued program governance

The 2015 plan proposed that the whole suite of NZAP Actions be reviewed every five years. This is an important piece of the
implementation of the plan as the scientific guidance behind climate change adjusts, technologies evolve, and impacts
occur. These reviews allow for the overall strategy to be adjusted as needed to accommodate changing conditions and
stakeholder needs. The review process will continue to utilize the expertise and guidance of a Net Zero Task Force and
outside experts as needed, to support City staff in the execution of the plan.
The regular reviews of the overall strategy will continue every five years with specific stakeholder review and consultation for

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

The achievement of net zero interfaces with a number of other City objectives and concurrent planning initiatives, including:

each of the actions as needed. The current Task Force expressed interest in a more frequent review schedule to account for
quickly-changing technologies and policies related to building GHG emissions; the next 5-year review is scheduled to begin
in 2025, only 3 years after the conclusion of this review process. A specific goal of the 2025 review will be to revisit the 2030
and subsequent emission reduction targets. To ensure that the framework evolves in the desired manner, the
implementation of the framework will adhere to the following principles developed during the initial Net Zero Action Plan
process:
•

Supports long-range healthy economic strategies as well as climate goals

•

Uses market-based and data-driven analysis and decision making

•

Commits to identifying and testing the best available policies, practices, and technologies, and supports an
openness to new ideas when circumstances change

•

Commits to allowing the principle of offsets as long as it can be demonstrated that the offset produces actual GHG

•

Commits to measuring and monitoring impact over time that leads to course corrections where required

•

Ensures consultation is comprehensive and engages affected stakeholders, the general public, and subject matter
experts

•

Commits to developing informative and replicable models that will be shared with others

•

Commits to implementing the Net Zero Action Plan through a racial equity and social justice lens [added in 2020]

As part of the NZAP implementation, the City will conduct ongoing monitoring and reporting of progress toward the Net Zero
Action Plan goals. Each year an annual report will be issued. These annual reports are intended to provide an overview of
each action planned for that year, including the action items, progress made, and next steps to reach the annual goals. The
annual report will also provide quantitative outputs as appropriate for each action, for example, the number of green
buildings permitted during the past year, as well as broader outcomes such as changes in community-wide GHG emissions.
In collaboration with the City, the Climate Protection Action Committee will provide oversight, ensuring that an annual report
is issued and that the actions that have been taken to implement the NZAP and track greenhouse gas emissions trends from
building operations are documented. The annual review process will provide an explicit opportunity to consider new
technologies and policies that could accelerate achievement of NZAP goals and incorporate them into the Plan as
appropriate.

6.4

Program tracking and metrics

It is expected, as implementation of the NZAP continues, that Cambridge will see greater levels of emissions reductions as
more impactful actions are implemented, including Action 1.2, BEUDO Performance Requirements, and Action 3.3, Off-Site
Renewable Electricity Access. Significant work remains ahead however. By 2030, emissions need to be reduced by 600,000
MTCO2e to align with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement limit. The City needs to remain aggressive in its approach and closely
monitor progress. In order to track progress more efficiently, a more robust system for reporting and tracking project-level
performance data from all actions will be needed for residents, businesses, and program implementers to access. The City
will work to establish such a system; a listing of the metrics needed for properly assessing impacts is included in Appendix
C. The City will continue to receive annual aggregated energy consumption data from Eversource and update the
Community GHG Inventory at least every five years. Effort should be made to collect the more granular data associated with
individual NZAP actions to facilitate future 5-Year Plan Reviews. Consistent tracking and monitoring of data will also enable

reductions, whether in the form of an energy efficiency or renewable energy activity

the City to take action and make adjustments if certain actions are not performing as expected more quickly; these data will
be shared as part of the NZAP annual review process to inform activity-specific targets and adjustments.

EVALUATION SUMMARY

The City of Cambridge has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and has implemented a range
of initiatives to support sustainable lifestyles and move the community toward greater resilience to climate
change. The building stock contributes over 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the city and
therefore is considered a key sector to address to meet these goals. In 2013, the city convened the Getting
to Net Zero Task Force, which sought to advance the conversation around net zero emissions from buildings.

•

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment

•

Improving energy efficiency and conservation in existing and new buildings

•

Supporting renewable energy generation both on- and off-site

•

Promoting best practices to engage and educate users and influence occupant behavior

The Net Zero Task Force established a principle that the suite of actions adopted under the NZAP was to be
reviewed every five years throughout its implementation, and those actions be continuously monitored and
adapted based on changes in GHG emission reductions in buildings and shifts in the science, technology, and
policy context of GHG reduction needs and opportunities1. Each year since 2016, the city has issued annual
progress reports summarizing the progress of each of the NZAP actions. There are five categories of actions
within the NZAP that are covered:
•

Action 1 – Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings

•

Action 2 – Net Zero New Construction

•

Action 3 – Energy Supply

•

Action 4 – Local Carbon Fund

•

Action 5 – Engagement and Capacity Building

This report provides the results of an independent assessment done by DNV GL on the impacts of the
various actions taken in the first five years of the NZAP. The assessment involved a review of communitywide emissions trends in recent years in relation to future goals. It also involved a bottom-up assessment
wherein each of the NZAP actions were reviewed and measurable impacts were quantified. The combination
of these two approaches helped determine the impact of the NZAP since 2015 and indicate the scale of
action needed going forward.

Summary of Results
The review and assessment of the NZAP actions found that:

In 2015, the city adopted the Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP), which included a series of actions aimed at:

The NZAP has laid the groundwork to reduce emissions from the City of Cambridge building stock.
Progress to date includes quantifiable performance of five strategies aimed at increasing the energy
efficiency of buildings, improving the performance of new construction, and providing more
renewables in the energy supply; however, there is much work to do to meet the city’s net zero
emissions goals.

Nearly 1,100 buildings in the city now report their energy and water usage to the city annually
through the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO), providing valuable information for
planning and with future performance requirements.

•

Five NZAP Actions were identified as contributing to measurable results to date; however, the
emissions savings could only be calculated for four of those based on availability of data, and the
emissions savings from these actions represent only 1% of the of the total buildings sector emission

•

The long lead time in obtaining project performance data for some of the NZAP actions makes it
difficult to determine the real impacts of the program over the initial five-year period. To mitigate
this, it is recommended that a more robust system for reporting and tracking project-level
performance data be instituted. Appendix A lists the metrics needed for properly assessing impacts
from NZAP actions. While saving significant work, time, and money over having to collect
performance data, it will also provide the city more insight into the progress and performance of
actions.

•

While it is expected the emissions trajectory will turn downward in the coming years as more
impactful, more mature GHG-reductions actions and data management are implemented, the city
needs to remain aggressive in its approach and find additional ways to cut emissions.

BUILDING SECTOR EMISSIONS PROFILE

As part of the impact assessment DNV GL reviewed the 2012 Community-wide GHG Inventory and updated
the buildings sector emissions inventory for the years 2013-2018. The updated inventory provided a yearover-year emissions profile from building-related energy use in the city. The intent of compiling this
information was to determine if NZAP has had observable impacts on building emissions to-date.
DNV GL gathered the information needed to generate annual CO2e emissions totals for the building sector
for the years 2013-20182. The emissions calculations are based primarily on electric and gas consumption in
the city but include fuel oil consumption and distribution systems losses as well. This aligns with the
methodology used in the 2012 Community-wide emissions inventory. The consumption data are aggregated
to broad industry sectors and building types within the city. These classifications reflect the best of our
ability to classify the data using the combination of the Eversource industry sectors and the MA OLIVER 3
version of Cambridge’s tax parcel tax codes. Some of the groups—notably energy services—are not always
discernible in the data available.

To provide more context, a comparison was done of the recent emissions trends to what was anticipated in
NZAP planning models. When comparing what was forecasted for year-over-year emissions reductions in the
NZAP Model (adjusted to 2014 actual emissions) with the actual emissions over the same time period, there
is some deviation from what was expected. For instance, in 2017, the emissions reduction target was

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

Table 2-1: Building Sector CO2e emissions 2013-2019

exceeded; however, other years show higher-than-expected emissions. There are many external factors
such as emissions factors, weather, and increases or decreases in assigned floor area that are known to
influence emissions based on energy consumption, which limits the insight this type of assessment can
provide for this short of a timeframe. Because of this, it’s difficult to conclude from a top-down assessment
what impacts NZAP has had on emissions from the building sector through 2018. A more detailed analysis
and modeling exercise considering the variables and possible causes of changes in emissions would be
needed.

as usual (BAU) projections and the 1.5°C UNEP target. The current trajectory is shown as the Recent
Emissions Trendline in the chart below and was based on the emissions data from 2012-2019. The BAU
forecast is the expected emissions forecast into the future from 2015 if no intervention had taken place to
curb emissions at the state or local level beyond the electricity emissions savings expected from the
Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is based on historical population and jobs growth. What is clear is
UNEP targets will continue to increase, making it more and more difficult to achieve the City’s goals for 2030
and beyond.

The primary focus over the first five years of the NZAP has been on confirming the feasibility of actions,
designing the policies and programs from which the actions will be implemented, and getting the appropriate
regulatory and reporting structure in place. Of the 17 actions, 6 have been implemented (i.e., the policy or
program has been established and is being executed). DNV GL reviewed NZAP-related documentation and
data to determine which of the actions that are being implemented have measurable results that can be
used as part of the bottom-up assessment. Table 3-2 summarizes the information that was reviewed,
including which actions or initiatives were determined to have had measurable impacts.

This is further explained in Section 4.4.1.
***The impacts of the Rooftop Solar Ready program were determined to be best assessed in aggregate with

Based on the review of the NZAP action-related documents, we noted the following:
•

Four NZAP actions were determined likely to have had measurable impacts in the first five years of
the program: Custom Retrofit Program (Action 1.1.1), Green Building Requirements (Action 2.3),
Renewal of Municipal Building (Action 2.4.2), and Rooftop Solar Ready Requirements (Action 3.2).

•

With respect to Action 2.4.1, Net Zero Requirement for New Construction of Municipal Buildings, the
NZAP has influenced the standards for design for new municipal buildings as a guiding principal, and
in 2017 a policy that new municipal buildings be net zero ready was adopted. Projects that were
built to these standards include the King Open School which was completed in 2019 and is fossil fuel
free; 859 Mass Ave which underwent a deep energy retrofit in 2017 and installed ground source
heat pumps to covers its heating and cooling needs; and the Martin Luther King School which
opened in 2016 was designed to perform 69% better than baseline standards and has over 1,600

solar panel producing almost half of its electricity use. Year-over-year savings from these projects
have been flagged for future assessment.
•

The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) enacted in 2016 is considered part of the
NZAP, but no emissions savings can be attributed to the action at this time. We anticipate that the
addition of the performance improvement requirement will result in measurable impacts in the
coming years, but this will need to be supported by a more robust system of data management.
There are nearly 1,100 buildings in the city that now report their energy and water usage to the city

annually, which provides valuable information for planning, but the dynamic nature of the data
makes it difficult to analyze.
•

The Community Choice Aggregation program (CCA) was not an action originally adopted within the
NZAP, but it is considered supportive of the Energy Supply action (NZAP Action 3) and was therefore
considered within the impact assessment.
The City’s renewable energy production goals are being met by multiple solar-related initiatives
including Sunny Cambridge, Custom Retrofit Solar Advisor, and Rooftop Solar Ready, and are further
influenced by the Article 22, Green Buildings Requirements. Because of the overlap in the tracking
data available, the best way to measure the impacts and progress toward the City’s goals of
increasing building integrated solar within the city was to combine the initiatives into one multiinitiative solar strategy.

The key parameters used to determine the impacts for each action were primarily energy use savings,
program participation, or energy generation capacity. The approach was to identify the key parameters
needed to assess the action impacts and derive total emissions savings over the five-year period using those
parameters (see Table 2-3). The energy supply impacts of the CCA Action were based on participation in the
Green+ product program, while participation in the CCA Standard Product program was used as an indicator
of the strength of the CCA program overall.
The baseline year from which impacts are measured is 2015. Emissions, electricity, or natural gas savings
are cumulative from that point forward, so that the total impact is the sum of annual savings achieved for
the five-year program period (2015-2019). Where applicable, indicators of performance were captured as
well, such as program participation rates.

NZAP ACTION IMPACTS

This section provides a summary of the measurable impacts of NZAP actions. In the NZAP, individual actions
are associated with their action categories: Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings (Action Category 1); Net
Zero New Construction (Action Category 2); Energy Supply (Action Category 3); Local Carbon Fund (Action
Category 4); and Engagement and Capacity Building (Action Category 5). Included here are the impacts of
the measurable individual actions in relation to the City’s net zero emissions goals, resources available to
actions. Overall findings are compiled in Section 5, Results.

NZAP Action Category 1 – Energy Efficiency in Existing
Buildings
4.1.1 Custom Retrofit Program (NZAP Action 1.1.1)
This action is part of Action 1 – Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings. As stated in the NZAP Annual
Progress Reports, this action is intended to ensure that all buildings are operating optimally and, where
necessary, retrofit to maximize efficiency. After the initial program design, the Custom Retrofit Program
began in 2017 with the implementation of the Multi-family Energy Pilot. The program has been integrated
with BEUDO and expanded to other building sectors as part of the new Building Energy Retrofit Program.
The program aims to provide building owners with a voluntary, cost-effective pathway for reducing energy
use and GHG emissions. This action is supportive of future BEUDO energy performance improvement
requirements (NZAP Action 1.1.2).

Current Tracking Methodology
The City currently tracks projects coming into the Multi-family Retrofit Program through documentation
provided by the program implementers: New Ecology Inc., who is contracted by the City and serves as the
Retrofit Advisor, and CLEAResult, the implementer for MassSave, the state-wide energy efficiency program.
As of the end of 2019, 50 properties encompassing 1,450 multifamily housing units had been enrolled in the
program; however, few projects are known to have been completed to date. Because of this, the data
needed to determine quantitative impacts from this action are not yet available.
The Building Energy Retrofit Program is also tracking program participation and impacts through the
Eversource Retrofit Consultant since the program inception in Fall 2019. As the BEUDO performance
improvement requirements are implemented, it will be important for the city to distinguish between and
track those retrofit projects that resulted from the initial pilot program and those that resulted from the
BEUDO Building Energy Retrofit Program.

Impact Assessment
DNV GL performed an initial documentation review to determine an appropriate method for calculating
program impacts from the Custom Retrofit Program. Of primary interest were the cumulative emissions

track the progress of each action over time, and a summary of the ancillary benefits from undertaking these

savings over the five-year period since the NZAP was adopted. For this action, savings are based on:
•

Information from the buildings that have completed custom retrofit projects as part of this program
including measures installed and the estimated electricity and gas savings as provided by the
program implementers, CLEAResult and New Ecology.

•

If available, data from those residential unit that participated in the Solar Advisor program as
provided by Zapotec.

The pilot program was focused on the multifamily housing sector. Savings from this action would be
determined by collecting information on various aspects of the program. Ideally, the number of residential
units included per project (based on enrollment); the electricity and gas consumption (pre- and postinstallation); and estimated electric and gas savings per project would be provided. In this case, however,
much of the project-level data was not available due to many of the enrolled projects not having been
completed. Table 4-1 provides a summary of the needed and available data for calculating expected

Cambridge Community Development Department (CDD) and the solutions identified through those
discussions.
•

Equity – The program has promoted energy efficiency in multifamily buildings and within those

NZAP Action Category 2 – Net Zero New Construction
Article 22 Green Building Requirements (NZAP Action 2.3). As stated in the NZAP Annual Progress Reports,
this action is intended to promote environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient design in new
construction and major renovation projects in the city. This ordinance was updated in December 2019 to
adopt LEED Gold v4, Passive House, or Enterprise Green Communities as the reference standards and
require new buildings to submit a decarbonization pathway along with their permit application.

Current Tracking Methodology
The City has developed a comprehensive database of buildings that have been subject to the ordinance and
tracks the number of projects and equivalent level of certification through the building permit review
process. All data on the proposed new buildings are stored in the database, which includes level of
certifiability, year of building permit, square feet of building, project type, building use, and the credits
achieved by each project. In FY19, 16 projects were permitted following the green building review
representing almost 3.5 million square feet of development, including 1,300 residential units.

Impact Assessment
DNV GL performed an initial documentation review to determine an appropriate method for calculating the
impacts from the Green Building Requirement. Article 22 data dates back to 2011, well before the adoption
of the NZAP; however, emissions reductions over the last five years are of primary interest. Article 22
requires subject buildings to be designed in accordance with the latest version of the applicable green
building certification program. For the purposes of this impact assessment, LEED V4 was assumed to be the
design standard. LEED V4 requires that non-residential buildings be designed to perform a minimum 5%
better than ASHRAE 2010.
DNV GL reviewed BEUDO data to determine if actual performance data could be used to assess the impacts
of building constructed under Article 22; however, few matches could be made based on building addresses,
square footage, and year built. In the absence of performance data, DNV GL estimated the impacts of the
Article 22 Requirements relative to the base building energy code in place in 2015 in order to provide the
city an indication of the impacts of the program and guidance on how to assess impacts in the future.
In this respect, the impacts of Article 22 were based on buildings permitted since 2015 achieving an
assumed energy performance improvement over baseline design. Since LEED V4 requires a modeled

communities who benefit most from reduced energy costs.

performance improvement of at least 5% over ASHRAE 2010, and Article 22 required subject buildings to be
built to an equivalent of LEED-Silver standards up until December 2019, DNV GL estimated a 15%
performance improvement over IECC 2012/ASHRAE 2010 code. Table 4-3 provides a summary of the
information used for calculating emissions impacts.

time. In Massachusetts the energy code is updated every three years. At the time of the NZAP being
adopted, the energy code in Massachusetts was based on IECC 2012/ASHRAE 2010, but in 2017,
Massachusetts updated the codes to reflect IECC 2015/ASHRAE 2013. In addition, Cambridge had been an
earlier adopter of the State Stretch Energy Code, which required a 10% improvement over base code.
It’s important to consider these constantly changing baseline conditions as well as the relationship between
state and local action when assessing the impacts of Article 22. For Cambridge, Community Development
Department staff have continued to work with State code officials on the development of more stringent
codes using their experience with the stretch energy code. Where Cambridge has led, the State codes have
tended to follow. To adequately capture the effects of this interplay, DNV GL calculated the emissions
savings from the original base code (IECC2012/ASHRAE 2010), which more clearly demonstrates the effects
of the increase in new construction code requirements over time from which the impacts of Article 22 are
based. Table 4-4 provides a summary of those impacts.

Going forward, it is recommended that the emissions and energy savings stemming from of Article 22 be
calculated based on the reference standard in 2015. This will capture the impacts of the change in new
construction standards over time regardless of State or local action. Further, it is recommended that action
be taken to ensure that the actual energy performance of buildings constructed under the Article 22
requirements are reported and tracked through BEUDO. This can be accomplished by using the common
building identifier codes that the city currently uses, but property addresses, ownership, and other
characteristics such as floor area must align between permit data and BEUDO reporting data.

Although LEED V4 references ASHRAE 2010 as the base code, local building codes get more stringent over

The green building ordinance allows for a focus on emissions reductions, and the leadership the city took to
enhance new construction projects early on resulted in progress toward the 2050 goals. However, until a net
zero requirement is adopted, new buildings will continue to increase GHG emissions regardless of policy. The
city continues to work with the State on these issues and is currently exploring the use of performancebased requirements as well as a voluntary net zero stretch code to better serve the city’s zero emissions
interests to address this.

Ancillary Benefits
The green building requirements have been in place for over 10 years and come with many ancillary benefits
that are inherent in Green Building Design and should be recognized. These include:
•

Improved health and wellbeing of the community – Green buildings have many benefits beyond
energy and emissions savings, including creating healthier, more comfortable indoor working and

•

Equity – Green buildings are often designed with access to public transit in mind, which improves
access to jobs and reduces the need to own an automobile.

•

Climate resilience – Improved occupant comfort and indoor air quality reduces vulnerability to
extreme temperatures and power losses and reduces risk exposure for vulnerable populations.

4.2.1 Renewal of Municipal Buildings (NZAP Action 2.4.2)
This action seeks to set an example of leadership in the energy efficient renewal of existing buildings in the
city. The improvements are part of the City’s facilities improvements strategy, which integrates energy
improvements with life safety and accessibility. This action has been ongoing since the adoption of the
NZAP.

Current Tracking Methodology
The City currently maintains a database of the city facility improvements. This data contains a description of
the project, the building where the project was completed, the estimated electricity and gas savings, costs,
incentives received, and funding source. Under the 2017 Municipal Facilities Improvements Plan (MFIP),
performance metrics and goals were established. This provides the underpinning for a robust tracking
system for this action.

Impact Assessment
DNV GL performed a review of the available documentation. Of primary interest is a determination of the
cumulative emissions savings over the five years since the NZAP was adopted. DNV GL based the impact
calculations on:
•

The list of projects that have been completed across city facilities.

•

The estimated electricity and gas savings from each project completed.

The retrofit projects for municipal buildings covered under this action span a wide range of building types
and project types. Building types include office buildings, schools, maintenance, and public safety buildings.
The project-level information for each building was used to determine the cumulative impacts of the action
from 2015 through 2019. Streetlighting projects and outdoor lighting projects for public spaces were not
included. Table 4-5 provides realized savings for this action.

Overall, the city’s continued investment in improving the energy efficiency of public buildings has resulted in
over 1,500 metric tons of CO2e emissions reductions—about an 8% reduction in municipal building
emissions since 2015. The performance is an indication of the success of the program in identifying high
impact energy efficiency improvements in municipal buildings. The challenge will be maintaining that level of
performance and energy savings in the years to come as opportunities for savings decrease.

Ancillary Benefits
The renewal of municipal buildings contributes positively to the community in many ways. By taking this
action, the city has demonstrated:
•

Leadership – The city has chosen to take an active role in promoting energy efficiency using its own
buildings as examples of the types of improvements that can be made. Maintaining these valuable
public resources also demonstrates the fiscal and public safety responsibility of the city.

•

Collaboration – The work performed to identify improvements and determine which projects should
be prioritized requires a significant amount cross-departmental collaboration. Much of this work was
performed through the MFIP.

•

Resilience – The MFIP provides a prime opportunity to identify vulnerabilities to climate change in
critical buildings and reduce the community’s risk of impacts from climate-related emergency
events.

NZAP Action Category 3 – Energy Supply
4.3.1 Solar Ready Rooftop Requirements (NZAP Action 3.2)
As stated in the NZAP Annual Progress Reports, this action is intended help meet the City’s net zero goals by
encouraging the installation of additional renewable energy generation, namely solar. Solar Ready means
that buildings can accommodate the installation of a future solar array (could be photovoltaic or solar
thermal).
The primary source of information for tracking the number of solar installations that have occurred as a
result of this action is building permit data; however, the permit data does not distinguish between
contributing programs. Because of this, the impacts of the Solar Ready Rooftop Requirements were

measured as part of the multi-initiative solar strategy (see Section 4.3.2).

Current Tracking Methodology
The City currently tracks solar installations through building permits. The projects that would be covered
under the Rooftop Solar Ready action, however, are new construction or major renovation projects where
the solar ready aspects are embedded within the building permit and not easily identifiable.

Impact Assessment
See Section 4.3.2, Multi-initiative Solar Strategy.

Ancillary Benefits
See Section 4.3.2, Multi-initiative Solar Strategy.

4.3.2 Multi-initiative Solar Strategy
The multi-initiative solar strategy stems from the City’s aggressive pursuit of solar energy within Cambridge
and there being multiple initiatives in place that promote the installation of solar systems. These include the
While the Solar Ready Rooftop requirement and Solar Advisor program are components of the NZAP, all of
these contribute to the city meeting its net zero emissions goal.

Current Tracking Methodology
The current method for tracking solar installations in the city is through building permits. The information
provided in the permit database, however, does not indicate which initiative (if any) prompted the
installation and the solar system. For this reason, the impacts of the solar initiatives were determined using
a combined approach.

Impact Assessment
DNV GL performed a review of documentation related to the Rooftop Solar Ready Action, Sunny Cambridge,
and the Custom Retrofit Solar Advisor program as well as the building permit data to determine an
appropriate method for estimating the impacts of these programs. The best way to estimate the impacts
from solar initiatives was to combine all solar strategies into one Multi-initiative Solar Strategy. Of primary
interest is cumulative emissions savings over the five years since the NZAP was adopted.
DNV GL estimated the emissions savings from these initiatives according to the total number of solar
installations that took place during the initial five years of the NZAP implementation. There has been a
substantial increase in solar arrays installed in the city. From the permit data 445 solar PV systems were
installed in this time period which were estimated to generate over 6,400 MWh of electricity. This is about
0.4% of the annual total kWh consumption in the city (2015). Table 4-6 provides a summary of the savings
that have resulted from systems installed.

Over 6,400 MWh of capacity has been installed since 2015. To assist in the assessment of program
performance, DNV GL also looked at the change in number of installs since 2015. The data shows that the
average capacity of installed systems varies year to year, but that there has been a declining trend in the
number of installs since 2016. New tools and financing instruments are becoming more common and may be
playing a role in this. For example, in 2016 MIT entered into an agreement to buy electricity from a solar
power installation in North Carolina (see MIT Solar Power Purchase Agreement). This agreement enabled the

construction of a 60 MW solar array and helps MIT achieve its climate change mitigation goals but does not
support the solar systems installation goals in Cambridge.

Ancillary Benefits
The solar programs in Cambridge are a major component of the city’s strategy to achieve its renewable
energy production goals. The programs not only provide localized clean energy production, but also have

•

Demonstrating leadership – The city is willing to go out and actively promote localized renewable
energy, which will provide a model for other communities to follow.

•

Improving health and wellbeing – Increasing renewable energy production helps improve air quality,
but it also helps provide residents and business with a clean source of electricity that can be used to
electrify equipment, reduce fossil fuel consumption, and minimize the combustion of gases inside
buildings, which poses safety hazards.

•

Increased resilience – Localized distributed energy resources increase energy security and reduce
the impacts of a climate change event by providing a localized supplemental power source.

Cambridge Community Electricity Aggregation
The Municipal Electricity Aggregation program was developed by the City of Cambridge in 2017 to provide
residents and businesses greater access to renewable energy options. This action is considered supportive of
NZAP Action 3 – Energy Supply and is therefore considered as part of the NZAP Impact Assessment.
The Cambridge Community Electricity Aggregation (CCA) program is a two-tiered electricity purchasing
initiative. There is the Standard Product, which residents and businesses are automatically enrolled in on an
opt-out basis, and there is the Green+ product which is an option for those who want to purchase 100%
renewable electricity. No energy efficiency work or incentives are administered through the CCA, however, in
2018 the program was redesigned to directly support the development of community solar projects within
Cambridge. The current plan is to use the proceeds from an operational adder included in the supply price to
fund renewable energy projects. These are planned to be developed in the coming years.
Participation in the two products and any Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) included as part of the electricity
supply mix associated with the products were considered for the impact assessment; however, stemming
from the 2018 redesign, the city wants to ensure that impacts are based on the concept of additionality. The
term additionality refers to energy sources that generate power from new renewable energy sources that
that would not have occurred without the City’s actions and can provide evidence of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. While measurable impacts were not determined at this time, it is important to document this
initiative as supporting the NZAP and discuss the tracking of data and methods for calculating future
impacts.

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

other co-benefits, such as:

Current Tracking Methodology
The City hired Peregrine Energy Group as the CCA consultant to oversee the implementation of the program.
To track participation levels, Peregrine maintains a detailed account-level database of customers, both
residential and commercial, who participate in the program. The biggest challenge in tracking and analyzing
the data is that there is a lot of customer turnover year to year, especially for residential customers where
there is a large student population. The other challenge is that new customers are not immediately enrolled
in the program. When a customer signs up for an electric account, there is a three- to six-month window

19 | P a g e

Packet Pg. 164

c
City of Cambridge NZAP Impact Evaluation Report

before the account is transitioned from Eversource to the CCA. Because this transfer window may be a factor
limiting participation within the student populations, its recommended that this metric be tracked.

Impact Assessment
DNV GL reviewed the data maintained by Peregrine Energy Group to determine an appropriate method for
calculating program impacts. There are different layers of impacts that may be considered. First, an
determination of the emissions reductions impacts that the program has resulted in. While there were some
emissions reductions associated with the Standard Product program during the first few years through the
purchase of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), these credits are not to be considered emissions reductions
due to a perceived lack of additionality. Instead emissions reduction should only be based on new renewable
energy systems developed as a result of the operational adder, which is set at $0.002/kwh.
Strength of program participation is to be based on:
•

Account-level CCA data from Peregrine Energy Group

•

Billing data provided by Eversource

For example, data from 2018 shows that of the 71,527 commercial and residential accounts in Cambridge,
50,085 were participants in the CCA program (~70%). This information may also be used to create a timeseries analysis to show participation trends year-over-year. It is expected that participation will continue to
increase as additional community engagement strategies are rolled out aimed at educating consumers on
the benefits of the CCA program and it will be important to track its level of success.
Determining the emissions reductions from a renewable energy project developed as a result of the
operational adder will require an inspection of the system and data one year after the system is operational.
The impacts will be based on the amount of renewable energy produced from community solar projects
constructed using funds raised through the CCA electricity pricing. An initial assessment may be done using
design factors such as system capacity (kW or MW) and modeled annual system production (estimated
kWh/yr); however, to ensure the system is performing as intended and resulting in the expected emissions
reductions, the annual inspection will seek to identify any deviations from design. This may include a review
of records of performance checks, maintenance and repairs, and other performance data. Appendix A
provides a listing of measures to track to determine impacts.

Ancillary Benefits
The Community Electricity Aggregation is another prime demonstration of the city’s leadership in
undertaking actions to reduce emissions. This program actively promotes consumer choice in how residents
purchase electricity and helps protect consumers against fraudulent practices in the electric retail industry.
It provides access to more cost-effective renewable energy options and educates consumers on the benefits
of taking a more active role in choosing how their energy is supplied. Exemplary benefits of this action

include:
•

Leadership – The city has taken an active role in providing local residents and businesses ready
access to 100% renewable energy.

•

Public health – The 100% renewable energy product helps to improve air quality and promotes a
healthier lifestyle for residents of Cambridge.

•

Climate change mitigation – 100% renewable electricity supply reduces the amount of GHG
emissions associated with distribution system losses and overall life-cycle emissions associated with
the energy supply chain.

While the emissions reductions impact of the Green+ product and other RECs do not contribute to the city’s
emissions reduction goals, they can be claimed by consumers wishing to purchase renewable energy and be

RESULTS

The impact assessment of the NZAP found quantifiable emissions impacts by the actions that have been
taken since 2015, but they are not necessarily fully reflective of the efforts to date. Much of the groundwork
has been set for future success through policy planning, design, and regulatory action. The estimated
emission impacts from the first five years do indicate, however, that there is still much work to do to meet
the city’s net zero emissions goals.
Of the five NZAP actions that were identified as likely having had measurable results, the emissions savings
could only be calculated for three. For the Custom Retrofit Program, this program has been implemented,
but no measurable projects have been completed. For the Cambridge CCA, RECs were not considered
qualified impacts and the community solar project has not been constructed. In addition, actual performance
data for buildings constructed under the Article-22, Green Building Ordinance in the last five years were not
available for this assessment.
In reviewing these results, the long lead time associated with some of the NZAP actions needs to be
considered as it makes it difficult to determine the real quantifiable impacts of the program over the initial
five-year period. To mitigate the delays in obtaining project data, it is recommended that a more robust
system for reporting and tracking project-level performance data from all actions be put in place for
residents, businesses, and program implementers to access, similar to (or an extension of) the platform
used for BEUDO. A listing of the metrics needed for properly assessing impacts is included in Appendix A. A
more robust system of tracking performance data will require constant oversight and management to ensure
that responsible parties are entering the data in a timely manner and correctly. While this may seem like an
additional burden on city staff, it will save significant work, time, and money over having to collect
performance data only periodically (i.e., every five years) and improve the quality of future impact analyses.
Consistent tracking and monitoring of data will also enable the city to more quickly take action and make
adjustments if certain actions are not performing as expected.
The emissions associated with the building sector overall in 2015 were 1,185,295 MTCO2e. Through this
assessment, the cumulative NZAP emissions savings from 2015-2019 was estimated to be 12,592 MTCO2e
as shown in Table 5-1. This represents 1% of the total buildings sector emissions from 2015 (Figure 5-1).

Further, what this chart does not reflect is that the buildings sector emissions have remained flat in recent
years (see Error! Reference source not found. provides a comparison of the current trajectory versus the

Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This is based on historical population and jobs growth. What is clear is
that if the current trends persist, the gap between actual emissions and the reductions needed to meet the
UNEP targets will continue to increase, making it more and more difficult to achieve the City’s goals for 2030
and beyond.

limit—an almost 20x increase over the initial five-year period. The city needs to remain aggressive in its
approach and find additional ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The next five-year period will be critical.
If the current trend continues and emissions remain flat, meeting the targets set by the Paris Agreement for
2030 will become much more difficult, and significant adjustments in strategy will be needed to achieve
carbon neutrality by 2050.

SUMMARY

Task force members provided feedback through two separate channels:
• Consider It poll: ranking the priority of each action item, as well as adding comments and
pros/cons list for each
• Google Slide deck: using the comments feature
The information within is presented impartially to ensure the feedback from the Task Force members is
accurately represented and accounted for. Comments from both feedback channels are shown for each
proposal to allow the City of Cambridge to confirm the preferred recommendations for each proposal prior
to the final meeting of the Task Force members on May 27 2021.

COMMENTS: GOOGLE SLIDE DECK

Overarching Comments:
• Margery Davies
o The Massachusetts Legislature just passed, and Governor Baker signed into law, S.9
(192nd) "An Act Creating a Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy."
To what extent should the provisions of this important law have an effect on the
Cambridge NZAP? For example, the law states that "The interim 2030 state-wide
greenhouse gas emissions limit shall be at least 50 per cent below the 1990 level, and the
interim 2040 state-wide greenhouse gas emissions limit shall be at least 75 per cent below
the 1990 level." Should we take these limits as applying to Cambridge? And if so, should
the NZAP make specific reference to the limits and how we plan to achieve them? A place
to start might be to state the 1990 emissions level, the up to date as possible current
emissions level, and how the steps in the NZAP will get us to the goal of 50 per cent below
the 1990 level by 2030.
o It does not make sense to me for us not to refer to S.9, since it is such an important law
that sets a number of frameworks within which Cambridge will be operating. At places in
the NZAP where S.9 has bearing on the issue being discussed, the appropriate provision
of S.9 should be referenced.
• Peter Crowley
o As a general comment, CPAC found that many Action Items noted as Medium & Long
Term needed to be moved-up by at least one category. NZAP is in its 6th year and actions
need to occur sooner (within 2 years) rather than later to meet carbon reduction goals.

Slide 6 – 1.1 Custom Retrofit Program for Residential (up to 50 units) and Small Commercial (4
comments)
• Margery Davies
o “Why do we need to verify the value of technical support here? The technical support
for advising on retrofits in large multi-family buildings seems to have already been
demonstrated.”
o “Is an energy audit already required for any renovation building permit? If it is not,
develop a policy order to submit to the City Council to require same. This would at least
alert the parties applying for a building permit of the possibilities for energy
conservation, electrification opportunities, and resilience improvement connected to
their proposed renovation.” – Comment was removed from Google Slides
• Peter Crawley
o “These 2 Medium Term items could be moved to Short Term items.”
o “Move to (long term) Medium Term”
• Jan Devereux
o The first imperative must be to eliminate fossil fuel systems. Efficiency won't save us.
Slide 7 – 1.1.2 Additional BEUDO Requirements (Original Slide) (1 comment)
• Peter Crowley
o Integrate these actions (recommended in 2015) into the Performance Requirements
Slide 8 – 1.2 BEUDO Requirements (Part 1) (4 comments)
• David Adamian
o “Need to ensure that the performance requirement proposal includes an alternative
compliance payment structure that has real teeth and is fair to building owners who
have already invested in efficiency (i.e. requirements should be based on absolute
performance rather than performance relative to a base year).”
• Peter Crowley
o Reduce BEUDO threshold for MF Residential to 25 units (or 25,000 SF) to capture
more commercial buildings. This size threshold is consistent w/other Cities with EE
mandates, such as New York & Wash DC.
o To fast-track development of BEUDO Performance Requirements and stakeholder
review, by establishing subcommittee of current NZAP Working Group and commence
immediately with 60-day deadline to integrate results into NZAP and present to Council.
BEUDO buildings represent 70% of City GHGs, so core to achieving NZAP goals.
o Yes, there needs to be an Energy Efficiency EUI performance requirement/pathway,
using Energy Star PM benchmarking where applicable. For example, requirement that
all buildings below the median EUI must improve performance to sector median within x
years. This assures that Absolute emissions are reduced and retrofits to buildings are
incentivized. (The acceptable EUI thresholds should increase over time.) For buildings
such as labs not included in Energy Star PM, an alternative set of EUI standards for
Cambridge labs should be established using BEUDO data and third-party data, such as
Labs21.
The Energy Efficiency pathway should be coupled with a Net Zero Emissions pathway
that incentivizes the electrification/decarbonization of buildings and investment in on Date issued: 24 May 2021

site and off-site renewable energy, including entering PPAs, Green Tariff programs,
Community Aggregations, etc. The quality of the programs, and the RECs (and
Offsets) accompanying them, need to be high-quality and meet City established criteria
(for additionality, 3rd-party certification, etc.).
The BEUDO Performance Requirements subcommittee can develop the Dual-Pathway,
phased program and include penalties for non-compliance - such as a payment for
MTCO2e GHGs below compliance levels (like NY's Local Law 97 program). The details
of thresholds, timelines, penalties, reporting, alternative compliance, funding, technical
support, etc. would need to be worked-out. Cambridge can model Performance
Requirements after programs in other cities, like NY, Seattle, San Fran , DC.

Slide 9 – 1.2 BEUDO Requirements (Part 2)
• Peter Crowley
o Move to Medium Term
o Per above, lower to 25 units or 25,000 SF

Slide 10- 1.1.3 Upgrades at Time of Renovation or Sale (original)
• Jan Devereux
o add a requirement at time of systems failure/replacement independent for time of sale
or full-scale renovation.
Slide 11 – 1.3: Transaction Points Upgrade Requirements
• Peter Crawley
o Need to better define phasing of requirements and specific upgrades being required for
various building types. For example: conversion of HW & HVAC to electric; insulation,
window replacements, conversion to LED lighting, etc. There needs to be limits on
required spending as % of transaction amount and/or allow phasing.

Slide 12 - 1.x Financing and Capacity Building (Proposed New)
• David Adamian
o “It would be great to investigate ways to use money from the carbon fund to buy down
interest rates, or create some other mechanism for reducing the cost of financing.”

Peter Crawley
o Add: City to convene stakeholder group to map feasibility of multiple large (100+ MGW)
City-wide aggregated renewable energy procurements (vPPA) by private
commercial/institutional/non-profit off-takers.
o These procurements would complement the CCA 3.0 and would meet BEUDO
requirements.
o Add to Medium: Implement/support City-wide aggregated renewable energy
procurements (vPPA) by private commercial/institutional/non-profit off-takers. (These
procurements would meet BEUDO requirements.)
o "No new fossil fuel supplied buildings" is good idea, but legally problematic. This needs
more feasibility research and strategy detail.Also need to study the simultaneous
availability of adequate and affordable renewable energy.
o Need to be realistic about the availability of adequate and affordable renewable energy
to meet the demand of widespread electrification of building stock, especially for equity
reasons. The timing of supply with demand needs to be aligned.

Slide 31 - 3.2 Rooftop Solar Requirement (Updated)
▪ Margery Davies
o There is a good deal of information on the web about integrating green roofs with solar
panels -- biosolar roofs. Googling "green roofs and solar panels" leads to lots of
references. A survey of the research findings indicates there is widespread agreement
that green roofs enable solar panels to operate much more efficiently, by helping to
keep them cool, and by cutting down on dust. See, for example:
o https://icap.sustainability.illinois.edu/files/projectupdate/4207/Solar%20with%20Green%
20Roof%20design.pdf
o and:
o https://livingroofs.org/green-roofs-solar-power/
o On balance, I think that combining solar panels with green roofs is not only a feasible
idea, it is a good idea. The city would get many additional benefits from green roofs
(they absorb rainwater; help cool the air; help reduce air pollution, among others), AND
they would enable solar panels to work more efficiently.

2021 NZAP Update
Science, Policy, Tech, Equity Framework

Science

Policy

This aspect is intended to reflect upon
the latest scientific assessments of
climate change which tell us emissions
need to be reduced 45% below 2010
levels by 2030 and 100% by 2050 to
stay below a 1.5-degree increase.

This aspect is used to inform changes to the
NZAP based on what Federal, State and Local
Policies have changed in the last 5-years that
support our effort to reach the goals (e.g.
building energy codes).

Technology
The technology aspect is a reflection
upon what enabling technologies have
emerged since the 2015 NZAP efforts
that may affect and should be considered

Science

• The gap report referenced for this update indicates that to keep to
within 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, emissions need to be
reduced 50% below 2010 levels by 2030 and 100% by 2050
maintain the ability to reach this target1.

Policy
• A slowdown in federal policy under the Trump administration for energy
efficiency, especially for plug loads, created a gap in behavioral energy use
reductions
• Federal pollution regulations and tax credits will continue to play a role in
clean energy procurement for the City
• National building codes such as the 2021 IECC set the baseline for state
code updates
• Whether policy objectives under the Biden administration are realized
could have a large impact on GHG emissions, though they may have less of
a direct impact on local building sector emissions
At the State Level:
• The current Three-Year Energy Efficiency Plan for gas and electric utilities
expires in 2021 and the updated plan shifted to focus more on GHG
emissions. Although the Plan is implemented at the state level, the City
can advocate for alignment with local objectives and advance programs for
hard-to-reach sectors like multifamily buildings.
• Recent State Legislation:
― An Act Setting Next Generation Climate Policy (S.2477) sets statewide
net-zero emissions limit for the year 2050: It also sets sub-limits for
specific sectors
― An Act Relative to Energy Savings Efficiency (S.2478) that enacts
appliance efficiency standards

change
• Cambridge voted on the proposed changes to the IECC in December 2019
to advance energy efficient design in new construction projects.
• The City will continue to advocate for a net zero stretch code at the state
level to ensure that state activities align with local interests.
• A fossil fuel ban was considered, however, Brookline’s effort to ban on
fossil fuel was struck down by the State Attorney General. Still other
pathways are open for consideration.

Cambridge recognizes the social equity implications of such consequential policy
choices such as those contained with the NZAP and used Applied Economics Clinic’s
equity assessment framework helps guide 2021 Update process. The Net Zero
Actions entail potential equity benefits and pitfalls and, in some cases, are equity
neutral.
•

Potential equity benefits include:
▪ Improved indoor comfort and air quality,
▪ Lower energy bills,
▪ Increased access to financing and funding,
▪ Enhanced energy reliability, and
▪ Increased resident engagement, awareness, and participation

•

Potential equity pitfalls include:
▪ Housing cost and rental cost increases,
▪ Energy cost increases,
▪ Inequitable program participation, and
▪ Inequitable distribution of benefits and burdens.

•

Potential equity pitfalls can be avoided by incorporating specific policy
language that targets equity and builds in flexibility so that policies can be
adjusted if inequitable impacts arise.

METHODOLOGY FOR BUILDING STOCK GHG EMISSIONS INVENTORY
Greenhouse gas emissions inventories are developed to help government leaders and corporate managers understand how
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are associated with various activities in their community or business. For cities, GHG
emissions are generally compiled at both the community scale and at the government operations scale. In 2017, The City
completed a GHG emissions inventory for the Cambridge community as a whole. The community-wide inventory follows the
Resources Institute, C40 Cities, and ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability and is required by The Global Covenant of
Mayors for Climate and Energy (Global Covenant)1, of which Cambridge is a member. The methodology specified by the
GPC is what was used for the Building Stock Inventory completed as part of the 2021 NZAP and is further described below.

1.1

Building Sector Stationary Energy – Electricity

Electricity generation in Massachusetts is made up of a mix of natural gas, nuclear, coal, hydroelectric, and other renewable
generators, and accounts for over 20% of Massachusetts’s total GHG emissions. Much of the electricity used in the
Commonwealth is imported from power plants located in other states and in Canada. At the city level, electricity
consumption is primarily considered a Scope 2 emissions source.
Data Summary
Grid-supplied electricity is provided throughout the city and powers the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, in
addition to city infrastructure and transport systems. The City of Cambridge has a single electricity provider, Eversource, to
transmit and distribute electricity. As such, Eversource was the primary source for gathering electricity consumption data in
the city. Real consumption data was used to determine the electricity consumption (kWh/year) from each building sector.
When coordinating with Eversource to acquire the sector level consumption data for future inventories, Special Ledger
Accounts are also reviewed. These Special Ledge Accounts are maintained separately from the general population account
data and are associated with customers who require that their account information be kept private. These types of accounts
exist for both electricity and natural gas customers. DNV gathered the electricity and gas consumption data from Eversource
for both these customer types for the years 2012-2019.
GPC Quantification Method Used
In accordance with Section 6.5 of the GPC, the location-based method was used for the inventory. Reported emissions from
all grid-supplied electricity consumed within the city’s boundaries were reported as Scope 2 emissions. BASIC/BASIC+
reporting avoids double counting by excluding Scope 1 emissions from electricity generation supplied to the grid.
The grid-based average emission factor is necessary due to the imprecise available supply balance of electricity generated
and consumed within the city boundaries. The emissions factor used for grid supplied electricity is provided in

Building Sector Stationary Energy – Natural Gas

The primary uses for natural gas in the City of Cambridge are for space heating, water heating equipment, and cogeneration stations. The emissions from the co-generation units are attributed to fuel burned for heat, steam and electricity
generation. The emissions from these sources are defined as Scope 1 emissions.
As previously noted, Eversource maintains a list of Ledger Accounts for both electricity and natural gas customers. Special
Ledger Account were included. In addition, data was used from the U.S. EPA’s Large Facilities Database to determine
emissions associated with co-generation facilities within the city of Cambridge. The approaches to estimating the emissions
from natural gas consumption in the buildings sectors and by the co-generation plants are summarized separately below
because of the different approaches used for each.
Data Summary
Building Sector
Grid-supplied natural gas is provided throughout the city and is primarily used by the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors for heat and hot water production. The City of Cambridge also has a single provider for natural gas, Eversource. As
such, Eversource was the primary source of information for natural gas consumption in the city. Metered data was used as
the source of the annual therm consumption for each building sector.
In addition to the Building Sector natural gas usage, the GPC also requires the losses from distribution systems be
accounted for. Based on an assessment of several studies that have been done on the subject of gas leakage from the
distribution system network in and around the Boston, we determined that an average leakage rate of 0.6% was appropriate
for the inventory (see PNAS Article). According to the Harvard study Methane emission and Natural Gas delivery data
reported to both the US Environmental Protection Agency and Massachusetts GHG Reporting Programs show loss rates of
0.4–1.6% among individual distribution companies in Massachusetts in 2012 and 2013, with an average of 0.6%, weighted
by delivered natural gas volumes (Kathryn McKain, 2015).
Co-generation Systems

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

Table 1: ISO New England 2012 Electricity System Emissions Rates Used for Inventory

There are four large electricity and steam generation facilities located in Cambridge that were assessed as part of this
inventory: The Kendall Cogeneration Station, the MIT Central Utilities Plant, the Harvard University Blackstone Plant, and
the Biogen IDEC plant.
Consumption and emissions data for these facilities were gathered from publicly available reports provided on the U.S.
EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program website (https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do#). These facilities are required
to report biogenic CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions excluding biogenic CO2 separately.

Appendix F_GHG Emissions Methodology.docx

Page 4 of 8
The Kendall Cogeneration Station is a 256MW steam and electricity energy plant. The primary gas turbine produces
electricity and high pressure steam. This steam is recycled to power secondary steam turbines to generate additional power.
For emissions inventory, all emissions are allocated to Cambridge. ISO NE emissions factors includes units that are least 25
MW in capacity. To avoid double counting, the Kendall Co-generation Station should only be included in the Scope 1

Harvard University manages the Blackstone Steam Plant. This plant uses four dual-fuel boilers operating primarily on natural
gas. They have a service area covering a substantial portion of Harvard's campuses extending from Harvard Yard, the Law
School and Divinity School in the North campus, along the River Houses, across the river to the Harvard Kennedy School,
and Athletics and One Western Avenue in Allston. The boilers generate up to 5.7MW of electricity through it’s back-pressure
turbine system. While steam is used on properties in Boston, the CHP plant is located within Cambridge’s boundaries, and
therefore has been included in whole to this inventory. A CHP unit was added to the Blackstone plant in 2013 with an 8 MW
turbine generator and is included in the inventory data for years 2015-2019.
MIT’s Central Utilities Plant is a 21-megawatt natural gas turbine used to produce both electric and thermal energy for the
campus. The heat recovery steam generator captures waste heat from turbine exhaust, and the captured steam is used for
heating and cooling (via chillers driven by steam turbines). Emissions from this plant that were reported to the U.S. EPA
were included for the years 2012-2019.
The BioGen IDEC facility is a 5.3MW natural gas turbine with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). This system
operates in parallel with the electric utility. Emissions from this plant that were reported to the U.S. EPA were also included
for the years 2012-2019.
GPC Quantification Method Used
Buildings Sector
In accordance with Section 6.3 of the GPC, real consumption data for each fuel type, disaggregated by sector was used for
the inventory. Reported emissions from the usage of natural gas within the city’s boundaries were reported as Scope 1
emissions. Because Eversource-specific emission factors for natural gas emissions were not available, a universal emission
factor provided by the Climate Registry3 was used to calculate natural gas emissions. The emissions factor used for natural
gas consumption is provided in Table 2.
In addition, methane (CH4) emissions associated with distribution systems leakage also needs to be taken into account in
the inventory. The total CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions factor for fugitive emissions from natural gas leakage was
determined based on:
•

Volume of natural gas per heat energy (m3 gas / therm gas)

•

A density value of natural gas of 0.7 kg/m3 based on values provided in the GHG Protocol stationary combustion
tool.

•

The IPCC Tier 1 default for the mass fraction of methane in delivered natural gas (93.4%).

•

A carbon dioxide content of 1.0% in the delivered natural gas.

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

territorial emissions.

The overall emissions factor was then calculated to be 0.04628 MT CO2e/leaked therm.

Co-generation Systems
In accordance with Section 6.3 of the GPC, the community-wide inventory for the City of Cambridge used the Realconsumption data, disaggregated by sub-sector approach. The emissions associated with these facilities are taken directly
from the EPA reports which are submitted by large facilities and use standard emissions calculation methodologies.
Facilities generally have some flexibility in choosing which calculation method to use and their methods may change from
year to year as long as the still meet the requirements of the U.S. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Building Sector Stationary Energy – Fuel Oil

1.3

The baseline for energy-use in Cambridge for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors in Massachusetts
communities includes fuel oil consumption as well. While electricity and natural gas heating are limited to specific municipal
suppliers, fuel oil is supplied by many different private companies. Because customer data cannot be collected from each
supplier, consumption must be estimated using community-specific assumptions. Any limited fuel oil usage by the Kendall
Station, Blackstone plant, and MIT CUP is accounted for in the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Systems reports.
Data Summary
For the Cambridge community-wide inventory, residential oil usage data was based on the number of housing units in
Cambridge by type, and a percentage of units determined to be heated with fuel oil from the “American Community Survey
(ACS) 2010-2014 5-Year Community Estimate.” The property types identified were:
•

Single-Family, Detached

•

Single-Family, Attached

•

Multi-Family, 2-4 Units (Sum of 2-Family and 3-4 Units categories)

•

Multi-Family, 5+ Units (Sum of 5-19 Units, 20-49 Units, and 50+ Units categories)

•

Other

Residential fuel oil combustion emissions were totaled using state average use and expenditure by fuel type and applied to
Cambridge housing data. Massachusetts has a lower concentration of single family homes and a higher concentration of

two- to four-unit apartments. To account for this when comparing an average Massachusetts home with an average New
England home (averaged across all housing units), a weighted New England Average Consumption based on the
percentage breakdown of housing unit types in Massachusetts was used.
For the Commercial sector, fuel oil use estimates were based on the total number of employees, establishments by Primary
Building Activity (PBA), and the average expected energy use per employee for each PBA. The Executive Office of Labor
and Workforce Development (EOWLD) ES-292 Employment and Wages Survey lists the number of employees and

Certain data required alternate collection methods due to a lack of direct employee data. PBA’s with incomplete data used
one of two options for estimating the missing data for the purposes of this baseline:
•

Option 1: Compare average fuel oil use to average natural gas use in the same building types, using Office
buildings as a baseline. For example, if a PBA that uses natural gas uses 50% more natural gas than an Office
building, assume that if the same PBA used fuel oil, it would use 50% more fuel oil than an Office building. This is
the preferred method, as it yields a more conservative estimate.

•

Option 2: Find average fuel oil consumption for an average New England building (across all PBAs) and divide

For the industrial sector, data was collected similarly to Commercial data. The total number of employees and

As previously mentioned, fuel oil consumption from the Kendall Cogeneration Station, Blackstone plant, and MIT CUP are
reported directly from the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program submittals and therefore were not estimated here.
GPC Quantification Method Used
In accordance with Section 6.3 of the GPC, the emissions from these Stationary Energy sources are calculated by
multiplying activity data by the corresponding emission factors for each fuel. Estimated energy consumption by fuel type,
applicable consumption rates, and the total quantity of energy consumption overall are used to obtain a percentage that can
be used to approximate how much of each fuel type is used by each sector in the community.
As detailed above, a collection of representative consumption surveys, modelled energy consumption, and regional fuel
consumption data was used to properly characterize the City of Cambridge emissions. Being that there is likely a higher
number of employees per square foot in Cambridge than industry averages, oil consumption emissions are likely
overestimated in this inventory.

METHODOLOGY FOR 2021 NZAP MODELLING
The NZAP tool was developed to evaluate the impacts of NZAP actions taken to date, track progress towards the goals of
each action, and forecast emissions reductions from these activities over time. The tool was developed based on available
data and input from city staff and stakeholders. The NZAP tool is an Excel-based modelling tool that DNV created for the
City that can serve as a centralized hub of NZAP Action-related information. This tool was based off similar tools DNV has
prioritize, and track progress on a wide range of actions designed to dramatically reduce emissions in the built environment.
The tool was designed in a way that incorporates key pieces of data from existing analyses and data sources – including but
not limited to the 2018 Climate Action Plan model, 2017 Low Carbon Energy Supply Strategy (LCESS) model, the
Community-wide GHG Inventory (2017) and building stock inventory, growth, and renovation analysis. Using these sources
ensures that consistency is maintained across study efforts when managing the 2021 NZAP actions.
Given the City’s desire for ongoing tracking of NZAP progress, the replicability of procedures was critical in creating a userfriendly tool that city staff can use to make adjustments and track progress. Producing a highly organized and well
documented Excel-based tool also allows the City to maintain a consistent program evaluation protocols that will enable well
organized and detailed tracking across years. Working with city staff, DNV conducted a full review of indicators or metrics
used to track progress in the NZAP Annual Report, BEUDO, and GHG Inventory and worked with city staff to determine the
best way to incorporate indicators the 2021 NZAP Assessment Tool. Through this process a series of additional indicators
were identified and documented (see Appendix C) to ensure consistent and relevant tracking of progress over time. This
document provides additional information on methodologies and data sources incorporated into the tool.
Note that, like any model, the NZAP tool is merely a representation of the future and therefore should not be relied on as a
precise prediction. The Net Zero Action Plan is meant to be a high-level framework for action to reduce GHG emissions from
buildings and lacks the specificity needed to model precise results, such as exact kWh and therms reduced by an action in a
certain building sector. Therefore, rather than expecting the NZAP model to determine whether Cambridge will hit specific
GHG reduction targets, it should be used to observe the general magnitude of impact of each action relative to the other
actions and the interaction between them.

1.1

Notes on General Use of the Tool

The 2021 NZAP Assessment Tool is organized into a series of tabs. Across the bottom of the workbook the user will note
the different colored tabs.
•

The yellow tab (CO2 Impacts Map) is a guide for the user on which actions have quantifiable emissions reductions
and which actions are considered “Enabling Actions”

•

The dark green tabs are those tabs that the user inputs tracking data and sees the outputs

•

The light blue tabs are where the calculations are performed for each action

•

The dark blue tabs are where reference data is accessed for the calculations

•

The gray QC Tables tab is included so the user may conduct further quality control checks on the outputs and

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

developed including a Climate Scenario Analysis Tool that has been used with a number of leading cities to evaluate,

compare results across scenarios.
The tool is set up to input tracking data and output a set of consistent metrics across each action with quantifiable impacts.
The inputs are unique to each action but are metrics that can be used to calculate energy and emissions impacts. To track
progress, the user needs to input data for each action on an annual basis. Once a new set of inputs is entered the user will

Appendix G_2021 NZAP Model Methodology 1-1222.docx

c

Page 2 of 11
receive back a set of impact metrics to understand the emissions impacts overall and by decarbonization strategy. These

•

CO2e Reductions from Energy Efficiency improvements

•

CO2e Reductions from On-site Renewable Electricity

•

CO2e Reductions from Off-site Renewable Electricity purchases

•

Total cumulative avoided emissions from that action up to the latest input year

This setup allows the user to see the source of emissions reductions for each action. Some actions may have multiple
sources. For example, BEUDO Performance Requirements will show emissions reductions from both energy efficiency and
Off-site Renewable Energy. As it is, no amount of emissions reductions will appear in the On-site Renewable Electricity
column from any action due to the current practice being that RECs are primarily held or retired by those outside of
Cambridge.
In addition to the inputs for each action, the tool also may be updated with the most recent building sector inventory data. As
the building sector inventory is updated that inventory data may be entered in the Stationary Energy Emissions table at the
top of the sheet. This will affect the forecasted emissions projections through 2050 shown in the charts on the NZAP Dash
tab.
While the Inputs and Outputs tab is designed to help understand the impacts of actions to-date, the NZAP Dashboards are
designed to be more forward looking. NZAP Dash by Action and NAZP Dash by Source provide a series of charts that show
the projected emissions and overall avoided emissions through 2050. The user may toggle between individual actions on the
NZAP Dash by Action tab or view emissions avoided by strategy (energy efficiency, on-site renewable electricity and off-site
renewable electricity) by selecting “On” from the dropdown menu in the NZAP Dash by Source tab. Note that when viewing
emissions avoided by action, the bar chart below the wedge chart will populate as will the waterfall charts. When viewing
emissions avoided by source, a donut chart on the left is included to show the percent of savings by source.
The charts use the data from the table in tab ‘Dash Engine’. The Dash Engine pulls from the calculation tabs for each action.
There is no need for the user to edit any of the cells in the Dash Engine tab.
Scenarios
The NZAP Dash by Action tab includes a series of tables which allow the user to toggle through various scenarios. Using
Table 1, the user may choose between different electric grid scenarios. These scenarios reflect different rates at which the
Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and Clean Energy Standard (CES) may reach 100% emissions-free
electricity. These are as follows:
•

Grid 1 – Electric grid emissions absent any state-level intervention (no RPS or CES). This is the business-as usual

Grid 2 – Current RPS/CES; the electric grid reaches 80% emissions-free by 2050.

•

Grid 3 – Assumes under the RPS/CES, the electric grid reaches 50% emissions-free by 2030, and 100% emissions
free by 2050

•

Grid 4 – Assumes under the RPS/CES, the electric grid reaches 75% emissions-free by 2030, and 100% emissions

Notes on calculation methodologies

This section provides clarification on how inputs are used and assumptions that are built into the model due to data
limitations for each of the actions.
Action 1.1 EE Retrofits
Inputs
For the calculations, this action requires data from completed retrofit projects to populate the model. Inputs include number
of projects completed, estimated kWh and Therms savings from those projects. If no tracking data is input, default values will
be used for the projections.
Data limitations and Assumptions
As of 2020, no kWh or Therm savings were reported from this action; therefore, there are no measured input for this action.
All of the projected savings are based on a series of assumptions which the consulting team found reasonable to include as
part of the model.
Where there is no real data, an assumed kWh Saved, and Therm Saved per Project is used. These assumptions are based
on a review of recent studies including the Cambridge Interventions Points study (2020).
An assumed number of projects completed per year is also used. We currently assume 50 projects per year can be
completed based on recent engagement trends with residents and businesses through the Cambridge Energy Alliance
(CEA) programs. These values can be found in the Reference Data tabs and can be adjusted if better information becomes
available.
Calculations
To calculate emissions reductions over time, electric and gas emissions factors for use are used as well as an emissions
factor for gas distribution losses1 (MT/project/year). This is based on Electricity Emissions Factors and Natural Gas
Emissions Factors found in the reference data tabs and the average kWh and Therms saved per project. The source of the

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

community choice aggregation program – how many customers participate in the program and of those participating, how

electric and gas factors was the Climate Action Plan Buildings Model created several years back for the city.
Since all emissions from this action are related to energy efficiency, the emissions reductions are determined by applying
the Fuels Emissions Factor Per Project Factor to the Number of Projects Completed.

1 Fugitive emissions from gas distribution systems have a different emissions factor than gas combusted on-site; therefore, the calculation for total gas emissions must

consider these two aspects separately. Emissions resulting from electricity use and through electric distribution losses use the same emissions factors and may be
combined to determine total emissions from electric use.

Note that because savings from the retrofit action will transition to Action 1.3, Upgrades at Transaction Points, in the future,
a ‘Transition Factor’ has been built into the model (Column P). Currently the model estimates that all savings will be
attributed to Action 1.1 through 2024, 50% will be attributed in 2025 and 2026, and after 2026, all savings will be transitioned
to Action 1.3.

Inputs
The tracking inputs associated with the BEUDO Requirements currently do not factor into the emissions projections other
than to establish a baseline for the performance requirements. This is because the performance requirements are still in the
process of being formally adopted. Once they take effect, emissions reductions will be attributed to this action. In the model,
it is assumed these requirements will first yield results in 2025.
As it is, emissions reductions are based on a kWh and Therms from the baseline year 2019.
Data limitations and Assumptions
Emissions reductions from BEUDO are associated with the performance goals being met that are currently laid out for the
policy. Those are:
•

By 2025 emissions will be reduced by 20%

•

By 2030 emissions will be reduced by 40%

•

By 2035 emissions will be reduced by 60%

•

By 2040 emissions will be reduced by 80%

•

By 2045 emissions will be reduced by 90%

•

By 2050 emissions will be reduced by 100%

The emissions reductions are estimated using energy data from the year 2019. For instance, by 2030 there will be a 40%
reduction in emissions from the 2019 reported energy use.
For this Action emissions reductions are split between energy efficiency, on-site and off-site renewable energy procurement.
The model uses an assumption that of the emissions saved in year [X], a certain percent of that will be associated with
energy efficiency improvements and the remainder will be associated with renewables. The energy efficiency savings
potential is shown in the model as the Energy Efficiency Potential (Column AB). The model currently assumes a 1% energy
efficiency potential each year for the BEUDO Performance Requirements which may be a conservative estimate considering
MassSave Energy Efficiency Programs generally use a 2-5% potential for program planning2. A Realization Factor is also
taken into consideration in the calculations – that is, of the potential savings from energy efficiency available, how much will
be realized in that year. This factor declines over the years.

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

Action 1.2 BEUDO Requirements

Calculations
The emissions reductions calculations are performed 2 ways – both arrive at the same results. The first way emissions
reductions are calculated is strictly based on the Policy Targets (Column AO). This is the difference between baseline
emissions and forecast emissions with targets in place (Column Z). The second way uses EE Potential to determine how

Page 5 of 11
much emissions reductions will come from energy efficiency, on-site renewables, and off-site renewables. The total
emissions reductions calculated from potential (shown in Column AU) is:
EE potential + On-site Solar Growth + what is needed to purchase as off-site RE to reach targets
Each method uses the baseline kWh consumption for electricity use and Therms consumption for gas use in BEUDO
and U). This is because growth is assumed to be addressed by Action 2.1 Net Zero New Construction.
Emissions from electricity use and gas use are determined by applying an emissions factor to each fuel. These emissions
factors are pulled from the reference data tabs. The emissions reductions are calculated as a percentage of the emissions
reduced from the baseline energy use at year [X] according to the BEUDO Targets. The targets list above may be adjusted
by the user using Table 3c in the Dash by Action tab to determine the effects of accelerating the pace of BEUDO emissions
reductions in relation to the overall ZNE goals such as the UNEP 2030 goal.
As mentioned above, the savings are split between energy efficiency and renewable access. A conservative 1% of savings
is estimated to come from energy efficiency, the remainder will come from renewables, including fuel-switching from fossil
fuel to electric energy systems.
Action 1.3 Upgrades at Transaction Points
Inputs
For the calculations, this action uses data from completed retrofit projects to populate the model. Inputs include number of
projects completed, estimated kWh and Therms savings from those projects.
Data limitations and Assumptions
This action has not yet been formally adopted so no tracking data is currently available. All of the projected savings are
based on a series of assumptions which the consulting team found reasonable to include as part of the model which can be
found in the Ref Data and Assumptions tab.
Since there was no tracking data available, an assumed Therm Saved per Project was used as well as an assumed number
of projects completed per year is also used. We currently assume 742 projects per year completed based information
provided as part of the Cambridge Intervention Points Report (2021). These values can be found in the Reference Data tabs
and can be adjusted if better information becomes available. kWh savings are not considered in this action because the
emissions reductions associated with electricity use in these sectors (residential and small commercial) are covered by
Action 3.2 and 3.3.
Calculations
To calculate emissions reductions over time, a gas emissions factor is used (MT/project/year). This emissions factor is
calculated based on natural gas use and the fugitive emissions associated with that use. The emissions factors may be

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

buildings as a basis for quantifying reductions. The user will notice the energy use is the same for each year (Columns T

found in the reference data tabs. The source of the gas factors was the Climate Action Plan Buildings Model created several
years back for the city and the City’s GHG Inventory (2017).
Since all emissions from this action are related to energy efficiency, the emissions reductions are determined by applying
the Fuels Emissions Per Project Factor to the Number of Projects Completed.

Page 6 of 11
Note that because savings from the retrofit action will transition to this action, a ‘Transition Factor’ has been built into the
model (Column Q). Currently the model estimates that all savings will be attributed to Action 1.1 through 2024, 50% will be
attributed to this action in 2025 and 2026, and after 2026, all savings will be transitioned to Action 1.3.
Action 2.1 Net Zero New Construction

For the calculations, this action requires data on the number of projects permitted, square footage of project and number of
units associated with multi-family housing projects. If these inputs are not provided the model defaults to assumed values.
Data limitations and Assumptions
New buildings in Cambridge are not yet subject to NZE requirements, therefore no tracking data is currently incorporated in
the model. All of the projected savings are based on a series of assumptions which the consulting team found reasonable to
include as part of the model.
The key assumptions used in the calculations for these actions are:
•

Projected growth – a growth factor as determined by the regional planning agency for the region. This growth factor
is associated with Job’s growth for the city.

•

An average kWh and Therm per square foot of new building based on data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration

•

Current square footage of buildings in Cambridge

Calculations
To calculate emissions reductions, first the growth factor is applied the to the total square footage of buildings in Cambridge.
From that the square feet added per year is determined.
Using the kWh and Therm intensity factors, the kWh and Therm consumption associated with the new building area is
determined.
To determine the emissions from this new building area over time, a ZNE transition factor is applied. This is a percentage of
new building stock that will be ZNE at a given point in the future. It’s expected that all new buildings will be net zero by 2030.
As the user will note, at year 2030 100% of the new construction will be net zero meaning there will be no new emissions
added from new construction activities after that time.
Similar to the Action 1.1 and Action 1.3, there will be a transition from the savings achieved from the Green Building
Requirements to this action. That is because once the net zero requirements are fully adopted, all new building whether they
are green buildings or not, will be required to be net zero. This action, therefore, also has a transition factor built into the
calculations.

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

Inputs

The emissions avoided from this action are the total emissions expected from electricity and gas use from newly constructed
buildings minus that portion which is expected to be net zero. For example, where 0% of buildings are expected to be net
zero there are no emissions avoided. If 50% of buildings are expected to be net zero in a given year, then 50% of the
emissions from those buildings will be avoided. A portion of the remainder of the emissions will be saved through Action 1.3,
Green Building Requirements, until that time when all buildings are required to be net zero.

For this action the savings are again expected to be split between energy efficiency and renewable access. For new
construction, it is assumed that a higher level of savings will come from energy efficiency improvement beyond what is
considered baseline. For modelling purposes this is estimated to be 50% of the savings. This percentage is applied to the
total emissions avoided to determine emissions avoided from energy efficiency and emissions avoided from renewable

Action 2.3 Green Building Requirements
Inputs
For the calculations, this action requires data on the number of projects permitted, square footage of project and number of
units associated with multi-family housing projects. If these inputs are not provided the model defaults to assumed values.
Data limitations and Assumptions
Limited tracking data was available for this action, but the emissions savings from green building projects between 2015 and
2019 are taken into consideration in the model. Savings are based on a series of assumptions which the consulting team
found reasonable to include as part of the model.
The key assumptions used in the calculations for this action are:
•

Energy savings from green buildings – assumed to be 10% based on LEED projects achieving at least 2 points for
EA Energy Performance Credit / v4.1 equivalent to MA Base Stretch Code (ASHRAE 2016-90.1)

•

Projected growth – a growth factor as determined by the regional planning agency for the region. This growth factor
is associated with expected Job’s growth for the city.

•

An average kWh and Therm intensity per square foot of new building based on data from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration

•

Current square footage of buildings in Cambridge

Calculations
To calculate emissions reductions over time, first the growth factor is applied the to the total square footage of buildings in
Cambridge. From that the square feet added per year is determined.
Using the kWh and Therm intensity factors, the kWh and Therm consumption associated with the new building area is
determined.
The emissions avoided are determined by then applying savings from green buildings to the total emissions expected from
electricity and gas use. The results are that portion of the electric and gas usage considered to be saved from the green
building requirements. The transition factor described in Action 2.1 is then taken into consideration and applied to estimate
the emissions avoided from this action in the absence of the net zero requirements. All emissions reduction for this action

energy.

are considered to be associated with energy efficiency because of the issue with RECs from on-site renewable energy
systems likely being attributed elsewhere and off-site renewable not being needed as part of the green building certification
process.
Action 2.4 Municipal Building Requirements
Inputs

Appendix G_2021 NZAP Model Methodology 1-1222.docx

Packet Pg. 221

c

Page 8 of 11
For the calculations, this action uses data from completed projects to populate the model. Inputs include number of projects
completed, estimated kWh and Therms savings from those projects.
Data limitations and Assumptions
Tracking data was available for this action and the emissions savings from those projects are taken into consideration in the
data. These include:
•

An average kWh and Therm savings per project

•

An assumed number of projects completed per year

The user will note that some years appear to be outliers, however, these years with large savings recorded are associated
with the completion of a large projects (such as a new school). Although these years may skew the averages, they are left in
assuming the city will continue to periodically complete large projects as part of the Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan.
Calculations
To calculate emissions reductions over time, a combined (electric and gas) emissions factor is used; that is, an estimated
combined metric ton of CO2e per project per year (MT/project/year). This is based on Electricity Emissions Factors and
Natural Gas Emissions Factors found in the reference data tabs and the average kWh and Therms saved per project. The
source of the electric and gas factors was the Climate Action Plan Buildings Model and the City’s GHG Inventory (2017).
Since all emissions from this action are related to energy efficiency, the emissions reductions are determined by applying
the Combined Fuels Emissions Per Project Factor to the Number of Projects Completed.
Action 3.1 Low Carbon Energy Supply
Inputs
The calculations for this action are not based on any tracking data currently. They are projections based on a number of
assumptions about this Action. As it is, the emissions savings are expected to come from the transition to ZNE in the small
commercial sector (non-BEUDO) and from the residential sector where fossil fuel-based heating equipment will be converted
to electric equipment. The savings in the residential sector are realized through the efficiency gains as a result of equipment
replacements and the use of less emissions intensive electricity for heating.
Data limitations and Assumptions
The Clean Heat Program is seen as the primary program for delivering emissions reductions from this action. Although the
Clean Heat Program is being implemented no tracking data was available at the time of the model development. All of the
projected savings are based on a series of assumptions which the consulting team found reasonable to include as part of
the model.

model. Projected savings are based on a set of assumptions that are informed by the realized savings from the tracking

The key assumptions used in the calculations for this action are:
•

Electric and gas use of non-BEUDO, small commercial buildings

•

The rate net zero emissions are achieved in the non-BEUDO, small commercial buildings sector

•

Average kWh Use per Unit (Residential) – Based on Eversource billing data

•

Average Therms Use per Unit (Residential) – Calibrated based on information provided in the Cambridge Resilient
Renewable Thermal Analysis (2020).

•

Number of projects completed per year – assumed to be 531 projects per year completed based on Cambridge
Resilient Renewable Thermal Analysis.

efficiency used for a new heat pump is a COP of 2.4 which is also per the Cambridge Resilient Renewable Thermal
Analysis.
Calculations
The calculations for the non-BEUDO, small commercial sector proceed as follows:
•

First the estimated emissions from gas use are calculated based on the square footage of non-BUEDO buildings
existing in Cambridge in 2019 (this is based on comparison of BEUDO data to all building in Cambridge – see
separate analysis)

•

It is then assumed that all emissions will be removed by 2050 at a consistent year-over-year pace (note that the
pace may be accelerated using Table 3a on the Dash by Action tab)

•

The annual emissions reductions are then summed with the reduction from the residential sector to get total
emissions reductions

The calculations for Residential Sector for this action proceed as follows:
•

Based on the Average Therms per Unit and the number of projects each year a Therms [to be] Replaced value is
determined

•

Therms are then converted to kWh for the equivalent electric use (this conversation takes into account the gains in
efficiency)

•

The would be Therms emissions are calculated along with the emissions associated with the equivalent electric use

•

The difference between the two is the emissions reductions realized through fuel switching

Action 3.2 On-site Renewable Electricity – Community Solar Access
[Note: this action is not considered to have any impact on emissions in Cambridge due to the RECs from on-site
renewable energy project likely being attributed to other outside of the City. The calculation sheet is available
however, if this situation should change.]
Inputs
For the calculations, this action uses data from completed projects to populate the model. Inputs include the number of

Attachment: NZAP 5-Year Update_1-24-22 (CMA 2022 #9 : Net Zero Action Plan Update)

Taken into consideration in the calculations is also the improvement in efficiency when switching to a heat pump. The

projects completed, and the total capacity (kW) of those projects.
Data limitations and Assumptions
Tracking data was available for this action and the emissions savings from those projects are taken into consideration in the
calculations. Projected renewable electricity production is based on a set of assumptions including:
•

An average kWh produced per project (kWh/kW/year) – this is based on information from the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory’s PV Watts tool)

Appendix G_2021 NZAP Model Methodology 1-1222.docx

Packet Pg. 223

c

Page 10 of 11
•

An assumed growth factor for new solar installs in the city

Calculations
The calculation to determine the projected electricity production from these systems in the city proceed as follows:

•

The model uses the total capacity (kW) installed for that year

•

The total electricity produced from those systems is determined by applying the average electricity production
(kWh/kW/year) to the total capacity to arrive at a kWh/year produced.

If projections are used the model uses the assumed growth factor to determine what the install capacity would be in year [X]
based on the most recent year of tracking data (currently 2019, 501 kW installed). The total electricity produced from those
systems is again then determined by applying the average electricity production (kWh/kW/year) to the total capacity to arrive
at a kWh/year produced for that year.
Action 3.3 Off-site Renewable Electricity Access
Inputs
The Off-site Renewable Electricity Action is intended to both be enabling and have direct emissions impacts. It will be
enabling provided the criteria that large commercial buildings can use the aggregation to meet BEUDO requirements. It will
have direct impacts by providing a structure under which residential and small businesses can buy renewable electricity from
the market. For the impact calculations, this action uses data from the Community Choice Aggregation program to model the
renewable electricity estimated to be purchased by residents and small businesses as a result of this action. Inputs include
the number of residential and commercial customers participating in the Green Plus product (100% renewable electricity)
offered as part of the community choice aggregation program.
Data limitations and Assumptions
Tracking data was available for this action and the emissions savings from those projects are taken into consideration in the
calculations. Projected savings are based on a set of growth targets for residents and businesses participating in the 100%
renewable electricity purchasing program. These targets are as follows:

The user may opt to adjust the growth targets using Table 3b on the Dash by Action tab. Growth in the model is based on
the number of households and business participating in the CCA program as of 2020 and the total number of residential and
small commercial accounts in Cambridge from Eversource billing data. The growth is the difference between the two
sources – i.e., the number of households and businesses that need to still be engaged to enroll 100% of the customers who

Page 11 of 11
appear in the Eversource data. Emissions from growth beyond that (i.e., new construction) is covered by Action 2.1, Net
Zero Requirement for New Construction.
Calculations

•

The model first applies the residential and commercial program growth targets to the projected number of
households and businesses in Cambridge. This provides an estimated number of participants each year.

•

From the tracking data the average electricity consumption for residences and businesses is applied to the
estimated numbers of participants each year to obtain a kWh consumption each year for both customer types.

•

From there, the annual grid CO2e emissions factor is applied to the estimated participating kWh to determine the
amount of emissions avoided by customers participating in the 100% renewable electricity purchasing program.

The annual CO2e reductions from this action is then determined as the sum of emissions avoided from the residential
participant and the commercial participants.

Net Zero Task Force Meeting Materials

A key element ensuring the continued forward-thinking of the Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP) is the plan's mandate that a
detailed review of the whole suite of actions be conducted every five years by a nominated Task Force. The 2021 NZAP
update is the first such review conducted since the plan's adoption in 2015. In September 2020, a 25-person Task Force
Matter Experts. Regular updates on the Task Force meetings were posted on the City's website at:
www.cambridgema.gov/netzero.
The Task Force was convened via Zoom webinar for a total of five full-group Task Force meetings and six working-group
Task Force meetings between November 12, 2020 and May 27, 2021.
The five full-group Task Force meetings were each two hours and included a 10-minute public comment period 19. Meetings
were planned and facilitated by City staff and the consultant team, which included DNV (technical/policy subject matter
expert), Sorensen Partners (facilitation consultant), and AEC (equity consultant). Three initial full-group Task Force meetings
were held from November 2020 to January 2021 to establish a common basis of understanding among the Task Force
regarding:
•

NZAP principles that guided the original NZAP and that should be used in this five-year review of the NZAP: current
science, policy, technology, and equity conditions; and co-benefits impacts.

•

Social and demographic existing conditions within the City that impact Equity, and that could have implications for
the relative Equity that results from each of the existing and proposed NZAP Actions.

•

GHG emissions trends in the current and potential future building stock of the City. Cambridge added 8.1 million
square feet of floor area between 2015 and 2020, and yet emissions have remained flat.

•

Technology trends – and economic feasibility of new technologies – with the potential to reduce GHG emissions in
the built environment.

•

Opportunities and challenges related to different energy sources, including electricity, rooftop solar, natural gas,
and off-site renewables.

•

Policy and regulatory changes at the local, state, and federal level that overlap with existing and proposed NZAP
Actions.

•

Key partnerships with other active organizations in the Cambridge educational and business community that are
advancing agendas related to net-zero targets for existing and new infrastructure in the built environment.

In the first Task Force meeting, the consultant team presented the historical
context for the development of the NZAP – its focus on buildings and
renewable energy supply to buildings, a local carbon fund, communications,
and capacity building – and the five-year update process. The Task Force
reviewed the five Action categories in the NZAP; looked at GHG emissions
community-wide; and discussed the NZAP's overarching focus –
Cambridge’s target of Carbon Neutrality by 2050, aligning with the United
Nations and current science – as well as the trendline that shows we are not
on track to achieving sufficient GHG reductions to meet the target. The
proposed framework for evaluating NZAP goals and actions was also
discussed in the contexts of science, policy, technology, and equity. Within
the equity context, possible metrics for understanding equity impacts of
NZAP actions were also covered. Discussion was held about components of
equity, including public health benefits, data sources, and how to improve the
differential benefits of NZAP actions for vulnerable populations.
In the second Task Force meeting, the consultant team presented on building
sector GHG emission trends, including 2012-2019 results, and noting that
commercial buildings are the largest source of emissions in the City, and that

During the three-initial full-group Task
Force meetings – in order to create a
forum for detailed and divergent
discussion – breakout discussions
were held during which Task Force
members spent 15-20 minutes in
discussion with a smaller group of
participants. Question and answer
sessions were moderated at multiple
points during each meeting. Questions
were frequently raised by Task Force
members during the presentation of
content, and Task Force members
provided citations and links to
technical and policy content within the
Chat function of the Zoom webinar
platform. The breakout discussions
and the question-and-answer sessions
were fruitful in giving Task Force
members a forum to highlight issues of
concern and potential refinements and
modifications to the NZAP actions.

emissions are roughly split between natural gas consumption and electricity
use. DNV then presented a five-year assessment of NZAP Actions and Impacts to-date.
In the third Task Force meeting, the BEUDO Requirements (Action 1.2) were discussed extensively, based on the high
ranking of BEUDO buildings in the year-over-year inventory of GHG emissions. BEUDO buildings – buildings that are larger
than 25,000 square feet if they are commercial buildings and 50 or more units if they are residential buildings – account for
approximately 70% of emissions in Cambridge, and number approximately 1,100 buildings in the City. The co-benefits of
NZAP actions were also debated, and were augmented based on Task Force feedback to include consideration of additional
aspirational co-benefits in Government and Policy Development, Economics, Environment, Health and Wellbeing, Climate
Resilience, and Access and Engagement that should be considered as the Task Force recommends adjustments to the
NZAP actions. The consultant team also presented an overview of building technologies – including Thermal Tech, DER
(Distributed Energy Resources), Energy Efficiency, Materials, Thermal Energy Supply, and Grid-Scale Renewables – as
further context for how and what adjustments to the NZAP should be considered.
Following the three initial full-group Task Force meetings, it was determined that additional fine-grained discussion in smaller
working groups would be useful in order to present and debate information and issues resulting in specific proposals to
modify the NZAP actions.
Six working-group Task Force meetings were then convened from February to March 2021 following the third full-group Task
Force meeting to hold extended discussion about proposed changes to Actions. Two meetings were held for each of three

working groups organized by Task Force members providing input on the action areas of Energy Efficiency in Existing
Buildings, Net-Zero New Construction, and Energy Supply. Each of these working-group Task Force meetings was
facilitated by a City and consultant-led team of technical/policy subject matter experts from DNV.
Following the working-group Task Force meetings, the fourth and fifth full-group Task Force meetings were held in April and
May 2021 to share the results of the working-group meetings and form a basis of agreement around proposed modifications
to the NZAP. In the fourth meeting, each action in the NZAP with proposed modifications was presented by spokespersons
from the working groups. All actions with proposed modifications were discussed sequentially. The proposed text changes to

the actions were presented in the meeting slides, and Task Force members asked questions and raised issues. Equity
issues were also embedded in the design of all the action adjustments. Among the many topics discussed at this meeting,
the Task Force focused specifically on how low and moderate income (LMI) multi-family housing tenants and landlords are
considered in the NZAP action adjustments as was financing mechanisms.
Between the fourth and fifth meetings, Task Force members "voted" on the refined NZAP Actions presented in the fourth
to strong agreement. Additional comments were provided by Task Force members as they cast their votes, and comments
from the Google Docs were added to the Consider.it poll so that all comments were available for review in one place. The
feedback collected during this process is provided as Appendix D.
In the fifth (final) Task Force meeting, the Consider.it poll results were presented, and implementation priorities were
discussed by the whole Task Force. The consultant team shared insights about the relative GHG Impacts, Resilience, Other
Co-benefits, and Equity "ratings" of each of the proposed NZAP action adjustments. Through this conversation it was
determined that focusing on the BEUDO Requirements as well as the Local Carbon Fund should be the highest priorities
while those actions that have lesser impacts or community benefits such as increasing the green building requirements
would be lower priority. The consultant team also shared the timeline showing how the NZAP actions may be implemented
over time, from 2021 to 2030. The Task Force discussed the plan for implementation of the NZAP action adjustments,
including key partnerships within the business and academic community.
