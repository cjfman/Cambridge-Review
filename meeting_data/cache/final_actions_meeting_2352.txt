Re:

Request to Change Street Names – Dawes Street, Northpoint Boulevard, North Street,
and West Street

I am writing to recommend that the names of Dawes Street, Northpoint Boulevard, North Street,
and West Street be changed. The Northpoint / Cambridge Crossing area has a significant
number of street names that have directional elements; North First Street, North Street,
Northpoint Boulevard and West Street. As the area is becoming developed, there is an
opportunity to improve the naming conventions and to continue building on the previous
approach of naming streets and parks in the area after historical women; Julia Child and Amelia
Earhart. Working with the Historical Commission, we have identified two prominent African
American women with Cambridge connections to name streets after; Harriet A. Jacobs and
Gertrude Wright Morgan.

North Street Becomes Jacobs Street
Harriet A. Jacobs – Abolitionist, author, and women’s rights
advocate and educator, was born into slavery in 1813, in Edenton,
North Carolina. In 1842 she fled to New York, where she gained her
freedom in 1852. She published her autobiography, Incidents in the
Life of a Slave Girl, in 1861. This significant work was ranked with
Fredrick Douglass's My Bondage, My Freedom as a major
contribution in the genre of slave narratives. She used her fame to
advantage to do relief work for African American soldiers during
the Civil War and helped to create and maintain schools for
southern blacks. She purchased the house at 17 Story Street about
1868 and lived there until her death in 1897. She is buried in Mt.
Auburn Cemetery.

1.1.a

Northpoint Blvd (between cul-de-sac and Gilmore Bridge) becomes Morgan Ave
Gertrude Wright Morgan – Born in Springfield, Ill in
1861. She was the first black female student to attend the
high school in Springfield, which integrated its schools in
1874. She graduated high school third in her class and
became a teacher. She married Clement G. Morgan in 1896
and moved to Cambridge soon thereafter. Both Gertrude
and Clement were involved in the Niagara Movement and
the establishment of the NAACP. They hosted prominent
citizens and civil rights leaders in their home at 265
Prospect Street. Gertrude was active in the suffrage
movement, representing her ward on a committee for
better city government. She was president of the
American women at the 2nd Niagara Movement
Conference which took place in the U.S. at Harpers
Women’s Era Club and member of the board of the
Ferry: Mrs. Gertrude Wright Morgan (seated).
Harriet Tubman House. She was appointed by Gov. Cox
to represent Massachusetts at the dedication of the
Frederick Douglass house museum in 1922.

Northpoint Blvd (between Gilmore Bridge and Education Street) becomes Education
Circle
This extends Education Circle to the Gilmore Bridge, highlighting the education activities
occurring in the area.

Dawes Street (between Water Street and Child Street) becomes Water Street
This extends Water Street and eliminates one street name in the area; reducing the number of
street names.
Under Cambridge Regulation, 12.04, Cambridge City Council is the responsible authority for
altering street names.
12.04.010 - Street names affirmed—Changes and new designations
The several streets in the City shall continue to be called by the names heretofore given
to them, until such names are altered by the City Council. The City Council, subject to
any provisions of law relative thereto, shall give names to all streets hereafter laid out
and may change the name of a street at any time, except that no street shall be given the

To the Honorable, the City Council:
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-19, regarding a report on new tree plantings and trash
receptacles in The Port, Public Works Commissioner Owen O'Riordan reports the following:

The city’s planting contractor will be mobilizing in the next few weeks for the spring planting,
which will include 27 new street trees in the Port.
As part of the second phase of construction in the Port, a significant number of streets and
sidewalks will be fully reconstructed (Columbia St, Pine St, Cherry St, Windsor St, Washington
St, Eaton St, School St, and Bishop Allen Dr). Through the community design process, we will
work with residents to identify locations for additional tree plantings, evaluate the feasibility of
widening sidewalks to support additional tree plantings, investigate opportunities for back of
sidewalk tree plantings, and enhance tree planting details to further support the tree canopy the
Port.
Open spaces in the Port are generally well served by Big Belly trash receptacles and the
traditional Victor Stanley trash recepticles; Clement Morgan (3 Big Bellys), Green Rose (4 Big
Bellys), Sennott Park (1 Big Belly and 3 Victor Stanley ) and Squirrel Brand Park (2 Victor
Stanleys). There are also a few Big Bellys and Victor Stanley trash receptacles on street
intersections with significant commercial activity; Cambridgeport School on Elm Street (2 Big
Bellys), Harvard and Windsor (1 Victor Stanley), Columbia and Harvard (1 Victor Stanley),
Columbia and Broadway, (1 Victor Stanley and One Recycling container).
As part of DPWs ongoing analysis of our Big Belly trash recepticle utilization it may
demonstrate that recepticles are underutilized in certain areas of the city and these recepticles
may merit being relocated to locations where the demand is significantly greater It is also
expected that as part of the second phase of construction in the Port additional locations for trash
receptacles will be evalauted to included locations along Windsor Street, as well as switching the
standard trash receptacles for Big Bellys throughout the neighborhood.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-06, regarding a report on outlining how a
prolonged Federal Government shutdown may impact the people in Cambridge, please be
advised of the following:
The latest federal government shut down began on December 22, 2018 and ended January 25,
2019. This was a partial shut-down since most of the federal departments/agencies had been
funded with prior approved budget authorizations. Departments/Agencies partially or completed
closed during the shutdown included: Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, Department of the Interior,
Department of Agriculture, State Department, Department of Justice, National Science
Foundation, Fish and Wildlife, Nation Parks, EPA, National Institute of Standards and
Technology and NOAA.
While the government shutdown was the longest in history, Cambridge was not severely
impacted by the month or so that the federal government and effected departments/agencies were
shut-down because funds for grant reimbursements and other funding that Cambridge receives
were available till February or March. This included grants such as, Community Development
Block Grant, HOME, Continuum of Care Program, Emergency Solutions Grant Program, Fair
Housing Assistance Grant, Partnership Grant and many school grants such as National School
Lunch Program and Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA).
If the shutdown had lasted longer, many important programs would have lost funding impacting
our ability to receive federal grant reimbursements. Fortunately, because of the City’s strong
financial position we would have allowed operations to continue in the short-term assuming
reimbursements would be coming once the shut-down was resolved. However, the shutdown did
cause significant anxiety on the part of many Cambridge residents who were worried about the

potential loss of SNAP, WIC and other benefits if the shutdown had continued. Fortunately, the
shutdown concluded before more people were impacted.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-91, regarding a report on a plan to allow the
Mayor’s Annual Harvard Senior Luncheon to be held regardless of weather conditions, below
please find a communication from Harvard University Director of Government & Community
Relations Thomas Lucey relative to this matter.
"This event is always a highlight of the year for those of us at Harvard that work with the
City/Mayor’s office to produce it. We welcome approximately 1,100 seniors per year. What we
hear most from attendees is their appreciation for the setting; Tercentenary Theater in Harvard
Yard. It is a historic, tranquil and beautiful backdrop for this event and the tree canopy provides
attendees with adequate shade from the sun as well as cover should there be a light rain. Year
after year, attendees tell us that they enjoy being outside for an afternoon of music, dancing, food
and conversation.
Despite the weather challenges in the last few years, there have been only three cancellations in
more than four decades of the event. Moving inside is not an option on Harvard’s Cambridge
campus as we do not own/operate a facility that can accommodate 1,100 people for a sit-down
lunch. Several years ago, when confronted with a difficult weather forecast, other venues were
explored such as the City’s War Memorial facility but it presents challenges due to its use by
summer day camps and the need to install special flooring. No suitable alternative was
identified at that time.
If individuals are still concerned about the viability of this event due to the impact of weather, we
might explore changing the schedule of the event. If it were held in June, heat and humidity
would be less likely to play a factor. In addition, the time between a scheduled date and the
proposed rain date could be extended to avoid the impacts of a pro-longed weather pattern.
While we have experienced some bad weather luck in the last four years, based on feedback

from attendees, it is clear that the preferred location for the event is Harvard Yard. Nonetheless,
we are prepared to work closely with our partners in City Government and Mayor’s Office to
produce an exceptional event for Cambridge senior citizens moving forward regardless of the
location."

In response to Awaiting Report 19-24, regarding pedestrian safety improvements at the
intersection of Day Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and Awaiting Report 19-31, regarding
general safety improvements at the intersection of Spring Street and Third Street, Traffic,
Parking & Transportation Director Joseph Barr reports the following:
Regarding the pedestrian crossing of Massachusetts Avenue at Day Street, this is a location that
we are targeting for the installation of a Rectangular Rapid-Flashing Beacon (RRFB) during the
current construction season. As noted in a prior response to Awaiting Report 16-52
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=4&ID=4162>, RRFBs have been
proven to be an effective tool for improving the rate at which vehicles yield to pedestrians, and
thereby improving the safety of those pedestrians. In recent experience, we have found this
treatment to be particularly useful at these types of “double threat” locations, where pedestrian
must cross two lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Based on this past experience and
research, installing an RRFB at this location should improve the safety of pedestrians and
address the issues that have been raised at this location.
Regarding the intersection of Spring Street and Third Street, we are planning to install all-way
STOP control at this intersection, to clarify right-of-way allocation and address the recent crash
pattern that has been observed. Because the creation of an all-way STOP at this location requires
the installation of new STOP bar pavement markings across Third Street, we have been waiting
for the weather to warm sufficiently to allow these to be installed permanently in thermoplastic
markings. We expect this installation to occur during the month of April, along with installing
the STOP signs and advance warning signs to help make drivers aware of the new STOP control.

Re: Response to Awaiting Report No, 18-133^ Council Order No, 0-9 of

December 3^ 2018 Re: Report on Raising the Fines for Blocking Both
Loading Zones and Bike Lanes to a Comparable Rate to Boston for the
2020 Fiscal Year
Dear Mr. DePasquale:
We have prepared this legal opinion in response to the above referenced Council

Order, which requests a report on whether the City of Cambridge ("City") can increase the
fines for certain parking violations to a rate that is comparable to the rate imposed by the
City of Boston ("Boston"). G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 establishes a maximum amount which a
city or town can impose for parking violations. In my opinion, the City can only increase

parking fines beyond the amounts specified in G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 with legislation
authorizing a fine increase.
I.

G.L.c.90.§20Al/2
G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 establishes general requirements regarding the issuance,

notification, and appeal procedures for parking tickets. In addition, G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2
authorizes cities and towns to appoint commissions or directors to promulgate traffic rules
and establish fine schedules for parking violations. In creating fine schedules,
commissions and directors are required to comply with the maximum fine amounts

specified in G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2. Specifically, G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 states that the
commission or director with authority to promulgate traffic rules:

shall, from time to time, establish by rule or regulation a schedule of fines
for violations subject to this section committed within such city or town,

Attachment: Fines comparable to Boston's response 040119 (CMA 2019 #82 : parking fines comparable to Boston's)

provided, however, that all such fines shall be uniform for the same offense
committed in the same zone or district, if any.. .and provided further, that

1.15.a

II. Other Cities and Towns
Several cities and towns have increased parking fines beyond the amounts specified

in G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 through legislation authorizing fine increases. Specifically, the
Massachusetts Legislature has enacted Special Acts authorizing fines in excess of the

amounts specified in G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 or providing towns and cities with the authority
to establish fines in excess of the amounts specified in G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2. Such

legislation has been enacted in the Town of Harwich and the Cities of Gloucester,
Somerville, and Boston.

With respect to Boston, it has the authority to impose penalties beyond the
amounts proscribed in G.L. c. 90, §20A1/2 through local ordinance. See An Act

Establishing the Boston Traffic Commission and Defining its Powers and Duties, 1929
Mass. Acts. 263 ("Boston's Enabling Statute"), as amended by 1982 Mass. Acts 190.

Boston has this authority through a 1982 amendment to its Enabling Statute. See id.
Pursuant to Section 13A of 1982 Mass. Acts 190:
The commission' may adopt, amend and repeal rules and regulations
prescribing a penalty, set by ordinance with the approval of the mayor
and city council, for any violation of a rule or regulation adopted under
this section or promulgated under section two B; provided, that no
penalty in excess of fifteen dollars shall be imposed except by ordinance...
In June 2018^ Boston increased parking fines beyond the amounts contained in G.L.
c. 90, §20A1/2. The increase occurred as a result of an amendment to Boston Municipal

Code Chapter 6-6, which was passed by the Boston City Council.
II. Analysis

The City of Cambridge also has an enabling statute which grants certain powers
and duties to the Director of the Department of Traffic and Parking. Pursuant to "An Act

Establishing A Department of Traffic and Parking and a Board of Traffic and Parking in
the City of Cambridge," 1961 Mass. Acts 455 ("City's Enabling Statute"), the Traffic
Director may adopt, amend, and repeal rules and regulations regarding motor vehicle
traffic and parking which are "not inconsistent with general law as modified by this act."

In addition, the Traffic Director may establish a fine schedule for parking violations in
accordance with G.L. c. 90A, §20A1/2. Wliile the City's Enabling Statute has been
amended several times, none of these amendments have increased the fine amounts beyond

Attachment: Fines comparable to Boston's response 040119 (CMA 2019 #82 : parking fines comparable to Boston's)

any fine established under the provisions of this section for all other
parking violations shall not exceed $50, if paid within 21 days, nor shall it
exceed $55, if paid thereafter, but before the parking clerk reports to the
registrar, as provided below and shall not exceed $75 if paid thereafter.

1 The term "commission" refers to the Boston Traffic Commission. A subsequent Special Act amended the
agency's name to the Boston Transportation Department ("BTD"), 1986 Mass. Acts 68. BTD has the
authority to amend, adopt, and repeal motor vehicle traffic and parking laws for Boston. See id.

1.15.a

the amounts contained in G.L. c. 90, §20Al/2 or given the City authority to establish fines
in excess ofG.L. c. 90, §20A1/2.

an act from the Massachusetts Legislature authorizing a fine increase. Other towns and
cities have obtained special legislation approving increased fine amounts. I recommend
that the City follow this practice to ensure compliance with Massachusetts General Laws if
the City wishes to increase such fines.

'Cambridge Municipal Election People's Pledge'; and Awaiting Report #18-136 Re:
Report Back on Submitting a Proposal that Candidates Would Agree to not Accept
Donations from Persons Outside of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Dear Mr. DePasquale:
This is in response to the two Awaiting Report items referenced above, which are based

on Council Order 0-8 of 1/28/19, Council Order 0-15 of 12/3/18, and Council Order 0-4 of
4/30/18. In brief, the City Council is requesting information around the public funding of
municipal School Committee and City Council elections; as well as the creation of a voluntary
pledge program in which candidates would voluntarily agree to limit their campaign
expenditures, restrict the donations they would accept, and publicly release a copy of their most

recent federal tax return in exchange for the City notifying voters that participating candidates
have taken the pledge. Both of the proposed programs contain elements that are not permitted
under current law and present a number of practical difficulties.

A. The "Cambridge Municipal Election People's Pledge"
The proposed "Cambridge Municipal Election People's Pledge" program (the "Pledge")
would be a voluntary program. In order to comply with the requirements of the Pledge,

Attachment: campaign financing 040119 (CMA 2019 #83 : Campaign financing)

795 Massachusetts Avenue
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139

candidates would have to limit campaign expenditures (to $30,000 for City Council candidates;
to $20,000 for School Committee candidates); limit the total of donations accepted (to $35,000
for City Council candidates; to $25,000 for School Committee candidates); limit the amount of
an individual donation to $200; agree to release their most recent federal tax return; and not
accept donations from outside of Massachusetts. For candidates who participate in the Pledge,

the Election Commission would notify voters which candidates are participating by mailing such
information to voters, prominently displaying such information on the City web-slte and stating
such information on the City ballot.

Facsimile (617) 349-4134

TTY/TTD (617) 349-4242

Packet Pg. 62

1.16.a

If the proposed Election Commission actions on behalf of candidates taking the Pledge are
essential elements of the Pledge, then the most fundamental legal problem with the Pledge is that
the proposed actions regarding the notification of voters would likely violate the comprehensive
set of campaign finance laws in G.L.c.55 and could violate constitutional principles that prohibit
the use of public money to influence an election. Both the General Counsel for the State Office
of Campaign and Political Finance and the General Counsel for the Elections Division for the
Secretary of the Commonwealth raised this concern in informal discussions.

In Anderson v. City of Boston, 376 Mass. 178 (1978), the Supreme Judicial Court held that
changed how real estate is classified for tax purposes. The SJC held that, G.L.c.55 regulating
campaign finance was ".. .comprehensive legislation, enacted after the adoption of the Home

Rule Amendment, regulating election financing [which] manifests an intention to bar
municipalities from engaging in the expenditure of funds to influence election results." Id. at
185. The Legislature's "strong interest in free and fair elections is expressed in the Constitution

of the Commonwealth" in Article 9. In Anderson, the SJC specifically prohibited the use of
public funds to pay for printed materials for distribution to voters intended to influence the voters
one way or the other. Id. at 200. The SJC noted:

Surely, the constitution of the United States does not authorize the expenditure of
public funds to promote the reelection of... local officials (to the exclusion of their
opponents), even though the open discussion of political candidates and elections is basic
First Amendment material. Government domination of the expression of ideas is
repugnant to our system of constitutional government. In this Commonwealth, we might

find a constitutional bar to such an attempt at political self-perpetuation in Art. 9 of the
Declaration of Rights of our Constitution, concerning free elections, and in
considerations of equal protection and due process of law. Id. at n. 14.

Therefore, those elements of the Pledge that would require the Election Commission to notify
voters which candidates have agreed to the provisions of the Pledge appear to violate the state
Constitution. If so, there would be no legal way for the City to adopt the Pledge if it contained
that requirement; as a general legal principle, special acts applicable to a particular municipality
passed by the Legislature may over-ride general laws applicable to all municipalities, but special
acts may not contradict and cannot over-ride Massachusetts or Federal constitutional
requirements.

In addition to violating the prohibition of spending public funds to influence voters in an
election, the element of stating information on the ballot indicating which candidates made the
Pledge and, by implication, which did not, would violate current provisions of the City Charter
(G.L.c.43, §112) and other state law (G.L.c.54, §41). The Charter specifies the form and
contents of City election ballots. The Charter provides for what information shall be on the
official ballot and provides that no official ballot shall have printed thereon any political

Boston could not use public funds to influence voters regarding a referendum that would have

1 In Anderson, the SJC mentioned but did not explicitly decide whether the appropriation at
issue in the case to influence a referendum vote was a constitutionally permissible expenditure of

funds for a public purpose, or whether the proposed use of funds violated constitutional
principles of equal protection and due process.

designation or mark related to the name of any candidate "... or anything showing how he was
nominated or indicating his views or opinions." A statement that a candidate has taken the
Pledge would indicate certain of that candidate's views or opinions. Additionally, G.L.c.54, §41
provides what information shall be on a local ballot, which includes that candidate's name, street
address, and, if the candidate is an incumbent the words "Candidate for Reelection." In the case

ofGalluccio v. Election Commissioners of Cambridge, 339 Mass. 587 (1959), the SJC held that
the words "Candidate for Reelection" required by G.L.c.54, §41 should be added to the
Cambridge ballot even though not specifically required by the Plan E Charter (i.e. G.L.c.43,
§112) because adding such language was not inconsistent with the Charter section and was
Although the Pledge as proposed does not appear to be legally permissible, I am not aware of
any legal prohibition against a candidate voluntarily agreeing to limit his/her campaign
expenditures, deciding which campaign donations to accept and in what amounts, and even
releasing his/her individual tax returns. I note however that tax returns contain some normally
confidential personal information such as the social security numbers of the filer, any joint filer,
and any dependents. Candidates may not want to release an unredacted tax return publicly.

Therefore, in my opinion a candidate could take the Pledge and promote that fact himself or
herself, without the involvement of the Election Commission or other City department.

B. The "Cambridge Publicly Financed Municipal Election Program"
The proposed "Cambridge Publicly Financed Municipal Election Program" (the "Program")
would also be a voluntary program and would allocate City funds to candidates to help finance
their campaigns. The Program would only be available to candidates meeting certain income

eligibility requirements, such as those used to determine eligibility for affordable housing.
Candidates (if any) meeting the low-income eligibility requirements would receive $15,000 if a
City Council candidate and $10,000 if a School Committee candidate for non-personnel
campaign expenditures: if they do not raise more than an additional $20,000 or $15,000
respectively; if they expend no more than $30,000 and $20,000 respectively; if they accept
individual contributions of no more than $200 per individual; if they release a copy of their
Federal income tax return; if they agree not to accept donations from people outside

Massachusetts; if they return to the City any unspent amounts of publicly funded campaign funds
after the election; and if they subject their campaigns to audit by the City to ensure compliance
with the requirements of the Program.
There are constitutional concerns raised by the Program. The Program and the Pledge

considered above are similar in that, as conceived, they both would provide public benefits to
candidates in exchange for the candidate meeting certain requirements. The Program and Pledge

otherwise required by the General Laws.

differ in that the Pledge proposes to provide public benefits in specific forms that require the City
to "speak" to voters directly via published materials that would in a way express support for
particular candidates. The Program would provide public funds directly to candidates. While
there are many forms around the country at both the state and local level of public funding for
candidates, each program, and each element of each program, must be constitutional under the
First Amendment. Some elements of public funding programs have been struck down by the
courts on First Amendment grounds, while others have not. It is difficult to predict how courts

will analyze aspects of public funding programs that they have not considered before, but I offer
the following analysis.

Packet Pg. 64

1.16.a

A significant constitutional issue for the Program is that it is to be offered only to candidates
who meet some low personal income threshold, but not to other candidates. In McCutcheon v.

Federal Election Commission, 572 U.S. 185 (2014), the United State Supreme Court held that a
statutory aggregate campaign contribution limit violated the First Amendment. In McCutcheon,
572 U.S. at 191, the Court stated what reasons may justify governmental limits on campaign
contributions, finding that:
Our cases have held that Congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against
corruption or the appearance of corruption, [citations omitted] At the same time, we have

money in politics, or to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the
relative influence of others.. .. Any regulation must instead target what we have called
"quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.
Furthermore, the Court stated (Id. at 206-207):

This Court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting
campaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, [citations
omitted] We have consistently rejected attempts to suppress campaign speech based on

other legislative objectives. No matter how desirable it may seem, it is not an acceptable
governmental objective to 'level the playing field/ or to * level electoral opportunities, or
to "equalize the financial resources of candidates.' [citations omitted] The First
Amendment prohibits such legislative attempts to 'fine-tune' the electoral process, no
matter how well intentioned.

It is difficult to see how making the Program available only to low income candidates furthers
the City's interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. Singling out low

income candidates for public funding appears to be an attempt to "equalize the financial
resources" of low income candidates with the financial resources of candidates who have more
personal financial resources to invest in a campaign, or to "level the playing field," or to "level
electoral opportunities," which are precisely the interests that the Supreme Court in McCutcheon
rejected as constitutionally invalid under the First Amendment. There does not appear to be a
basis for asserting that low income candidates are more likely to be corrupt, or appear to be
corrupt, than candidates whose income is a little or a lot higher than the low income threshold.
While the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption could be asserted as a basis
for a public funding program made available to all candidates, regardless of personal income,

there does not appear to be any such basis for public funding to be provided only to low income
candidates.

Attachment: campaign financing 040119 (CMA 2019 #83 : Campaign financing)

made clear that Congress may not regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of

In Davis v. Federal Election Commission, 554 U.S. 724 (2008), the Supreme Court struck
down a public funding regime that tried to level the financial resources of candidates who were
able to invest large amounts of their own money into their campaigns with those candidates who
could not do so. The Court held in Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v,

Bennett. 564 US. 721, 748 (2011) that: "[D]iscrimmatory contribution limits meant to 'level
electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth" did not ser^e 'a legitimate
government objective let alone a compelling one."

Packet Pg. 65

1.16.a

Recently, the SJC in 1A Auto, Inc. v. Director of the Office of Campaign and Political
Finance, 480 Mass. 423 (2018) held that the State's ban on corporate contributions to candidates
was constitutional. The SJC noted that, ".. .laws that limit political spending must be recognized
as 'operating in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities." Id. at 428. The

SJC noted the longstanding distinction first articulated in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976)
between laws that limit independent expenditures and laws that limit contributions to candidates.
[independent expenditure limits are subject to strict scrutiny, whereas contribution limits are
reviewed under a less rigorous standard, and will be upheld as long as they are 'closely drawn' to
match a 'sufficiently important interest.'" The SJC noted that in the 40 years since Buckley, the

Although in 1A Auto the SJC was considering corporate contributions and corporate political
expenditures, it is possible that the courts would take a dim view of the candidate campaign
expenditure limits set in the Program. The City would be curtailing the rights of candidates to
spend as much money as they deemed necessary to run a campaign, thereby limiting the

candidates' ability to exercise their right to speak, as a condition of receiving public funding.
However, basing the contribution and expenditure amounts on historical candidate expenditures

for City Council and School Committee races are factors that a reviewing court would view
favorably in assessing the constitutionality of those limits. In Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230
(2006), the Supreme Court struck down as violative of the First Amendment certain provisions
of the Vermont Campaign Finance Reform Act that set limits on the amounts that candidates for
state office could spend on their campaigns, and that limited too much how much individuals,
organization and political parties could contribute to candidates for state office. The Court noted
that it had upheld contribution limits in the past, but not all such limits will be constitutional.
Assuming the Program would pass constitutional muster, creation of the Program would

require a special act passed by the State Legislature and signed by the Governor because the
City s Home Rule powers to legislate locally do not include the power to regulate elections,
especially not inconsistently with State law. In the Program, for example, there is the proposed

requirement that individual contributions be limited to $200 per individual even though in
G.L.c.55, the individual donation limit is $1,000.
There are also practical enforcement and compliance issues that would need to be addressed.

These include how the City would administratively determine compliance with Program
requirements and what the City would do in the event it discovers that candidates have violated
Program requirements. The City could not rely on the State's Office of Campaign and Political
Finance to administer and enforce any of the Program's local requirements. Penalties for
violating Program requirements would have to be created, or else candidates in the Program

Court has declared unconstitutional almost every independent expenditure limit that has come
before it, and has upheld most contribution limits. Id. at 429-430.

would have no legal incentive for complying with its terms. The City would have to expand its
administrative capacities to manage and oversee the Program. Also, as conceived, the Program
would allow any candidate meeting the low-income threshold to obtain public money. Many

public funding programs contain other eligibility requirements, such as having to raise a certain
amount of small donations to prove that the candidacy has some support. For the Program, a

candidate could obtain City money and not raise any money on his/her own either before or
during the campaign. A candidate who doesn't spend the public money for campaign purposes is
required under the Program to return "unspent" funds, but there could be difficult enforcement

issues if a low-income candidate has received and misspent the public funds on non-campaign
items and then the City tries to recover the misspent funds from that low-income individual.
Conclusion
For the reasons stated» both of the proposed programs contain elements that are likely not
permitted under current law and present a number of practical difficulties as outlined above.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-1, which requests a report on the
recently adopted regulations of the short-term rental revenue and the necessary steps to impose
and access the revenue from the excise and community impact fees. Please see the attached legal
opinion from the City Solicitor providing a detailed analysis of the above questions. Below is a
summary of the action the Council may take concerning the short-term rental local option room
occupancy excise tax and community impact fees, for the Council’s consideration. Additionally,
please note that information concerning the new short-term rental legislation and the City’s
Short-Term Rental Zoning Ordinance is available on the Inspectional Services Department
(“ISD”) website, and the City will be mailing another communication to all property owners
informing them of the requirement that all short-term rentals obtain a Certificate of Registration
from ISD.
The recently adopted legislation known as An Act Regulating and Insuring Short-Term Rentals,
which is Chapter 337 of the Acts of 2018 (the “Act”), makes short-term rentals as of July 1, 2019
subject to state room occupancy excise tax, and allows municipalities to impose local room
occupancy excise tax (“Local Room Tax”) on short-term rentals. The City has previously
adopted the Local Room Tax in the amount of six percent (6%), and the Act automatically
amends the Local Room Tax to also apply to short-term rentals, so no further action is required
by the City Council for the Local Room Tax to apply to short-term rentals.
The Act also allows municipalities to adopt G.L. c.64G, §3D in order to impose a Community
Impact Fee in an amount up to three percent (3%) of rent on the transfer of occupancy of shortterm rentals as of July 1, 2019. If adopted, at least thirty-five percent (35%) of the funds
collected have to be used for affordable housing or local infrastructure projects. The Community
Impact Fee is broken down into two categories, each of which requires a separate vote to accept
by the City Council.

Packet Pg. 68

1.17

The first category is “professionally managed units.” Although the City’s Short-Term Rental
Zoning Ordinance, which is Article 4, Section 4.60 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance (the
“STR Ordinance”), only allows operator-occupied short-term rentals or owner-adjacent shortterm rentals, it is possible to have short-term rentals that are lawful under the STR Ordinance and
that will fall under the Act’s definition of “professionally managed unit.” A “professionally
managed unit” is defined as “1 or 2 or more short-term rental units that are located in the same
city or town, operated by the same operator and are not located within a single-family, twofamily or three-family dwelling that includes the operator’s primary residence.” Under the STR
Ordinance, a single operator can have an operator-occupied short-term rental and an owneradjacent short-term rental in a four-family dwelling. If this scenario arises, both of those units
will be subject to the Community Impact Fee under the definition of “professionally managed
unit” even though they are not operated by a professional management company.
If the City Council first votes to adopt the Community Impact Fee as to professionally managed
units, the City Council may vote to impose the Community Impact Fee on the second category,
which is short-term rentals within two-family or three-family dwellings that include the
operator’s primary residence.
A majority vote of the City Council is necessary for acceptance of G.L. c.64G, §3D(a), which
applies to the transfer of occupancy of professionally managed units, and if that passes, a
majority vote of the City Council is necessary for acceptance of G.L. c.64G, §3D(b), which
applies to the transfer of occupancy of short-term rentals within two-family or three-family
dwellings. I am hereby requesting that the Council vote to accept G.L. c.64G, §3D(a) and (b).
Very truly yours,

April 1, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am writing to ask for your approval to seek authorization from the Massachusetts Office of the
Inspector General (the “IG”) for the City to use the Construction Manager at Risk (“CMaR”) procurement
and construction method (the “CMaR Method”) in connection with the Tobin Montessori and Vassal
Lane Upper Schools Project. By way of background, in 2004 the Massachusetts Legislature passed
construction reform legislation that allowed Massachusetts public agencies and municipalities to use the
CMaR Method for the first time. The CMaR Method has been commonly used by the private sector for
some time and is an alternative to the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149. Since the
legislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for, and are using the CMaR
Method.
The Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for using the CMaR Method.
Once a public agency or municipality’s (hereafter “Municipality”) governing body authorizes the use of
the CMaR Method, the Municipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality’s
awarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMaR Method. The application
requires that the Municipality demonstrate the following:
a: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a contract with a
CMaR firm.
b: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place and approved of by
the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively procure and manage CMaR services for the
specific project and has retained the services of a qualified owner’s project manager.
c: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation and
reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.
d: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00 or more.
e: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMaR Method is appropriate for the
building project and states the reasons in writing for the determination.

Packet Pg. 79

1.18

This memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and process governing
the use of the CMaR Method in support of my seeking City Council approval to utilize this construction
method for the Project. My submission to you of this memorandum is the first step in satisfying the above
referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMaR Method for the Tobin Montessori and
Vassal Lane Upper Schools Project and will answer the following questions:
•
•
•
•

What is CMaR?
What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical
construction projects in the past?
What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMaR Method?
What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?

What is Construction Management at Risk (CMaR)?
The CMaR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications and price. The City will
procure the CMaR via a two-step Request For Qualifications (“RFQ”) and Request For Proposal (“RFP”)
process.
The type of contract the City will enter into with the CMaR is a cost-plus fixed fee amount with a
Guaranteed Maximum Price (“GMP”). The GMP is the sum of the CMaR fee, and the costs associated
with the CMaR’s general conditions for construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMaR
estimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of the GMP and includes the
CMaR’s contingency. The CMaR agrees to pay for costs that exceed the GMP that are not the result of
changes in the contract documents. This is one of the reasons a CMaR is selected prior to the plans and
specifications being completed. The CMaR works with the owner and the architect to develop the scope
delineated in the contract documents as part of the team.
The fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the CMaR during the selection
process based upon an estimated cost of construction. The CMaR’s contingency belongs to the CMaR if it
is needed but is turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within the GMP and is
used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP is established that arise during the
project.
By law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications are at a minimum of 60%
complete. The closer the documents are to being 100% complete, the less the CMaR’s contingency line
item is. The Owner’s contingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at the
time the GMP is established. The CMaR’s contingency is included in the GMP; the owner’s contingency
is outside of the GMP.
The City Manager’s project management staff will work closely with the City’s Architect, consultants and
CMaR to determine the appropriate contingencies.
What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in
the past?
The City has used M.G.L. c. 149 and the M.G.L. c. 149A delivery process in the past for bidding vertical
construction. This process, also defined as “design-bid-build”, requires all of the construction bid
packages to be available only after 100% completion of the design documents. Under this traditional
approach, the lowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project.

Packet Pg. 80

1.18

The City has previously been approved by the IG to use the CMaR Method for the 5 Western Avenue
project, the Dr. Martin Luther King School on Putnam Avenue, the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper
School and Community Complex, the Foundry project, and the Multi-Department Relocation Plan which
was recently approved by the Inspector General.
What are some of the pros and cons of using the CMaR method?
Pros:
•

The selection of the CMaR through an RFQ process allows the City to better define the specific
requirements the City is looking for in a CMaR firm. The submission of defined company
qualifications the presentation of these qualifications by the CMaR team to a selection committee
allows for a better interaction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified
CMaR for the project.

•

The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to specific City requirements,
not the lowest price. The CMaR is selected, rather than awarded due to the lowest bid. The
working relationship between the CMaR, the Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a
working relationship that is developed during the process leading up to the establishment of the
GMP.

•

The CMaR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope of work for the
filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMaR takes the lead in defining the peripheral scope of work
for staging, lifts, temporary lighting, miscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work
disputes (a cost to the owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places
responsibility directly with the CMaR as the responsible party for defining each sub-bidders’
drawings and specifications.

•

The CMaR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City’s project team with
scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and constructability reviews.

•

With the CMaR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of hazardous materials
can run concurrently while the project design is being finalized.

•

The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the scopes of work as defined
by the Architect is reduced because the CMaR is participating in the delineation of the scope of
work during the pre-construction services.

•

If the City and the selected CMaR do not come to an agreement as to the GMP, then the City has
the option of bidding the project.

Cons:
•

The CMaR Method reduces the risk for the CMaR contractor as he/she is involved early in the
schematic design process. The CMaR’s risk is mitigated by his/her early involvement during the
design phase and his/her contingency that is established as part of the GMP.

•

The CMaR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMaR firm but that risk is
minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is established.
Packet Pg. 81

1.18

What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?
The first step is the CMaR Method is submission of an application to the IG. The IG’s response for
approval or denial of the application is due in 60 days.
Submission in April 2019 would place the IG approval in June 2019. This coincides with Feasibility
Study being prepared by Perkin Eastman, Inc. the Feasibility Study is scheduled to be submitted to the
City in October 2019.
Getting the CMaR under contract for the pre-con services will help provide critical information as to site
logistics and how to best handle the variety of options available to remediate any soil issues on this site.
I look forward to answering any questions you may have about the application and the CMAR Method
that we propose to use for this Project.

Introduction

Office of the Inspector General
Construction Management at Risk Application to Proceed
Prior to using the construction management at risk (CM at risk) delivery method to
procure a contract for the construction, reconstruction, installation, demolition,
maintenance, or repair of any building estimated to cost $5 million or more, an awarding
authority must obtain a Notice to Proceed to use the CM at risk delivery method from
the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).
The OIG has developed this CM at risk application to be completed on a project specific
basis. The application process will be important to awarding authorities in assessing
the qualifications and commitments that are necessary to the process to ensure
construction of a high-quality, cost-effective public building project.
Under M.G.L. c. 149A, §4, the OIG will issue a Notice to Proceed when the public
agency has demonstrated that:
a. The public agency has authorization from its governing body to enter into a
contract with a construction management at risk firm. The authorization shall
include the results of any public vote if applicable.
b. The public agency has the capacity, a plan and procedures in place and
approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively procure and
manage construction management at-risk services for the specific project and
has retained the services of a qualified owner's project manager.
c. The public agency has in place procedures to ensure fairness in competition,
evaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.
d. The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000 or more.
e. The public agency has determined that the use of construction management at
risk services is appropriate for the building project and states in writing the
reasons for the determination.
The OIG will review an awarding authority’s complete application and within 60 days
from the date a completed application is received will determine whether the awarding
authority meets the requirements necessary to obtain a Notice to Proceed.
Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 149A, if the OIG declines to issue a Notice to Proceed to an
awarding authority, the OIG shall provide in writing to the awarding authority the
reason(s) for the decision. An awarding authority not receiving a Notice to Proceed may
resubmit its application upon correcting or responding to the reason(s) for denial
provided to the awarding authority by the OIG. The OIG shall make a timely review of

1.18.a

the resubmitted application and, if the awarding authority meets the requirements, the
OIG will issue a Notice to Proceed.
The OIG shall decline to issue a Notice to proceed to an awarding authority that has
failed to provide complete and accurate answers to all questions in the application and
all other information and documentation required by the OIG. Providing false,
misleading, or incomplete information will be considered grounds for denial.
Applications must be submitted to: Office of the Inspector General, Room 1311, One
Ashburton Place, Boston, MA 02108.
If you have any questions regarding the application process, contact Mary Kolesar,
Senior Policy Analyst, Policy and Government Division, at 617-722-8809 or by e-mail at

Evaluation Process
Office of the Inspector General’s Evaluation Process
The OIG will review the information submitted by the awarding authority and assess
whether the plan and procedures provide an adequate framework for procuring and
managing a CM at risk delivery method project. The following criteria will be used in
making a determination whether to issue a Notice to Proceed.
Is the estimated construction cost $5 million or more?
Did the awarding authority receive approval from the appropriate governing body? 4
Did the awarding authority’s governing body approve the plan and procedures?
Are the awarding authority’s goals and objectives for using the construction manager
at risk method reasonable and designed to maximize competition?
Has the awarding authority established an experienced and effective project
organization structure, including an owner representative as a point of contact, an
owner’s project manager, and a designer?
Is the decision–making authority clear?
Do any project team members have relevant CM at risk experience for the size and
scope of the project?
Does the plan and do the procedures demonstrate an appropriate assessment of the
owner’s tasks and responsibilities associated with a CM at risk contract, including all
aspects of coordination and administration of the CM at risk delivery method?
Has the awarding authority established a plan for acquiring appropriate expertise to
assist where the team may not have the necessary experience to meet anticipated
challenges?
Does the plan and do the procedures provide an adequate framework for conducting
the two-phase selection process for a construction manager at risk firm and clearly
delineate the methods that will be used to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation,
and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement, and otherwise comply with all
statutory requirements?
Does the plan and do the procedures provide an adequate framework for negotiating
the cost-plus not to exceed guaranteed maximum price form of contract?
Does the plan and do the procedures provide an adequate framework for conducting
the two-phase selection process for trade contractors and clearly delineate the methods
that will be used to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation, and reporting of results at
every stage in the procurement, and otherwise comply with all statutory requirements?

April 1, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am submitting the attached proposed Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance to the City Council
which would, among other things, create a social equity and economic empowerment applicant preference
for proposed cannabis businesses in the City. The recent zoning ordinance passed on December 17, 2018
by the Council provided at §11.806 that the zoning for cannabis businesses would take effect on April 20,
2019 “or upon passage of a ‘Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance,’ whichever comes first.” After the
Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance is enacted, actions required by the City Council relating to
cannabis businesses in the City would be completed.
This draft Ordinance creates an independent permitting process that all cannabis businesses in the City
will be required to satisfy as a condition to operating in Cambridge. The Ordinance applies to Cannabis
Retail Stores, Cannabis Cultivators, Cannabis Product Manufacturers and Cannabis Transporters. The
Ordinance creates an initial two-year period of exclusivity allowing only Priority Applicants, as defined
in the Ordinance, to obtain a Cannabis Business Permit in the City. After the two years, other applicants
may also be granted Cannabis Business Permits. Group A Priority Applicants are defined in the
Ordinance as those certified by the Commonwealth as Economic Empowerment or Social Equity Program
applicants, or a Women or Minority Owned business. Group B Priority Applicants are existing
Registered Marijuana Dispensaries (“RMDs”) selling medical cannabis who also want to sell retail
cannabis. All applicants must satisfy the ten permitting requirements listed in section 5 of the Ordinance.
The permitting process will be primarily administered and enforced by the Inspectional Services
Department. However, the Community Development Department, Public Health Department and the
Police Department will also have a role to play in the administration and enforcement of the Ordinance
provisions. In brief, the Ordinance proposes the following steps in the overall City permitting process for
Cannabis Businesses:
a. Priority Applicants to request certification as such by the Director of the Economic
Development Division of the Community Development Department;
b. All applicants to enter into a Host Community Agreement with the City to be executed by the
City Manager and the applicant;
c. All applicants to apply for and obtain a Planning Board special permit in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance;

Packet Pg. 107

1.19

d. All applicants to obtain all other permits and approval required by State and local laws and
regulations to the extent that such other permits and approvals can be obtained prior to the
City’s issuance of the Cannabis Business Permit; and
e. All applicants to obtain the Cannabis Business Permit from the Inspectional Services
Department provided for by the attached Ordinance.
The Cannabis Business Permit will be subject to annual renewal and will be subject to revocation
if the holder violates the applicable laws and/or permit conditions. Both ISD and CDD will have
authority to promulgate regulations to implement the Ordinance with respect to their respective Ordinance
responsibilities.
This Ordinance has been informed by discussions that have taken place over the past several months at
the City Council and its Public Safety Committee, Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee,
and Economic Development and University Relations Committee. This draft was prepared with the
participation of several departments, including the Law Department, Community Development
Department, Public Health Department, Inspectional Services Department, Police Department, Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department, Department of Human Services Programs and License
Commission.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager

“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering

In City Council March 18, 2019

The Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a
public hearing on February 27, 2019 at 5:34 PM in the Sullivan Chamber.
The purpose of the hearing was to discuss a proposed amendment to the Municipal Code in Title

Packet Pg. 149

2.5

staff, clarification questions by the City Council, public comment and then recommendations and
next steps.
Mayor McGovern made introductory remarks. He thanked all those involved with the drafting
of the Cycling Safety Ordinance. He thanked all who attended City Council meetings, speaking
to make the streets safer, greener and healthier for all, including cyclists and pedestrians. He
stated that he hoped that this ordinance will set expectations for use of the street spaces and how
infrastructure work will occur. He noted that the ordinance establishes predictability for
businesses and neighborhoods and insures that the installation of permanent bike lanes is part of
a thoughtful process that considers the whole streetscape. He spoke about the benefits of the
Western Avenue infrastructure improvements. He stated that Cambridge is capable of creating
streets that work for all modes of transportation. He stated that the City has been discussing
making streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists for a long time and there has been no shortage of
research, studies and public comment, rallies and meetings, but there are still too many injuries
and fatalities on the streets. He commented that he never wants to attend another “ghost bike”
memorial again. He added that talk and process alone will not create the network of safe bike
infrastructure that is needed. He stated that the drafting of this ordinance was a team effort and
represents reasonable compromise on both sides to bring Cambridge to a necessary place.
At this time Mr. Durbin introduced Cambridge Bike Safety volunteers Mr. Feigenbaum and
Ruthann Rudel. Mr. Durbin stated that Cambridge Bicycle Safety will go over the purpose and
goals. He stated that he will present the ordinance text. He stated that the City departments will
discuss the process and implementation. He proceeded with the Presentation (ATTACHMENT
B).
Ruthann Rudel discussed Cambridge Bike Safety’s purpose and goals. She added that
Cambridge enacted many bike infrastructure improvements, such as Vision Zero, the Vehicle
Trip Reduction Ordinance, Growth Policy Document, the Climate Protection Plan and zoning
changes. She stated that the City Council has goals for Healthy Community and the
Environment and improving public safety. She stated that making it possible to bike safely in
Cambridge is consistent with all of those policies.
She stated that redesigning roads to create safe space for cyclists is difficult to achieve; it is
controversial to reallocate road space. She noted that this ordinance is intended to address some
of the obstacles. She spoke about cycling accidents that have occurred trying to cycle around the
City. She stated that Cambridge’s data show that first responders are called to a crash involving
a bike and motor vehicle once every three days. She spoke about the different levels of
experience of cyclists and that the road needs to be made safer for cyclists to accommodate the
different levels of experience. She stated that 60% of residents were interested in cycling, but
are concerned about safety, and 81% preferred protected bike lanes as a way to move around the
City. She stated that some active bicyclists are enthusiastic about protected bike lanes and some
aren’t. The protected bike lanes are built to make cycling comfortable for all ages and
experience levels to get around the City safely. This is how there will be a sustainable mode
shift.
She stated that the quick-build protected bike lane on Cambridge Street received a one-year
report of data and bike crashes were reduced from 5 to 2. No pedestrian crashes were reported.
Motor vehicle speed was reduced from 31 to 25 MPH. She also highlighted the benefits of the
installation of the Western Avenue Cycle track. She stated that 40% of common crashes in
Cambridge involve dooring and would be prevented by protected bike lanes.

2.5

Mr. Feigenbaum stated that the data for the Cambridge and Western Avenue bike lanes indicates
that speed has been reduced. This is significant regarding whether a cyclist will survive from a
crash with a motor vehicle. He added that an individual hit by a car traveling 40 MPH is more
likely to die than a car traveling 20 MPH. He stated that with a network of protected bike lanes
there will be less of a “Wild West” mentality on the roads. Cyclists will behave more
predictively because cyclists have a full network of reserved space. This relieves stress for all
users. This also promotes transportation equity by reducing greenhouse gas and promotes good
health.
Mr. Durbin spoke about the purpose statement from the ordinance. He spoke about the
legislative background of the ordinance. Language was finalized in November and December
and then introduced to the City Council. He reviewed the definitions. He stated that
improvements do not include repairs to City streets. He stated that there are only two
requirements. The first is when improvements are made to a City-owned street. Under the City’s
Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall ensure improvements comply
with the Cambridge Bicycle Plan or any superseding plan. If improvements are made to a
segment of a separated network, a permanent separated bike lane with adequate directionality
shall be installed along the segment. He added that there are two exceptions under Requirements
B. He spoke about how the ordinance will be made effective and highlighted rare circumstances.
At this time City Staff gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT C). DPW Commissioner
O’Riordan gave a brief background of the Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan.
This is included in the proposed ordinance, as it contains streets and sidewalks that the City
anticipates repairing in five years. He stated that the program has been in place since 2007. He
stated that the FY 2018 map shows the projected improvements to streets and large utility
projects. The five-year plan promotes the Complete Streets philosophy and Vision Zero. He
stated that Complete Streets are designed to be accessible for everyone. He stated that by the
City Council adopted Complete Streets and Vision Zero, and since 2016 there has been more
State funding received by the City. He stated that other policies and plans such as the Pedestrian
Plan, Bike Plan, Transit Plan, Climate Change Plan, and Urban Forest are all developing plans
for the streets. He stated that the Vehicle Trip Ordinance and Cambridge Growth Policy
promote livability and improved air quality by reducing gas emissions. He spoke about ways to
improve mobility. He stated that a Traffic Calming Program has been enacted for twenty years.
The core goal of the Five-Year Plan was to look at accessibility across the City. He spoke about
sidewalks and streets being more welcoming to all. He explained what the City looks at in terms
the sidewalks being accessible. He explained the criteria taken into consideration when doing
sidewalk reconstruction. He stated that the Bike Plan contains a framework for providing
accessibility for Complete Streets across the City. He spoke about accessibility for people using
public transit. He stated that the City infrastructure is improved to provide a more efficient and
better experience for those who use public transit. He spoke about street trees and the City is
considering more ways to plant trees in the public right of way to provide mitigation for urban
heat island impact. He stated that the Five-Year Plan will be updated this year.
Ms. Suzanne Rasmussen spoke about the 2015 Bike Plan (ATTACHMENT D), which is the
starting point for the ordinance. She stated that the Bike Plan will be updated.
Ms. Cara Seiderman stated that the Bike Plan was published in 2015 and the overall vision is for
the City to have a Street Network that accommodates cycling as a mode of transportation for
those of all ages and ability. She added that there are many other elements needed to support
Packet Pg. 151

2.5

cycling in the Bike Plan, including bike parking, expanding the Bluebikes program and cycling
classes. The Bike Plan is available online. She noted that the data is continually being reviewed
to analyze volume, crashes and determine when more immediate action is needed. She explained
the importance of bike comfort and safety for cyclists. Examples were provided to explain the
bicycle level of comfort. There was map outlining the bicycle level of comfort. She spoke about
what a separated bike lane would look like and that there are many ways to create a separated
bike lane. The existing and planned network were reviewed with the major destinations and a
network of streets that connected the major destinations together with a comfort level of the
streets to determine what the best locations for separated bike lanes. She stated that the
ordinance focuses on the purple on the map which are the more major street corridors. She
stated that the full network contains all the elements. She stated that there will be a technical
update in the revised Bike Plan and adding items to the toolbox and adding Vision Zero into the
Bike Plan. There will be a feasibility assessment to add new sections to the Bike Plan update
and an implementation plan. This will take about 18 months with a robust community process.
Ms. Rasmussen stated that there are exemptions in the ordinance. She spoke about physical
features of the street that would prevent a protected bike facility to be installed, the usage of
street and the financial constraints.
Councillor Toomey noted that the cycling safety ordinance does not include mandatory helmet
requirements and proper lights on bikes at night. He questioned why was this omitted. Ms.
Seiderman responded that there is a state and City law requiring lights at night. The City
provides lights for free at all City events and advocacy groups help install lights on bikes.
Bluebikes have built in lights. State law mandates the use of helmets for those 16 years of age
and under. She added that these facilities are safer because they prevent crashes and a helmet
will not prevent a crash. She stated that this is to prevent crashes from happening at all.
Councillor Toomey stated that he wanted the Police Department to provide information on how
many citations were issued for bikes without lights at night.
Councillor Kelley stated that more can be done than this ordinance. He expressed concern with
the exceptions regarding physical features of the street, usage of the street and financial
constraints. He stated that the ordinance seems constrained. He doesn’t want the ordinance to
make things worse for cyclists creating unsafe conditions. He asked if the City has the authority
not to follow this ordinance from a financial implication that would make it worse for cyclists.
Ms. Rasmussen stated that if the City Manager determined that this was not feasible it would be
documented in a public report explaining why this was detrimental from the usage of the street
perspective. Councillor Kelley stated that in 12.22.040 (B) he wanted to know that there is
discretion for safety in the ordinance. Ms. Rasmussen stated that safety is paramount in all City
street designs.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked if this will be part of the upcoming 18-month study to look at where
these three exceptions can arise. Ms. Rasmussen stated that this is intended to last into the
future. Ms. Seiderman stated physical features are easier to identify and less likely to change.
She spoke about looking at the corridors and looking at the barriers. Mr. Feigenbaum stated that
the compromise was to keep the exceptions definition open ended to give the City Manager
adequate discretion when needed. She added that the rare circumstances language is to keep the
exception truly a rarity and not becoming a standard operating procedure. Mr. Durbin stated that
this was to tie the Cambridge Bike Plan and the Five-Year Construction Plan together.

Councillor Zondervan stated that Hampshire Street’s vision plan included separated bike lanes,
but they could not be installed without removing significant amounts of car storage. He asked if
Hampshire Street were updated under the ordinance would separate bike lanes be installed. Ms.
Rasmussen stated that these decisions are not being made now. She stated that in the future the
demand for parking will decrease because of the use of autonomous vehicles that do not need to
park along the street. She added that this is about looking at the network and connecting all the
destinations and this has been the process to lay out the network. Councillor Zondervan
commented that if the ordinance is in place the decision to add protected bike lanes on
Hampshire Street will be made when the street is up for reconstruction. Ms. Rasmussen stated
that the determination will be made at the time when the street is up for reconstruction.
Councillor Mallon compared the Bike Plan, the Five-Year Construction Plan and the bike
network with key destinations and stated that it was helpful to see them all together. There is
another map with what the existing network looks like. The Bike Plan will look at technical
analysis and in 2020 when the Bike Plan is updated there will be an updated network plan that
will take the place of the existing one. Ms. Seiderman stated that some of the things are in place
now. Councillor Mallon asked will any construction for 2019-2020 have bike lanes. Mr. Barr
stated that on the non-capital side there is intention to pursue the quick build strategy for bike
lanes that will be used outside of the context of this ordinance and the Five-Year Plan.
Councillor Mallon stated there are still quick builds planned before the Bike Plan is updated.
Mr. Barr responded in the affirmative and the 5 Year Plan is the ultimate way to get this done.
Mr. Feigenbaum stated that Cambridge Bike Safety sees this ordinance as a long-term plan.
Councillor Mallon stated that she is happy to support the ordinance and the plans until the Bike
Plan is updated.
Councillor Siddiqui asked for a point of clarification regarding the financial constraints and for
this be explained. Ms. Rasmussen stated there are situations where it would be beyond typical
reconstruction costs. She explained that if it were physically impossible to widen a street to
install a separated facility, or it would require the City to take private land by eminent domain,
which would be too costly are examples of such constraints. Councillor Siddiqui asked if the
feasibility study would look at this. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the feasibility will be looking at
this.
Mayor McGovern noted that this has taken collaboration on both sides. He stated that the
exceptions are there because the City needs the exceptions. He stated that this is an ordinance
about infrastructure. He stated that cyclists and motorists do not always follow the rules, and this
is a behavioral issue. This is a commitment to build out the network.
Councillor Carlone opened public comment at 6: 45 PM.
George Schneelock, 81 School Street, Somerville, stated that Allison Donovan died in
Somerville. He asked for faster implementation of Vision Zero measures in Somerville. He
stated that signatures were submitted to Somerville and the next day Paula Shraga died in
Boston. This fatality pushed Boston to bring up safety issues. He stated that safety issues should
be addressed and not require advocacy. He supported the ordinance and rapid implementation is
needed to build the separate lanes. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT E).
Mark Boswell, 105 Walden Street, spoke about supporting the ordinance as effective motivation
to build out the network and would stand along with the Vehicle Trip Ordinance and ADA
compliance. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).

2.5

Randy Stern, 12 Kenwood Street, member of the Cambridge Bike Committee, stated he strongly
supported the ordinance. This will empower the City staff around bike infrastructure and noted
that every implementation is a tradeoff and facilities will be built. He stated that if this ordinance
were in place there would be protected bike lanes on Huron Avenue.
Kimberly Hunt, 10 Wendell Street, stated her support for the ordinance for permanent protected
bike lanes. She explained why she bikes. She stated that she is disabled and has cerebral palsy
and has difficulty walking. She relies on public transit and her bike to get around. She stated
that for her cycling is the best way to get around and allows her freedom. She stated that her
commute along a protected route is the best part of her day. She spoke about her boyfriend who
does not bike because of his fear of getting hit by a car. This ordinance will provide mobility
and protected bike lanes will increase biking. She stated that protected bike lanes are the
solution to get people out of their cars. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G).
Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, 19 Trowbridge Street, stated that he is in favor of the ordinance. He
spoke about the high cost of bike lights and helmets. He stated that issuing citations will not
increase light and helmet use and will increase costs for low income residents, the majority of
whom are black and brown residents. He spoke of an accident he had on his bike on Mt. Auburn
Street. He stated that the 2014 plan had protected bike lanes for Mt. Auburn Street but has not
occurred. He stated that adding protected bike lanes on Mt. Auburn Street will be an
improvement. He spoke about multiple deaths for cyclists. He submitted his comments
(ATTACHMENT H).
Gavin Lund, 166 Charles Street, stated his support for the ordinance and is encouraged by the
dialogue. He appreciates the comments made by Mayor McGovern regarding behavior versus
infrastructure.
Annie Tuan, 129 Franklin Street, stated that she is in favor of the cycling safety ordinance. She
shared a story of someone who does not bike. The woman will not ride a bike on City streets
because it is too scary. She added that building protected bike lanes will allow her friend to bike.
Yurok Loke, 18 Lawrence Street, Medford stated that he bikes to Cambridge every day where he
works. He stated that about 8 months ago he had an accident with an 18-wheeler and spent time
in the hospital. He spoke about the recent fatal death in Somerville. He noted that trucks in the
Boston area killed 8-13 cyclists over the last five years. He urged adding off road bike paths and
for the city to be creative. He spoke about maintaining off road bike paths.
Eric Garnick, 6C Chester Street, stated that he has been cycling in Cambridge since 1970 and
acknowledged the improvements. He stated that horseback riding is more dangerous than
cycling. He stated that perception is a significant aspect of the issue. He spoke about the
speeding on a one-lane side street, Orchid Street.
Ted Feldman, 48 Gorham Street, Somerville, stated that he is a member of the Somerville
Bicycle Advisory Committee. He stated that this is a good first step in the right direction for
safety infrastructure. This is an environmental and equity issues. He stated that data shows that
installing protected bike lanes reduces the stress of riders. He spoke about working with
Somerville on improvements to Webster Avenue, which unfortunately is not part of the street
improvement plan for Cambridge. He asked Cambridge to reconsider improvements to the
Cambridge portion of Webster Avenue. The plan needs to be expanded and the data analyzed.
Packet Pg. 154

2.5

Itamar Turner-Turing, 130 Oxford Street, supported the ordinance and stated that the key issue is
implementation. He stated that motorists will need more time to find parking and be upset about
the bike lanes. He stated that biking is a low-income transportation and one year of biking is
about what a motorist spends on their car for a month.
Janie Katz-Christie, 166A Elm Street, runs Green Streets Initiative, a multi-modal monthly day
of awareness about health and sustainable ways to get around. She stated that there are 4,000 5,000 participants per year. She stated that her organization promotes all types of car-light
transportation. She stated that she goes out of her way to travel on protective bike lanes. She
stated that cyclists have a right to be in the “lane”. The law has not been clarified as to who
belongs in the lane. It is unfair to be killed riding a bike.
Becca Wolfson, Director, Boston Cyclist Union, 114 School Street, Somerville stated that she
bikes from Somerville to Roxbury every day. She stated that this ordinance will be a great step
forward. She stated that no one wishes there were more cars on the road. She applauded the
work and stated that this could unlock more resources and provide efficiency in City
government. She wanted the implementation of the ordinance paired with proper maintenance
and robust counting data. She added a connected network is important and wanted streets added
in as soon as possible in the network.
Nate Fillmore, 13 Marcella Street, applauded the work of all the City Council, City Manager and
the City staff that have worked on this.
Ann Dinoto, Arlington stated that she has ridden her bike for 15 years but stopped after seeing
three bike fatalities. She stated that the she is afraid to leave her house because of the fatalities
that she has witnessed and for fear for her safety.
At 7:21 PM Councillor Carlone closed public hearing.
Mayor McGovern wanted to move this forward with a favorable recommendation
Vice Mayor Devereux agreed and thanked all who worked on this. She stated that this is a longterm plan and marks a landmark of shifting attitude and having more protected facilities the
momentum will grow. Cambridge is known for seeing the world differently and seeing
inequities and trying to address them.
Councillor Zondervan supported the ordinance passage and implementation.
Councillor Siddiqui commended the Vice Mayor Devereux for her advocacy on this.
Councillor Kelley supports this but wanted a more discussion on safety for biking. He looks
forward to being part of the discussion.
Councillor Carlone stated that this is a basic part of urban design and he wanted planted medians
instead of stripped asphalt areas separating cars from bikes. He thanked all who worked on this.
At this time Mayor McGovern moved that this be forwarded to the full City Council with a
favorable recommendation. The motion carried on vote of six members.

FIRST PUBLICATION NO. 3487

In the Year Two Thousand Nineteen
AN ORDINANCE
In amendment to the Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge

Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Cambridge as follows:
That the Municipal Code of the City of Cambridge be amended by adding in Title Twelve entitled
“Streets, Sidewalks and Public Places” a new Chapter 12.22 entitled “Cycling Safety Ordinance,” which
reads as follows:

Chapter 12.22

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Section 12.22.010

Short Title

This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.
Section 12.22.020

Purpose

This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the City's Vision
Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected network of permanent
separated bicycle lanes across the City.
Section 12.22.030

Definitions

A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or lanes
that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle lane or
lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in both
directions.

B. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the city.

C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future”.

D. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City of
Cambridge Department of Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be
amended from time to time.

Attachment: 190318.Cycling Safety passed to second reading - First Pub. 3487 (CRT 2019 #19 : Cycling Safety Ordinance)


Packet Pg. 243

E. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction of
an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion,
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection.
Improvements shall not include routine maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or
emergency repairs to the surface of a roadway (collectively
“Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to existing conditions or
better.
F. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short stretches
to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking, intersections, and public
transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be temporarily removed
during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are restored to existing
conditions or better.
G. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any
such plan shall maintain Connectivity.
Section 12.22.040

Requirements

A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the City’s Five-Year
Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such
Improvements to comply with the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided,
that if Improvements are made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated
Bicycle Lane with Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment.

B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City Manager
can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is impractical to
comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss of Connectivity
if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could be otherwise
advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above will be
considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager determines that
the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial constraints of full
compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with Adequate
Directionality.
In City Council March 18, 2019.
Passed to a second reading and on or after
April 8, 2019 the question comes on passing
to be ordained.

Cambridge, MA. 02139
In re: 14 Jackson Street Modification of Existing 35’ Curb Cut

The existing property at 14 Jackson shares a curb cut with 18 Jackson Street (the two properties
were owned commonly at one time). The existing curb cut is 35’ wide. We met with Liza Paden,
the community development director prior to requesting a Special Permit regarding the rear
home location. She asked us to create separation by reducing the rather lengthy curb cut.
Zoning Ordinance 6.43.3 states that “Curb cuts shall be maximum 20 feet wide in Residential
districts.” The proposed curb cut modification will conforms to the current zoning ordinance.
In order to reduce the large opening of approximately 35’, we are proposing the addition of a 5’
section of curb at the property edge between 14 and 18 Jackson It will be solely inside the 14
Jackson St. property line and will not reduce the existing curb cut for 18 Jackson St.
We are also asking to move the current curbstone for 14 Jackson St. 2’ to the left. The new curb
cut for 14 Jackson will be 15’. This is consistent with what is typical of many lots on the street.
The owner of 18 Jackson Street reviewed the proposed plan, discussed it with me and signed a
form approving of the curb cut modification.
We have approval letters from the owners of the homes on either side of us, four homes across
the street from us and also the home in back of us (13 Clifton St.).
Diana Schneidman, the owner of 10 Jackson Street has signed the approval modification form.
Dana Zircher is listed as the owner of 8 Jackson Street. I hand delivered a letter explaining the
curb cut modification that included my telephone number and an approval form. The property
has a for sale sign and according to Diana Schneidman, nobody is living there. The mailbox was
full when I delivered the letter.

North Cambridge Stabilization Committee
11 Brookford St
Cambridge, MA 02140
Dear Sirs;
We are the owners of 28 Jackson Street, and are writing to offer our strong support of Mr.
Matteosian’s request to modify the existing curb cut at 14 Jackson Street and adding a
curb to separate the driveway of 14 Jackson Street from 18 Jackson Street.
Our home is 2 doors down from this property and we have been living here for more than
10 years. We find the proposed changes to the curb, as well as Mr. Matteosian’s proposed
design for the site, to be a substantial improvement and in keeping with the character of
the neighborhood. Since Mr. Matteosian purchased the property, he has been very
responsive, approachable, and engaged in keeping the abutters to 14 Jackson St informed
of his intentions to improve the property. We have no concerns about this change.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at 617-229-7568 if you have any questions.
Sincerely yours,

Jason Stonehouse

Cycling Safety Ordinance

I’m writing to express my enthusiastic support for the Cycling Safety Ordinance that you’re preently considering. As
a year-round bicycle commuter from East Arlington to downtown Boston, I spend many hours every year on my
bike, on Cambridge’s roads. Outside of my own interests, it seems clear that the benefits of bicycle travel—
decreased carbon emissions, a healthier population, better traffic flow—make it every city government’s
responsibility to reduce motor vehicle use.
I want to express my thanks to Mayor McGovern, Vice Mayor Devereux, and Councillors Carlone, Mallon, Siddiqui,
and Zondervan, and City Manager DePasquale for their recognition of this responsibility. I urge you all to finish the
job and pass the Cycling Safety Ordinance.
Thanks again,
Ben Di Maggio

Updated public comments

To quote former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman, "We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against
the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then
criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities." Thank you for taking steps to undo this by giving
priority to those who have been hurt by the war on drugs for the cannabis economy.
I cannot support the limitation of donations to in state donors. I'm running for city council and it would have been
impossible to get my campaign of the ground without donations from my friends and family, who mostly live out of the
state. I'd support this if we had public funding for everyone. (Clarification, I do support spending limits).
I'm disappointed by the City Manager's report that there are adequate trash cans in the Port. Sure, there are trashcans
in the parks, but what about the streets? Hampshire Street is covered in trash because you can walk two blocks and not
find a single one. It's a particular problem with trash from the 7-11 in Inman Square going towards Kendal.
I don't see a plan for watering the trees they want to plant. Again, I'll be disappointed but not surprised if there are 27
dead trees by the end of the year.
I'd like to see more analysis on the housing overlay. The details keep changing but nothing is presented on how these
changes will affect our goals. How do we know that 30% open space will make projects not financially feasible? I keep on
hearing, "something is better than nothing," or, "don't get perfect get in the way of good." I say make sure we're not
causing more harm then good. In engineering, the simplest solution is often the worst, and I've found many engineering
principles to be true elsewhere in my life.

top goal of the City Council; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council is considering a zoning overlay that could make it easier to develop
100% affordable housing projects citywide; and

The goals of the proposed zoning overlay are commendable, and more information is
needed to fully inform the Council and members of the public on the potential
implications of adopting such a zoning overlay; and

WHEREAS:

Information is needed on the financial implications of the proposed zoning overlay,
including (but not limited to) a detailed analysis of potential 100% affordable housing
projects where affordable developers were outbid in the market and how an overlay
might have given affordable developers a better chance of success, as well as any other
expected per-unit cost reductions from the overlay approach; and

WHEREAS:

Information is needed on the implications of the proposal on the City’s housing stock,
including (but not limited to) demolition of existing homes and potential displacement
of their tenants (expected numbers per year), and the net number of affordable units
and types (unit size and mix and FAR comparisons to existing zoning) of projects that
will be created under the overlay per year; and

WHEREAS:

Information is needed on the urban design guidelines/form-based zoning for the
proposal, including (but not limited to) potential building massing and heights that
would be allowed, examples of representative building and site designs under the

relation to surrounding structures would be, by zoning district; and

WHEREAS:

Information is needed on what changes the overlay would allow in designated historic
and neighborhood conservation districts; and

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

At the October 18, 2018 meeting of the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning
Committee, a motion was passed requesting that the City Manager work with the
Department of Public Works and the Department of Conservation and Recreation to
“monitor the site and area surrounding Jerry’s Pond, ensuring that frequent trash
removal and other such measures are taken to maintain a clean and inviting area”; and

WHEREAS:

The motion also requested that the City Manager work with “other city and state
agencies as necessary to improve the surrounding publicly owned properties through
landscape design and other measures” with the intention of making them “more
accessible and inviting to the community”; and

WHEREAS:

Rindge Avenue area residents have since complained of a lack of sufficient waste
receptacles in the area generally, and urged that the Department of Public Works
replace the outdated, blue bins with newer, “big belly” bins, such as those replaced on
Huron Avenue; and

WHEREAS:

The Department of Public Works has been attentive to these concerns, having recently
installed new trash receptacles around Comeau Field; and

WHEREAS:

More recently, residents reported concern over excessive dumping of domestic rubbish
in the existing public waste bins, specifically near Comeau Field’s 83 Bus Shelter [see
attached Photos 1 and 2], and disturbing levels of rodent activity in the surrounding
parking lots and children’s play area; and

WHEREAS:

The Department of Public Works has added the Rindge Avenue and Comeau Park area
to its nightly cleanup route, it remains unclear whether installing “big belly”
receptacles--such as those implemented around Comeau Field [see attached Photo 3]-at the 83 Bus Shelter would serve to mitigate the issue of domestic waste dumping,
different options exist that may more effectively address; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of
Public Works to investigate:
1. Additional options for effectively addressing the excessive rubbish issue at the
83 Bus Shelter and surrounding Rindge Avenue/Comeau Field area, including
the inappropriate disposal of domestic waste; and
2. Appropriate solutions to the public and environmental health and safety issues
of inadequate trash and recycling disposal and persistent rodent activity in the
Rindge Avenue area; and be it further

WHEREAS:

In 2009, Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to adopt an above-code
appendix to the “base code” for building energy requirements, commonly referred to as
the “stretch code”; and

WHEREAS:

The “stretch code”, which municipalities may optionally choose to adopt, is designed
to result in cost-effective construction that is more energy efficient than that which is
built to the mandatory “base code” standards; and

WHEREAS:

Requirements in the “stretch code” were considerably stronger than those in the “base
code” when first adopted, but the “base code” has caught up over time as the “stretch
code” has not changed significantly; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts Board of Building Regulation and Standards (BBRS) will vote on
adjustments to the “base code” this year, and the board has an opportunity to
significantly improve the “stretch code” as part of that process to include Net Zero
building construction, something many municipalities are already experimenting with,
including Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

The Net Zero Action Plan adopted by the Cambridge City Council in 2015 is an
important component of our Climate Action Plan, since building energy use is
responsible for the vast majority of our emissions that cause climate change; and

WHEREAS:

While Cambridge has been able to voluntarily construct net zero buildings, and some
private developers have been experimenting with net zero concepts, imposing net zero
requirements as outlined in the Net Zero Action Plan will be made much simpler if the
state adopts a net zero stretch energy code that Cambridge could subsequently adopt;
and

WHEREAS:

H.2865, “An Act to Establish a Net Zero Energy Stretch Code”, would establish a net
zero energy stretch code through the legislature; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record in urging the BBRS to update the “stretch code” to
require net zero building construction; and be it further

Subject:

Accessory Dwelling Unit Substitution Language

Dear Councilors,
Attached, please find my suggested substitution to the Accessory Dwelling Unit
amendment to be considered at tomorrow’s Ordinance Committee meeting. This language
reflects many of the concerns raised at last week’s Planning Board meeting as well as at our
previous Ordinance Committee meeting. I have included both a marked up version that compares
the suggested substitute amendment to the current CZO’s ADU language and an unmarked
proposed substitute. This zoning amendment is a narrow attempt to correct specific mistakes in
previously adopted zoning and allow property owners to build accessory dwelling units without
the current need for variances as they reflect lot size, parking and so forth. It is not an attempt to
correct larger inconsistencies within our zoning code, something I feel would be an important
discussion to have outside of any particular zoning amendment.
I look forward to discussing these proposed zoning changes tomorrow afternoon.
Thank you,

prohibited in most cases due to the existingnon-conformities related to floor area ratio, and/or lot area per
dwelling unit requirements of Subsection 5.31 or other zoning constraints. Given contemporary life styles,
housing needs and energy and maintenance costs, it is beneficial to the City to allow greater flexibility in the use
of such dwellings properties without substantially altering the environmental quality of such existing residential
districts. This Subsection 4.22 gives the Board of Zoning appeal the authority to relax such requirementsgrant a
special permit for accessory dwelling units in certain instances as enumerated below.

4.22.1 In all districts the Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit for alteration of a single family or
two-family home or an accessory structure , detached dwelling to provide one accessory apartment per lot if the
following conditions are met:
1. The dwelling has not been substantially enlarged since built. The addition in the aggregate of two hundred
and fifty (250) square feet or more of gross floor area shall be considered a substantial enlargement.
2. Prior to alteration the dwelling contains at least one thousand eight hundred (1,800) square feet of gross
floor area.
3. The lot on which such accessory apartment is located contains at least five thousand (5,000) square feet of
lot.
4. Such accessory apartment shall not occupy more than nine hundred (900) square feet or thirty-five (35)
percent of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is less., and shall not be located in a garage.
5. The owner(s) of the residence in which the accessory dwelling unit is created must continue to occupy at
least one of the dwelling units as their primary residence. Prior to issuance of a building permit, the owner(s)
must submit a notarized letter stating that the owner will occupy one of the dwelling units on the premises as
the owner’s primary residence.
6. Any existing two-family home may be converted to a single familysingle-family home with accessory unit by
right, without need for a Special Permit. In granting a special permit the Board may impose such conditions,
including requirements for off street parking and limitations on other accessory uses of the premises, as it may
deem appropriate to avoid detriment to the neighborhood or to nearby persons or property. The Board of
Zoning Appeal shall evaluate each special permit application which involves exterior changes with the
appearance of and character of the neighborhood and may require that there be no change or minimal change
to any face of a building oriented toward a public way or visible from a public way.
