Achieving racial equity
requires proactive and
continuous investment
in communities of
color, who have
endured centuries of
systemic oppression.
CPS is committed to
dismantling structures
rooted in white
privilege, to hearing
and elevating
underrepresented
voices, and recognizing
and eliminating bias.

CPS Definitions of Equity
and Racial Equity
Equity means that each student, regardless
of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender
identity, disability, sexual orientation,
religion, or socioeconomic status will have
access to the opportunities, resources,
and support they need to attain their
full potential.
Racial equity means the absence of
institutional and structural barriers
experienced by people based on race or
color, that impede access, opportunities,
and results.

Budget Assumptions
for
School Year 2021-22
● CPS will operate a predominantly in-person learning model,
with most to all students in-person full-time.
○ There may be a limited remote option for some students.
● There will be COVID-associated costs next year (e.g. ongoing
infection control management).
● Things may change given public health conditions.

Packet Pg. 18

Budget Resource Conversations
How should CPS use its resources to
● understand academic and social-emotional/mental health
needs following the COVID-19 pandemic and
● provide students with individualized support to accelerate
recovery, progress, and success
What’s the problem to solve or opportunity to
pursue?

What’s the use of resources to address it?

FY 21 Example: Increase underrepresented
students’ college matriculation rates.

Invest in CRLS early college/dual enrollment
program expansion.
