COUNCILLOR AZEEM
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

Some residents in Cambridge drive and benefit from off-street parking spaces; not
every resident, however, drives a car, and so the City should not require, but still allow,
homes to have off-street parking spaces; and

WHEREAS:

Parking minimums can force homeowners and residential & commerical developers to
accommodate space for more parking than they deem necessary, leading to higher
project costs and a decrease in the number of units or amount of open space; and

ORDERED:

That section 6.36 entitled, Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements, of Article
6.000, entitled OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS AND
NIGHTTIME CURFEW ON LARGE COMMERCIAL THROUGH TRUCKS, of the
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge, be amended by substitution with the
language attached.
