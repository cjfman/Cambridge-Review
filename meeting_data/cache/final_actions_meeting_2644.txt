June 8, 2020
To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing to update you on the City’s efforts to respond to the restaurant community’s need to
expand outdoor dining services in response to Governor Baker’s announcement that restaurants
will be permitted to provide outdoor dining services at the commencement of Phase II of the
Commonwealth’s Reopening Plan; and to request that the City Council vote to temporarily
authorize me or my designee to issue all permits for temporary street obstructions, including
Sidewalk Business Use Permits to restaurants that seek to operate outdoor dining on the sidewalk
from this date until November 30, 2020 without prior City Council authorization, as explained
below.
The City has established a new streamlined process that will allow a restaurant to file a single
application through the City’s online licensing and permitting system to obtain all necessary
approvals for operating outdoor dining services. The single application will be reviewed by all
necessary City Departments simultaneously and will result in an expedited review and approval
process. The application will be used for restaurants seeking initial approval to operate outdoor
dining services, and for restaurants seeking to expand their existing outdoor dining services. The
application will be used for outdoor dining services on both private and public property, and for
restaurants that have a permit to sell alcohol with food in their outdoor dining patio if they are
using the City’s sidewalk to do so. Finally, the application will allow restaurants to apply to
expand their outdoor patio dining area to other parts of the public way, beyond the sidewalk, if
approved by all of the permitting departments as well as the City Manager. After a complete
application is filed and all necessary City Departments have reviewed and approved applications,
there will be a final approval from the Board of License Commissioners (the “Board”), and
issuance of a Temporary Outdoor Extension License and Temporary Street/Sidewalk Alcohol
Extension License.
This streamlined and expedited procedure for such temporary approvals is authorized by
Governor Baker’s June 1, 2020 Order Clarifying the Progression of the Commonwealth’s Phased

Packet Pg. 101

2.7

Workplace Re-Opening Plan and Authorizing Certain Re-Opening Preparations at Phase II
Workplaces (the “Order”). The Order temporarily waives some of the time-consuming
procedural requirements for restaurants that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for onpremises consumption that are applying to operate outdoor dining services and waives the
requirement that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission approve such requests. The Order
also waives zoning requirements that may prohibit outdoor dining services. Any approval for
outdoor dining services issued pursuant to the Order is in effect only until November 30, 2020. I
note that there is also legislation pending (House No. 4774) that was passed by the House of
Representatives on June 3, 2020, as amended, that if passed by the Senate and signed into law
would address some of the same issues addressed by the Order, and depending on whether the
Senate passes any amendments, may alter some of the requirements in the Order. We are
carefully following this pending legislation and will revise the City’s procedures if necessary.
Additionally, the City will be expanding its policy of allowing outdoor dining services on the
public sidewalk and will also allow outdoor dining services in existing parking areas and other
portions of the public way. The new application procedure set forth above will allow an
applicant to request the use of a parking area or the public way for outdoor dining services,
subject to the approval of the Department of Public Works, the Traffic, Parking and
Transportation Department, the License Commission and City Manager.
Finally, presently the City requires that restaurants that seek to operate outdoor dining on the
sidewalk obtain a Sidewalk Business Use Permit, after permission to grant such approval is
issued by the City Council. In order to expedite this process, and to address the anticipated
increased demand, I am hereby requesting that the City Council expand its prior authorization for
me or my designee to grant such approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for
temporary street obstructions, from this date until November 30, 2020. In 1997 the City Council
adopted a standing order authorizing the City Manager to act on such requests after the final City
Council meeting in June and prior to the first September meeting of the City Council. The
proposed order expanding the time frame for that approval process would allow approval for a
restaurant to use the sidewalk to be incorporated into the streamlined procedure set forth above,
and not require a separate application and approval process.
I look forwards to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.
Very truly yours,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN

VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX
WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate
crisis; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero
emissions no later than 2050; and

WHEREAS:

In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and

WHEREAS:

All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating,
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor,
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no
later than the end of October.

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Section 12.22.010

Short Title

This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.
Purpose

This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City.
Section 12.22.030

Definitions

A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in
both directions.
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility,
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles.
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City.
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time.
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion,
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to
existing conditions or better.
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading,
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are
restored to existing conditions or better.

Packet Pg. 112

3.2.a

I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round,
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible
loading, intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle
lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better.
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane.
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any
such plan shall maintain Connectivity.
Section 12.22.040

Requirements

A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment.
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane
with Adequate Directionality.
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along:

H. “Public Transportation” shall mean bus and shuttle stops for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council.

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or
(b) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of

D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a),
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided,
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has
commenced prior to December 31, 2025.
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-byblock analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:

(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that QuickBuild Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection
C.

Attachment: 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025.

On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle
Lane of Adequate Directionality along
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;

Packet Pg. 114

3.2.a

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis.
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment.
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound,
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year.
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however,
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered:
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.”
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of
the City Council. However, the Council Order further ordered:
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.”
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and
accompanying bill to the Legislature. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Please find attached an order requesting the appropriation and authorization to borrow $237,000,000 to
provide funds for the design and construction of the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper School.
Construction includes the commencement of demolition and remediation of the existing building and
open space.
This order is being submitted for the May 18, 2020 City Council meeting to allow the City Council to
vote on this order on June 15, 2020 which is the projected date for City Council adoption of the FY21

Needed: Better communication for local response to Covid-19
As we push to reopen businesses and schools, leaders are talking about hygiene, distancing,
screening, and masks -- the four tools that have kept health-care workers safe. These tools can
work, says Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, but he warns that “it’s
worrying how little officials are discussing what it takes to deliver them as a whole package.”
There is a fifth element to success, says Dr. Gawande, “culture. It’s one thing to know what we
should be doing; it’s another to do it, rigorously and thoroughly.”
We know we can count on zero leadership this year from Washington toward these practices and
culture. At the state level, Governor Baker is helping by promoting testing, contact tracing, and guidance
for distancing and masking. But it is mainly up to local leadership to persuade people to follow public
health guidance rigorously and thoroughly.
Cambridge has been doing this through mailings, email and web updates, phone messages, signs, cable
TV Q&A sessions with the Mayor and City Manager, and loud speakers on sound trucks. Uniformed
police officers have promoted the use of face coverings by distributing thousands of masks.
New strategies are needed to promote consistent use of all the tools necessary for safety. These
strategies will have to work on a continuing basis for months if not years. By comparison, the message
for the initial lockdown was simple, “stay inside and don’t get near to anyone if you can avoid it.” The
challenge now is to persuade as many people as possible to follow a demanding package of new
practices until a reliable cure or vaccine for the coronavirus becomes widely available.
These practices can’t be imposed in the same way as public closures and the masking order, which are
already meeting resistance. In workplaces and schools handwashing, distancing, monitoring for
symptoms, and self-isolating can be required. It’s up to government to promote the same practices in
homes and public spaces. These efforts will reinforce each other. And it will be much easier for people
to follow a consistent set of practices that don’t shift from one situation or place to another.
The City can do much more to promote the culture of Covid-19 safety we need. Here are three specific
proposals that can be rapidly implemented.
First, bring the campaign to as many people as possible and engage the public in streets and squares
with 60 to 100 large-screen television displays in windows of public buildings and stores at strategic
locations broadcasting public health videos, such as from the Centers for Disease Control, current local
guidance, bulletins, and alerts in a short, visually appealing loop. The goal would be to reach everyone
who lives in or visits Cambridge, including young children, who can be key influencers, people who are
not on the internet, and newcomers who will arrive in large numbers as businesses and universities reopen. The displays would also remind everyone to keep up the four basic practices.

Attachment: John Pitkin_OP-ED on communication JPitkin 0529 (COM 302 #2020 : A communication was received from John Pitkin)

5.1.b

Packet Pg. 197

Unlike printed signs, the content of the displays can be continually updated as guidance changes and
there is new information about local cases, testing, prevention, treatment, and care. Everyone needs to
have the same information and guidance. All the time.
Second, support independent reporting on local impacts and responses to Covid-19 by placing regular
public health notices in local newspapers including the Cambridge Chronicle and Cambridge Day. Paid
advertisements could include the text of the City’s bulletins and news releases as well as reminders of
current guidance. They would reach off-line audiences including many elderly and at the same time
support independent reporting on responses to Covid-19. Local stories and reporting are essential
ingredients for creating a new culture of vigilance and response.
Third, lead with medical and health expertise by organizing regular public briefings and Q&A sessions by
the Commissioner of Public Health, medical experts, and scientists. Greater transparency and metrics
will build public trust and confidence. Town halls with the City Manager, an administrator with a
background in finance, and Mayor, a political leader, do not have this effect. The public is hungry for
current, scientific information about the pandemic. (When Broad Institute CEO Eric Lander held an
informal Q&A session by Zoom recently, over 250 local residents participated.)
There would be costs to implementing these measures. It is reasonable to ask if the City can afford them
as it spends more in other areas to respond to the pandemic. Better communications are urgently
needed to foster and sustain the new culture that says “I might be contagious and don’t want to be the
one who infects someone else.” It will help contain the coronavirus, save lives, and improve health and
our economy. It will be money well spent.

June 4, 2020

We are a coalition of Cambridge residents, those who work or own businesses in Cambridge,
and members of Cambridge Bike Safety.
We are deeply concerned that the City has not done enough to ensure residents’ safety when
conducting essential travel during the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of safe pedestrian,
cycling, and transit options for essential travel has exacerbated the current public health crisis,
as well as the economic crisis that Cambridge local businesses are currently facing. Nearly 30%
of Cambridge residents are without a car, and now have no way to safely get to their local
businesses while ensuring appropriate physical distance from others.
In the last two weeks, well over 1000 of us have signed a petition asking the city to take
immediate and comprehensive action to enable safe essential travel and to support local
businesses. The petition requests that the City take five specific actions:
1) Create a continuous citywide network of widened sidewalks on busy streets by adding
signage and barriers that allow people to walk safely in the street while maintaining
physical distance from others.
2) Implement Neighborhood Slow Streets in areas where widening sidewalks isn’t
possible, so that people can walk or bike safely through their neighborhoods to local
business districts.
3) Request that DCR widen sidewalks and bike paths on Memorial Drive by blocking off
two lanes for people to use for walking and biking for essential travel, while leaving two
lanes for motor vehicles.
4) Complete the 20-mile citywide network of protected bike lanes that promotes safe travel
by bike for people of all ages and abilities.
5) Help the MBTA to quickly implement changes to improve and continue access while
enabling social distancing (e.g., more frequent and longer bus service, and creating
priority bus lanes), and to make significant investments now for the long-term.
We are pleased, therefore, that the City has announced that its Shared Streets pilot will start in
mid-June and that the City Manager and City Staff have worked with City Councilors and
community members to prepare an amendment to the Cycling Safety Ordinance currently on
the table that accounts for the coronavirus pandemic and will allow the Cycling Safety
Ordinance to move through the legislative process with the joint support of the City and
Cambridge Bike Safety.

Attachment: Caroline Shannon_petition6.4b (COM 303 #2020 : A communication was received from Caroline Shannon)

Dear City Council:

Packet Pg. 199

5.2.a

We ask that the Council ensure that the Shared Streets pilot expands substantially beyond its
current scope, so that it creates a network that reaches all neighborhoods in the city; that the
Council and Manager advocate to DCR for a 24/7 shutdown of two lanes on Memorial Drive for
those who walk or bike for essential travel; and that the Cycling Safety Ordinance be passed
into law as soon as possible.
This is a critical moment. Cambridge has made great progress over the past years to enable
everyone to get around the city safely and equitably. If we do not, however, move much more
aggressively than we have to date during the coronavirus pandemic, we risk squandering this
progress.
Thanks for your support.

Petition to Enable Social Distancing on Cambridge Streets
This petition was developed by a coalition of Cambridge residents, local business workers
and owners, and members of Cambridge Bike Safety.

Background
Over the past several weeks, Cambridge residents and essential workers have had to rely
increasingly on walking or biking for essential travel in lieu of public transportation to
minimize exposure to COVID-19. However, Cambridge residents and workers are currently
unable to maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from others when walking on narrow
sidewalks and paths. When they choose to get on a bicycle for essential travel, they
encounter unsafe roadway conditions. Cambridge has completed only 4 of 20 miles of the
planned network of protected bike lanes that would ensure biking is a safe travel option for
people of all ages and abilities. In the last month alone, people on bikes have been killed in
Arlington and Boston due to the lack of protected bike lane infrastructure.
The lack of safe pedestrian, cycling, and transit options for essential travel has
exacerbated the current public health crisis, as well as the economic crisis that Cambridge
local businesses are currently facing. Nearly 30% of Cambridge residents are without a car,
and now have no way to safely get to their local businesses. Sidewalk space will be in even
higher demand as local businesses smartly expand onto sidewalks for queuing, outdoor
dining, and other uses to continue serving the community as safely as possible.
Many cities in the metro Boston area, as well as across the US and the world, are acting
decisively to provide safe routes for people walking and biking, and it is imperative that
Cambridge take action now to protect the health of vulnerable residents and to encourage
support for local businesses. Cambridge must also work with the MBTA to ensure residents

Right now, walking or biking in Cambridge while social
distancing is simply not possible. The sidewalks are not wide
enough. I sometimes just chose to walk down the middle of
street instead, but that is also scary (especially with the cars
driving faster than ever). As we head into a long summer,
Cambridge needs to allow its residents to safely access open
spaces, including their own streets.

Larchwood Drive (and "The Larches" in particular) serves
even in normal times as a thoroughfare for walkers and bikers
from all over Cambridge, Belmont, and elsewhere - now,
during COVID-19, both the number of walkers and bikers has
about tripled. There are, now, only very few cars driving
through, but if they do, often they are extremely fast (driving
fast seems a sign of the times), thus endangering people
considerably. In normal times, people drive through here in
order to avoid the Huron/Freshpond Pkwy traffic light. Since
this is mostly during rush hours, people tend to be extremely
impatient, drive way too fast, and often blow their horns at
bikes and pedestrians. All in all, drive through traffic is a
serious annoyance to many people enjoying their (bike or
foot) commute or daily exercise, and, what is more important,
is endangering those people's lives. Making the car commute
through this street considerably harder (but not impossible),
especially if the street is narrow enough that cars have to pay
more attention, might limit traffic to those cars who are not
just looking to shave of 10 second off their commute. Please
also note that this is one of the few streets that allow free
parking, thus offering people access to Fresh Pond. This is a
good thing, but in present traffic conditions, with cars
whizzing through, the extra parked cars create extra
obstacles that causes the through traffic to swerve and thus
be more of a danger to bikes and pedestrians.

I live quite close to Cambridge and do not own a car.
Whenever I have to go anywhere now, I walk or bike. It is not
possible for me to walk to anywhere while staying 6 feet away
from other walkers and cyclists unless I choose to walk in the
street. The sidewalks are not large enough. It's extremely
frustrating that this is the case when there is so much more
foot traffic and car traffic is so low. The space we allocate to
each makes it seem like the reverse is true. In addition, since
car traffic is so low, cars are traveling faster, increasing the
chance of fatalities in collisions. Slow streets would mean I
wouldn't have to worry about this risk as much. When
businesses open up, fewer people (including myself and my
roommates) are going to want to take public transit out of fear
of catching covid. We need to give people sustainable
alternatives like cycling and walking, rather than dangerous
choics like driving.

With people unlikely to return to full public transit use during
the pandemic, there is a risk that public transit use will be
replaced with driving. This would have a strongly negative
effect on the city due to increased traffic and air pollution (not
to mention moving in the wrong direction towards carbonreduction goals to fight the larger climate change problem).
We need creative alternatives to driving, and shared or
closed streets that can encourage more walking and biking
are a great way to start.

These changes would improve our quality of life, simply.
While the Charles River parklands are the primary outlet from
East Cambridge's dense street grid, a neighborhood slow
streets initiative would do much to improve the comfort and
safety in our immediate neighborhood. The public right of way
directly abutting the residential district is constrained by
competing uses of car storage, street tree planting, and, now,
physically distant outdoor activity. Sandwiched between
bustling Kendall Sq. and the Rt. 28 corridor, this
neighborhood should be able to support universal public
health goals and avoid the out-sized risks presented by fastmoving traffic and narrow sidewalks which compress walkers
too-tightly. This would also provide an opportunity to invest in
our local urban forest in the part of the City with the lowest
canopy coverage. Making this environment more
accommodating to these trees serves to improve local airquality, mitigate heat-island effects, and maintain the integrity
of what remains of our local, Charles River-based
ecosystem.

Our children are currently at-risk in the morning and late

use our street as a cut-through to â€œbeatâ€ surrounding
street lights, and speed through our neighborhood at rush
hour. Our grass has been driven on by these erratic drivers,
drastically reducing our tree lawn/verge and almost taking out
one of our â€œstreetâ€ trees that we paid for to have
planted a few years ago.

More space in cities should be given to pedestrian and cyclist
only use. Widening sidewalks and creating cycling thorough
fares would go a long way towards making safer cities for all.
And as pedestrian zones typically increase land values and
rent costs, would bring in valuable tax dollars to communities
which enact these changes.

I work in Cambridge and bike there from Medford daily under
normal circumstances. It is regularly a terrifying experience,
and any efforts to increase safety would take a lot of stress
out of my life (and quell the worries of my family who often
are nervous about my commuting method).

We need safe space for our children to walk and bike while
parks are closed. As well as more open space for them to run
and play.

The single greatest challenge in our society is climate
change. The horrendous situation of Covid forces us to make
change now to both address safe distancing and address
climate change. There are countless cities stepping up London as one example, here:
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52689372
Our city should be a worldwide example.

Makes it easier to travel to/from & pick up food from
restaurants in Cambridge.
Making our streets and sidewalks safer and wider for walkers
and bikers not only makes it easier to exercise and travel but
it makes it easier to keep our social distance when
exercising.

With so much less traffic these days, and more people out
walking and riding bikes, it is incomprehensible to me that the
city is making no effort to accommodate pedestrians and
cyclists. A silver lining amidst the horrors of this virus is the
renewed interest in healthy, non-polluting forms of
transportation. We'd be crazy not to take advantage of the
moment.

As the parent of two active young children, much of our time
is spent outside and it's becoming increasingly difficult to
maintain proper social distance from others due to the
increase in people as the weather gets nicer. A more
strategic use of the city streets would increase the efficacy of
public health efforts as well as improve mental health
outcomes for many adults and children in our community.
PLEASE close streets to cars to allow for safer outdoor transit
and activities.

I have two major concerns as a Cambridge Resident: 1. As
much as possible I try to shop at and support local business.
It's part of what makes Cambridge, Cambridge. We need to
be supporting the community, and if these businesses are
saying that can't survive without additional support, we need
to support them. Cambridge won't be a place I want to live
without the community and local businesses we have today.
2. Living in a tightly packed city was always a conscious
choice for me. If I had an excuse to never get in a car again, I
would. But even as a resident, walking on the streets feels
stressful in today's climate. There's no way to pass another
person and maintain a 6 foot distance. I end up walking
mostly in the bike lane, which poses its own issues. If we
want people to feel safe going on a walk and staying sane in

I cycle to work. I choose to cycle because it is the cheapest
and fastest means of transportation within Cambridge and the
northern parts of Boston. The lack of protected bike lanes in
Harvard Str, Mass Ave. and parts of Broadway and
Cambridge Str. makes me feel unsafe every time I commute.
I generally opt to cycle outside of peak hours to avoid traffic,
or to cycle in the sidewalk because it feels less dangerous.
Cycling in the sidewalks is however inconvenient for
pedestrians. Better bike paths and more spacious sidewalks
would be a great win for our community.

It would make it inviting and safe for my family - me, my wife,
and children -- to get about the city as restrictions slowly
relax.

In Theory this will also reduce the over use of local parks not
on the route so those of us in the high risk group can use
them for exercise walking without encounter as many people
as currently occurs. Presently we have days of heavier
congestion near Hoyt Field etc that makes it hard to social
distance at various hours of the day.

Name

I am a bike commuter who works at On The Rise, an
organization in Cambridge that provides services to homeless
people. I have been hit by a car door on my commute before
(I was in an unprotected bike lane) and carry that fear with
me each time I commute. I have observed that in this crisis
time, though there are fewer cars on the road, drivers seem
to be driving more quickly and less carefully. We've seen that
reflected in the death of Charles Proctor just last month. I am
understanding of how hard it is to coordinate transportation
infrastructure and to balance the needs of pedestrians,
bikers, individual drivers/vehicles, and public transportation
drivers/vehicles. However, I think it is plain to see that
pedestrians' and bikers' safeties are the most at risk because
they are physically unprotected in comparison to those in
vehicles. Furthermore, from a climate justice perspective, it is
important for the City to make good on its promise to invest in
transit options that do not create carbon emissions. I'm calling
on the City to take action in prioritizing the lives and health of
citizens and our shared environment.

I ride my bike around Cambridge and even with the
occasional specified bike lanes it's difficult. I think with more
people thinking about how to get around walking or biking,

It is hard walking around mid-Cambridge and keep a safe
distance due to narrow sidewalks. Some people are good
about moving away, other do not seem to have any sidewalk
etiquette. Closing streets to traffic is a good idea. I
understand that drivers still need to be able to get where they
are going too.

We would all feel more free and comfortable. There would be
increased trust and camaraderie.

I don't have a car! I would love to be able to spend more time
outside walking and biking with a mask, as many health
officials has deemed it safe, but I implore the city of
Cambridge to consider a large scale closure of streets to car
traffic to help make this safe for car-less Cambridge
residents.

This area is the main artery of my daily bike commute. I was
on the path today and it was entirely too crowded to walk,
run, or bike with the space available while trying to distance.
As the weather continues to get better, more people will be
looking for safe areas on their commute or just time in the sun
and out of the house.
I ride my bike for most of my shopping and appointment
errands within Cambridge. I have observed careless behavior
among motorists when confronted with pedestrians using the
streets to maintain social distancing when the sidewalks are
too narrow. I have had to use my bike in the middle of a travel
lane to slow down motorists when there is an approaching
conflict. Please make pedestrians and cyclists a priority.

Anything that reduces our use of fossil fuels is an important

we have a construction right next to our building, and their big

establishment. It blocks our visibility, safety, and practice of

As an independent restaurant owner, I can say that the
negative impact of third party delivery on many aspects of our
society would be better addressed by creating streets than to
attempt to regulate these e commece companies. Safe
streets would make people more likely to be willing to come
get their own food, first of all, and make it harder for the third
party drivers to take up all of the road and endanger
pedestrians and cyclists in denser areas so they will be less
able to intercept the available food from customers wishing to
purchase directly.

to think how many are supporting Amazon or Whole Foods in
an effort to comply with social distancing protocols. I'm
confident if they had more space to safely walk or bike to us,
they would! Thank you!

The Charles River bike paths are the safest and easiest paths
to ride with my family. But they are too crowded currently to
consider riding on. This leaves us no place to bike together
safely. DCR should be making more room on all its roadways
for people walking and biking.

I (used to) commute to Kendall Square and would like to be
able to do that safely going forward.
I regularly bicycle on the bike path along the Charles River to
get to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods for shopping.
Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has made this ride
difficult, as the path is very narrow and there is far less than
6' of space to separate walkers, joggers and bicyclists from
each other. At the same time, motor vehicle traffic is
dramatically reduced now, so much of the motor travel lane
space on Memorial Drive is not being used. The current
conditions are a public health risk and should be addressed
by opening up some of the lanes on Memorial Drive to
walkers, joggers, and bicyclists. Similar road changes should
be made on other roads in Cambridge to create an
interconnected network of roads that bicyclists can use for
essential trips.

I think this would be a great idea since the weather is looking

for those who must street park. Perhaps, since many people

there’s a snow emergency?

You can't social distance by six feet on a five foot wide

I don't own a car so I primarily walk or bike to the store to pick
up groceries. While walking to the store I find it extremely
difficult to maintain proper distance from my neighbors on the
sidewalk. Inevitably one person will step into the road or the
bike lane in order to maintain a safe distance from the person
on the sidewalk. If we "extend the sidewalks" we will just be
making it safer to do what people are already doing (ie
stepping into the roadway to avoid others) by giving people
the space to distance without fear that they'll come into
contact with a car or take a biker in the bike lane by surprise.

02138

I am an essential worker and am walking or biking to work so
that I do not need to take the bus during this pandemic. It can
be hard to maintain the 6 foot distancing with so many people
out, especially now that it is getting warmer. These changes

As a resident of the Cambridge/ Somerville area, I've felt very
unsafe due to COVID-19, as would be expected. What
increases this feeling of a lack of safety is having to walk into
the street to avoid other people on the sidewalk. It doesn't
make sense to keep prioritizing motor vehicles over basic
safety during such a severe global crisis. Also, most residents
of this area don't drive; the majority of us bike, walk, or take
public transit. While I understand that some essential
workers, such as delivery drivers, require roadways to drive
on, many of our essential workers commute via bike or
transit. And, any slight inconvenience in time or energy
caused to a driver is justifiable when weighed against the
larger health risk of the majority of people outside having to
either pass each too closely on the sidewalk or walk into the
street to avoid getting hit. It is unreasonable to expect people
to choose between social distancing and being run over. We
need to side with public safety.

02144

As a Somerville resident, I am also impacted by decisions
made in Cambridge. Please make our city streets safer for
people, not cars - at a time when use of outside space is so
necessary for physical and mental health. Thank you.

02141

I have a stroller often while I'm walking and can't easily just
avoid other people in the path. I currently take my walks in
North Pointe/Paul Revere Park instead as I don't feel
comfortable socially distancing on Cambridge side walks even getting there right now is hard with all of the
construction going on with Lechmere station and Obrien hwy.
I don't have a car and worry about the ability to socially
distance to run errands once things reopen.

As someone who commutes into kendall square by bicycle and is considered essential. I can safely say that there are
more strollers and walkers in the bike lanes than ever before.
Cambridge should capitilize on the reduced road traffic due to
the current situation to provide more and safer options for
walkers, runners, strollers, and cyclists.

It would make walking the sidewalk with my family safer, from
car and bike traffic and from others as while practicing social
distancing.

I would feel far less stressed about passing people in the tight
width of the sidewalk- especially with a stroller.

I try to choose local businesses for as many of my purchases
as possible, especially right now, when times are especially
tough. If the business is close, I walk; if it's far, I bike.
However, every time I walk outside, I have to decide whether
it's safer to squeeze by someone on the narrow sidewalk,
risking possible infection, or walk out into the street, exposing
myself to motor vehicle traffic. On the bike, it's no better - the
combination of dramatically reduced traffic and heightened
demand for deliveries has led to a potent mix of speeding
cars and chronically blocked bike lanes. Looking ahead to the
city's eventual reopening, I worry that everyone who can will
choose to get around in a private car, leading to
unprecedented levels of congestion, pollution, and danger to
vulnerable users. If we act now, we can steer ourselves
toward a better future.

My family and I bike. We want to be able to access the whole
city on our bikes but I don’t feel safe outside of a streets that
have very nice bike paths (western ave being the main one).
We ride the sidewalk very often and get off our bikes to let
people pass. We need more attention to this area of safe
biking/walking and keeping distance! Thank you
I don't ride now in the city because it's too dangerous. Too
many people have been killed or injured. With these changes
many more people would ride bikes and that would alleviate
the congestion.

I’ve needed to bike to work and walk to get groceries. It has
been very hard to maintain distance from others while walking
on our tiny sidewalks. And biking has felt surprisingly at times
more dangerous as the emptier traffic has meant fast
speeding cars. I urge there to be a prioritization of building
more bike lanes as this may be an option many turn to, not
just for environmental reasons, but also health ones, since
public transit may not adequately be able to keep us safe and
distanced.

I regularly bike to work along Memorial Drive - now with

but also to maintain social distancing, there is little space for
cyclists and pedestrians to share and remain apart. All of this

I'm one of the thousands of Cambridge residents who does

Walking and biking are my main means of local transport,

recovering. Post-Covid we should not simply return to our
broken, car-centric model.

These changes would allow me to travel more safely.
People need to be able to move around safely! Pedestrians
are dodging each other on narrow sidewalks of Mass Ave
while the streets are wide and have much less traffic. We
need to widen the sidewalk space, especially since now
sidewalks are being used as takeout. Roads need to be
closed to cars (Memorial Drive) â€” even just reducing a lane
would help! As a cyclist I have noticed fewer cars on the
roads, but they are going much faster and driving more
recklessly than usual. It’s really dangerous for the
pedestrians, cyclists and anyone without a car who needs or
wants to move around the city.

separation is critical. Some streets have lanes but they dead
end suddenly. Separation barriers are badly needed.
Cambridge has potential to be a MODEL US city like Holland
and Denmark. Let’s be visionary! We could save gas
emissions, improve health, and give our teens the autonomy
to get around safely. We could also improve social distancing
and not have to take the subway. I wouldn’t have to hire a

We've taken to biking in the streets as the sidewalk is not

road with cars makes not just me, but the car drivers as well,
very nervous. Despite living .2 miles from Memorial Drive we
can't use it because of the narrow, crowded sidewalks.
Certainly more people have been getting out for walks, runs,

It is hard or impossible to safely pass people on the narrow
often congested paths along the Charles River while roads
right next to them are nearly empty. I go that way, and others
with similar issues, walking or by bicycle to shop for food, it
would be very helpful if some of this barely used road space
were made available.

If it were safer to bike around the city not only would I let my
teen bike more often, but I would bike more. We live in a fairly
dense, low elevation city; let's use this crisis as an
opportunity to re-think how we get around. (One other idea:
how about creating "10-minute parking only" spaces in both
residential and commercial neighborhoods. This would give
rideshare vehicles a place to pull over instead of just stopping
in the middle of traffic, and it would give residents a place to
unload groceries and other items. The only time I need to
park right near my apartment is when I'm unloading stuff.)

I am a resident on Harvard St. and I am overjoyed with the

Please implement this as soon as possible. I would also like
to encourage the use of a lane-wide sign that denotes
â€œlocal access onlyâ€ , which would be larger than the
current planned signage. I believe this type of deterrent would
be more effective in dissuading cars from going down the
slow street and increase the health and well-being of our

It is impossible to ride my bicycle from my home in Arlington
to my workplace in Cambridge or grocery store in Somerville
without negotiating dangerous intersections, roads that are
used by tractor trailers, potholes, and other hazards. I should
be able to ride my bicycle with the same level of safety as I

These are important steps to remain vigilant and minimize
risks, especially as we get closer to summer and the
pandemic is not yet under control.
These changes would allow me to bike rather than drive to
work in Watertown, and would make exercising in the city
easier (both running and biking). When driving, I worry a lot
about not seeing a biker coming from behind in a lane-less
area. Having dedicated, safe lanes all over the city would
help a lot.

Where I live in Somerville, I not only commute through
Cambridge to get to work Downtown, I also regularly frequent
Cambridge businesses: I do much of this by bike. Even with
the reduced amount of traffic during the current shutdown,
many areas continue to feel unsafe to bike through. And with
the volume of people utilizing limited bike paths in Somerville,
improved access to areas like Memorial Drive would allow me
to safely access many more miles of riding, without concern
for my family's health and safety (my partner is

As a frequent runner, I am so lucky to be able to have access

Outdoors is the only place right now for us to escape our
homes. There are sections of the River way that can’t
accommodate social distancing forcing people to either jump
to the busy streets or come in closer contact with each other.
Not everyone wears a mask. I’d feel much safer with wider
sidewalks and traffic restricted lanes. I dont know who’s out
there who I can infect and vice versa. Car traffic is down
anyway so we need to be agile and adapt for what the city

I live in Cambridgeport along Pleasant St near Alberico Park /
Allston St. While auto volumes have decreased significantly
at the intersection outside my third-floor window, pedestrian
volumes have undoubtedly increased. I can attest that both
Pleasant and Allston, two streets identified within the Bike
Plan as Neighborway-esque facilities, act as conduits for
Cambridgeport/Mid-Cambridge grocery shoppers living to the
north, south, or west of the Whole Foods on River St and
Trader Joe's near Memorial Drive (plaza between Pleasant
and Magazine). Closing low-hanging fruit streets, such as
those identified in the bike plan as slow speed streets or other
neighborhood thoroughfares that connect to commercial
centers, would help reduce potential exposure for me, my six
year old daughter, and, most importantly, my immunocompromised wife. As a transportation planner I am gravely
disappointed at the City's inaction on this front. Without
repurposing at least a portion of the automobile sewer for
people walking and biking, our urban form/built environment
simply does not guarantee the space required for social
distancing. As a result, vulnerable users are inevitably faced
with a dilemma of accepting a known risk (passing a fellow
user while staying within the sidewalk or trail) or taking a
gamble on the unknown (departing from the facility and
potentially colliding with another user/vehicle). Neither of
these should be an option in the COVID-19 world where
congestion is non-existent and volumes have plummeted by
over 90%. I would love for commercial parking areas,
beginning with those that already act as emergency tow/snow
clearance zones, to be steadily repurposed into overflow
parking for residents. This would enable the current on-street
spaces to be converted into more productive uses, like bike
parking, parklets, green infrastructure, etc. Providing some
form of parking relief should help provide the City with cover
when naysayers begin to push back. Thanks for doing all that
you do!

Finding places to safely move around our city has always
been challenging with small children. There are many street
crossings that are dangerous and as my 4 year old has taken
to riding his bike there just aren't great options. He can ride
on the sidewalk but that isn't great for me as I am riding a
larger bike. In the few places where we have bike paths or
protected lanes he can ride with me. With the lower traffic
volumes, we have been riding on the street in neighborhood
streets. The cars parked are still an issue as he isn't ready to
avoid the door zone, wear a mask, socially distance when
others are on the street etc. This is our chance to pilot the
whole big connected bike network we all want for our city. We
have fewer people driving and that will either continue with
the slow ramp up or openings or it will get to a really bad
place if more people decide that it isn't safe to travel any way
other than in a private car. If we can reallocate the space to
people walking and biking and give them enough space to
safely socially distance, we can make it attractive to bike and
walk and unattractive to drive. This is the future we want. Lets
take this as a chance to move on it quickly.

Riding my bike around Boston would be so much easier and
safer if I didn’t have to stop or slow down to avoid pedestrians
and cyclists on such narrow sidewalks when there aren’t even
cars driving on the expanse of roads ringing such a lovely
natural resource that should belong to the people anyway,
and not just motorists.

I live on a very narrow intimate private right-of-way footpath.
We are now getting flooded with people walking on our path.
People none of us know. I have seen strange men staring at
the young kids playing in the yard across from me. I have
been verbally assaulted twice when asking passers to please
be sure to wear a mask (the path is only 8' wide at it widest)
and someone decided to snap off a lilac branch, probably
thinking it was constricting traffic too much. People physically
push past me if I'm not going fast enough for them if I'm
carrying heavy things or dragging my barrels to the curb.
Little children without masks climb on the low fence, their
dogs poop all over. The mailman wishes we would put up
gates to stop the traffic since he now also has to watch out for
rogue dog turds. Keeping actual public recreational open
spaces closed - like Memorial Drive and Mt Auburn Cemetery
along with all of the playgrounds - is forcing dangerous

Safe walking routes throughout the city that support social

routes because 6ft separation between cyclists and
pedestrians is not enough based on Dutch studies of airflow
around cyclists and runners. Pedestrian only routes should be
prioritized because they can serve more people including at

If these changes were implemented, I would not feel so
constrained (as an older adult) about using the riverfront for
walking and biking, and I would also feel much better about
patronizing local restaurants for takeout if the sidewalk
spaces were made broader, at least temporarily. One of the
"unknowns" about the opening up strategy for Boston and
Cambridge is how citizens are going to react. We need to try
new solutions to make the next months (or longer) work for
Cambridge residents and businesses.

If more people have more space to social distance, more

I'm in my 60s, immunocompromised, with arthritis and
resulting bad balance, but I have to walk to maintain my
limited mobility and to get to curbside pickups at stores.
Younger people and especially panting joggers without
masks continually force me over curbs into the street, into
traffic or not, to stay 6+ feet away from them (in 2 months
only one jogger has shown the courtesy to take to the street
instead of making me dodge him!). Sometimes I have to
move quickly, risky with bad balance--especially as people
drive faster lately, even on side streets. Mass Ave is
impossible. At this point I can only walk safely after dark,
which brings its own risks, especially to someone with bad
balance. This will be our situation for a few years. Widened
sidewalks, more bike lanes, above all a safe MBTA would
change everything. Now, I'm a prisoner. As a taxpayer and
citizen, I'd like to feel equal.

1. We have a dog who needs to go outside 6-7 times a day.
We used to take him to the dog park a few times a week but
now that they are closed we have to get him adequate
exercise by walking him just on the sidewalks. This means we
are encountering more people, more frequently, and in closer
proximity, because we are spending more time on the narrow
sidewalks in Cambridge. We often have to step into the street
to avoid other pedestrians, putting ourselves at risk. If the
sidewalks were widened we would not be forced to step into
traffic every time we encountered someone else on the
sidewalk. 2. Our only modes of transportation are by bike and
by foot. You would think that it would be safer right now to
bicycle, because there are far fewer people driving, but that is
incorrect. Drivers are speeding and paying even less
attention. Two cyclists have been killed in the last 3 weeks in
the area. Since cycling is even more dangerous than before,
when at least the volume of traffic served to limit the speed of
individual vehicles, we conduct more errands by foot than we
would otherwise. As I already pointed out, this means we're

I bicycle to work, and also shopping, and have done so for
nearly 25 years. I laud the improvements Cambridge has
made for cyclists. However, bike lanes are routinely used for
delivery parking (delivery trucks should hold up car traffic
before taking to the bike lane, as is the case in European
cities), and where bikes and pedestrians share space, there
is often too little room for safe transit. I was also amazed that
the Sunday car-free memorial drive was cancelled because of
Covid. This causes more crowding, not less. Memorial Drive
would be better off as a pedestrian zone 7 days a week than
cutting the one good day.

As the weather gets better, more people will be coming
outside. Let's prioritize people's health by giving more space
to people. Why should cars get so much street, especially
now when tehre is so little traffic? We also know that being
outside and exercising is good for our health and that
pollution from cars is bad for our health--not to mention that to
transition to carbon neutrality for the whole planet's health,
we need to move away from a car culture. This is a perfect
time to take cars off many Cambridge streets, the way so
many other cities are doing, so we can be outside and
continue to keep a safe distance.
I focus on items 1 and 3, something our City Manager could
do. 1. Making walking easier on a few selected streets all
over the city will mean everyone can go for walks and keep
distance without having to step into the street and risk falling
(age 78) or getting hit by a vehicle. 3. Closing some lanes on
Memorial Drive every day would mean no worry about great
masses of walkers on single Sundays, no need for big police
presence.

As someone who cycles 10,000-12,000 miles per year, these

seriously the mandate to serve and protect (and regulate) not
just cyclists, but pedestrians and motor vehicle drivers too.
Cambridge has far too many vehicles moving on narrow
streets at speeds that exceed the posted city limit. (Oh that
the local police would spend X hours every day monitoring
streets throughout the city and ticketing those who are driving

I would walk and bike much more. I am only a casual biker
now, but could make it my main form of transportation.

02141

Right now, there's limited space to avoid people outside so I
have to stay inside most of the time. Sidewalks aren't wide
enough to accommodate social distancing. If I were able to
get out more easily, I could do pickup orders from restaurants
and small businesses rather than having things shipped to
me from online. It would also help me stay healthy. While
staying inside has been important for my health and safety,
exercise and movement is important too.

02139

This would be amazing to create more space for walkers!

02141

I walk and bike with my kids around the neighborhood. So,
dedicating as much space as possible to walking and biking
would improve our situation a lot. Also, re the green line
extension, making the Union Sq stop directly accessible from
Cambridge (or, even better, adding a stop at/near Medford St
bridge/Target) would make the T much better accessible in
our neighborhood.

My family and I have been walking much more since the

Brook Parkway, our options are fairly limited, and walking
with an 18 month old means it’s impossible for her to wear a
mask. It’s frustrating to see both of these enormously wide
roads with such narrow sidewalks â€“ we could easily remove
a lane of traffic from both of these roads given the reduced
traffic right now. Similarly â€“ the reduced traffic seems to
mean more cars are driving much faster than usually,
because they can. I would love to see more raised
crosswalks on Mass Ave, and more pedestrian crossings

My main activity includes walking and running locally and I've
found my travel spheres contracting a lot in this time. I often
find it impossible or dangerous to maintain proper social
distance. Often I or fellow walkers will have to either walk into
the street or wait in a clearing for someone else to pass in
order to manage to adhere to the rules. If we, as citizens,
have to put in work to keep everyone safe, the city should
also show they're willing to work to make it easier for us.

I am observing many more people biking and walking in our
neighborhood of East Cambridge. Even with less traffic,
corners and intersections still pose a hazard to people who
are walking in the street. Having a "slow streets" initiative
would help slow down cards who do have to access our
neighborhood streets, and remind them that they should
expect more pedestrians in the street. In addition, widening
existing linear park areas to give people more room to spread
out seems to be the best way to allow outdoor access while
maintaining social distance. Due to the decreased traffic, we
have been using our bicycles more to go to the local grocery
store. I would normally not have tried to bike in Cambridge as
it has been so unsafe. Increasing bicycle safety, dedicated
bike lanes and pedestrianized routes must continue if we are
to keep both health issues and environmental goals in mind.
Thank you.

I bike to Cambridge almost every day for exercise at the
Charles River and to shop at Trader Joe's. Memorial Drive
has become a terrifying part of the journey and obviously the
very very narrow pedestrian path would be inappropriate to
use. There needs to be pushback immediately - we can't just
let speeds on that road to keep climbing without providing a
safe alternative for the rest of us not using cars and trucks.

Using a bicycle as our primary mode of transportation would
be much safer- especially for children- and closing off streets
would dramatically improve the ability to socially distance

I support transitioning a significant portion of Cambridge
roads to permeable paved paths primarily for pedestrians and
bikers. This is an actual emergency. Please, make exercise
and transportation part of a healthy life not a health hazard.
Cambridge needs to create new jobs and new infrastructures
reflective of a green new deal. Safe streets for walkers and
bikers of all abilities, ages, income levels, insurance policies,
and localities can help mitigate the current public health crisis
and help the ecosystem. Neighborhood shared greenways
are needed now and for the safety of future generations.

down Memorial Drive at speeds that require 100% focus on

bridge and then either left or right on Memorial Drive. Since
social distancing has become necessary, we no longer take
this route because of the narrowness of the sidewalk along
Mem. Drive. It's a shame, because we have been deprived of
one of our favorite walks just at a time when walking has
become more important for our physical and mental health.
Please close part of Mem. Drive to traffic and allow peds and
cyclists more space. Thank you.

I work in the building industry and I am involved with a project
in Cambridge that is currently paused. Normally the T is my
main mode of transportation to the job site, but I am seriously
considering biking once things open up again. Memorial drive
would be my main route, however it is currently unsafe and
far too narrow even when there are few people using it.
Providing space on memorial drive, even if it is just one lane,
would make my commute a lot safer and more feasible.

I live in Boston but right on the river so most of my socially

As a runner, I would love to see widened sidewalks and slow

me. Efforts to avoid high-trafficked areas has led me to
smaller streets where encounters between pedestrians and
drivers on windy, cobbled sidewalks and tight roads can be
challenging and tense, creating stress and frustration for all
involved. As the weather warms and summer arrives, let's
create streets that allow all of us to get outside for fresh air

We only get around by bike and with runners and walkers
moving into the bike lanes it's getting dangerous for bikes
with more cars on the roads.

Please open Memorial Drive for socially-distanced excercise
and for essential employees; I ride from Somerville to
Waltham to sort mail in my office at Brandeis University and
use Mem Drive Path as the safest off-road option to connect
to Greenough Blvd/Watertown. I choose to ride because it is
safer than taking public transit. But the Path is not safe for
social distancing-- it is only 5ft wide in many places which
makes that impossible to do. Meanwhile I see people
deciding to take the lane on Mem Drive due to path crowding,
and that is extremely unsafe as drivers are speeding more
than usual on a road that already sees high traffic speeds.
There is less than half of the normal car traffic, and Mem
Drive should be open to commuters/walkers/bikers 7 days a
week while we see a transportation mode shift during the
pandemic. Please, keep people safe by providing four-travel
lanes of space in the name of public health.

I'm deeply distressed that Cambridge has responded to the
covid-crisis by closing down streets that are usually open to
bikes and pedestrians (Mem drive) rather than by opening
more of them up. Meanwhile, many drivers are responding to
the lower traffic conditions by driving faster, causing a RISE
in fatalities. Many other cities (Denver, New York) have seen
the wisdom of closing more streets, opening spaces to allow
people to walk and bike without coming too close to one
another. Yet somehow Cambridge has failed to be in the
vanguard.

I cannot safely walk down the narrow streets of Cambridge

When I need to enter the street to maintain a safe distance
from others, I have experienced many occasions of drivers
wildly exceeding the 20mph speed limit, and putting me and
others in danger due to reckless violation of traffic laws. The
city can effectively address these safety and public health
problems by allocating more street space for pedestrians and
cyclists, and down-prioritize car storage and car volumes.

Currently Cambridge is something of an embarrassment.
Despite claiming to be a progressive City, it lags behind many
in innovating in response to Covid-19, choosing â€”Â it
seems â€” to be reactive rater than proactive. Many cities
around the world, including in the US, have made the
decision to close off 10s or 100s of miles streets (some
permanently!) and convert them to bike and pedestrian areas,
or allow local business to expand out into them. There's no
excuse for not doing that here.

As a Harvard street resident I highly support this initiative
forSlow streets! I believe the cars currently drive too fast
especially the dump and tow trucks. Large beautiful signage
would help to deter traffic and move it to mass ave. Residents
would enjoy the beautiful buildings, and wider paths, which
currently are far too narrow for social distancing. In addition it
could be a great main commuter route for bikes. Thank you!
These changes would enable my husband and I to get to

As a parent of young kids, I've relied on bike rides as a safe
way to get the kids out of the house. While this was relatively
possible at the height of the pandemic with minimal traffic,
already the streets are getting busier and the drivers are
driving fast and many are distracted by phones. It is more and
more dangerous for pedestrians, runner and bikers. This plan
would allow our family to be safe when we leave the house.

Though I live in Medford, I still enter Cambridge frequently,
whether to get groceries and drop off items for people. For
me as a cyclist, I'm amazed that I still feel nervous on the
road because of other drivers even during this time of social
distancing. Wide roads allow drivers to drive their cars fast,

and because there are fewer people out, I notice that drivers
drive very fast on residential areas. By widening the
sidewalks and implementing slower streets where widening
isn't possible, I know I'll feel safer as a cyclist and I am sure
that pedestrians will also feel safer out walking and being
able to cross streets if they need to move out of another
pedestrian's way. It's also frustrating to me that those who
want to bike on a bike trail cannot safely social distance.
During this time when social distancing is still extremely
critical AND going outside and exercising is a godsend for
people's mental health and wellbeing, we must implement
these changes to make everyone safer and healthier.

I totally encourage traffic calming including borrowing more of
street width for the purpose of giving pedestrians and
bicyclists more room to safely occupy such enhanced spaces.
The car is not and should be king. My experience in
European cities is that emphasizing pedestrian and cycling
rights of way promotes community values and urban pride
there and could well do so here. To wit: closing Memorial
drive on Sundays makes even Cambridge much more livable
and people friendly.

Residents Alliance letter to City Council supporting policy orders #1, 7, 8

Importance:

High

Dear Mayor, Councilors, and Manager,
We at the Cambridge Residents Alliance want our city to work even harder to ensure that black and brown communities
are safe and healthy in Cambridge.
We are writing to express support for Policy Order 7, to reduce the $65 million police budget and redirect those funds to
promoting public health and safety in other departments. It does not seem right to withhold funds for a second position
providing housing assistance, while instead increasing the police budget. When members of Black Lives Matter
Cambridge chained themselves to the the city hall doors in 2016, they were calling for more affordable housing, and
Cambridge Residents Alliance supported their call. Policy Order 7 is aligned with BLM's call.
We support the idea of re-thinking the Cambridge Police. That includes not our police using military hardware and
weaponry. We also ask if it makes sense that the social workers within the police department are on the police payroll,
which makes them accountable to the police staff, instead of being on the payroll of the human services department
and working closely with police as needed, but also able to do more preventive work before a person encounters the
police. And we think Councilor Zondervan makes many good points in his COF #2, including on revising the use of force
policy and improving the accountability and transparency of the Police Review Advisory Board.
We also support Policy Order #1 for police wearing body cameras, which may help in the event of something going
wrong; privacy protections would need to be established.
We also support Policy Order #8, declaring racism to be a public health crisis. Our city will need to thoroughly analyze
the city's budget, policies, and practices to see what we should do differently in light of that crisis.
Thank you all for working to make Cambridge better.
Sincerely,
Lee Farris

Support Policy order 1: please schedule a meeting for this important conversation
Support Policy order 4: during this pandemic, food access is critically important and determining
funding for extending such a program should be a priority
Support Policy order 7: we must consider how we are spending resources, I hope that we can
fund a broad range of social services that will allow us to care for our residents as appropriate and
allow policy to focus on their job, rather than serving as the default social service program
Support Policy order 8: as a recent graduate of Harvard's public health program, it is incredibly
important that Cambridge declare racism as a public health crisis.

As the nation with the greatest per capita incarceration on the planet; a military larger than the seven runner-up nations
combined; and decades of cuts to government programs aimed at improving opportunities for low-income people, while
increasing funding for police and prisons; it is clear that these trends must be reversed. If we spend our money to equip
people to contribute to society, they won't have to resort to crime to survive.
I register my support for the following policy orders, so that Cambridge can become part of the solutions:
Policy order #1 POR 2020 #127 : That the Cambridge City Council schedule a hearing to discuss the possible use of body
cameras by the Cambridge Police Department
Policy order #7 POR 2020 #133 : That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to report back to the Council on how

City Council Orders

Cambridge City Councilors: Thank you for considering our comments on the follow policy orders now under
consideration.
Policy Order 127: Body Cameras on Police. The current uprising over the excessive use of police force has credence
because of the wide use of citizen camera photos that has exposed the self-serving inaccuracy of police reports,
especially as they relate to encounters with Black People. Police too often lie on reports that are then exposed by citizen
film footage. Restoration of confidence in policing rests on transparency. (What really happened?). Body cameras on
police are a necessity because "we need to know what happened" and we cannot trust the police to tell us. Period. We
give police the power of the badge and weapons. We need to know how they use that power. Body cameras are a
necessity in modern day policing to begin the restoration of citizen confidence in our Criminal Justice System. Given the
current blatant racism, use of excessive force, and mendacity in policing, it is shocking that body cameras are not already
required.
Policy Order 133: Allocation of Funds to promote Public Health: The nature of policing needs to be reexamined. The demilitarization of police needs to begin. We need to put our money into promoting public health and "real safety". We
need to focus on deescalation of violence and put resources into combating poverty and disease and promoting mental
health. An examination of the real needs of our people and an examination of how policing can play a positive role is in
order. It can begin with a look at how most Scandinavian countries approach "public safety".
Policy Order 134: That the Cambridge City Council declare racism as a public health crisis. This order is a good start but
two things have to follow: an action plan and the execution of that plan in a timely fashion.
Finally, we would like to know what is happening to the movement to get city-wide free broadband and why it has
stalled in Cambridge. This is an equity issue. This pandemic is the final illustration that free broadband has to be
provided so that everyone can adequately participate in this society. Even public education is now dependent on online
access. If we truly care to address the equity issues in Cambridge, free broadband must be included.

Dear Council of the City of Cambridge,
My name is Carl Rothenhaus and I am a resident of 75 Lawn Street in the Strawberry Hill
neighborhood of our fair city. I am writing to communicate my support for Policy Orders 2020
#129, #133, and #134.
#129: Affordable housing is a necessary commodity in the city of Cambridge. Most large cities
in the United States, before the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, were experiencing
massive housing bubbles. The city of Cambridge was no exception. Now with almost 40
million Americans filing for unemployment, many are struggling to pay their mortgages
and high monthly rent. Increased affordable housing in the city of Cambridge, and
increased ability for builders and developers to build more affordable housing within the
city of Cambridge is necessary to be able to come out of this crisis on the right foot and
firmly establish Cambridge as a world class city, for those of all incomes, for years to
come. Moreover the 100% affordable housing overlay is forward looking. The 100%
Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) does not include motor vehicle parking minimums,
and encourages the construction of green transport infrastructure, such as covered bicycle
racks. Finally, while being forward looking, the AHO does not neglect the importance of
maintaining neighborhood character by instituting well-conceived height limits and
setbacks. I look forward to the implementation of the AHO.
#133: The Boston area is home to the oldest police forces in the country. The Minutemen in
Cambridge were some of the first individuals to represent the rebellion against the British.
These minutemen defended 18th century Cantabrigian’s right to life and from the immoral
practices of quartering and unwarranted search and seizure. Unfortunately, these immoral
British practices and disrespect of the rights laid out in the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights have pervaded modern police forces since their inception, especially
towards those of color. Cambridge has always been a revolutionary city, from the first
encampments of the revolutionary army to the first same sex marriages in the United
States. Today, Cambridge has a chance to be revolutionary again. I am encouraged to see
the calling for the reallocation of the increased funding for FY2021. But, I along with
many of my Generation-z peers wish to see the city manager go further in his attempts to
not only reallocate the 4.1 Million increase but to slim the police budget by as much as is
feasibly possible for FY2021 and to reallocate these funds towards increased social
services (to prevent crime in the first place) and increasing the funding for the Police
Review Board (to prevent further instances of excessive force and improper rhetoric).
However, in my own opinion, I will stress that no part of these funding decreases should
affect insurance plans for current public safety workers. The Cambridge Police should be
transformed from a body of enforcement and violence to a body of support for all people.
Finally, I must mention that a police force that does not infringe on people’s rights is a
cheap police force, as legal fees and settlements can substantially drive up costs.
#134: Racism is a public health crisis, plain and simple. I look forward to the passage of this
order.
Sincerely,
Carl F. Rothenhaus

Mayor Siddiqui, Councilors,
My name is Carolyn Fuller and I live at 12 Douglass St in Central Square Cambridge. I am
a member of A Better Cambridge, and, as such, I am here this evening to thank you for
reintroducing the Affordable Housing Overlay, Policy Order #3. After over a year of public
debate and amendments, I hope the AHO is now on a path for a speedy passage.
I am also here tonight, representing myself, in support of Policy Order #7, the review of
the Police Department’s budget. It is way past time for police reform. Police unions across
the country, including here in Cambridge, have far too much power, and use that power to
stymie reform. The one tool that is available to our political representatives and is beyond
the control of the police unions is the police budget. This budget should be directed toward
effectively preventing crime and away from ineffectively policing it.

Needed Modifications to Policy Order #3

To the Cambridge City Council :
The Policy Order #3 on the Council Agenda is intended to
allow for public hearings, as provided in Section 5 of Chapter
40A. I propose three changes to the first paragraph of the order.
The agenda language for June 8 is correctly labeled as "100%
Affordable Housing Overlay Petition 2020." This designation

has the advantage of retaining the "100%" to
distinguish the new AHO petition from existing
affordable housing incentives through inclusionary
zoning (Section 11.203). The 100% means that
the provisions are directed towards affordable
housing only and not to some fraction of new
housing being built. Therefore the wording in the
first paragraph should have "100%" inserted
before the word "Affordable."
The "2020" at the end identified this petition as being distinct
from last year's petition, which it is. I see a value in discussing this
petition as it stands and not to discuss all the changes that
were made last year to the original AHO submission.
The proposed order refers to the "attached proposed zoning
ordinance." The Cambridge Zoning Ordinance or CZO refers to
the entirety of the zoning ordinance, and not to changes made
to parts of the ordinance, which is what this amendment is
designed to do. Thus the words "proposed zoning ordinance"
should be replaced with "zoning petition."
Finally, the first paragraph ends with the archaic legal/academic
term "to wit." This words come from the 14th century Middle
English, "to witen" meaning literally "to know." Modern usage
suggests "namely," but for clarity I would prefer to replace "to wit:"
with "The full text of the petition is :"

Packet Pg. 308

With these changes, the first paragraph would be in good form
to move the petition of the four Councillors towards the next step,
which is public hearings.
The next two uses of the word "ORDERED" would appear to
have legal problems. The present wording suggests that the
Council as a whole would by order seek to amend Section 2.000
on definitions and add section 11.207. By the provisions of
Chapter 40A, the Council can take action on any petition
only after public hearings, and not before. Chapter 40A is explicitly
structured for that sequence.
The solution is straightforward : simply delete the last two uses
of the word "ORDERED:"

Public comment (via email): Reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget

Dear Cambridge City Council and City Manager,
My name is Nell Hawley and I am a resident of Cambridge (254 Upland Road, Apt. 1, Cambridge MA
02140). This is the first time I am giving a public comment on any issue, anywhere, and I am motivated
to do so because I want to help put an end to the systemic anti-Black racism inherent in policing across
the US, including here in Cambridge. I believe that the best way to combat anti-Black racism in Cambridge
would be to take $4 million from the proposed CPD budget and use it to fund Cambridge public schools,
housing access, support for essential workers, the recovery and promotion of Black-owned businesses,
and public health of all kinds (including mental health).

I am writing to demand that the City of Cambridge reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget.
Cambridge’s needs must be addressed by the provision of care, and not the threat of violence. We must
invest in public services that build towards “a free and fair society” rather than an armed force that
endangers us.

Our city faces racial inequalities, borne from historical injustice and brought into sharp relief by the
COVID-19 epidemic, that can’t be solved by policing. Members of our community live in tight quarters and
on lean budgets–this before a pandemic stole three months of wages, and counting. Thousands of us are
becoming food-insecure and are at risk of eviction as soon as the ban is lifted. Essential educators are
living on starvation pay while repeated and overwhelming community demands to right this glaring
injustice are ignored.

Meanwhile, the Police Department is the single largest expenditure in the City’s General Fund behind loan
repayments. The CPD currently spends 52% of its budget on patrolling–$33,000,000–or 7x as much
spending on patrol than social justice initiatives.
Now especially, the City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and
investing in Black and Brown communities–starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful

Policy Order #139 Affordable Housing Order

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
I am not surprised to see that the AHO is back, but I am deeply saddened by this fact. It is frustrating to have spent so
much time and energy on this highly problematic and divisive issue last year, and to see it emerge in the middle of the
COV-19 pandemic with seemingly no changes – either for key improvements or in response to the massive changes the
city is now undergoing and will continue to do so as a result of COV.
Far greater consideration is needed for new and ongoing factors related to the city’s affordable housing situation such
as:

1. the sizable increase in unemployment rates in Cambridge - and how this will impact not only city funding, but

also basic things like housing. Note: without employment these people will not likely to be included in the AHO
as currently framed, because they would not be able to pay the needed rents.
2. The likely sizable down turn in taxable commercial and other funds that will come into the city coffers as a result
of COV in the foreseeable future that can be used to pay for this overly expensive and. underperforming
developer-exclusive model of increasing housing availability.
3. The vast expenses the city has had to (and will have to) incur as a result of COV – resources that cannot be used
viably for these projects.
4. Changes in state and federal policy since the last AHO discussion that now make every citizen of the country (not
just Cambridge residents) available for inclusion in the long lists of eligible candidates.
5. The increase in city and area homeless populations in part as a result of COV – people not intended for inclusion
in the AHO as currently framed because they do not have the requisite financial and other means of paying
rents.
6. Possible changes to state law on rent control policy that may help alleviate some of the affordable housing
needs both here and the broader area.
7. Ongoing changes in work that enable more and more employees to fulfill jobs from home where ever they live,
making the need to travel to Cambridge for employment less critical.
8. Ongoing property value considerations in the city that will make these massive projects (in some cases 7 to 8
times the density/scale of current structures) most viable in our poorer areas, regardless of zip code, further
impacting these sectors.
9. Ongoing concerns about allowing a FAR of 2.0 throughout the city, as of right - a scale of development that is
normally only allowed for massive urban high rises – whether we are talking about Mumbai, New York, or other
cities.
10. Ongoing concerns about the AHO plan because it stands at odds with both Livable Cities Movement and other
now widely accepted Urban planning guidelines to keep the massing of new housing on the main corridors in
proximity to public transportation and key amenities.
In the end, I hope that you will come together to support an affordable housing policy that is far more compatible with
our progressive values, the dramatically transformed situation of our time, our financial concerns, real housing needs,
and established livable cities and urban design considerations.
Cordially,
Suzanne Blier

Comment on June 8th Policy Order #7

Hello, my name is Jan Stefan Kaczmarek and I live at 3 Riverside Place. I moved to Cambridge in 2002, but this is my first
time giving public comment. The murder of George Floyd has so shocked and horrified me that I want to advocate for
tangible actions and real change to help my black and brown neighbors. Our police department already has sufficient
funding. In order to further reduce crime, support communities of color, and become a national leader in policing for
racial equity, those funds would be better used for preventive social services, economic empowerment initiatives, and
similar programs. Thank you for your time, and I will be closely following the CIty Council's steps on this issue.

Re: Closing streets
Petition · Cambridge City Manager Close some Cambridge Streets to promote a healthy
re-opening · Change.org.pdf

Good afternoon,
I am writing to follow up on my letter sent May 14, 2020. I did not receive a response from the City Manager, which is
unfortunate considering the time I took to write the letter, but such is life, I suppose. In the meantime, I started a
petition and am respectfully submitting it here to the City Manager and City Council.
Over the past month, the City has announced plans to create three shared streets. I applaud this first effort and expect
to participate in the first opening day next week by taking my mother, who requires the use of a wheelchair, from her
home near Central Square to mine via the Harvard (shared) Street. She has not done this trip (or many others) on her
own before because traveling long distances in her chair is often fraught with dangers including broken sidewalks,
uneven or missing curb cuts, or other obstructions and obstacles that make it dangerous.
My mother, with several preconditions that make her extremely vulnerable to COVID, is terrified of being outside near
others. The sidewalks around her apartment are woefully inadequate and do not promote social distancing. Recently, I
went to Whole Foods on Prospect Street to get her tea, and noticed that the line forming on the sidewalk to enter
means you either walk/wheel within a foot or two of all the people waiting or step into traffic. A person in a wheelchair
cannot do the latter, and thus puts themselves and others at risk by failing to maintain proper distancing.
The inadequacy of our sidewalks to accommodate pedestrians and wheelchair users during "normal" times is sad. During
a pandemic it is dangerous and potentially deadly. Will it take someone getting run over by a driver to cause the City to
create more sidewalk space? We have narrow streets, I get that, but we also allocate a lot of the public right of way to
private car storage and too-wide travel lanes. To safely allow retail and restaurants to reopen, street parking or excess
road space for vehicle travel needs to be given to people. I know the city is issuing sidewalk dining permits, but I ask,
where do the pedestrians go?
Finally, I want to convey another incident I observed two weeks ago. When driving my car (I am not anti-car) on Lambert
Street by Millers River Apartments, I observed another driver honk their horn at a man in a wheelchair who was
traveling slowly in the street, probably because the sidewalk is too narrow or otherwise obstructed. The audacity of the
driver to honk at a person who requires the use of a wheelchair was sickening (and I let that driver know), but also
maddening is the fact that our streets are not able to safely accommodate all users, with priority given to cars first. This
must change now.
I respectfully submit the petition and it's 31 signatures and two comments. Please read the comments.
Thank you,

Good evening,

Countless cities around the world are moving aggressively to prepare their cities for reopening, yet Cambridge seems
stuck in some sort of time warp, having done nothing since the Council recommended the Manager act on this.
I’ve been on many walks where I have to venture into traffic lanes to avoid oncoming pedestrians. I’m passed by
runners who cannot stay 6’ away without putting themselves and me in danger. How is this putting our health first and
foremost?
We also should be immediately striping bus lanes to allow MBTA buses to move through as efficiently as possible so
that they can operate more frequently. This is imperative to promote less crowding on our bus routes. We also need
more sidewalk space at bus stops so people waiting have space to spread out.
As restaurants and retail shops prepare to open, they will be required to limit occupancy. How is a small shop or
restaurant supposed to survive if they can only have a 20-40% of the tables full at any one time? They need room to
expand seating outdoors, and our sidewalks are woefully inadequate to support them.
Now is the time for Cambridge to reduce travel lanes and prepare our business districts by limiting on street parking
and traffic so that more space can be given to people. If we don’t do it now, it will be too late when the gridlock
returns.
I urge the City Manager to consider closing Mass Ave through Central Sq, Harvard Sq, Porter Sq, and Cambridge Street
from Inman Sq into E Cambridge, to all vehicles except buses and emergency vehicles — Cars will find their way
around, but we shouldn’t be going out of our way to convenience those who want to get through our city as quickly as
possible. Give the street space to restaurants, bars and stores so our local businesses can reopen successfully.
Further, consider closing a network of local streets so people have more space to walk, run and bike without fear of
speeding cars. Let our kids have free reign this summer.
Finally - close Memorial Drive for good. Connect our city with its waterfront for its entire length from Arlington to
Kendall and Lechmere. If someone wants to drive 50 mph, let them use limited access Storrow. The paths on Memorial
Drive are WAY too narrow to support the number of people who use it. Why force them onto sidewalks that at times
are no more than 4-5’ wide? Why are we prioritizing cars zooming through? We could have a world-class riverfront
linear park and a bike highway, so that when people return to their offices in Kendall Square, maybe more will bike
instead of drive their cars as fast as possible from Belmont and Arlington through our city. There’s no reason we need a
4-lane highway on our waterfront.
I urge you to act now. Waiting until June or July will be too late.
Thank you,
Luis Mejias

It’s incredibly frustrating that there has been little to no action on the part of the City to close streets or reduce vehicle
lanes to widen sidewalks so that we can safely walk down the street while maintaining proper distances from
others. We also need to implement (enforced) bus lanes and give more space to restaurants and retail.

by reducing travel lanes or closing streets completely to:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Promote safe physical distancing,
Provide outdoor space to accommodate safe restaurant dining and retail patronage,
Provide room for buses to operate more efficiently, thereby reducing crowding at bus stops and on-board, and
Encourage those who need to travel for work or pleasure to do so without a car, by expediting the expansion of safe
bicycling space, preventing congestion from returning with a vengeance.

We are already experiencing the benefits of reduced traffic, including much lower air pollution and less noise. The reopening of our economy without proper planning will lead to a return of traffic congestion and all of its ills, in addition to
making it harder to stay safely apart when walking, running or cycling. Restaurants and retail establishments will find it
hard to turn a profit if their occupancy is limited. We know how to avoid this and promote the public health and safety.
Local examples could include reducing vehicle access and parking on Mass Ave in Central, Harvard, and Porter Squares,
and Cambridge Street around Inman Square into E Cambridge, allowing for wider sidewalks for restaurant seating and
retail, to reducing travel lanes or closing Memorial Drive completely, fully connecting Cambridge to its waterfront and
creating a walking/running paradise and bicycle highway from Arlington to Kendall Square and downtown Boston.
The City Council recommended the City Manager enact such measures weeks ago, but nothing has happened. From
Arlington, Brookline and Boston to Paris, Oakland, Tampa, Vilnius and Birmingham, cities are proactively promoting
livability, creating an environment where people feel safer congregating and making their city the vibrant place that they
are. Cambridge needs to do the same.
We, the undersigned, ask the City Manager to begin implementing these measures for the health and safety of
Cantabrigians without further delay.

Public Comment - June 8th - Police Department Budget

Good Afternoon,
My name is Lydia Ducharme. I live at 216 Banks St, Cambridge, MA 02138, and work at the Community Charter School of
Cambridge, just outside of Kendall Square. I have never given a public comment before, but today marks a
crucial decision point for the city of Cambridge, so I'm motivated to engage in this conversation.
I want to see action that strongly condemns and seeks to prevent racial injustice. Due to the pandemic, many
organizations are seeing cuts. The police department has the highest allocation of the city budget, after education above fire, public works, human services Cambridge Health Alliance, and transportation. I want to see education, public
health, and social service organizations prioritized over police.
Cambridge must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown
communities need to be safe and healthy. As a resident of Cambridge, I want to see action.
Thank you for your time.

Tonight’s CC Meeting

Dear Cambridge City Council,
My name is Caitlyn O’Brien and I am a resident of Cambridge.
I am writing to urge that the city lead in the fight against racism in support of Policy Order 8, declaring racism a public
health emergency to take action in the following ways:
Please reduce the CPD budget and increase funding and care of their citizens, especially the black and brown people of
our community.
Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order 7, POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 budget if it
reassigns this funding from the Police Department to other outlets promoting public safety and addressing deep seeded
issues in our community that can’t and shouldn’t be solved by policing – like poverty, the lack of affordable housing,
education, mental health and healthcare.
The Cambridge Police has stated that it is very close to adopting all 8 of the recommendations by the 8 Can’t Wait
project. Commissioner Bard spoke yesterday at the Cambridge Common that the City Council Plans on finalizing that
today. I urge you to please adopt the 8 Can’t Wait policies today and to ensure that the transparency is increased within
the CPD with rapid enactment of the procedure justice "dashboard" reporting on any differences in police treatment
based on race or bias.
Lastly, I am in support of Policy Order POR 2020 #129, enabling affordable housing developers to build more city-wide. It
is an unreasonably imbalanced and tight market making it even harder to live here. This would be another way to help
make a more equitable city.
Please help the community’s unheard voices soar.
Please submit these comments to the record.
Thank you,
Caitlyn O’Brien

Public Comment from Beca Han

Hello,
My name is Beca Han. I’ve been a resident at 211 Harvard St since 2016.
Given the continuation of systematic racism and police brutality, I feel compelled to be here in support of the Black
communities affected.
I believe strong action needs to take place in both solidarity with the black community, but also in order to see real
change happen. I think we should drastically reduce the police budget and demilitarize the police.
Cambridge still accepts excess military equipment for the police, yet the crimes do not require such equipment. These
resources can be allocated elsewhere, such as human services and public health.
I am hopeful of change in Cambridge and will continue to support the Black communities and watch for action to take
place.
Warm regards,
Beca

Support for Policy Orders 1, 7, 8

The past several weeks have highlighted a painful truth that our approach to policing and justice in this country have
often led to violence against our black and brown neighbors, and without reconsidering the role of policing in ensuring
safe and vibrant communities I'm afraid we will continue to see this type of violence play out.
It's clear through the response from the police commissioner to the events surrounding George Floyd's death that the
Cambridge police are aware of and taking seriously their role in this system. And it's also clear that they have already
spent considerable time thinking about how to interrupt the expected cycles of criminalization and violence, as was seen
in last week's request for additional resources to support a dedicated Cambridge outreach worker through the ROCA
program.
All that aside, I hope we will push ourselves to think even more creatively as we attempt to interrupt familiar
patterns. Specifically, I hope we will consider whether the police are the right institution to respond to all that we have
charged them with in recent years - as mental health resources, social workers, school resources, addiction resources,
etc. Whether a better future would have us ask more and more of a single institution, or whether there are other
resources in our neighborhoods which are better suited to address critical needs and with less history of harm. We need
to think more creatively about how to minimize the number of scenarios which call for a resource with a gun and a
uniform.
I support policy order 8 - declaring racism a public health crisis - and hope this will enable additional resources and allow
us to further intensify our focus on this issue.
I support policy order 7 - questioning whether additional police funds requested might be better spent elsewhere. This
will undoubtedly require difficult conversations about whether our current best intentions are enough, but it is
impossible to imagine the police being successful in scenarios where community member's expectations and past
experiences will be a real barrier to that very success.
I support policy order 1 - a hearing about the potential usefulness of body cameras. This should be considered as a
possible tool, although I have seen conflicting indicators as to whether this actually does anything to address incidence
of violence between police and community members, including this study
(https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1) which suggest that it does not significantly impact police
behaviors.
I support Councilor Zondervan's move to hold hearings in the Public Safety Committee and think that centering black
voices will be critical to progress.
Thank you again for your continued focus and efforts,
Kathryn Deane

Going outside business-as-usual in budget considerations

Dear City Council,
I’m writing to ask you to seriously consider thinking outside of business-as-usual in the upcoming discussions of the
place of police funding in the city budget and the declaration of racism as a public health crisis. As a resident of
Cambridge, I want our city to do the best we can in making us an anti-racist, inclusive, and safe place to live and work. As
a relatively recent arrival, I do not have the depth of knowledge of Cambridge policing and the budget in general, but I’m
sure you will be hearing from those who do. Please prioritize the voices of people who have lived experience of racism in
Cambridge and those who have been working on this struggle for too many years. Please seriously consider any
proposals they have that might at first glance seem impossible or impractical. Restricting ourselves to the expected right
now is limiting. I have hope that the unexpected can help us create a more equitable, just, and livable Cambridge.
Sincerely,
Jessica Taylor

Please declare racism a public health crises and allocate resources to make
improvements

Dear Councilors,
I'm writing to encourage you to declare racism a public health crises and to allocate resources to make improvements
here in Cambridge.
I know you will listen to the voices of our Black residents who can speak to what the priorities should be.
From my own experience as a long time white resident and parent of kids in the school system, I think it is a top priority
to find new ways to continue to address racism in our schools. I also hope we can provide more housing for people of all
income levels. In fact wouldn't it be amazing if all city staff were able to find housing within our city!
There are many committed and caring people in this city and I believe that we can make Cambridge a national leader in
equity and anti-racism if we focus on that. I am personally committed to being part of that work.
Thank you for your service,
Ruthann Rudel
205 Rindge Ave
Cambridge

Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO
Project shall comply with the following procedure, which is
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and
staff input into the design of the project.
(a)
The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance
the City’s desired outcomes for the form and character of
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more
affordable housing units, AHO Projects are permitted to
have a greater height, scale, and density than other
developments permitted by the zoning for a given district.
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that
are compatible with the existing neighborhood context or
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area.
(b)
The City’s Design Guidelines for 100% Affordable
Housing Overlay, along with other design objectives and
guidelines established for the part of the city in which the
AHO Project is located, are intended to inform the design
of AHO Projects and to guide the Planning Board’s
consultation and report as set forth below. It is intended
that designers of AHO Projects, City staff, the Planning
Board, and the general public will be open to creative
variations from any detailed provisions set forth in such
objectives and guidelines as long as the core values
expressed are being served.
(c)
At least two community meetings shall be scheduled at a
time and location that is convenient to residents in
proximity to the project site. The Community Development
Department (CDD) shall be notified of the time and
location of such meetings, and shall give notification to
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or
private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which
the AHO Project is proposed and to any individual or
organization who each year files with CDD a written
request for such notification, or to any other individual or
organization CDD may wish to notify.
(i)
The purpose of the first community meeting shall be
for the developer to share the site and street context
analysis with neighborhood residents and other
interested parties prior to building design, and
receive feedback from community members.
(ii)
The purpose of the subsequent community
meeting(s) shall be to present preliminary project
designs, answer questions from neighboring
residents and other interested members of the
public, and receive feedback on the design. The
date(s), time(s), location(s), attendance, materials
presented, and comments received at such
meeting(s) shall be documented and provided to
CDD.

A design statement on how the proposed project
attempts to reinforce existing street/context qualities
and mitigates the planned project’s greater massing,
height, density, &c.
(vi)
Floor plans of all proposed new buildings and
existing buildings to remain on the lot.
(vii) Elevations and cross-section drawings of all
proposed new buildings and existing buildings to
remain on the lot, depicting the distances to lot lines
and the heights of surrounding buildings, and

Within 65 days of receipt of a complete set of materials by
CDD, the Planning Board shall schedule a design
consultation as a general business matter at a public
meeting and shall give notification to abutters, owners of
land directly opposite on any public or private street or
way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet
of the property line of the lot on which the AHO Project is
proposed and to any individual or organization who each
year files with CDD a written request for such notification,
or to any other individual or organization CDD may wish to
notify. The materials shall be made available to the public
in advance, and the Planning Board may receive written
comments prior to the meeting from City staff, abutters,
and members of the public.
At the scheduled design consultation, the Planning Board
shall hear a presentation of the proposal from the developer
and oral comments from the public. The Board may ask
questions or seek additional information from the developer
or from City staff.
The Planning Board shall evaluate the proposal for general
compliance with the requirements of this Section, for
consistency with City development guidelines prepared for
the proposal area and the Design Guidelines for the 100%
Affordable Housing Overlay, for appropriateness in terms
Packet Pg. 782

7.3

of other planned or programmed public or private
development activities in the vicinity, and for consistency
with the Citywide Urban Design Objectives set forth in
Section 19.30. The Board may also suggest specific project
adjustments and alterations to further the purposes of this
Ordinance. The Board shall communicate its findings in a
written report provided to the developer and to CDD within
20 days of the design consultation.
(h)
The developer may then make revisions to the design, in
consultation with CDD staff, and shall submit a revised set
of documents along with a narrative summary of the
Planning Board’s comments and changes made in response
to those comments.
(i)
The Planning Board shall review and discuss the revised
documents at a second design consultation meeting, which
shall proceed in accordance with Paragraphs (c) and (d)
above. Following the second design consultation, the
Planning Board may submit a revised report and either the
revised report or if there are no revisions the initial report
shall become the final report (the “Final Report”). Any
additional design consultations to review further revisions
may occur only at the discretion and on the request of the
developer or the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.
(j)
The Final Report from the Planning Board shall be
provided to the Superintendent of Buildings to certify
compliance with the procedures set forth herein.

Communicating information from the School Committee’s Special Meeting and Regular
Meeting

To the Honorable, the City Council:
The School Committee held a Special Meeting last Thursday, May 28th and a Regular Meeting this past
Tuesday, June 2nd. At both meetings, the School Committee and administration and heard Public Comment.
I’m thankful to everyone that tuned in and signed up to provide their testimonies. We must actively
dismantle the structures of systemic racism in our City and school system. Ensuring a safe and supportive
school environment for our black and brown students is at the center of this work and to be successful, we
must further elevate the voices of our community members.
At last Thursday’s meeting, Superintendent Salim and his team gave a presentation on the work of the
Office of Student Services (OSS) in distance learning for special education students with Individualized
Education Plans (IEPs). The administration spoke to their goals of establishing systemic special education
resources and engaging every student and caregiver in meaningful, regular two-way exchanges. They
reported to have a system of robust engagement with students and families, which some parents say is not
consistent with their own experiences. The Superintendent will survey students and families to gain a better
understanding of the barriers they are facing and how OSS can support them.
This past Tuesday, Superintendent Salim and Deputy Superintendent Turk provided an update on their
planning for their summer. They shared 8 CPS administered programs that will be available, in what
capacity, and to which students. Every program will be offered virtually during the months of July and
August and registration will be live at www.cpsd.us/summer by June 12. Following this update, a number
of motions were passed, including a requirement for the Superintendent and Chief of Information Services
to work with the City Manager in exploring options (beyond existing Wi-Fi hotspots) to close the digital
divide. Most importantly, in response to a request by the CRLS Black Student Union, we adopted a motion
to raise a Black Lives Matter flag outside the CRLS building through the 20-21 school year, effective
immediately.
The Building & Grounds Subcommittee will convene June 5 at 12:30pm to continue the discussion on the
facilities planning as a response to COVID-19.

Funding our Community, Transforming our Policing

To the Honorable, the City Council:
Policing as we know it evolved from slave patrols and is a fundamentally racist institution. The
tragic murder of George Floyd and the resulting protests across the country serve as another
reminder that we need to fundamentally rethink the role of policing in our society. As Chair of
the Public Safety Committee, it is my intent to hold hearings that center Black voices and chart a
course to transformative change. This Communication lays out some of the steps and approaches
that could be taken at the municipal level.

Re-allocation of Funding
The FY21 proposed Police Department budget totals $62 million, including a $4.1 million
increase from FY20. This means the Police Department makes up almost 9% of our operating
budget, the largest department outside of Education. While the proposed budget does include
several initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence and preventing criminal behavior among
young people, it also contains many millions of dollars for traditional violent policing and
equipment including a $1 million cost center for a tactical operations unit
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_tactical_unit>, which is generally the most militarized
component of a police force.
Traditionally, we have responded to criminal activity among young men by increasing the
policing of them. Often, these young men are left behind in our traditional education, artistic, and
Packet Pg. 795

8.2

athletic pathways to economic opportunity, creating immense pressure for them to fall into a
potentially violent and deadly criminal lifestyle. While the Department has implemented some
programs in an attempt to disrupt this cycle, including even some that have been moderately
successful, not enough is being done and we continue to lose too many of our youth to violent
crime and incarceration. Police-centric programs also come with their own inherent limits, since
once down a criminal path a certain distance, the individual becomes potentially unreachable this
way. The response of adding more and more violent policing into the mix through reflexive
annual police budget increases, without sufficiently addressing the underlying socio-economic
risk factors, has allowed generations of young men (often Black) to fall into a life of crime that
becomes difficult to rescue them and society from.
Meanwhile, our very successful youth programs like the King Open Extended Day program
remain shockingly underfunded and limited in scope, despite their demonstrated success and
potential for assisting in the education and wellness of our youth. Many opportunities remain in
our budget to better support young people, especially Black youth. With the final budget vote
coming up on June 15, it is not too late for the council to call on the City Manager to better fund
these programs and to reduce the police budget correspondingly. Specific areas to consider for
increased funding include the many initiatives in the Human Services Department, our summer
youth programs, the RSTA <http://rsta.cpsd.us> program at CRLS, Project Elevate and other
efforts to recruit more teachers of color, providing better mental health services for young
people, and many other ideas that can and should be sourced from the community and those who
have been historically most impacted by our racist and anti-Black approach to education and
economic opportunity.

Body Cameras
The Cambridge Police Department does not currently use body cameras, although they have
done other things to reduce incidents of excessive force. Body cameras can increase
accountability by creating an objective video record of an incident from the perspective of the
officer. While cell phone recordings of incidents have become prolific, body cameras can
provide consistent footage that is more credible in a courtroom. They do come with significant
privacy concerns, however, which must be addressed as part of any policy and implementation.
I support the effort of my colleagues to move forward with a body camera program in the
Cambridge Police Department. However, we should be cognizant of the fact that such a program
will ultimately have a limited impact, and to the extent that body cameras give us comfort in
continuing to fund and expand traditional policing methods, they will be counterproductive to
efforts of deeper and more transformative solutions.
The ACLU and the ACLU of Massachusetts have provided <https://www.aclu.org/other/policebody-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all?redirect=police-body-mounted-camerasright-policies-place-win-all> extensive guidance on how to craft an effective body camera
policy. Key considerations from this guidance include:
● The need to avoid continuous recording while at the same time blocking officers from
selectively determining which encounters are filmed. Body cameras should not be used as

Packet Pg. 796

8.2

●

●

●

●

●
●

general surveillance tools, but allowing for officer discretion undermines any benefit that
the cameras might bring. Special consideration should also be given to encounters
involving domestic violence and rape in order to protect the identity of the survivor.
The need to create consequences for noncompliance with body camera recording,
including direct disciplinary action against the officer and the disallowment of verbal
evidence in favor of the officer that otherwise could have been verified if the camera had
been turned on, except in situations where the officer couldn’t reasonably have turned on
the camera or where other verifiable forms of evidence exist.
The need to implement privacy considerations at the point of recording. The ACLU
recommends limiting cameras to uniformed police officers and marked vehicles only, and
requiring that officers notify people that they are being recorded. Additional
consideration should be given to instances in which police officers enter someone’s
home, particularly in non-exigent circumstances.
The need to incorporate policies related to retention and use. The ACLU recommends
that retention periods should be measured in weeks not years, and policies should be
clearly posted online. Careful thought should be given to who can flag a recording for
further retention, and when they can do so.
The need to ensure that anyone recorded by a body camera can access and make copies of
said recording for as long as it is retained by the department.
The need to regulate public disclosure, including redacting information to protect
identities when possible.
The need to implement protocols and technological controls that prevent tampering or
destruction of evidence by the department.
The need for explicit forbiddance of body camera use by government officials who do not
have the authority to conduct searches and make arrests.

Use of body cameras would fall under the Surveillance Ordinance, which was used
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=2590&Med
iaPosition=&ID=11391&CssClass=> by the Council to rubber stamp massive amounts of police
surveillance the first time we had an opportunity to review these technologies earlier this term.

Use of Force Policy
The version of the Use of Force Policy available online took effect in 2011 and was publicly
released in 2015. The Police Use of Force Project <http://useofforceproject.org> is a helpful
resource that the council can use as a starting point when analyzing our Use of Force Policy. This
tool analyzes use of force policies from 91 of the hundred largest cities in the country, evaluating
them across eight different metrics. As of 2016, none of the 91 cities had a policy that satisfied
all eight of the criteria put forward by the project. The criteria are listed below, along with my
analysis of how Cambridge’s policy measures up. I want to be clear that these eight criteria are
by no means sufficient in my mind, and that a deeper and more radical analysis of the use of
force policy is warranted in order to arrive at a satisfactory place.
1. Does the policy require officers to de-escalate situations, when possible, before using
Packet Pg. 797

8.2

force? No. Cambridge’s policy does not even reference de-escalation. The policy only
stipulates that the force must be immediately necessary. That wording gives an
uncomfortable amount of discretion to officers, and the policy should be modified to
explicitly require de-escalation before using force whenever possible.
2. Does the policy use a force continuum/matrix that defines/limits the type of force
and/or weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance? No. The
policy does not contain such a thing. It does define “lethal” and “less-than-lethal”
weapons, but it doesn’t make it clear how and when to choose between them. Such a
force continuum/matrix would clarify expectations for each type of interaction, and it
would create more clear boundaries around when “lethal” and “less-than-lethal” weapons
can be used.
3. Does the policy restrict chokeholds and strangleholds (including carotid restraints)
to situations where deadly force is authorized or prohibit them altogether? Yes,
mostly. The policy does explicitly ban “carotid control or chokeholds”. Strangleholds are
not explicitly mentioned. However, it also includes a giant loophole, exempting “those
types of manual holds for which a police officer has been specifically trained in gaining
control or maintaining control of a detainee”. We need to better understand exactly which
manual holds are currently considered permissible. Also, while it does say “Officers will
not use any other type of manual holds that are intended or designed to inflict pain or
injury”, I would prefer something more like “Officers shall not use any maneuver
whatsoever that is intended or designed to inflict pain or injury”. Manual holds seems to
refer specifically to the use of hands, which as we saw in the George Floyd case, can be
subverted by using other body parts like knees and full body weight to hold down,
asphyxiate and kill someone.
4. Does the policy require officers to give a verbal warning, when possible, before
using deadly force? No. The policy states that “Where practical prior to discharging a
firearm, officers shall identify themselves as law enforcement officers and state their
intent to shoot.” As we saw in the recent deadly shooting
<https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-03/vallejo-police-shoot-kill-manthat-officer-mistakenly-thought-had-a-gun-he-had-a-hammer> of a suspected looter in
Los Angeles, this type of guidance does almost nothing at all. The officer pulled up in his
vehicle and fired 5 shots through the windshield, striking and killing the suspect who was
kneeling on the ground with his hands in the air. The officer had seen what looked like a
possible butt of a handgun sticking out, which turned out to be a hammer. Presumably the
officer in that situation did not think it was practical to announce his intent to shoot, and
so he didn’t. Furthermore, deadly force is not limited to discharging a firearm, as we saw
tragically in the cases of Eric Garner, George Floyd, and many other police killings that
did not involve firing a weapon.
5. Does the policy prohibit officers from shooting at people in moving vehicles, unless
the person poses a deadly threat by means other than the vehicle (for example,
shooting at people from the vehicle)? Yes. The policy clearly states that "Officers are
Packet Pg. 798

8.2

also prohibited from discharging a firearm at a moving vehicle, except when the
occupants of the vehicle are using it to employ/exert deadly force against the officer or
another victim..."
6. Does the policy require officers to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before
resorting to using deadly force? No. The policy states “Whether the degree of force
used is reasonable depends upon the specific facts surrounding the situation. Only a
reasonable and necessary amount of force may be used. The degree of force that the
officer may reasonably be expected to use depends upon the amount of resistance, or the
threat to safety that the situation presents." None of this indicates that other alternatives
must be exhausted; rather, it reads more like support for a post-hoc analysis justifying the
amount of force that was used.
7. Does the policy require officers to intervene to stop another officer from using
excessive force? No. The policy appears to be silent on this issue.
8. Does the policy require comprehensive reporting that includes both uses of force
and threats of force (for example, reporting instances where an officer threatens a
civilian with a firearm)? Yes. The policy clearly states that “...any officer who points a
firearm at another individual shall be required to fully document the incident in a Use of
Force Report..."

Police Review Advisory Board (PRAB)
From the PRAB website <http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Board/1043-Police-Review-Advisory-Board>:
“The Police Review & Advisory Board was established by City Ordinance in 1984 to:
● Provide for citizen participation in reviewing Police Department policies, practices, and
procedures;
● Provide a prompt, impartial and fair investigation of complaints brought by individuals
against members of the Cambridge Police Department;
● Develop programs and strategies to promote positive police/community relations and to
provide opportunities for expanded discussions, improved understanding, and innovative
ways of resolving differences.
Membership includes 5 civilians who are representative the [sic] City's racial, social and
economic composition.”
At the June 2, 2020 meeting
<https://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/SplitView.aspx?Mode=Video&MeetingID=2653&For
mat=Agenda> of the Finance Committee, staff indicated that the PRAB currently has one
unfilled vacancy. While the biographies of the current members are empty
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Board/1043-Police-Review--Advisory-Board> on the
website, the four current non-staff members all appear to be White professionals, with the only
Packet Pg. 799

8.2

male member also being the current PRAB chair. The vacancy represents an opportunity to make
the PRAB more representative.
In addition, the PRAB has many procedural and transparency limitations that render it largely
ineffective as a police oversight body. While the secretary reported to the Council that only 10
complaints have been filed in each of the past two years, it is unclear how many complaints are
not filed because of a lack of faith in the process. Significant reform of how this body operates
should be considered, including greater independence from the police department, and greater
transparency.

In addition, the PRAB has many procedural and transparency limitations that render it largely
ineffective as a police oversight body. While the secretary reported to the Council that only 10
complaints have been filed in each of the past two years, it is unclear how many complaints are
not filed because of a lack of faith in the process. Significant reform of how this body operates
should be considered, including greater independence from the police department, and greater
transparency.

Comments on 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance Amendment

Fellow Councillors:
Coronavirus has created uncertainty that did not exist when the 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance was first
introduced. To respond to this uncertainty, Cambridge Bicycle Safety, the City Manager and City staff,
and a number of City Councillors have worked jointly to prepare an amendment to the Ordinance’s
original language, which has been circulated to Councillors by the City Clerk.
The amendment:
• Adds a new category of bike lane, the “Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated
Bicycle Lane,” to allow the City more flexibility in hitting the yearly bike lane goals. The
City expressed concern that coronavirus will make public processes more difficult and that it does
not want to install permanent bike lanes without adequate community engagement. “Temporary
Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes” allow the City to install temporary bike lanes
with traffic barrels that would count towards the City’s bike lane mileage requirements under the
Ordinance as they long as the City installs flex posts or a permanent lane by the end of the
applicable deadline for the street segment the temporary bike lane is installed on.
• Allows the City Manager, with City Council approval, to extend any deadline contained in
the Ordinance due to coronavirus-related revenue shortfalls. If coronavirus makes any of the
deadlines contained in the Ordinance impossible to meet due to revenue shortfalls, the City
Manager can come before the Council by July 1, 2022 with proposed dates for an extension,
which the Council will have to approve.
• Allows the City Manager, with City Council approval, to extend by up to four months the
deadline for the completion of the city-wide protected network (see subsection C of the
Ordinance) due to coronavirus-related public outreach activity delays. If coronavirus makes
the deadline for the completion of the city-wide protected network impossible to meet due to
public outreach activity delays, the City Manager can come before the Council by July 1, 2022
and ask for an extension of up to four months, which the Council will have to approve.
