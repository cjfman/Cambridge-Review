Definition of Family (Schmidt et al.)
http://bit.ly/crs-fam-slides

Packet Pg. 2

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Eliminating Invasive Zoning:
Family Definition Petition

Cambridge’s zoning language defines a “family” as:
Family. One or more persons occupying a dwelling unit and living as a single nonprofit
housekeeping unit; provided that a group of four or more persons who are not within the
second degree of kinship shall not be deemed to constitute a family.
Notwithstanding the definition in the preceding paragraph, a family shall be deemed to
include four or more persons not within the second degree of kinship occupying a
dwelling unit and living as a single, nonprofit housekeeping unit, if said occupants are
handicapped persons as defined in Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as
amended by the "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988." Such unrelated individuals
shall have the right to occupy a dwelling unit in the same manner and to the same
extent as any family in the first paragraph of this definition.

Definition of Family In Zoning

●
●
●
●

●

Everyone in a household has to be a single nonprofit houskeeping unit.
But: Dwellings can not be occupied by more than 3 unrelated individuals: a
pair of student couples can not share a 2-bedroom apartment.
Puts limits on more distant relatives living together (e.g. cousins are not
“within the second degree of kinship”)
Language is unclear about how households which are partially within kinship
and partially outside should be treated (can a fiancé move in with a family of
3?)
The language explicitly excludes handicapped persons.

Packet Pg. 4

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

What does this mean?

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Why?
Historically, these guidelines were considered necessary to ‘address
family needs’:
"A quiet place where yards are wide, people few, and motor
vehicles restricted are legitimate guidelines in a land-use
project addressed to family needs," according to the U.S.
Supreme Court in Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1,
9, 94 S Ct 1536, 39 L Ed 2d 797 (1974)
While an ideal perhaps well-suited to some communities, this clearly
describes very little of what family life looks like in Cambridge, where
the vast majority of families live in multi-family dwellings; fewer than
9% of homes are “single family”.
Packet Pg. 5

●
●
●

These types of restrictions have taken many forms
In many different cases, they have been struck down by courts (in the US
Supreme Court as well as State Courts, and others)
Legal concerns include:
○
○
○
○

Providing appropriate due process under the Constitution
Matching the definition of the language to the primary intent of zoning
Privacy concerns regarding requiring residents to identify their familial relationships
Any conflicts with state code

Packet Pg. 6

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Legal Considerations

“Degree of Kinship” as a way to restrict families has been explicitly regarded as
likely a violation of Due Process by the Supreme Court, and may mean
Cambridge’s current “second degree of kinship” text is unconstitutional:
"The tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins, and especially
grand-parents sharing a household along with parents and
children has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of
constitutional recognition." 431 U.S. at 504. Due process,
then, would seem to require that any such definition eliminate
distinctions among familial degrees. (Moore v. City of East
Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977))

Packet Pg. 7

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Degrees of Kinship

Many state court cases have attempted to narrow the role that definitions of family
may take, e.g. McMinn v. Town of Oyster Bay in New York Supreme Court:
"Manifestly, restricting occupancy of single-family housing based generally on the
biological or legal relationships between its inhabitants bears no reasonable
relationship to the goals of reducing parking and traffic problems, controlling
population density and preventing noise and disturbance...”
-

66 N.Y.2d 544, 498 N.Y.S.2d 128 (1985)

Packet Pg. 8

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Primary Considerations of Zoning

In California, similar language to Cambridge’s law was found to violate an
expectation of privacy which is enshrined in California’s State Constitution:
Defendants shared a ten-bedroom house owned by one of the defendants. The
defendant's property was situated in a zoning district permitting only single-family
use.The governing ordinance defined "family" as either persons related by blood,
marriage or legal adoption, or a group of up to five persons living together as a single
housekeeping unit. The California Supreme Court found that the ordinance infringed
upon the right of privacy guaranteed by the state constitution. Adopting a "strict
scrutiny" standard of review,' the Court concluded that the city failed to demonstrate a
compelling public interest to justify the restriction.

Packet Pg. 9

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Privacy Concerns

●
●
●

Cambridge’s language calls out a distinction for handicapped persons
This is to eliminate concerns of discrimination under a protected class under
the Fair Housing Act
When your law needs an explicit disclaimer in order to not discriminate
against handicapped persons, this may be a sign it is having unintended side
effects against non-handicapped persons

Packet Pg. 10

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Fair Housing Act: Handicapped Persons

●

●

Zoning should be used to “promote the health, safety, convenience, or
general welfare of the part of the city affected” (Nectow vs. City of Cambridge
(1928))
Whether individuals living in a household are related by kinship does not, on
its own, affect the general welfare
○

●
●
●

Any enforcement of family relationships is an unnecessary violation of privacy

Protect households from risky housing situations
Cambridge’s goal for families isn’t “A quiet place where yards are wide,
people few...”
Our goal should be to provide safe, legal housing options for traditional
and non-traditional households which meet their needs
Packet Pg. 11

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

What should our goal be?

●
●
●
●
●
●

Individuals living alone
Traditional family: married or single parents with children
Foster families: parents (with or without biological children) caring for foster
children
Long-term cohabitation: 2 or more unmarried individuals in a relationship,
possibly including children
Transitional living situations, such as group living supporting individuals
recovering from alcohol or drug abuse.
Communal living: unrelated group of individuals living as a single shared
household, performing e.g. shared household duties like cooking and
cleaning
Packet Pg. 12

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Some Types of Households

●

Best to have number of bedrooms scale to household size
○

●

No strict definition of number of individuals will match a given household
○

●

This doesn’t mean every household member needs a bedroom, but maximizing options to
provide appropriate sized housing is important!
Every family unit from a single individual up to extended families of a dozen may all be
appropriate in some homes in Cambridge

Defining household size strictly would conflict with the general welfare
○

The homes built in Cambridge feature households of varying sizes that likely can not be filled
by traditional family units alone

Packet Pg. 13

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Household/Home Size

●
●

Cambridge is host to a large number of large apartments on the rental market:
5% of rental listings on Zillow have 5 or more bedrooms; 12% have 4 or more.
Average family size in Cambridge is 2.8 individuals -- that is, an average
family has only 1 child
○

●
●

Average household size is even smaller -- only 2.1 individuals/household

With limited numbers of families with children, homes like this largely result in
“over-housing” if used solely by families with children
Opening up larger housing to non-traditional living arrangements can
better match large apartments to meet housing demands

Packet Pg. 14

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Example: Larger Apartments

●
●
●

More than 100 of Cambridge’s Single Family Homes have greater than 6
bedrooms
These homes are poorly suited to most Cambridge families
Median property value for these homes is $3.3M (2018 assessment data)
○

●
●

A two-income family would need two adults making $320k/year each to make this affordable

These homes are not a good fit to any but the wealthiest of traditional families
but…
These homes are a good fit for non-traditional households

Packet Pg. 15

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Example: Larger Homes

●

Non-traditional households with no options not legally protected
○

●
●
●

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Legal Protections
Some landlords limit leases to 3 unrelated individuals

Without being on the lease, tenants have limited legal recourse
Risks of threatening inspection/reporting
Arbitrary enforcement used as a threat against tenants

Packet Pg. 16

●

Concern of turning apartments into lodging houses
○

●
●

Lodging houses are a positive for affordable housing in the community, but may deserve
different treatment than single households

Habitability Standards
Overall housing supply

Packet Pg. 17

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Responding to Concerns Around General Welfare

●
●

Current definition includes “living as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit”
This text would prevent lodging house situations -- situations where a set of
renters all individually rent from a common landlord/have no property interest
○

These situations would not typically operate as a single, non-profit housekeeping unit

Packet Pg. 18

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Lodging Houses

●
●

Statewide building codes set habitation standards (105
CMR 410.400)
Set minimum requirements on how much space is needed
per person in shared dwellings
○

●

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Habitability Standards

“Every dwelling unit shall contain at least 150 square feet of floor
space for its first occupant, and at least 100 square feet of floor
space for each additional occupant, the floor space to be calculated
on the basis of total habitable room area.”

These minimum standards are similar to existing
micro-units
○
○

Studios in 88 Ames go down to 347 sqft
More aggressive microunit proposals nationwide go down to 200-250
sqft per unit

Packet Pg. 19

●
●
●
●

Overhoused students: unable to fill rooms without legal risk!
Shared housing is most effective
More appropriate use of larger homes may produce better match of
individuals to homes
Cambridge is drastically underproducing housing to meet the needs of a
growing population

Packet Pg. 20

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Housing Supply

Cambridge’s zoning language should define a “family” as:
Family. One or more persons occupying a dwelling unit and living as a single nonprofit
housekeeping unit. ; provided that a group of four or more persons who are not within
the second degree of kinship shall not be deemed to constitute a family.
Notwithstanding the definition in the preceding paragraph, a family shall be deemed to
include four or more persons not within the second degree of kinship occupying a
dwelling unit and living as a single, nonprofit housekeeping unit, if said occupants are
handicapped persons as defined in Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as
amended by the "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988." Such unrelated individuals
shall have the right to occupy a dwelling unit in the same manner and to the same
extent as any family in the first paragraph of this definition.
Packet Pg. 21

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Definition of Family In Zoning

●

Cambridge Zoning code defines 3 types of housing:
○
○

○

Family housing
Group quarters (defined but not used): “ A living arrangement for groups containing four or
more persons not related to the person in charge.”
■ This orphaned definition seems largely irrelevant; while not directly addressed, removing
this definition from the zoning code entirely is not out of the question.
Lodging house: “A dwelling where lodgings are let to four or more persons not within the
second degree of kinship to the person conducting it, including fraternity housing but not
including dormitories or charitable, educational or philanthropic institutions.”
■ Lodging houses differ from “family” households in that they are not a single non-profit
entity.
■ The definition of lodging house in this way has been invalidated in court cases in MA in
the past. (City of Worcester v. College Hill Properties, LLC, et al., 2013)
Packet Pg. 22

Communication: Family Zoning_20200310 (Family Definition)

Comparison to Other Housing Types

●

●

While CDD expressed concerns from ISD of enforcement, existing
enforcement seems almost non-existent, and can only be unfairly applied
today
CDD recommends legal review -- but existing standards for both Lodging
House and Family conflict with State and US Supreme Court cases on the
language: clearly legal review of this language has not been a high priority
○

●

While City Staff review of the language is welcome, it seems unlikely to identify that changing
this language establishes significant new risk.

Unclear distinctions between housing types already exist: this language does
little to change that standard (other than overlapping with unused “group
quarters” definition).
