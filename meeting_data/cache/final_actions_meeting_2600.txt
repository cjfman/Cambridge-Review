SECURITY - REQUIREMENTS

Michael Latulippe, our Director of Compliance will be leading our efforts in both prevention of diversion to
minors, public health initiatives, as well as educational efforts aimed at preventing adolescent cannabis use.
In addition to implementing comprehensive educational programs aimed at decreasing underage use, the
following efforts will be made to further decrease the risk of diversion to minors:
• Child resistant and tamper-proof packaging, with multiple warning labels
• No sale of any product resembling a realistic or fictional human, animal, or fruit, including artistic, caricature,
or cartoon renderings
• All Employees licensed by state, over the age of 21, and must not have been convicted of distribution of
controlled substances to minors
• Redundant ID checks with 50-state electronic scanner technology
• In the event ADVESA discovers any of its agents intentionally or negligently sold marijuana to an individual
under the age of 21, the agent will be immediately terminated and the CCC will be promptly notified.
• Entire premises camera coverage, with video tie-in to Cambridge PD and one-site surveillance staff.

Communication: 966 Cambridge St_20200121 (PB-357)

SECURITY - PREVENTION OF DIVERSION TO MINORS

After our initial community engagement meeting, and hearing concerns about the congestion in the area
around the facility at school opening and closing times, the Advesa Team initially proposed to close the
facility during those hours.
After hearing more input from the community, the Team realized that there were operational obstacles to
this plan, as well as several likely unintended consequences:
• It would be difficult to close the facility while customers were still engaged in sales transactions.
• Closing the facility could very well lead to customers waiting near the store, on the sidewalk, or in cars,

taking up parking spaces.

• We listened to the community, and we learned, and we hope that this kind of engagement with the

community will continue, if and when the facility is open for business.

Packet Pg. 23

Communication: 966 Cambridge St_20200121 (PB-357)

REDUCING CONGESTION

Our new proposals to address and reduce congestion include the following, which we are willing to make a
part of the Host Community Agreement or any other agreement with the City:
• The hours of operation will be no more than 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., seven days a week. We may well
reduce those hours of operation, but not exceed them. The store will not be open during school opening
hours. The store will not schedule any customers during school closing hours, from 3:00 to 3:30 p.m., or
similar periods during early release days.
• For the first 30 days of operation, the store only will be open to customers on an appointment-only basis.
• We will use the latest technology in web applications to schedule customers at specific times, and to reduce
business during the school closing hours, for example- Waitwhile, which will allow us to book customers at
specific times and permit those customers to avoid waiting in line.
• Advesa will work with the City to ensure a school crossing guard is present at the intersection of Cambridge
and Windsor Streets during school opening and closing hours.
Packet Pg. 24

Communication: 966 Cambridge St_20200121 (PB-357)

REDUCING CONGESTION

• The Advesa Team will not permit customers to loiter around the store. We will engage local

businesses to accept Advesa Advantage coupons that can be redeemed when patronizing
local businesses, reimbursed to those businesses by Advesa on a monthly basis. AA coupons
will be given to bikers, MBTA riders, and potential customers to encourage them to return to
the store at a later time, which avoids waiting in line and encourages shopping within the
community.

• The Advesa Team will include a Community Engagement Director to address any complaints

from the community. All abutters will have access to a specific number and email address to
contact the Community Engagement Director.

• For at least the first year of operations, Advesa will host quarterly community engagement

meetings to hear concerns from neighboring residents and businesses.

Packet Pg. 25

Communication: 966 Cambridge St_20200121 (PB-357)

REDUCING CONGESTION

• Cambridge has opted for a 3% local sales tax on marijuana products sold at marijuana

retailers.

• There is also expected to be a Community Impact Fee, no more than 3% of total gross sales.
• The City Manager will be able to negotiate other benefits for the City of Cambridge, and

further restrictions that will benefit the public health and safety.

Packet Pg. 26

Communication: 966 Cambridge St_20200121 (PB-357)

COMMUNITY BENEFITS -- HOST COMMUNITY AGREEMENT

All ADVESA MA employees have experience in the unique challenges
associated with EE employment. We are very excited to bring this
expertise to retail operations in Cambridge.
The following employment criteria will be applied:
• 15-25 employees anticipated initially
• 75% will be hired from disproportionately impacted communities as
determined by the Cannabis Control Commission
• 25%. of employees will be local hire, with a social equity focus.
• Will employ individuals with previous non-violent marijuana
convictions.
• 15% of shelf space reserved for Economic Empowerment and
Social Equity companies.

Packet Pg. 27

Communication: 966 Cambridge St_20200121 (PB-357)

COMMUNITY BENEFITS -- EMPLOYMENT

• In addition to the host community agreement requirements, ADVESA is mandated to develop
training and educational programs for individuals residing in areas of disproportionate impact.
ADVESA will be working on developing these programs in the Boston metro area with individuals
harmed by marijuana prohibition.
• ADVESA will provide business mentorship classes once a month for qualifying social equity
entrepreneurs including training, free services, and insight from local and international industry
leaders.
• ADVESA will also offer regular “office hours” once a month in an open location within the City, to
provide free support services that assist residents with expunging Controlled Substances Act
records so they can reduce barriers to employment.
