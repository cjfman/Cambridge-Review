MEMORANDUM
To:

Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager

From:

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development

Date:

March 27, 2018

Re:

Policy Order O-8 dated March 19, 2018 regarding applying to
designate certain census tracts as Opportunity Zones

The Commonwealth recently completed a process through which cities with
qualified census tracts could nominate those tracts to be considered for
designation as Opportunity Zones. Under the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act,
Opportunity Zones are areas in which tax-advantaged investment can be made
for the benefit communities with lower income residents. As states can
designate up to 25% of qualified census tracts as Opportunity Zones, up to 138
census tracts could be so designated in Massachusetts. The Governor must
submit the list of census tracts to be designated as Opportunity Zones to the
U.S. Treasury Department by April 19th.
The Opportunity Zone program offers tax incentives for investments to
advance community development objectives in lower income communities.
Investors with unrealized capital gains tax liability can defer and reduce this tax
liability, and additionally avoid capital gains on investment returns in
Opportunity Zones. Eligible investments are made in Opportunity Funds which
can be used to make equity investments in real estate and equipment. Based
on our experience with Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investment, we would
expect that investing in Opportunity Zones in the city would be an attractive
opportunity which could allow access to new capital which could assist with
the affordable housing efforts in the city.

Opportunity Zone investments could, for example, assist the Cambridge
Housing Authority with modernization efforts in the nominated tracts. On
behalf of the City, CDD has nominated two tracts for consideration for
Opportunity Zones designation, the maximum allowed in the city given how
the Commonwealth will allocate Opportunity Zones among municipalities. We
expect to know by the end of April if the Cambridge designations are included
the Commonwealth’s recommendations.

Please Add Item to City Council Agenda

Peace Be Unto You,
Dear Ms. Lopez, please add the following item to t he upcoming city council agenda, thank you:

Peace Be Unto You,
During last Monday evening City Council meeting, nine of the municipal policy makers voted to adopt POR#3,
inspite of my public comment urging them to halt or delay their responses to POR#3. POR#3 is a request to
“appoint an appropriate City representative to work with the Historical Commission, the Veterans Services
Department, representatives of the Cambridge African American Heritage Trail, Cambridge Historian Jon Hill,
and any other appropriate parties in an effort to place markers on the graves of Mr. Cato Freeman and Mr.
Neptune Frost at the Old Harvard Square Burial Ground, a marker for Mr. Agrippa Hull on the Cambridge
Common, and markers for any other early unsung patriots of color that we may yet determine have been
hidden in the shadows of history for far too long.” My public comment was a plea to the council to first
publicly share the progress that is being made with a project that was one of the declared 2017 Community
Preservation Act (CPA) competition winning funded projects (“Historical and African American Trails Markers,
etc.,). My concern is that this COA winning project encompasses the same goals stated in POR#3.
POR#3 didn’t include bringing any of those to the table that voted for this winning CPA project, that was
funded for $30,000. Was the sponsor of POR#3 aware of the fact that there was money already awarded for
these historical preservation improvements, or is this another attempt to do the same thing. If so that is why it
is necessary to go public with the progress being made with implementing 2017 CPA competition winning
funded projects (“Historical and African American Trails Markers, etc.,).
Those who voted in the 2017 CPA competition for the winning project, the author of the winning project,
along with the residents and citizenry of Cambridge are entitled to some type of public clarification of this
matter, which wasn’t forth coming at the council meeting (3/26/18). Those who participated in the voting
phases of the 2017 CPA project competition are great residents and citizens, appointments of representatives
given in the listing of POR#3 is not all inclusive, as long as this matter concerning the winning CPA project is
not clarified.
Therefore I implore the city manager and the city council to step forward with an adequate degree of
transparency on this issue and my concerns.
Yours In Peace

Gas powered blowers

I'm in favor of banning use of gas powered blowers in Cambridge neighborhoods. The blowers are simply too noisy. I
have difficulties working from home due to the noise outside coming from gas leaf blowers. I was unable to hear phone
calls and participate in conference calls due to the noise. Part of the problem also is the that landscaping crews often fire
up multiple leaf blowers at once!!

LivableStreets comment re: POR 2018 #28, Central Square pedestrian crossing

Office of City Clerk:
On behalf of LivableStreets Alliance, I would like to comment in favor of the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation
Department’s recommendation for a “Super Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPI)” at the intersection of Massachusetts
Avenue, Prospect Street, and River Street.
TPT’s proposed 15-second headstart for pedestrians is well-above the typical LPI standard (3-7 seconds) and even
exceeds NACTO’s recommendation for 10-second-long LPI’s in busy pedestrian zones. We are confident that a Super LPI
will maintain pedestrian safety while balancing the needs of all other road users - motorists, cyclists, and transit riders at this busy intersection. Further, other alternatives, such as an exclusive, “all-way” pedestrian crossing would likely
lengthen traffic cycle times, discourage compliance with traffic lights, and thereby decrease pedestrian safety in Central
Square.
Lastly, we are confident that TPT will effectively evaluate the safety of this crossing in the future and revisit this issue if
or when needed. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
Sincerely,
Andrew McFarland

WalkBoston Support for Central Square Super LPI

To: Cambridge City Council, Cambridge City Clerk, Joe Barr - Director Cambridge TPT
From: Wendy Landman, Executive Director WalkBoston
WalkBoston believes that TPT's suggested change for the Central Square Pedestrian Signals will provide improved
pedestrian safety. As described in the March 21 Memorandum from Joseph Barr, the Super LPI will provide an effective
way of managing this high volume intersection.
WalkBoston agrees with TPT's analysis of the situation and with the conclusion that a concurrent signal phasing with a
longer LPI is the best overall solution. We concur with the finding that an ALL WALK signal phase would not be
appropriate for Central Square and would lead to lower levels of service for pedestrians, and confusion among both
pedestrians and drivers.
WalkBoston also appreciates TPT's plan to review operations after the Super LPI is installed.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this signal revision.

City Council; City Manager; Lopez, Donna; 'Cambridge Bicycle Safety'
Bicycling with My Child in Cambridge

To the Cambridge City Council:
I appreciate all the work you are doing to design and create protected bicycle lanes and other safety measures for
cyclists and pedestrians.
I live in North Cambridge, and I’ve cycled through the city for 38 years. I am writing to tell you my story of biking with my
child, and to let you know that your work on this issue is critical.
Here is my story:
When my child was small, we rode a cargo bike with her in the front box. It is a brilliant bike, well-designed for transport
of children and groceries, good over bumps, easy to handle and park.
Our family policy when transporting our child was to avoid Massachusetts Ave. at all costs, sticking with quiet streets.
Traveling with our kid, we couldn’t take the risk of being squeezed between fast-moving cars on the left and parked cars
on the right.
One day I had to ride Mass. Ave. for just a single block North of Rindge before turning onto Day Street to Davis Square.
Traffic was quiet. I rode slowly and carefully, keeping an eye on the parked cars to the right, but suddenly—really
suddenly—a driver in a parked car on the right threw her door wide, grazing the side of the box next to my kid.
Thankfully, it did not stop us completely. I wobbled and swerved, then stopped just ahead. Thank goodness the streets
were quiet. Had there been traffic approaching me from behind, we could have been crunched by moving cars on our
left.
I was nearly hysterical. I held my tongue because my daughter was watching wide-eyed, but I told the driver just how
close a call it was. That we could have been badly hurt. That she nearly hit us, not just our bike. That we could have been
pushed into the road and hit again. I made the motorist promise to always check, in the future, before opening her door.
By that time, the driver was nearly hysterical, too. She promised she would never open the door again without looking.
Thinking back, it was almost comical, both of us shrieking in shared terror, agreeing with each other.
But my child or I could easily—EASILY—have lost our lives that day in a single, brief departure from our usual route. A
one-block stretch of Mass. Ave. in a quiet moment.
Cyclists—especially those cycling with children—know plenty of workarounds, getting from point A to point B. But there
are limits to complicated workarounds; at some point, we have to use major streets to get somewhere. Massachusetts
Ave. and other streets can and should be safer for everyone.
Reported accidents are easy to track, but near-accidents and close calls, not so much. For every one of these stories told,
I guarantee there are hundreds more. I am a careful rider, not a speed demon. I follow the rules of the road and signal
my turns, slows, and stops. Yet I have had countless terrifying experiences over the years, including being cut off by
motorists, passed by motorists with only inches to spare, nearly doored, ignored to the point of near-collision, and a

couple of incidents hitting the ground but came out unscathed. We all know that distracted driving makes these things
more and more likely, and deadly.

I know mixed use of our streets is a constant challenge, and it’s easy to give up or cede to one interest or another. Yet
the bicycle plan includes a citywide network of protected bicycle lanes. This will give families and individuals options for
crossing the city safely, without having to debate whether a single unprotected block on Massachusetts Avenue is worth
the risk. That day a few years ago? It wasn’t worth the risk.
You know that it can be deadly, as cyclists continue to be squeezed between parked cars and fast-moving cars. It has
made it a chronic emergency for decades—at least as long as I’ve ridden here, and it’s made worse by traffic congestion
and distracted driving. It’s become untenable.
On the implementation of protected bike lanes, we need you to press on and get this done.
Thank you for reading.

We are a one-car family. It’s important to us to keep our footprint small and our expenses low, and we drive as little as
possible. We enjoy the health benefits of riding and walking. We love the T. Cycling is convenient: Parking is typically
easier, and even careful cyclists know that the quickest way between two points in Cambridge is often the bicycle.

No to the proposed moratorium on development at Alewife!

Dear Councillors,
I'm reaching out to express my strong opposition to the proposed moratorium on development at Alewife.
This moratorium would harm Cambridge by having terrible impacts on the already difficult challenge of
creating affordable housing in our community. Cambridge's diversity--cultural, racial, religious, and
socioeconomic--is one of the major reasons I chose to buy a home and raise my family in Cambridge, and I
would hate to see the community lose what makes it most vibrant and unique by pushing out all but the
wealthiest. This moratorium could stop more than 500 urgently needed units of Cambridge housing,
including over 100 affordable homes.
The moratorium would also put a halt to the important efforts around ecologically friendly and transitoriented development, and could actually cause us to lose state funding to fix congestion challenges in this
part of our city. Some have argued that the Alewife area is too congested for new development. However, it
is estimated over 80% of the traffic in this area originates outside of Cambridge. Developments close to
transport options could in fact improve traffic as people move in closer to jobs and public transit options.
New residential development provides opportunities to develop smarter and to make changes that will help
our transportation infrastructure, create green space, improve traffic flow, and generally make our
neighborhoods stronger.
A moratorium is a step backwards and does nothing but hurt our progress on some of the most important
issues facing our city. Cambridge has been a leader in progressive solutions to affordable housing, the
environment, and transit, and we cannot set a precedent by turning our backs on that legacy.
Thank you in advance for considering these thoughts,
Annie Michaelis

No to Alewife moratorium on development

This is the time for affordable housing, amenities near public transit, and developments that increase sustainability. A
moratorium is at odds with these much needed investments.
I feel lucky to be able to live near transit, in Cambridge. It’s enhanced my economic mobility, it’s gotten me closer to
jobs, and it’s grown my sense of community with those that live nearby. Mid-rise, mixed-use, and inclusive
developments will help our metro area continue to thrive.
Please do not vote for a moratorium on development in Alewife.

2 new Planning Board members, CMA 1 (2018 #65), 3/26/18

Dear Mayor McGovern, Vice Mayor Devereux and City Councillors:
I hope that the City’s CDD and Law Dept. personnel orient and educate the new Planning Board members about our
Zoning Ordinance so that they understand and appreciate at least the basic processes and standards before they are
called upon to decide particular cases.
That’s especially so if the new members have limited “technical background, interest and understanding of development,
architecture, urban design, and zoning,” which were said to be desirable (though not required) attributes in the City
Manager’s notice seeking volunteers.

Members of the City Council,

March 27, 2018
To the Council,
As a resident I am writing to ask that you oppose the moratorium on
development at Alewife.
Attachment: Joan Squeri Alewife City Council (COM 277 #2018 : Joan Squeri)

A moratorium on ‘development’ broadly, will effectively block the way for a
very well vetted, environmentally-sound project by Homeowners Rehab, one of
Cambridge’s two developers of affordable housing from being realized. What a
tragic mistake that would be!
Projects such as this take many years to plan, and involve the co-ordination
of a multitude funding streams; opportunities for a Cambridge C.DC. such as this,
come along rarely. When finished, this project will provide over one hundred units
of affordable housing, at a time when the need for such units is critical.
It is possible for Cambridge to build density around public transportation
hubs, which include more units of affordable housing, while preserving the
environment and improving access to transportation and shopping for people.
This project checks all of those boxes.
The existing shopping centers and the traffic routes that currently dominate
Ailewife were designed in an era when the movement of cars was prioritized over
that of people.
Rather than preserving those past ‘car-centered’ design mistakes by putting
‘a freeze on development,’ it makes sense to use the opportunity to rethink the area
with a pedestrian /public transportation lifestyle in mind. Many established
Cambridge residents will benefit, as well as new families looking to access all of
these existing resources by foot and by bike.
By refusing to ‘freeze things as they are’, you will make it possible for people
of all incomes and backgrounds to live, shop and recreate in nature, in future.
Yours sincerely,
Joan Squeri

Upgrade Cambridge calls for universal access to a neutral internet

To Mayor Marc McGovern and the Honorable, the City Council:

Upgrade Cambridge thanks Mayor Marc McGovern for signing on to Mayors for Net Neutrality. Net neutrality,
which the ACLU calls one of the foremost free speech issues of our times, would require internet service
providers to treat all internet content equally.
When 50% of Cambridge’s low income households report that they don’t have access to any network, the
community has work to do. Upgrade Cambridge believes that everyone should have access to the internet
through a neutral internet service provider. We believe that municipal broadband is the best way to guarantee
that access and keep it neutral. The protection of internet speech should not just be for those who can afford it.
A free and just Internet requires access for all as well as protection for those who already have the privilege of
access.

please oppose a moratorium on alewife development

I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the petition calling for a moratorium on housing development in the Alewife area. I
believe that the housing affordability crisis in our city and region is a direct consequence of overly strict zoning that has prohibited
development of denser housing. Housing is especially needed in transit-rich neighborhoods like Alewife that allow people to reach
school and work without long car-based commutes. I'm also convinced that a moratorium at Alewife would be particularly ill-timed,
given the new opportunity to apply for state-level grant funding to build infrastructure improvements (such as a bridge over the
commuter rail tracks) in neighborhoods supporting new growth and more affordable housing.
I sincerely hope that you do not allow a development moratorium to proceed, and in fact hope to see the council adopt a more
permissive attitude to housing development of all kinds in neighborhoods with ready access to public transit.
Sincerely,
Ira Nichols-Barrer

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that National Public Health Week is
celebrated across the country from April 2–8 with an ongoing focus on making the
United States the healthiest nation in one generation; and

WHEREAS:

All people deserve the opportunity to live long, healthy and productive lives, but in the
U.S. today, significant and life-threatening disparities in health care access, disease
burden, premature death, and infant mortality persist across our communities and
between neighborhoods only a few miles apart; this is unacceptable in a country as
wealthy and medically advanced as ours; and

WHEREAS:

Recognizing the value of a strong public health system, Cambridge has made
substantial investments in public health, health care, and other initiatives that prevent
illness from occurring in the first place—when Cambridge received the inaugural
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Prize in 2013, the city became
part of a national movement to change how communities think about health; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge has moved toward a model in which local government and the community
are genuine partners in improving health; this spirit of collaboration is evidenced in the
city’s Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), now in its third year of
implementation, in which people from many different sectors came together to develop
strategies to identify the city’s major health needs and develop feasible solutions; and

WHEREAS:

Over 30 city agencies and organizations are making tangible progress in the four CHIP
health priority areas for the city: mental health and substance abuse; violence; healthy,
safe, and affordable housing; and healthy eating and active living; and

WHEREAS:

Despite the challenges ahead, Cambridge will continue to make significant inroads in
improving the health and well-being of all residents; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record as proclaiming April 2–8, 2018, as Cambridge
Public Health Week in appreciation of the extensive work on the part of the public and
private sectors in the city to promote healthy living, prevent disease and injury, and
respond to threats to our well-being; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Clerk be and hereby requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of
this resolution to Claude-Alix Jacob, Chief Public Health Officer at the Cambridge

WHEREAS:

The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), recently came to
Cambridge in order to visit the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and
Harvard University as part of a national tour of the country; and

WHEREAS:

According to a press release from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, the visit was
focused on “nurturing ties between the private sector and academia of the two nations”;
and

WHEREAS:

MbS rose to power through incredibly undemocratic means which included the
detainment of more than 200 princes, ministers, and businessmen as well as prominent
scholars and critics; and

WHEREAS:

MbS is considered the architect of Saudi Arabia’s intervention in the Yemeni Civil
War, which has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian crises on the entire planet;
and

WHEREAS:

Saudi Arabia is one of the most repressive regimes in the Middle East, particularly
towards women and religious minorities, and while MbS has introduced some minor
reforms (e.g. allowing women to drive), he has not shown any intentions to truly
liberate the country; and

WHEREAS:

Saudi Arabia continues to rely on selling oil as the basis for its economy, despite the
clear and present danger of climate change to the entire planet, and uses the wealth it
derives from oil sales to purchase weapons and wage war; and

WHEREAS:

MIT and Harvard University typically allow for more dialogue and discussion when
controversial figures come to campus, yet MbS’s visit was shrouded in an unusual
level of secrecy; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

Sexual assault on college and university campuses is an epidemic that affects 1 in 5
women and 1 in 16 men; and

WHEREAS:

Despite these large numbers, sexual assault remains one of the most widely
underreported crimes, with estimates that only 10% of victims will ever report to
authorities; and

WHEREAS:

This underreporting and lack of knowledge is its own policy problem, which prompted
the creation of a 2014 White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual
Assault, which recommended that colleges and universities implement a Campus
Climate Survey as a first step to gather information and concrete data about this
problem; and

WHEREAS:

An anonymous climate survey would be particularly helpful in viewing both statewide
and campus specific trends over time, identifying areas in which schools could provide
more resources, and giving survivors and their allies a confidential but powerful
platform to speak about their experiences; and

WHEREAS:

This legislative term, Representative Lori Ehrlich re-introduced Massachusetts Resolve
H.4159, "Resolve creating a task force on sexual misconduct climate surveys for
colleges and universities in Massachusetts"; and

Representative Ehrlich was joined by 20 co-sponsors, including members of the

favorably out of the Joint Committee on Higher Education; and

WHEREAS:

On a national level, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s rollback of the Obama

supportive of any steps taken that either improve a survivor’s experience in the
reporting process or prevent sexual assault altogether; now therefore be it

That the City Council go on record in support of Massachusetts Resolve H.4159,

April 2, 2018
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX
WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that City officials are considering
permitting autonomous vehicle (AV), aka “self-driving cars” testing on city streets, as
part of a regional AV testing structure that is being developed by the Metropolitan
Area Planning Council and the Metropolitan Mayors Coalition of Greater Boston, in
coordination with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Governor’s
Office; and

WHEREAS:

A pedestrian in Arizona was killed by an AV operated by Uber on March 18, 2018, the
first such fatality on record; and

WHEREAS:

Preliminary information suggests that Uber was testing the modified Volvo with its
built-in safety features turned off, and with only a single test driver who appears to
have been distracted just prior to the crash; and

WHEREAS:

Waymo, nuTonomy, Optimus Ride and Delphi (renamed Aptiv), have lodged millions
of miles of AV testing in cities across the world, including Boston, with a stellar safety
record; and

WHEREAS:

Recent traffic fatality data indicates that the fatality rate has increased in recent years
despite a decline in vehicle ownership and significant improvements in vehicle safety
technology including collision avoidance, automatic braking, and adaptive cruise
control; and

WHEREAS:

There are no clear federal or state guidelines for allowing AV testing on public roads;
and

WHEREAS:

There is considerable potential to reduce pedestrian and bicycle collisions and fatalities
through the use of AV technology; now therefore be it
