Neighborhood-Based
Transportation Data
Data show a clear picture of how travel
has changed in Cambridge
• COVID-19 response measures have impacted neighborhoods
differently and there is no one citywide story
• We used a pre-COVID-19 date or week as the baseline
comparison, as the region remains in pandemic response:

• Not comparable to the same month in 2019
• Transportation data typically varies by season - less evident this year
as school, university, and large events are cancelled or postponed
• For work commuters, different industries have different COVID-19
response measures – e.g. work at home, alternating schedules
• Baseline is slightly different for each dataset but represents a typical
working day in late February or early March

Central Square Area
• Bluebikes trips have increased significantly
since April but are about half of last year’s
counts.
• Driving is about 70% of the baseline
• Buses remain less than 30% of “typical”
ridership; Red Line is less than 20% of “typical”
• Walking also 30% of “typical”, assumed to be
linked to decreased ridership on rapid transit
and buses

• Evaluating more bus lanes
• Bus lanes mean more reliable bus service and less delay
• Bus lanes also mean crowding can be minimized from
“bunched” buses
• Evaluating bus lanes at various locations on Mass Ave
based on Awaiting Report 20-18
• Evaluating opportunities on additional high-ridership
corridors, including Western Avenue

• Expanded bus stop areas
• MBTA has provided bus stop ridership data to city
• Identifying locations where bus ridership remains
durable and physical distancing is very difficult due to
bus stop conditions

COVID-19 Initial Service Response & Key Takeaways
Public Transit Impact:
• Decreased ridership
• lower workforce availability
• Increased uncertainty
Reaffirmed & modified service principles:
• Provide services for essential trips
• Increase flexibility, but still be predictable and reliable
• Support physical distancing for employees and customers
where possible
• Strongly encourage essential travel only
Key takeaways:
• Non-uniform ridership changes
• Value of “real-time” data to adjust service
• Definition of crowding has changed

Summer Service & Planning for Fall
Summer Service (effective June 21st) – added & adjusted service based on ridership
• Subway: Operate 100% of normal weekday service, depending on workforce availability
• Bus & Silver Line: Operate 100% of weekday service hours, but concentrate on 80% of routes
• For example: Route 1 (+63 trips), Route 66 (+44 trips), Route 70 (+36 trips)

• Maintain flexibility: 70% of service scheduled, with 30% flexible to run on routes as needed

• Commuter Rail: 85% of normal service, with Fairmount Line with 8 additional trips
• Ferry: Restart service at 75% of regular weekday service to Hingham, Hull, and Charlestown
• The RIDE: Continue to operate full service

Fall Service Planning
• Continue to temporarily rebalance service levels to match new demand patterns
• Continued ridership rebound on durable ridership routes
• Slower rebound on commuter-oriented routes or areas with more telework opportunities

Rapid Response Bus Priority Program
Program Rationale:
• Accelerated bus lane implementation to
address service needs
• Improve service frequency to maintain
better social distancing
• Maintain access for essential workers and
at-need populations as the region re-opens

Focused on routes/corridors with:
• Durable ridership during pandemic
• Crowding during pandemic
• Chronic delay pre-pandemic
