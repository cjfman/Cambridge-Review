RE:

Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance – Proposed Amendments

SANDRA CLARKE
Deputy Director
Chief of Administration

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Please find attached proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance. The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
adopted in 2014 and requires energy and water reporting from commercial
properties over 25,000 square feet and residential properties over 50 units. This
regulates approximately 1,100 buildings in Cambridge which are responsible for
approximately 75% of the building sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The ordinance has successfully increased transparency and awareness of energy
and water consumption by the regulated buildings. BEUDO includes a provision
requiring that the Community Development Department review the impact of the
ordinance on energy performance of covered properties, and recommend
amendments to improve building energy performance if it has not improved
significantly. Analysis performed in 2018 concluded that energy performance of
covered properties had not improved significantly and therefore CDD initiated a
performance requirement policy development process with participation of over
35 unique entities, representing private commercial and residential building
owners, universities, affordable housing providers, and green building
professionals. The attached proposal is the result of this collaborative process.
These proposed BEUDO amendments are intended to introduce GHG
performance requirements for BEUDO properties and achieve science-based
GHG reductions consistent with other leading cities including Boston, New York,
and Washington D.C. The performance requirements:

Voice: 617 349-4600
Fax: 617 349-4669
TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

Eliminate GHG emissions from regulated properties by 2050, with the
following intermediate targets compared to an individual 2018-2019
baseline for most buildings:
o 20% by 2025
o 40% by 2030

o 60% by 2035
o 80% by 2040
o 90% by 2045
•

Provide multiple compliance pathways including energy efficiency
improvements, electrification, on-site renewable energy, off-site
renewable energy, electricity grid improvements, and alternative
compliance payments.

•

Provide flexibility including an optional early baseline to account for early
action, alternative compliance timeframes for laboratories and affordable
housing, and portfolio level compliance for campus owners and affordable
housing.

•

Leverage technical support and access to state and federal financial
incentives through the existing Building Energy Retrofit Program.

The attached proposal for amendments to BEUDO represents an essential step in
Cambridge’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. The Net Zero Action Plan
adopted in 2015 and updated in 2021 identifies BEUDO performance
requirements as an integral part of a comprehensive suite of actions which
together will phase out GHG emissions from new buildings, many existing
buildings, and much of the energy supply system in Cambridge. This Plan has
been created and updated by a Net Zero Task Force representing stakeholders
throughout the community and is being overseen by the Climate Protection
Advisory Committee. Both stakeholder groups have urged the prompt
advancement of strong BEUDO performance requirements.
We are pleased to present these amendments to move forward the discussion of
emission reductions from the largest buildings in Cambridge based on a
comprehensive and collaborative stakeholder engagement process.

COF 2022 #18
IN CITY COUNCIL
March 8, 2022
COUNCILLOR NOLAN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN

To: Cambridge City Council
From: Councillors Patricia Nolan and Quinton Zondervan
Date: 2/3/2022
Subject: Proposed Amendments to the Proposed BEUDO Amendments
Please find attached proposed changes to the draft Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance Amendments proposed by the Community Development Department on November 4,
2021. We are presenting to the City Council amendments we will be offering in advance of the
Ordinance meeting. These amendments are in line with the suggestions from the Climate Crisis
Working Group, the Climate Protection Action Committee, and members of the Net Zero Action
5-year Review Task Force. They are also a response to the urging of many community groups
with deep interest and understanding of Cambridge’s goals including Mothers Out Front, Green
Cambridge, and 350MA Cambridge-Somerville node. Finally, these amendments are in line with
the longstanding and key city goal of reducing emissions from buildings, mentioned in the
Climate Action Plan in 2002. The amendments are feasible and would put Cambridge in a
position to be a climate leader.
In the City of Cambridge, energy use in buildings accounts for the majority of
greenhouse gas emissions -- around 80%. In response to growing concerns about energy use and
climate change, the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was enacted by the
Cambridge City Council on July 28, 2014. This ordinance requires owners of larger buildings to
monitor and report annual building energy use to the City. This data is then categorized and
made available on the Cambridge Open Portal. The intention of this ordinance was to make
energy efficiency data publicly available, so that various users such as potential property buyers,
tenants, realtors, and others would make informed decisions and hopefully incentivize building
owners to reduce energy usage in their building stock. The original ordinance included a
mandate to review impact by 2018 and if the ordinance was not seeing reductions, to establish
performance requirements by 2019. The Council demonstrated foresight by including the
demand for performance requirements if necessary. Given the lack of progress on reductions,
such a change is necessary. Unfortunately, the requested 2019 change was not made then, instead
the addition of performance requirements was delayed until now -- allowing for several more
years of emissions growth. Since it is now clear that energy use disclosure is not enough,
ordinance amendments to introduce performance requirements are currently under consideration
by the City Council.
Packet Pg. 33

The proposed ordinance amendments require not only disclosure of building energy use,
but establish a schedule for reductions. As written, however, they fall short of the reductions
necessary to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. Currently, the amendments require each
BEUDO property to comply with Greenhouse Gas Emissions reduction requirements over a
course of 6 five-year compliance periods, resulting in net zero emissions by 2050. This timeline
should be accelerated to require net zero emissions by 2035. As the city’s overall goal is to reach
zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Commonwealth and the Paris agreement, allowing the
biggest source of emissions in Cambridge to continue polluting the atmosphere until 2050 would
put us in severe danger of failure. To date we have missed every single climate action deadline or
goal, and we have little reason to believe this time would be different. In addition, the more
pollution we allow before we get to zero, the more damage is done to the atmosphere and to our
climate. It’s therefore critical to our success in combating climate change that we set a more
stringent goal. We believe that net zero by 2035 is achievable for these buildings and gives us a
fighting chance to reach our overall zero emissions goal by 2050 for the city as a whole. Net zero
by 2035 for these buildings is also in line with the Council’s goal of achieving 100% clean and
renewable energy use for all of Cambridge by 2035, set through a policy order passed
unanimously by the City Council in 2017, and reaffirmed again unanimously in December of
2021. The language we will propose changes the target date for net zero to 2035, with an
accelerated emissions reduction schedule starting in 2025.
We further propose that the ordinance be changed to add a requirement that outliers with
significantly higher emissions than other buildings in their sector begin reductions from their
sector’s average baseline immediately. In other words, there should be a minimum threshold that
all BEUDO covered buildings must meet by 2025, then start their emissions reductions plans
from there. This requirement would ensure that the buildings that have not taken steps to reduce
emissions are incentivized to do so immediately.
The other changes we will be proposing are in line with the goal of the city to be an
environmental leader. The longer timeline and alternative compliance schedule for 100%
affordable housing projects should remain as is, but the longer timeline for labs does not align
with our city’s climate goals and should be deleted. Laboratory buildings should follow the same
timeline as other buildings and achieve net zero emissions by 2035. All electric, net zero ready
laboratory buildings are being built in our city right now; there is no justification for allowing
labs to continue contributing to the city’s GHG emissions past 2035.
Our proposed amendments will also simplify the ordinance by deleting complex
alternative compliance schedules and exemptions that would complicate enforcement and are not
necessary to achieve our climate action goals. Finally, our amendments leave in place the
Alternative Compliance Payment for buildings that are unable to reduce their emissions in time.
While we don’t believe that paying for polluting should be allowed indefinitely, in the short term
it is a reasonable mechanism that allows for flexibility, and the funds collected from these
payments would be used by the city to reduce emissions in other buildings.

Policy Element
GHG (MTCO2e) = Sum (energy x emission factor)
- Alternative Compliance Credits
Provided that any Renewable Electricity is subtracted
from electricity use.

Principles & Considerations
• Greenhouse gas
emission calculation
should reflect regional
conditions, provide
predictability, and
encompass off-site
measures taken by the
owner
•

The City will provide
buildings with this
annual calculation for
reference.

Attachment: BEUDO Overview Presentation for Ordinance 2-9-22 (15600 : A

Calculating GHG Emissions

a

• The City will publish emission factors in advance for each upcoming
compliance period, through regulations
• Onsite fuels (gas, oil, etc.): standard scientific values
• Steam: use Massachusetts-published emission factor for purchased
steam; use WRI-WBSCD methodology for owner-operated cogen plant
• Electricity: emission factor based on Massachusetts’ calculations and
projections of emissions from Massachusetts electricity use

• Key principles: reflects that the Massachusetts grid is getting
cleaner and lets owners use this as a reduction measure, while also
providing owners certainty and predictability on emissions

Key principles:
• Labs and Affordable Housing may need more time for implementation, but should be held to same
overall standards as other buildings
• Lab tenants are able to play a role in meeting targets
• Labs should be defined in a way that acknowledges the unique needs while avoiding system gaming
Lab Definition: 15% or more of occupied building square footage with an air exchange rate of 0.5 cubic
feet per minute per square foot (CFM/ft2) or greater
Planning: Must submit a GHG reduction plan prior to each alternative compliance period

Goals of preliminary analysis:
• Examine at a very high level what a similar policy could look
like for Cambridge BEUDO buildings
• Does not create groups or set thresholds specific to
Cambridge BEUDO building data

• Uses the Individual Compliance benchmarks tested in Boston analysis
(24% reduction by 2025, 48% reduction by 2030) and current policy
for renewable portfolio standard

• Developing this approach for Cambridge would require similar
analysis as Boston

Overall Boston Threshold Impact for
Cambridge Buildings

Packet Pg. 101

a

• Process that Boston used:
•
•
•
•
•

Worked with technical consultant and advisory group
Identified 13 locally appropriate typologies, using Portfolio Manager and
analysis of existing emissions intensity
Analyzed other factors to see if building age, etc. should be a determinant of
thresholds
Developed thresholds with stakeholders to reach 2030 targets as a whole and
affect different sectors equitably
Developed individual pathway and recalibrated thresholds

• Potential approach for Cambridge:
•
•
•
•

Would require procuring consultant support
Stakeholder process to identify appropriate typologies (or need to justify
same groupings as Boston)
Develop reduction thresholds that are either Cambridge-specific or Bostonaligned
Process could be 6-9 months (est.)
