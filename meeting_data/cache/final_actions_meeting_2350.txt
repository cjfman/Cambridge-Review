PUBLIC COMMENT
George Schneeloch, 81 School Street, Somerville, spoke on Committee Report #4. He read from a
prepared written statement in favor of the Cycling Safety Ordinance.
Itamar Turner-Trauring, 139 Oxford Street, spoke on Committee Report #4 and Policy Order #15. He
stated his support for Medicaid and the cycling ordinance. He said that it is important for the City
Council to show its support for these issues. He noted that transportation is a place where the City has a
huge amount of influence. He said that there are not enough dedicated bike lanes. He said that there is a
need for more frequent buses. He asked for City Council support of this ordinance.
Mark Boswell, 105 Walden Street, spoke on Committee Report #4. He stated his support for the cycling
safety ordinance as it is written. He read from a prepared written statement.
Sean McFarland, 52 Pearl Street, spoke on Policy Orders #13, #15 and Committee Report #4. He stated
his support of these items. He said that it is exciting to see the progress that is being made in the City as it
relates to safe bicycling. He noted that there is a lot of tension in the community about the dependency on
cars. He stated that as it relates to housing, the more money that we can bring to bear on housing is a
positive. He commented that regarding Medicare, four winters ago one on his lungs spontaneously
collapsed. He stated that for the 40 days he spent in the hospital, his bill was $3,000 because he had
insurance.
Bill Cavellini, 33 Oak Street, Somerville, spoke on Policy Order #3. He stated his support for this Policy
Order. He commented that there was no elevator in the original plan. He stated that the first plan was
overbudget and the next plan had no elevator or stair access from the Cambridge side. He noted that he
lives a block from the station. He said that negotiations are taking place with the developer with the hope
to get the developer to join in the request for better access.
Ann Camara, 53 Hanson Street, Somerville, spoke on Policy Order #3. She stated that she grew up in
Cambridge and the Green Line has always been important to her. She commented that we need an
elevator at our border. She said that there needs to be a new contract with the MBTA. She stated that it is
important for all to have access. She said that the City should demand the placement of an elevator.
Charles Franklin, 162 Hampshire Street, spoke on Policy Orders #3, #4 and #13. He said that housing,
health and safety are rights. He stated his support for these Policy Orders. He said that all three of these
things are necessary. He noted that the City can raise his taxes to pay for some of this stuff. He
commented that it is unimaginable that there will not be an elevator at the Green Line. He stated that
regarding love and not hate, on Friday there was a lot of love in Cambridge. He said that it is wonderful
to live in a City that is so welcoming.

Sue Butler, 14 Clinton Street, spoke on Policy Orders #1, #3, #4 and #9. She said that she serves on
many committees and she is always thinking about sustainability. She said that these will contribute to
positive qualities in urban life. She said that if people walk and bike more it means fewer vehicles on the
road. She said that Boston, and thereby Cambridge, is #1 as it relates to worst traffic in the nation. She
said that it as it relates to the opioid addiction, she stated that she recently heard a very good presentation
by Marion Ryan, Middlesex District Attorney, on restorative practices in their office for people who are
struggling with opioid addiction. She suggested that this may be a valuable resource.
Christopher Lucy, 107 South Street, Boston, spoke on Policy Order #12. He stated that there are other
forms of transportation that are in the works that are also technologically advanced that will help to
reduce the congestion in the street and improve the amount of efficiency to get to and from places. He
said that public transit is an issue that is discussed in almost every metropolitan town. He urged the City
Council to consider these issues and he said that it is time for the cities and towns and State to think of a
regulatory structure that will allow these devices to be integrated into the transportation flow.
Susan Markowitz, 20 Oak Street, spoke on Policy Order #3. She stated her support of this Policy Order.
She said that the plans should be reviewed so that people with mobility impairments will have access. He
said that stairs and/or elevator will be helpful to all users. She said that the developer is deleting the
elevator from the original plan. She said that given that Cambridge has put in millions of dollars to
implement the plan, why should Cambridge residents have to walk a great distance.
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, requested a correction to the Committee Report on a better bus
process. She said that the bus routes that serve East Cambridge no longer serve the important locations
the way that they used to. She said that East Cambridge lost bus service. She said that the Breaking
Ground exhibit was incredible. She said that Third and Spring Streets getting STOP signs should be fun.
She would like better access to Green Line service. She said that Lechmere Station should have good
access from the neighborhoods that it is supposed to serve. She said that as it relates to housing and
medical expenses, they are basic needs to live decently.
Tom Joyce, 270 Third Street, spoke on Policy Order #1. He stated that in the letter there was mention of
a multitude of accidents at this intersection. He said that he has been to many meetings with the Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department. He said that this was one of the first intersections that was
discussed. He said that the neighbors have been promised a four-way stop over a year ago and it is still
not in place.
Hasson Rashid, 820 Massachusetts Avenue, spoke on all items that relate to homelessness. He read from
a prepared written statement.
Farrah E. Ridore, Regional Director, representing the office of Senator Elizabeth Warren, read a prepared
written statement from Senator Warren in support of Policy Order #1.
James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that Asa Brebner’s death was a great loss. He stated that it
was a shock to learn of his passing. Regarding the city survey, he said that he hopes that the City Council
will dig into it a bit. He said that he worries that if it is not accurately interpreted, it will be used to
further something that does not deserve it. He said that regarding the Better Bus Project, not everyone
thinks that it is a better project. He said that the key interest that he has is the elimination of the loop
around the Harvard Yard for the #1 bus. He said that the only way that it would be justified to eliminate
the loop is to insist that everyone who rides the T will be able to take the medical area shuttle.

Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler stated his support for Policy Orders #13 and #15. He read from a prepared
written statement regarding his support for public commitment to housing and healthcare.
Nate Fillmore, 13 Marcella Street, spoke in favor of Policy Order #14. He stated that the City survey
showed support for further implementation of protected bike lanes. He said that this shows the
importance for the ordinance to pass and for there to be quick implementation of a complete network of
protected bike lanes in the next five years.

Mar 18, 2019

Councillor Simmons noted that the work has started on the Union Square Station and recognize the
difficult cutbacks necessary to move forward, there is a continued frustration that the cutbacks seem to
always come at the expense of those with mobility issues. She stated that those in wheelchairs, walkers
and canes will still be able to access the station, but it is more difficult. These individuals will have to
travel a greater distance to access the station and when there is inclement weather this can translate into
more than a minor annoyance and the extra travel may be significantly more challenging for an individual
with a disability or impairment. She is hopeful that this Policy Order will change some things. She noted
that according to DOT the plans are drawn up and cannot be changed. She noted that Cambridge made a
significant investment in the extension of the Green Line and if Cambridge is left out it is deplorable. She
spoke about the impact this will have on the small Inman Square businesses and individuals may not want
to work this hard to use public transportation. She wanted the City Council to go on record in solidarity
with the Cambridge business owners for fairness to all and to support those with mobility issues.
Councillor Carlone spoke about federal transportation policy and this is against everything and the
Disabilities Act. He noted that Somerville residents are also being hurt. He added that this could be a
strategy to have more people use the retail in Union Square rather than Inman Square. He explained that
in Winchester two elevators are required on each side of the station in the event that one elevator breaks
down. He commented that this is horrendous, and the City should consider suing the MBTA as a member
of a group that feels that this is absolutely against any public benefit conceivable related to the T.
Councillor Zondervan this is outrageous and needs to be addressed.
Mayor McGovern spoke about scheduling a meeting with officials of the MBTA to discuss this.
Vice Mayor Devereux announced an MBTA public meeting on March 20, 2019 at the Kennedy
Longfellow School at 6:30 PM.

2018-19.
POR 2019 #84
Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley

Mar 18, 2019

Vice Mayor Devereux commented that this is a question of accessibility. She spoke about getting a report
on the data that the City has now about where the violations are occurring, how often they are occurring
and if there are repeat offenders. She stated that the City Councillors are sent articles from residents
indicating that in other cities, in the United States and Europe, the clearing of sidewalks is a public
responsibility of the government and it is not left to property owners to do. In some communities the
sidewalks are cleared before the roads. She stated that whether the City has the will or resources to flip
what is the priority to clear. She acknowledged that ambulances, emergency vehicles and school busses
that also need the roads but at the same time the City trusts its residents as residential property owners are
responsible for the sidewalks that other residents are using. She stated that the City has tried to
communicate what are the expectations for clearing the sidewalks and after each storm there are the same
problems in the same locations. She suggested a Public Safety Committee hearing to discuss the data.
Councillor Simmons stated that sidewalk snow removal is clearly not created equal. This affects the
elderly and the physically challenged more. She told of an instance where an individual at 8:30 AM
comes out onto Prospect Street and had to walk to Tedeschi’s because that was the nearest clear area for
her to get back onto the sidewalk. It is time to have a different conversation and that this on as the City
and not leave it to private owners. She noted that seniors have complained about this issue have been told
by Public Works to report the situation, but report to whom and how quickly does this get taken care of
she asked.
Councillor Zondervan agreed that this is a problem but logistically he is not sure how the City would get
enough crews together to shovel all the sidewalks in the City. He commented that the City should be
doing is if someone reports a sidewalk that is not cleared a crew should be sent to clear the sidewalk and
charge the property owner for the expense. He stated that he does not understand why the City does not
do this. He added that the available data is difficult to access and is not correct. He stated that it is
important to have high quality data and it is necessary to have both reporting and enforcement data.
The question now came on adoption of the order which reads as follows:

10. That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Community Development Department and
other relevant staff to report to the City Council on how the data collected from the Broadway EcoDisplay is used to inform the City’s transportation planning efforts and to address the possibility of
installing additional Eco-Display counters at the highest trafficked bicycle locations to provide more
comprehensive information about bike use and other vehicles such as scooters.
POR 2019 #90
Councillor Kelley, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Zondervan
(HERE INSERT ORIGINAL POLICY ORDER #10)
Councillor Kelley made a motion to amend by substitution which expands the City actions in counting
both bikes and vehicles that are not necessarily cars. He stated that the use of cameras allows the City to
collect data. He stated that counting bikes is more sophisticated than people standing on a street corner
with clickers. He wanted to know how the City is addressing these new sophisticated tools.


PAGE 11

Mar 18, 2019

Vice Mayor Devereux asked about the cameras that are placed when a developer is seeking a Special
Permit and traffic counts are done to show existing conditions. She noted that the City does not place
these cameras and the cameras are placed by someone that the developer contracts and asked do you want
access to these cameras. Councillor Kelley responded that he did not see why the City could not ask for
access to these cameras and this could become a condition of the Special Permit process.
Mayor McGovern now moved the amendment - and on a voice vote the amendment Carried.
Councillor Carlone stated that when the Special Permit requires a traffic study anything related to traffic
can be requested.
The question now came on the order as amended which reads as follows:

13. City Council support for fully funding the Section 8 Housing Choice Tenant-Based Voucher
Program.
POR 2019 #93
Councillor Zondervan, Mayor McGovern, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Carlone
Councillor Zondervan stated that this calls on the representatives in Congress to sponsor an amendment to
the budget that would fully fund the Section 8 Housing Choice mobile voucher program. He stated that
the Somerville City Council has already done this, and he hoped that Cambridge can join Somerville. He
added that Section 8 is an important component of the affordable housing strategy because it allows the
City to leverage existing housing to protect tenants from displacement while the City plans how to build
more affordable housing.
The following order was now considered, the question being on adoption, to wit:

Mar 18, 2019

Councillor Carlone stated that this is a request for the City to work with state to get the same agreement
that Boston has as well as other Cities in the United States. He explained that if a community is losing
low income residents and new housing is being built with as many as fifty affordable units that a greater
priority than now goes to people who are being moved out of the neighborhood. He noted that those who
are low income do not have many resources and move to a different neighborhood can be troubling. He
stated that there is a state policy that states Cambridge can only talk about Cambridge, but this is greater
Boston, Somerville and maybe Brookline. This needs to be looked at on a neighborhood by
neighborhood basis when there is available housing. He stated that neighborhoods matter and if not their
neighborhood, it should be a full-service neighborhood.
Mayor McGovern commented that as a co-sponsor there was information in the text that he wanted to
correct but was unable to do before submission and he wanted to add more factual information. At this
time Mayor McGovern moved to exercise his Charter Right. The item was the subject of a RESULT:

CHARTER RIGHT EXERCISED BY MAYOR MCGOVERN

15. That the City Council go on record in enthusiastic support of the Medicare for All Act of 2019
(H.R.1384).
POR 2019 #95
Councillor Zondervan, Mayor McGovern, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Carlone
Councillor Zondervan stated that this Act has 106 sponsors in the House. He noted that there is an urgent
need to reform the health care system because quality health care is a human right, and many are only one
medical crisis away from bankruptcy or life altering debt. He stated that the United States spends more
money per capita on health care than any industrial nation yet the United States has the worst health
outcomes, lower life expectancy, higher infant immortality rates, higher rates of diabetes and obesity. He
stated that 30 million individuals are uninsured and 40 million cannot afford their co-pays and
deductibles. He stated that this bill would transform the country to a single payer Medicare for all system
over a two-year period. This is an opportunity to simplify the system and eliminate out-of-pocket costs.
This would allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. He stated that this bill addresses a
critical criticism of past iterations by fully preserving funding for the Veterans’ Administration and Indian
Health Services. He stated that he hoped that Cambridge could be the second City in the country behind
Seattle to officially support this legislation that would have a life changing impact on everyone.
