Harvard Square Zoning Amendment aims - from CDD Report

Likely Impacts:
• Makes it easier for banks to open in smaller properties in Harvard Square (removing 30% restriction)
• Allows better control of prime Harvard Square locations for banks with large street-facing facades.
• Avoids creation of faux-art-gallery and similar non-transparent financial institution facades

Blier, et. al. Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

Section 20.54.9 of the existing Harvard Square Overlay District places ground floor frontage restrictions
on banks, trust companies, and similar financial institutions. The linear ground floor frontage of these
uses must comply with two distinct metrics:
•
•

First, these uses are restricted to occupying a maximum of 25’ of the ground-floor level frontage
of a building facing a street.
Second, such uses are limited to occupying a maximum of 30% of a building’s total horizontal
ground-floor building frontage aggregated over one or more streets.

There is also a mechanism to permit a “minor increase” in frontage by issuance of a special permit from
the Planning Board. As with all Special Permits in this district, the Harvard Square Advisory Committee
provides a written recommendation to the Planning Board on these special permits.
The current petition seeks to modify the limitations on the frontage of bank uses in the Harvard Square
Overlay District in the following manner:
•
•

•

Eliminates the 30% restriction to a building’s ground floor bank frontages, aggregated over one
or more streets.
Modifies the linear foot limitation for bank use frontage along a building’s ground-floor level so
that the 25’ limitation is calculated cumulatively for buildings with frontages along multiple
streets, rather than one street.
Adds language that attempts to modify how “ground-floor level frontage” is calculated and
assigned, so that the calculation will include portions of a building’s bank uses that are located
within 20 feet of the street but that are not directly accessible or visible from the street.

The following is a markup version of the Petition that compares it to the current zoning (additions are
underlined, deletions in strikethrough):
“20.54.9 Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as identified in
Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of the ground-floor level frontage of a
building facing any a street, aggregated over one or more streets and measured horizontally parallel to
the that street and wall faces. This limitation shall apply to the sum of all ground-floor frontage to a
depth of 20 feet measured from the street. In addition, such uses shall not occupy more than thirty
percent (30%) of a building’s total horizontal ground-floor building frontage aggregated over one or
more streets. The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted
frontage upon finding that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique
conditions of a particular building or site and that the criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are
met.”
Background
Section 20.54.9 was adopted in 2020 along with other changes to the Harvard Square Overlay District.
The purpose of these regulations is to continue to allow banks in the district while limiting their visual
impact on the retail storefront pattern. Similar requirements have been effective in the Central Square
Overlay District since 2017.

Summary of Petition Effects

a

Blier, et. al. Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

In Harvard Square, the Board has not granted any special permits modifying the frontage limitations but
has been involved in the review of a couple cases that were ultimately found to be in conformance with
the existing zoning requirements. Those cases are summarized below as they provide some insight into
the Petitioners’ rationale for the current Petition.
1290 Massachusetts Avenue
In early 2021, the Planning Board received a special permit application (PB-378) to exceed the permitted
frontage for a bank in an existing corner retail space for a new Santander Bank located at 1290
Massachusetts Avenue. The Harvard Square Advisory Committee met with the applicant for 1290
Massachusetts Avenue to discuss their proposal prior to the Planning Board meeting and voted to
forward a negative recommendation.
The applicant sought a continuance of the case and decided to pursue an as-of-right configuration for
the bank. The modified plans carved out a section of the space for a smaller retail tenant on
Massachusetts Ave. and created a dedicated window display gallery space a few feet wide along Linden
Street that would not be used by the bank. The resulting direct bank frontage was 22.67’ on
Massachusetts Avenue and 18’ on Linden Street. The Inspectional Services Department (ISD) determined
that the revised project plan did not exceed the frontage limitations in Section 20.54.9 and the
applicant’s Planning Board application was withdrawn.

Attachment: CDDMemo_blieretal_FINAL (COF 2022 #159 : A communication was received from Jeffrey Roberts)

In Central Square, the Planning Board has granted special permits approving a couple instances of banks
exceeding the frontage limitations. Usually these were cases of a bank moving into an existing retail
space, and the modifications were to fit the existing space. In some cases the Planning Board has
imposed conditions on the storefront design in order to mitigate the visual impact of the bank façade.

a

Blier, et. al. Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

The Planning Board granted a special permit for the redevelopment of this site in 2018 (PB-334), which
included partial renovation of an existing building and a new addition. Retail uses, but not bank uses,
were shown at the ground story in the plans approved by the Planning Board. The lot is triangle-shaped,
with frontage on both Brattle Street and JFK Street.
As construction was underway, Chase Bank leased a space for its use at the building’s ground story and
sought a building permit for the bank fit-out. ISD determined that the bank was subject to the frontage
limitations in Section 20.54.9. The bank space was designed to have two entrances, one on Brattle Street
and one on JFK Street. ISD determined that this configuration conformed to the limitations in Section
20.54.9, because the frontage on each street was no more than 25 feet and the total bank frontage was
not more than 30% of the total building frontage. Because the building was subject to a Planning Board
special permit, the plan changes, which involved changes from retail uses to a bank use, required
Planning Board review and approval. After making some comments and reviewing a round of revisions,
the Planning Board approved the plan changes earlier this year, subject to continuing CDD staff review.

Blier, et. al. Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board

It appears that the Petitioners’ intent is to address issues related to these prior cases. During the
Planning Board hearings for these prior cases community members expressed concerns that despite the
limitations in the Zoning Ordinance, the proposed banks still appeared to occupy more building frontage
than was desired when the requirements for bank frontage were enacted.
The proposal to eliminate the 30% aggregate frontage limitation, to be replaced with a 25’ total frontage
limitation across all streets, seems intended to put stricter limitations on scenarios where a bank might
be located in the corner of a building or might have multiple entrances on different streets.
The proposal to apply the limitations “to a depth of 20 feet measured from the street” seems intended
to address scenarios like at 1290 Massachusetts Avenue where the frontage limitations might be met by
putting a narrow use at the building frontage to create a “buffer” in front of the bank.
The overall effect of the petition is to place greater restrictions on the occupancy of a ground-story retail
space by a bank use in Harvard Square. For example, it would be very difficult for a bank to occupy a
corner space unless it is very small. It would also be difficult for a bank to occupy a larger ground-story
space, unless the space is mainly in the interior of the building with only a small entrance on the
exterior.
Additionally, the Petition raises some technical questions worthy of more consideration.
Calculating and Attributing “Ground-Floor Level Frontage”
Frontage is typically defined as the length of a building, or the length of a separate and distinct ground
floor establishment, abutting a street. The use of the word “frontage” is less clear when applied to an
individual establishment or use within a larger building, but ISD has determined in recent cases that it
only applies to the portion of the use that is directly behind the building’s exterior wall. The Petition
does not seek to amend or clarify the meaning of “frontage,” but proposes an amendment that states
that “This limitation shall apply to the sum of all ground-floor frontage to a depth of 20 feet measured
from the street.” The intent seems to be to treat the entire portion of the building 20 feet from the
street (which might not necessarily be the first 20 feet depth into the building) as “frontage.” This could
help address the issue raised in the 1290 Massachusetts Avenue case, but could also introduce
additional ambiguity depending on how ISD interprets the meaning of “frontage” for cases that might
have irregular configurations of storefront spaces.
In other parts of the City, there are design standards that require all ground-story uses (not just banks)
with building frontage to have a depth of at least 20 feet (or some other typical depth), to avoid overly
narrow spaces. That would likely not be in the scope of this Petition, but could be considered separately
in a subsequent petition.
Multiple Bank Institutions
The Petition, as well as the current zoning, is not clear in how it would apply to a building with two or
more banks. It is not entirely clear whether the limitation is applied to a building or to each individual
bank establishment. As written, it might allow multiple banks with a ground-floor level frontage located

request that CDD and Law Department review the text before adoption and make recommended
changes to the language to make it as clear and enforceable as possible.

within a single building. Each individual bank might have frontage that is less than twenty-five feet (25’),
but cumulatively they might exceed twenty-five feet (25’) of frontage or a building. Additional clarity
should be provided.
