Focus on uses with more impact from mechanicals
How best to make the distinction? Will it always be clear?
Still could impact smaller businesses
If special permit, what are the criteria?

• More holistic review process
• Special permit process allows more flexibility, but time and
procedures can be burdensome
• Criteria in addition to Article 19?

Commercial Industry Trends
National & Local Trends
• Major markets like San Francisco, New York, and Greater Boston are seeing an increasing rate of
office space vacancy due to “work from home” and macroeconomic trends

• Companies are either not renewing leases, subleasing, back peddling on expansions, or breaking
leases.
• Companies that are looking for office space are looking for quality over quantity

Locally
• According to CBRE, between Q2 and Q3 2022, Cambridge office vacancy rates increased from
5.9% to 8.7% - highest vacancy level since 2013
• East Cambridge/Kendall Square has the tightest office and lab market
• Small and mid-size companies are having hard time finding small lab/flex spaces to stay and grow

Life science and biotechnology firms are not the only
companies looking for R&D space. Other industries
that need wet and dry lab space include:
• Food incubators
• Medical Device
• Clean Energy
• Robotics/Automation
• Fabrication/Prototyping

Dear Mr. Huang:
I am writing in response to Council Order No. O-8 of 1/23/2023 which requests that the
City Solicitor provide a legal opinion in response to the above-referenced questions. These
questions arose out of the January 4, 2023 Ordinance Committee meeting concerning the
Callender, et al. Zoning Petition which seeks to amend provisions in the Cambridge Zoning
Ordinance concerning labs. These questions concern the fact that the City Council has been
discussing possible amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to address labs, and the provisions in
the Callender, et al. Zoning Petition are similar to provisions that the City Council is discussing.
Therefore, the City Council is seeking an opinion about how possible action by the Council on
the Callender, et al. Zoning Petition could impact possible future efforts to enact similar zoning
amendments concerning labs. I will address the specific questions below.
1.

Whether there is a two-year bar on considering repetitive zoning petitions
that have been unfavorably acted upon by the Council?

This first question was addressed by the Deputy City Solicitor at the January 4, 2023
meeting. As explained at that meeting, G.L. c. 40A, §5, and Zoning Ordinance Article I, Section
1.52 provide that a zoning petition that has been unfavorably acted upon by the City Council
shall not be considered by the City Council within two years unless the Planning Board
recommended adoption. Section 1.52 of the Zoning Ordinance further provides that:

The granting of "leave to withdraw" after a proposed amendment has been
advertised for a hearing before the City Council shall be considered as
constituting unfavorable action. Failure of the City Council to take action on a
petition for a zoning amendment within ninety (90) days after the City Council's
hearing on said petition shall render the petition inactive. Such failure to act
shall not be considered unfavorable action … .
“The purpose of the two-year bar is to give some measure of finality to unfavorable action taken
by a municipal legislative body so that members of the public shall be able to ascertain the
legislative status of a proposed change at all times, and to rely on unfavorable action ... as a
complete defeat of the proposal.” Penn vs. Town of Barnstable, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 205, 210
(2019).
2.

If so, whether that bar on repetitive petitions would prohibit the Council
from moving forward with a Council initiated lab use zoning petition if there
is unfavorable action on the pending Callender, et al. Petition?

And
3.

If so, what types of changes to zoning petition would be necessary for it to no
longer be considered a repetitive petition.

In determining whether the bar on repetitive petitions would prohibit the Council from
moving forward with a Council initiated lab zoning petition if there is unfavorable action on the
pending Callender et al. Zoning Petition, it is necessary to examine the degree of similarity
between those petitions. The Court has held that “proposed ordinances or bylaws are the same
for purposes of G. L. c. 40A, § 5, sixth par., if they share the same fundamental or essential
character, with little substantive difference.” Penn vs. Town of Barnstable, 96 Mass. App. Ct.
205, 21 (2019).
In the Penn v. Town of Barnstable case, the Town Council sought to enact a parking
overlay district. “The overarching purpose of the amendment was to authorize “as of right”
operation of commercial parking lots … The amendment then set out site-development standards
governing operation of the lots within the [overlay district]; those standards addressed, among
other things, the number of parking spaces allowed on the lots, dimensional requirements, and
demarcation of emergency-access aisles and property boundaries.” Id. at 206. That zoning
petition was voted down. A few weeks later, the Town Council initiated a new zoning petition
creating a parking overlay district. “The only differences between the two [petitions] were that
[the second petition] clarified that the [overlay district] does not include fully or partially
enclosed parking structures, clarified that lot owners could not create more parking spaces by
discontinuing other uses on their parcels, and required that lot owners file parking plans with the
town.” Id. at 211-212. The second petition passed and was ordained. A lawsuit was brought
challenging the zoning amendment and the court held that the two year bar on repetitive petitions
precluded the Town Council from considering the second petition, and the Appeals Court upheld
the trial court’s decision annulling the zoning amendment. The Court held that the changes from
the first petition to the second petition “were amendments that merely facilitated enforcement of
2

a

[the first petition]. They did not change the fundamental and essential character of the [first
petition] -- to allow for as-of-right operation of commercial parking lots through creation of the
[overlay district].” Id. The Court also held that whether two zoning petitions share the same
fundamental or essential character so as to prohibit action on the second petition is a question of
law and there is no deference to the legislative body’s determination that the two petitions do, or
do not, share the same fundamental or essential character. Id. at 212.
It is difficult to opine whether the bar on repetitive petitions would prohibit the Council
from moving forward with a Council initiated lab zoning petition if there is unfavorable action
on the pending Callender et al. Zoning Petition without knowing precisely how the Council will
propose regulating labs. However, if the Council wants to move forward with the proposed
zoning amendment set forth in Calendar Item #3 of 10/3/22 which was referred to the Economic
Development and University Relations Committee and the Neighborhood & Long-Term
Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration Committee for review and discussion, it is clear
that proposed zoning amendment would be prohibited if there is unfavorable action on the
Callender et al. Zoning Petition because the regulation of labs in both is nearly identical.
It is also likely that any subsequent zoning petition that seeks to prohibit new lab uses in
business and office districts, even if there are some exceptions built in, will be of the same
fundamental or essential character as the Callender, et al. Zoning Petition so as to prohibit action
on the second petition if there is unfavorable action on the Callender, et al. Zoning Petition.
However, a petition that takes a more holistic look at lab use across the city, or adds a special
requirement for certain lab uses, may be different enough in character to not be subject to the bar
on repetitive petitions. We will need to analyze any further proposed zoning petitions
concerning lab use on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the Council can act on them if
there is unfavorable action on the Callender, et al. Zoning Petition.
In summary, if there is unfavorable action on the Callender, et al. Zoning Petition, the
City Council can only move forward with another zoning petition regulating labs if it is not of
the same fundamental and essential character. The differences between the petitions would have
to be more significant than clarifying changes or slight variations, as explained above.
Otherwise, the Council would have to wait two years from any unfavorable action on the
Callender, et al. Zoning Petition before adopting a subsequent lab petition.
Very truly yours,

Nancy E. Glowa
City Solicitor

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
WHEREAS:

Cambridge is proud to be the innovation capital of the East Coast but a discussion is
needed about where future lab growth is appropriate and where it could significantly
impede other priorities, including the emergency need for more housing and the desire
to have vibrant, active business districts and squares; and

WHEREAS:

The attached zoning amendments propose a technical definition of the lab use that is
aligned with how other cities in the region have defined the use, allowing the use to be
separately regulated from the general office use; and

WHEREAS:

The attached zoning amendments propose a restriction on new instances of the lab use
in fragile districts including Central Square, Harvard Square, and Cambridge Street;
and

WHEREAS:

The attached zoning amendments propose explicitly allowing any and all existing lab
uses to continue in all districts without any barriers; and

WHEREAS:

There is plenty of room for discussion around which districts should and should not be
included, but without a proactive conversation and something on the table it is
conceivable that the lab use could take over in areas where it is unwanted; now
therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council refer the attached zoning petition to the Economic Development
and University Relations Committee and the Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning,
Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration Committee for review and discussion and report
back to the Council on March 30th, 2023.

IN CITY COUNCIL
February 7, 2023
Proposed Policy Order for referral to the Cambridge City Council regarding Labs and
Neighborhood Planning
February 7, 2023
Councillors Toner, Carlone, Azeem, and McGovern
WHEREAS: The City Council has been discussing the need to develop recommendations to balance the
needs of our residents and lab community along our main corridors and squares outside, with the
exception of Kendall Square and the Alewife Quadrangle; therefore, be it so
ORDERED: That the City Manager instruct the Community Development Department to establish a
working group comprised of CDD and the Inspectional Services Department staff, representatives from
the various business associations (Kendall Square Business Association, Harvard Square Business
Association, Central Square Business Improvement District, East Cambridge Business Association, and
Cambridge Chamber of Commerce), lab developers and owners, community members, and
representatives of the Affordable Housing Trust to develop recommendations on the following issues:
1. Addressing Nuisances (Noise, light, mechanicals, etc.) - Address the concerns surrounding
commercial buildings and labs through design guidelines in zoning code, strengthening the
building code where needed, and review other local and state regulations.
2. Reasonable restrictions on commercial building and lab size and use: Avoid any restrictive
definitions of “labs” to prevent unintended consequences of hampering innovation and new
trends in the very fluid lab, office, commercial, and technical workspace environment. Where
appropriate, recommend some restrictions on the size and intensity of use and/or hazard level
(i.e., prohibit BLS 3 or 4) in certain neighborhoods to address concerns about health, safety and
the impact of commercial and large lab buildings being built in or adjacent to smaller scale
residential districts. Issue separate guidance for conversion of existing space versus ground-up
new construction, especially as it relates to any potential size restrictions.
3. 1035 Cambridge Street: Allow all current uses at 1035 Cambridge Street to continue by
establishing a new zoning district encompassing 1035 and surrounding parcels. However, due to
the nature of current uses at 1035 and the rapidly changing landscape in Somerville around the
new Union Square T station and Boynton Yards, 1035 Cambridge and the surrounding parcels
should be looked at differently. The area should move forward as its own district with a possible
housing overlay district for added height and density at a 100-foot depth along Cambridge
Street using the Our Cambridge Street Study as a starting point.
4. Address the need for more housing through a pro-active discussion on mixed use and mixed
income development of lab, housing, and retail: CDD should use the research and planning
that has resulted from Envision Cambridge, Alewife Quad Study, and Our Cambridge Street
Study along with future discussions of Central Square and North Massachusetts Avenue to
identify concepts and best practices in urban planning to develop strong design guidelines and

zoning and other possible recommendations that harness the economic dynamism of labs and
the innovation economy to support the creation of co-located retail and housing via mixed-use
developments (i.e., residential above lab above ground floor retail) of all scales.
