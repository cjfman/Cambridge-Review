>> AND WE'LL START WITH FORMER MAYOR DAVIS, AND FOLLOWED BY
ALLEN.
>> HENRIETTA DAVIS HAS NOT JOINED. ALLEN, GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. I LIVE AT 17 PLEASANT PLACE. MY OPINIONS
ARE MY OWN AND I DON'T SPEAK FOR ANY ORGANIZATION. THERE'S A LOT
TONIGHT. VERY BRIEFLY, I SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND. I
STRONGLY SUPPORT ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR HOUSING STABILITY. AND I
HOPE WE CAN GO FURTHER TO GET A FULL RIGHT TO COUNCIL. I'M GREAT
FOR RESOLUTION NUMBER THREE, I HOP WE CAN WISH JESSIE WITH SUCCESS.
THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION WILL HAVE A STRONGER IMPACT ON THE
CLIMATE AND BETTER POLICY IF THE SOLAR OPTION IS ALLOWED FOR ALL
BUILDINGS. CHARTER REFORM, MOVE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS TO THE
FEDERAL CYCLE. WE NEED FOUR YEAR COUNCIL TERMS, NOT TO MENTION

MORE LEGISLATIVE RESOURCES FOR THE COUNCIL SO MORE COUNCIL WORK
CAN GET DONE. WITH ALL THAT SAID, I'M PRIMARILY HERE TO EXPRESS
CONCERN ABOUT POLICY ORDER SIX. REGARDING WEALTH BUILDING AND
AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT WILL GIVE PEOPLE STABILITY AND
SECURITY AND BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BUILD EQUITY THROUGH
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUILDING EQUITY
THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP, WHICH IS GOOD, AND BUILDING WEALTH.
THAT IS SMALL TIME REAL ESTATE SPECULATION.
FUNDAMENTALLY HOUSING CAN'T BE AFFORDABLE AND A GOOD
INVESTMENT. IF WE PROMISE PEOPLE THEY CAN COUNT ON HOUSING
EXCUSE ME. WE ARE PROMISING PEOPLE THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO
SCREW OVER FUTURE GENERATIONS AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO
LIVE HERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT ADJUSTING THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW EQUITY
AND DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE LOANS LIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO. LET'S
THINK ABOUT MAKING THE THINGS LIMITED EQUITY. NOT TURN EVEN MORE
PEOPLE INTO REAL ESTATE SPECULATORS. THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE AGENDA.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LUCY MONTGOMERY.
>> PARTICIPANT: GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M LUCY. AND I'M A RESIDENT OF 24
PEABODY TERRACE. I'M HERE WITH THE GROUP, FREE TO FLUSH, TO DISCUSS
POLICY ORDER FIVE THAT WE SUPPORT IN CREATING TO ADDRESS A HUMAN
RIGHTS ISSUE AROUND BATHROOM ACCESS AND SAFETY.
THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC SHUT THE WORLD DOWN AND ESCALATED ISSUES
OF EQUITY. WE ALL HAVE LOST AND INSECURITY DURING THE TIME AND
MANY OF US HAD SAFE PLACES TO STAY IN AND TRY TO RIDE OUT THE
STORM. WHEN PLACES HAD TO CLOSE, PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHOUSED ARE
HIT HARD AND LEFT WITHOUT FEELING SAFE. SHELTERS COULDN'T TAKE AS
MANY PEOPLE, THE HARVARD SQUARE HOMELESS SHELTER IS SHUT DOWN
TO REASONS AND UNHOUSED COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HAVE ACCESS
HUMAN RIGHTS WAS NOT MET. WHAT MAJOR ISSUE IS AROUND BATHROOM
ACCESS AND SAFETY. DURING THE PANDEMIC, FEWER BATHROOMS ARE
OPEN AND FEW TO NONE AVAILABLE AT NIGHT. PEOPLE UNHOUSED
COULDN'T ENTER SPACE TO USE THE RESTROOM BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS
AND FEAR OF GETTING ARRESTED FOR PUBLIC INDECENCY. THEY LEFT THEM
FEELING ANXIETY AND NOT ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT IT. WE
LIVE IN A CITY WITH AN AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND DRIVE FOR UNHOUSED
NEIGHBORS, AS A GROUP, WE HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY THAT HAVE STEPPED
IN. THE CITY COUNCIL HAS MEMBERS THAT WORKED TO ADDRESS ISSUES,
BUT WE ARE ASKING FOR THE CONTINUED HELP IN ADDRESSING THIS
PRESSING NEED OF BATHROOM ACCESS. SOME PUBLIC BATHROOMS ARE
AVAILABLE IN CAMBRIDGE, THEY STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO SUPPORT
SAFETY NEEDS. AS THE WORLD REOPENS, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BATHROOM
USE AS A HUMAN RIGHT AND PUT IN PLACE HOW WE'LL SUPPORT AND WORK
WITH UNHOUSED NEIGHBORHOODS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS. THANK
YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANDREA RINGER.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, 25 PEABODY TERRACE. I'M HERE TO DISCUSS POLICY
ORDER FIVE. WITH THE FREE TO FLUSH CAMPAIGN. WE LAUNCHED THIS
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BUILD COLLECTIVE POWER TO ASSERT THAT
ACCESS TO PUBLIC RESTROOMS IS A HUMAN RIGHT. A PERSON GOES TO THE
BATHROOM SIX TIMES PER DAY ON AVERAGE. SOMETHING THAT MOST OF
US TAKE FOR GRANTED IS AN ENORMOUS HURDLE FOR MEMBERS OF THE
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY. AT THE BEGINNING, WE TALKED WITH MEMBERS,
INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, HARVARD PROFESSOR THE
AND RESEARCHERS, BUSINESSES, STUDENTS, AND MEMBERS OF THE
UNHOUSED COMMUNITY, NEARLY ALL OF THEM AGREED THAT ACCESS TO
PUBLIC BATHROOMS WAS A BIG PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY DURING COVID. THIS
IS EXACERBATED IN CAMBRIDGE. AFTER WEEKS OF BRAINSTORMING FOR THE
CAMPAIGN, WE LAUNCHED ON APRIL 1, THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN WE
WORK WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH LIVED
EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS, TO DRAFT THE BATHROOM BILL OF RIGHTS.
WE CIRCULATE A PETITION AND CANVAS IN HARVARD SQUARE, CONNECTED
WITH BUSINESS LEADERS AND PARISHES TO HEAR WHAT THEY WORKED ON IN
CAMBRIDGE ON THE ISSUE. WHAT WE LEARNED, CAMBRIDGE IS DOING A LOT
OF THINGS WELL. THERE'S A PERMANENT PUBLIC BATHROOM IN CENTRAL
AND HARVARD SQUARE AND THREE TEMPORARY BATHROOMS IN HARVARD
SQUARE. THERE ARE STILL A FEW GAPS TO FULLY MEET THE NEEDS. THIS
WILL IS WHAT THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND POLICY ORDER 5 IS ASKING YOU TO
LOOK AT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, AYA HIJAZI.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. 15 FULKERSON STREET. I'M HERE TO DISCUSS
POLICY ORDER FIVE. SOME BATHROOMS DON'T HAVE DOOR LOCKS. OTHERS
ARE CLOSED DURING THE NIGHT. SOME ARE NOT CLEAN. AND OTHER
SECURITY GUARDS AND PERSONNEL HARASS THE USERS. IN THE BILL OF
RIGHTS ENSURE PEOPLE IN THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITIES DO NOT
SEPARATE THE TIME THEY NEED THE BATHROOM. WE WANT TO ENSURE THE
BATHROOM USE IS NOT TREATED AS CHARITY, BUT A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT.
THE BILL OF RIGHTS SPELLS OUT OF MINIMUM GUARANTEES THAT
BATHROOMS SHOULD HAVE. BATHROOMS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE,
AFFORDABLE, FREE, SAFE, ACCEPTABLE AND DIGNIFIED AND ACCESSIBLE.
THEY ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY THE UNITED NATIONS. WE EXPECT NO LESS
FROM CAMBRIDGE. WE WISH THE CITY GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THE
UNITED NATIONS, PLEDGES NOT TO PERSECUTE ANY UNHOUSED MEMBER
FOR URINATING IN PUBLIC, WHETHER BY THIS CHARGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JENN JAMES AND THE FORMER VICE
MAYOR.
>> JENN HAS NOT JOINED.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, I WILL ASK IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. (JAN DEVEREUX).
GOOD EVENING. I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE I LEFT OFFICE THAT I
HAVE SPOKEN DURING PUBLIC COMMENT. TONIGHT, I'M SPEAKING AS A


PAGE 3

MAY 3, 2021

RESIDENT, MY VIEWS ARE MY OWN, THOUGH THEY ARE CERTAINLY
INFORMED BY MY WORK AS A CITY COUNCILLOR, MEMBER OF THE NET ZERO
REVIEW TASK FORCE AND THE BOARD OF GREEN CAMBRIDGE. DURING THE
TWO TERMS I SERVED ON THE COUNCIL AND AS A CHAIR OF THE HEALTH AND
ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE, I WORKED WITH THE VOLUNTEER MEMBERS OF
MOTHERS OUT FRONT ON SEVERAL ISSUES, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING
METHANE GAS LEAKS. THEY WERE INVALUABLE GRASSROOTS ALLIES, NOT
ONLY IN RAISING BROADER AWARENESS ON ISSUES, BUT IN DOING RESEARCH
TO ADVISE ME ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.
I KNEW I COULD TRUST THAT THEY HAD DONE THEIR HOMEWORK AND THE
POLICIES THEY ADVOCATED ON, WHICH IS WHY I'M URGING YOU TO PASS THE
GRASSROOTS PETITION TONIGHT. WITH THIS PETITION, THE MOTHERS HAVE
DONE THEIR HOMEWORK. IN FACT, BACK IN THE JUNE 2019, THE MOTHERS
INVITED ME ALONG WITH THEN OTHER COUNCILLORS TO TOUR THE
ROOFTOPS. ABSORB STORMWATER AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN A
CONGESTED AREA. THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION GREW OUT OF THIS
RESEARCH AND A SHINING EXAMPLE OF THOUGHTFUL AND EFFECTIVE
ADVOCACY. THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT REQUIRING GREEN
ROOFS ON NEW BUILDINGS AS PART OF THE CLIMATE MITIGATION STRATEGY
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. REQUIRING GREEN ROOFS OR COMBINING
VEGETATION WITH SOLAR PANELS, THE BIOSOLAR OPTION, WILL DO FOR
CAMBRIDGE WHAT SOLAR PANELS CAN NEVER DO. THE EARLIER VERSION OF
THE PETITION OFFERED THE GREAT POTENTIAL TO REDUCE HEAT, ABSORB
STORMWATER, IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND GENERATE CLEAN ENERGY. LET'S
REMEMBER, THERE'S PLENTY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. IS THERE A MOTION TO EXTEND?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SO MOVED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOTION TO EXTEND YOUR TIME. ROLL CALL?
>> TWO MINUTES GOES FAST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE TO DO A ROLL CALL. EVERYTHING IS ROLL
CALL THESE DAYS. CLERK WILSON?
>> MR. CLERK: EXTENDING THE TIME FOR FORMER VICE MAYOR JAN
DEVEREUX: (ROLL CALL).

Motion to Suspend the rules to
allow Jan Devereaux to speak
beyond the 2 minutse.

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: SORRY. I JOINED AFTER THE INITIAL ROLL CALL.
I'M HERE AND I DO VOTE ALSO TO EXTEND.
>> MR. CLERK: SEVEN IN FAVOR AND TWO ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> I WAS SAYING, REMEMBER THERE'S PLENTY OF UNTAPPED POTENTIAL FOR
SOLAR ONLY ON EXISTING BUILDINGS OF ALL TYPES. LET'S MAKE SURE WHEN
PROPERTY OWNERS REPLACE THEIR ROOFS OR RENOVATE, THEY
UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF INSTALLING SOLAR AND HAVING INCENTIVES
TO DO SO. COMPARED TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EXISTING ROOFS
AVAILABLE FOR SOLAR ONLY INSTALLATIONS, THE NUMBER OF LARGE NEW


PAGE 4

MAY 3, 2021

COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONAL AND LAB BUILDINGS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT
TO THE ORDINANCE AS THE PETITION STANDS IS RELATIVELY SMALL. THE
POTENTIAL IS GREAT AND THE MESSAGE IT SENDS TO POLICY MAKERS IN
OTHER CITIES IS HUGE. INCLUDING THE BENEFITS OF INSTALLATION AND
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND THE ABILITY OF A COOLER SURFACE TO
PROLONG THE LIFE OF A ROOF, A GREEN OR A BIOSOLAR ROOF CAN BE COST
EFFECTIVE OVER THE LIFE OF A BUILDING AND IT IS IMMEDIATELY BENEFICIAL
TO COMMUNITY HEALTH. CAMBRIDGE PRIDES ITSELF AS A LEADER ON
CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, BUT WE ARE FALLING BEHIND. THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH UP AND TO LEAD. PLEASE DON'T LET IT PASS YOU
BY. THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME MORE TIME. HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE NATHAN FOSTER. FOLLOWED BY
AMY OLIVER.
>> MAYOR, JENN JAMES HAS JOINED IF YOU WANT TO RECALL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SURE.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. I WAS ON MUTE. I'M HERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: I WASN'T EXPECTED TO ACTUALLY SPEAK TONIGHT BECAUSE
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK OUT OTHER THINGS, BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
SINCE I HAVE YOU GUYS... I HAVE BEEN FACED WITH SOME REALLY SERIOUS
SAFETY ISSUE S IN MY SON'S LIFE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JENN, I'M SORRY. FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT, YOU
HAVE TO SPEAK TO AN ITEM ON THE AGENDA.
>> PARTICIPANT: RIGHT. YOU CALLED MY NAME AND I GOT TEXT MESSAGES
SAYING THAT YOU MENTIONED MY NAME. IF I CAN'T ADDRESS THIS AGENDA
ITEM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THERE THREE EMAILS AGO, I'D SPEAK TO
IT. I CAN HAPPILY LOG OFF AND ATTEND THE NEXT MEETING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SURE. WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON WHAT WE
MEAN BY SOMETHING ON THE AGENDA VERSUS NOT.
>> PARTICIPANT: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN POINTED THAT OUT TO ME, BUT
I'M HERE IF ANYBODY HAS TO REACH ME. I'M WILLING TO TALK AT ANYTIME.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NATHAN FOSTER FOLLOWED BY AMY OLIVER.
>> GOING TO KARA. PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. I'M CARRAH, LIVE AT 476 FRANKLIN STREET. I'M AT THE
FREE TO FLUSH CAMPAIGN THAT CREATED A BATHROOM BILL OF RIGHTS.
RESTROOM ACCESS IS A HUMAN RIGHT. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS STATEMENT.
WE IMPLORE THE COUNCIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE RESTROOM ACCESS IS A
HUMAN RIGHT IN CAMBRIDGE. IN DOING SO, THEY WILL LEAD THE WAY AND
AFFIRMING BATHROOM ACCESS. WE HAVE RECEIVED 245 SIGNATURES ON
THE BATHROOM BILL OF RIGHTS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED FROM HARVARD
AND CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IT IS A PRIORITY TO MANY.


PAGE 5

MAY 3, 2021

ACKNOWLEDGING RESTROOM ACCESS HAS A HUMAN RIGHT MEANS THE CITY
COUNCIL, THE CITY WILL PRIORITIZE PROVIDING ACCESS TO BATHROOMS FOR
ALL IN THE CITY. PARTICULARLY, THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OUR
BATHROOM BILL OF RIGHTS HAS ACTION ITEMS CREATED BY COMMUNITY
MEMBERS TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITY, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITY
MEMBERS, TO CREATE RESTROOMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE, AFFORDABLE, SAFE,
ACCEPTABLE, AND ACCESSIBLE.
SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEXT STEPS, THE COMMUNITY
MEMBERS HAVE SUGGESTED ARE CREATING A BATHROOM FUND THAT THE
CITY BUSINESSES AND UNIVERSITIES CONTRIBUTE TO THAT IS USED FOR
CLEANING AND MAINTAINING. AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PORTA
POTTIES STATIONED IN PUBLIC AREAS AND PARKS. CLEANING PUBLIC
RESTROOMS SEVERAL TIMES PER DAY. AND PROVIDING ADEQUATE LIGHTING
IN AND AROUND THE RESTROOMS. AND CREATING A CULTURE FREE FROM
HARASSMENT WHEN INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR OTHER
COMMUNITY MEMBERS ASK TO USE RESTROOMS IN BUILDINGS. SIX,
DECRIMINALIZE PUBLIC URINATION AND DEFECATION. WE LOOK FORWARD
TO THE WORK WITH THE CITY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC RESTROOM ACCESS FOR
ALL CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. EDWARD WOLL.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. I'M EDWARD WOLL, 79 DANA STREET. I'M
HERE ON SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MOTHERS OUT FRONT. MAYOR SIDDIQUI,
COUNCILLORS, I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF
THE GREEN ROOF ZONING PETITION. THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE HAS
SUPPORTED AND BEEN A LEADER OF REPLACING FOSSIL FUELS, 100%
RENEWABLE ENERGY, MITIGATING THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE,
COUNTERING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, THE GREEN ROOFS ZONING
PETITION SUPPORTS MANY OF THE INITIATIVES AND ACTION TAKEN BY THE
CITY COUNCIL AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF A URBAN
FOREST PROGRAM. URBAN HEATING AND HEAT ISLANDS, IT IS STRIKES HOW
SERVICES MITIGATE THE HEATING IMPACT. THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS IS CLEAR.
RELEVANCE IS THE ARTICLE IN THE ADDENDUM, ATTACHED TO MY WRITTEN
TESTIMONY, GREEN ROOFS, INCLUDING URBAN CULTURE AND WATER BODIES
HAVE BEEN SHOW TO BE EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE URBAN TEMPERATURES.
THE COOLING EFFECTS ON THE TEMPERATURE AND THE ROOF TEMPERATURE
SURFACES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF GREEN
ROOFS, IN GENERAL, THEY CAN INCREASE THE EVAPORATION, REDUCE SPACE
FOR CLIMATE, CONDITIONING, THROUGH THE SHADING AND IMPROVE
INSULATION VALUES. THEY CAN REDUCE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT AND
CONSUMPTION. AND THE USE HAS BEEN KNOWN SINCE ANCIENT TIMES BY
HOT AND COLD CLIMATES. THEY ARE USED TO ALLEVIATE ENVIRONMENTAL
PROBLEMS WITH THE ISLAND HEAT EFFECT. I SUPPORT THE GREEN ROOFS
ORDINANCE AND THE OPPORTUNITY IT OFFERS TO MITIGATE URBAN HEAT
ISLANDS AND THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY. AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE GREEN ROOFS

ORDINANCE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE RIA MAZUMDAR.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, LIVING AT 31 WALDEN
STREET. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRIPS WAIVER WITH REGARD TO
VACCINE MANUFACTURING. I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE GO AHEAD
AND WAIVE THE CURRENT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RULES. THE FIRST THING
I WILL TALK ABOUT IS JUST HOW DIRE THE SITUATION IS IN INDIA. THERE IS
NO SUPPLY OF OXYGEN LEFT AND PEOPLE RELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND BLACK
MARKET FOR OXYGEN TO SURVIVE. THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE STATE TO
PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES. THEY HAVE FAILED TO DO IT AND THE ONLY WAY WE
REALLY HAVE ANY HOPE TO CONTAIN THE PANDEMIC THERE IS TO HELP BY
WAIVING THE RULES. AND THE SECOND THING, I REALLY WANT TO
EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH THIS IS IN THE U.S. SELF INTEREST. WE HAVE SEEN
EVIDENCE OF THE MUTANTS IN INDIA HAVING A HOLD HERE AND TO SOME
EXTENT, WE SEEM TO BE VACCINE RESISTANT. PEOPLE HAVE GOT BOTH
DOSES STILL HAVE GOTTEN SICK. WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE CONSEQUENCES
OF THIS PLAY OUT. I THINK IT IS CLEAR, UNLESS WE DO EVERYTHING TO HELP
THE SPREAD IN THE MOST POPULIST COUNTRY, WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH HOPE HERE. THE FINAL THING TO NOTE, INDIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTING VACCINE THROUGHOUT THE GLOBAL
SOUTH, I BELIEVE OVER 70 COUNTRIES, INDIA EXPORTED VACCINE TO.
WITHOUT RELYING ON THEM CONTINUING TO EXPORT WHEN THEY ARE
FIXATED ON HANDLING THEIR CRISIS, THIS WILL HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT FOR
ALL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND WEALTHIER COUNTRIES. AND REALLY AS
SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF FAMILY IN INDIA, SOMEONE HEARD OF
FRIENDS OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF FRIENDS DYING, IT IS. THINGS ARE
OPENING UP HERE, BUT IT IS REALLY BAD. PLEASE, PLEASE TAKES ACTION.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BEFORE ADRIAN. THE FORMER MAYOR HENRIETTA
DAVIS HAS JOINED US.
>> YOU NEED TO UNMUTE YOURSELF. PLEASE DIAL STAR 6 TO UNMUTE.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY LUCK?
>> PARTICIPANT: I'M TRYING. I'M LOOKING FOR MY TESTIMONY, WHICH IS
ELSEWHERE HERE. UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T GET ALL THE DEVICES IN SYNC.
GOOD EVENING. THIS IS FORMER MAYOR, AS YOU POINTED OUT. I HAVE
SUBMITTED TESTIMONY TO YOU. 120 CHESTNUT STREET, CAMBRIDGE. I
HAVE BEEN SERVING ON THE NET ZERO TASK FORCE AND I'M ON THE REDONE
TASK FORCE NOW. I'M VERY PROUD TO BE MEMBER OF THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE LEAD IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, NOT JUST
STATEWIDE WHERE BOSTON MAGAZINE RECOGNIZED US AS NUMBER ONE
AND ALSO NATIONALLY. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE US TO DO NOW IS TO
CONTINUE THAT LEADERSHIP BY MANDATING SOLAR ON ROOFTOPS. AS YOU
ALL KNOW, HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO MANDATE WHAT GOES ON A
ROOFTOP IS A GREAT POWER. AND WHAT I'M AFRAID IS HAPPENING NOW,

PAGE 7

MAY 3, 2021

WITH NOT HAVING A SOLAR ONLY OPTION, WE SQUANDER THE OPPORTUNITY
TO ADD SOLAR. THERE MAY BE ROOFTOPS WITH SOLAR, THAT'S NOT WHERE
THE GROWTH IS HAPPENING. IT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR
AND THAT'S THE PART THAT WOULD BE ELIMINATED FROM THE
REQUIREMENT AND REQUIRE TO HAVE A BIOSOLAR ROOF FOR VEGETATED
ROOF. THOSE ROOFS ACCOMPLISH OTHER MATTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
ADDRESS REALLY CLIMATE ISSUES THE WAY WE WOULD ALL HOPE THEY
MIGHT. ONE THING, A VERY TALL BUILDING IS NOT GOING TO BE GREAT WITH
THE VEGETATIVE ROOF.
I HOPE YOU WILL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOLAR ROOFS
MANDATED, BIOSOLAR MAY MEET THE REQUIREMENT, BUT I THINK WE
REALLY NEED TO TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN TO ADD SOLAR TO THE
ROOFTOPS. AND ELIMINATE THIS LARGE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS WITHIN THE
STATE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS THERE A MOTION TO EXTEND
>> PARTICIPANT: I'M DONE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M SORRY FOR MY TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO PROBLEM.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ADRIAN SERVETNICK.
>> PARTICIPANT: GOOD EVENING. 9 KINNAIRD STREET. I'M HERE TO SPEAK
ABOUT THE GREEN ROOFS PETITIONS. I WANT TO START BY THANKS
MOTHERS OUT FRONT TO BRING THIS FORWARD. IT IS PUSHING ALONG A
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW BEST TO USE ROOF AREA TO MITIGATE
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND I THINK THE CURRENT PETITION IS A STRONG
SIGNAL THAT CAMBRIDGE WANTS TO PRIORITIZE EFFICIENCY AND RESILIENCY.
I WILL INDULGE IN BEING A CRANK. LAST WEEK'S DISCUSSION HAD
FRUSTRATING CONTRADICTIONS. ON THE ONE HAND, MAJORITY OF THE
COUNCIL VOTED TO INTRODUCE A NEW REQUIREMENT ON COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT, IT WOULD MANDATE THE INCLUSION OF GREENER BIOSOLAR
ROOFS, ASSESSING THEY FEASIBLE, FINANCIAL, AND DESIRABLE.
THE COUNCIL VOTED TO EXCLUDE MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS FROM THE
RETIREMENT BECAUSE GREEN ROOF AND BIOSOLAR BUILD OUT IS COSTLY
COMPLICATED AND NOT WORTH THE TRADE OFFS WITH EMISSIONS AND
COST. THE TWO POSITIONS JUST DON'T SQUARE. AND I THINK IT REFLECTS
THE FACT THAT AS MUCH AS ADVOCATES SAY BISOLAR ROOFS ARE SCIENCE,
THEY ARE NOT. HARVARD UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY, ABOUT
EXPERT AS A TESTIMONY AS YOU CAN GETTING REINFORCE THIS WHEN THEY
SET BISOLAR IS NOT SETTLED SCIENCE. PURE SOLAR IS A GREAT OPTION AND
IMPACTFUL AROUND BUILDING EMISSIONS. I URGE YOU TO REMOVE THE
LANGUAGE AROUND REQUIRED GREEN ROOF AND BISOLAR ON COMMERCIAL


PAGE 8

MAY 3, 2021

BUILDING. PUTTING A LARGE ARRAY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE CLIMATE
CHANGE MITIGATION SOLUTION THAT THE CITY CAN REQUIRE. AGAIN, ALL OF
MY CRITICISMS ASIDE, I WILL THANK THE COUNCIL AND MOTHERS OUT FRONT
WORKING TO CREATE A PETITION THAT WILL HELP MITIGATE CLIMATE
CHANGE. AND FOR INCLUDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXEMPTIONS AND
PURE SOLAR AS A OPTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MELISSA LUDTKE.
>> MELISSA, GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: I WAS BEING UNMUTED. HI. 30 BUENA VISTA PARK. I WAS
GOING TO ONLY SPEAK REALLY FROM MY HEART, LITERALLY FROM A
MOTHER'S HEART. ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD
BEFORE FROM OTHER PEOPLE ASKING US TO THINK NOT JUST ABOUT THIS
MOMENT IN OUR CITY, BUT ABOUT THE MOMENTS THAT FUTURE
GENERATIONS WILL HAVE HERE. AND I'M COMPELLED AT THIS POINT
WITHOUT HAVING PREPARED, BUT I'M GOING TO SPEAK AGAIN FROM THE
HEART. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS BECAUSE I WANT
TO JUST SAY RESPECTFULLY THAT I BELIEVE THEY ARE WRONG.
WE HAVE SPENT MANY, MANY TIMES AND I'M SPEAKING FOR MOTHERS OUT
FRONT, LEARNING FROM THOSE WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH GREEN
ROOFS. IN FACT, MANY OF THE LAB BUILDINGS AND LARGER BUILDINGS WE
TALK ABOUT IS CORPORATE STRUCTURES, ACTUALLY DO BETTER WITH
VEGETATIVE ROOFS THAN THEY DO WITH SOLAR. I WILL EXPLAIN WHY AS
BRIEFLY AND AS CLEARLY AS I CAN.
THERE ARE OFTEN INTRUSIVE MECHANICALS AND THE REST ON THE ROOFS
THAT PRODUCE SHADE THAT DOESN'T MAKE SOLAR THE BEST OPTION.
THOSE ROOFS CAN GET EXCEEDINGLY HOT IN THE SUMMERS AND THE SOLAR
PANELS DO WANT WORK TO THEIR BEST EFFICIENCY. LASTLY, THERE CAN BE
SHADING AROUND THE BUILDINGS, WHICH ALSO MAKE A VEGETATIVE ROOF
HIGHLY PREFERABLE AND THEY LET US REMEMBER THAT VEGETATIVE ROOFS
ARE AS SYSTEMIC SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I ECHO THE FORMER VICE
MAYOR'S CAUTIONARY WORDS TO US THAT WE HAVE MANY ROOFS IN
CAMBRIDGE WHERE WE CAN USE SOLAR TO ITS FINEST EXTENT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. APARNA GOPALAN.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. I'M HERE TO SORRY. I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF
THE VACCINE RESOLUTION. ON THE 16TH OF APRIL, A 65 YEAR OLD
FREELANCE JOURNALISTS, WHO WAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF INDIA'S
LARGEST STATE, TWEETED THE OXYGEN LEVEL FALLEN TO 52 AND NO
HOSPITAL, DOCTOR, OR LAB PICKED UP THE PHONE. JUST ABOUT 24 HOURS
LATER THE NEXT DAY, NOW THE OXYGEN IS 21. WHEN WILL SOMEONE
COME. MINUTES LATER HE WAS DEAD. THIS IS THE SITUATION GOING ON IN
INDIA AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ARGUMENT FOR NOT FREEING THE
VACCINE FROM THE PATENTS. NO REASON THAT PFIZER AND MODERNA
CANNOT SACRIFICE A TINY BIT OF PROFITS IN ORDER FOR LITERALLY MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE ALIVE.


PAGE 9

MAY 3, 2021

I THINK AS THE CITY THAT IS HOUSING MODERNA, WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO REASSERT THIS VACCINE WAS MADE WITH TAXPAYER FUNDS AND MORE
THAN THE HUMANE THING TO DO TO FREE THE VACCINE. I URGE THE
COUNCIL AND THE COUNCILLORS TO CONSIDER FUTURE RESOLUTIONS TO
PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT IN INDIA OR TO RELEASE A STATEMENT SAYING
THAT THE AID BEING SENT, INCLUDING THE PATENTS BEING FREED, HAVE TO
BE USED TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES RATHER THAN JUST BEING RATHER THAN
SITTING AT THE AIRPORT IN CUSTOMS. WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
OXYGEN, WHICH IS SENT FROM THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS NOT
HUMANITARIAN AID. EVERYBODY SUPPORTING THIS TO CONSIDER FUTURE
STATEMENTS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE GO TO MIKE NAKAGAWA.
>> PARTICIPANT: HELLO. 51 MADISON AVENUE, NORTH CAMBRIDGE.
SPEAKING ABOUT THE GREEN ROOFS ZONING. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
PART OF THE CITY'S CLIMATE CHANGE PREPAREDNESS AND RESILIENCY
PLANNING. STARTED OUT AS PREPAREDNESS AND ADDED RESILIENCY AND
THE ZONING TASK FORCE AND GREEN ROOFING REALLY STANDS OUT IS NOT
SO MUCH ON MITIGATION, BUT ON RESILIENCY. IT IS NOT PRIMARILY ABOUT
HOW PEOPLE EFFECT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT RESILIENCY. HOW TO ADDRESS
HOW THE CHANGE IN CLIMATE WILL AFFECT PEOPLE. IN PARTICULAR, THIS
APPLIES TO GREEN VERSUS SOLAR ONLY OPTIONS. I'M RESIGNED TO THE
FACT WE'LL CONTINUE TO BUILD LIKE CRAZY AND THAT'S DRIVING UP COSTS,
LAND COST IN THE PROCESS. AND REALLY WHEN THE STARTING POINT OF
BUYING LAND IS SO HIGH, TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT IS
POINTLESS.
BY REMOVING SETBACKS AND BUILDING ACROSS THE ENTIRE SITE, EXCEPT
FOR THE SIDEWALKS, WE ARE PERMANENTLY REMOVING PLACES FOR TREES
AND PLANTS, WHICH HAVE MULTIPLE RESILIENCY BENEFITS. AND IF THERE IS
NO PLACE FOR GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE GROUND LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'S A
BUILDING ON TOP OF THE PLANTING AREA, AT LEAST LET THE PLANTS OCCUPY
THE SAME SPACE, PUT THEM ON TOP. AT LEAST THE PLANTS CAN GET THE
SUN RATHER THAN BEING SHADED BY TALL BUILDINGS. WE NEED TO MAKE
SURE THAT NEW BUILDINGS THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED TO HANDLE GREEN
ROOFS BECAUSE MANY TIMES IT IS HARD TO RETROFIT AN EXISTING
BUILDING. BUILDINGS NOW WILL BE THERE WHEN THE BRUNT OF EFFECTS
START TO HIT. THIS PETITION IS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE LOCAL
RESILIENCY FOR A LIVABLE CITY IN THE FUTURE. PLEASE VOTE TO REQUIRE
NEW LARGE BUILDINGS TO HELP WITH THIS GOAL WITH THE GREEN OPTIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE AMIR MOHAREB.
>> AMIR AND JACOB HAVE NOT JOINED. HANNAH MAHONEY, GO AHEAD.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME. I'M HANNAH. 7 RINDGE TERRACE.
MEMBER OF MOTHERS OUT FRONT AND I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE REVISED
GREEN ROOFS ORDINANCE. I LOOK DOWN THE STREET FROM THE O'NEILL
LIBRARY, WITH THE GREAT MURAL OF TIP O'NEILL AND THE SAYING, ALL


PAGE 10

MAY 3, 2021

POLITICS IS LOCAL. I THINK ABOUT THAT A LOT. I THINK ABOUT CLIMATE
CHANGE A LOT. IT CAN FEEL SO OVERWHELMING AND GLOBAL AND HUGE.
MELTING GLACIERS, RISING SEA LEVELS, DROUGHTS AND WILDFIRES. I SEE
THIS IN THE NEWS FEED, I WILL CONTROL PASS IT AND FOCUS ON STORIES OF
LOCAL SUCCESSES. A GAS BAN PUT INTO EFFECT MUNICIPALITY. A WIND
FARM APPROVED AND TREES BEING GIVING AWAY.
AND IN THE CONTEXT OF GREEN ROOFS, I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE
APARTMENT BUILDING IN MID CAMBRIDGE WHERE WE LIVED WHEN OUR
DAUGHTER WAS BORN. IT HAD A TINY GREEN SPACE AND ACCESS TO THE
LIBRARY PARK AND PLAYGROUNDS. WE HAD A SMALL ROOFTOP AREA. IT
WAS THERE THAT EMILY LEARNED TO PLANT SEEDS IN POTS, WATER, AND
WATCH THEM GROW. WE WOULD SNIP BASEL FOR PIZZA, AND EAT
WONDERFUL MEALS UP THERE. SHE IS NOW A CRLS, ABOUT TO GRADUATE
FROM COLLEGE AND COMMISSION INTO THE U.S. NAVY. AS HEADING OUT, I
WANT SO MUCH FOR THAT WORLD TO BE A SUSTAINABLE ONE. IN WHICH
SHE WILL BE ABLE TO THRIVE.
SO, IN RESPONSE TO THE BIG PROBLEM OF MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE,
FROM MY DAUGHTER AND ALL OUR CHILDREN, LET'S TAKE OUR LEAD FROM
TIP O'NEILL, TAKE THIS DOABLE STEP FORWARD INTO A SUSTAINABLE WORLD
AND SUPPORT GREEN ROOFS IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BACK TO AMIR, WHO IS BACK ON.
>> PARTICIPANT: SORRY FOR THE DELAY AND APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE.
I'M HONORED AND PRIVILEGE TO ADDRESS THE COUNCIL TODAY. I LIVE IN
CAMBRIDGE. A PHYSICIAN WORKING AT MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND MY
FOCUS IS ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES. I WANT TO COMMENT ON POLICY ORDER
7, WHICH RELATES TO SUPPORT FOR A WAIVER FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
PATENTS FOR COVID RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE VACCINE. I
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, AS MANY OF US HAVE, BY EITHER IMAGES OR DIRECT
PERSONAL STORIES. THEY COME FROM OVERSEAS ABOUT HOW THE COVID
PANDEMIC IS RANGING IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES. I WANT
TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH WE KIND OF LIVE IN AND ALL WORK AND ACT
LOCALLY, WE HAVE A LOT TO BEAR IN WHAT HAPPENS OVERSEAS BECAUSE
THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MADE IN OUR BACK DOOR HAVE THE
POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE
THAT, I WORK IN THE HOSPITAL, I'M CONVINCED WHEN I SEE PATIENTS AND
WHEN I SEE THE COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY COVID, I SEE IT AS AN
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE HELP OF THOSE OVERSEAS. WHEN THE
PANDEMIC RAGES OVERSEAS, IT IS LIKELY TO COME BACK TO OUR DOORSTEPS
IN THE FUTURE. I SUPPORT ANY KIND OF MEASURE THAT SYMBOLICALLY OR
PRACTICALLY PUSHES FOR A WAIVER OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PATENTS
WITH COVID RELATED TECHNOLOGIES.
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. I THANK
YOU ALL FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AND FOR CONSIDER THIS MEASURE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE MINGA

CLAGGETTBORNE.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. YOU SAID MY NAME VERY WELL, NOT
EVERYBODY CAN SAY IT. I LIVE AT 7 PLEASANT PLACE. I'M SPEAKING ALSO
FROM MY HEART. I DON'T KNOW SOME OF THE NUANCES AROUND
WHETHER WE NEED MORE SOLAR PANELS OR WE NEED JUST VEGETATION ON
THE ROOFS, BUT I'M SPEAKING FOR THE GREEN ROOF PROPOSAL. I WANT TO
SPEAK FROM A POINT OF VIEW AS A MOTHER, AND AS A PERSON WHO HAS
ADMIRED THE EDUCATION THAT GOES ON TO MY TWO CHILDREN THAT
GREW UP IN THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL SYSTEM.
I FEEL THAT THE GREEN ROOFS PROPOSAL WILL REALLY HELP TIE TOGETHER
PUBLIC HEALTH AND EDUCATION THAT WE WANT TO OFFER OUR KIDS. MY
CHILD, WHEN HE WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD, PLAYED ON THE ROOF OF
THE FLETCHER MAYNARD ACADEMY BUILDING, PRETTY ILLEGAL RIGHT NOW,
IMAGINE ALL THE POTENTIAL THAT WE CAN DO ON THE ROOFS AND HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS TO USE THIS SPACE FOR GREENERY AND FOR TEACHING OUR
KIDS WHAT WAYS CAMBRIDGE HAS MADE STEPS TOWARDS HEALTH.
I THINK IT WILL BE A REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR OWN CURRENT HEALTH,
BUT ALSO AS A MODEL FOR OUR KIDS. KIDS SEE CRANES, KIDS SEE ALL THE
CONSTRUCTION, MY THREE YEAR OLD LOVED WATCHING THE GARBAGE
TRUCKS. WE HAVE DONE AMAZING THINGS WITH RECYCLING AND WE NEED
TO HAVE THE INTEGRITY OF PUTTING UP GREEN ROOFS. SO, ONE OF MY
WORDS OF WISDOM COMES FROM OUR LOCAL DAVID HENRY THOREAU, IF
YOU BUILT CASTLES IN THE SKY, WELL THAT WORK IS NOT LOST. JUST PUT
FOUNDATION UNDER THEM. LET'S PUT MORE GREENERY AND SOLAR PANELS
ON OUR ROOFS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MATTHEW MCWEENEY.
>> MATTHEW, PLEASE UPGRADE YOUR VERSION OF ZOOM, THEN COME
BACK AND RAISE YOUR HAND. WE'LL CALL ON YOU AGAIN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS SHARON THERE?
>> GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. SHARON, YOU NEED TO UNMUTE
YOURSELF. CHARLES FRANKLIN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> PARTICIPANT: CAN YOU HEAR ME? 162 HAMPSHIRE STREET IN
CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT IN STRONG SUPPORT
OF POLICY ORDER SIX. SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE CURRENT RACIAL AND
SOCIOECONOMIC EQUALITY GOALS AND VALUES. HOMEOWNERSHIPS HAS
BENEFITS FROM THE HOUSING STABILITY AND AGENCY TO THE FINANCIAL
STABILITY AND WEALTH BUILDING. WHEN YOU OWN A HOME, YOU CAN STAY
WITHOUT FEAR OF NO FAULT EVICTION. PASS YOUR HOME DOWN TO YOUR
CHILDREN, OR SELL IT WHEN YOU WANT IT TO WHO YOU WANT FOR WHAT
YOU WANT. GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFITS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP, MY
UPSTAIRS NEIGHBORS, USED THE SECOND MORTGAGE TO PAY FOR THE
COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR THEIR SON. A WONDERFUL WAY TO USE A HOME
AND CREATE THAT BENEFIT FOR YOUR FAMILY.
FOR LARGE SECTIONS OF 20TH CENTURY, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT


PAGE 12

MAY 3, 2021

SUBSIDIZED HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR WHITE FAMILIES WHILE DENYING
BENEFITS FROM BLACK FAMILIES. THE CURRENT AFFORDABLE
HOMEOWNERSHIP DOES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HOUSING STABILITY AND
SOME ECONOMIC BENEFITS, IT REALLY IS A MISNOMER AS IT CONTINUES TO
DENY APPLICANTS THE FULL AGENCY AND BENEFITS OF TRUE
HOMEOWNERSHIP. I DON'T SEE HOW WE SAY WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE
EXCUSE ME. I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN SAY WE CREATE RACIAL AND
ECONOMIC JUSTICE, AND THEN TURN AROUND AND TELL BLACK FAMILIES
THEY CAN'T HAVE THE SAME BENEFITS THAT WHITE FAMILIES HAVE ENJOYED
FOR THE BETTER PART OF A CENTURY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CITY CAN'T JUST GIVE MONEY AWAY WITHOUT
ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN RETURN UPON TIME OF SALE. IT IS NOT
SUSTAINABLE. THIS SHALL WHY I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER SIX, A NEED TO
EXPLORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO PROVIDE HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT GREATER
ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF SOCIOECONOMIC AND RACIAL EQUITY THAN OUR
CURRENT SYSTEM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO NATHAN FOSTER.
>> PARTICIPANT: HI, EVERYBODY. I'M NATHAN FOSTER. FORMER
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND I'M CURRENTLY A VOLUNTEER FOR THE VACCINE
BOSTON AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDER SEVEN. THE
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE TRIPS WAIVER. CAMBRIDGE REALLY AS THE
HOME OF THE GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS OF MODERNA AND A BIO TECH HUB,
HAS A VOICE IN CALLING FOR ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CREATED
IN PLACES LIKE CAMBRIDGE TO BE SHARED WITH THE WORLD. I THINK WE
HAVE ALL SEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN
INDIA AND BRAZIL AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE COVID PANDEMIC
CONTINUES TO RANGE WE HAVE LOST COUNTLESS LIVES TO IMPACT S
PEOPLE. AND THE FACT THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
JUST MEANS THAT BASIC FAIRNESS MEANS WE NEED TO SHARE THEM AS
WIDELY AS POSSIBLE. THE TRIPS WAIVER WOULD LIFT GLOBAL
TEMPORARILY LIFT GLOBAL PATENTS ON THE VACCINES SO IT CAN SCALE UP.
IT IS NOT THE ONLY BARRIER TO CREATING MORE VACCINES TO BE LIFTED.
YOU HAVE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING
CAPABILITY.
IT IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE AND PRETTY FOUNDATIONAL THAT
COMPANIES AND COUNTRIES NEED TO KNOW THEY CAN MAKE VACCINES
WITHOUT GETTING SUED OR WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF GLOBAL TRADE
LAW. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE
SPONSORS OF THE RESOLUTION FOR THE LEADERSHIP. AND STANDING UP
FOR GLOBAL ACCESS TO VACCINE AND ENDING THE PANDEMIC MORE
QUICKLY. THANK YOU. I HOPE THAT THIS RESOLUTION PASSES TODAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE WILL GO TO MATTHEW. AND THEN PETER
CRAWLEY. OF.
>> MATTHEW, UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> PARTICIPANT: SORRY ABOUT THAT. 125 SPRING STREET IN EAST

PAGE 13

MAY 3, 2021

CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF, I'M SURE IN AGREEMENT
WITH MANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE GREEN ROOFS INITIATIVES. I THINK
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO GREEN MORE ROOFS AND MORE SPACE IN OUR
CITY. AND I VIEW IT AS AN INVESTMENT THE FUTURE, THE FUTURE OF OUR
CHILDREN AND RESIDENTS OF CAMBRIDGE, BUT THE FUTURE OF OUR
COUNTRY. IT IS A CHANCE FOR CAMBRIDGE TO LEAD BOTH THE
COMMONWEALTH AND THE REST OF THE NATIONS. I WILL KEEP MY
COMMENTS BRIEF TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE PETER CRAWLEY.
>> PARTICIPANT: YES. CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. 88 THORNDIKE STREET. AND
MY VIEWS ARE MY OWN, THOUGH THEY ARE INFORMED BY MY
PARTICIPATION IN THE NET ZERO ACTION PLAN WORKING GROUP AS WELL AS
THE CPAC COMMITTEE.
I WANTED TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ADOPTING THE GREEN ROOFS PETITION.
ORIGINALLY, SPONSORED BY MOTHERS OUT FRONT. AS MANY OF THE OTHER
SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED, WE'RE REALLY AT AN INFLECTION POINT WITH
CLIMATE CHANGE. THE URGENCY CANNOT BE MINIMIZED AND WE NEED ALL
HANDS DECK AND ALL THE VARIOUS PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS TO BE
ADOPTED.
SO, IT DOES PAIN ME TO SEE SOLAR SOLUTIONS PITTED AGAINST GREEN
ROOFS SOLUTIONS. I THINK THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. AND WE SHOULD
RECOGNIZE THAT SOLAR INSTALLATIONS WILL PRODUCE A MINUSCULE
AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN RELATION TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY USED BY A
LAB BUILDING, FOR INSTANCE. I'D BE INTERESTED IN THE STUDY COMPARING
THAT TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY SAVED IN THE COOLING AND HEATING
SEASONS OF A WELL INSULATED GREEN ROOF. VEGETATIVE ROOFS ARE A
SYSTEMIC SOLUTION THAT PROVIDE MANY OTHER BENEFITS FROM AIR
QUALITY TO GREEN SPACE CREATION AND AS WE LOSE GREEN SPACE AS A
CITY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> PARTICIPANT: ON THE PEDESTRIAN
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IF THERE IS A MOTION TO EXTEND, I'M HAPPY TO
EXTEND.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SO MOVED IF PETER HAS MORE. IF NOT, HE CAN
SEND COMMENTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE'LL GO TO HEATHER HOFFMAN AND THEN
NICOLE WILLIAMS.
>> PARTICIPANT: 213 HURLEY STREET. I WILL SPEAK ABOUT AFFORDABLE
HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT WE HAVE VARIOUS
GOALS THAT WE WANT TO REACH AND WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHICH
ONES WE CAN REACH AND HOW TO GET AT LEAST PARTLY TO ALL OF THEM.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF OUR ENTIRE ECONOMIC SYSTEM THESE DAYS IS
THAT WE VIEW REAL ESTATE LESS AS A PLACE WHERE IMPORTANT THINGS


PAGE 14

MAY 3, 2021

FOR SOCIETY HAPPENS AND MORE AS AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE. AND REALLY
FOR ALL OF US, THEY SHOULD BE IMPORTANT PLACES, LIKE HOMES. WITH
RESPECT TO GREEN ROOFS. I WANT TO ADOPT THE COMMENTS OF PETER
CRAWLY, MIKE, JAN, AND MELISSA, AND I WILL ADD A COUPLE OF THINGS TO
THEM.
ONE, YOU CAN GET THE ENERGY FROM SOLAR PANELS TO A PLACE, THROUGH
THE MAGICAL THINGS CALLED WIRES. THE SOLAR PANELS DON'T HAVE TO BE
THERE. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE ENERGY AND USE IT,
BUT GREEN THINGS DO NEED TO BE THERE. THEY ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT
ON PLACE AND THE VALUE THEY CREATE FOR US, BOTH PHYSICAL AND
MENTAL, IS TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON WHERE THEY ARE.
AND I WOULD POINT OUT WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, 2072
MASS AVENUE IS PROPOSING A GREEN ROOF. I GUESS IS POSSIBLE. FINALLY, I
WILL POINT OUT, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, HAS BEEN PRODUCING
TRANSPARENT SOLAR MATERIALS THAT YOU CAN PUT ON WINDOWS. THEY
CAN DO AS WELL AS ROOFTOPS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. GOING TO NICOLA WILLIAMS. I'M SORRY.
AMY OLIVER IS BACK. AMY OLIVER AND THEN NICOLA WILLIAMS.
>> PARTICIPANT: THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME? 38 ORCHARD STREET.
I'M THE ORIGINAL PETITIONER FOR MOTHERS OUT FRONT FOR GREEN,
VEGETATIVE, AND BISOLAR ROOFS. A SMALL AND DEDICATED TEAM OF
VOLUNTEERS CITIZENS WITH MOTHERS OUT FRONT HAVE WORKED
TIRELESSLY ON THIS AGENDA FOR TWO YEARS. WE USED OUR SKILLS AS
MOTHERS AND ACTIVISTS TO BUILD AND MOVE THIS AGENDA FORWARD. WE
HAVE LISTENED, PRESENTED, COMPROMISED, TAKEN TO HEART
RECOMMENDATIONS, AMENDED ACCORDINGLY, PRESENTED MORE, AND
NOW WE ARE HERE.
WHEN I JOINED MOTHERS OUT FRONT TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS BORN AND
RAISED IN CAMBRIDGE, I KNEW NOTHING OF HOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
OPERATES. I'M STILL LEARNING. I DECIDED TO LOOK UP THE DEFINITION OF
LEGISLATURE TO SEE WHAT IS ASKED IN YOUR WORK AND WHAT STRUCK ME,
THE SIMILAR SKILLS REQUIRED OF MOTHERS RAISING CHILDREN AND KEEPING
THEM SAFE AND LEGISLATURES IN THEIR WORK. WE NEGOTIATE AND
COLLABORATE AND MAKE LAWS, WE SERVE ON COMMITTEES, DEBATE, AND
ANALYZE CONFLICT. WORK WITH BUDGETS, LISTEN TO AND ADDRESS
CONCERNS, AND WE INVITE COMPROMISE.
THERE IS NO SINGLE PATH FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE MANY CHALLENGES
OF TODAY'S CLIMATE. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TACKLE IT ON MANY
FRONTS. GREEN AND BIOSOLAR ROOFS ARE JUST ONE TOOL WE HAVE AT
OUR DISPOSAL THAT WE CAN ADOPT RIGHT NOW TO START TO MOVE THE
NEEDLE TOWARD A GREENER CAMBRIDGE. WE'LL ALL BE CALLED UPON
INCREASINGLY TO CONFRONT HOW WE LIVE OUR DAILY LIVES. THE GOAL FOR
A LIVABLE PLANET MUST BE ALL OUR CONCERNS. HOW WE GET THERE IS BY
MAKING BOLD CHOICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOW. I SUPPORT THE GREEN
ROOFS ORDINANCE. I WANT TO THANK THE COUNCILLORS FOR THIS TIME


PAGE 15

MAY 3, 2021

AND ALL YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS NICOLA WILLIAMS.
>> PARTICIPANT: 8 BREWER STREET. I APPRECIATE WE HAVE ALLOWED FOR
ACOUSTIC LIVE MUSIC FOR SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
WITHOUT A LICENSE. THE FACT THAT THE COUNCIL IS CONSIDER A BUDGET
FOR LEGAL RESEARCH, REQUESTING MORE FUNDS FOR HOUSING STABILITY,
HELPING INDIA AND RECOGNIZE THE ACUTE CRISIS WITH THE COVID 19.
POLICY ORDER AROUND BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES, LOOKING
FORWARD TO SEEING THAT MOVE FORWARD. I SUPPORT THE GREEN ROOFS
EFFORTS, CUTTING DOWN TREES IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE WHERE WE HAVE
THE MOST TOXIC SOIL, EXCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE. LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE DESERVING OF AN ENVIRONMENT.
IN FACT, WE NEED TO BUILD TWICE AS MANY TREES IF WE'LL CUT THEM
DOWN. AND ALLOW FOR THOSE TREES TO BE BUILT ON THE ROOF.
REGARDING THE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. I'M SO PLEASED TO SEE
THAT THERE'S THE NEEDLE IS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION. I HAVE BEEN
ADVOCATING FOR THIS FOR YEARS. WE NEED TO OFFER THE BEST CHANCE
FOR PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR HOMES. AND THE HOMEBRIDGE PROGRAM, I
DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE. I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE
SCRAPPED AND START FROM SCRATCH AND COME UP WITH SOME REAL
ECONOMIC JUSTICE, RACIAL, EQUITY PROGRAMS THAT REALLY WILL
EMPOWER PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR HOMES WITH DIGNITY AND PRIDE. MY
CONCERNS IS THAT THE MONIES SHOULD NOT GO INTO THE EXISTING
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST PROGRAM BY ITSELF. THEY ARE PRO RENTAL
AND NOT REALLY PRO HOMEOWNERSHIP. THINK ABOUT THE CRA AS AN
OPTION AS WELL TO SPLIT THE FUND. AND THINK ABOUT COOPERATIVE, I
THINK THE PLANNING NEEDS TO HAPPEN ON HOW WE'LL ACHIEVE THIS BOLD
PLAN OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND NOT PRIORITIZE COOPERATIVES AND
SOMETHING WE NEED TO REPRIORITIZE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE SARAH GALLOP.
>> PARTICIPANT: GOOD EVENING. I'M CO DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND
COMMUNITY RELATIONS AT MIT. I SPEAK ON THE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE.
I KNOW THAT THE CITY COUNCIL KNOWS THAT MIT SHARES THE SAME
COMMITMENT TO SLOWING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADVANCING
SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCY AND ENGAGED IN LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND
GLOBAL CLIMATE INITIATIVES. IN SHORT, OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE PLANET ARE ALIGNED.
IN KEEPING WITH THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC, WE ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE THE
PLANNING BOARD WITH OUR PROPOSED VASSAR STREET GRADUATE
DORMITORY, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT GREEN ROOF. AND YOU MAY
KNOW, OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED KENDALL SQUARE GRADUATE
DORMITORY INCLUDES TWO GREEN ROOFS. I DO WANT TO SAY, MIT
REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND
PARTICULARLY THE MANY RECENT AMENDMENTS. AS AN ENTITY THAT WILL
BE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THE ORDINANCE, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING OVER


PAGE 16

MAY 3, 2021

THE WEEK, TO DEVELOP A CLEAR OPERATING UNDERSTANDING OF THE
DETAILS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE LANGUAGE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION.
WE HAVE TESTIFIED ON THIS MATTER FOUR TIMES, ONCE BEFORE THE
PLANNING BOARD, ONCE BEFORE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND TWICE
BEFORE THE COUNCIL. WE SHARED THOUGHTS ON ISSUES OF PROCESS AND
ON THE TECHNICAL NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. AND WE APPRECIATE
THE EFFORTS TO BRING ADDITIONAL CLARITY TO THE LANGUAGE, WE REMAIN
CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE ORDINANCE.
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE SHARON DEVOS.
FOLLOWED BY JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> SHARON, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. JAMES, GO AHEAD.
JAMES, YOU ARE UNMUTED AND HAVE THE FLOOR. GO AHEAD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO TO JUSTIN AND THEN COME BACK. WE'LL COME
BACK TO JAMES AND SHARON.
>> PARTICIPANT: JUSTIN. HURLEY STREET IN EAST CAMBRIDGE. IT IS CLEAR
THAT THE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE IS BROADLY SUPPORTED IN CAMBRIDGE.
INCLUDING ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL. THE DIFFERENCES
ARE ON THE CONTOURS OF THE ORDINANCE AND BEST PRACTICES AROUND
GREEN ROOFS. INSTEAD OF CAMBRIDGE TAKING AN UNCHARTED PATH, I'D
LIKE TO NOTE, THE GREEN ROOF ORDINANCE HAS HAD MULTIPLE WEEKS OF
CONSIDERATION AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN SIGNIFICANT REFINEMENTS
CONCERNING THE DEFINITION OF BIOSOLAR AND THE PRACTICAL VIABILITY.
WE HAVE HEARD SERIOUS CAUTIONS FROM THOSE INVOLVED IN THE FIELD.
THE FUTURE VOTINGS DON'T GO THE BIOSOLAR ROUTE, WE LOSE ON THE
BENEFITS OF SOLAR, WHICH HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT, BANG FOR THE
BUCK, IN TERMS OF OVERALL APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND
CONSISTENT WITH OUR APPROACH. IF WE DO ADOPT SOLAR AND THAT IS
NOT THE BEST OPTION, OTHER OPTIONS REMAIN AVAILABLE. MOST
IMPORTANTLY, INCLUDING A GREEN ROOF.
ONCE BIOSOLAR DOES REACH A STANDARDIZED POSITION, WE CAN AMEND
THE ORDINANCE. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN POLICY ORDER ONE, HOUSING
STABILITY AND POLICY ORDER THREE. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THEM
FORWARD AND FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT IT. I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER SIX
FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS,
WHICH I THINK IT IS CLEAR WE ARE IN NEED OF FURTHER DISCUSSION AND
REFINEMENT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, JAMES WILLIAMSON? JAMES, ARE YOU
THERE?
>> JAMES, YOU ARE UNMUTED. GO AHEAD. (SILENCE).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES, CAN YOU HEAR US? IT SEEMS YOU ARE


PAGE 17

UNMUTED FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING.
>> HE SEEMS TO HAVE LOGGED OFF AT THIS POINT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. IS SHARON BACK?
>> JAMES IS BACK ONE MORE TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES, GO AHEAD. IF YOU CAN HEAR US? (SILENCE)
ARE YOU THERE? THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES HAPPENING.
IS SHARON BACK? SHARON IS NOT HERE?
>> SHARON IS NOT ABLE TO UNMUTE HERSELF.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. I DON'T SEE JAMES. I DON'T SEE HIM RIGHT
NOW. UNLESS YOU SEE HIM?
>> NOPE. HE IS BACK ONE MORE TIME. WE'LL TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES? (SILENCE) CAN YOU HEAR US? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS UP. I'M HAPPY TO WAIT LONGER. WE CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE,
JAMES. YOU ARE THERE AND YOU ARE NOT THERE. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.
I APOLOGIZE IT IS HAPPENING. SO, I THINK THAT IS ALL WHO HAS SIGNED UP
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. NAOMI, YOU WANT TO CHECK IF THERE IS ANYONE
ELSE I MAY HAVE MISSED? ARE WE GOOD?
>> YOU ARE ALL SET. EVERYBODY THAT SIGNED UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. EVERYBODY WE HAVE AND I WILL ENTERTAIN
THE MOTION TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR
CARLONE TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT, ROLL CALL?

FOR CONFIRMED CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENT. WE REPORT
7.2 CASES AS COMPARED TO 8.3 ON APRIL 25TH AND 20.8 ON APRIL 12.
ADDITIONALLY, OUR PERCENT POSITIVITY DECREASED BY ALMOST OVER
25%, FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK. IT IS NOW.44 LESS THAN ONE HALF OF 1%
AS REPORTED ON THE COMMONWEALTH WEEKLY REPORT. AS OF TODAY,
THE AVERAGE OF PERCENT OF POSITIVITY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH

IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT OUR LOW CASE NUMBERS,
FOLLOWING POSITIVITY RACE AND INCREASE VACCINATION TREND IN A VERY
POSITIVE DIRECTION. ON MAY FIVE AND SIX, THE CITY WILL OFFER VACCINE
CLINICS AT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE FOR PEOPLE 18 OR OLDER. AND
APPOINTMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED. CLAUDE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS
AND ADDITIONAL CLINIC DATES DURING THE PRESENTATION. AS REMINDER,
THE VACCINE IS FREE. OUR CLINICS AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO
SHOW ID OR DOCUMENTATION. WE ARE OFFERING THE SINGLE DOSE,
JOHNSON & JOHNSON, GETTING VACCINATED AT ONE CLINIC COULDN'T BE
EASIER. ONE BEST WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND THOSE AROUND YOU
FROM GETTING COVID 19 IS TO GET VACCINATED.
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S LATEST WEEKLY
MUNICIPALITY VACCINATION RATE, 59% OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS HAVE
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE. AND UP 18% FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK.
AND 32% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED UP 18.5% FROM THE
PREVIOUS WEEK.
AND I'M PLEASED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GETTING VACCINATED GROWS
AND I'M PROUD OF THE OUTREACH EFFORTS. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
ABOUT VACCINES, SPEAK TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER OR SEEK
INFORMATION FROM CREDIBLE SOURCES LIKE THE CDC OR THE CITY'S


PAGE 19

MAY 3, 2021

WEBSITE. MAKING PROGRESS, BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO AS THE
REMAINDER OF THE CITY CONTINUES TO OFFER SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FREE
COVID TESTING. I WILL NOW ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS
SUBMITTED BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER
AND THEN CLAUDE WILL HELP ADDRESS MAYOR SIDDIQUI'S QUESTIONS.
COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S FIRST QUESTION IS NOW THAT OTHER CITIES ARE
ALLOWING IN PERSON HOURS AND NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT SURFACE
TRANSMISSION DOESN'T OCCUR, HOW SOON ARE THEY OPENING TO IN
PERSON TO ACCELERATE BOOK RETURN. LIBRARY CIRCULATE OVER THEY
RESPONDED TO 21,000 TOTAL PATRON INQUIRIES VIA PHONE AND EMAILS.
SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC, WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED OVER 12,000
BOOKS. TO OUTREACH INITIATIVES AT FOOD PANTRIES, SITES, AFFORDABLE
HOUSING SITES, AND LIBRARY BRANCHES. THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC LIBRARY
WILL REOPEN EXPRESS SERVICES, INCLUDING LIMITED BROWSING, ON JUNE 2,
2021. DURING THIS NEXT PHASE OF REOPENING, LIBRARY SERVICE IN
CAMBRIDGE, PATRONS CAN VISIT THE MAIN LIBRARY TO CHECK OUT HOLDS,
BROWSE FOR ITEMS, AND GET ASSISTANCE FROM STAFF. TO ENSURE THE
SAFETY OF EVERYBODY, LIBRARY EXPRESS IS LAUNCHED BY APPOINTMENT
ONLY. BUILDING CAPACITY, VISIT LENGTH, WILL BE LIMITED AND ACCESS AND
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS THE WEEK MOVES DEPENDING WHAT THE PUBLIC
HEALTH RECOMMENDS. WE'LL OPEN BOOKING TO THE PUBLIC ON
WEDNESDAY, MAY 26, AND ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THIS PHASE IS
GOING TO BE RELEASED VERY SOON.
BOOK RETURNS, WHEN LIBRARIES REOPEN WITH, THE STATE MANDATED A 24
HOUR QUARANTINE PERIODS ON RETURNED MATERIALS UNDER THE SPECIFIC
SAFETY STANDARDS. THAT REQUIREMENT ENDED FRIDAY, APRIL 30. AFTER
CONSULTING WITH THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH, THEY STOPPED
QUARANTINING RETURNING ITEMS AS OF MAY 1. THIS SHOULD IMPROVE
AND SPEED UP THE RETURN PROCESSING. COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S SECOND
QUESTION IS, THERE ARE A FEW CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY FAMILY AND STAFF
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE LONG FELLOW BUILDING FOR STUDENTS MOVING
OUT OF THE TOBIN SCHOOL BEGINNING NEXT YEAR FOR CONSTRUCTION.
WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE BUILDING AND PHYSICAL
DISTANCING AND VENTILATION SYSTEM THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO OPERATE
SAFELY. WHAT ARE THE STEPS BEING TAKEN TO END SURE SAFETY OF
STUDENTS AND STAFF?
AS THIS IS A SCHOOL MATTER RELATED ITEM, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MAYOR
SIDDIQUI. I HAVE TALKED TO MR. MALONEY, BUT I WILL HAVE THE MAYOR UP
THERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL ADD THAT I GOT A RESPONSE IN THE WEEKLY
THAT COMES TO THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE. I SENT IT AS A LATE
COMMUNICATION TO OTHER CITY OFFICERS. I CHECKED IN WITH JIM
MALONEY ON READING THE RESPONSE THAT HE HAD SENT TO US. THAT'S
WHAT I WILL DO. EVERYBODY CAN HEAR IT. AND ALSO, THE BUILDING AND
GROUNDS SUBCOMMITTEE WILL MEET NEXT WEEK ON THIS MATTER. FOR
MORE UPDATES FOR THE COMMUNITY. I WILL READ THIS MESSAGE THAT IS


PAGE 20

MAY 3, 2021

FROM JIM MALONEY.
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RECEIVING LETTERS FROM INDIVIDUALS IN THE
TOBIN COMMUNITY SEEKING ANOTHER YEAR'S DELAY IN LOCATION OF THE
SCHOOL ON BROADWAY. SINCE THE REQUEST FOCUS ON LONG FELLOW
BUILDING AND OUTDOOR SPACE, I WILL OFFER FEW FACTS AND
OBSERVATIONS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED, THE INDOOR AIR QUALITY OF THE
LONG FELLOW BUILDING WILL MEET ALL THE EXCHANGE LEVELS OUTLINED IN
THE RETURN TO SCHOOL DOCUMENTS. FRESH AIR EXCHANGERS AT THE
LONG FELLOW ARE THE SAME AS THE AMIGOS, ET CETERA. I WILL POINT OUT,
ADDITIONALLY THAT THE CURRENT TOBIN BUILDING IS THE FOCUS OF
ACCUSATIONS OF POOR AIR QUALITY. ONE THING WE LEARNED LAST
SUMMER OF INDOOR FRESH AIR IN THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS IS THAT OLDER
BUILDINGS THINK SUCH AS LONG FELLOW, ARE BUILT WITH LARGE WINDOWS
THAT ALLOW FOR FRESH AIR BEYOND THE BUILDING'S AIR INTAKE SYSTEM.
IN ADDITION, WE'LL HAVE HEPA FILTERS AVAILABLE. IT HOUSES STUDENTS
FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM AND WE DON'T ALLOW THEM IN THE
BUILDING IF WE DIDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN AIR QUALITY. WHEN IT COMES
TO OPEN SPACE, NO DOUBT THE LONG FELLOW LOCATION HAS LESS OPEN
SPACE THAN THE TOBIN BUILDING. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO
RECOGNIZE THE LONG FELLOW WILL HAVE MORE AVAILABLE OPEN SPACE
THAN THE AMIGO SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE PORT SCHOOL, IN THE AMOUNT OF
OUTDOOR SPACE WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE DIFFERENT FROM
SOME OTHER SCHOOLS. WORKING WITH THE PRINCIPAL, I'M CONFIDENT WE
CAN MAKE FULL USE OF THE PLAY AREAS. THERE ARE SMALL CITY PARK 300
YARDS THAT CAN BE UTILIZED FOR THE SCHOOL, IF THE SCHOOL DECIDES TO
ACCESS IT.
SPEAKING MORE GENERALLY, I'D SAY CPS IS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF
MEETING CHALLENGES AND CONCERNS OF THE RELOCATION. THE VASSAR
LANE BUILDING WILL HOUSE THE TOBIN, BUT A CROWDED CRAMPED UPPER
SCHOOL, THEY WERE PROMISED A NEW BUILDING A DECADE AGO. IT IS IN
POOR SHAPE AND LEAKS INTO BARRELS FULL FROM THE RAINWATER AND
BEYOND THE WATCHING REPAIR WE WERE DOING WHILE WE WAIT. THE
HEATING SYSTEM IS IN VERY POOR SHAPE.
THIS PROJECT IS NOT JUST ABOUT TODAY'S TOBIN TEACHERS AND STUDENT
AND A YEAR DELAY WILL PUSH THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR OUT. THIS IS ABOUT
MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS NOW AND IN THE
FUTURE YEARS. WE ARE CONFIDENT THE NEEDS CAN BE MET AT THE LONG
FELLOW BUILDING.
THIS WAS SENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL. IT WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL
COMMITTEE ON FRIDAY. MR. MALONEY IS NOT WITH US. THERE WILL BE
SOME MORE MEETINGS ON THIS TOPIC FOR STAFF AND FAMILIES. AND CITY
MANAGER, IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD, GO AHEAD.
>> CITY MANAGER: NO. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR MR. MALONEY. I
THINK THE LETTER SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF. HE IS FIRM IN THE FACT HE FELT WE
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WE HAD. I'M SURE


PAGE 21

MAY 3, 2021

THERE WILL BE MORE DISCUSSION. AT THIS POINT, THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I
GOT. OKAY?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YUP.
>> CITY MANAGER: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER'S QUESTION,
REOPENING PLANS FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS INTO THE SUMMER. WHICH
AREAS CAN WE EXPECT CAMBRIDGE TO LIFT RESTRICTIONS AND WILL BE THE
CITY BE MORE STRINGENT AND WHEN CAN WE SEE MODIFICATIONS TO
OUTDOOR MASK MANDATES. ON APRIL 29, THE CITY ANNOUNCED TELL
ADVANCE TO PHASE FOUR, STEP ONE, OF THE REOPENING PLAN AND
GATHERING LIMITS FOR EVENT VENUES AND PUBLIC SETTINGS WILL INCREASE
FROM 100 PEOPLE INDOORS TO 150 OUTDOORS ON MAY SIX. ALL ACTIVITIES
THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS PHASE FOUR, STEP ONE, SHALL FOLLOW ANY AND
ALL ORDERS GUIDANCE PERTAIN TO THE MITIGATION OF THE COVID 19
ISSUES BY THE COMMONWEALTH IN THE CITY, INCLUDING THE LICENSE
COMMISSION, PUBLIC HEALTH, PUBLIC WORKS, AND INSPECTIONAL SERVICES.
THE APRIL 30, WE ALIGNED WITH THE COMMONWEALTH WITH REGARD TO
OUTDOOR MASK WEARING. PROVISIONS OF THE CITY'S EMERGENCY ORDER
IN WEARING MASKS IS IN EFFECT. THE CITY'S AMENDED ORDER, MASK OR
FACE COVERING IS NOT REQUIRED OUTSIDE IN PUBLIC SPACES WHEN
INDIVIDUALS CAN REMAIN AT A SAFE DISTANCE, SIX FEET FROM OTHERS.
MASK OR FACE COVERINGS ARE REQUIRED ALL TIMES AT INDOOR AND
OUTDOOR VENUES AND EVENTS, EXCEPT WHEN EATING OR DRINKING AND IN
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OF TWO OR MORE UNITS. THEY CONTINUE TO
REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEES OF PLACES OF BUSINESS MAY REMOVE MASKS OR
FACE COVERINGS ONLY WHEN WORKING ALONE IN INDIVIDUAL OFFICES WITH
THE DOOR CLOSED OR WORKING ALONE IN THE OFFICE SUITE WITH NO
OTHER INDIVIDUALS PRESENT. MASK MUST BE WORN AT ALL OTHER TIMES.
MAY SIX, 2021, THE CITY WILL RESEND THE EMERGENCY ORDER WITH
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FITNESS SENTENCE AND HEALTH CLUB
OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE IN PLACE SINCE DECEMBER 26, 2020. THEY MUST
CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE THE SPECIFIC SAFETY PROTOCOLS.
CONTINUE SAVE REOPENINGS IN CAMBRIDGE, I EXPECT REOPENING
STRATEGY WILL ALIGN WITH THE COMMONWEALTH REOPENING PLAN. MAY
DO SO ON A DELAYED SCHEDULE AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THIS
CONCLUDES MY RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS. ONCE AGAIN, I ASK OUR
RESIDENTS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND NOT LET THE GUARD DOWN. WEAR
HIGH QUALITY MASKS WHEN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR WHEN AVAILABLE TO
SOCIALLY DISTANCE, WASH HANDS FREQUENTLY, PRACTICE PHYSICAL
DISTANCE AND LIMIT THE GATHERINGS WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE
HOUSE. WE HAVE MONITORED DATA COMING FROM THE COMMONWEALTH
AND WORK WITH THE EXPERT ADVISORY PANEL, CITY DEPARTMENTS,
BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ENSURE WE ARE
SUPPORTING AND PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. I WANT TO
THANK THE PARTNERS FOR THE COLLABORATION AND THANK THE
CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY FOR COMPLIANCE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH
GUIDANCE.


PAGE 22

MAY 3, 2021

AS WITH EACH PREVIOUS DECISION, I WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE TEAM,
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN THE STATE AND PARTNERS AS WE BEGIN TO
EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC AND BEGIN TO THINK WHAT WILL COME
NEXT. I TURN IT OVER TO CLAUDE NOW. THANK YOU.
>> CLAUDE JACOB: GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU. I THANK THE CITY
MANAGER, DR. ASSAAD SAYAH, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TONIGHT'S UPDATE. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I'M JOINED BY DR. DOBBERTEEN, MEDICAL DIRECTOR. WE'LL FIELD ANY
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE REPORT. I HAVE EXCITING NEWS
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. EARLIER TODAY, THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED
THE NEXT PHASE OF THE STATE'S VACCINATION CAMPAIGN STATEWIDE. THE
COMMONWEALTH IS IN THE PROCESS OF PIVOTING TO A TARGETED
COMMUNITY BASED VACCINATION APPROACH. INCLUDING GREATER
EMPHASIS ON COLLABORATIVES. WE'LL HAVE THE VACCINE SUPPLY TO FULLY
OPERATE THE METRO NORTH REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE, INCLUDING THREE
CLINICS AT THE ENCORE CASINO, TUFTS CAMPUS IN MEDFORD, AND
CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE LOCATION IN SOMERVILLE NEXT TO TARGET.
SPECIAL THANKS TO THE CITY MANAGER, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, DR. ASSAAD
SAYAH, AND THE GAGGLE OF THE PARTNERS, COMMUNITIES TO HELP MAKE
THIS HAPPEN AS WE PREPARE FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THE ROLLOUT.
WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE.
SO, AS YOU SEE, A SNAPSHOT, WHICH WE REPORT EACH WEEK. OVER 6,100
CASES. WE ARE AT 122 REPORTED FATALITIES AMONG RESIDENTS. AS YOU
HEARD FROM THE CITY MANAGER, 0.44 POSITIVITY RATE, ABOUT A THIRD OF
THE STATE'S AVERAGE. NEW INFECTIONS AMONG RESIDENTS HAVE DROPPED
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN APRIL WITH MORE THAN 50%
DECREASE IN NEW CONFIRMED CASES. HERE IN THE CITY, FOR THE PAST
WEEK, ENDING MAY 1, WE HAD 66 NEW CONFIRMED CASES WHICH
TRANSLATE TO AVERAGE OF 9.4 PER DAY OR 7.9 PER HUNDRED THOUSAND.
NEW NUMBERS ARE SIMILAR REPORTED TO THOSE LAST WEEK. WE ARE
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO TREND.
MEANWHILE, WE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO GET
VACCINATED AND TO NOT LET UP ON THE MASK WEARING, PHYSICAL
DISTANCING, AND PRACTICING GOOD HAND HYGIENE.
NEXT SLIDE. SO, TESTING, TESTING, MORE TESTING. IT IS DECLINING SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. MORE TEENS AND ADULTS ARE VACCINATED,
THIS DECLINE HAS BEEN EXPECTED. HOWEVER, AS I SAID LAST WEEK, CITY IS
MAINTAINING THE SEVEN DAY A WEEK TESTING PROGRAM SINCE IT IS AN
INVALUABLE TOOL IN SLOWING DOWN TRANSMISSION IN THE CITY. SO,
REMINDER TESTING IS TAKING PLACE AT FOUR LOCATIONS ACROSS THE CITY.
CAMBRIDGESIDE MALL. HARVARD SQUARE LOCATION. ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.
AND THE 85 BISHOP ALLEN DRIVE. AND THIS IS FREE OF CHARGE TO
RESIDENTS AND STAFF. UPON UPCOMING GRADUATIONS AND WARMER
WEATHER, INVITES MORE GATHERINGS AND GET TOGETHERS, THEY ARE ALL
REMINDERS IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A TESTING SCHEDULE, WHICH
WILL BE IN PLACE THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH AND THEN WE'LL


PAGE 23

MAY 3, 2021

REVISIT THE SCHEDULE. NEXT SLIDE.
AS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE CITY MANAGER, ON APRIL 27, THE
GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT MASSACHUSETTS WILL REOPEN SOME
OUTDOOR PHASE FOUR, STEP TWO, INDUSTRIES. EFFECTIVE MAY 10 AND PUT
IN PLACE PLANS TO REOPEN MAY 29 AND AUGUST ONE. SUBJECT TO THE
PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND VACCINATION DATA, JUST KNOW THE SLIDE
REFLECTS HIGHLIGHTS OF CHANGES GOING INTO AFFECT STATEWIDE OVER
THE COMING WEEKS. FOR CAMBRIDGE, THE CITY IS ADVANCING TO PHASE
FOUR, STEP ONE, OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S REOPENING PLAN. REMAINING
MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THE REOPENING AS WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE
PANDEMIC. YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE CITY MANAGER, KEY CHANGES,
MASKS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED IN OUTDOOR PUBLIC SPACES WHERE
INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE, EXCEPT OUTDOOR EVENTS
AND VENUES, INDOOR MASK RULES REMAIN THE SAME. GATHERING LIMITS
IN THE CITY FOR EVENT VENUES AND IN PUBLIC SETTINGS WILL INCREASE TO
100 INDIVIDUALS INDOORS AND 150 OUTDOORS AS OF MAY 6.
AND THE CITY IS RESCINDING THE EXECUTIVE EMERGENCY ORDER WITH
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FITNESS AND HEALTHCARE OPERATIONS,
EFFECTIVE MAY 6. IF PUBLIC HEALTH METRICS JUSTIFY CONTINUED SAFE
REOPENING, CITY EXPECTS TO MORE CLOSELY ALINE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S
ANNOUNCEMENT AND MAY DO SO ON A DELAYED SCHEDULE.
SO, IN TERMS OF STATEWIDE. TO DATE, MORE THAN HALF OF OUR RESIDENT
HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE. THE
COMMONWEALTH RANKS NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR PERSONS
HAVING RECEIVED ONE OR MORE DOSES ADMINISTERED PER CAPITA AMONG
STATES WITH AT LEAST FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS. AND THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS RANKS SECOND IN THE NATION FOR
PERSONS RECEIVED ONE DOSE ADMINISTERED PER CAP TAY. MAKING STEADY
PROGRESS DESPITE CHALLENGES. THAT IS A GOOD NEWS IN TERMS OF THE
PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THE STATE.
NEXT SLIDE. VACCINE UPDATE. 95% OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE FIRST
DOSE OF MODERNA HAVE RECEIVED THEIR SECOND DOSE. THIS IS UP FROM
90% THAT I ANNOUNCE LAST WEEK. WE HAVE ADMINISTERED NEARLY 5,900
DOSES OF VACCINES SINCE WE FIRST BEGAN THE VACCINATING ON JANUARY
11. WE ACTIVATED OPERATION NIGHTINGALE TO GET TO OUR FIRST
RESPONDENTS. CITY RUN VACCINE CLINIC WAS HELD ON SATURDAY AT
RESERVOIR CHURCH. WE ADMINISTERED 60 OF THE ONE DOSE JOHNSON &
JOHNSON VACCINE AND WE'LL HOLDING ADDITIONAL CLINICS AT THE
CAMBRIDGESIDE MALL AND RESERVOIR CHURCH LATER THIS WEEK.
WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, AND THURSDAY MAY 6, WE'LL BE AT 100 CAMBRIDGE
PLACE ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE MALL. JUST ABOVE THE FOOD
DAUGHTER AND FROM 10 4 P.M. AND ON FRIDAY, MAY SEVEN, WE'LL BE AT
THE RESERVOIR CHURCH, 170 RINDGE AVENUE AND FROM 9 2 P.M. AND
FROM 4 8 P.M. THE DETAILS ARE MADE AVAILABLE. WE WERE DELIGHTED
THAT SECRETARY SUDDERS DROPPED BY THIS PAST WEEKEND TO GREET
RESIDENT AND SEE THE CLINIC IN ACTION. WE ARE GRATEFUL THE STATE


PAGE 24

MAY 3, 2021

SUPPORT AS WE GEAR UP FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THE ROLLOUT EFFORTS.
TO PROMOTE THE CLINICS, THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE AND OUR
DEPARTMENT WILL CONDUCT THE CITY WIDE OUTREACH, INCLUDING CODE
RED CALL, OUTREACH TO PARENTS, AND NOTIFYING CITY EMPLOYEES OF THE
CLINICS. I HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED. RESIDENT SHOULD RECEIVE THE
NOTIFICATION OR THE ROBOCALL THIS AFTERNOON. OUR DEPARTMENT WILL
BEGIN MORE TARGETED OUTREACH BASED ON THE DATA TO COMMUNITIES
AND BASED ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE VACCINE UPDATE IS
CONSIDERED TO BE LOW.
MAYOR SIDDIQUI HAD A QUESTION FOR US. AND QUESTION FOR THE
MAYOR, WHAT IS THE PLAN TO RESUME ON SITE VACCINATION FOR
HOMEBOUND INDIVIDUALS NOW THAT JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE IS
REAUTHORIZED FOR USE? TO THAT QUESTION, OUR HOMEBOUND
VACCINATION PROGRAM, KNOWN AS OPERATION SHEPARD, CONCLUDED
THIS PAST FRIDAY. WE VACCINATED 12 ADDITIONAL RESIDENTS. IN TOTAL,
104 HOMEBOUND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED THE COVID SHOT THROUGH THE
PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. GOING FORWARD, ANYONE SEEKING
A HOMEBOUND VACCINATION WILL BE REFERRED TO THE STATE'S
HOMEBOUND VACCINATION PROGRAM. THE SENIOR CENTERS AND COUNCIL
ON AGING CALL CENTER HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE CHANGE AND WILL
REFER CALLERS TO THE STATE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INTERESTED, THE
PHONE NUMBER IS 833.983.0485. AND INFORMATION IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON
THE MASS.GOV WEBSITE. RACE AND ETHNICITY, THE DATA IS AVAILABLE BY
THE STATE. THIS IS RESIDENT BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WHO RECEIVED AT
LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE IN CAMBRIDGE IN COMPARISON TO THE STATE.
APRIL 27, 59% OF RESIDENTS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE.
OUTPACING THE STATE. A THIRD OF CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY
VACCINATED. ONE QUICK NOTE OR CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE SLIDE, IT
DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL RACIAL ETHNIC CATEGORIES PROVIDED IN THE STATE'S
DATA. NOTABLY, OVER 5,500 RESIDENT WHO IDENTIFIED AS OTHER AND
UNKNOWN HAD RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. BECAUSE THE
STATE DOESN'T HAVE ANY UNDERLYING POPULATION COUNT FOR OTHER OR
UNKNOWN, WE CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT PROPORTION OF THE GROUP HAS
BEEN VACCINATED. THESE ARE SELF REPORTED DATA.
WE HAVE VACCINATION DATA ON AMERICAN INDIAN, ALASKAN NATIVE, AND
OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDERS. IT IS SO SMALL, FEWER THAN 200, WE DON'T
SHOW THE DATA. ACCORDING TO THE STATE, THERE ARE BASICALLY 112,000
RESIDENTS IN CAME, OF WHOM OVER 65,000 HAVE GOTTEN AT LEAST ONE
DOSE. AND BY CALCULATIONS, THAT'S ABOUT 59% OF THE POPULATION.
WE'LL BE SURE TO ADD A FOOTNOTE TO THIS SLIDE FOR FUTURE
PRESENTATIONS TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO RESIDENTS. I WANT TO THANK
COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR DRAWING THAT OUT. AND AS I HAVE REPORTED
EACH WEEK, CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO OUTPACE THE STATE IN
VACCINATION RATES AND MOST RACE AND ETHNICITY CATEGORIES. WE SAW
THE LARGEST INCREASE IN VACCINE NUMBERS AMONG ASIAN RESIDENTS
AND THIS IS THE FIRST WEEK CAMBRIDGE SURPASSED THE STATE'S AVERAGES


PAGE 25

MAY 3, 2021

IN THE PROPORTION OF ASIAN RESIDENT VACCINATED.
ALL OTHER GROUPS SHOWED STEADY, BUT MORE MODEST INCREASES FROM
THE PRIOR WEEK. AS I SHARE EACH WEEK, I WANT TO THANK OUR FANTASTIC
STAFF, CAMBRIDGE PANDEMIC COLLABORATIVE TEAM, CITY MANAGER'S
OFFICE, MAYOR'S OFFICE, AND OTHERS FOR THE ONGOING GRASSROOTS
OPERATION TO GET THE WORD OUT TO ALL ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
VACCINE AND WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS ON THE GROUND TO ENSURE
ALL RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE AS MADE AVAILABLE. NEXT
SLIDE.
AGAIN, SAME PATTERN COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE,
CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO OUTPACE THE STATE IN EVERY CATEGORY IN
PROPORTION OF TEENS AND ADULTS BY AGE AND GENDER. THEY HAVE
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. WE SAW THE BIGGEST JUMP IN
VACCINATION NUMBERS AMONG RESIDENTS IN THEIR 20S, WHICH IS
HEARTENING SINCE WE COUNT ON THIS DEMOGRAPHIC TO ACHIEVE HERD
IMMUNITY. WE SEE VERY LITTLE GAP IN MEN AND WOMEN BEING
VACCINATED. THAT IS ANOTHER POSITIVE SIGN. TRENDS ARE MOVING IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION. I CAN'T THANK THE TEAM ENOUGH, THE CLINICAL STAFF
TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE THE SUPPORT TO RESIDENTS. AND THANKS TO
THE PARTNERS IN THE CITY TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE
OF GETTING VACCINATING. AND THEN WRAP UP. COMMUNICATIONS. WE
HAD A ROBUST COMMUNICATION STRATEGY SINCE BEFORE THE VACCINE
ARRIVED. THIS INCLUDES CITY WIDE, MAILERS, CITY EMAIL UPDATES, SOCIAL
MEDIA POSTS, AND TARGETED OUTREACH, SENIORS IN THE LOW INCOME
HOUSING AND IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE VIA THE EFFORTS OF THE CAMBRIDGE
CORPS MEMBERS GOING DOOR TO DOOR. AND ADDITIONAL CITY WIDE
COMMUNICATION WILL GO OUT THIS WEEK. I SHARED WITH THE ROBOCALL
THAT OCCURRED EARLIER, AS WELL AS OUTREACH TO CPS. PARENTS FROM
THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. MORE TARGETED COMMUNICATION WILL
ACCOMPANY THE CITY WIDE MESSAGING TO GROUPS BASED ON THE STATE'S
AND CITY VACCINE DATA. AND WE CONTINUE OUR COMMUNITY FORUMS
WITH THE CLINICIAN SPEAKERS BUREAU, I CAN'T THANK ENOUGH DR.
DOBBERTEEN, JODY, AND OTHER STAFF, FOR HELPING US TO ENGINEER THIS
WITH SUPPORT OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE. AND CHPD IS PLANNING A
COMMUNITY FORUM IN HAITIAN CREOLE FROM WEDNESDAY MAY 19 AND IN
SPANISH ON THURSDAY, MAY 27. AND I WILL ADD, SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE
GIANETTI AND THE INCREDIBLE NETWORK OF COMMUNICATION STAFF
ACROSS THE CITY TO HELP US GET THE WORD OUT.
LAST SLIDE. WE TRIED TO SHARE WITH YOU AN AVAILABLE COMMENTARY
FROM THE FIELD. THIS PUTS IN THE CONTEXT THE NUMBERS. IN THIS
INSTANCE, IT WAS A FEEDBACK SHARED WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES THIS
WEEKEND. AT THE RESERVOIR CHURCH. I HAD A HUSBAND AND WIFE COME
IN WITH PLANS FOR ONLY THE HUSBAND TO BE VACCINATED DUE TO
CONCERNS ABOUT THE REPORTS OF BLOOD CLOTS IN WOMEN WHO
RECEIVED THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE. I DISCUSSED WITH THE
HUSBAND COMMON EXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, SORE ARM, BODY ACHES, MILD


PAGE 26

MAY 3, 2021

FEVER, VERSUS SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS, SEVERE HEADACHE, LEG PAIN, OR
BRUISING. BOTH LISTENED AND ASKED SEVERAL FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS.
THE HUSBAND WAS VACCINATED AND THE WIFE WENT WITH THEM TO THE
OBSERVATION AREA. MOMENTS LATER, SHE RETURNED AND CHANGED HER
MIND AND WANTED TO BE VACCINATED. THIS IS JUST A SMALL ILLUSTRATION
OF THE POWER AND THE REACH AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STAFF AND
HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS. WE ARE STILL GOING THROUGH
THE DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST YEAR. THANK YOU FOR INCREDIBLE
NURSING STAFF, THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE
LEANED IN TRYING TO HELP RESIDENTS. WITH THAT, HAPPY NATIONAL
NURSES WEEK. IF YOU KNOW, TRACY, OR ASSOCIATE CHIEF OF CLINICAL
SERVICES, SHE HAS THE LION SHARE OF THE CLINICAL STAFF UNDER HER, I
WANT TO THANK TRACY AND THE STAFF. IF YOU SEE A NURSE, HUG THEM,
AND SAY THANKS FOR THEIR TIME AND SUPPORT. ESPECIALLY THROUGH
COVID. WITH THAT, I WILL STOP AND LISA AND I CAN FIELD QUESTIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE CITY COUNCIL,
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ON THE PRESENTATION? WAIT ONE SECOND.
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN? YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND STAFF FOR THE UPDATE. CERTAINLY EXCITED TO SEE OUR
CASE COUNTS GOING DOWN AND THE VACCINATION RATES GOING UP.
THAT'S EXCELLENT NEWS. I DID HAVE A QUESTION WITH THE CHANGE IN THE
MASK MANDATE. THIS WEEKEND, WE HAD REALLY NICE WEATHER. A LOT OF
PEOPLE WERE OUT. FOR THE MOST PART, PEOPLE ARE STILL WEARING THE
MASKS OUTDOORS BECAUSE CAMBRIDGE IS DENSE. WE RUN INTO EACH
OTHER ALL THE TIME.
WE DID GET SOME REPORTS ABOUT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS DOING ROAD
WORK AND SOME POLICE DETAILS NOT WEARING THE MASKS. I JUST WANT
TO UNDERSTAND BETTER, WHAT IS THE POLICY WITH REGARD TO THAT? I
UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY TO BE WEARING THE MASK ALL THE
TIME. WHEN THEY ARE OUTDOORS DOING A DETAIL, JUST LIKE THE REST OF
US, THERE'S FREQUENT ENCOUNTERS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. IT WOULD SEEM
BETTER TO JUST HAVE THE MASK ON ALL THE TIME. I WANTED TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POLICY IS ON THAT.
>> CITY MANAGER: CLAUDE, YOU WANT TO START?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: SURE. AT THIS STAGE, WE FIELD COMPLAINTS. WE
HEARD ABOUT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, IN PARTICULAR. WE HAVE A
SYSTEM IN PLACE WITH THE INSPECTIONAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUEST FOR CONCERNS. CLEARLY, GIVEN THE NEWS AND
WHAT WE SHARED THIS PAST FRIDAY, TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION OUT
TO FOLKS. IN GENERAL, WHAT WE DO KNOW BASED ON THE SCIENCE, THE
RELATIVE RISK OF TRANSMISSION IS MUCH LOWER FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES
THAN INDOOR. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TRYING TO MESSAGE THIS
ACCORDINGLY. IN TERMS OF A POLICY, I'D SAY WHAT WE HAVE AMENDED IS
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE REQUIREMENT TO WEAR MASK OUTDOORS.
IF WHAT WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS IS IN GENERAL AVOID INDOOR GATHERINGS,

PAGE 27

MAY 3, 2021

MAINTAIN A SAFE DISTANCE OUTDOORS, AND USE AN EFFECTIVE MASK
WHERE POSSIBLE. I WILL PAUSE THERE AND DEFER TO THE CITY MANAGER
FOR OTHER POLICIES. WE FIELD THE QUERIES AND WORK WITH ISD.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL SAY WE HAD THE AMBASSADORS OUT AGAIN TO
MAKE SURE PEOPLE FOLLOWED GUIDELINES. MATT IS WORKING WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE. MATT NELSON AND KATHY. MAYBE THEY CAN
GIVE A QUICK UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT. MATT OR KATHY?
>> MATT: I WILL KICK IT OVER TO KATHY. WE ARE MEETING THIS WEEK AS
THE STATE ADJUSTED THE SECTOR SPECIFIC GUIDELINES. KATHY, YOU CAN
SPEAK ON SPECIFICS.
>> KATHY: WE HAVE A WEEKLY MEETING WITH CONTRACTORS DOING WORK
IN THE CITY. THE MESSAGING WE GAVE TO THEM WAS THE LANGUAGE FROM
THE UPDATED MASK ORDER IN TERMS OF OUTDOORS, NOT REQUIRED IF THEY
CAN KEEP SEPARATION. AND SO, AGAIN, THAT'S GOING TO BE A STRUGGLE
AS THE SUMMER CONTINUES AND IT IS HOTTER. THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE
GIVE FOLKS IN TERMS OF THE MASK NOT REQUIRED OUTDOORS UNLESS THEY
CAN'T KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER. I
WILL SAY ON THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER SIDE, IT WAS A STRUGGLE BEFORE
WE CHANGED THE MANDATE. I APPRECIATE THE ONGOING THERE. I REALLY
DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER. I DON'T KNOW ON THE POLICE QUESTION. IS THERE
A SEPARATE POLICY FOR POLICE DOING DETAILS OR WORKING OUTSIDE OR
WE JUST FOLLOWING THE SAME THING?
>> CITY MANAGER: IT SHOULD BE NO SEPARATE, BUT COMMISSIONER BARD
IS ON THE LINE. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO HIM. COMMISSIONER?
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: THERE'S NO SEPARATE POLICY. THE MANDATE IS
THE MANDATE. I WILL CLARIFY, AS WHETHER YOU GET COMPLAINTS ABOUT
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS NOT WEARING THE MASK WHILE POLICE OFFICERS
ARE PRESENT ON THE DETAIL OR POLICE OFFICERS NOT WEARING THE MASK.
I HEARD THE FORMER, NOT THE LATTER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I HEARD THE COMPLAINT,
SEEING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS NOT WEARING THE MASK. AND
SEPARATELY POLICE DETAILS NOW I THINK IN THE CASE THAT I WAS SEEING,
IT IS NOT A CAMBRIDGE POLICE OFFICER, BUT THEY WERE DOING A TRAFFIC
DETAIL IN CAMBRIDGE. I UNDERSTAND THAT COULD BE CHALLENGING
MAYBE YOU CAN'T DIRECT THEM TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE STATE
POLICY. IT IS A CONCERN. BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY IN CAMBRIDGE AND THE
FREQUENCY.
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: IF YOU DO A DETAIL IN CAMBRIDGE, WE RIDE
AROUND AND HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. IF YOU WITNESS A VIOLATION
TO MAKE IT LET ME KNOW ABOUT IT. SEND A QUICK EMAIL OR CONTINUE
TO NOTIFY THE COUNCIL. WE'LL DEAL WITH IT APPROPRIATELY. WE ENFORCE
THE REGULATIONS AND RULES. JUST TO BE CLEAR, I HAVEN'T RECEIVED THAT


PAGE 28

MAY 3, 2021

COMPLAINT ABOUT A CAMBRIDGE POLICE OFFICER IN A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.
IF.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EITHER
FOR A CAMBRIDGE POLICE OFFICER. THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE MORE QUICK
QUESTION. DO WE KNOW AMONG THE POLICE OFFICERS, HOW MANY ARE
VACCINATED SO FAR?
>> COMMISSIONER BARD: ABOUT 85%. DON'T HOLD ME EXACTLY TO THAT.
THROUGH YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, 85% GIVE OR TAKE A FRACTION.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THOUGHT SAW THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE AND FIRE IS
LEADING THE PERCENTAGE OF ANY POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE
STATE. CLAUDE?
>> CLAUDE JACOB: YES. OVER 90% IF YOU COMBINE. FIRE, THERE IS AN
ARTICLE IN THE GLOBE A COUPLE OF WEEKS, PRO EMS, THEY ARE AT 99%. IF
NOT ALREADY 100. WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL THANKS TO THE PUBLIC
SAFETY AND WE LAUNCHED THAT VACCINATION CITY RUN CLINIC IN
JANUARY 11. I CAN'T THANK OUR PARTNERS AT POLICE, FIRE, AND EMS FOR
THAT EFFORT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I CAN ATTEST TO ONE TIME WHEN I
BRAVELY APPROACHED A POLICE OFFICER FROM CAMBRIDGE, TOLD THEM
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS DIDN'T HAVE MASK ON, THAT POLICE OFFICER
WAS ON IT AND MADE SURE IT WAS HAPPENING. I REALLY THANK THE
VIGILANCE OF THE GROUPS AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE BEYOND THIS. MY
QUICK QUESTION IS, IT IS A COMMENT FOLLOWING UP ON THE REFERENCE
TO THE LIBRARY OPENING UP. TAKE IN MIND AND CONSIDER THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE WHO USE THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER
SPACE TO WORK. THERE'S JUST PEOPLE WHO USE IT NOT JUST TO BROWSE
BOOKS AND GET THEM, IT IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE LIFE. SOONER WE CAN
GET TO THE STAGE WHERE WE CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO IN AND RESERVE
THE SMALL STUDY ROOMS AND USE THE LIBRARY AS THEY USED TO, THE
BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THE RESIDENTS. I RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE TO BALANCE
MANY THINGS, I HOPE WE CAN GET TO THAT SOON. THERE ARE OTHER
PEOPLE THAN JUST GETTING BOOKS THAT USE THE FACILITIES.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL SAY, MARIA IS A SPOKESPERSON FOR ALL THE
MEMBERS WHO USE THE LIBRARY AND IS REALLY TRIED TO DO COME UP
WITH THE BEST PLAN POLICY. I APPRECIATE THAT. THESE OF DIFFICULT
CALLS, BUT WE'RE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. MARIA HAS THAT
CONCERN. WE'LL ADDRESS IT WHEN WE CAN. THANK YOU.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE
VACCINE CLINICS THAT HAPPENED THIS WEEKEND AND CONTINUING THIS
WEEK. IT IS A TRUE TESTAMENT TO WHERE WE ARE IN OUR VACCINATIONS
THAT WERE IN THIS PLACE WHERE WE OFFER NO APPOINTMENT NECESSARY
VACCINATIONS. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT, THANKS FOR SENDING THE


PAGE 29

MAY 3, 2021

PARTICULAR, I GOT A VOICEMAIL, EMAIL. A LOT OF COMMUNICATION. I
WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN I GOT THE TEXT, I THOUGHT IT WAS CONFUSINGLY
WORDED. IT SAYS NO APPOINTMENT CITY OF CAMBRIDGE VACCINE CLINICS
ON MAY 6, 7 THE WAY I READ IT, NO APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE AT THE
CLINICS. IF YOU SEND OUT ADDITIONAL TEXT, THINK ABOUT THE WAY IT IS
WORDED WOULD BE HELPFUL TO DECREASE THE CONFUSION AND MINIMIZE
THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.
AGAIN, THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO IS MAKING THIS HAPPEN. THE
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. POLICE, FIRE AND EMT, IT IS AMAZING WE
ARE WHERE WE ARE WITH VACCINATIONS. I WILL CALL OUT THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE REPORTED ONE CASE OF COVID 19 TODAY. ONE. AND SO, I
THINK THAT IS A REAL TESTAMENT TO THE TEAM AND I WANT TO SAY THANKS
ON THE FLOOR. THANKS. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO OTHER QUESTIONS. ROLL CALL ON PLACING CITY
MANAGER AGENDA ITEM ONE AND COMMUNICATION REPORTS FROM OTHER
CITY OFFICERS, NUMBER THREE, ON FILE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER
THREE. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 3). COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WAS GLAD TO SEE THIS ON THE
AGENDA. I HAVE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND HOW
THE COMMUNITY WILL BE ENGAGED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. REALLY EXCITED
TO SEE THIS FINALLY COMING FORWARD.
I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON MORGAN PARK, THE
CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE COMMUNITY THERE. THE BASEBALL TOURNAMENTS
THAT HAPPEN THERE AND OTHER COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES. IT WILL BE A
SIGNIFICANT LOSS WHILE THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS NOT CLEAR EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO TO MITIGATE THAT LOSS.

Motion to place City Manager
Agenda #1 and
Communications from other
City Officers #3 on file.

CITY MANAGER ITEM #1
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to a COVID19 update.

COMMUNICATION AND
REPORT FROM OTHER
CITY OFFICERS #3
A communication was received
from Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui,
transmitting questions for the
COVID-19 update.

>> KATHY: I CAN RESPOND TO THAT AND WE CAN ADD IN ADDITIONAL
THOUGHTS. PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING, LOOKING AT MORE TECHNICAL
ANALYSIS ABOUT WHERE THE ADDITIONAL TANK IS GOING TO BE LOCATED.
PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST WRAPPING UP THE CONSTRUCTION
AND PARKING LOT SIX. THAT IS THE FIRST TANK THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE PROGRAM AND REALLY WE'LL START TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF
FLOODING. REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THE FLOODING.
THAT FIRST TANK IS COMING ONLINE NOW. AND THEN LOOKING AT WHAT
THE NEXT PHASE IS. THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE HAD, THERE WOULD BE THE
STORMWATER TANK AND THE SEWER HOLDING TANK TO REDUCE THE
IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT WAS LOOKED AT FOR THE PAST 10 15
YEARS THE TANK IS LOCATED IN THE PARK UNDER THE BASKETBALL COURTS.
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AS WE DID OUTREACH, WE HEARD
CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TAKING BASKETBALL COURTS OUT OF
SERVICE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME TO FULLY BUILD THE TANKS.


PAGE 30

MAY 3, 2021

WE SPENT TIME LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES. ONE, ARE THERE LOCATIONS
WHERE WE CAN DO TEMPORARY BASKETBALL COURTS DURING
CONSTRUCTION. AND WE LOOKED AT OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE WE CAN DO
THE TANK AND NOT NEED TO USE THE PARK AT ALL. THAT'S ONE
DISCUSSIONS WE WANT TO HAVE WITH THE COMMITTEE. OUR DIRECTION IS
TO IDENTIFY GOING BACK INTO PARKING LOT SIX, MAYBE TEN YEARS FROM
NOW, AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PROVIDE THE FLOOD PROTECTION TO THE
COMMUNITY WITHOUT IMPACTING THE BASKETBALL COURTS FOR
CONSTRUCTION.
>> CITY MANAGER: KATHY SAID IT PERFECTLY. WE UNDERSTAND THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE BASKETBALL COURTS AND WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO GET THE RIGHT BALANCE. I ASSURE YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. PLEASANTLY SURPRISING
ANSWER. THANK YOU FOR THAT. DID YOU SAY TEN YEARS FROM NOW.
>> KATHY: WHEN CRITICAL PHASING AND LOOKING TO PROVIDE
PROTECTION FROM FAIRLY FREQUENT STORM EVENTS. THINKING ABOUT
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THINKING ABOUT WHEN THE VARIOUS
IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO HAPPEN. THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'LL WORK
WITH THE COMMUNITY ON. AND WORK THROUGH THE COMMITTEE. I WILL
JUST EMPHASIZE, I HAVE THE FLOOR, WE ARE HOPING WE GET ENGAGED
WITH THE COMMITTEE ON HOW BEST TO ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY.
THAT'S THE FIRST COUPLE OF MEETINGS WE HAVE WITH THIS WORKING
GROUP. TALK ABOUT HOW BEST TO ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND
GET INPUT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY LAST QUESTION, I
WAS HAPPY TO SEE THE TENANT COUNCIL GETTING A SLOT. IT WAS NOT
CLEAR TO ME EXACTLY HOW THAT WAS GOING TO BE DECIDED WHO GETS TO
TAKE THAT SEAT AND WHEN IT IS RESOLVED.
>> KATHY: WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE TENANTS COUNCIL AND LOOK
FOR A RECOMMENDATION FROM THEM FOR SOMEONE TO PARTICIPATE ON
THE COMMITTEE. WE KNOW THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT VOICE THAT NEEDS
TO BE REPRESENTED. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL, BUT DID
WANT TO IDENTIFY THAT AS A VOICE THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE
DISCUSSION.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
RECEIPT OF THE PROGRESS OF THE WORKING GROUP. I WILL NOTE FOR THE
COUNCIL AND THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL AT THE
TIME, THIS PROCESS AND NOTIFICATION OF PROCESS GOES BACK SEVERAL
YEARS. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE KATHY WATKINS, I REMEMBER THE FIRST
CONVERSATION. I SAID, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHO? SHE WAS VERY OPEN.
SHE AND OTHERS AND CITY MANAGER DEPASQUALE, THE CITY HAS TO BE
ENGAGED, AND WE DID ENGAGEMENT BEFORE THIS PROCESS OF APPOINTING
THE COMMITTEE. WE ENGAGE COMMUNITY ART CENTER. WE TALKED

PAGE 31

MAY 3, 2021

ABOUT DOING ART WORK. AND EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD DO TO
GENTLY, BUT CONSISTENTLY ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY OVER TIME. I WANT
TO SAY, MAYBE A MODEL WE WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATIVE
AROUND. REPLICATING ACROSS THE COMMUNITIES SO WE GET A WIDE
RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS, WHICH YOU SEE IN THIS LETTER, SOME NAMES OF
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SELECTED. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S A GOOD THING.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRIED, TRUE, AND LONG TERM
PORT RESIDENTS. IT WAS IMPORTANT IT IS A MIXTURE OF INDIVIDUALS. AS
ODD AS IT MAY SEEM, IT IS A SEWER PROJECT, BUT A COMMUNITY BUILDING
PROJECT BECAUSE WE ARE A BUILT COMMUNITIES. WE ARE INTERESTED IN
KNOWING HOW YOU FEEL. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I HAPPEN TO ASK,
WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU TAKE THE PARK OFFLINE. GREEN ROSE PARK
DOESN'T HAVE BASKETBALL COURT. AND BASKETBALL IS A BIG THING THERE
ARE A NUMBER OF BALL GAMES. I KNOW THERE'S A NAME FOR IT. I CAN'T
THINK ABOUT IT. THEY HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS THROUGH THE CHA.
AND A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN THROUGH PT THAT HAPPEN
ANNUALLY AND BEFORE COVID, WE WERE THINKING ABOUT SOME OTHER
NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS WE DO. TAKING THIS OFFLINE IS
A HUGE THING, WE ARE COGNIZANT OF IT. AND I DO HAVE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE, WE TELL THE CITY FOLKS WHEN THEY HAVEN'T MET THE
STANDARDS, THIS TIME I CAN SAY THEY HAVE MET THEIR STANDARD AND
CONTINUED TO DO SO. I'M PLEASED TO SEE THIS. I'M GLAD TO SEE THE
REPRESENTATION BEING AS VARIED AND DIVERSE RACIALLY, ETHICALLY, AND
INTERGENERATIONALLY. I WILL KEEP AN WATCHFUL EYE ON THE PROCESS
WHERE I'M LITERALLY AROUND THE BLOCK FROM WHERE I LIVE. I WILL DRIVE
BY, WALK BY IT, AND I WILL BE VERY CLOSELY AWARE OF WHAT GOES ON.
GOOD WORK TO THE CITY MANAGER, AND MS. WATKINS, AND I WILL PAY A
LOT OF ATTENTION TO THIS AS I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL DO AS WELL. I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS. ON THE MOTION BY
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS TO PLACE THIS ON FILE, ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM FOUR. (READING CITY
MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER FOUR).
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND MUCH INFORMATION ONLINE.
THE CITY MANAGER AND STAFF TALK ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC WEIGHERS DO
AND THE HISTORY OF THE POSITION IS?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL START OFF AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO OTHERS. I
WILL SAY THIS, I HAVE BEEN CITY MANAGER SINCE STARTING MY FIFTH YEAR
AND I HAVE SAID ONE TIME SOMEONE WILL PULL THIS. IT IS CONFUSING. IT
IS REALLY UNDER THE STATE GUIDANCE OF INSPECTION WE DON'T DO
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT. I WILL LEAVE IT OVER TO
ANTHONY, THE HEAD OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES TO DISCUSS HOW IT
WORKS.

SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT. TESTING THEIR SCALES AND BY
SWEARING IN THE EMPLOYEES THROUGH THE CITY CLERK, THEY AGREE TO
FAITHFULLY AND IMPARTIALLY PERFORM THE DUTIES. WE DON'T HAVE THE
CAPACITY AND EQUIPMENT TO TEST THE SCALES. ONCE A YEAR, WE GO OUT
AND VERIFY A TEST WITH THEM. THEY ARE SELLING TONS OF EQUIPMENT
GRAVEL AND CEMENT. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHTS TO
TEST THE SCALES. I LOOK BACK, THIS IS A PRACTICE SINCE THE EARLY 1990S,
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL. THAT'S WHY WE SWEAR THEIR EMPLOYEES IN.

CITY MANAGER AGENDA
#5
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-25,
regarding a report on
monitoring drought conditions
and an update on demand
projections.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION. WHO
THE FOLKS ARE, HOW THEY ARE SELECTED. BOSTON SAND AND GRAVEL. NOT
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.
>> ANTHONY: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: A PROCESS MANDATED UNDER STATE
LAW? I THINK OF THE COMPANIES THAT THEY HAVE EQUIPMENT.
>> ANTHONY: NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY, THE
FOLLOWING PERSON SHALL BE AUTHORIZED AND NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN
A LICENSE AS PUBLIC WEIGHERS. WE CAN SWEAR THEM IN TO PERFORM THE
DUTIES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: OKAY. THAT'S HELPFUL
BACKGROUND. I WILL YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? I DON'T SEE ANY ON THIS
ONE. ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER TO PLACE THIS
ON FILE, WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: PLACING THE ITEM ON FILE: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR,
ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA ITEM FIVE.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER FIVE) COUNCILLOR NOLAN, YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE I SAW SAM ON THE CALL AS
WELL. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO THE POLICY ORDER ABOUT PLANS ON
THIS. WE ASKED FOR PLANS FOR MONITORING THE SITUATION FOR
COMMUNICATION ABOUT CONSERVATION AND ALSO INSTITUTING WATER
SAVINGS. THE MEMO THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS PRETTY MUCH ANSWERS THE
QUESTION. I DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW IT IS WE'LL DO SOMETHING
DIFFERENT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO THINK WE DIDN'T LEARN OR DIDN'T
THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN 2016, THE LAST TIME WE HAD A
REPORT. WE KNOW WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS, THERE'S AN INCREASE
CHALLENGE TO PREDICT BASED ON PAST USAGE. WE KNOW THAT LAST YEAR,
THE PANDEMIC MEANT THAT WATER USAGE WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT
DOWN BECAUSE THERE WERE 10,000 FEWER STUDENTS AND MAYBE 20,000
FEWER WORKERS AND WE ADD THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOUSING


PAGE 33

MAY 3, 2021

UNITS. TWO QUESTIONS.
I REALLY URGE THE WATER DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE
COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT, EITHER LEE GIANETTI AND TO THE CITY
MANAGER TO RAMP UP THE COMMUNICATION ON DROUGHT IN ADVANCE.
AND I SAY THAT, THE LAST WEEK SINCE THIS CAME OUT, OVER THE WEEKEND,
I WAS AT JERRY'S POND CLEANUP, I ASKED DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE
DROUGHT. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING AND NOBODY HAD. AND IT JUST
MEANS WHILE WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING, THEY WERE NOT EFFECTIVE. I
KNOW THE WATER DEPARTMENT IS TWEETING OUT EVERY DAY. BASED ON
THE LIKES THEY GET, THEY HAVE FEWER AS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF LIKES I
DO. WE ARE NOT GETTING THE COMMUNICATION OUT TO PEOPLE. THEY
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS. I HAVE SUGGESTED, IT COULD BE A
PERFECT ARTICLE FOR THE BIANNUAL COMMUNICATIONS. I WILL SAY, I GOT
THIS POSTCARD TODAY FROM THE CURB SIDE COMPOST IS BACK. IF WE SEE
SIGNS THE DROUGHT IS SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR, WE DO THE FULL COURT
PRESS TO REDUCE THE WATER USE. IT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT
OF THE CITY. THAT WAS JUST ONE URGING YOU TO RAMP IT UP AND DO
MORE. PEOPLE DON'T GET THE MESSAGE FROM EVERYTHING I HAVE
ASCERTAINED BY TALKING TO RESIDENTS.
THE OTHER HOPE, WE ASKED FOR THIS WATER PROJECTION AND IT WAS SAID
IT LONG TERM PLANS WOULD BE UPDATED. WE ANTICIPATE THE EFFORT
WILL TAKE 6 12 MONTHS. I HOPE WE CAN DO IT RELATIVELY QUICK REVIEW.
MAYBE THE WATER BOARD CAN REVIEW IN A FEW MONTHS. AGAIN, WITH
THE PANDEMIC HAVING DAMPENED DEMAND AND WE KNOW WE ARE
ADDING COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, THERE'S LABS THAT USE WATER AND
CONTINUING TO ADD HUNDRED AND THOUSANDS OF UNITS, WE COULD BE
IN A SITUATION WHERE WE NEED A QUICKER SENSE OF THE WATER DEMAND.
I'M NOT SURE IF THE CITY MANAGER OR SOMEONE WANTS TO RESPOND. I
APPRECIATE THE REPORT AND ALSO REALLY HOPE WE MOVE FORWARD
FASTER ON THE WATER DEMAND AND WE COMMUNICATE DIFFERENTLY.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL START AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO SAM. OVER
THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY
NOTIFICATIONS AROUND THE DROUGHT. COUNCILLOR NOLAN, YOU ARE A
KEY FACTOR IN MAKING SURE WE DO THAT. BASED ON COVID, AS MUCH AS
THERE WERE PEOPLE WITH CONCERNS WITH THE DROUGHT, I THINK THEY
PROBABLY COULD HAVE SAW THAT AND DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION AS MUCH AS
THEY WOULD HAVE BECAUSE WE WERE IN A CRISIS. I DO KNOW SAM WE
HAVE TALKED NUMEROUS TIMES ABOUT HOW TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH
MESSAGING. SAM MADE CHANGES ON HOW TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT. IT
IS AN IMPORTANT ONE TO GET OUT. SAM, TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS YOU
ARE DOING. THANK YOU. IT IS IMPORTANT.
>> SAM: WITH THE DEMAND STUDY, IT DOES IF YOU WANT TO DO A REAL
PREDICTION THAT IS REASONABLY ACCURATE. IT TAKES TIME TO GO
THROUGH ALL THE UPDATES THAT THE CITY MAY HAVE DONE ON THE
ZONING AND ALL THAT STUFF AS WELL AS LOOK AT THE PREDICTIONS AND
THE CITY DEPARTMENTS TO GET THE INFORMATION. IT TAKES TIME. IF WE


PAGE 34

MAY 3, 2021

WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPLICATION OF THE PANDEMIC WAS,
WE PROBABLY NEED TIME TO SEE WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE SO WE CAN SEE
WHAT THE IMPACT, LONG TERM IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE PANDEMIC.
I WILL WORK WITH OUR CONSULTANT TO LOOK AT ALL THE STUFF. WE'LL GET
IT DONE. I THINK THEY ARE IMPORTANT KEYS. PAY ATTENTION AND DO ALL
THE DETAILS, OTHERWISE THE PREDICTIONS ARE ALMOST USELESS. TO
ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE CONSERVATION. WE DID ADD CABLE TV TO THE
LIST THIS YEAR, WE DID GET ON THIS EARLIER. WE'LL LOOK TO SEE IF THERE'S
ANY OTHER SUCCESS STORIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT INFORMING
PEOPLE. WE HAVE BEEN DOING WATER CONSERVATION SINCE LAST JULY. WE
NEVER STOPPED DOING THAT OVER THE WINTER. WE ARE DOING THE BILL
STUFFERS. EVERYTHING I PUT IN THE ANSWER. IF THERE ARE SUGGESTION,
HAPPY TO TAKE THEM. WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH WHATEVER IT IS.
WE USE THE SOCIAL MEDIA, UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
FOLLOWERS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE MAY HAVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M SET. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT IS DONE ON
THIS. IT IS DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING AND I'M GRATEFUL WE MOVE
FORWARD. I'M GLAD THERE ARE PLANS TO LOOK AT HOW TO DO IT BETTER.
THANK YOU.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. FOLLOWING UP ON THE QUESTIONS
AROUND COMMUNICATION. I WAS WONDERING IF THE RESERVOIR SYSTEM
CAPACITY WAS ONLINE ANYWHERE? PEOPLE CAN SEE IN AN INTERACTIVE
WAY WHERE WE ARE IN THE RESERVOIR LEVELS? I'M THINKING THAT OVER
THE TIME OF COVID, WE HAD THE COVID DASHBOARD, WE HAD BIOBOT DATA
THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO SEE REALTIME WHERE WE WERE. I WONDER IF
THAT COULD BE AN INTERESTING WAY TO COMMUNICATE WHERE WE ARE IN
THE RESERVOIR LEVELS.
>> SAM: THROUGH YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, WE HAVE GAUGING STATIONS
THAT GIVE US THE RESERVOIR HEIGHTS AND ELEVATIONS. IT WILL GIVE US
VOLUMES, IT IS AVAILABLE. IF PEOPLE WANT TO LOG IN. MAYBE WE HAVE TO
LOOK AT HOW WE MAY MAKE THAT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE. WITHOUT
THE LEVELS, YOU HAVE TO DO CALCULATIONS TO FIGURE OUT THE
PERCENTAGE CAPACITY AND DO A COMPARISON TO THE PREVIOUS YEARS.
THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO IT AND TRY TO MAKE IT SIMPLE SUCH
THAT WE DON'T GET MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. I DO GET A
MONTHLY UPDATE FROM MY WATER SHED STAFF. IT WILL GIVE ME
PERCENTAGES AND COMPARATIVES, 2016, 2017, AND LAST YEAR. WE DO A
MONTHLY REPORT. I GIVE UPDATE TO THE WATER BOARD AND THE CITY
MANAGER. I DID ONE TODAY. GOOD QUESTION AND SEE HOW WE CAN
MAKE THAT MORE READILY AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. WE HAVE SEEN HOW BEHAVIOR CAN
CHANGE, PARTICULARLY OVER COVID, YOU SEE THE NUMBERS GOING UP,

PAGE 35

MAY 3, 2021

YOUR BEHAVIOR CHANGES. I DON'T WANT TO DO A LOT OF MATH WHEN I'M
ON LOOKING AT AN INTERACTIVE WATER GAUGE, IF YOU CAN MAKE IT EASY
FOR PEOPLE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE IN TROUBLE AND POINT TO PEOPLE
REALLY NEED TO CONSERVE, HERE'S WHERE WE ARE AND HERE'S WHERE WE
WERE LAST YEAR. I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT INTERESTING AND
INTERACTIVE NOT FUN. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD. YOU CAN DO A
TWITTER BOT THAT SCRAPES DATA AND DOES A DAILY UPDATES. DIFFERENT
WAYS TO THINK ABOUT COMMUNICATING AND CHANGING BEHAVIOR
RATHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER METHODS THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING
IN THE PAST. THANK YOU FOR BEING OPEN. I LOOK MAYBE TO SEEING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE FUTURE. I THINK IT COULD BE HELPFUL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO OTHER QUESTIONS, ON A MOTION BY COUNCILLOR
NOLAN TO PLACE IT ON FILE, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA 7. (READING
CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 7).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THE CITY MANAGER FORWARDED
THE APPROPRIATION ORDERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2022 BUDGET. THE FY22
BUDGET IS 748 MILLION AND THE FISCAL 22 CAPITAL BUDGET IS 83.9
MILLION. IT INCLUDES A 8.95% INCREASE IN THE PROPERTY TAX LEVEE. THE
ACTUAL TAX LEVEE WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE FALL. AS MY COLLEAGUES
WILL KNOW, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING YEAR.
CHALLENGING IN SO MANY WAYS. MOST OF WHICH IS HARDLY HOW COVID
19 HAS IMPACTED US ALL. THERE'S STILL A HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY
REGARDING THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS. HOWEVER, THE SUBMITTED FISCAL 22
BUDGET MAINTAINS THE HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY AND
EXPANDING SEVERAL IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES. CITY
MANAGER AND HIS STAFF IS CLEARLY LISTEN TO THE COUNCIL, YOU WILL SEE
INCREASES IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS, IN
FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS. SO, IN PARTICULAR, TO HOUSING...

CITY MANAGER AGENDA
#7
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
FY2022 submitted budget and
appropriation orders.

I WANT TO KNOW THIS BUDGET INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION
DEDICATED TO CREATING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST. THIS IS A 17.4% INCREASE FROM LAST
YEAR. OR A 4.7 MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. THIS BUDGET FULLY FUNDS
OVER 30 NEW POSITIONS THAT WERE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR, BUT ONLY
INITIATED FUNDING FOR THREE MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES
REGARDING THE COVID 19.
THE INCREASE PROPERTY TAX SUPPORTED FOR THE SCHOOLS IS 5.3%. THE
SCHOOL COMMITTEE ADOPTED THE BUDGET OF 223.7 MILLION ON APRIL 13
OF 2021. THIS IS A 4.7 INCREASE FROM THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT FISCAL 21
BUDGET, WHICH HAS 213.7 MILLION.
THE FISCAL 22 BUDGET INCLUDES A NEW CONSOLIDATED SPENDING
CATEGORY RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND RACIAL EQUITY. THIS IS IN ADDITION
TO EXISTING CONSOLIDATED SPENDING CATEGORIES OF HOUSING,
HOMELESSNESS, EARLY CHILDHOOD, SUSTAINABILITY, VISION ZERO, TRAFFIC

PAGE 36

MAY 3, 2021

SAFETY, AND ANTIBIAS DIVERSITY TRAINING AND PROGRAMS. THE CITY
MANAGER WILL BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THE FISCAL
22 BUDGET. I'D LIKE RIGHT NOW TO TURN THIS OVER TO MY CO CHAIR,
COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. WE'LL HAVE MORE DETAILED
DISCUSSIONS ON THIS WHEN ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND DETAIL IS
REFERRED TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. WE'LL HAVE MEETINGS IN MAY
THAT I WILL OUTLINE IN A MOMENT. FY22 CAPITAL BUDGET TOTALS 83.9
MILLIONS AND INCLUDES SEWER AND STORMWATER PROJECTS ON RIVER
STREET FOR $20 MILLION, IN THE PORT 2.7 MILLION, AND HARVARD SQUARE
2 MILLION. STREET AND SIDEWALK RECONSTRUCTION, 8.5 MILLION.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT, 18.5 MILLION.
MUNICIPAL FACILITIES IMPROVEMENT PLAN PROJECTS, 10 MILLION. AND
PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING PROJECTS, 525,000.
NEXT WEEK'S COUNCIL AGENDA WILL INCLUDE THE REQUIRED LOAN ORDERS
FOR BONDING CAPITAL PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE FY22 BUDGET. SO, THEY
CAN BE ADOPTED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE FY22 BUDGET LATER ON IN
SPRING. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ALREADY, IN OUR SCHEDULE, COUNCIL
SCHEDULE, FINANCE COMMIT BUDGET HEARINGS WILL TAKE PLACE ON THE
FOLLOWING DATES AND ARE ORGANIZED SO THAT CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS
ARE HEARD ON A PARTICULAR DAY.
TUESDAY, MAY 11, 9:00 A.M. DEPARTMENTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF GENERAL
GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY, MAY 18TH,
10:00 A.M. DEPARTMENTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF HUMAN RESOURCES,
COMMUNITY MAINTENANCE, INTRAGOVERNMENT AND CAPITAL BUDGET
WILL BE DISCUSSED. WEDNESDAY, MAY 19TH, AT 6:00 P.M. THE SCHOOL
DEPARTMENT BUDGET. AND THEN WE HAVE AN OVERFLOW DAY OF
THURSDAY, MAY 20TH, AT 9:00 A.M. ONLY IF NECESSARY. LAST YEAR WE DID
NOT NEED THAT.
CITY MANAGER AND THE TEAM WILL GIVE AN BRIEF OVERVIEW TONIGHT AND
BEFORE THAT, WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THE PUBLIC WILL BE INVITED TO
PARTICIPATE SIMILARLY TO ALL OTHER CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND MAY
WATCH THE MEETINGS REMOTELY AND CAN SUBMIT COMMENTS THROUGH
ZOOM. JUST LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR, THE TWO CO CHAIRS, COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND MYSELF, WE'LL INVITE COUNCIL MEMBERS AFTER REVIEWING
THE BUDGET TO SUBMIT WRITTEN QUESTIONS SO THAT STAFF CAN HAVE THE
TIME TO RESEARCH PROPERLY AND THEORETICALLY WILL HAVE LESS TIMES
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. IT ACTUALLY CREATES A
MORE EFFICIENT SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, JUST LIKE WE ARE
DOING WITH COVID 19.
AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS MENTIONED, THIS YEAR, IT WILL HAVE A RACIAL
AND ECONOMIC EQUITY STATEMENTS. THE BEGINNING OF DOING THAT. IT
MAY NOT BE IN THE DETAIL THAT EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE. AS
YOU RECALL, THE CITY COUNCIL GOALS, ALL OF THEM, WILL HAVE AN
OVERVIEW OF HOW WE ARE ADDRESSING THEM OR NOT. I WILL GIVE THIS


PAGE 37

MAY 3, 2021

TO THE MANAGER, I BELIEVE, AND HIS TEAM TO CONTINUE.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. FIRST, I WILL THANK THE TWO CO CHAIRS
FOR THE LEADERSHIP IN WORKING WITH US THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
OBVIOUSLY, IT IS A DIFFICULT YEAR IN TERMS OF FINANCES IN THE CITY AND
THE COVID. I THINK NO CITY HAS COME THROUGH THIS STRONGER THAN WE
HAVE. I WANT TO THANK DEPARTMENT HEADS AND THE FINANCE TEAM FOR
IT. THE TWO CO CHAIRS DID A GOOD JOB LAYING IT OUT AND I WILL GO
QUICKLY SAY, I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR FOR THE LEADERSHIP ON THE
SCHOOL AND IN TERMS OF THE LEADERSHIP WITH COVID. THERE'S A
MESSAGE THIS YEAR, UNUSUAL, BUT COVID 19 IS UNUSUAL FROM THE
MAYOR AND US, TALKING ABOUT COVID 19 IN THE WORK EVERYBODY HAS
DONE. IT IS THE REGULAR BUDGET MESSAGE AND IT IS A THIRD MESSAGE
THIS YEAR, I REALLY THINK IS IMPORTANT, TRULY BASED ON THE CAMBRIDGE
ANTIRACISM EQUITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVE. WE HAVE NEVER DONE THIS
IN THE MESSAGE, BUT I THINK IT IS A REAL PRIORITY AND I THANK
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR HER LEADERSHIP. AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT
ADDITION AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT IS IN THERE. IN THE BUDGET, WE DIDN'T
GET INTO SPECIFIC BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE HEARINGS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING
IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEADS AND WITH MY
TEAM AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT WE COULD HAVE A 17.4 INCREASE IN THE
TRUST RECALL DID. WE PUT $2 MILLION IN TERMS OF LANDLORD
PROTECTION, ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR HOUSE LIAISON, TRANSITION
WELLNESS CENTER, ET CETERA, AND EVICTION OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE. $2
MILLION IN THOSE AREAS. AND THREE POSITIONS WE FUNDED IN 21 THAT
WILL COME ON BOARD IN 22.
CLEARLY, WE WORK CLOSE WITH THE SCHOOL. IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL
BUDGET PROCESS. I THANK THE MAYOR AND THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE AND
THE COUNCIL TO 5.3% INCREASE AND 36 NEW POSITIONS. OBVIOUSLY, THE
BIG ISSUE WE CAN WORK OUT WITH THE SCHOOL THIS YEAR, A $9 MILLION
SUPPLEMENTAL DUE TO COVID RESTRICTIONS THAT HELPED TO KEEP PEOPLE
GOING. SOME AREAS TO SEE INCREASES, VICE MAYOR MALLON PLAYED A KEY
ROLE, FIRE FIGHTER CADET PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET. WE ARE HAPPY WITH
THAT. EARLY CHILDHOOD INCREASES. LIBRARY HOURS EXPANSIONS, WE
HOPE TO DO THIS YEAR. DUE TO COVID, IT WILL BE NEXT YEAR. VISION ZERO
AND BIKE SAFETY. AND THEN THE CONSOLIDATED SPENDING, IT IS
IMPRESSIVE. AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR CARLONE FOR REALLY
PUSHING THIS CONSOLIDATED SECTION. I WILL RECOGNIZE THE BUDGET
OFFICE. WE HAVE SIX CONSOLIDATED SPENDING. WE STARTED WITH ONE. IT
WAS AROUND HOUSING. IN THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT THE BUDGET STAFF
PUTS IN TO THE CONSOLIDATED EFFORTS IS INCREDIBLE. IT WILL BRING
HOME WHERE WE SPEND MONEY AND WHY. EVERY TIME WE ADD, IT IS AN
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK FOR THE BUDGET AND THE DEPARTMENTS.
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, OVER $212 MILLION JUST IN THE SIX AREAS. I
WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR THEIR SUPPORT, THANK THE BUDGET
AND THE CITY TEAM. THE SIX AREAS TO RECOGNIZE WHERE THE CITY IS
SPENDING MONEY AND WHY. $212 MILLION IS IMPRESS EVER. DAVID IS THE


PAGE 38

MAY 3, 2021

FINANCE CHAIR. THANK HIM FOR THE LEADERSHIP, AND ALL THE MEMBERS, I
CAN TELL YOU, IT IS THE WORLD OF BUDGETING, ESPECIALLY DURING COVID,
WE CONTINUE TO ADD UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BUDGET OFFICE.
THEY DO AND DO WHATEVER WE ASK AND MORE. I THANK ALL OF THEM
AGAIN. THIS WAS GREAT WORK. AND I THINK I'M TURNING IT OVER TO
DAVID. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE HAPPY WHEN
THE BUDGET HEARINGS START TO HAVE MORE.
>> DAVID: FOR THOSE IN THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCIL, SECTION 1, WILL LAY
OUT THE KEY INITIATIVES OF THE CITY. AND I THINK IT CLEARLY
DEMONSTRATES OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE IMPORTANT
PROJECTS WITHIN THE CITY INITIATIVES TO MEET THE GOALS. I ENCOURAGE
FOLKS TO READ THE KEY INITIATIVE SECTION. AS CO CHAIR COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS SAID, 1.1% INCREASE OVER THE FY21 ADJUSTED BUDGET AND
REFLECTS AN 8.95% IN THE PROPERTY TAX LEVEE. HOPEFULLY BY THE FALL,
WE CAN HAVE A LOWER PERCENTAGE INCREASE.
I WILL POINT OUT REVIEWED THE NONPROPERTY TAX REVENUE IN THIS YEAR,
WE USE ESTIMATES FOR FISCAL 22 THAT ARE CONSERVATIVE. AS HOPEFULLY
AS THINGS START TO GET BACK TO THE NEW NORMAL, SOME OF THE
NONPROPERTY TAX REVENUE RELATED TO HOTEL/MOTEL, MEALS TAX, OTHER
DEPARTMENTAL REVENUES, PARKING AND FUND REVENUE, WATER AND
SEWER, THEY WILL BOUNCE BACK SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE CAN MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS. WE ARE MINDFUL TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T OVER BUDGET
THE NONPROPERTY TAX REVENUES. ARE FORTUNATE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE
ABILITY TO USE THE RESERVES AND HELP BALANCE THE BUDGET. INCLUDING
USING 2.5 MILLION IN OUR OVERLAY SURPLUS ACCOUNT, WHICH WE DO
EVERY YEAR. 17 MILLION IS ESTIMATED TO BE USE FOR FREE CASH, SAME AS
LAST YEAR. AND WE CONTINUE TO USE 8.5 MILLION IN THE DEBT
STABILIZATION FUND, INCREASE FROM FISCAL 21. AND 13.75 MILLION IN THE
HOUSE CLAIMS TRUST FUND, INCREASE OF 1.25 MILLION.
CO CHAIR COUNCILLOR CARLONE MENTIONED THE CAPITAL BUDGET. AGAIN,
THE INVESTMENTS WE MAKE THERE. TOTAL 83.9 MILLION. AND THE LOAN
ORDERS THAT WILL COME FORTH NEXT WEEK SO WE CAN MOVE THEM TO A
SECOND READING. LAST YEAR, WE TALKED ABOUT FISCAL 21 BEING A BRIDGE
YEAR TO 22. AND I THINK WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT AND TRY TO
KEEP OUR PROPERTY TAX LEVEE AS MODERATE AS POSSIBLE. ALSO,
CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENT IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS. WITH THAT, WE'LL
GO THROUGH A FEW THINGS TO HIGHLIGHT OTHER ISSUES.
>> TAHA: THANK YOU. I REALLY WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU TO
THE CITY MANAGER, TO ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER, ASSISTANT FISCAL
DIRECTOR, FOR PROVIDING SO MUCH SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. AND REALLY THE ENTIRE FISCAL TEAM AND
DEPARTMENTS IN THE CITY. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND IT WAS TOUCHED
ON BY THE STAFF FOR THE BUDGET OFFICE, ANGELA, DEPUTY BUDGET
DIRECTOR, PROVIDE INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP AND INVALUABLE EXPERIENCE.
DANIEL, WHO NOT ONLY DID AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK. IT WAS A
SUCCESSFUL AND VIRTUAL ABBREVIATED PROCESS IN WHICH OVER 7,200


PAGE 39

MAY 3, 2021

CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE VOTE IN HOW TO SPEND A
PORTION OF THE CAPITAL BUDGET. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY GIVEN ALL THE
RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO COVID.
I WILL WELCOME AND THANK THE NEWEST MEMBER, JACKSON, WHO JOINED
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. JUMPED IN AND HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT. AND
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN GETTING THIS DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. I
WANT TO RECOGNIZE MATT NELSON, WHO IS IN THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE
RIGHT NOW AND IN ADDITION TO DOING INCREDIBLE WORK THERE, HELPED
TO WORK ON SEVERAL KEY DEPARTMENTS. IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AS THE
CITY MANAGER MENTIONED. NOT JUST TO PUT THE BOOK TOGETHER, BUT
WORKING WITH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET SEASON AS WE
CALL IT. IT REALLY STARTS IN THE FALL.
I THINK IT IS HELPFUL, THERE'S SO MUCH IN THE BUDGET BOOK AND SO
MUCH INFORMATION TO WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE SECTIONS, I
KNOW WE'LL HAVE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS ON THE CONTENT LATER
ON AT THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HEARINGS, IT IS HELPFUL TO BRIEFLY WALK
THROUGH THE SECTIONS OF THE BOOK. I'M GOING TO TRY TO SHARE MY
SCREEN AND LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKS. ARE PEOPLE SEEING THIS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> TAHA: GREAT. BUDGET BOOK HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION IN IT. IT IS
REALLY CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE CITY PLAN TO USE THE RESOURCES OVER
THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO
CAMBRIDGE AND MEETS THE CITY'S IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND CONSIDERS
WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN THE FUTURE.
A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THE 22 BUDGET BOOK REFLECTS THE IMPACT THAT
COVID 19 HAD ON THE CITY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND AS WE LOOK MOVING
INTO NEXT YEAR. SECTION ONE AND TWO, THEY ARE THE INTRODUCTION
AND CITY OVERVIEW. AND INCLUDE INFORMATION ON WHAT THE CITY
MANAGER MENTIONED, INCLUDING THE KEY INITIATIVES PART OF THE FY22
BUDGET. WHAT THEY MEAN. THERE'S A SPECIAL COVID MESSAGE. DEALING
WITH COVID AND REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CITY. IT IS IMPORTANT
TO RECOGNIZE NOT ONLY ALL THE STRATEGIES OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET
THAT WE HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS, BUT ALSO THAT THE CITY'S
ABILITY TO DO THAT IS REALLY BECAUSE OF HOW WE DO OUR BUDGETING.
AND THE FISCAL POLICIES OF THE CITY.
CITY MANAGER'S MESSAGE, IT OUTLINE S WHAT THE COVID 19 IMPACT HAD
IN TERMS OF CREATING THE BUDGET AND THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY
IT, BUT ALSO HOW WE MAINTAINED A LOT OF OUR KEY INITIATIVES, THEN
EXPANDED PROGRAMS, CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPORTANT
PRIORITIES AS A CITY. THERE IS AS THE CITY MANAGER MENTIONED, A
SPECIAL MESSAGE REGARDING THE CITY'S ANTIRACISM, EQUITY, AND
INCLUSION INITIATIVES. AND EFFORT S THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE EFFORTS OF
THE FOUR DEPARTMENTS. CITY MANAGER OFFICE, PERSONNEL
DEPARTMENT, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES AND THE CAMBRIDGE
POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND REALLY REFLECTS THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE


PAGE 40

MAY 3, 2021

THAT HAS BEEN PLACED ON THIS TOPIC, AS FAR AS EVERYTHING THE CITY
DOES. REFLECTED THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET. CONSOLIDATED SPENDING
SECTION, YOU HEARD MENTIONED, INCLUDES A NEW RACIAL AND ECONOMIC
EQUITY SECTION. IT REFLECTS ALL THE SPENDING THE CITY DOES
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ADDRESSING RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUITY
ISSUES.
AS COUNCILLOR CARLONE MENTIONED, THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EVOLVING
SECTION TO FLUSH OUT AND GET TO THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT IS USEFUL
FOR PEOPLE AND READERS CAN UNDERSTAND. IT IS LAID OUT SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHER CONSOLIDATED SPENDING CATEGORIES. WE
WANT TO DIVE DEEPER INTO HOW THE DIFFERENT FUNDS ARE SPENT. MORE
INFORMATION ON THAT. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING
CONSOLIDATED SPENDING SECTIONS FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS,
EARLY CHILDHOOD, SUSTAINABILITY, VISION ZERO AND TRAFFIC SAFETY. AND
ANTIBIAS AND DIVERSITY TRAINING AND PROGRAMMING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SORRY TO INTERRUPT. ARE YOU YOU WANT TO BE
SCROLLING OR JUST THE FIRST PAGE YOU WANT TO SHOW US.
>> TAHA: I'M JUST SHOWING THE FIRST PAGE. IT IS 400 AND SOMETHING
PAGES. SECTION TWO OF THE BUDGET BOOK INCLUDES INFORMATION ON
HOW TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE BUDGET BOOK AND EXAMPLE
DEPARTMENT PAGES. A GOOD TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FORMAT AND
LAYOUT OF THE DIFFERENT PAGES. SECTION TWO ALSO INCLUDES SOME
GENERAL BENCHMARKS FOR CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS AND KEY AREAS.
SECTION THREE, YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL SUMMARIES. PROVIDES AFTER
OVERVIEW OF WHERE THE CITY IS FINANCIALLY AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY,
WHY THE CITY'S BUDGETING STRATEGY IS WHAT IT IS. AND THE FINANCIAL
POLICIES ARE AND THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE REVIEWED AND WHAT IS IN THE
SECTION IS A LARGE PART OF THE REASON WHY THE CITY IS ABLE TO HAVE
THE FLEXIBILITY IT DOES TO DO SO MANY OF THE THINGS MENTIONED
WITHIN THE BUDGET.
SECTION FOUR OF THE BOOK DETAILS ALL OF THE REVENUES THAT THE CITY
WILL USE IN THE BUDGET. TAXES ARE OBVIOUSLY OUR BIGGEST REVENUE
SOURCE. THIS YEAR, MANY OTHER KEY NONPROPERTY TAX REVENUES ARE
BUDGETED LOWER BECAUSE OF COVID 19 IMPACTS. DAVID MENTIONED
THIS. SOME OF THE SAME REVENUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO LIMIT
IMPACTS ON TAXPAYERS WHEN WE LOOK AT WAYS TO FUND ALL OF THE NEW
AND EXPANDED INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SHOWN IN THE
BUDGET.
SECTION FIVE, THE LARGEST SECTION. IT PROVIDES INFORMATION ON WHAT
EACH DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION DOES WITHIN THE CITY. THE OBJECTIVES
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR AND HOW THE THINGS RELATE TO CITY COUNCIL
GOALS. WHAT WE ARE SPENDING BY DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS BY DIVISION
IN FY22. I THINK ONE THING YOU WILL NOTICE IN THE FY22 BOOK, JUST
ABOUT EVERY DEPARTMENT IN THEIR NARRATIVE INCLUDES HOW COVID 19
HAS AFFECTED THEIR WORK, BOTH IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND LOOK


PAGE 41

MAY 3, 2021

AHEAD TO FISCAL YEAR 22.
THESE ARE EXAMPLE PAGES. SECTION FIVE, DEPARTMENTS AND FUNDING
ARE ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT FUNCTION. INCLUDING
GENERAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC SAFETY, COMMUNITY MAINTENANCE AND
DEVELOPMENT, HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. EDUCATION AND
INTRAGOVERNMENTAL. AND SECTION SIX, PUBLIC INVESTMENT SECTION,
PLAN SPENDING ON CAPITAL PROJECTS AS WELL AS OUR PLAN OVER THE
NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN CAMBRIDGE, OBVIOUSLY WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE
THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WE DO TO PUT INTO CAPITAL
INVESTMENTS IN THE CITY. IT HAS PROJECTS FOR SCHOOLS,
INFRASTRUCTURE, MUNICIPALITY FACILITIES, TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT.
EACH CAPITAL PROJECT AND FUNDING SOURCE IN THE SECTION IS ALSO
DETAILED, ALONG WITH PHOTOS AND INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE YEAR
FUNDING.
MOVING TO SECTION SEVEN. THE APPROPRIATION ORDERS. THIS IS WHAT IS
ACTUALLY ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL. THESE ARE THE BUDGETED AMOUNTS
AND REVENUES FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN EACH CATEGORIES LISTED. YOU
CAN THINK OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES BEFORE THIS SECTION IN THE
BUDGET BOOK AS A LOT OF CONTEXT AND BACKUP INFORMATION FOR ALL
OF THE NUMBERS. EACH APPROPRIATION IN THE SECTION TIES BACK IN
SOME WAY TO THE BUDGET BOOK. FINALLY, THE GLOSSARY AND INDEX ARE
SELF EXPLANATORY. WE WORK TO KEEP THE DEFINITION AND TERMS
UPDATED TO HELP EXPLAIN WHAT IS IN THE BOOK. BOTTOM LINE, WE WANT
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND BE COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS IN THE
BUDGET AND WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES GOING TOWARDS A
COMMUNITY.
WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BOOK AND APPROPRIATIONS ARE REALLY ABOUT
BEING RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS. COUNCIL GOALS AND CITY
PRIORITIES IN A WAY THAT IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. SO, THANK YOU. I
KNOW THERE ARE FINANCE SCHEDULES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN REACH OUT TO MYSELF AND THE BUDGET
OFFICE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. AND HARD COPIES OF THE BOOK AND
BUDGET BACKUP WILL BE MORE ACTIVELY DISTRIBUTED STARTING
TOMORROW. BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THOSE.
>> CITY MANAGER: ONE OTHER POINT ON THE REVENUE SIDE, BECAUSE IT
WAS A COUNCIL ORDER. WE DIDN'T FINALIZE THE DECISION ON WHAT WE
DO WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES ON THE REVENUE SIDE. CLEARLY, WE
RECOGNIZE THE CONCERN THE COUNCIL HAS. SOME OF THE NUMBERS ARE
IN THERE AND WE'LL LOOK AT THAT. COUNCIL ORDER HAS BEEN LOOKED AT
PART OF THE BUDGET PREPARATION. WE HAVEN'T FINALIZED AND IT I THANK
THE LEADERSHIP FOR THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LOOKING AT THE TIME. I THINK I SEE ONE HAND. WE
SHOULD MOVE ON AS WE'LL HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS THE BUDGET.
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE. I


PAGE 42

MAY 3, 2021

DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS. I'M SURPRISED
THERE IS NO OTHER BUDGET DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO THIS PRESENTATION.
THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING USUAL ABOUT THIS YEAR. I DO FIND THAT
DISAPPOINTING. ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A BUDGET THAT IS
BASICALLY DONE AND WE GET TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. IN PARTICULAR,
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE
CONSOLIDATING CATEGORY. AND THE EFFORTS BY THE CITY. AND THEN IN
CONTRAST, IT LOOKS LIKE THE POLICE BUDGET IS BEING INCREASED AGAIN.
THAT'S CLEARLY A CONTRADICTION THERE. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING
YET ABOUT THE ALLOCATIONS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR AROUND
THE POLICE BUDGET. I DO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND
KNOWING WE'LL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS THAT. I WANT TO RAISE
THAT AS A CONCERN. PRESENTED THE BUDGET IN THIS WAY AND GIVEN ALL
THAT HAPPENED.
>> CITY MANAGER: I KNOW WE ARE RUNNING LATE. I WILL JUMP IN AND
SAY, WE TRIED TO GIVE THE COUNCIL UPDATES ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THE
BUDGET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND WITH SUPPLEMENTALS. THIS IS HOW
IT WORKS. WE WORK WITH THE FINANCE CHAIRS, WITH THE POLICE BUDGET,
LAST YEAR, WE HELD UP THE RECRUITMENT CLASS SIX MONTHS AS WE TOLD
THE COUNCIL WE WOULD. THAT'S THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGET. AS YOU
KNOW, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAVE A
COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE POLICE BUDGET. WE ARE WAITING FOR
RECOMMENDATION. WE SUBMITTED THE BUDGET AHEAD OF TIME AND WILL
MAKE CHANGES AFTER THE RECOMMENDATIONS. POLICE BUDGET, COST OF
COMMUNICATION AND WORKING WITH THE CHAIRS, WE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE BEST APPROACH. WHAT WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO, WE HEALTH
THAT AND HELD IT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED
TO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO WITH THE POLICE BUDGET.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL FOR A WELL
PREPARED PRESENTATION. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND A LOT OF
INPUT. AND WE'LL HEAR BACK FROM THE STAFF AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT
IS ONLY $5 MILLION, I LOOK AT THE TRAVEL AND TRAINING BUDGET. I'M NOT
SURE WE HAVE BEEN DOING ANY TRAVEL IN THE PAST YEAR. IF THAT IS
ANTICIPATED. THERE'S ONE DEPARTMENT, 60% OF THE BUDGET IS FOR
TRAVEL AND TRAINING. LOOKING FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THAT. I
LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? CO CHAIRS? ANYTHING TO
ADD BEFORE WE REFER THIS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: NOTHING FOR ME. I WILL DEFER TO MY CO
CHAIR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU TO BOTH. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE
QUESTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL MAY HAVE AND THE MORE CONCISE THE
QUESTIONS, THE BETTER THE RESPONSE. AND LAST YEAR, IT WAS WELL
DONE. IT WAS A FAIR WAY OF DOING IT. I HOPE WE'LL HAVE EXACTLY THE
SAME PROCESS.

Charter Right exercised by
Councillor Simmons in council
April 26, 2021

(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
I WON'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUE, THE IDEA OF THE EDITS WERE TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO DO A NUMBER
OF THINGS IN THE CITY. RECOVER FROM COVID, BUT ALSO WE WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN A POLICY ORDER THAT SPEAKS TO THE
CITY COUNCIL'S DESIRE TO HAVE HOMEOWNERSHIP OVER RENTAL, WE HAVE
TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IS LENDING ITSELF
MORE TO LONG TERM STABILITY THAN RENTALS.
WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT IN DOING SO, WE DON'T HARM OURSELVES BY
HOW IT WOULD AFFECT THE BOND RATING. MAKE SURE WE KNOW THAT
OUT FRONT THAT WE DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK, WHICH TALKS ABOUT
ENLARGING THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP, IT DOESN'T HURT
OUR ABILITY TO BORROW. LASTLY, I WAS KEEN TO HAVE THIS IN HERE, AS
MANY OF YOU KNOW, FOR SEVERAL YEARS, I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SEE IF WE
CAN DO LGBT HOUSING. THE PUSHBACK I GET, WE TALK TO THE CAMBRIDGE
HOUSING AUTHORITY, TALKED WITH THE CITY, WE TALKED ABOUT THE
CHERRY STREET LOT, YOU COULDN'T USE FUNDS TO DISCRIMINATE. WE SAID,
LGBT HOUSING ONLY, WE'LL DISCRIMINATE. I WILL MAKE SURE WE WERE


PAGE 44

MAY 3, 2021

NOT OUT OF STEP. I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE, AS WE TALKED IT THROUGH,
DON'T WANT TO BE OUT OF THE STEP WITH THE FAIR HOUSING LAWS. AND
THE REST IS SELF EXPLANATORY.
I WILL YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUE AND LEAD MAKER OF THE MOTION TO
DISCUSS MORE THE EDITS OR OTHER PARTS OF THIS ORDER IF HE IS INCLINED.
IF THERE IS NO DISCUSSION FROM MY COLLEAGUE, I WILL BRING IT TO THE
FLOOR FOR DEBATE. I HOPE YOU WILL ADOPT THIS. I THINK IT WAS A REAL
DEMONSTRATION OF COLLABORATION AROUND AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND MOST IMPORTANT TO THE CITY.
THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES
FOR COSPONSORING THIS ORDER AND DOING THIS WORK, BRINGING
FORWARD THE AMENDMENTS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I DID REVIEW THEM, I
CERTAINLY DO APPROVE THEM, THESE ARE HER AMENDMENTS. I BELIEVE
THE ORDER AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN WAS SUFFICIENT. I DO SUPPORT
THE AMENDMENT S IF THAT IS WHAT IS NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD ON
THIS VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE.
I'LL SAY 100 UNITS A YEAR OVER TEN YEARS, ROUGHLY $500,000 A UNIT IS
$500 MILLION DOLLARS. WE ARE ASKING THAT LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN
OUR AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS. I RECOGNIZE THE
PROGRAMS ARE NOT THE FULL EXTENT THEY CERTAINLY DO GO A LONG
WAY TOWARDS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THEIR HOME. RATHER
THAN HAVING TO RELINQUISH 30% OF THE INCOME TO HAVE A ROOF OVER
THEIR HEAD UNDER THE RENTAL PROGRAM. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID,
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT THAT WE INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM. OF
COURSE, I DO AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF
THE LAW. THAT'S WHY IT IS WORDED THE WAY IT WAS. WITH MY
DISCUSSION WITH STAFF AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS, WHAT I
HAVE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY, WE CAN GIVE PREFERENCE TO FIRST
GENERATION AND FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS, WHERE WE CANNOT GIVEN THE
FAIR HOUSING LAW GIVE PREFERENCE BASED ON RACE.
I SUPPORT THE AMENDMENTS. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL AND WE CAN
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DISCUSSION? QUESTIONS? COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THERE'S NO QUESTION I SUPPORT
MAXIMIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OWNERSHIP OR RENTAL FOR THAT
MATTER. THE DIFFICULTY WITH HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THAT AS WAS
RECENTLY DISCUSSED, IT DOESN'T STAY AFFORDABLE VERY LONG IF IT IS IN
THE TRADITIONAL SENSE OF OWNERSHIP. I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE
DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF TO GET THE FUNDING BECAUSE IT WON'T JUST COME
FROM THE CITY, IT COMES FROM FEDS AND THE STATE AND PROBABLY FIVE
OTHER WAYS TO DO IT. IN PRINCIPLE, I SUPPORT IT. I WAS ASKED TO SIGN
AND BE A SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL, I FELT IT WAS WRONG TO SPECIFY
$500 MILLION. AT LEAST 100 UNITS A YEAR IS OVER $500 MILLION. WITH
INFLATION. UNITS COME IN AT $650,000 A PIECE. IN PRINCIPLE, I SUPPORT


PAGE 45

MAY 3, 2021

IT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE WHAT WE ARE SAYING WE WANTED, WHICH
IS LITERALLY OWNED BY THE TENANTS. THAT MEANS YOU INVEST MILLIONS
AND IT IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE WITHIN TWO OWNERS. I DON'T THINK
WE'LL GET MONEY FOR THAT AS READILY AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. I JUST
WANTED TO MENTION THAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. IN RESPONSE TO COUNCILLOR
CARLONE, I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS POLICY ORDER AND THE ONE
COMING UP ABOUT US REALLY FOCUSSING ON HOMEOWNERSHIP ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF EQUITY, ADDRESSING THE WEALTH AND EQUITY GAPS ARE
THE CAUSE OF SO MUCH CHALLENGE AND RACIAL INEQUITY IN THE CITY.
GIVEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S REMARKS, I DON'T VIEW THIS AS PRECLUDING
THE IDEA OF LIMITED EQUITY CO OP OR OTHER OWNERSHIP. IT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT IS A STRICT MARKET BASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF THAT CAN
BE CLARIFIED. WE ARE ASKING THE CITY MANAGER TO REVIEW THINGS AND
DO A BOND. ALLOWS FOR ONGOING AFFORDABILITY DO WE HAVE AN
ANSWER ON THAT? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER
ONCE THIS IS STUDIED?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE POLICY ORDER DOESN'T
SPECIFY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUE, I
BELIEVE WHAT WAS COUNCILLOR CARLONE WAS SAYING, WE'LL HAVE TO
IMPLEMENT IT THROUGH SOME FORM OF LIMITED EQUITY. IF WE DIDN'T, IT
WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC. OUR CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP
PROGRAM... EXAMINING THAT IN THE POLICY ORDER THAT IS ON THE
AGENDA. THE CURRENT PROGRAM S LIMIT ED EQUITY AND THE ASSUMPTION
THIS WOULD BE AS WELL, EVEN IF WE MADE ADJUSTMENTS WE'D
PRESUMABLY FACTOR ALL THE CONSIDERATIONS INTO ADJUSTMENTS WE
WANT TO MAKE TO THE PROGRAMS.
THIS ORDER DOESN'T DICTATE EXACTLY HOW THE PROGRAMS SHOULD
OPERATE. OF COURSE, WE CAN'T ANTICIPATE OR PREDICT THE NEXT TEN
YEARS HOW WE'LL DO AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CAMBRIDGE. THIS
IS PURELY A FUNDING INSTRUMENT. WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE
MONEY TO DO THIS. AND THE POLICY AND SPECIFIC HOW WE DO IT ARE LEFT
TO BE DETERMINED.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY, WE
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. AND WE'LL HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
THIS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE COUNCILLOR TOOMEY.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I DO SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THE
POLICY ORDER, BUT I STRONGLY URGE THAT THERE BE SOME TYPE OF AN
EQUITY, LIMITED EQUITY ON EACH PROPERTY. I THINK OF ONE SPECIFIC
DEVELOPMENT, 30 YEARS AGO, STARTED OFF AS AFFORDABLE. NO LIMITED
EQUITY. ALL THE HOUSES GO FOR OVER A MILLION DOLLARS. MAYBE FOUR
OR FIVE ORIGINAL FAMILIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE STILL THERE.


PAGE 46

MAY 3, 2021

ALL THE OTHERS HAVE PASSED OR THE FAMILY SOLD. AS I SAID, THEY ARE
GOING FOR OVER A MILLION. I THINK WE HAVE TO VERY COGNIZANT OF
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. COUNCILLOR CARLONE SAID, THEY DON'T STAY
AFFORDABLE VERY LONG. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THE DISCUSSIONS, I
REALLY WOULD URGE THAT THERE BE SOME TYPE OF LIMITED EQUITY TO
PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. NICE HOME, BIG
YARD AND DRIVEWAYS, AND NOW THEY ARE OVER A MILLION EACH ONE.
AND THAT IS CERTAINLY PRICING OUT ANY FUTURE AFFORDABILITY FOR ANY
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES IN THE CITY. I URGE THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT
THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. QUESTIONS, CONCERNS FROM
MEMBERS? NEW AMENDMENTS BEFORE US. WE SHOULD DO A ROLL CALL
TO ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS AND THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE VOTE
ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: FIRST VOTE IS ON THE MOMENTS, WHICH ARE BEFORE THE
COUNCIL AND ON THE SCREEN. THEY ARE TO DELETE THE THREE ORDERED
PARAGRAPHS THAT EXIST IN THE POLICY ORDER AND REPLACE THEM WITH
THE FOUR PARAGRAPHS ON THE SCREEN. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL)
NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN INFORMED ME HE HAS
ANOTHER AMENDMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I FORWARDED THAT TO THE CLERK AS WELL. I
WILL WAIT FOR HIM TO PUT IT ON THE SCREEN. WE DON'T KNOW IF 100
UNITS A YEAR FOR 10 YEARS WILL ADDRESS THE FULL SCOPE OF THE CRISIS.
IN TERMS OF DENYING HOMEOWNERSHIP TO BLACK AND BROWN RESIDENTS
AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF THE CITY. THE AMENDMENT I PROPOSE IS
THAT THE QUESTION ALSO BE STUDIED TO DETERMINE HOW MANY UNITS
WE'D NEED IN ORDER TO FULLY ADDRESS THE ADJUSTMENTS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I DON'T THINK THAT IS A QUESTION THAT IS
GOING TO BE EASILY ANSWERED. HOW MANY DO WE NEED? HOW BIG DO
WE WANT THE CITY TO GET? HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE HERE? I
WANT TO PUT IT IN, I THINK IT IS A BIG DEAL. I WOULDN'T I THINK IT IS
UNREALISTIC THEY CAN GIVE A NUMBER.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SIMILAR
THING. THIS IS A TIME SENSITIVE ISSUE. I THINK WE WANT A PRELIMINARY
REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET. AND THEN A FULL REPORT AFTER. I'M NOT
SURE THIS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACE TO ASK THIS QUESTION IF WE
WANT ANY OF THIS INFORMATION BACK IN A TIMELY MANNER. I WON'T
VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AMENDMENT. IF MY COLLEAGUE
WANTS TO PUT SOMETHING IN LATER OR A COMMITTEE HEARING ON THIS,
THAT IS AMENDABLE. THIS SEEMS TO BE AN INAPPROPRIATE ASK IN THIS
POLICY ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. MY COLLEAGUE AND I DOES WORK


PAGE 47

MAY 3, 2021

COLLABORATIVELY ON WHAT IS BEFORE YOU. THIS IS NEW TO ME. WHERE I
SUPPORT THE INTENT WITHOUT ANY RESERVATION, MY CONCERN IS IT WILL
SLOW DOWN OUR PROCESS TO GET IT BACK. I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY
COLLEAGUE PERHAPS TO SIMPLY ASK BRING IN AS A LATE ORDER WITH A
TIMELINE THAT IS FURTHER OUT. I DON'T WANT TO SLOW IT DOWN OR GET
RUSHED WORK BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET ALL THE ANSWERS TO WHAT
IS BEFORE US BY WAY OF THIS POLICY ORDER. I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE
INTENT, MY CONCERN IS THAT WE WON'T GET THE RESPONSE BACK AND IT
SLOWS DOWN THE OTHER BODY OF WORK. IT IS MY COLLEAGUE'S
AMENDMENT. I DO SUPPORT THE INTENT. I DON'T SUPPORT IT BEING
ATTACHED TO THIS POLICY ORDER. I YIELD.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE BEFORE GOING BACK TO COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DO APPRECIATE THAT
CONCERN. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO EXPECT OR ASK THAT QUESTION BE
ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY OR IN A SHORT TIME FRAME. HOWEVER, I THINK IT
DOES MAKE SENSE AS PART OF THE POLICY ORDER. WE ARE ASKING IF THIS
TYPE OF INFORMATION TO INCLUDE THIS QUESTION WITH THE
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A QUICK ANSWER. I
APPRECIATE THERE MAY NOT BE AN EXACT ANSWER, BUT WE'D HOPE TO GET
A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: RESPECTFULLY, I WOULD SAY, MODIFY THE
ORDER TO SAY... I DON'T HAVE MY GLASSES. IN ADDITION, WE'D LIKE AS
SOON AS RESPONSIBLE, SOME LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE PUT THERE, THAT
SAYS I DON'T WANT THE WHOLE REPORT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GET THIS
ANSWER. IF WE ARE NOT VERY SPECIFIC, THE CDD WILL DO THIS WORK AND
MAYBE SOLICITOR ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW. THEY WON'T PARSE THAT
OUT. THEY WILL THINK EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE GIVEN IN THE TIME FRAME
IN THE MAIN ORDER. ARE YOU WILLING TO ADD LANGUAGE SEEING YOU
DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT OUT THAT SAYS... THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
BE ADDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT TO STOP GETTING THE REST OF
THE INFORMATION. THIS IS IMPORTANT. WE WANT IT TO GO FORWARD. WE
DON'T COLLECT ENOUGH ETHNIC DATA, I BELIEVE, I THINK IT WILL GET
SLOWED DOWN. IN TURN, WE'D BE UPSET WITH CDD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
GET THE INFORMATION BACK IN A TIMELY FASHION WHEN WE SET THEM UP
TO NOT BE ABLE TO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK, WE CAN PUT THIS ON THE TABLE
FOR NOW. COME BACK LATER. PASS IT TONIGHT. IT STAYS THE SAME. I'D
RATHER NOT PASS IT WITHOUT SOME SORT OF SPECIFICATION SAYING THIS IS
NOT TO SLOW DOWN THE REST OF THE WORK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I THINK ONE OPTION IS TO SAY...
AT A LATER DATE. IT WILL MAKE IT CLEAR WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR THAT
REPORT BACK ON THE SAME TIME TABLE AS THE OTHER QUESTION.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I THINK IT IS CLEANER FOR THIS TO COME IN AS
A SEPARATE ORDER NEXT WEEK. NOT MUCH IS BEING DONE BETWEEN THIS


PAGE 48

MAY 3, 2021

WEEK AND NEXT WEEK. RATHER THAN SPENDING ALL THIS TIME TRYING TO
WORDSMITH SOMETHING TO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. BRING IT IN NEXT
WEEK. IT WILL BE CLEAN. ON ITS OWN. ASK FOR A REPORT AND I THINK
THAT'S THE BEST WAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AMENDMENTS ARE BEFORE US ALREADY. PER THE
CLERK, THEY NEED TO BE WITHDRAWN OR GO AHEAD AND DO AN UP AND
DOWN VOTE. WHAT IS THE PLEASURE? COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WILL BRING IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. HE WILL BRING IT ON A SEPARATE ORDER. WE'LL
DO POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED AND ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER TWO. (READING
CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER 2).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I MOVE MY CHARTER RIGHT FOR
TWO REASONS. ONE, IT WAS LATE. AND TWO, I FOUND IT SOMEWHAT
INFLAMMATORY IN THE PRESENTATION. I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN, THERE'S
SOME THINGS THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN, I BELIEVE, A READER WITHOUT
KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT CAMBRIDGE WOULD GET THE IMPRESSION THAT
OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS AGGRESSIVE, HARMFUL TO PEOPLE, JUST
DOING REALLY OUTRAGEOUS ACTS. AM ON THE RIGHT ONE?

Motion to amend Calendar
Item #2 by Councilors
McGovern and Councillor
Simmons.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE AT COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S ORDER.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: GREAT. I'M SCROLLING. I'M GOING TOO FAST.
LOOK AT THE FIRST WHEREAS, WE KNOW THEY ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO
DE ESCALATION, I DON'T LIKE TO USE THE WORD DEMILITARIZATION, I AND
MANY OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT SEE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS MILITARIZED.
MY SEVEN YEAR OLD, WHO I LOVE TO MENTION ALL THE TIME, THINKS THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE THERE ARE VERY, VERY
WONDERFUL PEOPLE TO THE DEGREE HE THINKS ALL POLICE ARE
WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND HAD A REAL RUDE AWAKENING IN ANOTHER CITY
IN MASSACHUSETTS, SHE WENT UP TO SAY HELLO AND THE POLICE OFFICERS
REBUFFED HERE. I HAD TO GIVE HER EVERY POLICE IS NOT LIKE CAMBRIDGE
TO HER.
I JUST THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN. YOU WOULD
THINK THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. WE HAD NOT BEEN EXTRAORDINARY WORK
IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT GOING BACK TO 2008 AND 2009. I KNOW I
RECENTLY HAD A CONVERSATION AROUND POLICING WITH 50 PLUS PEOPLE.
AT LEAST MORE THAN HALF OF THEM WERE NOT IN THE... THOUGHT OF
MIND TO DEFUND OR DEMILITARIZE. TO HAVE THIS WITHOUT A
CONVERSATION WITH THE COMMUNITY, WITHOUT ENGAGING OUR POLICE
DEPARTMENT, WITHOUT ENGAGING MORE VOICES, PRO AND CON, I THINK IT
IS UNFAIR.
I SUSPECT I'M HOPING THE INTENTION OF THE COLLEAGUE THAT PUT THIS
FORWARD WERE PURE. I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH ONE OF


PAGE 49

MAY 3, 2021

MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, HE HAS PUT TOGETHER SOME
COMPROMISED LANGUAGE. I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD THE FLOOR TO HIM TO
ALLOW HIM TO TALK ABOUT THAT. WHAT WE CAME UP WITH AND I WANT
TO THANK HIM, OTHERWISE WITHOUT THIS LANGUAGE, I WOULD HAVE TO
VOTE AGAINST THIS BECAUSE I THINK I OFTEN SAY THIS, YOU MAY GO IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, YOU ARE CHOOSING THE WRONG METHOD. WITH
THAT, I WILL YIELD. AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM MY OTHER
COLLEAGUES ON THIS. THIS ORDER STANDS THE WAY IT IS, I WILL NOT VOTE
FOR IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I RECOGNIZE WE DON'T AGREE
ON THIS ISSUE. I WANT TO SET A COUPLE OF THINGS STRAIGHT. I HAVE
DONE EXTENSIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY, WITH THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT, WITH THE COMMISSIONER, MAYOR AND I MET WITH THE
COMMISSIONER AND THE CITY MANAGER ON THIS ISSUE, WE HAD A
COMMUNITY COMMITTEE MEETING ON THIS TOPIC. THE VIDEO IS
AVAILABLE FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO WATCH, WHERE WE HEARD FROM
EXPERTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT THE WEAPONS ARE SIMPLY NOT
NEEDED. AND THEY DO HARM. THAT'S NOT ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUAL PERSON
OR POLICE OFFICER. IT IS SIMPLY THE POSSIBILITY THIS TYPE OF WEAPON
COULD BE DEPLOYED AGAINST OUR OWN RESIDENTS AND CITIZENS.
WHEN MY COLLEAGUE SPEAKS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE,
I AGREE WITH HER, WE DON'T WANT TO THINK OF THE POLICE AS A MILITARY
FORCE. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, WE NEED THEM TO DISPOSE OF THE
WEAPONS. SIMPLY POSSESSING THEM IS IN FACT BRANDING THEMSELVES AS
A MILITARY OUTFIT. AND THERE'S NO RATIONALE OR NEED FOR THAT IN THE
CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF WEAPONRY. I
LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE AMENDMENTS, BUT I HOPE MY
COLLEAGUES WILL ULTIMATELY SUPPORT THE ASK OF THIS ORDER, WHICH IS
TO GET RID OF THE WEAPONS THAT WE HAVE NO USE FOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. OFF THE TOP, I WILL SAY I DO
AGREE THAT THIS IS A CONCERN RAISED BY SOME FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY.
IT IS WORTHY OF A CONVERSATION. I HAVE SAID PUBLICLY, I TOO HAVE BEEN
QUESTIONED OR I HAVE QUESTIONED SOME OF THE INVENTORY AND WHY
WE NEED CERTAIN THINGS AND EQUIPMENT. I WAS SUPPORTIVE THE TEAR
GAS BAN, DESPITE THE FACT WE DIDN'T USE IT IN 50 YEARS AND WE DON'T
HAVE IT ON SITE. THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION THAT UNWORTHY TO HAVE.
I THINK THE ORIGINAL ORDER WAS SOMEWHAT INFLAMMATORY. THIS WAS
WORK DONE EARLY AND A PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING ON IT. I DON'T WANT TO
GET INTO A HE SAID, HE SAID ABOUT THIS. I KNOW THERE WAS NO
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ORDER WITH THE COMMISSIONER.
TO BE HONEST, I'M TIRED OF DOING BUSINESS THIS WAY.


PAGE 50

MAY 3, 2021

IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE A POLICY ORDER, IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO
FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT ONE FORWARD WHERE IT WILL GET US
SOMEWHERE. I WANTED TO TRY TO DO THAT WITH SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE.
I THINK IT IS A WORTHY CONVERSATION. I'D SAY, I WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF
I HAVE A CHILD AROUND THE SAME AGE TWO CHILDREN AROUND THE
SAME AGE AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS'S GRANDDAUGHTER. MOST PEOPLE IN
THE CITY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S INVENTORY
BECAUSE OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT THESE THINGS DON'T PARADE THE CITY
WITH EITHER THE BEARCAT OR WITH THE WEAPONS. I THINK IS AN
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. I DON'T TO OVER BLOW IT. I DON'T
WANT IT TO SOUND LIKE WE LIVE IN A MILITARIZED CITY, POLICE OFFICERS
WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND SCARING KIDS. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING
HERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THERE
WAS A PUBLIC POLICY MEETING WHERE A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE
ASKED TO COME OUT AND SPEAK TO THE ISSUES WHO HAVE A CERTAIN
POINT OF VIEW. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE CITY WHO DON'T SHARE
THAT.
THE SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE I PROPOSE, I DON'T KNOW IF THE
PROCEDURALLY, MR. CLERK, I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTS
ABOUT COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN POLICY ORDER. IF I BRING THIS OFFICIALLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THEM BOTH.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTS TO SHARE IT.
BRING IT FORWARD SO PEOPLE CAN SEE IT. IN THE POLICY ORDER, OFFERING
SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE. I WILL MAKE ONE CORRECTION IN THIS.
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN POINTED THIS OUT. IT SHOWS YOU HOW CRAZY
TIME IS THESE DAYS. THERE WAS A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MEETING
THIS. THIS WAS JULY OF 2020. WE CAN CHANGE THAT. IT BLURRED
TOGETHER. WE CAN CHANGE THAT TO JULY OF 2020. ACKNOWLEDGES
THERE'S A CONCERN IN THE COMMUNITY. ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE
WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT EXIST IN THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
IT WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSIONER HAS
ALREADY STARTED TO DO AWAY WITH SOME OF THESE WEAPONS. AND
EQUIPMENT. HE SAID HE'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO. IT ASKS FOR A REPORT
BACK AS TO WHAT HE HAS ALREADY DONE AND WHAT HE PLANS ON DOING
MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF US, RATHER
THAN SAYING JUST DO THIS.
WITHOUT ANY CONVERSATION WITH THE POLICE COMMISSIONER OR
ANYONE ELSE, LET'S DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY. GET A REPORT BACK ON
WHERE THINGS STAND. AND WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT
WE NEED AND DON'T NEED AND MAKE DECISIONS. ULTIMATELY, CITY
COUNCIL CAN'T CONTROL THIS ANYWAY. I OFFER THIS AS SUBSTITUTE
LANGUAGE. I DON'T FIND THIS SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE TO BE POINTING
FINGERS OR BLAMING ANYONE. I THINK WILL GET US TO WHERE WE WANT
TO GET TO. I THINK IT DOES SO IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. THAT IS WHAT I
PUT FORWARD.


PAGE 51

MAY 3, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. A POINT OF INFORMATION. THE
PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING THAT I THINK WE ARE ALL REFERENCING WAS
EARLIER THIS YEAR ON JANUARY 6, 2021. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT IS
GONE INTO THE ALTERNATIVE AMENDMENT. I'M TIRED OF DOING BUSINESS
THIS WAY IN THIS COUNCIL. AS THE POLICY ORDER THAT WAS ORIGINALLY
PUT IN, WE DID HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING HEARING ON THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT INVENTORY WHERE I REVIEWED THE VIDEO, YOU ARE RIGHT,
THERE ARE NO COMMITTEE MEETING NOTES, I WATCHED THE MEETING AND
I WAS SURPRISED AS I WAS THAT DAY, THERE WERE NO NEXT STEPS. AND
THERE IS NO FOLLOW UP IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS ON THIS TOPIC THAT
HAD RAISED SO MANY CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS BOTH RESIDENTS, THE
COUNCIL, ACTIVIST GROUPS. I HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION, WHY THIS POLICY
ORDER? WHY NOT JUST A FOLLOW UP PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING WITH THE
COMMISSIONER, WITH THE CITY MANAGER, WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY
COMMITTEE, TO REVIEW WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN SINCE THAT
MEETING. AS WE KNOW, AS WE SAW IN THE CAMBRIDGE CHRONICLE, THE
COMMISSIONER WORKED WITH A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST TO DECREASE THE
NUMBER OF WEAPONS BY 20%. ALREADY SAID PUBLICLY HE IS LOOKING AT
THE BEARCAT AND DECOMMISSION IT. CALLING OUR COMMISSIONER TO
HAVE A CONVERSATION AND THAT IS THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD HAPPEN. WE
SHOULD BE COMMUNICATING AS A WONDERFUL THING AND WE SHOULD BE
DOING IT MORE. AND I REALLY CANNOT STRESS IT ENOUGH. I THANK
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN FOR PUTTING IT THAT WAY. I'M TIRED OF DOING
BUSINESS THIS WAY. I THINK OUR DEPARTMENT HEADS HAVE TO BE AS WELL.
I THINK THAT POLICY ORDERS LIKE THIS MAKE FOR GREAT PRESS. MAKE FOR
GREAT TWEETS AND POSTS. THEY DON'T MAKE FOR GREAT PROGRESS THAT
PRODUCE REAL RESULTS. I THINK LIKE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SAID BEFORE
ME AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID BEFORE ME, IT DOES WARRANT A
CONTINUED CONVERSATION IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THIS POLICY
ORDER IS UNNECESSARY AND WE SHOULD RETURN IT TO THE TABLE OR VOTE
IT DOWN AND LET THE CHAIR USE THE COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE THE
CONVERSATION FOR AN UPDATE FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON THE
PROGRESS THAT IS MADE IN THIS AREA WITH THE HELP OF ACTIVIST AND
MAKE SURE RESIDENT UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE ARE
GOING. I APPRECIATE THERE IS WORK ON ALTERNATE LANGUAGE AND MAKE
IT MAKE SENSE AND NOT BE INFLAMMATORY. I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARY
AND I WELCOME AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THERE. WHERE IT
SHOULD HAPPEN IN COMMITTEE TO HAVE REAL PROGRESS THAT PRODUCES
REAL RESULTS.
SO, I'M GOING TO YIELD THE FLOOR FOR SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES TO
WEIGH IN AND COMMENT. I'M NOT INCLINE TO THE AMENDED LANGUAGE
OR THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE FOR IT BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS THE REAL
WORK OF THE COMMITTEES. IT STARTED THERE AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE
IT THERE RATHER THAN ASKING THE CITY MANAGER AND THE POLICE


PAGE 52

MAY 3, 2021

DEPARTMENT TO PUT TOGETHER A REPORT ON THEIR OWN. I WILL YIELD
BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BEFORE I GO BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, IS
THERE ANYONE ELSE FROM THE COUNCIL THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WHO
HAS WANTED SPOKEN ON THE ORIGINAL ORDER OR THE AMENDED POLICY
ORDER? COUNCILLOR NOLAN, COUNCILLOR CARLONE, AND THEN I WILL
SPEAK.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WON'T SAY MUCH, WE ALL AGREE. WE NEED TO
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH ELEMENTS OF THE POLICE INVENTORY
HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND WE'LL GET THAT WITH EITHER POLICY
ORDER. WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE WORK AND MAKE SURE WE DO IT IN A
WAY WE ARE INCLUDING ALL PLAYERS. I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS
A CHALLENGING CONVERSATION. I DO THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO
HAVE THIS IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WHERE WE CAN DISCUSS IT IN
THE FALL.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: COUNCILLOR NOLAN TOOK MY SPEECH AWAY.
SHE DID A GREAT JOB. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
ISSUE, WE ALL KNOW THAT. SOME OF THEM HAD A HISTORY THAT NONE OF
US WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. BEING HEARD AND PERCEIVED AS BEING HEARD BY
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CITY. I'M IMPRESSED WITH OUR COMMISSIONER
AND PROGRESS IS SLOW ON DIFFICULT ISSUES. I WISH IT WEREN'T. WE ALL
WISH IT WEREN'T. THE PHRASE THAT GOT ME WAS "ALL RIFLES." AS IF
TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK OR NEXT YEAR, ALL RIFLES ARE GONE. AND
THINGS DON'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT.

>> I THINK THE AMENDMENT GETS US TO THE POINT OF HAVING THE
INFORMATION AND I ENCOURAGE WE PURSUE THAT ROUTE IN THIS
DISCUSSION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE BEFORE I SPEAK? I THINK WHAT
COUNCILLOR CARLONE MENTIONED, IT WAS WHAT COMMISSIONER BARD
SPOKE ABOUT. WHEN I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS POLICY ORDER. JUST TO
CLEAR THE RECORD, THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT I AND COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN AND CITY MANAGER AND COMMISSIONER BARD HAD EARLY ON.
I THINK IT WAS BEFORE WE HEARD ABOUT THE WEAPONRY BEING REDUCED.
I DISCUSSED THIS BRIEFLY WITH COMMISSIONER BARD. HE BROUGHT UP
POINTS. FROM A DATA PERSPECTIVE, HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE RIFLES AND
SHOTGUNS. COMMISSIONER BARD SAID WE USE THEM, BUT INFREQUENTLY.
GOING BACK TO THE INTENT OF WHAT THE SUBSTANTIVE ORDER ASKED FOR,
THINKING ABOUT STATED GOAL THAT WE DO HAVE, I THINK IT IS WORTH
DISCUSSING. I WILL SAY, I UNDERSTAND WHERE EVERYBODY IS COMING
FROM. THINK WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THIS AND THAT'S WHY THIS
BODY EXISTS. IT EXISTS FOR THAT. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN YOU PROPOSED
AND SAID WHY YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING THIS UP.
WE HAVE OTHER COUNCILLORS WHO SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. AND I THINK IT IS
OUR JOB AS COLLEAGUES TO CONSIDER AND WEIGH, I THINK WHAT

PAGE 53

MAY 3, 2021

COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAS OFFERED, I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS
SPEAKERS, I THINK IT GETS TO SOME OF THE INTENT. WE'LL GO BACK TO YOU.
FOR YOU, IT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE. I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE HERE. AND SO, I'M HAPPY TO GO BACK TO YOU. I'M
ALREADY SEEING FROM THE NOD OF YOUR HEAD, YOU DON'T AGREE. WE
CAN HEAR YOU OUT AND I SUGGEST FROM WHY I HEAR FROM THE BODY, SEE
WHERE EVERYBODY IS AT, WE CONSIDER THE SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE,
PEOPLE CAN VOTE IT UP OR DOWN, WE MOVE ON ACCORDINGLY. GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I DO APPRECIATE YOU SETTING
THE RECORD STRAIGHT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M A LITTLE UPSET BY THE WAY
MY COLLEAGUES ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS EFFORT. SOME OF MY
COLLEAGUES, IT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE
FOR OVER A YEAR. AND WE HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE, I HAVE BEEN
MEETING WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS REGULARLY AND REPEATEDLY. I
BROUGHT THE MAYOR IN ON THE CONVERSATION. SHE SPOKE AT MEETINGS
WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND THE CITY MANAGER. SIMPLY NOT TRUE.
SIMPLY NOT TRUE THAT NOTHING HAPPENED BETWEEN THE PUBLIC SAFETY
COMMITTEE MEETING AND NOW.
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE WHERE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE COMING
FROM, WHERE THE AMENDMENT IS COMING FROM, THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS IT
DOESN'T GET THE JOB DONE. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE INVENTORY IS.
WE JUST NEED TO GET RID OF IT. AND MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT AND
HAVING ANOTHER PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE HEARING, IT WON'T
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING. THE MANAGER AND THE COMMISSIONER HAVE
MADE IT CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF THE WEAPONS. IT IS OUR
JOB AS THE COUNCIL TO MAKE OUR POSITION CLEAR. EITHER WE WANT
THEM TO GET RID OF IT OR WE'RE OKAY WITH THEM HAVING IT. THE BODY
WANTS TO VOTE THAT WE SHOULD KEEP THE STUFF AROUND, THAT'S YOUR
BUSINESS.
I CANNOT SUPPORT THAT. THE ASK OF THE ORIGINAL ORDER IS TO GET RID
OF THE WEAPONS AND THAT REMAINS MY ASK AND THIS SUBSTITUTE
AMENDMENT SIMPLY DOESN'T GET THAT JOB DONE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AGAIN, THE ORDER ASKS FOR A PLAN AND I THINK
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S ORDER ASKS FOR A PLAN. I THINK WE CAN GO
ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS. I DON'T WANT TO AND THE TIME WE ARE
ALMOST AT 9:00. WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT. SUBSTITUTE ORDER BEFORE
US, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. GOING BACK TO YOU. ENTERTAIN THE
MOTION FROM YOU TO VOTE THE AMENDMENTS UP OR DOWN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY QUICKLY, I KNOW
HOW THIS IS GOING TO GET RESPONDED TO FROM THE MEDIA, I'M NOT
SAYING IT IS AN UNIMPORTANT CONVERSATION. I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION. I WANT TO DO IT IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY. I DON'T WANT
PEOPLE SPINNING THIS. I OFFER MY SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE. VICE MAYOR
MALLON MENTIONED I WILL GO THROUGH YOU TO ASK HER, THIS IS A
CONVERSATION SHE FEELS SHOULD HAPPEN IN COMMITTEE. IN MY
SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE, I ASK FOR THE REPORT TO COME BACK TO THE CITY

PAGE 54

MAY 3, 2021

COUNCIL. IF SHE PREFERS ME TO CHANGE THAT OR MADE TO COME BACK TO
THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE, SHE FEELS THAT'S A BETTER PLACE TO HAVE
THE CONVERSATION, I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THAT CHANGE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I THINK THAT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION BECAUSE
THAT ALLOWS US FOR TWO HOURS TO BE DEBATING THE MERITS OF THE
REPORT AND HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED, RATHER THAN ON A MONDAY
NIGHT AT 9:00 AT NIGHT WITH OTHER BUSINESS IN FRONT OF US. I THINK
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THAT IN THE PAST, WE
HAVE ALWAYS SAID IT IS REALLY NOT NECESSARY TO PUT THAT IN THE ORDER.
THE ORDER CAN ASK FOR A REPORT FROM THE MANAGER AND IF AND WHEN
THAT REPORT MATERIALIZES, THE COUNCIL CAN REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE.
IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, I AM HAPPY TO HOLD A HEARING AS THE CHAIR. I
DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO PUT THAT IN THE ORDER. THE REPORT CAN
COME BACK TO THE COUNCIL AND FORWARD TO THE COMMITTEE.
>> MR. CLERK: IF I MAY, AS AN FYI, IF THE SUBSTITUTE ORDER OR THE
ORIGINAL ORDER IS PASSED, IT WILL GO ON AWAITING REPORT LIST, WHAT
HAPPENS THE CITY MANAGER RESPOND TO THE CITY COUNCIL, COME OFF
THE LIST AND REFERRED TO WHEREVER IT NEED THE TO GO.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE TO BE ASKED WE GET
THE REPORT BACK, IT GOES BACK TO MY COMMITTEE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT
THE CLERK IS SAYING, TO ADD THAT LANGUAGE, IT IS NOT IMPROPER FORM.
JUST SAYING WHERE WE WANT IT TO GO WHEN IT COMES BACK. THAT'S
WHAT I BELIEVE. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE CLERK.
>> MR. CLERK: YOU ARE CORRECT. THEY CAN PUT LANGUAGE TO REFER TO
WHATEVER COMMITTEE THE COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT TO. IT WON'T
COME OFF THE LIST UNTIL IF IT GOES TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE, IT
WOULDN'T COME OFF THE WAITING REPORT LIST UNTIL IT GOT BACK TO THE
CITY COUNCIL.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE WAITING REPORT
LIST. IF IT GOES STRAIGHT TO PUBLIC SAFETY, IT IS FASTER OPPOSED BACK TO
THE COUNCIL. IT WILL WAIT AND REFER IT BACK. I WILL AMEND MY POLICY
ORDER. IN THE ORDERED SECTION. THE REPORT GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC
SAFETY COMMITTEE. REMOVE CITY COUNCIL AND PUBLIC SAFETY
COMMITTEE.
>> MR. CLERK: MOVE FORWARD ON THE VOTE?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WANT TO IN THE ORDERED SECTION, TAKE
OUT CITY COUNCIL. AND PUT PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. REPORT BACK TO
THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU HAVE THAT.
>> MR. CLERK: ONE CLARIFYING QUESTION. YOU WANT TO MAKE AN
AMENDMENT ABOUT THE DATE OF THE MEETING YOU REFERRED TO.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: WE DON'T HAVE TO. VICE MAYOR MALLON

MAY 3, 2021

POINTED OUT THAT COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN WAS TALKING ABOUT AN
EARLIER PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MEETING. IT OCCURRED IN JULY OF
2020, ACCORDING TO VICE MAYOR MALLON, THE PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING
ABOUT THE INVENTORY WAS PRESENTED WAS IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. MY
REPORT SAYS EARLIER THIS YEAR, IF THAT IS THE CASE WE CAN SAY EARLIER
THIS TERM. IT WILL DOVER BOTH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CHANGE IT TO EARLIER THIS TERM TO COVER OUR
BASIS.
>> MR. CLERK: RIGHT NOW THE ORDERED PARAGRAPH THE CITY MANAGER IS
REQUESTED TO WORK WITH THE POLICE COMMISSIONER AND REPORT BACK
TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ON STEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS THIS
CONCERN AND ISSUING STATUS REPORT ON HOW THEY MOVE FORWARD
WITH REDUCING WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT VIEWED UNNECESSARY...
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.

Motion to adopt Calendar Item
#2 as amended.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: POINT OF INFORMATION. VOTING ON
THIS AMENDMENT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THIS IS THE ORIGINAL ORDER. IT IS EDITED. WE ARE
MOVING FORWARD WITH WHAT IS BEFORE US. SUBSTITUTED ORDER. THAT'S
ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: THE ROLL CALL VOTE IS TO AMEND THE ORIGINAL POLICY
ORDER BY SUBSTITUTION WITH THIS LANGUAGE FROM COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, INCLUDES A REFERENCE SENDING
THE RESPONSE FROM THE CITY MANAGER DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY
COMMITTEE. ON THE MOTION:

That the City Manager is
hereby requested to work with
the Police Commissioner and
report back to the Public Safety
Committee on steps taken to
address this concern and issue
a status report on how the City
is moving forward with
reducing weapons and
equipment deemed unnecessary
by the Cambridge Police
Department

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: MOTION PASSES, SEVEN IN FAVOR AND TWO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK? EVERYTHING COVERED?
>> MR. CLERK: THE POLICY ORDER IS AMENDED. NEXT VOTE UNLESS THERE
ARE MORE AMENDMENTS. VOTE TO ADOPT THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER AMENDMENTS?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THE ORDER NOW NO LONGER


PAGE 56

MAY 3, 2021

MENTIONS THE BEARCAT, WHICH TYPICALLY IS NOT A WEAPON. I DON'T
KNOW IF WE NEED TO PUT THAT BACK IN THERE SO IT IS CLEAR WE TALK
ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: CAN YOU THROW IT UP. I DID TALK ABOUT
WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: IT DOES SAY THAT, BUT EQUIPMENT IS A
BROAD TERM.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I CONQUER, IT IS MORE BROAD THAN THE
EARLIER ORDER. IT SPECIFIES THE BEARCAT. I DON'T THINK THE
COMMISSIONER IS UNDER A ROCK. HE HEARS THE CONVERSATION AND
KNOWS THE INTENTIONALITY. I THINK HE WILL BE THOROUGH. I HOPE MY
COLLEAGUES CONQUER. WE HAVE A VERY ABLE COMMISSIONER. HE SAT
THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEETINGS, GOOD, BAD, AND INDIFFERENT. HE
UNDERSTANDS THE INTENTION OF THE ORDER. I THINK LEAVE IT AS IT. LET
US VOTE IT. MOVE ON THE OTHER ORDERS OF BUSINESS. I RESPECTFULLY
ASK COLLEAGUES TO GO FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE ORDER AS AMENDED.
LET US GET OUR REPORT BACK AND GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S
SUBCOMMITTEE. NOT SUBCOMMITTEE. COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL ON
PUBLIC SAFETY. WE CAN FURTHER DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE. I THINK THE ORDER
IS IN PROPER FORM AND RESPECTFULLY ASK US TO VOTE AND MOVE ON TO
THE OTHER IMPORTANT ITEMS. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: POINT OF ORDER. I ASKED IF IT WOULD BE IN
ORDER TO AMEND THAT BACK IN. IF THE ANSWER IS YES, I'D LIKE TO PUT
FORWARD THAT AMENDMENT. IF THE ANSWER IS NO, WE CANNOT. IF WE
CAN HAVE AN ANSWER FROM THE CLERK IF IT IS IN ORDER TO PUT THAT
AMENDMENT IN?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK?
>> MR. CLERK: ONE SECOND. I'M PULLING UP THE OLD LANGUAGE. OLD
LANGUAGE REFERENCED... WE TALK ABOUT THE ORDERED PARAGRAPH.
LANGUAGE THAT WAS AMENDED, ELIMINATION OF THE BEARCAT... TO
REINSERT THAT LANGUAGE, SUCH AN ORDER WOULD BE OUT OF ORDER
UNDER ROBERT'S RULE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PROCEED TO VOTE ON THE ORDER AS AMENDED.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: EIGHT IN FAVOR AND ONE AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO ITEMS ON THE TABLE. FOUR AND FIVE.
WE HAVE TO DO A ROLL CALL TO PULL THEM OFF THE TABLE. CLERK?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) TAKE FROM THE TABLE
CALENDAR ITEMS 4 AND 5. (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: 4 AND IN REGARDS TO THE POLICY ORDER REQUESTING
BUDGET FOR OUTSIDE LEGAL RESEARCH AND THEN FIVE IS A
COMMUNICATION THAT WAS FROM CITY SOLICITOR GLOWA ABOUT A LEGAL
OPINION. COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

Motion to take Calendar Item
#4 and Calenda Item #5 from
the table.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO
COSPONSORS AND DISCUSSION ON THE LINE ITEM FOR LEGAL RESEARCH
FROM THE CITY COUNCIL BUDGET PREDATES MY TIME. IT WAS DISCUSSED
LAST TERM AND PREVIOUS TERMS. I'M HAPPY TO SPONSOR THIS POLICY
ORDER TO MOVE IT FORWARD WITH THE THREE COSPONSORS. THIS POLICY
ORDER HELP TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR
COUNCILLORS WORKING WITH OUTSIDE LAWYERS. RIGHT NOW, EACH ONE
CONSULTS WITH OUTSIDE EXPERTS ON THEIR OWN. THE CITY COUNCIL CAN
HELP FORMALIZE THIS AS PART OF THE RULES AND CREATE STEPS FOR
TRANSPARENCY. LIKE WE DO WITH THE MEETINGS FOR EACH TERM.
INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND HELP US CARRY OUT DUTIES TO PASS LAWS
AS LAID OUT IN THE CHARTER. IT STATES CLEARLY THE CITY COUNCIL SHALL
HAVE AND EXERCISE ALL THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE CITY. IT MAKES
SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT TO HAVE
ACCESS TO SEPARATE LEGAL ADVICE THAN THE LAWYERS TO THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCH AND THE CITY MANAGER. THE CITIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS, THE
COUNCILS THAT HAVE DONE VARIATIONS ON HAVING A BUDGET FOR LEGAL
ADVICE, INCLUDING FALL RIVER, METHUEN, ET CETERA. THE LEGISLATIVE
BRANCH SHOULD HAVE SEPARATE ACCESS TO LEGAL ADVICE. THE CHARTER IS
CLEAR THE CITY COUNCIL HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE REQUEST AND THE
COUNCILLORS WON'T GO TO JAIL FOR MAKING A BUDGET REQUEST. IT IS
CLEAR. AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT THAT WE PASSED LAST
WEEK, THE CITY MANAGER IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE THE BUDGET REQUEST
CHANGES, THE COUNCIL HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE BUDGET.
I APPRECIATE THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE LAST WEEK. I WANT TO
BE CLEAR, I'M HAPPY AND WILLING TO LISTEN TO THEIR OPINION AND
ADVICE. I THINK THE MEMO AND RESPONSE HELPED ME MAKE THE CASE FOR
THIS. THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT SAYS THE COUNCIL CAN FACE JAIL TIME, WE
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL ADVICE. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING
TO WORK WITH THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT. THE PROCESS THEY OUTLINED IN
THE MEMO OF HAVING LAWYERS WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE COUNCIL
WHEN WE SEEK ORDINANCE, IT IS AN APPROACH. IT WAS AN APPROACH IN
2019, IT WASN'T IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT
PROCESS BEING IMPLEMENTED GOING FORWARD. AND I THINK IT WILL HELP

PAGE 58

MAY 3, 2021

US OVERCOME ISSUES. THAT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE POLICY ORDER.
AND THE CITY COUNCIL HAVING ITS OWN BUDGET FOR LEGAL RESEARCH,
INCLUDING FOR RESTAURANTS HAVING ACOUSTIC MUSIC WITHOUT A
PERMIT. PASSING A TEAR GAS BAN. THEY ARE ALL ISSUES WE STRUGGLE
WITH. I HOPE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD THIS PASSING THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON AND THEN COUNCILLOR
CARLONE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE A FEW
EXTRA WEEKS TO HASH OUT AND THINK ABOUT THIS POLICY AND WHAT IT
MEANS. GIVEN THAT ADDITIONAL TIME, WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT TO
HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS WAS CRITICAL. I APPRECIATE THE MEMO FROM
LAST WEEK AND WHERE THERE IS CONFUSION IN THE COMMUNITY WHETHER
OR NOT WE CAN GO TO JAIL TONIGHT FOR PASSING THIS POLICY ORDER, WAS
REFERENCED IS SECTION 107, NEITHER THE CITY COUNCIL NOR ANY OF THE
COMMITTEES SHALL DIRECT OR REQUEST THE APPOINTMENT OF ANY PERSON
TO OR REMOVAL FROM OFFICE BY THE CITY MANAGER OR THE
SUBORDINATES OR TAKE PART IN THE APPOINTMENT OR REMOVAL OF
OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES IN THAT PORTION OF THE SERVICE OF SAID CITY FOR
WHOSE ADMINISTRATION THE CITY MANAGER IS RESPONSIBLE. THAT IS NOT
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR OR WHAT THE POLICY ORDER IS ASKING FOR.
WHAT IT IS ASKING FOR, WE ASK ALL THE TIME FOR NEW POSITIONS TO BE
CONSIDERED AS WELL AS ADVOCATE I ASK WE HIRE CONSULTANT FOR THE
CAMBRIDGE STREET BIKE LANES AND ASK THE CITY MANAGER HIRE A
DIRECTOR OF CULTURAL PLANNING. BOTH WERE APPROVED BY THE CITY
COUNCIL AND BOTH HAPPENED. THIS PART SEEMS TO INDICATE I CAN'T OR
WE CAN'T SAY THAT MR. SMITH, THE FINANCE DIRECTOR NEEDS TO BE FIRED
OR A SPECIFIC PERSON SHOULD BE HIRED. A CHARTER SHOULD SPECIFY THAT
VERY CLEARLY.
WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE, LIKE THE CONSENSUS BUILDING INSTITUTE
CONSULTANT WHO WAS BROUGHT IN IS A REGULAR BUDGET FOR THE CITY
COUNCIL TO ACCESS OUTSIDE LEGAL RESEARCH HELP. AS MENTIONED IN THE
POLICY ORDER, A FEW CITIES AND TOWNS HAVE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR.
FALL RIVER, METHUEN, ET CETERA, HAVE DONE THIS. THEY CAN REPORT
BACK TO THE COUNCIL, WHICH IS THE PROCEDURE. AND WE CAN HAVE A
LONGER CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. I WANT TO THANK YOU THE POLICY
MAKERS FOR THIS AND DIVING INTO AN ISSUE THAT WE REALLY HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME. I THINK IT WILL REALLY HELP US AS THE
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH BRING FORWARD ORDINANCES THAT WILL HELP MAKE
PROGRESS IN THE CITY. I WILL VOTE FOR THIS. I APPRECIATE THE LAW
DEPARTMENT AND THE POLICY ORDER MAKERS COMING TOGETHER AND
HAVING CONVERSATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS NOT A CONSENSUS OR
AGREEMENT, I THINK IT IS A WORTHY THING FOR US TO DO TONIGHT. I'M
VERY HAPPY TO VOTE YES. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE BOTH MY FELLOW
COUNCILLOR AND VICE MAYOR MALLON'S COMMENTS. I WANTED VERY


PAGE 59

MAY 3, 2021

MUCH FOR US TO READ IN DETAIL WHAT THE SOLICITOR SENT US. IT
CERTAINLY SEEMED LIKE A WORKABLE PROGRAM. I WILL ALSO VOTE FOR THE
POLICY ORDER TONIGHT. AND IF THIS PUTS A LITTLE MORE FIRE UNDER ALL
OF US TO MAKE WHAT THE SOLICITOR HAS PROPOSED IN THE SHORT TERM,
I'LL ALL FOR IT SO WE DON'T NEED TO DO WHAT IS PROPOSED.
GIVEN WHAT COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER BROUGHT UP ABOUT 2019,
THE DISCUSSION AND NOTHING SEEMED TO CHANGE, THAT CONVINCE WE
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND HOPE WE CAN WORK OUT SOMETHING
QUICKLY. I WILL VOTE FOR AND I THANK MY FELLOW COUNCILLORS FOR
THEIR THOUGHTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN COUNCILLOR
NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I THINK WITH THE CHANGES IN
THE POLICY ORDER ASKING FOR THE CITY MANAGER TO REPORT BACK TO US, I
THINK WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME. I WILL SUPPORT THAT. I WANT TO SAY A
COUPLE OF THINGS. I'M SPEAKING ONLY FOR MYSELF. I DIDN'T FEEL
THREATENED WITH JAIL TIME. I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE
CITY SOLICITOR TO THREATEN US. I THOUGHT IT GOT WAY OVERBLOWN IN
THE MEDIA. AND I MADE A JOKE ABOUT IT WHEN IT GOT TO ME. I WANT TO
SAY THAT PUBLICLY. I THINK THE CITY SOLICITOR HAD WAS TRYING TO
INTIMIDATE US. THAT'S THE WAY I FELT. OTHERS MAY FEEL DIFFERENTLY
AND I RESPECT THEIR FEELINGS. I NEED TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I
FEEL.
I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WANTING TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD
AND TALK ABOUT HAVING THE COUNCIL BEING ABLE TO GET LEGAL ADVICE, I
FELT THIS WAY ON THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE, TOO. COUNCILLOR NOLAN
WILL REMEMBER THE CONVERSATIONS. I THINK IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT, I DO
BELIEVE THE LAW OFFICE DOES THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST TO WALK THE LINE
BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNCIL WHEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES. NINE
TIMES OUT OF TEN, THERE ARE NOT DIFFERENCES. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
THE COUNCIL WANTS TO DO SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THE CITY DOESN'T
WANT TO DO. I CAN IMAGINE THAT'S A HORRIBLE PLACE TO BE SITTING
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OF THE PEOPLE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT
ARGUING OVER WANTING TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS. I HAVE QUESTION AS
TO HOW THIS WOULD WORK PROGRAMMATICALLY. I BROUGHT THEM UP
LAST TIME. THE COUNCIL GETS LEGAL ADVICE FROM SOMEONE OUTSIDE.
THE CITY SOLICITOR HAS A DIFFERENT LEGAL OPINION. HOW DOES THAT
WORK? WHAT HAPPENS IF THE COUNCIL PASSES SOMETHING THAT THE
ATTORNEY THAT HAD WORKED WITH THE COUNCILLOR SAID IT IS OKAY AND
THE CITY SOLICITOR SAYS IT IS NOT OKAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WILL
WORK OUT. I THINK IT IS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT TAKE LONGER THAN WE
WANT TO GET DONE. I HAVE OFTEN SAID TO THE CITY MANAGER, THE
TIMELINE FOR COUNCILLORS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE TIMELINE FOR THE CITY.
WE ARE HERE FOR TWO YEARS. WE WANT TO GET SOMETHING DONE. THE
TIMELINE FOR THE CITY IS LONGER. WE PUSH TO GET THINGS DONE AND

PAGE 60

MAY 3, 2021

THAT'S A TENSION. WE HAVE PUT A LOT ON THE CITY DEPARTMENTS.
INCLUDING THE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE. WHETHER I HAVE ALWAYS AGREED
WITH HER DECISIONS AND I HAVE BEEN VOCAL WHEN I HAVEN'T AND I HAVE
BEEN VOCAL ABOUT FRUSTRATIONS I HAD, I'M NOT SUPPORTING THIS
BECAUSE I FEEL THE CITY SOLICITOR ISN'T WORKING HARD ENOUGH. I THINK
THEY ARE WORKING HARD. IF WE CAN CRAFT THIS IN A WAY THAT IS
PRODUCTIVE THEN HAVING A BUDGET FOR SOME OUTSIDE LEGAL ADVICE
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COUNCIL WHEN WE FEEL WE NEED IT. I APPRECIATE
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER IN THIS BECAUSE I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE SENT US EMAILS SAYING... PROVIDE WE CAN DO THIS, THE ASK
SHOULDN'T COME BEFORE THE SOLE CITY COUNCIL. EACH COUNCILLOR
SHOULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. THAT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE AND A
MESS. I'M GLAD THE ORDER SAYS IF THE WHOLE COUNCIL HAS TO AGREE TO
DO SOMETHING. I THINK IT WILL GO A LONG WAY IN PROTECTING ABUSES.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL THIS ORDER NOW IS ASKING FOR THE CITY
MANAGER TO COME BACK TO US WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON THIS. MY GUESS IS
WE'LL HEAR WHAT WE HAVE HEARD ALREADY IN THE OPINION THAT WAS
BEFORE US LAST WEEK. I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR FURTHER
CONVERSATION. I DO THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO THINK
ABOUT. IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN MAYBE SOME THINK. I WILL VOTE
TO FORWARD THE CONVERSATION. NOT BECAUSE I THINK THAT EVEN IF I
DISAGREE WITH SOME THINGS THE CITY SOLICITOR AND THE LAW OFFICE
CONCLUDED, IT IS NOT BECAUSE I FEEL THEY ARE DOING AN INADEQUATE JOB
OR SLACKING. THEY WORK HARD AND WE DEMAND A LOT. I APPRECIATE THE
WORK THEY DO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WON'T REPEAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID.
I WILL SUPPORT THIS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON
THINGS THAT WE OFTEN SAY WE NEED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS TALKED
ABOUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. IT WAS DIRECTLY ADDRESSED BY PRIOR
COUNCILS. AND NOW IT IS TIME, I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE MOTION MAKERS
TO BRING THIS FORWARD. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S LOGISTICS TO WORK OUT.
COMPLICATIONS TO UNDERSTAND. AND A QUESTION OF HOW IT IS THIS IS
ALLOCATED. YET, IT DOES SEEM GOOD GOVERNANCE AND PRUDENT USE OF
RESOURCES FOR THE COUNCIL TO HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL RESEARCH. AS
WAS MADE CLEAR BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND OTHER MOTION
MAKERS, COSPONSORS, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD SUBSTITUTE
FOR THE LEGAL OPINION OF THE CITY. THIS IS SOMETHING TO PROVIDE
SOME LEGAL BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH FOR THE COUNCIL AS THE WHOLE
FOR US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING
THIS. I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. AND HOPE WE CAN ALL
COME TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THIS IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THE ENTIRE CITY FOR US TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS RESOURCE, WHICH WILL
ALLOW US TO DO OUR JOBS, I BELIEVE, IN A BETTER FASHION.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. AS I SAID, I


PAGE 61

MAY 3, 2021

APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE FROM THE SOLICITOR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING ON THAT AND WORKING WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT IN THE WAY
SHE PROPOSES. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE S THE ORDER ASKS FOR
SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO THAT. IT IS GETTING ADVICE EARLY ON IN THE
PROCESS. WHERE WE NEED OUTSIDE HELP. I WILL VOTE FOR THE ORDER AS
WELL. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I'M GLAD TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL TIME. I'M
PLEASED AT MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORTED THE MOTION TO LAY IT ON THE
TABLE SO WE HAD TIME TO READ THE SOLICITOR'S LETTER AND THINK IT
THROUGH AND ASK QUESTIONS. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO A
FORMER CITY MANAGER OF A PLAN E CHARTER TOWN. BASED ON THE
SOLICITOR'S LETTER AND HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THIS
PERSON, IT REITERATED WHAT I BELIEVE LAST WEEK. I BELIEVE, THE READ
THE CHARTER DIFFERENTLY. I BELIEVE THE CITY COUNCIL CANNOT THIS
FEELS LIKE A HIRE TO ME AND IT FEELS LIKE THE SOLICITOR GIVES AN
OPINION WE DON'T WANT, SO WE HIRE SOMEONE WHO WILL GIVE US THE
OPINION THAT WE WANT. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS.
AND I THINK IT PUTS THE ADMINISTRATION, THE CITY, ALL OF US IN A VERY
PECULIAR SITUATION WHERE WE GET OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL. IT WILL TELL
US ONE THING, IT IS LITIGATED AND WE HAVE TO LITIGATE AGAINST
OURSELVES. IT WILL PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION, I THINK, IT IS
SOMEWHAT INDEFENSIBLE. I BELIEVE THE CITY SOLICITOR HAS DONE
YEOMAN'S WORK AT LAYING OUT OTHER ALTERNATIVES OF HOW WE COULD
IF PEOPLE FEEL THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH LEGAL SUPPORT OR NEED MORE
LEGAL SUPPORT, THE SOLICITOR LAID OUT BEFORE US THE WAYS WE CAN GET
IT, I WOULD BE MORE THAN INCLINED TO VOTE FOR MORE SUPPORT TAKING
MONEY OUT ASKING THE CITY MANAGER TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS
FOR ADDITIONAL HIRES AS SOLICITOR GLOWA LAID OUT IN HER LETTER. I
DON'T THINK IT IS A BOTH/AND. IF THE COUNCIL BELIEVES WE DON'T HAVE
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES, LEGAL RESOURCES, THEN WE PUT MORE MONEY
INTO THE BUDGET TO PROVIDE FOR THAT.
I ALSO BELIEVE WHAT IS SOLICITOR GLOWA SAID, IF WE HIRE OUTSIDE ROLL
REPRESENTATION, THAT REPRESENTATION STILL HAS TO WORK FOR AND
WITH THE SOLICITOR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE GAINED. I TRULY
BELIEVE THIS IS NOT PROPER FORM. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR THIS. I'M
TROUBLED THAT WE USE THE TIME OF THE SOLICITOR AND THE CITY
MANAGER TO COME BACK WITH WHAT I SUSPECT WILL BE AN ANSWER THAT
IS NOT PROPER. I APPRECIATE THAT INDIVIDUALS ON THE COUNCIL FEEL MAY
THEY NOT HAVE PROPER REPRESENTATION AND NOT BEING ATTORNEYS,
THEY WANT MORE. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WE WERE GOING TO JAIL FOR
HIRING OUTSIDE LEGAL HELP. I THINK THAT WAS A LITTLE DEMONSTRATIVE
ON SOMEONE'S PART. I WILL NOT DEBATE THAT BEHAVIOR. THAT'S AN
INDIVIDUAL WAYS IF THEY WANT TO PERFORM, THAT'S HOW THEY WANT TO
PERFORM.
WITH THAT SAID, I WON'T SUPPORT THIS ORDER. I BELIEVE IT IS IN VIOLATION
OF THE CHARTER. I THINK IT IS VERY CLEAR. I SUGGEST MY COLLEAGUES


PAGE 62

MAY 3, 2021

THINK DIFFERENTLY. I'LL BE SURPRISED IF THE CITY MANAGER CAME BACK
AND SAID GO HIRE WHOEVER, IF THAT IS THE WAY THE VOTE GOES. THE
VOTE GOES THAT WAY, I WON'T BE A PART OF IT. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY
COLLEAGUE, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I DO THINK THIS POLICY ORDER IS
GOING TO OPEN UP A HONEST'S NEST AND I SAY BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU
WISH FOR. I'M SURE IT WILL BE PASS. I THINK IT IS A VERY, VERY BAD POLICY
ORDER AND I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK EVERYBODY HAS SPOKEN. I RECOGNIZE THAT
THE CITY SOLICITOR CITY MANAGER SAYS THIS A LOT, I WILL SAY IT HERE,
CITY SOLICITOR EATS, SLEEPS, AND DRINKS PROTECTING THE CITY AND THE
COUNCIL. AND I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAS SAID ON A
LOT OF POINTS. I HAVE REACHED OUT TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER
TO AMEND SPECIFICALLY THAT LANGUAGE THAT I THINK WAS THE MOST
PROBLEMATIC. I WISH I CAUGHT THAT IN THE BEGINNING SO IT WAS
FRAMED AS A REQUEST. NORMALLY, WHEN THERE'S A REQUEST, USUALLY
YOU HAVE MANY POLICY ORDERS WAITING TO COME BACK AND SAY LEGALLY
X. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK PASSING THIS TONIGHT WILL GET THE
AS IS PAST PRACTICE, AN ORDER REPORTING BACK ON IT. THAT IS THE MAIN
INTENT FOR ME AS THE COSPONSOR. I CAN SAY WHAT COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER OR COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN OR COUNCILLOR
CARLONE ARE THINKING. THAT WAS MY GOAL.
I WANTED TO GET THAT ON THE FLOOR. I AGREE AND APPRECIATE THE
PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. AS I SAID, WE'LL GET RESPONSE THAT PROBABLY
COVERS SOME OF THE SOLUTION AND I'LL BE FINE WITH IT. THAT'S ALL I WILL
SAY. CLERK, WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE BODY. I SUGGEST WE MOVE TO THE
ROLL CALL SO WE CAN VOTE THIS UP OR DOWN.

TO CDD ABOUT THIS PETITION. SUGGESTING THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME
CLARITY ON TWO THINGS. DEFINITION OF BIOSOLAR. AND THE DEFINITION
PROPOSED IS ONE THAT IS USED IN THE VARIOUS DOCUMENTS ABOUT
BISOLAR. IT WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM IS THE
IDEA. THE OTHER AMENDMENT, WHEN WE PROPOSE AND PASSED AN
AMENDMENT LIMITING THIS TO IT IS ALREADY LIMITED TO ONLY NEW
CONSTRUCTION, ONLY NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT IS 25,000 SQUARE FEET OR
MORE. THERE WAS A PROPOSAL THAT PASSED THAT SAID, GREEN ROOFS
WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED ON COMMERCIAL OR LAB BUILDINGS WITH A
MAJORITY OF SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT DEDICATED TO HOUSING. CDD
SUGGESTED THAT IS CHALLENGING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT APPLIES TO.
THE TABLE OF USES SHOULD BE TIED TO THIS ORDINANCE. I MET WITH MR.
ROBERTS AND DIRECTOR FAROOQ, DIRECTED ME TO THE TABLE OF USES. WE
TALKED ABOUT THAT TABLE OF USES AND THEY PROPOSE THE BEST WAY TO
INTEGRATE THE LANGUAGE BASED ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND MY
UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTENT OF THAT AMENDMENT OF THE
COMMERCIAL OR LAB USES WAS TO PUT IN A NEW SECTION. TAKE OUT THE
REFERENCE TO THAT COMMERCIAL AND LAB BUILDINGS. IT IS HIGHLIGHTED
AS TAKEN OUT. WE HAVE DOUBLE DID IT. I WASN'T SURE IT WOULD BE
THERE. AND NEW SECTION SPECIFIES WHAT THE PARTS OF THE TABLE OF
USES WOULD APPLY IN THE SITUATION TO HAVING A GREEN ROOF
REQUIREMENT.

Calendar Item #4 adopted
That the City Council shall
have its own budget for outside
legal research to be utilized at
the discretion of the Council
when designated by a majority
of members in pursuance of the
Council’s authority to exercise
the legislative powers of the
City as specified in the City
charter. TABLED IN
COUNCIL APRIL 26, 2021

AFFORDABLE HOUSING 100% IS EXEMPTED ENTIRELY. WE PUT IN TO
HIGHLIGHT THIS, IT SAYS, IN THE REFERENCE ON THIS, EXCLUDING ANY
MUNICIPAL BUILDING. WHILE SOME OF US THOUGHT AND I BELIEVE EVERY
SINGLE BUILD COULD BENEFIT FROM A GREEN ROOF, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
I WOULD APPLY IT TO EVERY SINGLE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IT
EXCLUDES MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS WITH THE IDEA OUR MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS
ARE GOING TO BE NET ZERO, IT WILL MAKE IT CLEAR SOMETHING LIKE THE
TOBIN BUILDING IN PROCESS IS NOT GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO MEET WITH
THIS. IF THAT MAKES SENSE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DISCUSSION BEFORE US AND THE PETITION ITSELF.
COUNCILLOR CARLONE, VICE MAYOR MALLON, AND THEN COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN.

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THERE WERE NO OTHER
CHANGES PROPOSED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS THE CASE,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO PROPOSE.
IF PEOPLE DO...
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WANT TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T MISS IT. WHEN
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, DPW, THEY LOOK AT PROJECTS, THEY EVALUATE
WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED AND DISCUSS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND WHETHER
SOMETHING MAKES SENSE. MAKES SENSE FROM A DESIGN POINT OF VIEW
OR ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, BUILDING ROOF IS
GOING TO BE IN SHADE, MOST OF THE DAY, BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE
BUILDING TO THE SOUTH, THEY HOPEFULLY WOULD PROPOSE A VEGETATIVE
ROOF OVER SOLAR. CONVERSELY, IF IT IS A SITE THAT IS HEAVILY IN THE SUN,
I HOPE THEY WOULD MORE SERIOUSLY CONSIDER SOLAR. THAT'S HOW I
VIEW WHERE WE ARE. IT IS NOT IT'S THE CITY WORKING WITH THE
DEVELOPMENT TEAM EVALUATING WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT BUILDING AND
THAT LOCATION.
I HOPE THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THIS. THE REASON I SAY THAT
I HAVE BECOME MORE AWARE OF HOW LITTLE NATURE WE HAVE IN THE
CITY. I TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST WEEK SO I WON'T REPEAT IT. SOME
NEIGHBORHOOD S ARE ABYSMAL. OUR CITY IS HALF OF WHAT THE AVERAGE
CITY HAS, SOME NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE THE ROCK BOTTOM OF MINIMUM. I
WOULD HOPE THE CITY WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS INFORMATION TO
EVALUATE WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE. IN MY OWN HEAD, GIVEN ALL
THE NEGATIVES WE HEARD, BISOLAR SEEMS TO BE RIGHT COMBINATION.
SOMEONE TOLD US, YOU CAN GET SOLAR FROM OUT OF THE CITY, YOU CAN'T
GET NATURE FROM OUT OF THE CITY. I THINK THE ORIGINAL I WILL VOTE
YES. I THINK THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT ADDING OPEN SPACE IN KENDALL SQUARE AND WE ARE
LEARNING THAT AT LEAST FOR BOSTON PROPERTIES, ENTIRELY PAVED WITH
SOME TREES AND PLANTING BEDS, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT. WE HAVE VERY LOW PERCENTAGES OF REQUIRED OPEN SPACE AND
ALEWIFE AND OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE WILL BE DEVELOPMENT. THE
ROOF IS THE KEY.
I KNOW IN THE FUTURE, IT'LL BE THAT WAY. FUTURE COUNCILS WILL GO FOR
GREEN ROOFS THAT ARE PRIMARILY NATURE ORIENTED. THANK YOU. THAT'S
ALL I WANT TO ADD.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WILL RESPOND AND SPEAK ABOUT
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE MADE. COMMENTS
AROUND THIS ORDINANCE AND ALLOWING THEM TO EVALUATE WHAT IS
BEST FOR THE SITUATION AND IF IS A SUNNY SITUATION, JUT SOLAR AND A
SHADIER SITUATION, A VEGETATIVE ROOF AND HAVING AND ALLOWING THAT
FLEXIBILITY AND EVALUATING WHAT IS BEST FOR A SITUATION IS UP TO CDD
AND THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM. THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW
THIS ORDINANCE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE


PAGE 65

MAY 3, 2021

PUT FORWARD BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
THE AMENDMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND THEM, THEY ARE THAT YOU CAN HAVE
A VEGETATIVE ROOF, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE SOLAR ON TOP OF A VEGETATIVE
ROOF. NO ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE JUST SOLAR IN ONE AREA AND JUST
VEGETATIVE IN THE OTHER AREAS. AND BOTH IN SOME OTHER AREAS. I'M
CURIOUS IF MS. FAROOQ IS ON THE CALL. I SEE HER ON THE CALL. IF SHE
COULD WEIGH IN HERE. LET US KNOW IF THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US
ALLOW FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY OR IF IT IS STRAIGHT THAT THE VEGETATIVE
ROOF NEEDS TO BE ON TOP AND THE SOLAR PANEL ON TOP OF THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: MAY I CORRECT WHAT I SAID? I'M TALKING
ABOUT BIOSOLAR. VEGETATION WOULD BE IN SHADE. AND HEAVILY SUNNY
AREAS. IT IS BISOLAR OR GREEN ROOF IS WHAT I EMPHASIZE. APOLOGIZE IF
THAT IS CONFUSION. THERE ARE SITES BETTER FOR SOLAR WITH A GREEN
ROOF AND OTHERS THAT IT SHOULD ONLY BE A GREEN ROOF. THANK YOU.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. MY QUESTION DOES STILL STAND,
HOWEVER.
>> MS. FAROOQ: THANK YOU. THE FLEXIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO DO HAVE
AN OPTION WHERE THERE COULD BE SOLAR WHERE IT IS MOST
APPROPRIATE, GREEN ROOF WHERE THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE, AND THE
HYBRID BISOLAR IN OTHER LOCATIONS, IT IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER THIS
FORMULATION OF THE ORDINANCE ONLY FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OR
MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS, BUT NOT FOR NONRESIDENTIAL THE MAJORITY OF
NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND MIXED USE BUILDINGS.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. COMMERCIAL LAB, EVERYTHING ELSE,
VEGETATIVE AND THEN SOLAR ON TOP. NO FLEXIBILITY FOR 50% OF THE
ROOF TO BE JUST SOLAR. 50% OF THE ROOF TO BE JUST VEGETATIVE,
DEPENDING ON THE ROOF CONSTRUCTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM
AND CDD GETTING TOGETHER AND DECIDING WHAT IS BEST FOR THE SITE?
>> MS. FAROOQ: THAT IS HOW I'M READING THE AMENDMENT THAT IS
BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN PAST
MEETINGS, I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR JUST SOLAR
WHERE APPROPRIATE. I WON'T VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT. AND I DO
WANT TO REGISTER THAT I'M STILL CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE EXEMPTED
MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS FROM AN ORDINANCE THAT WE HAVE DECIDED IS
URGENT AND NECESSARY AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE EXEMPTING OUR
OWN SELVES MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT WAS
VOTED ON LAST TIME. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN ON THE RECORD, I'M
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND I WILL NOT VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT
AS PUT FORWARD BY COUNCILLOR NOLAN BECAUSE I FEEL WE NEED TO THAT
SOLAR FLEXIBILITY FOR THE ROOFTOPS. BEST WAY TO CAPTURE RENEWABLE
ENERGY ON SITE AND ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS HEAD ON.
THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I THINK PEOPLE MAY STILL BE


PAGE 66

MAY 3, 2021

CONFUSED. I THINK IT IS EXPLAINED MULTIPLE TIMES, BUT I'M STILL
DETECTING CONFUSION ON THE PART OF MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHAT
THIS ORDINANCE IS ACCOMPLISHING.
THE FLEXIBILITY ABSOLUTELY EXISTS TO PUT SOLAR OR NOT WHERE IT MAKES
SENSE TO DO SO. WE ARE PROPOSING THAT GREEN ROOF SHOULD ALWAYS
BE THERE AND THAT IN NO WAY LIMITS THE ABILITY TO PUT SOLAR ON TOP
OF THAT GREEN ROOF. THAT CONCERN IS JUST NOT A REAL PROBLEM. IT
KEEPS BEING RAISED, BUT IT IS NOT FACTUALLY CORRECT. YOU PUT THE
GREEN ROOF AND YOU PUT THE SOLAR PANEL ON TOP. THERE'S NO LOSS OF
SOLAR. IF WE WANT TO REQUIRE SOLAR, I THINK WE SHOULD, WE CAN ASK
FOR SOLAR TO BE PUT ON ADDITIONALLY WHERE YOU CAN'T PUT A GREEN
ROOF. LIKE USING CANOPY OVER CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND
THINGS LIKE THAT. I SAID THIS BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, WE SHOULD
ABSOLUTELY PUT IN PLACE A SOLAR REQUIREMENT SEPARATELY THAT WILL
INSIST THAT THE ROOFS BE MAXIMIZED WITH THEIR SOLAR POTENTIAL AND
THE GREEN ROOF POTENTIAL.
AGAIN, I'LL EXPLAIN PUTTING SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF IS GREAT, IT IS
NOT GOING TO BE ULTIMATELY A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR
CLIMATE SOLUTION. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE
THE BUILDING FAR EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR THAT WE CAN PUT ON
THE ROOFS. AND I DEFINITELY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO LOOK INTO SOME
OF THE WIND PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED AND WHERE THE
TURBINES ARE SO LARGE, A SINGLE BLADE, IS THE LENGTH OF A FOOTBALL
FIELD. WE TALK ABOUT MASSIVE WINDMILLS THAT WILL OPERATE IN THE
WATER JUST OFF SHORE OF MASSACHUSETTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE
CLEAN ENERGY THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO OPERATE.
WHILE IT IS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO MAXIMIZE THE SOLAR POTENTIAL, IT IS
BY NO MEANS A TRADE OFF. WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ONE MORE SOLAR
PANEL HERE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE MAKE OR BREAK OUR ABILITY TO
DEDICATE CLIMATE CHANGE. GREEN ROOFS HELP US TO PROTECT
OURSELVES FROM THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BY COOLING THE ROOF
IN THE AREA AROUND THE BUILDING.
I DO HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS. THE FIRST
PARAGRAPH IS BEING LABELLED A. AND THE RED TEXT AT THE BOTTOM, THE
PARAGRAPH SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL TO THE TEXT BEING CROSSED OUT,
EXCEPT FOR A TYPO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE REPLACE THE IDENTICAL
TEXT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I DIDN'T SEE THE TEXT WAS TAKEN OUT. I REDID IT
AND IT WAS THERE DOUBLE. THAT EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE. THERE IS JUST
A TYPO. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK WILSON? WHAT DO WE NEED TO CHANGE?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: ON THE CLERK'S SCREEN, IT IS SHOWING BOTH
SECTIONS ARE CROSSED OUT. THE LANGUAGE SENT TO US EARLIER. I'M
CONFUSED.

>> MR. CLERK: SECOND SENTENCE IN 22 READS AS FOLLOWS. FOR
COMMERCIAL LABS AND ALL MIXED USED BUILDINGS WITH A MAJORITY OF
SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT DEDICATED TO HOUSING, BUT EXEMPTING
MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS, 80% OF THE ROOF AREA OF THE BUILDING AS
MEASURED IN PLAIN VIEW, EXCLUDING THOSE PORTIONS LISTED BELOW,
SHALL BE DEVOTED TO GREEN ROOF AREA OR BIOSOLAR GREEN ROOF AREA.
IT IS THIS LANGUAGE HERE.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: WE REMOVE THIS PARAGRAPH AND MOVE IT
DOWN.
>> MR. CLERK: I DEFER TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THAT'S THE INTENT. CDD SUGGESTED PUTTING IN
SOME TABLE REFERENCES AND THEY RECOMMEND SEPARATING IT AND
HAVING A SECTION B. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I UNDERSTAND NOW. ELIMINATING THAT
SECOND SENTENCE. PARAGRAPH A. AND MOVE IT DOWN TO THIS NEW
PARAGRAPH B.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: AND CLARIFYING.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: OKAY. THAT LOOKS GOOD TO ME. I'M
PREPARED TO VOTE ON THAT. ON MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS, BECAUSE WE
EXEMPT THEM, IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WON'T HAVE GREEN ROOFS. WE PUT
THAT IS FOR THE TOBIN SCHOOL BECAUSE IT IS SO FAR ALONG. IT'LL BE NET
ZERO. WE HAVE A SCHOOL WITH A GREEN ROOF AND WE'LL UNDOUBTABLY
DESIGN FUTURE ONES WITH GREEN ROOFS AS IT MAKES SENSE TO DO SO.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. I WILL SPEAK ON THE
AMENDMENTS. I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT THAT ALLOWING SOLAR
ONLY FOR ROOFTOPS AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY. I STILL THINK THE
DEFINITION OF BISOLAR PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY. THE DEFINITION MAY MEAN
SOMETHING TO FOLKS IN THE BIOSOLAR COMMUNITY AT LARGE. I DON'T
THINK THAT'S THE DEFINITION WE WROTE INTO THE ORDINANCE. FOR
EXAMPLE, A NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDING, MADE A ROOF MOSTLY SOLAR
PANELS AND MINORITY OF VEGETATION, IT WOULD BE HARD TO ARGUE THAT
IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION. NOT TO TIE TOO MUCH TO THE PREVIOUS
DISCUSSION, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL DRAFTS
LAWS, THE THINGS WE PASS ARE OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. WE HAVE TO
GO BACK. THAT'S WHAT WE COME UP WITH FOR NOW AND I THINK IT IS A
GOOD COMPROMISE FOR THE MOMENT. I WILL VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT
TONIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN, IS THAT YOUR HAND?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IT IS ABOUT THE OVERALL
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE SHOULD THE AMENDMENTS ARE BEFORE
US, WE SHOULD VOTE THEM UP OR DOWN AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE
PETITION AS AMENDMENT BEFORE US. THEN YOU CAN SAY YOUR

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN, BACK TO YOU?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I HAVE TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT
THIS. I WON'T REPEAT ALL THAT PASSION. I WANT TO SAY, LITERALLY JUST
THIS WEEK, THREE DAYS AGO, A NORTHEASTERN STUDY NOTED THAT THE
MASSIVE DISPARITIES IN TREE COVER AND HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN LOW
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHEAST, SAYING WE ARE THE HIGHEST
IN THE COUNTRY FOR THAT PROBLEM. AND WE KNOW CAMBRIDGE ITSELF IS
NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS. TODAY'S HARVARD GAZETTE, POINTED TO A STUDY,
ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY SEA LEVEL WARMING IS NOT HUNDREDS
YEARS OF AWAY, BUT IN THIS CENTURY. THERE ARE WORKSHOPS ABOUT
SOCIAL JUSTICE. AND THERE'S A GROUP, CALLED SPRING FORWARD, AND THE
IDEA IS THAT TEENS GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE JUSTICE AND
HOW BIPOC COMMUNITIES ARE MORE EFFECTED. THOSE ARE THREE THINGS
THAT RUN ACROSS MY SCAN. WE STUDY THINGS, WE PLAN, WE HOST EVENTS
TO TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE, WHY IS IT WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND OTHER CITIES
AND THE WORLD. AND WE STILL HAVE WATERED DOWN AND CHANGED THIS
CLIMATE PROPOSAL TO BE FAR LESS EXPANSIVE THAN IT WAS WHEN
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED.
I WILL SAY FOR THE PEOPLE SUGGESTING WE SHOULDN'T MANDATE, THAT IS
THE PAST 25 YEARS, REMEMBER THE STATE OVERALL GREEN HOUSE GAS
EMISSION, DECREASED 20%. THAT'S MASSACHUSETTS. THAT'S WHILE THE
STATE GREW THE ECONOMY. HARVARD, DOWN 30%. DURING A PERIOD OF
CAMPUS EXPANSION. CAMBRIDGE CITY WIDE EMISSIONS, ZERO DECREASE
FROM 2005 TO 2018. OUR CITY'S REPORT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT A LITTLE
MORE SOLAR WILL NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. EVEN IF IT LEADS LESS SOLAR
THAN WHAT WAS THERE, TELL MAKE IT THE BETTER OPTION. IT WILL SOLVE

PAGE 69

MAY 3, 2021

ANY OF THAT? SHOULD WE TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, REQUIRE
SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP. PASSING THIS SEEMS TO BE CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT STEP TO TAKE ACTION AND NOT JUST PLANNING, HOPING, AND
ENCOURAGING. WE CAN HAVE GREEN ROOFS AND SOLAR. IT IS
ASTONISHING TO HEAR CLAMOR FOR REQUIRING SOLAR. WE CAN DO THAT
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT PASSES. DO IT AND HAVE SOME PART OF THE
CITY SUBJECT TO A GREEN ROOF SO WE CAN START TO ADDRESS HEAT ISLAND
EFFECT AND SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS PROBLEM
WE FACE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE? BEFORE WE MOVE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WANT TO ADD, THE STATE
ALREADY REQUIRES EVERY NEW BUILDING BE SOLAR READY. EVEN WITH THE
GREEN ROOF, THEY NEED TO BE SOLAR READY, WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY
TO ADD SOLAR A YEAR LATER, FIVE YEARS LATER, WHATEVER. AND THAT'S
THE GOAL. I HAVE DONE GREEN BUILDINGS. I KNOW THAT YOU NEED GOOD
SUN TO MAKE I'M SORRY. YOU NEED TO HAVE GOOD SUN TO MAKE SOLAR
ROOFS WORK. I WAS SURPRISED HOW MANY TIMES WE COULDN'T USE
SOLAR. VERY ODD LOCATIONS. THIS IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD AND I
THANK EVERYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW. IT IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. ENTERTAIN THE
MOTION TO ORDAIN.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COMMUNICATION THREE. (READING
COMMUNICATION 3).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THIS LETTER IS VERY APPROPRIATE
GIVEN OUR DISCUSSION TONIGHT. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NATURE
AND GREEN ROOFS. I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH. THE PORT HAS LESS THAN A
LITTLE MORE THAN 3% OF OPEN SPACE. OUR CITY HAS 7% OPEN SPACE. AND
THAT'S HALF OF THE AVERAGE IN THE COUNTRY. THAT MEANS THE PORT HAS
LESS THAN 1/4 OF WHAT THE AVERAGE CITY HAS IN ITS NEIGHBORHOODS.
THIS LETTER ASKS FOR MORE OPEN SPACE AND THEY MAKE A COMPELLING
CASE TO BE NEXT TO THE MARGARET FULLER HOUSE TO EXPAND THE OPEN
SPACE.
AND EARLIER TONIGHT WE TALKED ABOUT WATER STORAGE, RAIN STORAGE
TANKS, AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. ON THE REPORT LAST WEEK, A HEAT
ISLAND AREA ABOVE 90%, 84% WHERE SOME NEIGHBORHOODS ARE 10 AND
15% DUE TO A LACK OF OPEN SPACE AND TREE CANOPY. THEY MENTION
THAT THE OPEN SPACE I'M SORRY. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS
BEING LOOKED AT COULD GO TO THE FORMER SITE, WHICH I BELIEVE IS ON
SCHOOL STREET THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW YEARS AGO.
I JUST THINK THIS LETTER IS VERY COMPELLING. CONSIST OF 16 RESIDENTS
THAT SIGNED IT. I REACHED OUT TO THEM. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE
HAVE TO CONSIDER IF WE ARE GOING TO BE EQUITABLE. THAT'S ALL THEY
ASK FOR. THE LAST SENTENCE. WE ASK TO BE EQUALLY SERVED AS OTHER
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.

PROJECT, THE MARGARET FULLER HOUSE, HAS BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH
THEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. AS YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE DOING
ZONING, THAT PROJECT CAME UP AGAIN. MARGARET FULLER IS INDEED IN
NEED OF SERIOUS RENOVATIONS. THEY WERE TALKING HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT TO FINANCE THAT. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO AVOID THAT
MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT. AND THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE
SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY THERE TO BUILD SOME
AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP UNITS. I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE WITH MARGARET FULLER HOUSE AND I'M HAPPY TO
INCLUDE MY COLLEAGUE. TALK WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS
ARE AND SEE HOW THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD. IN GENERAL, THE PARKING

LOTS, WHICH I CALL CAR STORAGE, THE ROADS WHICH ARE ALL TO CARS,
THEY ARE THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF FUTURE OPEN SPACE. I
THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT THAT AS THE POLICY
QUESTION. HOW TO UTILIZE THAT SPACE GOING FORWARD. IF WE LEAVE IT
TO THE MARKET, THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE BUILDINGS THERE AND
POTENTIALLY PARKING GARAGES. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE,
PARTICULARLY IN THE PORT AND EAST CAMBRIDGE. AND WHERE I LIVE, VERY
DENSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND HAVE VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR
ADDITIONAL OPEN SPACE. IF WE START LOOKING AT ALL THE SPACE DEVOTED
TO CARS AND START IMAGINING HOW WE CAN REPURPOSE THAT SPACE TO
OPEN SPACE IN THE HUMAN SPACE, I THINK WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF
PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE? SEEING NO OTHER THANK YOU,
COUNCILLOR CARLONE, FOR BRINGING THIS. YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU
FOR COMMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: JUST QUICKLY, I THINK GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE
PURCHASED OPEN SPACE FOR IN WEST CAMBRIDGE, THAT WE'D EASILY
MATCH THE LAND COST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEN THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN GO ON SCHOOL STREET. IF YOU LOOK AT THE
LIST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE PORT, THEY HAVE DONE THEIR SHARE.
THEY ARE WAY ON THE BOTTOM FOR OPEN SPACE. THEY ALSO HAVE SOME
OF THE SMALLEST BACKYARDS IN THE CITY. I THINK THEY MAKE A GREAT
POINT. I AGREE WITH MY FELLOW COUNCILLOR, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
LET'S DISCUSS IT AND COME UP HAVE A PLAN FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT DEALS WITH ALL THE ISSUES. I THINK IT COULD BE VERY EXCITING AND
HELP WITH THE FLOODING SITUATION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIVE
IN THE PORT AND HAS DOES LIVE IN THE PORT AND HAS FOR A GOOD DEAL
OF MY LIFE, I VIEWED THE LETTER AND REACHED OUT TO SOME OF THE
SIGNERS OF THE LETTER. YOU GET THE AGENDA AND YOU HUSTLE TO REACH
OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE. I THINK IT IS WORTHY TO TRY TO HAVE GENERATE
A CONVERSATION THAT IS ORGANIC IN THE COMMUNITY. WHAT HAPPENS IN
THE PORT, PEOPLE WILL MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE RESIDENTS WITHOUT
ENGAGING THEM. THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A
WAY I WILL REACH OUT TO THEM AND HAVING ONE OF MY FIRESIDE CHATS.
I WILL KEEP MY COLLEAGUES ABREAST AS THE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE TO
GROW IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND CERTAIN LY LOVE THE SUPPORT OF MY
COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT ORGANIC CONVERSATIONS AND NOT TOP DOWN.
THANK YOU.

FIRST ORDERED SPECIFICALLY OVER THE PAST TERM. WE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT INCREASING MONEY IN RENTAL ASSISTANCE. WE DOES THAT DURING
THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC, WHICH WE STILL DURING THIS TIME OF THE
PANDEMIC. INCREASING FROM MEDIATION AS WE KNOW MORE AND MORE
PEOPLE ARE BEING FACED WITH DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF STAYING
IN THEIR HOME, INCREASING THE 100,000 TO 265,000. WE JUST SEE THIS AS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN RENTAL
HOUSING, PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE, PEOPLE THAT ARE
FACING EVICTION WILL HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THE
SERVICES. AND REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES. I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL WILL
SUPPORT THIS ORDER. I WANT TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT BY ADDING
MAYOR SIDDIQUI TO THIS ORDER. I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY ON THIS

SPEAK. I OPEN THE FLOOR TO DISCUSSION. THANK YOU.

ORDER NUMBER 3). COUNCILLOR NOLAN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. YOU HAVE PROVEN WE ARE ALL
GOING TO GET REALLY, REALLY GOOD AT ABOUT EVSE AND THE
NOMENCLATURE THAT COMES WITH THE TRANSITION OF GETTING RID OF
CARBON MOBILES. I WILL SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY, I THINK THE POLICY ORDER
LAYS IT OUT WELL ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. IT REALLY STARTS THE
PROCESS TO GUARANTEE WE CAN CATCH UP TO OTHER CITIES. IT IS NOT
ABOUT ADDING PARKING, WE ALL OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE'LL DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN AS THE CITY AND TRY TO DO EVERYTHING TO REDUCE
THE USE OF CARS IN THE CITY. HOWEVER, IT IS CERTAINLY CLEAR THERE WILL
BE THE USE OF VEHICLE AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND A FACT IN THE PLAN TO
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE POLICY IS ABOUT
ENSURING THAT THE PARKING THAT IS PUT IN PLACE FOR ANY NEW LARGE
DEVELOPMENT IS EQUIPPED TO CHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE STATE HAS
MANDATED NO GAS POWERED VEHICLES CAN BE SOLD AFTER 2035. WHY DO
WE ALLOW GARAGES AND PARKING SPACES THAT WILL BE AROUND 50 YEARS
FROM NOW NOT EV READY. IT IS COMMON SENSE. I WILL NOTE, AS YOU
MAY HAVE RECALLED FROM THE DISCUSSIONS IN A PRIOR MEETINGS,
BOSTON HAD THAT REQUIREMENT IN PLACE FOR SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS.
EXACTLY THE SAME. ALL NEW PARKING, 100% OF THE SPACES HAVE TO BE EV
READY. THE COST TO INSTALL WHEN BUILDING THE SPOT IS ABOUT 90%
CHEAPER THAN RETROFIT IT. AND BOSTON REQUIRES 25% OF SPOTS TO HAVE
AN EV CHARGER. AND SPEAKING WITH THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS, IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT WE PHRASE THIS
ORDER EXACTLY AS IT IS HERE. WE ASK THE CITY MANAGER TO WORK WITH
CDD AND TRAFFIC, PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION TO INCLUDE A NUMBER
OF PROJECTS IT IS THE BEST WAY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND THEY WILL
GIVE US ADVICE AND HOPE TO GET A REPORT BACK ON IMPLEMENTING THIS.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR THE COSPONSOR AND I HOPE
WE'LL MOVE FORWARD.

IMPORTANCE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE THE COSPONSOR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE POLICY
MAKER S. I WILL VOTE IN FAVOR. I WILL POINT OUT, IN SOME WAYS, WE ARE
STILL SKIRTING AROUND THE PROBLEM, WE STILL HAVE TOO MANY CARS. IF
WE TURN THEM ALL INTO EV, THEY ARE STILL TOO MANY. WE DON'T WANT
TO ADD CARS STORAGE TO OUR CITIES. THE WAY THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE
MARKET IS EVOLVING, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE OVER THE NEXT 10
20 YEARS, MASSIVE REDUCTION IN CAR OWNERSHIP. IT DOESN'T MAKE
ECONOMIC SENSE GIVEN WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING FOR EACH US
INDIVIDUALLY OWN A CAR.
PLANNING FOR THE NEW PARKING LOT TO BE BUILT, WE HAVE LOTS OF
INFRASTRUCTURE, IF IT IS NOT QUITE THE DIRECTION THAT I THINK WE
SHOULD GO IN. OF COURSE, IT SHOULD HAVE CHARGING STATIONS, BUT
THAT'S NOT MOSTLY WHAT SHOULD OR WILL BE HAPPENING. THIS TYPE OF
INFRASTRUCTURE GENERATES REVENUE FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER, THE
CHARGING COMPANIES ACTUALLY PAID FOR LEASING THE SPACE WHERE THE
CHARGERS ARE INSTALLED. GARAGE ALREADY HAVE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE
AND PRESUMABLY WILL BE ADDING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AND BASED ON
THE GROWTH OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET. I WILL VOTE IN FAVOR. I
THINK WE DO NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH OUR CAR CULTURE AND HOW WE
WANT TO PLAN OUR CITY GOING FORWARD SO WE ARE ALL LESS RELIANT ON
INDIVIDUAL CARS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE. THANK COUNCILLOR NOLAN
FOR THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND YOU HAD MANY, MANY MEETINGS AND
TOURS AND TALKS ABOUT THIS. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON IT. WE CAN
DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER 6. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 6).
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF GIVEN THE LATE
HOUR. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COSPONSORSHIP. WE HAD A
NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE YEARS, ESPECIALLY RECENTLY ON
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE THE LEVEL
OF EQUITY THAT WE NEED TO LOOK TOWARDS IF WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE
RACIAL JUSTICE, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE NUMBER ONE WAY THERE IS
GENERATIONAL WEALTH BUILDING THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP. WE HAVE
PROGRAMS IN THE CITY THAT HAVE A LIMITED EQUITY FACET TO THEM. THEY
ARE DEFINITELY WORTHY OF A SECOND LOOK RIGHT NOW, PARTICULARLY IN
THE BACKDROP OF THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING.
THE MAYOR AND MYSELF SPOKE WITH CDD AROUND WHAT CONVERSATIONS
ARE HAPPENING AT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST. AND WHETHER OR
NOT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE STARTING TO HAPPEN AND THEY ARE
STARTING TO HAPPEN. WE THOUGHT WE'D REALLY PUT THIS FORWARD
TONIGHT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AT THE CITY COUNCIL LEVEL, LET THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST KNOW WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN

LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE THERE IS THAT EQUITY THAT
CAN BE BUILT IN. I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME COMMENTS MADE EARLIER IN
THE MEETING AROUND HOMEOWNERSHIPS AND WHETHER THE HOMES WILL
BE CONTINUE TO BE AFFORDABLE. YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.
ONE OR TWO TIMES DOWN THE ROAD, THEY WOULDN'T BE AS AFFORDABLE
AS THEY COULD BE. THIS POLICY ORDER IS ASKING JUST THE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING TRUST AND THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT LOOK
AT WAYS THERE COULD BE MORE EQUITY IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP UNITS. I
WILL POINT OUT, THAT UNIT IS AFFORDABLE FOR A FAMILY WHO IS LIVING
THERE FOR POSSIBLY THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND HAND IT DON'T TO THE NEXT
GENERATION, WHICH SIMPLY IS NOT POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW UNDER THE
CURRENT CONSTRAINTS OF OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS.
I THINK WE ALL PROBABLY READ THE ARTICLE MR. FALLEN HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE HAS COME UP WITH A REALLY INTERESTING PARTNERSHIP AND
AGREEMENT WITH JUST A START AROUND HIS HOME AND WANTING TO
ENSURE IT DOES GO FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AND CREATING THAT EQUITY
AND WEALTH. THAT IS A 10% CAP AND CAN HAND IT DOWN. I THINK IT IS
WORTH LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN BE
MUCH MORE EQUITABLE IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS. I WANT TO
THANK THE MAYOR FOR THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS. AND JOINING ME WITH
THIS AND I'D LIKE TO POST A FEW AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ASKED US TO PUT FORWARD. I THINK THE
CLERK HAS EMAILED THEM TO YOU PRIOR TO THE MEETING. YOU SHOULD
HAVE THEM. THEY ARE COMING UP. THEY ARE SUGGESTIONS FROM CDD TO
STRENGTHEN THE POLICY ORDER. I VIEW THEM AS FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS.
WE HAVE PUT THEM BEFORE YOU TONIGHT AS AMENDMENTS TO THIS POLICY
ORDER.

Policy Order #6 as amended.
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to confer
with the Community
Development Department, the
Affordable Housing Trust, and
other relevant City
departments to provide options
to update the HomeBridge and
Affordable Home Ownership
Programs to better align with
the City’s values, and promote
racial equity and socioeconomic
justice

POLICY ORDER #7
Free the vaccine resolution

COUNCILLOR NOLAN WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US AS A COSPONSOR AND WE
WELCOME THAT. I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE SHE BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR TO
THIS POLICY ORDER AS WELL AS TAKING UP THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE
BEFORE US THAT THE CLERK HAS THE SCREEN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENTS? I DON'T SEE ANY
HANDS. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON THE AMENDMENTS. AND ADDING
COUNCILLOR NOLAN TO THE POLICY ORDER.

SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH WHEREAS PARAGRAPHS OF THE POLICY
ORDERS. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

WE CAN PROCEED TO DO A ROLL CALL ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED.

FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

MYSELF, COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. AS WE HEARD IN PUBLIC
COMMENT AND WE HAVE A COMMUNICATION LATER ON IN THE AGENDA ON
THE SITUATION IN INDIA. IT IS CERTAINLY AN EXAMPLE OF THE CHALLENGE
THAT WE ARE FACING GLOBE ALLY TO RESPOND TO THE COVID 19 CRISIS. IT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AS THE CITY COUNCIL OF CAMBRIDGE TO SPEAK
ON THIS BECAUSE WE ARE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION HUB, PERHAPS, MAYBE
THE PREMIERE HUB IN THE WORLD. AND OF COURSE THE INVENTOR OF ONE
VACCINE IS HEADQUARTERED HERE. REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
THESE COMPANIES ARE BEING WELL COMPENSATED FOR THEIR WORK ON
THE VACCINES. THE LIFE SAVING TECHNOLOGY. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST
TO ELIMINATE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS FOR THE TIME
BEING SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE VACCINE PRODUCTION COST RAPIDLY
AND INOCULATE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. WHILE THAT IS BOTH
HUMANITARIAN SPEAKING A GOOD THING TO DO, IT IS ALSO FROM A SELF
INTERESTED POINT OF VIEW. IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, YOU GIVE THE VIRUS
THAT MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLICATE, MUTATE, AND TURN INTO
MORE DANGEROUS VARIANTS THAT MAY ESCAPE THE VACCINE THAT WE
HAVE.
I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT US IN MAKING THIS CALL TO RELAX THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT VACCINE PRODUCTION
ACROSS THE GLOBE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I SEE NO
HANDS UP, ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL) NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER EIGHT. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 8)
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THIS CITY HAS WORKED A LOT ON
OPENING UP STREETS. WE HAVE TALKED A LOT IN THE LAST YEAR ABOUT
RESHAPING THE STREETS TO BUILD COMMUNITY SPACES INSTEAD OF
RESERVING SO MUCH PUBLIC LAND AREA FOR VEHICLES AND STARLIGHT
SQUARE IS AN EXAMPLE THAT PRE COVID NOBODY COULD IMAGINE. IT IS A
INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY SPACE. I BELIEVE THE MAYOR HOLDS OFFICE
HOURS THERE. LAST YEAR, WHEN THE STATE DID FUNDING, WE WERE
UNSURE HOW TO APPROACH BUILDING ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY SPACES.
WE GET INTO THE NEW NORMAL, HAVING ADDITIONAL SHARED AND SAFER
STREET INITIATIVES IS WHAT WE NEED AND THE FUNDING IS GREAT TO APPLY
FOR. I LET THE CITY MANAGER KNOW AND IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO
APPLY AND KNOW ABOUT THIS. IF WE CAN, WHETHER WE GET IT OR NOT, IT
IS EXCITING TO THINK ABOUT REIMAGINING THE PUBLIC SPACE. I WILL
ACKNOWLEDGE VICE MAYOR MALLON WANT TO BE ON THIS AND LIKE TO
ADD HER TO THE POLICY ORDER BECAUSE SHE IS INSTRUMENTAL IN DOING
THE WORK AROUND THE COMMUNITY BUILDING AND REIMAGINING OUR
STREETS. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON ADDING
THE VICE MAYOR MALLON TO THE POLICY ORDER.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANKS. AS THE CITY AND SOCIETY,
WE DEPENDENT ON NURSES A LOT MORE IN THE LAST YEAR THAN WE EVER
HAVE BEFORE. AND ALL OF US ON THE COUNCIL AND THE CITY HAVE GOTTEN
COVID TESTS AND GRATEFUL TO THE NURSES WHO CONDUCTED THEM. I
REMEMBER THE EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC, THE FOLKS DOING THE TESTS
LOOK LIKE THEY WERE IN FULL HAZMAT SUITS. IT WAS TERRIFYING FOR ME
AND OTHERS. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW TERRIFYING IT WAS FOR THE
NURSES IN THE SUITS. WE HAVE CALLED NURSES HEROS, SOCIAL WORKERS,
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATIONS, THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY ARE BEING
TREATED AS HEROS AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND THE NURSES AT
CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE HOSPITALS HAVE REASONABLE DEMANDS FOR
ASSIGNMENT LIMITS, CHARGE NURSES, ENSURE THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR TIME
OFF. THEY PUT OFF THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH WERE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE PLACE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND NOW COMING UP,
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE INCREASE IS RETROACTIVE.
I HOPE WE CAN PASS THIS. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE PASS THEM IN
SOLIDARITY WITH WORKERS WHO TRY TO FORM A UNION OR ON STRIKE OR
NEGOTIATING CONTRACT, IT IS WITH THE PRIVATE EMPLOYER. WE DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF DIRECT CONNECTION, OTHER THAN THE SOLIDARITY. IN THIS
CASE, THE CITY MANAGER AND THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER ON THE
BOARD OF THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, WE CAN DIRECTLY INFLUENCE
THE NEGOTIATIONS, THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION IN THE CASE, WHICH I
