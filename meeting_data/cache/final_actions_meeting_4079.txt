CRZTF Purpose
Recommend development standards for climate resilience to
incorporate into the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance
Specific Climate Change Impacts to Discuss:
• Impacts of flooding from sea level rise, storm surge, and precipitation
• Rise in temperatures exacerbated by the urban heat island effect
Scope of Zoning Recommendations:
• Major new development subject to project review procedures
• Smaller-scale new development subject to as-of-right zoning
• Additions/alterations to existing buildings and uses

CRZTF Zoning Recommendations
Five categories of recommendations:
1. Flood resilience standards
2. Heat resilience standards

3. Current zoning standards
4. Planning Board review

5. Future study

Why These Recommendations?
Ensure that new buildings are resilient throughout their lifetime
• Set flood resilience standards that are based on the future, not
the past
• Promote high-impact cooling strategies that provide co-benefits
• Remove small zoning obstacles so property owners can make
their properties more resilient
• Encourage developers to think holistically about resilience
• Adapt and change zoning, as needed

Packet Pg. 16

1. Flood Resilience Standards
Add new standards based on 2070 projected flooding elevations that are
consistent with current practices

2. Heat Resilience Standards
Add new standards tailored to achieve City policy goals based on best
available science

Packet Pg. 18

Why “Cool” Factor, Not “Green” Factor?
• There is no one “Green Factor” approach – precedents are tailored
to community needs
• Cool Factor includes most elements of Green Factor precedents, but
strategies & weighting are based on scientifically-proven cooling
benefits
• Some Green Factor strategies are duplicative of existing stormwater
standards – keeping them could lead to less overall site cooling
