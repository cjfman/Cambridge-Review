COUNCILLOR KELLEY
VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX
WHEREAS:

In the course of executing their ongoing responsibilities, City Councillors often have
questions that require specific and immediate legal expertise; and

WHEREAS:

The City Solicitor’s Office regularly provides guidance on a range of issues and across
City departments, but is less able to provide individual representation or advice to
Councillors on specific City Council matters, absent a formal City Council request for
legal assistance, and may be limited in its ability to provide answers in as timely a
fashion as City Councillors might want; and

WHEREAS:

A City Council budget item for City Councillors to seek direct legal advice from a preselected private attorney(ies), while providing all relevant questions and legal opinions
through City Council communications, would provide additional options and a more
customized and possibly more timely response to issues for which City Councillors
want specific legal guidance; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the Government Operations/Rules and Claims Committee be and hereby is
requested to coordinate with relevant staff to hold a meeting to discuss the feasibility
of adding a private attorney budget item to the City Council budget.
