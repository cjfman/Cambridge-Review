Possible Zoning Concepts
Category Concept

Issues/Considerations

Use

Change regulations for
Technical Office / R&D in
lower-scale districts

• Would capture all types of R&D (large/small, biological, other)
• Impacts might be felt most by smaller businesses
• If special permit, what are the criteria?

Use

Separate definition for “Life
Science,” change where it is
allowed

•
•
•
•

Review

Special design standards for
• Could include: mechanical system placement and screening,
Technical Office or Life
loading dock enclosure/management, noise and light mitigation
Science in lower-scale districts • Administrative review to certify standards are met

Review

Lower Project Review Special
Permit threshold for Technical
Office or Life Science

December 7, 2022

Focus on uses with more impact from mechanicals
How best to make the distinction? Will it always be clear?
Still could impact smaller businesses
If special permit, what are the criteria?

• More holistic review process
• Special permit process allows more flexibility, but time and
procedures can be burdensome
• Criteria in addition to Article 19?

What we heard on 3/17/22:
• Market Dynamics: lab space crowding out other use types in certain
districts (e.g., housing or retail)
• Land Use: compatibility concerns of some types of labs with other
land uses in a mixed-use district
• Use Definitions: Importance of distinguishing between the more
intensive lab uses and the less intensive lab uses

Single Definition

Split Definition

• Generally permitted in all office, research,
manufacturing/industrial districts

• Less intensive labs permitted in commercial areas,
general office districts, and light industrial

• Some restrictions in transition areas – prohibitions
in “neighborhood commercial”, “downtown
commercial” or retail-focused areas

• “Wet” labs permitted mostly in heavy industrial
districts or require some additional review
threshold (e.g., a special permit or design review)

• Municipalities with form-based zoning approaches
are more permissive of lab uses vs. traditional
zoning

Commercial Industry Trends
National & Local Trends
• Major markets like San Francisco, New York, and Greater Boston are seeing an increasing rate of
office space vacancy due to “work from home” and macroeconomic trends

• Companies are either not renewing leases, subleasing, back peddling on expansions, or breaking
leases.
• Companies that are looking for office space are looking for quality over quantity

Locally
• According to CBRE, between Q2 and Q3 2022, Cambridge office vacancy rates increased from
5.9% to 8.7% - highest vacancy level since 2013
• East Cambridge/Kendall Square has the tightest office and lab market
• Small and mid-size companies are having hard time finding small lab/flex spaces to stay and grow
in Cambridge

What Type of Industries Use Lab Space?
Life science and biotechnology firms are not the only
companies looking for R&D space. Other industries
that need wet and dry lab space include:
• Food incubators
• Medical Device
• Clean Energy
• Robotics/Automation
• Fabrication/Prototyping

Not all R&D need large mechanical arrays – mostly
biological laboratories, due to requirements for air

and small companies
• R&D uses have a range of space and
operational needs –flexible “core and shell”
space often desirable

Discussion
• Do we want to change the zoning definition of Technical Office to create a
category for smaller sized and diverse research?

• How can research/lab be a good neighbor in mixed use districts?
• Building design?
• Operations e.g. noise, lighting, ventilation?
• Use and character of ground floors

•

“Occupancies in Cambridge have trended near full for several consecutive quarters

•

Cambridge has little vacancy and remains the top choice for tenants

•

Developers continue to build in Cambridge, but Boston and the suburbs are set for much
larger percentage increases to their inventories

•

The Seaport has emerged as Greater Boston’s top lab node, outside of East Cambridge”
